 which followeth of Valla. Quoniam ver o nunc Alexandrum, Menelaus Postquam vicit; vult odiosam me domum abducere; Propterea vero nunc dolum (ceu dolos) cogitans aduenisti? Sede apud ipsum vadens, deorum abnega vias, Neque vnquam tuis pedibus reuertaris in coelum, Sed semper circa eum aerumnas perfer, & ipsum serua Donec te vel vxorem faciat, vel hic seruam, &c. Valla thus : Quoniam victo Paride, Menelaus , me miseram, est reportaturus ad lares, ideo tu, ideo falsa sub imagine venisti, vt me deciperes ob tuam nimiam in Paridem beneuolentia: e o dum illi ades, dum illi studes, dum pro illo satagis, dum illum obseruas atque custodis, deorum commercium reliquisti, nec ad eos reuersura es amplius; adeo (quantum suspicor) aut vxor eius efficieris, aut ancilla, &c. Wherein note if there be any such thing as most of this in Homer; yet only to expresse (as he thinkes ) Homers conceipt, for the more pleasure of the reader, he vseth this ouerplus dum illi ades, dum illi studes, dum pro illo satagis, dum illum obseruas, atque custodis, deorum commercium reliquisti. Which (besides his superfluitie) is vtterly false. For where he saith , reliquisti deorum commercium, Hellen saith , ![](/images/inline/THgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , deorum autem abnega, or abnue vias, ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , (vel ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , as it is vsed poetically) signifying denegare, or abnuere; & Hellen ( in contempt of her too much obseruing men) bids her renounce heauen, and come liue with Paris till he make her his wife or seruant; scoptically or scornefully speaking it: which both Valla, Eobanus, and all other interpreters (but these ad verbum) haue vtterly mist. And this one example I thought necessarie to insert here, to shew my detractors that they haue no reason to vilifie my circumlocution sometimes, when their most approued Grecians, Homers interpreters generally hold him fit to be so conuerted. Yet how much I differ, and with what authoritie, let my impartiall, and iudiciall reader iudge. Al vaies conceiuing how pedanticall and absurd an affectation it is, in the interpretation of any Author (much more of Homer) to turn him word for word; when (according to Horace and other best lawgiuers to translators) it is the part of euery knowing and iudiciall interpreter, not to follow the number and order of words, but the materiall things themselues, and sentences to weigh diligently; and to clothe and adorne them with words, and such a stile and forme of Oration, as are most apt for the language into which they are conuerted. If I haue not turned him in any place falsly (as all other his interpreters haue in many, and most of his chiefe places;) if I haue not left behind me any of his sentence, elegancie, height, intention, and inuention: if in some few places (especially in my first edition, being done so long since, & following the comon tract) I be somthing paraphrasticall & faulty; is it iustice in that poore fault (if they will needs haue it so) to drowne all the rest of my labour? But there is a certaine enuious Windsucker, that houers vp and downe, laboriously engrossing al the aire with his luxurious ambition; and buzzing into euery eare my detraction; affirming I turne Homer out of the Latine onely, &c. that sets all his associates, and the whole rabble of my maligners on their wings with him, to beare about my empaire, and poyson my reputation. One that, as he thinkes, whatsoeuer he giues to others, he takes from himselfe; so whatsoeuer he takes from others, he addes to himselfe. One that in this kinde of robberie, doth like Mercurie, that stole good, and supplied it with counterfeit bad still. One like the two gluttons , Phyloxenus and Gnatho, that would still emptie their noses in the dishes they loued, that no man might eate but themselues. For so this Castrill, with too hote a liuer, and lust after his owne glorie, and to deuoure all himselfe, discourageth all appetites to the fame of another. I haue striken, single him as you can. Nor note I this, to cast any rubbes, or plastest out of the particular way of mine owne estimation with the world; for I resolue this with the wilfully obscure : Sine honore viuam, nulloq; numero ero. Without mens honors I will liue, and make No number, in the manlesse course they take. But to discourage (if it might be) the generall detraction of industrious, and well-meaning vertue. I know I cannot too much diminish, and deiect my selfe; yet that passing little that I am, God onely knowes; to whose euer- implored respect, and comfort, I onely submit me. If any further edition of these my sillie endeuors shall chance, I will mend what is amisse (God assisting me) and amplifie my harsh Comment to Homers farre more right, and mine owne earnest, and ingenious loue of him. Notwithstanding, I know, the curious, and enuious, will neuer sit downe satisfied. A man may go ouer and ouer, till he come ouer and ouer; and his paines be onely his recompence: euery man is so loded with his particular head; and nothing in all respects perfect, but what is perceiued by few . Homer himselfe hath met with my fortune, in many maligners; and therefore may my poore-selfe, put vp with motion. And so little I will respect malignitie; and so much encourage my selfe with mine owne knowne strength, and what I finde within me, of comfort, and confirmance; (examining my selfe throughout, with a farre more iealous and seuere eye, then my greatest enemie; imitating this : Iudex ipse sui totum se explorat ad vnguem, &c.) That after these Iliads, I will (God lending me life and any meanest meanes) with more labour then I haue lost here, and all vncheckt alacritie, diue through his Odysses. Nor can I forget here (but with all heartie gratitude remember) my most ancient, learned, and right noble friend M. Richard Stapilton, first most desertfull mouer in the frame of our Homer. For which (and much other most ingenious and vtterly vndeserued desert) God make me amply his requiter; and be his honorable families speedy and full restorer. In the meane space, I intreate my impartiall, and iudiciall Reader; that all things to the quicke he will not pare; but humanely and nobly pardon defects; and if he find any thing perfect, receiue it vnenuied. writers, that there is no question (in my coniecture) of his antiquitie beyond all. To which opinion, the nearest I will cite ; Adam Cedrenus placeth him vnder Dauids & Solomons rule; & the destruction of Troy vnder Sauls. And of one age with Solomon, Michael Glycas Siculus affirmeth him . Aristotle (in tertio de Poetica) affirmes he was borne in the Ile of Io, begot of a Genius, one of them that vsed to dance with the Muses, and a virgine of that Ile, comprest by that Genius, who being quicke with child (for shame of the deed) came into a place called Ægina, and there was taken of theeues, and brought to Smyrna, to Moeon king of the Lydians, who for her beautie maried her. After which, she walking neare the flood Meletes; on that shore being ouertaken with the throwes of her deliuerie, she brought foorth Homer, and instantly died. The infant was receiued by Moeon, and brought vp as his owne till his death; which was not long after. And according to this, when the Lydians in Smyrna, were afflicted by the Æolians, and thought fit to leaue the citie, the Captaines by a Herald willing all to go out that would, and follow them ; Homer ( being a little child) said he would also ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . (that is  , sequi.) And of that, (for Melesigenes, which was his first name) he was called Homer. These Plutarch. The varieties of other reports touching this, I omit for length: and in place thereof, thinke it not vnfit to insert something of his praise, and honour amongst the greatest of all Ages; not that our most absolute of himselfe, needs it; but that such autenticall testimonies of his splendor and excellence, may the better conuince the malice of his maligners. First, what kind of person Homer was, (saith Spondanus) his statue teacheth; which Cedrenus describeth. The whole place we will describe, that our relation may hold the better coherence; as Nylander conuerts it. Then was the Octagonon at Constantinople consumed with fire; and the Bath of Seuerus, that bore the name of Zeuxippus: in which there was much varietie of spectacle, and splendor of Arts; the workes of all Ages being conferred, and preserued there, of Marble, Rockes, Stones, and Images of Brasse; to which, this onely wanted; that the soules of the persons they presented, were not in them. Amongst these master peeces, and all-wit-exceeding workmanships, stood Homer, as he was in his age; thoughtfull, and musing: his hands folded beneath his bosome; his beard vntrimmed, and hanging downe; the haire of his head in like sort thinne on both sides before; his face with age and cares of the world (as these imagine) wrinkled and austere; his nose proportioned to his other parts; his eyes fixt or turned vp to his eye browes, like one blind (as it is reported he was) not born blind (saith Vell. Paterculus) which he that imagins (saith he) is blind of all senses. Vpon his vnder coate he was attired with a loose robe; and at the base beneath his feet, a brazen chaine hung. This was the statue of Homer, which in that conflagration perished. Another renowned statue of his (saith Lucian in his Encomion of Demosthenes) stood in the temple of Ptolomy, on the vpper hand of his own statue . Cedrenus likewise remembreth a Library in the Pallace of the king, at Constantinople, that contained a thousand a hundred and twentie bookes: amongst which there was the gut of a Dragon, of an hundred and twentie foote long; in which, in letters of gold; the Iliads, and Odysses of Homer were inscribed: which miracle (in Basiliscus the Emperours time) was consumed with fire. For his respect amongst the most learned ; Plato in Ione calleth him , ἂ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , Poetarum omnium,  & praestantissimum, & diuinissimum.

This for Scaliger, and all Homers enuious and ignorant detractors. Why therefore , Plato in another place banisheth him with all other Poets out of his Common-wealth, dealing with them like a Politician indeed; vse men, and then cast them off, (though Homer he thinks fit to send out crowned and annointed;) I see not, since he maketh still such honorable mention of him; and with his verses, (as with precious Iemmes) euerie where enchaceth his writings. So Aristotle, continually celebrateth him. Nay euen amongst the Barbarous, not onely Homers name, but his Poems haue bene recorded and reuerenced. The Indians ( saith Ælianus var. hist. lib. 12. cap. 48.) in their owne tongue had Homers Poems translated and sung. Nor those Indians alone, but the kings of Persia. And amongst the Indians ( of all the Greek Poets , Homer being euer first in estimatio;) whensoeuer they vsed any diuine duties according to the custome of their housholds and hospitalies, they inuited euer , Apollo, and Homer. Lucian in his Encomion of Demosth. affirmeth all Poets celebrated Homers birth day; & sacrificed to him the first fruites of their verses. So Thersagoras answereth Lucian, he vsed to do himselfe . Alex. Paphius ( saith Eustathius) deliuers Homer, as borne of Egyptian Parents ; Dmasagoras being his father, and Æthra his mother; his nurse being a certaine Prophetesse, and the daughter of Oris, Isis Priest; from whose breasts, oftentimes, honey flowed in the mouth of the infant. After which, in the night, he vttered nine seuerall notes or voices of fowles , viz. of a Swallow, a Peacocke, a Doue, a Crow, a Partrich, a red-Shank, a Stare, a Blackebird, and a Nightingale: and being a little boy, was found playing in his bed with nine Doues . Sibylla being at a feast of his Parents, was taken with sodaine furie; and sung verses, whose beginning was ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)   : polynice, signifying much victorie; in which song also she called him ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  great in glorie; and ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif)  , signifying gyrlond-seller; and commanded him to build a temple to the  Pegridarij, that is, to the Muses . Herodotus affirmes, that Ph aemius ( teaching a publicke schoole at Smyrna) was his maister; and Dionysius in in 56. oration saith , Socrates was Homers scholler. In short; what he was, his workes shew most truly; to which (if you please) go on and examine him.
