[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-010.jpg) \- external link  - Preface iii. ] "I RECKON our folks don't want none of them fixings," said an Ohio housewife to a Connecticut pedler, who produced a pair of beaded moccasins, a shooting-pouch, and other hunting paraphernalia from his pack: "the boys have plenty of such trash of their own providing." The patient pedestrian offered next some prettily woven basket-ware and carved wooden bowls, to tempt a purchase from the settler's wife. "No! nor them nother," cried the virago: "the Miami Injuns do our basketing, and the Buck-eyes make better bowls than you can carve from your Yankee poplars. What does the fool mean by trying to sell us things we can make better nor him? Throw open your pack, manny, and let me choose for myself among your knicknacks." The recollection of this shrewish monologue, as once overheard by the Author in a western cabin, came vividly to his mind when about to select and remodel some of his lucubrations for Mr. Bentley ; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-011.jpg) \- external link  - Preface iv. ] and, after cutting and carving, altering and amending, never to his own satisfaction, he finally concluded to abide by the lesson given to the worthy pedler. Instead, therefore, of attempting to cater for, or conform to, tastes of which, as an untravelled foreigner, he knows but little, he has thrown open his pack to let the British reader choose for himself from its contents. In a word, these American sketches, written in the first instance without any view to European publication, are here committed to the hospitality of strangers nearly in their original shape, as they have from time to time accumulated during the rambles of the Author. The reader may perhaps detect in them the fragmentary execution of a more finished and com prehensive plan of scenic and legendary illustration of American subjects. The want of an international copyright law, however, with the paralizing effect upon American letters, which results from this barbaric anomaly in modern enlightenment, forbids any but the affluent among my countrymen to embark fully in such an undertaking.

Upon some of these, fleets might engage in battle; and their outlets, broken at first by cataracts which Switzerland alone can rival, soon swell into rivers, upon which the voyager may safely glide to climes a thousand miles away; while the Ohio, the Susquehannah, the Delaware, Hudson, and St. Lawrence, whose tributaries all interlace within a circle of a dozen miles in the heart of the state, give him a choice between the frozen shores of Labrador and the tropic seas of Mexico, in selecting the point where he would emerge upon the Atlantic main. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] In connecting these wonderful links of internal navigation, whose union an enlightened policy has now effected, it is singular that in the various topographical reconnoissances of the state the sources of so important a stream as the Hudson should only during the last year have been fully and satisfactorily explored. One would think that, however the subject might be overlooked by the legislature, it could never have escaped the Argus eyes of our inquisitive, fidgety, and prying countrymen, until the year of grace '37. Everybody was, indeed, aware that the Hudson rose among a group of mountains in the northern part of the state of New York; and if you looked upon the map, some of the lakes which formed its head-waters seemed to be laid down with sufficient particularity. Few, however, until the legislature instituted the geological survey which is now in progress, had any idea that the mountains upon which this noble river rises, overtopped the Katsbergs and the Alleghanies, and were among the loftiest in the United States; or that the lakes from which it draws its birth were equally remarkable for their prodigal numbers, their picturesque variety, and their wild and characteristic beauty. Tourists steamed upon the estuary of the Hudson, or loitered through the populous counties between the cities of New York and Albany, and, ignorant or unmindful that in ascending to the head of tide-water they had not seen quite one-half of the lordly stream, discussed its claims to consideration with an amiable familiarity, and, comparing its scenery with that of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] other celebrated rivers, they settled its whole character after a most summary fashion. The worthy Knickerbockers were, therefore, not a little surprised when they learned from the first official report of the surveying corps that their famous river was fed by mountain snows for ten months in the year; [1] and that there were a dozen cascades about its head-waters, to which Glen's Falls, however endeared to association by the genius of Cooper, must hereafter yield in romantic interest and attraction. Many were disposed at once to visit the sources of the Hudson; and, having in very early youth been much in the then savage district where some of the northern branches take their rise, the writer was so eager to penetrate farther into the same region, and behold the real head of the river, that he found himself rambling among the Adirondack Mountains of Essex county within a few days after the state geologist had pronounced upon it as now distinctly ascertained. The Hudson is formed by three mountain torrents, which unite within a few miles of their birth-place. The source of the highest fork is proved, by observation, to be nearly 3000 feet above tide-water. It rises in an open mountain meadow, with two adjacent mountains swelling in easy slopes from its sides. There is a still larger fountain-head west of this, in the same vicinity, rising in a singular gorge called "The Pass of the Adirondack Mountains:" while the northernmost source is in Lake Colden, or rather Avalanche Lake; a small mountain tarn separated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] from the former by heavy earth-slides from the adjacent mountain summits, whose granite rocks glitter where the soil and trees have been swept down their denuded sides. The elevation of these two lakes, which have a fall of eighty feet between them, is between 2900 and 3000 feet above the ocean; being undoubtedly the highest lakes in the United States of America. [2] [1] Snow remained on the high peak of the Adirondacks until the 17th of July, and appeared again on the 11th of September, 1837. [2] Emmon's Report---Redfield, &c. It was early in September when, accompanied by a friend---the companion of more than one pleasant ramble---I started upon the brief, but novel, tour. The winter sets in so early in the high mountain region for which we were bound, that, deeming we had no time to lose, we struck for it by the nearest route; and, instead of following the various windings of the river---which offer a delicious summer excursion for the man of leisure---we left tide-water at Lansingburgh, and, passing eastward of Lake George, went directly north by the way of Lake Champlain. Embarking upon this lake at Whitehall, a few hours brought our steamer abreast of Port Henry, a small village which heaves in sight immediately after passing the crumbling fortifications of Crown Point. A pretty cascade tumbles from the rocks near the landing, and is the first thing that strikes you when approaching the shore. Several wooded hills rise in succession behind it, and give a picturesque [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] appearance to a straggling hamlet along their base. Our route hence was due westward; and, the evening being fine, we engaged a conveyance to carry us on at once some twenty miles, through an almost unbroken forest, into the interior. The autumnal moon was shining brightly as we commenced ascending the hills in the rear of Port Henry, rising continually until we reached the village of Moriah, situated about three miles from the lake. The rearward view, in the meantime, was exceedingly fine. Indeed, I do not hesitate to say that Lake Champlain, as seen from those hills, presents one of the very finest lake views in the United States. Broad enough for majestic effect, yet not too broad for the picturesque character, which, I think, is worth everything else in scenery, the placid sheet of the lake lay, silvered by the moonbeams, below us. The promontory of Port Henry, with a headland of rival rock and forest opposite, nearly locked it upon the north. On the south the narrow peninsula of Crown Point, projecting longitudinally several miles into the lake, divided it into two friths, which gradually disappeared amid hill and forest, far in the distance; while immediately in front, though far beyond the broad, bright expanse of water, a dozen spurs of the Green Mountains, and a dozen main peaks beyond them, loomed in the dewy atmosphere of evening, like some vast Alpine chain. It was after midnight when we stopped at a log cabin about twenty miles from the lake. The hospitable settler, although his house was already filled with neighbours, who had come in to help him with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] his harvest, seemed to take very kindly the being roused from his slumbers at that late hour, to accommodate us. A log cabin and a pair of saddle-bags are never so full but that room can be found for something more, and we were soon packed beneath the same roof with the rest. Let me here initiate the reader into a mode of travelling which is much in fashion about the sources of the Hudson. Did he ever see a teamster riding upon a buckboard? a stout, springy plank, laid upon the bare bolsters of a wagon! Well, now, just spread a buffalo-skin upon that buckboard, and rig the iron chain from the fore and aft stakes, so as to form a stirrup for your feet, and you have the best sort of carriage that can be contrived for rough roads. Upon such a convenience our luggage was lashed about six o'clock the next morning; and the active little settler, our host of the log cabin, taking his axe in hand, to remove any fallen tree that might obstruct our road through the woods, whistled to his dog, Buck, jumped on the board beside us, cracked his whip, and off we went into the forest. Our driver was a right merry, stout-hearted, dashing little fellow: he had been brought up in the "Schroon country," as he called it, and had cleared every acre upon his thriving farm with his own hand; and, after roughing it for several years in his log cabin, was now prepared to build a snug frame-house upon his own ground. Our road was the worst that I ever saw, except a turnpike through the bed of a mountain torrent, which I once travelled in Eastern Kentucky. But stony declivities, stumps, quagmires, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] or fallen trees had no terrors for our little Schroon hero; and his lean, but mettlesome, horses dashed through everything. Such was the road, however, that, as it slammed about among trees and logs, the motion of our vehicle was as much lateral as forward, and we were several hours in making the first eight miles. Accomplishing this stage at last, however, we came to an opening in the forest, where, upon the bank of a lake, and in the midst of a clearing of about a hundred acres, stood the log cabin of a settler, at which we stopped to dine. The lake, or pond, as the people call it, was a limpid pool upon the top of a mountain, or rather an immense globular hill, flattened at top like an old-fashioned goblet, and surrounded with mountain peaks from which it stood wholly isolated. Upon the outlet of this lake was a saw-mill; and we here saw a model of a wooden railroad, contrived by a forester who has never seen a specimen of either, but whose ingenuity has found a field for its exercise, even in the depths of the woods. After refreshing ourselves and our horses at this place, we started again, and by nightfall accomplished twenty-three miles more, the whole distance being through a continuous forest, with not a single house by the way. About twilight we emerged from the forest, at the base of a lofty, cleared, and grassy hill, with a log cabin on the summit, prettily situated in front of a grove of tall maples, called, in the language of the country, a "sugar bush." This grassy domain---for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] the whole clearing of several hundred acres produced hay only---had a most singular effect in the bosom of a dark forest, surrounded, as it was, upon every side by mountains, which lapped each other as far as the eye could reach. This farm---if so neglected a tract could be thus characterized---presented a scene of solitude and desertion not uncommon in this part of the state. It had been cleared some ten or fifteen years since; but the original settler, seized with the emigrating fever which carries so many from our woodland region to the prairies of the far-west, had long deserted his mountain home: and the place had been so neglected until the present season, that it was in danger of relapsing into the half savage and almost irreclaimable state of what, in the language of the country, is called "a dead clearing." That is, when thickets and briers so overrun the land, and spread their roots and tendrils through the soil, that they become more difficult to eradicate than the original forest growth, which yields at once to the axe of the woodman. The new owners of the property, however, had now sent in some labourers from a more flourishing settlement, to harvest the wild hay, the native grasses of these mountains being peculiarly fine; and the overseer of the proprietors being present---a frank, intelligent yeoman, to whom we had a letter from his employers---our reception was as hearty and hospitable as he could make it with the rude appliances about him. There was no womankind about the establishment; and, after eating a hearty supper of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] fried pork and potatoes, cooked by a hunter, of whom I may speak hereafter, we made a bed of fresh hay in a corner, and, stretching a buffalo-skin over, by way of ticking, threw ourselves down and slept with a soundness that would have been commendable in either of those celebrated disciples of Morpheus, "the seven sleepers." During the last day's drive we had crossed many of the streams which form the head-waters of the Hudson; and on the morrow we for the first time saw one of the most beautiful of the lakes which form its sources. Hereafter, therefore, I shall copy the scenes that came under my observation as taken down separately in my note-book upon the spot. Striking the outlet of Lake Sandford where it flows through a forest of dark cedars, our luggage was shifted from the buckboard, and transferred, with ourselves, to a canoe: we embarked at the foot of a steep hill, but our course lay for some time through low, swampy ground, where the canoe could sometimes with difficulty find a deep-enough channel through the sedge and water-lilies that by turns covered the surface. This amphibious track, however, soon disappeared where the hills again coming down to the edge of the stream confined and deepened its current; and now, after a pull of a few hundred yards through a straight narrow passage, we launched out upon the bosom of one of those [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] beautiful lakes with which this region abounds. Not a sign of a house or a clearing, nor any mark of the handiwork of man, was to be seen anywhere, save in the rude shallop that bore us. The morning was still and lowering. There was not breeze enough to lift the fog from the mountains round. Every rock and tree was reflected, with each leaf and wild flower however minute, in the glassy surface; the islands among which we wound our course floated double; the hermit-like loon that glanced from beneath their embowering shelter, and sent his wild cry with a dozen echoes far among the hills, was the only object that moved or gave a sound of life across the waters. We landed upon one islet, and I paused to observe what I have never been wearied with studying---the manner in which nature effects her work of clothing the barren crags with soil. Here, on this rocky islet, some fifty feet in diameter, the whole process may be seen---the first covering of moss and lichens; the larger growth of the same; the light black soil that is formed from their decay; the taller plants that again, in succession, are doomed to die and be decomposed, and afford earthy nourishment to the first hardy forest growth; still, in its turn, to be succeeded by softer woods, may all be traced upon Inch-Hamish. On this little spot too, where you can run a stick some three feet down, through the primitive mosses which form the first covering of the rock, you have also the towering spruce, the ragged arbor-vitae, and several other hardy evergreen varieties; while a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] single delicate white ash has put forth its deciduous leaves, and hung its scarlet berries over the lake. An accomplished botanist has, I am told, found upward of a hundred varieties of plants and trees upon this islet, which is less than an acre in extent. Cruising leisurely up the lake in this way---pausing ever and anon to admire the change of prospect as we wound round some green headland, or lying upon our oars while trying the fine echoes which the mountains gave back to our voices whenever our course lay far from the margin---it was afternoon before we reached the point for debarking, which we attained by piercing deep within a forest that over-shadows the inlet. Our canoe left the cheerful lake, and, floating beneath the boughs of ancient trees that sometimes interlaced above our heads, startled the trout from the black pools which bathed their roots, and grated at last upon a gravelly bank, where it was drawn up and secured. Not far from this point a portage of a few hundred yards enables the hunter to launch again upon Lake Henderson, and strike the first link in a chain of lakes which, with a few more brief portages, will float his shallop all the way to the St. Lawrence. The portage to Lake Henderson is occasioned by rapids which extend for about half a mile between that water and Lake Sandford. They run over a bed of iron ore which ribs the sides of two mountains [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] that overhang the valley through which the Hudson flows from one lake into the other. This little valley, which is already cleared and under partial cultivation, is the site of a projected manufacturing town; and here we made our head-quarters at a comfortable farm-house. We were inducted into them by the overseer already mentioned, and, under his cordial auspices, my friend and myself for some days enjoyed the hospitality of the proprietors of the Adirondack iron-works. The situation, abounding, as it does, in excellent iron ore, and affording a dozen mill sites, is admirably adapted for a manufacturing town, and might form the site of one of the most romantic villages in the Union. The newness of the improvements, and the large clearings, marked only by stumps, give the place, as yet, a somewhat desolate appearance: care and capital will, however, soon remedy this; and when the legislature does justice to this much-neglected portion of the state, and opens a good road or canal along the beautiful lakes with which it abounds, M`Intyre will become one of the most favourite places of resort near the sources of the Hudson. Its present loneliness and seclusion, however, would render M`Intyre not less pleasing to some tastes; while, though the hand of improvement may soon make the district in which it lies more accessible than it now is, and add some features of cultivation to the adjacent scenery, it can never soften its wildness. In fact, a partial clearing of the country will, in this region, only serve to heighten the bold features of the landscape. For the trees whose [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] foliage now softens the sharper outlines of the mountains, and curtains many a tall crag and deep fell from view, will, when swept away, reveal scenes of desolate grandeur, which no culture can rob of their sternness. In some places the hunters' fires have already bared the pinnacles of some of these granite mountains: and earth-slides, caused by frequent rains, or slight earthquakes, which still prevail in this region, strip them here and there of their verdurous vesture, leaving only parapets of naked rock frowning upon the deep forests below them. Apropos to earthquakes, we had an inkling of one on the first night of our arrival at M`Intyre. The shock, if so slight a tremour may be thus characterized, took place about midnight; and, though it woke me, I deemed it at the time the effect of fancy, until I compared notes in the morning with my fellow-traveller, who, having experienced the sensation while in Caraccas some years since, could readily recognise it now. We occupied two rooms communicating with each other; the outer one, where my friend had his bed, opened upon the clearing. The door of this latter chamber, being badly hung, shut with great difficulty, and was generally left ajar; but on this occasion, the night being cold and frosty, I too particular pains to secure it---driving it to by planting my foot against it, and forcing the latch completely home. We retired early that night, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] fatigue of travelling made our sleep particularly sound, when suddenly, about an hour after midnight, both of us were awakened at the same moment, and, notwithstanding both were struck by the circumstance, the cause did not occur to us till the morning; though our surprise was expressed after the wonted manner of sleepy men when startled from their slumbers. "Hallo!" "Hallo!" "What's that?" "Are you up?" "No! are you?" "My bed shakes!" "It's that infernal hound; he's pushed my door wide open, and I must get up and shut it." "There's no dog here, in my room. "The rascal's cleared out, then. Confound the door, I can't get it close again." "How's the night?" "Clear and starry, and still as one in the tropics, but devilish cold." With these words, my friend commenced jamming at the door, secured it anew, jumped into bed again, and we were soon after dreaming as before. No noise accompanied this tremour; but they tell us here that a sound like that of a heavy wagon upon a frozen road is often heard among these mountains, where there are no roads which a wagon can traverse. I need hardly add that no dog could have opened the door which it cost me so much trouble to shut; nor, in fact, would the well-trained hound [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] have ventured upon leaving his quarters to disturb ours. Admitting the existence of occasional slight earthquakes in this region, I am not enough of a naturalist to surmise what may be their effect upon the geological features of the country. They seem, however, among other things, to indicate the unfinished state of the country  , if I may so express myself. They are among the agents of nature, still at work in completing a portion of the world hardly yet ready to pass from her hands into those of man. The separation of the water from the land, which classic cosmogonists tell us followed the birth of light, in evolving the earth from chaos, is not here completed yet. There are lakes on the tops of the mountains, and swamps among wildernesses of rocks, which are yet to be drained by other means than the thick exhalations which carry them into the atmosphere, or the dripping mosses through which they ooze into the valleys, where day by day the new soil for future use accumulates. Had our New York Indians, who now find it so difficult to hold on to their level and fertile lands in the western part of the state, but "located" their reservations among these mountains, they might have escaped the cupidity of the whites for centuries yet to come, and have hunted the deer, the moose, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] the bear, or trapped for the martin, the sable, and the ermine, all of which still abound here, without molestation, save from the occasional white hunter that might intrude upon their grounds when chasing the wolf or panther from the settled regions to the east and west of them. There are settlements upon some of these lakes which were commenced more than thirty years since, and which can now boast of but two or three families as residents, and these are isolated from the rest of the world, with twenty miles of unbroken forest between them and more prosperous hamlets. But the immense beds of iron ore and other minerals recently discovered, with the increased demand for timber in our Atlantic cities, and of charcoal to work the mines here, must now bring the country into general notice, and hasten its settlement. The demolition of the pine forests, and the conversion of less valuable wood into charcoal, will rapidly clear the country, and convert the lumber-men and charcoal-burners into farmers; while the old race of hunters already begin to find a new employment in acting as guides to the owners of lands, and projecting roads for them through districts where an ordinary surveyor could hardly be paid for the exercise of his profession. One of these hunters, a sturdy original, by the name of Harvey Holt, a redoubtable hunter and celebrated axe-man, has already marked out a road for some of the large landed proprietors through the very heart of the region. He is said to have run his lines with the skill and accuracy of an accomplished engineer; and, before another year elapses, the road will probably be opened. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] Other foresters, again, finding their ancient haunts thus invaded by the pioneers of improvement, have fled to wilds beyond the Wisconsan; and a friend who hunted lately upon a tract a little to the north-west of this, in Hamilton county, told me that he heard a veteran hunter of seventy complaining bitterly that he was too old to move, now that the settlers had pushed within thirty miles of him. It seems strange to find so wild a district in "one of the old thirteeners," the "empire state of New York." But the great western canal, in facilitating emigration to the new states, has retarded the improvement of this region for at least one generation, in luring off the young men as fast as they become of an age to choose a home for themselves. Some, however, like the mountaineer who is the subject of the following sketch, are so attached to the woods and streams of their native hills, that no inducement could lure them to the prairies. I WAS lately looking over Cooper's "pioneers," and, re-reading it after the lapse of years, found myself as much delighted as ever with the best character he ever drew---"The Leather-stocking." If it did not involve an anachronism, I could swear that Cooper took the character of Natty Bumpo from my mountaineer friend, John Cheney. The same silent, simple, deep love of the woods; the same gentleness and benevolence of feeling toward all who love his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] craft; the same unobtrusive kindness toward all others; and, lastly, the same shrewdness as a woodman, and gamesomeness of spirit as a hunter, are common to both; and each, while perhaps more efficient, are wholly unlike the dashing swash-buckler of the far-west, the reckless ranger of the prairies. In appearance, dress, language, and manner those two varieties of the genus venator are totally different. Mr. Irving, in his account of Captain Bonneville's expedition, has given the best description of the latter; but, though the pen of Cooper has made the former immortal, I think his genius might gather some new touches from John Cheney, Worthy John! if he chances to see himself thus drawn at full length, I hope he will not take it amiss. I had heard of some of his feats before coming into this region, and expected of course to see one of those roystering, "cavorting," rifle-shirted blades that I have seen upon our western frontier, and was at first not a little disappointed when a slight-looking man of about seven-and-thirty, dressed like a plain countryman, and of a peculiarly quiet, simple manner, was introduced to me as the doughty slayer of bears and panthers; a man that lived winter and summer three-fourths of the time in the woods, and a real bon a fide hunter by profession. Nay, there struck me as being something of the ridiculous about his character when I saw that this formidable Nimrod carried with him, as his only weapons and insignia of his art, a pistol and a jack-knife! But when, at my laughing at such toys, I was told by others of the savage encounters which John, assisted by his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] dog, and aided by these alone, had undertaken successfully--- not to mention the number of deer which he sent every winter to market---my respect for his hunting-tools was mightily increased, and a week in the woods with him sufficed to extend that respect to himself. We were on a fishing excursion one day on a lake near M`Intyre; and, after storing our canoe with a good supply of brook and lake trout, we weighed anchor, and pulled for a romantic promontory, commanding a delicious prospect, where we lay under the trees for hours, enjoying our pic-nic, and listening to hunters' stories. The air being cool and bracing, did not make the fire by which we cooked our dinner unacceptable. Our cloaks were stretched beneath a clump of cedars, and, after taking a plunge into the lake, which I was glad to make as brief as possible, I lay by the fire, watching the blue smoke curl up among the trees, or listening to my fellow-traveller as he discoursed curiously with John about his cooking, or plied him from time to time with questions that elicited some anecdotes of wild-wood sports, of which my quiet friend has been no feeble practiser himself. "Well!" said Cheney, after he had cooked the trout to a turn, and placed a plump, red, juicy fellow upon a clean cedar chip before each of us, with an accompaniment of roast potatoes and capital wheaten bread; "now, isn't this better than taking your dinner shut up in a close room?" "Certainly, John," said I. "A man ought never to go into a house, except he is ill, and wishes to use it for a hospital." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] "Well, now, I don't know whether you are in airnest in saying that, but that's jist my way of thinking. Twice I have given up hunting, and taken to a farm: but I always get sick after living long in housen. I don't sleep well in them; and sometimes when I go to see my friends, not wishing to seem particular-like, I jist let them go quietly to bed, and then slip out of a window with my blanket, and get a good nap under a tree in the open air. A man wants nothing but a tree above him to keep off the dew, and make him feel kind of home-like, and then he can enjoy a raal sleep." In Tanner's narrative, that singular character makes nearly the same remark, when speaking of the usages which annoyed him while trying to abandon the habits of a free hunter, and conform to the customs of civilized life. "But are you never disturbed by any wild animal when sleeping thus without a fire or a camp?" one of us asked. "Well, I remember once being wakened by a creetur. The dumb thing was standing right over me, looking into my face. It was so dark that neither of us, I suppose, could see what the other was: but he was more frightened than I was; for, when I raised myself a little, he ran off so fast that I couldn't make out what he was; and seeing it was so dark that to follow him would be of no account, I laid down again and slept till morning, without his disturbing me again." "Suppose it had been a bear?" "Well, a bear isn't exactly the varmint to buckle with so off-hand; though lying on your back is about [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] as good a way as any to receive him, if your knife be long and sharp; but afore now I've treed a bear at nightfall, and, sitting by the root of the tree until he should come down, have fallen asleep, from being too tired to keep good watch, and let the fellow escape before morning; but if I had such luck as to have a good fat bear come to me in that way, I would never let him go as that man did down at Ti." I asked the story of this unworthy follower of the chase at Ti , into which familiar monosyllable Cheney abbreviated the celebrated name of Ticonderoga, and give it here to the reader as nearly as possible in worthy John's own words. "I DON'T want to say anything against any man; but some people, till they get lost in them, seem to think a knowledge of the woods a mighty small matter; but this is neither here nor there though, but it's a fact that, however big they may talk at home, folks that ain't used to the woods sometimes get mightily flurried when they meet with these wild animals. There now's a man in the next town who went out after moose, and, when he heard one trotting along the same trail he was travelling, squatted behind a stump to shoot him; but the fellow, having never seen a moose, had no idea of the sort of game he was after; and when a great bull six-year-old, bigger than a horse, with horns that looked for all creation as if they never could pass between the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] trees of these woods, came crashing the branches with his broad hoofs, the man kinder shrunk behind a log, and says he to the moose, `If you'll only let me alone, I'll let you alone.' "Now, this other fellow in Ti only knew about bears as he had heard us trappers speak of them, as carrying a half a dozen balls in their bodies, and sometimes killing our dogs for us when we go to take them out of our traps, after being held there by the paw, starving, you don't know how many days. Well, this man was on a lake watching in his boat for deer, when, hearing a plunge and a splash, he pulls round an island, and finds a great she-bear swimming straight across the lake. Being a good fellow with his oars, he pulls at once to cut off the bear from the opposite shore, which made the creetur change her course, and try and swim round the boat. The man, however, again turned her, and the bear once more altered her course, but still kept for the same shore to which she had been steering. Gathering spunk now, the man, in turning the third time, rowed nearer to the beast, expecting in this way to drive her back a little, so as to keep the bear out in the middle of the lake until some one could come to help him. But when the starn of the boat, in swinging round, came near the bear, she put her paws upon it, and raised herself right into the boat, and there she sat on eend, looking the man in the face jist as quiet, now, as a bear could look. Well, the man, if he'd only know'd where to hit a bear, might have brought one of his oars down on the back of her skull jist as easy as say so; and tough ash is better [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] than a rifle-ball with these varmint. But he didn't like that kind o' quiet look the creetur gave him; and there they sat, the bear looking at the man, and the man looking at the bear. At last, when he got over his fright a little, he began to move his oars slowly, in order to creep toward the shore from which the bear had started; but the creetur wouldn't allow this; she moved from her seat a little toward the man, and showed her teeth in a way he didn't like; but as soon as the man turned the boat, the bear took her old place again, and sat there jist as contented as you please; so the man pulled for the shore to which the bear had been swimming, watching the bear's face all the while. And would you believe it, now, that bear made him back his boat in toward a rock, upon which the creetur stepped from the starn, and, turning round, gave the man a growl for his pains afore she walked off into the woods. Tormented lightning! to be bullied so by a bear! Why, I would have died upon the spot afore that bear should have left the boat without our trying which was the best of us." Leaving the cleared fields of M`Intyre one morning under the guidance of John Cheney, we struck the arm of a lake entirely surrounded by primitive forest, and locked up in mountains wooded to the summit. The frith upon which we embarked was the outlet of Lake Henderson; and, emerging from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] its shadowy embrace as we laid our course up the lake, we soon shot out upon the bosom of that beautiful water. The form of the lake, for want of a better simile, I can only compare to that most respectable ancient head-gear, a three-cornered hat a little knocked out of shape. Its several friths, too, strike in among the mountains with the same sort of devil-may-care air that a fiercely-cocked beaver did whilome put on. Yet so completely do the dense woods around soften away all the harder lines of the landscape, that the general effect is that of beauty rather than savageness in the picture. We pulled for about two miles through this lake, where at each boat's length some new fold of mountain scenery was unfurled upon our left, while the two peaks of the Indian Pass and the Panther Gap kept their bold heights continually in view upon our right. We landed upon the margin of a heavy swamp, near the inlet of the lake, floating some twenty yards within the forest, and mooring our boat at last among ancient trees, whose long moss sometimes swept the water. We were bound for "The Indian Pass," one of the most savage and stupendous among the many wild and imposing scenes at the sources of the Hudson. It has been visited, I believe, by few, except the hunters`of these mountains; but it must at some day become a favourite resort with the lovers of the picturesque. It is a tremendous ravine, cloven through the summit of a mountain, presenting the finest piece of rock scenery I ever beheld---a cradle worthy of the infant Hudson. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] Many of the difficulties in exploring this scene will probably vanish in a few years; but as the wildness of the approach now adds not a little to its majesty, I can best convey the true character of the place by leading the reader thither in the mode I reached it. The walk to the Indian Pass is difficult enough at any time; but soon after leaving our boat at the inlet of Lake Henderson, the morning, which had hitherto been cloudy, broke into a cold rain, which, wetting our clothes through, increased the weight that we had to drag through a primitive swamp; where each step was upon some slippery log, affording a precarious foothold, some decayed tree, into whose spongy body you would sink knee-deep, or upon quaking mosses, that threatened to swallow one up entirely. Here, however, while wading through the frequent pools, or stumbling over the fallen boughs which centuries had accumulated, I would often pause to admire some gigantic pine, which, drawing vigour from the dankness and decay around it, threw its enormous column into the air, towering a hundred feet above hemlocks and cedars near, which would themselves seem forest giants when planted beside the modern growth of our Atlantic border. After a mile of such walking, the ground began to rise, and, instead of wading through pools, we now crossed several brisk streams, which murmured [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] among the rocks as their pellucid waters ran to join the main inlet of the lake. Our path lay next along the border of this inlet, which is one of the chief branches of the Hudson. Sometimes we would ascend for several hundred yards among mossy rocks, thickets of white cedar, and an undergrowth of juniper; then we would come to a sort of plateau of swampy land, overgrown with moose maple, or tangled with fern and interspersed with cranberry bogs. Another slope of rocky ground, seamed with numerous rills, that gurgled beneath the roots of hoary birches or amid thickets of young maple, succeeded; while again and again we crossed and recrossed the main stream, upon fallen logs, generally lying either immediately upon or below one of the numerous cascades which diversify the river. Now we scaled some rocky hill-side, and heard the torrent roaring far beneath us; and now we found a narrow passage-way between its border and the impending cliffs. In the meantime, though winding up and down continually, we were in the main ascending gradually to a lofty elevation. The number of the swamps were diminished, the frequent rills flashed more rapidly amid the loose boulders of rock, which soon began to cover the soil entirely; while the boulders themselves became lofty hillocks of solid stone, covered with moss, and sustaining a vigorous growth of the birch, the mountain ash, or clumps of the hardy white cedar upon their summits. Wet, bruised, and weary, we sat down beneath one of those enormous masses of displaced rock [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] after scaling a difficult ascent, and purposed to encamp there for the night; but, looking up through an opening in the trees, we saw the cliffs of the Indian Pass almost immediately above us. They were swathed in mist, and the heavy scud, impelled by the wind which drew strongly through the gap, drifted past the gray precipice, and made the wall look as if in motion to crush us when just entering the jaws of the ravine. But there were still two hours of daylight left; and, though the mile that was yet to be traversed before we gained the centre of the pass, was the most arduous part of the whole route, we again commenced the ascent. It took the whole two hours to accomplish this mile; but as the glen narrowed, our farther progress was animated by a new object of interest, in the shape of a fresh moose track; and we followed the trail until it broke off abruptly in a rocky gorge, wilder than any I had ever yet beheld. It was new to me to find the footprints of so large an animal among rocks that seemed only accessible to a goat. We saw several places where the moose had slipped upon the thin and slimy soil, or dashed the moss from the crags with his hoofs as he leaped a chasm. Following on the trail with caution, our guide held himself in readiness to shoot, confident that we must soon overtake our noble quarry, as no animal of the kind could possibly make his way [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] completely through the defile; but we soon came to a passage among the rocks, where the discreet brute, perceiving that there was but one way of returning if he ascended higher, had, after making a slight attempt to force himself through, struck into a lateral ravine, and sought some other path down the mountain. I must adopt a homely similitude to give the reader an idea of the size of the rocks and their confused appearance in this part of the defile: he may imagine, though, loose boulders of solid rock, the size of tall city dwelling-houses, hurled from a mountain summit into a chasm a thousand feet in depth, lying upon each other as if they had fallen but yesterday; each so detached from each that it is only their weight which seems to prevent them from rolling farther down the defile: their corners meeting in angles that defy the mathematician to describe, and forming caverns and labyrinthine passages beneath them that no draughtsman could delineate. The position of these tremendous crags seems so recent and precarious, that, were it not for other indications around them, you would almost fear that your footsteps might topple over the gigantic masses, and renew an onward motion that was but now arrested. But Time has stamped the date of ages in other language upon their brows. Their tops are thatched with lichens that must be the growth of centuries; ancient trees are perched upon their pinnacles, and enormous twisted roots, which form a network over the chasms between them, and save your limbs from destruction when stepping over [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] the treacherous moss that hide these black abysses, prove that the graceful hand of nature has been here at work for ages in veiling over the ruin she has wrought in some one moment of violence. But we are now in the bosom of the pass, and the shadows of night are concealing the awful precipice which forms the background of the picture. We have climbed the last ascent, more steep than all the rest, and here, in a clump of birches and balsam firs, surrounded by cliffs and precipices on every side, is our place to bivouac for the night. " It ain't so bad a place for camping out," said John Cheney, as he rose from slaking his thirst at a slender rill which trickled from beneath the roots of a rifted cedar over which he leaned---"it ain't so bad a place to camp, if it didn't rain so like all natur. I wouldn't mind the rain much nother, if we had a good shantee; but you see the birch bark won't run at this season, and it's pretty hard to make a water-proof thatch, unless you have hemlock boughs: hows'ever, gentlemen, I'll do the best by ye." And so he did! Honest John Cheney, thou art at once as stanch a hunter, and as true and gentle a practiser of woodcraft as ever roamed the broad forest; and beshrew me when I forget thy services that night in the Indian Pass. The frame of a wigwam used by some former party [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] was still standing, and Cheney went to work industriously tying poles across it with withes of yellow birch, and thatching the roof and sides with boughs of balsam fir. Having but one axe with us, my friend and myself were, in the meantime, unemployed; and nothing could be more disconsolate than our situation as we stood dripping in the cold rain, and thrashing our arms like hackney-coachmen, to keep the blood in circulation. My companion, indeed, was in a much worse condition than myself. He had been indisposed when he started upon the expedition, and was now so hoarse that I could scarcely hear him speak amid the gusts of wind which swept through the ravine. We both shivered as if in an ague, but to his troubles a fever was soon superadded. We made repeated attempts to strike a fire, but our friction matches would not ignite; and when we had recourse to flint and steel, everything was so damp around us that fire would not kindle. John began to look exceedingly anxious. "Now, if we only had a little daylight left, I would make some shackleberry-tea for you; but it will never do to get sick here, for if this storm prove a north-easter, God only knows whether all of us may ever get away from this notch again. I guess I had better leave the camp as it is, and first make a fire for you." Saying this, Cheney shouldered his axe, and striding off a few yards, he felled a dead tree, split it open, and took some dry chips from the heart. I then spread my cloak over the spot where he laid them to keep off the rain, and, stooping under it, he soon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] kindled a blaze, which we employed ourselves in feeding until the "camp" was completed. And now came the task of laying in a supply of fuel for the night. This the woodman effected by himself with an expedition that was marvellous. Measuring three or four trees with his eye, to see that they would fall near the fire without touching our wigwam, he attacked them with his axe, felled, and chopped them into logs, and made his wood-pile in less time than could a city sawyer, who had all his timber carted to hand. Blankets were then produced from a pack which he had carried on his back; and these, when stretched over a carpeting of leaves and branches, would have made a comfortable bed, if the latter had not been saturated with rain. Matters, however, seemed to assume a comfortable aspect, as we now sat under the shade of boughs, drying our clothes by the fire; while John busied himself in broiling some bacon which we had brought with us. But our troubles had only yet begun; and I must indulge in some details of a night in the woods, for the benefit of "gentlemen who sit at home at ease." Our camp, which was nothing more than a shed of boughs open on the side toward the fire, promised a sufficient protection against the rain so long as the wind should blow from the right quarter; and an out-lying deer-stalker might have been content with our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] means and appliances for comfort during the night. Cheney, indeed, seemed perfectly satisfied as he watched the savoury slices which were to form our supper, steaming up from the coals. "Well," said the woodsman, "you see there's no place but what, if a man bestirs himself to do his best, he may find some comfort in it. Now, many's the time that I have been in the woods on a worse night than this, and, having no axe, nor nothing to make a fire with, have crept into a hollow log, and lay shivering till morning; but here, now, with such a fire as that---" As he spoke a sudden puff of wind drove the smoke from the green and wet timber full into our faces, and filled the shantee to a degree so stifling, that we all rushed out into the rain, that blew in blinding torrents against us. "Tormented lightning!" cried John, aghast at this new annoyance. "This is too pesky bad; but I can manage that smoke, if the wind doesn't blow from more than three quarters at a time." Seizing his axe upon the instant, he plunged into the darkness beyond the fire, and in a moment or two a large tree came crashing with all its leafy honours, bearing down with it two or three sapling to our feet. With the green boughs of these he made a wall around the fire to shut out the wind, leaving it open only on the side toward the shantee. The supper was now cooked without farther interruption. My friend was too ill to eat; but, though under some anxiety on his account, I did full justice to the culinary skill of our guide, and began to find some enjoyment amid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] all the discomfort of our situation. The recollection of similar scenes in other days gave a relish to the wildness of the present, and inspired that complacent feeling which a man of less active pursuits sometimes realizes when he finds that the sedentary habits of two or three years have not yet warped and destroyed the stirring tastes of his youth. We told stories and recounted adventures. I could speak of these northern hills from having, as a rollicking younker, enjoyed my best-remembered college vacations among the famous trouting lakes which bathe their western spurs; while the mountain-hunter listened with interest to the sporting scenes that I could describe to him upon the open plains of the far-west; though I found it impossible to make him understand how men could find their way in a new country where there were so few trees. With regard to the incidents and legends that I gathered in turn from him, I may hereafter enlighten the reader. But our discourse was suddenly cut short by a catastrophe which had nearly proved a very serious one. This was nothing more nor less than the piles of brush which encircled our fire to keep the wind away, suddenly kindling into a blaze, and for a moment or two threatening to consume our wigwam. The wind at the same time poured down the gorge in shifting, angry blasts, which whirled the flames in reeling eddies high into the air, bringing the gray cliffs into momentary light---touching the dark evergreens with a ruddy glow---and lighting up the stems of the pale birches, that looked like sheeted ghosts amid the surrounding gloom. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] A finishing touch of the elements was yet wanting to complete the agreeableness of our situation; and finally, just as the curtain of brush on the windward side of the fire was consumed, the cold rain changed into a flurry of snow, and the quickly-melted flakes were driven with the smoke into the innermost parts of our wigwam. Conversation was now out of the question. John did, indeed, struggle on with a panther story for a moment or two, and one or two attempts were made to joke upon our miserable situation; but sleet and smoke alternately damped and stifled every effort, and then all was still, except the roar of the elements. My sick friend must have passed a horrible night, as he woke me once or twice with his coughing; but I wrapped myself in my cloak, and, placing my mouth upon the ground, to avoid choking from the smoke, I was soon dreaming as quietly as if in a curtained chamber at home. The last words I heard John utter, as he coiled himself in a blanket, were--- "Well, it's one comfort, since it's taken on to blow so, I've cut down most of the trees around us that would be likely to fall and crush us during the night." The ringing of Cheney's axe was the first sound that met my ear in the morning, which broke excessively cold. The fire had burnt low, though frequently replenished by him during the night; and he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] was now engaged in renewing it, to cook our breakfast, which was soon ready, and for which the frosty mountain air gave me a keen appetite. The kind fellow, too, prepared some toast and a hot draught for my companion, whom nothing could prevent from farther exploring the pass. With this view we began descending a precipice in the rear of our camp, to a place called the ice-hole. The trees on the side of this precipice have a secret for growing peculiarly their own, or they could never flourish and maintain their place in such a position. The wall, some sixty or eighty feet high, and almost perpendicular, is covered with moss, which peels off in flakes of a yard square, as you plant your heels in it in descending; yet this flimsy substitute for soil supports a straggling growth of evergreens, that will bear the weight of a man as he clings to them to avoid being dashed to pieces in the glen below. The snow of the last night, which covered the mountain-tops, made the stems of these saplings so slippery and cold, that our hands became numb in grasping them before we were half-way down the descent. The river runs through the bottom of the ravine; but its passage is so cavernous, that it is only by letting yourself down into the fissures between the immense boulders, which are here wedged together in indescribable confusion, and crawling beneath the rocks, that you can obtain a sight of its current. From this chasm you view the sky as from the bottom of a well. A pair of eagles, that have their nest in the cliff above, showed like swallows as they hovered along its face. The sun never penetrates into this gloomy labyrinth; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] and here, unless the waters are unusually high, you may find cakes of ice at midsummer. Emerging from this wild chaos of rocks, we clambered a short distance up the sides of the glen, and penetrated a few hundred yards farther into the pass, to a sloping platform amid the rocks, where the finest view of the whole scene is to be obtained. And here, within a few yards of its first well-springs, you behold one of the strongest features of the mighty Hudson developed even in its birth. It has already cloven its way through a defile as difficult as that through which it rushes near West Point, and far more stupendous. A rocky precipice of twelve hundred feet rises immediately in front of you, and the jaws of the pass open barely wide enough to admit the egress of the stream at its highest stages of water. The cliff opposite looks raw and recent, as if riven through but yesterday; and ponderous blocks of stone, that would almost make mountains themselves, wrenched from their former seat, in what is now the centre of the pass, stand edgewise leaning down the glen, as if waiting some new throe of this convulsion of nature to sweep them farther on their terrific career. Many of these features of the place you have already seen while climbing to the point where we stand; but now, upon turning round as you gain the head of the pass, and look out from its bosom upon the mountain region below, a view of unequalled beauty and grandeur greets the eye. The morning sun, which will not for hours yet reach the place where you stand, is shining upon airy peaks and wooded hills which shoulder each other as far [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] as the eye can reach, while far down the glen, where the maple and beech find a more genial soil to nourish them, the rainbow hues of autumn are glistening along the stream, which, within a few miles of its fountain-head, has already expanded into a beautiful lake. The group of wild hills among which the Hudson rises, stands wholly detached from any other chain in North America. The highest peak of the Adirondachs, or the Black Mountains, as some call them, from the dark aspect which their sombre cedars and frowning cliffs give them at a distance, was measured during last summer, and found to be nearly six thousand feet in height. Mount Marcy, as it has been christened, after the public functionary who first suggested the survey of this interesting region, presents a perfect pyramidal top, when viewed from Lake Sandford. Its alpine climate is very different from that prevailing in the valleys below; and I observed its cone sheathed in snow one day, when I found the water temperate enough to enjoy swimming in the lake. The effect was equally beautiful and sublime. The frost had here and there flecked the forest with orange and vermilion, touching a single sumach or a clump of maples at long intervals; but generally the woods displayed as yet but few autumnal tints: and the deep verdure of the adjacent mountains set off the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] snowy peak in such high contrast, soaring, as it did, far above them, and seeming to pierce, as it were, the blue sky which curtained them, that the poetic Indian epithet of Ta-ha-wus ( he splits the sky ) was hardly too extravagant to characterize its peculiar grandeur. The ascent of Ta-ha-wus, or Mount Marcy, and the view from the summit, will hereafter puzzle many an abler pen than mine in the attempt to describe them. The wild falls of Kos-kong-shadi , ( broken water ,) the bright pools of Tu-ne-sas-sah , ( a place of pebbles  ,) and the tall cascade of She-gwi-en-daukwe , ( the hanging spear ,) will hereafter tempt many to strike over to the eastern branch of the Hudson, and follow it up to Lake Colden; while the echoing glen of Twen-un-ga-sko , ( a raised voice ,) though now as savage as the Indian Pass already described, will reverberate with more musical cries than the howl of the wolf or the panther, whose voices only are now raised to awaken its echoes. The luxurious cit will cool his champaign amid the snows of Mount Marcy; and his botanizing daughter, who has read in Michaux's American Sylva of pines some two hundred feet in height, will wonder to pluck full-grown trees of the same genus, which she can put into her reticule. At present, however, the mountain is a desert. Wolverines, lynxes, and wild cats, with a few ravens, who generally follow in the track of beasts of prey, are almost the only living things that have their habitations in these high solitudes; and, save when their occasional cry breaks the stillness, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] solemn woods are, on a calm day, as silent as the grave. The absence of game birds and of the beasts of chase, which give his subsistence to the hunter, prevents him from wasting his toil in climbing to the loftiest pinnacles: and, so far as I learned, it is only lately that curiosity has prompted those who have passed a great part of their lives in the neighbourhood, to make the ascent. The view, however, when once realized, seems to strike them not less than it does more cultivated minds. "It makes a man feel," said a hunter to me, "what it is to have all creation placed beneath his feet. There are woods there, over which it would take a life-time to hunt; mountains that seem shouldering each other up and away, heaven only knows where. Thousands of little lakes are let in among them. Old Champlain, though fifty miles off, glistens below you like a strip of white birch bark; and the Green Mountains of Vermont beyond it fade and fade away, till they disappear as gradually as a cold scent when the dew rises." The hunter, Holt, of whom I have before spoken, has had some strange encounters with wild animals among these lonely defiles which I have attempted to describe: and John Cheney had, some time since, a fight with a wolf, which is almost as well worthy of commemoration as the doughty feat of old Putman. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] It was in winter: the snows were some four or five feet deep upon a level; and the hunter, upon whom a change of seasons seems to produce but little effect, could only pursue his game upon snow-shoes; an ingenious contrivance for walking upon the surface, which, though so much used in our northern counties, is still only manufactured in perfection by the Indians, who drive quite a trade in them along the Canada border. Wandering far from the settlements, and making his bed at nightfall in a deep snow-bank, Cheney rose one morning to examine his traps, near which he will sometimes lie encamped for weeks in complete solitude; when, hovering round one of them, he discovered a famished wolf, who, unappalled by the presence of the hunter, retired only a few steps, and then, turning round, stood watching his movements. "I ought, by rights," quoth John, "to have waited for my dogs, who could not have been far off; but the creetur looked so sarcy, standing there, that, though I had not a bullet to spare, I couldn't help letting into him with my rifle." He missed his aim, the animal giving a spring as he was in the act of firing, and then turning instantly upon him before he could reload his piece. So effective was the unexpected attack of the wolf, that his forepaws were upon Cheney's snow-shoes before he could rally for the fight. The forester became entangled in the deep drift, and sank upon his back, keeping the wolf only at bay by striking at him with his clubbed rifle. The stock was broken to pieces in a few moments; and it would have fared ill with the stark woodsman, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] if the wolf, instead of making at his enemy's throat when he had him thus at disadvantage, had not, with blind fury, seized the barrel of the gun in his jaws. Still the fight was unequal, as John, half buried in the snow, could make use of but one of his hands. He shouted to his dogs; but one of them only, a young, untrained hound, made his appearance; emerging from a thicket, he caught sight of his master lying apparently at the mercy of the ravenous beast, uttered a yell of fear, and fled, howling, to the woods again. "Had I had one shot left," said Cheney, "I would have given it to that dog, instead of despatching the wolf with it." In the exasperation of the moment, John might have extended his contempt to the whole canine race, if a stancher friend had not opportunely interposed to vindicate their character for courage and fidelity. All this had passed in a moment: the wolf was still grinding the iron gun-barrel in his teeth; he had even once wrenched it from the hand of the hunter, when, dashing like a thunder-bolt between the combatants, the other hound sprang over his master's body, and seized the wolf by the throat. "There was no let go about that dog when he once took hold. If the barrel had been red-hot, the wolf couldn't have dropped it quicker; and it would have done you good, I tell ye, to see that old dog drag the creetur's head down in the snow, while I, jist at my leisure, drove the iron into his skull. One good, fair blow, though, with a heavy rifle-barrel, on the back of the head, finished him. The fellow gave a kind o' quiver, stretched out his hindlegs, and then [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] he was done for. I had the rifle stocked afterward, but she would never shoot straight after that fight; so I got me this pistol, which, being light and handy, enables me more conveniently to carry an axe upon my long tramps, and make myself comfortable in the woods." Many a deer has John since killed with that pistol. It is curious to see him draw it from the left pocket of his gray shooting-jacket, and bring down a partridge. I have myself witnessed several of his successful shots with this unpretending shooting-iron, and once saw him knock the feathers from a wild duck at eighty or a hundred yards. The deer-stalkers, or "still-hunters," as they are called in this part of the country, are very inveterate against those who hound the deer: for even in these woods, where you travel through twenty miles of unbroken forest in passing from house to house, people array themselves in factions, and indulge their animosities by acting in separate bodies with true partisan spirit. In fact, the deer-drivers and the still-hunters only want their poet or historian, to make their interminable bickerings as celebrated as those of the Guelphs and Ghibbelines, or any other redoubtable bone-breakers whose feudal "yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death." "What business has a man got in the woods," [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] quoth the still-hunter, "who can't take home a piece of venison to his shantee without scaring all the deer for ten miles around before he gets at it. The flesh of the poor creeturs is worth nothing neither, after their blood is heated by being driven to death with dogs." "How can a man sleep sound in the woods," saith John Cheney, on the other side, "when he has the heart to lure the mother of a fawn to the very muzzle of his rifle by bleating at her: or who has shot down the dumb brutes by torchlight, when they come to the water-side to cool themselves at nightfall? It ain't nateral, and such hunting---if hunting they call it---will never prosper." Honest John! whatever may be the merits of the question, he has reason to feel sore upon the subject, from the sad and ignoble death which the hound who played so gallant a part in his wolf encounter, met with at the hands of the still-hunters. Some of the best hounds in the country having been killed by these forest-regulators, Cheney would never allow his favourite dog to wander near the streams most frequented by them; but it chanced one day that the poor fellow met with an accident which withdrew his care from the dog. The trigger of his pistol caught against the thwart of a boat while he was in the act of raising it to shoot a deer, and the piece, going off in a perpendicular direction, sent the whole charge into his leg, tearing off the calf, and driving the ball out through the sole of his foot. With this terrible wound, which, however, did not prevent him from reloading and killing the deer [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] before he could swim to the shore, Cheney dragged himself fifteen miles through the woods, to the nearest log cabin. A violent fever, and the threatened loss of the limb, confined him here for months. But his dog, to whom, while idling in the forest, he had taught a hundred amusing tricks, was still his company and solace; and, though Tray looked wistfully after each hunter that strayed by the cabin, no eagerness for the chase could impel him to leave his master's side. At last, however, upon one unfortunate day, poor Cheney was prevailed upon to indulge a brother sportsman, and let him take the dog out with him for a few hours. The hunter soon returned, but the hound never came back. Under his master's eye, he had been taught never to follow a deer beyond a certain limit; but now long confinement had given him such a zest for the sport, that he crossed the fatal bounds. The mountain-ridge of a more friendly region was soon placed between him and his master; the deer took to the treacherous streams infested by the still-hunters, and the generous hound and his timorous quarry met the same fate from the rifles of their prowling enemy. " Crusting " is the term applied to taking large game amid the deep snows of winter, when the crust of ice which forms upon the surface after a slight rain is strong enough to support the weight of a man, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] but gives way at once to the hoofs of a moose or a deer; while the animal, thus embarrassed, is easily caught and despatched with clubs. In our northern states more game is destroyed in this way than in any other; and you may read in the newspapers every winter some account of the inhabitants of a whole village turning out and butchering hundreds of deer when thus entrapped. Only a few years since, it was said that more than a thousand were so destroyed in the township of Catskill in one season. All true sportsmen, however, hold "crusting deer" in contempt and abhorrence; for the venison is generally not in season at the time of year when it is thus procured; and this mode of taking it belongs rather to the butcher than to the hunter. Crusting moose is rather a different thing, as it requires both skill and courage on the part of the hunter, and the animal has a chance at least of escape or resistance. Still, as the law will not, or cannot, protect this noblest of all forest game from destruction in this manner, it must at no distant day become extinct within the boundaries of New York. The broad west has no moose ground so celebrated as that in our northern counties; and when you leave the sources of the Hudson, you must travel westward to those of the Mississippi before you find the gigantic moose as numerous as they were in our forests but a few years since. The woods of Maine, however, are probably richer in this noble game than any within the United States territories. The moose, who is both more shy and more sagacious than the deer, has his favourite haunts in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] depths of the forest. He moves about, not like the elk, in roving gangs, but stalks in lonely majesty through his leafy domains; and when disturbed by the hunter, instead of bounding away like his kinsman of the forest and prairie, he trots off at a gait which, though faster than that of the fleetest horse, is so easy and careless in its motion, that it seems to cost him no exertion. But, though retreating thus when pursued, he is one of the most terrible beasts of the forest when wounded and at bay; and the Indians of the north-west, among some tribes, celebrate the death of a bull-moose, when they are so fortunate as to kill one, with all the songs of triumph that they would raise over a conquered warrior. The deepest snows of winter of course offer the best occasion for moose-hunting. The sagacious animal, so soon as a heavy storm sets in, commences forming what is called a "moose-yard;" which is a large area, wherein he industriously tramples down the snow while it is falling, so as to have a space to move about in, and browse upon the branches of trees, without the necessity of wandering from place to place, struggling through the deep drifts, exposed to the wolves, who, being of lighter make, hold a carnival upon the deer in crusting-time. No wolf, however, dare enter a moose-yard. He will troop round and round upon the snow-bank which walls it, and his howling will, perhaps, bring two or three of his brethren to the spot, who will try to terrify the moose from his 'vantage ground, but dare not descend into it. But when the hunter, prowling about on his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] snow-shoes, discovers a moose-yard, he feels so sure of his quarry, that he will sometimes encamp upon the spot, in order to take the game at his leisure; and, when there have been several hunters in company, I have heard of their proceeding patiently to fell the neighbouring trees, and form a lofty fence around the yard, which enabled them to take the animal alive when subdued by long confinement and starvation. An opportunity of doing this occurred near M`Intyre last winter, when a yard with three moose in it, an old cow-moose and two yearlings, was discovered and surrounded by a band of hunters. Some of the party were desirous of taking them alive, as one of the proprietors of this extensive property---a gentleman of great public spirit---wishes to make an attempt to domesticate the animal, and, if possible, introduce the use of it to agricultural purposes. This is an exceedingly interesting and hardly doubtful experiment, for the moose has been frequently tamed, and, unlike the common deer, can be halter-broken as easily as a horse. The hunters, however, were too excited with their good luck to listen to any suggestion of the kind; few of them had ever killed a moose. Their rifles were in their hands, and they were bent upon having a shot at the game, which dashed to and fro, snorting and whistling, within the snowy bounds of the yard. The whoops and shouts of their enemies, redoubled by the echoes from the adjacent mountains, made them furious at being thus beset; and at each discharge of a gun they would plunge at the assailing marksman so desperately, that he would be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] compelled to take refuge behind the nearest tree. The scene became thus so exciting, that all order was lost among the huntsmen. Each fired as fast as he could load, hardly waiting to take aim, lest some quicker-sighted comrade should bear off the prize. The moose, though repeatedly wounded, would charge again and again into the snow-banks around them, and drive their enemies from the brink, retiring, at each turn, to a corner of the yard where they were least molested, and there rally at once for another charge. Faint with the loss of blood, however, they were successfully discomfited and borne down by the hunters, who, retreating upon the crust when pursued, would turn upon the moose the moment they tried to retrace their steps, and assail them with axes and bludgeons while floundering in the snow to recover the 'vantage ground of the yard. The two yearlings, with their dam, after making a most gallant resistance, were ultimately despatched. Such was the description which I had one day from a veteran hunter, while lying round a fire discussing a venison-steak cut from a fine buck, whose death had been compassed after the curious fashion described as follows. After a week of fine trout-fishing, alternated by such picturesque rambles as I have attempted to describe, we could not leave the sources of the Hudson without devoting our last day to a deer-hunt, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] which had only been hitherto deferred from Cheney's hounds being absent with a brother hunter. Taking an early breakfast, my friend and I, accompanied by John Cheney, another forester of the name of Linus Catlin, and our hospitable host, separated at the inlet of Lake Sandford, to take our different stations. Cheney, with three hounds, was to rouse the deer from his lair upon an adjacent mountain; Catlin was to take post in his skiff, behind one of the islets of the lake; and the rest of us were to watch in the canoe, under the shelter of a bold promontory, opposite to which the deer was expected to take the water. Before entering his boat, Catlin, who appeared to be one of those quiet fellows that say little and do much, having no gun with him, proceeded to cut down a birchen sapling, and strip it of all its branches except two, the elastic wood of which he twisted together, so as to form a large noose upon the end of the pole. As he was laying this weapon in the stern of his skiff, and preparing to push off, his preparations did not seem to meet the approbation of his friend, Cheney. "What, Linus, you are not agoing to withe the deer?" "And why not?" answered Catlin, taking his seat and placing the oars in the rowlocks. "Because I never see any good in withes: a man that can't tail a deer, oughtn't to hunt him." "Why, John, you couldn't hold a fat buck by his tail long enough to cut his throat with your hunting-knife." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] "Can't I? I'd like to see the time! Well, if I know'd I could never tail another, as I have thousands, the creetur might go, afore I'd be the man to drown him with a withe." The quiet Linus only replied by pushing off into the current and dropping down the stream; and we immediately followed, while Cheney, whistling to his dogs, plunged into the forest and disappeared. The boats kept near each other for some time, and we landed together upon a sunny point, to deposite a basket of bread and vegetables, an iron pot, and some other "kitchen fixins" which we had brought with us, under the confident promise of John that we should surely have a venison dinner in the woods that day, if he had to drive a dozen deer before we could kill one. Our craft being lightened of her lading, Catlin pulled for the islet, which was yet a mile off down the lake; and we, after watching his oars flashing in the sunshine for a few moments, embarked anew and paddled round a headland; when running the canoe under the trees, whose morning shadows still hung over the lake, we stretched ourselves upon the grass, listening and looking with the most eager attention for the first intimation of approaching sport. There was a slight ripple upon the lake, which was not favourable to our seeing the deer should he take the water at any great distance from us; and the incessant call of the jay, with the ever-changing cry of the loon, created so many noises in the woods generally so still, that the opening of the hounds might have escaped us unheard. These early [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] sounds, however, soon ceased as the sun came marching up above the mountain-tops, and spread the silver waves from the centre of the lake far and wide, into all its sheltered bays and wood-embowered friths. The faint ripple of the waters upon the rocky shore was the only murmur left. My companions were conversing in a subdued voice, and I was lying a little apart from them, revelling in the singular beauty of the scene, and sketching in imagination the peculiar outline of the "Dial Mountain" opposite, when I heard the faint crashing of a bough upon the other side of the lake, and, running my eye along the water, discovered a noble buck, with fine antlers, swimming beneath the bank. My comrades caught sight of him a moment afterward, and we all waited with eager anxiety to see him put out far enough for us to row round him and cut him off from the shore. But the buck had evidently no idea of making a traverse of the lake at this time. He was far in advance of the hounds, and had taken the water at this place, not from being hotly pursued, but only to throw them off the scent, and then double on his own track. He therefore kept swimming along the shore, close under the steep bank, looking up at it every now and then, as if in search of a "runway" which would carry him back again in the depths of the forest. This runway was in a little cove immediately opposite to us; and, though it was almost impossible now to cut him off from reaching it, yet the moment we saw his object we determined to make the effort. The position of each in the canoe had of course [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] been previously arranged; we accordingly crept into our seats, and pushed out into the lake, without making a sound that could attract the attention of the deer. The little islet of Inch-Hamish lay but a few yards out of our course, and we slid along as quietly as possible, until we could get under cover of this, and then gave way with all our strength. The lean craft glanced like an arrow through the rippling waters. We were all three familiar with the use of oar or paddle, and the buck would have had no chance of escape from that canoe had we been a hundred yards nearer. Our hopes were high in the brief moments that the islet shut him from view; but he had just reached the shore when we shot from its cover. We now threw up our paddles in despair, and paused to take a fair view of him as he escaped from the lake. It was beautiful to see him lift his arching neck from the water when he first touched the bottom; and his whole form was brought to view while he made a few steps through the shallow waves, as leisurely as if no pursuers were near. Throwing his antlers, then, upon his shoulders, to clear the boughs above him, he bounded over a fallen tree near the margin, and disappeared in the forest. Looking now to the point where he had entered the lake, we saw one of the hounds standing out on a rock, with nose uplifted to catch the vanished scent of his quarry. The dog saw us pulling for the runway, and, dashing into the lake, swam for the point to which we were steering, and reached it just as our boat grated upon the beach. A moment sufficed to put him again upon the scent. He opened [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] with a joyous yell; his mouthing soon became deeper and more distant; it neared again; and the two other hounds, who, while following some other trail, had now, for the first time, struck his, joined in the chorus. The echoes in the upper part of the lake are the finest that I ever heard; and, as the morning breeze had now lulled, they were all awakened by this wild music. The deer was evidently making for the inlet; and, indeed, before we could pull out far enough to command a view of the point where be would probably cross, he had made the traverse, and we only caught a glimpse of the dogs thrashing through the wild grass upon a tongue of land upon the opposite side of the inlet. "You may give up that buck," said our host; "he has gone over to Lake Henderson, and the best thing we can do is, to start another." Almost as he spoke a clear whoop rang through the forest, and soon after we saw John Cheney waving us to the shore we had just left. "Tormented lightning! what are ye doing there, when the deer is going down the lake?" "Down! why, he has just crossed at the upper end, and gone over to Lake Henderson." "I tell you he hasn't. No deer will go there when the water's so high that he would be entangled in the bushes before he could swim beyond his depth. I know the natur of the creetur; and that deer has gone round the lower end of the lake, to cross back to the mountain where I started him." With these words Cheney waded into the water without waiting for us to approach nearer the shore, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] jumped into the canoe, seized a paddle, and away we sped again over the waves. The event proved that he was right. The buck, after crossing at the inlet, made a circuit of a mile or two, and, before we could pull half-way down the lake, took the water at a runway opposite to the islet behind which Catlin was watching in his skiff. Cool and experienced in the sport, this hunter never broke his cover until the deer got fairly out into the lake, when he launched out and turned him so quickly, that the buck made for the island which his pursuer had just left. Linus, however, was too quick for him, and threw his withe over the deer's antlers before he could touch the bottom with his feet. But the buck was a fellow of great weight and vigour; and, feeling himself thus entangled, he made a lateral spring into deeper water, which dragged the hunter out of the boat in an instant. Linus fortunately seized one of the oars, which, being rigged with swivels instead of rowlocks, still kept him connected with the skiff. But his situation was a very precarious one; the buck becoming the assailant, struck at him with his forefeet, and got him again fairly under water. He rose this time, however, with the oar between himself and his antagonist, and, while clutching the gunwale of the boat with one hand, seized the withe, which had escaped from his grasp, in the same moment that the buck made a pass at him with his horns, which ripped up the bosom of his shirt, and was within an inch of goring him to death. But before the desperate animal could repeat the thrust, the hunter had gained [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] the skiff, now half-full of water, and, seizing the first missile that came to hand, he dealt the buck a blow upon the head, which, followed up by a slash from his hunting-knife, put an end to the encounter. The conflict was over before we could reach the combatants; but the carcass was still warm when we relieved the leaky boat of Catlin by lifting the buck into our canoe; and his eye was so bright, his skin so smooth and glossy, and his limbs, not yet stiffened in death, folded so easily beneath him, that it was difficult to imagine life had departed. When we landed at the spot before selected, it required the united strength of the whole party to lift the buck up the steep bank, and suspend him upon the timbers, which Cheney prepared, secundum artem  , for scientific butchery. The eloquent Bucklaw, by whose learned discourse upon this branch of "the gentle science of venerie" the reader has been enlightened when reading Scott's "Bride of Lammermoor," could not have been a more thorough practitioner of the art than John Cheney. A group worthy of Inman's pencil was collected around the roaring fire, by which the dripping Catlin was drying himself; while Cheney, with the fat buck before him, and the dogs licking the blood at his feet, as ever and anon he paused in his operation, and turned round to us to point out some graceful line of fat with his hunting-knife, would have formed the prominent figure of the picture. The potatoes, in the meantime, were roasted whole, or sliced up with various savoury matters, which were put into the kettle to boil; and, though [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] we had omitted to bring tumblers with us, Cheney's axe hollowed out and fashioned some most ingenious drinking-cups, which were ready by the time divers choice morsels of venison had been grilled upon the coals. There were a few drops at the bottom of an old flask of cogniac for each of us; we had Mackinaw blankets stretched upon balsam branches, to recline upon; there was no call of duty or business to remind us of the lapse of hours; and stories and anecdotes of former huntings in these mountains, with practical discussions as to what part of a deer afforded the most savoury venison, prolonged the repast till sunset. The haunch of the buck, wrapped in its clean skin, was left untouched for future feasting. "Well, John," said I, as I tried in vain to lift it into the boat by the short, fat tail, "how could you ever have taken such a fellow as this by `tailing him,' as you call it?" "It's all knack---it's being used to the thing u nly. Not but that I always said that withing is a good way." "No, no, John!" we all exclaimed; "you said just the reverse." "Well, perhaps I did, and, without meaning to discredit Linus, who, for certain, has been the man among us this day, I still say that withing only does for those that don't know how to tail a deer. And now let's take the old hounds in the boats, and pull homeward." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] The hunters with whom we had enjoyed our last day's sport upon Lake Sandford, accompanied us some forty miles through the woods, when we started next day upon our homeward journey. John Cheney, like the rest, trudging along on foot, found an opportunity of shooting several partridges by the way, picking them from the trees with his pistol with as much case as an ordinary sportsman could have effected with a fowling-piece, (admitting the thick cover to give the bird such a chance of life as to warrant a sportsman to take him sitting.) After killing three or four partridges, however, John could not be prevailed on to shoot at more. I several times called his attention to a good shot, but he always answered, shaking his head, "It's wrong, it's wrong, sir, to use up life in that way; here's birds enough for them that wants to eat them; and that saddle of venison on the buckboard will only be wasted, if I kill more of these poor things." About noon we halted by a brook which ran through the forest near a clump of maples which grew so widely apart as to let the sunshine down upon a grassy spot, where we spread our table upon a fallen tree, and, kindling a fire, proceeded to cook our dinner. All found something to do while this was in preparation; one attended to the comfort of the horses, another kept the fire supplied with fuel, some shot at a mark with Cheney's pistol, while worthy John himself watched with the most [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] sedulous care over the venison and partridges, which he roasted after a fashion peculiarly his own, and which, with four or five large trout that we had brought from the lake, and the customary accompaniment of roast potatoes and wheaten bread, all being flavoured with good humour and keen mountain appetites, made the repast a delicious one. The day was fine, the air clear and remarkably bland for the season, and I don't know how long we should have protracted our woodland revel, as Cheney exercised his skill and ingenuity, serving up every moment some tempting morsel of venison, pressing my friend and myself particularly to eat, as "we didn't know when again we might have a raal nateral dinner in the woods; and it was a comfort to him to see gentlemen from the city take things in the woods as if they liked them." No town-adoring cockney, nor patriotic villager, nor proud Castellan could imagine himself more identified with all the honours and glory of his distinct and especial dwelling-place, than does this genuine forester with everything that appertains to the broad woods through which he ranges. Cheney was now, as he told me when walking by my side after resuming our journey, going out of the woods for the first time in many months, to visit his father, who lived some sixty miles off. He was very old, and John had not seen nor heard from him for some time previously to his last visit to the settlements which we were now approaching, and from which his father lived still another day's journey distant. He seemed quite anxious as to the tidings he might [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] hear about his venerable parent, and talked of remaining to spend a month with him. Such was the complexion of the hunter's feelings when we came out of the forest at nightfall upon what is called the Schroon-road, where we found a good inn to receive us. Here my friend and I, after securing a conveyance which should enable us to follow down the course of the Hudson instead of returning home through Lake Champlain, invited Cheney to take a seat in our wagon, which would carry him some thirty miles on his next day's journey. He was so eager to see his father, that the proffer was at once accepted, and all our mutual arrangements were completed for the morrow. But just as we were on the point of starting, and had shaken hands with our hearty host of M`Intyre and his party, Cheney was hailed by a brother hunter, who, rifle on shoulder, trudged up to the inn-door upon the road we were about to travel. "Hullo, Bill!" cried the filial John, advancing to shake hands with him. "Come up from Ti, eh? and how's the old man?" "Right well, I tell ye," replied Bill; "he's killed six bear this fall; and, thinking the creeturs must be pretty well routed out among our mountains, I've struck over the ridge to see what I can find among your'n." "Tormented lightning! six bear!" quoth John. "Why, the raal old chap; his grain is as tough and springy as ever. Well, Bill, if you'll hold on till I can speak a word to these gentlemen in the wagon, I'll turn round with you, and back into our woods again." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] Saying this, cheney came up to us, and repeating what we had just overheard as the reason for changing his intentions, he shook hands with us, and we parted upon our separate journeys. We reached Lake George that night, our road winding side by side with the Hudson for many miles, passing several picturesque lakes, crossing mountain-ridges commanding the most superb bird's eye views, or descending into valleys where the painter might find an ever-varying novelty for the exercise of his art. But as the reader is perhaps already fatigued with these loose sketches, and as the prominent figure which gave them animation has disappeared from the scene, I will here conclude my notes upon The Sources of the Hudson .

The reminiscences which follow, dating many years back, have less pretension to authenticity: nor, indeed, has the writer, in attempting to illustrate the rich scenic and legendary resources of the state of New York, aimed at more than weaving a mingled yarn of fact and fiction. His object being rather to commend those resources to more diligent hands, than accurately to develope them by any labour of his own. The reader, therefore, may give just as much credence to the remaining contents of these volumes as he finds it most agreeable to attach to them.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] I HAVE wandered about "considerably" in my time---some five or six thousand miles perhaps--- over the northern parts of the Union on either side of the mountains, and all for the sake of seeing Nature in what poets call "her wild retreats:" of beholding her in those unmolested fastnesses where, like a decorous female, as she is, she may freak it about in dishabille without being subjected to that abashing scrutiny which always awaits her when architects and landscape-gardeners assist at her toilet in those places where wealth compels her sometimes to hold her court. Like all the rest of her sex, she is capricious enough in her choice of what she likes, and leads her admirers many an idle dance with but slight reward; while her choicest favours often await him who stumbles upon her at her retiring moments, in spots where he would least expect such good fortune. Certes, I have never found her more propitious than within a day's journey of Saratoga, among lakes, mountains, and forests; where, notwithstanding the vicinity of one of the gayest haunts of dissipation, my only rivals for her favours were a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] sportsman or two, who had stumbled upon these retreats as I did. [3] It was many years since when in early youth I went upon my first hunting excursion in that unsettled region about the sources of the Sacondaga River, generally known as "Totten and Crossfield's Purchase," never in very great repute at land-offices, and selling at that time for sixpence an acre; "the Sacondaga Country," as it was called, being, most unjustly, as noted for barrenness as "the Genesee County" was famed for fertility. The deer, at the time of which I write, were so abundant that they were often destroyed by the few settlers for their skins alone; and wolves, and bears, and panthers prowled the thick forest unmolested, save by a few Indians who once or twice throughout the year would straggle in from the Iroquois reservation on the Canadian frontier. This district (a debateable territory between the Iroquois of New York, and the Hurons and Adirondachs of Canada) was in old times a favourite hunting-ground of the Mohawks. The greater part of this warlike tribe, soon after the Revolution, migrated with their famous leader, Brant, to Upper Canada: but a number long lingered around the ancient seats of their people; and the salmon-trout, which abound in all the head-waters of the Hudson, would still sometimes tempt a straggling Mohawk thither at the spearing season in July; while the moose, which is even now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] occasionally shot in this district, used generally to lure them thither in the winter season. There was one old Mohawk, yclept Captain Gill, who alone kept there all the year round, and was a sort of sylvan sultan of the whole region about. His daughter, Molly Gill, who led a kind of oyster life (though no one would have mistaken her for a peri) in their wigwam on the outlet of Lake Pleasant, used to make his moccasins, gum the seams, sew up the rips of his birchen canoe, and dress his venison for him, while the captain roved far and near in search of whatever might cheer the home enlivened by these two only inmates---a tender fawn cutlet, a trinket sent by some good-natured settler to Molly, or a stoup of vile whiskey secreted in the captain's hunting-pouch for his especial refreshment and delight. Gill, notwithstanding this unhallowed league with bad spirits, was a capital guide upon sporting excursions whenever the larger kinds of game were the object; and a college chum, whom we called "The Counsellor," from his having just entered on the study of the law, took as much pleasure as myself in wandering about among the mountains, or cruising from lake to lake, and camping out on their banks, with the old Mohawk for our decus et tutamen . A hunting-party of Iroquois Indians from St. Regis was at that time in the country; and, uniting with these, we turned out a pretty stout band upon our principal excursions; our company being often strengthened by a queer original, hight Major Jake Peabody, and several other white hunters that may still be living somewhere along that border. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] As I took no notes of our different "tramps," it is impossible now to trace their various routes through rocky glens and over sagging morasses, amid the labyrinth of lakes that are linked together by innumerable streams and waterfalls among these mountains; and I may be sufficiently inaccurate while trying to recall some of the tales and anecdotes with which our party used to while away the evenings between the hours of making our camp-fire and the moment of retiring to repose: but neither shall prevent me from attempting to sketch some of these scenes from recollection, and relating the legends with which they are associated, as I now remember them. Embarking one morning on a small lake called Konjimuc by the Indians, we entered its outlet, and floated many hours down a stream scarcely a pistolshot in breadth, where, from the rapidity of the current, the steering-paddle alone was necessary to keep our canoes on their course. The brook wound generally through a wooded morass, where the dense overhanging foliage excluded even a glimpse of the neighbouring mountains; at times, however, it would sweep near enough to their bank to wash a wall of granite, from which the hanging birch and hemlock would fling their branches far over the limpid tide; and then again it would expand into a broad, deep pool, circled with water-lilies, and animated by large flocks of wild-fowl that would rise, screaming, from the black tarn as we glided out from the shadow of the forest and skimmed over its smooth surface. Innumerable streams, the inlets and outlets of other lakes, mingled their waters in these [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] frequently-occurring ponds; and about sunset we struck one so broad that we determined to change our course, and, heading our shallops now against the current, we soon found ourselves upon the outlet of a considerable lake. The water gradually became deeper and more sluggish, and then a pull of a few hundred yards, with a sudden turn in the forest, shot us out upon one of the most beautiful sheets of water I ever beheld. It was about four miles in length, with perhaps half that breadth; the shores curved with the most picturesque irregularity, and swelled high, but gradually, from the water; while their graceful slopes were held in strong contrast by a single islet which shot up in one bold cliff from the centre, and nodded with a crown of pines, around which an eagle was at that moment wheeling. There were then, I believe, but two farms upon the banks of Lake Pleasant, a couple of small "clearings" on the brows of opposite promontories, each covered with grain-fields, whose brown stubble smiled in the light of the setting sun---the only cultivated spots in an unbroken wilderness. Everywhere else the untamed forest threw its dusky shadow over the lake, while beneath the pendant branches, which in some instances swept the wave, a beach as white as the snowy strand of the ocean glistened around the clear blue water. The sun was setting in heavy, though gorgeous clouds, which at each moment lost some of their brightness in a volume of vapour that rolled along the mountains; and, by the time we reached the upper end of the lake, the broad drops that began to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] descend warned us to hurry on our course and gain a shelter from the coming storm. We had reached the inlet of the lake, which was only a narrow, crooked strait, a few hundred rods in length, connecting it with another sheet of water that covered about the same surface as that over which we had passed; the promontory between affording, as I afterward experienced, a commanding view of both the sister lakes. Our destination was the farthest side of the upper lake, and the management of a canoe was no boy's play when we left the sheltered strait and launched out upon the stormy water. The shores were bold and rocky, and, as the wind had now risen to a tempest, the waves beat furiously upon them. The rain blew in blinding sheets against us, and it was almost impossible, while urging our way in its teeth, to keep our canoes from falling off into the trough of the sea; in which case they would inevitably have been swamped. Our flotilla was soon separated and dispersed in the darkness. A pack of hounds had been distributed among the different boats, and some of the younger dogs, alarmed by the shouting and confusion, would raise a piteous howl at parting company with the rest. We called long to each other as the lightning from time to time revealed a boat still within hail; but our voices were at last only echoed by the dismal wailing of the loon, whose shriek always rises above the storm, and may be heard for miles amid its wildest raging. The night was far spent before we all again united at our place of destination; the different boats straggling in one by one so slowly, that they who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] first arrived passed an hour in great anxiety for the fate of the last that made a harbour. Sacondaga, the lake we were on, the fountain-head of the river of that name, is shaped, as an Indian hunter phrased it, "like a bear's paw spread out, with an island between the ball of each toe;" [4] and the different bays and islets, resembling each other to an unpractised eye, might, on a dark night, mislead even the skilful voyageur in making any given point on the shore: more than one of our canoes must have coasted the greater part of it before they were all successively drawn up on the beach at the place we had fixed on for our rendezvous. "God's weather! but this is quite a night," quoth Major Jake, peering out upon the storm which was still raging an hour afterward. "Yes; I may say that the Flying Head is abroad to-night," replied the old Mohawk, in good round English, as he lighted his pipe and looked contentedly around the bark shantee, wherein each of our company, having cheered himself with a hearty supper of dried venison, was lounging about the fire in every variety of attitude. The remark seemed to attract the attention of no one but myself; but when I asked the speaker to explain its meaning, my mongrel companions eagerly united in a request that "the captain would tell them all about the varmint of which he spoke, be it painter (panther) or devil." Gill did not long hesitate to comply; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] the particulars, not to mention the phraseology of his narrative, in the years that have since elapsed, have almost escaped me; and I may fail, therefore, in preserving the Indian character of the story while trying to recall it here. [3] The mountains of "the Sacondaga Country" are the western spurs of the Adirondach group. In general the peaks of Hamilton County are less lofty and broken than those of Esser. [4] It is called "Round Lake" by the land surveyors, probably quasi lucus ,  &c. [ A Legend of Sacondaga Lake .] "The Great God hath sent us signs in the sky! we have heard uncommon noise in the Heavens, and have seen HEADS fall down upon the earth!" Speech of Tahayadoris, a Mohawk sachem, at Albany, Oct.  25 th , 1689. \--- Colden's Five Nations . It hath tell-tale tongues;---this casing air That walls us in---and their wandering breath Will whisper the horror everywhere, That clings to that ruthless deed of death. And a vengeful eye from the gory tide Will open, to blast the parricide. The country about the head-waters of the great Mohegan, (as the Hudson is sometimes called,) though abounding in game and fish, was never, in the recollection of the oldest Indians living, nor in that of their fathers' farthers, the permanent residence of any one tribe. From the black mountain tarns, where the eastern fork takes its rise, to the silver strand of Lake Pleasant, through which the western branch makes its way after rising in Sacondaga Lake, the wilderness that intervenes, and all the mountains round about the fountain-heads of the great river, have, from time immemorial, been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] infested by a class of beings with whom no good man would ever wish to come in contact. The young men of the Mohawk have, indeed, often traversed it, when, in years gone by, they went on the war-path after the hostile tribes of the north; and the scattered and wandering remnants of their people, with an occasional hunting-party from the degenerate bands that survive at St. Regis, will yet occasionally be tempted over these haunted grounds in quest of the game that still finds a refuge in that mountain region. The evil shapes that were formerly so troublesome to the red hunter, seem, in these later days, to have become less restless at his presence; and, whether it be that the day of their power has gone by, or that their vindictiveness has relented at witnessing the fate which seems to be universally overtaking the people whom they once delighted to persecute---certain it is, that the few Indians who now find their way to this part of the country are never molested, except by the white settlers who are slowly extending their clearings among the wild hills of the north. The " Flying Head ," which is supposed to have first driven the original possessors of these hunting-grounds, whosoever they were, from their homes, and which, as long as tradition runneth back, in the old day before the whites came hither, guarded them from the occupancy of every neighbouring tribe, has not been seen for many years by any credible witness, though there are those who insist that it has more than once appeared to them, hovering, as their fathers used to describe it, over the lake in which it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] first had its birth. The existence of this fearful monster, however, has never been disputed. Rude representations of it are still occasionally met with in the crude designs of those degenerate aborigines who earn a scant subsistence by making birchen baskets and ornamented pouches for such travellers as are curious in their manufacture of wampum and porcupine quills; and the origin and history of the Flying Head survives, while even the name of the tribe whose crimes first called it into existence has passed away for ever. It was a season of great severity with that forgotten people whose council-fires were lighted on the mountain promontory that divides Sacondaga from the sister lake into which it discharges itself. [5] A long and severe winter, with but little snow, had killed the herbage at its roots, and the moose and deer had trooped off to the more luxuriant pastures along the Mohawk, whither the hunters of the hills dared not follow them. The fishing, too, failed; and the famine became so devouring among the mountains, that whole families, who had no hunters to provide for them, perished outright. The young men would no longer throw the slender product of the chase into the common stock, and the women and children had to maintain life as well as they could upon the roots and berries the woods afforded them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] The sufferings of the tribe became at length so galling, that the young and enterprising began to talk of migrating from the ancient seat of their people; and, as it was impossible, surrounded as they were by hostile tribes, merely to shift their hunting-grounds for a season and return to them at some more auspicious period, it was proposed that if they could effect a secret march to the great lake off to the west of them, they should launch their canoes upon Ontario, and all move away to a new home beyond its broad waters. The wild rice, of which some had been brought into their country by a runner from a distant nation, would, they thought, support them in their perilous voyage along the shores of the great water, where it grows in such profusion; and they believed that, once safely beyond the lake, it would be easy enough to find a new home abounding in game upon those flowery plains which, as they had heard, lay like one immense garden beyond the chain of inland seas. The old men of the tribe were indignant at the bare suggestion of leaving the bright streams and sheltered valleys, amid which their spring-time of life had passed so happily. They doubted the existence of the garden regions of which their children spoke; and they thought that if there were indeed such a country, it was madness to attempt to reach it in the way proposed. They said, too, that the famine was as courge which the Master of Life inflicted upon his people for their crimes; that if its pains were endured with the constancy and firmness that became warriors, the visitation would soon pass away; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] that those who fled from it would only war with their destiny, and that chastisement would follow them, in some shape, wheresoever they might flee. Finally, they added that they would rather perish by inches on their native hills---they would rather die that moment, than leave them for ever, to revel in plenty upon stranger plains. "Be it so; they have spoken!" exclaimed a fierce and insolent youth, springing to his feet and casting a furious glance around the council as the aged chief, who had thus addressed it, resumed his seat. "Be the dotard's words their own, my brothers; let them die for the crimes they have even now acknowledged. We know of none; our unsullied summers have nothing to blush for. It is they that have drawn this curse upon our people: it is for them that our vitals are consuming with anguish, while our strength wastes away in the search of sustenance we cannot find; or which, when found, we are compelled to share with those for whose misdeeds the Great Spirit hath placed it far from us. They have spoken---let them die. Let them die, if we are to remain to appease the angry Spirit; and the food that now keeps life lingering in their shrivelled and useless carcases, may then nerve the limbs of our young hunters, or keep our children from perishing. Let them die, if we are to move hence, for their presence will but bring a curse upon our path: their worn-out frames will give way upon the march; and the raven that hovers over their corses will guide our enemies to the spot, and scent them like wolves upon our trail. Let them die, my brothers; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] and, because they are still our tribesmen, let us give them the death of warriors, and that before we leave this ground." And with these words the young barbarian, pealing forth a ferocious whoop, buried his tomahawk in the head of the old man nearest to him. The infernal yell was echoed on every side; a dozen flint hatchets were instantly raised by as many remorseless arms, and the massacre was wrought before one of those thus horribly sacrificed could interpose a plea of mercy. But for mercy they would not have pleaded, had opportunity been afforded them; for even in the moment that intervened between the cruel sentence and its execution, they managed to show that stern resignation to the decrees of fate which an Indian warrior ever exhibits when death is near; and each of the seven old men that perished thus barbarously, drew his wolf-skin mantle around his shoulders and nodded his head, as if inviting the death-blow that followed. The parricidal deed was done! and it now became a question how to dispose of the remains of those whose lamp of life, while twinkling in the socket, had been thus fearfully quenched for ever. The act, though said to have been of not unfrequent occurrence among certain Indian tribes at similar exigencies, was one utterly abhorrent to the nature of most of our aborigines; who, from their earliest years, are taught the deepest veneration for the aged. In the present instance, likewise, it had been so outrageous a perversion of their customary views of duty among this simple people, that it was thought [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] but proper to dispense with their wonted mode of sepulture, and dispose of the victims of famine and fanaticism in some peculiar manner. They wished in some way to sanctify the deed, by offering up the bodies of the slaughtered to the Master of Life, and that without dishonouring the dead. It was, therefore, agreed to decapitate the bodies and burn them; and as the nobler part could not, when thus dissevered, be buried with the usual forms, it was determined to sink the heads together to the bottom of the lake. The soulless trunks were accordingly consumed and the ashes scattered to the winds. The heads were then deposited singly, in separate canoes, which were pulled off in a kind of procession from the shore. The young chief who had suggested the bloody scene of the sacrifice, rowed in advance, in order to designate the spot where they were to disburden themselves of their gory freight. Resting then upon his oars, he received each head in succession from his companions, and proceeded to tie them together by their scalp-locks, in order to sink the whole, with a huge stone, to the bottom. But the vengeance of the Master of Life overtook the wretch before his horrid office was accomplished; for no sooner did he receive the last head into his canoe than it began to sink, his feet became entangled in the hideous chain he had been knotting together, and, before his horror-stricken companions could come to his rescue, he was dragged, shrieking, to the bottom. The others waited not to see the water settle over him, but pulled with their whole strength for the shore. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] The morning dawned calmly upon that unhallowed water, which seemed at first to show no traces of the deed it had witnessed the night before. But gradually, as the sun rose up higher, a few gory bubbles appeared to float over one smooth and turbid spot, which the breeze never crisped into a ripple. The parricides sat on the bank watching it all the day; but sluggish, as at first, that sullen blot upon the fresh blue surface still remained. Another day passed over their heads, and the thick stain was yet there. On the third day the floating slime took a greener hue, as if coloured by the festering mass beneath; but coarse fibres of darker dye marbled its surface; and on the fourth day these began to tremble along the water like weeds growing from the bottom, or the long tresses of a woman's scalp floating in a pool when no wind disturbs it. The fifth morning came, and the conscience-striken watchers thought that the spreading-scalp---for such now all agreed it was---had raised itself from the water, and become rounded at the top, as if there were a head beneath it. Some thought, too, that they could discover a pair of hideous eyes glaring beneath the dripping locks. They looked on the sixth, and there indeed was a monstrous HEAD floating upon the surface, as if anchored to the spot, around which the water---notwithstanding a blast which swept the lake---was calm and motionless as ever. Those bad Indians then wished to fly; but the doomed parricides had not now the courage to encounter the warlike bands through which they must [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] make their way in fleeing from their native valley. They thought, too, that, as nothing about the head, except the eyes, had motion, it could not harm them, resting quietly, as it did, upon the bosom of the waters. And, though it was dreadful to have that hideous gaze fixed for ever upon their dwellings, yet they thought that if the Master of Life meant this as an expiation for their phensied deed, they would strive to live on beneath those unearthly glances without shrinking or complaint. But a strange alteration had taken place in the floating head on the morning of the seventh day. A pair of broad wings, ribbed, like those of a bat, and with claws appended to each tendon, had grown out during the night; and, buoyed up by these, it seemed to be now resting on the water. The water itself appeared, to ripple more briskly near it, as if joyous that it was about to be relieved of its unnatural burden; but still for hours the head maintained its first position, At last the wind began to rise, and, driving through the trough of the waves, beneath their expanded membrane, raised the wings from the surface, and seemed for the first time to endow them with vitality. They flapped harshly once or twice upon the billows, and the head rose slowly and heavily from the lake. An agony of fear seized upon the gazing parricides, but the supernatural creation made no movement to injure them. It only remained balancing itself over the lake, and casting a shadow from its wings that wrapped the valley in gloom. But dreadful was it beneath their withering shade to watch [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] that terrific monster, hovering like a falcon for the stoop, and know not upon what victim it might descend. It was then that they who had sown the gory seed from which it sprung to life, with one impulse sought to escape its presence by flight. Herding together like a troop of deer when the panther is prowling by, they rushed in a body from the scene. But the flapping of the demon pinions was soon heard behind them, and the winged head was hence-forth on their track wheresoever it led. In vain did they cross one mountain barrier after another, plunge into the rocky gorge, or thread the mazy swamp, to escape their fiendish watcher. The Flying Head would rise on tireless wings over the loftiest summit, or dart in arrowy flight through the narrowest passages without furling its pinions: while their sullen threshing would be heard even in those vine-webbed thickets where the little ground bird can scarcely make its way, The very caverns of the earth were no protection to the parricides from its presence; for scarcely would they think they had found a refuge in some sparry cell, when, poised midway between the ceiling and the floor, they would behold the Flying Head glaring upon them. Sleeping or waking, the monster was ever near; they paused to rest, but the rushing of its wings, as it swept around their resting-place in never-ending circles, prevented them from finding forgetfulness in repose; or if, in spite of those blighting pinions that ever fanned them, fatigue did at moments plunge them in uneasy slumbers, the glances of the Flying Head would pierce their very eyelids, and steep their dreams in horror. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] What was the ultimate fate of that band of parricides, no one has ever known. Some say that the Master of Life kept them always young, in order that their capability of suffering might never wear out; and these insist that the Flying Head is still pursuing them over the great prairies of the far-west. Others aver that the glances of the Flying Head turned each of them gradually into stone; and these say that their forms, though altered by the wearing of the rains in the lapse of long years, may still be recognised in those upright rocks which stand like human figures along the shores of some of the neighbouring lakes; though most Indians have another way of accounting for these figures. Certain it is, however, that the Flying Head always comes back to this part of the country about the times of the equinox; and some say even that you may always hear the flapping of its wings whenever such a storm as that we have just weathered is brewing. The old hunter had finished his story; but my companions were still anxious that he should protract the narrative, and give us the account of the grotesque forms to which he had alluded as being found among these hills. These, however, he told us more properly belonged to another legend, which he subsequently related, and which I may hereafter endeavour to recall. It was a tale of certain STONE GIANTS that were invulnerable to the weapons of the Iroquois. I remember well that it struck me at the time as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] favouring the wild theory of some writers, that De Soto ascended the Ohio, and penetrated with his mailed followers into western New York. Since then, however, I have thought that the singular tradition might refer to that memorable invasion of European Musqueteers and Men-at-arms led on by French knights and noblemen, which is commemorated in the following story: [5] A hamlet is now growing up on this beautiful mountain slope, and the scenery in the vicinity is likely to be soon better known, from the late establishment of a line of post-coaches between Sacondaga Lake and Saratoga Springs. The American reader, if at all curious about the early history of his country, has probably heard of that famous expedition undertaken by the vicegerent of Louis XIV., the governor-general of New France, against the confederated Six-Nations of New York; an expedition which, though it carried with it all the pomp and circumstances of European warfare into their wild wood haunts, was attended with no adequate results, and had but a momentary effect in quelling the spirit of the tameless Iroquois. It was on the 4th of July, 1796, that the commander-in-chief, the veteran Count de Frontenac, marshalled the forces at La Chine, with which he intended to crush for ever the powers of the Aganuschion confederacy. His regulars were divided into four battalions, of two hundred men each, commanded respectively by three veteran leaders, and the young Chevalier de Grais. He formed also four battalions of Canadian volunteers, efficiently officered, and organized as regular troops. The Indian [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] allies were divided into three bands, each of which was placed under the command of a nobleman of rank, who had gained distinction in the European warfare of France. One was composed of the Sault and St. Louis bands and of friendly Abenaquis; another consisted of the Hurons of Lorette and the mountaineers of the north; the third band was smaller, and composed indiscriminately of warriors of different tribes, whom a spirit of adventure led to embark upon the expedition. They were chiefly Ottawas, Saukies, and Adirondachs, and these the Baron de Bekancourt charged himself to conduct. This formidable armament was amply provisioned, and provided with all the munitions of war. Besides pikes, harquebusses, and other small arms then in use, they were furnished with grenades, a mortar to throw them, and a couple of field-pieces, which, with the tents and other camp equipage, were transported in large batteaux built for the purpose. Nor was the energy of their movements unworthy of this brilliant preparation. Ascending the St. Lawrence, and coasting the shores of Lake Ontario, they entered the Oswego River, cut a military road around the falls, and, carrying their transports over the portage, launched them anew, and finally debouched with their whole flotilla upon the waters of Onondago Lake. It must have been a gallant sight to behold the warlike pageant floating beneath the primitive forest which then crowned the hills around that lovely water. To see the veterans who had served under Turenne, Vauban, and the great Conde, marshalled with pike and cuirass beside the half-naked Huron [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] and Abenaquis; while the young cavaliers, in the less warlike garb of the court of the magnificent Louis, moved with plume and mantle amid the dusky files of wampum-decked Ottawas and Algonquins. Banners were there which had flown at Steenkirk and Landen; or rustled above the troop-ers that Luxemburgh's trumpets had guided to glory, when Prince Waldeck's battalions were borne down beneath his furious charge. Nor was the enemy that this gallant host were seeking unworthy of those whose swords had been tried in some of the most celebrated fields of Europe. "The Romans of America," as the Six-Nations have been called by more than one writer, had proved themselves soldiers, not only by carrying their arms among the native tribes a thousand miles away, and striking their enemies alike upon the lakes of Maine, the mountains and morasses of Carolina, the cane-brakes of Kentucky, [6] and the prairies of the Missouri; but they had already bearded one European army beneath the walls of Quebec, and shut up another for weeks within the defences of Montreal, with the same courage that, half a century later, vanquished the battalions of Dieskau upon the banks of Lake George. Our business, however, is not with the main [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] movements of this army, which we have already mentioned were wholly unimportant in their results. The aged Chevalier de Frontenac was said to have other objects in view besides the political motives for the expedition, which he set forth to his master, the Grand Monarque. Many years previously, when the Six-Nations had invested the capital of New France and threatened the extermination of that thriving colony, a beautiful half-blood girl, whose education had been commenced under the immediate auspices of the governor-general, and in whom, indeed, M. de Frontenac was said to have a parental interest, was carried off, with other prisoners, by the retiring foe. Every effort had been made in vain during the occasional cessation of hostilities between the French and the Iroquois, to recover this child; and though, in the years that intervened, some wandering Jesuit from time to time averred that he had seen the Christian captive living as the contented wife of a young Mohawk warrior, yet the old nobleman seems never to have despaired of reclaiming his "nut-brown daughter." Indeed, the chevalier must have been impelled by some such hope when, at the age of seventy, and so feeble that he was half the time carried in a litter, he ventured to encounter the perils of an American wilderness, and place himself at the head of the heterogeneous bands which now invaded the country of the Six-Nations under his conduct. Among the half-breed spies, border scouts, and mongrel adventurers that followed in the train of the invading army, was a renegade Fleming, of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] name of Hanyost. This man in early youth had been made a sergeant-major, when he deserted to the French ranks in Flanders. He had subsequently taken up a military grant in Canada, sold it after emigrating, and then, making his way down to the Dutch settlements on the Hndson, had become domiciliated, as it were, among their allies, the Mohawks, and adopted the life of a hunter. Hanyost, hearing that his old friends, the French, were making such a formidable descent, did not now hesitate to desert his more recent acquaintances; but offered his services as a guide to Count de Frontenac the moment he entered the hostile country. It was not, however, mere cupidity, or the habitual love of treachery, which actuated the base Fleming in this instance. Hanyost, in a difficulty with an Indian trapper, which had been referred for abitrament to the young Mohawk chief, Kiodago, (a settler of disputes,) whose cool courage and firmness fully entitled him to so distinguished a name, conceived himself aggrieved by the award which had been given against him. The scorn with which the arbitrator met his charge of unfairness, stung him to the soul, and, fearing the arm of the powerful savage, he had nursed the revenge in secret, whose accomplishment seemed now at hand. Kiodago, ignorant of the hostile force which had entered his country, was off with his band at a fishing station or summer-camp, among the wild hills about Konnedieyu; [7] and, when Hanyost informed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] the commander of the French forces that, by surprising this party, his long-lost daughter, the wife of Kiodago, might be once more given to his arms, a small, but efficient, force was instantly detached from the main body of the army, to strike the blow. A dozen musqueteers, with twenty-five pikemen, led severally by the Baron de Bekancourt and the Chevalier de Grais, the former having the chief command of the expedition, were sent upon this duty, with Hanyost to guide them to the village of Kiodago. Many hours were consumed upon the march, as the soldiers were not yet habituated to the wilderness; but just before dawn on the second day, the party found themselves in the neighbourhood of the Indian village. The place was wrapped in repose, and the two cavaliers trusted that the surprise would be so complete, that their commandant's daughter must certainly be taken. The baron, after a careful examination of the hilly passes, determined to head the onslaught, while his companion in arms, with Hanyost to mark out his prey, should pounce upon the chieftain's wife. This being arranged, their followers were warned not to injure the female captives while cutting their defenders to pieces; and then, a moment being allowed for each man to take a last look at the condition of his arms, they were led to the attack. The inhabitants of the fated village, secure in their isolated situation, aloof from the war parties of that wild district, had neglected all precaution against surprise, and were buried in sleep when the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] whizzing of a grenade, that terrible, but now superseded, engine of destruction, roused them from their slumbers. The missile, to which a direction had been given that carried it in a direct line through the main row of wigwams which formed the little street, went crashing among their frail frames of basket-work, and kindled the dry mats stretched over them into instant flames. And then, as the startled warriors leaped all naked and unarmed from their blazing lodges, the French pikemen, waiting only for a volley from the musqueteers, followed it up with a charge still more fatal. The wretched savages were slaughtered like sheep in the shambles. Some, overwhelmed with dismay, sank unresisting upon the ground, and, covering up their heads after the Indian fashion when resigned to death, awaited the fatal stroke without a murmur; others, seized with a less benumbing panic, sought safety in flight, and rushed upon the pikes that lined the forest's paths around them. Many there were, however, who, schooled to scenes as dreadful, acquitted themselves like warriors. Snatching their weapons from the greedy flames, they sprang with irresistible fury upon the bristling files of pikemen. Their heavy war-clubs beat down and splintered the fragile spears of the Europeans, whose corslets, ruddy with the reflected fires mid which they fought, glinted back still brighter sparks from the hatchets of flint which crashed against them. The fierce veterans pealed the charging cry of many a well-fought field in other climes; but wild and high the Indian whoop rose, shrill above the conflict, until the hovering raven in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] mid air caught up, and answered, that discordant shriek. De Grais in the meantime surveyed the scene of action with eager intentness, expecting each moment to see the paler features of the Christian captive among the dusky females who ever and anon sprang shrieking from the blazing lodges, and were instantly hurled backward into the flames by fathers and brothers, who even thus would save them from the hands that vainly essayed to grasp their distracted forms. The Mohawks began now to wage a more successful resistance; and just when the fight was raging hottest, and the high-spirited Frenchman, beginning to despair of his prey, was about launching into the midst of it, he saw a tall warrior who had hitherto been forward in the conflict, disengage himself from the melee, and, wheeling suddenly upon a soldier, who had likewise separated from his party, brain him with a tomahawk before he could make a movement in his defence. The quick eye of the young chevalier, too, caught a glance of another figure, in pursuit of whom as she emerged, with an infant in her arms, from a lodge on the farther side of the village, the luckless Frenchman had met his doom. It was the Christian captive, the wife of Kiodago, beneath whose hand he had fallen. That chieftain now stood over the body of his victim, brandishing a war-club which he had snatched from a dying Indian near. Quick as thought, De Grais levelled a pistol at his head, when the track of the flying girl brought her directly in his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] line of sight, and he withheld his fire. Kiodago in the meantime had been cut off from the rest of his people by the soldiers, who closed in upon the space which his terrible arm had a moment before kept open. A cry of agony escaped the high-souled savage, as he saw how thus the last hope was lost. He made a gesture, as if about to rush again into the fray, and sacrifice his life with his tribesmen; and then, perceiving how futile must be the act, he turned upon his heel, and bounded after his retreating wife with arms outstretched, to shield her from the dropping shots of the enemy. The uprising sun had now lighted up the scene; but all this passed so instantaneously, that it was impossible for De Grais to keep his eye on the fugitives amid the shifting forms that glanced continually before him; and when, accompanied by Hanyost and seven others, he had got fairly in pursuit, Kiodago, who still kept behind his wife, was far in advance of the chevalier and his party. Her forest training had made the Christian captive as fleet of foot as an Indian maiden. She heard, too, the cheering voice of her loved warrior behind her, and, pressing her infant in her arms, she urged her flight over crag and fell, and soon reached the head of a rocky pass, which it would take some moments for any but an American forester to scale. But the indefatigable Frenchmen are urging their way up the steep; the cry of pursuit grows nearer as they catch a sight of her husband through the thickets, and the agonized wife finds her onward progress prevented by a ledge of rock that impends [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] above her. But now again Kiodago is by her side; he has lifted his wife to the cliff above, and placed her infant in her arms; and already, with renewed activity, the Indian mother is speeding on to a cavern among the hills, well known as a fastness of safety. Kiodago looked a moment after her retreating figure, and then coolly swung himself to the ledge which commanded the pass. He might now easily have escaped his pursuers; but as he stepped back from the edge of the cliff, and looked down the narrow ravine, the vengeful spirit of the red man was too strong within him to allow such an opportunity of striking a blow to escape. His tomahawk and war-club had both been lost in the strife, but he still carried at his back a more efficient weapon in the hands of so keen a hunter. There were but three arrows in his quiver, and the Mohawk was determined to have the life of an enemy for each of them. His bow was strung quickly, but with as much coolness as if there were no exigency to require haste. Yet he had scarcely time to throw himself upon his breast, a few yards from the brink of the declevity, before one of his pursuers, more active than the rest, exposed himself to the unerring archer. He came leaping from rock to rock, and had nearly reached the head of the glen, when, pierced through and through by one of Kiodago's arrows, he toppled from the crags, and rolled, clutching the leaves in his death-agony, among the tangled furze below. A second met a similar fate, and a third victim would probably have been added, if a shot from the fusil [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] of Hanyost, who sprang forward and caught sight of the Indian just as the first man fell, had not disabled the thumb-joint of the bold archer, even as he fixed his last arrow in the string. Resistance seemed now at an end, and Kiodago again betook himself to flight. Yet anxious to divert the pursuit from his wife, the young chieftain pealed a yell of defiance, as he retreated in a different direction from that which she had taken. The whoop was answered by a simultaneous shout and rush on the part of the whites; but the Indian had not advanced far before he perceived that the pursuing party, now reduced to six, had divided, and that three only followed him. He had recognised the scout, Hanyost, among his enemies, and it was now apparent that the wily traitor, instead of being misled by his ruse , had guided the other three upon the direct trail to the cavern which the Christian captive had taken. Quick as thought, the Mohawk acted upon the impression. Making a few steps within a thicket, still to mislead his present pursuers, he bounded across a mountain torrent, and then, leaving his foot-marks dashed in the yielding bank, he turned shortly on a rock beyond, recrossed the stream, and concealed himself behind a fallen tree, while his pursuers passed within a few paces of his covert. A broken hillock now only divided the chief from the point to which he had directed his wife by another route, and to which the remaining party, consisting of De Grais, Hanyost, and a French musqueteer, were hotly urging their way. The hunted warrior ground his teeth with rage when he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] heard the voice of the treacherous Fleming in the glen below him; and, springing from crag to crag, he circled the rocky knoll, and planted his foot by the roots of a blasted oak that shot its limbs above the cavern just as his wife had reached the spot, and, pressing her babe to her bosom, sank exhausted among the flowers that waved in the moist breath of the cave. It chanced that at that very instant De Grais and his followers had paused beneath the opposite side of the knoll, from whose broken surface the foot of the flying Indian had disengaged a stone, which, crackling among the branches, found its way through a slight ravine into the glen below. The two Frenchmen stood in doubt for a moment. The musqueteer, pointing in the direction whence the stone had rolled, turned to receive the order of his officer. The chevalier, who had made one step in advance of a broad rock between them, leaned upon it, pistol in hand, half turning toward his follower; while the scout, who stood farthest out from the steep bank, bending forward to discover the mouth of the cave, must have caught a glimpse of the sinking female just as the shadowy form of her husband was displayed above her. God help thee now, bold archer! thy quiver is empty; thy game of life is nearly up; the sleuth-hound is upon thee; and thy scalp-lock, whose plumes now flutter in the breeze, will soon be twined in the fingers of the vengeful renegade! Thy wife---But hold! the noble savage has still one arrow left! Disabled as he thought himself, the Mohawk had not dropped his bow in his flight. His last arrow [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] was still griped in his bleeding fingers; and, though his stiffened thumb forbore the use of it to the best advantage, the hand of Kiodago had not yet lost its power. [8] The crisis which it takes so long to describe, had been realized by him in an instant. He saw how the Frenchmen, inexperienced in woodcraft, were at fault; he saw, too, that the keen eye of Hanyost had caught sight of the object of their pursuit, and that farther flight was hopeless; while the scene of his burning village in the distance inflamed him with hate and fury toward the instrument of his misfortunes. Bracing one knee upon the flinty rock, while the muscles of the other swelled as if the whole energies of his body were collected in that single effort, Kiodago aims at the treacherous scout, and the twanging bow-string dismisses his last arrow upon its errand. The hand of The Spirit could alone have guided that shaft. It misses its mark! But Waneyo smiles upon the brave warrior, and the arrow, while it rattles harmless against the cuirass of the French officer, glances toward the victim for whom it was intended, and quivers in the heart of Hanyost! The dying wretch grasped the sword-chain of the chevalier, whose corslet clanged among the rocks as the two went rolling down the glen together; and De Grais was not unwilling to abandon the pursuit, when the musqueteer, coming to his assistance, had disengaged him, bruised and bloody, from the embrace of the stiffening corpse! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] The rest is soon told. The bewildered Europeans rejoined their comrades, who were soon after on their march from the scene they had desolated; while Kiodago descended from his eyrie to collect the fugitive survivers of his band, and, after burying the slain, to wreak a terrible vengeance upon their murderers; the most of whom were cut off by him before they joined the main body of the French army. The Count de Frontenac, returning to Canada, died soon afterward, and the existence of his half-blood daughter was forgotten. And though among the score of old families in the state of New York who have Indian blood in their veins, many trace their descent from the offspring of the noble Kiodago and his Christian wife, yet the hand of genius, as displayed in the admirable picture of Chapman, has alone rescued from oblivion the thrilling scene of the Mohawk's Last Arrow ! The storm of the last night had not subsided on the morrow, and Major Peabody proclaimed, authoritatively, that it was folly to leave our comfortable quarters in such weather. The major presented a singular appearance as I first viewed him engaged in taking an observation, when I awakened in the morning. Being in his stocking-feet, he had avoided the disagreeableness of stepping upon the wet ground without the shantee to study the elements, by raising his tall body erect upon the place where he had slept, and thrusting his head through the bark roof much after the fashion of a man in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] pillory. Hearing his voice on the outside of the wigwam, I had stepped through the doorway without observing his lean and Quixotic figure within: and when this lantern-jawed countenance, reposing, as it were, upon the roof, first met my eyes, I rubbed them in doubt whether the Flying Head of which I had heard the night before was not yet bewildering my senses. Our party generally was disposed to abide by the counsels of Major Jake, and remain within doors, amusing themselves by putting their various hunting accoutrements in order for the morrow. One or two, however, went off to catch some lake-trout for our dinner; and as the Indians philosophically got rid of a rainy day by sleeping like hounds before the fire, the major had but a small audience, when, after calling in vain for another Iroquois legend to amuse us, my friend and I prevailed upon him to relate the principal adventures of his own life, which he did in nearly the following words: [6] The Dark and Bloody Ground" of Kentucky, though generally supposed to be so called from the slaughter of its white pioneers, dates its name from a much earlier period; when the Iroquois, lured thither by the abundant game, would descend the Ohio in their canoes, and battle with the hostile tribes of the Lower Mississippi. [7] Since corrupted into "Canada creek,"---Beautiful water; probably so called from its amber colour---now Trenton Falls. [8] The European mode of holding the arrow is not common among our aborigines, who use the thumb for a purchase. For earthly goods he cared not more, because He went to work to carve his proper share From out the common stock, as coolly as You would a morsel from a pippin pare. A shrewd, but wild and wayward chap he was; Cautious, but danger ready still to dare (If by it he could rise or win) on field or flood; A pedler even of his heart's best blood! " You mustn't think, because you're hear'n me [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] called major by all the folks round the country, that I'm much stuck up by the title, for it's only a militia one, which, you know, is not of much account to a man who has once been a breveted captain in the regular service. This, however, is neither here nor there; for, though I have worn Uncle Sam's livery for some years, and smelt gunpowder upon more than one occasion---ay, and killed my man too, in a duel---yet natur never meant me for an officer. I never took to the thing in the best of times, and I never now can account for my luck in getting an epaulet on my shoulder, and being thought the fire-eater, which some of my old comrades will describe to you when you ask them about Jake Peabody. But this again is neither here nor there; let me begin with the commencement of my story, which, when it tires you, you will please to interrupt just as you please. "I was born in Albany, in Old York state, in a small house, which is, perhaps, still standing at the north end, down by Fox Creek. My father was a Connecticut horse-doctor, or, as he more politely styled himself in latter years, a veterinary surgeon. My mother was born of Yankee parents, in Rensselaer County; but she was the widow of an old Dutchman up in the colonie when my father took her to wife, and stepped into mynheer's property along the creek. "Being the youngest son, I came into the world after my father had got his head pretty well above water, and had, therefore, greater advantages of ed i cation than the rest of my family. The old gentleman, who took particular delight in being [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] addressed as Doctor Peabody, hoped that the son who bore his name might some day turn out a real M.D.; and, as the first step toward such a consummation, I was taken from the academy when a boy of eleven, and placed in a druggist's shop. "The person to whom I was apprenticed kept his office upon the water-side, near the skirts of the town, where, what with keel-boatmen from the Mohawk, Schenectady teamsters, Sacondaga raftsmen, and an occasional North River skipper for customers, he contrived to drive a pretty brisk trade in certain medicines, and initiate his pupil in a branch of practice which had a wonderful tendency to give me an insight into what, in larger cities, is called `life.' You will not wonder, therefore, that, in exchange for the vegetable and mineral nostrums, which it was my duty to vend to our customers, I readily imbibed a moral poison, hardly less pernicious; nor that I was sent a packing by my bos before I was fifteen, because he had discovered that I was too old to continue longer the playmate of his daughter Nautie, and he knew not how otherwise to break off an intercourse which had ripened into too great familiarity. "I was in no want of friends, however. My father, indeed, was dead; and, my mother having taken unto herself a third helpmate, my brothers troubled themselves but little about such a scapegrace as they considered me. But among raftsmen and skippers I was favourably known; and one of the latter readily took me on board of a coasting schooner, until something better should offer. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] "Our first voyage from Albany was to a port in Long Island Sound, whither the skipper was bound with a cargo of shingles. Here I met with a Connecticut medicine pedler, who was about starting to Georgia with a large supply of a patent carminative, of which he attempted to force some sales among our crew. This fellow conceived a fancy for me from the moment I exposed his quackery, and was very solicitous to employ so cute a lad, as he called me, in the manufacture of an article which I seemed to understand so well. But I declined his overtures, from having higher things in view. The truth is, upon our first landing at the place I had seen a newspaper in the bar-room of an inn, which set my ambition all on fire. It was an advertisement, which ran as follows: " `To young gentlemen wishing to travel--- " `A middle-aged gentleman, engaged in an agreeable and lucrative business, which leads him to take extensive tours over various parts of the Union, is desirous of a young and intelligent companion, whose duties would be merely nominal, and who, in forming a most improving connexion, would have an opportunity of visiting the most interesting cities and towns of the United States, without incurring a particle of expense. Applicants for the situation will address Viator , at this office; and none but young gentleman of the first respectability need apply.' "You may think me presumptuous in preferring a claim to such a place; but, nevertheless, I immediately answered the advertisement by asking an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] interview with Viator at such time and place as he should choose to designate. I confess I thought that I was attempting a pretty high flight, and, therefore, kept my hopes and schemes to myself. Indeed, it required all the ingenuity of the pedler, who thought I must have some prospect in view, from so peremptorily declining his offer---it required all his skill, I say, to worm my real purpose out of me. I did, however, communicate it to him, and you may judge of my surprise when, upon my telling him that I hourly expected an answer to my note, he produced it from his pocket, and, quietly announcing himself as the `middle-aged gentleman' with whom I had been treating anonymously, added, that there was now no difficulty in at once arranging matters. The first castle in the air I had ever built was thus demolished in a moment. But I suppressed the mortification of my feelings; and, having now made up my mind to see the world in some way or other, I closed at once with the overtures of the pedler. The connexion, it is true, did not elevate me in the world, but it might open the means of rising. "I passed two or three years in travelling with this man through the south-western states: he was frugal, kind, and considerate, and of the most scrupulous honesty in every respect, save where the disposal of his patent medicine was concerned; and I verily believe that he would have sold a bottle of this to his best friend, though the use of it might destroy the purchaser in an hour afterward. With regard to me, he exhibited ever the care of a father, until his stock in trade becoming one day exhausted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] while at a thriving village in East Tennesee, I became exceedingly ill shortly afterward, and had good reason to believe that my worthy master had induced the sickness by experiments upon me with some simples, from which he hoped to prepare a new compound that might enable him to supply his customers. I kept the suspicion to myself, however; and, after seeing some fifty persons in the neighbourhood hurried off by what in that country is called the milk-sickness---whose worst symptoms, by the by, were always aggravated by the vegetable remedies which my associate exhibited---we decamped one night, and took our way along the mountain-ridge which enters Virginia not far north of this point. But here I and my master were doomed to part company, in a way that makes us unlikely to meet again in the United States. "A disbanded regulator of the Georgia guard, with a Lynch-ing corn-cracker from that state, accompanied by a couple of enterprising counterfeiters lately thrown out of employ in Kentucky, had scented the contents of my master's saddle-bags, and dogged our steps to the wild mountain-passes about the Cumberland Gap. Here, in a woody ravine, to which we had withdrawn to take our noonday meal, apart from the dust of the highway and the heat of the sun, these worthies joined our society in a way which, to say the least of it, was exceedingly abrupt. The first intimation of their presence was a couple of shots, which killed the pedler's fine Kentucky horse, and wounded my Indian tackey. The latter was a tough and spirited [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] little animal, for which I had exchanged a broken-down nag while passing through the Creek nation. He was not wounded so badly, however, but that he bore me quickly out of danger when I leaped upon his back as the robbers rushed from the bushes upon the unarmed pedler. "I have often since believed that my patron might have escaped the dreadful fate which overtook him a few moments afterward, if he had kept a quiet tongue between his teeth; but his Connecticut notions of justice impelled him to mutter something about the law of highway robbery when he saw the plump saddle-bags which his legs had so often caressed, in the possession of the freebooters. There was then but a brief parley, the words of which I could not make out, though I still hovered near, having secured my pony in a thicket: its purport, though, was soon apparent. They seized the pedler, and, reckless of his cries, dragged him up a rocky hill, thick-set with bushes, to the mouth of one of those lime-stone caverns with which this part of the country abounds. Here they paused for a moment, but not to listen to the passionate pleadings for liberty, which were redoubled by the victim; who, however, seemed to anticipate nothing more than confinement in so dreary a place. " `Strike a light, Jim,' cried one, who appeared to be the leader. " `You don't want no light,' said the other; `it's not far from the mouth, and Angus, who has been in a dozen times, can take your hand and guide you.' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] "At the word, a carroty-headed fellow stepped forward, and, taking the hand of the leader, moved in advance as his pioneer, while the two assisted him in dragging the pedler within the cave. The mouth was thick-grown with tall weeds, and much obscured with fallen boughs and brush of one kind or another, which had from time to time accumulated over it. Supple and active, I did not hesitate to worm my way through this screen, and penetrate into the dark region beyond, which once gained, I knew I must be safe. The struggles and outcry of the pedler prevented the robbers from observing any rustling I might make in moving through the thicket beside them, and I gained the cover of the cavern before their forms had wholly darkened the entrance. The pedler did not struggle much as they pushed and dragged him through the passage; indeed, he seemed rather to catch at their garments, lest they should suddenly retrace their steps and close up the entrance; and he besought them, in the most piteous terms, not to imprison him in the vault without a chance of escape. " `I shall starve---I shall certainly starve in this cavern! For God's sake, if you would murder me by inches, gentlemen, let me be tied to a tree, and die in the light of day!' "He spoke; but his pleadings did not for an instant defer a fate more appalling than any he yet anticipated: a fate which Providence alone prevented me from sharing, as the nearness of the ruffians now was all that hindered me from penetrating farther into the cavern, when my instant doom would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] have been that which was intended only for my poor patron. But, fearful of my footfalls being heard, I remained still; placing my body in a cleft of the rock, while the whole party groped their way along the wall, so near to me that, while by a miracle they failed to touch me, it seemed as if the beatings of my heart must have been audible. They paused within two yards in advance of where I stood. " `Are we near it, Angus?" cried the captain. " `Hand me a stone, and I'll try; or do you chuck one before me from where you stand.' "The stone was thrown. It seemed long in coming to the earth, but at last, after one or two rebounds, which sounded hollowly against the sides of a deep pit, it reached its destination, and the last faint echo seemed to rise from beneath the very spot were we were standing. " `By G---d!' cried the ruffian pioneer, `I am on the brink of the precipice myself; one step more, and I should have pulled you all to h---l along with me! Stand exactly where you are, Captain; and you and Humphrey take the Yankee nigger by his shoulders. Jim, do you move this way---step carefully though, G---d d---mn you, and seize the other leg.' " `Ah, I take the idea.' " `Are you all ready?' said the captain, when the victim was secured in the manner indicated, and swung like a pendulum between the four; `have you got a fair hold, Jim?' "Yes---but we'd better yet have a light; my place here in front is cursed pokerish.' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] "The suggestion awakened the hope of a moment's respite in the pedler's bosom. " `Yes, a light---a light in the name of Jesus the merciful, gentlemen! let me look on my death! let me see your faces! Ye are changed into fiends, are ye, since we came into this horrible place! I cannot---I will not---I---' Here his struggles became so violent that I lost the rest that he said. A burst of merriment, that rung like the laughter of demons through the vault, told that this last effort for liberty was fruitless; and, overcome with exhaustion, he lay, panting, upon the floor of the cavern. " `Now for a game of Alligator, Jim.' " `As quick as you please, Captain; he'll launch easily, now, if you'll give the word at once.' " `Lift,' said the captain. " `All up,' was the answer. " `Now, then, together, boys.' " `One to make ready.' " `Two to show.' " `Three to make ready.' " `And four to g---o!' "A hideous yell of more than mortal agony drowned the last word. To give force to the heave, they had swung the pedler's body so far back the fourth time, that the hair of his head actually grazed my body. The cry of his parting soul seemed to spring at first from my own bosom; it swelled to its highest pitch in the moment that he was launched over the brink of the abyss; and it died away in a hissing moan a thousand feet below me. A dull [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] reverberation from the falling body followed, and then all was still. " `Well, Yankee, you'll tell no tales,' said the ruffian called Humphrey, who had not before spoken, and who seemed more of a novice at such business than the others. The party then left the cavern in silence, as if the affair, once despatched, was not worth an afterthought. I stood for some time transfixed with horror. The whole scene had passed amid total darkness, the dropping vault of the cavern near the entrance not allowing the light of day to penetrate thus far into these now accursed chambers; and I felt like one who had intruded upon some doings of the damned, deep within the bowels of the earth. At last, moved by better feelings, reckless whether or not any of the gang might hear me, if still loitering about the place, I shouted to my ill-fated friend, as the idea flashed across me that life might possibly yet linger in his mutilated form. I screamed to him at the top of my voice, and a dismal howl seemed to answer from the gulf; I shrieked again, but heard only, as before, the same fearful echo to my own voice. The place had been turned into a grave, and that gives no reply. A superstitious terror seized upon me; I felt as if something were dragging me backward to that horrid chasm, and, groping anxiously till I met a ray of light from the entrance of the cavern, I rushed from it in an agony of fear, the bitterest I have ever known. "The land pirates had disappeared, without molesting my tackey, who soon carried me to a safer region farther east. Abingdon, in Washington [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] County, Virginia, was the first place where I ventured to stop and seek employment. The valley used to be a beautiful green basin among the hills in those days; and here the principal hotel being in want of a bar-keeper, I was glad to fill a station, among people who knew nothing about me, which, at the same time that it was comfortable in itself, gave me an opportunity of mixing, after a fashion, with all the young bucks and politicians. There were, too, at that time, many of your real old-fashioned Virginny gentlemen in Abingdon; good fellows, who wouldn't disdain to hold a chat with a white man while mixing a julep, though he did stand behind a bar. Well, during all the two years I was there, I never let out where I came from, nor where I was going to. Jacobs was the name I bore, and under this name I used to mingle with all sorts of people during court-week, and pick up something about books and manners, which has served my turn ever since. For you may depend, that a man can never play gentleman well, unless he has served some sort of apprenticeship to it; and that, I take it, is the reason why in our northern cities, where fortunes are made so quick, you so often see servants better bred than their masters. Well, after I had laid up a little money, and learned how your quality folk conduct themselves toward each other, I left Abingdon, and made my way to Charleston, on the Kenhawa, where I fitted myself out with some new clothes, and took my passage in a salt-boat to Cincinnati. Here I provided myself with a pair of saddle-bags, and a stock of medicines to fill them, crossed over [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] into Kentucky, and bought a good horse at George-town, and then, returning to Ohio, took up my line of march for the interior. "Now, it chanced that about this time the breaking out of the war had brought some levies of western volunteers and drafted militia, on their way to the frontier, to the village of Urbanna, where I had put up, announcing myself as Dr. Peabody. Well, most of the officers were real harem-scarem fellows; they seemed to be marching in loose detachments, loitering from day to day for the baggage to come up, and drinking confusion every night to those in authority, who had as yet not even made any medical provision for so large a body of men. Indeed, disease had already broken out among them, from robbing the orchards as they came along; and during a halt of three days I made myself so useful and agreeable, in prescribing for the sick and frolicking with the well, that by the time the general and his staff came up with the fourth regiment of infantry, who joined us at this point, every officer had signed a paper, which I soon set afloat, recommending me as an army surgeon. And, in fact, soon after I received a demi-official appointment as assistant-surgeon of the drafted forces. I was already mounted, and my blue coat was soon converted into a uniform, by clapping a collar of black velvet on it, and sticking a button on either side. I appropriated the sword of a dead drummer as my fee for easing him off handsomely during an attack of cholera morbus, which compelled him to beat his last tattoo: and now Surgeon Peabody, who was already a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] favourite with the officers, could ruffle it with the best of them. My tavern experience had given me a knowledge of the kitchen, which made my services highly valued by some of the old cocks in catering for the mess; and I had a sort of knowledge of life, which took mightily with the younkers. "The presence of so large a body of regulars infused something like discipline into our ranks, and our men reached the Miami of the lakes in such good condition, that I began to have quite an opinion of my medical skill; when my talents as a surgeon were put to their first proof in a way that took the conceit out of me a little. "I was one day holding a pleasant talk with a militia colonel, who rode at the head of his division, when I was suddenly called to the rear, to look after a man that had been accidentally shot through the arm by a fellow-volunteer, who, to exhibit at once his soldiery discipline and skill as a marksman, had discharged his rifle across the face of the platoon in which he was marching, at a squirrel that was skipping along a log by the road-side. The wounded man was sitting upon the log when I reached the spot, and all so covered with blood, that I could hardly find the place of his hurt. Not knowing exactly how to treat a gunshot wound, I still thought common sense dictated that the first thing to be done was to plug up the hole which the bullet had made, and I therefore tried very hard to fill it with a pledget of tow; but all my squeezing and pushing only made the blood flow the faster; the tow was forced out as fast as I stuck it in, and at last I saw [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] that nothing could be done until I had got this effusion of blood under. I had more than once assisted my old masters at ordinary bleedings, and had sometimes helped to tie the bandages afterward: and these, I remembered, always stopped the flow of blood from the veins, by being tied below the venesection; and God forgive me! but I never dreamed of there being such a thing as an artery, much less did I know anything of the circulation of the blood when I clapped a tourniquet below the wound, upon that poor fellow's arm. He bled like an ox; and, seeing that I could do nothing to stop it, I told his friends, who had left the ranks to gather round him, that he was mortally wounded, and beyond the reach of surgery. I helped to place him upon a smooth stump, that he might go off with some comfort, and felt mightily relieved at the kind manner in which he welcomed his fate; especially when I used to think afterward of the tomahawking upon the River Raisin, which he thus escaped. The last thing I heard him say, before I left him to his friends, and resumed my place in the line, was addressed to the man that shot him, in these terms: `Well, Evert, don't be cast down now, because you've done for me; I'll allow it was a nation bad shot at the squirrel, and that's enough to make you feel ugly; but as for your hitting me, why, that was all along of my bad luck; only tell the old man that I died game. Kiss Nan for me, and take good care of my mare; poor creetur, she'll break her legs between some of these cursed logs, afore the campaign's ove---r.' The last word was uttered with a sort of hiccough, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] and the backwoodsman fainted, never to revive again, as they told me afterward. "My next case was rather more fortunate, being taken off my hands before I could enter fairly upon its treatment. I had been left in the rear with some sick men, who, as soon as convalescent, joined a company of Ohio volunteers, who, under the command of Captain Brush, had arrived at the River Raisin with- supplies for the army. Major Van Horn, you may remember, was sent with a detachment from Detroit to escort Brush's company to head-quarters, but was used up by Tecumseh, near Brownstown, before he could join us. A larger force was, therefore, sent to perform this duty; and when I learned from a scout that Colonel Miller, with three hundred regulars of the gallant 4th, the old Tippecanoe regiment, was marching toward us, I volunteered to push through the woods and warn him that Major Muir of the Britishers was waiting for him at Magagua, with a large force of Indians and regulars. Making a circuit through the woods, I reached Muir's position just as Captain Snelling, who commanded the American advance, had entered the ambuscade, and the Indians broke their cover. The red-skins had a cool chap to deal with in Snelling. The painted devils came yelling upon him as if they had their fingers already twisted in the scalps of his men. But---Lord, it's pleasant to see regulars fight--- why, Snelling did not even think it worth while to fall back on the main body. His little corps there kept its ground until Miller came up, and made the British regulars, who had moved to the support of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] the Indians, give way before his solid charge; i'faith, it was Greek meeting Greek. There are no troops better with the bayonet than the British, but Miller is just the fellow to lead men of blood as good as theirs. The battle, though, was not yet over. Tecumseh drew off his Indians to the woods on each side of our people, and fought from tree to tree, and bush to bush, as if he meant to make each inch of ground his last halting-place. The British regulars rallied with desperate rivalry of their Indian allies; and then came a sight I have never seen but that once, though they tell me the same thing happened at Bridgewater---bayonet crossed bayonet, and the opposing columns met and waved to and fro for a moment in one reeling line of bristling steel; while near them the painted Indians, who yelled like demons as they rushed from the forest to aid in turning the fortunes of the day, were fighting hand to hand with the grim backwoodsmen. It was strange, when the crisis of the instant was over, to see the order that came out of such confusion, when the British, though borne down by the furious charge of Baker, Sarabie, and Peters, kept closing up their ranks, and retreated to their boats as coolly as if upon field-parade. The stars and stripes never had a braver sword to guard them than that wielded by Ensign Whistler on that day; but old England's banner waved hardly less proudly even in defeat. "Ah! it's a pretty sight to see real soldiers cut each other's throats in a business-like way; and I was peskily worried when they called me off as I sat upon the breastwork from which the reserve of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] the enemy had been driven, to look after the poor devils whose business had been only half done for them. The first wounded man they brought me had been bored through the thigh by a British bayonet. It was but a boy, and I did not wonder that he howled like a wild Indian when I applied the probe to his hurt as he lay upon the rampart. Not knowing what next to do, I told a couple of fellows to move him, when, just as one had raised his head, a ball took him right through the throat, and freed me at the same time from patient and assistant. The man that was helping him threw a kind o' back somerset from the breastwork. He seemed to think at first that nothing but the shock of the fall disabled him so suddenly. He floundered about so curiously in trying to regain his feet, striking out the while for all the world like an awkward swimmer, or a chicken that beats his wings when the cook wrings his head off, that I could not forbear from laughing; though I tell you it made me feel all over when, with a wriggle of his neck, he suddenly came to a stand-still, with eyes broad open, and so sot in death upon my own face, that they appeared to look me through and through. I have often heard soldiers laugh in battle when a gunshot wound makes a comrade cut these antics in dying; and you know we do become kind o' heathens about such matters; but, seeing that I was not then a soldier, I never could forgive myself for laughing at that poor fellow's expiring agonies. "The regular surgeon, who accompanied Miller's detachment, took the worst cases off my hands [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] that day, and my next opportunities of practice were in the fever-hospital of Detroit, where I had not been many days before the vacillating movements of Hull upon the opposite side of the river began to dispirit the whole army, which, as is always the case, soon swelled the sick list, and I was superseded in my duty by an older and more capable surgeon. My patients were spread out upon the floor in their blankets when this officer came to relieve me of their charge, and examine me as to the course of treatment I had pursued. `Well, to business, to business, Doctor,' said he, turning up his nose and filling it with a huge pinch of snuff, as he first scented the apartment upon entering it; `you get along with these poor fellows, eh---eh? Not lose many of them I hope, eh, Doctor, eh?' "`Why, sir, when the river is at as low a stage as it is now, with no wind from the lower lakes to prevent the water from running out and exposing the decomposing matter upon the banks, they tell me that this country-fever is incurable. My Creole assistant the other day told me that a man who had just died, introduced him to a New Orleans acquaintance in going off; and since then we have had ten other cases of black vomit.' "`Eh---indeed---hum---hah---we---eh---we must be mum about all that sort o' thing---bad, very bad--- plenty of calomel in the medicine chest though, I suppose?' "`Yes, sir, some; also some salts. In exhibiting my remedies, I administer both medicines in equal quantities, in order that one shall not become [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] exhausted before the other. This I call the saline side of the room, and the row of patients opposite are all under the influence of calomel.' "`Ah---eh---indeed---strange mode of treatment, but military, eh? Doctor, you draw your men up in regular lines for their last march. Good! ha! ha! ha! hum! But from which platoon do you count off the most convalescent?' "`The average of cures is about the same, sir, upon either side; is it not, Alphonse?' said I, turning to my Creole assistant, who at that moment approached us. "`Oui, Monsieur---certainement---we buries about de same from both rows every day.' "But confound those hospital days; it always makes me gloomy to talk them over. I had been making interest for a commission long before I was relieved from my disagreeable duty in this place; a friendly representation of one or two little things which I had done in the way of knocking down an Indian or so while mingling as an amateur in the affair of Magagua, procured me an ensign's commission, which I received just in time to include me among the regulars as a prisoner of war in Hull's capitulation; but, as the militia were allowed to return to their homes after the fall of Detroit, I thought it better to pocket my unseasonable honours, and march off as plain Dr. Peabody. The circumstance afterward gave rise to a dispute as to the actual date of commission, and my consequent place in the line of my promotion; but the only officer whose rank thus jostled with mine was fool enough to force a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] hostile meeting upon me two years afterward, when, you know, a proper regard to the situation of my name upon the army list compelled me to shoot him. "Poor Raffles, we were at one time more intimate than any two men in the mess. We both of us played the flute, and were in the habit of practising duets together; and, though our fight was all arranged six weeks before it took place, yet we kept up our music as usual till the last. The thing happened pretty much in this way: You see, one night, out of sheer kindness, I had volunteered to carry a challenge for a poor devil, whom his brother officers had put in Coventry because he was seen taking a scalp, like a wild Indian, upon the field of battle. He came and told me of having been grievously insulted, without ever letting on that my friend Raffles was the man who had put upon him; and, knowing that no officer in the regiment would stand by the forlorn creetur, I, out of sheer kindness, offered to carry his message. The paper was written right off hand; several other officers were standing by at the time, and, though it made me feel a little ridiculous when I saw my principal coolly put the name of my most intimate friend upon the back of the note, you know it was too late to withdraw from my pledge. "Poor Harry, how he stared when I gave him the note. "`Why, Jake,' he cried, `d---mn it, what's the meaning of this? you don't mean to stand in that fellow's shoes, do you?' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] "`In his shoes? why, God's weather! Harry, you will meet the man, won't you?' "`My dear Jake, can you expect me to put myself upon a level with a scoundrel who has actually scalped a British officer? What the devil possessed you to thrust yourself into such a business as this?' "`That is neither here nor there, Mr. Raffles; the person of whom you speak stands in the relation of my friend at present, and I cannot hear you talk in that style about him.' "`Mr. Raffles! your friend? Well, sir, you know best how to play your own game, and for my part I shall use the privilege which the laws of honour allow in these matters. I will meet the representative of your friend, sir. I will---but stay--- d---mn it, Jake, let the thing lie over till to-morrow morning, and I'll try and make up my mind to meet your principal.' "It is for your pleasure to determine that matter, Raffles. My friend, you know, is no shot, and I---' "`And you are the best in the regiment. I see the inference that may be drawn. I thank you for the hint. Mr. Peabody, I will send a friend to you in the morning. I wish you a good-night, sir.' "Now blister my blundering tongue, I never meant my friend to give such a turn to this last suggestion; I merely intended to hint that he might meet my scalping friend, and tap him gently in the shoulder without exposing himself to any inconvenience, and so the affair might pass up to the satisfaction of all parties; but Raffles, when his honour [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] was concerned, was just one of those fiery fellows that will go off upon a half-cock in the hands of the friends who try to guide him. "Well, the morning came, but the affair was still in abeyance. My principal had been ordered off, with a detachment for supplies, in the course of the night. He was not expected to return for a month, and all the officers agreed that Raffles ought not to make public any decision in regard to his choice of an antagonist until Scalpy, as he was generally called, should return among us. In the meantime, when the first sensation of this affair had blown over, our winter quarters were as dull as ever, and, for want of something else to amuse us, Raffles and I resumed our flute practising. Occasionally, too, when the weather would permit, we took our fowling-pieces and went out together after wild ducks. I don't think, however, that we were exactly the same to each other as formerly; neither of us would, of course, show any concern as to what might happen, before the other officers; but we had mighty little to say to each other when alone. We became, somehow, cooler and cooler, until it was no longer `Jake' and `Harry,' but `Mr. Raffles' and `Mr. Peabody.' Still, however, we kept up our fluting until the source of all this mischief came back to camp. And sorry enough were both of us, I guess, to see him. He had been on a long tramp, through woods alive with out-lying Indians, and the chances were ten to one that some of Tecumseh's people would have made dogs' meat of him. But your bad penny, somehow, always comes back to hand. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] fellow did return safe and sound, and we had to make the best of it. He had been living all the while hand and glove with the vilest of his rangers, and returned more coarse and vulgar than ever. Raffles could not bring himself to acknowledge such a chap as his equal; and I, though I wished the varmint to the devil, was obliged to fight his battles for him. We met---poor Harry and I. His pistol snapped, and I threw away my first fire; but I did it so unskilfully, that he saw I meant to let him off, and became furious for another exchange of shots. The truth is, the man was mad. The doom of bad luck had gone out against him, and his eyes were sot upon hurrying to his fate. I shot my friend through the heart, sir, and rose one on the army list." The major here gave a dry cough, while a slight trembling of his eyelids betrayed that he was not the wholly emotionless being that he would paint himself. "It was soon after this that General Winchester had orders to break up his cantonment near the mouth of the Au Glaize, and push forward to the Rapids, which we reached through the deep snows of mid-winter, with about one thousand effective men. Here we received those expresses from the inhabitants of Frenchtown urging us to march upon the enemy near that point. The appeal fired the souls of our officers, who burned for action. The gallant Colonel Allen, who took a conspicuous part in Winchester's military council, advocated an immediate movement. A corps, composed of regulars and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] Kentucky volunteers, was organized, and the command given to Colonel Lewis. We reached the River Raisin, which was covered by thick and strong ice. The British and Indians were posted among the straggling houses along the banks. They were apprized of our approach, and we displayed and marched forward under the fire of musketry and howitzers. The battalions of Graves and Maddison, preceded by Ballard's light infantry, charged across the river, and dislodged the enemy from the houses and pickets. The Indians fought like fiends incarnate, and Reynolds twice rallied his Englishmen to the charge; but Allen, with the Kentucky brigade, dashed amid a shower of bullets upon his left, and the fortune of the day was soon ours. "But never was a victory attended with such disastrous consequences. Infatuated with our success, we determined to maintain our position, though no provision had been made by our commander-in-chief to strengthen us in a proper manner. We had not a single piece of artillery; and, though General Winchester himself joined us with two hundred and fifty men, yet the most ordinary precautions to keep our troops together were neglected; nor did he even place a picket guard upon the only road by which our position could be conveniently approached. Our force consisted altogether of only seven hundred and fifty men, and many of those lay encamped in open field, when, on the morning of the fatal twenty-second, Proctor came down upon us with a combined force of fifteen hundred British and Indians, and six pieces of artillery. The body of men belonging to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] encampment were instantly overpowered, and my company and another, which sallied out to their rescue, were at once cut off; I only, with a couple of privates, making good my retreat within the line of our picketing defences. The artillery in the meantime opened upon this slight breastwork of pickets, while the British forty-first charged under cover of the fire; no soldiers could come on more coolly and steadily, but the British bayonet was no match then for the Kentucky rifle. They made three successive assaults, but at each time were driven back with heavy loss. The terrible slaughter in his ranks now made Proctor pause. The general, and half of our little force, were already in his hands; and, though he had the means of crushing the rest of us, it could only be done with immense loss to himself. He sent a flag proposing a surrender, but we rejected his terms. "Our volunteers consisted chiefly of gentlemen--- young lawyers, physicians, Kentucky planters, and other people of condition, each of whom, though serving as a private, had an individual character, as well as his country's honour, to sustain; and all of us were well armed, and elated with the repulse we had already given the enemy. We had yet thirty-five officers and four hundred and fifty men, after fighting six hours against artillery and five hundred British troops, backed by a thousand savages. "Proctor sent another flag, with better terms; but his message hinted something about the fate we were likely to meet at the hands of his red allies in case he was compelled to carry the place by assault; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] while the Indians yelled, during the brief conference, like wolves ravening for their prey. This, however, instead of scaring us into compliance, only served to riley our men. It was, in fact, only a roundabout way of bullying, to say the best of it. We again rejected his terms, and resolved to make a die of it. "But Proctor was too many for us; it was in his power to use us up, and he was determined to do it, only after his own fashion. He now sent a third flag, with a communication from our general, that he, General Winchester, had surrendered us as prisoners of war, under an explicit engagement that we were to be protected in our persons and private property, and have our side-arms returned to us. And now came the first dissensions among our little force. Some were wearied out with the toil of the day, and ready at once to adopt the terms of capitulation; others were more full of fight than ever, and eager to go ahead; some argued that it was mutinous not to come into the terms which our commanding officer had made for us; and others, again, insisted that, being a prisoner in the hands of the enemy, he had no right to make terms for us. But Winchester, though wanting in conduct as a general, was as benevolent as he was brave, and had still the love and confidence of most of us: his advice, rather than his order, prevailed, and we surrendered. Never did men do a weaker thing than surrender themselves, with arms in their hands, to such an enemy as Proctor, with the hope that a fellow whom Tecumseh afterward rowed up Salt River, as well as for his want of faith as his inefficiency in using injuns, could pro [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] tect them against a horde of infuriated savages. [9] I don't know whether or not the man quailed before the ferocious demands of his allies; but, notwithstanding the humane remonstrance of his own officers, he did not leave a guard of British soldiers for his prisoners, as he had pledged himself. The Indians [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] were set on drinking blood, and he marched off with his regulars, leaving them to revel in it. Contrary to express stipulations, the swords were taken from the sides of our officers, and then, unarmed, and stripped almost naked, our prisoners were left to be driven by the Indians in the rear of the English forces upon their retrograde march to Malden. Few, however, ever reached that British garrison. Many were slaughtered upon the spot. Some were carried off to be roasted at the stake by the bands of savages that from time to time dropped off from the main body, and stole home to make merry with their captives at a feast of blood. But the most gallant and distinguished of our officers perished upon the spot. I saw Colonel Allen, with four kinsmen of the same name, the youngest a boy of seventeen, butchered within a hundred yards of the Raisin. Simpson, the member of congress, with Majors Madison and Ballard, and Captains Bledsoe, Hickman, Mason, Woolfolk, Kelly, M`Cracken, Williams, and Hamilton, with many a private who had the best blood of Kentucky in his veins, all perished in that field of slaughter. Young Hart, the kinsman of Harry Clay, who claimed the protection of an old college chum that he met in the British ranks, was dragged, wounded, from his horse, and tomahawked and scalped like the rest. It made my flesh crawl to hear the shrieks of those dying men as they howled curses upon the unheeding Proctor, mingled with bitter imprecations upon their own folly in trusting to the mercy of such a foe. But this was not the worst scene which that day presented. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] "There were about sixty of our people who, being wounded or ill, had sought shelter from the cold in the house of a Canadian on the banks of the Raisin. Some had crawled thither amid the confusion of the fight; others had been conveyed there by friends immediately after the surrender; and a few, like myself, had sought the place to look after a wounded comrade. The rear guard of the British regulars had scarce taken up their line of march before this house was beset by the savages, and fired in a dozen places. I was kneeling on the floor in an upper story beside a poor fellow, who, fevered with his wounds, was swallowing eagerly a handful of snow which I had just reached to him from the window-sill, when I heard the Indians whooping beneath the window, and smelt the smoke coming up the passage-way. Almost at the same moment there was a simultaneous cry among the wounded in the room below us, followed by a rush toward the door, and yells and groans of agony, as the savages, rushing into the entry, brained those who attempted to escape, with their tomahawks. A heavy burst of smoke, which seemed to come up from the cellar, succeeded; and, looking out, I saw the Indians springing by dozens from the window below me. But while these thus hastened to escape from being stifled, as many more were pouring into the house to snatch their scalps from the inmates before the fire could consume them. The fire had as yet only burst into flame in the cellar, and the wet clap-boards on the outside of the house smoked like a pile of green timber with live coals beneath it. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] Indians as yet had not come up to where we were; and when we heard the live flames roaring below, some prayed for the fate of their friends who had but now perished with the tomahawk; others, though half stifled with smoke, seemed only to dread the Indians, who yelled like wild devils as they glanced in and out from the building. But now came a grand crash, which seemed to tell that their fate, whatever it might be, was at hand. The floor in the room below gave way, and the sharp yells of sudden agony which mingled with the moans of the dying prisoners, told that some of the savages must have gone down with it. I could hear some of them, too, exhorting each other as they clung to the steep stair-case above them, and tried to mount to the place of momentary safety where we were. But two succeeded; and the shaven crowns and begrimed faces of these emerged through the well of the stair-case along with a burst of flame, which seemed, as it were, to hoist them into our room like demons lifted upon their native element. God's weather! had you seen those horrible faces glowering upon you from out the fire, you would have cowered in a corner as I did. "The devils! instead of making at once for the window, and escaping from the house, as I thought they would, they began at once to pay about them with their scalping-knives. They never stopped to tomahawk men who were too feeble to resist, but peeled their heads as readily as you would strip the skin from a ripe peach. Accident, or the eddying smoke-wreaths, which came thicker and thicker into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] the apartment, prevented their seeing me until one of them had engaged in a death-grapple with a stout sergeant, who, being only wounded in his knee-pan, could make good fight with the fellow who threw himself upon his body to take his scalp. "The first sound of resistance put new life into my limbs, and I braced myself for a tussle with the other savage in the same moment that a puff of wind, wrapping the combatants from view, revealed me to the Indian who was springing to the assistance of his comrade. He turned upon me so abruptly that he stumbled over a dead body by my side, and I flung myself upon him, and plucked his scalping-knife from the floor, as it stood quivering where his hand had drove it in falling. He was a stout and heavy savage; and, though not slow myself at wrestling, he turned me under him at the first grapple, and planted his fingers at my throat with a grip like an armorer's vice. The knife was still in my hand, but it was bent nearly double; and if I had lifted my arm, he would have wrenched it from me to a certainty. I pretended, therefore, to be quite spent, while straightening the knife by pressing the blade beneath my wrist against the floor. The next moment I made another struggle---the Indian raised himself a little to get a better hold, and then, as he came down with his full weight upon my body, I slipped aside so adroitly that the knife, which I had raised on the butt-end, entered his bosom clean up to the haft, and the warm blood, spouting over my face, made it as red as his own. "All this, as you may conceive, passed in less [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] time than I take in telling it. Yet even in that space of time the fire had gained upon us fearfully, and put an end to the fight of the sergeant and his Indian in the same moment that I despatched mine. The rafters on the opposite side of the room gave way; and the white and red man, with hands clutched in each other's hair, were plunged amid the roaring flames below. "Now, the sight of those flames was just what saved my life after all. I seized my Indian's blanket, to shield me from the fire until I could reach the window, and sprang, with it wrapped around me, among the crowd of devils who were howling for blood below. I fell into a deep snow-bank, which covered my boots and trousers, as did the blanket my body. My hair was burnt off, and my face, red with blood and begrimmed with smoke, made me look so much like a real Indian, that, having plenty to do on their own account, the others let one of their comrades, as they thought me, lie there like an old log. The roof fell in soon afterward; the flames shot high into the air, and the smoke and embers rolled far and wide, as the sides of the house came crashing down in the midst of the flames. The savages gave an exulting yell, as if contented that they had done their worst, and then trooped, like a pack of ravening wolves, after the detachment of prisoners which followed in Proctor's rear. Few of them, as we know, ever reached Malden; and for a fact, I thought at the time, when I crawled half-frozen from that snow-bank, that my chance was probably the luckiest in all the army that was captivated on the River Raisin. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] "The wolves had succeeded their Indian brothers, and were already busy upon the dead when I crept from my hiding-place. The night was raw and gusty, and the snappish growl of the creeturs, as they quarrelled over the food, when there was enough for all of them, the varmints! sounded on the fitful blast like the wrangling of Christian men. There was no need of making a circuit to avoid them; for, though by the light of the snow we could see each other as plain as day, they did not even stop to look at me as I crossed the clearings to get to the woods in the rear of Frenchtown. This I didn't do though, without meeting with a sort o' interruption which was queer, to say the least of it. There was a little knoll near the banks of the Raisin, which I rather chose to go round than to cross over the top, thinking that it was not best to bring my body clean against the sky as a mark for any loitering drunken Indian that might still by possibility be out-lying near the scene of his hellish orgies. Well, as I wound round the hillock and got within a hundred yards of the forest, which was close upon it, what should I meet upon the other side but a great buck bear, who had just dragged a body around the opposite side of the knoll, and was under full sail for the woods in the very direction that I was steering for them. The brute might have been a few paces in advance of me when I stumbled upon him, and he seemed considerably taken aback, though he had no idea of dropping his prize. A half-starved, half-frozen man has not much active courage to spare; but if he has gone through scenes such as I witnessed that day, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] he feels pretty indifferent as to what next may turn up on his hands. It seemed to warm my natur, too, within me, to have something upon which I could pour the vengeful feelings that I felt just then ag'inst all creation; and, though armed with nothing but my dead Indian's scalping-knife, I made a spring toward the bear and planted my foot upon the body he was dragging. The creetur let go the other end, and sat right up on his hinderparts, looking first at me and then at the dead body, but never offering to harm me. The moon at that moment broke through a cloud, and, for the first time, I saw that it was only an Indian that my opposite neighbour was carrying off for his supper; and I thought there was such a sort of gravity about his appeal in looking from me to the Indian, and from the Indian to me, as if the dumb brute know'd that I had only made a mistake, and didn't mean to molest him wantonly, that I took off my foot, stepped backward a pace or two, and let him pass on. But bears have their hour of fate as well as men; for this one had not gone twenty steps farther when I heard the crack of a rifle, and he tumbled over in the snow, scratching his head with his fore-paws in a way that showed a bullet must have gone through it. In a moment afterward, leaving time only to reload, a white hunter stepped from the edge of the forest, and, levelling his rifle upon me, beckoned with his forefinger for me to come into him, addressing me at the same time in the half French, half Indian lingo at that time prevailing in this district---`Venez ici needji.' "`Throw up your shooting-iron, and don't call me [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] needji , old gumbo, unless you mean friend, and not Indian, by it. I'm a half-starved white man, and should like a bit of your bear that you knocked over so handsomely.' "`Nesheshin---chemocomon! ah! c'est bon, Monsieur, c'est un Americain,' he rejoined, advancing from the edge of the wood and giving me his hand. I saw at once that it was an old gumbo hunter, and, knowing what a guileless set they are, I felt instantly at ease, for one of his class was the only man who could now help me out of those infernal woods, and guide me to the nearest United States post. "I helped him to drag the wounded bear within the forest so soon as he had despatched him with his tomahawk. A few moments sufficed to flay him, and then, after cutting some tender bits from the carcass, we retired deeper into the woods to sup upon bruin, who, half an hour before, might have made a supper of me. The wood we were in was only a narrow belt dividing the Frenchtown settlement from a large wet prairie, which we were obliged to circuit for some miles before taking up a direct route for the Rapids, whither I prevailed upon the Frenchman to guide me. In summer-time the tall reeds of this prairie would have afforded ample shelter in traversing it, if, indeed, it be possible; but it was now only a frozen, snowy waste, where the figure of a man might have been descried for miles; and I felt considerably relieved when we had safely navigated along the borders, and got in the deep forest to the south. I needn't tell of all I suffered in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] struggling through the heavy snows until I reached Carrying River, to which Harrison, after hearing of the disaster of Frenchtown, had retreated, for the purpose of forming a junction with the troops in the rear. I arrived here in such a condition that I was placed at once upon the sick list. "After that I was pretty much useless to myself and to all others till after the war; when, at the reduction of the army, I was dropped like many a more deserving fellow, who, like myself, lacked the education to do his country credit upon her peace establishment. Uncle Sam gave me some broad lands in the far-west, however; but, though one of his territorial governors promised to commission me in a corps of rangers in case I settled upon them, I somehow could never go them flat western prairies. I longed for the woods and mountains of Old York State. I swapped my bounty lands for one thing and another that I could turn into ready money, until I was able to buy me a farm down among the hills of Montgomery County, from which I can easily take a run up among these mountains whenever it jumps with my humour; and that's all I've got to tell you about Old Major Jake Peabody. He's not so old though neither, except from his experience in studying human natur." Though sometimes losing the phraseology of the worthy major in repeating the history he gave of his adventures, the conclusion, being precisely in his own words, will give the reader some idea of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] conceit that was blended with a character at once shrewd and simple, and often recklessly, if not gamesomely, bold amid much habitual and inborn selfishness. There were many such men who raised themselves from the ranks in our quickly-created army of 1812-13; and being, like the major, suddenly dropped from the list on its reduction, or gradually weeded out from the service by a more accomplished and high-minded race of officers, fell into penury and intemperance, and finished their lives so deplorably that the gallantry of their early career has been too often forgotten in the debasement that sullied its close. The broils and battles which enhanced the major's narrative, led naturally to the relation of many an anecdote illustrative of our fierce border warfare, which I now think would be invaluable to a professional story-teller; though at that time I would have shuddered at any mercenary use of the wild themes which seeming to me so rich in poetry, and wearing a sort of virgin grace about them, from the very fact that they had never been sung; a grace I was then willing to believe far more winning to me than the prodigal associations which cluster around the classic scenes and time-honoured traditions of the old world. There was one incident particularly reminding me so strongly of some passages in the Lady of the Lake, that I used to think, with a kind of fevered impatience, that the vigorous pen of Scott should be for ever wanting to do it justice. And albeit but a college rhymer myself, I ventured at last to attempt picturing it in a boyish imitation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] of his glorious verse, which subsequently found its way into print many years since, in the form in which it is copied here from a daily newspaper. [10] [9] When General Proctor began to prepare for retreating from Malden, Tecumseh, having learned his intention, demanded an interview, and, in the name of all the Indians, remonstrated in these terms: "Summer before last, when I came forward with my red brethren, and took up the hatchet for my British father, you told us to bring our women and children to this place, and we did so; you also promised to take care of them---they should want for nothing, while the men would go and fight the Americans. You also told your red children that you would take good care of your own garrison here, which made our hearts glad. "Father, listen! Our fleet has gone out---we know they have fought---we have heard the great guns---but we know nothing of what has happened to our father with one arm.  Our ships have gone one way, and we are much astonished to see our father tying up everything and preparing to run away the other, without letting his red children know what his intentions are. You always told us to remain here, and take care of our lands; it made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish. Our great father, the king, is the head, and you represent him. You always told us you would never draw your foot off British ground. But now, father, we see you are drawing back, and we are sorry to see our father doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat dog, that carries its tail upon its back, but, when affrighted, it drops it between his legs and runs off. "Father! You have got the arms and ammunition which our great father sent for his red children. If you have an idea of going away, give them to us, and you may go and welcome for us. Our lives are in the hands of the Great Spirit. We are determined to defend our lands; and, if it be his will, we wish to leave our bones upon them."--- Thatcher's Indian Biography . Commodore Barclay, of the British flotilla on Lake Erie. [10] The New York American, June, 1830. The mountain-tops are bright above, The lake is bright beneath--- And the mist is seen, the rocks between, In a silver shroud to wreathe. Merrily on the maple spray The red-breast trills his roundelay, And the oriole blithely flits among The boughs where her pendent nest is hung; The squirrel his morning revel keeps In the chestnut's leafy screen, And the fawn from the thicket gayly leaps To gambol upon the green. Now on the broad lake's waters blue Dances many a light canoe; And banded there, in wampum sheen, Many a crested chief is seen: Now as the foamy fringe they break, Which the waves, where they kiss the margin, make, The shallops shoot on the snowy strand, And the plumed warriors leap to land. They bear their pirogues of birchen bark Far in the shadowy forest glade, And plunge them deep in covert dark Of the closely woven hazle shade; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] Then stealthily tread in each other's track, And with wary step come gliding back. And when the water again is won Unlace the beaded mockason, And covering first with careful hand The footmarks dash'd in the yielding sand, Round jutting point and dented bay Through the wave they take their winding way. Awhile their painted forms are seen Gleaming along the margin green, And then the sunny lake is left--- Where issuing from a mountain cleft--- Above whose bold impending height The dusky larch excludes the light, The current of a rivulet Conceals their wary footsteps yet. Scaling the rocks, where strong and deep Abrupt the waters foaming leap, Along the stream they bending creep, Where the hanging birch's tassels sweep, Thrid the witch-hazle and alder-maze, Where in broken rills the streamlet strays, And reach the spot where its oozy tide Steals from the mountain's shaggy side. Now where wild vines their tendrils fling, From crag to crag their forms they swing, Some boldly find a footing where The mountain cat would hardly dare; Others as lightly onward bound As the frolic chipmunk skips the ground, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] Till all the midway mountain gain And there once more collected meet, Where on the eagle's wild domain The morning sunbeams fiercely beat. There's a glen upon that mountain-side, A sunny dell expanding wide, Where the eye that looks thro' the green arcade Of cliffs in vines and shrubs arrayed, Sees many a silver stream and lake Upon its raptured vision break; That sunny dell has its opening bright, Almost within an arrow's flight, Of a fearful gorge, whose upper side Rank weeds and furze as closely hide, As if some frolic fays had plied Their skill in weaving osiers green, And thus in elvish freak had tried Its gloomy mouth to screen. 'Tis a chasm beneath the wooded steep, Where the brain will swim and the blood will creep When its dizzy edge is seen, And the Fiend will prompt the heart to leap When the eye would measure the yawning deep Of that hideous ravine. Far down the gulf in distance dim The bat will oft at noontide skim, The rattlesnake like a shadow glides Through poisonous weeds in its shelvy sides, While swarming lizards loathsome crawl Where the green damp stands on the slimy wall, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] And the venomous copper-snake's heard to hiss On the frightful edge of that black abyss. Here, in the feathery fern---between The tangled thicket's matted screen, Their weapons hid, save where a blade From straggling ray reflection made, The Adirondach warriors lay. The morning sees them gather there And crouch within their leafy lair--- The scorching beams of noontide hour, If boughs should lift, would only play On bronzed and motionless array Within that silent bower: Still silent when the mantle gray Of sombre twilight slowly fell O'er rocky height and wooded dell, Those men of bronze all silent they Still waited for their prey! How slow the languid moments move, How long to him their lapse appears In whom remorse, or fear, or love, Concentres griefs untold by tears, The gathered agony of years! But o'er the Indian warrior's soul Uncounted and unheeded roll Long hours, like these in watching spent, The moments that he knows within, When on the glorious War-Path sent, Are calm as those which usher in The thunders of the firmament!

Now myriad stars are twinkling through The vaulted heaven's veil of blue, And seem reflected in the wave With golden studs its bed to pave. Now as upon the western hills The moon her mystic circle fills, Against the sky each cliff is flung, As if at magic touch it sprung; And as the wood her beam receives, The dew-drop in that virgin light Pendent from the quivering leaves, Sparkles upon the pall of night. Deep in the linden's foliage hid, Complains the peevish katydid. And the shrill screech-owl answers back From tulip-tree and tamarack. At times along the placid lake A solitary trout will break, And rippling eddies on the stream, In trembling circles faintly gleam; While near the sedgy shore is heard The plash of that ill-omened bird, Whose dismal note and boding cry Will oft the startled ear assail, When lowering clouds obscure the sky, And when the tempest gathers nigh Come quivering in the rising gale.

Oh, why cannot that loon's wild shriek To them a feeble warning speak, Who careless press a foeman's sod, As if in banquet-hall they trod; Who rashly thus undaunted dare To chase in woods the forest child, To hunt the panther to his lair, The Indian in his native wild? Unapprehensive thus, at night The wild doe looking from the brake, To where there gleams a fitful light Dotted upon the rippling lake, Sees not the silver spray-drop dripping From the lithe oar which, softly dipping, Impels the wily hunter's boat; But on his ruddy torch's rays, As nearer, clearer now they float, The fated quarry stands to gaze, And dreaming not of cruel sport, Withdraws not thence her gentle eyes Until the rifle's sharp report The simple creature hears and dies.

The cautious beaver starts with fear, That strange unwonted sound to hear; But still her grave demeanour keeps, As from her hovel-door she peeps--- Observing thence with curious eye The pageant as it passes by; Pauses the wailing whip-poor-will One moment, in her plaintive trill, As echoing on the mountain-side Their martial music wanders wide; Then, as the last note dies away, Pursues once more her broken lay. At length they reach that fatal steep, Which, hanging o'er the chasm deep, With stunted copse and tangled heath, Conceals the gulf that yawns beneath.

And savage eyes glare fiercely out From every bush and vine about; And savage forms the branches throw, In dusky masses on the foe. In vain their leaders strive to form Their ranks beneath that living storm! As whoop on whoop discordant fell Loudly on their astounded ears, As if at once each fiendish yell Awoke, within that narrow dell, The echoes of a thousand years! No rallying cry, no hoarse command Can marshal that bewildered band; Nor clarion call to standard, more Those panic-stricken ranks restore; Now strown like pines upon the path Where bursts the fierce tornado's wrath, Yet some there are who undismayed Seek sternly back to back arrayed, With eye and blade alert, in vain A moment's footing to maintain.

Like scud before the wintry blast, That through the sky comes sweeping fast, Like leaves upon the tempest whirled They toward the steep are struggling hurled.

There, fighting still, with mad endeavour, As on the dizzy edge they hover, Their bugle breathes one rallying note, Pennon and plume one moment float; Then, swept beyond the frightful brink Like mist, into the chasm sink; Within whose bosom, as they fell, Arose as hideous, wild a yell As if the very earth were riven, And shrieks from hell were upward driven. When the hour of dinner arrived, and pipes and cigars were laid aside for more substantial refreshment, the introduction of some parched corn among the condiments of our repast raised a discussion between "the counsellor" and myself, as to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] Asiatic, or American origin of this great staple of our farmers; and, upon asking the opinion of Captain Gill as to how the maize was first obtained, the old chief nodded to one of his dusky satellites, who straightway set the question at rest for ever by giving an explanation, of which the following is the purport: " There is a place on the banks of the softly-flowing Unadilla, not far from its confluence with the Susquehannah, which in former years was an extensive beaver-meadow. The short turf sloped down almost to the brink of the stream, whose banks in this place nourish not a single tree to shadow its waters. Here, where they flow over pebbles so smooth and shiny that the Indian maid who wandered along the margin, would pause to tell over her strings of wampum, and think the beads had dropped below, there came one day some girls to bathe; and one, the most beautiful of all, lingered behind her companions, to gather these bright pebbles from the bed of the river. "A water-spirit, who had assumed the form of a musquosh, sat long watching her from the shore. He looked at her shining shoulders, at her dripping locks, and the gently swelling bosom over which they fell; and when the maid lifted her rounded limbs from the water, and stepped lightly upon the green sod, he too raised himself from the mossy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] nook where he had been hidden, and, recovering his own shape, ran to embrace her. "The maiden shrieked and fled, but the enamoured spirit pressed closely in pursuit; and the meadow affording no shrub nor covert to screen her from her eager pursuer, she turned again toward the stream she had left, and made for a spot where the wild flowers grew tall and rankly by the moist margin. The spirit still followed her; and, frightened and fatigued, the girl would have sunk upon the ground as he approached, had she not been supported by a tuft of flags while hastily seizing and twining them around her person to hide her shame. "In that moment her slender form grew thinner and more rounded; her delicate feet became indurated in the loose soil that opened to receive them; the blades of the flag broadened around her fingers, and enclosed her hand; while the pearly pebbles that she held resolved themselves into milky grains, which were kept together by the plaited husk. "The baffled water-spirit sprang to seize her by the long hair that yet floated in the breeze, but the silken tassels of the rustling maize was all that met his grasp." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] A GLORIOUS sunset succeeded the day of storms; and, all our arrangements being completed for a grand hunt on the morrow, I sallied out to observe the effect of the golden light upon the rainbow foliage of autumn still dripping with the shower. Accompanied by Major Jake, and guided by one of the Indians, we made our way to an elevation some distance from the lake, commanding an extensive view of the unbroken forest that rose in billowy masses on every side. The hillock where we paused was surmounted by the slight remains of one of those singular mounds which, though not unfrequently found in the state of New York, are beheld in such variety and perfection upon the prairies of the far-west; where there enormous size, not less than their profusion of numbers, astounds and bewilders the speculations of the antiquary. In ascending to the top of this one, I chanced to trip over some bones projecting from the side of the mound, where some wild animal had removed the turf while making his burrow, and I paused to ask the Indian guide if he knew anything about them. "Those old bones!" cried Major Jake, turning round; "why, that ignorant varmint can tell you nothing about them, Squire: they were the frame-work of men who kicked their shins against these knobs a million of years a'fore his people came here to scare game and scalp white folks." The Iroquois evidently understood the words of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] the rough hunter, though he did not vouchsafe a reply to the slur upon his race. He did not seem, however, to take offence at the rude and officious answer to a question addressed to himself, but, waited patiently until the other had finished speaking, he drew his blanket around him, and, turning with his face westward as he planted his last steps upon the summit, stood erect upon the mound. The light of the setting sun was thrown full upon his attenuated features, and lit them up with almost as ruddy a glow as that which bathed the autumnal foliage around him. He was mute for some moments, and then spoke to this effect: "Yes! they were here before my people, but they could not stay when we came, no more than the red man can now bide before the presence of the Longknife. The Master of Life willed it, and our fathers swept them from the land. The Master of Life now wishes to call back his red people to the blessed gardens whence they first started, and he sends the Pale-faces to drive them from the countries which they have learned to love so well as to be unwilling to leave them. "It is good. Men were meant to grow from the earth like the oak which springs in the pine barren, or the evergreen that shoots from the ground where the tree with a falling leaf has been cut down. "But listen, brother! Mark you the hue that dyes every leaf upon that sumach? It is born of the red water, with which its roots were nourished a thousand years ago. It is the blood of a murdered race which flushes every autumn over the land when [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] yearly the moon comes round that saw it perish from this ground." Up, comrades, up! the morn's awake Upon the mountain-side; The wild drake's wing hath swept the lake, And the deer has left the tangled brake, To drink from the rippling tide. Up, comrades, up! the mead-lark's note And the plover's cry o'er the prairie float; The squirrel he springs from his covert now, To prank it away on the chestnut bough, Where the oriole's pendent nest high up Is rocked on the swaying trees, While the humbird sips from the harebell's cup As it bends to the morning breeze. Up, comrades, up! our shallops grate Upon the pebbly strand, And our stalwart hounds impatient wait To spring from the huntsman's hand. The September dawn broke brilliantly upon Sacondaga Lake. The morning did not slowly awake with a yellow light that gradually warmed into the flush of day; but, ruddy and abrupt, the bold streaks shot from behind the mountains high into the heavens, spreading themselves on their path like the fires of the aurora borealis, and dying the lake, in which they were reflected, with hues as vivid as those of the painted forests that walled its waters. We had left our camp, however, long before the stars grew dim. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] The hunt was divided into three parties, each with different duties assigned to them by one who took the direction. The first, who were the drivers, had the hounds in charge; they were to take three different routes, and slip their leashes, after a certain time had elapsed, wherever they might find themselves. They had light guns, and, from knowing every creek and swamp in the country, could follow the dogs to advantage, even when on a fresh track. The second party, who were all armed with long rifles, were to go on the "stations;" these were old foresters, who knew every runway for miles about, and each of whom might be relied upon as stanch at his post, should the chase last for hours. The third party took the skiffs and canoes; a number of the latter being easily shifted to the adjacent waters, so that every lake within several miles of our rendezvous had two or more boats upon it. Lastly, upon a hill overlooking the cluster of lakes, was placed a keen-eyed lad, furnished with a horn, whose duty it was to sound a signal the moment he saw the deer take the water. My friend and myself were attached to the boat party; a skiff with light sculls fell to my lot alone, but my companion, more fortunate, was assigned to a bark canoe with one of the Indians. These arrangements, having been made the night before, were put in action in a very few moments. The strand seemed alive with figures, for a minute only, as we emerged from the thicket wherein our wigwam was secreted; and then, while some plunged into the fo [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] rest, and others glided in their gray shallops around the dusky headlands, the scene of our last night's revels became as silent as if nothing but the chirp of the squirrel or the scream of the jay had ever awakened its echoes. So still, indeed, was it at that early hour in the morning, when the birds had hardly begun to rouse themselves, that I was almost startled by the click of my own oars in the rowlocks as they broke the glassy surface of the lake while I pulled with an easy stroke for a little islet, which I had ample leisure to gain before the dogs would be let slip. Here the drooping boughs of a tall hemlock, which seemed to flourish not less luxuriantly because the towering stem above them was scathed and blasted, screened my boat from view as I ran her under the rocky bank. Having deposited my gun in the bow, with the breech still so near me that I could reach it from midships in so small a craft, I arranged the wooden yoke or halter, with the pole, at my feet, and the noose hanging over the stern; so that I was prepared for action in any way that it might offer itself. This yoke is nothing more nor less than a forked sapling, with a noose of rope or grape-vine at the end, to throw over a wounded deer's horns when your shot does not stop his swimming. If unskilfully managed, the animal is likely to upset your boat in the effort to take him thus; but there are men upon these lakes so adroit in the use of this rude weapon, that they prefer it to fire-arms, when a hunting-knife is at hand to give the game the coup de grace . [11] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] There is nothing in the world like being a few hours on a hunting-station, with every sense upon the alert to familiarize one with the innumerable sounds and noises that steal up in such creeping murmurs from the stillest forest. A man may walk the woods for years, and be conscious only of the call of birds or the cry of some of the larger animals, making themselves heard above the rustling of his own footsteps. But watching thus for young quarry in a country abounding in game, and when it may steal upon you at any moment, interest approaches almost to anxiety; and intense eagerness for sport makes the hearing as nice as when fear itself lends its unhappy instinct to the senses. Myriads of unseen insects appear to be grating their wings beneath the bark of every tree around you, and the "piled leaves," too damp to rustle in the breeze, give out a sound as if a hundred rills were creeping beneath their plaited matting. It is, in fact, no exaggeration to say that the first bay of a hound at such a moment breaks almost like thunder upon the ear. So, at least, did it come now upon mine, as a long, deep-mouthed yell was pealed from a valley opposite, and echoed back from hill to hill around me. The sharp crack of a rifle followed, and then cry after cry, as some fresh dog opened, the stirring chorus came swelling on the breeze. Each second I expected to hear the signal-horn, or see the chase emerging from the forest wherever the indented shore indicated the mouth of a brook along its margin. Not a bush, however, moved near the water; the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] mountains were alive around, but the lake was as untroubled as ever, save when a flock of ducks feeding near me flapped their wings once or twice at the first outcry, and then resumed their unmolested employment. The sudden burst had died away in the distance; the chase had probably been turned by the single piece that was discharged; and now, leading over the farther hills, its sounds became fainter and fainter, until at last they died away entirely. An hour elapsed, and, damp, chilly, and somewhat dispirited, I still maintained my motionless position. A slight breeze had arisen upon the lake, and the little waves, rippling against my boat, made a monotonous flapping sound, that almost lulled me asleep. I was, indeed, I believe, fairly verging upon a most inglorious nap upon my post, when a sharp, eager yell started me from my doze, and made me seize my oars in a moment. It came from a broad, deep bay locked in by two headlands on my right. The farther side of the bay was a marsh, and there, bounding through the tall sedge, I beheld a noble buck, with a single hound about a gunshot behind him. Strangely enough, he seemed to have no disposition to take the water, but, leaping with prodigious bounds over the long grass, kept the margin for a few moments, and then struck into a tamarack swamp that fringed the opening. It was but an instant that he was lost, however; a simultaneous cry from half a dozen hounds told that he was turned in that direction. He appeared again upon a rocky ledge, where some lofty pines, with no underwood, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] were the only cover to screen him. But now his route carried him unavoidably out of the line of my station. I knew that there were those beyond who would care for him; but, in the vexation of my heart at losing my own shot, I could hardly help cursing the poor animal as I saw him hurry to destruction. The height of the cliffs seemed alone to prevent him from taking the water; and I could almost fancy that he looked hurriedly around, while bounding from crag to crag, for a spot where he might best make his plunge. The dogs were now silent; they had not yet issued from the covert; but the moment they emerged from the wood, and caught sight of the game, they opened with a yell which made the deer spring from the high bank as if he were leaping from the very jaws of his pursuers. Now came my first moment of action; I might even yet, I thought, be not too late: I seized my oars, and the tough ash quivered in my hands as I sent the skiff flying over the water. The buck was swimming from me, but he had a broad bay to cross before he could gain the opposite side of the lake. In this bay, and between me and his direct track, was a wooded islet, and, by taking an oblique direction, I tried, as well as possible, to keep it between myself and the hard-pressed animal, in order that, not seeing me, he might still keep on the same course. I must have been nearly abreast of the islet. The route of the deer was only a few hundred yards in advance, and directly at right angles to that which I was steering: I might yet cut him off the opposite shore; the dogs would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] prevent him returning from that he had left; and I would certainly overtake him, should he attempt to make for the bottom of the bay, which was still distant. The moisture started thick upon my brow from exertion, and the knees of my frail shallop cracked as I impelled her through the water. But there were other players in the game besides myself; cooler, more experienced, equally alert, and better situated for winning. The canoe in which was my friend, "The Counsellor," with the Indian, was concealed on the opposite side of the islet, and, having watched the whole progress of the chase, waited only for the buck to come in a line with it before launching in a pursuit sure to be successful. The moment for striking arrived just as I passed the islet; and then, swift as a falcon on the stoop, the arrowy bark shot from its covert, and darted across the water. The effect was more like a vision than any scene I can recall. My friend was nearly concealed from view as he lay on his breast, with his piece levelled directly over the prow of the canoe, waiting for the Indian to give the word to fire; but the person of the latter was fully exposed, and with the most striking effect, as he stood erect in the stern, stripped to the waist, and with every muscle in his swarthy frame brought into action as he plied his flashing paddle. His long hair streamed on the wind, and, with the piercing eyes and features strained with eager and intense excitement, gave an almost unearthly aspect to his countenance. The dogged and listless look which characterized him a few hours before, seemed to have been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] thrown off with the tattered garb that disguised without covering his person; and the keen-eyed, clean-limbed hunter now revealed to view, bore no more resemblance to the sullen and shabby vagrant of yesterday, than does a thorough-bred and mettlesome racer, spurning the green turf with glowing hoof, to the rickety and broken-down hackney that steals through the dirty suburbs of a city. The ludicrous cries, however, that broke from him at every moment, afforded a most whimsical contrast to his picturesque appearance. "Yarh! white man?"---"San Marie! no fire!"---"Howh! diable Poagun!" [12] \---Dame de Lorette! Corlaer,  be ready--- Sacre---Weenuc!" and a dozen other epithets and exclamations, Catholic and heathen, Indian, English, and Canadian, burst in a torrent from his lips. Suddenly, however, discovering he had gained sufficiently upon the buck, he stopped paddling, and, in good calm English, gave his directions to his companion as coolly as if now certain of the prize. The other then covered the deer's head with his rifle as he swam directly from him, but still he waited for the proper moment. It came just as the buck touched the ground with his fore feet; a projecting rock received him, and he reared his antlers high above the water, while his hinderparts were yet submerged in making good his landing. "Fire!" cried the hunter, and at that instant the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] ball struck him in the spine, a few inches behind the ears. The animal bent forward beneath the blow, and then, endeavouring to raise his head, he toppled over backward, and slipped off the rock into the lake---an unresisting carcass. My skiff shot alongside the canoe at that instant; but, though within hearing of all that passed, I was, of course, too late for a shot. The buck, which proved a noble fellow, was soon lifted into the boat, while together we pulled leisurely for the rendezvous on the opposite side of the lake. There the different members of the hunt came gradually dropping in, one after another. A yearling, with its horns yet in the velvet, and a doe in tolerable condition, were the only other fruits of the hunt. But all were loud in praising the buck as the finest and fattest that had been taken near the lake during the season. For several hours the woods rung with merriment, as, kindling our fire upon a broad rock, we feasted upon the spoils of the chase; and our revel was only brought to an end by the close of the day, when, embarking leisurely to steer for our camp, the echoing halloo of the last loiterer faded over the hills as his boat rounded the nearest headland, and finally left the shore to solitude and silence. The hunt is up--- The merry woodland shout, That rung these echoing glades about An hour agone, Hath swept beyond the eastern hills; Where pale and lone The moon her mystic circle fills. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] And now from thicket dark, Where by the mist-wreathed river The firefly spark Will fitful quiver, And bubbles round the lilies cup, From lurking trout come coursing up--- The doe hath led her fawn to drink, While scared by-step so near, Uprising from the sedgy brink, The lonely bittern's cry will sink Upon the hunter's ear; Who, startled from his early sleep, Lists for some sounds approaching nigher--- Half-dreaming lists---then turns to heap Another fagot on his fire; And then again in dreams once more, Pursues his quarry by the shore. The next day's hunt I took no share in, owing to an indisposition incurred while lying at my station, in a wet boat, inactive for hours. I therefore amused myself in writing out a narrative which forcibly struck my fancy as told by one of the party during our row homeward the evening before, and which, upon my visiting the scene of its chief incident some years afterward, assumed in my portfolio the shape of the following story: [11] See chap. xix, p. 66. [12] Poagun, or Tmewawgun, "Pipe," was a name he gave my friend, "The Counsellor."  New Yorker. Schroon Lake is one of the largest, and perhaps the finest, body of water among the myriad lakes which form the sources of the Hudson. "The Schroon," as it is called by the country people, has, indeed, been likened by travellers to the celebrated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] Lake of Como, which it is said to resemble in the configuration of its shores. It is about ten miles in length, broad, deep, and girt with leafy mountains, which, though not so lofty as the more sterile peaks of the Adirondachs, are still picturesque in form, while they enclose a thousand pastoral valleys and sequestered dells among their richly-wooded defiles. [13] In one of the loveliest of these glens, near a fine spring, well known to the deer-stalker, there flourished, a few years since, a weeping willow, which, for aught I know, may be still gracing the spot. The existence of such an exotic in the midst of our primitive forest would excite the curiosity of the most casual observer of nature, even if other objects adjacent did not arrest his attention, as he emerged from the deep woods around, to the sunny glade where it glew. On the side of a steep bank, opposite to the willow, the remains of an old fire-place were to be seen; and blackened timbers, with indications of rough masonry, could be discovered by turning aside the wild raspberry bushes that had overgrown the farther side of the knoll. These ruins betokened something more than the remains of a hunting-camp; and the forester who should traverse an extensive thicket of young beeches and wild cherry trees, within a few hundred yards of this spot, would be at no loss to determine that he had lighted upon the deserted home of some settler of perhaps forty years back: a scene where the toil, the privation, and the dangers of a pioneer's life had been once endured, but where the hand of improvement [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] had wrought in vain, for the forest had already closed over the little domain that had been briefly rescued from its embrace; and the place was now what, in the language of the country, is called a "dead clearing." The story of this ruined homestead is a very common one in the private family annals of the state of New York, which has always been exposed to the perils of frontier warfare, and which, for twenty years, at the close of the seventeenth century, and throughout the whole of that which followed it, was the battle-field of the most formidable Indian confederacy that ever arrayed itself against the Christian powers on the shores of this continent. The broken remains of that confederacy still possess large tracts of valuable land in the centre of our most populous districts; while their brethren of the same colour, but of a feebler lineage, have been driven westward a thousand miles from our borders. And when this remnant of the Iroquois shall have dwindled from among us, their names will still live in the majestic lakes and noble rivers that embalm the memory of their language. They will live, too, unhappily, in many a dark legend of ruthless violence, like that which I have to relate. It was in the same year when Sullivan's army gave the finishing blow to the military power of the Six-Nations, that a settler, who had come in from the "New Hampshire Grants" to this part of Tryon County, (as the northern and western region of New York was at that time called,) was sitting with his wife, who held an infant to her bosom, enjoying his evening pipe beside the hearth. The blaze of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] large maple-wood fire shone warmly upon the unpainted beams above, and lighted up the timbers of the shantee with a mellow glow that gave an air of cheerfulness and comfort to the rudely-furnished apartment. From the gray hairs and weather-beaten features of the settler, he appeared to be a man considerably on the wrong side of forty; while the young, bright-haired mother by his side had not yet passed the sunny season of early youth. The disparity of their years, however, had evidently not prevented the growth of the strongest affection between them. There was a soft and happy look of content about the girl, as she surveyed the brown woodsman, now watching the smoke-wreaths from his pipe as they curled over his head, now taking his axe upon his lap and feeling its edge with a sort of caressing gesture, as if the inanimate thing could be conscious of the silent compliment he paid to its temper, when thinking over the enlargement of the clearing he had wrought by its aid during the day. Nor did the eye of the young mother kindle less affectionately when the brawny pioneer, carefully depositing the simple implement, which is the pride of an American woodsman, behind the chimney, turned to take the hand of the infant, which she pressed to her bosom, and shared at the same time with her the caresses which he bestowed on the child. "That boy's a raal credit to you, Bet. But I think, if he cries to-night as he has for the last week, I must make a papoose-cradle for him to-morrow, and swing him somewhere outside of the shantee, where his squalling can't keep us awake. Your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] face is growing as white as a silver birch, from loss of sleep o' nights." "Why, John, how you talk! I'm sure Yorpy never cries; never, I mean, worth talking of." As the mother spoke she pressed the unhappy little youngster somewhat too closely to her bosom, and he awoke with one of those discordant outbreaks of infant passion with which the hopeful scions of humanity sometimes test the comforts of married life. "Baby---why, baby---there---there now! what will it have? does it want to see brother Ben? Hush---hush---he's coming with something for baby! Hush, now, darling! Will it have this?" "Why, Bet, my dear," said the father, "don't give the brat Ben's powder-horn to play with; for thof he does like you as much as he did my first missus, his own mother and flesh and blood, the lad doesn't love to have his hunting-tools discomboborated. God's weather! where can the tormented chap be staying? he ought to be home by this time." With these words he walked to the door, and stood for a moment commenting upon the mildness of the night, and wondering why Ben did not return. But the mother was too much engaged in soothing the infant, by rocking him to and fro in her arms, to reply. "Now don't, don't, gal," continued the kind-hearted woodsman, turning from the door, which he left open; "you'll tire yourself to death. Let me take him---there, now---there," said he, as she relinquished the child to his arms; and, addressing the last words to the poor, perverse little thing, he walked [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] up and down the room with it, vainly trying to lull its gust of passion or peevishness. "Hush! you little varmint, you!" said the father at last, growing impatient; "hush! or I'll call in the Indians to carry you off---I will." The settler was just turning in his walk, near the open threshold, as he uttered the ill-omened words, when a swarthy hand, reaching over his shoulder, clutched the child from his arms, and brained it against the door-post in the same moment that the tomahawk of another savage struck him to the floor. A dozen painted demons sprang over his prostrate body into the centre of the room. The simple scene of domestic joy, but a moment before so sheltered and homelike, was changed on the instant. The mummied nursling was flung upon the embers near the feet of its frantic mother, who slipped and fell in the blood of her husband as she plucked her child from the coals and sprang toward the door. It was a blow of mercy, though not meant as such, which dismissed her spirit as she struggled to rise with her lifeless burden. The embers of the fire soon strewed the apartment, while the savages danced among them with the mad glee of the devil's own children, until the smoke and blaze, ascending to the roof-tree, drove them from the scene of their infernal orgies. The next day's sun shone upon that mouldering ruin as brightly as if unconscious of the horrors which its light revealed. So complete had been the devastation of the flames, that little but ashes now remained; and the blue smoke curled up [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] among the embowering trees as gently as if it rose only from a cottager's hospitable fire. The oriole, perched upon a cedar-top, whistled as usual to his mate, swinging in his nest upon the pendent branches of a willow which had been planted by the ill-fated settler near a spring not far from his door; while the cat-bird from the brier-thicket replied in mocking notes more blithe and clearer than those he aimed to imitate. The swallow only, driven from her nest in the eaves, and whirling in disordered flight around the place, seemed in sharp cries to sympathize with the desolation which had come over it. There was one human mourner, however, amid the scene. A youth of sixteen sat with his head buried in his hands upon a fallen tree hard by. So still and motionless he seemed, that his form might almost be thought to have been carved out of the gray wood, with which his faded garments assimilated in colour. It would not be difficult to surmise what passed in the bosom of the young forester as at last, after rising with an effort, he advanced to the funeral pyre of his household, and, turning over the dry embers, disengaged a half-burned cloven skull from among them. He threw himself upon the grass and bit the ground with a fierce agony, that showed some self-reproach must be mingled with his sorrow. "My father! my father!" he cried, writhing in anguish; "why---why did I not come home at once, when I heard that the Black Wolf had gone north with his band!" A burst of tears seemed to relieve him for a moment; and then, with greater bitterness [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] than ever, he resumed, "Fool---thrice accursed fool that I was! I might have known that he would strike for these mountains, instead of taking the Sacondaga route, where the Palatine-Yaegars were out and on the watch for him. To die so like a brute in the hands of a butcher, without one word of warning! to be burned like a woodchuck in his hole! stricken to death without a chance of dealing one blow for his defence! My father! my poor father! Oh, God! I cannot bear it!" But the youth knew not the self-renovating spirit of life's spring-time, when he thought that his first sorrow, bitter as it was, would blast his manhood for ever. A first grief never blights the heart of man. The sapling hickory may be bowed---may be shattered by the storm---but it has an elasticity and toughness of fibre that keep it from perishing. It is only long exposure to a succession of harsh and biting winds that steals away its vigour, drinks up its sap of life, and sends a chill at last to the roots which nourished its vitality. That day of cruel wo, like all others, had an end for the young forester; and, when the waning moon rose upon the scene of his ruined home, her yellow light disclosed the boy kneeling upon the sod wherewith he had covered up the bones of his only earthly relatives. She, too, was sole witness to the vow of undying vengeance which he swore upon the spot against the whole race of red men. There are but too many traditions surviving in this region to prove the fulfilment of this fearful vow. But I leave the dire feats of "Bloody Ben," by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] which name only is the avenger now remembered, to some annalist who finds greater pleasure than I do in such horrible details. My business here is only to describe the first deed by which he requited the murderous act of the Indians. The seasons had twice gone their round since destruction had come over the house of the settler, and his son had never yet revisited the spot, which, with the exuberant growth of an American soil, had partly relapsed into its native wildness, from the tangled vines and thickets which had overgrown the clearing. The strong arm of the government had for a while driven the Indians beyond the reach of private vengeance; but now they were again returning to their favourite hunting-ground north of the Mohawk, and around the sources of the Hudson. Some even had ventured into Albany to dispose of their packs and skins, and carry back a supply of powder and other necessaries of the hunter of the wilderness. It was two of these that the orphan youth dogged from the settlements, on their way through the northern forests, to the spot where his oath of vengeance had been recorded. The sequel may best be told in the words of an old hunter, under whose guidance I made my first and only visit to the Dead Clearing. "It was about two o'clock of a hot August afternoon that Ben, after thus following up their trail for three days, came upon the two Injuns jist where the moose-runway makes an opening in the forest, and lets the light down upon you willow that still flourishes beside the old hemlock. The Injuns were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] sitting beneath the willow, thinking themselves sheltered by the rocky bank opposite, and a mass of underwood which had shot up round the top of an oak, which had been twisted off in a tornado in some former day, and then lay imbedded in weeds beneath the knoll. But a few yards from this bank, in that thicket round the roots of yon mossy old beech, Ben found a shelter, from which, at any moment, he could creep up and cover either with his fire from behind the knoll. But, as he had only a one-barrel piece, it required full as cool a hand as his to wait and take both the creeturs at one shot. Bloody Ben, though, was jist the chap to do it. Like enough he waited there, or manoeuvred round, for an hour to get his chance, which did come at last, howsumdever. The Injuns, who, in their own way, are mighty talkers, you must know---that is, when they have really something to talk about---got into some argerment, wherein figures, about which they know mighty little, were concerned. One took out his scalping-knife to make marks upon the earth to help him; while the other trying to make matters clearer with the aid of his fingers, their heads came near each other jist as you may have seen those of white people when they get parroiching right in airnest. So they argufied and they counted, getting nearer and nearer as they became more eager, till their skulls, almost touching, came within the exact range of Ben's rifle: and then Ben, he ups and sends the ball so clean through both, that it buried itself in a sapling behind them. And that, I think, was pretty well for the first shot of a lad of eighteen; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] Bloody Ben himself never confessed to making a better one afterward." The tourist, who should now seek the scene of this adventure, would, perhaps, look in vain for the graceful exotic that once marked the spot. The weeping willow, which was only a thrifty sapling when the Indians met their death beneath its fatal shade, was changed into an old decayed trunk, with but one living branch, when I beheld it; and a ponderous vine was rapidly strangling the life from this decrepit limb. The hardy growth of the native forest had nearly obliterated the improvements of the pioneer. The wild animals, in drinking from the spring hard by, had dislodged the flat stones from its brink; tall weeds waved amid the spreading pool; and the fox had made his den in the rocky knoll upon whose side once stood the settler's cabin of The Dead Clearing . Upon the return of the party, the close of evening found us seated around the fire discussing the day's sport, while the older hunters enlightened those less versed in woodcraft with the detail of various feats and adventures, of which, in bygone days, the forests around us had been the scene, and themselves the heroes. Moose, panther, and bear hunting were their favourite themes; and I took an opportunity, when the latter was mentioned, to ask the old Indian, who was the most intelligent of the party, if any "grizzly bears" had ever been found in this region, as some naturalists have asserted. His reply indi [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] cated that there was a tradition of that ferocious animal being known to his ancestors, by whom its race was said to have been extirpated. The information was, however, so mixed up with what was evidently fable, that it was impossible to tell how much of his account was true; and not the least extravagant portion of it was imbodied in a story to which I have already alluded, the strange tissue of which I can by no means recall to my own satisfaction. [13] These mountains are the eastern spurs of the Adirondach group. [ A Legend of Tseka Lake . [14] Alas! when he told of the flinty heel That trampled his tribesmen down in wrath, To the hearts of flint would he make appeal, That saw them swept from the white man's path! They who have hunted over the wild lands that lie between the sources of Moose River on the west, and the Talking Water,  where it falls into the northern branch of the great Mohegan on the east, tell of certain strange forms, resembling men, that appear to be carved out of the solid rock, as they stand like sentinels along the shores of some of the lakes which are so numerous in this region. The stunted hemlocks, which are occasionally rifted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] among their fissures, and the wild vines that here and there are tangled among their groups, prevents a close examination of their shape; and some white people insist that these upright rocks bear little or no resemblance to the human figure. But it is probable that they who undertake to speak thus positively upon the subject, have never seen the particular cliffs with which the Indian hunter is familiar; and which, though with the lapse of every year assuming more and more the aspect of the common rocks around them, still preserve so much of their original appearance as to be easily identified. Few, however, would suspect that these mute forms were once animated, and gifted with powers of destruction proportionate to their huge size; and yet, if tradition can be believed, such was formerly the case. The wars with Otne-yar-heh lasted for many generations before they were utterly subdued and reduced to their present harmless condition; and the century of continual conflicts with Ononthio (the French) was not half so destructive to the warriors of the Aganuschion [15] as a single battle with these monsters. It was on the shores of the Tseka Lake that they were first discovered; though some say that they came originally from the great salt water, and had cut their way through the Mahikanders and other river tribes, up to this point. But they who talk thus confound these giants with a band of strangers that were destroyed upon this lake the year before, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] whose bodies afterward became, as it were, the shells in which these monsters were hatched. These wanderers had encamped upon the sandbeach of Tseka, about a gunshot from the cove where the inlet of Oxbow Lake flows from it into the swamp that lies between them: being discovered, they were set upon by a war-party of the Aganuschion on its way to strike a blow at the Abenaquis. The warriors of the confederacy, mistaking them for Hurons or some other hostile band of the north, attacked them with such fury, that every one of their number was either killed or wounded before the headlong assailants could be brought to a parley. It was then discovered, when too late, that they had never been among the foes of the Five-Nations, and were, in fact, strangers, of whom no one could give an account. The assailing party were overcome with confusion; but the victims of their rashness were so completely cut up, that sympathy was of no avail, and they were wholly at a loss what to do with the wounded survivers. They had not a single "medicine-man" in their own party to assist them on the spot; and, if they undertook to carry the strangers back to their own towns, they must have perished on the way; while the delay would be fatal to the enterprise upon which these fierce warriors had left their homes. Some proposed to tomahawk those of the strangers who were most badly wounded, to put them out of their pain, and to carry forward the others upon the expedition. This, however, was strenuously opposed by the hot-headed young men upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] whom the task of carrying the disabled would have fallen: and, after several other propositions had been made with the same effect, it was determined to leave the victims to their fate upon the spot where their calamity had overtaken them. The vengeance of the Master of Life was as summary as it was enduring. That war-party marched on its way, and reached the Cadaraqui, but not one of their number ever after returned to the lodges of the Aganuschion; while for many a long year their tribesmen suffered for the judgment they had brought upon their people, and the butchered strangers were made the instruments of the punishment. The bleeding band, left with their raw wounds upon the open beach, would crawl to the water's edge to quench the thirst that consumed them; and then, as they suffered new anguish in reviving for a moment, they would roll and twist upon the sand, until, adhering to the gore that covered them, the flinty particles covered the whole surface of their bodies; and, as their limbs stiffened in death, congealed almost like solid rock around them. But their cruel thirst remained to the last. And they drank and drank, until each one expired where he lay; while their bodies and limbs became swollen into frightful bulk before they gasped out their last breath. The winter, which soon set in, preserved these crusted remains from decay; and when the snows, which are very deep and lasting in this mountain region, had subsided, each stark and grim corpse had gained still more in size; while the waves of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] lake, in washing its shells and pebbles over them, appeared, in the lapse of a few months, to have turned the giant sleepers into solid masses of stone. This was not the case, however, as the grizzly bears knew full well when the last troop of these monsters, driven from the low country by the hunters of the Iroquois, scented them for prey upon that shore. At first, however, their prize availed them nothing; for the bodies were so protected by their shell of stone, that it seemed impossible to get at them. But the grizzly bear is the keenest hunter of his kind, and, when half famished as now, his cunning is equal to his strength. These animals then commenced at the soles of the feet, where the hard casing was thinnest, and, being of a supple nature, they eat their way forward until the body and limbs of each were completely enclosed within those gigantic moulds. The bears at first wished to withdraw from their strange dwellings, thinking after all they might be nothing but some new kind of traps which their enemies had been setting for them: but, in struggling to turn round, they found that the flinty casing upon their limbs yielded so to each motion, that, provided they only stood erect, they could walk as formerly. And then it was that, for the first time, he who looked upon that shore would have seen those unearthly monsters raising themselves one by one from the ground, until, tall as a thrifty pine, with frames proportioned to their height, and cased from head to heel in shining flint, the terrible band of the Otne-yar-heh was marshalled by their leader. "My brothers," said the chief, in a voice that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] sounded like the wind rushing through a mighty cavern, "we are not tortoises, though we have shells; nor need we wait here until our enemies set the swamp on fire and smoke us out like musk-rats! Let us move to the lodges of the Aganuschion, and see how they will receive us." The woods cracked as if a tornado had been let loose among them as the hard-heeled giants strode from mountain to mountain, crushing the stoutest saplings like rushes beneath their feet. Their trail was as broad as that of a gang of moose; but the trampled and twisted trees lay so thick upon it, that man with mortal limbs could never have followed upon their path. Straight as the flight of a pigeon was the road they took. The swollen torrent or dizzy precipice was no obstacle to their footsteps; they stepped from the tall crag or stalked through the raging stream with equal ease. The trees which their leader trampled beneath him, afforded a firm passage for his followers over the deep morass, and they waded the lakes in storm and tempest, while the waves that lashed their sides as they advanced, broke into foam against their rocky ribs as if it were the very mountain cliffs that opposed them. What could the warriors of the Five-Nations do against such an enemy? They were not then, indeed, though they hunted and fought together, a united people; and the wars with the Stone Giants, devastating as they were, were at least the cause of one happy event, in giving rise to the league that was formed against them, and producing in the Aganuschion a race of men that surpasses all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] others. [16] But hundreds of brave men were destroyed before this grand end was accomplished, and the Mohawks and Oneidas, who met the first descent of the Otne-yar-heh, were vanquished again and again in battle. Their weapons seemed to produce no effect upon their terrible opponents. They tried first to cut off the chief of the band, but their arrows would rattle like hail against his marble hide; and when a score of hatchets at a time were aimed at his head, though they made the fire shower from its flinty hood as if a flame-stone from the moon  were bursting near, yet it seemed to produce no effect upon the giant. At length it was determined that all the chief men of the Five-Nations should meet at Onondaga, in order to take measures for acting in concert against the common enemy; and then that famous league was formed, whose power for centuries afterward was acknowledged alike by the white and red man, wherever its name was know. Tradition has preserved no exact record of the mode of warfare it was then determined to employ against the Stone Giants; but it is generally believed that the Master of Life himself looked so benignantly upon the councils of this band of brothers, that he interposed his arm to shelter so heroic a people from destruction. It is said that he sent his lightnings among the Otne-yar-heh, which drove them back to the glens from which they first [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] emerged, and, drawing there a circle of thunderbolts around the unhallowed region, so that no game ever traversed it, the Stone Giants perished in the fastnesses where they had sought a refuge. Their only traces are now the uncouth forms of rock that are scattered here and there among these hills, and those monstrous shapes which, as your paddle divides the water, may be seen looking up at you from the bottom of more than one of our deep lakes: nor since that time has a grizzly bear been seen within a hundred miles of these lakes; and the last of the race is supposed to have animated the forms, and perished with the band of the Otne-yar-heh . "God's weather!" cried the major, when the story was ended, "but I have never seen those sculptured rocks of which the old fellow tells us, and I know every stone of the size of a flint in the country." Captain Gill replied to the discredit that was thus thrown upon his narrative, only with a look of scorn at the party who thus sought to disparage it; but a young Iroquois hunter took up the matter more feelingly, by observing that the white man never saw with the same eyes as the Indian, and that the traces of "The Spirit," alike in trees, and stones, and running streams, were never discovered by him who only studied how he could best turn these objects to purposes the very reverse of those for which Owaneyo intended them. "Well, well," said the major, good-naturedly, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] "you are more than half right, young un; for what with mining among the mountains, damming the rivers, and turning the timber into shingles, they will soon play the mischief with all the trout and deer in the country. But we've had enough of Injun matters now; I want a story with a gal in it. By your leave, sir," added he, turning to my friend, the Counsellor, "we've not had a word from you yet, though, being a lawyer, you ought to be as slick with your tongue as you are with your rifle. Here's the last night we are to be together---the very last, perhaps, you will ever spend in the woods with old Jake Peabody; so do turn us out something nice in the way of a story, something that has plenty of women in it; for, thof we never see the creeturs in these parts, we like to hear about 'em sometimes." Thus eloquently besought, my friend could not but comply; and, promising that he would take the major at his word, and make the story entirely about women, he related the particulars of a remarkable lawcase, which are imbodied in the following version of "The Counsellor's Story." [14] A large and beautiful sheet of water, lying a few miles to the south-west of Lake Pleasant and Sacondaga Lake, in Hamilton County, New York. Its name is sometimes written Pseka, and more often Piseka .  Commonly called "Jessup's River," a famous trouting brook, that forms one of the tributaries of the Hudson. [15] Thus the confederated Five-Nations called themselves.--- Clinton's Discourse before the New York Historical Society  .

"Men have died, and worms have eaten them, But not for love." So saith the poet! meaning by his speech not men in a numeric sense---not mankind at large, but only the males of the genus homo . Shakspeare, perhaps, was right in regard to men; but had he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] spoken of women, he would have told a different story. Love, indeed, is "the worm i' the bud," which hath devoured the life-germ in many a female bosom, leaving only a frail and hollow shell for death to crush between his iron fingers. Truly hath Byron said, that "woman's love is a fearful and dangerous thing;" for it is both mystical in its birth and perilous in its being. It maketh realities out of a shadow. It linketh things unsubstantial with things real, until they become part of woman's very being, making a tangible substance of that which is in its nature "an essence incorporeal"---rooting its fibres in the heart, and interweaving them with the very filament and texture of the brain. The personal memories of former times, not less than the periodicals of our own day, are rife with records proving this. But one of the most extraordinary instances of misplaced affection, clinging to its object until reason was extinct, is one which, though often repeated in society, has never yet, to our knowledge, found its way into print. I allude to the singular story of Miss     , (the Rosalie Clare of our tale,) the niece of that eccentric old tory, Mrs. C    , of Nova Scotia, who, after emigrating to New Brunswick during the revolution, made herself so conspicuous in our courts of law, when she returned hither to recover some forfeited estates, about the year 179---. The family is, I believe, now extinct; and I have, therefore, less hesitation in speaking here of events which must already be familiar to many of my readers. The estates, to recover which Mrs. C. embarked [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] in such expensive litigation, were claimed only in behalf of her son, to whom they had been devised by the will of his maternal grandfather. With regard to the identity of this son, there were strange surmises abroad from the moment he landed with his supposed mother in New York. It seems that Mrs. C., when she retired to Nova Scotia at the breaking out of the revolution, had carried her two orphan children with her from their native city. These were a little girl, and a boy still in petticoats, and one of them never reached their destination. The child was lost overboard at sea; and, when the vessel landed, the provincial papers announced the melancholy loss which Mrs. C. had met with in the untimely fate of her only daughter. Such a misfortune, one would think, were enough to gratify the vindictiveness of the old lady's enemies, at least for a season; yet there were many who had the malice to whisper doubts as to which of the two children had actually perished. "It was easy, amid the confusion of the times," said they, "for one leading so unsettled a life as Mrs. C., to find, in her various journeyings, some male infant of similar age, which she might readily substitute for the lost heir. She had then only to keep the daughter out of the way, and his fortune was made." This gossip, however, was soon swallowed up by more exciting themes; and when, years afterward, Mrs. C. appeared in New York with a handsome youth of eighteen, whom she called her son, those were few who hinted that the boy was hers only by adoption, and that Mrs. C. had done what history proves has often been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] attempted in the assertion of higher claims than hers---namely, to pass off the son of another as her own. Young Ludlow C., so was the youth called, was not the less popular, however, on account of such surmises, if they did exist. He was a young man of exceeding beauty and accomplished manners, with a voice gentle and soft as a woman's, and an eye brilliant with all the fire of opening manhood. His, indeed, was just the union of qualities that most readily captivate the female fancy. He had that high flow of spirits which is often mistaken for talent in youth, and which is generally so attractive to those who are thrown much in the society of the fortunate possessor. This constitutional blessing gave him an agreeableness which those who know more of the subject than I affect to I know, aver as all-important in pleasing the sex. But agreeableness, however it may entertain, is not the quality to interest a woman; and young C. had another arrow in his sheaf, which, perhaps, flew the farther from being seldom shot. There was at times a shade of sadness about him---a melancholy so deep and absorbing, that it made the subject of this altered mood differ for a season not less from himself than he did at other times from all around him. This, as the cause of the depression was wholly unknown, threw a veil of mystery over his character, and completed the list of lover-like qualities which are the source of so much bedevilment to girls of nineteen; and nineteen was just the age of Rosalie Clare when for the first time she became acquainted with her all-conquering cousin. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] Some female writer has said that none of her sex reach the age of sixteen without having had at least one affair of the heart. If there were ever an exception to the rule, it was in the case of Rosalie Clare. Love, like wonder, is half the time the child of ignorance. It is an exhalation that springs from young hearts, and settles upon the nearest object, however unsuited by character or "imperfect sympathies," as Charles Lamb expresses it, to inspire or to reciprocate true affection. Perhaps there is no greater protection against these idle fancies than the placing those who may become the subject of them, early in the world of reality. Rosalie, as the only female of her father's family, had been thrown into society so early that she could hardly remember the time when she had not been surrounded by admirers. A petted and half-spoiled child of six or seven, she had often taken her mother's place, and sat in mock dignity at the head of her father's table; while, as a girl of twelve, she had habitually done the honours of his house during the time that New York was occupied by the British troops. Living thus in the very vortex of gay society, and surrounded by the handsome cavaliers, who are only known in the day-dreams of girls of her age, imagination had never a chance to act. She became habituated to the compliments and attentions of the other sex before the feelings of womanhood began to assert themselves in her bosom; and the flatteries which had always been received as a matter of course by the forward child of twelve, made no impression on the blooming girl of seventeen. Some dispositions would have been entirely [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] ruined by such an education, whose tendency would seem to make the whole character artificial. It was not thus, however, with Rosalie Clare, whose candid and happy temperament resembled one of those easily-raised plants that seem to flourish equally well in the conservatory or the parterre, adapting themselves alike to the free exposure of the atmosphere or the measured heat of the forcing-house; and exhibiting all their characteristic properties in either situation. Such natures must be either very superior to, or below, the general standard. They are either so elevated as to be independent of circumstances, or so common that no training can much alter or improve them; and so far as mind is concerned, it must be confessed that Rosalie did not soar above the latter class. Yet, while the ill-natured observer might have confounded her with those of her sex whom Pope tells us "have no character at all," her fond and most unchanging affectionateness of disposition would, not less than her rare beauty, have entitled her to sit for the original of any of Byron's heroines but Gulnare. It was this affectionateness, this disposition to cling to, and rely upon, whatever seemed loveable and reliable, that made Rosalie become attached to her cousin almost from the moment she knew him. The nearness of their relationship, united to the frank, winning manners of Ludlow, was an immediate passport to her confidence. The idea of regarding him as a lover she did not dream of, but they were friends from the moment they met. There would, indeed, be occasionally some little interchange of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] lively sensibilities between them, but it could hardly be otherwise with two young persons of different sexes, who were thrown so continually together. If Rosalie ever thought of the tendency of such an intercourse when she was rallied about it by others, she always had an answer which fully satisfied herself. Ludlow was scarcely a year older than herself, and was, therefore, "a boy," with whom it was no harm to be upon the easiest terms of familiar acquaintance. Besides, was he not her cousin? a first cousin! and where's the harm of a good-humoured flirtation with a cousin? if flirtation it might indeed be called. Yet it was strange that Rosalie Clare did not like cousin Ludlow to flirt with any one else but her! "What! cousin, you are not going to dance again with that horrid Laura T. to-night?" said she, pettishly, laying her hand upon our hero's arm as he passed her in a crowded ball-room. "And why not, Rosalie? I am engaged to walk a minuet with Miss T., and you know it is impossible now to withdraw." "Why, you have hardly spoken to me yet to-night, Ludlow!" The youth answered only by taking a single flower from the bouquet which the beaux of that day wore in their button-holes, and gracefully placing it in the high head-dress of the pretty pleader. The next moment he took the hand of his partner, the band struck up the inspiriting gavotte , and he stepped off in the featly minuet with an air that would have done honour to a courtier of Versailles; while, half [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] pleased and half provoked, his deserted cousin looked on with the admiring crowd. This was but one of a thousand little passages between the cousins that marked the progress of a flirtation which soon assumed the appearance of a serious entanglement. And now one would have thought that some coolness had arisen between them--- they met, comparatively, so seldom. The air of Ludlow, too, when they did meet, was absent and dejected, as he walked by the side of the radiant girl, who rattled away with all the thoughtless vivacity of a triumphant belle who has the preferred admirer of her train for a listener. Rosalie, however, had also her hours of listlessness, if not of dejection; and while her cousin lost his wonted flow of spirits when with her, she, on the contrary, seemed happy only in his society. Nor did Rosalie want for other lovers; as that little ballad which goes by her name, and which may not inaptly be introduced here, to show how her beauty fired the gallants of the day, is a genuine record of the otherwise forgotten belle. Who owns not she's peerless? who calls her not fair? Who questions the beauty of Rosalie Clare? Let him saddle his courser and spur to the field, And, though harnessed in proof, he must perish or yield; For no gallant can splinter, no charger may dare, The lance that is couched for young Rosalie Clare. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] When goblets are flowing, and wit at the board Sparkles high, while the blood of the red grape is poured, And fond wishes for fair ones around offered up From each lip that is wet with the dew of the cup--- What name on the brimmer floats oftener there, Or is whispered more warmly, than Rosalie Clare? They may talk of the land of the olive and vine--- Of the maids of the Ebro, the Arno, or Rhine; Of the Houris that gladden the east with their smiles, Where the sea's studded over with green summer isles; But what flower of far-away clime can compare With the blossom of ours---bright Rosalie Clare? Who owns not she's peerless? who calls her not fair? Let him meet but the glances of Rosalie Clare! Let him list to her voice---let him gaze on her form--- And, if hearing and seeing, his soul do not warm, Let him go breathe it out in some less happy air Than that which is blessed by sweet Rosalie Clare! It was to her, too, during some desponding moment, that a forgotten provincial poet addressed that lively impromptu that we have more than once seen copied in the albums of our fair acquaintance, by some admirer who would rally their pettishness in the language of another. TO A BELLE WHO TALKED OF GIVING UP THE WORLD. You give up the world? Why, as well might the sun, When tired of drinking the dew from the flowers, While his rays, like young hopes, stealing off one by one, Die away with the Muezzin's last note from the towers, Declare that he never would gladden again, With one rosy smile, the young morn in its birth; But leave weeping Day, with her sorrowful train Of hours, to grope o'er a pall-covered earth. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] The light of that soul, once so brilliant and steady, So far can the incense of flattery smother, That at thought of the world of hearts conquered already, Like Macedon's madman, you weep for another! Oh! if, sated with this, you would seek worlds untried, And fresh as was ours, when first we began it, Let me know but the sphere where you next will abide, And that instant, for one, I am off for that planet. But all this idolatry of the gay world was unheeded by her who cared for one only worshipper; and a careless little song of her cousin's, which we have seen as copied out in the faded characters of Rosalie's own fair hand, was dearer to her than all the more elaborate compliments of others; for she, fond girl, imagined that none other than herself had inspired Ludlow's muse when he ventured upon so confident a strain as that which prompts the conceits of the following I know thou dost love me---ay! frown as thou wilt, And curl that beautiful lip, Which I never can gaze on without the guilt Of burning its dew to sip: I know that my heart is reflected in thine, And, like flowers that over a brook incline, They toward each other dip. Though thou lookest so cold in these halls of light, 'Mid the careless, proud, and gay, I will steal like a thief in thy heart at night, And pilfer its thoughts away. I will come in thy dreams at the midnight hour, And thy soul in secret shall own the power It dares to mock by day. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] Such an affair seldom proceeds far in any circle without there being many who discover its existence, and watch its progress with as lively an interest as if their own welfare were identified with that of the parties chiefly concerned. The two cousins, as time wore on, were not exempted from this disinterested surveillance, and manifold were the speculations about the termination of their loves. There was that in the conduct of Ludlow which puzzled the most acute of these gossips. In the first place, they were certain that he must be conscious of possessing the affections of the guileless Rosalie, whose heart was reflected too faithfully in her speaking countenance to admit of the concealment of its feelings. Ludlow, in the course of six months, must certainly have found out what, in the first six weeks of their acquaintance, was apparent to every one except the lovely and unconscious betrayer of her own gentle emotions. Why, then, did he not claim the hand when the heart was beyond all question his own? True, he was very young, and his precarious fortunes, with the fact of his never having been brought up to any profession, might make his youth an objection when thinking seriously of matrimony. But yet, when other circumstances seemed to remove every real obstacle, why should such fancied impediments be allowed to prevail? They might become engaged at least; and, supposing even that they waited until the family lawsuit was decided, they had still some years of youth to spare, and his cousin's means were sufficiently ample if the cause were decided against Ludlow and his mother. But, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] then, again, did Ludlow love Rosalie? Did he seriously return her attachment; or, if requiting it, did he give up the whole tide of his heart, in all its warmth and fulness, to this one only object? It seemed impossible to tell how far his feelings actually did go. If he thus loved her, there was something unaccountably irresolute, not to say inconsistent, in his conduct. The capricious youth certainly preferred the society of his cousin to that of all other women. Though not apparently enjoying it, he always courted it, or rather, almost without any act of volition on his part, he seemed to find himself constantly near her. He had been seen to watch Rosalie with more than a lover's solicitude, when some of the gay and dissipated young men of his acquaintance hovered round her in society. He listened when they engaged her in conversation, and her slightest tone of kindness filled him with strange agitation. Still, on the other hand, he allowed the most trivial engagement to take him from her company; and it was observable that, though often, of his own accord, addressing Rosalie in terms of affection, he never returned any of those little endearments--- attentions, perhaps, we should rather call them---which a guileless girl cannot help showing toward the man of her choice when deeming herself secure of his affection. It was remarked, too, that none of the reports which were occasionally circulated about Rosalie and her other admirers---for she was still a belle--- seemed to awaken any jealousy in her eccentric cousin. He scrutinized every one who approached [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] her in the guise of a lover; yet his watchfulness was more like the discreet care of an affectionate and considerate brother, than the anxiety of an earnest and passionate admirer. But if he were not such an admirer, what became of Ludlow's honour as a gentleman, what of his principles as a man, when he allowed a dreaming and fond-hearted girl to yield up her whole soul to him, in the delusive belief that he was all hers in return? True, he had never told Rosalie that he loved her. True, he had not even passed those trifling compliments---the light currency of fancy---so often mistaken for the sterling coinage of the heart: yet Rosalie treasured up a thousand little proofs of tenderness---expressions which told, from day to day, how often he thought of her when absent; looks which spoke how much he felt for her when near. How often had she caught herself smiling in her heart at what she believed to be the jealous mood of her lover as he watched her, while talking with others, with that expression of sadness in his eyes which often betokens the overflow of a heart filled up with feeling! He watched her when he spoke not; and when he did speak, his voice took ever a softer tone, that surely was reserved for her alone! There had, then, been no moment when Rosalie had said to herself, "Now, surely, he loves me," for she believed in Ludlow's affection before she ever dreamed the question. Her trust grew from her own heart; it was not founded upon his actions. She loved too sincerely to reason about her own feelings; too devotedly to scan those of her lover. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] It seemed as if they had been always meant for each other, and must, of necessity, be united; and so little could the doting girl conceive the void in her heart which bereaved affection might create, that she looked upon the love of her cousin as something belonging to her from the first, and of right exclusively her own. But the day was now at hand when all that was enigmatical about the character of young Ludlow C. was to be fully solved in the eyes of the world. Mrs. C.'s long-protracted civil suit was at length brought into court. The trial involved a large amount of property, and the celebrity of counsel on both sides had drawn together an unusual assemblage of spectators. It was said that Hamilton would speak; and the name of that great man, already becoming as distinguished at the bar as he had been in the cabinet, had attracted a great many ladies to the court-room in the old City Hall. Among the most beautiful of these---yet peerless in her own loveliness--- might be seen the happy and blooming features of Rosalie Clare. The court was opened, and the trial proceeded, exhibiting but little in its progress to gratify the expectations of the larger part of the audience, who became wearied with the dry and technical details which were minutely entered into by the old-fashioned lawyers, most of whom had studied their profession under the English regime. An incident soon occurred, however, which effectually dispelled the insipidity of this scene, and which can never be forgotten by those who were so situated as fairly to witness the whole circumstance. An exclamation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] of General Hamilton was the first thing that called general attention to what was going forward. Hamilton had as yet taken but little part in the conduct of the cause---leaving the drudgery, perhaps, to some less distinguished member of the profession---while he reserved himself for the cross-examinations and the summing up. At a particular point of the testimony for the C.'s, however, he interrupted the witness upon the stand, by exclaiming, "That is only hearsay evidence: may it please your honour, (rising and bowing to the judge,) this evidence is inadmissible; let the young gentleman alluded to by the witness be himself produced in court." The remark created instant confusion upon the opposite side of the table, at which the counsel were sitting. Old Mrs. C. bustled forward and whispered to her lawyer, who instantly rose and stated to the court that "The son of the plaintiff---the young gentleman alluded to---had left town the evening before, and, as the point in question was quite unimportant, he was willing to waive it in behalf of his client, rather than have the cause delayed until the averment of the person on the stand could be substantiated by what he, the counsel, admitted was the only proper evidence." Mrs. C. in the meantime seemed much agitated, and forthwith despatched a note to Ludlow, who, notwithstanding the statement which had just been made in his name, she believed to be at the moment reading quietly at home. But her message was never doomed to reach that unconscious victim of parental tyranny and all-grasping avarice; for, even [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] while the case in point was still under the advisement of the court, the name of young C. was pronounced by one of the marshals, who, with officious politeness, ushered him to a seat near his mother, within the bar. The announcement of the name caught the quick ear of Hamilton in a moment. "Let that young gentleman take his place on the stand," cried he, with great presence of mind, before his antagonist could recover from the infectious embarrassment into which the confusion of his client, at this untoward appearance, had thrown him. "Swear him, Mr. Clerk." The oath was administered. It probably was the first time that Ludlow had gone through this solemnity, which might account for his seeming perturbed. His eye roamed uneasily around the court, as if in quest of something to rest upon. "Young gentleman, you will please to look me steadily in the face," said the experienced barrister. "Now, sir, the question I am about to ask you affects only a simple act of recollection; and you can, therefore, use what deliberation you please in your reply, provided it be explicit. The witness who has just left that stand, stated that yourself and another person---the name is immaterial---were present when your mother delivered the paper which I hold in my hand to the gentleman who sits opposite to you. Now, without stopping here to identify this third individual, I ask you whether it be true that yourself and another man---" The features of the youth became much agitated, and the examiner, pausing an instant, resumed, as he fixed his eye [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] keenly upon him---"I say, another person and yourself---" Ludlow was again reassured, but only to be more completely overwhelmed the next moment; as the deliberate lawyer, interrupting himself again to remind the witness of the solemnity of his oath, at last brought the question out in a shape that admitted of no prevarication---"Answer me, in a monosyllable, Ay! or No! were there, when your mother so delivered that paper to the gentleman who received it, two other MEN present, and were you, or were you not, one of those---MEN?" The last words were pronounced with a significant whisper, that was heard in every part of the crowded court-room. The witness hesitated for a moment, and turned deadly pale. His lips were slightly convulsed, as if unable to syllable the words his tongue would fain record. His mother leaned forward with clasped hands and an appealing, agonized expression, that was wholly indescribable. The youth caught her eager and anxious eye, uttered an indistinct cry, and fainted upon the spot. "Stand back!---stand back!" cried the agitated mother; "my child! my child! let me take care of my own child!" And she struggled through the crowd to get near the insensible object of her anxiety. "One moment, madam," exclaimed the lawyer, feelingly, but with firmness, as he stretched across the table and held her back with an air that was not the less decided from being perfectly respectful. "Dr. Hosack already has his hand upon the pulse of the youth, and the swoon will be over the moment [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] his lungs have play." And even as he spoke, the physician had thrown open the frilled bosom of poor Rosalie's lover, while a cry of astonishment filled the court as the fair and feminine proportions of a beautiful WOMAN were disclosed! It has never been known exactly what became of the accomplished female who so long figured in the society of New York under the name of Ludlow C. Few thought it strange, however, knowing the eccentric and unprincipled character of old Mrs. C., that she should thus have trained her only daughter to play an unconsciously dishonest part in her legal intrigues. As for the mere fact of a girl thus acting in male character upon the theatre of life, the example of the celebrated Chevalier D'Eon had found too many imitators, both among ladies of the best families in Europe and among the enthusiastically patriotic of her sex in our own country, to make this feature of the case at all remarkable. [17] And what became of poor Rosalie Clare?---she whose kind and gentle heart had withstood so many assaults from the other sex, only to be yielded up at last to the delicate arts of a spoiler of her own. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] false lover, who doted upon her like a sister, is said to have had all the painful emotions which her career might well have excited, swallowed up in contrition for the ruin she had so unintentionally wrought upon the happiness of the confiding Rosalie; but the heart of that unfortunate had been too completely thrown away ever to be recalled, or again to beat aright. Her brain was either blasted by the sudden blow, or else it became so perverted that she could never fully comprehend the circumstances by which she was overwhelmed, so as to reconcile them to each other, and think rationally upon the subject. In a word, her mind, which had never been a strong one, was broken completely. The presence of her cousin, who, for some weeks, was not withdrawn by her mother from the scene of her disgrace, seemed only to increase the malady. She shrank from her nursing and feminine endearments as if they were the caresses of a monster; yet she was observed to listen to her masculine step upon the stair, and hail her approach with eagerness; while her colour would come and go when she heard her voice in another room, as if its tones awakened her softer sensibilities. But when "Ludlow," as she still called her cousin, was forbidden by the physicians to see her more, and Rosalie was told that she had embarked with her mother, for another land, the spirit of the faded and pining girl sank completely, and her mind lost its last gleams of intelligence. Happy would it have been for her then if death had intervened to close the scene! But no! the resources of an excellent constitution did not yet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] give way, and Rosalie Clare, for many a long year, still lived on. But how? Reader, were you ever at the Bloomingdale Asylum? Did you ever look down into the enclosure, where the unhappy inmates may be seen at a certain hour amusing themselves as each one listeth? Did you ever look in vain among that motley crew for the piteous, yet picturesque, air of distraction with which poets and painters have so often gifted the maniac? You have gazed there in vain, if you hoped to find the romantic madness of a Hamlet or an Ophelia! And yet, among those common-looking creatures---for all human creatures do look common when the spirit of mind that once ennobled their forms hath departed, and left them animated only by the instincts of sense---among those common-looking creatures are many who have once been the loveliest of the land. Ay! among those who are at this moment gathered in that very yard is one who---But mark her as she sits crouched in yon sunny corner! Those livid and sunken eyes have once matched heaven's own blue in colour, as they beamed with heavenly purity and feeling! The fresh-blooming rose, in fulness, and softness, and colour, was once rivalled by that sallow and shrivelled cheek! Freely did the eloquent blood--- though disease hath now "Starved the roses on that cheek, And pinched the lily tincture of her skin," freely did it once course through the blue veins of those shrunken temples! Those leaden lips--- fevered---withered as they are---they--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] But why dwell upon this appalling picture? The original was but now before us in all the light of youth and loveliness. Alas! that the copy, so strangely disfigured, should still be true to all that remains of poor Rosalie Clare! Reader, if thou knowest what woman's love is, thou wilt not wonder that one who had thus wooed a cloud, could not be released from its embrace without being scathed by its lightning. "Well," said Major Jake, when the Counsellor had ended the narration, (which he gave in language relishing still more of "the intensive school" than that which I have ventured to adopt,) "that is indeed a raal gal story. It's nothing but gal---as the fellow said down in Herkimer, when his wife brought him a twentieth daughter! And now let's take a cup all round, swear etarnal friendship, and bid good-by, in case we separate to take an early start to home in the morning." And thus end my early reminiscences of the Sacondaga country. I have frequently been there since, upon a trouting excursion, but the gay idlers of Saratoga Springs have broken in upon those mountain fastnesses. The speculators have got hold of the sixpenny acres; old Captain Gill has been many years dead, and none of the new people remember "Major Jake," who is likewise no more: nor should I, perhaps, have attempted to recall their memory, if my recent visit to the other branches of the Hudson, recalling those early days on the Sacondaga, had not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf154v1&image=154-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] awakened a vivid recollection of scenes which, enjoyed when life was new, possess far more interest for me in association than I can hope they will have for others.
