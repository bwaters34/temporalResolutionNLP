 enervate the irresolute and administer disease, are introduced by commerce; the extent of the benefits which attend it are also to be considered, ere the man of cool reason will venture to pronounce that mankind are injured, are rendered less virtuous and less happy by the increase of Commerce. If a view of the state of mankind, where Commerce opens no intercourse between nation and nation be neglected, unjust conclusions will certainly follow. Where the state of barbarians and of countries under the different degrees of civilization are candidly weighed, we may reasonably expect a just decision. As evidently as the appointment of Nature gives pasture to the herds, as evidently is man born for society. As every other animal is in its natural state when in the situation which its instinct requires; so man, when his reason is cultivated, is then, and only then, in the state proper to his nature. The life of the naked savage, who feeds on acorns and sleeps like a beast in his den, is commonly called the natural state of man; but if there be any propriety in this assertion, his rational faculties compose no part of his nature, and were given not to be used. If the savage therefore live in a state contrary to the appointment of nature, it must follow that he is not so happy as nature intended him to be. And a view of his true character will confirm this conclusion. The reveries, the fairy dreams of a Rousseau, may figure the paradisial life of a Hottentot, but it is only in such dreams that the happiness of the barbarian exists. The savage, it is true, is reluctant to leave his manner of life; but unless we allow that he is a proper judge of the modes of living, his attachment to his own by no means proves that he is happier than he might otherwise have been. His attachment only exemplifies the amazing power of habit in reconciling the human breast to the most uncomfortable situations. If the intercourse of mankind in some instances be introductive of vice, the want of it as certainly excludes the exertion of the noblest virtues; and if the seeds of virtue are indeed in the heart, they often lie dormant, and unknown even to the savage possessor. The most beautiful description of a tribe of savages, which we may be assured is from real life, occurs in these words; And the five spies of Dan " came to Laish, and saw the people that were there, how they dwelt careless after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure, and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing . ... And the spies said to their brethren, Arise, that we may go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold it is very good. ... and they came unto Laish, unto a people that were quiet and secure, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire; and there was no Deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man \---However the happy simplicity of this society may please the man of fine imagination, the true philosopher will view the men of Laish with other eyes. However virtuous he may suppose one generation, the children of the next were sure to sink into every vice of brutality. When his wants are easily supplied, the manners of the savage will be simple, and often humane, for the human heart is not vicious without objects of temptation. But these will soon occur; he that gathers the greatest quantity of fruit will be envied by the less industrious: The human passions will operate, and where there is no magistrate to put to shame in any thing, depredation will soon display all its horrors. And could such a tribe be secured from the consequences of their own unrestrained passions, could even this impossibility be surmounted, still are they a wretched prey to the first invaders, and because they have no business with any man, they will find no deliverer. While human nature is the same, the fate of Laish will always be the fate of the weak and defenceless; and thus the most amiable description of savage life, raises in our minds the strongest imagery of the misery and impossible continuance of such a state. But if the view of Laish then terminate in horror, with what contemplation shall we behold the wilds of Africa and America? Immense tracts peopled by a few tribes scattered at great distances, who esteem and treat each other as beasts of the chace. Attachment to their own tribe constitutes their highest idea of virtue; but this virtue includes the most brutal depravity, makes them consider the man of every other tribe as one with whom nature had placed them in a state of war, and had commanded to destroy  1 . And to this principle their customs and ideas of honour serve as rituals and ministers. The ancient cruelties practised by the American savages on their prisoners of war (and war was their chief employment) convey every idea expressed by the word diabolical, and give a most shocking view of the degradation of human nature. But what peculiarly completes the character of the savage, is his horrible superstition. In the most distant nations the savage is in this the same. The terror of evil spirits continually haunts him, and his God is beheld as a relentless tyrant, and is worshipped often with cruel rites, always with a heart full of horror and fear. In all the numerous accounts of savage worship, one trace of filial dependance is not to be found. The very reverse of that happy idea is the hell of the ignorant mind. Nor is this barbarism confined alone to those ignorant tribes, whom we call savages. The vulgar of every country possess it in certain degrees, proportionated to their opportunities of conversation with the more enlightened. Selfishness, cruel and often cowardly ferocity, together with the most unhappy superstition, are every where the proportionate attendants of ignorance and severe want. And ignorance and want are only removed by intercourse and the offices of society. So self-evident are these positions, that it requires an apology for insisting upon them; but the apology is at hand. He who has read knows how many eminent writers  2 , and he who has conversed knows how many respectable names, connect the idea of innocence and happiness with the life of the savage and the unimproved rustic. To fix the character of the savage was therefore necessary, ere we examine the assertion, that it had been happy for both the old and the new worlds if the East and West Indies had never been discovered. The bloodshed and the attendant miseries which the unparrallelled rapine and cruelties of the Spaniards spread over the new world, indeed disgrace human nature. The great and flourishing empires of Mexico and Peru, steeped in the blood of forty millions of their sons, present a melancholy prospect, which must excite the indignation of every good heart. Yet such desolation is not the certain consequence of discovery. And even should we allow that the depravity of human nature is so great, that the avarice of the merchant and rapacity of the soldier will overwhelm with misery every new discovered country, still are there other, more comprehensive views, to be taken, ere we decide against the intercourse introduced by navigation. When we weigh the happiness of Europe in the scale of political philosophy, we are not to confine our eye to the dreadful ravages of Attila the Hun, or of Alaric the Goth. If the waters of a stagnated lake are disturbed by the spade when led into new channels, we ought not to inveigh against the alteration because the waters are fouled at the first; we are to wait to see the streamlets refine and spread beauty and utility through a thousand vales which they never visited before. Such were the conquests of Alexander, temporary evils, but civilization and happiness followed in the bloody tract. And though disgraced with every barbarity, happiness has also followed the conquests of the Spaniards in the other hemisphere. Though the villainy of the Jesuits defeated their schemes of civilization in many countries, the labours of that society have been crowned with a success in Paraguay and in Canada, which does them the greatest honour. The customs and cruelties of many American tribes still disgrace human nature, but in Paraguay and Canada the natives have been brought to relish the blessings of society and the arts of virtuous and civil life. If Mexico is not so populous as it once was, neither is it so barbarous 3 ; the shrieks of the human victim do not now resound from temple to temple, nor does the human heart, held up reeking to the Sun, imprecate the vengeance of heaven on the guilty empire. And however impolitically despotic the Spanish governments may be, still do these colonies enjoy the opportunities of improvement, which in every age arise from the knowledge of commerce and of letters, opportunities which were never enjoyed in South America under the reigns of Montezuma and Atabalipa. But if from Spanish we turn our eyes to British America, what a glorious prospect! Here once on the wild lawn, perhaps twice in the year, a few savage hunters kindled their evening fire, kindled it more to protect them from evil spirits and beasts of prey, than from the cold, and with their feet pointed to it, slept on the ground. Here now population spreads her thousands, and society appears in all its blessings of mutual help, and the mutual lights of intellectual improvement. "What work of art, or power, or public utility, has ever equalled the glory of having peopled a continent, without guilt or bloodshed, with a multitude of free and happy common-wealths, to have given them the best arts of life and government!" This, indeed, is the greatest glory of the British crown, "a greater than any other nation ever acquired;" and from the consequences of the genius of Henry, Duke of Viseo, did the British American empire arise, an empire which most probably will one day be the glory of the world. Stubborn indeed must be the Theorist, who will deny the improvement, virtue and happiness, which in the result, the voyage of Columbus has spread over the Western World. The happiness which Europe and Asia have received from the intercourse with each other, cannot hitherto, it must be owned, be compared either with the possession of it, or the source of its increase established in America. Yet let the man of the most melancholy views estimate all the wars and depredations which are charged upon the Portuguese and other European nations, still will the Eastern World appear considerably advantaged by the voyage of Gama. If seas of blood have been shed by the Portuguese, nothing new was introduced into India. War and depredation were no unheard of strangers on the banks of the Ganges, nor could the nature of the civil establishments of the eastern nations secure a lasting peace. The ambition of their native princes was only diverted into new channels, into channels, which in the natural course of human affairs, will certainly lead to permanent governments, established on improved laws and just dominion. Yet even ere such governments are formed, is Asia no loser by the arrival of Europeans. The horrid massacres and unbounded rapine which, according to their own annals, followed the victories of their Asian conquerors, were never equalled by the worst of their European vanquishers. Nor is the establishment of improved governments in the East the dream of theory. The superiority of the civil and military arts of the British, notwithstanding the hateful character of some individuals, is at this day beheld in India with all the astonishment of admiration, and all the desire of imitation. This, however retarded by various causes, must in time have a most important effect, must fulfil the prophecy of Camoens, and transfer to the British the high compliment he pays to his countrymen; Beneath their sway majestic, wise and mild, Proud of her victor's laws thrice happier India smiled. In former ages, and within these few years, the fertile empire of India has exhibited every scene of human misery, under the undistinguishing ravages of their Mohammedan and native princes; ravages only equalled in European history by those committed under Attila, surnamed the scourge of God, and the destroyer of nations. The ideas of patriotism and of honour were seldom known in the cabinets of the eastern princes till the arrival of the Europeans. Every species of assassination was the policy of their courts, and every act of unrestrained rapine and massacre followed the path of victory. But some of the Portuguese governors, and many of the English officers, have taught them, that humanity to the conquered is the best, the truest policy. The brutal ferocity of their own conquerors is now the object of their greatest dread; and the superiority of the British in war has convinced their  4 princes, that an alliance with the British is the surest guarantee of their national peace and prosperity. While the English East India Company are possessed of their present greatness, it is in their power to diffuse over the East every blessing which flows from the wisest and most humane policy, a policy till of late unknown, even in idea, in Asia. Long ere the Europeans arrived, a failure of the crop of rice, the principal food of India, has spread the devastations of famine over the populous plains of Bengal. And never, from the seven years famine of ancient Egypt to the present day, was there a natural scarcity in any country which did not enrich the proprietors of the granaries. The Mohammedan princes and Moorish traders have often added all the horrors of an artificial to a natural famine. But however some Portuguese or other governors may stand accused, much was left for the humanity of the more exalted policy of an Albuquerque or a Castro. And under such European governors as these, the distresses of the East have often been alleviated by a generosity of conduct, and a train of resources formerly unknown in Asia. The introduction of the British laws into India, of laws already admired as the dictates of heaven, must, in the course of ages, have a wide and stupendous effect. The abject spirit of Asian submission, will be taught to see, and to claim those rights of nature, of which the dispirited and passive  5 Gentoos could, till lately, hardly form an idea. From this, as naturally as the noon succeeds the dawn, must the other blessings of civilization arise. And though the four great tribes of India are almost inaccessible to the introduction of other manners and of other literature than their own, happily there is one despised tribe, who are not bound by their superstition to reject the advantages which flow from an inter-community with civilized strangers. Nor may the political philosopher be deemed an enthusiast, who would boldly prophesy, that unless the British are driven from India, that tribe, the despised Hallachores, into which the refuse of the rest are now excommunicated, will in the course of a few centuries, from the advantages received from intercommunity, bear such a superiority over the others, that the others will be induced to break the shackles of their absurd superstitions, (which almost in every instance  6 are contrary to the feelings and wishes of nature) and will be led to partake of those advantages which arise from the free scope and due cultivation of the rational powers. Nor can the obstinacy even of the conceited Chinese always resist the desire of imitating the Europeans, a people who in arts and in arms are so greatly superior to themselves. The use of the twenty-four letters, by which we can express every language, appeared at first as miraculous to the Chinese. Prejudice cannot always deprive that people, who are not deficient in selfish cunning, of the ease and expedition of an alphabet; and it is easy to foresee, that, in the course of a few centuries, some alphabet will certainly take place of the 60,000 arbitrary marks, which now render the cultivation of the Chinese literature not only a labour of the utmost difficulty, but even impossible to attain, beyond a very limited degree. And from the introduction of an alphabet, what improvements may not be expected from the laborious industry of the Chinese! Though most obstinately attached to their old customs, yet there is a tide in the manners of nations which is sudden and rapid, and which acts with a kind of instinctive fury against ancient prejudice and absurdity. It was that nation of merchants, the Phoenicians, which diffused the use of letters through the ancient, and Commerce will undoubtedly diffuse the same blessings through the modern world. To this view of the political happiness, which is sure to be introduced in proportion to civilization, let the Divine add what may be reasonably expected from such opportunity of the increase of Religion. A factory of merchants, indeed, has seldom been found to be the school of piety; yet, when the general manners of a people become assimilated to those of a more rational worship, something more than ever was produced by an infant mission, or the neighbourhood of an infant colony, may then be reasonably expected, and even foretold. In estimating the political happiness of a people, nothing is of greater importance than their capacity of, and tendency to, improvement. As a dead lake will continue in the same state for ages and ages, so would the bigotry and superstitions of the East continue the same. But if the lake is begun to be opened into a thousand rivulets, who knows over what unnumbered fields, barren before, they may diffuse the blessings of fertility, and turn a dreary wilderness into a land of society and joy. In contrast to this, let the Golden Coast and other immense regions of Africa be contemplated: Afric behold; alas, what altered view! Her lands uncultured, and her sons untrue; Ungraced with all that sweetens human life, Savage and fierce they roam in brutal strife; Eager they grasp the gifts which culture yields, Yet naked roam their own neglected fields ... Unnumber'd tribes as bestial grazers stray, By laws unform'd, unform'd by Reason's sway. Far inward stretch the mournful steril dales, Where on the parch'd hill-side pale famine wails. Let us view what millions of these unhappy savages are dragged from their native fields, and cut off for ever from all the hopes and all the rights to which human birth entitled them. And who would hesitate to pronounce that Negro the greatest of patriots, who, by teaching his countrymen the arts of society, should teach them to defend themselves in the possession of their fields, their families, and their own personal liberties? Evident however at it is, that the voyages of Gama and Columbus have already carried a superior degree of happiness, and the promise of infinitely more, to the Eastern and Western worlds; yet the advantages derived from the discovery of these regions to Europe may perhaps be denied. But let us view what Europe was, ere the genius of Don Henry gave birth to the spirit of modern discovery. Several ages before this period the feudal system had degenerated into the most absolute tyranny. The barons exercised the most despotic authority over their vassals, and every scheme of public utility was rendered impracticable by their continual petty wars with each other; and to which they led their dependends as dogs to the chace. Unable to read, or to write his own name, the Chieftain was entirely possessed by the most romantic opinion of military glory, and the song of his domestic minstrel constituted his highest idea of fame. The Classics slept on the shelves of the monastries, their dark, but happy asylum, while the life of the monks resembled that of the fattened beeves which loaded their tables. Real abilities were indeed possessed by a Duns Scotus and a few others; but these were lost in the most trifling subtleties of a sophistry, which they dignified with the name of casuistical Divinity. Whether Adam and Eve were created with navels, and how many thousand angels might at the same instant dance upon the point of the finest needle without one jostling another, were two of the several topics of like importance which excited the acumen and engaged the controversies of the Learned. While every branch of philosophical, of rational investigation, was thus unpursued and unknown, Commerce, incompatible in itself with the feodal system, was equally neglected and unimproved. Where the mind is enlarged and enlightened by Learning, plans of Commerce will rise into action, and which, in return, will, from every part of the earth, bring new acquirements to philosophy and science. The birth of Learning and Commerce may be different, but their growth is mutual and dependent upon each other. They not only assist each other, but the same enlargement of mind which is necessary for perfection in the one, is also necessary for perfection in the other; and the same causes impede, and are alike destructive of both. The Intercourse of mankind is the parent of both. According to the confinement or extent of Intercourse, barbarity or civilization proportionably prevail. In the dark Monkish ages, the Intercourse of the learned was as much impeded and confined as that of the merchant. A few unwieldy vessels coasted the shores of Europe, and mendicant friars and ignorant pilgrims carried a miserable account of what was passing in the world from monastery to monastery. What Doctor had last disputed on the peripatetic philosophy at some university, and what new heresy had last appeared, comprised the whole of their literary intelligence; and which was delivered with little accuracy, and received with as little attention. While this thick cloud of mental darkness overspread the western world, was Don Henry prince of Portugal born, born to set mankind free from the feodal system, and to give to the whole world every advantage, every light that may possibly be diffused by the Intercourse of unlimited commerce: \---For then from ancient gloom emerg'd The rising world of Trade: the Genius, then, Of Navigation, that in hopeless sloth Had slumber'd on the vast Atlantic deep For idle ages, starting heard at last The Lusitanian Prince, who, heaven-inspir'd, To love of useful glory rous'd mankind, And in unbounded Commerce mixt the world. In contrast to the melancholy view of human nature, sunk in barbarism and benighted with ignorance, let the present state of Europe be impartially estimated. Yet though the great increase of opulence and learning cannot be denied, there are some who assert, that virtue and happiness have as greatly declined. And the immense overflow of riches, from the East in particular, has been pronounced big with destruction to the British empire. Every thing human, it is true, has its dark as well as its bright side; but let these popular complaints be examined, and it will be found, that modern Europe, and the British empire in a very particular manner, have received the greatest and most solid advantages from the modern enlarged system of Commerce. The magic of the old romances, which could make the most withered, deformed hag, appear as the most beautiful virgin, is every day verified in popular declamation. Ancient days are there painted in the most amiable simplicity, and the modern in the most odious colours. Yet what man of fortune in England lives in that stupendous gross luxury, which every day was exhibited in the Gothic castles of the old Chieftains! Four or five hundred knights and squires in the domestic retinue of a warlike earl was not uncommon, nor was the pomp of embroidery inferior to the profuse waste of their tables; in both instances unequalled by all the mad excesses of the present age. While the Baron thus lived in all the wild glare of Gothic luxury, agriculture was almost totally neglected, and his meaner vassals fared harder, infinitely less comfortably, than the meanest industrious labourers of England do now. Where the lands are uncultivated, the peasants, ill-cloathed, ill-lodged, and poorly fed, pass their miserable days in sloth and filth, totally ignorant of every advantage, of every comfort which nature lays at their feet. He who passes from the trading towns and cultured fields of England, to those remote villages of Scotland or Ireland, which claim this description, is astonished at the comparative wretchedness of their destitute inhabitants; but few consider, that these villages only exhibit a view of what Europe was, ere the spirit of Commerce diffused the blessings which naturally flow from her improvements. In the Hebrides the failure of a harvest almost depopulates an island. Having little or no traffic to purchase grain, numbers of the young and hale betake themselves to the continent in quest of employment and food, leaving a few, less adventurous, behind, to beget a new race, the heirs of the same fortune. Yet, from the same cause, from the want of traffic, the kingdom of England has often felt more dreadful effects than these. Even in the days when her Henries and Edwards plumed themselves with the trophies of France, how often has Famine spread all her horrors over city and village? Our modern histories neglect this characteristical feature of ancient days; but the rude chronicles of these ages inform us, that three or four times, in almost every reign of continuance, was England thus visited. The failure of the crop was then severely felt, and two bad harvests together were almost insupportable. But Commerce has now opened another scene, has armed Government with the happiest power that can be exerted by the rulers of a nation; the power to prevent every extremity  7 which may possibly arise from bad harvests; extremities, which, in former ages, were esteemed more dreadful visitations of the wrath of heaven, than the pestilence itself. Yet modern London is not so certainly defended against the latter, its antient visitor in almost every reign, than the Commonwealth by the means of Commerce, under a just and humane government, is secured against the ravages of the former. If, from these great outlines of the happiness enjoyed by a commercial over an uncommercial nation, we turn our eyes to the manners, the advantages will be found no less in favour of the civilized. Whoever is inclined to declaim on the vices of the present age, let him read, and be convinced, that the Gothic ones were less virtuous. If the spirit of chivalry prevented effeminacy, it was the foster-father of a ferocity of manners, now happily unknown. Rapacity, avarice, and effeminacy are the vices ascribed to the increase of Commerce; and in some degree, it must be confessed, they follow her steps. Yet infinitely more dreadful, as every palatinate in Europe often felt, were the effects of the two first under the feodal Lords, than possibly can be experienced under any system of trade. The virtues and vices of human nature are the same in every age: they only receive different modifications, and are dormant or awaked into action under different circumstances. The feodal Lord had it infinitely more in his power to be rapacious than the merchant. And whatever avarice may attend the trader, his intercourse with the rest of mankind lifts him greatly above that brutish ferocity which actuates the savage, often the rustic, and in general characterises the ignorant part of mankind. The abolition of the feodal system, a system of absolute slavery, and that equality of mankind, which affords the protection of property, and every other incitement to industry, are the glorious gifts which the spirit of Commerce, awaked by prince Henry of Portugal, has bestowed upon Europe in general; and, as if directed by the manes of his mother, a daughter of England, upon the British empire in particular. In the vice of effeminacy alone, perhaps, do we exceed our ancestors; yet even here we have infinitely the advantage over them. The brutal ferocity of former ages is now lost, and the general mind is humanised. The savage breast is the native soil of revenge; a vice, of all others, ingratitude excepted, peculiarly stampt with the character of hell. But the mention of this was reserved for the character of the savages of Europe. The savage of every country is implacable when injured, but among some, revenge has its measure. The wilds of America hear the hostile parties join in their mutual lamentations over the murdered, and whom, as an oblivion of malice, they bury together. But the measure of revenge, never to be full, was left for the demisavages of Europe. The vassals of the feudal Lord entered into his quarrels with the most inexorable rage. Just or unjust was no consideration of theirs. It was family feud; no farther enquiry was made; and from age to age, the parties, who never injured each other, breathed nothing but mutual rancour and revenge. And actions, suitable to this horrid spirit, every where confessed its violent influence. Such where the late days of Europe, admired by the ignorant for the innocence of manners. Resentment of injury indeed is natural; and there is a degree which is honest, and though warm, far from inhuman. But if it is the hard task of humanised virtue to preserve the feeling of an injury unmixt with the slightest criminal wish of revenge, how impossible is it for the savage, to attain the dignity of forgiveness, the greatest ornament of human nature. As in individual, a virtue will rise into a vice, generosity into blind profusion, and even mercy into criminal lenity, so civilised manners will lead the opulent in to effeminacy. But let in be considered, this consequence is by no means the certain result of civilization. Civilization, on the contrary, provides the certain preventive of this evil. When refinement degenerates into whatever enervates the mind, whenever frivolousness predominates, literary ignorance is sure to complete the effeminate character. A mediocrity of virtues and of talents is the lot of the great majority of mankind; and even this mediocrity, if cultivated by a liberal education, will infallibly secure its possessor against those excesses of effeminacy which are really culpable. To be of plain manners it is not necessary to be a clown, or to wear coarse cloaths; nor is it necessary to lie on the ground and feed like the savage, to be truly manly. The beggar who, behind the hedge, divides his offals with his dog, has often more of the real sensualist than he who dines at an elegant table. Nor need we hesitate to assert, that he who, unable to preserve a manly elegance of manners, degenerates into the petit maitre , would have been, in any age or condition, equally insignificant and worthless. Some, when they talk of the debauchery of the present age, seem to think that the former were all innocence. But this is ignorance of human nature. The debauchery of a barbarous age is gross and brutal; that of a gloomy superstitious one, secret, excessive, and murderous: that of a more polished one, not to make an apology, much happier for the fair sex  8 , and certainly not so bad. If one disease has been imported from Spanish America, the most valuable medicines have likewise been brought from these regions; and distempers, which were thought invincible by our forefathers, are now cured. If the luxuries of the Indies usher disease to our tables, the consequence is not unknown; the wise and the temperate receive no injury, and intemperance has been the destroyer of mankind in every age. The opulence of ancient Rome produced a luxury of manners which proved fatal to that mighty empire. But the effeminate sensualists of these ages were not men of intellectual cultivation. The enlarged ideas, the generous and manly feelings, inspired by a liberal education, were utterly unknown to them. Unformed by that wisdom which arises from science, they were gross barbarians, dressed in the mere outward tinsel of civilization  9 . Where the enthusiasm of military honour characterises the rank of gentlemen, that nation will rise into empire. But no sooner does conquest give a continued security, than the mere soldier degenerates; and the old veterans are soon succeeded by a new generation, illiterate as their fathers, but destitute of their virtues and experience. Luxury prevails; titles and family are the only merit, and the whole body of the nobility are utterly ignorant of the principles of commerce and true policy. A stately grandeur is preserved, but it is only outward, all is decayed within, and on the first storm the weak fabrick falls to the dust. Thus rose and thus fell the empire of Rome, and the much wider one of Portugal. But most essentially different from this is the present character of the British nation: Science and every branch of liberal study have here taken deep root, and spread their fruitful boughs wide over the unrivalled empire. Our politicians of the day may declaim as ignorant passion leads them, but the true character of the present age, compared with that of the last and the preceding centuries, does honour to human nature. Neither do the slavish principles of the Royalists of the last century, nor the unconstitutional fury of the Republicans, constitute the present general character. A spirit more manly than that of the former, more rational, more liberal than that of both, predominates in every branch of the people. The weakness of effeminacy has neither appeared in the Camp nor in the Senate. The advantages of cultivated talents, on the contrary, never shone forth with greater lustre, than the present age has beheld them displayed, in the disputes of the Senate and in the arts of war. And if thus we are defended against the evils of effeminacy, we may also presume, that the same liberal cultivation of the minds of the Great will preserve us from those evils which other nations have suffered from the sudden influx of enormous wealth. The wisdom of legislature might certainly have prevented every evil which Spain and Portugal have experienced from their acquisitions in the two Indies  10 . But what other than the total eclipse of their glory could be expected from a nobility, rude and unlettered as those of Portugal are described by the author of the Lusiad, a court and nobility, who sealed the truth of all his complaints against them, by suffering that great man, the light of their age, to die in an alms-house! What but the fall of their state could be expected from barbarians like these! Nor can the annals of mankind produce one instance of the fall of empire, where the character of the grandees was other than that ascribed to his countrymen by Camoens. No lesson can be of greater national importance than the history of the rise and the fall of a commercial empire. The view of what advantages were acquired, and of what might have been still added; the means by which such empire might have been continued, and the errors by which it was lost, are as particularly conspicuous in the naval and commercial history of Portugal, as if Providence had intended to give a lasting example to mankind; a chart, where the course of the safe voyage is pointed out, and where the shelves and rocks, and the seasons of tempest are discovered, and foretold. The history of Portugal, as a naval and commercial power, begins with the designs of Prince Henry. But as the enterprizes of this great man, and the completion of his designs are intimately connected with the state of Portugal, a short view of the progress of the power, and of the character of that kingdom, will be necessary to elucidate the history of the revival of commerce, and the subject of the Lusiad. During the centuries, when the effeminated Roman provinces of Europe were desolated by the irruptions of northern or Scythian barbarians, the Saracens, originally a wandering banditti of Asiatic Scythia, spread the same horrors of brutal conquest over the finest countries of the eastern world. The northern conquerors of the finer provinces of Europe embraced the Christian religion as professed by the monks, and, contented with the luxuries of their new settlements, their military spirit soon declined. Their ancient brothers, the Saracens, on the other hand, having embraced the religion of Mohammed, their rage of war received every addition which may possibly be inspired by religious enthusiasm. Not only the spoils of the vanquished, but their beloved Paradise itself was to be obtained by their sabres, by extending the faith of their prophet by force of arms and usurpation of dominion. Strengthened and inspired by a commission which they esteemed divine, the rapidity of their conquests far exceeded those of the Goths and Vandals. A great majority of the inhabitants of every country they subdued embraced their religion, imbibed their principles, united in their views, and the professors Mohammedism became the most formidable combination that ever was leagued together against the rest of mankind. Morocco and the adjacent countries, at this time amazingly populous, had now received the doctrines of the Koran, and incorporated with the Saracens. And the Turkish arms spread slaughter and desolation from the south of Spain to Italy and the islands of the Mediterranean. All the rapine and carnage committed by the Gothic conquerors were now amply returned on their less war-like posterity. In Spain, and the province now called Portugal, the Mohammedans erected powerful kingdoms, and their lust of conquest threatened destruction to every Christian power. But a romantic military spirit revived in Europe, under the auspices of Charlemagne. The Mohammedans, during the reign of this sovereign, made a most formidable irruption into Europe, and France in particular felt the weight of their fury; when that political monarch, by inventing new military honours, drew the adventurous youth of every Christian power to his standards, and in fact, a circumstance, however neglected by historians, gave birth to the Crusades, the beginning of which, in propriety, ought to be dated from his reign. Few indeed are the historians of this period, but enough remain to prove that though the writers of the old romance seized upon it, though they gave full room to the wildest flights of imagination, and added the inexhaustible machinery of magic to the adventures of their heroes, yet the origin of their fictions was founded on historical facts  11 . Yet, however this period may thus resemble the fabulous ages of Greece, certain it is, that an Orlando, a Rinaldo, a Rugero, and other celebrated names in romance, acquired great honour in the wars which were waged against the Saracens, the invaders of Europe. In these romantic wars, by which the power of the Mohammedans was checked, several centuries elapsed, when Alonzo, king of Castile, apprehensive that the whole force of the Mohammedans of Spain and Morocco was ready to fall upon him, prudently imitated the conduct of Charlemagne. He availed himself of the spirit of chivalry, and demanded leave of Philip I. of France, and of other princes, that volunteers from their dominions might be allowed to distinguish themselves under his banners against the infidels. His desire was no sooner known, than a brave romantic army thronged to his standards, and Alonzo was victorious. Honours and endowments were liberally distributed among the champions, and to one of the bravest of them, to Henry  12 , a younger son of the duke of Burgundy, he gave his daughter Teresa in marriage, with the sovereignty of the countries south of Galicia in dowry, commissioning him to extend his dominions by the expulsion of the Moors. Henry, who reigned by the title of Count, improved every advantage which offered. The two rich provinces of Entro Minho e Douro , and Fra los Montes , yielded to his arms; great part of Beira also was subdued, and the Moorish king of Lamego became his tributary. Many thousands of Christians, who had lived in miserable subjection to the Moors, or in desolate independency in the mountains, took shelter under the generous protection of Count Henry. Great numbers also of the Moors changed their religion, and chose rather to continue in the land where they were born, under a mild government, than be exposed to the severities and injustice of their native governors. And thus, on one of the most  13 beautiful and fertile spots of the world, and in the finest climate, in consequence of a Crusade  14 against the Mohammedans, was established the sovereignty of Portugal, a sovereignty which in time spread its influence over the world, and gave a new face to the manners of nations. Count Henry, after a successful reign, was succeeded by his infant son Don Alonzo-Henry, who having surmounted several dangers which threatened his youth  15 , became the founder of the Portuguese monarchy. In 1139 the Moors of Spain and Barbary united their forces to recover the dominions from which they had been driven by the Christians. According to the lowest accounts of the Portuguese writers, the army of the Moors amounted to near 400,000; nor is this number incredible, when we consider what armies they at other times brought to the field, and that at this time they came to take possession of the lands they expected to conquer. Don Alonzo, however, with a very small army, gave them battle on the plains of Ourique, and after a struggle of six hours, obtained a most glorious and compleat  16 victory, and which was crowned with an event of the utmost importance. On the field of battle Don Alonzo was proclaimed King of Portugal by his victorious soldiers, and he in return conferred the rank of nobility on the whole army. But the constitution of the monarchy was not settled, nor was Alonzo invested with the Regalia till six years after this memorable victory. The government the Portuguese had experienced under the Spaniards and Moors, and the advantages which they saw were derived from their own valour, had taught them a love of liberty, which was not to be complimented away in the joy of victory, or by the shouts of tumult. Alonzo himself understood their spirit too well to make the least attempt to erect himself a despotic Monarch, nor did he discover the least inclination to destroy that bold consciousness of freedom which had enabled his army to conquer and elect him their Sovereign. After six years spent in farther victories, in extending and securing his dominions, he called an assembly of the prelates, nobility and commons, to meet at Lamego. When the assembly opened, Alonzo appeared seated on the throne, but without any other mark of regal dignity. And ere he was crowned, the constitution of the state was settled, and eighteen statutes were solemnly confirmed by oath  17 as the charter of king and people; statutes diametrically opposite to the jure divino and arbitrary power of kings, to the principles which inculcate and demand the unlimited passive obedience of the subject. Conscious of what they owed to their own valour, the founders of the Portuguese monarchy transmitted to their heirs those generous principles of liberty which compleat and adorn the martial character. The ardour of the volunteer, an ardour unknown to the slave and the mercenary, added to the most romantic ideas of military glory, characterised the Portuguese under the reigns of their first monarchs. In almost continual wars with the Moors, this spirit, on which the existence of their kingdom depended, rose higher and higher; and the desire to extirpate Mohammedism, the principle which animated the wish of victory in every battle, seemed to take deeper root in every age. Such were the manners, and such the principles of the people who were governed by the successors of Alonzo the First, a succession of great men, who proved themselves worthy to reign over so military and enterprising a nation. By a continued train of victories Portugal increased considerably in strength, and the Portuguese had the honour to drive the Moors from Europe. The invasions of these people were now requited by successful expeditions into Africa. And such was the manly spirit of these ages, that the statutes of Lamego received additional articles in favour of liberty, a convincing proof that the general heroism of a people depends upon the principles of freedom. Alonzo IV.  18 though not an amiable character, was perhaps the greatest warrior, politician, and monarch of his age. After a reign of military splendor he left his throne to his son Pedro, who from his inflexible justice was surnamed the Just, or, the Lover of Justice. The ideas of equity and literature were now diffused by this great  19 prince, who was himself a polite scholar, and most accomplished gentleman. And Portugal began to perceive the advantages of cultivated talents, and to feel its superiority over the barbarous politics of the ignorant Moors. The great Pedro, however, was succeeded by a weak prince, and the heroic spirit of the Portuguese seemed to exist no more under his son Fernando, surnamed the Careless. But the general character of the people was too deeply impressed to be obliterated by one inglorious reign, and under John I.  20 all the virtues of the Portuguese shone forth with redoubled lustre. Happy for Portugal his father bestowed a most excellent education upon this prince, which added to, and improving his great natural talents, rendered him one of the greatest of monarchs. Conscious of the superiority which his own liberal education gave him, he was assiduous to bestow the same advantages upon his children, and he himself often became their preceptor in the branches of science and useful knowledge. Fortunate in all his affairs, he was most of all fortunate in his family. He had many sons, and he lived to see them men, men of parts and of action, whose only emulation was to shew affection to his person, and to support his administration by their great abilities. There is something exceeding pleasing in reading the history of a family which shews human nature in its most exalted virtues and most amiable colours; and the tribute of veneration is spontaneously paid to the father who distinguishes the different talents of his children, and places them in the proper lines of action. All the sons of John excelled in military exercises, and in the literature of their age; Don Edward and Don  21 Pedro were particularly educated for the cabinet, and the mathematical genius of Don Henry, one of his youngest sons, received every encouragement which a king and a father could give, to ripen it into perfection and public utility. History was well known to Prince Henry, and his turn of mind peculiarly enabled him to make political observations upon it. The wealth and power of ancient Tyre and Carthage shewed him what a maritime nation might hope; and the flourishing colonies of the Greeks were the frequent topic of his conversation. Where the Grecian commerce, confined as it was, extended its influence, the deserts became cultivated fields, cities rose, and men were drawn from the woods and caverns to unite in society. The Romans, on the other hand, when they destroyed Carthage, buried in her ruins, the fountain of civilization, of improvement and opulence. They extinguished the spirit of commerce; the agriculture of the conquered nations, Britannia 22 alone, perhaps, excepted, was totally neglected. And thus, while the luxury of Rome consumed the wealth of her provinces, her uncommercial policy dried up the sources of its continuance. The egregious errors of the Romans, who perceived not the true use of their distant conquests, and the inexhaustible fountains of opulence which Phoenicia had established in her colonies, instructed Prince Henry what gifts to bestow upon his country, and in the result upon the whole world. Nor were the inestimable advantages of commerce the sole motives of Henry. All the ardour that the love of his country could awake, conspired to stimulate the natural turn of his genius for the improvement of navigation. As the kingdom of Portugal had been wrested from the Moors and established by conquest, so its existence still subsisted on the superiority of the force of arms; and ere the birth of Henry, the superiority of the Portuguese navies had been of the utmost consequence to the protection of the state. Whatever therefore might curb or ruin the power of the Moors, was of the last importance to the existence of Portugal. Such were the views and the circumstances which united to inspire the designs of Henry, all which were powerfully enforced and invigorated by the religion of that prince. The desire to extirpate Mohammedism was patriotism in Portugal. It was the principle which gave birth to, and supported their monarchy. Their kings avowed it, and Prince Henry, the piety of whose heart cannot be questioned, always professed, that to propagate the gospel and extirpate Mohammedism, was the great purpose of his designs and enterprizes. And however both the one and the other, in the event, were  23 neglected, certain it is, that the same principles inspired, and were  24 always professed by king Emmanuel, under whom the Eastern World was discovered by Gama. The Crusades, to rescue the Holy Land from the infidels, which, however unregarded by historians, had already been of the greatest political service to Spain, and Portugal,  25 began now to have some effect upon the commerce of Europe. The Hans Towns had received charters of liberty, and had united together for the protection of their trade against the numerous pyrates of the Baltic. A people of Italy, known by the name of the Lombards, had opened a lucrative traffic with the ports of Egypt, from whence they imported into Europe the riches of India; and Bruges in Flanders, the mart between them and the Hans Towns was, in consequence, surrounded with the best agriculture of these ages  26 . A certain proof of the dependance of agriculture upon the extent of commerce. Yet though these gleams of light, as morning stars, began to appear, it was not the gross multitude, it was only the eye of a Henry which could perceive what they prognosticated, and it was only a genius like his which could prevent them from again setting in the depths of night. The Hans Towns were liable to be buried in the victories of a Tyrant, and the trade with Egypt was exceedingly insecure and precarious. Europe was still enveloped in the dark mists of ignorance, and though the mariner's compass was invented before the birth of Henry, it was improved to no naval advantage. Traffic still crept, in an infant state, along the coasts, nor were the construction of ships adapted for other voyages. One successful Tyrant might have overwhelmed the system and extinguished the spirit of commerce, for it stood on a much narrower and much feebler basis, than in the days of Phoenician and Grecian colonization. Yet these mighty fabricks, many centuries before, had been swallowed up in the desolations of unpolitical conquest. A broader and more permanent foundation of commerce than the world had yet seen, an universal basis, was yet wanting to bless mankind, and Henry Duke of Viseo was born to give it. On purpose to promote his designs, Prince Henry was by his father stationed the Commander in chief of the Portuguese forces in Africa. He had already, in 1412, three years before the reduction of Ceuta  27 , sent a ship to make discoveries on the Barbary coast. Cape Nam  28 , as its name intimates, was then the Ne plus ultra of European navigation; the ship sent by Henry however passed it sixty leagues, and reached Cape Bojador. Encouraged by this beginning, the Prince while he was in Africa acquired whatever information the most intelligent of the Moors of Fez and Morocco could give. About a league and one half from the Cape of St. Vincent, in the kingdom of Algarve, Don Henry had observed a small but commodious situation for a sea-port town. On this spot, supposed the Promontorium Sacrum of the Romans, he built his town of Sagrez, by much the best planned and fortified of any in Portugal. Here, where the view of the ocean, says Faria, inspired his hopes and endeavours, he erected his arsenals, and built and harboured his ships. And here, leaving the temporary bustle and cares of the state to his father and brothers, he retired like a philosopher from the world, on purpose to render his studies of the utmost importance to its happiness. Having received all the light which could be discovered in Africa, he continued unwearied in his mathematical and geographical studies; the art of ship-building received amazing improvement under his direction, and the truth of his ideas of the structure of the terraqueous globe are now confirmed. He it was who first suggested the use of the compass, and of longitude and latitude in navigation, and how these might be ascertained by astronomical observations, suggestions and discoveries which would have held no second place among the conjectures of a Bacon, or the improvements of a Newton. Naval adventurers were now invited from all parts to the town of Sagrez, and in 1418 Juan Gonsalez Zarco and Tristran Vaz set sail on an expedition of discovery, the circumstances of which give us a striking picture of the state of navigation, ere it was new modelled by the genius of Henry. Cape Bojador, so named from its extent  29 , runs about forty leagues to the westward, and for about six leagues off land there is a most violent current, which dashing upon the shelves, makes a tempestuous sea. This was deemed impassible, for it was not considered, that by standing out to the ocean the current might be avoided. To pass this formidable cape was the commission of Zarco and Vaz, who were also ordered to proceed as far as they could to discover the African coast, which, according to the information given to Henry by the Moors and Arabs, extended at least to the equinoctial line. Zarco and Vaz, however, lost their course in a storm, and were driven to a little island, which, in the joy of their deliverance, they named Puerto Santo, or the Holy Haven. Nor was Prince Henry, on their return, less joyful of their discovery, than they had been of their escape: A striking proof of the miserable state of navigation; for this island is only the voyage of a few days, in favourable weather, from the promontary of Sagrez. The Discoverers of Puerto Santo, accompanied by Bartholomew Perestrello, were with three ships sent out on farther trial. Perestrello, having sowed some seeds and left some cattle on Holy Haven, returned to Portugal  30 . But Zarco and Vaz directing their course southward, in 1419, perceived something like a cloud on the water, and sailing toward it, discovered an island covered with wood, which from thence they named Madeira. And this rich and beautiful island, which soon yielded a considerable revenue, was the first reward of the enterprizes of Prince Henry. If the Duke of Viseo's liberal ideas of establishing colonies, those sinews of a commercial state, or his views of African and Indian commerce, were too refined to strike the gross multitude; yet other advantages resulting from his designs, one would conclude, were self-evident. Nature calls upon Portugal to be a maritime power, and her naval superiority over the Moors, was, in the time of Henry, the surest defence of her existence as a kingdom. Yet though all his labours tended to establish that naval superiority on the surest basis, though even the religion of the age added its authority to the clearest political principles in favour of Henry; yet were his enterprizes and his expected discoveries derided with all the insolence of ignorance and bitterness of popular clamour. Barren deserts like Lybia, it was said, were all that could be found, and a thousand disadvantages, drawn from these data, were foreseen and foretold. The great mind and better knowledge of Henry, however, were not thus to be shaken. Though twelve years from the discovery of Madeira had elapsed in unsuccessful endeavours to carry his navigation farther, he was now more happy; for one of his captains, named Galianez, in 1434 passed the Cape of Bojador, till then invincible; an action, says Faria, in the common opinion, not inferior to the labours of Hercules. Gilianez, the next year, accompanied by Gonsalez Baldaya, carried his discoveries many leagues farther. Having put two horsemen on shore, to discover the face of the country, the adventurers, after riding several hours, saw nineteen men armed with javelins. The natives fled, and the two horsemen pursued, till one of the Portuguese, being wounded, lost the first blood that was sacrificed to the new system of commerce. A small beginning, a very small streamlet, some perhaps may exclaim, but which soon swelled into oceans, and deluged the eastern and western worlds. Let such philosophers, however, be desired to name the design of public utility, which has been unpolluted by the depravity of the human passions. To suppose that Heaven itself could give an institution which could not be perverted, and to suppose no previous alteration in human nature, is a contradiction in proposition; for as human nature now exists, power cannot be equally possessed by all, and whenever the selfish or vicious passions predominate, that power will certainly be abused. The cruelties therefore of Cortez, and that more horrid barbarian Pizarro  31 , are no more to be charged upon Don Henry and Columbus, than the villainies of the Jesuits and the horrors of the Inquisition are to be ascribed to him, whose precepts are summed up in the great command, To do to your neighbour as you would wish your neighbour to do to you. But if it is still alledged that he who plans a discovery ought to foresee the miseries which the vicious will engraft upon his enterprize, let the objector be told, that the miseries are uncertain, while the advantages are real and sure; and that the true philosopher will not confine his eye to the Spanish campaigns in Mexico and Peru, but will extend his prospect to all the inestimable benefits, all the improvements of laws, opinions, and of manners, which have been introduced by the intercourse of universal commerce. In 1440 Anthony Gonsalez brought some Moors prisoners to Lisbon. These he took two and forty leagues beyond Cape Bojador, and in 1442 he returned with his captives. One Moor escaped, but ten blacks of Guinea and a considerable quantity of gold dust were given in ransom for two others. A rivulet at the place of landing was named by Gonsalez, Rio del Oro, or the River of Gold. And the islands of Adeget, Arguim, and de las Gar ças , were now discovered. The Guinea blacks, the first ever seen in Portugal, and the gold dust, excited other passions beside admiration. A company was formed at Lagos, under the auspices of Prince Henry, to carry on a traffic with the new discovered countries; and as the Portuguese considered themselves in a state of continual hostility with the Moors, about two hundred of these people, inhabitants of the Islands of Nar and Tider, in 1444, were brought prisoners to Portugal. And Gonzalo de Cintra was the next year attacked by the Moors, fourteen leagues beyond Rio del Oro, where with seven of his men he was killed. This hostile proceeding displeased Prince Henry, and in 1446 Anthony Gonsalez and two other captains were sent to enter into a treaty of peace and traffic with the natives of Rio del Oro, and also to attempt their conversion. But these proposals were rejected by the barbarians, one of whom, however, came voluntarily to Portugal, and Juan Fernandez remained with the natives, to observe their manners and the products of the country. In the year following Fernandez was found in good health and brought home to Portugal. The account he gave of the country and people affords a striking instance of the misery of barbarians. The land an open, barren, sandy plain, where the wandering natives were guided in their journeys by the stars and flights of birds; their food milk, lizards, locusts, and such herbs as the soil produced without culture; and their only defence from the scorching heat of the sun some miserable tents which they pitch as occasion requires on the burning sands. In 1447 upwards of thirty ships followed the route of traffic which was now opened; and John de Castilla obtained the infamy to stand the first on the list of those names, whose villanies have disgraced the spirit of commerce, and afforded the loudest complaints against the progress of navigation. Dissatisfied with the value of his cargo, he ungratefully seized twenty of the natives of Gomera, (one of the Canaries) who had assisted him, and with whom he was in friendly alliance, and brought them as slaves to Portugal. But Prince Henry resented this outrage, and having given them some valuable presents of clothes, restored the captives to freedom and their native country. The conversion and reduction of the Canaries was also this year attempted; but Spain having challenged the discovery of these islands, the expedition was discontinued. In the Canary islands was found a feodal custom; the chief man or governor was gratified with the first night of every bride in his district. In 1448 Fernando Alonzo was sent ambassador to the King of Cabo Verde with a treaty of trade and conversion, which was defeated at that time by the treachery of the natives. In 1449 the Azores were discovered by Gonsalo Vello, and the coast sixty leagues beyond Cape Verde was visited by the fleets of Henry. It is also certain that some of his commanders passed the equinoctial line. It was the custom of his sailors to leave his motto Talent de Bien Faire , wherever they came; and in 1525 Loaya, a Spanish captain, found that device carved on the bark of a tree in the isle of St. Matthew, in the second degree of south latitude. Prince Henry had now with the most inflexible perseverance prosecuted his discoveries for upwards of forty years. His father, John I. concurred with him in his views, and gave him every assistance; his brother, King Edward, during his short reign, was the same as his father had been; nor was the eleven years regency of his brother Don Pedro less auspicious to him  32 . But the misunderstanding between Pedro and his nephew Alonzo V. who took upon him the reins of government in his seventeenth year, retarded the designs of Henry, and gave him much unhappiness  33 . At his town of Sagrez, from whence he had not moved for many years, except when called to court on some emergency of state, Don Henry, now in his sixty- seventh year, yielded to the stroke of fate, in the year of our Lord 1463, gratified with the certain prospect, that the route to the eastern world would one day crown the enterprizes to which he had given birth. He had the happiness to see the naval superiority of his country over the Moors established on the most solid basis, its trade greatly upon the increase, and what he esteemed his greatest happiness, for the piety of his heart was sincere, he flattered himself that he had given a mortal wound to Mohammedism, and had opened the door to an universal propagation of christianity and the civilization of mankind. And to him, as to their primary author, are due all the inestimable advantages which ever have flowed, or ever will flow from the discovery of the greatest part of Africa, of the East and West Indies. Every Improvement in the state and manners of these countries, or whatever country may be yet discovered, is strictly due to him; nor is the difference between the present state of Europe and the monkish age in which he was born, less the result of his genius and toils. What is an Alexander crowned with trophies at the head of his army compared with a Henry contemplating the ocean from his window on the rock of Sagrez! The one suggests the idea of the evil d aemon, the other of the Deity. From the year 1448, when Alonzo V. assumed the power of government, till the end of his reign in 1471, little progress was made in maritime affairs, and Cape Catharine was only added to the former discoveries. But under his son John II. the designs of Prince Henry were prosecuted with renewed vigour. In 1481 the Portuguese built a fort on the Golden Coast, and the King of Portugal took the title of Lord of Guinea. Bartholomew Diaz, in 1486, reached the river which he named dell Infante on the eastern side of Africa, but deterred by the storms of that region from proceeding farther, on his return he had the happiness to be the Discoverer of the Promontory, unknown for many ages, which bounds the south of Afric. This, from the storms he there encountered, he named the Cape of Tempests; but John, elated with the promise of India, which this discovery, as he justly deemed, included, gave it the name of the Cape of Good Hope. The arts and valour of the Portuguese had now made a great impression on the minds of the Africans. The King of Congo, a dominion of great extent, sent the sons of some of his principal officers to Lisbon to be instructed in arts and religion; and ambassadors from the King of Benin requested teachers to be sent to his kingdom. On the return of his subjects, the King and Queen of Congo, with 100,000 of their people, were baptized. An ambassador also arrived from the Christian Emperor of Abyssinia, and Pedro de Covillam and Alonzo de Payva were sent by land to penetrate into the East, that they might acquire whatever intelligence might facilitate the desired navigation to India. Covillam and Payva parted at Toro in Arabia and took different routs. The former having visited Conanor, Calicut, and Goa in India, returned to Grand Cairo, where he heard of the death of his companion. Here also he met the Rabbi Abraham of Beja, who was employed for the same purpose by king John. Covillam sent the Rabbi home with an account of what countries he had seen, and he himself proceeded to Ormuz and Ethiopia, but as Camoens expresses it: \---to his native shore, Enrich'd with knowledge, he return'd no more. Men, whose genius led them to maritime affairs, began now to be possessed by an ardent ambition to distinguish themselves; and the famous Columbus offered his service to King John, and was rejected. Every one knows the discoveries of this great adventurer, but his history is generally misunderstood  34 . It is by some believed, that his ideas of the sphere of the earth gave birth to his opinion, that there must be an immense unknown continent in the west, such as America is now known to be; and that his proposals were to go in search of it  35 . But the simple truth is, Columbus, who, as we have certain evidence, acquired his skill in navigation among the Portuguese, could be no stranger to the design long meditated in that kingdom, of discovering a naval route to India, which, according to ancient geographers and the opinion of that age, was supposed to be the next land to the west of Spain. And that India and the adjacent islands were the regions sought by Columbus, is also certain. John, who esteemed the route to India as almost discovered, and in the power of his own subjects, rejected the proposals of the foreigner. But Columbus met a more favourable reception from Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of Castile. To interfere with the route or discoveries, opened and enjoyed by another power, was at this time esteemed contrary to the laws of nations. Columbus, therefore, though the object was one, proposed, as Magalhaens afterwards did for the same reason, to steer the westward course, and having in 1492 discovered some western islands, in 1493, on his return to Spain, he put into the Tagus with great tokens of the riches of his discovery. Some of the Portuguese courtiers, the same ungenerous minds perhaps who advised the rejection of Columbus because he was a foreigner, proposed the assassination of that great man, thereby to conceal from Spain the advantages of his navigation. But John, though Columbus rather roughly upbraided him, looked upon him now with a generous regret, and dismissed him with honour. The king of Portugal, however, was alarmed, lest the discoveries of Columbus, interfered with those of his crown, and gave orders to equip a war fleet to protect his rights. But matters were adjusted by embassies, and that celebrated treaty by which Spain and Portugal divided the Western and Eastern Worlds between themselves. The eastern half of the world was allotted for the Portuguese, and the western for the Spanish navigation. The line of meridian from the north to the south pole was their boundary, and thus each nation had one hundred and eighty degrees, within which they might establish settlements and extend their discoveries. And a Papal Bull, which, for obvious reasons, prohibited the propagation of the gospel in these bounds by the subjects of any other state, confirmed this amicable and extraordinary treaty. Soon after this, while the thoughts of king John were intent on the discovery of India, his preparations were interrupted by his death. But his earnest desires and great designs were inherited, together with his crown, by his cousin Emmanuel. And in 1497, the year before Columbus made the voyage which discovered the mouth of the river Oronoko, Vasco de Gama sailed from the Tagus on the discovery of India. Of this voyage, the subject of the Lusiad, many particulars are necessarily mentioned in the notes; we shall therefore only allude to these, but be more explicit on the others, which are omitted by Camoens in obedience to the rules of the Epopaea. Notwithstanding the full torrent of popular clamour against the undertaking, Emmanuel was determined to prosecute the views of Prince Henry and John II. Three sloops of war and a store ship manned with only 160 men were fitted out; for hostility, was not the purpose of this humane expedition. Vasco de Gama, a gentleman of good family, who, in a war with the French, had given signal proofs of his naval skill, was commissioned admiral and general, and his brother Paul, for whom he bore the sincerest affection, with his friend Nicholas Coello, were at his request appointed to command under him. It is the greatest honour of kings, to distinguish the characters of their officers, and to employ them accordingly. Emmanuel in many instances was happy in this talent, particularly in the choice of his admiral for the discovery of India. All the enthusiasm of desire to accomplish his end, joined with the greatest heroism, the quickest penetration, and coolest prudence, united to form the character of Gama. On his appointment to the command, he confessed to the king that his mind had long aspired to this expedition. The king expressed great confidence in his prudence and honour, and gave him, with his own hand, the colours which he was to carry. On this banner, which bore the cross of the military order of Christ, Gama, with great enthusiasm to merit the honours bestowed upon him, took the oath of fidelity. About four miles from Lisbon there is a chapel on the sea side. To this, the day before their departure, Gama conducted the companions of his expedition. He was to encounter an ocean untried, and dreaded as unnavigable, and he knew the force of the ties of religion on minds which are not inclined to dispute its authority. The whole night was spent in the chapel in prayers for success, and in the rites of their devotion. On the next day, when the adventurers marched to the fleet, the shore of Belem  36 presented one of the most solemn and affecting scenes perhaps recorded in history. The beach was covered with the inhabitants of Lisbon. A numerous procession of priests in their robes sung anthems and offered up invocations to heaven. Every one beheld the adventurers as brave innocent men going to a dreadful execution, as rushing upon certain death; and the vast multitude caught the fire of devotion, and joined aloud in the prayers for success. The relations, friends, and acquaintances of the voyagers wept; all were affected; the sigh was general; Gama himself shed some manly tears on parting with his friends, but he hurried over the tender scene, and hastened aboard with all the alacrity of hope. Immediately he gave his sails to the wind, and so much affected were the many thousands who beheld his departure, that they remained unmoveable on the shore till the fleet, under full fail, evanished from their fight. It was on the 8th of July when Gama left the Tagus. The flag ship was commanded by himself, the second by his brother, the third by Coello, and the store ship by Gonsalo Nunio. Several interpreters, skilled in the Ethiopian, Arabic, and other oriental languages, went along with them. Ten malefactors, men of abilities, whose sentences of death were reversed, on condition of their obedience to Gama in whatever embassies or dangers among the barbarians he might think proper to employ them, were also on board. The fleet, favoured by the weather, passed the Canary and Cape de Verde islands, but had now to encounter other fortune. Sometimes stopped by dead calms, but for the most part tost by tempests, which increased their violence and horrors as they proceeded to the south. Thus driven far to sea they laboured through that wide ocean which surrounds St. Helena, in seas, says Faria, unknown to the Portuguese discoverers, none of whom had failed so far to the west. From the 28th of July, the day they passed the isle of St. James, they had seen no shore, and now on November the 4th they were happily relieved by the sight of land. The fleet anchored in a large  37 bay, and Coello was sent in search of a river where they might take in wood and fresh water. Having found one convenient for their purpose the fleet made toward it, and Gama, whose orders were to acquaint himself with the manners of the people wherever he touched, ordered a party of his men to bring him some of the natives by force or stratagem. One they caught as he was gathering honey on the side of a mountain, and brought him to the fleet. He expressed the greatest indifference of the gold and fine clothes which they shewed him, but was greatly delighted with some glasses and little brass bells. These with great joy he accepted, and was set on shore; and soon after many of the blacks came for, and were gratified with the like trifles; and for which in return they gave great plenty of their best provisions. None of Gama's interpreters, however, could understand a word of their language or receive any information of India. And the friendly intercourse between the fleet and the natives was soon interrupted by the imprudence of Veloso, a young Portuguese, which occasioned a scuffle, wherein Gama's life was endangered. Gama and some others were on shore taking the altitude of the sun, when in consequence of Veloso's rashness they were attacked by the blacks with great fury. Gama defended himself with an oar, and received a dart in his foot. Several others were likewise wounded, and they found their safety in retreat. The shot from the ships facilitated their escape, and Gama esteeming it imprudent to waste his strength in attempts entirely foreign to the design of his voyage, weighed anchor, and steered in search of the extremity of Afric. In this part of the voyage, says Osorius, in illo autem cursu vald e Gamae virtus enituit \---The heroism of Gama was greatly displayed. The waves swelled like mountains in height, the ships seemed now heaved up to the clouds, and now appeared as precipitated by gulphy whirlpools to the bed of the ocean. The winds were piercing cold, and so boisterous that the pilot's voice could seldom be heard, and a dismal, almost continual darkness, which at that tempestuous season involves these seas, added all its horrors. Sometimes the storm drove them southward, at other times they were obliged to stand on the tack and yield to its fury, preserving what they had gained with the greatest difficulty. With such mad seas the daring Gama fought For many a day, and many a dreadful night, Incessant labouring round the stormy Cape, By bold ambition led--- During any gloomy interval of the storm, the sailors, wearied out with fatigue, and abandoned to despair, surrounded Gama, and implored him not to suffer himself, and those committed to his care, to perish by so dreadful a death. The impossibility that men so weakened should stand it much longer, and the opinion that this ocean was torn by eternal tempests, and therefore had hitherto been, and was unpassable, were urged. But Gama's resolution to proceed was unalterable  38 . A formidable conspiracy was then formed against his life. But his brother discovered it, and the courage and prudence of Gama defeated its design. He put the chief conspirators and all the pilots in irons, and he himself, his brother, Coello, and some others, stood night and day to the helms and directed the course. At last, after having many days, with unconquered mind, withstood the tempest and an enraged mutiny (molem perfidi ae) the storm suddenly ceased, and they beheld the Cape of Good Hope. On November the 20th all the fleet doubled that promontory, and steering northward, coasted along a rich and beautiful shore, adorned with large forests and numberless herds of cattle. All was now alacrity; the hope that they had surmounted every danger revived their spirits, and the admiral was beloved and admired. Here, and at the bay, which they named St. Blas, they took in provisions, and beheld these beautiful rural scenes, described by Camoens. And here the store sloop, now of no farther service, was burnt by order of the admiral. On December the 8th a violent tempest drove the fleet from the sight of land, and carried them to that dreadful current which made the Moors deem it impossible to double the Cape. Gama, however, though unlucky in the time of navigating these seas, was safely carried over the current by the violence of a tempest; and having recovered the sight of land, as his safest course, he steered northward along the coast. On the 10th of January they descried, about 230 miles from their last watering place, some beautiful islands, with herds of cattle frisking in the meadows. It was a profound calm, and Gama stood near to land. The natives were better dressed and more civilized than those they had hitherto seen. An exchange of presents was made, and the black king was so pleased with the politeness of Gama, that he came aboard his ship to see him. At this place, which he named Terra de Natal, Gama left two of the malefactors, to procure what information they could against his return. On the 15th of January, in the dusk of the evening, they came to the mouth of a large river, whose banks were shaded with trees loaded with fruit. On the return of day they saw several little boats with palm-tree leaves making towards them, and the natives came aboard without hesitation or fear. Gama received them kindly, gave them an entertainment, and some silken garments, which they received with visible joy. Only one of them however could speak a little broken Arabic. From him Fernan Martinho learned, that not far distant was a country where ships, in shape and size like Gama's, frequently resorted. This gave the fleet great spirits, and the admiral named this place The River of Good Signs. Here, while Gama careened and refitted his ships, the crews were attacked with a violent scurvy, which carried off several of his men. Having taken in fresh provisions, on the 24th of February he set sail, and on the first of March they descried four islands on the coast of Mozambic. From one of these they perceived seven vessels in full sail bearing to the fleet. These knew Gama's ship by the admiral's ensign, and made up to her, saluting her with loud huzzas and their instruments of music. Gama received them aboard, and entertained them with great kindness. The interpreters talked with them in Arabic. The island, in which was the principal harbour and trading town, they said, was governed by a deputy of the king of Quiloa; and many Saracen merchants, they added, were settled here, who traded with Arabia, India, and other parts of the world. Gama was overjoyed, and the crew with uplifted hands returned thanks to heaven. Pleased with the presents which Gama sent him, and imagining that the Portuguese were Mohammedans from Morocco, Zacocia the governor, dressed in rich embroidery, came to congratulate the admiral on his arrival in the East. As he approached the fleet in great pomp, Gama removed the sick out of sight, and ordered all those in health to attend above deck, armed in the Portuguese manner; for he foresaw what would happen when the Mohammedans should discover it was a Christian fleet. During the entertainment provided for him, Zacocia seemed highly pleased, and asked several questions about the arms and religion of the strangers. Gama shewed him his arms, and explained the force of his cannon, but he did not affect to know much about religion; however he frankly promised to shew him his books of devotion whenever a few days refreshment would give him a more convenient time. In the meanwhile he intreated Zacocia to send him some pilots who might conduct him to India. Two pilots were next day brought by the governor, a treaty of peace was solemnly concluded, and every office of mutual friendship seemed to promise a lasting harmony. But it was soon interrupted. Zacocia, as soon as he found the Portuguese were Christians, used every endeavour to destroy the fleet. The life of Gama was attempted. One of the Moorish pilots deserted, and some of the Portuguese, who were on shore to get fresh water, were attacked by seven barks of the natives, but were rescued by a timely assistance from the ships. Besides the hatred of the Christian name, inspired by their religion, the Mohammedan Arabs had other reasons to wish the destruction of Gama. Before this period, these Arabs were almost the only merchants of the East; they had colonies in every place convenient for trade, and were the sole masters of the Ethiopian, Arabian, and Indian seas. They clearly foresaw the consequences of the arrival of Europeans, and every art was soon exerted to prevent such formidable rivals from effecting any footing in the East. To these Mohammedan traders, the Portuguese, on account of their religion, gave the name of Moors. Immediately after the skirmish at the watering-place, Gama, having one Moorish pilot, set sail, but was soon driven back to the same island by tempestuous weather. He now resolved to take in fresh water by force. The Moors perceived his intention, about two thousand of whom rising from ambush, attacked the Portuguese detachment. But the prudence of Gama had not been asleep. His ships were stationed with art, and his artillery not only dispersed the hostile Moors, but reduced their town, which was built of wood, into a heap of ashes. Among some prisoners taken by Paulus de Gama was a pilot, and Zacocia begging forgiveness for his treachery, sent another, whose skill in navigation he greatly commended. A war with the Moors was now begun. Gama perceived that their jealousy of European rivals gave him nothing to expect but open hostility and secret treachery; and he knew what numerous colonies they had on every trading coast of the East. To impress them therefore with the terror of his arms on their first act of treachery, was worthy of a great commander. Nor was he remiss in his attention to the chief pilot, who had been last sent. He perceived in him a kind of anxious endeavour to bear near some little islands, and suspecting there were unseen rocks in that course, he confidently charged the pilot with guilt, and ordered him to be severely whipped. The punishment produced a confession and promises of fidelity. And he now advised Gama to stand for Quiloa, which he assured him was inhabited by Christians. Three Ethiopian Christians had come aboard the fleet while at Zacocia's island, and the current opinions of Prester John's country inclined Gama to try if he could find a port, where he might expect the assistance of a people of his own religion. A violent storm however drove the fleet from Quiloa, and being now near Mombaze, the pilot advised him to enter that harbour, where, he said, there were also many Christians. The city of Mombaza is agreeably situated on an island, formed by a river which empties itself into the sea by two mouths. The buildings are lofty and of firm stone, and the country abounds with fruit trees and cattle. Gama, happy to find a harbour where every thing wore the appearance of civilization, ordered the fleet to cast anchor, which was scarcely done, when a galley, in which were 100 men in Turkish habit, armed with bucklers and sabres, rowed up to the flag ship. All of these seemed desirous to come aboard, but only four, who by their dress seemed officers, were admitted; nor were these allowed, till stript of their arms. As soon as on board, they extolled the prudence of Gama in refusing admittance to armed strangers; and by their behaviour, seemed desirous to gain the good opinion of the fleet. Their country, they boasted, contained all the riches of India, and their king, they professed, was ambitious of entering into a friendly treaty with the Portuguese, with whose renown he was well acquainted. And that a conference with his majesty and the offices of friendship might be rendered more convenient, Gama was requested and advised to enter the harbour. As no place could be more commodious for the recovery of the sick, and the whole fleet was sickly, Gama resolved to enter the port; and in the meanwhile sent two of the pardoned criminals as an embassy to the king. These the king treated with the greatest kindness, ordered his officers to shew them the strength and opulence of his city; and on their return to the navy, he sent a present to Gama of the most valuable spices, of which he boasted such abundance, that the Portuguese, he said, if they regarded their own interest, would seek for no other India. To make treaties of commerce was the business of Gama; one so advantageous, and so desired by the natives, was therefore not to be refused. Fully satisfied by the report of his spies, he ordered to weigh anchor and enter the harbour. His own ship led the way, when a sudden violence of the tide, made Gama apprehensive of running aground. He therefore ordered the sails to be furled and the anchors to be dropt, and gave a signal for the rest of the fleet to follow his example. This mainoeuvre, and the cries of the sailors in executing it, alarmed the Mozambic pilots. Conscious of their treachery, they thought their design was discovered, and leapt into the sea. Some boats of Mombaza took them up, and refusing to put them on board, set them safely on shore, though the admiral repeatedly demanded the restoration of the pilots. These circumstances, evident proofs of treachery, were farther confirmed by the behaviour of the king of Mombaza. In the middle of the night Gama thought he heard some noise, and on examination, found his fleet surrounded by a great number of Moors, who, in the utmost privacy, endeavoured to cut his cables. But their scheme was defeated; and some Arabs, who remained on board, confessed that no Christians were resident either at Quiloa or Mombaza. The storm which drove them from the one place, and their late escape at the other, were now beheld as manifestations of the Divine favour, and Gama, holding up his hands to heaven, ascribed his safety to the care of Provividence  39 . Two days, however, elapsed, before they could get clear of the rocky bay of Mombaze, and having now ventured to hoist their sails, they steered for Melinda, a port, they had been told, where many merchants from India resorted. In their way thither they took a Moorish vessel, out of which Gama selected fourteen prisoners, one of whom he perceived by his mein to be a person of distinction. By this Saracen, Gama was informed, that he was near Melinda, that the king was hospitable, and celebrated for his faith, and that four ships from India, commanded by Christian masters, were in that harbour. The Saracen also offered to go as Gama's messenger to the king, and promised to procure him an able pilot to conduct him to Calicut, the chief port of India. As the coast of Melinda appeared to be dangerous, Gama anchored at some distance from the city, and unwilling to hazard any of his men, he landed the Saracen on an island opposite to Melinda. This was observed, and the stranger was brought before the king, to whom he gave so favourable an account of the politeness and humanity of Gama, that a present of several sheep, and fruits of all sorts, was sent by his majesty to the admiral, who had the happiness to find the truth of what his prisoner had told him, confirmed by the masters of the four ships from India. These were Christians from Cambaya. They were transported with joy on the arrival of the Portuguese, and gave several useful instructions to the admiral. The city of Melinda was situated in a fertile plain, surrounded with gardens and groves of orange-trees, whose flowers diffused a most grateful odour. The pastures were covered with herds, and the houses built of square stones, were both elegant and magnificent. Desirous to make an alliance with such a state, Gama requited the civility of the king with great generosity. He drew nearer the shore, and urged his instructions as apology for not landing to wait upon his majesty in person. The apology was accepted, and the king, whose age and infirmity prevented himself, sent his son to congratulate Gama, and enter into a treaty of friendship. The prince, who had sometime governed under the direction of his father, came in great pomp. His dress was royally magnificent, the nobles who attended him displayed all the riches of silk and embroidery, and the music of Melinda resounded all over the bay. Gama, to express his regard, met him in the admiral's barge. The prince, as soon as he came up, leapt into it, and distinguishing the admiral by his habit, embraced him with all the intimacy of old friendship. In their conversation, which was long and sprightly, he discovered nothing of the barbarian, says Osorius, but in every thing shewed an intelligence and politeness worthy of his high rank. He accepted the fourteen Moors, whom Gama gave to him, with great pleasure. He seemed to view Gama with enthusiasm, and confessed that the make of the Portuguese ships, so much superior to what he had seen, convinced him of the greatness of that people. He gave Gama an able pilot, named Melemo Cana, to conduct him to Calicut; and requested, that on his return to Europe, he would carry an ambassador with him to the Court of Lisbon. During the few days the fleet stayed at Melinda, the mutual friendship increased, and a treaty of alliance was concluded. And now, on April 22, resigning the helm to his skillful and honest pilot, Gama hoisted sail and steered to the north. In a few days they passed the line, and the Portuguese with extacy beheld the appearance of their native sky. Orion, Ursa major and minor, and the other stars about the northern pole, were now a more joyful discovery than the south  40 pole had formerly been to them. The pilot now stood to the east, through the Indian ocean, and after sailing about three weeks, he had the happiness to congratulate Gama on the view of the mountains of Calicut. Gama, transported with extacy, returned thanks to heaven, and ordered all his prisoners to be set at liberty, that every heart might taste of the joy of his successful voyage. About two leagues from Calicut Gama ordered the fleet to anchor, and was soon surrounded by a number of boats. By one of these he sent one of the pardoned criminals to the city. The appearance of an unknown fleet on their coast brought immense crowds around the stranger, who no sooner entered Calicut, than he was lifted from his feet and carried hither and thither by the concourse. Though the populace and the stranger were alike earnest to be understood, their language was unintelligible to each other, till, happy for Gama in the event, a Moorish merchant accosted his messenger in the Spanish tongue. The next day this Moor, who was named Monzaida, waited upon Gama on board his ship. He was a native of Tunis, and the chief person, he said, with whom John II. had at that port contracted for military stores. He was a man of abilities and great intelligence of the world, and an admirer of the Portuguese valour and honour. The engaging behaviour of Gama heightened his esteem into the sincerest attachment. He offered to be interpreter for the admiral, and to serve him in whatever besides he might possibly befriend him. And thus, by one of those unforeseen circumstances, which often decide the greatest events, Gama received a friend, who soon rendered him the most critical and important service. At the first interview, Monzaida gave Gama the fullest information of the clime, extent, customs, religions, and various riches of India, the commerce of the Moors, and the character of the sovereign. Calicut was not only the imperial city, but the greatest port. The king or Zamorim, who resided here, was acknowledged as emperor by the neighbouring princes; and as his revenue consisted chiefly of duties on merchandise, he had always encouraged the resort of foreigners to his harbours. Pleased with this promising prospect, Gama sent two of his officers with Monzaida to wait upon the Zamorim at his palace of Pandarene, a few miles from the city. They were admitted to the royal apartment, and delivered their embassy; to which the Zamorim replied, that the arrival of the admiral of so great a prince as Emmanuel, gave him inexpressible pleasure, and that he would willingly embrace the offered alliance. In the meanwhile, as their present station was extreamly dangerous, he advised them to bring the ships nearer to Pandarene, and for this purpose he sent a pilot to the fleet. A few days after this, the Zamorim sent his first minister, or Catual, attended by several of the Nayres, or nobility, to conduct Gama to the royal palace. As an interview with the Zamorim was absolutely necessary to compleat the purpose of his voyage, Gama immediately agreed to it, though the treachery he had already experienced since his arrival in the eastern seas, shewed him the personal danger which he thus hazarded. He gave his brother Paulus and Coello the command of the fleet in his absence; and in the orders he left them, displayed a heroism superior to that of Alexander, when he crossed the Granicus. That of the Macedonian was ferocious and frantic, the offspring of vicious ambition; that of Gama was the child of the strongest reason, begotten upon the most valorous mental dignity: It was the high pride of honour, a pride, of which the man, who in the fury of battle can rush on to the mouth of a cannon, may be utterly incapable. The revenue of the Zamorim arose chiefly from the traffic of the Moors; the various colonies of these people were combined in one interest, and the jealousy and consternation which his arrival in the eastern seas had spread among them, were circumstances well known to Gama: And he knew also what he had to expect, both from their force and their fraud. But duty and honour required him to compleat the purpose of his voyage. He left peremptory command, that if he was detained a prisoner, or any attempt made upon his life, they should take no step to save him, or to reverse his fate; to give ear to no message which might come in his name for such purpose, and to enter into no negociation on his behalf. Though they were to keep some boats near the shore, to favour his escape if he perceived treachery ere detained by force; yet the moment that force rendered his escape impracticable, they were to set sail, and carry the tidings to the king. For as this was his only concern, he would suffer no risk that might lose a man, or endanger the homeward voyage. Having left these unalterable orders, he went ashore with the Catual, attended only by twelve of his own men, for he would not weaken his fleet, though he knew the pomp of attendance would in one respect have been greatly in his favour at the first court of India. As soon as landed, he and the Catual were carried in great pomp, in sofas, upon means shoulders, to the chief temple, and from thence, amid immense crouds, to the royal palace. The apartment and dress of the Zamorim were such as might be expected from the luxury and wealth of India. The emperor lay reclined on a magnificent couch, surrounded with his nobility and officers of state. Gama was introduced to him by a venerable old man, the chief Bramin. His majesty, by a gentle nod, appointed the Admiral to sit on one of the steps of his sofa, and then demanded his embassy. It was against the custom of his country, Gama replied, to deliver his instructions in a public assembly, he therefore desired that the king and a few of his ministers would grant him a private audience. This was complied with, and Gama, in a manly speech, set forth the greatness of his sovereign Emmanual, the fame he had heard of the Zamorim, and the desire he had to enter into an alliance with so great a prince; nor were the mutual advantages of such a treaty omitted by the Admiral. The Zamorim, in reply, professed great esteem for the friendship of the king of Portugal, and declared his readiness to enter into a friendly alliance. He then ordered the Catual to provide proper apartments for Gama in his own house; and having promised another conference, he dismissed the Admiral with all the appearance of sincerity. The character of this monarch is strongly marked in the history of Portuguese Asia. Avarice was his ruling passion; he was haughty or mean, bold or timorous, as his interest rose or fell in the ballance of his judgment; wavering and irresolute whenever the scales seemed doubtful which to preponderate. He was pleased with the prospect of bringing the commerce of Europe to his harbours, but he was also influenced by the threats of the Moors. Three days elapsed ere Gama was again permitted to see the Zamorim. At this second audience he presented the letter and presents of Emmanuel. The letter was received with politeness, but the presents were viewed with an eye of contempt. Gama beheld it, and said he only came to discover the route to India, and therefore was not charged with valuable gifts, ere the friendship of the state, where they might chuse to traffic, was known. Yet that indeed he brought the most valuable of all gifts, the offer of the friendship of his sovereign, and the commerce of his country. He then entreated the king not to reveal the contents of Emmanuel's letter to the Moors, and the king with great seeming friendship desired Gama to guard against the perfidy of that people. And at this time, it is highly probable, the Zamorim was sincere. Every hour since the arrival of the fleet, the Moors had held secret conferences. That one man of it might not return was their purpose; and every method to accomplish this was meditated. To influence the king against the Portuguese, to assassinate Gama, to raise a general insurrection to destroy the foreign navy, and to bribe the Catual, were determined. And the Catual, the master of the house where Gama was lodged, accepted the bribe, and entered into their interest. Of all these circumstances, however, Gama was apprised by his faithful interpreter Monzaida, whose affection to the foreign Admiral the Moors hitherto had not suspected. Thus informed, and having obtained the faith of an alliance from the sovereign of the first port of India, Gama resolved to elude the plots of the Moors; and accordingly, before the dawn, he set out for Pandarene, in hope to get aboard his fleet by some of the boats which he had ordered to hover about the shore. But the Moors were vigilant. His escape was immediately known, and the Catual, by the king's order, pursued and brought him back by force. The Catual, however, for it was necessary for their schemes to have the ships in their power, behaved with politeness to the Admiral, and promised to use all his interest in his behalf. The eagerness of the Moors now contributed to the safety of Gama. Their principal merchants were admitted to a formal audience, when one of their orators accused the Portuguese as a nation of faithless plunderers: Gama, he said, was an exiled pirate, who had marked his course with blood and depredation. If he were not a pirate, still there was no excuse for giving such warlike foreigners any footing in a country already supplied with all that nature and commerce could give. He expatiated on the great services which the Moorish traders had rendered to Calicut, or wherever they settled; and ended with a threat, that all the Moors would leave the Zamorim's ports, and find some other settlement, if he permitted these foreigners any share in the commerce of his dominions. However staggered with these arguments and threats, the Zamorim was not blind to the self-interest and malice of the Moors. He therefore ordered, that the Admiral should once more be brought before him. In the meanwhile the Catual tried many stratagems to get the fleet into the harbour; and at last, in the name of his master, made an absolute demand that the sails and rudders should be delivered up, as the pledge of Gama's honesty. But these demands were as absolutely refused by Gama, who sent a letter to his brother by Monzaida, enforcing his former orders in the strongest manner, declaring that his fate gave him no concern, that he was only unhappy lest the fruits of all their fatigue and dangers should be lost. After two days spent in vain altercation with the Catual, Gama was brought as a prisoner before the king. The king repeated his accusation, upbraided him with non-compliance to the requests of his minister, yet urged him, if he were an exile or pirate, to confess freely, in which case he promised to take him into his service, and highly promote him on account of his abilities. But Gama, who with great spirit had baffled all the stratagems of the Catual, behaved with the same undaunted bravery before the king. He asserted his innocence, pointed out the malice of the Moors, and the improbability of his piracy; boasted of the safety of his fleet, offered his life rather than his sails and rudders, and concluded with threats in the name of his sovereign. The Zamorim, during the whole conference, eyed Gama with the keenest attention, and clearly perceived in his unfaultering mein the dignity of truth, and the consciousness that he was the Admiral of a great monarch. In their late address, the Moors had treated the Zamorim as somewhat dependant upon them, and he saw that a commerce with other nations would certainly lessen their dangerous importance. His avarice strongly desired the commerce of Portugal; and his pride was flattered in humbling the Moors. After many proposals, it was at last agreed, that of his twelve attendants he should leave seven as hostages, that what goods were aboard his fleet should be landed, and that Gama should be safely conducted to his ship, after which the treaty of commerce and alliance was to be finally settled. And thus, when the assassination of Gama seemed inevitable, the Zamorim suddenly dropt the demand of the sails and the rudders, rescued him from his determined enemies, and restored him to liberty and the command of his navy. As soon as he was aboard  41 the goods were landed, accompanied by a letter from Gama to the Zamorim, wherein he boldly complained of the treachery of the Catual. The Zamorim, in answer, promised to make enquiry, and to punish him if guilty, but did nothing in the affair. Gama, who had now anchored nearer to the city, every day sent two or three different persons on some business to Calicut, that as many of his men as possible might be able to give some account of India. The Moors, in the meanwhile, every day assaulted the ears of the king, who now began to waver; when Gama, who had given every proof of his desire of peace and friendship, sent another letter, in which he requested the Zamorim to permit him to leave a consul at Calicut to manage the affairs of king Emmanuel. But to this request, the most reasonable result of a commercial treaty, the Zamorim returned a refusal full of rage and indignation. Gama, now fully master of the character of the Zamorim, resolved to treat a man of such an inconstant dishonourable disposition with a contemptuous silence. This contempt was felt by the king, who yielding to the advice of the Catual and the entreaties of the Moors, seized the Portuguese goods, and ordered two of the seven hostages, the two who had the charge of the cargo, to be put in irons. The Admiral remonstrated by the means of Monzaida, but the king still persisted in his treacherous breach of royal faith. Repeated solicitations made him more haughty, and it was now the duty and interest of Gama to use force. He took a vessel, in which were six Nayres or noblemen, and nineteen of their servants. The servants he set ashore to relate the tidings, the noblemen he detained. As soon as the news had time to spread through the city, he hoisted his sails, and, though with a slow motion, seemed to proceed on his homeward voyage. The city was now in an uproar; the friends of the captive noblemen surrounded the palace, and loudly accused the policy of the Moors. The king, in all the perplexed distress of a haughty, avaritious, weak prince, sent after Gama, delivered up all the hostages, and submitted to his proposals; nay, even solicitated that an agent should be left, and even descended to the meanness of a palpable lie. The two factors, he said, he had put in irons, only to detain them till he might write letters to his brother Emmanuel, and the goods he had kept on shore that an agent might be sent to dispose of them. Gama, however, perceived a mysterious trifling, and, previous to any treaty, insisted upon the restoration of the goods. The day after this altercation Monzaida came aboard the fleet in great perturbation. The Moors, he said, had raised great commotions, and had enraged the king against the Portuguese. The king's ships were getting ready, and a numerous Moorish fleet from Mecca was daily expected. To delay Gama till this force arrived, was the purpose of the court and of the Moors, who were now confident of success. To this information Monzaida added, that the Moors, suspecting his attachment to Gama, had determined to assassinate him. That he had narrowly escaped from them; that it was impossible for him to recover his effects, and that his only hope was in the protection of Gama. Gama rewarded him with the friendship he merited, took him with him, as he desired, to Lisbon, and procured him a recompence for his services. Almost immediately after Monzaida, seven boats arrived, loaded with the goods, and demanded the restoration of the captive noblemen. Gama took the goods on board, but refused to examine if they were entire, and also refused to deliver the prisoners. He had been promised an ambassador to his sovereign, he said, but had been so often deluded, he could trust such a faithless people no longer, and would therefore carry the captives in his power to convince the king of Portugal what insults and injustice his ambassador and admiral had suffered from the Zamorim of Calicut. Having thus dismissed the Indians, he fired his cannon and hoisted his sails. A calm, however, detained him on the coast some days, and the Zamorim seizing the opportunity, sent what vessels he could fit out, twenty of a larger size, sixty in all, full of armed men, to attack him. Though Gama's cannon were well played, confident of their numbers, they pressed on to board him, when a sudden tempest, which Gama's ships rode out in safety, miserably dispersed the Indian fleet, and compleated their ruin. After this victory the Admiral made a halt at a little island near the shore, where he erected a cross  42 , bearing the name and arms of his Portuguese majesty. And from this place, by the hand of Monzaida, he wrote a letter to the Zamorim, wherein he gave a full and circumstantial account of all the plots of the Catual and the Moors. Still, however, he professed his desire of a commercial treaty, and promised to represent the Zamorim in the best light to Emmanuel. The prisoners, he said, should be kindly used, were only kept as ambassadors to his sovereign, and should be returned to India when they were enabled from experience to give an account of Portugal. The letter he sent by one of the captives, who by this means obtained his liberty. The fame of Gama had now spread over the Indian seas, and the Moors were every where intent on his destruction. As he was near the shore of Anchediva, he beheld the appearance of a floating isle, covered with trees, advance towards him. But his prudence was not to be thus deceived. A bold pirate, named Timoja, by linking together eight vessels full of men and covered with green boughs, thought to board him by surprize. But Gama's cannon made seven of them fly; the eighth, loaded with fruits and provision, he took. The beautiful island of Anchediva now offered a convenient place to careen his ships and refresh his men. While he staid here, the first minister of Zabajo king of Goa, one of the most powerful princes of India, came on board, and in the name of his master, congratulated the Admiral in the Italian tongue. Provisions, arms and money were offered to Gama, and he was entreated to accept the friendship of Zabajo. The Admiral was struck with admiration, the address and abilities of the minister appeared so conspicuous. He said he was an Italian by birth, but in sailing to Greece, had been taken by pirates, and after various misfortunes, had been necessitated to enter into the service of a Mohammedan prince, the nobleness of whose disposition he commended in the highest terms. Yet, with all his abilities, Gama perceived an artful inquisitiveness, that nameless something which does not accompany simple honesty. After a long conference, Gama abruptly upbraided him as a spy, and ordered him to be put to the torture ---And this soon brought a confession, that he was a Polonian Jew by birth, and was sent to examine the strength of the fleet by Zabajo, who was mustering all his power to attack the Portuguese. Gama on this immediately set sail, and took the spy along with him, who soon after was baptized, and named Jasper de Gama, the Admiral being his godfather. Afterwards he became of great service to Emmanuel. Gama now stood westward through the Indian ocean, and after being long delayed by calms, arrived off Magadoxa, on the coast of Africa. This place was a principal port of the Moors; he therefore levelled the walls of the city with his cannon, and burned and destroyed all the ships in the harbour. Soon after this he descried eight Moorish vessels bearing down upon him; his artillery, however, soon made them use their oars in flight, nor could Gama overtake any of them for want of wind. The hospitable harbour of Melinda was the next place he reached. His men, almost worn out with fatigue and sickness, here received, a second time, every assistance which an accomplished and generous prince could bestow. And having taken an ambassdor on board, he again set sail, in hope that he might pass the Cape of Good Hope while the favourable weather continued, for his acquaintance with the eastern seas now suggested to him, that the tempestuous season was periodical. Soon after he set sail his brother's ship struck on a sand bank, and was burnt by order of the admiral. His brother and part of the crew he took into his own ship, the rest he sent on board of Coello; nor were more hands now alive than were necessary to man the two vessels which remained. Having taken in provisions at the island of Zanzibar, where they were kindly entertained by a Mohammedan prince of the same sect with the king of Melinda, they safely doubled the Cape of Good Hope on April 26, 1499, and continued till they reached the island of St. Iago in favourable weather. But a tempest here separated the two ships, and gave Gama and Coello an opportunity to shew the goodness of their hearts, in a manner which does honour to human nature. The Admiral was now near the Azores, when Paulus de Gama, long worn with fatigue and sickness, was unable to endure the motion of the ship. Vasco, therefore, put into the island of Tercera, in hope of his brother's recovery. And such was his affection, that rather than leave him, he gave the command of his ship to one of his officers. But the hope of recovery was vain. John de Sa proceeded to Lisbon with the flag ship, while the admiral remained behind to soothe the death bed of his brother, and perform his funeral rites. Coello, in the mean while, landed at Lisbon, and hearing that Gama was not arrived, imagined he might either be shipwrecked or beating about in distress. Without seeing one of his family, he immediately set sail, on purpose to bring relief to his friend and Admiral. But this generous design, more the effect of friendship than just consideration, was prevented by an order from the king, ere he got out of the Tagus. The particulars of the voyage were now diffused by Coello, and the joy of the king was only equalled by the admiration of the people. Yet while all the nation was fired with zeal to express their esteem of the happy Admiral, he himself, the man who was such an enthusiast to the success of his voyage, that he would willingly have sacrificed his life in India to secure that success, was now in the completion of it a dejected mourner. The compliments of the court and the shouts of the street were irksome to him, for his brother, the companion of his toils and dangers, was not there to share the joy. As soon as he had waited on the king, he shut himself up in a lonely house near the sea side at Bethlehem, from whence it was sometime ere he was drawn to mingle in public life. During this important expedition, two years and almost two months elapsed. Of 160 men who went out, only 55 returned. These were all rewarded by the king. Coello was pensioned with 100 ducats a year and made a fidalgo, or gentleman of the king's houshold, a degree of nobility in Portugal. The title of Don was annexed to the family of Vasco de Gama; he was appointed admiral of the eastern seas, with an annual salary of 3000 ducats, and a part of the king's arms was added to his. Public thanksgivings to heaven were celebrated throughout the churches of the kingdom, and feasts, interludes, and chivalrous entertainments, the taste of that age, demonstrated the joy of Portugal. As the prophetic Song in the tenth Lusiad requires a commentary, we shall now proceed to a compendious history of the negociations and wars of the Portuguese in India; a history, though very little known, of the utmost importance to every commercial state, particularly to that nation which now commands the trade of the East. The power, interest, and disposition of the Moors, the masters of the eastern seas, pointed out to Emmanuel what course he ought to follow, if he intended to reap either honour or advantage from the discovery of India. The accumulated treachery of the Moors had kindled a war; force was now necessary; a fleet therefore of thirteen sail and 1500 men was fitted out for India, and the command of it given to an experienced officer, Pedro Alvarez de Cabral. The chief instructions of Cabral, were to enter into a treaty of friendship with the Zamorim, and to obtain leave to build a fort and factory near Calicut. But if he found that prince still perfidious and averse to an alliance, he was to proceed to hostilities on the first instance of treachery. Cabral, in this voyage, was driven to America by a tempest, and was the first who discovered the Brazils. As he doubled the south of Africa, he encountered a most dreadful storm; the heavens were covered with pitchy darkness for many days, and the waves and winds vied with each other in noise and fury. Four ships, with all their crews, perished; among whom was the celebrated Bartholomew Diaz, the discoverer of the Cape of Good Hope, which, as if prophetic of his fate, he had named the Cape of Tempests. When Cabral reached the coast of Zofala, he had only six ships. Here he engaged two Moorish vessels, laden mostly with gold dust, and took them. But finding they were commanded by, and belonged to Foteyma, an uncle of the king of Melinda, he not only restored the prizes, but treated the Xeque with the greatest courtesy. At Mozambique he agreed with a pilot to conduct him to Quiloa. The king of this place and the admiral had a pompous interview. An alliance was solemnly concluded. But Homeris, brother to the king of Melinda, was at Quiloa; and by him Cabral was informed of a treacherous preparation to attack him. As his destination was for Calicut, he delayed revenge, and proceeded to Melinda. Here he landed the Melindian ambassador, who had been sent to Portugal; and here his generous treatment of the Xeque Foteyma strengthened the friendship and good offices which had begun with Gama. When he arrived at Calicut, whether he was conducted by two Melindian pilots, he sent Ayres Correa on shore to settle the manner how the Zamorim and the admiral were to meet. Six principal Bramins, whose names were brought from Portugal by the advice of Monzaida, were given as hostages for the safety of the admiral; and the Indian noblemen, who had been carried away by Gama, were returned. After much delay with the wavering Zamorim, a commercial alliance, by which the Portuguese vessels were to receive their lading before those of any other nation, was solemnly confirmed by oath, and a house was appointed as a factory for the Portuguese; of which Correa, with seventy men under his command, took immediate possession. The history of an infant settlement is like that of infant Rome; if the smallest circumstances are not attended to, the secret springs of action escape us, and we are sure to be led into error. Cabral's fleet was to be laded with spicery; but the Moorish merchants, still intent on the ruin of their rivals the Portuguese, did every thing in their power to retard it, in hope of another rupture. While promises to Cabral trifled away the time, the Zamorim desired his assistance to take a large ship belonging to the king of Cochin, who not only intended to invade his dominions, but also had refused to sell him an elephant which was now aboard that ship. There were two Moorish agents with whom Cabral was obliged to transact business. To Coje Bequi he paid the greatest respect, for he found him most worthy of it; but Cemireci, the other, pretending great friendship to Cabral, advised him by all means to gratify the Zamorim by taking the ship of Cochin. This vessel was large and full of soldiers, but Cabral appointed one of his smallest, commanded by Pedro Ataide, not a sixth part of her size, to attack her. When Ataide first made towards the enemy, the Indian insulted him with every sign of reproach; but the Portuguese cannon drove her into the port of Cananor, a place forty miles to the north of Calicut. Here she lay all the night, while Ataide watched the mouth of the harbour; and fearing to be burnt in the port, in the morning she again took to sea. But Ataide soon came up with her, and by the dexterous use of his artillery, made her steer what course he pleased, and at last drove her in triumph before him into the harbour of Calicut. This affair was of great consequence to the Portuguese. It not only raised a high idea of their valour and art of war, but it discovered a scene of treachery, and gave them a most beneficial opportunity to display their integrity and honour. When Cabral conversed with the captives, he found that the story of the elephant and the invasion were false, and that they had been warned by Cemireci, that the Portuguese, a set of lawless pirates, intended to attack them. On this, Cabral not only restored the ship to the king of Cochin, but paid for what damage she had sustained, and assured him he had been abused by the villainy of the Moors. The Zamorim professed the greatest admiration of the Portuguese valour, yet while he pretended to value their friendship at the highest rate, he used every art to delay the lading of their ships. Twenty days was the time stipulated for this purpose, but three months were now elapsed, and nothing done. Cabral several time complained to the Zamorim of the infringement of treaty, that many Moorish vessels had been suffered to lade, while he could obtain no cargo. The Zamorim complained of the arts of the Moors, and gave Cabral an order, on paying for the goods, to unlade whatever Moorish vessels he pleased, and to supply his own. Cabral, however, was apprehensive of some deep design, and delayed to put this order in execution: urged by Correa, who severely upbraided him with neglect of duty, he at last seized a vessel which happened to belong to one of the richest of the Moors. A tumult was immediately raised, the Portuguese factory was suddenly beset by four thousand of that people, and before any assistance could come from the ships, Correa, and the greatest part of his companions, were massacred. Cabral, though greatly enraged, waited sufficient time to hear the excuse of the Zamorim, but waited in vain. Ten large Moorish vessels burnt in the harbour, the city of Calicut bombarded one day, and 600 of its inhabitants slain, revenged the death of Correa. The king of Cochin, when Cabral returned the ship which he had taken, highly pleased with his honour, invited him to traffic in his port. Cabral now sailed thither, and was treated in the most friendly manner. A strong house was appointed for a factory, and a treaty of commerce solemnly concluded. Ambassadors also arrived from the kings of Cananor, Caulan, and other places, intreating the alliance of the Portuguese, whom they invited to their harbours. About eight hundred years before this period, according to tradition  43 , Perimal, the sovereign of India, having embraced the religion of Mohammed, in which he had been instructed by some Arabian merchants, resolved to end his days as a hermit at Mecca. He therefore divided his empire into different sovereignties, but rendered them all tributary to the Zamorim of Calicut. From this port Perimal set sail, and the Arab merchants conceived such a superstitious affection for this harbour, though not so commodious as many others around, that on the arrival of Gama it was the great centre of the Moorish commerce in India. The tributary kings, says the author of Histoire Philosophique ,  &c. desirous to throw off their dependence on the Zamorim, invited the Portuguese to their harbours. He ought to have added, that it was impossible they should have acted so, unless they had conceived a high idea of the Portuguese virtue and valour, which was thus rewarded by the friendship of some powerful princes, who ever after remained true to the Portuguese. When Cabral was about to sail from Cochin, he received information from the king, that the Zamorim, with a large fleet, containing 15,000 soldiers, intended to attack him. Cabral prepared for battle, and the Indian fleet fled. He afterwards touched at Cananor, where he entered into a friendly alliance with the king, who suspecting from the small quantity of spicery which he bought that the Admiral was in want of money, intreated him to give a mark of his friendship by accepting of what he pleased. But Cabral shewed a considerable quantity of gold to the king's messengers, politely thanked him, and said he was already sufficiently loaded. Having left factors on shore, and received ambassadors on board, he proceeded on his homeward voyage. Near Melinda he took a large ship, but finding she belonged to a merchant of Cananor, he set her at liberty, and told the commander, "that the Portuguese monarch was only at war with the Zamorim and the Moors of Mecca, from whom he had received the greatest injuries and indignities." The king of Melinda, and other Mohammedan princes, who had entered into alliances with Gama and Cabral, were not of the tribe or confederacy of those who had in different parts attempted the ruin of the Portuguese. That people were now distinguished by the name of the Moors of Mecca: and to distress this port became now a principal object of the Portuguese. Emmanuel, now fully informed by Cabral of the states and traffic of the Indian seas, perceiving that the reinforcement of three vessels, which he had sent under John de Nova  44 , could little avail, fitted out twenty ships, the command of which warlike fleet was given to the celebrated Vasco de Gama. At the same time the Pope issued a Bull, in which he styled Emmanuel, Lord of the Navigation, Conquests and Trade, of Æthiopia, Arabia, Persia, and India. Gama, having doubled the Cape of Good Hope, touched at Sofala, and made a treaty with the Mohammedan sovereign of that rich country. Mozambic was now governed by a new monarch, who entreated an alliance with the Portuguese, which was granted; and the isle where Gama had the battle with the Moors  45 , became, for long after, a most convenient watering-place for the Portuguese navies. In revenge of the plots against himself, and the injuries received by Cabral, he battered the city of Quiloa with his cannon, and made the king submit to pay tribute to Emmanuel. As he proceeded for Calicut, he met a large ship of Mecca, which, with many people of distinction who were going on a pilgrimage to the tomb of their prophet, had lately left that harbour. This vessel, after an obstinate struggle, in which 300 Moors were  46 killed, he took and burnt. And from some vessels of Calicut, as he approached that port, he took about thirty prisoners. As soon as he anchored near the city, the Zamorim sent a message to offer terms of friendship, to excuse the massacre of the Portuguese under Correa, as the sole action of an enraged populace, with which government had no concern; and added, that the fate of the ship of Mecca he hoped would suffice for revenge. Gama, previous to any new treaty, demanded a restitution of the goods of which the Portuguese factory had been plundered, and threatened to put his prisoners to death and batter the city in case of refusal. After waiting some time in vain for an answer, Gama ordered his thirty prisoners to be hanged and their bodies to be sent ashore, together with a letter, declaring war against the Zamorim, in the name of the king of Portugal. And next day, having for several hours played his cannon upon the city, he steered his course for the more friendly port of Cochin. Here the factors who had been left by Cabral gave Gama the highest character of the faith of the king, and his earnest desire to cultivate the friendship of the Portuguese; and the former alliance was mutually confirmed by the king and the admiral. The Zamorim, who with rage and regret beheld the commerce of Europe carried to other harbours, sent a Bramin to Gama, while he was lading at Cochin, intreating an oblivion of past injuries, and a renewal of the league of amity. The Admiral, still desirous to cultivate friendship, gave the command of the fleet to his cousin Stephen de Gama, and with two ships only sailed for Calicut; yet, lest treachery should be intended, he ordered Vincent Sodre with five ships to follow him. On his arrival at the city, he found that dissimulation was still the character of the Zamorim. Four and thirty vessels, full of armed men, attacked Gama's ship with great fury, for the other vessel he had sent to hasten the squadron of Sodre. In this situation nothing but a brisk wind could possibly save Gama, and a brisk gale in this extremity rose and carried him beyond the reach of the fleet of Calicut. But having met the reinforcement of Sodre, the Admiral immediately returned, and totally destroyed the fleet of the enemy. Disappointed in war, the Zamorim now by intreaties and threats endeavoured to bring the king of Cochin into his interest. But that prince, with the greatest honour, refused to betray the Portuguese; and Gama having promised to leave a squadron to protect his harbour, sailed with thirteen loaded ships for the port of Cananor. On his way thither, as he past within a few miles of Calicut, he was again vigorously attacked by twenty-nine vessels, fitted out by the Zamorim, on purpose to intercept him. Gama ordered three ships, which had the least loading, to begin the engagement, and victory soon declared in his favour. He then proceeded to Cananor, where he entered into a treaty with the sovereign, who bound himself never to make war on the king of Cochin, or to assist the Zamorim. And Gama, having left six ships under the command of Sodre, for the protection of Cochin and Cananor, sailed for Portugal, where, after a prosperous voyage, he arrived with twelve ships, loaded with the riches of the East. As soon as Gama's departure was known, the Zamorim made great preparations to attack Cochin. It was the purpose of Emmanuel, that Sodre should be left with a squadron to cruise about the mouth of the Red Sea, and annoy the Moors of Mecca; but Gama, whose power was discretionary, ordered him not to leave Cochin, unless every thing bore the appearance of peace with the Zamorim. Sodre, however, though hostility was every day expected, prepared to depart. Diego Correa, the Portuguese agent left at Cochin, in the strongest manner urged him to do his duty and continue at that port, but in vain. While the king of Cochin resolutely refused, though advised by many of his council, to deliver up the Portuguese residents to the Zamorim, Sodre, contrary to the orders of Gama, sailed for the Red Sea, in hope of the rich prizes of Mecca; and thus basely deserted his countrymen, and a prince, whose faith to the Portuguese had involved him in a war which threatened destruction to his kingdom. The city of Cochin is situated on an island, divided from the continent by an arm of the sea, one part of which, at low water, is fordable. At this pass the Zamorim began the war, and met some defeats. At last, by the force of numbers and the power of bribery, he took the city, and the king of Cochin fled to the island of Viopia. Yet, though stript of his dominions, he retained his faith to the Portuguese. He took them with him to this place, where a few men could defend themselves; and though the Zamorim offered to restore him to his throne if he would deliver them up, he replied, "that his enemy might strip him of his dominions and his life, but it was not in his power to deprive him of his fidelity." While Trimumpara, king of Cochin, was thus shut up on a little rock, Sodre suffered a punishment worthy of his perfidy. His ship was beaten to pieces by a tempest, and he and his brother lost their lives. The other commanders considered this as the judgment of heaven, and hastened back to the relief of Cochin: by stress of weather, however, they were obliged to put into one of the Anchidivian islands. Here they were joined by Francis Albuquerk, who, on hearing the fate of Cochin, though in the rigour of winter, set sail for its relief. When the fleet appeared in sight of Viopia, Trimumpara exclaiming Portugal, Portugal, ran in an extacy to the Portuguese; and they in return, with shouts of triumph, announced the restoration of his crown. The garrison left in Cochin by the Zamorim immediately fled. Trimumpara was restored to his throne without a battle, and Albuquerk gave an instance of his masterly policy. Together with the thanks of Emmanuel, he made the king of Cochin a present of 10,000 ducats. An act which wonderfully excited the admiration of the princes of India, and was a severe wound to the Zamorim. Francis and Alonzo Albuquerk and Duarte Pacheco were now at Cochin. The princes, tributary to Trimumpara, who had deserted to the Zamorim, were severely punished by the troops of Cochin, headed by the Portuguese, and their depredations were carried into the Zamorim's own dominions. A treaty of peace was at last concluded, on terms greatly advantageous to the Portuguese commerce. But that honour which had been of the greatest benefit to their affairs, was now stained. A ship of Calicut was unjustly seized by the Portuguese agent at Cochin; nor would Francis Albuquerk make restitution, though required by the Zamorim. Soon after this, Francis sailed for Europe, but gave another instance of his infamy ere he left India. The Zamorim had again declared war against the king of Cochin, and Francis Albuquerk left only one ship, three barges, and about one hundred and fifty men, for the defence of Trimumpara; but this small body was commanded by Pacheco. Francis Albuquerk, and Nicholas Coello, celebrated in the Lusiad, sailed for Europe, but were heard of no more. Anthony Saldanna and Roderic Ravasco were at this time sent from Lisbon to cruise about the mouth of the Red Sea. The king of Melinda was engaged in a dangerous war with the king of Mombassa, and Saldanna procured him an honourable peace. But Ravasco acted as a lawless pirate on the coast of Zanzibar. Though the innocent inhabitants were in a treaty of peace with Gama, he took many of their ships, for which he extorted large ransoms, and compelled the prince of Zanzibar to pay an annual tribute and own himself the vassal of Emmanuel. The Pope's Bull, which gave all the East to the king of Portugal, began now to operate. The Portuguese esteemed it as a sacred charter, the natives of the East felt the consequence of it, and conceived a secret jealousy and dislike of their new masters. The exalted policy and honour of many of the Portuguese governors delayed the evil operation of this jealousy, but the remedy was only temporary. The Portuguese believed they had a right to demand the vassallage of the princes of the East, and to prohibit them the navigation of their own seas. When the usurpation of dominion proceeds from a fixed principle, the wisdom of the ablest Governor can only skin over the mortal wound; for the grossest barbarians are most acutely sensible of injustice, and carefully remember the breaches of honour. The Zamorim had now collected a formidable power for the destruction of Cochin. But before we mention the wonderful victories of Pacheco, it will be necessary to give some account of the land and maritime forces of the East. And here it is to be lamented, that the Portuguese authors have given us but very imperfect accounts of the military arts of India. Yet it is to be gathered from them, that though fire arms were not unknown, they were very little used before the arrival of the Portuguese. Two natives of Milan, who were brought to India by Gama on his second voyage, deserted to the Zamorim, and were of great service to him in making of powder and casting of cannon. The Persians despised the use of fire arms, as unmanly, and the use of artillery on board of a fleet, is several times mentioned, as peculiar to the Moors of Mecca. The vessels of the Zamorim were large barges rowed with oars, and crouded with men, who fought with darts and other missile weapons. We are told by Osorius, that the pilot of Melinda, who conducted Gama to Calicut, despised the Astrolabe, as if used to superior instruments. We doubt, however, of his superior knowledge, for we know that he coasted northward to a particular limit, and then stood directly for the rising sun. We are also told by the Jesuits of the perfection of the Chinese navigation, and that they have had the use of the compass for 3000 years; but this is also doubtful. For there is not a name in any eastern language for that instrument; nor do they know how to make one, or to arm the loadstone. They purchase them of Europeans, and the Italian word Bussola is the name of the compass among the natives of the East. While the Zamorim was preparing his formidable armament against Cochin, the security which appeared on the mein of Pacheco, prompted Trimumpara to suspect some fraud: and he intreated that captain to confess what he intended. Pacheco felt all the resentment of honour, and assured him of victory. He called a meeting of the principal inhabitants, and uttered the severest threats against any person who should dare to desert to the Zamorim, or to leave the island. Soon after, two fishermen were brought before him, who had been following their employment beyond the limits he had prescribed. Pacheco ordered them to be hanged in prison. The king pleaded for their lives, but Pacheco in public was inexorable. In the night, however, he sent the two fishermen to the king's palace, where he desired they might be concealed with the greatest secrecy; and the severity of their fate was publickly believed. Every precaution, by which the passage to the island of Cochin might be secured, was taken by Pacheco. The Portuguese took the sacrament, and devoted themselves to death. The king of Cochin's troops amounted only to 5000; the fleet and army of the Zamorim consisted of 57,000 men. Yet this great army, though provided with brass cannon, and otherwise assisted by the two Milanese engineers, was defeated by Pacheco. Seven times the Zamorim raised new armies, some of them more numerous than the first, but all of them were defeated at the fords of Cochin, by the stratagems and intrepidity of Pacheco. Though the Zamorim in the latter battles exposed his own person to the greatest danger, and was sometimes sprinkled with the blood of his attendants; though he had recourse to poison and every art of fraud, all his attempts, open and private, were baffled. At last, in despair of revenge, he resigned his crown, and shut himself up for the remainder of his days in one of his idol temples. Soon after the kingdom of Cochin was thus restored to prosperity, Pacheco was recalled to Europe. The king of Portugal paid the highest compliments to his valour; and as he had acquired no fortune in India, in reward of his services he gave him a lucrative government in Africa. But merit always has enemies. Pacheco was accused, and by the king's order brought to Lisbon in irons; and those hands which preserved the interest of Portugal in India, were in Portugal chained in a dungeon a considerable time, ere a legal trial determined the justice of this severity. He was at last tried, and honourably acquitted; but his merit was thought of no more, and he died in an alms-house. Merit thus repaid, is a severe wound to an empire. The generous ardour of military spirit cannot receive a colder check, than such examples are sure to give it. Before the departure of Pacheco, a fleet of thirteen ships, commanded by Lopez Soarez, arrived in India. The new Zamorim beheld with regret the ruined condition of his kingdom, his tributary princes not only now independent, but possessed of the commerce which formerly enriched Calicut, the fatal consequence of his uncle and predecessor's obstinacy. Taught by these examples, he desired a peace with the Portuguese; but Soarez would hear nothing till the two Milanese deserters were delivered up. This perfidy to men who had been promised protection, the Zamorim generously refused. And Soarez, regardless of the fate of some Portuguese who had been left at Calicut by Cabral, battered the city two days, in place of granting an honourable and commercial peace. Nor was this his only impolitical error. By shewing such eagerness to secure the Milanese engineers, he told the Zamorim the value of these European artists. And that prince soon after applied to the Soldan of Egypt, who sent him four Venetians, able engineers, and masters of the art of the foundery of cannon. In the stately spirit of conquest Soarez traversed the Indian seas, destroyed many Calicutian and Moorish vessels, and made various princes pay tribute and confess themselves the vassals of Emmanuel. But the Soldan of Egypt began now to threaten hostilities, and a stronger force of the Portuguese was necessary. Francisco d'Almeyda, an officer of distinguished merit, was therefore appointed Viceroy of India, and was sent with two and twenty ships to assert his jurisdiction. And according to the uncommercial ideas of Gothic conquest with which he set out, he proceeded. On his arrival at Quiloa, a meeting between him and the king was appointed. Almeyda attended, but the king did not, for a black cat, as he set out, happened to cross his way, and intimidated by this evil omen, he declined the interview. On this, Almeyda levelled his city with the ground, and appointed another king, tributary to Emmanuel. Some late treacheries of Mombassa were also revenged by the destruction of that city and the vassalage of its monarch. When the Viceroy arrived in India, he defeated the king of Onor, built forts and left garrisons in various places. Trimumpara, king of Cochin, had now retired to spend the evening of his life in a Brahmin temple, and his nephew, who with great pomp was crowned by Almeyda, acknowledged himself the tributary of the king of Portugal. The Soldan of Egypt was at this time one of the greatest princes of the world. The lucrative commerce of the East had long flowed to the West through his dominions. His fleets and his armies were thus rendered numerous and powerful, and bound by their political religion, in a war with the Christians, every Mohammedan prince was his ally. A heavy revenge of the Crusades was in meditation, and Europe miserably divided in itself, invited its own ruin; when, says an author  47 , accurate in historical facts, the liberties of mankind were saved by the voyage of Vasco de Gama: The sinews of the Egyptian and Turkish strength were cut asunder by the destruction of their commerce with the eastern world. Enraged with the interruption which his trade had already received, the Soldan resolved to prevent its utter ruin. He threatened the extirpation of all the Christians  48 in his dominions, if the court of Rome would not order the king of Portugal to withdraw his fleets for ever from the eastern seas. One Maurus, a monk, was his ambassador to Rome and Lisbon, but in place of compliance, he returned with the severer threats of Emmanuel. War was now determined, and a most formidable fleet, sixty vessels of which were larger than the Portuguese, manned with Turks experienced in war, were sent to the assistance of the Zamorim. But by the superior naval skill and romantic bravery of Almeyda and his son Lorenzo, this mighty armament was defeated. At this time Tristan de Cugna and the celebrated Alphonso Albuquerk arrived in the East, and carried war and victory from Sofala to India. Allured by the honour and truly commercial treaties of Gama and Cabral, several princes of India invited these strangers to their harbours. But the alteration of the behaviour and claims of the Portuguese, had altered the sentiments of the natives. Almost every port now opposed the entrance of the Portuguese, and the cargo of almost every ship they loaded was purchased with blood. At the sack of the city of Lamo, some of the soldiers under Cugna cut off the hands and ears of the women to get their bracelets and ear- rings with more expedition. But though these villains, by overloading their boat with their plunder, were all drowned, this stain on the Portuguese character made war against the Portuguese name and interest. When Albuquerk arrived before Ormuz, he summoned the king to become the vassal of Emmanuel, and to be happy under the protection of so great a prince. The king of Ormuz, who expected such a visit, had provided an army of 33,000 men, 6000 of which were expert archers, auxiliaries of Persia. Yet these were defeated by 460 disciplined men, well played cannon, and the dauntless valour of Albuquerk. And the king of Ormuz submitted to vassalage. Lords of the seas also, the Portuguese permitted no ship to sail without a Portuguese passport. Nor was this regarded, when avarice prompted that the passport was forged. A rich ship of Cananor was on this pretence taken and plundered, and the unhappy crew, to conceal the villany, were sewed up in the sail cloths and drowned. Vaz, it is true, the commander of this horrid deed, was broken. But the bodies of the Moors were thrown on shore, and the king of Cananor, the valuable ally of Portugal, in revenge of this treachery, joined the Zamorim, and declared war against the Portuguese. Another powerful armament, commanded by Mir Hocem, a chief of great valour, was sent by the Soldan. Persia also assisted. And even the mountains of Dalmatia  49 , by the connivance of Venice, were robbed of their forests, to build navies in Arabia against the Portuguese. Almeyda sent his brave son Lorenzo to give battle to Mir Hocem, but Lorenzo fell the victim of his romantic bravery. While the father prepared to revenge the death of his son, his recall, and the appointment of Albuquerk to succeed him, arrived from Europe; but Almeyda refused to resign till he had revenged his son's defeat. On this, a dispute between the two governors arose, of fatal consequence to the Portuguese interest in Asia. Albuquerk was imprisoned, and future governors often urged this example on both sides of the question, both to protract the continuance, and press the instant surrender of office. Almeyda, having defeated the Zamorim and his Egyptian allies, sailed for Europe  50 , crowned with military laurels. But though thus plumed in the vulgar eye, his establishments were contrary to the spirit of commerce. He fought, indeed, and conquered; but he left more enemies of the Portuguese in the East than he found there. The honours he attained were like his, who having extinguished a few fires in a city, marches out in triumph, but leaves glowing embers in every house, ready to burst forth in a general flame. It was left for the great Albuquerk to establish the Portuguese empire in Asia on a surer basis, on acts of mutual benefit to the foreign colonists and native princes. Albuquerk, whose power was somewhat limitted by that of Coutinho, now turned his thoughts to the solid establishment of the Portuguese empire. To extinguish the power of Calicut, and to erect a fortified capital for the seat of government, were his designs; and in these he was greatly assisted, both by the arms and the counsel of Timoja the pirate, who, greatly injured by the Indian princes, was glad to enter into alliance with the Portuguese. With thirty vessels and 2400 men, Albuquerk and Fernando Coutinho sailed from Cochin to besiege Calicut. It was agreed, that the troops under Coutinho, should have the honour to land first. Those under Albuquerk, however, galled by the enemy, leapt first ashore. Coutinho, on this, roughly upbraided him: To conquer the feeble Indians, he said, was no such honour as some boasted. And I will tell the king of Portugal, he added, that I entered the palace of the Zamorim with only my cane in my hand. Albuquerk remonstrated the danger of rashness in vain. Coutinho ordered Jasper de Gama, the Polonian Jew, to conduct him to the palace; to which, with 800 men, he marched in confused speed. Albuquerk, whose magnanimity could revenge no insult when his country's interest was at stake in the hour of battle, followed in good order with 600 men, and left others properly stationed, to secure a retreat, for he foresaw destruction. Coutinho, after several attacks, at last, with the loss of many men, entered the palace, and gave his soldiers liberty to plunder. All was now disorder among them. And Albuquerk, who perceived it, entreated Coutinho, by message, to beware of a fiercer attack. He was answered, he might take care of the troops under his own command. After two hours spent in plundering the palace, Coutinho set fire to it and marched out. But ere he could join Albuquerk, both parties were surrounded by enraged multitudes. Coutinho and his bravest officers fell; Albuquerk was wounded by arrows in the neck and left arm. At last, struck on the breast by a large stone, he dropped down, to appearance dead. On his shield he was carried off with great difficulty. All was confusion in the retreat, till the body of reserve, placed by Albuquerk, came up, and repulsed the enemy. Albuquerk was carried on board without hope of recovery. His health, however, was restored at Cochin, and the Zamorim allowed a fort to be built near Calicut, and submitted to the terms of peace proposed by the Portuguese governor. The island of Goa, on the coast of Decan, a most commodious situation for the seat of empire, and whose prince had been treacherous to Gama, after various desperate engagements, was at last yielded to Albuquerk. According to his design, he fortified it in the best manner, and rendered it of the utmost consequence to the preservation of the Portuguese power. He now turned his thoughts to Malaca, the great mart of the eastern half of the oriental world. Under the government of Almeyda, Sequeira had sailed thither, and while about settling a treaty with the natives, narrowly escaped a treacherous massacre, in which several of his men were slain. Albuquerk offered peace and commerce, but demanded atonement for this injury. His terms were rejected, and this important place, won by most astonishing victories, was now added to the Portuguese dominion. Here, as at Goa, the governor coined money; regulated the courts of justice, and by his generous behaviour, won the affection and esteem of the people whom he had conquered. He received from, and sent ambassadors to the king of Siam and other princes; to whom he offered the trade of Malaca on more advantageous conditions than it had hitherto been. And an immense commerce from China and all the adjacent regions soon filled that harbour. For here, as at Ormuz and Goa, the reduction which he made in the customs, gave an increase of trade which almost doubled the revenue of the king of Portugal. At every place where he made a settlement, Albuquerk promoted the marriage of his soldiers with the natives, and thus secured the means of mutual defence: a piece of the best policy, though seldom adopted by other nations  51 . When the governor returned to Goa, he was received, says Faria, as a father by his family. The island was at this time besieged by 20,000 of Hydal Can, the lord of Decan's troops, yet victory declared for Albuquerk. But to display the terror of the Portuguese arms was only the second motive of this great man. To convince the Indian princes of the value of his friendship was his first care, and treaties of commerce were with mutual satisfaction concluded with the king of Bisnagar, the king of Narsinga, and other powerful princes. The city of Aden, near the mouth of the Red Sea, was of great importance to the fleets of the Soldan. Albuquerk twice attacked this place, but could not carry it for want of military stores. By the vessels, however, which he kept on these coasts, he gave a severe wound to the Egyptian and Moorish commerce; and by the establishments which he made in India, entirely ruined it. Mahomet, the expelled tyrant of Malaca, assisted by 20,000 Javans, attempted to recover his throne; but the wish of the people was fulfilled, and Albuquerk was again victorious. The Persians, to whom Ormuz had been tributary, endeavoured to bring it again under their yoke  52 ; but Albuquerk hastened from Malaca and totally defeated them, to the great joy of the inhabitants. Here he fell sick, and being advised by his physicians to go to India for the recovery of his health, the king of Ormuz, who called him his father, parted from him with tears. On his way to India he received intelligence, that a fleet, arrived from Portugal, had brought his recall, that Lopez Soarez was appointed to succeed him, and that Iago Mendez was come to be governor of Cochin. When he heard this, he exclaimed, "Are these whom I sent prisoners to Portugal for heinous crimes, are these returned to be governors! Old man, Oh, for thy grave! Thou hast incurred the king's displeasure for the sake of the subjects, and the subjects for the sake of the king! Old man, fly to thy grave, and retain that honour thou has ever preserved!" A profound melancholy now seized him; but finding the certain approaches of death, he recovered his chearfulness, and with great fervor gave thanks to God, that a new governor was ready to succeed him. On the bar of Goa, in the sixty-third year of his age, he breathed his last  53 , after a regency of little more than five years. Yet, in this short space, he not only opened all the eastern world to the commerce of Portugal, but by the regulations of his humane and exalted policy, by the strict distribution of justice which he established, secured its power on a basis, which nothing but the discontinuance of his measures could subvert. Under Albuquerk the proud boast of the historian Faria was justified. The trophies of our victories , says he, are not bruised helmets and warlike engines hung on the trees of the mountains; but cities, islands, and kingdoms, first humbled under our feet, and then joyfully worshiping our government . The princes of India, who viewed Albuquerk as their father, clothed themselves in mourning on his death, for they had experienced the happiness and protection which his friendship gave them. And the sincerity of their grief shewed Emmanuel what a subject he had lost. The affairs of the Portuguese in India were now in the happiest condition; but there was a disease at the court of Lisbon, which exerted its fatal malignity, that disease of all governments, particularly the despotic, the false accusation of the absent, by those who are present at the fountain of power. Accustomed to the affable manners of Albuquerk, the reserved haughty dignity assumed by Soarez, gave the Indian allies of Portugal the first proof that the mourning which they wore for his predecessor was not in vain. Now, say the Portuguese authors, commenced the period when the soldier no more followed the dictates of honour, when those who had been captains turned traders, and procured the loading of their ships in the military way, as if upon the forage in an enemy's country. After having performed the parade of a new governor in visiting the forts, and in breaking and raising officers, Soarez prepared, according to his orders, to reduce the coasts of the Red Sea to the obedience of Portugal. Another great Egyptian fleet, commanded by a Turk, named Raez Solyman, had sailed from Suez, and Soarez, with twenty-seven ships, set sail in search of it. When he came before Aden, he found that strong city defenceless. Solyman, by order of the Soldan, with whom the governor had quarrelled, had levelled a part of the wall. The governor, thus at his mercy, artfully offered the keys to Soarez, and entreated his friendship. Secure of the Moor's honesty, Soarez delayed to take possession, till he had given battle to the Soldan's fleet. This he found in the port of Gidda or Jodda, defended by the cannon of the walls. He therefore did not attempt it; and after burning a few defenceless towns, he returned to Aden. But the breaches were now repaired, and his own force, which had suffered greatly by tempestuous weather in the Red Sea, was, he deemed, unable to take that city, which now refused to surrender. While Soarez was employed in this inglorious expedition, Goa was reduced to the greatest danger. A quarrel about a Portuguese deserter had kindled a war, and Hydal Can, with an army of 30,000 men, laid seige to that important fortress. But the arrival of three Portuguese ships raised the seige, at a time when famine had almost brought the garrison to despair. Nor was Malaca happier than Goa. The uncurbed tyranny of the Portuguese had almost driven trade from that harbour, and the dethroned king once more invaded the island with a great army. But Alexis de Menezes, appointed governor of that place, arrived, in the most critical time, with 300 men, and saved Malaca. The trade with China after this greatly increased, and the king of Ceylon, with whom Albuquerk had established a valuable commerce, was compelled by Soarez to pay tribute to the king of Portugal. A surveyor of the king's revenue about this time arrived in India, vested with a power, which interfered with, and lessened that of the governor. Hence complaints and appeals were by every fleet carried to Europe, and by every fleet that returned the removal of officers was brought. Integrity now afforded no protection, and to amass wealth with the utmost expedition, was now the best way to secure its possession. Rapacity prevailed among the Portuguese, and all was discontent among the natives, when in 1518, after a regency of about three years, Soarez was recalled, and in power and title of governor succeeded by Iago Lopez de Sequeyra. Albuquerk was dreadful to his enemies in war, and to his soldiers on the least appearance of disobedience. But at other times, his engaging manners won the hearts of all. And his knowledge of human nature, which formed his political conduct, was of the first rate. Soarez, on the contrary, the man who refused an equitable treaty offered by the Zamorim, and was for such errors of incapacity sent prisoner to Lisbon by Albuquerk, displayed in all his transactions the meanest abilities. All his capacity seemed to reach no farther than to preserve that solemn face of dignity, that haughty reserved importance with which the dull transact the most trifling affairs; a solemnity of which heavy intellects are extremely jealous and careful, which the ignorant revere, and which the intelligent despise. When the court of Lisbon sent a Soarez to supercede an Albuquerk, they gave a prophecy of the fall of their empire. Sequeyra, the discover of Malaca, began his regency with the relief of that important mart; and the king of Bintam, the besieger, after several attempts, was compelled to submit to a treaty dictated by the Portuguese. Forty-eight ships, under the command of the governor, sailed to reduce the strong fort and harbour of Diu or Dio, on the coast of Cambaya, an object of great importance to the Portuguese, but nothing was attempted. Continual Skirmishes, however, dyed every shore with blood, while no method of cultivating the friendship of the hostile natives was thought of. Every thing on the contrary tended to inflame them. John de Borba, shipwrecked on the coast of Achem, was generously relieved by the sovereign. George de Brito arrived soon after, and Borba informed him, that in the sepulchres of the kings were immense treasures of gold; and that the present king, his benefactor, had formerly robbed some Portuguese vessels. Brito, at the head of 200 men, immediately began hostilities, but was defeated and killed, and the kings of Achem became the inveterate enemies of the Portuguese, and often gave them infinite trouble. The Maluco islands were now discovered. The kings of these at strife with each other, were each earnest for the alliance of the Portuguese. But they, led by their usual ideas, soon involved themselves in war and slaughter. Ormuz, where Albuquerk was beloved as a father, was now unable to bear the Portuguese yoke. The tribute was raised, and the king complained that his revenues could not afford to pay it. Sequeyra on this sent Portuguese officers to impose and collect the king's customs. This impolitical step was followed by its natural consequence. The insolence and oppression of the officers produced a revolt. Sequeyra, however, defeated the people of Ormuz, and almost doubled the tribute which before they were unable to pay. It is truly astonishing how men should expect that dominion thus supported should continue long; that they could not see that such victories both sowed and nourished the seeds of future war. Even the Portuguese historians adopted the impolitical uncommercial ideas of their governors. The villainy of the Portuguese merchants lost the profitable trade of Canton, and only a few escaped with great hazard, obliged to fight their way through the Chinese fleet. Next year Alonzo de Melo, ignorant of this, entered that harbour with four ships, which were instantly seized and the crews massacred by the enraged 54 Chinese. Faria y Sousa makes an apology for mentioning this, and calls it a matter of trade, a subject unworthy of grave history. While Sequeyra was engaged in a second attempt upon Dio, Duarte de Menezes arrived in India, and succeded him in office. Unmeaning slaughter on the coasts of Madagascar, the Red Sea, India, and the Maluco islands, comprise the whole history of his regency. About this time died Emmanuel, king of Portugal. If this history seem to arraign his government, it will also prove how difficult it is for the most vigilant king always to receive just intelligence. For Emmanuel was both a great and a good king. Of great vigilance in council, of great magnanimity in the execution of all his enterprizes: Of great capacity in distinguishing the abilities of men, and naturally liberal in the reward of merit. If such a prince as Emmanuel erred, if his administration of Indian affairs in any instance arraign his policy, let it thence be inferred, what exactitude of intelligence is necessary to the happy government of a distant colony. The maladministration of Indian affairs was now the popular complaint at the court of Lisbon. The traffic of India which had raised the Caliphs of Egypt to the height of their formidable power, and which had enriched Venice, was now found scarcely sufficient to support the military method of commanding it, practised by the Portuguese. A General of the first abilities was wanted, and the celebrated Vasco de Gama, old as he now was, honoured with the title of Count de Vidigueyra, was appointed Viceroy by John III. In 1524 Gama arrived the third time in India. Cochin, the faithful ally and chief trading port of the Portuguese, was threatened by a powerful army of the Zamorim, and the Indian seas were infested by numberless fleets of Moors, whom their enemies called pirates. To suppress these Gama sent different squadrons, who were successful in executing their orders. But while he meditated far greater designs, designs of the same exalted and liberal policy which had been begun by himself, and so gloriously prosecuted by Albuquerk, death, at the end of three months, closed the regency of Gama. It was the custom of the kings of Portugal to send commissions sealed up to India, with orders, which should be first opened when a successor to government was wanted. Gama, who brought with him three of these, finding the approach of dissolution, opened the first commission. And as Henry de Menezes, therein named, was at Goa, he appointed Lopez Vaz de Sampayo, a man of great abilities, to take the command till Menezes arrived. When Menezes arrived at Cochin, he prohibited the usual marks of public joy on his elevation, and said, it was more necessary to mourn for the loss of their late Viceroy. Nor did the public conduct of the new governor, the first, says Faria, who honoured the memory of his predecessor, deviate from this generous principle. A Portuguese vessel at this time committed several depredations on states at peace with Portugal. This ship, by order of Menezes, was taken, and the crew were impaled. A noble instance of justice, of more political service than all the victories of a Soarez. The danger of Cochin required war, and Menezes carried it into the territories of the Zamorim, whom he severely humbled. The Portuguese arms cleared the seas of pirates, took the strong city of Dofar, and reduced some valuable islands on the Red Sea. Great preparations were also made for the reduction of Dio, when Menezes, after a regency of thirteen months, died of a mortification in his leg. That he left the military power of the Portuguese much more formidable than he found it, is the least of his praise. Every where, at Ormuz in particular, he curbed the insolence and rapacity of his countrymen, and proved that time was only wanting for him to have restored the situation of India as left by Albuquerk. He convinced the Indian princes that rapacity was not the character of all the Portuguese, for he accepted of no present, though many, as the custom of the country, were offered to him. At his death, which happened in his thirtieth year, thirteen reals and an half, not a crown in the whole, was all the private property found in the possession of this young governor. Other transactions now succeed. The second and third commissions, brought by Gama, were unopened, and left he who was first named should be distant, Menezes, on his death-bed, appointed Francis de Sa to assume the command till the arrival of the proper governor. On opening the second commission, Pedro de Mascarenhas was found named. As this officer was at Malaca, a council was held, wherein it was resolved to set aside Francis de Sa, and open the third commission. Sampayo, who in this was appointed, took an oath to resign on the arrival of Mascarene, and immediately he assumed the power of government. Mascarene about this time performed some actions of great military splendor in defence of Malaca. The king of Bintam, with several auxiliary princes, who with numerous armies threatened destruction to the Portuguese settlement, were defeated by this brave officer. The Spaniards about this time took possession of some of the Maluco islands, where the treachery of the Portuguese had made their name odious. Don George de Menezes and Don Garcia Enriquez, two captains on this station, put one another alternately in irons. They at last came to a civil war, wherein Garcia was worsted; and Menezes was defeated by the Spaniards, who publickly executed some of his officers, as traitors to Charles V. to whom they owed no allegiance. Oppressed by the tyranny of the Moors, the king of Sunda implored the protection of the Portuguese, offered to pay a considerable tribute, and entreated them to built a fort in his dominions. Yet it was not in the power of Sampayo to restore the tranquillity of the Malucos, or to improve the offers of Sunda. He had engaged in a scheme of policy which fettered his operations. One villainy must be defended by another, and the public interest must be secondary in the politics of the most able Usurper of unjust power. Sampayo was resolved to withhold the regency from Mascarene, and therefore to strengthen himself at Cochin was his first care. Where his own interest and that of the public were one, Sampayo behaved as a great commander; but where they were less immediately connected, that of the latter was even necessarily neglected, and fell into ruin. It was his interest to crush the Zamorim, and he gained considerable victories over Cutial, admiral of the most formidable fleet which had hitherto been fitted out from the ports of Calicut. Sampayo then sailed to Goa, where Francis de Sa refused to acknowledge him as governor. This dispute was submited to the council of the city, and the man in power was confirmed. Sa was then sent to build a fort in Sunda, but the politics of Sampayo could not spare a force sufficient to overawe the Moors, and Francis de Sa could not effect his design. The artful Sampayo now wrote to the king of Portugal, that a most formidable hostile alliance was in meditation. The northern princes were ready to assist the king of Cambaya, and Solyman, the Turkish admiral, had promised the Soldan to drive the Portuguese from India, if he would give him a competent armament. It was the interest of Sampayo to make every preparation of defence, and every excuse for preparation. But he still kept near Cochin. The brave Hector de Sylveyra was sent to Dio and other places, and the reputation of the actions he performed strengthened the authority of the Usurper. A fleet of five ships now arrived from Portugal, and brought two new commissions. These were opened by Mexia, inspector of the revenue, and Lopez Vaz de Sampayo, contrary to the former commissions, was here named prior to Pedro de Mascarene. What an infatuation of government was this! Had all been happy in India, this must have banished harmony from the councils of the Portuguese, and for a time unhinged the operations of just authority. Sampayo, when he took the oath to resign to Mascarene, dispatched a message to Malaca with the tidings. Mascarene immediately assumed his power there, and Sampayo, who now expected his arrival, held a council at Cochin. It is almost needless to name the result. He was present, and in power; and it was resolved that Mascarene should not be acknowledged as governor. Sampayo then retired to Goa, and left Mexia at Cochin to give Mascarene the reception concerted between them. Immediately as Mascarene landed, Mexia's spear run him through the arm, several of his company were wounded by the armed attendants of Mexia, and a retreat to the fleet saved the lives of Mascarene and his friends. When the tidings of this reached Goa, Henry Figuera supposed the friend of the ejected governor was dispossessed of the command of Coulam, and Mexia was by Sampayo appointed to succeed. Anthony de Sylveyra was sent to take Mascarene at sea, to put him in irons, and to deliver him prisoner to Simon de Menezes, commander of Conanor; all which was performed. This haughty tyranny, however, produced loud complaints. The murmur was general at Goa. Souza, commander of Chaul, remonstrated, and the brave Hector de Sylveyra boldly upbraided Sampayo for his unworthy treatment of Mascarene, to whom a trial had been refused. Sampayo, fierce, resolute to persist; Hector retired, and summoned the council of Goa. A letter signed by three hundred, who promised to support him as governor, was sent to Mascarene. It was also agreed to seize Sampayo, but he was no stranger to this design, and imprisonment was the fortune of the brave Hector. Menezes, governor of Cananor, as soon as he received information from Goa of the cause why Mascarene was in chains, set him free, and, together with Souza, commandant of Chaul, and Anthony de Azevedo, admiral of the Indian seas, acknowledged him governor. The Portuguese were now on the eve of a war among themselves, when Azevedo and other leaders proposed to accommodate disputes by arbitration. Sampayo with great cunning managed this affair. He delayed his consent, though on the brink of ruin, till he knew who were named as judges, and till he had procured a pardon for Alonzo Mexia, his friend, who had attempted the life of Mascarene. Yet, though the defenders of this brave officer had influence to remove one of the appointed judges, and to add five others of their own nomination, the arts of Sampayo prevailed. The chief inhabitants of Cochin attended, and conscious of their former vote in council against Mascarene, declared, that if his title was preferred, they would revolt to the Moors. He who does a man an injury, generally becomes the rancorous enemy of the injured man; and even the friends of him whose power is on the decline, cautiously withdraw from his interest. The council of Goa, who had promised to support, now deserted Mascarene, forward to make their peace where they feared to oppose. Sampayo was declared lawful governor, and Mascarene embarked for Lisbon, where he was honourably received by the king, and in reward of his merit, appointed governor of Azamor in Africa; on his return from whence he perished at sea. Sampayo, now undisturbed by a rival, but conscious of the accusations which Mascarene would lay against him, exerted all his abilities to recommend himself to his sovereign. But Almeyda, not Albuquerk, was the pattern he imitated. The principal leaders of the Turkish fleet had been assassinated by the friends of each other, and their war ships were scattered in different places. Sampayo sent Azevedo to destroy all he could find, and Alonzo de Melo was dispatched with a proper force to erect a fort on the island of Sunda. What heavy accusation of his former conduct, devoted to his private interest, was this late execution of these important designs! Other captains were sent upon various expeditions. Hector de Sylveyra, one of the most gallant officers ever sent from Portugal to India, greatly distinguished himself; John Deza destroyed the remains of the Zamorim's fleets, commanded by Cutiale, a Chinese admiral; and Sampayo himself spread slaughter and devastation over the seas and shores of India. Every where, says Faria, there was fire and sword, ruin and destruction. In the midst of this bloody career, Nunio de Cunha arrived with a commission to succeed Sampayo. Sampayo pleaded to finish what he had begun, to clear the seas of pirates; and Nunio, according to the honour of that age, granted his request, that it might not be said he had reaped the laurels already grasped by another. Some time after this, Nunio, in his way to Cochin, put into the harbour of Cananor. Sampayo, who happened to be there, sent his brother in law, John Deza, to Nunio, inviting him to come ashore and receive the resignation of the governor. But Nunio perhaps feared a snare, and he insisted that Sampayo should come on board. He came, and having resigned with the usual solemnities, was ordered by Nunio to attend him to Cochin, where, by order of the new governor, his effects were seized and his person imprisoned. And soon after, amid the insults of the croud, he was put aboard a ship and sent prisoner to Lisbon, where his life and his property were left to the determination of the sovereign  55 . The acts and character of this extraordinary man demand the attention of every country possessed of colonies. His abilities were certainly of the first rate, but having made one step of villany, the necessity of self-defence rendered his talents of little benefit, rather of great prejudice to his country. The Portuguese writers, indeed, talk in high terms of his eminent services and military glory. But there is a surer test than their opinion. The Indian princes sincerely mourned over the ashes of Albuquerk, whom they called their father; but there was a general joy on the departure of their tyrant Sampayo; a certain proof that his conduct was of infinite prejudice to the interest of Portugal. However high and dreadful they may seem, men in his situation never dare to punish without respect of the offender's connections. The tyranny of George de Menezes, governor of Maluco, under Sampayo, disgraces human nature. He openly robbed the houses of the Moorish merchants, cut off the hands of some, and looked on, while a magistrate, who had dared to complain, was, by his order, devoured by dogs  56 . If the embarrassment of Sampayo was the only protection of this miscreant, others, however, had his sanction. Camoens, that enthusiast of his nation's honour, in an apostrophe to Mascarene, thus characterises the regency of the Usurper, "Avarice and ambition now in India set their face openly against God and justice; a grief to thee, but not thy shame!" And Camoens is exceeding accurate in the facts of history, and with the rest of his countrymen, admires the military renown of Sampayo. But if Sampayo humbled the Moors, it should also be remembered that, according to Faria, these people had improved the divisions made by his politics, greatly to the hurt of the Portuguese settlements. And when he did conquer, pushed on by the rage to do something eminent, every victory was truly Gothic, and was in its consequence uncommercial. It is not earthquakes and whirlwinds that revive a blighted harvest; the gentle rains and mild dews of heaven alone diffuse fertility, and heal the chasms of the withered soil. Malaca, while governed by the injured Mascarene, was the only division of Portuguese Asia where commerce flourished. After his departure, all was wretchedness; Portuguese against Portuguese, piracy and rapine here and at the Malucos. In what condition the rest were left by Sampayo will soon appear. The king of Cochin, the valuable ally and auxiliary of the Portuguese, was confined by the small-pox when Nunio arrived. Nunio offered to wait upon him, but the king declined the interview on account of the infection, though a sight of the new governor, he added, he was sure would cure his fever. Nunio waited upon him, and heard a long list of the injuries and rapine committed by Sampayo and Mexia. These, in true policy, Nunio redressed; and the king, who complained that he had been kept as a slave in his own palace, was now made happy. Nunio visited the other princes in alliance with Portugal, and at every court and harbour found oppression and injustice. At Ormuz in particular, tyranny and extortion had defied resistance. Nunio soothed and redressed the wrongs of the various princes. Proclamation was made every where, inviting the injured Moors and Indians to appear before him and receive redress. Many appeared, and to the astonishment of all India, justice was conspicuously distributed. Raez Xarafo, the creature of Sampayo, prime minister, or rather tyrant of the king of Ormuz, stood accused of the most horrid crimes of office. Rapine was defended by murder; and the spirit of industry, crushed to the ground, sighed for support amid the desolate streets. Innocence and industry were now protected by Nunio, and Xarafo, though a native of India, was sent in irons to Lisbon to take his trial. Nor was Nunio forgetful of the enemies, while thus employed in restoring to prosperity the allies of Portugal 57 . Hector de Sylveyra, with a large fleet, made a line across the gulph at the mouth of the Red Sea, and let not a Moorish or Egyptian vessel escape. Anthony Galvam, a very enthusiast in honesty, was sent by Nunio to succeed Ataide, governor of the Malucos, a villain who trod in the steps of Menezes. All was in confusion when Galvam arrived; but he had infinitely more difficulty, says Faria, to suppress the villainy of the Portuguese, than to quell the hostile natives. By his wisdom, however, resolution, and most scrupulous integrity, the Malucos once more became a flourishing settlement, and the neighbouring kings, some of whom he had vanquished, entreated his continuance when he received his recal. Anthony de Sylveyra spread the terror of his arms along the hostile coast of Cambaya, and from thence to Bengal. Stephen de Gama, son of the great Vasco, was sent to Malaca, which he effectually secured, by the repeated defeats of the neighbouring princes in hostility. And the governor himself attempted Dio; but while employed in the reduction of the strongly fortified island of Beth, where the brave Hector de Sylveyra fell, a great reinforcement, commanded by Mustapha, a Turk, entered Dio, and enabled that city to hold out against all the vigorous attacks of Nunio. While the governor was thus employed in restoring the strength of the Portuguese settlements, scenes, new to the Portuguese, opened, and demanded the exertion of all his wisdom and abilities. One of those brutal wars, during which the eastern princes desolate kingdoms and shed the blood of millions, now broke forth. Badur, king of Guzarat or Cambaya, one of those horrid characters common in oriental history, ascended the throne, through the blood of his father and elder brothers. Innumerable other murders, acts of perfidy and unjust invasions of his neighbours, increased his territories, when the Mogul, or king of Delhi, sent a demand of homage and tribute. Badur flayed the ambassadors alive, and boasted that thus he would always pay his tribute and homage. Armies of about 200,000 men were raised on each side, and alternately destroyed, sometimes by the sword, sometimes by famine. New armies were repeatedly mustered, inferior kingdoms were desolated as they marched along, but Badur was at last reduced to the lowest extremity. In his distress he implored the assistance of the Portuguese, and not only yielded Dio, a city among almost inaccessible rocks, but gave permission to Nunio to fortify it as he pleased  58 . The Mogul also made large offers, but those of Badur were accepted, and the king of Delhi's army soon after withdrew from Cambaya. Abraham, king of Decan, entitled Hydal Can, had about this time laid seige to Golconda with an army of near half a million, but Cotamaluco, the prince whom he besieged, found means to defeat him by famine. Abraham had dethroned his own brother, Mulacham, and thrust out his eyes. Azadacam, an expert Mohammedan, at the head of a large army, endeavoured to revenge Mulacham, when the people of Decan, desolated by these brutal wars, entreated Nunio to take the dominion of their country, and deliver them from utter ruin. As the Decan forms the continent opposite to Goa, the offer was accepted, and ratified by the consent of Azadacam. Azadacam now fled to the king of Bisnagar, the old enemy of the Decan, and Abraham, now assisted by Catamaluco, the prince whom he besieged in Golconda, invaded Bisnagar with an army of 400,000 men and 700 elephants. But while human blood flowed in rivulets, Azadacam made his peace with Abraham, and Cotamaluco joined the king of Bisnagar. King Badur, who owed his crown to the Portuguese, now meditating their destruction, entered into a league with the Hydal Can. And Azadacam, who had ratified the treaty, by which the miserable inhabitants of Decan had put themselves under the Portuguese dominion, now advised his master to recover his territory by force of arms. A war ensued, but neither Azadacam, nor Solyman Aga with his Persian auxiliaries, could expel the Portuguese. Hydal Can, tired by the groans of the people, ordered hostilities to cease, but was not obeyed by Azadacam, who, to cover his treason, attempted to poison Hydal Can. Yet soon after the traitor bought his pardon with gold, for gold is omnipotent in the sordid courts of the East. Nunio, however, compelled Azadacam to a truce, but a new enemy immediately arose. The Zamorim, encouraged by Badur, raised an army of about 50,000 men, but was six times defeated by the Portuguese. Badur had now recourse to perfidy. He entreated a conference with Nunio at Diu, and with Souza, the governor of the fort, with intention to assassinate them both. But ere his scheme was ripe, Souza, one day, in stepping into Badur's barge, fell into the water. He was taken up in safety, but some Portuguese, who at a distance beheld his danger, rowed up hastily to his assistance, when Badur, troubled with a villain's fears, ordered Souza to be killed. Four Portuguese gentlemen immediately boarded his barge, and rushed on the tyrant. Iago de Mesqueta wounded him, but though these brave men lost their lives in the attempt, they forced Badur to leap over board for safety. A commotion in the bay ensued, and the king, unable to swim any longer, called out aloud who he was, and begged assistance. A Portuguese officer held out an oar, but as Badur laid hold of it, a common soldier, moved with honest indignation, struck him over the face with a halbert, and repeating his blows, delivered the world of a tyrant, whose remorseless perfidy and cruelty had long disgraced human nature. In this abridged view of the dark barbarous politics, unblushing perfidy, and desolating wars of king Badur, the king of Delhi, and the Hydal Can, we have a complete epitome of the history of India. Century after century contains only a repetition of the same changes in policy, the same desolations, and the same deluges of spilt blood. And who can behold so horrid a picture without perceiving the inestimable benefits which MAY BE DIFFUSED over the East by a potent settlement of Europeans, benefits which true policy, which their own interest demand from their hands, which have in part been given, and certainly will one day be largely diffused. Nunio, as much as possibly he could, improved every opportunity of convincing the natives, that the friendship of his countrymen was capable of affording them the surest defence. Greatly superior to the gross ideas of Gothic conquest he addressed himself to the reason and the interests of those with whom he negociated. He called a meeting of the principal inhabitants and merchants of Cambaya, and laid the papers of the dead king before them. By these, the treacherous designs of king Badur fully appeared, and his negociation to engage the Grand Turk to drive the Portuguese from India was detected. Coje Zofar, one of the first officers of Badur, and who was present at his death, with several others, witnessed the manner of it. And Moors and Pagans alike acquitted the Portuguese. Letters, to this purpose, in Arabic and Persic, signed by Coje Zofar and the chief men of Cambaya, were dispersed by Nunio every where in India and the coasts of Arabia. Nor did this great politician stop here. Superior to bigottry, he did not look to the Pope's Bull for the foundation of authority. The free exercise of the Mohammedan and Brahmin religions was permitted in every Portuguese territory, and not only the laws, the officers appointed, but even the pensions given by king Badur, were continued. The Portuguese settlements now enjoyed prosperity. A privateering war with the Moors of Mecca, and some hostilities in defence of the princes, his allies, were the sole incumbrances of Nunio, while India was again steeped in her own blood. While the new king of Cambaya was dethroned, while Omaum king of Delhi lost an army of above 400,000 men in Bengal, and while Xercham, the king of that country, together with his own life, lost almost as many in the seige of Calijor, Nunio preserved his territory in the Decan in a state of peace and safety, the envy of the other provinces of India. But the armament of the Turk, procured by Badur, now arrived, and threatened the destruction of the Portuguese. Selim, Sultan of Constantinople, a few years before, had defeated the Soldan of Egypt, and annexed his dominions to the Turkish empire. The Mohammedan strength was now more consolidated than ever. The Grand Turk was at war, and meditated conquests in Europe. The traffic of India was the mother and nurse of his naval strength, and the presents sent by king Badur gave him the highest idea of the riches of Indostan. Seventy large vessels, well supplied with cannon and all military stores, under the command of Solyman, Bashaw of Cairo, sailed from the port of Suez, to extirpate the Portuguese from India. The seamen were of different nations, many of them Venetian galley-slaves, taken in war, all of them trained sailors; and 7000 Janisaries were destined to act on shore. Some Portuguese Renegados were also in the fleet; and Coje Zofar, who had hitherto been the friend of Nunio, with a party of Cambayans, joined Solyman. The hostile operations began with the seige of Dio, but when Nunio was ready to sail to its relief with a fleet of eighty vessels, Garcia de Noronha arrived with a commission to succeed him as governor. Nunio immediately resigned, and Noronha, in providing a greater fleet, by a criminal loss of time, reduced the garrison of Dio to the greatest extremity. Here the Portuguese shewed miracles of bravery. Anthony de Sylveyra, the commander, was in every place. Even the women took arms; the officers ladies went from rampart to rampart upbraiding the least appearance of langour. Juan Roderigo, with a barrel of power in his arms, passed his companions, make way , he cried, I carry my own and many a man's death . His own, however, he did not, for he returned safe to his station; but above a hundred of the enemy were destroyed by the explosion of the powder, which he threw upon one of their batteries. Of 600 men who at first were in the garrison, forty were not now able to bear arms, when Coje Zofar, irritated by the insolence of Solyman, forged a letter to the garrison, which promised the immediate arrival of Noronha. This, as he designed, fell into the hands of Solyman, who immediately hoisted his fails, and with the shattered remains of his formidable fleet, fled to Arabia, where, to avoid punishment, he died by his own hands. But while Nunio restored the affairs of India, the political canker at the court of Lisbon accumulated its malignity. He did not amuse them with the glare of unmeaning Gothic conquests, and the wisdom of his policy was unperceived. Even their historians seem insensible of it, and even the author of Histoire Philosophique , in his account of the Portuguese politics, pays no attention to Nunio, though he even improved upon the ideas of Albuquerk. In place of rewards, chains were prepared in Portugal for this great commander; but his death at sea, after a happy regency of about ten years, prevented the completion of his country's ingratitude. When Noronha was sent to supercede Nunio, an allegorical poet might feign that the d aemon of infatuation directed the councils of Lisbon. Noronha's regency began with an infamous delay of the succours destined by Nunio for Dio. Coje Zofar, by the same spirit of delay, was permitted, long after the departure of Solyman, to harrass the Portuguese of that important place. The Hydal Can, many other princes, and even the Zamorim himself, awed by the dignity and justice of Nunio's government, entreated the alliance of Portugal, and Noronha had the honour to negociate a general peace; a peace, which on the part of the Zamorim, gave the Portuguese every opportunity to strengthen their empire, for it continued thirty years. These transactions, the privateering war with the Moors, some skirmishes in Ceylon, the design, contrary to the king's commission, to appoint his son to succeed him, his death, and the public joy which it occasioned, comprise the history of the regency of the unworthy successor of the generous Nunio. Both the Portuguese and the natives gave unfeigned demonstrations of joy on the appointment of Stephen de Gama, the son of the great Vasco. By his first act he ordered his private estate to be publickly valued, and by his second he lent a great sum to the treasury, which by Noronha was left exhausted. He visited and repaired the forts, and refitted the fleets in every harbour. By his officers he defeated the king of Achem, who disturbed Malaca. He restored tranquility in Cambaya, where the Portuguese territory was invaded by a powerful army, led by Bramaluco, a prince who had been dethroned by king Badur. His brother Christoval he sent on an expedition into Ethiopia  59 , and the governor himself sailed to the Red Sea with a fleet, equipped at his own expence. Here he gave a severe wound to the Turkish naval strength. But while every thing was in prosperity under the brave and generous Stephen, he was suddenly superceded by the elevation of Martin Alonzo de Souza. Though no policy can be more palpably ruinous than that which recalls a governor of decided abilities ere he can possibly complete any plan of importance; yet such recalls, ere now, had been issued from the court of Lisbon. But none of them, perhaps, gave a deeper wound to the Portuguese interest than this. Stephen de Gama trod in the steps of his father and of Albuquerk. Souza's actions were of a different character. He began his government with every exertion to get witnesses to impeach his predecessor, but though he pardoned a murderer on that condition, every accusation was refuted, and Stephen de Gama was received with great honour at Lisbon. Having refused to give his hand, however, to a bride, chosen for him by John III. he found it convenient to banish himself from his native country, the country which his father had raised to its highest honours. He retired therefore to Venice, his estate 40,000 crowns less than when he entered upon his short government of two years and one month. Wars of a new character now took place. By the toleration which Nunio gave to the religions of the natives, he rendered the Portuguese settlements happy and flourishing. But gloomy superstition now prevailed, and Souza was under the direction of priests, who esteemed the butcheries of religious persecution as the service of heaven. The temples of Malabar were laid in ashes, and thousands of the unhappy natives, for the crime of idolatry, were slaughtered upon their ruined altars. This the Portuguese historians mention as the greatest honour of the piety of their countrymen, ignorant of the detestation which such cruelty must certainly bring upon the religion which inspires it: ignorant too, that true religion, under the toleration of a Nunio, possesses its best opportunity to conquer the heart by the display of its superior excellence. At the seige of Batecala, the Portuguese soldiers quarrelled about the booty, and while fighting with each other, were attacked by the natives and driven to their ships. The pay of the common soldiers had been diminished by Souza, and they freely owned that this was the cause of the mutiny. The city afterward was taken, and the streets ran with blood; such was the rage of the army to recompence themselves by plunder. The king of Ormuz, unable to pay the exorbitant tribute exacted from him, which was now six times more than the tax imposed by Albuquerk, resigned his revenues to the Portuguese. Azadacam, now in open war with his master the Hydal Can Abraham, drew Souza to his party. The design was to dethrone Abraham, who had been always friendly to the Portuguese, and to place Meale Can his brother in his dominions. The Portuguese officers murmured at this shameless injustice, but only Pedro de Faria, trusting to his venerable years, had the courage to remonstrate with the governor. Souza, haughty as he was, listened to the man of fourscore, and confessed that he had saved both his life and his honour. The attempt, however, was highly resented by the Hydal Can, who gathered such a storm to crush the Portuguese, that Souza, foreseeing the tempest that was hovering over him, threatened to open the commissions, and resign to the governor next named. He complained that he could not govern men who had neither truth nor honour; he did not consider, however, that his unjust treatment of the common soldiers occasioned their disorder and disobedience. But while he thus meditated a cowardly and treacherous retreat, treacherous because it was to desert his post in the hour of danger, a fleet from Portugal brought the great John de Castro, the successor of the embarrassed undetermined Souza. The naval and military strength of the Portuguese in India was in a sickly condition. Great discontent among the few who were honest; all was villainy and disorder among the rest. The natives, earnest for their total extirpation, from different provinces joined Hydal Can, and their warlike operations began with the seige of Diu. John de Mascarene, the governor, made a brave defence, and the Portuguese displayed many prodigies of valour. Azadacam, Coje Zofar, and others, of the greatest military reputation, directed the attacks, and lost their lives in the seige. Whenever a breach was made, the Turks and Indians pressed on by ten thousands, but were always repulsed. Unnumbered artillery thundered on every side, and mines were sprung, by one of which Fernando, the son of Castro, was with his battallion blown up in the air. After eight months Castro arrived with a large fleet, and without opposition entered the fort. From thence he marched out at the head of 2500 Portuguese and some auxiliaries of Cochin. The numerous army of Hydal Can continued in their trenches, which were defended with ramparts and a profusion of artillery. But the enemy were driven from their works, and pursued with incredible slaughter through the streets of the city. Rume Can, the son of Zofar, rallied about 8000 of his bravest troops, and was totally defeated by Castro  60 . It was necessary to prosecute the war, and the governor, in great want of money to carry it on, desired the citizens of Goa to advance a loan of 20,000 pardaos, for which he sent them a lock of his mustacheos in pledge. A security indeed uncommon; but which included in it a signal pawn of his honour. More money than he required was sent, and even the women stript themselves of their bracelets and other jewels to supply his want. The jewels, however, he returned, and having with great assiduity improved his naval and military strength, he and his captains carried fire and sword over the dominions of the hostile princes, while Hydal Can, with an army of 150,000 men, retired before him. The king of Achem was also defeated at Malaca, and the stubborn villainy of the debauched Portuguese soldiers and traders was the only enemy unsubdued. While he laboured in this much more arduous war, in correcting the abuses of the revenue, and the distribution of justice, grief, it is said, impaired Castro's health and hastened his end, at a time when Hydal Can and all who had been in arms against the Portuguese were suing for peace. On the approach of death he appointed a council of select persons to take the management of affairs. And so poor was the great Castro, that the first act of this committee was an order to supply the expences of his death-bed from the king's revenue; for a few reals, not half a dozen, was all the property found in his cabinet. Garcia de Sa, an experienced officer, succeeded this great man, and concluded the various treaties of peace, procured by the arms, and in agitation at the death of Castro, greatly to the advantage and honour of Portugal. Here Camoens ends his prophetic song, and here also the most important period of the history of the Portuguese empire in Asia is naturally wound up. A repetition of the same oppressive impolitical measures, which had often armed the East against them, describes the conduct of the governors who ruled India for twenty years after Castro. But the rapine of individuals every year became more shameless and more general. Indian women of quality were publickly dragged from their friends by Portuguese ravishers. When the Count de Redonda was governor, a Portuguese ship, contrary to the treaty of peace, was attacked by three vessels of Malabar. Redonda complained, and was answered by the Zamorim, that some rebels had done it, whom he was welcome to seize and chastise. Irritated by this reply, he sent Dominic de Mesquita with three ships to scour the coast of Malabar. And Mesquita soon murdered above 2000 Malabrians, the greatest part of whom were sewed up in their own sail cloths and wantonly drowned. When the Zamorim complained, Redonda retorted his own reply, "It was done by rebels, whom he was welcome to seize and chastise." A spirited reprisal is often the most decisive measure; but this inhuman one, surely, was not dictated by wisdom. Harrassed by their cruel awful tyrants, who trampled on every law of humanity and good policy, the princes of India combined in a general league for the utter extirpation of the Portuguese. Eastern politics never produced a better concerted plan of operation than this, and so confident were the natives of success, that not only the possessions of the Portuguese, but the most beautiful of their wives and daughters were also divided among them. Five years was this league in forming; at last, at the same instant, the king of Ternate attacked the Malucos, the king of Achem invaded Malaca, the queen of Garzopa carried her arms against Onor; Surat was seized by Agalachem, a prince tributary to the Mogul; the Hydal Can attacked Chaul, Daman, Bazaim and Goa; and the Zamorim laid seige to Mangalor, Cochin and Cananor. And even the ancient Christians of St. Thomas, persecuted by the archbishops of Goa, for non-submission to the See of Rome, joined the Pagans and Mohammedans against the natives of Portugal. But where even the embers of virtue remain, danger and an able general will awake them into a flame. Luis de Ataide, the Portuguese governor, was advised to withdraw his troops from the exterior parts for the support of Goa, the seat of their empire. But this he gallantly refused, and even permitted a fleet with 400 men to sail for Portugal. No sooner did he gain an advantage in one place than he sent relief to another. He and the best troops hastened from fort to fort, and victory followed victory, till the leaders of this most formidable combination sued for peace. A signal proof of what valour and military art may do against the greatest multitudes of undisciplined militia. The brave Ataide, after his return to Portugal, was sent a second time Viceroy to India  61 , where, soon after the defeat of king Sebastian in Africa, he died of melancholy, so deeply was he affected with the fall of his country, which he foresaw and foretold. Gama, Albuquerk, and Nunio de Cunha, certainly understood the great principles upon which a foreign commerce can only be established and rendered secure. But the court of Lisbon, and most of the other governors, never perceived the true interest of their empire. When errors in government begin, the wise see the secret disease, but it is the next generation that feels the worst of its effects. Camoens, whose political penetration was perhaps unequalled in his age and country, saw the declension of manners, and foretold in vain the fall of empire. Portugal owed its existence to the spirit of chivalry and the ideas of liberty, which were confirmed by the statutes of Lamego. Camoens, in a fine allegory, laments the decay of the ancient virtues. Under the character of a huntsman he paints the wild romantic pursuits of king Sebastian, and wishes that he may not fall the victim of his blind passion. The courtiers he characterises, \--- each for some base interest of his own, With flattery's manna'd lips assails the throne. And the clergy, the men of letters --- \--- trim'd the lamp at night's mid hour, To plan new laws to arm the regal power, Sleepless at night's mid hour to raze the laws, The sacred bulwarks of the people's cause, Framed ere the blood of hard-earn'd victory On their brave father's helm-hackt swords was dry. Unperceived by the unlettered nobility, the principles of the constitution gradually expired under the artful increase of the royal perogative. If Sebastian was more absolute than John the First, his power was bought by the degeneracy and weakness of his subjects, the certain price with which monarchs purchase their beloved despotism. The neglect of one man of merit is the signal for the worthless, if rich, to croud to court. Many of these signals were given in the reigns of Emmanuel, John III. Sebastian, and his successor the Cardinal Henry; and thus the labours of an Albuquerk, a Nunio, a Castro, and an Ataide, were frustrated and reversed. These governors, bred in war, enthusiasts in honour, all died poor. Xarafo, the creature of Sampayo, the tyrant of his master the king of Ormuz, charged with murders and the most unbounded extortion, was sent in irons to Lisbon. But he carried his treasures with him, and was restored to his employments. Anthony Galvam, the most honest of men, saved the Malucos, returned poor to Portugal, and like Pacheco, died in an alms-house. Some of the first nobility and princes of the blood were after Castro made Viceroys of India. Nor came they there on purpose to return with empty coffers  62 . Under the shade of silken umbrellas they rode to battle in chairs carried on men's shoulders. All was luxury, weakness, and unlimitted oppression. Ataide effected a glorious recovery of the Portuguese affairs, but they soon relapsed with doubled confusion into their former disorder. Both before and after this period, a long succession of governors, in one uniform course, regardless of the injury which the commerce of their country sustained by their depredations, studiously kindled unjust wars, that they might enrich themselves by the enormous plunder. Sebastian lost his crown in Africa, and was succeeded by an old weak man, his grand uncle Cardinal Henrico. Two years closed Henry's pusillanimous sway, and Philip II. of Spain soon after made himself master of the kingdom of Portugal. Totally engrossed by their immense American empire and the politics of Europe, the Spanish court paid little attention to Portuguese India. Little or no supplies arrived from Europe. The commanders on the different stations ceased to act in concert with each other. Unrestrained by a regular government, each endeavoured to enrich himself. Their mother country groaned under the yoke of Spain. Mostly natives of the East, the Portuguese in India lost all affection for Portugal, and indeed the political chain which bound them together was now but a slender thread. The will of the captain of the fort was absolute, and his protection of the most audacious plunderers was the support of his power. Around the Malucos, fort after fort fell into the hands of the neighbouring princes. Some of the Portuguese were impaled, others entered into the service of their conquerors, and in many actions fought against each other with the greatest rancour. In this wretched condition of Portuguese Asia, Houtman, a Dutch merchant, in jail for debt at Lisbon, planned the establishment of his countrymen in the East. The Hollanders paid his debts; he sailed for the East, and returned with credentials of his promise, which gave birth to the Dutch India company, an institution of deep commercial wisdom. In Java and the Malucos, where the Portuguese were weakest, the Dutch began their operations, and from thence carried their hostilities into Bengal and the other parts of India. The Portuguese valour seemed to revive, and the Dutch, in many engagements, were defeated. Their vanquished fleets, however, carried rich cargoes to Europe, and brought fresh supplies. The Portuguese Jesuits omitted no invention that might inflame the natives against them; even their republican form of government was urged as big with ruin to the Indian princes. But the detestation of the Portuguese name was deep in India; and that rooted odium, to which their villainies and cruelties had given birth and had long nourished, was now felt to militate against them more than millions in arms. Had the general conduct of the Portuguese governors been like that of Albuquerk, had the princes of India mourned over their graves, no strangers had ever established themselves on the ruin of such allies. Though repeatedly defeated in war, the Dutch commerce increased, the harbours of India received them with kindness, and gave them assistance, while the friendless detested Portuguese, though victorious in almost every skirmish, were harrassed out and daily weakened. Like beasts of prey in their dens, or mountaineer banditti, they kept their gloomy fortresses, their destruction the with of the natives, who yet were afraid too openly to provoke the rage of these wolves and tygers. Five years after the arrival of the Dutch, the English also appeared in India. The Dutch, who pleaded the law of nature, without ceremony entered the best harbours, and endeavoured to drive the Portuguese from their settlements. The English, in 1601, under Sir James Lancaster, erected several factories in India, but they went to ports open to all, and interfered with neither Dutch, Portuguese, nor Moorish settlement. Twenty English fleets made the voyage to India without hostility, when the Portuguese Jesuits brought on a rupture, which ended in the loss of the Portuguese military reputation. Every treacherous art which the Moors practised against Gama was repeated by the Jesuits, and the event was the same. The Jesuit Pinneus influenced the Mogul against the English, and commerce with them was interdicted. While Captain Best in a large ship, and Captain Salmon in a bomb ketch, lay near Surat, Nunio de Cunha, with four large galliots and twenty-five frigates, was sent to destroy them. An Indian, who had been aboard the English ships, told Nunio that they had not above a week's provision, and that he had nothing to do but to prevent them to take in fresh water. Nunio replied, that he would not spend a week's provisions upon his own men to purchase a victory that might be gained in an hour . And in the same high spirit he sent Canning, an English prisoner in his custody, to help his countrymen to fight, boasting, that he would soon take him again with more company . As Nunio advanced, with red banners displayed, Best weighed his anchors, and began the fight in the centre of the four large galliots; and Captain Salmon, in the bomb ketch, behaved with equal courage  63 . The Mogul had an army at this time upon the shore. The beach and the eminences were covered with spectators. And now those who had deemed the Portuguese invincible at sea, with astonishment beheld nine and twenty ships vanquished and put to flight by two vessels. But they knew not that the victors had fought under a Drake and a Raleigh. After the arrival of the Dutch, the Spanish court began to pay some attention to India, and supplies were sent against them and the English. But Thomas Best, in a harder conflict, was again victorious. Azevedo, the Viceroy nominated by Spain, prepared an armament of eight vessels, each of about 600 tons, and sixty frigates; but though often braved by the English, reinforced only with four ships, to the deeper astonishment of all India, he declined the combat, and suffered the English, unmolested, to proceed homeward with loaded ships. The reputation of the Portuguese valour was now no more. The Dutch power increased, and the natives in every place openly declared war against them. Philip de Brito Nicote, whose bravery and villainy were the scourge and terror of Siam and the adjacent regions, after a brave defence, was overpowered in his strong fort of Siriam. His wife and soldiers were maimed and sent into slavery. He himself and his malekindred were impaled on the ramparts of his garrison. While the memory of the injuries suffered by the natives thus poured destruction upon the unpitied Portuguese, the Spanish court compleated the ruin of their eastern empire. The expence of the supplies lately sent, far exceeded the advantages reaped by Spain. And Azevedo, the Viceroy, received an order from the court of Madrid, to dispose of every employment, of every office under him, by public sale, that money might be raised to support his government. We now need add no circumstance more. The history of the fall of the Portuguese empire is here complete. Every thing after was headlong declension. A succession of governors continued, and still continue; but of all their numerous settlements on every coast of the eastern world, the ports of Goa and Diu in India, and the isle of Macao in the bay of Canton, only remain in the possession of the Portuguese. Two small vessels, often Chinese, once in the year carry some porcelaine to Goa and Diu, but these must touch at Surat and other ports to complete their return of silk and spicery. And one ship, with a poor cargo, according to Histoire Philosophique , partly furnished by the two sloops of Macao, and partly purchased from the English, sails once in the year from Goa for Lisbon. Such is the fall of that power which once commanded the commerce of Africa and Asia from the straits of Gibraltar to the eastern side of Japan. The author, just now mentioned, in his reflections on the fate of the Portuguese, informs his reader, that while the court of Lisbon projected the discovery of India, and expected inexhaustible riches, the more moderate and enlightened foresaw and foretold the evils which would follow success. And time, says he, the supreme judge of politics, hastened to fulfill their predictions. He, however, who is acquainted with the Portuguese Historians, must perceive the errors of this misrepresentation. The objections against the voyage of Gama, were by no means of the enlightened kind. They were these: Nothing but barren deserts, like Lybia, were to be found; or, if the discovered lands were rich, the length of the voyage would render it unprofitable; or if profitable, the introduction of wealth would beget a degeneracy of manners fatal to the kingdom. Foreign settlements would produce a depopulation and neglect of agriculture; or if foreign colonies were necessary, Ethiopia offered both nearer and better settlements. And the wrath of the Soldan of Egypt, and a combination of all Europe against Portugal, completed the prophecy of the threatened evils. But it was neither foreseen nor foretold, that the unexampled misconduct of the Portuguese would render the most lucrative commerce of the world an heavy, and at last insupportable expence on the treasury of Lisbon or Madrid; nor was it foretold, that the shameless villainy, the faithless piracies and rapine of their countrymen would bring down destruction upon their empire. Of the objections here enumerated, few are named by our author. Nor does the evil of the increase of wealth, the depopulation and neglect of agriculture, which he mentions as the consequences of the navigation to India, do honour to the wisdom of those who foretold them, or to that of those who adopt the opinion. Many have pronounced, that the same evils which overwhelmed the Portuguese, are ready to burst upon the British empire; an enquiry, therefore, into the cause from whence these evils sprung, is of no trivial importance to the British nation. Mines of gold, though most earnestly desired, are the least valuable parts of foreign acquisition. To encrease the population of the mother country is the only real wealth, and this can only be attained by increasing the means of employment, in such manner as will naturally inspire the spirit of industry. The staple commodities of a country must therefore be manufactured at home, and from hence, agriculture will of necessity be improved. To export the domestic manufacture, and import the commodities of foreign countries, are the great, the only real uses of foreign settlements. But did Spain and Portugal derive these advantages from their immense acquisitions in the East and West? Every thing contrary. The gold of Mexico and Peru levied the armies of Charles V. but established or encouraged no trade in his kingdom. Poverty and depopulation, therefore, was not the natural consequence of the discoveries of Columbus, but the certain result of the evil policy of Spain. We have seen how the traffic of India was managed by Portugal. That commerce which was the foundation of the maritime strength of the Mohammedan powers, and which enriched Venice, was not only all in the power of the Portuguese, but it was their's also to purchase that traffic on their own terms with the commodities of Europe. Had these methods been pursued, Portugal, a much finer country, had soon been more populous than Holland is now. He who foretells the neglect of agriculture on the increase of commerce, foretells an event contrary to the nature of things; and nothing but an infatuation, which cannot at a distance be foreseen, may possibly fullfil the prediction. Ignorance of the true principles of commerce, that great cause of the fall of the Portuguese empire, does not at present threaten the British; nor is the only natural reason of that fall applicable to Great Britain. The territory of Portugal is too small to be the head of so extensive an empire as once owned its authority. Auxiliaries may occasionally assist, but permanancy of dominion can only be ensured by native troops. The numerous garrisons of Portugal in Brazil, in Africa and Asia, required more supplies than the seat of empire could afford without depriving itself of defence in case of invasion. In the event, the foreign garrisons were lost for want of supplies, and the seat of empire, on the shock of one disaster, fell an easy prey to the usurpation of Spain. Great Britain, on the contrary, by the appointment of nature, reigns the commercial empress of the world. The unrivalled island is neither too large nor too small. Ten millions of inhabitants are naturally sufficient to afford armies to defend themselves against the greatest power; nor is such radical strength liable to fall asunder by its own weight. Neither is nature less kind in the variety of the climate of the British isles. That variety in her different provinces alike contributes to the production of her invaluable staples and hardy troops. Won and defended from the Mohammedans in wars esteemed religious, the circumstances of Portugal, produced a high and ardent spirit of chivalry, which raised her to empire; but when success gave a relaxation to the action of this spirit, the general ignorance of all ranks sunk her into ruin. The circumstances of the British empire are greatly different. Her military spirit is neither cherished by, nor dependent upon causes which exist in one age and not in another; and deep, indeed, must be her degeneracy, when all her ranks are as ignorant of her true interest as those of Portugal were, previous to her fall. Nor is the increase of wealth big with such evils as some esteem. Portugal did not owe her fall to it, for she was not enriched by the commerce of India. And if Great Britain ever suffer by enormous wealth, it must be by a general corruption of manners. This, however, is infinitely more in the power of government than some surmise. To remedy an evil we must trace its source. And never was there national corruption of manners which did not flow from the vices and errors of government. Where merit is the only passport to promotion, corruption of manners cannot be general. Where the worthless can purchase the offices of trust, universal profligacy must follow. It was not the acquisitions given by Columbus, it was the dull ignorant politics of Madrid which rendered America in any degree a curse to Spain. It was not the fall of Carthage that corrupted Rome, it was the want of knowledge and the want of virtue in the Roman Senate which introduced that venality, which, as a hectic fever, consumed the Roman strength. Mankind, it may be said, are liable to be corrupted, and wealth affords the opportunity. But this axiom will greatly mislead us from the line of truth, if taken in a general sense. The middle rank of men is infinitely more virtuous than the lowest. Profligacy of manners is not therefore the natural consequence of affluence, it is the accident which attends a vulgar mind in whatever external situation. And when vulgar minds are preferred to the high offices of church or state, it is the negligence, or wickedness of government, and not the increase of wealth, which is the source of national corruption. Some articles of traffic have an evil influence on a people. But neither is this in justice to be charged on the increase of national trade. The true principles of commerce on the contrary, require the restriction of many  64 , and perhaps the prohibition of some articles. And ignorance of the true spirit of commerce, and neglect in the legislature, are therefore the only sources of these evils. The ascendency of this ignorance and this neglect, are always attended with venality, and must prove fatal in every country. The two first fatal to the commercial strength, venality to the national power and manners. When the king of Spain commanded Azevedo, his Viceroy of India, to dispose of every office by public sale, he made an edict, that merit should be neglected, and that the most worthless and unfit should only be entrusted with the public affairs. Exactly proportioned to the degrees of venality, as it is checked or predominant, does the constitutional health of every empire recover or decline. That of Portuguese Asia, from the complex variety of causes we have traced, had long struggled in a deep consumption, and was now in the last stage, when Philip II. made an edict in open favour of venality, an act which almost immediately ended her political existence. If happily many of the causes of the fall of Portugal do not threaten the British empire; yet against those causes last mentioned, Great Britain cannot be too well guarded; and may He who foretells her danger from them, never prove a Cassandra in prophecy; may He never have the gift of foretelling what is true, and yet be fated to obtain no credit!---But if the fall of the Portuguese empire be an example peculiarly held up to the British, still more particularly does the history of Portuguese Asia demand the attention of that stupendous Common Wealth, the United East India Company. The histories of wars, from the earliest times, are much alike; the names of the countries ravished, the towns destroyed, and captains slain, are different; the motives and conduct of the oppressors, and the miseries of the oppressed, are the same. Portugal raised the first commercial empire of the modern world; the history of her fate therefore opens a new field for the most important speculation. The transactions of the Portuguese in India are peculiarly the wars and negociations of commerce, and therefore offer instructions to every trading country, which are not to be found in the campaigns of a Caesar or a Marlborough. The prosperity and declension of foreign settlements, resulting from the wisdom or errors of the supreme power at home, from the wisdom or imprudence, the virtues or vices of governors abroad; The stupendous effects of unstained honour and faith; The miserable ruinous embarrassments which attend dishonest policy, though supported by the greatest abilities in the field or in the council; The uncommercial and dreadful consequences of wars unjustly provoked, though crowned with a long series of victories; The self-destructive measures, uncommercial spirit and inherent weakness of despotic rule; The power, affluence, and stability which reward the liberal policy of humane government; in a word, All those causes which nourish the infancy, all those which as a secret disease undermine, or as a violent poison suddenly destroy the vital strength of a commercial empire; all these are developed and displayed, in the most exemplary manner, in the history of the transactions of Portuguese Asia. And all these combine to ascertain the one great principle upon which the British East India Company must exist or fall. The viceroy or governor always finds two interests, often different from each other, soliciting his attention; the public interest and his own private one. If institutions cannot be devised to render it the true interest of governors, to make that of the public their first care, stability cannot be preserved  65 .---But it were unjust to require the poverty of an Albuquerk or a Nunio. He who devotes his life to the service of his country, merits a reward adequate to his station. An estimate of the reward which true policy will give, may be drawn from the fate of the Dutch settlement at Brazil. Prince Maurice of Nassau, the general of a Dutch West India company, expelled the Portuguese from one half of this rich and extensive country. In reward of his service he was appointed governor, but his mercantile masters, earnest for immediate gain, and ignorant of what was necessary for future security, were offended at the grandeur in which he lived, the number of fortresses which he built, and the expence of the troops which he kept. They forced him by ill treatment to resign, and the ideas of the compting-house were now adopted. The expence of troops and of fortresses was greatly reduced; even that of the court of justice was retrenched; in their commerce with their new subjects every advantage of the sordid trader was taken, and payment was enforced with the utmost rigour. Cent. per cent. was now divided in Holland, and all was happy in the idea of the Burgo-masters, the Lords of this colony; when the Portuguese, invited by the defenceless state, and joined by the discontented subjects of the Dutch, overwhelmed them with ruin. Though the States now interested themselves vigourously, all the great expence of their armaments was lost. Brazil was recovered by the Portuguese, and the Dutch East India Company was utterly extinguished. Nor can we close our observations without one more. Nunio acquired an extensive territory in India. Harrassed by the horrible wars of their native princes, the regions around Goa implored the Portuguese to take them under protection. And safe and happy, while all around was steeped in blood, the territory under the dominion of Nunio was the envy and wonder of India. Taught by this example, every humane breast must warm on the view of the happiness which the British India Company MAY diffuse over the East, a happiness which the British  66 are peculiarly enabled to bestow. Besides the many instances of Portuguese tyranny and misconduct already enumerated, there was a defect in their government which must ever prove fatal to a commercial empire. All the stupendous efforts of Portuguese colonization were only founded on the sands, on the quick-sands of human caprice and arbitrary power. They governed by no certain system of laws. Their governors carried to India the image of the court of Lisbon, and against the will of the Ruler there was no appeal to the civil power. Confidence in the high justice of a Nunio may give nations habituated to oppression a temporary spirit of industry; but temporary it must be, as a hasty journey made in the uncertain interval of a tempest. The cheerful vigour of commerce can only be uniform and continued where the merchant is conscious of protection on his appeal to known laws of supreme authority. On the firm basis of her laws the colonies of Great Britain have wonderfully prospered, for she gave them an image of her own constitution. And even where the government of the natives cannot be new modelled, an easy appeal to the supremacy of her civil laws, must place her commerce upon the surest foundation. It is not the spirit of Gothic conquest, it is not the little cunning finesse of embroiling the Indian princes among themselves; of cajoling one and winning another; it is not the groveling arts of intrigue, often embarrassed, always shifting, which can give lasting security. An essential decisive predominancy of the justice of laws like the British, can alone secure the prosperity of the most powerful commercial system, or render its existence ADVANTAGEOUS or even SAFE to the seat of Empire. The next period of the Introduction to the Lusiad requires Nature, as if in pity of the literary rudeness of that nation, produced one great Poet, to record the numberless actions of high spirit performed by his countrymen. Except Osorius, the historians of Portugal are little better than dry journalists. But it is not their inelegance which rendered the poet necessary. It is the peculiar nature of poetry to give a colouring to heroic actions, and to express an indignation against the breaches of honour, in a spirit which at once seizes the heart of the man feeling, and carries with it an instantaneous conviction. The brilliant actions of the Portuguese form the great hinge which opened the door to the most important alteration in the civil history of mankind. And to place these actions in the light and enthusiasm of poetry, that enthusiasm which particularly assimulates the youthful breast to its own fires, was Luis de Camoens, the poet of Portugal, born. Different cities claimed the honour of his birth. But according to N. Antonio, and Manuel Correa his intimate friend, this event happened at Lisbon in 1517. His family was of considerable note, and originally Spanish. In 1370, Vasco Perez de Caamans, disgusted at the court of Castile, fled to that of Lisbon, where king Ferdinand immediately admitted him into his council, and gave him the lordships of Sardoal, Punnete, Marano, Amendo, and other considerable lands; a certain proof of the eminence of his rank and abilities. In the war for the succession, which broke out on the death of Ferdinand, Caamans, sided with the king of Castile, and was killed in the battle of Aljabarrota. But though John I. the victor, seized a great part of his estate, his widow, the daughter of Gonsalo Tereyro, grand master of the order of Christ, and general of the Portuguese army, was not reduced beneath her rank. She had three sons, who took the name of Cam oens. The family of the eldest inter-married with the first nobility of Portugal, and even, according to Castera, with the blood royal. But the family of the second brother, whose fortune was slender, had the superior honour to produce the Author of the Lusiad. Early in his life the misfortunes of the Poet began. In his infancy, Simon Vaz de Camoens, his father, commander of a vessel, was shipwrecked at Goa, where, with his life, the greatest part of his fortune was lost. His mother, however, Anne de Macedo of Santarene, provided for the education of her son Luis at the university of Coimbra. What he acquired there his works discover: An intimacy with the classics, equal to that of a Scaliger, but directed by the taste of a Milton or a Pope. When he left the university he appeared at court. He was handsome  67 , had speaking eyes, it is said, and the finest complexion. Certain it is, however, he was a polished scholar, which added to the natural ardour and gay vivacity of his disposition, rendered him an accomplished gentleman. Courts are the scenes of intrigue, and intrigue was fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of the amours of Camoens rest unknown. This only appears: He had aspired above his rank, for he was banished from the court; and in several of his sonnets he ascribes this misfortune to love. He now retired to his mother's friends at Santarene. Here he renewed his studies, and began his Poem on the Discovery of India. John III. at this time prepared an armament against Africa. Camoens, tired of his inactive obscure life, went to Ceuta in this expedition, and greatly distinguished his valour in several rencounters. In a naval engagement with the Moors in the straits of Gibraltar, in the conflict of boarding he was among the foremost, and lost his right eye. Yet neither the hurry of actual service not the dissipation of the camp could stifle his genius. He continued his Lusiadas , and several of his most beautiful sonnets were written in Africa, while, as he expresses it, One hand the pen, and one the sword employ'd. The fame of his valour had now reached the court, and he obtained permission to return to Lisbon. But while he solicited an establishment which he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil tongues, as he calls it in one of his letters, was injuriously poured upon him. Though the bloom of his early youth was effaced by several years residence under the scorching heavens of Africa, and though altered by the loss of an eye, his presence gave uneasiness to the gentlemen of some families of the first rank where he had formerly visited. Jealousy is the characteristic of the Spanish and Portuguese; its resentment knows no bounds, and Camoens now found it prudent to banish himself from his native country. Accordingly, in 1553, he sailed for India, with a resolution never to return. As the ship left the Tagus he exclaimed, in the words of the sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus, Ingrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea! Ungrateful country, thou shalt not possess my bones! But he knew not what evils in the East would awake the remembrance of his native fields. When Camoens arrived in India, an expedition was ready to sail to revenge the king of Cochin on the king of Pimenta. Without any rest on shore after his long voyage, he joined this armament, and in the conquest of the Alagada islands, displayed his usual bravery. But his modesty, perhaps, is his greatest praise. In a sonnet he mentions this expedition: We went to punish the king of Pimenta, says he, e succedeones bem, and we succeeded well . When it is considered that the Poet bore no inconsiderable share in the victory, no ode can conclude more elegantly, more happily than this. In the year following he attended Manuel de Vasconcello in an expedition to the Red Sea. Here, says Faria, as Camoens had no use for his sword he employed his pen. Nor was his activity confined in the fleet or camp. He visited Mount Felix and the adjacent inhospitable regions of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in one of his little pieces, where he laments the absence of his mistress. When he returned to Goa he enjoyed a transquility which enabled him to bestow his attention on his Epic Poem. But this serenity was interrupted, perhaps by his own imprudence. He wrote some satyrs which gave offence, and by order of the Viceroy Francisco Barreto he was banished to China. Men of dull abilities are more conscious of their embarrassment and errors than is commonly believed. When men of this kind are in power, they affect great solemnity; and every expression of the most distant tendency to lessen their dignity, is held as the greatest of crimes. Conscious also how severely the man of genius can hurt their interest, they bear an instinctive antipathy against him, are uneasy even in his company, and on the slightest pretence are happy to drive him from them. Camoens was thus situated at Goa; and never was there a fairer field for satyr than the rulers of India at this time afforded. Yet whatever esteem the prudence of Camoens may lose in our idea, the nobleness of his disposition will doubly gain. And so conscious was he of his real integrity and innocence, that in one of his sonnets he wishes no other revenge on Barreto, than that the cruelty of his exile should ever be remembered  68 . The accomplishments and manners of Camoens soon found him friends, though under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed commissary of the Defunct in the island of Macao, a Portuguese settlement in the bay of Canton. Here he continued his Lusiad; and here also, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though small, yet equal to his wishes. Don Constantine de Braganza was now Viceroy of India, and Camoens, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his charge. In a ship, freighted by himself, he set sail, but was shipwrecked in the gulph near the mouth of the river Mehon on the coast of China. All he had acquired was lost in the waves: his poems, which he held in one hand, while he swimmed with the other, were all he found himself possessed of, when he stood friendless on the unknown shore. But the natives gave him a most humane reception: this he has imortalised in the prophetic song in the tenth Lusiad 69 ; and in the seventh, he tells us, that here he lost the wealth which satisfied his wishes. Agora da esperan ça ja adquirida , &c. Now blest with all the wealth fond hope could crave, Soon I beheld that wealth beneath the wave Forever lost;--- My life like Judah's heaven-doom'd king of yore By miracle prolong'd --- On the banks of the Mehon, he wrote his beautiful paraphrase of the psalm, where the Jews, in the finest strain of poetry, are represented as hanging their harps on the willows by the rivers of Babylon, and weeping their exile from their native country. Here Camoens continued some time, till an opportunity offered to carry him to Goa. When he arrived at that city, Don Constantine de Braganza, the Viceroy, whose characteristic was politeness, admitted him into intimate friendship, and Camoens was happy till Count Redondo assumed the government. Those who had formerly procured the banishment of the satyrist, were silent while Constantine was in power. But now they exerted all their arts against him. Redondo, when he entered on office, pretended to be the friend of Camoens; yet, with all that unfeeling indifference with which he made his most horrible witticism on the Zamorim, he suffered the innocent man to be thrown into the common prison. After all the delay of bringing witnesses, Camoens, in a public trial, fully refuted every accusation of his conduct, while commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and reproach. But Camoens has some creditors; and these detained him in prison a considerable time, till the gentleman of Goa began to be ashamed, that a man of his singular merit should experience such treatment among them. He was set at liberty; and again he assumed the profession of arms, and received the allowance of a gentlemen volunteer, a character at this time common in Portuguese India. Soon after, Pedro Barreto, appointed governor of the fort at Sofala, by high promises, allured the poet to attend him thither. The governor of a distant fort, in a barbarous country, shares in some measure the fate of an exile. Yet, though the only motive of Barreto was, in this unpleasant situation, to retain the conversation of Camoens at his table, it was his least care to render the life of his guest agreeable. Chagrined with his treatment, and a considerable time having elapsed in vain dependence upon Barreto, Camoens resolved to return to his native country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched at Sofala, and several gentlemen  70 who were on board were desirous that Camoens should accompany them. But this the governor ungenerously endeavoured to prevent, and charged him with a debt for board. Anthony de Cabral, however, and Hector de Sylveyra, paid the demand, and Camoens, says Faria, and the honour of Barreto, were sold together. After an absence of sixteen years, Camoens, in 1569, returned to Lisbon, unhappy even in his arrival, for the pestilence then raged in that city, and prevented his publication for three years. At last, in 1572, he printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, in a most elegant turn of compliment he addressed to his prince, king Sebastian, then in his eighteenth year. The king, says the French translator, was so pleased with his merit, that he gave the Author a pension of 4000 reals, on condition that he should reside at court. But this salary, says the same writer, was withdrawn by Cardinal Henry, who succeeded to the crown of Portugal, lost by Sebastian at the battle of Alcazar. But this story of the pension is very doubtful. Correa, and other cotemporary authors, do not mention it, though some late writers have given credit to it. If Camoens, however, had a pension, it is highly probable that Henry deprived him of it. While Sebastian was devoted to the chace, his grand uncle, the Cardinal, presided at the council board, and Camoens, in his address to the king, which closes the Lusiad, advises him to exclude the clergy from state affairs. It was easy to see that the Cardinal was here intended. And Henry, besides, was one of those statesmen who can perceive no benefit resulting to the public from elegant literature. But it ought also to be added in completion of his character, that under the narrow views and weak hands of this Henry, the kingdom of Portugal fell into utter ruin; and on his death, which closed to short inglorious reign, the crown of Lisbon, after a faint struggle, was annexed to that Madrid. Such was the degeneracy of the Portuguese, a degeneracy lamented in vain by Camoens, and whose observation of it was imputed to him as a crime. Though the great  71 patron of one species of literature, a species the reverse of that Camoens, certain it is, that the author of the Lusiad was utterly neglected by Henry, under whose inglorious reign he died in all the misery of poverty. By some, it is said, he died in an alms-house. It appears, however, that he had not even the certainly of subsistence, which these houses provide. He had a black servant, who had grown old with him, and who had long experienced his master's humanity. This grateful Indian, a native of Java, who, according to some writers, saved his master's life in the unhappy shipwreck where he lost his effects, begged in the streets of Lisbon for the only man in Portugal on whom God had bestowed those talents, which have a tendency to erect the spirit of a downward age. To the eye of a careful observer, the fate of Camoens throws great light on that of his country, and will appear strictly connected with it. The same ignorance, the same degenerated spirit, which suffered Camoens to depend on his share of the alms begged in the streets by his old hoary servant, the same spirit which caused this, sunk the kingdom of Portugal into the most abject vassallage ever experienced by a conquered nation. While the grandees of Portugal were blind to the ruin which impended over them, Camoens beheld it with a pungency of grief which hastened his exit. In one of his letters he has these remarkable words, " Em fim accaberey a vida, e verram todos que fuy afeiçoada a minho patria , &c." I am ending the course of my life, the world will witness how I have loved my country. I have returned, not only to die in her bosom, but to die with her." In another letter, written a little before his death, he thus, yet with dignity, complains, "Who has seen on so small a theatre as my poor bed, such a representation of the disappointments of fortune. And I, as if she could not herself subdue me, I have yielded and become of her party; for it were wild audacity to hope to furmount such accumulated evils." In this unhappy situation, in 1579, in his sixty-second year, the year after the fatal defeat of Don Sebastian, died Luis de Camoens, the greatest literary genius ever produced by Portugal; in martial courage and spirit of honour nothing inferior to her greatest heroes. And in a manner suitable to the poverty in which he died was he buried. Soon after, however, many epitaphs honoured his memory; the greatness of his merit was universally confessed, and his Lusiad was translated into various languages  72 . Nor ought it to be omitted, that the man so miserably neglected by the weak king Henry, was earnestly enquired after by Philip of Spain, when he assumed the crown of Lisbon. When Philip heard that Camoens was dead, both his words and his countenance expressed his disappointment and grief. From the whole tenor of his life, and from that spirit which glows throughout the Lusiad, it evidently appears that the courage and manners of Camoens flowed from true greatness and dignity of soul. Though his polished conversation  73 was often courted by the great, he appears so distant from servility, that his imprudence in this respect is by some highly blamed. Yet the instances of it by no means deserve that severity of censure with which some writers have condemned him. Unconscious of the feelings of a Camoens, they knew not that a carelessness in securing the smiles of fortune, and an open honesty of indignation, are almost inseparable from the enthusiasm of fine imagination. The truth is, the man possessed of true genius feels his greatest happiness in the pursuits and excursions of the mind, and therefore makes an estimate of things, very different from that of him whose unremitting attention is devoted to his external interest. The profusion of Camoens is also censured. Had he dissipated the wealth he acquired at Macao, his prosusion indeed had been criminal; but it does not appear that he ever enjoyed any other opportunity of acquiring independence. But Camoens was unfortunate, and the unfortunate man is viewed. \--- through the dim shade his fate casts o'er him: A shade that spreads its evening darkness o'er His brightest virtues, while it shews his foibles Crowding and obvious as the midnight stars, Which in the sunshine of prosperity Never had been descried--- Yet after the strictest discussion, when all the causes are weighed together, the misfortunes of Camoens will appear the fault and disgrace of his age and country, and not of the man. His talents would have secured him an apartment in the palace of Augustus, but such talents are a curse to their possessor in an illiterate nation. After all, however, if he was imprudent on his first appearance at the court of John III. if the honesty of his indignation led him into great impurdence, as certainly it did, when at Goa he satyrised the Viceroy and the first Goths in power; yet let it also be remembered, that "The gifts of imagination bring the heaviest talk upon the vigilance of reason; and to bear those faculties with unerring rectitude or invariable propriety, requires a degree of firmness and of cool attention, which doth not always attend the higher gifts of the mind. Yet difficult as nature herself seems to have rendered the talk of regularity to genius, it is the supreme consolation of dullness and of folly to point with Gothic triumph to those excesses which are the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed. Perfectly unconscious that they are indebted to their stupidity for the consistency of their conduct, they plume themselves on an imaginary virtue, which has its origin in what is really their disgrace.--- Let such, if such dare approach the shrine of Camoens, withdraw to a respectful distance; and should they behold the ruins of genius, or the weakness of an exalted mind, let them be taught to lament, that nature has left the noblest of her works imperfect  74 ." And Poetry is not only the noblest, but also not the least useful, if civilization of manners be of advantage to mankind. No moral truth may be more certainly demonstrated, than that a Virgil or a Milton are not only the first ornaments of a state, but also of the first consequence if the last refinement of the mental powers be of importance. Strange as this might appear to a  75 Burleigh or a Locke, it is philosophically accounted for by Bacon; nor is Locke's opinion either inexplicable, or irrefutable. The great genius of Aristotle, and that of his great resembler, Sir Francis Bacon, saw deeper into the true spirit of poetry and the human affections than a Burleigh. In ancient Greece, the works of Homer were called the lesson or philosophy of kings; and Bacon describes the effects of poetry in the most exalted terms. What is deficient of perfection in history and nature poetry supplies; it thus erects the mind, and confers magnanimity, morality, and delight; "and therefore, says he, it was ever thought to have some participation of divineness  76 ." The love of poetry is so natural to the stronger affections, that the most barbarous nations delight in it. And always it is found, that as the rude war song and eulogy of the dead hero refine, the manners of the age refine also. The history of the stages of poetry is the philosophical history of manners; the only history in which, with certainty, we can behold the true character of past ages. True civilization and a humanised taste of the mental pleasures, are therefore synonimous terms. And most certain it is, where feeling and affection reside in the breast, these must be most forcibly kindled and called into action by the animated representations and living fire of the great poetry. Nor may Milton's evidence be rejected, for though a poet himself, his judgment is founded on nature. According to him, a true taste for the great poetry gives a refinement and energy to all other studies, and is of the last importance in forming the senator and the gentleman. That the poetry of Camoens merits this high character in a singular manner, he that reads it with taste and attention must own: A Differtation on it, however, is the duty of the Translator--- But this must be introduced by an examination of the criticism of Voltaire, a criticism which, though most amazingly erroneous, is generally esteemed in several countries of Europe as the true character of the Lusiad. When Voltaire was in England, previous to his publication of his Henriade, he published in English an Essay on the Epic Poetry of the European nations. In this he highly praised and severely attacked the Lusiad. In his French editions of this Essay, he has made various alterations at different times in the article of Camoens. The original English, however, shall be here cited, and the French alterations attended to as they occur. Nor is it improper to premise, that some most amazing falsities will be detected; the gross misrepresentation of every objection refuted; and demonstration brought, that when Voltaire wrote his English Essay, his knowledge of the Lusiad was entirely borrowed from the bald, harsh, unpoetical version of Fanshaw. "While Trissino, says Voltaire, was clearing away the rubbish in Italy, which barbarity and ignorance had heap'd up for ten centuries, in the way of the arts and sciences, Camouens in Portugal steer'd a new course, and acquir'd a reputation which lasts still among his countrymen, who pay as much respect to his memory, as the English to Milton. "He was a strong instance of the irresistible impulse of nature, which determines a true genius to follow the bent of his talents, in spight of all the obstacles which could check his course. "His infancy lost amidst the idleness and ignorance of the court of Lisbon; his youth spent in romantic loves, or in the war against the Moors; his long voyages at sea, in his riper years; his misfortunes at court, the revolutions of his country, none of all these could suppress his genius. "Emanuel the second king of Portugal, having a mind to find a new way to the East Indies by the ocean, sent Velasco de Gama with a fleet in the year 1497, to that undertaking, which being new, was accounted rash and impracticable, and which of course gained him a great reputation when it succeeded. "Camouens follow'd Velasco de Gama in that dangerous voyage, led by his friendship to him, and by a noble curiosity, which seldom fails to be the character of men born with a great imagination. "He took his voyage for the subject of his poem; he enjoy'd the sensible pleasure, which nobody had known before him, to celebrate his friend, and the things he was an eye witness of. "He wrote his Poem, part on the Atlantic Sea, and part on the Indian shore. I ought not to omit, that in a shipwrack on the coasts of Malabar, he swam a shore, holding-up his poem in one hand, which otherwise had been perhaps lost for ever. "Such a new subject, manag'd by an uncommon genius, could not but produce a sort of Epic Poetry unheard of before. There no bloody wars are fought, no heroes wounded in a thousand different ways; no woman enticed away, and the world over-turn'd for her cause; no empire founded; in short, nothing of what was deem'd before the only subject of poetry. "The Poet conducts the Portuguese fleet to the mouth of the Ganges, round the coasts of Africk. He takes notice in the way, of many nations who live upon the African shore. He interweaves artfully the history of Portugal. The simplicity of his subject, is rais'd by some fictions of different kinds, which I think not improper to acquaint the Reader with. "When the fleet is sailing in the sight of the Cape of Good Hope, call'd then the Cape of the Storms, a formidable shape appears to them, walking in the depth of the sea; his head reaches to the clouds, the storms, the winds, the thunders, and the lightnings hang about him; his arms are extended over the waves. 'Tis the guardian of that foreign ocean unplow'd before by any ship. He complains of being oblig'd to submit to fate, and to the audacious undertaking of the Portuguese, and foretells them all the misfortunes which they must undergo in the Indies. I believe, that such a fiction would be thought noble and proper, in all ages, and in all nations. "There is another, which perhaps would have pleas'd the Italians as well as the Portuguese, but no other nation besides: It is the inchanted island, call'd the Island of Bliss, which the fleet finds in her way home, just rising from the sea, for their comfort and for their reward: Camouens describes that place, as Tasso did some years after, his island of Armida. There a supernatural power, brings in all the beauties, and presents all the pleasures which nature can afford, and which the heart may wish for; a Goddess enamour'd with Velasco de Gama, carries him to the top of an high mountain, from whence she shews him all the kingdoms of the earth, and foretells the fate of Portugal. "After Camouens hath given loose to his fancy, in the lascivious description of the pleasures which Gama and his crew enjoy'd in the island, he takes care to inform the Reader, that he ought to understand by this fiction, nothing but the satisfaction which the virtuous man feels, and the glory which accrues to him by the practice of virtue; but the best excuse for such an invention, is, the charming stile in which it is deliver'd (if we believe the Portuguese) for the beauty of the elocution makes sometimes amends for the faults of the poets, as the colouring of Rubens make some defects in his figures pass unreguarded. "There is another kind of machinery continued throughout all the Poem, which nothing can excuse, in any country whatever; 'tis an unjudicious mixture of the Heathen Gods with our Religion. Gama in a storm addresses his prayers to Christ, but 'tis Venus who comes to his relief; the heroes are christians, and the poet heathen. The main design which the Portuguese are suppos'd to have (next to promoting their trade) is to propagate Christianity; yet Jupiter, Bacchus, and Venus, have in their hands, all the management of the voyage. So incongruous a machinery, casts a blemish upon the whole Poem; yet shews at the same time, how prevailing are its beauties, since the Portuguese like it with all its faults. "Camouens hath a great deal of true wit, and not a little share of false; his imagination hurries him into great absurdities. I remember, that after Velasco de Gama, hath related his adventures to the king of Melinda, now, says he, O king, judge if Ulysses, and Æneas, have travell'd so far, and undergone so many hardships. As if that barbarous African was acquainted with Homer and Virgil. "His poem, in my opinion, is full of numberless faults and beauties, thick sown near one another; and almost in every page, there is something to laugh at, and something to be delighted with. Among his most lucky thoughts, I must take notice of two for the likeness, which they bear to two most celebrated passages of Waller, and Sir John Denham. "Waller says, in his Epistle to Zelinda; Thy matchless form will credit bring, To all the wonders I can sing. "Camouens says, in speaking of the voyages of the Argonautes, and of Ulysses, that the undertaking of the Portuguese shall give credit to all those fables, in surpassing them. "Sir John Denham, in his Poem on Cooper's-Hill, says to the Thames; O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream, My great example, as it is my theme; Tho' deep, yet clear, tho' gentle, yet not dull, Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full. "Camouens addresses the Nymphs of Tagus in the like manner; "O Nymphs, if ever I sung of you, inspire me now with new and strong lays; let my style flow like your waves; let it be deep and clear, as your waters, &c." Such is the original criticism of Voltaire on the Lusiad. And never, perhaps, was there such a random reverie, such a mass of misrepresentations and falsities as the whole of it exhibits. The most excuseable parts of it are superficial in the highest degree. Both the poet and the hero are misnamed by him. The name of the hero has been corrected, that of Camouens remains still in Voltaire, the only author who ever spelled it in this manner. There never was an Emmanuel the second of Portugal. Camoens was not shipwrecked on the coast of Malabar, but on the river Mehon in China. "That Gama went a new way to the East Indies by the ocean ," though corrected in the edition of 1768, affords a most striking proof of Voltaire's very careless perusal of the Lusiad at the time when he first presumed to condemn it. For it is often repeated in the poem, that there was no way to India by the ocean before. That the infancy of Camoens was lost amidst the idleness and ignorance of the court of Lisbon , is certainly false. His youth could not have been spent in idleness or ignorance, for his works display a most masterly accuracy in every branch of ancient literature. Though Voltaire has corrected his error in sending Camoens to the East Indies along with Gama, such an original unparralled romance ought to be recorded. Gama sailed on the discovery of India in 1497. Camoens was born in 1517, and was not seven years of age when Gama died. These facts were immediately objected to Voltaire, but, at first, he would not yield. Contrary to the testimony of Camoens himself, and every circumstance of his life, an  77 hypothesis must defend this favourite supposition. In his Amsterdam edition of 1738, Voltaire boldly asserts that Camoens was a Spaniard, born in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabel, that he came to Lisbon in the first year of Emmanuel, and was in intimate friendship with Gama, whom he accompanied in his first voyage. Certain it is, however, by the archives of Portugal, that Camoens was in India about seventy-two years after this voyage, and that, according to this hypothesis of Voltaire, he must have been near an hundred years old when he published his Lusiad. Voltaire, however, at last, consesses that Camoens did not accompany Gama. Yet such is his accuracy, that even in the edition of 1768, in an essay which he calls Id ee de la Henriade , a few pages before this confession, the old assertion is still retained. " Le Camo uens, qui est le Virgile de Portugais a celebre un evenement dont il avait ete temoin lui-meme. Camouens, the Portuguese Virgil, has celebrated an event of which he himself had been witness." No anecdotes ever threw more light upon a character than these throw upon that of Voltaire. The assertion that the Epic Poet enjoyed the sensible pleasure, which nobody had known before him, to celebrate his friend and the things he was an eye witness of , can only be accounted for by the supposition, that Voltaire was pleased with the idea, and in a little while mistook his strong impression for the remembrance of a fact. The laboured absurd hypothesis, which would defend this fanciful error, cannot be placed in so fair a light. And the error confessed, and still retained, is a true Voltairism . Yet the idea of his accuracy which these accounts of the Poet must inspire, will even be heightened by the examination of his criticism on the poem. The narrative of a voyage constitutes the Odyssey, the half of the Eneid, and forms the body of the Lusiad. Yet the Lusiad, says Voltaire, contains nothing of what was deemed before the only subject of poetry . It forms, indeed, a sort of Epic poetry unheard of before : But Voltaire's objection to this points out its true praise. No heroes , says he, are wounded a thousand different ways, no woman enticed away and the world overturned for her cause \---And must the fate of Helen, and the thousand different wounds described by Homer, be copied by every Epic Poet? If this sentence has any meaning this is included. Yet what is this puerility of criticism in comparison of Voltaire's assertions, that in the Lusiad no bloody wars are fought, no empire founded .---If the destruction of Troy be allowed to be in the Eneid, there are wars enough in the poem of Camoens. The effect of fire-arms on people who never before beheld these dreadful engines, and ahostile town burnt by a fleet, are finely described in that part which is called the action of the Epic Poem. But Voltaire was as utter a stranger to the first book of the Lusiad, as to the East.--- No battle fought, no empire founded ! What insult to the literary world is this! A late correction will never disprove his ignorance when he wrote this. Should a pretended critic on Virgil tell his reader that the poet conducted Eneas to the mouth of the Thames, could we believe he was acquainted with his Author? Yet Voltaire tells us, that Camoens conducts the Portuguese fleet to the mouth of the Ganges round the coasts of Afric .---Camoens, indeed, conducts his fleet to Calicut on the coast of Malabar. But though the scene of the action of the four last books lie upon this coast, Voltaire was not happy enough to dip into any of the numerous passages which fix the geography. He has therefore given the voyage of Gama a dimension almost as much beyond the real one given by Camoens, as the West Indies are distant from England. Such errors are convincing proofs that Voltaire only dipt here and there into the Lusiad, even after the critics set him right in some places; for this gross error is still retained. But a misrepresentation, not founded on ignorance, now offers itself. Gama, in a storm , says Voltaire, addresses his prayers to Christ, but 'tis Venus who comes to his relief .--- A bold assertion still also retained, but there is no such passage in the Lusiad. Gama, in a tempest, prays to the holy Power, to whom nothing is impossible, the sovereign of earth, sea, and land, who led Israel through the waves, who delivered Paul, and who protected the children of the second father of the world from the deluge. But Christ is not once mentioned in the whole passage. To say that Gama was a good Catholic, and intended Christ under these appellations, is unworthy of poetical criticism, where the whole ridicule consists in the opposition of the name of Christ and Venus. Such is the candour of Voltaire! Nor is it difficult to trace the source of this unfair representation. Fanshaw thus translates the mention of Paul, Thou who didst keep and save thy servant Paul--- Monsieur Voltaire wanted no more. Thy servant Paul was to him enough to vindicate the ridicule he chused to bestow. But unhappily for the misguided critic, the original says only, Tu que livraste Paulo 78 \---thou who deliveredst Paul.---And thus we are furnished with a sure hint of the medium by which our critic studied the Lusiad. To this last unblushing falsity, that Gama prays to Christ , is added, in the edition of 1768, " Bacchus & la Vierge Marie se trouveront tout naturellement ensemble . Bacchus and the Virgin Mary are very naturally found together." If words have meaning, this informs the reader, that they are found together in the Lusiad. Yet the truth is, in the whole poem there is no such personage as the Virgin Mary. After these gross falsities, Voltaire adds, " A parler serieusement, un merveilleux si absurde, defigur e tout l'ouvrage aux yeux de lecteurs senses ,---To speak seriously, such an absurdity in the marvellous, disfigures the whole work in the eyes of the sensible readers."---To such as take Voltaire's word for it, it must indeed seem disfigured; but what literary murder is this! Nor does it end here. A similie must enforce the shameless misrepresentation, " It is like the works of Paul Veronese, who has placed Benedictine fathers and Swiss soldiers among his paintings from the Old Testament ." And to this also is added, " Le Camouens tombe presque toujours dans de telles disparates . Camouens almost continually falls into such extravagancies." Yet with equal justice may this sentence be applied to Virgil; and peculiarly unhappy is the instance which Voltaire immediately gives: " I remember , says he, Vasco de Gama says to the king of Melinda, O king, judge if Ulysses and Eneas have travelled so far, and undergone so many hardships: as if that barbarous African was acquainted with Homer and Virgil ." This sentence is still retained in Voltaire's last edition of his works. But, according to history, the Melindians were a humane and polished people; their buildings elegant, and in the manner of Spain. The royal family and grandees were Mohammedan Arabs, descended of those tribes, whose learning, when it suits his purpose, is the boast of Voltaire. The prince of Melinda, with whom Gama conversed, is thus described by the excellent historian Osorius: " In omni autem sermone princeps ille non hominis barbari specimen dabat, sed ingenium et prudentiam eo loco dignam pr ae se ferebat \--- In the whole conversation the Prince betrayed no sign of the barbarian; on the contrary, he carried himself with a politeness and intelligence worthy of his rank."---It is also certain, that this Prince, whom Voltaire is pleased to call a barbarous African, had sufficient opportunity to be acquainted with Homer, for the writings of Homer are translated into the Syriac, in a dialect of which the interpreters of Gama talked with the prince of Melinda  79 . The Lusiad, in my opinion , says Voltaire, is full of numberless faults and beauties, thick sown near one another, and almost in every page there is something to laugh at, and something to be delighted with ." This sentence, though omitted in the French editions, had some source, and that source we shall easily trace. Nor is the character of the king of Melinda so grossly falsified by Voltaire, as the character of the Lusiad of Camoens is here misrepresented. Except the polite repartee of Veloso ( of which see p. 203 .) there are not above two or three passages in the whole poem which even border upon conceit. The most uniform simplicity of manly diction is the true character of the Portuguese Lusiad: Where then did Voltaire find the false wit , and something to laugh at almost in every page ? If there be a translation which strictly deserves this character, we cannot suppose that Voltaire hit this character, and at the same time was so wide of the original, merely by chance. No, he dipt into Fanshaw's Lusiad, where, in every page, there are puns, conceits, and low quaint expressions, uncountenanced by the original. Some citations from Fanshaw will soon justify this assertion. Yet, however decisive this proof may be, it is not the only one. The resemblance found by Voltaire between Sir John Denham's address to the Thames, and that of Camoens to the nymphs of the Tagus, does not exist in the original. Let my stile flow like your waves, let it be deep and clear as your waters \---contains indeed the same allusion as that expressed in the lines cited by Voltaire from Denham. But no such idea or allusion exists in the Portuguese. Though Voltaire still retains this sentence, its unauthenticity has been detected by several critics. But it was left for the present Translator to discover the source of this wide mistranslation. He suspected the allusion might be in Fanshaw, and in Fanshaw he found it. The nymphs of the Tagus are in Sir Richard's version thus addressed: If I in low, yet tuneful verse, the praise Of your sweet river always did proclaim, Inspire me now with high and thundering lays, Give me them clear and flowing like his stream. He who has read Camoens and Fanshaw, will be convinced where Voltaire found the something to laugh at in every page . He who has read neither the original nor that translation, will now perceive that Voltaire's opinion of the Lusiad was drawn from a very partial acquaintance with the unfaithful and unpoetical version of Fanshaw. And, as if all his misrepresentations of the Lusiad were not enough, a new and most capital objection is added in the late editions of Voltaire. " Mais de tous les defauts de ce po eme , &c."---"But of all the faults of this poem, the greatest is the want of connection, which reigns in every part of it. It resembles the voyage which is its subject. The adventures succeed one another, ( a wonderful objection ) and the poet has no other art, than to tell his tales well." Indeed! but the reader cannot now be surprised at any of our Critic's misrepresentations ---Though he has condemned the machinery of the Lusiad  UPON CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE NO PLACE IN IT, the mixture of Christian and Pagan mythology, which he in general ascribes to it, requires some attention. A short Dissertation on the poem is therefore necessary; and an examen of its conduct will clearly evince, that the Eneid itself is not more perfect than the Lusiad in that connection, which is requisite to form One whole, according to the strictest rules of Epic Unity. The term Epopoeia is derived from the Greek [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , discourse , and hence the Epic, may be rendered the narrative poem. In the full latitude of this definition some Italian critics have contended, that the poems of Dante and Ariosto were Epic. And in the same manner Telemachus and the Faerie Queen are Epic poems. A definition more restricted however, a definition descriptive of the noblest species of poetry, has been given by Aristotle; and the greatest critics have followed him, in appropriating to this species the term of Epopoeia, or Epic. The subject of the Epopoeia, according to that great father of criticism, must be One. One action must be invariably pursued, and heightened through different stages, till the Catastrophe close it in so complete a manner, that any farther addition would only inform the reader of what he already perceives. Yet in pursuing this One end, collateral Episodes not only give that variety so essential to good poetry, but, under judicious management, assist in the most pleasing manner to facilitate and produce the Unravelment, or Catastrophe. Thus the anger of Achilles is the subject of the Iliad. He withdraws his assistance from the Greeks. The efforts and distresses of the Grecian army in his absence, and the triumphs of Hector, are the consequences of his rage. In the utmost danger of the Greeks, he permits his friend Patroclus to go to battle. Patroclus is killed by Hector. Achilles, to revenge his fall, rushes to the field. Hector is killed, the Trojans defeated, and the rage of Achilles is soothed by the obsequies of his friend. And thus also the subject of the Eneid is One. The remains of the Trojan nation, to whom a seat of empire is promised by the oracle, are represented as endangered by a tempest at sea. They land at Carthage. Eneas, their leader, relates the fate of Troy to the hospitable queen; but is ordered by Jupiter to fulfil the prophecies, and go in search of the promised seat of that empire, which was one day to command the world. Eneas again sets sail, many adventures befal him. He at last lands in Italy, where prophecies of his arrival were acknowledged. His fated bride, however, is betrothed to Turnus. A war ensues, and the poem concludes with the death of the rival of Eneas. In both these great poems a machinery suitable to the allegorical religion of these times is preserved. Juno is the guardian of the Greeks, Venus of the Trojans. Narrative poetry without fiction can never please. Without fiction it must want the marvellous, which is the very soul of poesy; and hence a machinery is indispensible in the Epic poem. The conduct and machinery of the Lusiad are as follow: The poem opens with a view of the Portuguese fleet before a prosperous gale on the coast of Ethiopia. The crews, however, are worn with labour, and their safety depends upon their fortune in a friendly harbour. The Gods of ancient or poetical mythology are represented as in council. The fate of the Eastern world depends upon the success of the fleet. But as we trace the machinery of the Lusiad, let us remember that, like the machinery of Homer and Virgil, it is also allegorical. Jupiter, or the Lord of Fate, pronounces that the Lusians shall be prosperous. Bacchus, the evil d aemon or genius of Mohammedism, who was worshipped in the East, foreseeing that his empire and altars would be overturned, opposes Jove, or Fate. The celestial Venus, or heavenly Love, pleads for the Lusians. Mars, or divine Fortitude, encourages the Lord of Fate to remain unaltered; and Maia's son, the Messenger of Heaven, is sent to lead the navy to a friendly harbour. The fleet arrives at Mozambic. Bacchus, like Juno in the Eneid, raises a commotion against the Lusians. A battle ensues, and the victorious fleet pursue their voyage, under the care of a Moorish pilot, who advises them to enter the harbour of Quiloa. According to history they attempted this harbour, where their destruction would have been inevitable; but they were driven from it by the violence of a sudden tempest. The poet ascribes this to the celestial Venus. \---whose watchful care Had ever been their guide --- They now arrive at Mombassa. The malice of the evil daemon or genius of Mohammedism, still exites the arts of treachery against them. Hermes, the messenger of heaven, in a dream, in the style of Homer, warns the hero of the poem of his danger, and commands him to steer for Melinda. There he arrives, and is received by the prince in the most friendly manner. Here the hero receives the first certain intelligence or hope of India. The prince of Melinda's admiration of the fortitude and prowess of his guests, the first who had ever dared to pass the unknown ocean by the tempestuous Cape, artfully prepares the reader for a long episode. The poem of Virgil contains the history of the Roman empire to his own time. Camoens perceived this, and trod in his steps. The history of Portugal, which Gama relates to the king of Melinda, is not only necessary to give their new ally an high idea of the Lusian prowess and spirit, but also naturally leads to, and accounts for the voyage of Gama; the event, which in its consequences, sums up the Portuguese honours. It is as requisite for Gama to tell the rise of his nation to the king of Melinda, as it is for Eneas to relate to Dido the cause of his voyage, the destruction of Troy. And Gama's long account of his own voyage, will bear to be read after the similar parts of either the Odyssey or the Eneid. Pleased with the fame of their nation, the king of Melinda vows lasting friendship with the Lusians, and gives them a faithful pilot. As they sail across the great Indian ocean the machinery is again employed. The evil daemon implores Neptune and the powers of the sea to raise a tempest to destroy the fleet. The sailors on the night watch, fortify their courage by the valiant acts of their countrymen, and an episode in the true poetical spirit of chivalry is introduced. Thus Achilles in his tent is represented as singing to his lyre the praises of heroes. And in the Epic conduct, this narrative and the tales told by Nestor, either to restrain or inflame the rage of the Grecian chiefs, are certainly the same. The accumulation of the tempest in the meanwhile is finely described. It now descends. Celestial Venus perceives the danger of her fleet. She is introduced by the appearance of her star, a stroke of poetry which would have shined in the Eneid. The tempest is in its utmost rage, The sky and ocean blending, each on fire, Seem'd as all nature struggled to expire. When now the silver star of Love appear'd; Bright in her east her radiant front she rear'd; Fair through the horrid storm the gentle ray Announced the promise of the cheerful day. From her bright throne Celestial Love beheld The tempest burn--- And in the true spirit of Homer's allegory ( See the note , p. 266.) she calls her nymphs, and by their ministry stills the tempest. Gama now arrives in India. Every circumstance rises from the preceding one; and, as fully pointed out in the notes, the conduct in every circumstance is as exactly Virgilian, as any two tragedies may possibly be alike in adherence to the rules of the drama. Gama, having accomplished his purpose in India, sets sail for Europe, and the machinery is the last time employed. Venus, to reward her heroes, raises a Paradisaical island in the sea. Voltaire, in his English essay, has said, that no nation but the Portuguese and Italians could bear such lascivious description. In the French he has suppressed this sentence, but has compared it to a Dutch brothel allowed for the sailors. Yet this idea of it is as false as it is gross. Every thing in the island of Love resembles the statue of Venus de Medicis. The description is warm indeed, but it is chaste as the first loves of Adam and Eve in Milton. And so far from deserving the censure of Voltaire ( See the note , p. 394.) were Dante, Ariosto, Tasso, Spenser, and even Milton himself, to contend with him for the palm of modesty, there could be no hesitation in fixing it upon the brow of Camoens. After the poet has explained the allegory of the island of Love, the Goddess of the ocean gives her hand and commits her empire to Gama, whom she conducts to her palace, where, in a prophetic song, he hears the actions of the heroes who were to establish the Portuguese empire in the East. In Epic conduct nothing can be more masterly. The funeral games in honour of Patroclus, after the Iliad has turned upon its great hinge, the death of Hector, are here most happily imitated after the Lusiad has also turned upon its great hinge, the discovery of India. The conduct is the same, though not one feature is borrowed. Ulysses and Eneas are sent to visit the regions of the dead; and Voltaire's hero must also be conveyed to Hell and Heaven. But how superior is the spirit of Camoens! He parrallels these striking adventures by a new fiction of his own. Gama in the island of Bliss, and Eneas in Hell, are in Epic conduct exactly the same; and in this unborrowing sameness, he artfully interweaves the history of Portugal: artfully as Voltaire himself confesses. The episode with the king of Melinda, the description of the painted ensigns, and the prophetic song, are parallel in manner and purpose with the episode of Dido, the shield of Eneas, and the vision in Elysium. To revenge the rage of Achilles, and to lay the foundation of the Roman empire, are the grand purposes of the Iliad and Eneid; the one effected by the death of Hector; the other by the alliance of Latinus and Eneas, accomplished in the death of Turnus. In like manner, to establish the Portuguese Christian empire in the East, is the grand design of the Lusiad, accomplished in the happy return of Gama. And thus, in the true spirit of the Epopoeia, ends the Lusiad, a poem where every circumstance rises in just gradation, till the whole is summed up in the most perfect unity of Epic action. The machinery of Homer ( See the note , p. 266.) contains a most perfect and masterly allegory. To imitate the ancients was the prevailing taste when Camoens wrote; and their poetical manners were every where adopted. That he esteemed his own as allegorical he assures us in the end of the ninth book, and in one of his letters. But a proof even more determinate, occurs in the opening of the poem. Castera, the French Translator, by his over refinement, has much misrepresented the allegory of the Lusiad. Mars, who never appears but once in the first book, he tells us, signifies Jesus Christ. This explanation, so open to ridicule, is every way unnecessary, and surely never entered the thought of Camoens. It is evident, however, that he intended the guardian powers of Christianity and Mohammedism under the two principal personages of his machinery. Words cannot be plainer: Where'er this people should their empire raise, She knew her altars should unnumber'd blaze; And barbarous nations at her holy shrine Be humanised and taught her lore divine: Her spreading honours thus the one inspir'd, And one the dread to lose his worship fir'd. And the same idea is on every opportunity repeated and enforced. Pagan mythology had its Celestial, as well as Terrestrial Venus  80 . The Celestial Venus is therefore the most proper personage of that mythology to figure Christianity. And Bacchus, the conqueror of the East, is, in the ancient poetical allegory, the most natural protector of the altars of India. Whatever may be said against the use of the ancient machinery in a modern poem, candour must confess, that the allegory of Camoens which arms the genius of Mohammedism  81 against the expedition of his heroes, is both sublime and most happily interesting. Nor must his choice of the ancient poetical machinery be condemned without examination. It has been the language of poetry these three thousand years, and its allegory is perfectly understood. If not impossible, it will certainly be very difficult to find a new, or a better machinery for an Epic poem. That of Tasso is condemned by Boileau, yet, that of Camoens may plead the authority of that celebrated critic, and is even vindicated, undesignedly, by Voltaire himself. In an essay prefixed to his Henriade, Le mot d' Amphitrite , says he, dans notre poesie, ne signifie que la Mer, & non l'Epouse de Neptune \---the word Amphitrite in our poetry signifies only the Sea, and not the wife of Neptune." And why may not the word Venus in Camoens signify divine Love, and not the wife of Vulcan? "Love, says Voltaire, in the same essay, has his arrows, and Justice a ballance, in our most christian writings, in our paintings, in our tapestry, without being esteemed as the least mixture of Paganism." And if this criticism has justice in it, why not apply it to the Lusiad as well as the  82 Henriade? Candour will not only apply it to the Lusiad, but will also add the authority of Boileau. He is giving rules for an Epic poem: Dans le vaste r ecit d'une longue action, Se soutient par la fable, et vit de fiction. L a pour nous enchanter tout est mis en usage: Tout prend un corps, une ame, un esprit, un visage; Chaque vertu devient une divinit e; Minerve est la prudence, & Venus la beaute. Ce n'est plus la vapeur qui produit le tonnerre, C'est Jupiter arm e pour effrayer la terre. Un orage terrible aux yeux des matelots, C'est Neptune en courroux, qui gourmande les flots ... Sans tous ces ornemens le vers tombe en langueur; La poesie est morte, ou rampe sans vigueur: Le po ete n'est plus qu'un orateur timide, Qu'un froid historien d'une fable insipide. Every idea of these lines strongly defends the Lusiad. Yet, it must not be concealed, a distinction follows which may appear against it. Boileau requires a profane subject for the Epic Muse. But his reason for it is not just: De la foi d'un Chr etien les mysteres terribles D'ornemens egayes ne sont point susceptibles. L'evangile a l'esprit n'offre de tous cotes Que penitence a faire, & tourmens merites: Et de vos fictions le melange coupable M eme a ses verites donne l'air de la fable. The mysteres terribles afford indeed no subject for poetry. But the Bible offers to the Muse something besides penitence and merited torments . The Paradise Lost, and the works of the greatest Painters, evince this. Nor does this criticism, false as it is, contain one argument which excludes the heroes of a Christian nation from being the subject of poetry. Modern subjects are indeed condemned by Boileau, and ancient fable, with its Ulysses, Agamemnon, &c.--- noms heureux semblent n es pour les vers \---are recommended to the poet. But, happy for Camoens, his feelings directed him to another choice. For, in contradiction of a thousand Boileaus, no compositions are so miserably uninteresting as our modern poems, where the heroes of ancient fable are the personages of the action. Unless, therefore, the subject of Camoens  83 may thus seem condemned by the celebrated French critic, every other rule he proposes is in favour of the machinery of the Lusiad. For whatever report Falsehood and Voltaire may have raised against it, in the machinery there is no mixture of Pagan and Christian personages. The heroes, indeed, are Christians, and Santa Fe , holy faith, is sometimes mentioned. But the allegorical and historical parts of an Epic poem are essentially different, though the historical part be even often conducted under the veil of allegory; as, according to the precepts of Boileau, the deliverance of the Lusian fleet is ascribed to the celestial Venus. Nor is poetical use the only defence of our injured author. In the age of Camoens, Bacchus was esteemed a real  84 d aemon: And celestial Venus was considered as the name by which the Ethnics expressed the divine Love. But if the cold hyper-critic will still blame our author for his allegory, let it also be remembered, that of all Christian poets, Camoens is in this the least reprehensible. The Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise of Dante, form one continued texture of Pagan and Scriptural names, descriptions, and ideas. Ariosto is continually in the same fault; and in this, and his addition of Gothic inchantment, he is followed by Tasso. The Paradise Lost also has this mixture, in a manner not to be found in the Lusiad. And if it is a fault to use the ancient poetical machinery in a poem where the heroes are Christians, Voltaire himself has infinitely more of the melange coupable than Camoens. The machinery of his Henriade is, as confessed by himself, upon the idea of the Pagan mythology. He cites Boileau, C'est d'un scrupule vain s'allarmer sottement, Et vouloir aux lecteurs plaire sans agr ement Bien-tot ils defendront de peindre la prudence, De donner a Th emis ni bandeau, ni balance ... Et par-tout des discours, comme une idolatrie, Dans leur faux zele iront chasser l'allegorie. But he suppresses the verses which immediately follow, where the introduction of the true God is prohibited by the critic, Et fabuleux chr etiens, n'allons point dans nos songes, Du Dieu de v erite faire un Dieu de mensonges. Yet, the God of truth according to the Christian idea, in direct violation of this precept, is a considerable personage in the Pagan allegorical machinery of the Henriade. But the couplet last cited, though as direct against the Henriade as if it had been written to condemn it, is not in the least degree applicable to the machinery of the Lusiad; a machinery much less culpable, according to the severest criticism, than that of Tasso, and infinitely superior in every respect to that of  85 Voltaire, though Camoens wrote at the revival of learning, ere criticism had given her best rules to the modern Muse. The poem of Camoens, indeed, so fully vindicates itself, that this defence of it perhaps may seem unnecessary. Yet one consideration will vindicate this defence. The poem is written in a language unknown in polite literature. Few are able to judge of the Original, and the unjust clamour raised against it by Rapin  86 and Voltaire, has been received in Europe as its true character. Lord Kaimes 87 , and other authors, very cordially condemn its mixture of Pagan and Christian mythology; even condemn it in terms, as if the Lusiad, the poem which of all other modern ones is the most unexceptionable in this, were in this mixture the most egregiously unsufferable---Besides, whatever has the sanction of the celebrated name of Voltaire will be remembered, and unless circumstantially refuted, may one time perhaps  88 be appealed to, as decisive, in the controversies of literary  89 merit. Other views of the conduct of the Lusiad now offer themselves. Besides the above remarks, many observations on the machinery and poetical conduct, are in their proper places scattered throughout the notes. The exuberant exclamations of Camoens are there defended. Here let it only be added, that the unity of action is not interrupted by these Parentheses, and that if Milton's beautiful complaint of his blindness be not an imitation of them, it is in the same manner and spirit. Nor will we scruple to pronounce that such addresses to the Muse would have been admired in Homer, are an interesting improvement on the Epopoeia, and will certainly be imitated if ever the world shall behold another real Epic poem. The Lusiad, says Voltaire, contains a sort of Epic poetry unheard of before . No heroes are wounded a thousand different ways; no woman enticed away and the world overturned for her cause. \---But the very want of these, in place of supporting the objection intended by Voltaire, points out the happy judgment and peculiar excellence of Camoens. If Homer has given us all the fire and hurry of battles, he has also given us all the uninteresting tiresome detail. What reader but must be tired with the deaths of a thousand heroes, who are never mentioned before nor afterwards in the poem. Yet in every battle we are wearied out with such Gazette returns of the slain and wounded--- ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif)

II. Lib. XI. lin. 299. Thus imitated by Virgil, Caedicus Alcathoum obtruncat, Sacrator Hydaspem: Partheniumque Rapo, & Praedurum viribus Orsen: Messapus Cloniumque, Lycaoniumque Ericetem: Illum, infraenis equi lapsu tellure jacentem; Hunc, peditem pedes. Et Lycius processerat Agis, Quem tamen haud expers Valerus virtutis avitae Dejecit: Atronium Salius; Saliumque Nealces--- Æ n. l. x. 747. With such catalogues is every battle extended; and what can be more tiresome than such uninteresting descriptions and their imitations! If the idea of the battle be raised by such ennumeration, still the copy and original are so near each other, that they can never please in two separate poems. Nor are the greater parts of the battles of the Eneid much more distant from those of the Iliad. Though Virgil with great art has introduced a Camilla, a Pallas, and a Lausus, still in many particulars, and in the action upon the whole, there is such a sameness with the Iliad, that the learned reader of the Eneid is deprived of the pleasure inspired by originality. If the man of taste, however, will be pleased to mark how the genius of a Virgil has managed a war after a Homer, he will certainly be tired with a dozen of Epic poems in the fame style. Where the seige of a town and battles are the subject of an Epic, there will of necessity, in the characters and circumstances, be a resemblance to Homer; and such poem must therefore want originality. Happy for Tasso, the variation of manners, and his masterly superiority over Homer in describing his duels, has given his Jerusalem an air of novelty. Yet with all the difference between Christian and Pagan heroes, we have a Priam, an Agamamnon, an Achilles, &c. armies slaughtered, and a city besieged. In a word, we have a handsome copy of the Iliad in the Jerusalem Delivered. If some imitations, however, have been successful, how many others Epics of ancient and modern times have hurried down the stream of oblivion! Some of their authors had poetical merit, but the fault was in the choice of their subjects. So fully is the strife of war exhausted by Homer, that Virgil and Tasso could add to it but little novelty; no wonder, therefore, that so many Epics on battles and seiges have been suffered to sink into utter neglect. Camoens, perhaps, did not weigh these circumstances, but the strength of his poetical genius directed him. He could not but feel what it was to read Virgil after Homer; and the original turn and force of his mind led him from the beaten tract of Helen's and Lavinia's, Achilles's and Hector's, seiges and slaughters, where the hero hews down and drives to flight whole armies with his own sword. Camoens was the first who wooed the Modern Epic Muse, and she gave him the wreath of a first Lover: A sort of Epic Poetry unheard of before ; or, as Voltaire calls it in his last edition, une nouvelle esp ece d' Epopee . And the grandest subject it is (of profane history) which the world has ever beheld  90 A voyage esteemed too great for man to dare; the adventures of this voyage through unknown oceans deemed unnavigable; the Eastern World happily discovered, and for ever indissolubly joined and given to the Western; the grand Portuguese empire in the East founded; the humanization of mankind and universal commerce the consequence! What are the adventures of an old fabulous hero's arrival in Britain, what are Greece and Latium in arms for a woman, compared to this! Troy is in ashes, and even the Roman empire is no more. But the effects of the voyage, adventures, and bravery of the Hero of the Lusiad, will be felt and beheld, and perhaps increase in importance, while the world shall remain. Happy in his choice, happy also was the genius of Camoens in the method of pursuing his subject. He has not, like Tasso, given it a total appearance of fiction; nor has he, like Lucan, excluded allegory and poetical machinery. Whether he intended it or not, for his genius was sufficient to suggest its propriety, the judicious precept of Petronius is the model of the Lusiad. That elegant writer proposes a poem on the civil war; Ecce Belli Civilis , says he, ingens opus---Non enim res gest ae versibus comprehendendae sunt (quod longe melius historici faciunt) sed per ambages Deorumque ministeria, & fabulosum sententiarum tormentum praecipitandus est liber spiritus: ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides \--- No poem, ancient or modern, merits this character in any degree comparative to the Lusiad. A truth of history is preserved, yet, what is improper for the historian, the ministry of heaven is employed, and the free spirit of poetry throws itself into fictions, which makes the whole appear as an effusion of prophetic fury, and not like a rigid detail of facts given under the sanction of witnesses. Contrary to Lucan, who, in the above rules drawn from the nature of poetry, is severely condemned by Petronius, Camoens conducts his poem per ambages Deorumque ministeria . The apparition, which in the night hovers athwart the fleet near the Cape of Good Hope, is the grandest fiction in human composition; the invention his own! In the Island of Venus, the use of which fiction in an Epic poem is also his own, he has given the compleatest assemblage of all the flowers which have ever adorned the bowers of love. And never was the furentis animi vaticinatio , more conspicuously displayed than in the prophetic song, the view of the spheres, and of the globe of the earth. Tasso's imitation of the Island of Venus is not equal to the original; and though "Virgil's myrtles  91 dropping blood are nothing to Tasso's inchanted forest," what are all Ismeno's inchantments to the grandeur and horror of the appearance, prophecy, and evanishment of the spectre of Camoens!  92 \---It has been long agreed among the critics, that the solemnity of religious observances gives great dignity to the historical narrative of the Epopoeia. Camoens, in the embarkation of the fleet, and in several other places, is peculiarly happy in the dignity of the religious allusions. Manners and character are also required in the Epic poem. But all the Epics which have appeared, are, except two, mere copies of the Iliad in these. Every one has its Agamemnon, Achilles, Ajax, and Ulysses, its calm, furious, gross and intelligent hero. Camoens and Milton happily left this beaten tract, this exhausted field, and have given us pictures of manners unknown in the IIiad, the Eneid, and all those poems which may be classed with the Thebaid. The Lusiad abounds with pictures of manners, from those of the highest chivalry, to those of the rudest, fiercest, and most innocent barbarism. In the fifth, sixth, and ninth books, Leonardo and Veloso are painted in stronger colours than any of the inferior characters in Virgil. But striking character, indeed, is not the excellence of the Eneid. That of Monzaida, the friend of Gama, is much superior to that of Achates. The base, selfish, perfidious and cruel character of the Zamorim and the Moors, are painted in the strongest colours; and the character of Gama himself, is that of the finished hero. His cool command of his passions, his deep sagacity, his fixed intrepidity, his tenderness of heart, his manly piety, and his high enthusiasm in the love of his country, are all displayed in the superlative degree--- Let him who objects the want of character to the Lusiad, beware lest he stumble upon its praise; lest he only say, it wants an Achilles, a Hector, and a Priam. And to the novelty of the manners of the Lusiad let the novelty of fire-arms also be added. It has been said, that the buckler, the bow, and the spear, must continue the arms of poetry. Yet, however unsuccessful others may have been, Camoens has proved that fire-arms may be introduced with the greatest dignity and finest effect in the Epic Poem. As the grand interest of commerce and of mankind forms the subject of the Lusiad, so with great propriety, as necessary accompanyments to the voyage of his Hero, the Author has given poetical pictures of the four parts of the world. In the third book, a view of Europe; in the fifth, a view of Africa; and in the tenth, a picture of Asia and America. Homer and Virgil have been highly praised for their judgment in the choice of subjects which interested their countrymen, and Statius has been as severely condemned for his uninteresting choice. But though the subject of Camoens be particularly interesting to his countrymen, it has also the peculiar happiness to be the Poem of every trading nation. It is the Epic Poem of the Birth of Commerce. And in a particular manner the Epic Poem of whatever country has the controul and possession of the commerce of India. An unexhausted fertility and variety of poetical description, an unexhausted elevation of sentiment, and a constant tenor of the grand simplicity of diction, complete the character of the Lusiad of Camoens: A poem which, though it has hitherto received from the public most unmerited neglect, and from the critics most flagrant injustice, was yet better understood by the greatest poet of Italy. Tasso never did his judgement more credit, than when he confessed that he dreaded Camoens as a rival; or his generosity more honour, than when he addressed this elegant Sonnet to the Hero of the Lusiad: Vasco, le cui felici, ardite antenne In contro al sol, che ne riporta il giorno Spiegar le vele, e fer cola ritorno, Dove egli par che di cadere accenne: Non piu di te per aspro mar sostenne Quel, che fece al Ciclope oltraggio, e scorno: Ne chi turbo l'Arpie nel suo soggiorno, Ne die piu bel soggetto a colte penne. Et hor quella del colto, e buon' Luigi, Tant' oltre stende il glorioso volo Che i tuoi spalmati legni andar men lunge. Ond' a quelli, a cui s'alza il nostro polo, Et a chi ferma in contra i suoi vestigi, Per lui del corso tuo la fama aggiunge. Vasco, whose bold and happy bowsprit bore Against the rising morn; and, homeward fraught, Whose sails came westward with the day, and brought The wealth of India to thy native shore: Ne'er did the Greek such length of seas explore: The Greek, who sorrow to the Cyclop wrought, And he, who, Victor, with the Harpies fought, Never such pomp of naval honours wore. Great as thou art, and peerless in renown, Yet thou to Camoens ow'st thy noblest fame; Farther than thou didst sail, his deathless song Shall bear the dazzling splendor of thy name; And under many a sky thy actions crown, While Time and Fame together glide along. It only remains to give some account of the Version of the Lusiad, which is now offered to the Public. Besides the Translations mentioned in the life of Camoens, M. Duperron De Castera, in 1735, gave in French prose a loose unpoetical paraphrase  93 of the Lusiad. Nor does Sir Richard Fanshaw's English version, published during the usurpation of Cromwell, merit a better character. Though stanza be rendered for stanza, though at first view it has the appearance of being exceedingly literal, this version is nevertheless exceedingly unfaithful. Uncountenanced by his original, Fanshaw \--- teems with many a dead-born jest  94 . Nor had he the least idea of the dignity of the Epic  95 style, or of the true spirit of poetical translation. For this, indeed, no definite rule can be given. The Translator's feelings alone must direct him, for the spirit of poetry is sure to evaporate in literal translation. Literal translation of poetry is in reality a solecism. You may construe your author, indeed, but if with some Translators you boast that you have left your author to speak for himself, that you have neither added nor diminished, you have in reality grossly abused him, and deceived yourself. Your literal translation can have no claim to the original felicities of expression; the energy, elegance, and fire of the original poetry. It may bear indeed a resemblance, but such a one as a corps in the sepulchre bears to the former man when he moved in the bloom and vigour of life. Nec verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus Interpres--- was the taste of the Augustan age. None but a Poet can translate a Poet. The freedom which this precept gives, will, therefore, in a poet's hands, not only infuse the energy, elegance, and fire of his author's poetry into his own version, but will give it also the spirit of an original. He who can construe may perform all that is claimed by the literal Translator. He who attempts the manner of translation prescribed by Horace, ventures upon a task of genius. Yet however daring the undertaking, and however he may have failed in it, the Translator acknowledges, that in this spirit he endeavoured to give the Lusiad in English. Even farther liberties in one or two instances seemed to him advantageous--- But a minuteness  96 in the mention of these will not appear with a good grace in the first (perhaps last) Edition of his work: And the original is in the hands of the world. Though unwilling to enter into the controversy on the superiority of blank verse or rhyme, as the Translator has chosen the latter, he presumes it may not be improper to offer to the Reader the reasons which directed his choice. But he gives them not as decisive. He only confesses, that such is his taste ---In Shakespeare, and in the best parts of Otway and Southern, the English blank verse appears in great perfection and propriety. But this is of the Iambic or Dramatic kind, a kind very different from the Heroic. This, if not attainable, has never yet in perfection been attained in the English language; for certain it is, that in Milton, and every other writer of heroic blank verse, almost every four of five lines are interrupted with other two or three, which are absolute prose. Every objection against rhyme recurs with accumulated charge against blank heroics. The monotony of the Night Thoughts, The Seasons, and of Leonidas, is infinitely more tiresome than the sameness of Dryden and Pope. Unnatural distortion of language seems peculiar to blank verse. It is therefore a sure method to spoil the style and expression of youth, who, by the way, are generally its warmest advocates. That rhyme makes the poet walk in shackles is denied. He that feels it so, is forbidden by nature to write in verse; and let him obey the admonition, and presume not to dictate to others from his own feelings---Every advantage of imitative harmony, of running the lines into each other, is enjoyed by rhyme in as high a degree as blank verse. Other arguments in favour of rhyme, are founded on the nature of our language: The repetition of sound, unless murdered indeed in the reading, produces a short rest; and this rest fixes the numerousness of the ten syllables, which in blank heroics, when the lines run into each other, is often totally lost. For the ear seldom perceives, in this case, where the harmony of the line ends, and thence it necessarily becomes prosaic, and is therefore contrary to the genius of our language. And the numerousness thus produced by repetition of sound leads even to a greater advantage. Rhyme admits and delights in the most elegant ease both of the natural simplicity and force of expression. But blank heroics, alas!---Yet, peace to its admirers. These observations are not obtruded as criticisms, they are only offered as the reasons which induced the Translator to give the English Lusiad that dress, in which he has presented it to the Public. To his Subscribers the Translator begs leave to offer his most grateful acknowledgements of the honour they have done him. If the time of his publication exceed the period he at first proposed, the idea he then conceived, and his proposals , are also much exceeded by the Introduction and Notes which he found necessary to give. As he advanced in his undertaking, new views opened upon him, and to render his work as useful and as complete as he possibly could, was his first care. Nor is his thanks alone due to his Subscribers in general. Many of the most respectable names have honoured his Lusiad with their countenance, and have promoted its success. His list of subscribers will shew the respect that was paid to the opinion of some Gentlemen of the University of Oxford, who have interested themselves in its favour. And that his work may vindicate their good opinion, is not only his first ambition, but, if so happy, the best return he could possibly make them. ---The manner in which his Grace the Duke of Buccleugh took the English Lusiad under his patronage, infinitely inhanced the honour of his acceptance---To Governor Johnstone, whose ancestors have been the hereditary patrons of the ancestors of the Translator, he is under every obligation which the warmest zeal to promote the success of his undertaking can possibly confer. To this Gentleman, in a great measure, the appearance of the Lusiad in English is due.---To the Gentlemen of the East India Company, who are his Subscribers, the Translator offers his singular thanks; and with pleasure he assures them, that their desire to see an Epic Poem, particularly their own, in English, greatly encouraged him in the prosecution of his laborious work---To Thomas Pearson, Esq; of the East India Company's Service, he owes the assistance of some Portuguese Historians and other books, which have enabled him to elucidate his author. To this Gentleman he also owes the acknowledgement for a numerous list of Subscribers. But these, in themselves, he esteems the least of Major Pearson's favours. The manner of conferring them, and the continuance of his friendly wishes, cannot be repaid by the warmest acknowledgements ---To James Boswell, Esq; he confesses many obligations. To the friendship of Mr. Hoole, the elegant Translator of Tasso, he is peculiarly indebted.---And while thus he recollects with pleasure the names of many gentlemen from whom he has received assistance or encouragement; he is happy to be enabled to add Dr. Johnson to the number of those, whose kindness for the man, and good wishes for the Translation, call for his sincerest gratitude. Nor must a tribute to the memory of Dr. Goldsmith be neglected. He saw a part of this version; but he cannot now receive the thanks of the Translator. Neither must another circumstance, which he esteems so flattering an honour, be passed over in silence: Various specimens of this translation have been seen by Portuguese Literati, and the Translator has been favoured with their earnest desire to complete his undertaking. The ingenious Mr. Magellan, of the family of the celebrated Navigator, has been even an enthusiast in promoting its interest. By his means, some of the most respectable literary names of Portugal and of Paris have honoured his list. From Mr. Magellan and some other Portuguese gentlemen he has received considerable information on various parts of his subject. For these favours, and particularly for the honour they did him, in wishing him to be the Translator of the Poet of their nation, he returns them his most respectful thanks. Yet, though flattered with the approbation of some of those literary names, for whom the Public bear the greatest respect, Though he has introduced to the English Reader a Poem, truly Virgilian, the Translator confesses he has his fears for its fate. His execution---but no apology will supply the defects of elegance and poetical spirit; no apology shall therefore be offered. Yet whatever anxiety the conscience of his inability may give him, he also feels other considerations, which seem to authenticate his fears. We are not, indeed, in the condition of ancient Rome, when, in the declension of her literature, the Latin tongue was despised, and the Greek only admired. Yet, though a masterly treatise in some branches of literature would immediately receive the approbation due to merit, ere the just reputation of his poetry be fixed, an Author perhaps may be where the applause of the world cannot come. Long after Shakespeare wrote, and thirty years after the Paradise Lost was published, Shaftsbury pronounced that the English Muses were lisping in their cradles. And Temple, a much greater authority in poetical taste, esteems Sidney the greatest of all modern poets. Nor was his neglect of Milton singular. Even though that immortal Author's reputation be now fixed, I have known a learned gentleman who could not endure a line of the Paradise Lost, who yet, with seeming rapture, would repeat whole pages of Ovid. There is a charm in the sound of a language which is not debased by familiar use. And as it was in falling Rome, nothing in his vernacular tongue will be highly esteemed by the Scholar of dull taste. A work which claims poetical merit, while its reputation is unestablished, is beheld, by the great majority, with a cold and a jealous eye. The present age, indeed, is happily auspicious to Science and the Arts; but Poetry is neither the general taste nor the fashionable favourite of these times. Often, in the dispirited hour, have these views obtruded upon the Translator. Whilst he has left his Author upon the table and wandered in the fields, these views have cloathed themselves almost imperceptibly in the stanza and allegory of Spenser. Thus connected with the Translation of Camoens, unfinished as they are, they shall close the Introduction to the English Lusiad. Hence, vagrant Minstrel, from my thriving farm, Far hence, nor ween to shed thy poison here: My hinds despise thy lyre's ignoble charm; Seek in the Sloggard's bowers thy ill earn'd cheer: There while thy idle chaunting soothes their ear, The noxious thistle choaks their sickly corn; Their apple boughs, ungraff'd, sour wildings bear, And o'er the ill-fenced dales with fleeces torn Unguarded from the fox, their lambkins stray forlorn. Such ruin withers the neglected soil, When to the song the ill-starr'd swain attends. And well thy meed repays thy worthless toil; Upon thy houseless head pale want descends In bitter shower: And taunting scorn still rends, And wakes thee trembling from thy golden dream: In vetchy bed, or loathly dungeon ends Thy idled life---What fitter may beseem, Who poisons thus the fount, should drink the poison'd stream. And is it thus, the heart-stung Minstrel cry'd, While indignation shook his silver'd head, And is it thus, the gross-fed lordling's pride, And hind's base tongue the gentle Bard upbraid! And must the holy song be thus repaid By sun-bask'd ignorance, and chorlish scorn! While listless drooping in the languid shade Of cold neglect, the sacred Bard must mourn, Though in his hallowed breast heaven's purest ardours burn! Yet how sublime, O Bard, the dread behest, The awful trust to thee by heaven assign'd! 'Tis thine to humanise the savage breast, And form in Virtue's mould the youthful mind; Where lurks the latent spark of generous kind, 'Tis thine to bid the dormant ember blaze: Heroic rage with gentlest worth combin'd Wide through the land thy forming power displays. So spread the olive boughs beneath Dan Phoebus rays. When Heaven decreed to soothe the feuds that tore The wolf-eyed Barons, whose unletter'd rage Spurn'd the fair Muse, Heaven bade on Avon's shore A Shakespeare rise and soothe the barbarous age: A Shakespeare rose; the barbarous heats aswage--- At distance due how many bards attend! Enlarged and liberal from the narrow cage Of blinded zeal new manners wide extend, And o'er the generous breast the dews of heaven descend. And fits it you, ye sons of hallowed power, To hear, unmoved, the tongue of scorn upbraid The Muse neglected in her wintry bower, While proudly flourishing in princely shade Her younger sisters lift the laurel'd head--- And shall the pencil's boldest mimic rage, Or softest charms foredoom'd in time to fade, Shall these be vaunted o'er th' immortal page, Where passion's living fires burn unimpair'd by age! And shall the warbled strain of sweetest lyre, Thrilling the palace roof at night's deep hour; And shall the nightingales in woodland choir The voice of heaven in sweeter raptures pour! Ah no, their song is transient as the flower Of April morn: In vain the shepherd boy Sits listning in the silent Autumn bower; The year no more restores the short-lived joy, And never more his harp shall Orpheus' hands employ. Eternal Silence in her cold deaf ear Has closed his strain; deep as eternal night Has o'er Apelles' tints, so bright while-ere, Drawn her blank curtains---never to the sight More to be given---But cloath'd in heaven's own light Homer's bold painting shall immortal shine, Wide o'er the world shall ever sound the might, The raptured music of each deathless line, For death nor time may touch their living soul divine. And what the strain, though Perez swell the note, High though its rapture, to the Muse of fire! Yes, what the transient sounds, devoid of thought, To th' unabated flood of Shakespeare's ire, Or Milton's giant sway, till time expire Foredoom'd to live; as heaven's dread energy Unconscious of the bounds of place--- On the Machinery of Tasso's Jerusalem, and Voltaire's Henriade. Camoens, unheard, unread by the critics, has been represented to the world as the most extravagant, most absurd of all poets, in the injudicious profane mixture of Christian and Pagan ideas. The gross falsity of this charge we have fully detected. But justice to the reputation of my Author demands something farther. If the great Tasso be guilty of the fault injuriously ascribed to Camoens, and if his arch-accuser Voltaire has adopted a machinery infinitely less worthy of the Epic Muse, what must we think of the unjust condemnation of the poet of Portugal! The machinery of the Jerusalem is thus abridged: God sends the angel Gabriel to Godfrey: Gabriel announces him general by the will of heaven, and incites him to a vigorous prosecution of the war, to rescue the tomb of Christ from the Infidels. A magician, an apostate Christian, who could alarm Pluto in his own regions, Sin ne la regia sua Pluton spaventa--- and who still mixed some Christian rites with his profane incantations, advises Aladine king of Jerusalem to seize a statue of the Virgin and place it in his mosque, assuring him, that while it continued there, his spells should protect the city. The image is accordingly placed in the mosque, contrary to Mohammedan manners, from whence it miraculously disappears. The war commences. The foe of man, afterwards named Pluto, calls a council of the infernal powers. Polypheme, Gorgon, Cerberus,  &c. are here. Pluto relates his own fall from heaven, the birth of Christ, Christ's descent into hell, his rescue of captive souls; and then proposes to destroy the Christian army, particularly by the snares of love. Armida, a most beautiful enchantress, is sent by her uncle, the king of Damascus, who is also a magician, to delude the Christian chiefs. She arrives at the camp; pretends to be a dethroned princess, and begs assistance. The flower of the Christian warriors are eager to go with her: ten are appointed by lot, and many others follow her by stealth. These, like Circe, she enchants, and turns them into fishes. Beelzebub and Alecto are alternately introduced, as exciting the Infidels to treachery. God now sends the archangel Michael to drive the daemons from the battle. The magician Ismeno excites the Soldan Solyman against the Christians, and conveys him in an enchanted chariot to Jerusalem. The daemons, who had been driven by Michael to Acheron, are recalled by Ismeno, and ordered to take possession of a forest, from whence it was necessary for the Christians to cut timber to carry on the feige. Tancred, terrified by apparitions, desists from his attempt to cut down the forest. The hermit Peter pronounces that this service was decreed for Rinaldo, who is in the power of the enchantress Armida. Peter informs Ubald and Charles, that a Christian magician at Ascalon will assist them to relieve the hero from her inchantment. The episode of Armida, abounding in poetry, is now introduced. Rinaldo is relieved, and the enchanted forest by him cut down. The poem now draws to the hurry of conclusion. The wall of Jerusalem is assailed; Ismeno and two other magicians, in defence of the Infidels, endeavour to change the course of nature with their inchantments, Ritentar volle l' arti sue fallaci Per sforzar la natura--- And the arch-angel Michael appears to Godfrey, to whom he shews the souls of the Christian heroes who had fallen in the war still fighting under his banners, and the host of heaven ready to oppose the enemy. The assault is successful. The Insidel chiefs are killed by different Christian heroes. Armida, who fought in the Egyptian army, submits to Rinaldo, and Godfrey is completely victorious. Such is the machinery of a poem, universally and justly admired. Yet whatever praise is due to the grandeur of Gothic inchantment, the opposition of it to the arch-angel Michael, the immediate messenger of God, carries in it a something which must displease. No popular belief of the power of magic will palliate the disgust of the sensible reader. Had the hermit Peter, who is represented as a prophet, worked miracles, such as abound in the monkish legends; these, the objects of firm popular belief, with greater propriety and even more poetry might have opposed the power of infernal magicians. But as the machinery stands in Tasso, that of Camoens, which is purely the well known allegory of poetry, is infinitely less culpable in the mixture of ideas. As the machinery of the Henriade cannot be traced without a view of the whole action of the poem, a dissection of the whole shall be accurately given. It has been said, that the French language is incapable of Epic dignity. The Henriade proves the justice of this observation. The Reader, who is acquainted with Virgil, must perceive the miserable comparative poverty of the Henriade; he will also observe, that the following citations are made in examination of the machinery, and not selected with a view to the want of Epic dignity. The action of the Henriade is founded on French history. Soon after the horrid massacre of Paris, an association against the protestants was formed under the Duke of Guise. The power of this association, called the Holy League, began to give uneasiness to Henry III. a weak dissipated prince, and Guise, by his order, was assassinated. The League, however, became more formidable, and Henry was driven from his capital. He implored the assistance of his former enemy, Henry of Navarre, the head of the protestant party. While the two kings assailed Paris, Henry III. was stabbed by a young friar, and Henry of Navarre, the legal heir of the crown, continued the siege. Paris, though reduced to the most dreadful extremities of famine, still held out, till Henry, perceiving the unalterable hatred which the League bore to his religion, abjured the protestant doctrine, and Paris opened her gates and received him with joy. And thus, says Voltaire, in his English introduction to the Henriade, (omitted in his French copies) "What his valour and magnanimity could never bring about, was easily obtained by going to mass, and by receiving absolution of the Pope." However bold it may seem to condemn this subject as unworthy of the Epic Muse, there needs no argument to prove it infinitely inferior to that of the Lusiad. In dignity and conduct Camoens is every where Virgilian: Voltaire shall speak for himself. The state of France, at the commencement of the action, is thus described: Les loix etaient sans force, et les droits confondus, Ou plut ot en effet Valois ne regnait plus--- On voyait dans Paris la Discorde inhumaine Excitant aux combats, & la Ligue & Mayene--- Ce monstre imp etueux, sanguinaire, inflexible, De ses propres sujets est l' ennemi terrible. In the machinery which is now introduced, the soul of St. Louis acts the part of Venus in the Enead. From the height of the heavens he beholds and protects Henry of Navarre, but he conceals the arm which he spreads to guard him, left the hero, too sure of victory, and with less danger, should acquire less glory. The lines are these: frigid indeed! Le P ere de Bourbons, du sein des immortels, Lou is, fixait sur lui ses regards paternels--- Mais Henri s'avan çait vers sa grandeur supreme, Par des chemins secrets, inconnus a lui m eme: Lou is du haut de cieux lui pretait son appui; Mais il cachait le bras qu'il etendait pour lui, De peur que ce h eros, trop sur de sa victoire, Avec moins de danger n'e ut acquis moins de gloire. Having thus introduced the reader to the leading personage of the machinery, Paris is besieged by the two kings, we are told, and the daemon of carnage has carried his rage from sea of sea. The action now commences, Henry III. of the house of Valois, deplores his situation to Henry of Navarre, tells him that the papal thunders are issued against him, and that Spain is about to send auxiliaries to the League. He therefore entreats him to go to England to solicit an army to assist them. Henry then sails from Dieppe. L'imp etueux Boree, enchaine dans les airs, Au soufle de Z ephyre abandonnoit les mers. Then comes a storm, in very common place description, in which Henry thought of nothing but the evils of his country; Ne songe en ce danger qu'aux maux de sa patrie. Then the God of the Universe commands the storm to carry the vessel to the isle of Jersey. Here the hero lands and finds a venerable old man, who sought peace far from the court, loin de la cour , and God, it seems, had sent Wisdom to open the book of Fate to this same hermit; Ce Dieu qu'il adorait, prit soin de sa vieillesse, Il fit dans son d esert descendre la Sagesse; Et prodigue envers lui de ses tresors divins, Il ouvrit a ses yieux le livre de Deslins. And here Mornay, the Calvinist friend of Henry, who Pr etait au Calvinisme un appui redoutable--- and the hermit, hold a discourse upon theology, in which the old prophet execrates Calvinism, and foretells, that a worship so new, could not always continue; Un culte si nouveau ne peut durer toujours. Des caprices de l'homme il a tir e son etre: On le verra p erir ainsi qu'on la vu naitre. The hermit then prophesies, that Henry should turn papist and be king. An idle declamation on the English, who are unfit either to be slaves or freemen, Qui ne peut ni servir, ni vivre en libert e\--- and the character of Elizabeth, who chained destiny at her feet, and astonished the world with the eclat of her reign, Une femme a ses pieds enchainant les destins, De l' eclat de son regne etonnait les humains \--- conclude the interview with the hermit of Jersey; an episode of no use in the conduct of the poem, and a dull imitation of the part acted by the hermit Peter in Tasso. What strange fancy , says Voltaire in his English critique on The Jerusalem , to send Ubaldo and his companion to an holy conjurer." Yet this part in Tasso is not only conducted in the true spirit of the grand machinery of Gothic enchantment, a machinery proper to the age of his heroes, but is also intimately connected with the catastrophe of the poem. But in no circumstance does this defence of Tasso plead for Voltaire. Henry is now introduced to the queen of England, who with impatience demands an account of the troubles of France: Elizabeth alors avec impatience, Demande le r ecit des troubles de la France, Veut savoir quels ressorts, & quel enchainement Ont produit dans Paris un si grand changement. The massacre of Paris is now related, with several digressive observations on tyranny, without either force or novelty, and after a long t ete a tete on laws and liberty, &c. &c. Elizabeth allows the Earl of Essex and a thousand English youth to accompany Henry, whom she desmisses in the true spirit of petit maiterism . Of her troops, she says; Au milieu des combats vous les verrez courir Plus pour vous imiter que pour vous secourir. Form es par votre exemple au grand art de la guerre, Ils apprendront sous vous a servir l' Angleterre--- i.e. In the midst of battles you shall see them hasten more to imitate you than to help you. Formed by your example in the great art of war, they shall learn under you to serve England." And himself she politely compliments, as only worthy to talk of himself; Vous seul pouvez parler dignement de vous-m eme. And thus ends in mere bagatelle the embassy which ought to have been of the utmost importance throughout the Poem. The embassy of king Latinus to Diomed, and the journey of Eneas to king Evander, are with admirable art worked into the great action of the Eneid. The resusal of Diomed to make war against Eneas, greatly heightens the character of the hero. The absence and return of Eneas are both most happily interesting, and the fate of his new friend and auxiliary, the son of Evander, gives the highest importance to the journey of the hero, by constituting a principal part of the action and catastrophe of the Eneid. In the Henriade every thing is different. The hero leaves the siege of Paris, hears the effusions of monkish bigotry poured forth by a hermit at the isle of Jersey, comes to London, and in the true style of coffee-house politicians, has a long talk with queen Elizabeth. The earl of Essex, it is true, and thousand a of the English youth accompany him to France; but there is not one circumstance performed by them, which even gives a colour of importance to this embassy of the hero of the Henriade. In his first editions, Voltaire twice mentions the English, but nothing particular is ascribed to them: and so little did he regard the spirit of Virgil in the part of Pallas, that in his last edition, the English auxiliaries are only once mentioned as in battle, and that in a manner utterly uninteresting, of no consequence to the conduct of the poem. Henry's journey to England, therefore, is in direct contradiction to that great rule of the Epopaeia, which requires unity of action; or in other words, which demands that every circumstance should conduce, according to its degree, to the completion of the whole. In the fourth book, at last, some business commences. D'Aumale in the night attacks the besiegers. Henry arrives, and turns the fortune of war, not as a modern general, but as an Achilles or Eneas, who drove whole squadrons before their single swords. But not a word is here mentioned of the help of his English auxiliaries. Now the machinery takes place. D'Aumale is in danger of being killed; but Discorde saw it, La Discorde le vit, & trembla pour d'Aumale--- Elle s' eleve en l'air, & vole a son secours. Then covering him with her iron immense impenetrable buckler, this fille de l'Enfer , daughter of hell, carries him to the gates of Paris, where she cures him of the wounds, which he had never felt; Sanglant, couvert de coups qu'il n'avait point sentis. Elle applique a ses maux une main salutaire \--- Then Discorde comforts Mayenne, the chief of the League, who is in great distress. She then flies in a whirlwind to Rome, which is described in the true spirit of declamation. La Politique is found in the Vatican, Au fond du Vatican r egnait la Politique \--- Discorde and she embrace each other. Politique laments that she could not now from the Vatican lance her thunders and rule the world. She complains that the Senate of France had unmasked her, and agrees with Discorde to resume their lost power. Humble Religion, in the meanwhile, is in a desert far from the pomp of Rome, sighing for the day when Henry was to embrace popery and revenge her altars. La Politique and Discorde seize upon Humble Religion, and God, to try her, gives her up to their fury, Son Dieu pour l' eprouver la livre a leurs fureurs. They strip her of her sacred vestments, and having covered their own impure heads with them, they go to Paris to accomplish their designs. La Politique gets into the Sorbonne and corrupts the doctors; to some he offers the Mitre, Par l' eclat d'une Mitre elle ebluit leur vue--- and others she intimidates. Truth flies away weeping, and an old man of the Sorbonne speaks for his brethren, "The church has the power to dethrone kings; we are the church, and we dethrone Valois. Oaths, hitherto sacred, we break your chain." Scarce had he spoke, when Discorde wrote the odious decree in blood, and Chacun jure par elle, & signe sous ses yeux. Now in the habit of an Augustin, and now in the frock of a Franciscan, she flies from church to church, calls herself Religion, and excites to the most dreadful massacres. Then she makes Sixteen of the heads of the faction (whose names may be seen in the notes to the Geneva edition) ride beside her in her bloody chariot; and Pride, Treason, Fury, and Death, march before them in streams of blood. During the management of this machinery, our Author talks of Christ, the church, and the children of Israel; he now talks of the heathen goddess Themis. She resisteth the general contagion, La soif de s' agrandir, la crainte, l'esp erance, Rien n'avait dans ses mains fait pancher sa balance; Son temple elait sans tache \--- In this temple of Themis sat a venerable senate, propitious to innocence, dreadful to guilt, Il etait dans ce temple un S enat venerable, Propice a innocence, au crime redoutable \--- Then the tyrants of the League lay siege to this temple, Des tyrans de la Ligue une affreuse cohorte, Du temple de Th emis environne la porte. A vile gladiator then bullies the Senate, and by the help of the Sixteen, sends them in chains to the Bastile. Clement, a young Dominican friar, longs to kill Henry of Valois, the king. He prays, and is heard by Discorde, who instantly flies to Hell in search of Fanaticism , Le plus cruel tyran de l'empire des ombres. Which goddess, our Poet tells us, was the author of the sacrifices of Moloc, of Jephtha's vow, of the death of Agamemnon's daughter, of the human sacrifices offered by the priests of the Teutates, and by the Druids; and of the first persecution of the Christians at Rome. Afterward, he adds, she passed to the church and made the Christians persecute each other; was the cause of the death of Charles I. at London, and established the inquisition at Madrid and Lisbon, on purpose to burn the Jews. This Goddess, cloathed in the habit of which she had plundered Humble Religion, appears to Clement in a dream, encourages him by the example of Judith to assassinate the king, and giving him a sword, flies to her infernal abode. The Sixteen heads of the faction are next represented at a magical sacrifice, enquiring after the decrees of Fate. It is midnight. They have an altar on a tomb, where they place the images of the two kings, Henry of Valois, and Henry of Bourbon or Navarre, Leurs sacril eges mains ont mele sur l'autel, A des noms infernaux, le nom de l'Eternel. Their lances are ranged along the walls with their points in vessels of blood, and they have a Jew for their priest, Leurs parricides bras se lavent dans le sang; De Valois sur l'autel ils vont percer le flanc; Avec plus de terreur, & plus encor de rage De Henri sous leurs pieds ils renversent l'image--- L'Hebrew joint cependant la priere au blasph eme; [illeg.], & [illeg.], [illeg.], Et le feu de la foudre & celui des Enfers. While the Sixteen wait for the oracular response, Heaven, to punish them, consents to give a true one. Sudden lightnings flash, and Henry of Bourbon appears riding in the chariot of victory, Au milieu de ces feux, Henri brillant de gloire, Apparait a leurs yeux sur un char de victoire ... Et le sceptre des Rois eclatait dans sa main. Thunder then overturns the altar and disperses the sacrificers; but Clement, nevertheless, stabs Valois---In Ariosto, Discord is found in a monastery. This, and the part she acts, are copied by Voltaire. The magical sacrifice in Camoens is also imitated. But though the machinery of Discord, Fanaticism, &c. in the Henriade be destitute of poetical novelty, it is strongly marked with an originality of another kind. The allegorical personages are dressed, and act, in the very bagatelle of conceit and quaintness. Jephtha's Vow, the Death of king Charles the First, and the other exploits ascribed to Fanaticism, are in a strange spirit of Je ne scai quoi , knick-knack, or school-boy composition: in that spirit, perhaps, which Shaftesbury intended, when he condemned the great Milton for his want of the fashionable turn of modern wit . In the Orlando Furioso, a poem much in the spirit of Don Quixote, satyrical quaintness and conceit, indeed, are in their proper place; but the quaint attempts of wit, that mere punning in poetical painting, with which Voltaire draws his Politique, Fanaticism,  &c. are utterly inconsistent with Epic solemnity ---But to return to the progress of the Henriade: A long debate ensues in Paris of the choice of a king. Henry and the army attack the city, and are on the point of forcing their way into the gates, when St. Louis appears, \---du profond d'une nue Un fant ome eclatant se presente a sa vue. and orders Henry to stop; tells him he was St. Louis, the father of the Bourbons, his protector and sire, reproves him for deserting the faith, and foretells his advancement to the throne. Thrice Henry tries to embrace the shade of his father, but in vain. He then, as commanded, leaves the seige and marches of Vincennes. And thus all the great and just designs of the war, are absurdly set aside, to make room for a piece of [illeg.] in direct imitation of Homer and Virgil. The difference of conduct, however, must be observed. Ulysses and Eneas, in great distress and uncertainty, are desirous to consult the fates, and are favoured with a view of the regions of the dead, according to the mythology of their age. By these interviews their distresses are alleviated, and their future conduct is formed. And thus the unity of each poem is admirably preserved. Henry, on the contrary, is absurdly driven from complete victory, to be carried through heaven and hell, though his advancement to the throne, the only part of the vision connected with the interest of the poem, had been already twice foretold. And thus the Liaison , or connection of operations necessary in an Epic Poem, is grosly violated in the conduct of the Henriade. No less inferior to the solemn horror of the Odyssey, and sublime poetry of the Eneid, where the regions of the dead are described, is the poetical colouring of the vision of Henry. This will soon appear. While he remains at Vincennes, whither he fled from victory, and to do what no critic can possibly guess, St. Louis sends Sleep and Hope to comfort him. The Saint appears to him in a dream, crowns him, and placeing him beside himself in a chariot of light, they traverse the heavens together; Lou is en ce moment prenant son diademe Sur le front du vainqueur il le posa lui-meme:--- L'un & l'autre a ces mots dans un char de lumiere Des Cieux en un moment traversent la carri ere. Then passing the sun we have a view of the worlds around him, according to the Newtonian system, in poetical colouring a very poor imitation of the Ptolemaic, as described in Camoens  97 . Henry passes, A des mondes divers autour de lui flottans \--- Then they come to space, O u la matiere nage, & que Dieu seul embrasse, Sont de Soleils sans nombre, & des mondes sans fin. He then comes, where the ghosts of Brahmins, Bonzes, Monks, wild Americans and Mohammedans, wait the hour of judgment. Here he makes a speech of twelve lines on the salvation of Heathens and Christians. A voice, which shakes the heavens and makes the universe groan, answers from the throne of God. Henry is then carried by a whirlwind to an abode, the abominable image of Chaos; Vers un s ejour informe, aride, affreux, sauvage, De l'antique Cahos abominable image. Hell is now described, where they see the assassin Clement. Then comes and Elyzium, where St. Louis presides over Charlemagne and other kings and heroes of France. The palace of Destiny then opens its hundred brass gates, and Henry is reproved by St. Louis his guide, for being a protestant. And after having seen some of the great men of France, who were then unborn, the hero awakes; and thus closes a most servile uninventive imitation of the sixth Eneid. Yet, uninventive as it is, original in nothing but the extravagance about the salvation of Bonzes and Bramins, Marmontel has not scrupled to pronounce it, " vaut seul toute l'Iliade , worth alone all the Iliad." Hitherto has the Henriade been without Liaison . The real action has, like a wounded snake, dragg'd its slow length along . But some business is now resumed. The eighth book opens with the confusion of the Leaguers, who neither durst degrade nor crown Mayenne; when Discorde, bursting from a cloud, appears in a luminous chariot, and inspires their courage; La Discorde a l'instant entr'ouvrant une nue, Sur un char lumineux se pr esente a leur vue, Courage, leur dit elle--- The Spaniards under Egmont, and the Leaguers under Mayenne prepare for war. Henry advances to the plains of Ivry. Discorde blows her infernal trumpet to animate the Leaguers, Elle vole a leur tete, et sa bouche fatale Fait retentir au loin sa trompette insernale. Par ces sons trop connus d'Aumale est excit e, Aussi prompt que le trait dans les airs emport e. This battle is well described, but without originality. Mayenne and the Leaguers are defeated. St. Louis, surrounded with the souls of the other Bourbons, form the height of the firmament observes how Henry will use his victory. \--- du haut de firmament Vint contempler Henri dans ce fameux moment. and the result of the battle is like a newspaper in verse. Discorde goes now to find out Love. And the ninth book opens with a description of his temple. A description, where one might have expected original poetry from the genius of Voltaire. But every thing is contrary here. The descriptive part is most hackneyed common place; every expression of it may be selected from Cowley's poems. Darts, flames, sighs, tears, rapture and misery, are hustled together, and then strung in verse without gradation, without novelty. The reader is entreated to compare the Temple of Love in Dryden's Palemon and Arcite with that in the Henriade; and he is promised that he will find them as different as mere versification is from real poetry. But to return to the fable of the Henriade. Love, who by the bye is Discord's brother, makes a long speech about Hercules and Cleopatra. He then flies over Troy, and other places most famous in the classics, and arrives at last at Ivry. He beholds the camp as his prey, and feels an inhuman joy, L'Amour sent a sa vue une joie inhumaine. In imitation of Virgil, a strom is raised, which drives Henry to the Chateau of the celebrated Madam D'Estree, where Sa vertu l'abandonne, & son ame enyvree N'aime, ne voit, n'entend, ne conna it que d'Estree. his virtue abandons him, and his intoxicated soul loves, sees, hears, and knows nothing but d'Estree." The danger of d'Estree's virtue, a poor subaltern's daughter, is thus pompously bewailed: Contre un pouvoir si grandqu'e ut pu saire d'Estree? Par un charme indomtable elle etait attiree; Elle avait a combattre, en ce funeste jour, Sa jeunesse, son c aeur, un Heros, & l'Amour! i.e. Against so great power what could d'Estr ee do? By an irresistible charm she was attracted; in that fatal day she had to combat her youth, her heart, a hero, and Love! The French, indeed, may admire this. No nation but themselves, however, could bear such impertinence. What would be thought of an English writer, who would describe the first meeting of Charles II. and Nell Gwynne, or Louis XV. and Pompadour, as an incident worthy of Epic dignity? The episode to Dido affords no defence for this parody upon it. A fugitive prince, married to the queen of a powerful state, is as different in Epic grandeur from the amour of Henry with a Subaltern's daughter, as are the manners of the age of Eneas from those of the days of the French Hero; as different as the true dignity of Virgil is from the French complaisance and mock dignity of Madam d'Estr ee. During the amour of Henry all is in danger; the camp is all licentiousness, O u du soldat vainqueur s'emporte l'insolence--- But St. Louis sends the genius of France to put this to rights. The genius employs Mornay, the Calvinist, to rescue Henry from the snares of Love. And this, says the poet, was to instruct us that reason was often sufficient to guide us, and thus Marcus Aurelius and Plato are a disgrace to Christians; Il's'addresse a Mornay, c' etait pour nous instruire, Que souvent la raison suffit a nous conduire; Ainsi qu' elle guida chez des peuples Payens Marc-Aur ele, ou Platon, la honte des Chretiens. Love, however, is very angry at this choice, but Mornay despises his rage and his charms, Mais Mornay m eprisait sa colere, & ses charmes. Discorde, in the meanwhile, irritates the Leaguers. Mornay finds the king and his mistress. The king, ashamed, leaves d'Estree and attacks Paris. The battle of Ivry, the best part of the whole poem, is now described, but is as like Tasso, as the closest imitations of Virgil resemble Homer. In book X. Henry returns to the siege, is just on the point of taking the city, when the angel of France stops him, Quand l'Ange de la France, appaisant son couroux, Retint son bras vainqueur, & suspendit ses coups. A duel, in imitation of Homer, Virgil and Tasso, between d'Aumale and Turenne, is now described. This is greatly admired in France, and is perhaps the first of the Henriade in true merit; but it is also a close copy, and much inferior to the duels of Tasso. A black cloud, during this combat, vomits the monsters of hell over Paris, Cependant sur Paris s' elevait un nuage, Qui semblait apporter le tonnerre & l'orage; Ses flancs noirs & brulans tout-a-coup entr'ouverts, Vomissent dans ces lieux les monstres des Enfers. Fanaticism, Discorde, and dark Politique with false heart and squint eye, La sombre Politique, au c aeur faux, & l'aeil louche--- And the daemon of battles, Dieux enyvr es de sang, Dieux dignes xsdes Ligueurs--- all fly to the aid of d'Aumale. But the height of the heavens opens, and an Angel descends on the throne of the air, with the olive of peace in one hand, and the sword of God's vengeance in the other; Voil a qu'au meme instant, du haut de cieux ouverts, Un Ange est descendu sur le tr one des airs , The infernal monsters are dismayed; then Paris, le Roi, l'Arm ee, & l' Enfer, & les Cieux, Sur ce combat illustre avaient fix e les yeux--- Paris, the king, the army, hell and heaven fix their eyes on the illustrious fight." d'Aumale falls, the monsters of hell groan, and voices are heard in the air, Ces lugubres accens dans les airs s'entendirent--- acknowledging that their reign is past. The army of Henry demand leave to assail the city, but St. Louis will not allow it, and Henry acts upon a sentiment very unworthy of an Epic poem. He chuses rather to reduce the city by famine, as a method more powerful than his arms, Ilcrut que sans assauts, sans combats, sans allarmes, La disette & la faim, plus fortes que ses armes, Lui livreraient sans peine un peuple inanim e. The horrors of famine are now described in lively colours, but too shocking to incite any one to a second reading. The besieged are willing to submit, and Henry promises forgiveness and mercy. But the priests tell them that they are the soldiers of God, and that a tyrant heretic will not keep his word. And by the priests they are ordered to defend their temples from his heresy, Sauvons nos temples saints de son culte b eretique. What now is to be done? The faction are again outrageous, and the besieged may eat one another, nay, as both history and the poem tell us, may open the graves in the church-yards for food  98 ; but St. Louis will not allow Henry to take the city by force. What must be done in this most admirable \--- dignus vindice nodus ? why truly St. Louis must take the business upon himself. The throne of God is now described in twenty-four lines, and here St. Louis approaches, Le p ere de Bourbons a ses yeux se presente, Et lui parle en ces mots d'une voix g emissante. In his speech he tells the Almighty, that if the French disobeyed the laws of heaven, it was on purpose to obey them; for that his son, the grand Henri , their lawful king, was an heretic. His conversion is therefore implored. Of this, the Eternal, by a word of his mouth, assures St. Louis, Par un mot de sa bouche il daigna l'assurer. Truth then descends from the height of the heavens to the hero's tents, Dans les tentes du Roi, descend du haut des cieux. Henry then turns Roman Catholic, and believes in the doctrine of Transubstantiation; for Truth, \--- lui d ecouvre un Dieu sous un pain, qui n'est plus. Then St. Louis, with an olive bough in his hand, descends from the height of the heavens, and leads Henry to the ramparts of Paris, which open at his call, and receive him in the name of God: Lou is dans ce moment, qui comble ses souhaits, Lou is tenant en main l'olive de la paix, Descend du haut du Cieux vers les H eros qu'il aime; Aux remparts de Paris il le conduit lui-m eme; Les remparts ebranles s'entr'ouvrent a sa voix; Il entre au nom de Dieu, qui fait regner les Rois. And thus ends the Henriade; a poem in every respect unworthy of the name of Epic. Every reader who has an ear must perceive how distant from the dignity of Virgil are French heroics, even in the hands of Voltaire  99 . The conduct of the fable is not Epic, for it is not One . The catastrophe has not the least dependance upon the long episode of the journey to England, though this episode is almost one third of the whole poem. In the action there is no gradation. Henry vanquishes his foes, but St. Louis will not allow him to reap the fruits of victory. Nothing therefore results from the real action, but contrary to Homer and Virgil, All is left to the machinery. After the long tale which Henry tells Elizabeth, the real action or fable would fill but a few pages; five parts of six are machinery, a machinery the most ridiculous and puerile ever adopted by the heroes of the Lutrin . If any French critic be offended at this, let him renounce his admiration of Boileau, by whom the machinery of the Henriade, as already observed, is as severely condemned, as if he had written his celebrated critique on Epic poetry on purpose to condemn it. However superior Voltaire may be in the other walks of poetry, certain it is, no originality, no strength of colouring, shines in the Henriade. The following lines, said of Mornay, are admired in France as the finest sublime, Mais il ne permet pas a ses stoiques mains De se souiller du sang des malheureux humains. De son Roi seulement son ame est occup ee: Pour sa d efense seule il a tire l'epee; Et son rare courage, ennemi des combats, Sait affronter la mort, & ne la donne pas. But surely that cannot be the true sublime which contains the true absurd. Mornay will not stain his hands with human blood. He is only anxious to defend his king, for his defence only he draws his sword. "His rare courage, enemy to battles, knows how to dare death but not to give it;" that is, Mornay is earnest to defend his king, but he will kill no body in his defence. In the heat of battle he only parries the swords which attack him. The enemy may return to the charge in a moment; three or four swords may attack the king at a time, but Mornay will not lessen their number or prevent a second attack. A most excellent method, indeed, to defend one's sovereign! Yet such is the most admired beauty in the Henriade  100 !---Mr. Locke was highly pleased with the epic poems of Blackmore: And there are a race of critics, of Mr. Locke's taste, who admire the Henriade, who call it All Sense , who are pleased with Discorde in her chariot, and La Politique, sometimes in one monk's frock, and sometimes in another, they very Dutch style of painting; but who yet decry the grand personnifications of Milton's angels, as the most absurd and bizarre extravagance. Nor is their resemblance to Locke's taste less remarkable, than the likeness between Blackmore's Arthurs and the Henriade. That sense which is admired in the French poem, abounds in the Arthurs. In their machinery of Angels and Souls is a striking likeness; the same strain of common place description, the same round of servile imitations, the same idle pretences to moderation in theology, and same want of poetical novelty, characterise the Henriade and the Ten epic poems of Blackmore. To constitute a poem worthy of the name of Epic in the strictest and highest sense, some grand characteristics of subject and conduct, peculiarly its own, are absolutely necessary. Of all the moderns, Camoens and Milton have alone attained this grand peculiarity in an eminent degree. Tasso has something of it, but Voltatre has not the least claim to this essential constituent of a real Epic. In a word, let our coldblooded critics admire him as they please, the total want of originality, both in the circumstances and poetical colouring, the want of that connection and gradation necessary to the Epic unity; the deficiency of grandeur, the idle spirit of theological nibbling about Plato, Bramins, and Bonzes, which runs through the whole; and Such a machinery , all combine to vindicate the man who is bold enough to pronounce that France has as yet to Epic poem, though Voltaire has written the Henriade.
