 that diuerse Scholers of Eaton, be runne awaie from  1 the Schole, for feare of beating. Whereupon, M. Secretarie tooke occasion, to wishe, that some more disdretion were in many Scholemasters, in vsing correction, than commonlie there is. Who many times, punishe rather, the weakenes of nature, than the fault of the Scholer. Whereby, many Scholers, that might else proue well, be driuen to hate learning, before they knowe, what learning meaneth: and so, are made willing to forsake their booke, and be glad to be put to any other kinde of liuing. 2 M. Peter , as one somewhat seuere of nature, said plainlie, that the Rodde onelie, was the sworde, that must keepe, the Schole in obedience, and the Scholer in  3 good order. M. Wotton ,  a man milde of nature, with soft voice, and fewe wordes, inclined to M. Secretaries iudgement, and said, in mine opinion, the Scholehouse  4 should be in deede, as it is called by name, the house of playe and pleasure, and not of feare and bondage: and  5 as I do remember, so saith Socrates in one place of Plato . And therefore, if  a Rodde carie the feare of a Sworde, it is no maruell, if those that be fearefull of nature, chose rather to forsake the Plaie, than to stand alwaies within the feare of a Sworde in a fonde mans handling.  6 M. Mason , after his maner, was verie merie with both parties, pleasantlie playing, both, with the shrewde touches of many courste boyes, and with the small discretion  7 of many leude Scholemasters. M. Haddon was fullie of M. Peters opinion, and said, that the best Scholemaster of our time, was the greatest beater, and 8 named the Person. Though, quoth I, it was his good fortune, to send from his Schole, vnto the Vniuersitie, one of the best Scholers in deede of all our time, yet wise men do thinke, that that came so to passe, rather, by the great towardnes of the Scholer, than by the great beating of the Master: and whether this be true or no, you your selfe are best witnes. I said somewhat farder in the matter, how, and whie, yong children, were soner allured by loue, than driuen by beating, to atteyne good learning: wherein I was the bolder to say my minde, bicause M. Secretarie curteslie prouoked me thereunto: or else, in such  a companie, and namelie in his praesence, my wonte is, to be more willing, to vse mine eares, than to occupie my tonge. Syr Walter Mildmaye , M. Astley , and the rest, said verie litle: onelie Syr Rich. Sackuill , said nothing at all. After dinner I went vp to read with the Queenes Maiestie. We red than togither in the Greke tonge, as I well 9 remember, that noble Oration of Demosthenes against Æ schines , for his false dealing in his ambassage to king Philip of Macedonie. Syr Rich. Sackuile came vp sone after: and finding me in hir maiesties priuie chamber, he  10 tooke me by the hand,  & carying me to a windoe, said, M. Ascham , I would not for  a good deale of monie, haue bene, this daie, absent from diner. Where, though I said nothing, yet I gaue as good eare, and do consider as well the taulke, that passed, as any one did there. M. Secretarie said very wisely, and most truely, that many yong wittes be driuen to hate learninge, before they know what learninge is. I can be good witnes to this my selfe: For a fond Scholemaster, before I was fullie fourtene yeare olde, draue me so, with feare of beating, from all loue of learninge, as nowe, when I know, what difference it is, to haue learninge, and to haue litle, or none at all, I feele it my greatest greise, and finde it my greatest hurte, that euer came to me, that it was my so ill chance, to light vpon so lewde a Scholemaster. But seing it is but in vain, to lament thinges paste, and also wisdome to looke to thinges to cum, surely, God willinge, if God lend me life, I will make this my mishap, some occasion of good hap, to litle Robert Sackuile my sonnes sonne. For whose bringinge vp, I would gladlie, if it so please you, vse speciallie your good aduice. I heare saie, you have  a sonne, moch of his age: we wil deale thus togither. Point you out a Scholemaster, who by your order, shall teache my sonne and yours, and for all the rest, I will prouide, yea though they three do cost me a couple of hundred poundes by yeare: and beside, you shall finde me as fast a Frend to you and yours, as perchance any you haue. Which promise, the worthie Ientleman surelie kept with me, vntill his dying daye. 11 We had than farther taulke togither, of bringing vp of children: of the nature, of quicke, and hard wittes: of the right choice of a good witte: of Feare, and loue in teachinge children. We passed from children and came to yonge men, namely, Ientlemen: we taulked of their to moch libertie, to liue as they lust: of their letting louse to sone, to ouermoch experience of ill, contrarie to the good order of many good olde common welthes of the Persians and Grekes: of witte gathered, and good fortune gotten, by some, onely by experience, without learning. And lastlie, he required of me verie earnestlie, to shewe, what I thought of the common goinge of Englishe men into Italie. But, sayth he, bicause this place, and this tyme, will not suffer so long taulke, as these good matters require, therefore I pray you, at my request, and at your leysure, put in some order of writing, the cheife pointes of this our taulke, concerning, the right order of teachinge, and honestie of liuing, for the good bringing vp of children & yong men. And surelie, beside contentinge me, you shall both please and profit verie many others. I made some excuse by lacke of habilitie, and weakenes of bodie: well, sayth he, I am not now to learne, what you can do. Our deare frende, good M. Goodricke , whose iudgement I could well beleue, did once for all, satisfie me fullie therein. Againe, I heard you say, not long agoe, that you may thanke Syr John Cheke , for all the learninge you haue: And I know verie well my selfe, that you did teach the Quene. And therefore seing God did so blesse you, to make you the Scholer of the best Master, and also the Scholemaster of the best Scholer, that euer were in our tyme, surelie, you should please God, benefite your countrie,  & honest your owne name, if you would take the paines, to impart to others, what you learned of soch a Master, and how ye taught soch a scholer. And, in vttering the stuffe ye receiued of the one, in declaring the order ye tooke with the other, ye shall neuer lacke, neither matter, nor maner, what to write, nor how to write in this kinde of Argument. I beginning some farther excuse, sodeinlie was called to cum to the Queene. The night following, I slept litle, my head was so full of this our former taulke, and I so mindefull, somewhat to satisfie the honest request of so deare a frend. I thought to praepare some litle treatise for a Newyeares gift that Christmas. But, as it chanceth to busie builders, so, in building thys my poore Scholehouse (the rather bicause the forme of it is somewhat new, and differing from others) the worke rose dailie higher and wider, than I thought it would at the beginninge. And though it appeare now, and be in verie deede, but a small cotage, poore for the stuffe, and rude for the workemanship, yet in going forward, I found the site so good, as I was lothe to giue it ouer, but the making so costlie, outreaching my habilitie, as many tymes I wished, that some one of those three, my deare frendes, with full pursses, Syr Tho. Smithe , M. Haddon , or M. Watson ,  12 had had the doing of it. Yet, neuerthelesse, I my  13 selfe, spending gladlie that litle, that I gatte at home by  14 good Syr Iohn Cheke , and that that I borrowed abroad  15 of my frend Sturmius , beside somewhat that was left me in Reuersion by my olde Masters, Plato, Aristotle , and  16 Cicero , I haue at last patched it vp, as I could, and as  17 you see. If the matter be meane, and meanly handled, I pray you beare, both with me, and it: for neuer worke  18 went vp in worse wether, with mo lettes and stoppes,  19 than this poore Scholehouse of mine. Westminster Hall can beare some witnesse, beside much weakenes of bodie, but more trouble of minde, by some soch sores, as greue me to toche them my selfe, and therefore I purpose not to open them to others. And, in middes of outward iniuries, and inward cares, to encrease them withall, good Syr Rich.Sackuile dieth, that worthie Ientleman: That earnest fauorer and furtherer of Gods true Religion: That faithful Seruitor to his Prince and Countrie: A louer of learning,  & all learned men: Wise in all doinges: Curtesse to all persons: shewing spite to none: doing good to many: and as I well found, to me so fast a frend, as I neuer lost the like before. Whan he was gone, my hart was dead. There was not one, that woare a blacke gowne for him, who caried a heuier hart for him, than I. Whan he was gone, I cast this booke awaie: I could not looke vpon it, but with weping eyes, in remembring him, who was the onelie setter on, to do it, and would haue bene, not onelie a glad commender of it, but also a sure and certaine comfort, to me and mine, for it. Almost two yeares togither, this booke lay scattered, and neglected, and had bene quite giuen ouer of me, if the goodnesse of one had not giuen me some life and spirite againe. God, the mouer of goodnesse, prosper alwaies him & his, as he hath many times comforted me and mine, and, I trust to God, shall comfort more and more. Of whom, most iustlie I may saie, and verie oft, and alwaies gladlie, I am wont to say, that sweete verse of Sophocles , spoken by Oedipus to worthie Theseus . 20 ἔ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) , ἅ ἔ ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/idiagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) .  . Thys hope hath helped me to end this booke: which, if he allowe, I shall thinke my labours well imployed, and shall not moch  aesteme the misliking of any others. And I trust, he shall thinke the better of it, bicause he shall finde the best part thereof, to cum out of his Schole, whom he, of all men loued and liked best. Yet some men, frendly enough of nature, but of small iudgement in learninge, do thinke, I take to moch paines, and spend to moch time, in settinge forth these childrens affaires. But those good men were neuer  21 brought vp in Socrates Schole, who saith plainlie, that no man goeth  about a more godlie purpose, than he that is mindfull of the good bringing vp, both of hys owne, and other mens children. Therefore, I trust, good and wise men, will thinke well of this my doing. And of other, that thinke otherwise, I will thinke my selfe, they are but men, to be pardoned for their follie, and pitied for their ignoraunce. In writing this booke, I haue had earnest respecte to three speciall pointes, trothe of Religion, honestie in liuing, right order in learning. In which three waies, I praie God, my poore children may diligently waulke: for whose sake, as nature moued, and reason required, and necessitie also somewhat compelled, I was the willinger to take these paines. For, seing at my death, I am not like to leaue them any great store of liuing, therefore in my life time, I thought good to bequeath vnto the, in this litle booke, as in my Will and Testament, the right waie to good learning: which if they followe, with the feare of God, they shall verie well cum to sufficiencie of liuinge. I wishe also, with all my hart, that yong M. Rob.Sackuille , may take that fructe of this labor, that his worthie Grauntfather purposed he should have done: And if any other do take, either proffet, or pleasure hereby, they haue cause to thanke M. Robert Sackuille , for whom speciallie this my Scholemaster was prouided. And one thing I would haue the Reader consider in readinge this booke, that bicause, no Scholemaster hath charge of any childe, before he enter into hys Schole, therefore I leauing all former care, of their good bringing vp, to wise and good Parentes, as  a matter not belonging to the Scholemaster, I do appoynt thys my Scholemaster, than, and there to begin, where his office and charge beginneth. Which charge lasteth not long, but vntill the Scholer be made hable to go to the Vniuersitie, to procede in Logike, Rhetoricke, and other kindes of learning. Yet if my Scholemaster, for loue he beareth to hys Scholer, shall teach hym somewhat for hys furtherance, and better iudgement in learning, that may serue him seuen yeare after in the Vniuersitie, he doth hys Scholer no more wrong, nor deserueth no worse name therby, than he doth in London, who felling silke or cloth vnto his frend, doth giue hym better measure, than either hys promise or bargaine was. Farewell in Christ . After the childe hath learned perfitlie the eight partes of speach, let him then learne the right ioyning togither of substantiues with adiectiues, the nowne with the verbe, the relatiue with the antecedent. And in learninge farther hys syntaris, by mine aduice, he shall not vse the common order in common scholes, for making of latines: wherby, the childe commonlie learneth, first, and euill choice of wordes, (and right choice of wordes, saith C aesar,  22 is the foundation of eloquence) than, a wrong placing of wordes: and lastlie, an ill framing of the sentenc e, with a peruerse iudgement, both of wordes and sentences. These faultes, taking once roote in yougthe, be neuer, or hardlie, pluckt away in age. Moreouer, there is no one thing, that  23 hath more, either dulled the wittes, or taken awaye the will of children from learning, then the care they haue, to satisfie their masters, in making of latines. For, the scholer, is commonlie beat for the making, whe the master were more worthie to be beat for the mending, or rather, marring of the same: The master many times, being as ignorant as the childe, what to saie properlie and sitlie to the matter. A childe shall learne of the better of them, that, which an other daie, if he be wise, and cum to iudgement, he must be saine to vnlearne againe. Oratore , which, wiselie brought into scholes, truely taught, and costantly vsed, would not onely take wholly away this butcherlie feare in making of latines, but would also, with case and pleasure, and in short time, as I know by good experience, worke a true choice and placing of wordes, a right ordering of sentences, an easie vnderstandyng of the tonge, a readines to speake, a facilitie to write, a true iudgement, both of his owne, and other mens doinges, what tonge so euer he doth vse. The waie is this. After the thr ee Concordances learned, as I touched before, let the master read vnto hym the Epistles of Cicero, gathered togither and chosen out by Sturmius, for the capacitie of children. First, let him teach the childe, cherefullie and plainlie, 27 the cause, and matter of the letter: then, let him censtrue it into Englishe, so oft, as the childe may easilie carie awaie the vnderstanding of it: Lastlie, parse it ouer perfitlie. This done thus, let the childe, by and by, both censtrue and parse it ouer againe: so, that it may appeare, that the childe douteth in nothing, that his master taught him before. After this, the childe must take a paper booke, and sitting in some place, where no man shall prompe him, by him self, let him translate into Englishe his former lesson. Then shewing  28 it to his master, let the master take from him his latin booke, and pausing an houre, at the least, than let the childe translate his owne Englishe into latin againe, in an other paper booke. When the childe bringeth it, turned into latin, the master must compare it with  Tullies booke, and laie them both togither: and where the childe doth well, either in chosing, or true placing of Tullies wordes, let the master 29 praise him, and saie here ye do well. For I assure you, there is no such whetstone, to sharpen a good witte and encourage a will to learninge, as is praise. But if the childe misse, either in forgetting a worde, or in chaunging a good with a worse, or misfordering the sentence, I would not have the master, either froune, or chide with him, if the childe haue done his diligence, and vsed no trewandship therein. For I know by good experience, that 30 a childe shall take more profit of two fautes, tentlie warned of, then of foure thinges, rightly hitt. For than, the master shall haue good occasion to saie vnto him.  N. Tullie would haue vsed such a worde, not this: Tullie would haue placed this worde here, not there: would haue vsed this case, this number, this person, this degr ee, this gender: he would haue vsed this moode, this tens, this simple, rather than this compound: this aduerbe here, not there: he would haue ended the sentence with this verbe, not with that nowne or participle. &c. In these fewe lines, I haue wrapped vp, the most tedious part of Grammer: and also the ground of almost all the Kewles, that are so busil ie taught by the Master, and so hardlie learned by the Scholer, in all common Scholes: which after this sort, the master shall teach without all error, and the scholer shall learne without great paine: the master being led by so sure a guide, and the scholer being brought into so plaine and easie a waie. And therefore, we do not contemne Kewles, but we gladlie teach Kewles: and teach them, more plainlie, sensiblie, and orderlie, than they be commonlie taught in common Scholes. For whan the Master shall compare Tullies booke with his Scholers translation, let the Master, at the first, lead and teach his Scholer, to ioyne the Kewles of his Grammer booke, with the examples of his present lesson, vntill the Scholer, by him selfe, be hable to fetch out of his Grammer, euerie Kewle, for euerie Example: So, as the Grammer booke be euer in the Scholers hand, and also vsed of him, as a Dictionarie, for euerie present vse. This is a liuely and persite waie of teaching of Kewles: where the common waie, vsed in common Scholes, to read the Grammer alone by it selfe, is tedious for the Master, hard for the Scholer, colde and vncumfortable for them bothe. Let your Scholer be neuer afraide, to aske you any dout, but vse discretlie the best allurementes ye can, to encorage him to the same: lest, his euermoch fearinge of you, driue him to s eeke some misorderlie shifte: as, to seeke to be helped by some other booke, or to be prompted by some other Scholer, and so goe aboute to begile you moch, and him selfe more. With this waie, of good vnderstanding the mater, plaine construinge, diligent parsinge, dailie translatinge, cherefull admonishinge, and h eedefull amendinge of faultes: neuer leauinge behinde iuste praise for well doinge, I would haue the Scholer brought vp withall, till he had red, & translated ouer ye first booke of Epistles chosen out by Sturmius, with a good p eece of a Comedie of Terence also. 31 All this while, by mine aduise, the childe shall vse to speake no latine: For, as  Cicero saith in like mater, with like wordes, loquendo, male loqui discunt . And, that excellent 32 that whan he began to learne the latin tonge, vse of speaking latin at the table, and elsewhere, vnaduisedlie, did bring him to soch an euill choice of wordes, to soch a crooked framing of sentences, that no one thing did hurt or hinder him more, all the daies of his life afterward, both for redinesse in speaking, and also good iudgement in writinge. In very d eede, if childre were brought vp, in soch a house, or soch a Schole, where the latin tonge were properlie and perfitlie spoken, as Tib. surelie, than the dailie vse of speaking, were the best and readiest waie, to learne the latin tong. But, now, commonlie, in the best Scholes in England, for wordes, right choice is smallie regarded, true proprietie whollie neglected, confusion is brought in, barbariousnesse is bred vp so in yong wittes, as afterward they be, not onelie marde for speaking, but also corrupted in iudgement: as with moch adoe, or neuer at all, they be brought to right frame againe. and so do I verie earnestlie too. We bothe, haue one purpose: we agree in desire, we wish one end: but we differ somewhat in order and waie, that leadeth rightlie to that end. Other would haue them speake at all aduentures: and, so they be speakinge, to speake, the Master careth not, the Scholer knoweth not, what. This is, to seeme, and not to bee: except it be, to be bolde without shame, rashe without skill, full of wordes without witte. I wish to haue them speake so, as it may well appeare, that the braine doth gouerne the tonge, and that reason leadeth forth the taulke. Socrates doctrine is true in Plato, and well marked, and 33 knowledge both accompanie the witte, there best vtterance 34 doth alwaies awaite vpon the tonge: For, good vnderstanding 35 must first be bred in the childe, which, being nurished with skill, and vse of writing (as I will teach more largelie hereafter) is the onelie waie to bring him to iudgement and readinesse in speakinge: and that in farre shorter time (if he followe constantlie the trade of this litle lesson) than he shall do, by common teachinge of the comon scholes in England. But, to go forward, as you perceiue, your scholer to goe better and better on awaie, first, with vnderstanding his lesson more quicklie, with passing more readelie, with translating more spedelie and perfitlie then he was wonte, after, giue him longer lessons to translate: and withall, begin to teach him, both in nownes, & verbes, what is Proprium ,  36 and what is  Translatum , what Synonymum , what Diuersum , his lecture. Proprium .    Rex Sepultus est ------ Proprium .    magnific e . Translatum.   Cum illo principe, Sepulta est  & gloria & Salus Republicoe  . --- Synonyma.   Ensis, Gladius. Laudare, pr aedicare . Diversa.   Diligere, Amare. Calere, Exardescere Inimicus, Hostis  . Contraria.   Accrbu & luctuosum bellum. Dulcis & laeta Pax  . Phrases.   Dare verba. abijcere obedientiam  . Your scholer then, must have the third paper booke: in 37 the which, after he hath done his double translation, let him write, after this sort foure of these forenamed fire, diligentlie marked out of euerie lesson. Propria. ------ Translata. Quatuor.   Synonyma. Diuersa. Contraria. Phrases . Or else, thr ee, or two, if there be no moe: and if there be none of these at all in some lecture, yet not emitte the order, but write these. Diuersa nulla. --- Contraria nulla. &c . This diligent translating, ioyned with this h edefull marking, in the foresaid Epistles, and after warde in some plaine Oration of Tullie, as, pro lege Manil: pro Archia Poeta , or in those three ad C. C aes : shall worke soch a right choice of wordes, so streight a framing of sentences, such a true iudgement, both to write skilfullie, and speake wittelie, as wise men shall both praise, and maruell at. If your scholer do misse sometimes, in marking rightlie 38 these foresaid fire thinges, chide not hastelie: for that shall, both dull his witte, and discorage his diligence: but monish him gentelie: which shall make him, both willing to amende, and glad to go forward in loue and hope of learning. I haue now wished, twise or thrise, this gentle nature, to be in a Scholemaster: And, that I haue done so, neither by chance, nor without some reason, I will now declare at large, why, in mine opinion, loue is fitter then feare, ientlenes 39 better than beating, to bring up a childe rightlie in learninge.  40  With the common vse of teaching and beating in common 41 scholes of England, I will not greatlie contend: which if I did, it were but a small grammaticall controuersie, neither belonging to heresie nor treason, nor greatly touching God nor the Prince: although in very d eede, in the end, the good or ill bringing up of children, doth as much serue to the good or ill seruice, of God, our Prince, and our whole countrie, as any one thing doth beside. I do gladlie agr e with all good Scholemasters in these pointes: to haue children brought to good perfitnes in learning: to all honestie in maners: to haue all fautes rightlie amended: to haue euerie vice seuerelie corrected: but for the order and waie that leadeth rightlie to these pointes, we somewhat differ. For commonlie, many scholemasters, some, as I haue seen, moe, as I haue heard tell, be of so crooked  42 a nature, as, when they meete with a hard witted scholer, they rather breake him, than bowe him, rather marre him, than mend him. For whan the scholemaster is angrie with some other matter, then will he sonest faul to beate his scholer: and though he him selfe should be punished for his folie, yet must he beate some scholer for his pleasure: though there be no cause for him to do so, nor yet fault in the scholer to deserue so. These ye will say, be fond scholemasters, and fewe they be, that be found to be such. They be fond in deede, but furelie ouermany such be found euerie where. But this will I say, that euen the wisest of your 43 great beaters, do as oft punishe nature, as they do correcte faultes. yea, many times, the better nature, is sorer punished: For, if one, by quicknes of witte, take his lesson readelie, an other, by hardnes of witte, taketh it not so sp eedelie: the first is alwaies commended, the other is commonlie punished: whan a wise scholemaster, should rather discretelie consider the right disposition of both their natures, and not so much wey what either of them is able to do now,  44 as what either of them is likelic to do hereafter. For this I know, not onelie by reading of bookes in my studie, but also by experience of life, abrode in the world, that those, which be commonlie the wisest, the best learned, and best men also, when they be olde, were neuer commonlie the quickest of witte, when they were yonge. The causes why, amongest other, which be many, that moue me thus to thinke, be these fewe, which I will recken. Quicke wittes commonlie, be apte to take, vnapte to keepe: soone hote and desirous of this and that: as colde and sone wery of the same againe: more quicke to enter spedelie, than hable to pearse farre: euen like ouer sharpe tooles, whose edges be verie soone turned. Soch wittes delite them selues in easie and pleasant studies, and neuer passe farre for ward in hie and hard sciences. And therfore the quickest wittes commonlie may proue the best Poetes, but not the wisest Orators: readie of tonge to speake boldlie, not deepe of iudgement, either  45 for good counsell or wise writing. Also, for maners and life, quicke wittes commonlie, be, in desire, newfangle, in purpose, unconstant, light to promise any thing, readie to forget euery thing: both benefite and iniurie: and therby neither fast to frend, nor fearefull to foe: inquisitiue of euery trifle, not secret in greatest affaires: bolde, with any person: busie, in euery matter: sothing, soch as be present: nipping any that is absent: of nature also, alwaies, flattering their betters, enuying their equals, despising their inferiors: and, by quicknes of witte, verie quicke and readie, to like none so well as them selues. Moreouer commonlie, men, very quicke of witte, be also, verie light of conditions: and thereby, very readie of disposition, to be caried ouer quicklie, by any light cumpanie, to any riot and vnthriftines when they be yonge: and therfore seldome, either honest of life, or riche in liuing, when they be olde. For, quicke in witte, and light in maners, be, either seldome troubled, or verie sone wery, in carying a verie heuie purse. Quicke wittes also be, in most part of all their doinges, ouerquicke, hastie, rashe, headie, and brainsicke. These two last wordes, Headie, and Brainsicke, be fitte and proper wordes, rising naturallie of the matter, and tearmed aptlie by the condition, of ouer much quickenes of witte. In yougthe also they be, readie scoffers, priuie mockers, and euer ouer light and mery. In aige, sone testie, very waspishe, and alwaies ouer miserable: and yet fewe of them cum to any great aige, by reason of their misordered life when they were yong: but a great deale fewer of them cum to she we any great countenance, or beare any great authoritie abrode in the world, but either liue obscurelie, mu know not how, or dye obscurelie, me marke not whan. They be like tr ees, that shewe forth, faire blossoms & broad leaues in spring time, but bring out small and not long lasting fruite in haruest time: and that onelie soch, as fall, and rotte, before they be ripe, and so, neuer, or seldome, cum to any good at all. For this ye shall finde most true by experience, that amongest a number of quicke wittes in youthe, fewe be found, in the end, either verie fortunate for them selues, or verie profitable to serue the common wealth, but decay and vanish, men know not which way: except a very fewe, to whom peraduenture blood and happie parentage, may perchance purchace a long standing upon the stage. The which felicitie, because it commeth by others procuring, not by their owne deseruinge, and stand by other mens f eete, and not by their own, what owtwardbrag so euer is borne by them, is in deed, of it selfe, and in wise mens eyes, of no great estimation. 46 Some wittes, moderate enough by nature, be many tymes marde by ouer moch studie and use of some sciences, namelie, Musicke, Arithmetick, and Geometrie. Thies sciences, as they sharpen mens wittes ouer moch, so they change mens maners ouer sore, if they be not moderatlie mingled,  & wiselie applied to som good use of life. Marke all  47 Mathematicall heades, which be onely and wholy bent to those sciences, how solitarie they be theselues, how unfit to liue with others, & how unapte to serue in the world. This is not onelie knowen now by common experience, but uttered long before by wise mens Judgement and sentence.  48 Galene saith, moch Musick marreth mens maners: and 49 matter, I wrote once more at large, 11. yeare a go, in my booke of shoting: now I thought but to touch it, to proue, that ouer much quicknes of witte, either giuen by nature, or sharpened by studie, doth not commonlie bring forth, eyther greatest learning, best maners, or happiest life in the end. 50 Contrariewise, a witte in youth, that is not ouer dulle, heauie, knottie and lumpishe, but hard, rough, and though somwhat staffishe, as  Tullie periculo, such a witte I say, if it be, at the first well handled by the mother, and rightlie smothed and wrought as it should, not ouerwhartlie, and against the wood, by the scholemaster, both for learning, and hole course of liuing, proueth alwaies the best. In woode and stone, not the softest, but hardest, be alwaies aptest, for portrature, both fairest for pleasure, and most durable for proffit. Hard wittes be hard to receiue, but sure to k eepe: painefull without werinesse, hedefull without wauering, constant without newfanglenes: bearing heauie thinges, thoughe not lightlie, yet willinglie: entring hard thinges, though not easelie, yet depelie, and so cum to that perfitnes of learning in the ende, that quicke wittes, seeme in hope, but do not in deede, or else derie seldome, euer attaine unto. Also, for maners  51 and life, hard wittes commonlie, ar hardlie caried, either to desire euerie new thing, or else to meruell at euery strange thinge: and therfore they be carefull and diligent in their own matters, not curious and busey in other mens affaires: and so, they becum wise them selues, and also ar counted honest by others. They be graue, stedfast, silent of tong, secret of hart. Not hastie in making, but constant in keping any promise. Not rashe in uttering, but ware in considering euery matter: and therby, not quicke in speaking, but deepe of iudgement, whether they write, or giue counsell in all waightie affaires. And theis be the me, that becum in the end, both most happie for themselues, and alwaise best estemed abrode in the world. I haue bene longer in describing, the nature, the good or ill successe, of the quicke and hard witte, than perchance som will thinke, this place and matter both require. But 52 my purpose was hereby, plainlie to utter, what injurie is offered to all learninge,  & to the common welthe also, first, by the fond father in chosing, but chieflie by the lewd scholemaster in beating and driuing away the best natures from learning. A childe that is still, silent, constant, and somwhat hard of witte, is either neuer chosen by the father to be made a scholer, or else, when he commeth to the schole, he is smally regarded, little looked unto, he lacketh teaching, he lacketh coraging, he lacketh all thinges, onelie he neuer lacketh beating, nor any word, that may moue him to hate learninge, nor any d eed that may driue him from learning, to any other kinde of liuing. 53 And when this sadde natured, and hard witted child, is bette from his booke, and becummeth after eyther student of the common lawe, or page in the Court, or seruingman, or bound prentice to a merchant, or to som handiecrafte, he proueth in the ende, wiser, happier and many tymes honester too, than many of theis quick wittes do, by their learninge. Learning is, both hindred and iniured to, by the ill choice of them, that send yong scholers to the vniuersities. Of whom must nedes cum all oure Diuines, Lawyers, and Physicions. 54 Thies yong scholers be chosen commonlie, as yong apples be chosen by children, in a faire garden about  S. Iames tyde: a childe will chose a sw eeting, because it is presentlie faire and pleasant, and refuse a Runnet, bycause it is than grene, hard, and sowre, whan the one, if it be eaten, doth breed, both wormes and ill humors: the other if it stand his tyme, be ordered and kepte as it should, is holsom of it self, and helpeth to the good disgestion of other meates: Sweetinges, will receyue wormes, rotte, and dye on the tree, and neuer or seldom cum to the gathering for good and lasting store. For verie greafe of harte I will not applie the similitude: but hereby, is plainlie s een, how learning is robbed of hir best wittes, first by the greate beating, and after by the ill chosing of scholers, to go to the vniuersities. Whereof cummeth partelie, that lewde and spitefull prouerbe, sounding to the greate hurte of learning, and shame of learned men, that, the greatest Clerkes be not the wisest men. And though I, in all this discourse, s eem plainlie to prefer, hard and roughe wittes, before quicke and light wittes, both for learnyng and maners, yet and I not ignorant that som quicknes of witte, is a singuler gifte of God, and so most rare emonges men, and namelie such a witte, as is quicke without lightnes, sharpe without brittlenes, desirous of good thinges without newfanglenes, diliget in painfull thinges without werisomnes, and constant in good will to do all thinges well, as I know was in Syr Iohn Cheke, and is in som, that yet liue, in whome all theis faire qualities of witte ar fullie mette togither. to his frende Crito . That, that number of men is fewest, which far excede, either in good or ill, in wisdom or folie, but the meane betwixt both, be the greatest number:  56 which he proueth trewe in diuerse other thinges: as in greyhoundes, emonges which fewe are found, exceding greate, or exceding litle, exceding swift, or exceding flowe: And therfore, I speaking of quick and hard wittes, I ment, the common number of quicke and hard wittes, emonges the which, for the most parte, the hard witte, proueth manie times, the better learned, wiser and honester man: and therfore, do I the more lament, that soch wittes commonlie be either kepte from learning, by fond fathers, or bet from learning by lewde scholemasters. And speaking thus moche of the wittes of children for 57 learning, the opportunitie of the place, and goodnes of the matter might require to haue here declared the most speciall notes of a good witte for learning in a childe, after the maner and custume of a good horsman, who is skilfull, to know, and hable to tell others, how by certein sure signes, a man may choise a colte, that is like to proue an other day, excellent for the saddle. And it is pitie, that commonlie, more care is had, yea and that emonges verie wise men, to  58 finde out rather a cunnynge man for their horse, than a cunnyng man for their children. They say nay in worde, but they do so in d eede. For, to the one, they will gladlie giue a stipend of 200. Crounes by yeare, and loth to offer to the other,  59 200\. shillinges. God, that sitteth in heauen laugheth their choice to skorne, and rewardeth their liberalitie as it should: for he suffereth them, to haue, tame, and well ordered horse, but wilde and unfortunate Children: and therfore in the ende they finde more pleasure in their horse, than comforte in their children. But concerning the trewe notes of the best wittes for learning in a childe, I will reporte, not myne own opinion, but the dery iudgement of him, that was counted the best teacher and wisest man that learning maketh mention of, and that is Socrates in Plato , who expresseth orderlie thies 60 seuen plaine notes to choise a good witte in a child for learninge. 1.   ![](/images/inline/Egk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  .   61 --- 2.   ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . 3.   ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . 4.   ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . 5.   ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . 6.   ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ἴ ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . 7.   ![](/images/inline/PHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/idiagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . And bicause I write English, and to Englishemen, I will plainlie declare in Englishe both, what thies wordes of Plato meane, and how aptlie they be linked, and how orderlie they folow one an other. ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . 62 Is he, that is apte by goodnes of witte, and appliable by  63 readines of will, to learning, hauing all other qualities of the minde and partes of the bodie, that must an other day serue learning, not trobled, magled, and halfed, but sounde, whole, full,  & hable to do their office: as, a tong, not stamering  64 or ouer hardlie drawing forth wordes, but plaine, and  65 redie to deliuer the meaning of the minde: a voice, not softe, weake, piping, womannishe, but audible, stronge, and manlike: a countenance, not werishe and crabbed, but faire and  66 cumlie: a personage, not wretched and deformed, but taule  67 and goodlie: for surelie, a cumlie countenance, with a goodlie nature, geueth credit to learning, and authoritie to the person: otherwise commonlie, either, open contempte, or priuie 68 dissauour both hurte, or hinder, both person and learning. And, euen as a faire stone requireth to be sette in the finest gold, with the best workmanshyp, or else it leseth moch of the Grace and price, euen so, excellencye in learning, and namely Diuinitie, ioyned with a cumlie personage, is a meruelous Iewell in the world. And how can a cumlie bodie be better employed, than to serue the fairest exercise of Goddes greatest gifte, and that is learning. But commonlie, the fairest bodies, ar bestowed on the foulest purposes. I would it were not so: and with examples herein I will not medle: yet I wishe, that those shold, both mynde it,  & medle with it, which haue most occasion to looke to it, as good and wise fathers shold do, and greatest authoritie to amend it, as good & wise magistrates ought to do: And yet I will not let,  69 openlie to lament the unfortunate case of learning herein. For, if a father haue foure sonnes, thr ee faire and well formed both mynde and bodie, the fourth, wretched, lame, and deformed, his choice shalbe, to put the worst to learning, as one good enoughe to becum a scholer. I haue spent the most parte of my life in the Uniuersitie, and therfore I can beare good witnes that many fathers commonlie do thus: wherof, I haue hard many wise, learned, and as good men as euer I knew, make great, and oft complainte: a good horseman will choise no soch colte, neither for his own, nor yet for his masters sadle And thus moch of the first note. ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) Good of memorie: a speciall parte of the first note ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  ,  70 and a mere benefite of nature: yet it is so necessarie for learning: as Plato maketh it a separate and perfite note of it selfe, and that so principall a note, as without it, all other giftes of nature do small seruice to learning. Afranius , that 71 olde Latin Poete maketh Memorie the mother of learning and wisedome, saying thus. Vsus me genuit, Mater peperit memoria , and though it be the mere gifte of nature, yet is memorie well preserued by use, and moch encreased by order, as our scholer must learne an other day in the Uniuersitie: but in a childe, a good memorie  72 is well known, by thr ee properties: that is, if it be, quicke in receyuing, sure in keping, and redie in deliuering forthe againe. ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) Giuen to loue learning: for though a child haue all the giftes of nature at wishe, and perfection of memorie at wil, yet if he haue not a speciall loue to learning, he shall neuer attaine to moch learning. And therfore Isocrates , one of the noblest scholemasters, that is in memorie of learning, who taught Kinges and Princes, as Halicarnass aeus writeth, and out of whole schole, as Tullie faith, came forth, mo noble Capitanes, mo wise Councelors, than did out of Epeius horse at Troie. This Isocrates, I say, did cause to be writte, at the entrie of his schole, in golden letters, this golden sentence, ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἦ ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which excellentlie said in Greeke, is thus rudelie in Englishe, if thou louest learning, theu shalt attayne to moch learning. ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) Is he, that hath a lust to labor, and a will to sake paines. For, if a childe haue all the benefites of nature, with perfection of memorie, loue, like, & praise learning neuer so moch, yet if he be not of him selfe painfull, he shall neuer attayne vnto it. And yet where loue is present, labor is seldom absent, and namelie in studie of learning, and matters of the mynde: and therfore did Isocrates rightlie iudge, that if his scholer were ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/idiagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , he cared for no more. Aristotle, uariing from  Isocrates in priuate affaires of life, but agreing with Isocrates in common iudgement of learning, for loue and labor in learning, is of the same opinio, uttered in these wordes, in his Rhetorike ad Theodecten . Libertie kindleth  73  loue: Loue refuseth no labor: and labor obteyneth what so euer it s eeketh. And yet neuerthelesse, Goodnes of nature may do litle good: Perfection of memorie, may serue to small use: All loue may be employed in vayne: Any labor may be sone graualed, if a man trust alwaies to his own singuler witte, and will not be glad somtyme to heare, take aduise, and learne of an other: And therfore doth Socrates very notablie adde the fifte note. ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . He, that is glad to heare and learne of an other. For otherwise, he shall sticke with great troble, where he might go easelie forwarde: and also catche hardlie a uerie litle by his owne toyle, whan he might gather quicklie a good deale, by an nother mans teaching. But now there be some, that haue great loue to learning, good lust to labor, be willing to learne of others, yet, either of a fonde shamefastnes, or else of a proude folie, they dare not, or will not, go to learne of an nother: And therfore doth Socrates wifelie adde the firte note of a good witte in a childe for learning, and that is. ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) He, that is naturallie bolde to aske any question, desirous to searche out any doute, not ashamed to learne of the meanest, not affraide to go to the greatest; vntill he be perfitelie taught, and fullie satisfiede. The seuenth and last poynte is. ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) He, that loueth to be praised for well doing, at his father, or masters hand. A childe of this nature, will earnestlie loue learnyng, gladlie labor for learning, willinglie learne of other, boldlie aske any doute. And thus, by Socrates iudgement, a good father, and a wife scholemaster, shold chose a chide to make a scholer of, that hath by nature, the foresayd persite qualities, and cumlie furniture, both of mynde and bodie: hath memorie, quicke to receyue, sure to keape, and readie to deliuer: hath loue to learning: hath lust to labor: hath desire to learne of others: hath boldnes to aske any question: hath mynde holie bent, to wynne praise by well doing. The two firste poyntes be speciall benefites of nature: which neuerthelesse, be well preserued, and moch encreased by good order. But as for the fiue laste, loue, labor, gladnes to learne of others, boldnes to aske doutes, and will to wynne praise, be wonne and maintened by the onelie wisedome and discretio of the scholemaster. Which fiue poyntes, whether a scholemaster shall worke soner in a childe, by fearefull beating, or curtese handling, you that be wise, iudge. Yet some men, wise in d eede, but in this matter, more by seueritie of nature, tha any wisdome at all, do laugh at vs, when we thus wishe and reason, that young children should rather be allured to learning by ientilnes and loue, than compelled to learning, by beating and feare: They say, our reasons serue onelie to breede forth talke, and passe a waie tyme, but we neuer saw good scholemaster do so; nor neuer red of wise man that thought so.

And lest proude wittes, that loue not to be contrayed, but haue lust to wrangle or trifle away troth, will say, that Socrates meaneth not this of childrens teaching, but of som other higher learnyng, heare, what Socrates in the same place both more plainlie say: ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ugr; ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) : ὦ ἄ ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  , that is to say, and therfore, my deare frend, bring not vp your children in learning by compulsion and feare, but by playing and pleasure, And you, that do read Plato, as ye shold, do well perceiue, that 75 Sentences, first affirmed by Socrates, as mere trothes, and after, giuen forth by Socrates, as right Rules, most necessarie to be marked, and fitte to be folowed of all them, that would haue children taughte, as they should. And in this counsell, iudgement, and authoritie of Socrates I will repose my selfe, vntill I meete with a man of the contrarie mynde, whom I may iustlie take to be wiser, than I thinke Socrates was. Fonde scholemasters, neither can vnderstand, 76 nor will folow this good counsell of  Socrates, but wise ryders, in their office, can and will do both: which is the onelie cause, that comonly, the yong ientlemen of England, go so vnwillinglie to schole, and run to fast to the stable: For in verie d eede fond scholemasters, by feare, do beate into the, the hatred of learning, and wise riders, by ientle allurementes, do breed vp in them, the loue of riding. They finde feare, & bondage in scholes, They feele libertie and freedome in stables: which causeth them, vtterlie to abhorre the one, and most gladlie to haunt the other. And I do not write this, that in exhorting to the one, I would dissuade yong ientlemen from the other: yea I am sorie, with all my harte, that they be giuen no more to riding, then they be: For, of all  77 outward qualities, to ride faire, is most cumelie for him selfe, most necessarie for his contrey, and the greater he is in blood, the greater is his praise, the more he doth excede all other therein. It was one of the three excellent praises, amongest the noble ientlemen the old  Percians, Alwaise to say troth, to ride faire, and shote well: and so it was engrauen 78 Darius the king, lieth buried heare, Who in riding and shoting had neuer peare. But, to our purpose, yong men, by any meanes, l eesing the loue of learning, whan by tyme they cum to their owne rule, they carie commonlie, from the schole with them, a perpetuall hatred of their master, and a continuall contempt of learning. If ten Ientlemen be asked, why they forget so sone in Court, that which they were learning so long in schole, eight of them, or let me blamed, will laie the fault on their ill handling, by their scholemasters. Cuspinian doth report, that, that noble Emperour Maximilian, would lament verie oft, his misfortune herein. 79 Yet, some will say, that children of nature, loue pastime.  80 and mislike learning: bicause, in their kinde, the one is easie  & pleasant, the other hard and werison: which is an opinion not so trewe, as some men weene: For, the matter lieth not so much in the disposition of them that be yong, as in the order maner of bringing vp, by them that be old, nor yet in the differece of learnyng and pastime. For, beate a child, if he daunce not well, & cherish him, though he learne not well, ye shall haue him, vnwilling to go to daunce, & glad to go to his booke. Knocke him alwaies, when he draweth his shaft ill, and fauor him againe, though he faut at his booke, ye shall haue hym verie loth to be in the field, and verie willing to be in the schole, Yea, I saie more, and not of my selfe, but by the iudgemet of those, from whom few wifemen will gladlie dissent, that if euer the nature of man be giuen at any tyme, more than other, to receiue goodnes, it is, in innocenrie of yong yeares, before, that experience of euil, haue taken roote in hym. For, the pure cleane witte of a sweete yong babe, is like the newest war, most hable to receiue the best and sayrest printing: and like a new bright siluer dishe neuer occupied, to receiue and kepe cleane, anie good thyng that is put into it. 81 And thus, will in children, wiselie wrought withall, maie easelie be won to be verie well willing to learne. And witte in childre, by nature, namelie memorie, the onely keie and keper  82 of all learning, is readiest to receiue, and surest to kepe anie maner of thing, that is learned in yougth: This, lewde and learned, by common experiece, know to be most trewe. For we remember nothyng so well when we be olde, as those thinges which we learned when we were yong: And this is not straunge, but common in all natures workes.  83 Euery man s ees, (as I sayd before) new wax is best for printyng: new claie, fittest for working: new shorne woll, aptest for sone and surest dying: new fresh flesh, for good and durable salting. And this similitude is not rude, nor borowed of the larder house, but out of his scholehouse, of whom, the wisest of England, neede not be ashamed to learne. Yong Graftes grow not onelie sonest, but also fairest, and bring alwayes forth the best and sweetest frute: yong whelpes learne easelie to carie: yong Popingeis learne quicklie to speake: And so, to be short, if in all other thinges, though they lacke reason, sens, and life, the similitude of youth is fittest to all goodnesse, surelie nature, in mankinde, is most beneficiall and effectuall in this behalfe. Thefore, if to the goodnes of nature, be ioyned the wisedome of the teacher, in leading yong wittes into a right and plaine waie of learnyng, surelie, children, kept vp in Gods feare, and gouerned by his grace, maie most easelie be brought well to serue God, and contrey doth by vertue and wisedome. But if will, and witte, by farder age, be once allured fro innocencie, delited in vaine fightes, filed with foull taulke, crooked with wilfulnesse, hardned with stubburnesse, and let louse to disobedience, surelie it is hard with ientlenesse, but vnpossible with seuere crueltie, to call them backe to good frame againe. For, where the one, perchance maie bend it, the other shall surelie breake it: and so in stead of some hope, trewlie and most wittelie marke. Therfore, to loue or to hate, to like or contemne, to plie this waie or that waie to good or to bad, ye shall haue as ye vse a child in his youth. And one example, whether loue or feare doth worke more in a child, for vertue and learning, I will gladlie report: which maie be hard with some pleasure, and folowed with more profit. Before I went into Germaine, I came to Brodegate in Lecetershire, to take my leaue of that noble 85 the Duke and the Duches, with all the houshould, Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, were huntinge in the Parke: I founde her, in her Chamber, readinge Ph aedon Platonis in Gr eeke, and that with as moch delite, as som ientleman wold read a merie tale in Bocase. After salutation, and dewtie done, with som other taulke, I asked hir, whie she wold l eese soch pastime in the Parke? smiling she answered me: I wisse, all their sporte in the Parke is but a shadoe to that pleasure, that I find in Plato : Alas good folke, they neuer felt, what trewe pleasure ment. And howe came you Madame, quoth I, to this d eepe knowledge of pleasure, and what did chieflie allure you vnto it: seinge, not many women, but verie fewe men haue atteined thereunto. I will tell you, quoth she, and tell you a troth, which perchance ye will meruell at, One of the greatest benefites, that euer God gaue me, is, that he sent me so sharpe and seuere Parentes, and so ientle a scholemaster. For whe I am in presence either of father or mother, whether I speake, kepe silence, sit, stand, or go, eate, drinke, be merie, or sad, be sowyng, plaiyng, dauncing, or doing anie thing els, I must do it, as it were, in soch weight, mesure, and number, euen so persitelie, as God made the world, or else I am so sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened, yea presentlie some tymes, with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies, which I will not name, for the honor I beare them, so without measure misordered, that I thinke my selfe in hell, till tyme cum, that I must go to M. Elmer, who teacheth me so ientlie, so pleasantlie, with soch faire allurementes to learning, that I thinke all the tyme nothing, whiles I am with him. And when I am called from him, I fall on w eeping, because, what soeuer I do els, but learning, is ful of grief, trouble, feare, and whole misliking vnto me: And thus my booke, hath bene so moch my pleasure, & bringeth dayly to me more pleasure & more, that in respect of it, all other pleasures, in very deede, be but trifles and troubles vnto me. I remember this talke gladly, both bicause it is so worthy of memorie, & bicause also, it was the last talke that euer I had, and the last tyme, that euer I saw that noble and worthie Ladie. I could be ouer long, both in thewinge iust causes, and in recitinge trewe examples, why learning shold be taught, rather by loue than feare. He that wold s ee a persite discourse 86 Sirach, for sharpe kepinge in, and bridleinge of youth, are ment rather, for fatherlie correction, then masterlie beating, rather for maners, than for learninge: for other places, than for scholes. For God forbid, but all euill touches, wantonnes, lyinge, pickinge, slouthe, will, stubburnnesse, and disobedience, shold be with sharpe chastisemet, daily cut away. aecians, and old Romanes, as both appeare in Aristophanes, Isocrates, children were vnder the rule of three persones: Pr aeceptore, Poedagogo, `Parente :  88 the scholemaster taught him learnyng withall ientlenes: the Gouernour corrected his maners, with moch sharpenesse:  89 The father, held the sterne of his whole obedience: And so, he that vsed to teache, did not commolie vse to beate,  90  but remitted that ouer to an other mans charge. But what shall we saie, whan now in our dayes, the scholemaster is vsed, both for Pr aeceptor in learnyng, and Poedagogus in manres. Surelie, I wold he shold not cofound their offices, but discretelie vse the dewtie of both so, that neither ill touches shold be left vnpunished, nor ientlesse in teaching anie wise omitted. And he shall well do both, if wiselie he do appointe diuersitie of tyme, & separate place, for either purpose: vsing  91 alwaise soch discrete moderation, as the scholehouse should be counted a sanctuarie against feare: and verie well learning, a common perdon for ill doing, if the fault, of it selfe be not ouer heinous. And thus the children, kept vp in Gods feare, and preserued by his grace, finding paine in ill doing, and pleasure in well studiyng, shold easelie be brought to honestie of life, and persitenes of learning, the onelie marke, that good and wise fathers do wishe and labour, that their children, shold most buselie, and carefullie shot at. 92 There is an other discommoditie, besides crueltie in scholemasters in beating away the loue of learning from childre, which hindreth learning and vertue, and good bringing vp of youth, and namelie yong ientlemen, verie moch in England. This fault is cleane contrary to the first. I wished before, to haue loue of learning bred vp in children: I wishe as moch now, to haue yong men brought vp in good order of liuing, and in some more seuere discipline, the commonlie they be. We haue lacke in England of soch good order,  93 of xxi, yeare, were brought vp in learnyng, and exercises of labor, and that in soch place, where they should, neither s ee that was vncumlie, nor heare that was vnhonest. Yea, a yong ientlema was neuer free, to go where he would, and do what he lifte him self, but vnder the kepe, and by the counsell, of some graue gouernour, vntill he was, either maryed, or cald to beare some office in the common wealth. And see the great obedience, that was vsed in old tyme to fathers and gouernours. No sonne, were he neuer so old of yeares, neuer so great of birth, though he were a kynges sonne, might not mary, but by his father and mothers also consent. Cyrus the great, after he had conquered Babylon, and subdewed Riche king Cr aesus with whole Asia minor, cummyng tryunmphantlie home, his vncle Cyaxeris offered him his daughter to wife. Cyrus thanked his vncle, and praised the maide, but for mariage he answered him with thies wise and sw eete wordes, as they be vttered by Xenophon,  94 ὧ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ngr; ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/idiagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) , ἔ ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/otigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eetigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ,  ,  &c. that is to say: Vncle Cyaxeris, I commend the stocke, I like the maide, and I allow well the dowrie, but (sayth he) by the counsell and consent of my father and mother, I will determine farther of thies matters. not to hir, but went home to his father, and his mother, and desired both father and mother to make the mariage for him. Doth this modestie, doth this obedience, that was in great kyng Cyrus, and stoute Samson, remaine in our yongmen at this daie? no surelie: For we liue not longer after them by tyme, than we liue farre different from them by good order. Our tyme is so farre from that old discipline and obedience, as now, not onelie yong ientlemen, but euen verie girles dare without all feare, though not without open shame, where they lift, and how they lift, marie them selues in spite of father, mother, God, good order, and all. The cause of this euill is, that youth is least looked vnto, when they stand most neede of good kepe and regard. It auaileth not, to s ee them well taught in yong yeares, and after wha they cum to lust and youthfull dayes, to giue them licence to liue as they lust them selues. For, if ye suffer the eye of a yong Ientleman, once to be entangled with vaine fightes, and the care to be corrupted with fond or filthie taulke, the mynde shall quicklie fall seick, and sone vomet and cast vp, all the holesome doctrine, that he receiued in childhoode, though he were neuer so well brought vp before. And being ons inglutted with vanitie, he will streight way loth all learning, and all good counsell to the same. And the parentes for all their great cost and charge, reape onelie in the end, the frute of grief and care. 95 This euill, is not common to poore men, as God will haue it, but proper to riche and great mens children, as they deserue it. In d eede from seuen, to seuentene, yong ientlemen commonlie be carefullie enough brought vp: But from seuentene to seuen and twentie (the most dangerous tyme of all a mans life, and most slipperie to stay well in) they haue commonlie the reigne of all licens in their owne hand,  96 and speciallie soch as do liue in the Court. And that which is most to be merueled at, commonlie, the wisest and also best men, be found the fondest fathers in this behalfe. And if som good father wold seick some remedie herein, yet the mother (if the house hold of our Lady) had rather, yea, & will to, haue her sonne cunnyng & bold, in making him to lyue trimlie when he is yong, than by learning and trauell, to be able to serue his Prince and his contrie, both wiselie in peace, and stoutelie in warre, whan he is old. 97 The fault is in your selues, ye noble men sonnes, and therfore ye deserue the greater blame, that commonlie, the meaner mens children, cum to be, the wisest councellours, and greatest doers, in the weightie affaires of this Realme. And why? for God will haue it so, of his prouidence: bicause ye will haue it no otherwise, by your negligence. And God is a good God, & wisest in all his doinges, that will place vertue, & displace vice, in those kingdomes, where  98 he doth gouerne. For he knoweth, that Nobilitie, without vertue and wisedome, is bloud in deede, but bloud trewelie, without bones & sinewes: & so of it selfe, without the other, verie weeke to beare the burden of weightie affaires. The greatest shippe in d eede commonlie carieth the greatest burden, but yet alwayes with the greatest ieoperdie, not onelie for the persons and goodes committed vnto it, but euen for the shyyppe it selfe, except it be gouerned, with the greater wisedome. 99  But Nobilitie, gouerned by learning and wisedome, is in d eede, most like a faire shippe, hauyng tide  100 and winde at will, vnder the reule of a skilfull master: whan contrarie wise, a shippe, caried, yea with the hiost tide & greatest winde, lacking a skilfull master, most commonlie, doth either, sinck it selfe vpo sandes, or breake it selfe vpon rockes, And euen so, how manie  101 haue bene, either drowned in vaine pleasure, or ouerwhelmed by stout wilfulnesse, the histories of England be able  102 to affourde euer many examples vnto vs. Therefore, ye great and noble mens children, if ye will haue rightfullie that praise, and enioie surelie that place, which your fathers haue, and elders had, and left vnto you, ye must kepe it, as they gat it, and that is, by the onelie waie, of vertue, wisedome, and worthinesse. For wisedom, and vertue, there be manie faire examples in this Court, for yong Ientlemen to folow. But they be, like faire markes in the feild, out of a mans reach, to far of, to shote at well. The best and worthiest men, in d eede, be somtimes seen, but seldom taulked with all: A yong Ientleman, may somtime knele to their person, smallie vse their companie, for their better instruction. But yong Ientlemen ar faine commonlie to do in the Court, as yong Archers do in the feild: that is take soch markes, as be nie them, although they be neuer so foule to shote at. I m eene, they be driven to kepe companie with the  103 worste: and what force ill companie hath, to corrupt good wittes, the wisest men know best. And not ill companie onelie, but the ill opinion also of the most part, doth moch harme, and namelie of those, which 104 shold be wise in the trewe decyphring, of the good disposition of nature, of cumlinesse in Courtlie maners, and all right doinges of men. But error and phantastie, do commonlie occupie, the place of troth and iudgement. For, if a yong ientleman, be demeure and still of nature, they say, he is simple and lacketh witte: if he be bashefull, and will soone blushe, they call 105 in Cyrus, that his bashfulnes in youth, was ye verie trewe signe of his vertue & stoutnes after: If he be innocent and ignorant of ill, they say, he is rude, and hath no grace, so vngraciouslie do som gracelesse men, misuse the 106 faire and godlie word  G R A C E . But if ye would know, what grace they m eene, go, and looke, and learne emonges them, and ye shall see that it is: first, to blush at nothing. And blushyng in youth, sayth Aristotle is nothyng els, but feare to do ill: which feare beyng 107 once Instely fraid away from youth, the foloweth, to dare do any mischief, to cotemne stoutly any goodnesse, to be busie in euery matter, to be skilfull in euery thyng, to acknowledge no ignorance at all. To do thus in Court, is couted of some, the chief and greatest grace of all: and termed by the name 108 teacheth the cleane contrarie, and that most wittelie, 109 saying thus:  Audere, cum bonis etiam rebus coniunctum, per se ipsum est magnopere fugiendum . Which is to say, to be bold, yea in a good matter, is for it self, greatie to be exchewed. Moreouer, where the swing goeth, there to follow, fawne, 110 flatter, laugh and lie lustelie at other mens liking. To face, stand formest, shoue backe: and to the meaner man, or vnknowne in the Court, to s eeme somwhat solume, coye, big, and dangerous of looke, taulk, and answere: To thinke well of him selfe, to be lustie in contemning of others, to haue some trim grace in a priuie mock. And in greater presens, to beare a braue looke: to be warlike, though he neuer looked enimie in the face in warre: yet som warlike signe must be vsed, either a slouinglie busking, or an ouerstaring frounced hed, as though out of euerie heeres toppe, should suddenlie start out a good big othe, when nede requireth, yet praised be God, England hath at this time, manie worthie Capitaines 111 and good souldiours, which be in d eede, so honest of behauiour, so cumlie of conditions, so milde of maners, as they may be examples of good order, to a good sort of others, which neuer came in warre. But to retorne, where I left: In place also, to be able to raise taulke, and make discourse of euerie rishe: to haue a verie good will, to heare him selfe speake: To be seene in Palmestrie, wherby to conueie to chast  112 eares, som fond or filthie taulke: And, if som Smithfeild Ruffian take vp, som strange going: som new mowing with the mouth: som wrinchyng with the shoulder, som braue prouerbe: som fresh new othe, that is not stale, but will rin round in the mouth: som new disguised garment, or desperate hat, fond in facion, or gaurish in colour, what soeuer it cost, how small soeuer his liuing be, by what shift soeuer it be gotten, gotten must it be, and vsed with the first, or els the grace of it, is stale and gone: som part of this gracelesse grace, was discribed by me, in a litle rude verse long ago. To laughe, to lie, to flatter, to face: Foure waies in Court to win men grace. If thou be thrall to none of thiese, Away good Peekgoos, hens Iohn Cheese: Marke well my word, and marke their dede, And thinke this verse part of thy Crede. Would to God, this taulke were not trewe, and that som mens doinges were not thus: I write not to hurte any, but to proffit som: to accuse none, but to monish soch, who, allured by ill counsell, and folowing ill example, cotrarie 113 to their good bringyng vp, and against their owne good nature, yeld ouermoch to thies folies and faultes: I know many seruing men, of good order, and well 114 staide: And againe, I heare saie, there be som seruing men  115  116 writers, almost in euery commedie, no buthristie yong 118 man, that is not brought there vnto, by the sotle inticement of som lewd seruant. And euen now in our dayes Get ae and Daui, Gnatos and manie bold bawdie Phormios to, be 119 preasing in, to pratle on euerie stage, to medle in eucrie matter, whan honest Parmenos shall not be hard, but beare small swing with their masters. Their companie, their taulke, their ouer great experience in mischief, doth easelie corrupt the best natures, and best brought vp wittes. 120 But I meruell the lesse, that thies misorders be emonges som in the Court, for commonlie in the contrie also euerie where, innocencie is gone: Bashfulnesse is baninished: moch presumption in Yougthe: small authoritie in aige: Reuerence is neglected: dewties be confounded: and to be shorte, disobedience doth ouerflowe the bankes of good order, almoste in euerie place, almoste in euerie degr ee of man. Meane men haue eies to s ee, and cause to lament, and occasion to complaine of thies miseries: but other haue authoritie to remedie them, and will do so to, whan God shall think time fitte. For, all thies misorders, be Goddes iuste plages, by his sufferance, brought iustelie vpon vs, for our sinnes, which be infinite in nomber, and horrible in deede, but namelie, for the greate abhominable sin of vnkindnesse: but what, vnkindnesse; euen such vnkindnesse as was in  121 the Iewes, in contemninge Goddes voice, in shrinking fro his worde, in wishing backe againe for  Æegypt, in committing aduoultrie and hordom, not with the women, but with the doctrine of Babylon, did bring all the plages, destructions, and Captiuities, that fell so ofte and horriblie, vpon Israell. We haue cause also in England to beware of vnkindnesse, who haue had, in so fewe yeares, the Candel of Goddes woorde, so oft lightned, so oft put out, and yet will venture by our vnthankfulnesse in doctrine and sinfull life, to l eese againe, lighte, Candle, Candlesticke and all. 122 God keps vs in his feare, God grafte in vs the trewe knowledge of his woorde, with a forward will to folowe it, and so to bryng forth the sw eete fruites of it, & then shall he preserue vs by his Grace, from all maner of terrible dayes. good common lawes for the hole Realme, but also, (and perchance cheiflie) in obseruing priuate discipline euerie man carefullie in his own house: and namelie, if speciall regard 124 what is good, as in keping them from that, that is ill. Therefore, if wise fathers, be not as well waare in w eeding from their Children ill thinges, and ill companie, as 126 they were before, in graftinge in them learninge, and prouiding for them god scholemasters, what frute, they shall reape of all their coste & care, common experience doth tell. Here is the place, in yougthe is the time whan som ignorance 127 is as necessarie, as much knowlege, and not in matters of our dewtie towardes God, as som wilful wittes willinglie against their owne knowledge, perniciouslie, againste their owne conscience, haue of late openlie taught. In d eede  S. Chrysostome, that noble and eloquent Doctor, 128 wiselie faie, that ignorance therein is better than knowledge: But to wring this sentence, to wreste thereby out of mens handes, the knowledge of Goddes doctrine, is without all reason, against common sence, contrarie to the iudgement also of them, which be the discretest men, and best learned, on their own side. 129 auncyent father of the primitiue chirch, either thought or wrote so. But this ignorance in yougthe, which I spake on, or 130 rather this simplicitie, or most trewlie, this innocencie, is that, which the noble  Persians, as wise Xenophon doth testifie, were so carefull, to br eede vp their yougth in. But Christian fathers commonlie do not so. And I will tell you a tale, as moch to be misliked, as the Persians example is to be folowed. This last somer, I was in a ientlemans house: where 131 a yong childe, somwhat past fower yeare olde, cold in no, wise frame his tonge, to fate, a litle shorte grace: and yet he could roundlie rap out, so manie vgle othes, and those of the newest facion, as som good man of fourescore yeare olde hath neuer hard named before: and that which was most detestable  132 of all, his father and mother wold laughe at it. I moche doubte, what comforte, an other daie, this childe shall bring into them. This Childe vsing moche the companie of seruinge men, and geuing good eare to their taulke, bid easelie learne, which he shall harolie forget, all daies of his life hereafter: So likewise, in the Courte, if a yong Ientleman will ventur himself into the companie of Ruffians, it is ouer greate a ieoperdie, lest, their facions, maners, thoughtes, taulke, and d eedes, will verie sone, be euer like.  133 The confounding of companies, breedeth confusion of good maners both in the Courte, and euerie where else. And it maie be a great wonder, but a greater shame, to vs Christian men, to vnderstand, what a heithen writer, 134 Isocrates, both leaue in memorie of writing, concerning the care, that the noble Citie of Athens had, to bring vp their yougthe, in honest companie, and vertuous discipline, whose taulke in Greke, is, to this effect, in Englishe. 135 " The Citie, was not more careful, to s ee their Children well taughte, than to see their yong men well gouerned: which they brought to passe, not so much by common lawe, as by priuate discipline. For, they had more regard, that their yougthe, by good order shold not offend, than how, by lawe, they might be punished: And if offense were committed, there was, neither waie to hide it, neither hope of pardon for it. Good natures, were not so moche openlie praised as they were secretlie marked, and watchfullie regarded, lest they should lease the goodnes they had. Therefore in scholes of singing and dauncing, and other honest exercises, gouernours were appointed, more diligent to ouers ee their good maners, than their masters were, to teach them anie learning. It was som shame to a yong man, to be seene in the open market: and if for businesse, he passed throughe it, he did it, with a meruelous modestic, and bashefull facion. To eate, or drinke in a Tauerne, was not onelie a shame, but also punishable, in a yong man. To contrarie, or to stand in termes with an old man, was more heinous, than in som place, to rebuke and scolde with his owne father:" with manie other mo good orders, and faire disciplines, which I referre to their reading, that haue lust to look vp on the description of such a worthie common welthe. And to know, what worthie frute, did spring of soch 136 worthie seade, I will tell yow the most meruell of all, and yet soch a trothe, as no man shall denie it, except such as be ignorant in knowledge of the best stories. Athens, by this discipline and good ordering of yougthe, 137 did br eede vp, within the circute of that one Citie, within the compas of one hundred yeare, within the memorie of one mans life, so manie notable Capitaines in warre, for worthinesse, wisdome and learning, as be searse matchable no, not in the state of Rome, in the compas of those seauen 138 hondred yeares, whan it florished moste. And bicause, I will not onelie saie it, but also proue it, the names of them be these. Miltiades, Themistocles,  139 Xantippus, Pericles, Cymon, Alcybiades, Thrasybulus, Conon, Iphicrates, Xenophon, Timotheus, Theopompus, Demetrius and diuers other mo: of which euerie one, maie iustelie be spoken that worthie praise, which was geuen to Scipio Africanus, who, Cicero douteth, whether he were, more noble Capitaine in warre, or more eloquent and wise councelor in peace. And if ye beleue not me, read diligentlie, Æemilius Probus in Latin, and Plutarche . Greke, which two, bad no cause either to flatter or lie vpon anie of those which I haue recited. 141 And beside nobilitie in warre, for excellent and matcheles masters in all maner of learninge, in that one Citie, in memorie of one aige, were mo learned men, and that in a maner altogether, than all tyme doth remember, than all place both affourde, than all other tonges do conteine. And I do not m eene of those Authors, which, by iniurie of tyme, by negligence of men, by crueltie of fier and sworde, be lost, but euen of those, which by Goddes grace, are left yet vnto vs: of which I thank God, euen my poore studie lacketh not one. As, in Philosophie,  Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Euclide and Theophrast : In eloquens and Ciuill lawe, Demosthenes,  Æeschines, Lycurgus, Dinarchus, Demades, Isocrates, Isaeus, Lysias, Antisthenes, Andocides : In histories, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon : and which we lacke, to oure great losse, Theopompus and Eph : In poetrie, Æeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and somwhat of Menander, Demosthenes sister sonne. Now, let Italian, and Latin it self, Spanishe, French, 142 Douch, and Englishe bring forth their lerning, and recite their Authors, Cicero onelie excepted, and one or two moe in Latin, they be all patched, cloutes and ragges, in comparison of faire wouen broade clothes. And trewelie, if there be any good in them, it is either lerned, borowed, or stolne, from some one of those worthie wittes of Athens. The remembrance of soch a common welthe, vsing soch discipline and order for yougthe, and thereby bringing forth to their praise, and leaning to vs for our example, such Capitaines for warre, soch Councelors for peace, and matcheles masters, for all kinde of learninge, is pleasant for me to recite, and not irksum, I trust, for other to heare, except it be soch, as make neither counte of vertue nor learninge. And whether, there be anie soch or no, I can not well 143 .tell: yet I heare saie, some yong Ientlemen of oures, count it their shame to be counted learned: and perchance, they count it their shame, to be counted honest also, for I hears saie, they medle as litle with the one, as with the other. A meruelous case, that Ientlemen shold so be ashamed of good learning, and neuer a whit ashamed of ill maners: soch do laie for them, that the Ientlemen of France do so: which is a lie, as God will haue it. Lang aeus, and Bell aeus that be 144 dead,  & the noble  Vidam of Chartres, that is a liue, and infinite mo in France, which I heare tell of, proue this to be most false. And though som, in France, which will nedes be Ientlemen, whether men will or no, and haue more ientleshipe in their hat, than in their hed, be at d eedlie feude, with both learning and honestie, yet I beleue, if that noble Prince, king Francis neither place in his Courte, no; pension in his warres, if he had knowledge of them. This opinion is not French, but plaine Turckishe: from whens, som Frenche fetche moe faultes, than this: which, I praie God, kepe out of England, and send also those of oures better mindes, which bend them selues againste vertue and learninge, to the contempte of God, dishonor of their contrie to the hurt of manie others, and at length, to the greatest harme, and vtter destruction of themselues. Som other, hauing better nature, but lesse witte, (for ill commonlie, haue ouer moch witte) do not vtterlie dispraise learning, but they saie, that without learning, common 146 experience, knowledge of all facions, and haunting all companies, shall worke in yougthe, both wisdome, and habilitie, to execute anie weightie affaire. Surelie long experience both proffet moch, but moste, and almost onelie to him (if we m eene honest affaires) that is diligentlie before instructed with preceptes of well doinge. For good precepts of learning, be the eyes of the minde, to looke wiselie before a man, which waie to go right, and which not.  Learning teacheth more in one yeare than experience 147 in twentie: And learning teacheth safelie, when experience  148 maketh mo miserable then wife. He hasardeth sore, that wareth wise by experience. An vnhappie Master he is, that is made cunning by manie shippe wrakes: A miserable merchant, that is neither riche nor wise, but after som bankroutes. It is costlie wisdom, that is bought by experience. We know by experience it selfe, that it is a meruelous paine, to finde oute but a short waie, by long wandering. And surelie, he that wold proue wise by experience, he maie be wittie in d eede, but euen like a swift runner, that runneth fast out of his waie, and vpon the night, he knoweth not whither. And verilie they be fewest of number, that be happie or wise by vnlearned experience. And looke well vp, on the former life of those fewe, whether your example be old or yonge, who without learning haue gathered, by long experience, a litle wisdom, and som happines: and whan you do consider, what mischeife they haue committed, what dangers they haue escaped (and yet xx. for one, do perishe in the aduenture) than thinke well with your selfe, whether ye wold, that your owne son, shold cum to wisdom and Happines, by the waie of soch experience or no. 149 Iustice, wold tell of him selfe. Whan he was Auncient in Inne of Courte. Certaine yong Ientlemen were brought before him, to be corrected for certaine misorders: And one of the lustiest saide: Syr, we be yong ientlemen, and wisemen before vs, haue proued all facions, and yet those haue done full well: this they said, because it was well knowen, that Syr Roger had bene a good feloe in his yougth. But he aunswered them verie wiselie. In d eede saith he, in yougthe, I was, as you ar now: and I had twelue feloes like vnto my self, but not one of them came to a good ende. And therfore, folow not my example in yougth, but folow my councell in aige, if euer ye thinke to cum to this place, or to thies yeares, that I am cum vnto, lesse ye meete either with pouertie or Tiburn in the way. 150 Thus, experience of all facions in yougthe, beinge, in profe, alwaise dangerous, in isshue, seldom luckie, is a waie, in de ede, to ouermoch knowledge, yet vsed commonlie of soch men, which be either caried by som curious affection of mynde, or driuen by som hard necessitie of life, to hasard the triall of ouer manie perilous aduentures. Erasmus the honor of learning of all oure time, saide 151 wiselie that experience is the common scholehouse of foles, 152 . and ill men: Men, of witte and honestie, be otherwise instructed. For there be, that kepe them out of fier, and yet was neuer burned: That beware of water, and yet was neuer nie drowninge: That hate harlottes, and was neuer at the stewes: That abhorre falshode, and neuer brake promis themselues. But will ye s ee, a fit Similitude of this aduentured experience. A Father, that doth let louse his son, to all experiences, is most like a fond Hunter, that letteth slippe a whelpe to the hole herde. Twentie to one, he shall fall vpon a rascall, and let go the faire game. Men that hunt so, be either ignorant persones, preuie stealers, or night walkers. Learning therefore, ye wise fathers, and good bringing vp, and not blinde & dangerous experience, is the next and readiest waie, that must leede your Children, first, to wisdom, and than to worthinesse, if euer ye purpose they shall cum there. And to saie all in shorte, though I lacke Authoritie to giue counsell, yet I lacke not good will to wisshe, that the 153 yougthe in England, speciallie Ientlemen, and namelie nobilitie, shold be by good bringing vp, so grounded in iudgement of learninge, so founded in loue of honestie, as, whan they shold be called forthe to the execution of great affaires, in seruice of their Prince and centrie, they might be hable, to vse and to order, all experiences, were they good were they bad, and that, according to the square, rule, and line,  154 of wisdom learning and vertue. And, I do not m eene, by all this my taulke, that yong Ientlemen, should alwaies be poring on a booke, and by vsing good studies, should lease honest pleasure, and haunt no good pastime, I m eene nothing lesse: For it is well knowne, that I both like and loue, and haue alwaies, and do yet still vse, all exercises and pastimes, that be fitte for my nature and habilitie. And beside naturall disposition, in iudgement also, I was neuer, either Stoick in doctrine, or Anabaptist in Religion, to mislike a merie, pleasant, and plaifull nature, if no outrage be committed, against lawe, mesure, and good order. Therefore, I wold wishe, that, beside some good time, fitlie appointed, and constantlie kepte, to encrease by readinge, the knowledge of the tonges and learning, yong ientlemen shold vse, and delite in all Courtelie exercises, and Ientlemanlike pastimes. And good cause whie: For the self 155 same noble Citie of Athenes, iustlie commended of me before, did wiselie and vpon great consideration, appoint, the Muses,  Apollo, and Pallas, to be patrones of learning to 156 shooting, and Author of cunning playing vpo Instrumentes: 158 Pallas also was Laidie misrtes in warres. Wherbie was nothing else ment, but that learninge shold be alwaise mingled, with honest mirthe, and cumlie exercises: and that warre also should be gouerned by learning, and moderated by wisdom, as did well appeare in those Capitaines of Athenes named by me before, and also in Scipio & C aesar, the two Diamondes of Rome. 159 And  Pallas, was no more feared, in w eering Æegida. tha she was praised, for chosing Oliua: whereby shineth the glory of learning, which thus, was Gouernour & Mistres, in the noble Citie of Athenes, both of warre and peace. Therefore, to ride cumlie: to run faire at the tilte or 160 ring: to plaie at all weapones: to shote faire in bow, or surlie in gon: to vant lustely: to runne: to leape: to wrestle: to swimme: To daunce cumlie: to sing, and playe of instrumentes cunnyngly: to Hawke: to hunte: to playe at tennes,  & all pastimes generally, which be ioyned with labor, vsed in open place, and on the day light, conteining either some fitte exercise for warre, or some pleasant pastime for peace, be not onelie cumlie and decent, but also verie necessarie, for a Courtlie Ientleman to vse. But, of all kinde of pastimes, fitte for a Ientleman, I will, godwilling, in fitter place, more at large, declare fullie, in my booke of the Cockpitte: which I do write, to satisfie 161 som, I trust, with som reason, that be more curious, in marking other mens doinges, than carefull in mendyng their owne faultes. And som also will nedes busie them selues in merueling, and adding thereunto vnfrendlie taulke, why I, a man of good yeares, and of no ill place, I thanke God and my Prince, do make choise to spend soch tyme in writyng of trifles, as the schole of shoting, the Cockpitte, and this booke of the first Principles of Grammer, rather, than to take some weightie matter in hand, either of Religion, or Ciuill discipline.  Wise men I know, will well allow of my choise herein: and as for such, who haue not witte of them selues, but must learne of others, to indge right of mens doynges, let them read that wise Poet Horace in his Arte Poetica , who  162 willeth wisemen to beware, of hie and loftie Titles. For, great shippes, require costlie tackling, and also afterward dangerous gouernment: Small boates, be neither verie chargeable in makyng, nor verie oft in great ieoperdie: and yet they cary many tymes, as good and costlie ware, as greater vessels do. A meane Argument, may easelie beare, the  163 light burden of a small faute, and haue alwaise at hand, a ready excuse for ill handling: And, some praise it is, if it so chaunce, to be better in d eede, than a man dare venture to seeme. A hye title, both charge a man, with the heauie burden, of to great a promise: and therfore sayth  Horace wittelie, that, that Poete was a verie foole, that began 165 hys booke, with a goodlie verse in d eede, but ouer proude a promise. Fortunam Priami cantabo & nobile bellum , And after, as wiselie. Qurant o rectius hic, qui nil molitur inepte. &c. of one harlot, and of one good wife, did vtter so moch learning in all kinde of sciences, as, by the iudgement of Quintilian, he deserueth so hie a praise, that no man yet deserued to sit in the second degr ee beneth him. And thus moch out of my way, concerning my purpose in spending penne, and paper, & tyme, vpo trifles, & namelie to aunswere some, that haue neither witte nor learning, to de any thyng them selues, neither will nor honestie, to say well of other. To ioyne learnyng with cumlie exercises, Conto Baldesar Castiglione in his booke, Cortegiane , doth trimlie teache:  167 which booke, aduisedlie read, and diligentlie folowed, but one yeare at home in England, would do a yong ientleman more good, I wisse, then thr ee yeares trauell abrode spent in Italie. And I meruell this booke, is no more read in the Court, than it is, seyng it is so well translated into English by a worthie Ientleman syr  Th. Hobbie, who was many 168 wayes well furnished with learning, and very expert in knowledge of diuers tonges. And beside good preceptes in bookes, in all kinde of tonges, this Court also neuer lacked many faire examples, for yong ientlemen to folow: And surelie, one example, is 169 more valiable, both to good and ill, than xx. preceptes written in bookes: and so  Plato, not in one or two, but diuerse places, doth plainlie teach. 170 soch a rase of worthie learned ientlemen, as this Realme neuer yet did affourde. And, in the second degr ee, two noble Primeroses of Nobilitie,  171 the yong Duke of Suffolke, and Lord  H. Matreuers, were such two examples to the Court for learnyng, as our tyme may rather wishe, than looke for agayne. do know, that, not so much the good statutes, as two Ientlemen, of worthie memorie Syr Iohn Cheke, and Doctour 172 . Readman, by their onely example of excellency in learnyng, of godlynes in liuyng, of diligecie in studying, of councell 173 in exhorting, of good order in all thyng, did br eed vp, so many learned men, in that one College of S. Iohns, at one time, as I beleue, the whole Vniuersitie of Louaine, in many yeares, was neuer able to affourd. Present examples of this present tyme, I list not to touch: yet there is one example, for all the Ientlemen of this 174 Court to folow, that may well satisfie them, or nothing will serue them, nor no example moue them, to goodnes and learnyng. It is your shame, (I speake to you all, you yong Ientlemen of England) that one mayd should go beyond you all, in excellencie of learnyng, and knowledge of diuers tonges. Pointe forth sir of the best giuen Ientlemen of this Court, and all they together, shew not so much good will, spend not so much tyme, bestow not so many houres, dayly orderly, & constantly, for the increase of learning & knowledge, as both the Quaenes Maiestie her selfe. Yea I beleue, that beside her perfit readines, in Latin, Italian, French, & Spanish, she readeth here now at Windsore more Gr eeke euery day, than some Prebendarie of this Chirch doth read Latin in a whole w eeke. And that which is most praise worthie of all, within the walles of her priuie chamber, she hath obteyned that excellencie of learnyng, to vnderstand, speake, & write, both wittely with head, and faire with hand, as scarse one or two rare wittes in both the Vniuersities haue in many yeares reached vnto. Amongest all the benefites yt God hath blessed me with all, next the knowledge of Christes true Religion, I counte this the greatest, that it pleased God to call me, to be one poore minister in settyng forward these excellent giftes of learnyng in this most excellent Prince. Whose onely example, it the rest of our nobilitie would folow, than might England be, for learnyng and wisedome 175 in nobilitie, a spectacle to all the world beside. But s ee the mishap of men: The best examples haue neuer such forse to moue to any goodnes, as the bad, vaine, light and fond, haue to all ilnes. And one example, though out of the compas of learning, yet not out of the order of good maners, was notable in this Courte, not fullie xxiiij. yeares a go, when all the actes of Parlament, many good Proclamations, diuerse strait commaundementes, sore punishment openlie, speciall regarde priuatelie, cold not do so much to take away one misorder, as the example of one big one of this Courte did, still to kepe vp the same: The memorie whereof, doth yet remaine, in a common prouerbe of Birching lane. 176 Take hede therfore, ye great ones in ye Court, yea though ye be ye greatest of all, take hede, what ye do, take hede how ye liue, For as you great ones vse to do, so all meane men loue to do. You be in d eed, makers or marrers, of all mens maners within the Realme. For though God hath placed yow, to be cheife in making of lawes, to beare greatest authoritie, to commaund all others: yet God doth order, that all your lawes, all your authoritie, all your commaundementes, do not halfe so much with meane men, as doth  177 your example and maner of liuinge. And for example euen in the greatest matter, if yow your selues do serue God gladlie and orderlie for conscience sake, not coldlie, and somtyme for maner sake, you carie all the Courte with yow, and the whole Realme beside, earnestlie and orderlie to do the same. If yow do otherwise, yow be the onelie authors, of all misorders in Religion, not onelie to the Courte, but to all England beside. Infinite shall be made cold in Religion by your example, that neuer were hurt by reading of bookes. And in meaner matters, if thr ee or foure great ones in  178 Courte, will nedes outrage in apparell, in huge hose, in monstrous hattes, in gaurishe colers, let the Prince Proclame, make Lawes, order, punishe, commaunde euerie gate in London dailie to be watched, let all good men beside do euerie where what they can, surelie the misorder of apparell in mean men abrode, shall neuer be amended, except the greatest in Courte will order and mend them selues first. I know, som greate and good ones in Courte, were authors, that honest Citizens of London, should watche at euerie gate, to take misordered persones in apparell. I know, that honest Londoners did so: And I sawe, which I sawe than, & reporte now with som greife, that som Courtlie men were offended with these good men of London. And that, which greued me most of all, I sawe the verie same tyme, for all theis good orders, commaunded from the Courte and executed in London, I sawe I say, cum out of London, euen vnto the presence of the Prince, a great rable  179 of meane and light persones, in apparell, for matter, against lawe, for making, against order, for facion, namelie hose, so without all order, as he thought himselfe most braue, that durst do most in breaking order and was most monsterous in misorder. And for all the great commaundementes, that came out of the Courte, yet this bold misforder, was winked at, and borne withall, in the Courte. I thougth, it was not well, that som great ones of the Court, durst declare themselues offended, with good men of London, for doinge their dewtie, & the good ones of the Courte, would not shew themselues offended, with ill men of London, for breaking good order. I fownde thereby a sayinge of Socrates to be most trewe that ill men be more hastie, than good men be forwarde, to prosecute their purposes, euen as Christ himselfe saith, of the Children of light and darknes. Beside apparell, in all other thinges to, not so moch, good lawes and strait commaundementes as the example and maner of liuing of great men, doth carie all meane men euerie where, to like, and louc, & do, as they do. For if but two or three noble men in the Court, wold but beginne  180 to shoote, all yong Ientlemen, the whole Court, all London, the whole Realme, wold straight waie exercise shooting. What praise shold they wynne to themselues, what commoditie shold they bring to their contrey, that would thus deserue to be pointed at: Beholde, there goeth, the author of good order, the guide of good men. I cold say more, and yet not ouermoch. But perchance, som will say, I haue stepte to farre, out of my schole, into the common welthe, from teaching a yong scholer, to monishe greate and noble men: yet I trust good and wise men will thinke 181 and iudge of me, that my minde was, no so moch, to be busie and bold with them, that be great now, as to giue trewe aduise to them, that may be great hereafter. Who, if they do, as I wishe them to do, how great so euer they be now, by blood and other mens meanes, they shall becum a greate deale greater hereafter, by learninge, vertue, and their owne desertes: which is trewe praise, right worthines, and verie Nobilitie in d eede. Yet, if som will needes presse me, that I am to bold with great men, & stray to farre from my matter, I will aunswere them with  S. Paul, siue 182 per contetionem, siue quocunq modo, mod o Christus praedicetur , &c. euen so, whether in place, or out of place, with my matter, or beside my matter, if I can hereby either prouoke the good, or staye the ill, I shall thinke my writing herein well imployed. But, to cum downe, from greate men, and hier matters, to my litle children, and poore scholehouse againe. I will, God willing, go forwarde orderlie, as I purposed, to instruct Children and yong men, both for learninge and maners. Hitherto, I haue shewed, what harme, ouermoch feare bringeth to children: and what hurte, ill companie, and ouermoch libertie br eedeth in yougthe: meening thereby, that from seauen yeare olde, to seauentene, loue is the best allurement to learninge: from seauentene to seauen and twuentie, that wise men shold carefullie see the steppes of yougthe surelie staide by good order, in that most slipperie tyme: and speciallie in the Courte, a place most dangerous for yougthe to liue in, without great grace, good regarde, and diligent looking to. sayd in the begynnynge, in the Qu eenes priuie Chamber at Windesore, after he had talked  183 with me, for the right choice of a good witte in a child for learnyng, and of the trewe difference betwixt quicke and hard wittes, of alluring yong children by ientlenes to loue learnyng, and of the speciall care that was to be had, to keepe yong men from licencious liuyng, he was most earnest with me, to haue me say my mynde also, what I thought, concernyng the fansie that many yong Ientlemen of England haue to trauell abroad, and namely to lead a long lyfe in Italie. His request, both for his authoritie, and good will toward me, was a sufficient commundement onto me, to satisfie his pleasure, with vtteryng plainlie my opinion in that matter. Syr quoth I, I take goyng thither, and liuing there, for a yonge ientleman, that doth not goe vnder the kepe and garde of such a man, as both, by wisedome can, and authoritie dare rewle him, to be maruelous dangerous. And whie I said so than, I will declare at large now: which I said than priuatelie, and write now openlie, not bicause I do contemne, either the knowledge of strange and diuerse tonges, and namelie the Italian  184 tonge, which next the Greeke and Latin tonge, I like and loue aboue all other: or else bicause I do despise, the learning that is gotten, or the experience that is gathered in strange contries: or for any priuate malice that I beare to Italie: which contrie, and in it, namelie Rome, I haue  185 alwayes speciallie honored: bicause, tyme was, whan Italie and Rome, haue bene, to the greate good of vs that now 186 liue, the best br eeders and bringers vp, of the worthiest men, not onelie for wise speakinge, but also for well doing, in all Ciuill affaires, that euer was in the worlde. But now, that tyme is gone, and though the place remayne, yet the olde and present maners, do differ as farre, as blacke and white, as vertue and vice. Vertue once made that contrie Mistres ouer all the worlde. vice now maketh that contrie staue to them, that before, were glad to serue it. All men s eeth it: They themselues confesse it, namelie soch, as be best and wisest amongest them. For sinne, by lust and vanitie, hath and doth breed vp euery where, common contept of Gods word, priuate contention in many families, open factions in euery Citie: and so, makyng them selues bonde, to vanitie and vice at home, they are content to beare the yoke of seruyng straungers abroad. Italie now, is not that Italie, that it was wont to be: and therfore now, not so fitte a place, as some do counte it, for yong men to fetch either wisedome or honestie from thence. For furelie, they will make other but bad Scholers, that be so ill Masters to them selues. Yet, if a ientleman will nedes trauell into Italie, he shall do well, to looke on the life, of the wisest traueler, that euer traueled thether, set out by the wisest writer, that euer spake with tong, Gods doctrine onelie excepted: and that is 187 Vlysses in Homere. Vlysses, and his trauell, I wishe our 188 trauelers to looke vpon, not so much to feare them, with the great daungers, that he many tymes suffered, as to instruct them, with his excellent wisedome, which he alwayes and euerywhere vsed. Yea euen those, that be learned and wittie trauelers, when they be disposed to prayse traueling, as a great commendacion, and the best Scripture they haue for it, they gladlie recite the third verse of Homere, in his first booke of Odyssea, conteinyng a great prayse of Vlysses, for 189 the witte he gathered,  & wisedome he vsed in his traueling. Which verse, bicause, in mine opinion, it was not made at the first, more naturallie in Greke by Homere, nor after turned more aptelie into Latin by Horace, than it was a good while ago, in Cambrige, translated into English, both plainlie for the sense, and roundlie for the verse, by one of the best Scholers, that euer S. Iohns Colledge bred, M. Watson, myne old frend, somtime Bishop of Lincolne, therfore, for their sake, that haue lust to s ee, how our English tong, in auoidyng barbarous ryming, may as well receiue, right quantitie of sillabes, and trewe order of verifiyng (of which matter more at large hereafter) as either Greke or Latin, if a cunning man haue it in handling, I will set forth that one verse in all thr ee tonges, for an Example to good wittes, that shall delite in like learned exercise. ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἴ ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἄ ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ἔ  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) .

For, he shall not alwayes in his absence out of England, light vpon a ientle  Alcynous, and walke 193 in his faire gardens full of all harmelesse pleasures: but he shall sometymes, fall, either into the handes of some cruell Cyclops, or into the lappe 194 of some wanton and dalying Dame  Calypso: and 195 so suffer the danger of many a deadlie Denne, not so full of perils, to distroy the body, as, full of vayne  196 pleasures, to poyson the mynde. Some  Siren shall sing him a song, sw eete in tune, but sownding in  197 the ende, to his vtter destruction. If  Scylla drowne him not, Some  Circes shall make him, of a plaine English 199  place, is he likelie to go: from whence is hard returning, although one Vlysses, and that by Pallas ayde, and good cousell of Tiresias, once escaped that horrible Den of deadly darkenes. do it wiselie, vnder the kepe and garde of him, who, by his wisedome and honestie, by his example and authoritie, may be hable to kepe them safe and sound, in the feare of God, in Christes trewe Religion, in good order and honestie of liuyng: except they will haue them run headling, into ouermany ieoperdies, as Vlysses had done many tymes, if Pallas had not alwayes gouerned him: if he had 201 not vsed, to stop his eares with ware: to bind him selfe to the mast of his shyp: to f ede dayly, vpon that swete herbe Moly 202 Poete Homer ment couertlie (as wise and Godly men do iudge) that loue of honestie, and hatred of ill, 204 agaynst all inchantementes of sinne. I know diuerse noble personages, and many worthie Ientlemen of England, whom all the Siren songes of Italie, could neuer vntwyne from the maste of Gods word: nor no inchantment of vanitie, ouerturne them, from the feare of God, and loue of honestie. But I know as many, or mo, and some, sometyme my deare frendes, for whose sake I hate going into that coutrey the more, who, partyng out of England feruent in the loue of Christes doctrine, and well furnished with the feare of God, returned out of Italie worse transfformed, than euer was any in Circes Court. I know diuerse, that went out of England, men of innocent life, men of excellent learnyng, who returned out of Italie, not onely with worse maners, but also with lesse learnyng: neither so willing to liue orderly, nor yet so hable to speake learnedlie, as they were at worthy traueler him selfe, telleth the cause why. He went into Sicilia, a coutrey, no nigher Italy by site of place, the Italie that is now, is like Sicilia that was the, in all corrupt maners and liceciousnes of life. Plato found in Sicilia, euery Citie full of vanitie, full of factions, euen as Italie is now. And as Homere, like a learned Poete, doth feyne, that Circes, by pleasant inchantmetes, did turne men into beastes, some into Swine, som into Asses, some into Fores, 205 plainlie declare, that pleasure, by licentious vanitie, that sw eete and perilous poyson of all youth, both ingender in all those, that yeld vp themselues to her, soure notorious properties. 1.   ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif)  [illeg.] .  206 --- 2.   ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . 3.   ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif)  . 4.

The first, forgetfulnes of all good thinges learned before: the second, dulnes to receyue either learnyng or honestie 207 euer after: the third, a mynde embracing lightlie the worse opinion, and baren of discretion to make trewe difference betwixt good and ill, betwixt troth, and vanitie, the fourth, a proude disdainfulnes of other good me, in all honest matters.  Homere and Plato, haue both one meanyng, looke both to one end. For, if a ma inglutte him selfe with vanitie, or walter 208 in filthines like a Swyne, all learnyng, all goodnes, is sone forgotten. Than, quicklie shall he becum a dull Asse, to vnderstand either learnyng or honestie: and yet shall he be as sutle as a Fore, in br eedyng of mischief, in bringyng in  209 misorder, with a buste head, a discoursing tog, and a factious  210 harte, in euery priuate affaire, in all matters of state, with  211 this pretie propertie, alwayes glad to commend the worse partie, and euer ready to defend the falser opinio. And why.  212 is sone caryed from right iudgement, to any fond opinion, in Religion, in Philosophie, or any other kynde of learning. 213 is pride in them selues, contempt of others, the very badge of all those that serue in Circes Court. The trewe m eenyng of both Homer and Plato, the vame & vicious life of the Israelites. This people (sayth he) be fooles and dulhedes to all goodnes, but sotle, cunning and bolde, in any mischiefe. &c. licencious pleasure, the inticementes of all sinne, is, in Homere, the herbe Moly, with the blacke roote, and white flooer, sower at the first, but sw eete in the 215 the beginnyng, but in the end, easie and pleasant. And that, which is most to be marueled at, the diuine Poete 216 not found out by man, but giuen and taught by God. And for foms one sake, that will haue delite to read that sw eete and Godlie Verse, I will recite the very wordes of Homere and also turne them into rude English metre.

No mortall ma, with sweat of browe, or toile of minde, But onely God, who can do all, that herbe doth finde. Plato also, that diuine Philosopher, hath many Godly medicines agaynst the poyson of vayne pleasure, in many places, but specially in his Epistles to Dionisius the tyrant 218 seruyng of Circes, the Prophet Dauid, crieth most loude, Nolite fieri sicut eqaus & mulus : and by and by giueth  219 the right medicine, the trewe herbe  Moly, In camo & freno maxillas eorum constringe , that is to say, let Gods grace be the bitte, let Gods feare be the bridle, to stay them from runnyng headlong into vice, and to turne them into the right way agayne. Dauid in the second Psalme after, giueth 220 the same medicine, but in these plainer wordes, Diuerte a malo, & fac bonum . But I am affraide, that euer many of our trauelers into Italie, do not exchewe the way to  Circes Court: but go, and ryde, and runne, and flie thether, they make great hast to cum to her: they make great sute to serue her: yea, I could point out some with my finger, that neuer had gone out of England, but onelie to serue Circes, in Italie. Vanitie and vice, and any licence to ill liuyng in England was counted stale and rude vnto them. And so, beyng Mules and Horses before they went, returned verie Swyne and Asses home agayne: yet euerie where verie Fores with sutlie and busie heades: and where they may, 221 verie wolues, with cruell malicious hartes. A meruelous monster, which, for filthines of liuyng, for dulnes to learning him selfe, for wilinesse in dealing with others, for malice in hurting without cause, should carie at once in one bodie, the belie of a Swyne, the head of an Asse, the brayne of a Fore, the wombe of a wolfe. If you thinke, we iudge amisse, and write to sore against you, heare, what the  Italian  222 sayth of the English man, what the master reporteth of the scholer: who vttereth playnlie, what is taught by him, and what is learned by you, saying, Englese Italianato, e vn diabolo incarnato , that is to say, you remaine men in shape and facion, but becum deuils in life and condition. This is not, the opinion of one, for some priuate spite, but the iudgement of all, in a common Prouerbe, which riseth, of that learnyng, and those maners, which you gather in  Italie: a good Scholehouse of wholeso me 223 doctrine: and worthy Masters of commendable Scholers, where the Master had rather diffame hym selfe for hys teachyng, than not shame his Scholer for his learning. A good nature of the maister, and faire conditions of the scholers. And now chose you, you  Italian English men, whether you will be angrie with vs, for calling you monsters, or with the Italianes, for callyng you deuils, or else with your owne selues, that take so much paines, and go so farre, to make your selues both. If some yet do not well vnderstand, what is an Englishman Italianated, I will plainlie tell 224 him. He, that by liuing,  & traueling in  Italie, bringeth home into Englad out of Italie, the Religion, the learning, the policie, the experiece, the maners of Italie. That is to say, for 225 Religion, Papistrie or worse: for learnyng, lesse commonly than they caried out with them: for pollicie, a factious hart, a discoursing head, a mynde to medle in all mens matters: for experience, plentie of new. mischieues neuer knowne in England before: for maners, varietie of vanities, and chaunge of filthy lyuing. These be the inchantementes of  Circes, brought out of Italie, to marre mens maners in England: much, by example of ill life, but more by preceptes of fonde bookes, of late translated out of Italian into English, sold in euery 226 shop in London, commended by honest titles the soner to corrupt honest maners: dedicated ouer boldlie to vertuous and honorable personages, the easielier to begile simple and innocet wittes. It is pitie, that those, which haue authoritie and charge, to allow and dissalow bookes to be printed, be no more circumspect herein, than they are. Ten Sermons at Paules Crosse do not so moch good for mouyng me to trewe doctrine, as one of those bookes do harme, with inticing men to ill liuing. Yea, I say farder, those bookes, tend not so moch to corrupt honest liuyng, as they do, to subuert trewe Religion. No Papistes be made, by your mery bookes of Italie, than by your earnest bookes of Louain. And bicause our great Phisicians, do winke at the matter, and make no counte of this sore, I, though not admitted one of their felowshyp, yet hauyng bene many yeares a prentice to Gods trewe Religion, and trust to continewe a poore iorney man therein all dayes of my life, for the dewtie I owe, & loue I beare, both to trewe doctrine, and honest liuing, though I haue no authoritie to amend the sore my selfe, yet I will declare my good will, to discouer the sore to others. of the flesh, and frutes of sinne, this is spoken, no more trewlie for the doctrine, than sensiblie for the reason. And why for, ill doinges, br eed ill thinkinges. And of corrupted maners, spryng peruerted iudgementes.  228 And how, there be in man two speciall thinges: Mans will, mans mynde. Where will inclineth to goodnes, the mynde is bent to troth: Where will is caried from goodnes to vanitie, the mynde is sone drawne from troth to false opinion. And so, the readiest way to entangle the mynde with false doctrine, is first to intice the will to wanton liuyng. Therfore, when the busie and open Papistes abroad, could not, by their contentious bookes, turne men in England fast enough, from troth and right iudgement in doctrine, than the sutle and secrete Papistes at home, procured bawdie bookes to be translated out of the Italian tonge, whereby ouer many yong willes and wittes allured to wantonnes, do now boldly contemne all seuere bookes that sounde to honestie and godlines. In our forefathers tyme, whan Papistrie, as a standyng poole, couered and ouerflowed all England, fewe bookes were read in our tong, sauyng certaine bookes of Cheualrie, as they sayd, for pastime and pleasure, which, as some say, were made in Monasteries, by idle Monkes, or wanton Chanons: as one for example, Morte Arthure: the whole pleasure of which booke standeth in 229 two speciall poyntes, in open mans daughter, and bold bawdrye: In which booke those be counted the noblest Knightes, that do kill most men without any quarell, and commit fowlest aduoulteres by sutlest shiftes: as Sir Launcelote, with the wife of king Arthure his master: Syr Tristram of king Lote, that was his own aunte. This is good stuffe, for wise men to laughe at, or honest men to take pleasure at. Yet I know, when Gods Bible was banished the Court, and Morte Arthure receiued into the Princes chamber. What toyes, the dayly readyng of such a booke, may worke in the will of a yong ientleman, or a yong mayde, that liueth welthelie and idlelie, wise men can iudge, and honest me do pitie. And yet ten Morte Arthures do not the tenth part so much harme, as one of these bookes, made in Italie, and translated in England. They open, not fond and common wayes to vice, but such sutle, cunnyng, new, and diuerse shiftes, to cary yong willes to vanitie, and yong wittes to mischief, to teach old bawdes new schole poyntes, as the simple head of an English man is not hable to inuent, nor neuer was hard of in England before, yea when Papistrie ouerflowed all. Suffer these bookes to be read, and they shall soone displace all bookes of godly learnyng. For they, carying the will to vanitie, and marryng good maners, shall easily corrupt the mynde with ill opinions, and false iudgement in doctrine: first, to thinke ill of all trewe Religion, and at last to thinke nothyng of God hym selfe, one speciall pointe that is to be learned in Italie, and Italian bookes. And that which is most to be lamented, and therfore more nedefull to be looked to, there be moe of these vngratious bookes set out in Printe within these fewe monethes, than haue bene sene in England many score yeare before. And bicause our English men made Italians, can not hurt, but certaine persons, and in certaine places, therfore these Italian bookes are made English, to bryng mischief enough openly and boldly, to all states great and meane, yong and old, euery where. And thus yow see, how will intised to wantonnes, doth easelie allure the mynde to false opinions: and how corrupt maners in liuinge, breede false iudgement in doctrine: how sinne and fleshlines, bring forth sectes and heresies: And therefore suffer not vaine bookes to br eede vanitie in mens willes, if yow would haue Goddes trothe take roote in mens myndes. That Italian, that first inuented the Italian Prouerbe against our Englishe men Italianated, ment no more their 230 vanitie in liuing, than their lewd opinion in Religion: For, in calling them Deuiles, he carieth them cleane from God: and yet he carieth them no farder, than they willinglie go themselues, that is, where they may freely say their mindes, to the open contempte of God and all godlines, both in liuing and dostrine. Philosophie of Plato, but by a plaine troth of Goddes word, sensiblie vttered by Dauid thus. Thies men, abhominabiles facti in studijs suis , thinke verily, and singe gladlie the verse before, Dixit insipiens in Corde 231 suo, non est Deus : that is to say, they geuing themselues vp to vanitie, shakinge of the motions of Grace, driuing from them the feare of God, and running headlong into all sinne, first, lustelie contemne God, than scornefullie mocke his worde, and also spitefullie hate and hurte all well willers thereof. Than they haue in more reuerence, the triumphes of Petrarche: than the Genesis of Moses: They make more accounte of  Tullies offices than S. Paules epistles: of a tale in Bocace, than a storie of the Bible. Than they counte as fables, the holie misteries of Christian Religion. They make Christ and his Gospell, onelie serue Ciuill pollicie: Than neyther Religion cummeth amisse to them: In tyme they be Promoters of both openlie: in place againe mockers of both priuilie, as I wrote once in a rude ryme. Now new, now olde, now both, now neither, To serue the worldes course, they care not with whether . For where they dare, in cumpanie where they like, they boldlie laughe to scorne both protestant and Papist. They care for no scripture: They make no coute of generall councels: they contene the consent of the Chirch: They passe for no Doctores: They mocke the Pope: They raile on Luther: They allow neyther side: They like none, but onelie themselues: The marke they shote at, the ende they looke for, the heauen they desire, is onelie, their owne present pleasure, and priuate proffit: whereby, they plainlie declare, of whose schole, of what Religion they be: that is, Epicures in liuing, and ἄ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  in doctrine: this last worde, is no more vnknowne now to plaine Englishe men, than the Person was vnknown somtyme in England, vntill som Englishe man tooke peines, to fetch that deuelish opinion out of Italie. Thies men, thus Italianated abroad, can not abide our Godlie Italian Chirch at home: they be not of that Parish,  232 they be not of that felowshyp: they like not ye preacher: they heare not his sermons: Excepte somtymes for copanie, they cum thither, to heare the Italian tonge naturally spoken, not to heare Gods doctrine trewly preached. And yet, thies: men, in matters of Diuinitie, openlie pretend a great knowledge, and haue priuatelie to themselues, a verie compendious vnderstanding of all, which neuertheles they will vtter when and where they liste: And that is this: All the misteries of Moses, the whole lawe and Cerimonies, the Psalmes and Prophetes, Christ and his Gospell, G O D and the Deuill, Heauen and Hell, Faith, Conscience, Sinne, Death, and all they shortlie wrap vp, they quickly expounde with this one halfe verse of Horace. Yet though in Italie they may freely be of no Religion, as they are in England in verie deede to, neuerthelesse returning home into England they must countenance the profession of the one or the other, howsoeuer inwardlie, they laugh to scorne both. And though, for their priuate matters they can follow, fawne, and flatter noble Personages, contrarie to them in all respectes, yet commonlie they allie themselues with the worst Papistes, to whom they be wedded, and do well agr ee togither in three proper opinions: In  233 open contempte of Goddes worde: in a secret securitie of sinne: and in a bloodie desire to haue all taken away, by sword or burning, that be not of their faction. They that do read, with indifferent iudgement, Pygius and Machiauel,  234 two indifferent Patriarches of thies two Religions, do  235 know full well that I say trewe. Ye see, what manners and doctrine, our Englishe men fetch out of Italie: For finding no other there, they can bring no other hither. And therefore, manie godlie and excellent learned Englishe men, not manie yeares ago, did 236 make a better choice, whan open crueltie draue them out of this contrie, to place themselues there, where Christes doctrine, the feare of God, punishment of sinne, and discipline  237 of honestie, were had in speciall regarde. tyme, in one Citie, more libertie to sinne, than euer I hard tell of in our noble Citie of London in ix. yeare. I sawe, it was there, as free to sinne, not onelie without all punishment, but also without any mans marking, as it is free in the Citie of London, to chose, without all blame, whether a man lust to weare Shoo or pantocle. And good cause why: For being vnlike in troth of Religion, they must nedes be vnlike in honestie of liuing. For blessed be Christ, in our Citie of London, commonlie the commandementes 240 of God, be more diligentlie taught, and the seruice of God more reuerentlie vsed, and that daylie in many priuate mens houses, than they be in Italie once a weeke in their  241 common Chirches: where, masking Ceremonies, to delite the eye, and vaine soundes, to please the eare, do quite thrust out of the Chirches, all seruice of God in spirit and troth. Yea, the Lord Maior of London, being but a Ciuill officer,  242 is commonlie for his tyme, more diligent, in punishing sinne, the bent enemie against God and good order, than all 243 the bloodie Inquisitors in Italie be in seauen yeare. For, their care and charge is, not to punish sinne, not to amend manners, not to purge doctrine, but onelie to watch and ouersee that Christes trewe Religion set no sure footing, where the Pope hath any Iurisdiction. I learned, when I was at Venice, that there it is counted good pollicie, when  244 there be foure or fiue brethren of one familie, one, onelie to marie:  & all the rest, to waulter, with as litle shame, in open lecherie, as Swyne do here in the common myre. Yea, there be as sayre houses of Religion, as great prouision, as diligent officers, to kepe vp this misorder, as Bridewell is, and all the Masters there, to kepe downe misorder. And therefore, if the Pope himselfe, do not onelie graunt pardons to furder thies wicked purposes abrode in Italie, but also (although this present Pope, in the beginning, made som shewe of misliking thereof) assigne both meede and merite to the maintenance of stewes and brothelhouses at home in Rome, than let wise men thinke Italie a safe place for holsom doctrine, and godlie manners, and a fitte schole for yong ientlemen of England to be brought vp in. Our Italians bring home with them other faultes from Italie, though not so great as this of Religion, yet a great deale greater, tha many good men can well beare. For commonlie 245 they cum home, common contemners of mariage and readie persuaders of all other to the same: not because they loue virginitie, nor yet because they hate prettie yong virgines, but, being free in Italie, to go whither so euer lust will cary them, they do not like, that lawe and honestie should be soch a barre to their like libertie at home in England. And yet they be, the greatest makers of loue, the daylie daliers, with such pleasant wordes, with such smilyng and secret countenances, with such signes, tokens, wagers, purposed to be lost, before they were purposed to be made, with bargaines of wearing colours, floures, and herbes, to breede occasion of ofter m eeting of him and her, and bolder talking of this and that &c. And although I haue seene some,  innocent of all ill, and stayde in all honestie, that haue vsed these thinges without all harme, without all suspicion of harme, yet these knackes were brought first into England by them, that learned the before in Italie yet, if the meaning and maners of some that do vse them, were somewhat amended, it were no great hurt, neither to them selues, nor to others. singular in all their matters: Singular in knowledge, ignorant of nothyng: So singular in wisedome (in their owne opinion) as scarse they counte the best Counsellor the Prince hath, comparable with them: Common discoursers of all matters: busie searchers of most secret affaires: open flatterers of great men: priuie mislikers of good men: Faire speakers, with smiling countenaces, and much curtessie openlie to all men. Ready bakbiters, sore nippers, and spitefull reporters priuilie of good men. And beyng brought vp in Italie, in some free Citie, as all Cities be there: where a man may fr eelie discourse against what he will, against whom be lust: against any Prince, agaynst any gouernement, yea against God him selfe, and his whole Religion: where he must be, either Guelphe or Gibiline; either French or Spanish: and alwayes compelled to be of some partie, of some faction, he shall neuer be compelled to be of any Religion: And if he medle not ouer much with Christes true Religion, he shall haue fr ee libertie to embrace all Religions, and becum, if he lust at once, without any let or punishment, Iewish, Turkish, Papish, and Deuillish. A yong Ientleman, thus bred vp in this goodly schole, to learne the next and readie way to sinne, to haue a busie head, a factious hart, a talkatiue tonge: fed with discoursing of factions: led to contemne God and his Religion, shall cum home into England, but verie ill taught, either to be an honest man him selfe, a quiet subied to his Prince, or willyng to serue God, vnder the obedience of trewe doctrine, or with in the order of honest liuing. I know, none will be offended with this my generall writing, but onelie such, as finde them selues giltie priuatelie therin: who shall haue good leaue to be offended with me, vntill they begin to amende them selues. I touch not them that be good: and I say to litle of them that be nought. And so, though not enough for their deseruing, yet sufficientlie for this time, and more els when, if occasion so require. And thus farre haue I wandred from my first purpose of teaching a child, yet not altogether out of the way, bicause this whole taulke hath tended to the onelie aduauncement of trothe in Religion, an honestie of liuing: and hath bene wholie within the compasse of learning and good maners, the speciall pointes belonging in the right bringyng vp of youth. But to my matter, as I began, plainlie and simplie with my yong Scholer, so will I not leaue him, God willing, vntill I haue brought him a perfite Scholer out of the Schole, and placed him in the Vniuersitie, to becum a fitte student, for Logicke and Khetoricke: and so after to Phisicke, Law, or Diuinitie, as aptnes of nature, aduise of frendes, and Gods disposition shall lead him. The ends of the first booke. After that your scholer, as I sayd before, shall cum in d eede, first, to a readie persitnes in translating, than, to a ripe and skilfull choice in markyng cut hys fire pointes, as, 1.   Proprium . ------ 2.   Translatum . 3.   Synonymum . 4.   Contrarium . 5.   Diuersum . 6.   Phrases . some booke of Tullie, as the third booke of Epistles chosen out by Sturmius, de Amicitia, de Senectute , or that excellent Epistle conteinyng almost the whole first booke ad Q. fra : some Comedie of  Terence or Plautus: but in Plautus, skilfull 247 choice must be vsed by the master, to traine his Scholer  248 to a iudgement, in cutting out persitelie ouer old and vnproper wordes: C aes. Commentaries are to be read with 249 all curiositie, in specially without all exception to be made, either by frende or foe, is seene, the vnspotted proprietie of the Latin tong, euen whan it was, as the Grecians say, in ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif)  [illeg.] the hiest pitch of all persitenesse: or some Orations of T. Liuius, such as be both longest and plainest. at euery lecture: for he shall not now vse dalie translation, but onely construe againe, and parse, where ye suspect, is any nede: yet, let him not omitte in these bookes, his former exercise, in marking diligently, and writyng orderlie out his six pointes. And for translating, vse you your selfe, euery second or thyrd day, to chose out, some Epistle ad Atticum , some notable common place out of his Orations, or some other part of  Tullie, scholer may not know where to finde: and translate it you your selfe, into plaine naturall English, and than giue it him to translate into Latin againe: allowyng him good space and tyme to do it, both with diligent h eede, and good aduisement. Here his witte shalbe new set on worke: his iudgement, for right choice, trewlie tried: his memorie, for sure reteyning, better exercised, than by learning, any thing without the booke: & here, how much he hath proffited, shall plainly appeare. Whan he bringeth it translated vnto you, bring you forth the place of Tullie: lay them together: compare the one with the other: commend his good choice, & right placing of wordes: Shew his faultes iently, but blame them not ouer sharply: for, of such missings, ientlie admonished of, procedeth glad & good heed taking: of good heed taking, springeth chiefly knowledge, which after, groweth to perfitnesse, if this order, be diligentlie vsed by the scholer & iently handled by the master: for here, shall all the hard pointes of Gramer, both easely and surelie be learned vp: which, scholers in common scholes, by making of Latines, be groping at, with care & feare, & yet in many yeares, they scarse can reach vnto them. I remember, whan I was yong, in the North, they went to the Grammer schole, litle children: they came from thence great lubbers: alwayes learning, and litle profiting: learning without booke, euerything, vnderstadyng with in the booke litle or nothing: Their whole knowledge, by learning without the booke, was tied onely to their tong & lips, and neuer asceded vp to the braine & head, and therfore was sone spitte out of the mouth againe: They were, as men, alwayes goyng, but euer out of the way: and why: For their whole labor, or rather great toyle without order, was euen vaine idlenesse without proffit. In deed, they tooke great paynes about learning: but employed small labour in learning: Whan by this way prescribed in this booke, being streight, plaine, & easie, the scholer is alwayes laboring with pleasure, and euer going right on forward with proffit: Alwayes laboring I say, for, or he haue costrued, parced, twise traslated ouer by good aduisemet, marked out his six pointes by skilfull iudgement, he shall haue necessarie occasion, to read ouer euery lecture, a dosen tymes, at the least. Which, bicause he shall do alwayes in order, he shall do it alwayes with pleasure: And pleasure allureth loue: loue hath lust to labor: labor alwayes obteineth his purpose, as most trewly, both Aristotle in his Rhetoricke & Oedipus in Sophocles  251 do teach, saying, ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/atigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) .  . et cet .  & this oft  252 non multa . But to my purpose againe: Whan, by this diligent and spedie reading ouer, those forenamed good bokes of Tullie, Terence, C aesar, and Liuie, and by this second kinde of translating out of your English, tyme shall breed skill, and vse shall bring perfection, than ye may trie, if you will, your scholer, with the third kinde of translation: although the two first wayes, by myne opinion, be, not onelie sufficient of them selues, but also surer, both for the Masters teaching, and scholers learnyng, than this third way is: Which is thus. Write you in English, some letter, as it were from him to his father, or to some other frende, naturallie, according to the disposition of the child, or some tale, or fable, or plaine narration, according as Aphthonius beginneth his exercises of learning, and let him translate it into Latin againe, abiding in soch place, where no other scholer may prompe him. But yet, vse you your selfe soch discretion for choice therein, as the matter may be within the compas, both for wordes and sentences, of his former learning and reading. And now take h eede, left your scholer do not better in some point, than you your selfe, except ye haue bene diligentlie exercised in these kindes of translating before: I had once a profe hereof, tried by good experience, by a deare frende of myne, whan I came first from Cambrige, to serue the Queens Maiestie, than Ladie Elizabeth, lying at worthie Syr Ant. Denys in Cheston. Iohn Whitneye, a yong ientleman, was my bedfeloe, who willyng by good nature and prouoked by mine aduise, began to learne the Latin tong, after the order declared in this booke. We began after Christmas: I read vnto him Tullie de Amicitia , which he did euerie day twise translate, out of Latin into English, and out of English into Latin agayne. About S. Laurence tyde after, to proue how he proffited, I did chose out  Torquatus taulke de Amicitia in the later end of the first booke de finib . bicause that place was, the same in matter, like in wordes and phrases, nigh to the forme and facion of sentences, as he had learned before in de Amicitia . I did translate it my selfe into plaine English, and gaue it him to turne into Latin: Which he did, so choislie, so orderlie, so without any great misse in the hardest pointes of Grammer, that some, in seuen yeare in Grammer scholes, yea,  & some in the Vniuersities to, can not do halfe so well. This worthie yong Ientleman, to my greatest grief, to the great lamentation of that whole house, and speciallie to that most noble Ladie, now Queene Elizabeth her selfe, departed within few dayes, out of this world. And if in any cause, a man may without offence of God speake somewhat vngodlie, surely, it was some grief vnto me, to see him hie so hastlie to God, as he did. A Court, full of soch yong Ientlemen, were rather a Paradise than a Court vpon earth. And though I had neuer Poeticall head, to make any verse, in any tong, yet either loue, or sorow, or both, did wring out of me than, certaine carefull thoughtes of my good will towardes him, which in my murning for him, fell forth, more by chance, than either by skill or vse, into this kinde of misorderlie meter. Myne, owne Iohn Whitney, now farewell, now death doth patte vs twaine; No death, but partyng for a while, whom life shall ioyne agayne. Therfore my hartcease sighes and sobbes, cease sorowes seede to sow, Whereof no gaine but greater grief, and hurotfull care may grow. Yet, whan I thinke vpon soch giftes of grace as God him lent, My losse, his gaine, I must a while, with ioyfull teares lament. Yong yeares to yelde soch frute in Court, where seede of vice is sowne. Is sometime read, in some place seene, amogst vs seldom knowne. His life he ledde, Christes lore to learne, with will to worke the same, He read to know, and knew to liue, and liued to praise his name. So fast to frende, so foe to few, so good to euery weight I may well wishe, but scarcelie hope, agayne to haue in sight. The greater ioye his life to me, his death the greater payne: His life in Christ so surelie set, doth glad my harte agayne: His life so good, his death better, do mingle mirth with care, My spirit with ioye, my flesh with grief, so deare a frend to spare. Thus God the good, while they be good, doth take, and leaues vs ill, That we should mend our sinfull life, in life to tary still. Thus, we well left, be better rest, in heauen to take his place, That by like life, and death, at last, we may obteine like grace. Myne owne Iohn Whiteney agayne fairewell, a while thus parte in twaine, Whom payne doth part in earth, in heauen great ioye shall ioyne agayne. In this place, or I procede farder, I will now declare, by whose authoritie I am led, and by what reason I am moued, to thinke, that this way of duble translation out of one tong into an other, in either onelie, or at least chiefly, to be exercised, speciallie of youth, for the ready and sure obteining of any tong. There be six wayes appointed by the best learned men, for the learning of tonges, and encreace of eloquence, as 1.   Translatiolinguarum. ------ 2.   Paraphrasis. 3.   Metaphrasis. 4.   Epitome. 5.   Imitatio. 6.   Declamatio . All theis be vsed, and commended, but in order, and for respectes: as person, habilitie, place, and tyme shall require. The fiue last, be fitter, for the Master, than the scholer: for men, than for children: for the vniuersities, rather than for Grammer scholes: yet neuerthelesse, which is, fittest in mine opinion, for our schole, and which is, either wholie to be refused, or partlie to be vsed for our purpose, I will, by good authoritie, and some reason, I trust perticularlie of euerie one, and largelie enough of them all, declare orderlie vnto you. Translation, is easie in the beginning for the scholer, and bringeth all moch learning and great iudgement to the Master. It is most common, and most commendable of all other exercises for youth: most common, for all your constructions in Grammer scholes, be nothing els but translations: but because they be not double translations, as I do require, they bring forth but simple and single commoditie, and bicause also they lacke the daily vse of writing, which is the onely thing that br eedeth deepe roote, both in ye witte, for good vnderstanding, and in ye memorie, for sure keeping of all that is learned. Most commedable also, & that by ye iudgemet of all authors, which intreate of theis exercises. Tullie in 254 trewe iudgement in learning, doth, not onely praise specially, and chose this way of translation for a yong man, but doth also discommend and refuse his ewne former wont, in exercising Paraphrasin & Metaphrasin. Paraphrasis is, to take some eloquent Oration, or some notable common place in Latin, and expresse it with other wordes: Metaphrasis is, to take some notable place out of a good Poete, and turne the same sens into meter, or into other wordes in Prose. Crassus, or rather Tullie, doth mislike both these wayes, bicause the Author, either Orator or Poete, had chosen out before, the fittest wordes and aptest composition for that matter, and so he, in s eeking other, was driuen to vse the worse. Quintilian also preferreth translation before all other 255 very many places, if a man read his Rhetoricke ouer adnisedlie, and that rather of an enuious minde, than of any iust cause) doth greatlie commend Paraphrasis , crossing spitefullie  Tullies iudgement in refusing the same: and so do Ramus and Tal aeus euen at this day in France to. But such singularitie, in diffenting from the best mens iudgementes, in liking onelie their owne opinions, is moch misliked of all them, that ioyne with learning, discretion, and wisedome. For he, that can neither like Aristotle in Logicke and Philosophie, nor Tullie in Rhetoricke and Eloquence, will, from these steppes, likelie enough presume, by like pride, to mount hier, to the misliking of greater matters: that is either in Religion, to haue a dissentious head, or in the common wealth, to haue a factious hart: as I knew one a student in Cambrige, who, for a singularitie, began first to dissent, in the scholes, from Aristotle, and sone after became a peruerse Arrian, Basileus, and S. Hierome, onelie to gleane out of their workes, the pernicious heresies of Celsus, Eunomius , and Heluidius , whereby the Church of Christ, was so poysoned withall. But to leaue these hye pointes of diuinitie, surelie, in this quiet and harmeles controuersie, for the liking, or misliking of Paraphrasis for a yong scholer, euen as far, as Tullie goeth beyond  Quintilian, Ramus, they behinde Tullie, for trew iudgement in teaching the same. 256 Plinius Secundus, a wise Senator, of great experiece, excellentlie learned him selfe, a liberall Patrone of learned men, and the purest writer, in myne opinion, of all his age, I except not Suetonius, his two scholemasters Quintilian and Tacitus, nor yet his most excellent learned Vncle, the 257 many good wayes for order in studie: but he beginneth with translation, and preferreth it to all the rest: and bicause his wordes be notable, I will recite them. Utile in primis, vt multi pr aecipiunt, ex Graece in Latinum, & ex Latine vertere in Graecum: Quo genere exercitationis, proprietas splendorq verborum, apta structura sententiarum, sigurarum copia & explicandi vis colligitur. Praeterea, imitatione optimerum, facultas similia inuenicndi paratur: & quae legentem, fefellissent, transferentem fugere non possunt. Intelligentia ex hoc, & iudicium acquiritur . Ye perceiue, how Plinie teacheth, that by this exercise of double translating, is learned, easely, sensiblie, by litle and litle, not onelie all the hard congruities of Grammer, the choice of aptest wordes, the right framing of wordes and sentences, cumlines of figures and formes, fitte for euerie matter, and proper for euerie tong, but that which is greater also, in marking dayly, and folowing diligentlie thus, the steppes of the best Autors, like inuention of Argumentes, like order in disposition, like vtterance in Elocution, is easelie gathered vp: whereby your scholer shall be brought not onelie to like eloquence, but also, to all trewe vnderstanding and right iudgement, both for writing and speaking. And where Dionys. Halicarnass aeus hath written two excellent bookes, the one, de delectu optimorum verborum , the which, I feare, is lost, the other, of the right framing of wordes and sentences, which doth remaine yet in Gr eke, to the great proffet of all them, that trewlie studie for eloquence, yet this waie of double translating, shall bring the whole proffet of both these bookes to a diliget scholer, and that easelie and pleasantlie, both for fitte choice of wordes, and apt composition of sentences. And by theis authorities and reasons am I moued to thinke, this waie of double translating, either onelie or chieflie, to be fittest, for the spedy and perfit atteyning of any tong. And for spedy atteyning, I durst venture a good wager, if a scholer, in whom is aptnes, loue, diligence, & constancie, would but translate, after this sorte, one litle booke in Tullie, as de senectute , with two Epistles, the first ad Q. fra : the other adlentulum , the last saue one, in the first booke, that scholer, I say, should cum to a better knowledge in the Latin tong, tha the most part do, that spend foure or fiue yeares, in tossing all the rules of Grammer in common scholes. In d eede this one booke with these two Epistles, is not sufficient to affourde all Latin wordes (which is not necessarie for a yong scholer to know) but it is able to furnishe him fully, for all pointes of Grammer, with the right placing ordering, & vse of wordes in all kinde of matter. And why not? for it is read, that  Dion. Prussaeus, that wise Philosopher, & excellet orator of all his tyme, did cum to the great learning & vtterance that was in him, by reading and folowing onelie two bookes, Phaedon Platonis, and Demosthenes most notable oration ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . And a better, and nerer example herein, may be, our most noble Qu eene  Elizabeth, who neuer toke yet, Gr eeke nor Latin Grammer in her hand, after the first declining of a nowne and a verbe, but onely by this double translating of Demosthenes and Isocrates dailie without missing euerie forenone, and likewise som part of Tullie euery afternone, for the space of a yeare or two, hath atteyned to soch a perfite vnderstanding in both the tonges, and to soch a readie vtterance of the latin, and that wyth soch a iudgement, as they be fewe in nomber in both the vniuersities, or els where in England, that be, in both tonges, comparable with her Maiestie. And to conclude in a short rowme, the commodities of double translation, surelie the mynde by dailie marking, first, the cause and matter: than, the wordes and phrases: next, the order and composion: after the reason and argumentes: than the formes and figures of both the tonges: lastelie, the measure and compas of euerie sentence, must nedes, by litle and litle drawe vnto it the like shape of eloquence, as the author doth vse, which is red. And thus much for double translation. 258 Paraphrasis , the second point, is not onelie to expresse at large with moe wordes, but to striue and contend (as Quintilian saith) to translate the best latin authors, into other latin wordes, as many or thereaboutes. while, by L. Crassus, but sone after, vpon dewe profe thereof, reiected iustlie by Crassus and Cicero: yet allowed and made sterling agayne by M. Quintilian: neuerthelesse, shortlie after, by better assaye, disalowed of his owne scholer Plinius Secundus , who termeth it rightlie thus Audax contentio . It is a bold comparison in d eede, to thinke to say better, than that is best. Soch turning of the best into worse, is much like the turning of good wine, out of a faire sweete flagon of siluer, into a foule mustie bottell of ledder: or, to turne pure gold and siluer, into foule brasse and copper. Soch kinde of Paraphrasis , in turning, chopping, and changing, the best to worse, either in the mynte or scholes, (though  M. Brokke and Quintilian both say the contrary) is moch misliked of the best and wisest men. I can better allow an other kinde of Paraphrasis , to turne rude and barbarus, into proper and eloquent: which neuerthelesse is an exercise, not fitte for a scholer, but for a perfite master, who in plentie hath good choise, in copie hath right iudgement, and grounded skill, as did appeare to be in  Sebastian Castalio, in translating Kemppes booke de Imitando Christo . paine, to s eeke the worse and fowler way, whan the plaine and fairer is occupied before your eyes. if occasion required to speake twise of one matter, not to change the wordes, but ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , that is, worde for worde to expresse it againe. For they thought, that a matter, well expressed with fitte wordes and apt composition, was not to be altered, but liking it well their selues, they thought it would also be well allowed of others. A scholemaster (soch one as I require) knoweth that I say trewe. in Secundo et nono Iliodos , not onelie som verses, but  260 whole leaues, not to be altered with new, but to be vttered  261 with the old selfe same wordes. once in his life, againe in the historie of the Gr eekes, in one matter, kepeth alwayes the selfe same wordes. He both the like, speaking of Socrates, both in the beginning of his Apologie and in the last ende of ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . owne wordes vttered before in his oration de Chersoneso . He both the like, and that more at large, in his orations, against  Andration and Timocrates. do repeate one matter, with the selfe same wordes. Thies excellent authors, did thus, not for lacke of wordes, but by iudgement and skill: whatsoeuer, other, more curious, and lesse skilfull, do thinke, write, and do. Paraphrasis neuerthelesse hath good place in learning, but not, by myne opinion, for any scholer, but is onelie to be left to a perfite Master, eyther to expound openlie a good author withall, or to compare priuatelie, for his owne exercise, how some notable place of an excellent author, may be vttered with other fitte wordes: But if ye alter also, the composition, forme, and order than that is not Paraphrasis , but Imitatio , as I will fullie declare in fitterplace. The scholer shall winne nothing by Paraphrasis , but onelie, if we may beleue  Tullie to choose worse wordes, to place them out of order, to feare ouermoch the iudgement of the master, to mislike ouermuch the hardnes of learning, and by vse, to gather vp faultes, which hardlie will be left of againe. The master in teaching it, shall rather encrease hys owne labor, than his scholers proffet: for when the scholer shall bring vnto his master a p eece of Tullie or C aesar turned into other latin, then must the master cum to Quintilians goodlie lesson de Emendatione , which, (as he saith) is the most profitable part of teaching, but not in myne opinion, and namelie for youthe in Grammer scholes. For the master nowe taketh double paynes: first, to marke what is amisse: againe, to inuent what may be sayd better. And here perchance, a verie good master may easelie both deceiue himselfe, and lead his scholer into error. It requireth greater learning, and deeper iudgement, than is to be hoped for at any scholemasters hand: that is, to be able alwaies learnedlie and perfitelie. Mutare quod ineptum est: --- Transmutare quod peruer sum est: Replere quod deest: Detrahere quod obest: Expungere quod inane est . Premere tumentia: --- Extollere humilia: Astringere luxuriantia: Componere dissoluta . The master may here onelie stumble, and perchance faull in teaching, to the marring and mayning of the Scholer in learning, whan it is a matter, of moch readyng, of Sublime, et Tumidum: --- Grande, et immodicum: Decorum, et ineptum: Perfectum, et nimium . Some men of our time, counted perfite Maisters of eloquence, in their owne opinion the best, in other mens iudgementes very good, as Omphalius euerie where, Sadoletus in many places, yea also my frende Osorius, namelie in his Epistle to the Queene & in his whole booke de Iusticia , haue so ouer reached th e selues, in making trew difference in the poyntes afore rehearsed, as though they had bene brought vp in some schole in  Asia, to learne to decline rather then in Athens with Plato, Aristotle, and Demosthenes, (from whence Tullie fetched his eloquence) to vnderstand, what in euerie matter, to be spoken or written on, is, in verie d eede, Nimium, Satis, Parum , that is for to say, to all considerations, Decorum , which, as it is the hardest point, in all learning, so is it the fairest and onelie marke, that scholers, in all their studie, must alwayes shote at, if they purpose an other day to be, either sounde in Religion, or wise and discrete in any vocation of the common wealth. Agayne, in the lowest degr ee, it is no low point of learnyng and iudgement for a Scholemaster, to make trew difference betwixt. Humile & depressum: --- Lene & remissum: Siccum & aridum: Exile & macrum: Inaffectatum & neglectum . In these poyntes, some, louing Melancthon well, as he was well worthie, but yet not considering well nor wiselie, how he of nature, and all his life and studie by iudgement was wholy spent in genere Disciplinabili , that is, in teaching, reading, and expounding plainlie and aptlie schole matters, and therfore imployed thereunto a fitte, sensible, and caulme kinde of speaking and writing, some I say, with very well liuyng, but not with verie well weying  Melanchones doinges, do frame them selues a style, cold, leane, and weake, though the matter be neuer so warme & earnest, not moch vnlike vnto one, that had a pleasure, in a roughe, raynie, winter day, to clothe him selfe with nothing els, but a demie, bukram cassok, plaine without plites, and single with out lyning: which will neither beare of winde nor wether, nor yet kepe out the sunne, in any hote day. 265 Some suppose, and that by good reason, that Melanchton him selfe came to this low kinde of writyng, by vsing euer moch Paraphrasis in reading: For studying therbie to to make euerie thing streight and easie, in smothing and playning all things to much, neuer leaueth, whiles the sence it selfe be left, both lowse and lasie. And some of those Paraphrasis of Melanchton be set out in Printe, as Pro Archia Poeta, & Marco Marcello : But a scholer, by myne opinion, is better occupied in playing or sleping, than in spendyng tyme, not onelie vainlie but also harmefullie, in soch a kinde of exercise. If a Master would haue a perfite example to folow, how, in Genere sublimi , to auoide Nimium , or in Medioceri , to atteyne Satis , or in Humili , to exchew Parum , let him read diligently for the first, Secundam Philippicam , for the meane,  266 De Natura Deorum , and for the lowest, Partitiones . Or, if in an other tong, ye looke for like example, in like perfection, for all those three degrees, read Pro Ctesiphonte, Ad Leptinem ,  267 & Contra Olympiodorum , and, what witte, Arte, and diligence is hable to affourde, ye shall plainely s e. For our tyme, the odde man to performe all three perfitlie, whatsoeuer he doth, and to know the way to do them 268 Sturmius. He also councelleth all scholers to beware of Paraphrasis , except it be, from worse to better, from rude and barbarous, to proper and pure latin, and yet no man to exercise that neyther, except soch one, as is alreadie furnished with plentie of learning, and grounded with stedfast iudgement before. All theis faultes, that thus manie wise men do finde with the exercise of Paraphrasis , in turning the best latin, into other, as good as they can, that is, ye may be sure, into a great deale worse, than it was, both in right choice for proprietie, and trewe placing, for good order is committed also commonlie in all common scholes, by the scholemasters, in tossing and trobling yong wittes (as I sayd in the beginning) with that boocherlie feare in making of Latins. Therefore, in place, of Latines for yong scholers, and of Paraphrasis for the masters, I wold haue double translation specially vsed. For, in double translating a perfite peece of  Tullie or C aesar, neyther the scholer in learning, nor ye Master in teaching can erre. A true tochstone, a sure metwand lieth before both their eyes. For, all right cogruitie: proprietie of wordes: order in sentences: the right imitation, to inuent good matter, to dispose it in good order, to confirme it with good reason, to expresse any purpose fitlie and orderlie, is learned thus, both easelie & perfitlie: Yea, to misse somtyme in this kinde of translation, bringeth more proffet, than to hit right, either in Paraphrasi or making of Latins. For though ye say well, in a latin making, or in a Paraphrasis , yet you being but in doute, and vncertayne whether ye saie well or no, ye gather and lay vp in memorie, no sure frute of learning thereby: But if ye fault in translation, ye ar easelie taught, how perfitlie to amende it, and so well warned, how after to exchew, all soch faultes againe. Paraphrasis therefore, by myne opinion, is not m eete for Grammer scholes: nor yet verie fitte for yong men in the vniuersitie, vntill studie and tyme, haue bred in them, perfite learning, and stedfast iudgement. There is a kinde of Paraphrasis , which may be vsed, without all hurt, to moch proffet: but it serueth onely the Greke and not the latin, nor no other tong, as, to alter linguam Ionicam aut Doricam into meraui Atticam : A notable example there is left vnto vs by a notable learned man  Diony: Halicarn: who, in his booke, ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , doth translate the goodlie storie of Candaulus and Gyges in 1. Herodoti , out of Ionica lingua , into Atticam . Read the place, and ye shall take, both pleasure and proffet, in conference of it. A man, that is exercised in reading,  Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Demosthenes, in vsing to turne, like places of Herodotus, after like sorte, shold shortlie cum to soch a knowledge, in vnderstanding, speaking, and writing the Gr eeke tong, as fewe or none hath yet atteyned in England. The like exercise out of Dorica lingua may be also vsed, if a man take that litle booke of  Plato, Tim aeus Locrus, De Animo et natura , which is writte Dorice , and turne it into soch Gr eeke, as  Plato vseth in other workes. The booke, is but two leaues: and the labor wold be, but two w eekes: but surelie the proffet, for easie vnderstanding, and trewe writing the Greeke tonge, wold conteruaile wyth the toile, that som men taketh, in otherwise coldlie reading that tonge, two yeares. And yet, for the latin tonge, and for the exercise of Paraphrasis , in those places of latin, that can not be bettered, if som yong man, excellent of witte, corragious in will, lustie of nature, and desirous to contend euen with the best latin, to better it, if he can, surelie I commend his forwardnesse, and for his better instruction therein, I will set before him, as notable an example of Paraphrasis , as is in Record of learning.  Cicero him selfe, doth contend, in two sondrie places, to expresse one matter, with diuerse wordes: and that is Paraphrasis , saith Quintilian. The matter I suppose, is taken out of Pan aetius : and therefore being translated out of Gr eeke at diuers times, is vttered for his purpose, with diuers wordes and formes: which kinde of exercise, for perfite learned men, is verie profitable. 269 Homo enim Rationem habet a natura menti datam, quae, et causas rerum & consecutiones videt, & similitudines transfert, & disiuncta coniungit, & cum praesentibus futura copulat, omnemq complectitur vitae consequentis statum. b. Eademq ratio facit hominem hominum appetentem, cumq, his, natura, & sermone & vsu congruentem: vt profectus a caritate domesticoru as suorum, currat longius, & se implicet, primo Ciuiv, deinde omnium mortalium societati: vtq non sibi soli se natu meminerit, sed patriae, sed suis, vt exigua pars ipsirelinquatur. c. Et quonia eadem natura cupiditatem ingenuit homini veri inueniendi, quod facilim e apparet, cum vacui curis, etiam quid in coelo fiat, scire auemus. &c . 270 Homo autem, qui rationis est particeps, per quam consequentia cernit, & causas rerum videt, earumq progressus, & quasiae antecessiones non ignorat, similitudines comparat, rebusq praesentibus adiungit, atq annectit futuras, facile totius vitae cursum videt, ad eamq degendam praeparat res necessarias . b. Eadamq natura vi rationis hominem conciliat homini, & ad Orationis; & ad vitae societatem: ingeneratq imprimis praecipuum quendam amorem in eos, qui procreati: sunt, impellitq vt hominum caetus & celebrari inter se, & sibiobediri velit, ob easq causas, studeat parare ea, quae suppeditent ad cultum & ad victum, nec sibi soli, sed coniugi, liberis, caeterisq quos charos habeat, tueriq debeat . c. Qu ae cura exuscitat etiam animos, & maiores adrem gerendam facit: imprimisq hominis est propria veri inquisitio atq inuestigatio: it a cum sumus necessarys negocijs curisq vacui, tum auemus aliquid videre, audire, addiscere, cognitionemq rerum mirabilium. &c . The conference of these two places, conteinyng so excellent a p eece of learning, as this is, expressed by so worthy a witte, as Tullies was, must n eedes bring great pleasure and proffit to him, that maketh trew counte, of learning and honestic. But if we had the Greke Author, the first Paterne of all, and therby to see, how Tullies witte did worke at diuerse tymes, how, out of one excellent Image, might be framed two other, one in face and fauor, but som what differing in forme, figure, and color, surelie, such a p eece of worke manship compared with the Paterne it selfe, would better please the ease of honest, wise, and learned myndes, tha two of the fairest venusses, that euer Apelles made. Scholers or other, as I am led to thinke, not onelie, by mine owne experience, but chiefly by the authoritie & iudgement of those, whom I my selfe would gladliest folow, and do counsell all myne to do the same: not contendyng with any other, that will otherwise either thinke or do. This kinde of exercise is all one with Paraphrasis , saue it is out of verse, either into prose, or into some other kinde of meter: or els, out of prose into verse, which was  Socrates exercise and pastime (as Plato greatlie praise also this exercise: but bicause Tullie doth disalow it in yong men, by myne opinion, it were not well to vse it Grammer Scholes, euen for the selfe same causes, that be recited against Paraphrasis . And therfore, for the vse, or misuse of it, the same is to be thought, that is spoken of Paraphrasis before. This was Sulpitius exercise: and he gathering vp therby, a Poeticall kinde of talke, is iustlie named of Cicero, grandis et Tragicus Orator : which I think is spoken, not for his praise, but for other mens warning, to exchew the like faulte. Yet neuertheles, if our Schelemaster for his owne instruction, be desirous, to s e a perfite example hereof, I will recite one, which I thinke, no man is so bold, will say, that he can amend it: & that is Chrises the Priestes Oration to the Grekes, turned excelletlie into prose by  Socrates him selfe, and that aduisedlie and purposelie for other to folow: and therfore he calleth this exercise, in the same place, ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , that is, Imitatio , which is most trew: but, in this booke, for teachyng sake, I will name it Metaphrasis , reteinyng the word, that all teachers, in this case, do vse. ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)

Platos turning of Homer in this place, doth not ride a loft in Poeticall termes, but goeth low and soft on foote, as prose and Pedestris oratio should do. If  Sulpitius had had Platos consideration, in right vsing this exercise, he had not deserued the name of Tragicus Orator , who should rather haue studied to expresse vim Demosthenis , than furorem Po aetae , how good so euer he was, whom he did folow. what is kept: what is added: what is left out: what is changed, either, in choise of wordes, or forme of sentences: which foure pointes, be the right tooles, to handle like a workeman, this kinde of worke: as our Scholer shall better vnderstand, when he hath bene a good while in the Vniuersitie: to which tyme and place, I chiefly remitte this kinde of exercise. And bicause I euer thought examples to be the best kinde of teaching, I will recite a golden sentece out of that Poete, which is next vnto Homer, not onelie in tyme, but also in worthines: which hath bene a paterne for many worthie wittes to follow, by this kind of Metaphrasis , but I will content my selfe, with foure workemen, two in  Greke, and two in Latin, soch, as in both the tonges, wiser & worthier, can not be looked for. Surelie, no stone set in gold by most cunning workeme, is in ded, if right counte be made, more worthie the looking on, than this golden sentence, diuerslie wrought vpon, by soch foure excellent Masters. 1.

An other example out of the Latin tong also I will recite, for the worthines of the workeman therof, and that is Horace, who hath so turned the begynning of Terence Eunuchus, as doth worke in me, a pleasant admiration, as oft so euer, as I compare those two places togither. And though euerie Master, and euerie good Scholer to, do know the places, both in Terence and Horace, yet I will set them heare, in one place togither, that with more pleasure, they may be compared together.

This is a way of studie, belonging, rather to matter, than to wordes: to memorie, than to vtterance: to those that be learned alreadie, and hath small place at all amonges yong scholers in Grammer scholes. It may proffet priuately some learned men, but it hath hurt generallie learning it selfe, very moch. For by it haue we lost whole Trogus, the best part of T. Liuius, the goodlie Dictionarie of Pompeius festus, a great deale of the Ciuill lawe, and other many notable bookes, for the which cause, I do the more mislike this exercise, both in old and yong. Epitome , is good priuatelie for himselfe that doth worke it, but ill commonlie for all other that vse other mens labor therein: a silie poore kinde of studie, not vnlike to the doing of those poore folke, which neyther till, nor sowe, nor reape themselues, but gleane by stelth, vpon other mens growndes. Soch, haue emptie barnes, for deare yeares. Grammer scholes haue fewe Epitomes to hurt them, except Epitheta Textoris , and such beggarlie gatheringes, as  Horman, whittington, and other like vulgares for making of latines: yea I do wishe, that all rules for yong scholers, were shorter than they be. For without doute, Grammatica it selfe, is sooner and surer learned by examples of good authors, than by the naked rewles of  Grammarians. Epitome hurteth more, in the vniuersities and studie of Philosophie: but most of all, in diuinitie it selfe. In d eede bookes of common places be verie necessarie, to induce a man, into an orderlie generall knowledge, how to referre orderlie all that he readeth, ad certa rerum Capita , and not wander in studie. And to that end did  P. Lombardus the master of sentences and Ph. Melancthon in our daies, write two notable bookes of common places. But to dwell in Epitomes and bookes of common places, and not to binde himselfe dailie by orderlie studie, to reade with all diligence, principallie the holyest scripture and withall, the best Doctors, and so to learne to make trewe difference betwixt, the authoritie of the one, and the Counsell of the other, maketh so many s eeming, and sonburnt ministers as we haue, whose learning is gotten in a sommer heat, and washed away, with a Chistmas snow againe: who neuerthelesse, are lesse to be blamed, than those blind bussardes, who in late yeares, of wilfull maliciousnes, would neyther learne themselues, nor could teach others, any thing at all. Paraphrasis hath done lesse hurt to learning, than Epitome : for no Paraphrasis , though there be many, shall neuer take away Dauids the new Testament. And in an other schole, the Paraphrasis of  Brocardus, Arte Poetica , out of learned mens handes. But, as concerning a schole Epitome , he that wold haue an example of it, let him read  Lucian ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  which is the verie Epitome of Isocrates oration de laudibus Helen ae , whereby he may learne, at the least, this wise lesson, that a man ought to beware, to be ouer bold, in altering an excellent mans worke. Neuertheles, some kinde of Epitome may be vsed, by men of skilful iudgement, to the great proffet also of others. As if a wise man would take Halles Cronicle, where moch good matter is quite marde with Indenture Englishe, and first change, strange and inkhorne tearmes into proper, and commonlie vsed wordes: next, specially to wede out that, that is superfluous and idle, not onelie where wordes be vainlie heaped one vpon an other, but also where many sentences, of one meaning, be so clowted vp together as though M. Hall had bene, not writing the storie of England, but varying a sentence in Nitching schole: surelie a wise learned man, by this way of Epitome , in cutting away wordes and sentences, and diminishing nothing at all of the matter, shold leaue to mens vse, a storie, halfe as moch as it was in quantitie, but twise as good as it was, both for pleasure and also commoditie. An other kinde of Epitome may be vsed likewise very well, to moch proffet. Som man either by lustines of nature, or brought by ill teaching, to a wrong iudgement, is ouer full of words, setences,  & matter, & yet all his words be proper, apt & well chosen: all his senteces be rownd & trimlie framed: his whole matter grownded vpon good reason, & stuffed with full argumets, for his intent & purpose. Yet whe his talke shalbe heard, or his writing be red, of soch one, as is, either of my two dearest frendes,  M. Haddon at home, or Iohn Sturmius in Germanie, that Nimium in him, which fooles and vnlearned will most commend, shall eyther of thies two, bite his lippe, or shake his heade at it. This fulnes as it is not to be misliked in a yong man, so in farder aige, in greater skill, and weightier affaires, it is to be temperated, or else discretion and iudgement shall s eeme to be wanting in him. But if his stile be still ouer rancke and lustie, as some men being neuer so old and spent by yeares, will still be full of youthfull conditions as was Syr F. Bryan, and euermore wold haue bene: soch a rancke and full writer, must vse, if he will do wisclie the exercise of a verie good kinde of Epitome , and do, as certaine wise men do, that be ouer fat and fleshie: who leauing their owne full and plentifull table, go to soiorne abrode from home for a while, at the temperate diet of some sober man: and so by litle and litle, cut away the grosnesse that is in them. As for an example: If Osorius would leaue of his lustines in striuing against S. Austen, and his ouer rancke rayling against poore Luther, and the troth of Gods doctrine, and giue his whole studie, not to write any thing of his owne for a while, but to traslate Demosthenes, with so straite, fast, & temperate a style in latine, as he is in Greeke, he would becume so perfit & pure a writer, I beleue, as hath bene fewe or none sence Ciceroes dayes: And so, by doing himself and all learned moch good, do others lesse harme, & Christes doctrine lesse iniury, tha he doth: & with all, wyn vnto himselfe many worthy frends, who agreing with him gladly, in ye loue & liking of excellent learning, are sorie to see so worthie a witte, so rare eloquence, wholie spent and consumed, in striuing with God and good men. Emonges the rest, no man doth lament him more than I, not onelie for the excellent learning that I s ee in him, but also bicause there hath passed priuatelie betwixt him and me, sure tokens of moch good will, and frendlie opinion, the one toward the other. And surelie the distance betwixt London and Lysbon, should not stoppe, any kinde of frendlie dewtie, that I could, eyther shew to him, or do to his, if the greatest matter of all did not in certeyne pointes, separate our myndes. And yet for my parte, both toward him, and diuerse others here at home, for like cause of excellent learning, great wisdome, and gentle humanitie, which I haue s eene in them, and felt at their handes my selfe, where the matter of difference is mere conscience in a quiet minde in wardlie, and not contentious malice with spitefull rayling openlie, I can be content to follow this rewle, in misliking some one thing not to hate for anie thing els. not by nature, but by malice, & as may be gathered of their owne testimonie, giuen ouer to blindnes, for giuing ouer God & his word: or soch as be so lustie runnegates, as first, runne from God & his trew doctrine, than, from their Lordes, Masters, & all dewtie, next, fro them selues & out of their wittes, lastly from their Prince, contrey, & all dew allegeace, whether they ought rather to be pitied of good men, for their miserie, or contemned of wise men, for their malicious folie, let good and wise men determine. And to returne to Epitome agayne, some will iudge moch boldnes in me, thus to iudge of  Osorius style: but wise men do know, that meane lookers on, may trewelie say, for a well made Picture: This face had bene more cumlie, if that hie redde in the ch eeke, were somwhat more pure sanguin than it is: and yet the stander by, can not amend it himselfe by any way. And this is not written to the dispraise but to the great commendation of Osorius, because Tullie himselfe had the same fulnes in him: and therefore went to Rodes to cut it away: and faith himselfe, recepi me domum prope mutatus, nam quasi referuer at iam oratio . Which was brought to passe I beleue, not onelie by the teaching of  Molo Appollonius but also by a good way of Epitome , in binding him selfe to translate meros Atticos Oratores , and so to bring his style, from all lowse grosnesse, to soch firme fastnes in latin, as is in  Demosthenes in Gr eeke. And this to be most trew, may easelie be gathered, not onelie of L. Craffus talke in 1\. de Or . but speciallie of Ciceroes owne d eede in tranflating Demosthenes and Æschines orations ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) .  to that verie ende and purpose. And although a man growndlie learned all readie, may take moch proffet him selfe in vsing, by Epitome to draw other mens workes for his owne memorie sake, into shorter rowme, as  Conterus hath done verie well the whole Metamorphosis of  Ouid, & Dauid Cythr aeus a great deale better, their. Muses of Herodotus, and Melanchthon in myne opinion, far best of all, the whole storie of Time, not onelie to his owne vse, but to other mens proffet and hys great prayse, yet, Epitome is most necessarie of all in a mans owne writing, as we learne of that noble Poet  Virgill, who, if Donatus say trewe, in writing that perfite worke of the Georgickes, vsed dailie, whan he had written 40. or 50. verses, not to cease cutting, paring, and pollishing of them, till he had brought them to the nomber of x, or xy. And this exercise, is not more nedefullie done in a great worke, than wiselie done, in your common dailie writing, either of letter, or other thing else, that is to say to peruse diligentlie, and see and spie wiselie, what is alwaies more then nedeth: For, twenty to one, offend more, in writing to moch, than to litle: euen as twentie to one, fall into sicknesse, rather by ouer moch fulnes, than by anie lacke or emptinesse. And therefore is he alwaies the best English Physition, that best can geue a purgation, that is, by way of Epitome , to cut all ouer much away. And surelie mens bodies, be not more full of ill humors, than commonlie mens myndes (if they be yong, lustie, proude, like and loue them selues well, as most men do) be full of fansies, opinions errors, and faultes, not onelie in inward inuention, but also in all their vtterance, either by pen or taulke. And of all other men, euen those that haue ye inuentiuest heades, for all purposes, and roundest tonges in all matters and places (except they learne and vse this good lesson of Epitome ) commit commonlie greater faultes, than dull, staying silent men do. For, quicke inuentors, and faire readie speakers, being boldned with their present habilitie to say more, and perchance better to, at the soden for that present, than any other can do, vse lesse helpe of diligence and studie than they ought to do: and to haue in them commonlie, lesse learning, and weaker iudgement, for all d eepe considerations, than some duller heades, and flower tonges haue. And therefore, readie speakers, generallie be not the best, playnest, and wisest witers, nor yet the d eepest iudgers in weightie affaires, bicause they do not tarry to weye and iudge all thinges, as they should: but hauing their heades ouer full of matter, be like pennes ouer full of incke, which will soner blotte, than make any faire letter at all. Tyme was, whan I had experience of two Ambassadors in one place, the one of a hote head to inuent, and of a hastie hand to write, the other, colde and stayd in both: but what difference of their doinges was made by wise men, is not vnknowne to some persons. The Bishop of Winchester Steph: Gardiner had a quicke head, and a readie tong, and yet was not the best writer in England. Cicero in Brutus doth wiselie note the same in Serg: Galbo, and Q. Hortentius, who were both, hote, lustie, and plaine speakers, but colde, lowse, and rough writers: And Tullie telleth the cause why, saying, wha they spake, their tong was naturally caried withfull tyde & wynde of their witte: whan they wrote their head was solitarie, dull, and caulme, and so their style was blonte, and their writing colde: Quod vitium , sayth  Cicero, peringeniosis hominibus neq satis doctis plerunq accidit . And therfore all quick inuentors, & readie faire speakers, must be carefull, that, to their goodnes of nature, they adde also in any wise, studie, labor, leasure, learning, and iudgement, and than they shall in deede, passe all other, as I know some do, in whome all those qualities are fullie planted, or else if they giue ouer moch to their witte, and ouer litle to their labor and learning, they will sonest ouer reach in taulke, and fardest cum behinde in writing whatsoeuer they take in hand. The methode of Epitome is most necessarie for soch kinde of men. And thus much concerning the vse or misuse of all kinde of Epitomes in matters of learning. Imitation , is a facultie to expresse liuelie and perfitelie that example: which ye go about to folow. And of it selfe, it is large and wide: for all the workes of nature, in a maner be examples for arte to folow. But to our purpose, all languages, both learned and mother tonges, be gotten, and gotten onelie by Imitation . For as ye vse to heare, so ye learne to speake: if ye heare no other, ye speake not your selfe: and whome ye onelie heare, of them ye onelie learne. And therefore, if ye would speake as the best and wisest do, ye must be conuersant, where the best and wisest are: but if yow be borne or brought vp in a rude contrie, ye shall not chose but speake rudelie: the rudest man of all knoweth this to be trewe. Yet neuerthelesse, the rudenes of common and mother tonges, is no bar for wise speaking. For in the rudest contrie, and most barbarous mother language, many be found can speake verie wiselie: but in the Gr eeke and latin tong, the two onelie learned tonges, which be kept, not in common taulke, but in priuate bookes, we finde alwayes, wisdome and eloquence, good matter and good vtterance, neuer or seldom a fonder. For all soch Authors, as be fullest of good matter and right iudgement in doctrine, be likewise alwayes, most proper in wordes, most apte in sentence, most plaine and pure in vttering the same. And contrariwise, in those two tonges, all writers, either in Religion, or any sect of Philosophie, who so euer be founde fonde in iudgement of matter, be commonlie found as rude in vttering their mynde. For Stoickes, Anabaptistes, and Friers: with Epicures, Libertines and Monkes, being most like in learning and life, are no fonder and pernicious in their opinions, than they be rude and barbarous in their writinges. They be not wise, therefore that say, what care I for a mans wordes and vtterance, if his matter and reasons be good. Soch men, say so, not so moch of ignorance, as eyther of some singular pride in themselues, or some speciall malice of other, or for some priuate & perciall matter, either in Religion or other kinde of learning. For good and choice meates, be no more requisite for helthie bodies, than proper and apte wordes be for good matters, and also plaine and sensible vtterance for the best and depest reasons: in which two pointes standeth persite eloquence, one of the fairest and rarest giftes that God doth geue to man. Ye know not, what hurt ye do to learning, that care not for wordes but for matter, and so make a deuorse betwixt the tong and the hart. For marke all aiges: looke vpon the whole course of both the Gr eek and Latin tonge, and ye shall surelie finde, that, whan apte and good wordes began to be neglected, and properties of those two tonges to be confounded, than also began, ill deedes to spring: strange maners to oppresse good orders, newe and fond opinions to striue with olde and trewe doctrine, first in Philosophie: and after in Religion: right iudgement of all thinges to be peruerted, and so vertue with learning is contemned, and studie left of: of ill thoughtes cummeth peruerse iudgement: of ill deedes springeth lewde taulke. Which fower misorders, as they mar mans life, so destroy they good learning withall. But behold the goodnesse of Gods prouidence for learning: all olde authors and sectes of Philosophy, which were fondest in opinion, and rudest in vtterance, as Stoickes and Epicures, first contemned of wise men, and after forgotten of all men, be so consumed by tymes, as they be now, not onelie out of vse, but also out of memorie of man: which thing, I surelie thinke, will shortlie chance, to the whole doctrine and all the bookes of phantasticall Anabaptistes and Friers, and of the beastlie Libertines and Monkes. Againe behold on the other side, how Gods wisdome hath wrought, that of Academici and Peripatetici , those that were wisest in iudgement of matters, and purest in vttering their myndes, the first and chiefest, that wrote most and best, in either tong, as Plato and Aristotle in Gr eeke,  Tullie in Latin, be so either wholie, or sufficiently left vn to vs, as I neuer knew yet scholer, that gaue himselfe to like, and loue, and folow chieflie those thr ee Authors but he proued, both learned, wise, and also an honest man, if he ioyned with all the trewe doctrine of Gods holie Bible, without the which, the other thr ee, be but fine edge tooles in a fole or mad mans hand. matters of learning. The whole doctrine of Comedies and Tragedies, is a perfite imitation , or faire liuelie painted picture of the life of euerie degr ee of man. Of this Imitation writeth  Plato at large in 3. de Rep . but it doth not moch belong at this time to our purpose. The second kind of Imitation , is to folow for learning of tonges and sciences, the best authors. Here riseth, emonges proude and enuious wittes, a great controuersie, whether, one or many are to be folowed: and if one, who is that one:  Seneca, or Cicero: Salust, or C aesar, and so forth in Gr eeke and Latin. The third kinde of Imitation , belongeth to the second: as when you be determined, whether ye will folow one or mo, to know perfitlie, and which way to folow that one: in what place: by what meane and order: by what tooles and instrumentes ye shall do it, by what skill and iudgement, ye shall trewelie discerne, whether ye folow rightlie or no. This Imitatio , is dissimilis materei similis tractatio : and also, similis materei dissimilis tractatio , as  Virgill folowed Homer: as the one, Hiero king of Sicilie, the other Augustus the Emperor: and yet both for like respectes, that is, for their coragious stoutnes in warre, and iust gouernment in peace. One of the best examples, for right Imitation we lacke, and that is Menander, whom our Terence, (as the matter required) in like argument, in the same Persons, with equall eloquence, foote by foote did folow. Som p eeces remaine, like broken Iewelles, whereby men may rightlie esteme, and iustlie lament, the losse of the whole. Erasmus, the ornament of learning, in our tyme, doth wish that som man of learning and diligence, would take the like paines in Demosthenes and Tullie, that Macrobius hath done in Homer and Virgill, that is, to write out and ioyne together, where the one doth imitate the other. Erasmus, wishe is good, but surelie, it is not good enough: for Macrobius diligent gatherings for the Bucolikes out of Theocritus, as they be not fullie taken out of the whole heape, as they should be, but euen as though they had not sought for them of purpose, but fownd them scatered here and there by chance in their way, euen so, onelie to point out, and nakedlie to ioyne togither their sentences, with no farder declaring the maner and way, how the one doth folow the other, were but a colde helpe, to the encrease of learning. 1\. But if a man would take this paine also, whan he hath layd two places, of Homer and Virgill, or of Demosthenes and Tullie togither, to teach plainlie withall, after this sort. 2\. Tullie reteyneth thus moch of the matter, thies sentences, thies wordes: 3\. This and that he leaueth out, which he doth wittelie to this end and purpose. 4\. This he addeth here. 5\. This he diminisheth there. 6\. This he ordereth thus, with placing that here, not there. This he altereth and changeth, either, in propertie of wordes, in forme of sentence, in substance of the matter, or in one, or other conuenient circumstance of the authors present purpose. In thies fewe rude English wordes, are wrapt vp all the necessarie tooles and instrumentes, wherewith trewe Imitation is rightlie wrought withall in any tonge. Which tooles, I openlie confesse, be not of myne owne forging, but partlie left vnto me by the cunnigest Master, and one of the worthiest Ientlemen that euer England bred, Syr  Iohn Cheke: partelie borowed by me out of the shoppe of the dearest frende I haue out of England, Io. St. And therefore I am the bolder to borow of him, and here to leaue them to other, and namelie to my Children: which tooles, if it please God, that an other day, they may be able to vse rightlie, as I do wish and daylie pray, they may do, I shal be more glad, than if I were able to leaue them a great quantitie of land. more learning, and br eed vp trewer iudgement, than any other exercise that can be vsed, but not for yong beginners, bicause they shall not be able to consider dulie therof. And trewelie, it may be a shame to good studentes who hauing so faire examples to folow, as Plato and Tullie, do not vse so wise wayes in folowing them for the obteyning of wisdome and learning, as rude ignorant Artificers do, for gayning a small commoditie. For surelie the meanest painter vseth more witte, better arte, greater diligence, in hys shoppe, in folowing the Picture of any meane mans face, than commonlie the best studentes do, euen in the vniuersitie, for the atteining of learning it selfe. Some ignorant, vnlearned, and idle student: or some busie looker vpon this litle poore booke, that hath neither will to do good him selfe, nor skill to iudge right of others, but can lustelie contemne, by pride and ignorance, all painfull diligence and right order in study, will perchance say, that I am to precise, to curious, in marking and piteling thus about the imitation of others: and that the old worthie Authors did neuer busie their heades and wittes, in folowyng so preciselie, either the matter what other men wrote, or els the maner how other men wrote. They will say, it were a plaine slauerie, & iniurie to, to shakkle and tye a good witte, and hinder the course of a mas good nature with such bondes of seruitude, in folowyng other. eloquence, they must be content to turne a new leafe. owne testimonie to, in writyng wherof, he employed most care, studie, learnyng and iudgement, is his booke de Orat. ad Q. F. Now let vs s ee, what he did for the matter, and also for the maner of writing therof. For the whole booke consisteth in these two pointes onelie: In good matter, and good handling of the matter. And first, for the matter, it is whole  Aristotles, what so euer Antonie in the second, and Crassus in the third doth teach. Trust not me, but beleue Tullie him selfe, who writeth so, first, in that goodlie long Epistle ad P. Lentulum , and after in diuerse places ad Atticum . And in the verie booke it selfe,  Tullie will not haue it hidden, but both Catulus and Crassus do oft and pleasantly lay that stelth to Antonius charge. Now, for the handling of the matter, was Tullie so precise and curious rather to follow an other mans Paterne, than to inuent some new shape him selfe, namelie in that booke, wherin he purposed, to leaue to posteritie, the glorio of his witte? yea forsoth, that he did. And this is not my gessing and gathering, nor onelie performed by Tullie in verie d eed, but vttered also by Tullie in plaine wordes: to teach other men thereby, what they should do, in taking like matter in hand. conceit and purpose therein, by the mouth of the wisest man in all that companie: for sayth Sc aeuola him selfe , Cur non imitamur, Crasse, Socratem illum, qui est in Ph aedro Platonis &c . purposelie and mindfullie bend him selfe to a of those bookes, marke I pray you, how curious Tullie is to vtter his purpose and doyng therein, writing thus to Atticus.

Huic ioculatori ae disputationi senem illum vt nor as, interesse sane nolui  . doynges herein, men that be idle, and ignorant, and enuious of other mens diligence and well doinges, would haue sworne that Tullie had neuer mynded any soch thing, but that of a precise curiositie, we sayne and forge and father soch thinges of Tullie, as he neuer ment in d eed. I write this, not for nought: for I haue heard some both well learned, and otherwayes verie wise, that by their lustie misliking of soch diligence, haue drawen back the forwardnes of verie good wittes. But euen as such men them selues, do sometymes stumble vpon doyng well by chance and benefite of good witte, so would I haue our scholer alwayes able to do well by order of learnyng and right skill of iudgement. Concernyng Imitation, many learned men haue written, with moch diuersitie for the matter, and therfore with great contrarietie and some stomacke amongest them selues. I haue read as many as I could get diligentlie, and what I thinke of euerie one of them, I will fr eelie say my mynde. With which freedome I trust good men will beare, bicause it shall tend to neither spitefull nor harmefull controuersie. 276 In  Tullie, it is well touched, shortlie taught, not fullie declared by Ant. in 2. de Orat : and afterward in Orat. ad Brutum , for the liking and misliking of  Isocrates: and the contrarie iudgement of Tullie Asiatico . 277 Dionis.

Erasmus, beyng more occupied in spying other mens 279 faultes, than declaryng his owne aduise, is mistaken of many, to the great hurt of studie, for his authoritie sake. For he writeth rightlie, rightlie vnderstanded: he and  Longolius onelie differing in this, that the one s eemeth to giue ouermoch, the other ouer litle, to him, whom they both, best loued, and chiefly allowed of all other. 280 Budaeus in his Commentaries roughlie and obscurelie after his kinde of writyng: and for the matter, caryed somwhat out of the way in ouermuch misliking the Imitation of Tullie. 281 Phil. Melanctthon, learnedlie and trewlie. Camerarius largely with a learned iudgement but somewhat confusedly, and with ouer rough a stile. Sambucus, largely, with a right iudgement but somewhat a crooked silte. Sturmius de Nobilitate literata, & de Amissa dicendi ratione , farre best of all, in myne opinion, that euer tooke this matter in hand. For all the rest, declare chiefly this point, whether one, or many, or all, are to be followed: but Sturmius onelie hath most learnedlie declared, who is to be followed, what is to be followed, and the best point of all, by what way & order, trew Imitatio is rightlie to be exercised. And although Sturmius herein doth farre passe all other, yet hath he not so fullie and perfitelie done it, as I do wishe he had, and as I know he could. For though he hath done it persitelie for precept, yet hath he not done it perfitelie enough for example: which he did, neither for lacke of skill, nor by negligence, but of purpose, conteted with one or two examples, bicause he was mynded in those two bookes, to write of it both shortlie, and also had to touch other matters. Barthol. Riccius Ferrariensis also hath written learnedlie, diligentlie and verie largelie of this matter euen as h ee did before verie well de Apparatu lingu ae Lat . He writeth the better in myne opinion, bicause his whole doctrine, iudgement, and order, semeth to be borowed out of Io. Stur bookes. He addeth also examples, the best kinde of teaching: wherein he doth well, but not well enough: in d eede, he committeth no faulte, but yet, deserueth small praise. He is content with the meane, and followeth not the best: as a man, that would feede vpon Acornes, whan he may eate, as good cheape, the finest wheat bread. He teacheth for example, where and how, two or three late  Italian Poetes do follow Virgil: and how Virgil him selfe in the storie of Dido, doth wholie Imitate Catullus in the like matter of Adriadna: Wherein I like better his diligence and order of teaching, than his iudgemet in choice of examples for Imitation . But, if he had done thus: if he had declared where and how, how oft and how many wayes Virgil doth folow Homer, as for example the coming of Vlysses to Alcynous and Calypso, games running, wrestling, and shoting, that Achilles maketh in Homer, of Achilles, with the harnesse of Æneas, and the maner of making of them both by Vulcane: The notable combate betwixt Achilles and Hector, with as notable a combate betwixt Æneas and Turmis. The going downe to hell of Vlysses in Homer, with the going downe to hell of Æneas in Virgil: and other places infinite mo, as similitudes, narrations, messages, discriptions of persones, places, battels, tempestes, shipwrackes, and common places for diuerse purposes, which be as precisely taken out of Homer, as euer did Painter in London follow the picture of any faire personage. And whe thies places had bene gathered together by this way of diligence than to haue conferred them together by this order of teaching as, diligently to marke what is kept and vsed in either author, in wordes, in sentences, in matter: what is added: what is left out: what ordered otherwise, either pr aeponendo, interponendo , or postponendo : And what is altered for any respect, in word, phrase, sentence, figure, reason, argument, or by any way of circumstance: If  Riccius had done this, he had not onely bene well liked, for his diligence in teaching, but also iustlie commended for his right iudgement in right choice of examples for the best Imitation . Riccius also for Imitation of prose declareth where and how Longolius both folow  Tullie, but as for Longolius, I would not haue him the patern of our Imitation . In d eede: in  Longolius shoppe, be proper and faire shewing colers, but as for shape, figure, and naturall cumlines, by the iudgement of best iudging artificers, he is rather allowed as one to be borne withall, than speciallie commended, as one chieflie to be folowed. If Riccius had taken for his exaples, where Tullie him selfe foloweth either Plato or Demosthenes, he had shot than at the right marke. But to excuse Riccius, somwhat, though I can not fullie defend him, it may be sayd, his purpose was, to teach onelie the Latin tong, when thys way that I do wish, to toyne Virgil requireth a cunning and persite Master in both the tonges. It is my wish in d eede, and that by good reason: For who so euer will write well of any matter, must labor to expresse that, that is perfite, and not to stay and content himselfe with the meane: yea, I say farder, though it be not vnposible, yet it is verie rare, and meruelous hard, to proue excellent in the Latin tong, for him that is not also well s eene in the Greeke tong. Tullie himselfe, most excellent of nature, most diligent in labor, brought vp from his cradle, in that palce, and in that tyme, where and whan the Latin tong most florished naturallie in euery mans mouth, yet was not his owne tong able it selfe to make him so cunning in his owne tong, as he was in d eede: but the knowledge and Imitation of the Gr eeke tong withall. This he confesseth himselfe: this he vttereth in many places, as those can tell best, that vse to read him most. Therefore thou, that shotest at perfection in the Latin tong, thinke not thy selfe wiser than Tullie was, in choice of the way, that leadeth rightlie to the same: thinke not thy witte better than Tullies was, as though that may serue th ee that was not sufficient for him. For euen as a hauke flieth not hie with one wing: euen so a man reacheth not to excellency with one tong. I haue bene a looker on in the Cokpit of learning thies many yeares: And one Cock onelie haue I knowne, which with one wing, euen at this day, doth passe all other, in myne opinion, that euer I saw in any pitte in England, though they had two winges. Yet neuerthelesse, to flie well with one wing, to runne fast with one leg, be rather, rare Maistreis moch to be merueled at, than sure examples safelie to be folowed. A Bushop that now liueth, a good man, whose iudgement in Religion I better like, than his opinion in persitnes in other learning, said once vnto me: we haue no nede now of the Gr eeke tong, when all thinges be translated into Latin. But the good ma vnderstood not, that euen the best translation, is, for mere necessitie, but an cuill imped wing to flie withall, or a heuie stompe leg of wood to go withall: soch, the hier they flie, the sooner they falter and faill: the faster they runne, the ofter they stumble, and sorer they fall. Soch as will nedes so flie, may flie at a Pye, and catch a Dawe: And soch runners, as commonlie, they shoue and sholder to stand formost, yet in the end they cum behind others & deserue but the hopshakles, if the Masters of the game be right iudgers. 283 Therefore in perusing thus, so many diuerse bookes for Imitation , it came into my head that a verie profitable booke might be made de Imitatione , after an other sort, than euer yet was attempted of that matter, conteyning a certaine fewe fitte preceptes, vnto the which should be gathered and applied plentie of examples, out of the choisest authors of both the tonges. This worke would stand, rather in good diligence, for the gathering, and right iudgement for the apte applying of those examples: than any great learning or vtterance at all. The doing thereof, would be more pleasant, than painful, & would bring also moch proffet to all that should read it, and great praise to him would take it in hand, with iust desert of thankes. Erasmus, giuyng him selfe to read ouer all Authors 284 of readyng: that is, to note out by the way, three speciall pointes: All Adagies, all similitudes, and all wittie sayinges of most notable personages: And so, by one labour, he left to posteritie, three notable bookes, & namelie two his Chiliades, Apophthegmata and Similia . Likewise, if a good student would bend him selfe to read diligently ouer  Tullie, Isocrates, & Demosthenes with his orations, 286 & Aristotle with his Khetorickes: which  287 fiue of all other, be those, whom  Tullie best loued, 288 & specially followed: & would marke diligetly  289 in Tullie, where he both exprimere or effingere (which be the verie propre wordes of (Imitation) either, Copiam Platonis or venustate Xenophontis, suauitatem Isocratis , or vim Demosthenis, propriam & puram subtilitatem Aristotelis , and not onelie write out the places diligentlie, and lay them together orderlie, but also to conferre them with skillfull iudgement by those few rules, which I haue expressed now twise before: if that diligence were taken, if that order were vsed, what persite knowledge of both the tonges, what readie and pithie vtterance in all matters, what right and deepe iudgement in all kinde of learnyng would follow, is scarse credible to be beleued. These bookes, be not many, nor long, nor rude in speach, nor meane in matter, but next the Maiestie of Gods holie word, most worthie for a man, the louer of learning and honestie, to spend his life in. Yea, I haue heard worthie M. Cheke many tymes say: I would haue a good student passe and iorney through all Authors both Greke and Latin: but he that will dwell in these few bookes onelie: first, in Gods holie Bible, and than ioyne with it, Tullie in Latin, Plato, Aristotle: Xenophon: Isocrates: and Demosthenes: in Greke: must nedes proue an excellent man. Some men alreadie in our dayes, haue put to their helping handes, to this worke of Imitation. As Perionius, Her .  290 Stephanus in dictionario Ciceroniano , and P. Victorius most praise worthelie of all, in that his learned worke conteyning xxv. bookes de varia lectione : in which bookes be ioyned diligentlie together the best Authors of both the tonges where one both s eeme to imitate an other. no more but common porters, caryers, and bringers of matter and stuffe togither. They order nothing: They lay before you, what is done: they do not teach you, how it is done: They busie not them selues with forme of buildyng: They do not declare, this stuffe is thus framed by Demosthenes, and thus and thus by Tullie, and so likewise in Xenophon, Plato and Isocrates sufficientlie declared before. 291 The like diligence I would with to be taken in  Pindar and Horace an equall match for all respectes. In Tragedies, (the goodliest Argument of all, and for the vse, either of a learned preacher, or a Ciuill Ientleman, more profitable than Homer, Pindar, Virgill, and Horace: Yea comparable in myne opinion, with the doctrine of Aristotle,  292 Plato, and Xenophon, ) the Grecians, Sophocles and Euripides far ouer match our Seneca in Latin, namely in ;![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif)  [illeg.] elocutio and verse be verie commendable for his tyme. And for the matters of Hercules, Thebes, Hippolytus, and Troie, his Imitation is to be gathered into the same booke, and to be be tryed by the same touchstone, as is spoken before. could bring excellent learning, and br eede stayde iudgement, in taking any like matter in hand. 293 Onely  Liuie were a sufficient taske for one mans studie, to compare him, first with his fellow for all respectes,  294 Dion. Halicarnass aeus: who both, liued in one tyme: tooke both one historie in hand to write: deserued both like prayse  295 of learnyng and eloquence. Than with  Polybius that wise writer, whom Liuie professeth to follow: & if he would denie it, yet it is plaine, that the best part of the thyrd Decade in Liuie, is in a maner translated out of the thyrd and rest of 296 curiouslie bent, as may well appeare by that one  297 Oration of those of  Campania, asking aide of the Romanes agaynst the Samnites, which is wholie taken, Sentence, aide of the Athenienses against them of 298 togither, he should easelie perceiue, that I do say trew. A booke, thus wholie filled with examples of Imitatio, first out of Tullie, compared with Plato, Xenophon, Isocrates, Demosthenes and Aristotle: than out of Virgil and Horace, with Homer and Pindar: next out of Seneca Thucydides, Polibius and Halicarnass aeus, gathered with good diligence, and compared with right order, as I haue expressed before, were an other maner of worke for all kinde of learning, & namely for eloquence, than be those cold gatheringes of Macrobius, Hessus, Perionius, Stephanus, and Victorius, which may be vsed, as I sayd before, in this case, as porters and caryers, deseruing like prayse, as soch men do wages, but onely Sturmius is he, out of who, the trew suruey and whole workemanship is speciallie to be learned. I trust, this my writyng shall giue some good student occasion, to take some p eece in hand of this worke of Imitation. And as I had rather haue any do it, than my selfe, yet  299 surelie my selfe rather tha none at all. And by Gods grace, if God do lend me life, with health, free laysure and libertie, with good likyng and a merie hart, I will turne the best part of my studie and tyme, to toyle in one or other peece of this worke of Imitation. This diligence to gather examples, to giue light and vnderstandyng to good preceptes, is no new inuention, but speciallie vsed of the best Authors and oldest writers. For Aristotle him selfe, as Diog. Laertius declareth) when he 300 had written that goodlie booke of the  Topickes, did gather out of stories and Orators, so many examples as filled xv. 301 bookes, onelie to expresse the rules of his  Topickes. These were the Commentaries, that Aristotle thought fit for hys Topickes: And therfore to speake as I thinke, I neuer saw yet any Commentarie vpon Aristotles Logicke, either in declaryng scholepoynt rules, than in gathering fit examples for vse and vtterance, either by pen or talke. For preceptes in all Authors, and namelie in Aristotle, without applying vnto them, the Imitation of examples, be hard, drie, and cold, and therfore barrayn, vnfruitfull and vnpleasant. But Aristotle, namelie in his Topickes and Elenches, should be, not onelie fruitfull, but also pleasant to, if examples out of Plato, and other good Authors, were diligentlie gathered, and aptlie applied vnto his most persit preceptes there. And it is notable, that my frende Sturmius 302 writeth herein, that there is no precept in  Aristotles Topickes, say, that an excellent learned man, Tomitanus in Italie, hath expressed euerie fallacion in Aristotle, with diuerse examples out of Plato. Would to God, I might once s ee, some worthie student of Aristotle the one, with the examples of the other. For such a labor, were one speciall p eece of that worke of Imitation, which I do wishe were gathered together in one Volume. Cambrige, at my first comming thither, but not at my going away, committed this fault in reading the preceptes of Aristotle without the examples of other Authors: But herein, in my tyme thies men of worthie memorie, M. Redman, M. Cheke, M. Smith, M. Haddon, M. Watson, put so to their helping handes, as that vniuersitie, and all studentes there, as long as learning shall last, shall be bounde vnto them, if that trade in studie be trewlie folowed, which those men left behinde them there. By this small mention of Cambridge, I am caryed into thr ee imaginations: first, into a sweete remembrance of my tyme spent there: than, into som carefull thoughts, for the greuous alteration that folowed sone after: lastlie, into much ioy to heare tell, of the good recouerie and earnest for wardnes in all good learning there agayne. To vtter theis my thoughts somwhat more largelie, were somwhat beside my matter, yet not very farre out of the way, bycause it shall wholy tend to the good encoragement and right consideration of learning, which is my full purpose in writing this litle booke: whereby also shall well appeare this sentence to be most trewe, that onely good men, by their gouernment & example, make happie times, in euery degree and state. Master of  S. Iohnes Colledge, when I came thether: A man meanelie learned himselfe, but not meanely affectioned to set forward learning in others. He found that Colledge spending scarse two hundred markes by yeare: he left it spending a thousand markes and more. Which he procured, not with his mony, but by his wisdome: not chargeablie bought by him, but liberallie geuen by others by his meane, for the zeale & honor they bare to learning. And that which is worthy of memorie, all thies giuers were almost Forthenmen: who being liberallie rewarded in the seruice of their Prince, bestowed it as liberallie for the good of their Contrie. Som men thought therefore, that D. Medcalfe 304 was parciall to Northenmen, but sure I am of this, that Northrenme were parciall, in doing more good, and geuing more lades to ye forderance of learning, than any other contrie me, in those dayes, did: which d eede should haue bene, rather an example of goodnes, for other to folowe, than matter of malice, for any to enuie, as some there were that did. Trewly,  D. Medcalfe was parciall to none: but indifferent to all: a master for the whole, a father to euery one, in that Colledge. There was none so poore, if he had, either wil to goodnes, or wit to learning, that could lacke being there, or should depart from thence for any n eed. I am witnes my selfe, that mony many tymes was brought into yong mens studies by strangers whom they knew not. In which doing, this worthy Nicolaus folowed the steppes of good olde S. Nicolaus, that learned Bishop. He was a Papist in d eede, but would to God, amonges all vs Protestats I might once see but one, that would winne like praise, in doing like good, for the aduauncement of learning and vertue. And yet, though he were a Papist, if any yong man, geuen to new learning (as they termed it went beyond his fellowes, in witte, labor, and towardnes, euen the same, neyther lacked, open praise to encorage him, nor priuate exhibition to mainteyne hym, as worthy Syr I. Cheke, if he were aliue would beare good witnes and so can many mo. I my selfe one of the meanest of a great number, in that Colledge, because there appeared in me som small shew of towardnes and diligence, lacked not his fauor to forder me in learning. And being a boy, new Bacheler of arte, I chanced amonges my companions to speake against the Pope: which matter was than in euery mans mouth, bycause D. Haines and D. Skippe were cum from the Court, to debate the same matter, by preaching and disputation in the vniuersitie. This hapned the same tyme, when I stoode to be felow there: my taulke came to D. Medcalfes eare: I was called before him and the Seniores: and after greuous rebuke, & some punishment, open warning was geuen to all the felowes, none to be so hardie to geue me his voice at that election. And yet for all those open threates, the good father himselfe priuilie procured, that I should euen than be chosen felow. But, the election being done, he made countinance of great discontentation thereat. This good mans goodnes, and fatherlie discretion, vsed towardes me that one day, shall neuer out of my remembrance all the dayes of my life. And for the same cause, haue I put it here, in this small record of learning. For next Gods prouidence, surely that day, was by that good fathers meanes, Dies natalis , to me, for the whole foundation of the poore learning I haue, and of all the furderance, that hetherto else where I haue obteyned. aboundantlie ouer all that Colledge, and brake out also to norishe good wittes in euery part of that vniuersitie: whereby, at his departing thence, he left soch a companie of fellowes and scholers in S. Iohnes Colledge, as can svarse be found now in som whole vniuersitie: which, either for diuinitie, on the one side or other, or for Ciuill seruice to their Prince and contrie, haue bene, and are yet to this day, notable ornaments to this whole Realme: Yea S. Iohnes did the so florish, as Trinitie college, that Princely house now, at the first erectio, was but Colonia deducta out of  S. Ihones, not onelie for their Master, fellowes, and scholers, but also, which is more, for their whole, both order of learning, and discipline of maners: & yet to this day, it neuer tooke Master but such as was bred vp before in S. Iohnes: doing the dewtie of a good Colonia to her Metropolis , as the auncient Cities in Greice and some yet in Italie, at this day, are accustomed to do. S. Iohnes stoode in this state, vntill those heuie tymes, and that greuous change that chanced. An. 1553\. whan mo persite scholers were dispersed from thence in one moneth, than many yeares can reare vp againe. For, whan Apor de Sylua had passed the seas, and fastned his foote againe in  305 England, not onely the two faire groues of learning in England were eyther cut vp, by the roote, or troden downe to the ground and wholie went to wracke, but the yong spring there, and euerie where else, was pitifullie nipt and ouertroden by very beastes, and also the fairest standers of all; were rooted vp, and cast into the fire, to the great weakning euen at this day of Christes Chirch in England, both for Religion and learning. And what good could chance than to the vniuersities, whan som of the greatest, though not of the wisest nor best learned, nor best men neither of that side, did labor to perswade, that ignorance was better than knowledge, which they ment, not for the laitie onelie, but also for the greatest rable of their spiritualtie, what other pretense openlie so euer they made: and therefore did som of them at Cambrige (whom I will not name openlie,) cause hedge priestes fette out of the contrie, to be made fellowes in the vniuersitie: saying, in their talke priuilie, and declaring by their d eedes openlie, that he was, felow good enough for their tyme, if he could were a gowne and a tipet cumlie, and haue hys crowne thorne aire and roundlie, and could turne his Portesse and pie readilie: which I speake not to reproue any order either of apparell, or other dewtie, that may be well and indifferentlie vsed, but to note the miserie of that time, whan the benefites prouided for learning were so sowlie misused. And what was the frute of this seade? Uerely, iudgement in doctrine was wholy altered: order in discipline very sore changed: the loue of good learning, began sodenly to war cold: the knowledge of the tonges (in spite of some that therein had florished) was manifestly contemned: and so, ye way of right studie purposely peruerted: the choice of good authors of mallice confownded. Olde sophistrie (I say not well) not olde, but that new rotten sophistrie began to beard and sholder logicke in her owne tong: yea, I know, that heades were cast together, and counsell deuised, that Duns , with all the rable of barbarous questionistes, should haue dispossessed of their place and resumes,  Aristotle, Plato, Tullie, and Demosthenes, when good M. Redman, and those two worthy starres of that vniuersitie, M. Cheke, and M. Smith, with their scholers, had brought to florishe as notable in cambrige, as euer they did in Grece and in Italie: 306 and for the doctrine of those fowre, the fowre pillers of learning, Cambrige than geuing no place to no vniuersitie, neither in France, Spaine, Germanie, nor Italie. Also in outward behauiour, than began simplicitie in apparell, to be layd aside: Courtlie galantnes to be taken vp: frugalitie in diet was priuately misliked: Towne going to good cheare 307 openly vsed: honest pastimes, ioyned with labor, left of in the fieldes: vnthrifty and idle games, haunted corners, and occupied the nightes: contention in youth, no where for learning: factions in the elders euery where for trifles. All which miseries at length, by Gods prouidence, had their end 16\. Nouemb. 1558. Since which tyme, the yong spring hath shot vp so faire, as now there be in Cambrige againe, many goodly plantes (as did well appeare at the Qu eenes Maiesties late being there) which are like to grow to mightie great timber, to the honor of learning, and great good of their contrie, if they may stand their tyme, as the best plantes there were wont to do: and if som old dotterell trees, with standing ouer nie them, and dropping vpon them, do not either hinder, or crooke their growing, wherein my feare is ye lesse, seing so worthie a Iustice of an Oyre hath the present ouersight of that whole chace, who was himselfe somtym, in the fairest spring that euer was there of learning, one of the forwardest yong plantes, in all that worthy College of S. Ihones: who now by grace is growne to soch greatnesse, as, in the temperate and quiet shade of his wisdome, next the prouidece of God, and goodnes of one, in theis our daies, Religio for sinceritie, liter ae for order and aduauncement, Respub . for happie and quiet gouernment, haue to great reioysing of all good men, speciallie reposed them selues. Now to returne to that Question, whether one, a few, many or all, are to be folowed, my aunswere shalbe short: All, for him that is desirous to know all: yea, the worst of all, as Questionistes, and all the barbarous nation of scholemen, helpe for one or other consideration: But in euerie separate kinde of learnyng and studie, by it selfe, ye must follow, choselie a few, and chieflie some one, and that namelie in our schole of eloquence, either for penne or talke. And as in portiaeure and paintyng, wise men chose not that workman, that can onelie make a faire hand, or a well facioned legge but soch one, as can furnish vp fullie, all the fetures of of the whole body, of a man, woman and child: and with all is able to, by good skill, to giue to euerie one of these thr ee, in their proper kinde, the right forme, the trew figure, the naturall color, that is fit and dew, to the dignitie of a man, to the bewtie of a woman, to the sw eetnes of a yong babe: euen likewise, do we seeke soch one in our schole to folow, who is able alwayes, in all matters, to teach plainlie, to delite pleasantlie, and to cary away by force of wife talke, all that shall heare or read him: and is so excellent in deed, as witte is able, or wishe can hope, to attaine vnto: And this not onelie to serue in the Latin or Greke tong, but also in our own English language. But yet, bicause the prouidence of God hath left vnto vs in no other tong, saue onelie in the Greke and Latin tong, the trew preceptes, and perfite examples of eloquence, therefore must we s eeke in the Authors onelie of those two tonges, the trew Paterne of Eloquence, if in any other mother tong we looke to attaine, either to perfit vtterance of it our selues, or skilfull iudgement of it in others. And now to know, what Author doth medld onelie with some one p eece and member of eloquence, and who doth perfitelie make vp the whole bodie, I will declare, as I can call to remembrance to goodlie talke, that I haue had oftentymes, of the trew difference of Authors, with that Ientleman of worthie memorie, my dearest frend, and teacher of all the litle poore learning I haue, Syr Iohn Cheke. The trew difference of Authors is best knowne, per diuersa genera dicendi , that euerie one vsed. And therfore here I will deuide genus dicendi , not into these thr ee, Tenu e, mediocre, & grande , but as the matter of euerie Author requireth, as Poeticum. ------ Historicum. in Genus.   Philosophicum. Oratorium. These differre one from an other, in choice of wordes, in framyng of Sentences, in handling of Argumentes, and vse of right forme, figure, and number, proper and fitte for euerie matter, and euerie one of these is diuers also in it selfe, as the first. Comicum. ------ Tragicum. Poeticum, in   Epicum. Melicum. Seneca, Virgil, Horace, or els Aristophanus, Sophocles, Homer, and Pindar, and shall diligetly marke the difference they vse, in proprietie of wordes, in forme of sentence, in handlying of their matter, he shall easelie perceiue, what is fitte and decorum in euerie one, to the trew vse of perfite Imitation. Whan  M. Watson in S. Iohns College at Cambrige wrote his excellent Tragedie of Absalon, M. Cheke, he and I, for that part of trew Imitation, had many pleasant talkes togither, in comparing the preceptes of Aristotle and Horace de Arte Poetica , with the examples of Euripides, Sophocles, and Seneca . Few men, in writyng of Tragedies in our dayes, haue shot at this marke, Some in England, moe in France, Germanie, and Italie, also haue written Tragedies in our tyme: of the which, not one I am sure is able to abyde the trew touch of Aristotles preceptes, and Euripides examples, saue onely two, that euer I saw, M. Watsons Absalon, and Georgius Buckananus Iephthe . One man in Cambrige, well liked of many, but best liked of him selfe, was many tymes bold and busie, to bryng matters vpon stages, which he called Tragedies. In one, wherby he looked to wynne his spurres, and whereat many ignorant felowes fast clapped their handes, he began the Protasis with Troch aeijs Octonarijs : which kinde of verse, as it is but seldome and rare in Tragedies, so is it neuer vsed, saue onelie in Epitasi : whan the Tragedie is hiest and hotest, and full of greatest troubles. I remember ful well what  M. Watson merelie sayd vnto me of his blindnesse and boldnes in that behalfe although an other maner care of perfection, with a feare and reuerence of the iudgement of the best learned: Who to this day would neuer suffer, yet his Absalon to go abroad, and that onelie, bicause, in locis paribus, Anapestus is twise or thrise vsed in stede of  Iambus. A smal faulte, and such one, as perchance would neuer be marked, no neither in Italie nor France . This I write, not so much, to note the first, or praise the last, as to leaue in memorie of writing, for good example to posteritie, what perfection, in any tyme, was, most diligentlie sought for in like maner, in all kinde of learnyng, in that most worthie College of S. Iohns in Cambrige. Diaria. ------ Annales. Historicum in   Commentarios. Iustam Historiam. For what proprietie in wordes, simplicitie in sentences, plainnesse and light, is cumelie for these kindes, C aesar and Liuie, for the two last, are perfite examples of Imitation: And for the two first, the old paternes be lost, and as for some that be present and of late tyme, they be fitter to be read once for some pleasure, than oft to be perused, for any good Imitation of them. in Sermonem, as officia Cic. & Eth. Arift. ------ Philosophicum in   Contentionem. learnyng, and right Imitation therof, Carolus Sigonius hath written of late, both learnedlie and eloloquentlie: but best of all my frende Ioan. Sturmius in hys Commentaries vpon Gorgias Platonis , which booke I haue Humile. ------ Oratorium in   Mediocre. Sublime. as Lycias, Isocrates, and Demosthenes : and all 308 three, in onelie  Demosthenes, in diuerse orations as contra 309 Olimpiodorum, in leptinem, & pro Ctesiphonte . And trew it is,  310 that  Hermogines writeth of Demosthenes, that all formes of Eloquence be perfite in him. In Ciceroes Orations, 311 Medium & sublime be most excellentlie handled, but Humile in his Orations is seldome sene: yet neuerthelesse in other bookes, as in some part of his offices,  & specially in Partitiombus , he is comparable in hoc humili & disciplinabili genere, euen with the best that euer wrote in  Greke . But of Cicero more fullie in fitter place. And thus, the trew difference of stiles, in euerie Author, and euerie kinde of learnyng may easelie be knowne by this diuision. Poeticum. ------ Historicum. in Genus   Philosophicum. Oratorium . Which I thought in this place to touch onelie, not to prosecute at large, bicause, God willyng, in the Latin tong, I will fullie handle it, in my booke de Imitatione . Now, to touch more particularlie, which of those Authors, that be now most commonlie in mens handes, will some affourd you some p eece of Eloquence, and what maner a peece of eloquence, and what is to be like and folowed, and what to be misliked and eschewed in them: and how some agayne will furnish you fully withall, rightly, and wisely considered, somwhat I will write as I haue heard Syr Ihon Cheke many tymes say. The Latin tong, concerning any part of purenesse of it, from the spring, to the decay of the same, did not endure moch longer, than is the life of a well aged man, scarse one hundred yeares from the tyme of the last Scipio Africanus and L aelius, to the Empire of Augustus . And it is notable, that Velleius Paterculus writeth of  Tullie, how that the perfection of eloquence did so remayne onelie in him and in his time, as before him, were few, which might moch delight a man, or after him any, worthy admiration, but soch as Tullie might haue s eene, and such as might haue seene Tullie . And good cause why: for no perfection is durable. Encrease hath a time, & decay likewise, but all perfit ripenesse remaineth but a momet: as is plainly seen in fruits, plummes and cherries: but more sensibly in flowers, as Roses & such like, and yet as trewlie in all greater matters. For what naturallie, can go no hier, must naturallie yeld & stoupe againe. Of this short tyme of any purenesse of the Latin tong, for the first fortie yeare of it, and all the tyme before, we haue no p eece of learning left, saue Plautus and Terence, with a litle rude vnperfit pamflet of the elder Cato . And as for Plautus, except the scholemaster be able to make wife and ware choice, first in proprietie of wordes, than in framing of Phrases and sentences, and chieflie in choice of honestie of matter, your scholer were better to play, the learne all that is in him. But surelie, if iudgement for the tong, and direction for the maners, be wisely ioyned with the diligent reading of Plautus, than trewlie Plautus, for that purenesse of the Latin tong in Rome, whan Rome did most florish in well doing, and so thereby, in well speaking also, is soch a plentifull storehose, for common eloquence, in meane matters, and all priuate mens affaires, as the Latin tong, for that respect, bath not the like agayne. Whan I remember the worthy tyme of Rome, wherein Plautus did liue, I must nedes honor the talke of that tyme, which we s ee Plautus doth vse. Terence is also a storehouse of the same tong, for an other tyme, following soone after, & although he be not so full & plentiful as Plautus is, for multitude of matters, & diuersitie of wordes, yet his wordes, be chosen so purelie, placed so orderly, and all his stuffe so neetlie packed vp, and wittely compassed in cuerie place, as, by all wise mens iudgement, he is counted the cunninger workeman, and to haue his shop, for the rowme that is in it, more finely appointed, and trimlier ordered, than Plautus is. specially considered The matter, the vtterance, the words, the meter. The matter in both, is altogether within the compasse of the meanest means maners, and doth not stretch to any thing of any great weight at all, but standeth chiefly in vtteryng the thoughtes and conditions of hard fathers, foolish mothers, vnthrifty yong men, craftie seruantes, sotle bawdes, and wilie harlots, and so, is moch spent, in finding out fine setches, and packing vp pelting matters, soch as in London commonlie cum to the hearing of the Masters of Bride well. Here is base stuffe for that scholer, that should be cum hereafter, either a good minister in Religion, or a Ciuill Ientleman in seruice of his Prince and contrie: except the preacher do know soch matters to confute them, whan ignorance surelie in all soch thinges were better for a Ciuill Ientleman, than knowlege. And thus, for matter, both Plautus and Terence, be like meane painters, that worke by halfes, and be cunning onelie, in making the worst part of the picture, as if one were skilfull in painting the bodie of a naked person, from the nauell downward, but nothing else. pure and proper: And for one respect, Terence is to be embraced aboue all that euer wrote in hys kinde of argument: Bicause it is well known, by good recorde of learning, and that by Ciceroes owne witnes that some Comedies bearyng Terence name, were written by worthy Scipio, and wise Lilius, and namely Heauton . and Adelphi. And therefore as oft as I reade those Comedies, so oft doth sound in myne eare, the pure fine talke of Rome, which was vsed by the floure of the worthiest nobilitie that euer Rome bred. Let the wisest man, and best learned that liueth, read aduisedlie ouer, the first scene of Heauton, and the first scene of Adelphi, and let him consideratlie iudge, whether it is the talke of a seruile stranger borne, or rather euen that milde eloquent wise speach, which Cicero in Brutus doth so liuely expresse in L aelius . And yet neuerthelesse, in all this good proprietie of wordes, and purenesse of phrases which be in Terence, ye must not follow him alwayes in placing of them, bicause for the meter sake, some wordes in him, somtyme, be driuen awrie, which require a straighter placing in plaine prose, if ye will forme, as I would ye should do, your speach and writing, to that excellent perfitnesse, which was onely in Tullie, or onelie in Tullies tyme. 312 The meter and verse of  Plautus and Terence be verie meane, and not to be followed: which is not their reproch, but the fault of the tyme, wherein they wrote, whan no kinde of Poetrie, in the Latin tong, was brought to perfection, as doth well appeare in the fragmentes of Ennius, Cerilius, be compared with rightskil, with Homer, Euripides, Aristophanes, and other in Gr eeke of like sort.  Cicero him selfe doth complaine of this vnperfitnes, but more plainly Quintilian, saying, in Com aedia maxime claudicamus, et vix leuem consequimur vmbram : and most earnestly of all Horace in Arte Poetica , which he doth namely propter carmen Iambicum , and referreth all good studentes herein to the Imitation of the Gr eeke tong, saying. Exemplaria Gr aeca nocturna versate manu, versate diurna . This matter maketh me gladly remember, my sw eete tyme spent at Cambrige, and the pleasant talke which I the olde Latin Poets, but also in our new English Rymers at this day. They wished as Virgil and Horace were not wedded to follow the faultes of former fathers (a shrewd mariage in greater matters) but by right Imitation of the perfit Grecias, had brought Poetrie to perfitnesse also in the Latin tong, that we Englishmen likewise would acknowledge and vnderstand rightfully our rude beggerly ryming, brought first into Italie by  Gothes and Hunnes , whan all good verses and all good learning to, were destroyd by them: and after caryed into France and Germanie: and at last receyued into England by men of excellent wit in d eede, but of small learning, and lesse iudgement in that behalfe. But now, when men know the difference, and haue the examples, both of the best, and of the worst, surelie, to follow rather the Gothes in Ryming, than the Gr eekes in trew versifyng, were euen to eate ackornes with swyne, when we may freely eate wheate bread emonges men. In deede, Chauser, Th. Norton, of Bristow, my L. of Surrey, M. Wiat, Th. Phaer, and other Ientlemen, in translating Ouide, Palingenius, and Seneca, haue gone as farre to their great praise, as the copie they followed could cary them, but, if soch good wittes, and forward diligence, had bene directed to follow the best examples, and not haue bene caryed by tyme and custome, to content themselues with that barbarous and rude Ryming, emonges their other morthy praises, which they haue iustly deserued, this had not bene the least, to be counted emonges men of learning and skill, more like vnto the Grecians, than vnto the Gothians, in handling of their verse. In d eed, our English tong, hauing in vse chiefly, wordes of one syllable which commonly be long, doth not well receiue the nature of Carmen Heroicum , bicause dastylus , the aptest foote for that verse, coteining one long  & two short, is seldom therefore found in English: and doth also rather Chapiter de Compositione , geueth this lesson de Monasyllabis , before me: and in the same place doth iustlie inuey against all Ryming, that if there be any, who be angrie with me, for misliking of Ryming, may be angry for company to, with  Quintilian also, for the same thing: And yet Quintilian had not so iust cause to mislike of it than, as me haue at this day. And although Carmen Exametrum doth rather trotte and hoble, than runne smothly in our English tong, yet I am sure, our English tong will receiue carmen Iambicum as naturallie, as either  Greke or Latin . But for ignorance, men ca not like, & for idlenes, men will not labor, to cum to any perfitenes at all. For, as the worthie Poetes in Athens and Rome, were more carefull to satisfie the iudgement of one learned, than rashe in pleasing the humor of a rude multitude, euen so if men in England now, had the like reuerend regard to learning skill and iudgement, and durst not presume to write, except they came with the like learnyng, and also did vse like diligence, in searchyng out, not onelie iust measure in euerie meter, as euerie ignorant person may easely do, but also trew quantitie in euery foote and sillable, as onelie the learned shalbe able to do, and as the Grekes can easely recken vp fourten sillabes, and easelie stumble on euery Ryme, either durst not, for lacke of such learnyng: or els would not, in auoyding such labor, be so busie, as euerie where they be: and shoppes in London should not be so full of lewd and rude rymes, as commonlie they are. But now, the ripest of tong, be readiest to write: And many dayly in setting out bookes and balettes make great shew of blossomes and buddes, in whom is neither, roote of learnyng, nor frute of wisedome at all. Some that make Chaucer in English and Petrach in Italian, their Gods in verses, and yet be not able to make trew difference, what is a fault, and what is a iust prayse, in those two worthie wittes, will moch mislike this my writyng. But such men be euen like followers of Chaucer and Petrarke, as one here in England did folow Syr Tho. More : who, being most vnlike vnto him, in wit and learnyng, neuertheles in wearing his gowne awrye vpon the one shoulder, as Syr Tho. More was wont to do, would nedes be counted lyke vnto him. This mislikyng of Ryming, beginneth not now of any newfangle singularitie, but hath bene long mislikes of many, and that of men, of greatest learnyng, and d eepest iudgemet. And soch, that defend it, do so, either for lacke of knowledge what is best, or els of verie enuie, that any should performe that in learnyng, whereunto they, as I sayd before, either for ignorance, can not, or for idlenes will not, labor to attaine vnto. And you that prayse this Ryming, bicause ye neither haue reason, why to like it, nor can shew learning to defend it, yet I will helpe you, with the authoritie of the oldest and learnedst tyme. In Grece, whan Poetrie was euen as the hiest pitch of perfitnes, one Simmias Rhodius of a certaine singularitie wrote a booke in ryming Greke verses, naming it ![](/images/inline/sbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , conteyning the fable, how  Iupiter in likenes of a swan, gat that egge vpon Leda, whereof came Castor, Pollux but none to folow it: But was presentlie contemned: and sone after, both Author and booke, so forgotten by men, and consumed by tyme, as scarse the name of either is kept in memorie of learnyng: And the like folie was neuer folowed of any, many hondred yeares after vntill ye Hunnes and Gothians, and other barbarous nations, of ignorance and rude singularitie, did reuine the same solie agayne. men, in traslating the fourth booke of  Virgill : and Gonsaluo Periz that excellent learned man, and Secretarie to 314 kyng  Philip of Spaine, in translating the Vlisses of Homer the fault of Ryming, yet neither of them hath fullie hite perfite and trew versifiyng. In d eede, they obscrue iustnumber, and euen feete: but here is the fault, that their feete: be feete without ioyntes, that is to say, not distinct by trew quantitie of sillabes: And so, soch feete, be but numme feete: and be, eue as vnfitte for a verse to turne and runne roundly withall, as feete of brasse or wood be vnweeldie to go well withall. And as a foote of wood, is a plaine shew of a manifest maine, euen so feete, in our English versifing, without quatitie and ioyntes, be sure signes, that the verse is either, borne deformed, vnnaturall and lame, and so verie vnseemlie to looke vpon, except to men that be gogle eyed the selues. The spying of this fault now is not the curiositie of English eyes, but euen the good iudgement also of the best that write in these dayes in Italie: and namelie of that worthie 315 Senese Felice Figlincci , who, writyng vpon  Aristotles Ethickes so excellentlie in Italian, as neuer did yet any one in myne opinion either in Greke or Latin, amongest other thynges both most earnestlie inuey agaynst the rude ryming of verses in that tong: And whan soeuer he expresseth Aristotles preceptes, with any example, out of Homer or Euripides, he translateth them, not after the Rymes of Petrarke , but into soch kinde of perfite verse, with like f eete and quantitie of sillabes, as he found them before in the  Greke tonge: exhortyng earnestlie all the Italian nation, to leaue of their rude barbariousnesse in ryming, and folow diligently the excellent Greke and Latin examples, in trew versifiyng. blindlie still in your foule wrong way, enuie not others, that s eeke, as wise men haue done before them, the fairest and rightest way: or els, beside the iust reproch of malice, wisemen shall trewlie iudge, that you do so, as I haue sayd and say yet agayne vnto you, bicause, either, for idlenes ye will not, or for ignorance ye can not, cum by no better your selfe. that they spying the vnperfitnes in Ennius and Plautus, by trew Imitation of Homer and Euripides , brought Poetrie to the same perfitnes in Latin, as it was in Greke, euen so those, that by the same way would benefite their tong and contrey, deserue rather thankes than disprayse in that behalfe. spying out, than in s eekyng to amend this fault in learnyng. And here, for my pleasure I purpose a litle, by the way, to play and sporte with my Master Tully : from whom commonlie I am neuer wont to dissent, He him selfe, for this point of learnyng, in his verses doth halt a litle by his leaue. He could not denic it, if he were aliue, nor those defend hym now that loue him best. This fault I lay to his charge: bicause once it pleased him, though somwhat merelie, yet oueruncurtestie, to rayle vpon poore England, obiecting both, 316 extreme beggerie, and mere barbariousnes vnto it, writyng thus vnto his frend Atticus : There is not one scruple of siluer in that whole Isle, or any one that knoweth either learnyng or letter. 317 you neuer knew, except it were as it pleased him to lighten you by some shadow, as couertlie in one place ye cofesse saying: Veritatis tantum vmbra consectamur ,  318 as your Master Plato did before you: blessed be God, I say, that sixten hudred yeare after you were dead and gone, it may trewly be sayd, that for siluer, there is more enmlie plate, in one Citie of England than is in foure of the proudest Cities in all  Italie, and take Rome for one of them. And for learnyng, beside the knowledge of all learned tongs and liberall sciences, euen your owne bookes Cicero, he as well read, and your excellent eloquence is as well liked and loued, and as trewlie folowed in England at this day, as it is now, or euer was, sence your owne tyme, in any place of Italie, either at Arpinum, litle to brag with you Cicero, where you your selfe, by your leaue, halted in some point of learnyng in your owne tong, many in England at this day go streight vp, both in trewe skill, and right doing therein. loue best, but to excuse Terence, because in his tyme, and a good while after, Poetrie was neuer perfited in Latin, vntill by trew Imitation of the Grecians, it was at length brought to perfection: And also thereby to exhorte the goodlie wittes of England, which apte by nature,  & willing by desire, geue the selues to Poetrie, that they, rightly vnderstanding the barbarous bringing in of Rymes, would labor, as  Virgil and Horace did in Latin, to make perfit also this point of learning, in our English tong. what is to be followed, and what to be exchewed in them. and there recited of Cicero for example sake, whereby the louers of learnyng may the more lament the losse of soch a worthie witte. himselfe chieflie, was the Latin tong fullie ripe, and growne to the hiest pitch of all perfection. himselfe, in Brutus de Claris Oratoribus , with w eeping wordes both witnesse. And bicause, emongs them of that tyme, there was some difference, good reason is, that of them of that tyme, should read Tullies familiar epistles aduisebly ouer, and I bel eue he shall finde small difference, for the Latin tong, either in propriety of wordes or framing of the stile, betwixt  Tullie, and those that write vnto him. As ser. Sulpitius, A. Cecinna, M. C aelius, M.et D. Bruti, A. Pollia, L. Plaucus,  319 for an assay, that Epistle namely to the Coss. and whole Senate, the eight Epistle in number, and what could be, eyther more eloquentlie, or more wiselie written, yea by Tullie himselfe, a man may iustly doubt. Thies men and Tullie, liued all in one tyme, were like in authoritie, not vnlike in learning and studie, which might be iust causes of this their equalitie in writing: And yet surely, they neyther were in d eed, nor yet were counted in means opinions, equall with Tullie in that facultie. And how is the difference hid in his Epistles? verelie, as the cunning of an expert Sea man, in a faire calme fresh Ryuer, doth litle differ from the doing of a meaner workman therein, euen so, in the short cut of a priuate letter, where, matter is common, wordes easie, and order not moch diuerse, small shew of difference can appeare. But where Tullie both set vp his saile of eloquence, in some broad d eep Argument, caried with full tyde and winde, of his witte and learnyng, all other may rather stand and looke after him, than hope to ouertake him, what course so euer he hold, either in faire or foule. Foure men onely whan the Latin tong was full ripe, be left vnto vs, who in that tyme did florish, and did leaue to posteritie, the fruite of their witte and learning: Varro, Salust, Caesar, and Cicero . Whan I say, these foure only, I am not ignorant, that eu en in the same tyme, most excellent Poetes, deseruing well of the Latin tong, as Lucretius, Cattullus, Virgill and Horace, did write: But, bicause, in this litle booke, I purpose to teach a yong scholer, to go, not to daunce: to speake, not to sing, (whan Poetes in d eed, namelie Epici and Lyrici, as these be, are fine dauncers, and trime singers, but Oratores and Historici , be those cumlie goers, and faire and wise speakers, of whom I wishe my scholer to wayte vpon first, and after in good order,  & dew tyme, to be brought forth, to the singing and dauncing schole: And for this consideration, do I name these soure, to be the onelie writers of that tyme. 320 Varro , in his bookes de lingua Latina, et Analogia as these be left mangled and patched vnto vs, both not enter there in to any great depth of eloquence, but as one caried in a small low vessell him selfe verie nie the common shore, not much vnlike the fisher me of Rye, and Hering men of Yarmouth. Who deserue by common mens opinion, small commendacion, for any cunning saling at all yet neuertheles in those bookes of  Varro good and necessarie stuffe, for that meane kinde of Argument, be verie well and learnedlie gathered togither. 321 His bookes of Husbandrie, are moch to be regarded, and diligentlie to be read, not onelie for the proprietie, but also for the plentie of good wordes, in all contrey and husbandmens affaires: which can not be had, by so good authoritie, out of any other Author, either of so good a tyme, or of so great learnyng, as out of Varro . And yet bicause, he was sourescore yeare old, whan he wrote those bookes, the forme of his style there compared with Tullies writyng, is but euen the talke of a spent old man: whose wordes commonlie fall out of his mouth, though verie wiselie, yet hardly and coldlie, and more heauelie also, than some eares can well beare, except onelie for age, and authorities sake. And perchance, in a rude contrey argument, of purpose and iudgement, he rather vsed, the speach of the contrey, than talke of the Citie. And so, for matter sake, his wordes sometyme, be somewhat rude: and by the imitation of the elder Cato, old and out of vse: And beyng depe stept in age, by negligence some wordes do so scape & fall from him in those bookes, as be not worth the taking vp, by him, that is carefull to speake or write trew Latin, as that sentence in him, Romani, in pace 322 a rusticis alebantur, et in bello ab his tuebantur . A good student must be therfore carefull and diligent, to read with iudgement ouer euen those Authors, which did write in the most perfite tyme: and let him not be affrayd to trie them, doth in proprietie of wordes, and forme of style, by the touch stone of C aesar and Cicero, whose puritie was neuer foiled, no not by the sentence of those, that loued them worst. All louers of learnyng may fore lament the losse of those 323 bookes of  Varro, which he wrote in his yong and lustie yeares, with good leysure, and great learnyng of all partes of Philosophie: of the goodliest argumentes, perteyning both to the common wealth, and priuate life of man, as, de Ratione studij, et educandis liberis , which booke, is oft recited, and moch praysed, in the fragmentes of Nonius , euen for authoritie sake. He wrote most diligentlie and largelie, also the whole historie of the state of Rome: the mysteries of their whole Religion: their lawes, customes, and gouernement in peace: their maners, and whole discipline in warre: And this is not my gessing, as one in deed that neuer saw those bookes, but euen, the verie iudgement, & playne testimonie of Tullie him selfe, who knew & read those bookes, in these wordes : Tu aetatem Patriae: Tu descriptiones temporum: Tu sacrorum, tu sacerdotum Iura: Tu domesticam, tu bellicam disciplinam: Tu sedem Regionum, locorum, tu omnium diuinarum 324 humanarumq reru nomina, genera, officia, causas aperuisti. &c . comming of Dionysius Halicarnass aeus to  Rome in Augustus dayes: who getting the possession of Varros librarie, out of that treasure house of learning, did leaue vnto vs some frute of Varros witte and diligence, I meane, his good lie bookes de Antiquitatibus Romanorum .  Varro was so estemed for his excellent learnyng, as Tullie him selfe had a reuerence to his iudgement in all doutes of learnyng. And 325 Antonius Triumuir , his enemie, and of a contrarie faction, who had power to kill and bannish whom he listed, whan  Varros name amongest others was brought in a schedule vnto him, to be noted to death, he tooke his penne and wrote his warrant of sauegard with these most goodlie wordes, Viuat Varro vir doctissimus . In later tyme, no man knew better, nor liked and loued more Varros learnyng, than did S. Augustine, as they do well vnderstand, that haue diligent lie read ouer his learned bookes de Ciuitate Dei : Where he hath this most notable sentece: Whan I s ee, how much  Varro wrote, I meruell much, that euer he had any leasure to read: and whan I perceiue how many thinges he read, I meruell more, that euer he had any leasure to write. &c. prouidence, the most part of Tullies did, than trewlie the Latin tong might haue made good comparison with the Greke. 326 Salust, is a wise and worthy writer: but he requireth a learned Reader, and a right considerer of him. My dearest frend, and best master that euer I had or heard in learning,  327 Syr  I. Cheke, soch a man, as if I should liue to s ee England breed the like againe, I feare, I should liue ouer long, did once geue me a lesson for Salust, which, as I shall neuer forget my selfe, so is it worthy to be remembred of all those, that would cum to persite iudgement of the Latin tong. He said, that Salust was not verie fitte for yong men, to learne out of him, the puritie of the Latin tong: because, he was not the purest in proprietie of wordes, nor choisest in aptnes of phrases, nor the best in framing of sentences: and therefore is his writing, sayd he neyther plaine for the matter, nor sensible for mens vnderstanding. And what is the cause thereof, Syr, quoth I. Verilie said he, bicause in Salust writing, is more Arte than nature, and more labor than Arte: and in his labor also, to moch toyle, as it were, with an vncontented care to write better than he could, a fault common to very many men. And therefore he both not expresse the matter liuely and naturally with common speach as ye s ee Xenophon doth in Gr eeke, but it is caried and driuen forth artificiallie, after to learned a sorte, as Thucydides artificiall and darke, whan all they thr ee liued in one tyme. I will freelie tell you my fansie herein, said he: surely, Caesar and Cicero, beside a singular prerogatiue of naturall eloquence geuen vnto them by God, both two, by vse of life, were daylie orators emonges the common people, and greatest councellers in the Senate house: and therefore gaue themselues to vse soch speach as the meanest should well vnderstand, and the wisest best allow: folowing carefullie that good councell of Aristotle, loquendum vt multi, saprendum vt pauci .  Salust was no soch man, neyther for will to goodnes, nor skill by learning: but ill geuen by nature, and made worse by bringing vp, spent the most part of his yougth very misorderly in ryot and lechery. In the company of soch, who, neuer geuing theyr mynde to honest doyng, could neuer inure their tong to wise speaking. But at last cummyng to better yeares, and bying witte at the dearest hand, that is, by long experience of the hurt and shame that cummeth of mischeif, moued, by the councell of them that were wise, and caried by the example of soch as were good, first fell to honestie of life, and after to the loue of studie and learning: and so became so new a man, that C aesar being dictator, made him Pretor in Numidia, where he absent from his contrie, and not inured with the common talke of Rome, but shut vp in his studie, and bent wholy to reading, did write the storie of the Romanes. And for the better accomplishing of the same, he red Cato and Piso in Latin for gathering of matter and troth: and Thucydides in Gr eeke for the order of his storie, and furnishing of his style. Cato (as his tyme required) had style: euen as a man that eateth garlike for helth, shall cary away with him the sauor of it also, whether 328 he will or not. And yet the vse of old wordes is not the greatest cause of Salustes roughnes and darknesse: There be in Salust some old wordes in d eed as patrare bellum, ductare exercitum , well noted by  Quintilian, and verie much misliked of him: and supplicium for supplicatio , a word smellyng of an older store, than the other two so misliked by  Quint : And yet is that word also in Varro, speaking of Oxen thus, boues ad victimas faciunt, atq ad Deorum supplicia : and a few old wordes mo. Read  Saluste difference: yea Salust is more geuen to new wordes, than to olde, though som olde writers say the contrarie: as, Claritudo for Gloria: exact e for perfect e: Facundia for eloquentia . Thies two last wordes exact e and facundia now in euery mans mouth, be neuer (as I do remember) vsed of Tullie, and therefore I thinke they be not good: For surely Tullie speaking euery where so moch of the matter of eloquence, would not so precisely haue absteyned from the worde Facundia , if it had bene good: that is proper for the tong,  & common for mens vse. I could be long, in reciting many soch like, both olde & new wordes in  Salust : but in very dede neyther oldnes nor newnesse of 329 wordes maketh the greatest difference betwirt  Salust and Tullie, but first strange phrases made of good Latin wordes, but framed after the Gr eeke tonge, which be neyther choisly borowed of them, nor properly vsed by him: than, a hard composition and crooked framing of his wordes and sentences, as a man would say, English talke placed and framed outlandish like. As for example first in phrases, nimius et animus , be two vsed wordes, yet homo nimius animi , is an vnused phrase. Vulgus, et amat, et fieri , be as common and well known wordes as may be in the Latin tong, yet id quod vulg o amat fieri , for solet fieri , is but a strange and grekish kinde of writing. Ingens et vires be proper wordes, yet vir ingens virium is an vnproper kinde of speaking and so be likewise, ae ger consilij. --- promptissimus belli. territus animi. of Gr eeke, and vsed therefore vnproperlie in Latin. Againe, in whole sentences, where the matter is good, the wordes proper and plaine, yet the sense is hard and darke, and namely in his prefaces and oration, wherein he vsed most labor, which fault is likewise in Thucydides in Gr eeke, of whom Salust hath taken the greatest part of his darkenesse. For Thucydides likewise wrote his storie, not at home in Grece, but abrode in Italie, and therefore smelleth of a certaine outlandish kinde of talke, strange to them of Athens, and diuerse from their writing, that liued in Athens and Grece, and wrote the same tyme that Thucydides did, as Lysias, Xenophon, Plato, and Isocrates , the purest and playnest writers, that euer wrote in any tong, and best examples for any man to follow whether he write, Latin, Italian, French, or English. Thucydides also semeth in his writing, not so much benefited by nature, as holpen by Arte, and caried forth by desire, studie, labor, toyle, and ouer great curiositie: who spent xxvii. yeares in writing his eight bookes of his history. Salust boroweth of him som kinde of writing, which the Latin tong can not well beare, as Casus nominatiuus in diuerse places absolut e positus , as in that place of Iugurth , speaking de leptitanis, itaq ab imperatore facil e quae petebant adepti, misssae sunt eo cohortes ligurum quatuor . This thing in participles, vsed so oft in  Thucyd . and other Gr eeke authors to, may better be borne with all, but Salust vseth the same more strangelie and boldlie, as in thies wordes, Multis sibi quisq imperium petentibus . I beleue, the best Grammarien in England can scarse giue a good reule, why quisq the nominatiue case, without any verbe, is so thrust vp amongest so many oblique cases. Some man perchance will smile, and laugh to scorne this my writyng, and call it idle curiositie, thus to buste my selfe in pickling about these small pointes of Grammer, not fitte for my age, place and calling, to trifle in: I trust that man, be he neuer so great in authoritie, neuer so wise and learned, either, by other mens iudgement, or his owne opinion, will yet thinke, that he is not greater in England, than Tullie was at Rome, nor yet wiser, nor better learned than Tullie was him selfe, who, at the pitch of thr ee score yeares, in the middes of the broyle betwixt Caesar and Pompeie, whan he knew not, whether to send wife & children, which way to go, where to hide him selfe, yet, in 331 an earnest letter, amongest his earnest councelles for those heuie tymes concerning both the common state of his contrey, and his owne priuate great affaires he was neither vnmyndfull nor ashamed to reason at large, and learne gladlie of Atticus, a lesse point of Grammer than these be, noted of me in Salust, as, whether he should write, ad Pir aeea, in Piraeea, , or in Pir aeeum , or Pir aeeum sine praepositione : And in those heuie tymes, he was so carefull to know this small point of Grammer, that he addeth these wordes Si hoc mihi [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  persolueris, magna me molestia liberaris . If  Tullie, at that age, in that authoritie, in that care for his contrey, in that ieoperdie for him selfe, and extreme necessitie of hys dearest frendes, beyng also the Prince of Eloquence hym selfe, was not ashamed to descend to these low pointes of Grammer, in his owne naturall tong, what should scholers do, yea what should any man do, if he do thinke well doyng, better than ill doyng: And had rather be, perfite than meane, sure than doutefull, to be what he should be, in d eed, not seeme what he is not, in opinion. He that maketh perfitnes in the Latin tong his marke, must cume to it by choice & certaine knowledge, not stumble vpon it by chance and doubtfull ignorance: And the right steppes to reach vnto it, be these, linked thus orderlie together, aptnes of nature, loue of learnyng, diligence in right order, constancie with pleasant moderation, and alwayes to learne of them that be best, and so shall you iudge as they that be wisest. And these be those reules, which worthie Master Cheke dyd impart vnto me concernyng Salust, and the right iudgement of the Latin tong. Caesar for that litle of him, that is left onto vs, is like the halfe face of a Venus, the other part of the head beyng hidden, the bodie and the rest of the members vnbegon, yet so excellentlie done by Apelles, as all men may stand still to mase and muse vpon it, and no man step forth with any hope to performe the like. His seuen bookes de bello Gallico , and thr ee; de bello Ciuili , be written, so wiselie for the matter, so eloquentlie for the tong, that neither his greatest enemies could euer finde the least note of parcialitie in him (a meruelous wisdome of a man, namely writyng of his owne doynges, nor yet the best ludegers of the  Latin tong, nor the most enuious lookers vpon other mes writynges, can say any other, but all things be most perfitelie done by him. Brutus, Caluus, and Calidius, who found fault with Tullies fulnes in woordes and matter, and that rightlie, for Tullie did both, confesse it, and mend it, yet in C aesar, they neither did, nor could finde the like, or any other fault. other, the best that euer wrote, in any tyme, or in any tong, in Greke fault is iustlie noted, in C aesar onelie, could neuer yet fault be found. Yet neuertheles, for all this perfite excellencie in him, yet it is but in one member of eloquence, and that but of one side neither, whan we must looke for that example to folow, which hath a perfite head, a whole bodie, forward and backward, armes and legges and all. FINIS.
