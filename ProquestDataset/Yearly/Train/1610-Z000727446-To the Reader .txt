 the Pope, the peste of all Religion, and by the other, against Bellarmine the abuser of all good Learning) is yet so far enamour'd with this celestiall Muse, that it shall neuer repent mee--- calamo triuisse labellum , whensoeuer I shall remember Hac cadem vt scires quid nox faciebat Amyntas ? To name no more in such plenty, whear I may finde how to beginne, sooner then to end, Saincte Paule, by the Exaple of Christ, that wente singing to mounte Oliuet, with his Disciples, after his last supper, exciteth the Christians to solace themselues with hymnes, and Psalmes, and spirituall songs; and thearefore, by their leav's, be it an error for Poets to be Divines, I had rather err with the Scripture, then be rectifi'd by them: I had rather adore the stepps of Nazianzen, Prudentius, Sedulius , then followe their steps, to bee misguided: I had rather be the deuoute Admirer of Nonnius, Bartas , my sacred Soueraign, and others, the miracles of our latter age, then the false sectarie of these, that haue nothing at all to follow, but their own naked opinions: To conclude, I had rather with my Lord, and his most divine Apostle sing (though I sing sorilie) the loue of heauen and earthe, then praise God (as they doe) with the woorthie guift of silence, and sitting still, or think I dispraisd him with this poetical discourse. It seems they haue either not read, or clean forgot, that it is the dutie of the Muses (if wee maye beeleeue Pindare , and Hesiod ) to set allwaies vnder the throne of Iupiter, pius & laudes, & beneficia ![](/images/inline/rbugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/uacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which made a very worthy German writer conclude it Cert o statuimus, proprium atq peculiare poetarum munus esse, Christi gloriam illustrare , beeing good reason that the heavenly infusion of such Poetry, should finde in his glorie, that had beginning from his goodnes, fit orator, nascitur Poeta. For the secound sorte thearfore, that eliminat Poets out of their citie gates; as though they wear nowe grown so bad, as they could neither growe woorse, nor better, though it be somewhat hard for those to bee the onely men should want cities, that wear the onely causers of the building of them, and somewhat inhumane to thrust them into the woods, to liue among the beasts, who wear the first that call'd men out of the woods, from their beastly, and wilde life, yet since they will needes shoulder them out for the onely firebrands to inflame lust (the fault of earthly men, not heauenly Poetrie) I would gladly learne, what kind of professions theas men would bee intreated to entertaine, that so deride and disaffect Poesie: would they admit of Philosophers, that after they haue burnt out the whole candle of their life in the circular studie of Sciences, crie out at length, Se nihil prorsus serre ? or should Musitians be welcome to them, that Dant sine mente sonum -bring delight with them indeede, could they aswell expresse with their instruments a voice, as they can a sound? or would they most approve of Soldiers that defend the life of their countrymen either by the death of themselues, or their enemies? If Philosophers please them, who is it, that knowes not, that all the lights of Example, to cleare their precepts, are borowed by Philosophers from Poets; that without Homers examples, Aristotle would be as blind as Homer : If they retaine Musitians, who euer doubted, but that Poets infused the verie soule into the inarticulate sounds of musique; that without Pindar, & Horace the Lyriques had beene silenced for euer: If they must needes entertaine Soldiers, who can but confesse, that Poets restore againe that life to soldiers, which they before lost for the safetie of their country; that without Virgil, Ã†neas had neuer beene so much as heard of. How then can they for shame deny commonwealths to them, who wear the first Authors of them; how can they denie the blinde Philosopher, that teaches them, his light; the emptie Musitian that delights them, his soule; the dying Soldier, that defends their life, immortalitie, after his owne death; let Philosophie, let Ethiques , let all the Arts bestowe vpon vs this guift, that we be not thought dead men, whilest we remaine among the liuing: it is
