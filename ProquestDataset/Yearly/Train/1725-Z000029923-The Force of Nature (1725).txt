 to all Offers of that kind.  \---Her Father was no oftner sollicited to give his Consent, than she was on her Knees to conjure him to refuse it. \---So strange, and so general a Disdain for all Mankind was surprizing to every body; but her firm Perseverance in it, joyn'd to a Reserve and love of Solitude, no less uncommon in a Lady of her Youth and Beauty, and who the Indulgence of the most fond of Fathers, might have enjoy'd almost what Diversions she pleas'd, at length seem'd to predict a Vein to a Monastick Life; and it was the Opinion of all who were acquainted with her, that in a little time they shou'd hear she ask'd Permission to retire into a Cloyster. troubled to find that of the many Proposals made to her, there was none which cou'd work the least Change in her Humour; and was often not a little perplex'd what it shou'd be, that render'd her so different from her Sex: But not all his Philosophy cou'd enable him to guess at the Truth, till an accident happened to discover it, and shew'd him that his Daughter was not of a Constitution so frozen as he imagin'd, nor her Insensibility so universal as she pretended. Charge of, and educated with the same Care, as he would have done a Son of his own, and indeed he had a Genius and Capacity so very capable of Improvement, that not to have given him all the advantages of Learning, wou'd have been an affront to that Power, who endu'd him with the most excellent Qualifications of Nature.  The discerning Eyes of Felisinda, for so the Daughter of the Grandees who made their Addresses to her cou'd boast of, nor was he insensible of her power of Charming.  They began to love each other, while they were both too innocent to know what it was their Wishes aim'd at; but as their Years encreas'd, what at first was no more than Friendship, or that tender Regard which Relations might feel for one another, grew up into a Passion; ungovernable Desires, tumultuous Emotions, and all the Symptoms of burning raging Love, with mutual Ardor swell'd in their throbbing Hearts--- they now were sensible what 'twas they felt, they knew they lov'd,---but knew also that they were unhappy---the same Moment which instructed them in the one, convinc'd them of the other. Fernando, who had no dependance but on the favour of Alvario, and liv'd but on his Charity, had little cause to hope he wou'd bestow his Daughter, and the vast Possessions which were to descend with her, on a Beggar. Nor had Felisinda greater Cause of Consolation; she thought as deeply on these things, as did Fernando, and cou'd not flatter herself with the most distant hope of ever being happy, at least while her Father liv'd. Both were perfectly acquainted with the Sentiments of each other, before either had Courage to confess them; but as that Passion will not always be subject to Restraint, it burst out at last with greater Violence, for having been so long suppress'd, and in spite of their Resolutions to the contrary, their Tongues declar'd what their Intelligible Eyes had betray'd before: they found some Ease however, in communicating and condoling their common Misfortune, in giving each other all the soft assurance, that Modesty would permit, of the most tender and inviolable Affection, and exchanging Vows, that whatever happen'd, never to be but one another's.  \---More than a Year past over in this manner, during which time their secret Conversation was never in the least suspected to be any more than that friendly Regard which they being brought up together might create, and pleas'd his Daughter did not repine at the Favour he show'd to one, who pretended to no claim by Blood, often saying, he would have her love him as a Brother, and commanding him to look on her rather as a Sister than the Daughter of his Benefactor.  These words were so great an Encouragement to our equally enamour'd Pair, that sometimes they were on the point of confessing the Truth; but the Uncertainty in what manner to relate it, still prevented 'em. Fernando being arriv'd at the Age of Twenty, Alvario being pretty old and infirm, put into his hands the Management of his whole Affairs; depending on his Integrity and Capacity, in as ample a Trust as he cou'd have repos'd in a Son, the most worthy of being belov'd; and Fernando discharg'd himself in all things in the same manner as he wou'd have done by the most indulgent Father, whose Estate was to descend to him. \---Some Disturbance happening among the Tenants, he was oblig'd to go into the Country, which was the first Absence he ever had from his Dear Felisinda; they mitigated the Pangs of parting, by contriving a way to write to one another unsuspected. He had not been gone many days, before Don Carlos, a Noble Youth, who had a long time made his Addresses to Felisinda, and was very much esteemed by her Father, press'd the matter so home, that Alvario was at a loss how to answer him.  He passionately desir'd to have him for a Son-in-law; but being unwilling to force his Daughter's Inclinations, he had hitherto deferr'd giving him any Answer; still hoping she wou'd grow less averse, as she became more acquainted with the Merits of this accomplish'd Cavalier. He sent for her one Day into his Closet, to discourse her on the Affair, but was not a little troubled to find, that instead of complying with the Arguments he made use of to persuade her, she burst into a Flood of Tears, assuring him, that it was impossible for her to love that Gentleman, and conjuring him, not to make her for ever miserable, by an enforc'd Assent---She seem'd so overcome with Grief at the Apprehensions of what his Power might do, that he was oblig'd to dismiss her from his Presence; and the sooner, because he observ'd that in taking out her Handkerchief to dry her Eyes, she had let fall a Paper; which his Curiosity prompted him to read unseen by her. He saw it was folded in the manner of a Letter, and imagin'd that perhaps it might give him some light into the Reasons which had inspir'd her with so strange a Resolution: He was not mistaken in his Conjecture, but was more surpriz'd than can be well express'd, when taking it up, he found it writ by Fernando, and contain'd these Lines. Tho' I knew before, that my Passion for you exceeded all that ever fill'd a Heart, yet I never knew the Extremity of it till now;---I have been but six Days absent from you, and they seem so many Ages: how then shall I be able to support that tedious length of Time which I foresee Alvario's Business will detain me here?  Were I employ'd by any other Person, I am very confident, I shou'd this Moment, born on the Wings of Love, dispising all other Considerations, fly to the Feet of my ador'd Charmer, and tell her how I have languish'd, how I have dy'd to see her;---But as in his, 'tis your Affairs must suffer by my abrupt Departure, I must study Patience to endure it.  I have, indeed, this Consolation in my Sufferings, that they are of service to her I love--- But if while I linger here in the severest Agonies of Distrust and Jealousy a Soul can know, some powerful Rival, arm'd with Pomp and Grandeur, should supplant me in your Esteem, or if, which most I fear, a Father's absolute Commands should force you from your Vows, what name of Misery wou'd serve to represent the Horror of my State. \---Despair and Madness are but mean Descriptions---the Damn'd, who prove what 'tis to feel the exchange of Heaven for Hell, can only speak it---Oh! my Felisinda! pity me, comfort me, for methinks 'tis something more than the ordinary suspicion of a Lover, which tells me that this absence will be fatal to our Loves---I am so well acquainted with your divine Goodness, that I dare promise my self to hear from you by the first Opportunity. I will endeavour to console myself till then as well as I am able---Farewell, think of me as I deserve, and know me for Your Everlasting Slave, Fernando. Astonishment, is short of what Alvario felt at reading this Letter. \---He call'd immediately for Felisinda, who not yet sensible of the loss she had sustain'd, came into the Room with more Courage than else she wou'd have done; but startling at the Change she perceiv'd in Alvario's Countenance, and at the same time seeing the Letter in his Hand, the Surprize and Terror seiz'd her unprepar'd Soul with too much Violence, and giving a great Shriek, she fell at his Feet in a Swoon ---The Noise she made, brought some of the Servants to her Relief, before her Father could have time to call them: Proper Remedies being apply'd, she was not long Sensless, but wish'd she had remain'd so still, when she found herself treated by Alvario in a manner she had never been before, and which her gentle Nature was little able to support with Life---She answer'd his Upbraiding only with her Tears; and when he call'd her Hypocrite, Betrayer of the Confidence he had repos'd in her, Disobedient, Shameless, and every Name of ill his Indignation could invent; she attempted not a Syllable to excuse or to deny what she was accus'd of; but when he commanded her to speak, and reveal every Thing to him of this Affair, as how long since it began, how far it had proceeded, and utter'd some Words, which made her think he believ'd they had carry'd their Passion to lengths criminal; she made her Defence with Resolution enough, assuring him with a great deal of Truth, that nothing had past between 'em (Wishes excepted) that might not, with all the Innocence in the World, be allow'd to those not nearly related.  This seem'd to pacify him a little, and having order'd she should be confin'd to her Chamber, and strictly watch'd, that she got no Opportunity of writing, or sending to Confusion she had been in seem'd to promise; she consoled herself with the hope, that the first Gust of her Father's Passion being over, his former Indulgence wou'd return, and influence him to compleat her Wishes:  She was also pleas'd, that since their Loves were ordain'd to be discover'd, it hapned at a time when Fernando was absent, that so the whole Storm of Indignation might fall on her alone;---the greatest Vexation she had, was, that she was without the Means of letting Fernando know what had fell out---she resolv'd, however, to wait the Event with Patience, and was studying what she should say to Alvario, to move him to forgiveness of her Fault, when he enter'd the Room, and with a Countenance, tho' less distorted with Rage than before, yet full of an Austerity, which she trembled at: Felisinda, said he, I doubt not but your own good Sense, joyn'd to those Improvements of Education I have given you, have made you sensible enough of what you owe me, to be not only truly penitent for having offended me, but desirous also of having it in your Power to repair the Injury you have done my Peace, by your foolish passion for a Man, who tho' I very much esteem, you might believe for many Reasons, I shou'd not approve of for a Husband for you.  The Almighty Power which form'd me, reply'd she, knows how dear I prize your Peace, and how sincere a Gratitude I feel for those, even more than paternal Obligations you have heap'd upon me;--- but you know, Sir, that our Passions are not the effect of Will, but Fate; and if I encourag'd that growing One I long have known for this too lovely Youth, it was not without a Hope, you would one Day approve my Choice---the many Favours you have conferr'd on him---the Indulgence you have ever show'd him, always using him as you wou'd have done a Son, flatter'd my fond Wishes with an Imagination, that you might in time be won to make him so, especially when you shou'd know your Daughter's Life, nay, what is more, her everlasting Peace, depends upon your Grant.  Don Alvario listned to what she said with tolerable Patience, till the latter part of her Discourse; but then, unable to contain himself, you ought, cry'd he, fiercely, to have been assur'd how far I was inclin'd to favour him, before you proceeded to such Lengths---which since you have done, your Crime be your Punishment---I shall take effectual Measures to prevent your ever meeting more---In the mean time prepare yourself to marry your Power to delay the Consummation of that which I have long design'd---To Morrow is the Day, therefore, tempt not my Anger by a fond Perverseness, but resolve to be Obedient---Oh, Sir! interrupted she, falling on her Knees, if ever you thought me worth your Care, I beseech you--- I conjure you, to revoke so harsh a Decree--- Is it not enough to tear me from all I ever did or ever can love, but you must also doom me to one I hate---Condemn me to a Nunnery--- cut me off at once from all my Expectations of Fortune, and of Favour, do any Thing rather than force me to violate those Vows high Heaven, and the conscious Saints have oft been witness of to my Fernando. The Power, resum'd he, more enrag'd, which shou'd have authoriz'd those Vows was mine, not your's; you had no right to make them, and therefore are not binding. Yet, Sir! cry'd she, consider---I'll hear no more, said he, remember who I am, and know your Duty--- with these words he flung out of the Room, and left her in a Condition which no Expression can represent: To lose Fernando, terrible as it was, seem'd less distracting than to marry Carlos; yet she found herself oblig'd to it by a Power, whence there was no Appeal---she wou'd have fled, and dar'd all the Extremities of Want and Misery, but she was too close watch'd---no Remedy appear'd but Death, and to that she wou'd certainly have had recourse, had the Passion which Don Carlos had for her, been of the same self-interested kind which influences the Minds of ordinary Lovers.  That generous Man being told by Alvario, that the next Day shou'd give his admir'd Felisinda to his Arms, made no doubt but that her consent concurr'd to make him happy, and desir'd to pay those Acknowledgments which her suppos'd Condescensions seem'd to demand from him; the Servants, who were acquainted with their Master's Intentions, made no scruple to admit him; but instead of those modest Blushes, and tender Fears, which are generally the Ornaments of a Virgin Bride, he found her on the Floor, her Hair dishevell'd, the usual Lustre of her shining Eyes extinct in Tears, and all the Symptoms of Dispair about her. Surpriz'd at an Object so unexpected, so alarming, he drew near, and endeavouring to raise her from the Posture she was in, entreated her to let him know the Causes of her Grief? And canst thou ask, said she, thou, who art thy self the only hated Cause?--- but I'll be reveng'd (continued she, beginning to tear her Hair and Flesh) I'll be reveng'd, first on these Originals of my Woe---I'll pluck these Eyes out, mangle every Feature that attracted thy undoing Passion---I'll be no more the Object of Desire, but Loathing; and if I must be thine, I'll come to thy Embraces a hideous Bride---'Tis hard to say, whether such a Behaviour inspir'd more Grief or Astonishment in the Mind of him who was a Witness of it; all that can be conceiv'd of soft, of tender, of obliging, he said to her to mitigate her Anger and asswage her Sorrows; assuring her with a great deal of Sincerity, that had he known himself so unhappy to have been hated by her, he wou'd have chose to die in Silence, rather than have occasion'd her one Moment's Inquietude.  She rais'd her Head a little at these words, and the Violence of her Rage somewhat abated by 'em, she began to consider that he deserv'd not to be treated in that manner by her: Pardon Don Carlos, said she, the wildness of my Despair; I must confess I have nothing to accuse you of, but too much love for an unworthy Wretch, who has it not in her power to reward it ---Your Passion is indeed the Source of my Misfortune, but then I should remember that Passions are involuntary, and perhaps 'tis as impossible for you to shake off your's, as it would for me to forget mine.  A deathlike Paleness seem'd to spread itself all o'er the Face of Carlos while she was speaking, and perceiving she had done; Is it then, Madam! cry'd he, in a faultring Accent, to your Kindness for some happier Man the wretched Neglect: pity me then and think what I endure, torn from all I love by a remorseless Parent, and given to one who, in spite of his Accomplishments, I hate--- Forgive the harsh Expression, for believe, of all Mankind, I cou'd esteem you as a Friend---but, alas! my Heart wants room to entertain you as a tender Guest; long e're I knew your Merits it was taken up, all the Affections of my Soul are riveted to another---to him I am bound by all the ties of Honour, Gratitude, and everlasting Love, and him or Death I only can consent to wed. Am I then, said he, with a melancholy Air, the only Bar to wondrous Merits, make Alvario impatient to call himself your Father---my Tears, and my Despair, wou'd easily overcome all other Obstacles; he wou'd not make me Wretched, but with design to make me Blest, which, ignorant of the force of Fancy, he thinks consists in being your's.  Well, Madam! resum'd struggled to suppress) I were unworthy of declaring myself your Lover, if I refus'd to fall a Martyr to my Passion; before Evening you shall confess that I deserve your Friendship: He left the Room as he spoke these Words, but with a Countenance so sad, and so dejected, that it mov'd her Pity, as much as what he said had done her Wonder--- She was extreamly at a loss for a Construction of his last Expression; but being far from guessing at the Resolution he had taken, imagined he had spoke in that manner only to amuse her, and that the next Day she shou'd be dragg'd to the Altar, and forc'd to assist in that Ceremony which must for ever deprive her of the hope of being her dear Fernando's. The Agonies of her Dispair return'd with the former Violence at this Suggestion, and she was meditating by what desperate Course she should avoid what she so much dreaded, when one of her Women gave her a little Billet, which being brought by a Servant of Don Carlos's, and accompany'd by another to their Master, they thought it no breach of Trust to deliver her. The Contents of it were these. Felisinda. Since cruel Fate deprives me of the Power of being conducive to your Happiness, I readily yield my Life a Sacrifice, to be of Service to your Peace.  I wish I could do more to establish your lasting Felicity with that too fortunate Engrosser of Felisinda's Wishes: I go for ever from you; and since their is nothing so impossible as for me to live without you, I go to seek in some far distant Clime that Death, which if inflicted here, might give you some disquiet, by a too late Remorse, and unavailing Pity for the Unhappy Carlos. Admiration, which fill'd the Soul of Felisinda, at so uncommon a proof of disinterested Affection, as it wou'd the Vexation of Alvario, when by the same Messenger he receiv'd a Letter from Don Carlos, containing these Lines. Tho' the Possession of your lovely Daughter has long been the first wish of my desiring Soul, yet I chuse to relinquish my Hope of that Felicity, since I am too late convinc'd it was rais'd only by your Goodness: 'Tis to her Love alone I wou'd be indebted for the Blessing of calling her mine; and as her Heart is dispos'd of to some happier Man, beg I may transfer to him that Right you gave me; I cannot doubt but that he has Merit to deserve your Favour. Felisinda finds so much in him;---and that my Presence may be no Obstacle to her Desires, I go this moment from Valladolid, and shall in a short time quit Spain, 'tis probable for ever---I make it my last request, that you will compleat the Happiness of her who, by a prior Obligation, had it not in her power to obey your Commands in conferring any on Her Eternal Adorer, and Your Obliged Servant, Carlos. inform himself of Don Carlos, and hearing that he was really gone, and had order'd his Equipage to follow him next day, was so outragious, that he swore never to forgive his Daughter the Disquiet she had occasion'd him; being by this Letter perfectly assur'd, that she had confest her Passion for had been the last to whom she wou'd have reveal'd it. \---He flew to her Chamber, reproach'd her in the severest manner his Indignation cou'd invent, and stung her to the quick with ten thousand Imprecations, that all she had persuaded Carlos to, was ineffectual, for he wou'd sooner marry her to one of his Grooms than to Fernando. The violent and unaccustomed Fury he had been in, was hurtful only to himself; he was seiz'd immediately with a Disorder, which oblig'd him to take his Bed, and in a very few Hours discover'd itself to be mortal---He sent for a Lady, who every body knew he had a great Esteem for, her Name was Berinthia, she was Abbess of a Monastery of Augustines, and, in her Presence, gave directions to a Person proper to be apply'd to in such Cases, for his Will, and order'd the disposal of his Estate; which being finish'd, he liv'd long enough to sign it, and then, as he had no farther Business with Life, gave up the Ghost, without permitting Felisinda to come into his presence. She was immediately inform'd of it, and the grief of losing a Parent, who had in every thing but her Love for Fernando, been the most indulgent one that ever was, joyn'd to the shock of not being admitted to take a parting Blessing, threw her into Agonies, which for some time made her want but little of being reduced to the Condition he was in. being over, sent a dispatch for Fernando, who was yet ignorant of all that had happened. The Reader will easily guess, that when the Tidings was brought him, he was not altogether inconsolable for the Death of Alvario; who, tho' regarded by him with all imaginable Veneration and Gratitude, as his Patron and Friend, cou'd not be put in Balance with the Love he had for a Mistress---He believ'd himself now secure of Felisinda, and was too full of that extatick View, to allow room for Grief. 'Tis also to be suppos'd that this Consideration was no small Alleviator of that fair Mourner's Sorrows--- she cou'd not hear he was returning, and reflect that there was now no Obstacle to impede the Gratification of their mutual Wishes, without feeling a Pleasure, which overcame her Melancholy, and very much conduc'd to restore her to her former Health. When they met, tho' it was in the Presence of but that Lady not permitting them to take more than one Embrace; Hold, cry'd she, mistaken Pair! you are not yet so secure of each other, as you may imagine; the Death of Alvario has not left you without a Bar between you, which I believe you will find it difficult to get over---But, continued she, I will not keep you in suspence, I know I seem to speak in Riddles, therefore will not delay the unfolding of your Fate.  She waited not for a Reply, nor did the Amazement they were in at her Words, permit them to make any; but calling immediately for the Person who was in Possession of Alvario's Will, order'd him to read it out aloud; the Contents of which, after the customary Prelude in such Writings was, that he bequeathed his whole Estate to be equally divided between Fernando and Felisinda, on Condition that they married not each other; for the prevention of which, he order'd that Felisinda shou'd be carried into the Monastery of Augustines, under the Guardianship and Care of the Lady Abbess of that Place, and there to remain till either Don Carlos shou'd return, or she shou'd make Choice of any other Person, whom Berinthia shou'd approve for her Husband: All this was set down in the most binding Form of Law, with the Penalty annex'd, of an Eternal Curse on them, if they broke thro' this Command.  A Clap of Thunder tearing all before it, and threatning Nature with universal Ruin, cou'd not be more dreadful to the Lovers, than this unlook'd-for Blow; they had scarce time to testifie what it was each thought on this mutual and dreadful Disappointment, before Berinthia, punctual in discharging the Trust repos'd in her, told them they must part for ever; and finding neither of them seem'd to regard her Persuasions, was oblig'd to exert that Authority, which Alvario had transferr'd to her, and, by the Assistance of her Servants, forc'd 'em from each other's Arms. Never was there a more moving Scene; Felisinda was carry'd into the Coach more dead than alive, and her despairing Lover left in an Agony of Grief, which came pretty near Distraction---Had these Orders been put into the Hands of any other Person than whose they were, he had certainly done some desperate Action, to have made 'em repent accepting the Commission; but Berinthia was a Lady for whose exemplary Piety, Wisdom, and Goodness, he had been taught to have the highest Veneration, and from whose Bounty he had formerly receiv'd great Favours, and beside, there was something in her, which he cou'd not account for, that more than all I have nam'd, commanded his Respect, and rendered it impossible for him to treat her as he wou'd have done any other in the like Circumstance---she staid some Moments, endeavouring to console him; but finding the storm of present Grief too violent, to admit of Arguments, left him to go to Felisinda, who recover'd not from her Swoon till she was brought into the Monastery. Abbess, who indulg'd her with all Tenderness imaginable, in every Wish but Liberty, and the Sight of her dear Fernando; but that, alas! was the All of her Desires; nor cou'd all the Arguments she made use of to convince her, how much better it was not to see him, since Fate had decreed them different Fates, than by continuing a Conversation, keep alive a hopeless Flame, which wou'd in time consume its Owners, have any effect at all on her; she still persisted in her Entreaties, for leave to entertain him at the Grate; and being still deny'd, had like to have fallen into a languishing Melancholly--- There was in the Cloyster a young Devotee, whom Constraint more than Inclination had oblig'd to enter; her Year of Probation being almost expir'd, she had a greater Liberty than those who were but lately come in: This young Lady, whose Name was Alantha, took a very great kindness for pityed her Sufferings: One day as they were sitting together in Alantha's Cell, she entreated her to give her the History of her Misfortunes, and the Reasons for which she was debarr'd the Priviledge of the Grate, which every body beside herself enjoy'd; which when the other had oblig'd her in relating, she told her, if she could be of any service to her, she might depend on her readiness to do it.  Felisinda look'd on her as an Angel sent to relieve her, and made her ten thousand Retributions, and immediately assur'd her, that she cou'd be of the greatest importance, if she wou'd take upon her to deliver a Letter to Fernando, who she did not doubt wou'd be every day at the Grate, expecting to get a sight of her.  Alantha told her, she wou'd not only do that, but convey his Answers also by the same means. This being concluded on, the Soul-afflicted Felisinda, went to prepare her Letter; which she filled with a million of soft Complainings of their mutual Misfortune, conjuring him to everlasting Love, and renewing all the Vows she had before made never to be but his---Assoon as she had finish'd, she return'd with it in her Hand to Alantha, who taking it from her, repair'd that Instant, where, as they imagin'd the despairing Fernando stood, vainly expecting when he should see the Charmer of his Soul appear, and not able to comprehend the meaning that among so many as he saw daily crowd to it, she shou'd never come in hope of seeing him, the description Felisanda had given of him, made him immediately known to Alantha; but resolving to be certain, watched her Opportunity of the rest of the Nuns being withdrawn, to beckon him to come as near as he cou'd; which he obeying, she ask'd him if his Name were not Fernando? and he having answer'd her it was, she put the Letter into his hand: The sight of the Superscription, immediately inform'd him of the dear Writer; he snatch'd it from her with an Eagerness becoming his Passion, and putting it to his Mouth, seem'd to rivet his Lips to it---Suspend your Raptures, cry'd Alantha in a low Voice, till you are in a place more convenient to indulge them; here they may be dangerous to the continuance of your Correspondence---Come to morrow about this time, and bring your Answer. she had done him merited, but she turn'd away as she had done speaking, and waving her hand to him to be gone, put him in mind, the greatest proof of Complaisance wou'd be Obedience;---and indeed she had good Cause for what she did, for he saw immediately after, the Lady Abbess herself coming toward the Grate---Tho' he passionately long'd to peruse the Contents of what he had just receiv'd, yet the regard he had for her, imagining he had been seen by her, prevented him from going till he had first spoken to her.  She receiv'd him with that Affability and Tenderness, with which he had been accustom'd to be treated by her; but not all his Entreaties cou'd win her to give him a moment's sight of from guessing any thing of the secret Correspondence he was in hopes to have by the Friendship of Alantha. But she made use of the same Reasons she had done to Felisinda, persuading him not to resist the Decrees of Destiny, but make himself as easy as possible in a Misfortune which it was impossible to retrieve. He listned to her with that respect which was her due; but what effect her Arguments had on him, let those who have experienc'd the Force of Love be judge: Having at last disengaged himself, he went home, to feast Reflection, and revive decaying Hope, with the assurance that he was still as dear as ever where he alone wish'd to continue so. His Answer to her's was much to the same purpose of what she had writ, all Love, and tender Protestations; but because there was nothing in either of them very material to the Story, I will not insert. that Happiness they so long languish'd for, at last they hit on a Medium, which seem'd to promise them Success: Alvario's Estate was so vastly great, that being divided between them, either part was sufficient to enable the Possessor to live not only in a handsome but a grand manner; it was therefore agreed that Fernando should turn his Moiety into ready Money, and ship it off; for that when every thing was ready, by some Stratagem, which they trusted to Invention to contrive, she shou'd make her Escape from the Monastery, and go with him to settle there, leaving her own part the Forfeiture of the Penalty by each; and Fernando giving out that he could not bear to live in Valladolid, after the knowledge that Felisinda was not allotted for him, he dispos'd of every thing without any suspicion of the true Cause for which he did it. Berinthia, tho' she appear'd very much concern'd that he was going, did not offer to dissuade him, believing it wou'd be the only effectual means to cure him of his hopeless Passion. was so diligently observ'd both Night and Day, scarce a moment without some or other of the Nuns with her, that her Escape seem'd an utter Impossibility. After a great number of fruitless Projections, at last it was resolv'd that judging, with Reason, that if he were gone, she wou'd be left much more at Liberty, and that he should commission some Trusty Friend to convey her to Brussels, where he having also been some time before, shou'd prepare every thing for her Reception. It was very difficult for Fernando to consent to the leaving her behind him; but there appearing no other means to free her, he was oblig'd to yield to the cruel Necessity.  He took his leave in form of see Felisinda before his departure, that that Lady had not the least suspicion of his Designs.  The Person he entrusted to assist Felisinda in her Escape, and conduct her to him, was one, of whose Integrity he had many Proofs, and he embark'd with more Courage than himself believ'd he should have had, so much did he depend on the Friendship of this Confidante, and the good Nature of Alanthe: But now it was time for Fortune, who had long befriended him, to turn her Wheel, and change the pleasing prospect of approaching Joys, for Misery, Perplexity and Despair. Correspondence between these unhappy Lovers, were now turn'd into a quite contrary Passion; she found too many Charms in Fernando, not to envy feeling a considerable addition of her Passion, and not knowing how, without a discovery of the Cause, to break off the Commerce she so generously had begun to assist, was almost distracted to think she was oblig'd to be aiding to her Rival's Happiness. Every thing being now in so fair a way for the compleating their mutual Felicity, and the Man gone, the sight of whom sometimes was all she had to enable her to go through so difficult a Task, her Vexation, her Despair, grew beyond all bounds.  \---She past her Days in Agitations not to be exprest, and her Nights in Agonies, which were near depriving her of her Senses---The remembrance of every tender Expression Fernando had utter'd at the Grate in favour of Felisinda, the transport which appear'd in his Eyes whenever he receiv'd a Letter, was like a Vulture preying incessantly on her vital Spirits;---but when she reflected that they wou'd in short time meet with all the Raptures of endearing Love, to part no more, she was utterly bereft of Reason---She was sometimes on the point of betraying all their Measures to the Abbess; but then the Reflection how guilty she must appear in having concerted them, prevented her.  In this truly pitiable Condition did she remain some time; at last, the Friend of was told by him, that hearing Felisinda had now the liberty of walking in the Garden, he had found a way for her Delivery, and withal, slipt through the Grate a little Bundle and a Letter, saying, that contain'd Directions how she shou'd proceed: Alantha took it; but instead of carrying it as directed, retir'd to her Cell, and breaking it open, found it contain'd as follows. The Confidence Don Fernando repos'd in my Ability and Care in conducting to his Arms the excellent Felisinda, is too great an Honour not to oblige my utmost Services---I have invented many Stratagems for your Escape, but none has so little the appearance of Danger as this which I now offer, it is a Ladder of Silk Cords, made so small, that you may easily conceal it in your Pocket till the happy Opportunity for making use of it arrives, which I hope may be about Twelve this Night--- I presume, when the young Nun rises to the Bell, you may easily slip out after her into the Garden, the Chappel joining to it---there is a Breach I have observ'd in one part of it, and you may without much difficulty get up to the Top on the inside, then for getting down on the other, the Ladder, on which you will find two little Hooks to fasten it to the Wall, will assist you; it is strong enough to bear a greater weight than your's, and at the bottom you will find, with Horses ready to convey you, him who is with all sincerity yours and Don Fernando's Most zealously devoted Servant, Cleomas. might at once disappoint Felisinda of all her Hopes, and re-enjoy the Blessing once more of seeing her admir'd Fernando, by making use of the Ladder herself and passing on Cleomas for Felisinda \--- she knew he had never seen that Lady, nor herself, but in a Veil, so that the difference between them wou'd not make discovery of her Treason---she cou'd not indeed expect a very kind reception from Fernando when brought to him, but she left the Event of that to Fortune, sometimes flattering herself that Time and Absence joyn'd to the improbabity there wou'd then appear of ever seeing the discovery of a Passion so great as hers, win him to make a suitable Return ---She resolv'd, however, to make Tryal of it; she could be, at worst, but rejected by him, and she should have this Consolation, that her Rival was not in possession of a Happiness which she vainly languish'd for. to the Temper of Mankind, that Fernando wou'd in time be brought to prefer the present, kind, obliging Fair, to one who was at a vast distance from him, and who he cou'd not hope to see without encountring innumerable Dangers---To cherish this Hope, she had the consideration of her own Charms, which in reality were such, as few cou'd equalize---In short, her Passion furnish'd her with Arguments sufficient to convince her, the Deceit she was about to practise, would be favourable to her Desires; and she was no less impatient for the Hour than Felisinda wou'd have been, had the Letter of she got over the Wall with all the ease imaginable; and finding Cleomas at the bottom, was mounted by him on a Horse he brought with him for the purpose--- they travell'd all Night for fear of a Pursuit, and taking By-Roads rendred it impossible for any who shou'd be sent in search of them to discover which way they took, Alantha hugg'd herself with the secret satisfaction of having circumvented her Rival, and began to assure herself of a fortunate Conclusion of an Affair, the beginning of which had met with so much success: But Heaven wou'd not suffer the Treachery she had been guilty of to go unpunish'd; by Deceit she hop'd to obtain her Wishes, and by Deceit it was, that she was made to repent the Injustice she had done. What is there so forcible as Love! when once that burning Passion rages in the Blood, vain are all the Tyes of Honour, Friendship, Gratitude, even Interest, the World's Idol, pleads but faintly when oppos'd against it! \---The Charms of the suppos'd Felisinda had an Effect too violent on the amorous Heart of the Gratification of his Wishes.  \---He lov'd and must enjoy; he had an opportunity, and resolv'd to make use of it--- He avoided, however, giving her any reason to suspect the Sentiments he had for her, till they were in a Wood a little distance from the Port where they where to take Ship; the Solitude of that place adding to the Boldness which his wild Passion had inspir'd, he there began to talk to her in a manner which both surpriz'd and frighted her; but assuming as much Courage as she could, she answer'd him in Terms, which she hop'd might strike an Awe into him; but the Desires he was possest of were not of a Nature to be easily quell'd, the Delicacies of Love were what he was utterly a Stranger to, and capable of no reflection but the Satisfaction of his brutal Wishes, instead of desisting his Importunities, prosecuted them with greater vehemence, every moment offering at Liberties which made her tremble: Come, Madam, said he, the Attempt and the Accomplishment of my Desires are of equal Consequence--- either wou'd ruin me with Fernando: I shall therefore take the securest Method to oblige you to secrecy, and at the same time make my self the happiest of Mankind---in speaking these Words he forc'd her to dismount, and was dragging her into the thickest and most lonely part of the Wood, when her Shrieks and Cries drew a Gentleman to her Assistance, who happened to be walking a little distance from them for his Diversion; she call'd to him for Protection as soon as he came in sight, and begg'd him to defend her Honour from that inhumane Ravisher.  Cleomas being enter'd into Villainy, wou'd not go back, resolving that nothing should prevent him from perpetrating the design he had begun: He had his Sword immediately drawn, and making a Pass at the other with greater Fury than Skill, lay open to the Thrust he gave, which piercing his Heart, he fell that moment dead--- Alantha, who had never been accustom'd to such Alarms, had not presence enough of Mind to sustain two such, as the offer'd Violation of her Honour, and the dreadful Consequence of preserving it occasion'd; she fainted away on the Grass assoon as she had seen Cleomas expire, and the Stranger drawing near to her Assistance, and lifting up her Veil, discover'd to his great surprize who she was, for he had been perfectly acquainted with her Family and self, before her Father, to gratifie a second Wife, had sent her to the Monastery---nor was she less astonish'd, when coming to herself, she found she was indebted to Don voluntary Exile from Valladolid had come to that place, with a design to embark with the first Ship bound for Brussels, having a desire to see that Court, and to try if Absence would have the Power to restore him to his former Tranquillity---tho' he had a great deal of Curiosity to know what strange Adventure had brought Alantha, so accompany'd, to that part of the Country so distant from her Relations, yet his Love got the better of it, and the first question he ask'd was of Felisinda: she made no scruple to inform him of the Death of Alvario, his strange Will, which while it decreed mutual Affection which was between her and that young Gentleman, and of the Stratagem he contriv'd to get her from the Monastery; but when she came to relate the Disappointment, which still detain'd her there, she paus'd and blush'd, not knowing in what manner to reveal either the Deceit she had been guilty of, or the Occasion of it.  Carlos, who was far from imagining the true Reason of her Silence, felt a painful Impatience to know the Consequence, and entreated her to proceed: If your Good Nature for me, said he, makes you unwilling to relate what you believe may give me Disquiet, I beg you to believe I suffer more in this Suspence---but why do I name Suspence?  I am already but too well assur'd she loves Fernando, and have demonstrated by resigning all those glorious Pretensions her Father's Goodness gave me, that her Felicity is infinitely dearer to me than my own---Speak then, Madam! continu'd he, speak the vast Endearments of this Happy Pair---Say their Designs were answer'd with Success---they met--- were married---and now in some blissful Privacy reap the full Harvest of their promis'd Joys. The Agonies with which he utter'd these words made Alantha bear him Company in sighs; she knew by Experience too much what sorts of Pangs those are which accompany despairing Love, not to pity his; and willing to appease the present Tumult of his Soul, tho' by it she disclos'd the weakness of her own; No, Don Carlos, answer'd she, you have this Consolation, that they triumph not over your too generous Passion, a sudden Caprice of Fate has rendred their Condition rather to be pity'd than envy'd---they trusted a Friend--- that Friend betray'd them---they now are parted, 'tis probable for ever. \--- Fernando has Charms, which can subvert one's very Nature, turn Truth itself to Falshood, and force the Heart, most scorning Treachery, to practise it---at least, pursu'd she, holding down her Head, and putting her Handkerchief up to her Eyes, the lost the utterance of her Words; but this was sufficient to make Don Carlos guess who it was had been the Betrayer of their Designs; however, being desirous of knowing the whole Affair, he made use of all his Eloquence to persuade her to a recital of the Particulars, which at length he prevail'd on her to do.  \---Never was amazement equal to what he felt at this Account---he had now no need of asking the Affairs of Alantha, the latter part of the History of Contemplation on the Force of Love, and the strange Turn of Fortune in disappointing those Lovers, when each thought themselves on the very brink of Happiness---his generous Heart truly pitied their Distress, and as much as the Nature of the Passion he was inspir'd with would permit, wish'd them a relief. Not all the Pangs he felt from his Despair, cou'd render him self-interested enough to approve of what Alantha had done, and wonder'd that the same Passion shou'd produce Effects so vastly different---He, to give the Person he ador'd Content, had sacrific'd his own; but she had made herself unhappy, to afflict the Man she lov'd---He could not forbear expressing his Sentiments on the occasion, in Terms, which added to the Confusion she was before involv'd in; and as she was of a most excellent Disposition, soft, and tenderly commiserating the Woes of others, 'till Despair and Love rendred her incapable of being Mistress of her Actions, she look'd back with the utmost Shame and Remorse on the Perfidy her ungovernable Passion had inconsiderately hurry'd her to commit; and being willing to make what Atonement was in her Power, told Don Carlos she was resolv'd to go to--- where she knew Fernando waited in expectation of Cleomas and Felisinda, and confess the Fault of her distracted Passion, and joyn with him in the finding some other Expedient, which might be more lucky than the former, to restore him to those Hopes her Falshood had depriv'd him of.  Carlos extremely applauded her Resolution, and to strengthen her in it, made a large Encomium on Self-denial, and represented how glorious it was to give Happiness to others, in so moving and elegant a manner, that she assur'd him she wou'd endeavour to deserve that Character, tho' it shou'd cost her Life in the Attempt--- He also acquainted her with his Design of going to Brussels, and assur'd her that he wou'd take care of her till she was safely arriv'd at Don Fernando's. averse, shou'd favour their Embarking. After a long and tedious Expectation, an Opportunity at length offer'd,---they had a prosperous Voyage, and in due Time arriv'd at Brussels. Enquiring for Fernando, they soon heard of him, but heard that he had that very day left the place, it was suppos'd to return to Spain, of which Country he had declar'd himself a Native: sincere in her Repentance, and was vex'd to the Soul at missing the Opportunity of proving it---She complain'd of the Misfortune in Terms so lively and piercing, that Carlos was prodigiously affected with a Generosity, which indeed his Example and Advice had the greatest share in inspiring, and offer'd to accompany her back to Valladolid, tho' it was a place, which to return to, he knew wou'd rouze afresh the Idea of his Despair; yet, full of an uncommon sublimity of Passion, he resolv'd to prosecute what he had begun, and fix the Happiness of Felisinda, whatever became of himself--- Alantha rejoyc'd at his Intention, and so eager were they in pursuing it, that the Fatigue of their late Journey and Voyage had scarce wore itself off; the Weather favouring their Intentions, before they enter'd on a Second ---but Alantha unaccustom'd to the Toils of Travel, fell so ill at her Landing, that it was impossible for her to remove any farther, and as to endeavour to be serviceable to Felisinda, wou'd not go to Valladolid without her; the Disorders of her Mind, occasion'd by the terrible Violence she did her Passion, to render Justice to her Honour, added to her Malady, and she continued too weak to undertake a Journey for some Months in that Condition; therefore let us leave her for a while, to see what was become of Fernando. no News of them, that he resolv'd to return to Valladolid, there to learn the Certainty of his Fate; a thousand different Conjectures had taken their Turns, to torture him which varied, but incessant Fears; sometimes he imagin'd some Accident had happen'd on the Road---at others, his wild Fancy presented knew not what to think, nor which of these Evils would be least dreadful to be born---but as there is nothing more impossible, by a Mind not stupid and insensible of either Hopes or Fears, to be supported with Patience than Suspence, especially where Love and the Interest of the belov'd Object is in question, he cou'd not wait the slow Result of all-discovering Time, for the Certainty of his Happiness or Misery---He must immediately be assur'd; and to that End left--- without any Consideration what might be the Consequence of being seen at Valladolid, if it were true that Felisinda had left the Monastery ---Nothing happening worthy of Remark till he came there, I shall pass over the Particulars of his Journey, and only say, that he was accompany'd with Cogitations, which every moment grew more and more perplexing, and made little capable of feeling those Fatigues which must of Consequence attend all who Travel in that manner his Impatience made him; for no Shipping being ready to go out, he embark'd in a kind of Ferry, which are only made use of to cross some little Arm of the Sea, but are wholly improper to be trusted into the main Ocean; and it was not without the Assurance of very great Rewards, that he prevail'd on the Men who guided it, to venture on so dangerous an Expedition.  It was indeed very near being a fatal one to them all, for they had scarce lost sight of Land, when a Storm arose, and tost the little Boat up and down with so much Violence, that at every Blast it seem'd to be o'erwhelmed--- but the good Angel of Fernando was here, as in every other Accident of Life, most watchful o'er his Charge, and once more brought them safe to Shore.  Our Heroe himself was convinc'd of the Danger he had been in, and willing to shun Death, chiefly because it wou'd deprive him of Felisinda, was very well satisfied to find himself again on Land, tho' the Place they were driven to was little different from a Desart; no House was to be seen in it, and he was oblig'd to take Shelter with his little Company in a Cottage, which belong'd to a Fisherman, from the Fury of the yet continuing Tempest---Enquiring where he was, he found he was above Twenty Leagues distant from any Town; there was no such thing as a Horse to be had; and assoon as the Weather clear'd up a little, he was oblig'd to go on Foot, till he reach'd Malla, a little Village, where with much ado he accommodated himself, and in a few Days had the welcome sight of Valladolid \---Nothing else having happen'd worthy of remark till he came there, I shall pass over the Particulars, and only say that he was accompany'd with Cogitations, which every moment grew more and more perplexing, and made him little capable of feeling those Fatigues; which must of Necessity attend all who travel in that manner, which his Impatience had oblig'd him to do.  So infinitely superior are the Disorders of the Mind to any the Body can sustain! for Cleomas; and being told he had been a considerable time missing, and that where he had retir'd himself was utterly unknown, he fell into the most terrible Agonies imaginable; now, not doubting but that he had play'd him false, and convey'd Felisinda far from his Hope ever to see her more--- He went directly to the Monastery, he shou'd hear in what manner she had been convey'd away by Berinthia, and from Alantha he expected something farther of his Misfortune; but before he had reach'd the outer Gate, he found himself seiz'd by Officers, who taking his Sword from him, told him he was their Prisoner, and must go with them---The Surprize he was in, prevented him not from asking the Cause of such Treatment, being neither indebted, nor guilty of any Crime, which submitted him to the Law. No, no, cry'd one of them, with the Insolence of those Villains in Authority, you think it no Crime, I suppose, to Steal a Maid of Quality from the Nunnery---but believe, before you get out of our hands you will be better inform'd---Aye, aye, added another of them, Signor, you are like to pay dear for your Pleasures ---What, were there not enow kind willing Creatures but you must Ravish? Ravish from a Nunnery too!---they were running on with a great deal more such like insulting Expressions, which wou'd have been little supportable by a Man of Fernando's Spirit, at another time; and unarm'd as he was, oblig'd him to some desperate means of compelling them to more Civility: but the first part of what they said, had taken from him the Power of listning to the other; and not doubting but that it was on Felisinda's account he was apprehended, and that she was really gone, was now confirm'd in what before he trembled but to guess---Is it then true! cry'd he, in an Agony of Soul, which is not to be exprest, am I indeed so curst, so lost a Wretch?  \---Fatal Effect of my presumptuous Passion!---take me, continu'd he raving, do with me what you will--- Shut me from Light, from Food, from sight of Man; load me with Irons, torture me with Racks, 'tis all too little for the curst Author of that Dear, that Heavenly Maid's Undoing---These Words, which his Despair made him utter, as being now perfectly assur'd that Cleomas had injur'd him with Felisinda, or that some Accident either by Sea or Land had happen'd to destroy them both, serv'd to make him appear more guilty, and were afterwards alledg'd as Proofs against him. there---the Grief and Confusion of his Mind not permitting him to ask any Questions, or send to any of his Friends, he concluded that Felisinda owed her Death or the Ruin of her Honour to his unhappy Passion, and was so desperate, that he lamented his Confinement only as it kept him from the means of searching for her where'er he cou'd imagine there was a prospect of hearing what was become of her, which he now was far from hoping he cou'd do in Valladolid. He was full of Reflections too terrible for Description, and little inferiour to those which we conceive the Damn'd endure, and make the severest Woes of Hell, when the Goaler deliver'd him a Letter, which knowing by the Character on the Superscription that it came from Donna Berinthia, he hastily open'd, and found it contain'd these Lines. The Interest I take in your Affairs, makes me not less concern'd at your Indiscretion, in putting yourself in the Power of your Enemies, than I was angry at the Crime which has justly created you so many. Had your Passion for Alantha been such as a Maid of her Quality and Accomplishments merited from you, why was not the Consent ask'd of those who had the Power of disposing her? or why was not I consulted, who for many Reasons would have rejoyc'd to have been serviceable in that Affair?--- but I will not reproach you for what you have done, but according to the sincere Friendship I ever have had for you, advise you in what you are to do--- Tho' I hope you need not any Arguments to prevail on you, to repair the Injury you have done that Lady's Honour, by publickly Marrying her, it is I know what will be exacted from you, and it will have much the better Face if you do it uncompell'd--- forgive a Rival, who under the pretence of Friendship, robb'd her of a Heart she thought herself secure of, has yet too great a Tenderness for you to endure you shou'd suffer yourself to fall into the Inconveniencies and, perhaps, Dangers which you must else expect. The Father and Relations of Alantha, are preparing to bring you to a Tryal; I am afraid it will not be in the Power of all the Friends you can raise to enable you to stand against so just a Complaint as that alledg'd against you; neither will it be for the Reputation of any to attempt your Vindication--- Even my self, prejudic'd as I am by Friendship, must plead against you in the Right of her who was committed to my Care---See therefore that you produce her---Produce her as your lawful Wife, and by that Claim, I hope you will be allow'd to compensate both with that Saint whose Shrine you have depriv'd of an intended Devotee, and the Family whom your ungovern'd Passion has dishonour'd---As for the Affront to me, I readily forgive it, and as far as it becomes my Sex and Place, shall Endeavour to soften the Severity of your Accusation. Berinthia. will be otherwise impossible for him to comprehend either the Surprize or Joy, which at reading this Epistle seiz'd on his Soul---to find that Felisinda was safe, was well, and in the Monastery, afforded him a Satisfaction adequate to the Tortures he had been afflicted with, while he believ'd it otherwise--- But to find himself accus'd of a Crime of which he was entirely innocent, and to be told that she, for whose sake he had suffer'd so much, imagin'd him false, ungrateful, and perfidious, rais'd a Tumult in his Thoughts, which nothing cou'd equalize, but the Wonder what it was which had occasion'd Suggestions so vastly distant from the Truth---to hear that Alantha was gone, and Felisinda remain'd behind, were Inconsistencies such as he could not reconile, nor find any way to account for.  \---His Mind, however, being much more at Ease than it had been, he endeavour'd in the first place to clear his suspected Faith to Felisinda, and his Honour to Berinthia, and accordingly writ to them both, which containing Repetitions of what the Reader is already acquainted with, will be but needless to insert---but not all the Affection which these Ladies had for him, cou'd make either of 'em believe the Asseveration he made that he was entirely ignorant of Caution she had given him, had been so little regarded: she writ to him again, assuring him that those little Evasions which he made use of to excuse himself to her, wou'd be of no weight before a Judge, and that it was rather an Aggravation of his Guilt, than the Contrary, to deny it---that Alantha's Escape was plainly prov'd to be by his Instigations, he having left a Person to assist her in it, and convey her to him, and that the Discovery of this happen'd thro' the distraction of Felisinda when she found she had been abus'd with a fictitious Story, by a Letter which Cleomas had written to this Fernando had something more light into the Affair of his Accusation than before---He now perceiv'd that Alantha had been taken away by than he cou'd to what place they were gone, or wherefore, if Cleomas were really enamour'd of that Lady, he did not also convey the other, as he had promis'd him with a thousand Oaths he wou'd---To all this he was yet in the Dark, and it appear'd so intricate a Business, that the more Conjectures he form'd, the more impossible he thought it for any of them to be the right: He gave himself not much trouble about preparing a Defence against the Accusations to be brought against him; for conscious of his Innocence in all they shou'd alledge, he doubted not but to make it appear so---He writ, indeed, several other Letters to Donna much affronted and injur'd by his Deceit, that they forbore sending to him for many days, which was a sensible Affliction to him; but he consoled himself with the belief, that in a little Time he shou'd be clear'd in their Opinion. One Evening as he was sitting full of various Perturbations, a Letter was brought to him from Berinthia, which gave him a great deal of Satisfaction to receive, not only because he hop'd to hear something of Felisinda, but also that he felt a Tenderness for that Lady, which made him pleas'd to find himself not forgotten by her. The manner in which she writ to him was this. Tho' the little Sincerity with which you treat your Friends, ought to forfeit you their Esteem, I am still so much yours, as to conjure you not to trifle away your Time: Believe me, you will find all that is allowed you till your Tryal, too little to make an Interest, such as your Cause requires---You might indeed put an immediate end to the Difficulties you are in, by producing counterfeiting an ignorance of her Affairs, makes me fear you design nothing that is Just or Honourable by that Unhappy Lady; and the Grief it gives me, to Perceive you have so little profited by those Advantages of Education, which you receiv'd from the Goodness of Alvario, or the Admonitions I have taken so much pains to give you, is infinitely beyond what you can have any notion of---I beg of you, however, if neither Conscience nor Gratitude can move you, that you will have some regard to your own Safety, and not, thro' yourself, wound more severely than you have yet done, the Soul of the Afflicted Berinthia. more Softness, than the Reproaches it contain'd, did with Perplexity--- He answer'd it as he had done the former ones, and long'd with an undiscribable Impatience for the Hour in which his Innocence shou'd be known, and he restor'd to the Favour he was accustomed to find from her. appointed for his Judges; his Tryal came on, but not as he expected ---He was charg'd not only with Stealing Alantha from the Monastery, but also with her Death; and nothing but his producing her, was sufficient to remove this Accusation--- It was in vain for him to attest his Innocence---in vain that he protested he never had any Acquaintance with that Lady, but as she befriended him in delivering his Letters to Felisinda; his Oath wou'd not be taken in his own Defence,--- He had no body to appear for him, and his Accusers were numerous---all the Kindred of Alantha, with all the Interest they cou'd raise--- and to those he had a great many other as implacable Enemies added.  \---Several there were who bore him a secret Grudge for his being belov'd by Felisinda, and not a few who, nearly related to Alvario, hated him on the Account of that Moiety of the Estate left him by Will, which they imagin'd an injury to them, and believ'd he had by Artifices wound himself into that Gentleman's Favour, and thereby defrauded them of their Right---in fine, every thing was against him; Appearances and the Inclination of the Judges join'd to make him Guilty, and he was sentenc'd to Death.  \---Donna Berinthia, who had sat all the Time of his Tryal in a Chair near the Bar, and with the greatest Anxiety of Mind imaginable had listned to all that pass'd, no sooner heard the fatal Doom, than unable to contain herself, she cry'd out with a great Shriek;---Oh my Son! \---My Son! \---My dear unhappy Son! and fell that Moment motionless at the Judges Feet---So strange an Accident and Discovery gave a prodigious Alarm to all that were in presence; and as she was a Lady whose exemplary Piety, Goodness and Wisdom, as well as the Function she bore, rendred her universally beloved and respected, every body was at Strife who shou'd be most assiduous in offering her Relief. \---Their Endeavours brought her in a short time to herself, but the first thing she did when she open'd her Eyes, was to throw 'em wildly round the place in search of Fernando, who from the Time of her Exclamation had stood like one bereft of Sense, so great was his Amazement at what he saw and heard.  Assoon as she perceiv'd him, Oh let me fly to him, said she, let me take a last Embrace---let me in Tears and Blessings now pour out all the Mother on him--- A Mother never till now confess'd, and now too late---A Flood of Grief here intercepted the Passage of her Words, she cou'd no more, and as he had recollected himself enough to know what was his Duty, and had thrown himself on his Knees, she fainted away a second time, nor cou'd all their Endeavours for a good while recover her---but when they had, resisting the violence of her Affliction as much as possible, and turning to the Judges, Pardon, my Lords, said she, my Woman's Weakness---I sooner, or not at all, shou'd have reveal'd this Secret; and if a Mother's Love cou'd not permit her only Son to go to Death unknowing of her Grief, it ought not have been this August Assembly my Complaints shou'd have disturb'd---But since the long-hid Truth, in Spite of me, has forc'd itself thro' all the Bars Reserve and Prudence laid, permit me, as you know the Consequence, to acquaint you with the Beginnings of a Secret, yet only known to Heaven.  Her Behaviour, and the Discovery she had made, had occasion'd so general a Consternation, that there was scarcely one in presence, who would not have given almost any thing to have had the Mystery unfolded; and those whose Priviledge it was to speak, telling her, that next to the having it in their Power to remove the Cause of her Affliction, nothing cou'd afford them so much satisfaction as the hearing an Adventure which could not but be very remarkable, and which happened to a Lady for whom all the World had so high a regard---The disconsolate to her any otherwise than with a Bow; but after having paus'd a little, as tho' to call to mind the Particulars she was going to relate, began the Account she had promis'd to give 'em in these Words. Marquiss D'Avila; I believe there are none here ignorant of my Birth, or the great Possessions I was left Mistress of by the Death of that Grandee \---Therefore shall pass over those Days of Tranquillity, and begin at the Rise of my Misfortunes. My Father sometime before he dy'd had commenc'd a more than ordinary Friendship for Don Francisco insomuch, that by his Will he was made sole Guardian of me and my Fortune---It was not more than a Week after the Funeral Obsequies were over, before I found I shou'd have Reason to lament his Choice. Francisco had a Son whom his Avarice and Ambition aim'd to make the Master of the Marquiss's Estate. He propos'd the matter to me in a manner which let me see he expected I wou'd consent.  I know not whether Disdain or Anger had the greatest share in my Thoughts, while I was oblig'd to listen to what he said; but when I found he had done speaking, I answer'd him in Terms, which sufficiently express'd how much of both I conceiv'd for his Designs---He had the Artifice, however, to conceal his Discontent at my Refusal, and endeavour'd to soften my Resentment, by telling me nothing could have prevail'd on him to have been guilty of so much Presumption, but to save the Life of a darling Son, who was possess'd of too violent a Passion for me, to suffer him to live, if I refus'd to encourage it.  The Flatteries he made use of, were as odious as the Assurance with which he at first declared his Intentions; but to put an end to both, I told him, I thought it was yet too early for me to think of Love; but that in a proper time I wou'd consider on what he had said: I was indeed by this time a little vex'd that I had seem'd to resent so far the Indignity with which I thought myself treated, and thinking it my safest way to get the Power my Father had entrusted him with, out of his hands, before I let him know my real Sentiments, dismiss'd him with a greater show of Civility than he deserv'd, or than I cou'd, without doing a Violence to myself, assume. But a strange turn of Fortune immediately happening, the Complaisance I had before dissembled, I was oblig'd to make use of in reality---Don the High Court of Judicature for the Estate also Francisco had been bred to the Law, was one of the most Cunning that ever practis'd it, and, besides, was the best acquainted with the Truth of our Affairs of any body: It was on him therefore I cou'd alone rely; it was him in whom I was forc'd to confide, and to depend. The Suit was long, and made so great a Noise, that doubtless it has reach'd your Ears; the Success indeed was mine, but I was frequently in all Appearances so near losing it, and so much distrest by that means, (which as I have since heard was purposely contriv'd by Francisco to work me to his Designs) that in the midst of my Trouble he extorted from me a Promise in Writing, to marry his Son, in case he shou'd secure my Patrimony.  But, alas! before the Cause being determin'd in my favour cou'd encourage him to demand the Performance of the Contract, Fate threw a Bar to disappoint his Hopes, greater than that my former Aversion had oppos'd--- (there having been a long Intimacy between our Families) to visit me: Whatever Endeavours I had been making to enable me to keep my Word with Francisco were now render'd of no Effect; I lov'd Alvario from the first moment I beheld him, and have had many reasons since to believe I made the same Impression on him---both felt a Passion too violent for Constraint, we lov'd, and we confess'd it to each other, but conceal'd it from the rest of the World.  He thought it not proper to acquaint his Father with his Sentiments of me, till he saw how my Affairs would go, fearing that, tho' he had a great Esteem for me, he wou'd not be satisfied his Son shou'd marry a Woman who, 'twas probable, might have no other Fortune than her intrinsick Worth---It was for this reason our Amour was kept a secret till after the Decree, and when it was past, my Engagements to Francisco deterr'd me from revealing it.  I very well knew the Advantages he wou'd have over me, if I attempted to break thro' a Contract, so solemn and so secure as that he had exacted from me it was with the most ardent and tender Sollicitations that Alvario was continually importuning me; either to run the Risque of all that Villain cou'd alledge against me, or to permit him to set me free, by driving from the World that Extorter of my Faith: but to neither of these cou'd I ever be brought to consent; I lov'd him with a Regard too sincere and disinterested to suffer him to be Partaker of my Misfortunes; and contenting myself for the present with the Happiness of daily seeing the Man who was so dear to me, left the compleating my future Felicity to Fate, still hoping that some lucky Revolution wou'd happen to make me Mistress of myself--- But in this Time of mutual Tenderness, I looking on him as my Husband, being the only Man I resolv'd shou'd ever be so, there pass'd between us what nothing but the extreme Extravagance of my Grief cou'd have oblig'd me to reveal--- But there, continued she, pointing to Fernando there stands the unhappy Product of his Mother's too great Affection and unresisting Tenderness! Speech; she stopp'd for some Moments, unable to proceed; but perceiving the whole Assembly had their Eyes fix'd on Fernando, and as she thought with a greater show of Softness and Concern than they had done before it, encourag'd her to resume her Story, which she did in these Words. from the World, and at the same time, under a borrow'd Name, expressing the most tender Indulgence to the Child, was some Alleviation of my Sorrows; nor did I doubt but he wou'd gladly repair my Honour, by publickly Marrying me assoon as I had got rid of my Engagement with Francisco but that, alas! was an Impossibility, and all the Offers I made him to release me, were in vain; at last, tir'd with a fruitless Hope, and unwilling to be the hindrance of Alvario's Fortune, he being at that Time belov'd by a Lady of Quality and Beauty, I retir'd myself from the World, and gave my free Consent that he should Marry, which he soon after did the Lovely and Vertuous Mariana, by whom he had Felisinda. Thus you see my Reasons for entring into a Life, which I now find so much Pleasure in, that methinks I wonder all my Sex are not Monasticks, or how they can be so far infatuated, as to prefer the bitter Sweets and Troubles of a noisy World, to that happy Tranquillity a Cloyster affords---And thus, in the Confession of my Foible, are two Things unravell'd, which I am satisfied have hitherto seem'd Riddles, the one why Alvario, neglecting those who seem'd the nearest in Blood, left so much of his Estate to one believ'd a Stranger to his Name; and the other, why both that Gentleman and Myself so strenuously oppos'd the Marriage of Fernando and Felisinda. If this Discovery may have the Effect it ought, to make those Relations of discontented than they have been, and to prevail on Fernando to convert the Passion he long has had for Felisinda, into that sort of Love, which a Brother may be allow'd to have for a Sister, I shall not repent that I have made it: and above all, if that unhappy Youth, now knowing it altogether impossible to gratifie his Desires by Marrying with Felisinda, will discover where Alantha is, and make himself her Husband, I shall return contented to my Cell, and have no more to do with Care or Fear. she receiv'd on her generous Manner of proceeding, were suitable to the general Esteem her Behaviour had acquir'd; but she was little in a Condition of answering them; her Concern for her Son o'erwhelm'd all other Regards; and assoon as she had done speaking, she turn'd to him, and by her Looks and Gestures sufficiently demonstrated how dear he was to her, and the Anguish of her Mind for what she expected him to suffer.  The Judges highly commiserating her Condition, after a few Words of Consultation among themselves, told her, that in respect to the Agonies they saw her in, they wou'd delay the Execution of the Sentence on Fernando, that he shou'd have a whole Month to consider what to do; but if in that Time Alantha were not found, he must not depend on hope of future Mercy.  They cou'd not hinder the transported Mother from falling on her Knees, to thank 'em for this unlook'd-for Reprieve; but Fernando seem'd little mov'd at it; and the Court was just going to break up, when a confus'd Noise was heard at the Door, and presently after they saw Alantha, led by Carlos, enter, and come up to the place where they were sitting with a Hast which demonstrated their Impatience to be heard; which assoon as they were near enough, See here, most Righteous Judges! cry'd Carlos, the Cause of the Debate before you; confess her Fault, and clear the injur'd Prisoner. At these Words all the Assembly, as much now prejudic'd in Favour of Fernando as before they were the contrary, gave a great Shout; but the Judges commanding Silence shou'd be kept, resum'd their Seats, till that Gentleman recited all the Particulars of happen'd to her since his meeting her with Cleomas in the Desart, the Fatigue that both of 'em had endur'd in the Search of Fernando, adding that it was only an Indisposition of Alantha's which had prevented their return to Valladolid much sooner, and consequently sav'd them the trouble of this Tryal; and Fernando, the Perplexity he had been in, for an Accusation which was altogether groundless Alantha spoke not, nor was it necessary she shou'd, her Presence and her Blushes sufficiently confess'd the Truth of what he said---What were now the Raptures of the o'erjoy'd Berinthia! She ran to the generous Carlos, embrac'd him with an Eagerness like that with which transported Lovers meet; then turning to Alantha, I cannot chide you now, said she, tho' your Offence has cost me many Tears, your Presence now o'erpays 'em all---but let us hast, cry'd she, to make the mournful Felisinda Partaker of our Joy; she now may unoppos'd converse with Fernando: In speaking this, she took Carlos by the Hand, in order to lead him to the Monastery; but that dispairing Lover had receiv'd too great shock by her last Words, to be willing to accompany her: He thought he had done all that his Honour requir'd, and cou'd not impose so severe a Task on himself, as to be witness of a Happiness which he imagin'd so prejudicial to himself, and modestly begging leave to withdraw, put Berinthia in mind of what she had been told concerning his noble Passion for Felisinda, and made her easily guess he had mistook her meaning; but resolving to compleat the Felicity of 'em all, if possible, told him he had nothing now to fear from the Rivalship of Fernando, and that she doubted not but the Visit she engag'd him in, wou'd be to his Satisfaction. Tho' he was far from comprehending what she meant, yet he consented to go with her, Fernando and Alantha follow'd, and when they came to the Monastery where Result, the whole Affair was recounted before her.  To endeavour to describe the Joy which Carlos and Alantha felt at a Discovery so favourable to their Inclinations, wou'd be but vain: Fernando and Felisinda, who cou'd not presently fashion themselves to forget the Passion they had regarded each other with, were the only Persons who had any remains of Perplexity; but that Lady justly weighing the Merits of Carlos, his constant Affection, his Generosity, and the Sufferings he had endur'd for her, consented, by the Persuasions of Fidelity: Fernando following her Example, did the same by Alantha. And thus happily ended an Affair, which at first promis'd only a lasting Series of Misfortunes.
