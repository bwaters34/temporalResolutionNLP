MORRIS. -  July 22, 1833. Dear ---The jaunt from Albany to Saratoga, over the rail-road, can now be accomplished in less than three hours, and the consequence is that, even at this early season, nearly all the hotels and board-houses in the village are thronged with visitors. There cannot be less than three thousand strangers here at the present time, and every car is constantly adding to the number. Congress-hall is, as formerly, the resort of the light-hearted, the gay, the idle, and the fashionable; but those who come to partake of the life-giving waters, generally repair to more congenial and quiet abodes. To those disposed to be busy, there is no lack of employment. What with eating and drinking, walking and riding, gunning and fishing, dancing and flirting---balls, concerts, and parties---dressing for this, that, and the other, and similar suitable, and equally profitable occupations, time is disposed of without the least trouble. Every thing is calculated to beguile one of pensive thoughts, and occasionally there is an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-002.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] entertainment of no ordinary description. The other evening, for instance, we had a musical soir ee , in which that accomplished song-bird, Miss Hughes, assisted by Sinclair, Horn, and other professional persons, took part. The large room of the United States hotel was occupied by an audience resembling those which attended the Payne and Dunlap festivals; all the performers were in fine spirits, and sung and played delightfully. The "Young Cavalier," the "Mermaid's Cave," and "Auld Robin Gray," in particular, were given by Miss Hughes in her own impressive manner, and are now remembered as "faded strains that float upon the mind like half-forgotten dreams." This young lady never looked more lovely, nor warbled her melodies with more effect. Gossip, scandal, and killing character, are considered innocent pastime at Saratoga. I am writing this at a window that overlooks the piazza of Congress-hall. The weather is pleasant---the "shades of evening thicken slowly," and the tide of fashion is flowing beneath me like the waves of the sea. I have been told the history and condition of numerous individuals, and, for want of better materials, and in compliance with the universal custom of all modern letter-writers, I will point out a few of the most conspicuous for your especial diversion. First, we have a whole platoon of gentlemen with canes, most of whom have been the subjects of much enviable conversation lately. Johnson says [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-003.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] that "a person who carries a cane has generally an upper story to let!" The doctor was undoubtedly a very great man, and a close observer of human nature. His opinions, with me, have all the sanction of law authority. You perceive that stout gentleman in black? He is an epicure, and does little else than eat, the live-long day. He made a voyage to London last year expressly for the purpose of enjoying a dish of soles with shrimp sauce! and has come to the springs now to put his digestive apparatus in good order, before the ensuing season of plum-puddings, buckwheat-cakes and mince-pies, three prime articles, of which he professes to be exceedingly fond, and of which he is said, about the holidays, to devour a most inordinate quantity. He plays the best knife and fork in the village, and is the admiration of all the gourmands at the south. Move on, old Falstaff! Room for a travelled dandy---a fellow who went abroad a puppy, and returned as he went---with nothing added to his former stock of information, except the cut of his garments, a short-napped hat, and that pair of enormous whiskers---in all of which he "reigns and revels!" Yonder floats a little man, with a little stick, a little pair of gloves, and a little voice. He is engaged to that enormously fat young widow beside him, whose fortune is estimated at sixty thousand dollars. The little man is not worth a groat, and is the very antipodes of his dulcinea; but you know, "In joining contrasts lieth love's delight." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-004.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] Here comes a foreigner of distinction---a duke! Mark his princely air and noble carriage. Observe the diamond hoop upon his little finger, and the circling hair upon his upper lip! Is he not a magnificent specimen of the "paragon of animals?" For the last six hours he has been the "observed of all observers," the presiding genius of the place, and his flirtation with a certain meek, blue-eyed quakeress, at the Union, who, for his dear sake, is in imminent danger of being read out of meeting, has created the first positive sensation of the season. The duke is reported to be immensely rich---the lady is known to be so. "The form of Hercules affects the sylphs." But who is that mild, intellectual-looking being, languishing in the shade? She is leaning upon the arm of General Van R. and talking to Chancellor K. That lady, I mean, attired in the plain white dress, with her hair modestly parted on her forehead---she of the smiling lip and speaking eye--- "That looks not like the inhabitants o' the earth, And yet is on't." Oh, I see---Miss ---. I should have known her among ten thousand, for she is an ornament to her sex and country. What a contrast she presents to the proud, haughty belle in her wake, half buried beneath the weight of gold and jewels! "Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-005.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] Heavens, how she tosses her pretty head, and gives the nod of recognition to those around her! "The wealth of worlds is heaped on her in vain." Lady, for all your smiles and winning ways, I do not envy the poor youth who wears your chains; they are woven of any thing but flowers. She has the riches of Croesus, the beauty of Hebe---but the temper of Xantippe. Yet mind, dear ---, I tell you this in confidence, so don't let it go any further. But what have we next? generals and judges, and public characters by the score! A whole bevy of widows, old maids, and solitary spinsters, without any particular claim to distinction. A sudden pause in the crowd. Several carriages with their out-riders have rolled up to the door, emblazoned with the crests of the nobility of this democratic land! I cannot admire the horses sufficiently; but as for those who have just alighted --- The bell rings for supper---so, ladies and gentlemen--- no time for compliments. Is it not strange that the very things to which this village is indebted for all its consequence, are most neglected? The hotels are spacious---the accommodations convenient, and the attendance unexceptionable; but the springs themselves are in a shocking condition. Instead of splendid colonnades, attractive apartments, spacious pump-rooms, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-006.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] marble counters, sparkling fountains, and neat, well-dressed women to wait upon the company, as in other countries, you are compelled to stand ankledeep in the mud, or upon a miserable platform, constructed over a filthy brook, and receive the water from a bare-footed, meanly-clad juvenile, who dips it up in an unclean vessel, and flings it at you with a sleight of hand peculiarly his own. In place of taking the water as an inviting, health-restoring beverage, you seize the glass with a wry face and an involuntary shudder, and swallow its contents with the same repugnance you entertain for nauseous medicine. On rainy days, invalids cannot go to the springs, unless they are satisfied to have the outer as well as inner man, most thoroughly drenched, as there is no friendly covering to shield them from the weather. Really this is too bad, for the most fashionable watering-place in America. -  July, 1833. Dear \---, The tides of fashion, like those of the sea, are constantly in motion: no sooner does one wave recede than another takes its place; and so, at the springs, as one carriage passes away with its light-hearted occupants, another arrives at the gate; and there stands mine host of the Congress, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-007.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] with his ever-pleasant smile and courteous bow, ready to "Welcome the coming---speed the parting guest." The hasty farewell is scarcely spoken, before the "new arrival" engrosses all the attention; and your mineral-water companion of yesterday vanishes from your memory, to make room for some new acquaintance of to-day, who, in his turn, is also doomed to mingle with the misty recollections of the past, and, in a brief period, to be forgotten forever. Friendships formed here are fleeting and evanescent. Excitement is the grand object of pursuit; and how can people be so unreasonable as to expect those to feel , who never have leisure to think? Nearly every house in the village is overflowing, and visitors are still coming. I shall not attempt to give you a particular description of all the individuals I have encountered here; and for ten thousand reasons, three of which, however, will suffice at the present time. In the first place, I have no idea of manufacturing a book of travels during this hot weather. In the second, (mark what an eye I have for business,) most of the people here are subscribers to the Mirror, and I never take any liberties with them, you know. And "lastly, and to conclude," those who are not subscribers, (if any such there be!) cannot be supposed worthy of either the time or the trouble. Yet, dear ---, if you will take a chair with me in this spacious drawing-room, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-008.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] (you had a glimpse at the piazza in my last,) I will point out a few characters from among the company here assembled, and tell you all I know about them. This may amuse you till the bell rings for tea. Oh, come along; we will say nothing to wound the feelings of any body, for scandal, I am aware, is your abhorrence, yet it is a very fashionable accomplishment at most watering-places, although, I am happy to say, I have heard little of it here. You observe that mild, matronly-looking lady, near the window yonder? Is she not a pattern of neatness and propriety? Her story must be an interesting one, and not destitute of a moral. I wish I knew it. I remember her from my boyhood, and shall never forget her looks one fine Sunday morning, as she entered Trinity church, leaning on the arm of poor ---. I never saw any thing more beautiful than she, at that moment, appeared to my inexperienced eyes; all my after dreams of female loveliness were associated with her. I could not imagine a being more perfect; but I was very young then, and she was engaged to be married. I saw her again, after I had arrived at man's estate; but oh, how altered! She was still single. --- and she ha some misunderstanding, and he had gone to England, and died there, I think they told me. I never heard any further particulars. Still she was much admired for her beauty, and beloved for her goodness of heart; and, as she was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-009.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] immensely rich, must have had opportunities enough of forming what is generally understood, a "convenient alliance," for men, or I am much mistaken, were as worldly-wise formerly as now. I never saw her afterward, until we met the other day at these springs. There are more old maids in the world than remain so from necessity. That "no American should wish to trace his ancestry further back than the revolutionary war," is a good sentiment. I admire and will stand by it. Yet, while I disapprove, most heartily, of the conceited airs and flimsy pretensions which certain little people arrogate to themselves on account of their birth-right, I cannot subscribe to one particle of the cant I am in the habit of hearing expressed on these subjects. It is not "the same thing," to me , at least, whether my father was a count or a coal-heaver, a prince or a pickpocket. I would have all my relations, past, present, and to come, good and respectable people, and should prefer the blood of the Howards to that of the convicts of Botany-bay---nor do I believe I am at all singular in these particulars. It is nothing more than a natural feeling. Still I would not think ill of a man on account of any misfortune that may have attended his birth, nor well of a man simply because he happened to be cradled in the lap of affluence and power. The first may be one of nature's noblemen, and the other a poor dog, notwithstanding all his splendor; and that this frequently happens, every day's experience [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] affords us abundant testimony. That the claims of all to distinction should rest upon one's own individual talents, deportment, and character, is also sound doctrine, and cannot be disputed: yet this is no reason why we should not have an honest and becoming pride in the genius, integrity, or gallant bearing of those from whom we sprung. Now, yonder stands a gentleman, who, in my humble judgment, cannot but indulge a secret glow of satisfaction, while contemplating the roots of his family tree. He came from a good stock---the old Dutch settlers of New-Amsterdam--- than which no blood that flows in the human veins is either purer, better, or braver. His forefathers were eminently conspicuous as Christians, soldiers, and sages; they occupied the high places of honor and authority---were the ornaments of their day and generation, and, notwithstanding the shade of ridicule which a popular writer has cast around and interwoven with their history, their memories will ever be cherished until virtue ceases to be an attribute of the human mind. The public spirit of this gentleman and his liberal views have long been the theme of universal praise; and although I do not enjoy the privilege of his personal acquaintance, I know he must be a gentleman--- the mild and benignant expression of his face---his unassuming habits---his bland and courteous demeanor, all bespeak it; and, to use the language of Queen Elizabeth, are unto him "letters of recommendation throughout the world." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] That gentleman is one of the few Americans who combine a literary taste with indefatigable business habits. Had he devoted his life to letters instead of merchandize, he would have been conspicuous among the most gifted of his countrymen. I heard him deliver an address once, that surprised me by its elegance of style, and literary discrimination. But this is a money-making land; and Mr. ---, like Halleck, Wetmore, Sprague, and others, has found the counting-house more profitable than the muses' temple---his account-book more certain than all books besides---and bank-notes the very best notes in the universe. Young --- is famous for his flute, his dog, and the number of his servants. He never travels without half a dozen. One he dresses in livery, and has him always within calling distance. He plays the German flute with great unction, and with a most determined air, and keeps an enormous dog, of a very peculiar breed, constantly at his heels. He lodges at --- hotel, near the top of the house--- that apartment having been assigned him on account of his musical propensities---he not wishing to be interrupted in his studies, and the landlord desiring to have the neighborhood disturbed as little as possible by his eternal noise. He is the horror of the surrounding country; and complaints have frequently been lodged against him for annoying quiet, well-disposed citizens throughout the day, and keeping them awake during most of the night. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] Wherever he goes he pays double board, as all fluting gentlemen undoubtedly ought to do, and therefore enjoys a kind of privilege to blow away as loud and as often as he thinks proper. His man in livery answers his bell, which is everlastingly going. At the first stroke of the hammer away runs John, and away runs the dog close behind him. It is curious to see these two worthies hurrying up stairs, and the exhibition never fails to create a laugh throughout the building, which, however amusing to the spectators, is a source of the deepest mortification and chagrin to poor John, who is the butt of all his associates in the kitchen on this account. John has long looked upon himself as an injured and most unfortunate man, and once summoned sufficient resolution to remonstrate with his master upon his grievances---telling him, with tears in his eyes, and in a heart-rending manner, that if the dog was not discharged, he should be compelled, however reluctantly, and notwithstanding the high wages, to look out for another situation, as it was quite impossible to say, when the bell rung, which was wanted, the dog or himself. It is entirely out of the question to describe the indignation of Monsieur Flute, on hearing this complaint. At first he turned all the colors of the rainbow---then arose from his seat, eyed his rebellious subject from head to foot, and tried to give vent to his passion in a stream of words; but, finding the effort vain, he promptly kicked him out of the room, and commanded him from his presence forever! John, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] however, is a prudent fellow, and knows the value of a good place and high wages, or, to use his own phrase, "which side his bread is buttered"--- so he concluded to retain his place, in defiance of the laugh and the kicking, and still remains in his former service, and is still followed by that everlasting dog. Now, young --- is a nuisance, and so are his servants, and so are all private servants at public hotels. During meals, they are always in the way. You are liable to mistake them for the regular waiters of the house, and issue your orders accordingly. These they refuse to obey, of course. This is provoking. Then they seize upon all the choice dishes on the table, to convey them to their masters, who sit gormandizing while your plate is empty, and the dinner is getting cold. This is monstrous. Then the man with a servant sometimes gives himself airs towards the man without a servant. This is intolerable. I have heard of two duels on account of private servants, and therefore I repeat, they are a nuisance in a moral point of view, and ought to be abated. There is a knot of politicians---the "great hereafter" and his distinguished colleagues, whom I must not mention, for fear of entering the dreaded arena of politics---near them are descendants of Carroll, Clinton, Tompkins, and other renowned men, "Whose names are with their country's woven;" and the room is filling with beauties, belles and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] beaux of all descriptions. The gentleman in a drab coat, is quite a famous fellow here---a member of the temperance societies---temperate in every thing but water, of which he drinks twenty tumblers every morning before breakfast at the congress spring, and has done so for the last six summers. He is a firm believer in its efficacy---delivers long orations on the subject to any person who will listen to him---pulls every new comer by the button, as soon as he enters the premises, and is known and avoided by the name of the "Water King." That little girl in black, who snaps her fingers at the slender buck in whiskers, has refused six offers of marriage within the last twelve days. She is certainly a bewitching creature, and often puts me in mind of Clara Fisher in the Country Girl. Ah, ha! my little Frenchman! That fellow is a character. I will tell you a story about him. I stopped at West Point, not long since, and found the hotel crowded with visitors. It was late in the evening when I arrived, and being almost worn out with the fatigue of my journey, for I had been the inmate of stages, railroad-cars, and canal-boats, without closing my eyes for the last two days, I repaired, with all convenient haste, to the solitary couch that had been assigned me in the basementstory, in the hope of passing a few comfortable hours in the "arms of Morpheus;" but one glance at the "blue chamber below," convinced me of the utter folly of any such expectation. I found it nearly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] crammed with my fellow-lodgers, who, if I might judge from the melancholy display of hats, boots, socks, and other articles of wearing apparel, scattered over the floor, in most "admired disorder," had evidently retired with unbecoming eagerness to secure their places to themselves, and thereby guard them against the possibility of intrusion from others, doubtless believing, that in this, as well as similar cases, possession is nine points in the law. As the apartment was very confined, and all the inhabitants wide awake, I thought I might as well spend an hour or two in the open air before going to bed, and was about to retire for that purpose, when a voice called, "If you do not wish to lose your berth, you had better turn in." Observing that nearly all the cots, sofas, settees, chairs, etc., were occupied, and hearing that several of my fellow-passengers were sleeping on the house top and in the halls, I deemed it prudent to follow the advice just given to me, so at once commenced disrobing, and was soon stowed away in a snug corner, and it was not long before I found myself gradually and imperceptibly sinking under the power of the gentle god. I began to congratulate myself---to commiserate the unhappy condition of my less fortunate companions, and to bid good night to all my cares, when that short, thin, merry little Frenchman came dancing into the room, and, after cutting a pigeon-wing or two, humming a passage from a favorite opera, and skipping once or twice around the vacant beds, sat himself upon the most commodious, with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] exclamation, "Ah ha! I find him---this is him---number ten, magnifique! Now I shall get some little sleeps at last." Again humming a part of a tune, he proceeded to prepare himself for bed. After divesting himself of his apparel, and carefully depositing his trinkets and watch under his pillow, he fastened a red bandanna handkerchief around his head, and slid beneath the counterpane, as gay and lively as a cricket. "It is superb," he once more exclaimed aloud; "I have not had some rest for six dozen days, certainement \---and now I shall have some little sleeps. But, waiter," bawled he, suddenly recollecting himself. John came at the call. "What is it o'clock, eh?" "Nearly ten, sir." "What time de boat arrive?" "About two." "When he do come, you shall wake me some little minute before?" "Yes, sir." "And you shall get some of de champaign and oysters all ready for my suppare?" "Very well, sir. You may depend upon me, sir," said John, as he shut the door, and made his exit. "Ah, tr es bien , and now for de little sleeps." Uttering which, he threw himself upon the pillow, and, in a few seconds, was in a delightful doze. The foregoing manoeuvres and conversation had attracted the attention of all, and aroused me completely. "D---n that Frenchman," growled a bluff [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] old fellow next him, as he turned on the other side, and went to sleep. Most of the other gentlemen, however, raised their heads for a moment, to see what was going on, and then deposited them as before, in silent resignation. But one individual, with more nerves than fortitude, bounced out of bed, dressed himself in a passion, swore there was no such thing as sleeping there, and went out of the room in a huff. This exploit had an electric effect upon the melancholy spectators, and a general laugh, which awoke all the basement story, was the result. For some minutes afterward the merriment was truly appalling. Jokes, mingled with execrations, were heard in every direction, and the uproar soon became universal. Silence, however, was at length restored; but all symptoms of repose had vanished with the delusion that gave them birth. The poor Frenchman, however, whose slumbers had been sadly broken by the nervous man, had turned himself upside down, and had actually gone to sleep once more! He began to breathe hard, and, finally, to snore---and such a snore!---it was enough to have awakened the dead! There was no such thing as standing that . The equanimity of his immediate neighbour---a drowsy fellow, who, on first lying down, said he was resolved to "sleep in spite of thunder"---was the first to give way. He sprang bolt upright, hastily clapt both hands over his ears, and called out, at the top of his compass, for the Frenchman to discontinue "that diabolical and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] dreadful noise." Up jumped the red nightcap, rubbing its eyes in mute astonishment. After hearing the heavy charge against it, with "a countenance more in sorrow than in anger," and making every apology in its power for the unintentional outrage it had committed, down it sunk once more upon the pillow, and glided away into the land of Nod. But new annoyances awaited my poor Frenchman; for scarcely had this event happened, when the door was flung open, and in came a gentleman from Cahawba, with a fierce-looking broad-brimmed hat upon his pericranium, that attracted general attention, and struck awe and consternation to the hearts of all beholders. He straddled himself into the middle of the floor, thrust both hands into his breeches pocket, pressed his lips firmly together, and cast his eyes deliberately around the apartment, with the expression of one who intended to insist upon his rights. "Which is number ten?" he demanded, in a tone which startled all the tenants of the basement story. "Ah, I perceive!" continued he, approaching the Frenchman, and laying violent hands upon him. "There's some mistake here. A man in my bed, hey? Well, let us see what he's made of. Look here, stranger, you're in the wrong box! You've tumbled into my bed---so you must shift your quarters." Who shall depict the Frenchman's countenance, as he slowly raised his head, half opened his drooping organs of vision and took an oblique squint at the gentleman from Cahawba! "You are in the wrong bed," repeated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] he of the hat---"number ten is my property; yonder is yours, so have the politeness just to hop out." The Frenchman was resigned to his fate, and gathering himself together, transported his mortal remains to the vacant bed, without the slightest resistance, and in eloquent silence. It was very evident to him, as well as the rest of us, that there was no withstanding the persuasions of his new acquaintance, who had a fist like a mallet, and who swore that he always carried loaded pistols in his pocket, to be ready for any emergency. The inhabitants of the basement would have screamed outright this time, but for prudential considerations, for the gentleman from Cahawba realized the description of the "determined dog," mentioned in the comedy, who "lived next door to a churchyard, killed a man a day, and buried his own dead." Was this, then, a man to be trifled with? Certainly not. Better to cram the sheets down your throat, and run the risk of suffocation from suppressed laughter, than to encounter the displeasure of a person who wears such a hat. They are always to be avoided. But to return to the Frenchman. He was no sooner in his new resting-place, than John came to inform him that his champaign and oysters were ready. Like one in a dream he arose, sat upon the side of the bed, and slowly dressed himself, without a single murmur at his great disappointment. He had hardly finished, when the steamboat bell sounded among the highlands, and he received the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] gratifying intelligence, that in consequence of the time he had lost in dressing, he had none left to eat his supper---and that, if he did not hurry, he would be too late for the boat! At this, he arose---yawned--- stretched his person out at full length, and, with the ejaculation---"I shall get some little sleeps nevare"--- bid us good-night, and slowly took his leave. -  August, 1833. Early rising, active exercise, country air, and the congress spring have done, are doing, and will continue to do wonders for invalids. They are all excellent in their way; but to produce a beneficial effect upon weak nerves and debilitated constitutions, they must be enjoyed in moderation. Nothing is more true than that all excess is hurtful; and nothing, one would suppose, is more self-evident: yet many people in delicate health go to Saratoga under the impression, it would seem, that the more water they drink, the faster they will get well.--- Some of the visitors are in the habit of swallowing fifteen, twenty, thirty, and even forty glasses every morning before breakfast! The result of such imprudence can, of course, be easily foreseen. Instead of getting the better of their several complaints, they daily grow worse, and are not unfrequently compelled to abandon the use of the waters altogether, for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] want of proper caution in the first instance. The resident physician at the springs, as every body knows, is an able practitioner, a man of science, and a finished gentleman. We were seated one morning, during the present season, in his study, when an individual knocked at the door, and immediately gained admittance. He was a large, fat, unwieldly piece of humanity from the south, with a face like the full moon just rising, and had the appearance of one "who could kill an ox with his fist, and pick his teeth with its horns." But, alas! appearances are deceitful; my man mountain was sadly out of repair, and could do no such thing. A chronic affection of his stomach embittered all his days, and his doctor had sent him to the springs for relief. Every other remedy had been tried, but to little or no purpose. The waters then were his only reliance, his last resort. If they failed him, his case was hopeless---his disease incurable. Accordingly, on his arrival, he had taken to hard drink, like a brave fellow; but finding, to his unutterable astonishment and confusion, after a whole week's melancholy experience, that the mineral fluids had done him an infinite deal of mischief, and not the least discernible good, he had now repaired to the apartment of the resident physician, entirely out of humor with the waters, himself, and all the world besides, and in utter despair. No wonder, then, that he was angry, or that he should frown indignantly on coming into the presence of the learned professor of the healing art. Placing his cane [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] against the wall, in a firm and decided manner, and tossing his hat upon the table with a peculiar emphasis, he threw himself into a chair with a thundering whack; then taking a blue and white handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped the perspiration from his face, crossed his legs, folded his arms, compressed his lips, and eyed the doctor from head to foot, with mingled feelings of scorn and indignation. "So," said he, at length, "you're a doctor, are you?" "At your service, sir. May I ask who you are?" "Oh, certainly, I am a man that has come six hundred miles, like a blockhead, in compliance with the advice of a quack-doctor, to drink your infernal waters---and they've made me worse--- that's who I am. Now, what do you say to that, hey?" "Why," replied the doctor, with his usual good-nature, and without allowing himself to be disturbed, in the least, by the abrupt deportment of his new acquaintance, "why, my friend, that I am very sorry for it. But what's the matter with you?" "Oh, sir, I'm in pain all over." "Indeed; what are your symptoms?" "I've every symptom you ever heard of." "That's bad." "Bad!" said the man with a stomach, "it's infernal---it's diabolical---it will be the death of me!" "In pain all over, you say?" "Yes, all over, I tell you!" "Any pain in your foot?" "Well, I don't exactly know as to that," said the gentleman from the south, evidently drawing in his horns. "If you had any there, would you not be likely to know it?" pursued the doctor, mildly. "Well, I suppose I should." "Then, you have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf282&image=282-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] no pain in your foot?" "Why, no." "Then, what do you mean by pain all over?" The patient would have explained; but the doctor went on with his professional cross-examination. "And how many tumblers of water do you drink a-day?" "Why, I began moderately. When I first came I only took eight; but I have increased the quantity every day, and, this morning I got down thirty-two." "Thirty-two?" repeated the doctor, coolly, but with evident surprise. "Only thirty-two? Then permit me, my friend, to remark you have not taken---" The man from the south interrupted him---he would hear no more---he thought the doctor was going to tell him he had not taken half enough--- and the idea made him shudder. "Now stop, doctor, stop, I beseech you. That's all very true, what you're going to say. I know it. If I must die, I must; but I can't drink more than thirty-two tumblers, any way under heavens---nor will I attempt it, happen what may." It is unnecessary to give the remainder of the dialogue. The reader has sufficient to show him with what views some people visit the springs, and how little they know of the properties and effects of the waters. This, however, is only one of a thousand similar instances. The invalid in question, for such he really was, notwithstanding his enormous bulk and jolly round physiognomy, was soon convinced of the absolute absurdity of the course he had been pursuing; and, after listening to a little salutary advice, which, we make no doubt, will be of service to him during the [
