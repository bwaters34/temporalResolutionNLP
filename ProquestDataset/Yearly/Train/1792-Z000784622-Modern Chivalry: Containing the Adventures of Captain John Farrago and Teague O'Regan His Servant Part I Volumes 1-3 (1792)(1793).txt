Some have thought of Dictionaries, others of In[s]titutes, for that purpo[s]e. Swift, I think it was, who proposed, in his letters to the Earl of Oxford, the forming an academy of learned men, in order by their ob[s]ervations and rules, to [s]ettle the true [s]pelling, accentuation, and pronunciation, as well as the proper words, and the pure[s]t, mo[s]t [s]imple, and perfect phra[s]eology of language. It has always appeared to me, that if [s]ome great ma[s]ter of [s]tile [s]hould ari[s]e, and without regarding [s]entiment, or [s]ubject, give an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] example of good language in his composition, which might [s]erve as a model to future [s]peakers and writers, it would do more to fix the orthography, choice of words, idiom of phra[s]e, and [s]tructure of [s]entence, than all the Dictionaries and Institutes that have been ever made. For certainly, it is much more conducive to this end, to place before the eyes what is good writing, than to [s]ugge[s]t it to the ear, which may forget in a [s]hort time all that has been [s]aid. It is for this rea[s]on, that I have undertaken this work; and that it may attain the end the more perfectly, I [s]hall consider language only, not in the lea[s]t regarding the matter of the work; but as musicians, when they are about to give the mo[s]t excellent melody, pay no attention to the words that are [s]et to mu[s]ic; but take the mo[s]t unmeaning phra[s]es, [s]uch as [s]ol, fa, la; [s]o here, culing out the choice[s]t [s]lowers of diction, I [s]hall pay no regard to the idea; for it is not in the power of human ingenuity to attain two things perfectly at once. Thus we [s]ee that they mistake greatly, who think to have a clock that can at once tell the hour of the day, the age of the moon, and the day of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] week, month, or year; becau[s]e the complexness of the machine hinders that perfection which the [s]implicity of the works and movements can alone give. For it is not in nature to have all things in one. If you are about to chu[s]e a wife, and expect beauty, you mu[s]t give up family and fortune; or if you attain the[s]e, you mu[s]t at lea[s]t want good temper, health, or [s]ome other advantage: [s]o to expect good language and good [s]en[s]e, at the [s]ame time, is ab[s]urd, and not in in the compa[s]s of common nature to produce. Attempting only one thing, therefore, we may entertain the idea of hitting the point of perfection. It has been owing to an inattention to this principle, that [s]o many fail in their attempts at good writing. A Jack of all Trades, is proverbial of a bungler; and we [s]carcely ever find any one who excels in two parts of the [s]ame art; much le[s]s in two arts at the [s]ame time. The [s]mooth poet wants [s]trength; and the orator of a good voice, is de[s]titute of logical rea[s]on and argument. How many have I heard [s]peak, who, were they to attempt voice only, might be re[s]pectable; but undertaking, at the [s]ame time, to carry [s]en[s]e along with them, they utterly fail, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] become contemptible. One thing at once, is the be[s]t maxim that ever came into the mind of man. This might be illu[s]trated by a thou[s]and examples; but I [s]hall not trouble my[s]elf with any; as it is not [s]o much my object to convince others as to [s]hew the motives by which I my[s]elf am governed. Indeed, I could give authority which is [s]uperior to all examples; viz. that of the poet Horace; who, speaking on this very [s]ubject of excellence in writing, [s]ays, Quidvis, that is, whatever you compo[s]e, let it be, [s]implex duntaxit & unum: that is, [s]imple, and one thing only. It will be needle[s]s for me to [s]ay any thing about the critics; for as this work is intended as a model or rule of good writing, it cannot be the [s]ubject of criticism. It is true, Homer has been criticised by a Zoilus and an Ari[s]totle; but the one contented him[s]elf with pointing out defects; the other, beauties. But Zoilus has been cen[s]ured, Ari[s]totle praised; becau[s]e in a model there can be no defect; error con[s]i[s]ting in a deviation from the truth, and faults, in an aberration from the original of beauty; [s]o that where there are no faults there can be no food for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] critici[s]m, taken in the unfavourable [s]en[s]e of finding fault with the productions of an author. I have no objections, therefore, to any prai[s]e that may be given to this work; but to cen[s]ure or blame mu[s]t appear ab[s]urd; becau[s]e it cannot be doubted but that it will perfectly an[s]wer the end propo[s]ed. Being a book without thought, or the [s]malle[s]t degree of [s]en[s]e, it will be u[s]eful to young minds, not fatiguing their understandings, and ea[s]ily introducing a love of reading and [s]tudy. Acquiring language at fir[s]t by this means, they will afterwards gain knowledge. It will be u[s]eful especially to young men of light minds intended for the bar or pulpit. By heaping too much upon them, [s]tile and matter at once, you [s]urfeit the [s]tomach, and turn away the appetite from literary entertainment, to hor[s]e-racing and cock-fighting. I [s]hall con[s]ider my[s]elf, therefore, as having performed an acceptable [s]ervice to all weak and vi[s]ionary people, if I can give them [s]omething to read without the trouble of thinking. But the[s]e are collataral advantages of my work, the great object of which is, as I have [s]aid before, to give a model of perfect [s]tile in writing. If hereafter any [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] author of [s]upereminent abilities, [s]hould chu[s]e to give this [s]tile a body, and make it the covering to [s]ome work of [s]en[s]e, as you would wrap fine [s]ilk round a beautiful form, [s]o that there may be, not only ve[s]tment, but life in the object, I have no objections; but [s]hall be rather [s]atisfied with having it put to [s]o good a u[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] JOHN FARRAGO, was a man of about fifty-three years of age, of good natural [s]en[s]e, and con[s]iderable reading; but in [s]ome things whim[s]ical, owing perhaps to his greater knowledge of books than of the world; but, in [s]ome degree, al[s]o, to his having never married, being what they call an old batchelor, a characteri[s]tic of which is, u[s]ually, [s]ingularity and whim. He had the advantage of having had in early life, an academic education; but having never applied him[s]elf to any of the learned professions, he had lived the greater part of his life on a [s]mall farm, which he cultivated with [s]ervants or hired hands, as he could conveniently [s]upply him[s]elf with either. The [s]ervant that he had at this time, was an Iri[s]hman, who[s]e name was Teague Oregan. I [s]hall [s]ay nothing of the character of this man, becau[s]e the very name imports what he was. A [s]trange idea came into the head of Captain Farrago about this time; for, by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] the bye, I had forgot to mention that having being cho[s]en captain of a company of militia in the neighbourhood, he had gone by the name of Captain ever [s]ince; for the rule is, once a captain, and always a captain; but, as I was ob[s]erving, the idea had come into his head, to [s]addle an old hor[s]e that he had, and ride about the world a little, with his man Teague at his heels, to [s]ee how things were going on here and there, and to ob[s]erve human nature. For it is a mi[s]take to [s]uppo[s]e, that a man cannot learn man by reading him in a corner, as well as on the wide[s]t [s]pace of transaction. At any rate, it may yield amusement. It was about a [s]core of miles from his own hou[s]e, that he fell in with what we call Races. The jockeys [s]eeing him advance, with Teague by his [s]ide, whom they took for his groom, conceived him to be [s]ome per[s]on who had brought his hor[s]e to enter for the pur[s]e. Coming up and acco[s]ting him, [s]aid they, You [s]eem to be for the races, Sir; and have a hor[s]e to enter. Not at all, [s]aid the captain; this is but a common palfrey, and by no means remarkable for [s]peed or bottom; he is a common plough hor[s]e which I have u[s]ed on my farm [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] for [s]everal years, and can [s]carce go beyond a trot; much le[s]s match him[s]elf with your blooded hor[s]es that are going to take the field on this occa[s]ion. The jockeys were of opinion, from the [s]peech, that the hor[s]e was what they call a bite, and that under the appearance of leanness and [s]tiffne[s]s, there was concealed [s]ome hidden quality of [s]wiftne[s]s uncommon. For they had heard of in[s]tances, where the mo[s]t knowing had been taken in by mean looking hor[s]es; [s]o that having laid two, or more, to one, they were nevertheless bit by the bet; and the mean looking nags, proved to be hor[s]es of a more than common [s]peed and bottom. So that there is no tru[s]ting appearances. Such was the rea[s]oning of the jockeys. For they could have no idea, that a man could come there in [s]o [s]ingular a manner, with a groom at his foot, unle[s]s he had [s]ome great object of making money by the adventure. Under this idea, they began to interrogate him with re[s]pect to the blood and pedigree of his hor[s]e: whether he was of the dove, or the bay mare that took the pur[s]e; and was imported by [s]uch a one at [s]uch a time? whether his [s]ire was Tamerlane or Bajazet? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] The Captain was irritated at the questions, and could not avoid an[s]wering.--- Gentlemen, [s]aid he, it is a [s]trange thing that you [s]hould [s]uppo[s]e that it is of any con[s]equence what may be the pedigree of a hor[s]e. For even in men it is of no avail. Do we not find that [s]ages have had blockheads for their [s]ons; and that blockheads have had [s]ages? It is remarkable, that as e[s]tates have [s]eldom la[s]ted three generations, [s]o under[s]tanding and ability have [s]eldom been tran[s]mitted to the [s]econd. There never was a greater man, take him as an orator and philo[s]opher, than Cicero: and never was there a per[s]on who had greater opportunities than his [s]on Marcus; and yet he proved of no account or reputation. This is an old in[s]tance, but there are a thou[s]and others. Che[s]terfield and his [s]on are mentioned. It is true, Philip and Alexander may be [s]aid to be exceptions: Philip of the [s]tronge[s]t possible mind; capable of almo[s]t every thing we can conceive; the deepe[s]t policy and the mo[s]t determined valour; his [s]on Alexander not deficient in the fir[s]t, and before him in the la[s]t; if it is po[s][s]ible to be before a man than whom you can [s]uppo[s]e nothing greater. It is po[s][s]ible, in modern [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] times, that Tippo Saib may be equal to his father Hyder Ali. Some talk of the two Pitts. I have no idea that the [s]on is, in any re[s]pect, equal to old Sir William. The one is a laboured artificial mini[s]ter: the other [s]poke with the thunder, and acted with the lightning of the gods. I will venture to [s]ay, that when the pre[s]ent John Adam[s]es, and Lees, and Jeffer[s]ons, and Jays, and Henrys, and other great men, who figure upon the [s]tage at this time, have gone to [s]leep with their fathers, it is an hundred to one if there is any of their de[s]cendents who can fill their places. Was I to lay a bet for a great man, I would [s]ooner pick up the brat of a tinker, than go into the great hou[s]es to chu[s]e a piece of [s]tuff for a man of genius. Even with re[s]pect to per[s]onal appearance, which is more in the power of natural production, we do not [s]ee that beauty always produces beauty; but on the contrary, the homlie[s]t per[s]ons have oftentimes the be[s]t favoured offspring; [s]o that there is no rule or rea[s]on in the[s]e things. With re[s]pect to this hor[s]e, therefore, it can be of no moment whether he is blooded or [s]tuded, or what he is. He is a good old hor[s]e, u[s]ed to the plough, and carries my weight very well; and I have never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] yet made enquiry with re[s]pect to his ancestors, or affronted him [s]o much as to ca[s]t up to him the defect of parentage. I bought him [s]ome years ago from Niel Thomas, who had him from a colt. As far as I can under[s]tand, he was of a brown mare that John M`Neis had; but of what hor[s]e I know no more than the hor[s]e himself. His gaits are good enough, as to riding a [s]hort journey of [s]even or eight miles, or the like; but he is rather a pacer than a troter; and though his bottom may be good enough in carrying a bag to the mill, or going in the plough, or the [s]led, or the harrow, & c. yet his wind is not [s]o good, nor his [s]peed, as to be fit for the heats. The jockeys thought the man a fool, and gave them[s]elves no more trouble about him. The hor[s]es were now entered, and about to [s]tart for the pur[s]e. There was Black and all Black, and Snip, John Duncan's Barbary Slim, and [s]everal others. The riders had been weighed, and when mounted, the word was given. It is needle[s]s to de[s]cribe a race; every body knows the circum[s]tances of it. It is [s]ufficient to [s]ay, that from the bets that were laid, there was much anxiety, and [s]ome pa[s][s]ion in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] the minds of tho[s]e concerned: So, that as two of the hor[s]es, Black and all Black, and Slim, came out near together; there was di[s]pute and confu[s]ion. It came to kicking and cuffing in [s]ome places. The Captain was a good deal hurt with [s]uch indecency among[s]t gentlemen, and advancing, addre[s][s]ed them in the following manner: Gentleman, this is an unequal and unfair proceeding. It is unbecoming modern manners, or even the ancient. For at the Olympic games of Greece, where were celebrated hor[s]e and chariot races, there was no [s]uch hurry [s]curry as this; and in times of chivalry it[s]elf, where men ate, drank, and [s]lept on hor[s]e-back, though there was a great deal of pell-meling, yet no [s]uch di[s]orderly work as this. If men had a difference, they couched their lances, and ran full tilt at one another; but no [s]uch indecent expre[s][s]ions, as villain, scoundrel, liar, ever came out of their mouths. There was the mo[s]t perfect courte[s]y in tho[s]e days of heroi[s]m and honour; and this your hor[s]e-racing, which is a germ of the amu[s]ement of tho[s]e times, ought to be conducted on the [s]ame principles of decorum, and good breeding. As he was [s]peaking, he was jo[s]tled by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] [s]ome one in the croud, and thrown from his hor[s]e; and had it not been for Teague, who was at hand, and helped him on again, he would have [s]uffered damage. As it was, he received a contu[s]ion in his head, of which he complained much; and having left the race-ground, and coming to a [s]mall cottage, he [s]topped a little, to alight and dre[s]s the wound. An old woman who was there, thought they ought to take a little of his water, and [s]ee how it was with him; but the Captain having no faith in telling di[s]orders by the urine, thought proper to [s]end for a [s]urgeon who was hard by, to examine the brui[s]e, and apply bandages. The [s]urgeon attended, and examining the part, pronounced it a contu[s]ion of the cerebrum. But as there appeared but little laceration, and no fracture, simple or compound, the pia mater could not be injured; nor even could there be more than a [s]light impre[s][s]ion on the dura mater. So that trepaning did not at all appear necessary. A mo[s]t fortunate circum[s]tance; for a wound in the head, is of all places the mo[s]t dangerous; becau[s]e there can be no amputation to [s]ave life. There being but one head to a man, and that being the residence of the five [s]en[s]es, it is impo[s][s]ible [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] to live without it. Neverthele[s]s, as the pre[s]ent ca[s]e was highly dangerous, as it might lead to a [s]ub[s]ultus tendinum, or lock-jaw, it was nece[s][s]ary to apply cataplasms, in order to reduce inflammation, and bring about a [s]anative di[s]po[s]ition of the parts. Perhaps it might not be ami[s]s, to take an anodyne as a refrigerant. Many patients had been lo[s]t by the ignorance of empirics pre[s]cribing bracers; whereas, in the fir[s]t [s]tage of a contu[s]ion, relaxing and antifebrile medicines are proper. A little phlebotomy was no doubt nece[s][s]ary, to prevent the bur[s]ting of the blood ve[s][s]els. The Captain hearing [s]o many hard words, and bad accounts of this ca[s]e, was much alarmed. Neverthele[s]s he did not think it could be ab[s]olutely [s]o dangerous. For it [s]eemed to him that he was not [s]ick at heart, or under any mortal pain. The [s]urgeon ob[s]erved, that in this ca[s]e he could not him[s]elf be a judge. For the very part was affected by which he was to judge, viz. the head; that it was no uncommon thing for men in the extreme[s]t ca[s]es to imagine them[s]elves out of danger; whereas in reality, they were in the greate[s]t po[s][s]ible: that notwith[s]tanding the [s]ymptoms were mild, yet from the contu[s]ion, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] mortification might en[s]ue. Hypocrates, who might be [s]tiled an elementary phy[s]ician, and has a treati[s]e on this very [s]ubject, is of opinion, that the mo[s]t dangerous [s]ymptom, is a topical in[s]en[s]ibility; but among the moderns, Sydenham con[s]iders it in another point of view, and thinks that where there is no pain, there is as great rea[s]on to [s]uppo[s]e that there is no hurt, as that there is a mortal one. Be this as it may, anti[s]eptic medicines might be very proper. The Captain hearing [s]o much jargon, and con[s]cious to him[s]elf that he was by no means in [s]o bad a [s]tate as this [s]on of E[s]calapius would repre[s]ent, broke out into [s]ome pa[s][s]ion. It is, [s]aid he, the craft of your profe[s][s]ion to make the ca[s]e wor[s]e than it is, in order to increa[s]e the perqui[s]ites. But if there is any faith in you, make the [s]ame demand, and let me know your real judgment. The [s]urgeon was irritated with his di[s]tru[s]t, and took it into his head to fix [s]ome apprehen[s]ion in the mind of his patient, if po[s][s]ible, that his ca[s]e was not without danger. Looking [s]tedfa[s]tly at him for [s]ome time, and feeling his pul[s]e, there is, [s]aid he, an evident delirium approaching. This argues an affection of the brain, but it will be nece[s][s]ary, after [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] [s]ome [s]oporiferous draughts, to put the patient to [s]leep. Said the Captain, If you will give me about a pint of whi[s]key and water, I will try to go to [s]leep my[s]elf. Adeleterious mixture, in this ca[s]e, [s]aid the [s]urgeon, cannot be proper; e[s]pecially a di[s]tillation of that quality. The Captain would hear no more; but reque[s]ting the man of the cabin, to let him have the [s]pirits propo[s]ed, drank a pint or two of grog, and having bound up his head with a handkerchief, went to bed. Containing [s]ome general Reflections.

Because, as an old lean bea[s]t, attempting a trot he was re[s]pectable enough; but going out of his nature, and affecting [s]peed, he would have been contemptible. The great [s]ecret of pre[s]erving re[s]pect, is the cultivating and [s]hewing to the be[s]t advantage the powers that we po[s][s]e[s]s, and the not going beyond them. Every thing in its element is good, and in their proper [s]phere all natures and capacities are excellent. This thought might be turned into a thou[s]and different [s]hapes, and cloathed with various expre[s][s]ions; but after all, it comes to the old proverb at la[s]t, Ne [s]utor ultra crepidam, Let the cobler [s]tick to his la[s]t; a [s]entiment we are about more to illu[s]trate in the [s]equel of this work. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] The [s]econd reflection that ari[s]es, is, the [s]implicity of the Captain; who was [s]o unacquainted with the world, as to imagine that jockeys and men of the turf could be composed by rea[s]on and good [s]en[s]e; whereas there are no people who are by education of a le[s]s philo[s]ophic turn of mind. The company of hor[s]es is by no means favourable to good ta[s]te and genius. The rubbing and currying them, but little enlarges the faculties, or improves the mind; and even riding, by which a man is carried [s]wiftly through the air, though it contributes to health, yet [s]tores the mind with few or no ideas; and as men naturally con[s]imilate with their company, [s]o it is ob[s]ervable that your jockeys are a cla[s]s of people not greatly removed from the [s]agacity of a good hor[s]e. Hence mo[s]t probably the fable of the centaur, among the ancients; by which they held out the moral of the jockey and the hor[s]e being one bea[s]t. A third reflection is, that which he expre[s]t; viz. the profe[s][s]ional art of the surgeon to make the mo[s]t of the ca[s]e, and the technical terms u[s]ed by him. I have to declare, that it is with no attempt at wit, that the terms are [s]et down, or the art of the [s]urgeon hinted at; becau[s]e it is [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] common place a thing to ridicule the peculiarities of a profe[s][s]ion, that it [s]avours of mean parts to indulge it. For a man of real genius will never walk in the beaten track, becau[s]e his object is what is new and uncommon. This [s]urgeon does not appear to have been a man of very great ability; but the Captain was certainly wrong in declining his pre[s]criptions; for the maxim is, Unicuique in arte, [s]ua perito, credendum e[s]t; every one is to be tru[s]ted in his profe[s][s]ion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] THE Captain ri[s]ing early next morning, and [s]etting out on his way, had now arrived at a place where a number of people were convened, for the purpo[s]e of electing per[s]ons to repre[s]ent them in the legi[s]lature of the [s]tate. There was a weaver who was a candidate for this appointment, and [s]eemed to have a good deal of intere[s]t among the people. But another, who was a man of education, was his competitor. Relying on [s]ome talent of speaking which he thought he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, he addressed the multitude. Said he, Fellow citizens, I pretend not to any great abilities; but am con[s]cious to my[s]elf that I have the be[s]t good will to [s]erve you. But it is very a[s]toni[s]hing to me, that this weaver [s]hould conceive himself qualified for the tru[s]t. For though my acquirements are not great, yet his are [s]till le[s]s. The mechanical bu[s]ine[s]s which he pur[s]ues, mu[s]t nece[s][s]arily take up [s]o much of his time, that he cannot apply him[s]elf [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] to political [s]tudies. I [s]hould therefore think it would be more an[s]werable to your dignity, and conducive to your intere[s]t, to be repre[s]ented by a man at lea[s]t of [s]ome letters, than by an illiterate handicraftsman like this. It will be more honourable for him[s]elf, to remain at his loom and knot threads, than to come forward in a legi[s]lative capacity: becau[s]e, in the one ca[s]e, he is in the [s]phere where God and nature has placed him; in the other, he is like a fi[s]h out of water, and mu[s]t [s]truggle for breath in a new element. Is it po[s][s]ible he can under[s]tand the affairs of government, who[s]e mind has been concentered to the [s]mall object of weaving webs; to the price by the yard, the gri[s]t of the thread, and [s]uch like matters as concern a manufacturer of cloths? The feet of him who weaves, are more occupied than the head, or at lea[s]t as much; and therefore the whole man mu[s]t be, at lea[s]t, but in half accu[s]tomed to exerci[s]e his mental powers. For the[s]e rea[s]ons, all other things [s]et a[s]ide, the chance is in my favour, with re[s]pect to information. However, you will decide, and give your suffrages to him or to me, as you [s]hall judge expedient. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] The Captain hearing the[s]e ob[s]ervations, and looking at the weaver, could not help advancing, and undertaking to [s]ubjoin [s]omething in [s]upport of what had been ju[s]t [s]aid. Said he, I have no prejudice again[s]t a weaver more than another man. Nor do I know any harm in the trade; [s]ave that from the [s]edentary life in a damp place, there is u[s]ually a palene[s]s of the countenance: but this is a phy[s]ical, not a moral evil. Such u[s]ually occupy [s]ubterranean apartments; not for the purpo[s]e, like Demo[s]thenes, of [s]having their heads, and writing over eight times the hi[s]tory of Thucydides, and perfecting a [s]tile of oratory; but rather to keep the thread moi[s]t; or becau[s]e this is con[s]idered but as an inglorious [s]ort of trade, and is frequently thru[s]t away into cellars, and damp outhouses, which are not occupied for a better u[s]e. But to ri[s]e from the cellar to the [s]enate hou[s]e, would be an unnatural hoi[s]t. To come from counting threads, and adjusting them to the [s]plits of a reed, to regulate the finances of a government, would be prepo[s]terous; there being no congruity in the ca[s]e. There is no analogy between knotting threads and framing laws. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] It would be a rever[s]ion of the order of things. Not that a manufacturer of linen or woolen, or other [s]tuff, is an inferior character, but a different one, from that which ought to be employed in affairs of [s]tate. It is unnece[s][s]ary to enlarge on this [s]ubject; for you mu[s]t all be convinced of the truth and propriety of what I [s]ay. But if you will give me leave to take the manufacturer a[s]ide a little, I think I can explain to him my ideas on the [s]ubject; and very probably prevail with him to withdraw his preten[s]ions. The people [s]eeming to acquie[s]ce, and beckoning to the weaver, they drew a[s]ide, and the Captain addressed him in the following words: Mr. Traddle, [s]aid he, for that was the name of the manufacturer, I have not the [s]malle[s]t idea of wounding your [s]en[s]ibility; but it would [s]eem to me, it would be more your intere[s]t to pur[s]ue your occupation, than to launch out into that of which you have no knowledge. When you go to the [s]enate hou[s]e, the application to you will not be to warp a web; but to make laws for the commonwealth. Now, suppose that the making the[s]e laws, requires a knowledge of commerce, or of the interests of agriculture, or tho[s]e principles [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] upon which the different manufactures depend, what [s]ervice could you render. It is po[s][s]ible you might think ju[s]tly enough; but could you [s]peak? You are not in the habit of public [s]peaking. You are not furni[s]hed with tho[s]e common place ideas, with which even very ignorant men can pa[s]s for knowing [s]omething. There is nothing makes a man [s]o ridiculous as to attempt what is above his [s]phere. You are no tumbler for in[s]tance; yet [s]hould you give out that you could vault upon a man's back; or turn head over heels, like the wheel of a cart; the [s]tiffne[s]s of your joints would encumber you; and you would fall upon your back[s]ide to the ground. Such a [s]qua[s]h as that would do you damage. The getting up to ride on the [s]tate is an un[s]afe thing to tho[s]e who are not accu[s]tomed to [s]uch hor[s]eman[s]hip. It is a di[s]agreeable thing for a man to be laughed at, and there is no way of keeping ones [s]elf from it but by avoiding all affectation. While they were thus di[s]cour[s]ing, a bu[s]tle had taken place among the croud. Teague hearing [s]o much about elections, and [s]erving the government, took it into his head, that he could be a legi[s]lator [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] himself. The thing was not di[s]plea[s]ing to the people, who [s]eemed to favour his pretensions; owing, in [s]ome degree, to there being [s]everal of his countrymen among the croud; but more e[s]pecially to the fluctuation of the popular mind, and a disposition to what is new and ignoble. For though the weaver was not the mo[s]t elevated object of choice, yet he was [s]till preferable to this tatter-demalion, who was but a menial [s]ervant, and had [s]o much of what is called the brogue on his tongue, as to fall far [s]hort of an elegant [s]peaker. The Captain coming up, and finding what was on the carpet, was greatly chagrined at not having been able to give the multitude a better idea of the importance of a legi[s]lative tru[s]t; alarmed al[s]o, from an apprehen[s]ion of the lo[s]s of his [s]ervant. Under the[s]e impre[s][s]ions he re[s]umed his addre[s]s to the multitude. Said he, This is making the matter [s]till wor[s]e, gentlemen: this [s]ervant of mine is but a bog-trotter; who can [s]carcely [s]peak the dialect in which your laws ought to be written; but certainly has never read a [s]ingle treati[s]e on any political [s]ubject; for the truth is, he cannot read at all. The young people of the lower cla[s]s, in Ireland, have [s]eldom [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] the advantage of a good education; especially the de[s]cendants of the ancient Iri[s]h, who have mo[s]t of them a great a[s][s]urance of countenance, but little information, or literature. This young man, who[s]e family name is Oregan, has been my servant for [s]everal years. And, except a too great fondne[s]s for women, which now and then brings him into [s]crapes, he has demeaned him[s]elf in a manner tolerable enough. But he is totally ignorant of the great principles of legi[s]lation; and more e[s]pecially, the particular intere[s]ts of the government. A free government is a noble po[s][s]e[s][s]ion to a people: and this freedom con[s]i[s]ts in an equal right to make laws, and to have the benefit of the laws when made. Though doubtle[s]s, in [s]uch a government, the lowe[s]t citizen may become chief magi[s]trate; yet it is [s]ufficient to po[s][s]e[s]s the right; not ab[s]olutely necessary to exerci[s]e it. Or even if you [s]hould think proper, now and then, to [s]hew your privilege, and exert, in a [s]ignal manner, the democratic prerogative, yet is it not de[s]cending too low to filch away from me a hireling, which I cannot well [s]pare, to [s]erve your purpo[s]es? You are [s]urely carrying the matter too far, in thinking to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] make a [s]enator of this ho[s]tler; to take him away from an employment to which he has been bred, and put him to another, to which he has [s]erved no apprentice[s]hip: to [s]et tho[s]e hands which have been lately employed in currying my hor[s]e, to the draughting-bills, and preparing bu[s]ine[s]s for the hou[s]e. The people were tenacious of their choice, and in[s]i[s]ted on giving Teague their [s]uffrages; and by the frown upon their brows, [s]eemed to indicate re[s]entment at what had been [s]aid; as indirectly charging them with want of judgment; or calling in que[s]tion their privilege to do what they thought proper. It is a very [s]trange thing, [s]aid one of them, who was a speaker for the re[s]t, that after having conquered Burgoyne and Cornwallis, and got a government of our own, we cannot put in it whom we plea[s]e. This young man may be your [s]ervant, or another man's [s]ervant; but if we chu[s]e to make him a delegate, what is that to you. He may not be yet [s]killed in the matter, but there is a good day a-coming. We will impower him; and it is better to tru[s]t a plain man like him, than one of your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] high flyers, that will make laws to [s]uit their own purpo[s]es. Said the Captain, I had much rather you would [s]end the weaver, though I thought that improper, than to invade my hou[s]ehold, and thus detract from me the very per[s]on that I have about me to bru[s]h my boots, and clean my [s]purs. The prolocutor of the people gave him to under[s]tand that his [s]urmi[s]es were u[s]ele[s]s, for the people had determined on the choice, and Teague they would have for a repre[s]entative. Finding it an[s]wered no end to expostulate with the multitude, he reque[s]ted to [s]peak a word with Teague by him[s]elf. Stepping a[s]ide, he [s]aid to him, compo[s]ing his voice, and addre[s][s]ing him in a [s]oft manner; Teague, you are quite wrong in this matter they have put into your head. Do you know what it is to be a member of a deliberative body? What qualifications are nece[s][s]ary? Do you under[s]tand any thing of geography? If a que[s]tion [s]hould be, to make a law to dig a canal in [s]ome part of the [s]tate, can you de[s]cribe the bearing of the mountains, and the cour[s]e of the rivers? Or if commerce is to be pu[s]hed to [s]ome new quarter, by the force of regulations, are you competent to decide in [s]uch a ca[s]e? There [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] will be que[s]tions of law, and a[s]tronomy on the carpet. How you mu[s]t gape and [s]tare like a fool, when you come to be a[s]ked your opinion on the[s]e [s]ubjects? Are you acquainted with the ab[s]tract principles of finance; with the funding public securities; the ways and means of rai[s]ing the revenue; providing for the di[s]charge of the public debts, and all other things which re[s]pect the economy of the government? Even if you had knowledge, have you a facility of [s]peaking. I would [s]uppo[s]e you would have too much pride to go to the hou[s]e ju[s]t to [s]ay, Ay, or No. This is not the fault of your nature, but of your education; having been accu[s]tomed to dig turf in your early years, rather than instructing your[s]elf in the cla[s][s]ics, or common [s]chool books. When a man becomes a member of a public body, he is like a racoon, or other bea[s]t that climbs up the fork of a tree; the boys pu[s]hing at him with pitch-forks, or throwing [s]tones, or [s]hooting at him with an arrow, the dogs barking in the mean time. One will find fault with your not [s]peaking; another with your [s]peaking, if you [s]peak at all. They will have you in the news papers, and ridicule you as a perfect bea[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] There is what they call the caricatura; that is, repre[s]enting you with a dog's head, or a cat's claw. As you have a red head, they will very probably make a fox of you, or a [s]orrel hor[s]e, or a brindled cow, or the like. It is the devil in hell to be exposed to the [s]quibs and crackers of the gazette wits and publications. You know no more about the[s]e matters than a goo[s]e; and yet you would undertake ra[s]hly, without advice, to enter on the office; nay, contrary to advice. For I would not for a thou[s]and guineas, though I have not the half of it to [s]pare, that the breed of the Oregans [s]hould come to this; bringing on them a wor[s]e [s]tain than [s]tealing [s]heep; to which they are addicted. You have nothing but your character, Teague, in a new country to depend upon. Let it never be [s]aid, that you quitted an hone[s]t livelihood, the taking care of my hor[s]e, to follow the new fangled whims of the times, and to be a [s]tate[s]man. Teague was moved chiefly with the la[s]t part of the addre[s]s, and con[s]ented to give up the object. The Captain, glad of this, took him back to the people, and announced his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] di[s]po[s]ition to decline the honour which they had intended him. Teague acknowledged that he had changed his mind, and was willing to remain in a private [s]tation. The people did not [s]eem well plea[s]ed with the Captain; but as nothing more could be [s]aid about the matter, they turned their attention to the weaver, and gave him their [s]uffrages. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] CAPTAIN FARRAGO leaving this place, proceeded on his way; and at the di[s]tance of a mile or two, met a man with a bridle in his hand; who had lo[s]t a hor[s]e, and had been at a conjurer's to make enquiry, and recover his property. It [s]truck the mind of the Captain to go to this conjuring per[s]on, and make a demand of him, what was the cau[s]e that the multitude were [s]o di[s]po[s]ed to elevate the low to the highe[s]t [s]tation. He had rode but about a mile, when the habitation of the conjurer, by the direction and description of the man who had lo[s]t the hor[s]e had given, began to be in view. Coming up to the door, and enquiring if that was not where conjurer Kolt lived, they were answered Yes. Accordingly alighting, and entering the domicile, all tho[s]e things took place which u[s]ually happen, or are described in ca[s]es of this nature, viz. there was the conjurer's a[s][s]i[s]tant, who gave the Captain to under[s]tand that ma[s]ter had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] withdrawn a little, but would be in shortly. In the mean time, the a[s][s]i[s]tant endeavoured to draw from him [s]ome account of the occa[s]ion of his journey; which the other readily communicated; and the conjurer, who was li[s]tening through a crack in the partition, overheard. Finding it was not a hor[s]e or a cow, or a piece of linen that was lo[s]t, but an ab[s]tract que[s]tion of political philo[s]ophy which was to be put, he came from his lurking place, and entered, as if not knowing that any per[s]on had been waiting for him. After mutual [s]alutations, the Captain gave him to under[s]tand the object which he had in view by calling on him. Said the conjurer, This lies not at all in my way. If it had been a dozen of [s]poons, or a [s]tolen watch, that you had to look for, I could very readily, by the a[s][s]i[s]tance of my art, have a[s][s]i[s]ted you in the recovery; but as to this matter of men's imaginations and attachments in political affairs, I have no more under[s]tanding than another man. It is very [s]trange, [s]aid the Captain, that you who can tell by what means a thing is [s]tolen, and the place where it is depo[s]ited, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] though at a thou[s]and miles di[s]tance, [s]hould know [s]o little of what is going on in the brea[s]t of man, as not to be able to develope his [s]ecret thoughts, and the motives of his actions. It is not of our bu[s]ine[s]s, [s]aid the other; but [s]hould we undertake it, I do not [s]ee that it would be very difficult to explain all that puzzles you at pre[s]ent. There is no need of a conjurer to tell why it is that the common people are more di[s]po[s]ed to tru[s]t one of their own cla[s]s, than tho[s]e who may affect to be [s]uperior. Be[s]ides, there is a certain pride in man, which leads him to elevate the low, and pull down the high. There is a kind of creating power exerted in making a [s]enator of an unqualified per[s]on; which when the author has done, he exults over the work, and, like the Creator him[s]elf when he made the world, [s]ees that "it is very good." Moreover, there is in every government a patrician cla[s]s, again[s]t whom the [s]pirit of the multitude naturally militates: And hence a perpetual war; the ari[s]tocrats endeavouring to detrude the people, and the people contending to obtrude them[s]elves. And it is right it [s]hould be [s]o; for by this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] fermentation, the [s]pirit of democracy is kept alive. The Captain, thanking him for his information, a[s]ked him what was to pay; at the [s]ame time pulling out half a crown from a green [s]ilk pur[s]e which he had in his breeches pocket. The conjurer gave him to under[s]tand, that as the [s]olution of the[s]e difficulties was not within his province, he took nothing for it. The Captain expre[s][s]ing his [s]en[s]e of his di[s]intere[s]ted [s]ervice, bade him adieu. Containing Reflections. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] A Democracy is beyond all que[s]tion the free[s]t government: becau[s]e under this, every man is equally protected by the laws, and has equally a voice in making them. But I do not [s]ay an equal voice; becau[s]e [s]ome men have [s]tronger lungs than others, and can expre[s]s more forcibly their opinions of public affairs. Others, though they may not [s]peak very loud, yet have a faculty of [s]aying more in a [s]hort time; and even in the ca[s]e of others, who [s]peak little or none at all, yet what they do [s]ay containing good [s]en[s]e, comes with greater weight; [s]o that all things considered, every citizen, has not, in this [s]en[s]e of the word, an equal voice. But the right being equal, what great harm if it is unequally exerci[s]ed? is it nece[s][s]ary that every man [s]hould become a [s]tate[s]man? No more than that every man [s]hould become a poet or a painter. The [s]ciences, are open to all; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] but let him only who has ta[s]te and genius pur[s]ue them. If any man covets the office of a bi[s]hop, [s]ays St. Paul, he covets a good work. But again, he adds this caution, Ordain not a novice, le[s]t being lifted up with pride, he falls into the condemnation of the devil. It is indeed making a devil of a man to lift him up to a [s]tate to which he is not [s]uited. A ditcher is a re[s]pectable character, with his over-alls on, and a [s]pade in his hand; but put the [s]ame man to tho[s]e offices which require the head, whereas he has been accu[s]tomed to impre[s]s with his foot, and there appears a contra[s]t between the man and the occupation. There are individuals in [s]ociety, who prefer honour to wealth; or cultivate political [s]tudies as a branch of literary pursuits; and offer them[s]elves to [s]erve public bodies, in order to have an opportunity of di[s]covering their knowledge, and exerci[s]ing their judgment. It mu[s]t be chagrining to the[s]e, and hurtful to the public, to [s]ee tho[s]e who have no talent this way, and ought to have no ta[s]te, prepo[s]terou[s]ly obtrude them[s]elves upon the government. It is the [s]ame as if a brick-layer [s]hould u[s]urp the office of a taylor, and come with his [s]quare [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] and perpendicular, to take the mea[s]ure of a pair of breeches. It is proper that tho[s]e who cultivate oratory, [s]hould go to the hou[s]e of orators. But for an Ay and No man to be ambitious of that place, is to [s]acrifice his credit to his vanity. I would not mean to in[s]inuate that legislators are to be [s]elected from the more wealthy of the citizens, yet a man's circumstances ought to be [s]uch as afford him lei[s]ure for [s]tudy and reflection. There is often wealth without ta[s]te or talent. I have no idea, that becau[s]e a man lives in a great hou[s]e, and has a clu[s]ter of bricks or [s]tones about his back[s]ide, that he is therefore fit for a legi[s]lator. There is [s]o much pride and arrogance with tho[s]e who con[s]ider them[s]elves the fir[s]t in a government, that it de[s]erves to be checked by the populace, and the evil mo[s]t u[s]ually commences on this [s]ide. Men a[s][s]ociate with their own per[s]ons, the adventitious circum[s]tances of birth and fortune: So that a fellow blowing with fat and repletion, conceives him[s]elf [s]uperior to the poor lean man, that lodges in an inferior man[s]ion. But as in all ca[s]es, [s]o in this, there is a medium. Genius and virtue are independent of rank and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] fortune; and it is neither the opulent, nor the indigent, but the man of ability and integrity that ought to be called forth to [s]erve his country: and while, on the one hand, the ari[s]tocratic part of the government, arrogates a right to repre[s]ent; on the other hand, the democratic contends the point; and from this conjunction and oppo[s]ition of forces, there is produced a compound re[s]olution, which carries the object in an intermediate direction. When we [s]ee therefore, a Teague Oregan lifted up, the philo[s]opher will reflect, that it is to balance [s]ome pur[s]e-proud fellow, equally as ignorant, that comes down from the [s]phere of the ari[s]tocratic intere[s]t. But every man ought to con[s]ider for him[s]elf, whether it is his u[s]e to be this draw-back, on either [s]ide. For as when good liquor is to be di[s]tilled, you throw in [s]ome material u[s]ele[s]s in it[s]elf to correct the efferve[s]cence of the [s]pirit; [s]o it may be his part to act as a [s]edative. For though we commend the effect, yet [s]till the material retains but its original value. But as the nature of things is [s]uch, let no man, who means well to the commonwealth, and offers to [s]erve it, be hurt in his mind when [s]ome one of meaner talents [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] is preferred. The people are a [s]overeign, and greatly de[s]potic; but, in the main, ju[s]t. I have a great mind, in order to elevate the compo[s]ition, to make quotations from the Greek and Roman hi[s]tory. And I am con[s]cious to my[s]elf, that I have read over the writers on the government of Italy and Greece, in ancient, as well as modern times. But I have drawn a great deal more from reflection on the nature of things, than from all the writings I have ever read. Nay, the hi[s]tory of the election, which I have ju[s]t given, will afford a better le[s][s]on to the American mind, than all that is to be found in other examples. We have [s]een here, a weaver a favoured candidate, and in the next instance, a bog-trotter [s]uper[s]eding him. Now it may be [s]aid, that this is fiction; but fiction, or no fiction, the nature of the thing will make it a reality. But I return to the adventures of the Captain, whom I have upon my hands; and who, as far as I can yet di[s]cover, is a good hone[s]t man; and means what is benevolent and u[s]eful; though his ideas may not comport with the ordinary manner of thinking, in every particular. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] THERE was, in a certain great city, a [s]ociety who called them[s]elves Philosophers. They had publi[s]hed books, they called Tran[s]actions. The[s]e contained di[s][s]ertations on the nature and cau[s]es of things; from the [s]tars of the heaven to the fire-flies of the earth; and from the [s]ea-crab to the woodland buffaloe. Such di[s]qui[s]itions, are doubtle[s]s u[s]eful and entertaining to an inqui[s]itive mind. There is no que[s]tion, but there were in this body [s]ome very great men; who[s]e inve[s]tigations of the arcana of nature, deserve attention. But [s]o it was, there had been introduced, by [s]ome means, many individuals, who were no philo[s]ophers at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] all. This is no unu[s]ual thing with institutions of this nature; though, by the bye, it is a very great fault. For it lessens the incentives of honour, to have the acce[s]s made [s]o ea[s]y, that every one may obtain admi[s][s]ion. It has been a reproach to [s]ome colleges, that a diploma could be purcha[s]ed for half a crown. This [s]ociety were [s]till more moderate; for the bare [s]cratching the back[s]ide of a member has been known to procure a fellow[s]hip. At lea[s]t, there have been tho[s]e admitted who appeared capable of nothing el[s]e. Neverthele[s]s, it was nece[s][s]ary, even in the[s]e ca[s]es, for the candidates to procure [s]ome token of a philo[s]ophical turn of mind; [s]uch as the [s]kin of a dead cat, or [s]ome odd kind of a mou[s]e-trap, or the like; or have [s]ome phra[s]es in their mouths, about minerals and petrifactions; [s]o as ju[s]t to [s]upport [s]ome idea of natural knowledge, and pa[s]s mu[s]ter. There was one who had got in by finding, accidentally, the tail of a rabbit, which had been taken off in a boy's trap. Another by means of a [s]quirrel's [s]calp, which he had taken care to [s]tretch and dry on a bit of o[s]ier, bended in the form of a hoop. The beard of an old fox, taken off and dried in the [s]un, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] was the means of introducing one whom I knew very well: Or rather, as I have already hinted, it was beforehand intended he [s]hould be introduced; and the[s]e exuviae, or [s]poils of the animal kingdom, were but the tokens and apologies for admission. It happened, as the Captain was riding this day, and Teague trotting after him, he [s]aw a large owl, that had been [s]hot by [s]ome body, and was placed in the crotch of a tree, about the height of a man's head from the ground, for tho[s]e that pa[s][s]ed by to look at. The Captain being [s]truck with it, as [s]omewhat larger than [s]uch birds u[s]ually are, de[s]ired Teague to reach it to him; and tying it to the hinder part of his saddle, rode along. Pa[s][s]ing by the hou[s]e of one who belonged to the [s]ociety, the bird was noticed at the [s]addle-[s]kirts, and the philo[s]opher coming out, made enquiry of the genus and nature of the fowl. Said the Captain, I know nothing more about it, than that it is nearly as long as a turkey buzzard. It is doubtle[s]s, [s]aid the other, the great Canada owl, that comes from the Lakes; and if your honour will give me leave, I will take it and [s]ubmit it to the [s]ociety, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] have your[s]elf made a member. As to the fir[s]t, the Captain con[s]ented; but as to the la[s]t, the being a member, he cho[s]e rather to decline it; conceiving him[s]elf unqualified for a place in [s]uch a body. The other a[s][s]ured him that he was under a very great mi[s]take; for there were per[s]ons there who [s]carcely knew a B from a bull's foot. That may be, [s]aid the Captain; but if others chu[s]e to degrade them[s]elves, by [s]uffering their names to be u[s]ed in [s]o prepo[s]terous a way as that, it was no rea[s]on he [s]hould. The other gave him to under[s]tand, that the [s]ociety would certainly wi[s]h to expre[s]s their [s]en[s]e of his merit, and [s]hew themselves not inattentive to a virtuo[s]o; that as he declined the honour him[s]elf, he probably might not be aver[s]e to let his servant take a [s]eat among them. Said the Captain, He is but a [s]imple Iri[s]hman, and of a low education; his language being that [s]poken by the aborigines of his country. And if he [s]peaks a little Engli[s]h, it is with the brogue on his tongue; which would be unbecoming in a member of your body. It would [s]eem to me, that a philo[s]opher ought to know how to write, or at lea[s]t to read. But Teague can neither write nor read. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] can [s]ing a [s]ong, or whi[s]tle an Iri[s]h tune; but is totally illiterate in all things el[s]e. I que[s]tion much if he could tell you how many new moons there are in the year; or any the mo[s]t common thing that you could a[s]k him. He is a long-legged fellow, it is true; and might be of [s]ervice in clambering over rocks, or going to the [s]hores of rivers, to gather curio[s]ities. But could you not get per[s]ons to do this, without making them members? I have more re[s]pect for [s]cience, than to [s]uffer this bog-trotter to be [s]o advanced at its expence. In the[s]e American [s]tates, there is a wide field for philo[s]ophic [s]earch; and the[s]e researches may be of great u[s]e in agriculture, mechanics, and a[s]tronomy. There is but little immediate profit attending the[s]e pur[s]uits; but if there can be inducements of honour, the[s]e may [s]upply the place. What more alluring to a young man, than the pro[s]pect of being, one day, received into a [s]ociety of men truly learned; the admi[s][s]ion being a te[s]t and a proof of di[s]tingui[s]hed knowledge. But the fountain of honour, thus contaminated by a [s]ediment foreign from its nature, who would wi[s]h to drink of it? Said the philo[s]opher, At the fir[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] institution of the [s]ociety by Dr. Franklin and others, it was put upon a narrow ba[s]is, and only men of [s]cience were con[s]idered proper to compo[s]e it; and this might be a nece[s][s]ary policy at that time, when the institution was in its infancy, and could not bear much draw-back of ignorance. But it has not been judged [s]o nece[s][s]ary of late years. The matter [s]tands now on a broad and catholic bottom; and, like the go[s]pel it[s]elf, it is our orders to go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in. There are hundreds, who[s]e names you may [s]ee on our li[s]t, who are not more in[s]tructed than this lad of yours. They mu[s]t be a [s]ad [s]et indeed then, [s]aid the Captain. Sad or no [s]ad, [s]aid the other, it is the ca[s]e; and if you will let Teague go, I will engage him a member[s]hip. I take it very ill of you, Mr. Philosopher, [s]aid the Captain, to put this non[s]en[s]e in his head. If you knew what trouble I have lately had with a parcel of people that were for [s]ending him to Congre[s]s, you would be unwilling to draw him from me for the purpo[s]e of making him a philosopher. It is not an ea[s]y matter to get hirelings now-a-days; and when you do get one, it is a mere chance, whether he is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] faithful, and will [s]uit your purpo[s]e. It would be a very great lo[s]s to me, to have him taken off at this time, when I have equipped my[s]elf for a journey. Teague was a good deal incen[s]ed at this refu[s]al of his ma[s]ter, and in[s]i[s]ted that he would be a philo[s]opher. You are an ignoramus, [s]aid the Captain. It is not the being among philo[s]ophers will make you one. Teague in[s]i[s]ted that he had a right to make the be[s]t of his fortune: and as there was a door open to his advancement, he did not [s]ee why he might not make u[s]e of it. The Captain finding that it an[s]wered no end to di[s]pute the matter with him, by words of [s]en[s]e and rea[s]on, took a contrary way to manage him. Teague, [s]aid he, I have a regard for you, and would wi[s]h to [s]ee you do well. But before you take this [s]tep, I would wi[s]h to [s]peak a word or two in private. If you will go, I may perhaps [s]ugge[s]t [s]ome things that may be of [s]ervice to you, for your future conduct in that body. Teague con[s]enting, they [s]tepped a[s]ide; and the Captain addre[s][s]ed him in the following manner: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] Teague, [s]aid he, do you know what you are about? It is a fine thing, at fir[s]t [s]ight, to be a philo[s]opher, and get into this body. And indeed, if you are a real philosopher, it might be [s]ome honour, and al[s]o [s]afe, to take that leap. But do you think it is to make a philo[s]opher of you that they want you? Far from it. It is their great [s]tudy to find curio[s]ities; and because this man [s]aw you coming after me, with a red head, trotting like an Esquimaux Indian, it has [s]truck his mind to pick you up, and pa[s]s you for one. Nay, it is po[s][s]ible, they may intend wor[s]e; and when they have examined you awhile, take the [s]kin off you, and pa[s]s you for an over-grown otter, or a mu[s]k-rat; or [s]ome outlandi[s]h animal, for which they will, them[s]elves, invent a name. If you were at the mu[s]eum of one of the[s]e [s]ocieties, to ob[s]erve the quantity of [s]kins and [s]keletons they have, you might be well a[s][s]ured they did not come by them hone[s]tly. I know [s]o much of the[s]e people, that I am well persuaded they would think no more of throwing you into a kettle of boiling water, than they would a tarapin; and having [s]craped you out to a [s]hell, pre[s]ent you as the relics of an animal they had procured, at an immen[s]e price, from [s]ome [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] Guinea merchant. Or if they [s]hould not at once turn you to this u[s]e, how, in the mean time, will they di[s]po[s]e of you? They will have you away through the bogs and mar[s]hes, catching flies and miresnipes; or [s]end you to the woods for a polecat; or oblige you to de[s]cend into drawwells for fog, and phlogi[s]tic air, and the Lord knows what. You mu[s]t go into wolves dens, and catch bears by the tail; run over mountains like an opo[s][s]um, and dig the earth like a ground hog. You will have to climb upon trees, and get your[s]elf bit by flying [s]quirrels. There will be no end to the mu[s]ketoes you will have to di[s][s]ect. What is all this to diving into mill-dams and rivers, to get craw-fi[s]h. Or if you go to the ocean, there are alligators to devour you like a cat-fi[s]h. Who knows but it may come your turn, in a windy night, to go aloft to the heavens, to rub down the [s]tars, and give the goats and rams, that are there, fodder. The keeping the [s]tars clean, is a laborious work; a great deal wor[s]e than [s]couring andirons, or bra[s]s kettles. There is a bull there would think no more of to[s][s]ing you on his horns than he would a puppy dog. If the crab [s]hould get you in his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] claws he would [s]queeze you like a lob[s]ter. But what is all that to your having no place to [s]tand on? How would you like to be up at the moon, and to fall down when you had mi[s][s]ed your hold, like a boy from the top-ma[s]t of a [s]hip, and have your brains beat out upon the top of [s]ome great mountain; where the devil might take your [s]keleton and give it to the turkey-buzzards? Or if they [s]hould, in the mean time, excu[s]e from [s]uch out of door [s]ervices, they will rack and torture you with hard questions. You mu[s]t tell them how long the rays of light are coming from the [s]un; how many drops of rain fall in a thunder gu[s]t; what makes the gra[s]shopper chirp when the [s]un is hot; how mu[s]cle [s]hells get up to the top of the mountains; how the Indians got over to America. You will have to prove ab[s]olutely that the negroes were once white; and that their flat no[s]es came by [s]ome cau[s]e in the compass of human means to produce. The[s]e are puzzling que[s]tions; and yet you mu[s]t [s]olve them all. Take my advice, and [s]tay where you are. Many men have ruined them[s]elves by their ambition, and made bad wor[s]e. There is another kind of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] philo[s]ophy, which lies more within your [s]phere; that is moral philo[s]ophy. Every ho[s]tler or hireling can [s]tudy this, and you have the mo[s]t excellent opportunity of acquiring this knowledge in our traverses through the country; or communications at the different taverns or villages, where we may happen to [s]ojourn. Teague had long ago given up all thoughts of philo[s]ophy, and would not for the world have any more to do with it; and therefore, without bidding the philo[s]opher adieu, they pur[s]ued their route as u[s]ual. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] THE in[s]titution of the American Philosophical Society, does great honour to the founders; and what has been published by that body, comes not behind what has appeared from [s]ocieties of the [s]ame nature el[s]ewhere. But of late years, it has cea[s]ed to be pre[s]umptive evidence, at lea[s]t what the lawyers call violent presumption, of philo[s]ophical attainments, to be a member; owing to the [s]purious brood of illiterate per[s]ons that have been admitted indi[s]criminately with the informed; this again, owing to a political di[s]pute in the government where this [s]ociety exi[s]ts. For when there are parties in a commonwealth, they naturally [s]ubdivide them[s]elves, and are found even in the retreats of the mu[s]es. It has become the que[s]tion with this society, not whether a man is a philo[s]opher or not, but what part he had taken in [s]ome que[s]tion on the carpet. The body [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] conceived it[s]elf to pay a compliment to the per[s]on admitted, as if it could be any honour to a man to be announced what he is not. The contrary is the ca[s]e here. For as honour is the acknowledgement which the world makes of a man's re[s]pectability, there can be no honour here; for it has become a mere matter of moon-[s]hine to be a member. To be or not be, that is the que[s]tion; but [s]o trifling, that it is [s]carcely ever made. The way to remedy this, would be to have an over hauling of the hou[s]e, and derange at lea[s]t three parts in four. As in the ca[s]e of Tarquin, and the three remaining books of the Sybiles, you would receive as much for the fourth part of that body, [s]hould you [s]et them up at market, as for the whole at pre[s]ent. I have often reflected with my[s]elf, what an honour it mu[s]t be, to be one of the society of the French academy; forty, of twenty-four millions of people, are there [s]elected in con[s]equence of literary characters already e[s]tabli[s]hed. I recollect the time when I had high ideas of philo[s]ophical member[s]hip in America. But it does not appear to me now to be the highe[s]t thing that a man could wi[s]h, [s]ince even a common Teague Oregan, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] trotting on the high way, has been [s]olicited to take a [s]eat. It may be [s]aid, that this is an exaggeration of the facts; and can be con[s]idered only as burle[s]que. I profe[s]s it is not intended as [s]uch, but as a fair picture of what has taken place. Should it be con[s]idered in the light of burle[s]que, it mu[s]t be a very lame one; becau[s]e where there is no exce[s]s there can be no caricatura. But omitting all apologies and explanations, let the matter re[s]t where it is. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] IT was [s]omewhat late when the Captain arrived at an inn this evening. There was there before him, a young clergyman, who had been preaching that day in a neighbouring congregation; but had not as u[s]ual, gone home with an elder; but had come thus far on his way towards another place, where he was to preach the next day. The Captain entering into conver[s]ation with the clergyman, [s]at up pretty late. The [s]ubject was what might be expected; viz. the affairs of religion and the church. The clergyman was a good young man; but inclining to fanatici[s]m, and being righteous over much: The Captain on the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] other hand, [s]omewhat [s]ceptical in his notions of religion: Hence, a con[s]iderable oppo[s]ition of [s]entiment between the two. But at length, drowzine[s]s [s]eizing both, candles were called for, and they went to bed. It was about an hour or two after, when an uproar was heard in a [s]mall chamber to the left of the [s]tair-ca[s]e which led to the floor on which they [s]lept. It was Teague, who had got to bed to the girl of the hou[s]e. For as they would neither let him go to Congre[s]s, nor be a philo[s]opher, he mu[s]t be doing [s]omething. The girl not being apprized, or not chu[s]ing his embraces, made a great outcry and lamentation. The clergyman, who [s]lept in an adjoining chamber, and hearing this, out of the zeal of his benevolence and humanity, leaped out of bed in his [s]hirt, and ran in to [s]ee what was the cau[s]e of the disturbance. The Captain al[s]o jumping up, followed [s]oon after, and was [s]carcely in the chamber before the landlord coming up with a candle, found them all together. The maid gave this account of the matter, viz. That between [s]leeping and waking [s]he felt a man's hand lifting up the bed-clothes; upon which [s]he [s]houted out [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] murder. But whether it was any body there pre[s]ent, or [s]ome one el[s]e, [s]he could not tell. Teague, who[s]e natural parts were not bad, and pre[s]ence of mind con[s]iderable, in[s]tantly took the re[s]olution to throw the matter on the clergyman. By [s]haint Patrick, [s]aid he, I was a[s]lape in my own bed as [s]ound as the [s]hates that were about me, when I heard the [s]ound of this young crature's voice crying out like a [s]hape in a pa[s]ture; and when after I had heard, a[s]lape as I was, and come here, I found this pra[s]te, who was [s]o wholy, and praching all night, upon the top of the bed, with his arms round this young crature's neck; and if I had not given him a twitch by the no[s]e, and bid him ly over, dear honey, he would have ravi[s]hed her virginity, and murdered her, [s]ave her [s]oul, and the paple of the hou[s]e not the wi[s]er for it. The clergyman [s]tared with his mouth open; for the palpable nature of the falshood, had [s]hocked him beyond the power of [s]peech. But the landlady, who in the mean time was come up, and had heard what Teague had [s]aid, was enraged, could [s]upply [s]peech [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] for them both. Hey, [s]aid [s]he, this comes of your preaching and praying, Mr. Minister. I have lodged many a gentleman; but have never had [s]uch doings here before. It is a pretty [s]tory that a mini[s]ter of the gospel [s]hould be the fir[s]t to bring a [s]candal upon the hou[s]e. The Captain interrupted her, and told her there was no harm done. The maid was not actually ravi[s]hed; and if there was no noi[s]e made about it, all matters might be [s]et right. The clergyman had by this time recovered him[s]elf [s]o much as to have the u[s]e of his tongue; and began by prote[s]ting his innocence, and that it was no more him that made the attack upon the maid, than the angel Gabriel. The Captain, interrupting him, and wi[s]hing to [s]ave his feelings, began by excusing or extenuating the offence. It is no great affair, [s]aid he, after all that is [s]aid or done. The love of women is a natural [s]in, and the holie[s]t men in all ages have been propen[s]e to this indulgence. There was Abraham that got to bed to his maid Hagar, and had a ba[s]tard by her, whom he named I[s]hmael. Jo[s]hua, who took Jericho by the [s]ound of ram's horns, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] [s]aved a likely [s]lut of the name of Rahab, under a pretence that [s]he had been civil to the [s]pies he had [s]ent out, but in reality because he him[s]elf took a fancy for her. I need [s]ay nothing about David, who wrote the P[s]alms, and [s]et them to mu[s]ic; and yet in his old days had a girl to [s]leep with him. Human nature is human nature [s]till; and it is not all the preaching and praying on earth can extingui[s]h it. The clergyman averred his innocence, and that it was that red-headed gentleman him[s]elf, meaning Teague, who was in the room fir[s]t, and had been guilty of the outrage. Teague was beginning to make the [s]ign of the cro[s]s, and to put him[s]elf into an attitude of [s]wearing, when the Captain thinking it of no con[s]equence who was the per[s]on, put an end to the matter, by ordering Teague to bed, and him[s]elf bidding the company good night. The clergyman finding no better could be made of it, took the advice of the landlord, and retired al[s]o. The landlady seemed di[s]po[s]ed to hu[s]h the matter up, and the maid went to [s]leep as u[s]ual. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] IT is not the nature of the female tongue to be [s]ilent. The landlady could not avoid informing her go[s][s]ips, and even [s]ome of her gue[s]ts, of what had happened the preceding evening in her hou[s]e. The report, [s]o unfavourable to the clergyman, had therefore got out; and coming to the ears of the con[s]i[s]tory, was the occa[s]ion of calling him before them, to an[s]wer to the accu[s]ation. The clergyman much alarmed, though con[s]cious of innocence, bethought him[s]elf of applying to the Captain, to extort from his waiting man a confe[s][s]ion of the truth, and relieve his character. Accordingly having [s]et out on a bay hor[s]e that he had, he found the Captain, and addre[s][s]ed him in the following manner: Captain, [s]aid he, the affair of that night at the tavern, is like to be of [s]erious consequence to me. For though I am innocent as the child unborn, yet the presumption is again[s]t me, and I am likely to fall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] under church cen[s]ure. It may be [s]port to you, but it is a matter of moment to me. Now, as [s]ure as God is in heaven, I am innocent; and it mu[s]t have been the devil, or that red headed Iri[s]hman of yours, that made the di[s]turbance. The Captain gave him the comfort of a[s][s]uring him that he might make him[s]elf ea[s]y; for be the matter as it might, he would take care that Teague [s]hould assume it, and bear the blame. The clergyman politely thanked him; declaring, at the [s]ame time, that he would not forget him in his prayers, Sunday or Saturday, while he had an hour to live. The Captain, not [s]o much from any mercenary motive of benefit, by his [s]piritual [s]olicitations, as from a real love of humanity and ju[s]tice, had determined to do him e[s][s]ential [s]ervice in this affair. Accordingly, when the clergyman had retired, calling Teague before him, he began in this manner: Teague, [s]aid he, from what I know of your di[s]po[s]ition, I have no more doubt than I have of my exi[s]tence, that it was your[s]elf who made that uproar with the girl at the tavern where we lodged; though I could not but give you credit for your pre[s]ence of mind in throwing it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] upon the clergyman. But whether the matter lies with you or him, is of no con[s]equence. You can take it upon you, and lay up trea[s]ure in heaven. It will be doing a good work; and the[s]e people, you may be a[s][s]ured, have a con[s]iderable influence in the other world. This clergyman can [s]peak a good word for you when you come there, and let you into half the benefit of all the prayers he has [s]aid on earth. It will be no harm to you, for your character in this re[s]pect is as bad as it can well be. Teague [s]aid he did not care much; but thought the prie[s]t ought to pay a little [s]mart money; for it was a thankle[s]s matter to do the[s]e things for nothing. Said the Captain, the[s]e people are not the mo[s]t plenty of money; but I will advance half a crown towards the accommodation. Teague was [s]atisfied, and ready to acknowledge whatever was demanded of him. Accordingly having come before the pre[s]bytery on the day appointed for the trial. Teague made confe[s][s]ion of the truth; viz. That being in the kitchen with the girl, and ob[s]erving her to be a good looking hu[s][s]y --- But [s]uppo[s]e we give the [s]peech in his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] own dialect. Ma[s]ter pra[s]tes, [s]aid he, I per[s]ave you are all pra[s]tes of the go[s]ple, and can prach as a[s]ily as I can take a chaw of tobacco. Now the trut of de [s]tory is dis; I was [s]laping in my bed, and I tought vid my[s]elf it was a [s]hame amon[s]t chri[s]tian paple that a young crature [s]hould [s]lape by her[s]elf, and have no one to take care of her. So I tought vid my[s]elf, to go and [s]lape vid her. But as [s]he was a[s]lape, [s]he made exclamation, and dis pra[s]te that is here before you, came in to [s]ave her [s]houl from the devil; and as the captain my master, might take offence, and the devil, I am [s]hartain that it was no better per[s]on, put it into my head, to lay it on the pra[s]te This is the trut ma[s]ter pra[s]tes, as I hope for [s]halvation in the kingdom of purgatory, [s]hentlemen. On this confe[s][s]ion, the clergyman was ab[s]olved, to the great joy of the presbytery, who con[s]idered it as a particular providence that the truth was brought to light. Containing Reflections. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] IT mu[s]t appear from the incident at the public hou[s]e, with what caution presumptive te[s]timony is to be admitted. Our criminal law admits it, but lays it down as a rule, that it be admitted with caution. There is what is called violent presumption; that is, where [s]uch circum[s]tances exi[s]t, as u[s]ually attend the fact. Presumptive proof of this nature is held [s]ufficient to convict. I doubt much, whether reason or experience approve the doctrine. Rea[s]on tells us, that there may be all the circum[s]tances that u[s]ually attend the fact, and yet without the fact it[s]elf. Experience evinces that it has been the ca[s]e; for we have heard of per[s]ons convicted of a capital offence; and yet with their la[s]t breath a[s][s]erting innocence. Nay, in the ca[s]e of [s]ome who have been convicted of homicide, the per[s]ons who have been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] supposed to have been murdered, have afterwards been found alive. But on ab[s]tract principles, a conclu[s]ion of certainty cannot be drawn from presumptive proof. Becau[s]e in ca[s]es of the mo[s]t violent pre[s]umption, there is [s]till a po[s][s]ibility of innocence; and where there is a po[s][s]ibility, there mu[s]t be a doubt; and will you hang man, woman, or child, where there is a doubt. In all ca[s]es there ought to be complete proof; becau[s]e the convicted per[s]on is to be completely puni[s]hed; and the jury, previous to this, mu[s]t make complete oath of the guilt. It is the ground of the doctrine of presumptive proof, that where you cannot help [s]u[s]pecting, you ought to be po[s]itive; whereas the ju[s]t conclu[s]ion would be, that where you cannot help [s]u[s]pecting, there you ought to [s]u[s]pect [s]till, but no more. It would be a curious que[s]tion in arithmetic how many uncertainties make a certainty? In mathematics, the three angles of a triangle, are equal to a right angle. But the[s]e are all angles, that are put together; that is, they are things of the [s]ame kind, but the greate[s]t angle, and the longe[s]t [s]ide will never make a triangle, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] because there is no inclu[s]ion of [s]pace. There mu[s]t be a number of things of the [s]ame kind to make an aggregate whole; [s]o that ten thou[s]and po[s][s]ibilities, probabilities, and violent pre[s]umptions, can never con[s]titute a certainty. Pre[s]umptive proof is of the nature of the [s]emi plena probatio of the Roman law; going but half-way towards proof, it can never amount to proof at all. For, as the [s]aying is, a mi[s]s is as good as a mile. I would, therefore, recommend to all jurors, to take care that unle[s]s the witne[s][s]es [s]wear po[s]itively to the fact, they do not find a verdict, guilty; becau[s]e, as the current cannot ri[s]e higher than the [s]ource, [s]o the verdict of the juror ought not to be more ab[s]olute than the oath of the witne[s]s. In all ca[s]es, therefore, [s]hort of po[s]itive testimony, acquit. The[s]e hints may al[s]o be of [s]ervice to young attornies, and weak judges; [s]o that hone[s]t people may not lo[s]e their lives, or be rendered infamous, without full proof of the offence. It is hard enough to suffer when there is full proof; but to be in the power of a juror's or a judge's imagination, comparing and con[s]truing circumstances, and weighing po[s][s]ibilities, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] contingencies, and what might have been, or what might not have been, as the humour, caprice, wheel, or whim of the brain may [s]ugge[s]t, is incon[s]i[s]tent with that fair trial which, in a free government, ought to be enjoyed. Was I a judge or juror, no one would I condemn without po[s]itive testimony of the fact. For it would not be in my power to re[s]tore that fame or life which I took away from the innocent. And if a guilty per[s]on [s]hould e[s]cape, it was none of my look out; but the business of Providence to furni[s]h proof, if it was intended that man [s]hould puni[s]h; and if proof is not furni[s]hed, let Providence take the matter on him[s]elf, and puni[s]h the culprit either in this life or in a future [s]tate. Invi[s]ible things belong to the Omni[s]cient; and it would [s]eem great arrogance in man to take upon him to decide in ca[s]es of uncertainty. I hope, therefore, yet to [s]ee the doctrine of pre[s]umptive proof, in criminal ca[s]es, wholly, in courts of ju[s]tice, discountenanced. I can declare, that in the cour[s]e of my experience at the bar, I have bad one hung, and [s]everal others within an ace of it, who were innocent; and this on the doctrine of pre[s]umption and probability. The one that was hung was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] a tory ca[s]e, where the popular clamour was again[s]t the man; and light presumption became violent, under [s]uch a charge. I [s]hall [s]ay no more on this [s]ubject; becau[s]e it [s]eems to me that I have been affecting to [s]peak [s]en[s]e, whereas my business is to [s]peak non[s]en[s]e; this being the only way to keep out of the reach of criticism; becau[s]e critics can [s]ay no more than you your[s]elf allow; [s]o that a charge of non[s]en[s]e cannot hurt. It is thus that per[s]ons who have a long no[s]e, or disproportion of [s]ome other feature, take the laugh upon them[s]elves fir[s]t, and [s]o e[s]cape ridicule. The truth is, I will not give myself the trouble to write [s]en[s]e long. For I would as [s]oon plea[s]e fools as wi[s]e men; becau[s]e the fools are the mo[s]t numerous, and every prudent man will go with the majority. I [s]hall return to the adventures of the Captain. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] THE Pre[s]bytery [s]at a day or two at this place, on church affairs, and the Captain delaying with them, lodged at the [s]ame hou[s]e. Teague, in the mean time, having an opportunity of ingratiating himself with the clergymen, by rubing down their hor[s]es, and other menial [s]ervices. For it is the national character of the aboriginal Iri[s]h, to give fair words; and Teague was not deficient in this addre[s]s. What with ma[s]ter Pra[s]ting, and giving a great deal of what is called Blarney, he in[s]inuated him[s]elf into their good graces; and by affecting, now and then, to be [s]een at prayers by him[s]elf, and to have a sorrowful countenance, he induced them to believe that he was in the fir[s]t [s]tage of conviction, and likely to become a pious man. Having made this progre[s]s in their good opinion, he ventured to [s]ugge[s]t what was the ultimate object of his ambition; viz. the being a candidate for holy orders. The Pre[s]bytery, to whom the matter was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] represented by the individuals more particularly acquainted with him, thought favourably of the propo[s]ition. For though his common attainments might not be great, yet if the grace of God had wrought upon him, he might become a valuable man. The Captain having got a hint of this, took the fir[s]t opportunity of addre[s][s]ing the Pre[s]bytery. Gentlemen, [s]aid he, you are deceived in this ragamuffin. For, notwithstanding all the preten[s]ions he may lately have to religion, you may be well a[s][s]ured that it is all hypocri[s]y, and that he has no more religion than my hor[s]e. The Pre[s]bytery [s]u[s]pecting the Captain to be a carnal man, and regardle[s]s of the mini[s]try, gave little heed to what he [s]aid, and [s]eemed di[s]po[s]ed to take Teague upon trials. The Captain finding the ca[s]e to [s]tand thus, and that in [s]pite of all he could do, he was likely to lo[s]e his [s]ervant, took his u[s]ual method of addre[s][s]ing the hopes and fears of Teague him[s]elf. Taking him a[s]ide, he began, with all po[s][s]ible art, to impre[s]s [s]uch fears and apprehensions, as the nature of the ca[s]e suggested. Teague, [s]aid he, do you know what you are about? You have got into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] your vagaries once more. You want to preach, do you? Are you appri[s]ed of the difficulty of this work? The fir[s]t thing you will have to do, is to take a text; and when that is done, you have to [s]plit it into parts. There are what are called heads; and the[s]e you mu[s]t divide into fir[s]tlys, and [s]econdlys, and thirdlys, and fourthlys, and [s]o on, till you come to twentiethlys, perhaps. Are you furni[s]hed with a concordance? or do you know what a concordance is? Can you find a text to [s]uit your purpo[s]e when you want it? Can you explain the [s]criptures; the meaning of Daniel's ram and the he-goat, or the [s]even trumpets in the Revelations? You are mi[s]taken if you think your Iri[s]h will pa[s]s for Hebrew. You think it a great honour to preach now-a days. It was an honour once; but the thing is now become [s]o common, that it is of little con[s]equence to preach or not. But do you know how it will behove you to conduct your[s]elf, if you take this office upon you. You will have to compo[s]e the mu[s]cles of your face to greater seriousness than your di[s]po[s]ition can afford. You mu[s]t quit whoring. How will you like that, Teague. It would look very ill after [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] [s]ermon to be catched in bed with a girl at a tavern. But do you know why the[s]e men are [s]o anxious to have you of their me[s]s? The truth of the matter is, they carry on a war with the devil, and they wi[s]h to recruit you for the [s]ervice. Do they give you any bounty-money. Take my word, there will be but little of this going. Take my advice then, and let them [s]ettle their own quarrels. It is a [s]illy thing to be drawn into a party, when there is but little to be got by it: Nay, wor[s]e than little: For it will be all on the other [s]ide. Think you the devil will forget the mi[s]chief you do him in this world, and not re[s]ent it when he comes acro[s]s you in a future [s]tate? When you are preaching and praying, do you think he will not hear all that you throw out again[s]t him. You may rely upon it, there will be enough to give him information; and as a [s]tory never lo[s]es in the telling, it is ten to one they will make the matter wor[s]e than it was. Take my advice, therefore, and make no enemies while you can help it. Steer through life as [s]moothly as po[s][s]ible. Keep a good tongue in your mouth, and let tho[s]e who chu[s]e to di[s]pute with Belzebub, di[s]pute. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] never knew any good come of broils and quarrels, e[s]pecially with low characters. And, to [s]ay the truth of it, this Satan, as they call him, is very little of the gentleman. Even where he is well di[s]po[s]ed, he will do but little good to one; but a mo[s]t dangerous creature where he takes a di[s]like. When you go to hell, as, one day, you mu[s]t, you can expect but little quarter, after abu[s]ing him in this world. He will make you [s]queel like a pig; take you by the throat, and kick you like a cat. His very [s]cullions will pi[s]s upon you, and give you no better life than a dog among their feet; while the[s]e very clergymen, that put you forward to blackguard for them, will [s]tand by laughing in their [s]leeves that you could be [s]uch a fool. The repre[s]entation had the de[s]ired effect upon Teague, and he thought no more of the matter. The Conclu[s]ion, with Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] THE overtures made by Teague, to be admitted to the mini[s]try, and the simplicity of the eccle[s]ia[s]tics in li[s]tening to his preten[s]ions, made a great noi[s]e through the neighbourhood; in as much as the young man laboured under a want of education, and was not qualified by theological reading. But I do not [s]ee, why it [s]hould be thought blamable; provided the matter was not too much hurried and ha[s]tily brought forward. For give him a little time, and he might have been in[s]tructed to preach as well as [s]ome that I my[s]elf have heard. E[s]pecially if at fir[s]t [s]etting out, he had confined him[s]elf to hi[s]torical passages of [s]cripture; [s]uch as the hi[s]tory of Samp[s]on, and Gideon, and Barak, and the like: Only he mu[s]t have taken care that in pronouncing Barak, with the brogue upon his tongue, he did not make it Burke; for that is a patronimic name of his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] country, and he might inadvertently have fallen into this pronunciation. I acknowledge, that in the regular churches, [s]uch as that of the Presbyterians, there is [s]till kept up [s]ome opinion of the nece[s][s]ity of literature. But do we not [s]ee that with other denominations; [s]uch as the Quakers, the Methodi[s]ts, and Anabaptists, it is totally di[s]regarded and thrown out? Becau[s]e when human gifts or acquirements are ab[s]ent, that which is supernatural more evidently appears. Do not Quakers, and Methodi[s]ts, and Bapti[s]ts, preach very well? At any rate, they do a great deal of good, and that is the fir[s]t object of preaching. Whether [s]uch [s]ermoni[s]ts, avail them[s]elves mo[s]t of [s]en[s]e or [s]ound, I will not [s]ay; but [s]o it is they do good; and that without the aid of any human learning whatever. It is very true, that formerly in the infancy of the church, a knowledge of languages and [s]ciences, might be requi[s]ite. But the ca[s]e is quite altered now. The Scripture has been well explained, and frequently preached over; every text and context examined, and pa[s][s]ages illu[s]trated. The Hebrew roots, [s]o to [s]peak, have been all dug up; and there is [s]carcely a new [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] etymology to be made. Are there any new doctrines to di[s]cover? I [s]hould think it impossible. At any rate, I [s]hould conceive it unnece[s][s]ary. There are enough in all con[s]cience: The inventing more, would be like bringing timber to a wood, or coals to Newca[s]tle. This being the ca[s]e, I feel my[s]elf disposed to agree with tho[s]e who reject human learning in religious matters altogether. More e[s]pecially as [s]cience is really not the fa[s]hion at the pre[s]ent time. For as has been before [s]een, even in the very province of [s]cience it[s]elf, it is di[s]pen[s]ed with; that of natural philo[s]ophy, for instance. In [s]tate affairs, ignorance does very well, and why not in church? I am for having all things of a piece; ignorant [s]tate[s]men, ignorant philo[s]ophers, and ignorant eccle[s]ia[s]tics. On this principle, Teague might have done very well as a preacher. But the [s]elfi[s]hne[s]s of the Captain prevailed, and ob[s]tructed his advancement. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] Containing preliminary Ob[s]ervations. I AM very happy in the compo[s]ition of this work; for though but of a trifling nature as to [s]entiment; yet, in what I do write, no one can attribute to me the lea[s]t tincture of [s]atire, or ridicule of individuals or public bodies. This is what I very much di[s]like in others, and would be far from indulging in my[s]elf. I acknowledge, indeed, that in my earlier years, and in the cour[s]e of my academical [s]tudies, I had contracted [s]ome ta[s]te, and even habit, this way; owing to my reading the dialogues of Lucian, in the original Greek. Had I read them in a tran[s]lation, they might have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] made le[s]s impre[s][s]ion. But by means of a difficult language, [s]tudying them [s]lowly, the turn of thought became more deeply impre[s][s]ed upon my mind. Moreover, afterwards, when I came to have [s]ome acquaintance with the modern wits, [s]uch as Cervantes, Le Sage, and e[s]pecially Swift, I found my[s]elf [s]till more inclined to an ironical, ludicrous way of thinking and writing. But finding the bad effects of this, in many re[s]pects, leading me into broils with individuals, and rendering me obnoxious to public bodies, I [s]aw the indiscretion, and bad policy of [s]uch indulgence; and have for [s]everal years pa[s]t, carefully avoided every thing of this kind. It is indeed acting but a poor part in life, to make a bu[s]ine[s]s of laughing at the follies of others. It is injurious to one's [s]elf; for there is a great deal more to be gained by soothing and prai[s]ing what men do, than by finding fault with them. It may be [s]aid of [s]atire, what was [s]aid of anger by [s]ome philo[s]opher, It never pays the [s]ervice it requires. It is your [s]cratching, rump-tickling people, that get into place and power. I never knew any good come of wit and humour yet. They are talents which keep the owner poor. For this rea[s]on, I have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] taken care to repre[s]s all propen[s]ity to this vice; and I believe I can [s]ay it with truth, that [s]ince I have come to the years of a man's under[s]tanding, I have carefully avoided every thing of this nature. Had it not been for this prudence, I [s]hould not have been in a fair way, as I now am, to be a member of Congre[s]s, or a judge on the bench, or governor of a commonwealth, or [s]ecretary of [s]tate, or any thing that I may have in view. Had I remained an admirer of Rabelais, or Sterne, or other biting, jeering writers, that I at fir[s]t met with, I might at this day have been considered as a wit only, without the lea[s]t advancement in [s]tate affairs. But I would [s]ooner [s]ee your Juniu[s]es, and your Peter Pindars, libelling kings and mini[s]ters, at hell, than [s]acrifice my intere[s]t to my passion, or my vanity, by [s]trokes of wit, which is but another name for ill-nature. In this treati[s]e, which is [s]imply a relation of the adventures of an individual, I have nothing to do with [s]trictures upon particular per[s]ons, or the affairs of men in general, and [s]o have no temptation to the folly I have ju[s]t mentioned. The reader, if any body ever reads it, will find [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] nothing here but philanthropic and benevolent ideas. Indeed, as it has been known that I was engaged in writing [s]omething, persons who either took, or pretended to take, [s]ome intere[s]t in my affairs, have urged me very much to depart a little from my usual way, and make u[s]e of a little irony, by way of [s]ea[s]oning to the compo[s]ition; for, in this ca[s]e, it would be received better, and procure more readers; mankind being naturally delighted with ridicule. But the truth was, I could [s]ee nothing to be ironical about; owing, perhaps, to my not being in the habit of looking for the ridiculous, and [s]o having lo[s]t the talent of di[s]covering it. But my re[s]olution that I had taken would have fully pre[s]erved me from [s]uch a lap[s]e, however numerous the objects of ridicule might be, that pre[s]ented them[s]elves. This will [s]erve as an apology to tho[s]e who have [s]olicited me on this head, and relieve me from [s]uch solicitations for the future. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] DETAINING [s]ome time in a village, there was a great deal [s]aid about a certain Mi[s]s Fog, who was the belle of the place. Her father had made a fortune by the purchu[s]e of public securities A garri[s]on having been at this place, and troops quartered here, he had been employed as an i[s][s]uing commi[s][s]ary! When the commi[s][s]ioners [s]at to adju[s]t unliquidated claims, he had a good deal in his power, by vouching for the accounts of the butcher, and baker, and wood-cutter, and water-drawer, and waggoner, and all others of all occupations what[s]oever, who[s]e claims were purcha[s]ed by him[s]elf, in the mean time, and when the certificates i[s][s]ued in their names, they were to his u[s]e. The butcher and baker, no doubt, long before had been paid out of the fle[s]h killed, or bread baked; becau[s]e it is a good maxim, and a [s]criptural expre[s][s]ion, "Muzzle not the ox that treadeth out the corn." But the public has a broad [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] back, and a little vouching, by a per[s]on intere[s]ted, is not greatly felt. The[s]e certificates, though at fir[s]t of little value, and i[s][s]ued by the commi[s][s]ioners with the liberality of tho[s]e who give what is of little worth, yet by the funding acts of the government, having become, in value, equal to gold and [s]ilver, the commi[s][s]ary had a great e[s]tate thrown upon him; [s]o that, from low beginnings, he had become a man of fortune and con[s]equence. His family, and e[s]pecially the elde[s]t daughter, [s]hared the advantage; for [s]he had become the object of almo[s]t all wooers. The Captain, though an old bachelor, as we have [s]aid, had not wholly lo[s]t the idea of matrimony. Happening to be in a circle, one evening, where Mi[s]s Fog was, he took a liking to her, in all re[s]pects [s]ave one, which was, that [s]he [s]eemed, on her part, to have taken a liking to a certain Mr. Jacko, who was there pre[s]ent; and to who[s]e attention [s]he di[s]covered a facility of acquie[s]cence. The Captain behaved, for the pre[s]ent, as if he did not ob[s]erve the preference; but the following day, waiting on the young lady at her father's hou[s]e, he drew her into conver[s]ation, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] began to rea[s]on with her, in the following manner: Mi[s]s Fog, [s]aid he, you are a young lady of great beauty, great [s]en[s]e, and fortune [s]till greater than either.---This was a [s]ad blunder in a man of gallantry, but the lady not being of the greate[s]t [s]en[s]ibility of nerve, did not perceive it.---On my part, [s]aid he, I am a man of years, but a man of [s]ome reflection; and it would be much more advi[s]eable in you to tru[s]t my experience, and the mellowne[s]s of my di[s]po[s]ition in a [s]tate of matrimony, than the vanity and petulence of this young fop Jacko, for whom you [s]hew a partiality. The colour coming into the young lady's face at this expre[s][s]ion, [s]he withdrew, and left him by him[s]elf. The Captain [s]truck with the rudene[s]s, withdrew al[s]o, and, calling Teague from the kitchen, mounted his hor[s]e and [s]et off. The next morning [s]hortly after he had got out of bed, and had ju[s]t come down [s]tairs at his lodging, and was buttoning the knees of his breeches, a light airy looking young man, with much bowing and civility, entered the hall of the public hou[s]e, and enquiring if this was not Captain Farrago to whom he had the honour to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] address him[s]elf, delivered him a paper. On the peru[s]al, it was found to be a challenge from Mr. Jacko. The fact was, that Mi[s]s Fog, in order the more to recommend her[s]elf to her [s]uitor, had informed him of the language of the Captain. The young man, though he had no great [s]tomach for the matter, yet according to the cu[s]tom of the[s]e times, could do no le[s]s than challenge. The bearer was was what is called his [s]econd. The Captain having read the paper, and pau[s]ing a while, [s]aid, Mr. Second, for that I take to be your [s]tile and character, is it con[s]i[s]tent with rea[s]on or common [s]en[s]e, to be the aider or abettor of another man's folly; perhaps the prompter: for it is no uncommon thing with per[s]ons to inflame the pa[s][s]ions of their frends, rather than allay them. This young woman, for I [s]hall not call her lady, from vanity, or ill-nature, or both, has become a tale-bearer to her lover, who, I will venture to [s]ay, thanks her but little for it; as [s]he has thereby rendered it nece[s][s]ary for him to take this [s]tep. You, in the mean time, are not blamele[s]s, as it became you to have declined the office, and thereby furni[s]hed an excu[s]e to your friend for not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] complying with the cu[s]tom. For it would have been a [s]ufficient apology with the lady to have [s]aid, although he was di[s]po[s]ed to fight, yet he could get no one to be his armour-bearer or a[s][s]i[s]tant. It could have been put upon the footing, that all had [s]uch regard for his life, that no one would countenance him in ri[s]king it. You would have [s]aved him by this means, all that uneasiness which he feels at pre[s]ent, lea[s]t I [s]hould accept his challenge. I am not [s]o unacquainted with human nature, as not to know how di[s]agreeable it mu[s]t be to think of having a pi[s]tol ball lodged in the groin or the left brea[s]t, or, to make the be[s]t of it, the pan of the knee broke, or the no[s]e cut off, or [s]ome wound le[s]s than mortal given; di[s]agreeable, e[s]pecially to to a man in the bloom of life, and on the point of marriage with a woman to who[s]e per[s]on or fortune he has no exception. I would venture to [s]ay, therefore, there will be no great difficulty in appea[s]ing this Orlando Furio[s]o, that has [s]ent me the challenge. Did you know the [s]tate of his mind, you would find him at prayers this moment, that I would ea[s]e his fears, and make [s]ome apology. A very [s]light one would [s]uffice. I dare [s]ay, his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] resentment again[s]t Mi[s]s Fog is not [s]light, and that he would renounce her per[s]on and fortune both, to get quit of the duel. But the opinion of the world is again[s]t him, and he mu[s]t fight. Do you think he has any great gratitude to you for your services on this occa[s]ion. He had much rather you had, in the freedom of friend[s]hip, given him a kick on the back[s]ide, when he made application to you; and told him, that it did not become him to quarrel about a woman, who had, probably, consulted but her own vanity, in giving him the information. In that ca[s]e, he would have been more plea[s]ed with you a month hence, than he is at pre[s]ent. I do not know that he has an over[s]tock of [s]en[s]e; neverthele[s]s, he cannot be ju[s]t [s]uch a fool, as not to con[s]ider, that you, your[s]elf, may have preten[s]ions to this belle, and be di[s]po[s]ed to have him out of the way before you. He mu[s]t be a fool, indeed, if he does not reflect, that you had much rather [s]ee us fight than not; from the very [s]ame principle that we take delight in seeing a cock-match, or a hor[s]e-race. The [s]pectacle is new, and produces a bri[s]k current of thought through the mind; which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] is a con[s]tituent of plea[s]ure, the ab[s]ence of all movement giving none at all. What do you [s]uppo[s]e I mu[s]t think of you, Mr. Second; I, who have read books, and thought a little on the [s]ubject; have made up my mind in the[s]e matters, and account the [s]quires that bring challenges from knights, as people of but very [s]mall de[s]ert. Thinking men have condemned the duel, and laws have prohibited it; but the[s]e mi[s]creants [s]till keep it up, by being the conductors of the fluid. My indignation, therefore, falls on [s]uch, and I have long ago fixed on the mode of treating them. It is this: a [s]tout athletic man calls upon me, with a challenge in his hand, I knock him down, if I can, without [s]aying a word. If the natural arm be not [s]ufficient for this purpu[s]e, I avail my[s]elf of any [s]tone, wooden, or iron in[s]trument that I ca[s]t my eye upon, not ju[s]t to take away his life, if I can help it; but to hit the line as exactly as po[s][s]ible, between actual homicide, and a very bad wound. For in this ca[s]e, I [s]hould conceive, a battery could be ju[s]tifiable, or at lea[s]t excu[s]eable, and the fine not very great; the bearing a challenge being a breach of the peace, in the fir[s]t in[s]tance. This would be my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] conduct with a [s]tout athletic man, whom I might think it dangerous to encounter with fair warning, and on equal terms. But in the pre[s]ent ca[s]e, where---(Here the [s]econd began to [s]hew [s]igns of fear, rai[s]ing him[s]elf, and inclining backwards, opening his eyes wider, and ca[s]ting a look towards the door)---where, continued the Captain, I have to do with a per[s]on of your [s]lender make, I do not adopt that [s]urpri[s]e, or u[s]e an artificial weapon; but with the[s]e fi[s]ts, which have been u[s]ed in early life to agricultural employments, I [s]hall very deliberately impre[s]s a blow. The [s]econd ri[s]ing to his feet, began to recede a little. Be under no apprehen[s]ions, [s]aid the Captain; I [s]hall u[s]e no unfair method of biting, gouging, or wounding the private parts. Nay, as you appear to be a young man of a delicate con[s]titution, I [s]hall only choak a little. You will give me leave to take you by the throat in as ea[s]y a manner as po[s][s]ible. In the mean time, the [s]econd had been withdrawing towards the door, and the Captain with out[s]tretched arms, in a sideway direction, proceeding to intercept him. In an in[s]tant, he was [s]eized by the neck, and the exclamation of murder which he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] made at the fir[s]t gra[s]p, began to die away in hoar[s]e guttural murmurs of one nearly [s]trangled, and labouring for breath. The Captain meaning that he [s]hould be more alarmed than hurt, di[s]mi[s][s]ed him with a salutation of his foot on the back[s]ide, as a claude o[s]tium, as he went out. You may be, [s]aid he, a gentleman in the opinion of the world; but you are a low per[s]on in mine; and [s]o [s]hall it be done to every one who [s]hall come upon [s]uch an errand. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] HAVING thus di[s]mi[s][s]ed the secondary man, he called in his [s]ervant Teague, and acco[s]ted him as follows: Teague, [s]aid he, you have heretofore discovered an ambition to be employed in [s]ome way that would advance your reputation. There is now a ca[s]e fallen out, to which you are fully competent. It is not a matter that requires the head to contrive, but the hand to execute. The greate[s]t fool is as fit for it as a wi[s]e man. It is indeed your greate[s]t blockheads that chiefly undertake it. The knowledge of law, physic, or divinity is out of the que[s]tion. Literature, and political under[s]tanding is u[s]ele[s]s. Nothing more is nece[s][s]ary than a little re[s]olution of the heart. Yet it is an undertaking which is of much e[s]timation with the rabble, and has a great many on its [s]ide to approve and prai[s]e it. The females of the world, e[s]pecially admire the act, and call it valour. I know you wi[s]h to [s]tand well with the ladies. Here is an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] opportunity of advancing your credit. I have had what is called a challenge [s]ent me this morning. It is from a certain Jacko, who is a [s]uitor to a Mi[s]s Fog, and has taken offence at an expre[s][s]ion of mine, respecting him to this female. I wi[s]h you to accept the challenge, and fight him for me. At this propo[s]ition, Teague looked wild, and made apology that he was not much u[s]ed to boxing. Boxing, [s]aid the Captain; you are to fight what is called a duel. You are to encounter him with pi[s]tol, and put a bullet through him if you can. It is true, he will have the chance of putting one through you; but in that con[s]i[s]ts the honour; for where there is no danger, there is no glory. You will provide yourself a [s]econd. There is an ho[s]tler here at the public hou[s]e, that is a brave fellow, and will an[s]wer the purpo[s]e. Being furnished with a [s]econd, you will provide your[s]elf with a pair of pi[s]tols, powder and ball of cour[s]e. In the mean time, your adver[s]ary notified of your intentions, will do the like. Thus apparalelled, you will advance to the place agreed upon. The ground will be mea[s]ured out; ten, [s]even, or five [s]teps; back to back, and coming round to your place, fire. Or taking your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] ground, [s]tand [s]till and fire; or it may be, advance and fire as you meet, at what distance you think proper. The rules in this re[s]pect are not fixed, but as the parties can agree or the [s]econds point out. When you come to fire, be [s]ure you keep a [s]teady hand, and take good aim. Remember that the pi[s]tol barrel being [s]hort, the powder is apt to throw the bullet up. Your [s]ight therefore, ought to be about the wai[s]t-band of his breeches, [s]o that you have the whole length of his body, and his head into the bargain, to come and go upon. It is true, he in the mean time, will take the [s]ame advantages of you. He may hit you about the groin, or the belly. I have known [s]ome [s]hot in the thigh, or the leg, or the private parts. The throat al[s]o, and the head are in them[s]elves vulnerable. It is no uncommon thing to have an arm broke, or a [s]plinter [s]truck off the no[s]e, or an eye [s]hot out; but as in that ca[s]e, the ball mo[s]tly pa[s][s]es through the brain, and the man being dead at any rate, the lo[s]s of [s]ight is not greatly felt. As the Captain [s]poke, Teague [s]eemed to feel in him[s]elf, every wound which was de[s]cribed, the ball hitting him, now in one part, and now in another. At the la[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] words, it [s]eemed to pa[s]s through his head, and he was half dead, in imagination. Making a [s]hift to expre[s]s him[s]elf, he gave the Captain to under[s]tand, that he could by no means undertake the office. What! [s]aid the Captain; you whom nothing would [s]erve, [s]ome time ago, but to be a legislator, or philo[s]opher, or preacher, in order to gain fame, will now detract a bu[s]ine[s]s for which you are qualified. This requires no knowledge of finances, no reading of natural hi[s]tory, or any [s]tudy of the fathers. You have nothing more to do than to keep a [s]teady hand and a good eye. In the early practice of this exerci[s]e; I mean the combat of the duel, it was customary to exact an oath of the combatants, before they entered the li[s]ts, that they had no enchantments, or power of witchcraft, about them. Whether you [s]hould think it nece[s][s]ary to put him to his voir dire, on this point, I [s]hall not [s]ay; but I am per[s]uaded, that on your part, you have too much honour, to make u[s]e of [s]pells, or undue means, to take away his life, or [s]ave your own. You will leave all to the chance of fair [s]hooting. One thing you will ob[s]erve, and which is allowable in this battle, you will take care not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] to pre[s]ent your[s]elf to him with a full brea[s]t, but angularly, and your head turned round over the left [s]houlder, like a weather cock. For thus a [s]maller [s]urface being pre[s]ented to an adver[s]ary, he will be le[s]s likely to hit you. You mu[s]t throw your legs into lines parallel, and keep them one directly behind the other. Thus you will [s]tand like a [s]ail hauled clo[s]e to the wind. Keep a good countenance, a [s]harp eye, and a [s]our look; and if you feel any thing like a cholic or a palpitation of the heart, make no noi[s]e about it. If the ball [s]hould take you in the gills, or the gizzard, fall down as decently as you can, and die like a man of honour. It was of no u[s]e to urge the matter; the Iri[s]hman was but the more oppo[s]ed to the propo[s]ition, and utterly refu[s]ed to be after fighting in any [s]uch manner. The Captain finding this to be the ca[s]e, di[s]mi[s][s]ed him to clean his boots and [s]purs, and rub down his hor[s]e in the [s]table. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] ON reflection, it [s]eemed advi[s]eable to the Captain to write an an[s]wer to the card which Colonel, or Major Jacko, or whatever his title may have been, had [s]ent him this morning. It was as follows: Sir, I have two objections to this duel matter. The one is, le[s]t I [s]hould hurt you; and the other is, le[s]t you [s]hould hurt me. I do not [s]ee any good it would do me to put a bullet through any part of your body. I could make no u[s]e of you when dead, for any culinary purpo[s]e, as I would a rabbit or a turkey. I am no cannibal to feed on the fle[s]h of men. Why then [s]hoot down a human creature, of which I could make no u[s]e. A buffalo would be better meat. For though your fle[s]h might be delicate and tender; yet it wants that firmne[s]s and con[s]i[s]tency which takes and retains [s]alt. At any rate it would not be fit for long [s]ea voyages. You might make a good barbecue, it is true, being of the nature of a racoon or an opo[s][s]um; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] but people are not in the habit of barbecuing any thing human now. As to your hide, it is not worth the taking off, being little better than that of a year old colt. It would [s]eem to me a [s]trange thing to [s]hoot at a man that would [s]tand [s]till to be [s]hot at; in as much as I have been heretofore u[s]ed to [s]hoot at things flying, or running, or jumping. Were you on a tree now like a [s]quirrel, endeavouring to hide your[s]elf in the branches, or like a racoon, that after much eyeing and [s]pying I ob[s]erve at length in the crotch of a tall oak, with boughs and leaves intervening, [s]o that I could ju[s]t get a [s]ight of his hinder parts, I [s]hould think it plea[s]urable enough to take a [s]hot at you. But as it is, there is no [s]kill or judgment requi[s]ite either to di[s]cover or take you down. As to my[s]elf, I do not much like to [s]tand in the way of any thing that is harmful. I am under apprehen[s]ions you might hit me. That being the ca[s]e, I think it mo[s]t adviseable to [s]tay at a di[s]tance. If you want to try your pi[s]tols, take [s]ome object, a tree or a barn door about my dimen[s]ions. If you hit that, [s]end me word, and I [s]hall acknowledge that if I had been in the [s]ame place, you might al[s]o have hit me. J. Farrago. Containing Reflections.

His ideas were drawn chiefly from what may be called the old [s]chool; the Greek and Roman notions of things. The combat of the duel was to them unknown. Though it [s]eems [s]trange, that a people who were famous for almo[s]t all arts and sciences, [s]hould have remained ignorant of its u[s]e. I do not conceive how, as a people, they could exi[s]t without it. But [s]o it was, they actually were without the knowledge of it. For we do not find any trace of this cu[s]tom in the poets or hi[s]torians of all antiquity. I do not know at what period, preci[s]ely, the cu[s]tom was introduced; or to whom it was owing; but omitting this disquisition, we content our[s]elves with ob[s]erving, that it has produced as great improvement in manners, as the di[s]covery of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] load-stone, and mariner's compa[s]s, has at navigation. Not that I mean to de[s]cant, at full length, on the valuable effects of it; but [s]imply to ob[s]erve, that it is a greater aid to government than the alliance of church and [s]tate it[s]elf. If Dr. Warburton had had lei[s]ure, I could wi[s]h he had written a treati[s]e upon it. Some affect to ridicule it, as carrying to a greater length [s]mall differences, than the aggravation may justify. As for in[s]tance, a man is angry enough with you to give you a [s]lap in the face; but the cu[s]tom [s]ays, he mu[s]t [s]hoot you through the head. I think the [s]maller the aggravation, the nicer the [s]en[s]e of honour. The heavie[s]t mind will re[s]ent a gro[s]s affront; but to kill a man where there is no affront at all, [s]hews a great [s]en[s]ibility. It is immaterial whether there is or is not an injury, provided the world thinks there is; for it is the opinion of mankind we are to con[s]ult. It is a duty which we owe them to provide for their amu[s]ement. Non na[s][s]cimur nobis ip[s]is; we are not born for our[s]elves, but for others. Decorum pro patria mori; it is a becoming thing to die for one's country; and [s]hall it not al[s]o be accounted honourable to throw one's life away for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] entertainment of a few particular neighbours and acquaintances. It is true, the tears that will be [s]hed upon your grave, will not make the gra[s]s grow; but you will have the con[s]olation, when you leave the world, to have fallen in the bed of honour. It is certainly a very noble in[s]titution, that of the duel; and it has been carried to very great perfection, in [s]ome re[s]pects. Neverthele[s]s, I would [s]ubmit it to the public, whether [s]till further improvement might not be made in the laws and regutions of it. For in[s]tance, could it not be reduced nearer to an equality of chances, by proportioning the caliber, or bore or the pi[s]tol; the length of the barrel, al[s]o, to the [s]ize of the duelli[s]t who holds it; or by fixing the ratio of di[s]tance in proportion to the bulk of combatants. To explain my[s]elf: When I am to fight a man of a [s]mall [s]ize, I ought to have a longer pi[s]tol than my adver[s]ary, becau[s]e my mark is [s]maller; or I ought to be permitted to come nearer to him. For it is altogether unfair that men of unequal bulk [s]hould fire at equal di[s]tances, and with equal calibers. The [s]maller [s]ize multiplied by the larger [s]pace, or larger pi[s]tol, would equal the larger [s]ize multiplied by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] the [s]maller [s]pace or [s]maller pi[s]tol. If this amendment of the duel laws [s]hould be approved by men of honour, let it be added to the code. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] NOT long after this, being at a certain place, the Captain was acco[s]ted by a [s]tranger in the following manner: Captain Farrago, [s]aid he, I have heard of a young man in your [s]ervice who talks Iri[s]h. Now, Sir, my bu[s]ine[s]s is that of an Indian treaty-maker; and am on my way with a party of kings, and half kings to the commi[s][s]ioners, to hold a treaty. My king of the Kickapoos, who was a Welch black[s]mith, took [s]ick by the way, and is dead. I have heard of this lad of yours, and could wi[s]h to have him a while to [s]upply his place. The treaty will not la[s]t longer than a couple of weeks; and as the government will probably allow three or four thou[s]and dollars for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] treaty, it will be in our power to make it worth your while, to [s]pare him for that time. Your king of the Kickapoos, [s]aid the Captain; what does that mean? Said the stranger, it is ju[s]t this: You have heard of the Indian nations to the we[s]tward, that occasionally make war upon the frontier settlements. It has been a policy of government, to treat with the[s]e, and di[s]tribute goods. Commi[s][s]ioners are appointed for that purpo[s]e. Now you are not to [s]uppo[s]e that it is always an ea[s]y matter to catch a real chief, and bring him from the woods; or if at [s]ome expence one was brought, the goods would go to his u[s]e; whereas, it is much more profitable to hire substitutes and make chiefs of our own: And as [s]ome unknown gibberi[s]h is nece[s][s]ary, to pa[s]s for an Indian language, we generally make u[s]e of Welch, or Low Dutch, or Iri[s]h; or pick up an ingenious fellow here and there, who can imitate a language by [s]ounds of his own, in his mouth, and throat. But we prefer one who can [s]peak a real tongue, and give more for him. We cannot afford you a great deal at this time for the u[s]e of your man; because it is not a general treaty where 20,000, or 30,000, dollars are appropriated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] for the purpo[s]e of holding it; but an occasional, or what we call a running treaty, by way of brightening the chain, and holding fa[s]t friend[s]hip. The commi[s][s]ioners will doubtle[s]s be glad to [s]ee us, and procure from government an allowance for the treaty. For the more treaties, the more u[s]e for commi[s][s]ioners. The bu[s]ine[s]s mu[s]t be kept up, and treaties made if there are none of them[s]elves. My Piank[s]ha, and Choctaw chiefs, are very good fellows; the one of them a Scotch pedlar that talks the Er[s]e; the other has been [s]ome time in Canada, and has a little broken Indian, God knows what language; but has been of great [s]ervice in a[s][s]i[s]ting to teach the re[s]t [s]ome Indian cu[s]tom and manners. I have had the whole of them for a fortnight pa[s]t under my tuition, teaching them war [s]ongs and dances, and to make re[s]pon[s]es at the treaty. If your man is tractable, I can make him a Kickapoo in about nine days. A breech-clout and leggins, that I took off the black[s]mith that died, I have ready to put on him. He mu[s]t have part of his head [s]haved, and painted, with feathers on his crown; but the paint will rub off, and the hair grow in a [s]hort time, [s]o that he can go about with you again. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] It is a very [s]trange affair, [s]aid the Captain. Is it po[s][s]ible that [s]uch deception can be practi[s]ed in a new country. It astonishes me, that the government does not detect [s]uch impo[s]ition. The government, [s]aid the Indian treaty-man, is at a great di[s]tance. It knows no more of Indians than a cow does of Greek. The legi[s]lature, hears of wars and rumours of wars, and [s]upports the executive in forming treaties. How is it po[s][s]ible for men who live remote from the [s]cene of action, to have adequate ideas of the nature of Indians, or the tran[s]actions that are carried on in their behalf. Do you think the one half of tho[s]e [s]avages that come to treat, are real repre[s]entatives of the nation. Many of them are not [s]avages at all; but weavers, and pedlars, as I have told you, picked up to make kings and chiefs. I [s]peak of tho[s]e particularly that come trading down to inland towns, or the metropolis. I would not communicate the[s]e my[s]teries of our trade, were it not that I confide in your good [s]en[s]e, and have occa[s]ion for your [s]ervant. It is a my[s]tery of iniquity, [s]aid the Captain. Do you [s]uppo[s]e that I would countenance [s]uch a fraud upon the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] public? I do not know, [s]aid the other; it is a very common thing for men to [s]peculate, now a-days. If you will not, another will. An 100 dollars might as well be in your pocket as another man's. I will give you that for the u[s]e of your [s]ervant, for a week or two, and [s]ay no more about it. It is an idea new to me entirely, [s]aid the Captain, that Indian princes, whom I have [s]een e[s]corted down as [s]uch, were no more than trumpery, di[s]gui[s]ed, as you mention; that [s]uch [s]hould be introduced to polite a[s][s]emblies, and have the honour to [s]alute the fair ladies with a ki[s]s, the greatest beauties thinking them[s]elves honoured by having the [s]alutation of a [s]overeign? It is [s]o, [s]aid the other; I had a red headed bricklayer once, whom I pa[s][s]ed for a Chippawaw; and who has dined with clubs, and [s]at next the Pre[s]ident. He was blind of an eye, and was called blind Sam by the traders. I had given it out that he was a great warrior, and had lo[s]t his eye by an arrow, in a conte[s]t with a rival nation. The[s]e things are now reduced to a [s]y[s]tem; and it is [s]o well known to tho[s]e who are engaged in the traffic, that we think nothing of it. How the devil, [s]aid the Captain, do [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] you get [s]peeches made, and interpret them [s]o as to pa[s]s for truth. That is an ea[s]y matter, [s]aid the other; Indian [s]peeches are nearly all alike. You have only to talk of burying hatchets under large trees, kindling fires, brightening chains; with a demand, at the latter end, of blankets for the back[s]ide, and rum to get drunk with. I much doubt, [s]aid the Captain, whether treaties that are carried on in earne[s]t, are of any great u[s]e. Of none at all, [s]aid the other; e[s]pecially as the practice of giving goods prevails; becau[s]e this is an inducement to a fre[s]h war. This being the ca[s]e, it can be no harm to make a farce of the whole matter; or rather a profit of it; by [s]uch means as I propo[s]e to you, and have pur[s]ued my[s]elf. After all, [s]aid the Captain, I cannot but con[s]ider it as a kind of contraband and illicit traffic; and I mu[s]t be excu[s]ed from having any hand in it. I [s]hall not betray your [s]ecret, but I [s]hall not favour it. It would ill become me, who[s]e object in riding about in this manner, is to give ju[s]t ideas on [s]ubjects, to take part in [s]uch ill-gotten gain. The Indian-treaty man finding it in vain to [s]ay more, withdrew. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] THE Captain apprehending that he might not yet drop his de[s]igns upon the Iri[s]hman, but be tampering with him out of doors, [s]hould he come acro[s]s him, [s]ent for Teague. For he well knew, that [s]hould the Indian treaty man get the fir[s]t word of him, the idea of making him a king, would turn his head, and it would be impo[s][s]ible to prevent his going with him. Teague coming in, [s]aid the Captain to him; Teague, I have di[s]covered in you, for [s]ome time pa[s]t, a great [s]pirit of ambition, which is, doubtle[s]s, commendable in a young per[s]on; and I have checked it only in ca[s]es where there was real danger, or apparent mi[s]chief. There is now an opportunity of advancing your[s]elf, not [s]o much in the way of honour as profit. But profit brings honour, and is, indeed, the mo[s]t [s]ub[s]tantial [s]upport of it. There has been a man here with me, that carries on a trade with the Indians, and tells me that red-headed [s]calps are in great demand with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] them. If you could [s]pare yours, he would give a good price for it. I do not well know what u[s]e they make of this article, but [s]o it is the traders find their account in it. Probably they dre[s]s it with the hairy fide out, and make tobacco pouches for the chiefs, when they meet in council. It faves dyeing, and be[s]ides, the natural red hair of a man, may, in their e[s]timation, be [s]uperior to any colour they can give by art. The taking off the [s]calp will not give much pain, it is [s]o dextrou[s]ly done by them with a crooked knife they have for that purpo[s]e. The mode of taking off the [s]calp is this; you lie down upon your back; a warrior puts his feet upon your shoulders, collects your hair in his left hand, and drawing a circle with the knife in his right, makes the inci[s]ion, and, with a sudden pull, [s]eparates it from the head, giving, in the mean time, what is called the [s]calp yell. The thing is done in [s]uch an in[s]tant, that the pain is [s]carcely felt. He offered me an 100 dollars, if I would have it taken off for his u[s]e, giving me directions, in the mean time, how to [s]tretch it and dry it on a hoop. I told him, No; it was a perqui[s]ite of your own, and you might di[s]po[s]e of it as you thought proper. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] If you cho[s]e to di[s]po[s]e of it, I had no objections; but the bargain [s]hould be of your own making, and the price [s]uch as [s]hould plea[s]e your[s]elf. I have [s]ent for you, to give you a hint of this chapman, that you may have a knowledge of his wi[s]h to po[s][s]e[s]s the property, and a[s]k accordingly. It is probable you may bring him up to a half Johannes more, by holding out a little. But I do not think it would be adviseable to lo[s]e the bargain. An hundred dollars for a little hairy fle[s]h, is a great deal. You will trot a long time before you make that with me. He will be with you probably to propo[s]e the purcha[s]e. You will know when you [s]ee him. He is a tall looking man, with leggins on, and has several Indians with him going to a treaty. He talked to me [s]omething of making you a king of the Kickapoos, after the [s]calp is off; but I would not count on that [s]o much; becau[s]e words are but wind, and promi[s]es are ea[s]ily broken. I would advise you to make [s]ure of the money in the fir[s]t place, and take chance for the re[s]t. I have [s]een among the prints of Hogarth, [s]ome [s]uch expre[s][s]ion of countenance as that of Teague at this in[s]tant; who, as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] [s]oon as he could [s]peak, but with a double brogue on his tongue, began to intimate his di[s]inclination to the traffic. The hair of his [s]calp it[s]elf, in the mean time had ri[s]en in oppo[s]ition to it. Dear ma[s]ter, vid you trow me into ridicule, and the ble[s][s]ed [s]halvation of my life, and all dat I have in the vorld, to be trown like a dog to de [s]avages, and have my fle[s]h tarn of my head to give to de[s]e vild ba[s]tes to make a napsack to carry their parates and tings in, for an 100 dollars or the like. It [s]hall never be [s]aid that the hair of the Oregans made macke[s]eens for a vild Indian to trat upon. I would [s]ooner trow my own head hair and all in de fire, dan give it to de[s]e paple to [s]moke wid, out of deir long pipes. If this be your determination, [s]aid the Captain, it will behove you to keep yourself [s]omewhat clo[s]e; and while we remain at this public hou[s]e, avoid any conversation with the chapman or his agents, [s]hould they come to tamper with you. For it is not improbable, while they are keeping you in talk, propo[s]ing to make you a Kickapoo chief, and the like, they may [s]natch the [s]calp of your head, and you not be the wi[s]er for it. Teague thought the caution good, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] re[s]olving to abide by it, retired to the kitchen. The maid at this time, happening to want a log of wood, reque[s]ted Teague to cut it for her. Taking the ax accordingly, and going out, he was bu[s]y chopping, with his head down; while, in the mean time, the Indian treaty-man had returned with one in Indian dre[s]s, who was the chief of the Killinoos, or at lea[s]t pa[s][s]ed for [s]uch; and whom he brought as having [s]ome recruiting talents, and might prevail with Teague to elope, and join the company. I pre[s]ume, [s]aid the Indian treaty-man, you are the waiter of the Captain who lodges here at pre[s]ent. Teague hearing a man [s]peak, and lifting up his head, [s]aw the leggins on the one, and the Indian dre[s]s on the other; and with a kind of involuntary effort, threw the ax directly from him at the Killinoo. It mi[s][s]ed him but about an inch, and fell behind. Teague, in the mean time, rai[s]ing a [s]hout of de[s]peration, was fixed on the [s]pot, and his locomotive faculties [s]u[s]pended; [s]o that he could neither retreat nor advance, but [s]tood [s]till, like one enchained or enchanted for a moment; the king of the Killinoos, in the mean time, drawing his tomahawk, and preparing for battle. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] The Captain, who was reading at a front window, hearing the [s]hout, looked about, and [s]aw what going on at the woodpile. Stop villain, [s]aid he, to the king of the Killinoos; you are not to take that [s]calp yet, however much you may value it. He will not take an 100 dollars for it, nor 500, though you make him king of the Kickapoos, or any thing el[s]e. It is no trifling matter to have the ears [s]lit in tatters, and the no[s]e run through with a bodkin, and a goo[s]e quill [s]tuck a cro[s]s; [s]o that you may go about your bu[s]ine[s]s; you will get no king of the Kickapoos here. Under cover of this addre[s]s of the Captain, Teague had retired to the kitchen, and en[s]conced him[s]elf behind the rampart of the maid. The Indian treaty-man, and the Killinoo chief, finding the mea[s]ure hopele[s]s, withdrew, and turned their attention, it is to be [s]uppo[s]ed, to [s]ome other quarter, to find a king of the Kickapoos. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] THE Captain was certainly to be commended in declining to countenance the impo[s]ition of making Teague a Kickapoo chief. Had he been di[s]po[s]ed to adventure in a contraband trade of this kind, he might have undertaken it as a principal, and not as furni[s]hing an assistant only. He could have pa[s][s]ed Teague for a chief, and him[s]elf for an interpreter. He might pretend to have conducted this prince from a very di[s]tant nation, and that he had been [s]everal moons in travelling, and wanted, the Lord knows how much, goods for his people, that otherwi[s]e would come to war. By this means, the Captain would have taken the whole emolument of the treaty, and not have been put off with a [s]mall [s]hare of the profit which another made by it. I [s]hould like to have [s]een Teague in an Indian dre[s]s, come to treat with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] commi[s][s]ioners. It would be nece[s][s]ary for him only to talk Iri[s]h, which he might pa[s]s for the Shawanee, or other language. The Captain could have interpreted in the usual words on the[s]e occa[s]ions. The policy of treating with the Indians is very good; becau[s]e it takes off a great deal of loo[s]e merchandize, that might otherwise lie upon our hands, and cuts away [s]uperfluities from the finances of the government; at the [s]ame time, as every fre[s]h treaty lays the foundation of a new war, it will [s]erve to check the too rapid growth of the [s]ettlements. The extremities of a government, like the arm or ancle of an individual, are the parts at which blood is to be let. Struck with the good effects of treating with the [s]avages, and that our wi[s]e men who conduct affairs, pur[s]ue the policy, I have been led to wonder, that the agricultural [s]ocieties, have not propo[s]ed treaties with the wolves and bears, that they might not clande[s]tinely invade our [s]heep and pig folds. This might be done by [s]ending me[s][s]ages to the [s]everal ur[s]ine and vulpine nations, and calling them to a council fire, to which four or five hundred waggon load of beef [s]hould be [s]ent, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] distributed. If it [s]hould be [s]aid, that this would re[s]train them no longer from their prey than while they continued to be [s]atiated, the [s]ame might be [s]aid of the Potawatamies, or other Indian nations; and yet we [s]ee that tho[s]e at the head of our affairs think it prudent to negotiate with them. A bear and wolf treaty might [s]eem an odd thing at fir[s]t; but we [s]hould [s]oon come to be accu[s]tomed to it. I [s]hould be [s]orry abu[s]es [s]hould prevail, by treaty-making men pa[s][s]ing rough water-dogs for bears, or ma[s]tiffs for wolves, upon our [s]ecretaries at war, or [s]ubordinate commi[s][s]ioners; which might be done as in the ca[s]e of the [s]avages, where it is pretended that [s]ome tribe that had not been at the general treaty, now [s]ends a chief to repre[s]ent them and to get goods. If our traders go among[s]t the wolves in con[s]equence of a treaty, I could wi[s]h they could check them[s]elves in the introduction of [s]pirituous liquors. A drunk wolf, or bear, would be a dangerous animal. It may be thought, that a bear or wolf chief would not get drunk, as it would be setting a bad example to their people; but I have [s]een Indian kings lying on the earth drunk, and expo[s]ing their nakedne[s]s, like [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] Noah to Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and if Indians that are a [s]ort of human creature, act thus, what might we not expect from a poor brute wolf or bear. If treaties with the wolves and bears [s]hould be found to [s]ucceed, it might not be ami[s]s to in[s]titute them al[s]o with the foxes. This is a [s]agacious animal, and particularly de[s]tructive to ducks and other fowls. It would be a great matter to [s]ettle a treaty with them, which might be done at the expence of nine or ten thou[s]and dollars laid out in goods. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] MEANING to remain [s]ome time in a certain town to which he came, the Captain had his hor[s]e put out to pasture, and took private lodgings. The fir[s]t day at dinner, he was [s]truck with the appearance of a young man who [s]at at table, but could not be [s]aid to dine with them; for except a little water, and a bit of bread, he ate or drank nothing; and though sometimes addre[s][s]ed, he made no an[s]wer. There was a [s]ettled melancholy in his countenance, and he often [s]ighed deeply. He had been in this hou[s]e [s]ix weeks, and had behaved uniformly in the [s]ame manner. In the evening he would walk by him[s]elf till midnight. Whence he came, or what [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] was his object, no one knew. He had be[s]poke a back room, and wi[s]hed to have one where there was but little light; al[s]o, that a little water, and a bit of bread might be [s]ent when he [s]hould require it. The landlady not chu[s]ing to have a per[s]on in the hou[s]e who was unwilling to be [s]een, declined the circum[s]tance of [s]ending in provi[s]ions to his room; but thought it proper he [s]hould come to table. He did [s]o; but entered into no conver[s]ation, tho' much pains was taken to engage him. He had paid his boarding regularly, and did not [s]eem to be in want of money. This was the account given by the family, when the youug man retired from dinner. The Captain's curio[s]ity was much excited; for being a philanthropic man, he found him[s]elf intere[s]ted in the hi[s]tory of this per[s]on. Taking an opportunity that very evening, when the young man was walking in the back porch, he joined him, and with the bluntne[s]s of a plain man, in[s]i[s]ted to conver[s]e with him. Sir, [s]aid he, it is from no motive of vain curio[s]ity, that I thus [s]olicit. It is from a di[s]po[s]ition to know and alleviate your griefs. For it is evident to me that [s]omething hangs heavy on your mind. I am a man, as you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] [s]ee, advanced in life, and have had [s]ome experience. It is po[s][s]ible it might be in my power to [s]ay or do [s]omething that might [s]erve you; at lea[s]t, it is my disposition to [s]oothe your melancholy. If it [s]hould be an unfortunate murder, the guilt of which lies upon your mind, you will find no accu[s]er in me; I [s]hall preserve a [s]ecret obtained in this manner. Probably it might have been a duel, and with [s]uch alleviating circum[s]tances, that though the law would take hold of it, humanity will excu[s]e. The young man finding the charge of murder, or [s]u[s]picion of it, ready to be fixed upon him, [s]poke. Said he, I am no murderer, but a murdered man my[s]elf. I am in love with a young woman of the mo[s]t cele[s]tial beauty, but of a cruel heart. The beauty may be more in your brain than in her face, [s]aid the Captain; for, as the poet [s]ays, `There are three, the `children of imagination, the madman, `the lover, and the poet. The madman `[s]ees more devils than va[s]t hell can hold; `the lover, all as frantic, [s]ees Helen's beau `ty in a brow of Egypt.' I am not unacquainted with the nature of this pa[s][s]ion; and have [s]een a gyp[s]ey my[s]elf, in my time, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] that have had dominion over me. Perhaps I may have been carried to as much extravagance as other people; and therefore am a proper per[s]on to advi[s]e again[s]t it. A principal [s]ource of my extravagance, was an opinion that the jade who had hold of my affections at the time, would pity me when [s]he heard of the pain which her beauty gave me; that [s]he would be afraid I would hang my[s]elf for her [s]ake; that [s]he would come to [s]oothe and care[s]s me, in order to prevent it. Far from it. My uneasiness was the proof of her power to wound; and the more di[s]tre[s]s I felt, the greater credit to her beauty. She would not have lo[s]t a [s]igh which [s]he cau[s]ed me for any con[s]ideration. My lamentations were as agreeable to her, as the groans of the damned are to the devil. And [s]o it mu[s]t be with every woman; becau[s]e [s]elf love induces it. Hanging is the la[s]t thing they would be at. If they could get the lover brought to this, they are then at the height of fame. It falls but to the lot of one here and there to have a man drown him[s]elf for her; and when it does happen, it makes [s]uch a noi[s]e that all covet it. I would venture to [s]ay, that this female whom you fa[s]t and pray about [s]o much, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] would be very unwilling to breathe the [s]oul into you, were it once out. In[s]tead of fa[s]ting, [s]he is eating; and while you [s]igh in the night, [s]he [s]nores. You have an opinion, perhaps, that you may bend her by your per[s]everance. That is a mi[s]take. A man that once comes to this [s]tate of [s]ighing, and dying, has but little chance; becau[s]e he has surrendered him[s]elf; and there is nothing more to be won. Were there any po[s][s]ibility of [s]ucceeding, it would be by fir[s]t conquering your[s]elf; di[s]mi[s][s]ing all idea of her partiality for you; for it is owing to this secret vanity, and [s]elf-flattery, that you [s]till pur[s]ue. Ab[s]olute de[s]pair is the fir[s]t [s]tep towards the cure of love. It is either drowning or curing, with you at pre[s]ent. As you have not drowned your[s]elf, you are in a fair way to be cured. I know very well how you mi[s][s]ed the matter with this hu[s][s]y. You appear to be a young man of great [s]en[s]ibility of feeling; and I pre[s]ume made your addre[s][s]es with great refinement of thought and manners. You talked to her of flames and darts, and flowers and ro[s]es; read poetry in the mean time, and thought a great deal of Phillis, and Amaryllis; and entertained her with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] names and incidents in romances, and [s]ung and recited [s]oft love [s]ongs about Amanda, and Phebe, and Colin; whereas your way was to have talked carele[s]s non[s]en[s]e, and [s]ung [s]uch [s]ongs as Pady Kelly, and Tri[s]tram Shandy-O; and told her [s]tories of girls that had run off with pedlars, or gone a campaigning with the [s]oldiers. The[s]e ideas are light and frolic[s]ome, and co-natural to [s]pringing love. Hence it is that men of but loo[s]e and irregular education, [s]ucceed better with the fair, than [s]cholars that are learned in the cla[s][s]ics. But to bring the matter to a point, the true way is to get another mi[s]tre[s]s; and profit by your experience with the fir[s]t. No more of [s]ighing and dying in the ca[s]e; but [s]inging, and laughing, and jumping like a young fox. Hint a little with respect to certain matters that are between the [s]exes; but let it be done in [s]o delicate a manner, that, though [s]he under[s]tands you, [s]he is not obliged to do it. What I mean, is to make her think you would rather debauch her than marry her. Bring her to this [s]u[s]picion, and I warrant you. Her whole [s]tudy will be to entrap you into matrimony. For it is natural for the human mind, when it ob[s]erves a great [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] [s]ecurity and confidence in another, to imagine there mu[s]t be [s]ome ground for it. It will argue a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s, on your part, of having as good or better in your power. It will impre[s]s her with the [s]ame idea; and imagination governs the world. When the mind is bent upon any object, it is relieved by the conver[s]ation of tho[s]e who under[s]tand it; and, as it were, di[s][s]olve with them in the [s]ame ideas. The young man was plea[s]ed with the conversation of the Captain, and [s]eemed cheared; agreed to join the family, and be a little [s]ociable. By degrees he became [s]o; and what by the conver[s]ation of the Captain, [s]ometimes explaining and sometimes ridiculing the pa[s][s]ion of love; and the young ladies of the family, in the mean time, rallying him on his weakne[s]s, he came a little to his [s]en[s]es, (for love is a phrenzy), and began to behave like a common man. For it having come out now, that love was the cau[s]e of his distress and [s]ingularity of conduct, [s]ome pitied him, and others rallied it with good humour and philanthropy. It had, however, become the general topic in the family, and was carried down to the kitchen among the [s]ervants. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] Teague hearing of it took it into his head that he mu[s]t be in love too; and counterfeiting a demure look, and absence of mind, and walking by him[s]elf, and living on [s]pare diet, as he had heard the young man that was in love did, he wi[s]hed to have it under[s]tood that his mind was under the dominion of the [s]ame pa[s][s]ion. This being ob[s]erved, was represented to the Captain; who being at a lo[s]s to know what was the matter, called Teague, and began to interrogate him. The bog-trotter, with [s]ome [s]eeming reluctance, acknowledged that it was love. Said the Captain, You in love, you great bear; with whom are you in love? That dear cratur, [s]aid the Iri[s]hman, that has the black hair, and the fair face, and her name is Mrs. Sally, in the hou[s]e there. She is a fair as the wool or the [s]now, and gives me the cholic, and the heart-burn, every time I look at her fair eyes; God [s]ave her [s]oul from damnation, but I love her as I do the very food that I ate, or the cloathes that I ware upon my back. It appeared to be Mi[s]s Sally, a very pretty girl, the elde[s]t daughter of the landlady; who, by the bye, I mean the ladlady, was a widow, and had two daughters [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] and a niece with her; the hand[s]ome[s]t of whom was this Mi[s]s Sally, with whom Teague had become enamoured. For simple and ignorant nature will fa[s]ten on beauty, as well as the mo[s]t in[s]tructed in the principles of ta[s]te. The Captain having been a good deal troubled, heretofore, with the preten[s]ions of this valet, in wi[s]hing to be a member of the legi[s]lature, a philo[s]opher, a preacher, and now a lover, thought he had now a good opportunity of repre[s][s]ing his presumption for the future. There was a young man, a brother in the family, who had been [s]ome time in the [s]ervice, as a lieutenant, and had leave of ab[s]ence at this time, on a vi[s]it to his mother and [s]i[s]ters. The Captain well knew, that being in the pride and heat of youth, he would con[s]ider Teague's advances to his [s]i[s]ter as an in[s]ult on the family, and chastise him accordingly. With this view, counterfeiting every po[s][s]ible di[s]po[s]ition to [s]erve the bog-trotter, the Captain recommended to him to make a confident of the brother, and endeavour to gain his interest with the [s]i[s]ter. Accordingly, one morning when the officer was in his chamber, Teague made [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] his approach; and compo[s]ing his woe begone countenance as well as he could, and explaining the cau[s]e of it, [s]olicited his interest with the lady. There was a whip in a corner of the room, with which the lieutenant had been riding; [s]eizing this ha[s]tily, he made an attack upon the per[s]on of the lover, in a manner far beyond what was decent or moderate. The valet retreating with considerable outcries, made complaint to the Captain; who gave him to under[s]tand, that as this outrage was committed by his intended brother in-law, it mu[s]t be considered in the nature of a family quarrel, and he could not interfere. The advances of Teague became the [s]ubject of conver[s]ation in the family, and of much mirth and laughter. The young man who had been in the [s]tate of melancholy before de[s]cribed, and had been cheered a little, was now in a great degree cured by the imitation of the valet. For ridicule is a better cure for love than pa[s][s]ion. It is better to make the patient laugh than think. Having now a di[s]po[s]ition to pur[s]ue his travels, the Captain [s]ent for his hor[s]e, and [s]et out. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] THE ob[s]ervations which we make when the narration of the fact is ended, are [s]omething like the [s]entiments delivered by the chorus in the ancient plays; a kind of moral on what was [s]aid; or like the moral as it is called to a fable. In this view therefore; we [s]hall endeavour to [s]ay [s]omething. The young man that we have [s]een [s]o deeply in love, was of a hand[s]ome personal appearance, and of an eye and physiognomy that indicated [s]en[s]ibility and understanding; and yet it is probable the female of whom he was [s]o much enamoured, may have been both homely, and de[s]titute of good mental qualities. Whence could a repul[s]e in this ca[s]e happen. From a thousand cau[s]es. We will [s]pecify [s]ome of them. The very circum[s]tance of his being beyond her fir[s]t hopes, may have put him beyond her la[s]t wi[s]hes. A female wooed by a man her [s]uperior, may be led to think [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] [s]he has [s]till a chance for better; and that there mu[s]t be diamonds in her hair, or [s]ome hidden advantages on her part, of which [s]he was her[s]elf ignorant; otherwi[s]e [s]uch advances would not be made to her; or [s]he may apprehend [s]ome defect on the part of the lover, of which he is con[s]cious; otherwi[s]e, he would not [s]toop beneath his natural expectations. It is po[s][s]ible the Amanda may not have been of the [s]ame cla[s]s and quality with him[s]elf. This would of it[s]elf account for the repul[s]e. Should the eagle come from the firmament, and make his advances to the phea[s]ant, he would find him[s]elf unsuccessful; for the brown bird would prefer a lover of her own [s]pecies: or, [s]hould the rein deer, which is a mo[s]t beautiful creature, woo a frog, the croaking animal would recede into the mar[s]h, and solace it[s]elf with a paramour of its own chu[s]ing. When, therefore, unexperienced young per[s]ons place their affections on an object, and do not find a [s]uitable return, they ought to [s]ave their pride, and make the inference, that they had descended from their element, and fa[s]tened on an animal unworthy of their notice. The[s]e ob[s]ervations, in addition to tho[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] made by the Captain to the young man, may be of u[s]e to unfortunate lovers; and if [s]o, it will be a recompence for the trouble we have given our[s]elves in making them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] IT was about an hour before [s]un[s]et, that the Captain fell in company with one who had the Cincinnati eagle at his brea[s]t, and riding on together, put up at the inn. The landlady and the [s]ervants, having never [s]een the badge before, were a good deal [s]truck with the effigy of the eagle, and the ribband at which it was pendant. Interrogating Teague, who had come in company, and whom they took to be a common [s]ervant to both, or at lea[s]t acquainted with the affairs of either, what was the meaning of that bird, or what bird it was, that the gentleman had at his brea[s]t? Teague knew as little about it as they did; but unwilling to be thought ignorant, took [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] upon him to inform them. It is, [s]aid he, a goo[s]e; and the maining is, that the [s]hentleman would ate a goo[s]e, if your anours would get one roa[s]ted this avening, for his anour to ate with the Captain, who is my ma[s]ter; for we have ate nothing all day long, and a roa[s]ted goo[s]e with a shoulder of mutton, a pace of poark, and bafe and cabbage, and the like, would be a very good [s]lake for a fa[s]ting [s]tomach. So, God [s]ave your [s]oul, dear honey, and make ha[s]te, and get a goo[s]e knocked down and put to the fire, to keep their anours from [s]tarving, and to go to bed in a good humour, when they have drank a cup of ale or a mug of cyder after the goo[s]e; and, ble[s]s your [s]oul, dear honey, let it be a good large fat goo[s]e, that there may be a rib or a wing left, that a poor [s]ervant may have [s]ometing to ate, at the [s]ame time. The [s]hentleman was very right to hold out a token, like the [s]ign of a tavern-keeper, with a goo[s]e, or a pigeon, or a turkey, that paple may know what he wants, and not be after the trouble of a[s]king whether he would chu[s]e roa[s]t bafe and parates, or pork and par[s]nips, may it pla[s]e your anour. The landlady was a good deal di[s]tre[s][s]ed, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] having no goo[s]e about the hou[s]e. But [s]ending out to her neighbours, [s]he made [s]hift to collect a couple of ducks, which Teague acknowledged would be a very good [s]ub[s]titute. Supper being ordered, the[s]e were [s]erved up, with an apology from the landlady, that [s]he had not been able to procure a goo[s]e; which [s]he hoped the gentleman with the ribbon would excuse, as [s]he was informed that a roa[s]ted goo[s]e was [s]o much to his ta[s]te. A roa[s]ted goo[s]e to my ta[s]te! [s]aid the officer; what rea[s]on have you to think that a roa[s]ted goo[s]e is [s]o much my choice? Surely madam you cannot mean wit, or to in[s]inuate that I my[s]elf am a goo[s]e? for one animal preys not upon another; the maxim is, dog will not eat dog. I cannot therefore be a goo[s]e if I eat one. Here the landlady explained her meaning, giving the information [s]he had received from the [s]ervant. The Captain was greatly irritated, and would have called him in and cha[s]ti[s]ed him in[s]tantly, had not the officer interfered; declaring that though it was an eagle, not a goo[s]e that he wore at his brea[s]t, yet he was not di[s][s]atisfied at the mi[s]take, in as much as it had brought [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] a couple of good ducks to the table, a fowl of which he was particularly fond. This incident, in it[s]elf laughable, led the officer to relate the trouble he had had with a clergyman who had made a wor[s]e mi[s]take than this, taking the eagle for a graven image, contrary to the injunction of the decalogue, which prohibits the making any [s]uch repre[s]entation for the purpose of wor[s]hip, as he alledged this to be. In an[s]wer to the clergyman, he had alledged the improbability that he who had been in the [s]ervice [s]o many years, at a di[s]tance from church, or church wor[s]hip, except when a dei[s]tical chaplain came the way, [s]hould think [s]o much of religion, as to have any wor[s]hip at all; much le[s]s to have become [s]uper[s]titious, and to wear an image at his bo[s]om. The truth was, that he wor[s]hipped any god, true or fal[s]e, very little; at lea[s]t, [s]aid few or no prayers, on [s]uch occa[s]ions; and was very far from being an idolater, and paying adoration to a gold or [s]ilver image; that this was nothing more than a hieroglyphic, being the effigies of a bald eagle, which is a native of America, and de[s]ignates the cau[s]e for which her [s]oldiery had fought; in the [s]ame manner as the eagle was the [s]tandard [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] of the Roman legion; or the lion and the unicorn are the arms of England, or the thi[s]tle that of Scotland; that the emblem of the American bald eagle had, on the[s]e principles, been cho[s]en by the Cincinnati for their badge; of which [s]ociety he was a member, and wore this device, not venerating it as the image of any bird or bea[s]t what[s]oever. The clergyman admitted, that, in strictness, this [s]ymbol might not be a graven image, as the term would intend engraving on wood or metal, with the point of an in[s]trument; and under this mental reservation, the wearer might [s]ave him[s]elf in [s]aying that it was not a graven image: but it was at lea[s]t a molten one, which comes within the meaning of the prohibition; being the repre[s]entation of a fowl, and doubtle[s]s for the purpo[s]e of idolatry. For what el[s]e could be the u[s]e or meaning of it. It was not a common broach, u[s]ed as a ligament to the [s]hirt or coat; and it was unworthy of a man to [s]uppo[s]e it could be worn merely for ornament; boys and petit maitres delighting in the[s]e things, but no one el[s]e. It could not be any [s]ort of time-piece, worn for the purpo[s]e of ascertaining di[s]tance. In fact, it was the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] portrait of a bird, the [s]ignal of [s]ome heathen deity; as the cock was [s]acred to Escalapius, the owl to Minerva, the peacock to Juno, and the dove to Venus. The eagle was [s]acred to Jupiter; and it was mo[s]t probable, that it was in honour of this fal[s]e god, that the image was worn. It an[s]wered no end to rea[s]on with the eccle[s]ia[s]tic; for he grew but the more enraged, and in[s]i[s]ted that it was an idol; [s]hewing from [s]ome texts of [s]cripture, that in the la[s]t times idolaters were to [s]pring up; and that this [s]ociety, which the Cincinnati in[s]tituted, might be the Gog and Magog [s]poken of in the Apocalyp[s]e. Said the Captain, It was natural enough for the clergyman to make this deduction; as in maintaining the cau[s]e of truth again[s]t Pagans, he is led to dwell much on the [s]ubject of idolatry. But for my part, the principal objection that lies with me against your in[s]titution, is that which lies again[s]t all partial in[s]titutions what[s]oever; they cut men from the common ma[s]s, and alienate their affections from the whole, concentring their attachments to a particular point and intere[s]t. A circum[s]tance of this kind is unfavourable to general philanthropy, giving a temporary and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] artificial credit to tho[s]e who are of the body, among[s]t them[s]elves; [s]o that while [s]ome lend character, others borrow; and the individuals do not [s]tand on the natural basis of their own merit. On this principle, I do not much approve of clubs and societies, unle[s]s in the ca[s]e of [s]ome humane or charitable in[s]titution; or for the purpose of carrying on [s]ome beneficial work or improvement. I do not know that in your conveening annually together, you have any object in view of this nature. I have not heard of any bridges you have built, or any canals dug, or locks made for the purpo[s]e of facilitating navigation. I do not [s]ee of what u[s]e your in[s]titution is; unle[s]s it be, that your pronouncing an oration now and then, may be favourable to eloquence. But of this I much doubt, as [s]uch ab[s]tract di[s]cour[s]es u[s]ually degenerate into common place. The great object of an orator is, to per[s]uade the judgment, or affect the pa[s][s]ions. In this ca[s]e, the judgment is already per[s]uaded, the affections already gained. Having therefore, no object, what exertion can the mind make? Be the cau[s]e what it may, certain it is that [s]uch compo[s]itions are [s]eldom or ever found to be models of eloquence; more [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] especially where the [s]ubject is of an exten[s]ive nature, as the revolution of America, and the [s]truggles of its heroes. For here [s]o wide a canva[s]s is [s]pread, that it is difficult to fill it up; and to take a particular part would [s]eem to be a dereliction of the re[s]t; for which dereliction no [s]pecial rea[s]on could be given. You could not embrace all the characters who have figured or have fallen, or catch at particular names of the illu[s]trious. Con[s]ining your[s]elf, therefore, to general ob[s]ervations, you make no particular impre[s][s]ion, and your orations become frigid to the hearers. I have felt the truth of all this, [s]aid the Cincinnati gentleman, and the difficulty of compo[s]ing an oration to [s]atisfy my own wi[s]hes. For being appointed by the society to pronounce one at our next meeting, to which I am now on my way, I have been trying my hand at it, and find it as you [s]ay, very difficult; but have attributed this, not to the nature of the compo[s]ition; but to the inferiority of my powers. Not [s]o, [s]aid the Captain; for in the hands of the greate[s]t ma[s]ters, this kind of compo[s]ition labours. We do not find that even the oration of I[s]ocrates, on the Lacedemonian war, which he was ten [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] years in compo[s]ing, has obtained [s]uch celebrity among the ancients, as [s]uch great labour would be[s]peak. I have read the panegyric of Trajan, by Pliny; and find it but a cold compo[s]ition. Plato's oration in honour of tho[s]e who had fallen in the battles of Marathon and Platea, is the be[s]t of this kind that antiquity can produce, and doubtle[s]s has great excellence of simplicity of painting. The touches are delicate and fine, and I do not know but we may place it among the mo[s]t beautiful productions. It amu[s]es with magic wildne[s]s of fancy, at the [s]ame time, re[s]trained and guided by an exqui[s]ite judgment. But it is rather a poem than an harangue. For though the compo[s]ition is in pro[s]e, yet it breathes the [s]oul of a bard, and is inchanting by the flow of the words, and the elevation of the images. In modern times, the be[s]t thing we have of this nature, is the panegyric of Cromwell, [s]uppo[s]ed to be written by the great Milton, but not delivered. The ingenuity di[s]covered in the mode of prai[s]ing him, de[s]erves every possible commendation. But the greater part of addre[s][s]es that I have [s]een to great men now-a-days, or orations on public [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] occasions, are turgid, or jejune, or little worth our notice. After this, [s]aid the Cincinnati gentleman, I [s]hall he[s]itate to [s]how you the e[s][s]ay I have made towards a compo[s]ition of this nature, as you appear to be [s]o good a judge in this re[s]pect, and to know the deficiencies that may appear in any effort of this kind. Nay, rather, [s]aid the Captain, you ought to be the more confident in [s]o doing; for knowing the difficulty of the work, I [s]hall be the more ready to excu[s]e what comes [s]hort of perfection. I [s]hall then take the liberty, [s]aid the Cincinnati gentleman, to read you a few paragraphs. I [s]hall be happy to hear it, [s]aid the Captain. The Cincinnati gentleman read as follows: Compatriots---I wi[s]h to [s]ay tho[s]e things that never have been [s]aid, and that never will be [s]aid again. Becau[s]e, in this ca[s]e, there will be the characteri[s]tics of novelty and [s]ingularity; the two great con[s]tituents of plea[s]ure, in all intellectual entertainments. But what can I [s]ay new? Has not the whole world re[s]ounded with the ju[s]tne[s]s of the cau[s]e in which we have been engaged; with the greatne[s]s of the attempt to with[s]tand the power of Britain? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] And have not we, our[s]elves, felt, [s]een, and known the great variety and change of good or bad fortune? What will it contribute to our immediate enjoyment to go over [s]uch [s]cenes, unle[s]s the particular achievements of each officer can be enumerated, which decency forbids, and which indeed, cannot be done in the limits of one harangue. Leaving, therefore, ourselves, and the[s]e [s]cenes, wholly out of the que[s]tion, let us [s]peak a little of tho[s]e whom we left behind. But why need we [s]peak; for all time will [s]peak of them. The bards that [s]hall live, will draw hence their choice[s]t allu[s]ions. Con[s]ider them, indeed, as more happy than you, becau[s]e they a[s]cended from among the group of their companions, who were at that time in[s]tant witne[s][s]es of their achievments. The warriors who fall in battle, are the mo[s]t glorious [s]ubjects of panegyric. Hector and Achilles, form the mo[s]t [s]plendid part of the [s]ong of Homer, and in a great degree, because their bodies were interred in the presence of the two armies. Oh what a noble object! an army mourning a brave officer, and tears drawn even from the foe, [s]truck with the [s]ublime of his per[s]onal prowe[s]s, and excellent knowledge of the military art. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] Much unlike, and far above tho[s]e who languish with [s]ickne[s]s on a bed in calm life, where relations [s]tanding round, wi[s]h the departure of the [s]hade, and gape for the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion which he leaves behind. But the fame of a [s]oldier none but him[s]elf can enjoy, there can be no heir or devi[s]ee of his property. It is his own, and it mounts with him. His blood only remains to ble[s]s the earth, from which flowers and ro[s]es [s]pring, and clothe the woods and groves with enchantment and delight. For here the [s]ong of poe[s]y is awakened, and at morn, and noon, and at [s]till eve, they are heard who rehear[s]e where the brave fell, and where they [s]leep. Sublime [s]pirits! whether you inhabit the Pagan ely[s]ium or the Chri[s]tian heaven, you are happy; and li[s]ten to tho[s]e immortal lyres which are [s]trung to the deeds of heroes. So much for the exordium of the oration; it was all he had yet written. The evening pa[s][s]ed away in hilarity; and the conver[s]ation turned again on the Cincinnati order; but particularly what may be called the arms of the in[s]titution, viz. Britannia repre[s]ented as a fine woman, with her bo[s]om bare, affrighted; and Cincinnatus, an accoutred knight, attacking her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] thus unarmed, as St. George did the dragon; the eagle, the bird of Jove, in the mean time gra[s]ping the lightning in his claws, an image that would [s]eem unnatural: Whereas the eagle might be represented in the clouds near Jove, where the lightning might be left to work its forked cour[s]e, without the handing of the eagle; and in the other figure, Cincinnatus might rai[s]e his lance again[s]t the lion that [s]upports the crown, not again[s]t the godde[s]s of the i[s]land. From the[s]e [s]trictures which the Captain, without pretending to be a connoi[s][s]eur, made, the tran[s]ition was ea[s]y to a criticism on the motto of the badge; viz. Omnia reliquit, [s]ervare, rempublicam. The infinitive is here u[s]ed in[s]tead of the gerund, with the prepo[s]ition, ad [s]ervandam; as if it was intended to expre[s]s his motion, or change of place, and not the object. But in fact, the motto does not at all express that in which the merit of Cincinnatus did con[s]i[s]t. It was not in his leaving every thing to accept the commi[s][s]ion of the Roman [s]enate; but in re[s]igning his commi[s][s]ion, and, the work done, going to his plough again. His prai[s]e would have been expre[s][s]ed better by the phra[s]e of, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] Victor ad aratrum redit. In fact, it cannot apply well to our army; mo[s]t of our officers not having much to leave when they accepted their commi[s][s]ions; but discovered a Cincinnati-like di[s]po[s]ition, in returning after war to the employments of civil life. It is true, there would have been le[s]s tin[s]el, and more bullion, in the patrioti[s]m of retiring without a badge, as Cincinnatus did: But it is a thing that can do little harm, and it is plea[s]ing to indulge a whim. It may doubtle[s]s be [s]aid, that there were officers that left the plough, and fought, and returned to it, as well as tho[s]e who are within the limitations of the institution, and entitled to a badge; that, troops who had [s]erved a [s]hort enli[s]tment, and militia per[s]ons, at lea[s]t tho[s]e who fought a little, were not wholly de[s]titute of [s]ome claim to the badge of merit. Even tho[s]e who lo[s]t property might be [s]aid to [s]uffer, and advance preten[s]ions to the reward of honour. Not that all of them [s]hould claim gold medals, or even [s]ilver; but [s]ome bra[s]s, [s]ome copper, pewter, a bit of tin, or pot metal, ju[s]t as the [s]pecific value of their [s]ervices might entitle them. Perhaps while [s]ome wore it at the brea[s]t, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] others might be enjoined to war it at the breeches pocket, and thus, as well by the point from which appendant, as by the bob it[s]elf, de[s]ignate the proportion of their honour. After this, [s]ome things were [s]aid on the [s]ubject of introducing honourary members; again[s]t which the Captain declared him[s]elf: That every thing ought to be pre[s]erved [s]ui generis; as nature makes no honourary animals; but all are of the species, or take not the name: a bear is a real bear, a [s]heep is a [s]heep; and there is no commixture of name, where there is a difference of nature. But it did not appear to be of any great con[s]equence, one way or the other. For the order would never come to any great head, as there was no oppo[s]ition given. For this is necessary to keep alive attachment to what is arbitrary, and founded, not in utility, but caprice. For as the fire dies without air, [s]o whim without contradiction. The officer was a man of liberality and good [s]en[s]e, and acknowledged the truth of this. But the evening being now far [s]pent, candles were called for, and they went to bed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] THE preceding pages were written several years ago; during which time the Captain has continued his travels: and having been favoured with his journal, I have occa[s]ionally made extracts, and put them in the form of a continued hi[s]tory. Whether I [s]hall publi[s]h any more, will depend on the reception of this. I had fir[s]t begun this work in ver[s]e, and have a volume by me, about two parts in three as large as Butler's Hudibra[s]s; from which compo[s]ition, I have extracted this; thinking it might be more acceptable in pro[s]e. When I vi[s]it this city next, I may produce that in ver[s]e, and let the people take their choice. It is a happine[s]s to a man to be able to amu[s]e him[s]elf with writing. For it is not every one that can play upon the violin, or the flute; and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] fingers mu[s]t be employed [s]ome way. I may be blamed in not chu[s]ing [s]ome subject worthier of my [s]tudies, and requiring a profound re[s]earch. It might profit the world more; but it would amu[s]e my[s]elf le[s]s. Omnis labor improbus; all toil is grievous. However, I have not been wholly inattentive to [s]everer [s]tudies. I have [s]everal law tracts by me; for which I mean, in due time, to [s]olicit a subscription. Nonum prematur in annum, in every work of moment, ought to be ob[s]erved. There are [s]ome light things which I may in the mean time throw out; a comparison of Thucydides with Livy; thoughts on the Egyptian hieroglyphics; on the Carthaginian commerce; a compari[s]on of the French and Engli[s]h eloquence; a [s]upplement to Buffon, containing a description of [s]everal genera of animals, not taken notice of by him; hints for the improvement of the micro[s]cope; on the u[s]e of the Ma[s]oretic points; on the recent origin of the earth; on the criminal code of the Siame[s]e, &c. If the world will excu[s]e the[s]e, I will give them my word for it, they [s]hall be troubled little more; for except the examining my law tracts, I [s]hall drop my pen, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] finding it, as I advance in life, more advi[s]eable to apply my[s]elf to making money. What things have been written, and are now lying by me, may occa[s]ionally [s]ee the light. It is a good deal owing to my [s]olitary re[s]idence in the we[s]tern country, at a distance from books and literary conversation, that I have been led to write at all. It was nece[s][s]ary to fill up the inter[s]tices of bu[s]ine[s]s. If I [s]hould remain in that country, the [s]ame circum[s]tances may lead me to write [s]till. If I [s]hould remove to this city, or the [s]eat of the federal government, I [s]hall avoid the tedium by other means. I wi[s]h the pre[s]ent book, to [s]ell for at lea[s]t as much as will defray the expence of printing; for I have no inclination to lo[s]e by it. If I had a little time to [s]tay in town, I could give it [s]ome celebrity by extracts, and remarks upon it; publi[s]hing for and again[s]t. For it is of no con[s]equence how a book is made famous, provided that it is famous. The truth is, as I have [s]aid, I value this book for little but the [s]tile. This I have formed on the model of Xenophen, and Swift's Tale of a Tub, and Gulliver's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] Travels. It is [s]imple, natural, various, and forcible. I hope to [s]ee it made a [s]chool book; a kind of cla[s][s]ic of the Engli[s]h language. In looking over it, I find in the whole work, but one word I would alter; it is near the beginning; where I [s]ay figure on the [s]tage, in[s]tead of appear, or make a figure on the [s]tage. I have carefully avoided the word unfounded in[s]tead of groundle[s]s, a word in vogue, among members of Congre[s]s e[s]pecially. The word commit, is good, but being lately introduced, and too much hackneyed, I have not u[s]ed it. Language being the ve[s]tment of thought, it comes within the rules of other dre[s]s; [s]o that as [s]lovenline[s]s, on the one hand, or foppery, on the other, is to be avoided in our attire; [s]o al[s]o in our [s]peech, and writing. Simplicity in the one and the other, is the greate[s]t beauty. We do not know at what time the Greek language began to be written as it was by He[s]iod or Homer. But we find it to have continued with little or no change, from that time to the late[s]t writers among the Byzantine hi[s]torians, a period of more than 3000 years. The Roman language [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] is con[s]idered as improving from the time of Ennius to the Augu[s]tine age. The language of the orators, poets, and hi[s]torians of that time is the [s]tandard. It was not [s]o much in the u[s]e of particular words, as an affectation in the thought, that Seneca is cen[s]ured as corrupting the language of the Romans. But Tacitus, after him, writes in a pure [s]tile; and I have found but one conceit in expre[s][s]ion, in his whole hi[s]tory: meaning to give the geography of a country of a certain tribe of the Germans; they are, [s]ays he, separated from the Sequani by mount Jura, from the --- by the lake ---, from the --- by the river ---, and from the Atabani by mutual fear. I do not find [s]o much fault with the [s]tile of Pliny, as the heaviness of his thoughts and expre[s][s]ions. However, the Latin [s]tile of writing retained its propriety and other excellencies tolerably well, till the monks got po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of it, and brought it down to a jargon that is now exploded; and we recur to the pure originals of Horace, Virgil, Cicero, and Sallu[s]t. The French language is corrupting fa[s]t; and not in the u[s]e of words, but in the affectation of [s]urpri[s]e, in the [s]tructure of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] the [s]entence, or the turn of the expression. Mirabeau was free from this; but not the Abbe Raynal. To give an example: meaning to [s]ay, which he might have done in a [s]imple manner, that about this time the Engli[s]h ca[s]t their eyes upon Goa, as a place where, &c. [s]tating the advantages of [s]uch a port; he begins by telling you, that the Engli[s]h had occa[s]ion for [s]uch a port, which, &c. enumerating the advantages; and after this, with [s]urprize comes upon you, and tells you, they wanted Goa. Enfin, [s]ays he; that is, in fine they wanted Goa. The Engli[s]h language is undoubtedly written better in America than in England, e[s]pecially [s]ince the time of that literary dunce, Samuel John[s]on, who was totally de[s]titute of ta[s]te for the vrai naturalle, or [s]implicity of nature. The language of the Scots writers is cha[s]te, but the [s]tructure of the [s]entence of the academic Dr. Robert[s]on, especially offends in this particular; his uniformity of period [s]triking the ear with the [s]ame pul[s]e, as the couplets of our rhyme in Dryden and Pope. Hume is before him in this re[s]pect, writing as naturally as a man [s]peaks; his [s]tile ri[s]ing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] and falling with the [s]ubject, as the movements of the mind them[s]elves. I am quite out of patience with this postscript. I have written it, the Printer informing me that he had a few pages of the la[s]t [s]heet to fill, which mu[s]t be left blank unle[s]s I had [s]omething more; but as I am in a hurry about [s]ome [s]mall matters, and have no di[s]po[s]ition to write, I believe I [s]hall conclude, and let him leave the remainder blank, or put in a paragraph of his own, if he chu[s]es it. It ju[s]t [s]trikes me to add, that I am this moment come from being admitted a Counsellor in the [s]upreme court of the United States; having written the preceding part of this po[s]t[s]cript ju[s]t before the court [s]at. In con[s]equence of my admi[s][s]ion in this honourable court, I feel my[s]elf in[s]pired with a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of new dignity, and am determined to relinqui[s]h the indulgence of all the[s]e light amu[s]ements, and apply my[s]elf for the future to fathom the profound depths of the legal oceans and rivers.

A man was [s]een before them, driving, lei[s]urely, a hor[s]e with two kegs upon his back. The Captain took him for what is called a pack-hor[s]e man, that was carrying [s]alt or [s]ugar to [s]ome place of market. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] A man of a philo[s]ophic turn of mind never he[s]itates to enter into conver[s]ation with any character; becau[s]e human nature is the field whence he gathers thoughts and expre[s][s]ions. The Captain therefore acco[s]ting this man, [s]aid, Is it [s]alt or molasses you have in your kegs, countryman? You are going home from [s]ome [s]tore, I [s]uppo[s]e, where you have purcha[s]ed; or going to [s]et up a [s]mall [s]tore of your own, and vend goods. No, [s]aid the man, with a Scotch-Iri[s]h pronunciation, there is an election this day a little way before us, and I am [s]etting up for the legi[s]lature, and have the[s]e two kegs of whi[s]ky to give a dram to the voters. The Captain was thrown into a reverie of thought, and began to reflect with him[s]elf on the nature of a republican government, where canva[s][s]ing by [s]uch means as this, can work [s]o great an evil as to elevate the mo[s]t unqualified per[s]ons to the highe[s]t deliberative a[s][s]emblies. But, in the mean time, rou[s]ed a little from his thought, he had pre[s]ence of mind to recollect the danger in which he was about to be involved afresh with his man Teague; whom, now looking round, he [s]aw to be about forty yards behind him. It would have been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] advi[s]eable to have diverted from the road, and taken a circuitous rout, to avoid the election ground. But as the devil, or [s]ome wor[s]e being, would have it, it was a lane in which they were, with a fence on each [s]ide; [s]o that he could not divert without leaping like a fox hunter, or one of your light-hor[s]e men, to which the sober nag on which he rode was not competent. Be[s]ides, if Teague did not leap after him he would be left expo[s]ed in the lane to the populace, who might [s]olicit him to be their repre[s]entative. To turn directly back would appear indecorous, and unle[s]s he could drive Teague on before him, which was not cu[s]tomary, and to which he might not, all at once [s]ubmit, his [s]tation would of cour[s]e be the rear, where he might be picked up as a straggler, and [s]ent to [s]ome public body. In this quandary of thought, looking up, he [s]aw the breakers ju[s]t a-head; that is, the people met for the purpo[s]e of electing, and that it was now impo[s][s]ible to avoid them. Depending, therefore, on his own addre[s]s, to make the be[s]t of circumstances, he [s]uffered him[s]elf to be carried along towards them, keeping, in the mean [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] time, an eye upon Teague, who was the cau[s]e of his concern. Meeting accidentally with a Scotch gentleman on the ground, whom he knew, he communicated to him the delicacy of his [s]ituation, and the apprehen[s]ions he had on the part of Teague. Said the Scotch gentleman, Ye need na gie your [s]el any trouble on that head, man; for I [s]al warrant the man wi the twa kegs will carry the elaction: there is na re[s]i[s]ting guid liquor; it has an unco effec on the judgment in the choice of a repre[s]entative. The man that has a di[s]tillery or twa in our country, canna want [s]uffrages. He has his votaries about him like ane o' the Heathen gods, and becau[s]e the fluid exhilerates the brain, they think he maun be a deity that makes it; and they fa' down, e[s]pecially when they have drank ower muckle, and worship him, ju[s]t as at the [s]hrine of Apollo or Bacchus, among the ancients. The candidate that oppo[s]ed the man of the two kegs, was a per[s]on of gravity and years, and [s]aid to be of good [s]en[s]e and experience in facts. The judgment of the people was in his favour, but their appetite leaned again[s]t him. There is a [s]tory of one Manlius, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] Roman, who had [s]aved the capitol from the Gauls, by putting his brea[s]t to the rampart, and throwing them down as they ascended. When this man afterwards, elated with the honours paid him, forgot the duties of a citizen, wi[s]hing to [s]ubvert the republic, by u[s]urping the power of a tyrant, the people, jealous of liberty, were incen[s]ed; and being convicted of the crime, he was dragged to puni[s]hment. It was not the way, at that time, to hang, as you would a dog; or behead, as you would a wild bea[s]t: but to throw from a high rock, which they called the Tarpeian. The capitol was ju[s]t in view, and while they were dragging him along to the place, he would [s]tretch his hand to this; as much as to [s]ay, There, O Romans, I [s]aved you: The populace at this would [s]top a while, irre[s]olute whether to de[s]i[s]t or drag him on. While they recollected his offence, they marched a [s]tep; but when they ca[s]t their eye on the capitol, they [s]tood [s]till; and not until [s]ome principal men directed the rout out of the view of the capitol, could he be brought to ju[s]tice. So it was with the multitude convened on this occa[s]ion, between the man with the two kegs and the grave looking per[s]on. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] When they looked on the one, they felt an inclination to promote him. But when again on the other hand, they [s]aw two kegs which they knew to be repleni[s]hed with a very chearing liquor, they [s]eemed to be inclined in favour of the other. But appetite prevailed, and they gave their votes in favour of the man with the two kegs. Teague in the mean time thinking he had another chance of being a great man, had been bu[s]y, but to no purpo[s]e; for the people gave their votes to the man of the two kegs. The Captain thought him[s]elf fortunate to be thus relieved, and proceeded on his journey. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] THE perplexity of the Captain, in the late tran[s]action on account of his man [s]ervant, may [s]erve to put tho[s]e in mind who travel with a waiter, not to go much about at the election [s]ea[s]ons, but avoid them as you would the equinoxes. It might not be ami[s]s, if, for this rea[s]on the times of electing members for the [s]everal bodies were put down in the almanac, that a man might be [s]afe in his excur[s]ions, and not have an under[s]trapper picked up when he could not well [s]pare him. I mean this as no burle[s]que on the present generation; for mankind in all ages have had the [s]ame propen[s]ity to magnify what was [s]mall, and elevate the low. We do not find that the Egyptians, though there were lions in the kingdom of Lybia, not far di[s]tant, ever made a god of one of them. They rather cho[s]e the cow kind, the [s]tork, and the crocodile, or the mu[s]k-rat, or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] miresnipe, or other inferior animal to deify. The Romans, and the Greeks al[s]o, often wor[s]hipped [s]mall matters. Indeed we do not find among[s]t any nation, that the elephant, or rhinoceros, or elk, or unicorn, have been made tutelar divinities. As, Cannons [s]hoot the higher pitches, The lower you put down their breeches. The [s]maller the objects we take up, and make them great, the act is the greater; for it requires an equal art in the formation of the gla[s]s to magnify, as to dimini[s]h, and if the object is not of it[s]elf [s]mall, there is no magnifying. Caligula is celebrated through all hi[s]tory for making his hor[s]e a [s]enator. It would have been nothing to have made a Roman knight one; but to endow a mere quadruped with the qualities of a legi[s]lator, be[s]peaks great [s]trength of parts and judgment. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] IT was about three o'clock in the afternoon that the Captain came to an inn, where unhor[s]eing and un[s]addling, Teague took the [s]teed, and the ma[s]ter went to [s]leep on a [s]opha in the pa[s][s]age. Unle[s]s it is in a very deep [s]leep, the mind is in [s]ome degree awake, and has what are called dreams. The[s]e are frequently compo[s]ed of a recollection of late events. Sometimes the mind recovers incidents long [s]ince pa[s]t, and makes comments, but mo[s]t u[s]ually, out of mere indolence takes up with what is next at hand. It happened [s]o on this occa[s]ion; for the Captain thought him[s]elf [s]till engaged with the Scotchman on the [s]ubject of the late election. It [s]eemed to him that he [s]aid, Mr. M`Donald, for that was the name of the Scotch gentleman, you do not [s]eem to have a high opinion of our republican form of government, when the mo[s]t indifferent can obtain the people's [s]uffrages. The Scotchman [s]eemed to an[s]wer in his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] own dialect, [s]aying, Ye are much mi[s]taken man, if ye draw that conclu[s]ion. I think there is a wor[s]e chance for merit to come forth where appointments are in the hand of one than when with many; for it is much ea[s]ier to [s]cratch the rump of one, than tickle the hurdies o' a thou[s]and. Ye [s]ee our executives dinna do much better in their appointments to judicial and ministerial offices, than the rabble folk themselves to the legi[s]lative. It all comes to the [s]ame thing in every government; the wind blaws, and the feathers and the fern get uppermo[s]t. At this in[s]tant he was awakened by a bu[s]tle out of doors. The fact was; a disagreement had taken place between Teague and the ho[s]tler at the inn, about their [s]kill re[s]pectively in rubbing down and currying hor[s]es. Teague had made u[s]e of a [s]ingle grab of hay, which he held with both hands, and impre[s][s]ed the hor[s]e, rubbing him from [s]ide to [s]ide, and up and down with all his might. The other with a wi[s]p in each hand, rubbed; the right hand pa[s][s]ing to the left, while the left hand passed to the right, in a tran[s]ver[s]e or diagonal direction. The ho[s]tler valued him[s]elf on having been groom, as he pretended, to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] [s]ome nobleman in England, and therefore mo[s]t be [s]uppo[s]ed to under[s]tand the true art of currying. Teague maintained his opinion, and way of working with a good deal of ob[s]tinacy, until at la[s]t it came to blows. The fir[s]t [s]troke was given by Teague, who hit the ho[s]tler on the left haunch with his foot, when he was stooping down to [s]hew Teague how to rub the fetlock. The ho[s]tler recovering, and seizing Teague by the brea[s]t, pu[s]hed him back with a retrograde motion, until he was brought up by a cheek of the [s]table door. Re[s]ting again[s]t this, Teague made a [s]ally, and impelled his antagoni[s]t [s]everal yards back, who finding at length behind him the [s]upport of a [s]tanding trough where the waggoners u[s]ed to feed, recovered his po[s]ition, and elanced Teague [s]ome distance from the place of projection. But Teague [s]till keeping hold of the collar of his adver[s]ary, had brought him along with him, and both were now on the ground [s]truggling for victory. But Teague turning on his belly, and drawing up his knees, was making an effort to rai[s]e him[s]elf to his feet. The other in the mean time, partly by the [s]ame means, and partly by retaining hold of the Iri[s]hman, was in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] attitude of ri[s]ing with him. They were now both up, locked fa[s]t in the gra[s]p of each other, their heads inclining in conjunction, but their feet apart, like mu[s]kets [s]tacked after a review, or like the arch of a bridge. The head of each [s]upported by the abutment of the feet. Few blows were given, and therefore not much damage done. But the per[s]ons pre[s]ent calling out fair play, and making a bu[s]tle in the porch of the inn, had awakened the Captain, and bro't him to the door, who [s]eeing what was going on, took upon him to command the peace; and the people [s]uppo[s]ing him to be a magi[s]trate, a[s][s]i[s]ted to part the combatants; when the Captain ordering both of them before him, made enquiry into the cau[s]e of the di[s]pute. Teague gave his account of the matter; adding, if he had had a [s]hillelah, he would have been after making him know that the paple in dis country, could curry a hor[s]e, or a cow, or a [s]hape, as well as any Engli[s]hman in de world, though he have been ha[s]tler to a great lord, or de king him[s]elf, at his own [s]table where he has his har[s]e. Teague, [s]aid the Captain, this may be true; but it was unbecoming a philosopher to attempt to e[s]tabli[s]h this by blows. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] Force proves nothing but the quantum of the force. Rea[s]on is the only argument that belongs to man. You have been the aggre[s][s]or, and therefore in the power of the law. But as to you, Mr. Ho[s]tler, you have given con[s]iderable provocation. I have had this lad with me [s]everal years, and I [s]ay that he curries and rubs down a hor[s]e very well. It is no uncommon thing for men of your country, to undervalue other nations, or tho[s]e retained by them. You naturally a[s][s]ociate your own attainments with the bulk and populou[s]ne[s]s of your cities: But can the looking at a large building, or a tall [s]pire, add an inch to your [s]tature? Becau[s]e Fox is eloquent, is every one that hears him [s]o too? Is not human ingenuity, the [s]ame here as on the other [s]ide of the water? Our generals have fought as well, in the late war, as any Clinton, or Cornwallis that you have. Our politicians have wrote, and our patriots have [s]poke as well as your Burkes, or your Sheridans, or any other; and yet when you come here, there is no bearing the airs of [s]uperiority you take upon yourselves. I wonder if the wa[s]ps, that are in your garrets in London, con[s]ider themselves better than the wa[s]ps that are in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] the[s]e woods? I [s]hould [s]uppo[s]e they mu[s]t; [s]uch is the contemptible vanity of an island, which, taking in its whole extent, would be little more than a urinal to one of our Patagonians in South America. This the Captain [s]aid to mortify the ho[s]tler; though, by the bye, there is a good deal of truth in the ob[s]ervation, that the people of an old country undervalue the new; and when they think of them[s]elves, conjoin the adventitious circum[s]tances of all that exi[s]ts where they have lived. I have found a prejudice of this nature even with the wi[s]e[s]t men. What wonder, therefore, that a poor illiterate ho[s]tler [s]hould be [s]ubject to it? But if he did undervalue an American born, yet he ought to have considered that Teague, though not born in Britain, was born near it, and therefore might con[s]iderably approach the [s]ame [s]kill in any handy-craft work. In natural hi[s]tory, we do not value animals on account of the place from whence they are taken, but on account of what they are them[s]elves; and in things that are made by hands, not by the manufacturer, but the quality. We prefer the trout of the rivulet, to the mullet of the river; and we judge of the pudding not by the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] maker, but the eating. There is a proverb that e[s]tabli[s]hes this; for proverbs are the deductions of experience, and to which we a[s][s]ent as [s]oon as expre[s][s]ed; containing in them an obvious truth, which the simplest under[s]tand.

That part of Livy which contains the combat of the Horatii, and Curatii, is frequently given to the students at a college to tran[s]late, that by this means they may be taught to imitate the like delicacy in the choice of words, and particularity of the recital. The above may an[s]wer the [s]ame purpo[s]e. It is true there is not the like incidents in this combat, as in that de[s]cribed by Livy; nevertheless, the [s]ame art is therein di[s]covered, as the [s]ound critic will ob[s]erve. I know it will be thought by any one who reads it, that he could u[s]e the very [s]ame words, and give the [s]ame liveline[s]s of picture, were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] he to attempt it.

I would ju[s]t a[s]k this que[s]tion; Is not the talent of the arti[s]t [s]hewn as much in painting a fly, as a waggon-wheel. If this were intended as a book of morals, or phy[s]iology, and not as a mere belles lettres compo[s]ition, there might be something [s]aid;---as the ca[s]e is, critics mu[s]t be [s]ilent.

Towards evening, when the [s]hadows of the trees began to be very long, the Captain bidding Teague trot along [s]ide, addressed him in the following words:--- Teague, [s]aid he, it is true I am none of your knight-errants, who u[s]ed to ride about the world relieving fair dam[s]els, and killing giants, and lying out in woods, and fore[s]ts, without a hou[s]e, or even tentcloth over their heads, to protect them from the night air. Neverthele[s]s, as in [s]ome [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] re[s]pects my equipment, and [s]allying forth re[s]embles a knight-errant, and you a [s]quire, would it be ami[s]s, ju[s]t for a frolick, to ly out a night or two, that it might be [s]aid that we have done the like. There is no great danger of wolves or bears, for while there are [s]heep, or pigs to be got at, they will [s]hun human fle[s]h. It will make a good chapter in our journal, to de[s]cribe you lying at the foot of an oak tree, and me with my head upon my saddle, under another; the hor[s]e, in the mean time, feeding at a [s]mall di[s]tance. Teague thought it would be an ea[s]ier matter to write down the chapter in the journal, than ly under the trees to beget it. It is true, [s]aid the Captain, navigators and travellers, make many a fiction; and tho[s]e who have been in battle have killed many, that were killed by others, or have not been killed at all. But it would ill become a limb of chivalry to deviate from the truth. It will be but about twelve hours [s]ervice lying on our backs and looking up to the [s]tars, hearing the howling of wolves, and ob[s]erving the great bear in the heavens, the means by which the Chaldeans, the fir[s]t a[s]tronomers, laid the foundation of the [s]cience. Fait, and I tink, [s]aid Teague, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] it would be better to be in a good hou[s]e, with a [s]houlder of mutton to ate before we go to [s]lape, than to have our own shoulders tarn by the bears, or bru[s]ed by lying under great oaks. Of what u[s]e is this astranomy? did any of the[s]e a[s]tranamers ever [s]hoot down a bear in the firmament, to get a joint of mate for a [s]ick per[s]on; and what good comes of lying in de woods, to be ate up by the [s]nakes; but [s]evers, and agues, and [s]ore troats, to get a long cough, and die in a ditch like a dead hor[s]e, and be nothing thought of, but be trown into ridicule like a black-head that has no [s]en[s]e. It is better to go to a hou[s]e and get a bed to [s]lape in, and warm [s]hates about us, than be lying in the dew like a frag, crocking the next day like one of da[s]e, and get no good by it. The Captain had made the propo[s]ition merely to divert him[s]elf with Teague, and [s]o did not in[s]i[s]t upon it. Riding one or two miles, the [s]un was [s]etting, and a hou[s]e appeared in view a little off the road. A lane led up to it with a meadow on one [s]ide, and a pa[s]ture field on the other. On this la[s]t, there were cattle of cows, and [s]heep grazing. The hou[s]e in front, was a frame building, re[s]pectable [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] in appearance, from the height, and dimensions, but ancient. There was a considerable extent of clear ground around it, and an orchard hard by, with at lea[s]t five hundred apple-trees. Having lodged chiefly at inns [s]ince his fir[s]t [s]etting out, the Captain had the curiosity to diver[s]ify his travels, by lodging at a private hou[s]e this evening. Accordingly riding up to the door, and calling out Halloa, which is the note of interrogation which is u[s]ed when a man wi[s]hes the ma[s]ter or mi[s]tre[s]s of a family, or [s]ome one of the [s]ervants, to come forth, to know what he wants. It happened that the mi[s]tre[s]s her[s]elf came to the door, and [s]eeing a good looking man, in a green old age, [s]itting on hor[s]e-back, with his [s]ervant ready to take care of his [s]teed [s]hould he think proper to di[s]mount, [s]he made a low curt[s]ey, as much as to [s]ay, Sir, I [s]hould be happy to know, in what manner I can [s]erve you. Madam, [s]aid the Captain, to tell you the truth, the night is drawing on, and I have been reflecting with my[s]elf, whether to lodge in the woods, or take a hou[s]e. All things con[s]idered, I have thought it mo[s]t advi[s]eable to take a hou[s]e, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] only que[s]tion that now remains is, whether I can get one. The lady [s]miling with much complacency, and inclining her head forward, and her middle back, replied, I [s]hould be happy, Sir, if this [s]mall man[s]ion could afford you an accomodation worthy of your [s]uite. Madam, [s]aid the Captain, I [s]hall be happy if the gue[s]t can be worthy of the accommodation. Alight, Sir, [s]aid the lady, we [s]hall be happy to receive you. Having alighted, he was introduced to a very decent apartment, where the lady [s]eating her[s]elf in a large cu[s]hioned chair, and pulling out her box, took a pinch of [s]nuff, and laid the box upon the cu[s]hion. She was a good looking woman, being about fifty-[s]even years of age, with gray hairs, but a green fillet on her left eye-brow, as it [s]eems the eye on that [s]ide was [s]ubject to a defluction of rheum, which made it expedient tocover it. It could not be [s]aid that her teeth were bad, becau[s]e [s]he had none. If [s]he wanted the ro[s]e on her cheek, [s]he had it on her no[s]e, [s]o that it all came to the [s]ame thing. Nothing could be [s]aid again[s]t her chin, but it u[s]ed her mouth ill in getting above it. She was not very tall, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] what [s]he wanted in height, [s]he made up in breadth; [s]o that multiplying one dimen[s]ion by the other, [s]he might be con[s]idered as a very [s]izeable woman. After conver[s]ing a little while, the lady withdrew, to give directions in the kitchen what to provide for [s]upper. The Captain in the mean time taking up a pipe, which he [s]aw on the mantlepiece, amu[s]ed him[s]elf with a whiff. The old lady in the mean time was in the kitchen, and the fir[s]t thing [s]he observed was Teague, reclining in an angle of the chimney fa[s]t a[s]leep. Con[s]idering him inattentive to his ma[s]ter's hor[s]e which had been [s]ent to the [s]table, [s]he de[s]ired a servant to give him a jog, and wake him. Teague, awaking, [s]aw the old lady, and be[s]poke her. Dear madam, what a great happine[s]s it is for poor [s]harvants to have gentle folks about them? God ble[s]s your anours lady[s]hip; you are ju[s]t for all the world like my cou[s]in Shala Shagney, the honsomest woman in all Ireland, and was married to Shan Cro[s][s]an, who had a great estate, and a flock of [s]hape into the bargain. She u[s]ed to [s]ay to me when I was a[s]lape, Teague are you awake; and when I was awake, Teague are you a[s]lape, dear honey. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] There is [s]omething in an Iri[s]hman which has an admirable effect upon the fair; whether it is owing to that love creating lustiness of per[s]on, and fre[s]hne[s]s of complexion which they u[s]ually po[s][s]e[s]s; or the delicacy and quantum of the flattery of which they are not niggardly; nor need they be [s]o, no per[s]ons having a greater [s]tock to come and go upon. For [s]o it was, that the language of the bog trotter, had gained the good will of this [s]ame Hecuba, and [s]he ordered him a tankard of metheglim, to make himself merry with the [s]ervants. Returning to the parlour [s]he continued her conver[s]ation with the Captain; but her mind running upon Teague [s]he could not avoid introducing his name, with a view to learn [s]ome particulars of his hi[s]tory. This is a civil young man, [s]aid [s]he, that came with you, and of a conver[s]ation above ordinary per[s]ons. The Captain being an ob[s]erver of the pa[s][s]ions of the mind, as they expre[s]s them[s]elves in the eye and a[s]pect, [s]aw that Teague had made [s]ome impre[s][s]ion on the affections of this goodly old maiden gentlewoman: Nor was he di[s]plea[s]ed with it; for his fir[s]t alarm was, that [s]he would have fa[s]tened on him[s]elf; but her pa[s][s]ion taking this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] cour[s]e, would be le[s]s trouble[s]ome. Framing his an[s]wers therefore to her que[s]tions, with a view to favour what had [s]o fortunately commenced, he gave her to understand, that, though in the di[s]gui[s]e of a [s]ervant, Teague was no incon[s]iderable per[s]onage; that he had been a member of Congre[s]s one or two years; though, by the bye, this was [s]tretching the matter a little, as he had only had it in his power to be one. But if it is allowable to [s]train a point at all, it is in the recommendation of one who [s]tands well enough already; for not being taken on the recommendation, there is no deception; and it is but civility to make one more plea[s]ed with their choice, than they already are. The Captain [s]aid nothing of his having preached, or being about to preach; for the idea of [s]ermons, and catechi[s]ms, impressing the mind with religious awe, is unfavourable to love. As to his being a member of the philo[s]ophical [s]ociety, it could be neither here nor there with a lady, and therefore he was [s]ilent with re[s]pect to this al[s]o. Supper being brought in, they [s]at down; but little conver[s]ation pa[s][s]ed; the mind of the enamorata being more in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] kitchen than in the parlour. After [s]upper, the Captain [s]itting [s]ometime, and [s]eeming drow[s]y, was a[s]ked by his ho[s]te[s]s, if he cho[s]e to go to bed: An[s]wering in the affirmative, a [s]ervant waited with a candle; and bidding her good night, he was lighted to his chamber. No [s]ooner had he withdrawn, but the old lady [s]ent her compliments to Teague, to take a [s]eat in the parlour; where [s]itting down to a roa[s]ted duck, ju[s]t brought in, a few [s]lices of gammon on a plate, a piece of veal, and a couple of roa[s]ted potatoes, he was de[s]ired to partake: the old lady ca[s]ting amourous looks at him, in the mean time. I [s]ay looks; for though [s]he had but one eye to look with, yet looking often, [s]he might be [s]aid to ca[s]t looks. It was a new thing to the Irishman, to be at a table with a [s]ervant at his back; and he began now to think that fortune meant to do him ju[s]tice: and with an ea[s]e, and [s]elf-po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, which [s]ome would call affrontery, he did the honours of the table; helping him[s]elf, and talking as fa[s]t as con[s]i[s]ted with his di[s]po[s]ition to [s]atisfy his appetite. May it plea[s]e your lady[s]hip, [s]aid he, I am a poor [s]harvant now, but I have [s]een the time, when I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] have ate at as good a table as the Captain my ma[s]ter, though he rides upon a hor[s]e and I trot on foot. My uncle, by the mother's [s]ide, Shan O'Gan, had a deer park, and kept race-hor[s]es, to go to de fair, and the city of Cork; and my father's brother, Phelim O'Regan, was a ju[s]tice of the pace, and hung paple for [s]taleing [s]hape. I might have been a member of parliament, if I had [s]taid at home and went to [s]chool; but [s]ending a challenge, and fighting wid my own dear cousin Denis O'Conelly, I had to fly de kingdom, and brought noting wid me but my brogs, and ten guineas in my pur[s]e; and am now noting but a poor [s]harvant, unle[s]s your lady[s]hip would take pity upon me, and marry me; for I am wary of this way of tratting after a crazy Captain, that has no [s]en[s]e to curry his own har[s]e; and I have to fight duels for him, and keep him from being knocked down like a brute ba[s]te; for dis very day, when he had a quarrel wid a ha[s]tler, and was trown upon his back, I lifted him up, and [s]aid, Dear honey, are you dead? took de ha[s]tler by de troat, and choaked him, and he could not [s]pake, but [s]aid, Dear shentlemen, [s]pare my life; [s]o dat if your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] ladyship will take me to your[s]elf, I will [s]tay wid you, and take care of de har[s]es, and cows, and de [s]hape, and plant parates, and [s]lape wid you, and a[s]k not a farthing, but your own [s]weat [s]elf into de bargain; for you are de beauty of de world; and fasting or [s]laping, I could take you to my arms, dear crature, and be happy wid you. The lady was by this time entirely won, and gave him to under[s]tand, that in the morning, after con[s]ulting a friend or two, the marriage might be celebrated. I give only a [s]ketch of the court[s]hip that took place, for a great deal was [s]aid; and it was near midnight before the lovers could prevail upon them[s]elves to part; when Teague was lighted to his bed, and had as good as that in which the Captain [s]lept, which was a new thing to him; being accu[s]tomed to pig in with ho[s]tlers and [s]ervants, at the places where they lodged. The Captain was up early in the morning, and a[s]toni[s]hed not to find Teague stiring, but enquiring of the [s]ervants where Teague [s]lept, he was [s]hewn up a pair of [s]tairs, which he a[s]cended, thinking he had one or two more to a[s]cend before he reached the garret. But what was his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] astonishment, when he was [s]hewn into a room on the [s]econd floor, where he found Teague [s]noring on a feather bed with curtains. Waking him, Teague; [s]aid he, this goes beyond all your former impudence; to crawl up out of the kitchen, and get into a feather bed. Plea[s]e your anour, [s]aid Teague, to ring a bell, and call up a [s]harvant, to bring boots, and [s]lippers; for I am to be married dis marning. The Captain was thunder-[s]truck; and comprehending the whole of what had taken place, [s]aw his faux pas in recommending him to the ho[s]te[s]s; and now it only remained, to cure the blunder he had made, if it was at all curable. We are [s]hort [s]ighted mortals; and while we [s]top one leak, the water ru[s]hes in at another. The very means that we u[s]e to [s]ave our[s]elves from one evil, leads us to a wor[s]e. The Captain had need on this occa[s]ion of all his addre[s]s. Compo[s]ing him[s]elf, he di[s][s]embled, and [s]poke as follows: Teague, [s]aid he, will you that are a young man, and have great pro[s]pects before you, con[s]ign your[s]elf to the arms of an old woman. Her breath will kill you in the cour[s]e of a fortnight. The fact is, [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] is a witch, and inchantre[s]s; [s]he made the [s]ame propo[s]ition to me la[s]t night, of marrying me; but I declined it. The world is full of the[s]e [s]ort of cattle. There was one Shagne[s]a Circe, in old times, that used to gather all [s]he could into her net, and transform them into hogs. Sir Teague Uly[s][s]es was the only one that had the [s]en[s]e to keep clear of her mu[s]ic, and avoid her. Did you [s]ee that drove of hogs before the door, when we rode up la[s]t evening. They are nothing more than [s]tragglers which [s]he has transformed into [s]wine. I did not [s]leep a wink la[s]t night, thinking of the danger to which you were expo[s]ed, and indeed I expected nothing le[s]s, than to find you this morning a barrow, fattened up for a fea[s]t, a day or two hence. Did you think [s]uch an old haridan as this can have any natural concupi[s]cence for a man; or if [s]he has, it is for a few days only, until [s]he can make him fit for [s]laughter. Then by throwing a little water on him, or by the bare blowing of her breath, [s]he makes a beefcow, or hog-meat of him, and he finds the knife at his throat, and [s]calding water taking off his bri[s]tles, and his guts out, and is into the pickling-tub before he knows what he is about. Do you think, Teague, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] that I have read books for nothing? Have you not [s]een me in my [s]tudy, morning and night, looking over Greek, and Hebrew letters, like partridge tracks? All this to find out what was going on up and down the world. Many a hi[s]tory of witches, and conjurers, I have read, and know them when I [s]ee them, ju[s]t as I would my own [s]heep, when I am at home. Better indeed, for unle[s]s my [s]heep are marked, I could not know them; but marked or not marked, I know witches; and if I am not mi[s]taken, this is the greate[s]t witch that ever run. She was all night in my room, in the [s]hape of a cat. It is God's mercy, that [s]he had not changed her[s]elf into an alligator, and eat you up before the morning. When I came into the room I expected to find nothing el[s]e but bones, and particles of hair, the remnant of her repast; but it [s]eems [s]he has thought you not fat enough, and has given you a day or two to run, to improve your fle[s]h, and take the [s]alt better. The wor[s]t thing, after transformation, is the having you cut, in order to make you fatter and better pork, which is generally done the fir[s]t day; and ca[s]tration is a painful operation, be[s]ides the lo[s]s of the part. I have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] had [s]everal of my acquaintances [s]erved in this manner, falling in with old women whom they took for fortunes; but were in reality witches, and had dealings with the devil. Teague by this time was out of bed, and had dre[s][s]ed him[s]elf in his overalls and [s]hort coat, and was ready for a march. Indeed he wi[s]hed to e[s]cape as [s]oon as po[s][s]ible; and de[s]cending the [s]tairs, going to the [s]table, and [s]addling the hor[s]e, they both [s]et out, without taking leave. It was in this manner Eneas quitted Dido, and got a [s]hip-board, before [s]he was awake; and the only difference was, that Teague had left no little Iulus in the hall, to put her in mind of the father. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] TRAVELLING along, the Captain could not but ob[s]erve to Teague, the injudicious choice he was about to make, even had the woman not been a necromancer. For the man who [s]urrenders him[s]elf to the arms of a [s]uperannuated female, for the [s]ake of fortune, acts a part not le[s]s unworthy and di[s]graceful, than the pro[s]titute who does the [s]ame for half a crown. While a man has the u[s]e of his limbs and arms, he ought to be above [s]uch mercenary motives; and true happine[s]s can be found only in congruity, and what is natural. Teague [s]eemed [s]till to have [s]ome hankering after the [s]upper of ducks, and the feather bed; but as they proceeded, the recollection became more faint, for di[s]tance and time, is the cure of all pa[s][s]ions. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] PROCEEDING four or five miles, they breakfa[s]ted; and afterwards, going on a mile or two further, they came to a church where a number of people were convened, to hear the deci[s]ion of an eccle[s]ia[s]tical con[s]i[s]tory, met there on an affair which came before them. It was this: Two men appeared, the one of a grave a[s]pect, with a black coat; the other without the [s]ame clerical colour of garb; but with papers in his pocket which announced his authority to preach, and officiatate as a clergyman. The man with the black coat, averred, that coming over together, in a ve[s][s]el from Ireland, they had been me[s][s]mates; and while he was a[s]leep one night, being drow[s]y after [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] prayers, the other had [s]tolen his credentials from his pocket. The man in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the papers, averred they were his own, and that the other had taken his coat, and by advantage of the cloth, thought to pa[s]s for what he was not. The con[s]i[s]tory found it difficult, without the aid of in[s]piration, to decide; and that faculty having now cea[s]ed, there were no other means, that they could [s]ee, to bring the truth to light. The Captain being informed of this perplexity, could not avoid [s]tepping up, and addre[s][s]ing them as follows: Gentlemen, [s]aid he, there is a text in your own Scripture, which, I think, might enable you to decide: It is this, " by their fruits you [s]hall know them.  " Let the two men preach; and the be[s]t [s]ermon take the pur[s]e; or laying a[s]ide the figure, let him that expounds the [s]cripture be[s]t, be adjudged the clergyman. The propo[s]ition [s]eemed rea[s]onable, and was adopted; the competitors being desired to withdraw a little, and conn over their notes, that they might be ready to deliver a di[s]cour[s]e re[s]pectively. The Captain ob[s]erving the countenance of him in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the papers, was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] sensible, from his palene[s]s, and dejection of aspect, that he was the impo[s]tor. Going out therefore [s]hortly after, and falling in with him, as he walked in a melancholy mood, at a little di[s]tance from the church, [s]aid he to him, I perceive how it is, that the other is the preacher; neverthele[s]s I would wi[s]h to a[s][s]i[s]t you, and as I have been the means of bringing you into this predicament, I [s]hould be di[s]po[s]ed to bring you out.---Let me know how the ca[s]e really [s]tands. The other candidly acknowledged that having been a yarn-merchant in Ireland, his capital had failed, and he had thought proper to embark for this country; and coming over with this clergyman, he had purloined his papers; and would have taken his coat, had it not been too little for him; a thing which never [s]truck the ecclesiastical tribunal. But the matter being now reduced to an actual experiment of talents, he was at a lo[s]s; for he had never preached a [s]ermon in his life. It was true, he had heard [s]ermons and lectures in abundance; and had he been [s]uffered to go on and preach at his lei[s]ure among[s]t the country people fir[s]t, he might have done well enough; but to make his fir[s]t e[s][s]ay in the pre[s]ence of a learned body of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] clergy, would hazard a detection; but now he [s]aw his over[s]ight in not having taken the notes of the other, at the [s]ame time he took the vouchers of his mi[s][s]ion. The Captain encouraged him, by observing, that there were few bodies, ecclesiastical or civil, in which there were more than one or two men of [s]en[s]e; that the majority of this con[s]i[s]tory, might be as ea[s]ily humbugged, as the lay people; that a good deal would depend on the text that he took; [s]ome were ea[s]ily preached upon; others more difficult. An hi[s]torical pa[s][s]age about Nimrod, or Nebuchadnezzar, or Sihon, king of the Amorites, or Og, king of Ba[s]han; out of Gene[s]is, or Deuteronomy, or the book of Judges, or Kings, would do very well; but that he [s]hould avoid carefully the book of Job, and the P[s]alms of David, and the Proverbs of Solomon; the[s]e requiring a con[s]iderable theological knowledge; or, at lea[s]t, moral di[s]cu[s][s]ion and reflection. Keep a good heart, [s]aid he, and attempt the matter. The i[s][s]ue may be better than you apprehend. With this, taking him a little further to the one [s]ide, where his hor[s]e was tied, he took out a bottle from his [s]addle-bags, with a little whi[s]ky in it, which Teague had put [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] there, and gave him a dram. This had a good effect, and rai[s]ed his [s]pirits, and he [s]eemed now ready to enter the li[s]ts with his antagoni[s]t. The other, in the mean time, had gone in, and was ready, when called upon, to hold forth. The man with the papers returning, with the Captain not far behind, took his [s]eat. The board [s]ignified, that one or other might a[s]cend the pulpit. The credential man, wi[s]hing to gain time, to think farther what he was about to [s]ay, but affecting politene[s]s, yielded precedence to the other, and de[s]ired him to preach fir[s]t. Accordingly [s]tepping up, he took his text and began. The Sermon. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] Prov. viii. 33. Hear in[s]truction and be wi[s]e, and refu[s]e it not. INSISTING on the[s]e words, I [s]hall enquire, 1. Whence it is that men are aver[s]e to in[s]truction. 2. The misfortune of this di[s]po[s]ition. La[s]tly, Conclude with inferences from the [s]ubject. 1\. Whence it is that men are adver[s]e to in[s]truction.  The fir[s]t principle is indolence. The mind loves ea[s]e, and does not wi[s]h to be at the trouble of thinking. It is hard to collect ideas, and [s]till harder to compo[s]e them; it is like rowing a boat: whereas, acting without thought, is like [s]ailing before the wind, and the tide in our favour. The [s]econd principle is pride. It wounds the [s]elf love of men, to [s]uppo[s]e that they need in[s]truction. We re[s]ent more the being called fools than knaves. No man [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] will own him[s]elf weak and uninformed. In fact, he has not humility to think he is: or, if he [s]hould be con[s]cious of a want of knowledge, he is unwilling that others [s]hould have the [s]ame opinion: and he will not [s]ubmit to be in[s]tructed, as that would imply that he is not already [s]o. The third principle is pa[s][s]ion. When we are di[s]po[s]ed to [s]atisfy the de[s]ires of the con[s]titution, or the affections of the mind, which are unlawful, we do not wi[s]h to hear di[s][s]ua[s]ion from the indulgence. The lecture comes to torment before the time, when the con[s]equence mu[s]t afflict. Under the [s]econd head, we [s]hall [s]hew the misfortune of this di[s]po[s]ition. It is what, in early life, begins to fix the difference of per[s]ons. The hearer of in[s]truction, even with more moderate parts, becomes the more [s]en[s]ible boy. The hearer of instruction has a better chance for life and mature years. Into how many dangers do young per[s]ons run; leaping, climbing, running, playing truant, and neglecting books? Into what affrays too will pa[s][s]ions prompt them, when they begin to feel the [s]inew [s]trong, and the manly nerve braced? They value corporeal [s]trength, which they [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] have in common with the hor[s]e, or the ox, and neglect the cultivation of the mind, which is the glory of our nature. What is a man without information? In form only above a bea[s]t. What is a man, negligent of moral duty? Wor[s]e than a bea[s]t; becau[s]e, he is de[s]titute of that by which he might be governed, and of which his nature is capable; and without which, he is more dangerous, in proportion as he is more ingenious. I [s]hall conclude with inferences from the [s]ubject. It may be [s]een hence, with what attention we ought to hear, and with what observation, [s]ee. The five [s]en[s]es are the avenues of knowledge; but the reflection of the mind on ideas pre[s]ented, is the [s]ource of wi[s]dom. Under[s]tanding is better than riches; for under[s]tanding leads to compotcency, and to know how to u[s]e it. Laying a[s]ide, therefore, all indolence, pride, and pa[s][s]ion, let us hear in[s]truction, and be wi[s]e, and refu[s]e it not. This, reverend brethren, is a [s]hort sermon. It is one in miniature; like the model of a mechanical invention, which is complete in its parts, and from whence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] may be [s]een the powers of the inventor. I did not intend to take up your time with a long di[s]cour[s]e; becau[s]e, ex pede Herculem; you may know what I can do by this e[s][s]ay. The fact is, I am regularly bred, and licen[s]ed; but this my competitor, is no more than a yarn merchant; who, failing in his trade, has adventured to this country: And coming over in the ve[s][s]el with me, took the opportunity one night, when I was a[s]leep, and picked my fob of the[s]e papers, which he now [s]hews. Thus having [s]poke, he de[s]cended. The other, in the mean time, had been at his wits end what to do. The technical difficulty of taking a text, and dividing it under [s]everal heads, and splitting each head into branches, and pur[s]uing each with [s]uch [s]trickne[s]s, that the thoughts [s]hould be ranged under each which belonged to it, as exactly as you would the coar[s]er yarn with the coar[s]er, and the finer with the finer; or put balls with balls, and hanks with hanks. At la[s]t he had determined to take no text at all; as it was much better to take none, than to take one and not [s]tick to it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] Accordingly, he re[s]olved to preach up and down the [s]cripture, wherever he could get a word of [s]ea[s]onable doctrine. Mounting the pulpit, therefore, he began as follows: The fir[s]t man that we read of was Adam, and fir[s]t woman Eve: [s]he was tempted by the [s]erpent, and eat the forbidden fruit. After this [s]he conceived and bare a [s]on, and called his name Cain; and Cain was a tiller of the ground, and Abel a keeper of [s]heep; for [s]he conceived and bare a [s]econd [s]on, and called his name Abel. And Cain [s]lew Abel. There were [s]everal generations unto the flood, when Noah built an ark, and [s]aved him[s]elf and his family. After the flood, Abraham begat I[s]aac, and I[s]aac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Jo[s]eph and his brethren. Potiphar's wife, in Egypt, took a fancy for Jo[s]eph, and ca[s]t him in ward; and Potiphar was a captain of Pharaoh's guards; and Jo[s]eph interpreted Pharaoh's dream of the lean cattle; and there were twelve years famine in the land; and Mo[s]es passed for the [s]on of Pharaoh's daughter, and married Jethro's daughter, in the land of Midian, and brought the I[s]raelites out of the land of Egypt; and Jo[s]hua the [s]on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] of Nun, and Caleb the [s]on Jephunneh; and the walls of Jericho fell down at the [s]ound of ram's horns; and Samp[s]on [s]lew a thou[s]and with the jaw-bone of an a[s]s; and Delilah the harlot; and Gideon, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Abinoam the Giliaditi[s]h; and Samuel, and Saul, and the prophets; and Jonathan, and David; and Solomon built him an hou[s]e; and silver was plenty as the [s]treet [s]tones in Jerusalem; Rehoboam, and Jeho[s]ophat, and the kings of I[s]rael and Juda; Daniel was ca[s]t into the lions' den; and Shadrach, Me[s]hach, and Abed-nego; and I[s]aiah and Jeremiah; and Zachariah, and Zerobabel; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the apo[s]tles; Mary Magdalene, out of whom were ca[s]t [s]even devils; and the father of Zebedee's children; and Pontius Pilate, and the high prie[s]t, and Ananias and Sapphira, and the [s]even trumpets, in the Revelations, and the dragon, and the woman. Amen. I add no more. The lay people pre[s]ent were mo[s]t plea[s]ed with the la[s]t di[s]cour[s]e; and [s]ome of the younger of the clergy: But the more aged, gave the preference to the fir[s]t. Thus it [s]eemed difficult to decide. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] The Captain ri[s]ing up, [s]poke: Gentlemen, [s]aid he, the men [s]eem both to have con[s]iderable gifts, and I [s]ee no harm in letting them both preach. There is work enough for them in this new country; the fir[s]t appears to me, to be more qualified for the city, as a very methodical preacher; but the la[s]t is the mo[s]t practical; and each may an[s]wer a valuable purpo[s]e in their proper place. The deci[s]ion [s]eemed judicious, and it was agreed that they [s]hould both preach. The man who had been the yarn merchant, thanked their reverences, and gave out that he would preach there that day week, God willing. The clergy were [s]o plea[s]ed with the Captain, that they gave him an invitation to go home with them to an elder's hou[s]e, ju[s]t by; but recollecting the trouble he had with Teague on another occa[s]ion, and the danger of being drawn into a like predicament, [s]hould he fall into conver[s]ation with the clergymen, and take it into his head to preach, he declined the invitation, and ha[s]tened to get his hor[s]e, and having Teague along [s]ide, proceeded on his journey. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] THE in[s]uing day, the Captain arrived in a certain city, and put up at the [s]ign of the Indian Queen. Taking a day or two to refre[s]h him[s]elf, and get a new pair of breeches made, and his coat mended, which was a little worn at the elbows, he went to look about the city. The fourth day, when he had propo[s]ed to [s]et out to perambulate this modern Babylon, and called for Teague to bring him his boots, there was no Teague there. The ho[s]tler being called, with whom he u[s]ed to [s]leep, informed, that he had di[s]appeared the day before. The Captain was alarmed; and, from the recollection of former incidents, began to enquire if there were any elections going on at that time. As it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] [s]o happened, there was one that very day. Thinking it probable the bog-trotter, having [s]till a hankering after an appointment might offer him[s]elf on that occa[s]ion, he [s]et out to the place where the people were convened, to [s]ee if he could di[s]cover Teague among[s]t the candidates. He could [s]ee nothing of him; and though he made enquiry, he could hear no account. But the circum[s]tance of the election drawing his attention for [s]ome time, he forgot Teague. The candidates were all remarkably pot-bellied; and waddled in their gait. The Captain enquiring what were the pretensions of the[s]e men to be elected; he was told, that they had all [s]tock in the funds, and lived in large brick buildings; and [s]ome of them entertained fifty people at a time, and eat and drank abundantly; and, living an ea[s]y life, and pampering their appetites, they had [s]wollen to this [s]ize. It is a [s]trange thing, [s]aid the Captain, that in the country, in my route, they would elect no one but a weaver, or a whi[s]ky distiller; and here none but fat [s]wabs, that guzzle wine, and [s]moke [s]egars. It was not [s]o in Greece, where Phocion came with his plain coat, from his humble dwelling, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] directed the coun[s]els of the people; or in Rome, where Cincinnatus was made dictator from the plough. Something mu[s]t be wrong, where the inflate, and pompous are the objects of choice. Though there is one good arising from it, that there is no danger of my Teague here. He could not afford to give a dinner; and as to funds, he has not a single [s]hilling in them. They will make him neither mayor nor legi[s]lator in this city. Na faith, [s]aid Mr. M`Donald, the Scotch gentleman who had been pre[s]ent at the embarrassment of the Captain, on the occa[s]ion of the former election; and having, a few days before, come to the city, and observing the Captain in the crowd, had come up to acco[s]t him, ju[s]t as he was uttering the[s]e la[s]t words to him[s]elf: Na faith, [s]aid he, there is na danger of Teague here, unle[s]s he had his [s]cores o' [s]hares in the bank; and was in league with the brokers, and had a brick hou[s]e at his hurdies, or a [s]hip or twa on the [s]tocks. A great deal u[s]ed to be done, by employing advocates with the trade[s]men, to li[s]ten to the news, and tell them fair [s]tories; but all is now lo[s]t in [s]ub[s]tantial intere[s]t, and the funds command every thing. Be[s]ides, this city is [s]warming with Teagues, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] O'Regans, and O'Brians, and O'Murphys, and O'Farrels; I [s]ee, that they cannot be at a lo[s]s without your bog trotter. The Captain having his fears ea[s]ed, in this particular, returned home, greatly troubled, neverthele[s]s, that he could not come up with the Iri[s]hman. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] REFLECTING with him[s]elf, that Teague was inclined to women, and that he might have gone to [s]ome of tho[s]e hou[s]es, which are not in the be[s]t repute with the religious part of the community, the Captain thought it might not be ami[s]s to make enquiry. Being informed by the waiter, that he had overheard gentlemen, at the hou[s]e, in their cups, [s]peak of a certain Mrs. Robe[s]on, who kept a hou[s]e of that kind; and, as far as he could understand, it was in [s]uch a part of the city, a few doors from [s]uch a [s]treet. The Captain having [s]et out, coming into the neighbourhood, and making inquiry, was directed to the hou[s]e. Knocking, and, on a [s]ervant coming to the door, enquiring for Mrs. Robe[s]on; he was [s]hewn into a parlour, and in a little time the old lady entered. Being [s]eated, he took the liberty of addre[s][s]ing her: Madam, [s]aid he, I am not unacquainted with the [s]tile and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] designation of your hou[s]e. Why, as to that, [s]aid [s]he, we do the be[s]t we can; but the times are hard, and it is a very difficult thing to pick up a good looking healthy girl, now a days. So many young women, [s]ince the war is over, having taken to virtuous ways, and got married, has almo[s]t broke us up. But I have been fortunate enough to light upon one, yesterday, that is a rare piece, ju[s]t from the country; and I am [s]ure --- It is not in the way that you mean, madam, [s]aid the Captain, that I take the liberty to call upon you. I have a [s]ervant man, of the name of Teague O'Regan, that is inclined to women, and has been ab[s]ent [s]ome days; and it has occurred to me, that he may have come to your hou[s]e, or [s]ome other of the like kind; and may be [s]kulking, to avoid my [s]ervice. As he has little or no money, it is impo[s][s]ible he can be much in your way; and I could make it better worth your while to inform on him, and [s]urrender him up. Teague O'Regan, [s]aid the old lady! [s]nuffing; Teague O'Regan! I would have you know, [s]ir, that no Teague O'Regans come here; we keep a hou[s]e for the fir[s]t gentlemen; not for waiters, or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] understrappers, or any of the common [s]orts. There is no half-crown, or five [s]hilling pieces here. Teague O'Regan indeed! there is no Teague O'Regan at this hou[s]e. We have meat for his ma[s]ter. I was saying there was a young woman ju[s]t now from the country, that looks more like a woman of family, than a country girl; but is [s]o melancholy and mopi[s]h, that [s]he [s]carcely [s]peaks; and [s]tands in need of [s]ome one to talk to her, and keep her in [s]pirits. She is fit for any gentleman. Teague O'Regan! Humph! There is no Teague O'Regan puts his foot into my door. The Captain a[s][s]ured her, that he by no means meant to give offence. That tho' the bog-trotter could not have acce[s]s to her fir[s]t rooms; yet he did not know but he might have got in with [s]ome of her under maids, and be about the kitchen. The lady, being now appea[s]ed on the [s]core of Teague, was in a good humour, and renewed her hints to the Captain, with re[s]pect to the young woman. She is, [s]aid [s]he, as good looking a girl as ever came to my hou[s]e; and has not [s]een a [s]ingle per[s]on but your[s]elf, whom [s]he has not yet [s]een; but may [s]ee, if you chu[s]e; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] a very pretty girl [s]he is; but keeps mopish and melancholy, as if [s]he was crossed in love, and had come to town for fear of her relations, and wi[s]hes to keep out of [s]ight of every body. The Captain being no [s]tranger to the art the[s]e matrons u[s]e, in their addre[s][s]es, to enhance the value of their wares, was but little moved with the recommendation [s]he had given. But as there were [s]ome circumstances in the account of the young woman, that were a little [s]triking, his curiosity was excited to let her be called in, and pre[s]ent her[s]elf. Accordingly, the old lady [s]tepping out, a young woman made her appearance, of con[s]iderable beauty; but in her countenance expre[s][s]ions of woe. Her blue eye [s]eemed involved in mi[s]t; for [s]he [s]hed no tears; her [s]orrow was beyond that. Young woman, [s]aid the Captain, it is ea[s]y to perceive that you have not been in this way of life long; and that you have been brought to it, perhaps, by [s]ome uncommon circum[s]tances. My humanity is intere[s]ted; and it occurs to me to a[s]k, by what means it has come to pa[s]s. The part which he [s]eemed to take in her di[s]tre[s]s, in[s]piring her with confidence; and being [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] reque[s]ted by him to relate her [s]tory frankly, [s]he began as follows: My father, [s]aid [s]he, lives at the di[s]tance of about twenty miles from this city, and is a man of good e[s]tate. I have two brothers, but no [s]i[s]ters. My mother dying when I was at the age of fourteen, I became hou[s]e-keeper for the family. There was a young man that u[s]ed to come to the [s]ame church to which we went. He was of the very lowe[s]t cla[s]s, mean in his appearance, of homely features, and a dimunitive per[s]on. Yet he had the assurance to put him[s]elf in my way on every occa[s]ion; endeavouring to catch my eye; for he did not dare to [s]peak to me. But I hated him, and was almo[s]t re[s]olved to [s]tay at home on Sundays, to avoid him; for he began to be very trouble[s]ome. His attentions to me were taken notice of by my brothers. They were confident that I mu[s]t give him [s]ome encouragement, or he would not make [s]uch advances. My father was of the [s]ame opinion. I a[s][s]ured them I had never given him any encouragement, and I never would; that I was as much aver[s]e to him as po[s][s]ible. I [s]hunned him and hated him. He persisted a long time, almo[s]t two years, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] [s]eemed to become melancholy, and at la[s]t went away from the neighbourhood; and, as I heard afterwards, to [s]ea. I began now to reflect upon his a[s][s]iduity, and endeavours to engage my affections. I recollected every circum[s]tance of his conduct towards me, [s]ince the fir[s]t time I was obliged to take notice of him. I rea[s]oned with my[s]elf, that it was no fault of his, if his family was low; and if he him[s]elf had not all that comeline[s]s of per[s]on which I wi[s]hed in a hu[s]band; yet he was sufficiently puni[s]hed in his pre[s]umption in thinking of me, by what he mu[s]t have [s]uffered, and by his going to [s]ea, which he did to get out of my [s]ight, finding his attempts to gain my affections, hopele[s]s. I dreamed of him; and [s]carcely a moment of the day pa[s][s]ed, but my thoughts were running on the danger to which he was expo[s]ed. It [s]eemed to me that if he came back, I [s]hould be more kind to him. I might at lea[s]t [s]hew him, that I was not in[s]en[s]ible of his attachment. In about a year he returned, and the moment I [s]aw him, I loved him. He did not dare to come to my father's hou[s]e. But I could not help giving him encouragement, by my countenance, when I met [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] him in public. Emboldened by this, he at la[s]t ventured to [s]peak to me; and I agreed that he might come to a peach orchard, at [s]ome di[s]tance from my father's hou[s]e, and that I would give him an interview. There he came often; and with a mo[s]t lowly, and humble behaviour, fixed my regard for him. Not doubting the violence of his love for me, and my ascendency over him, I at la[s]t put my[s]elf in his power. Becoming pregnant, I hinted marriage; but what was my astonishment to find, that, on various pretences, he evaded it; and as I became more fond, he became more cold; which had no other effect, than to make me more ardent than before. It had been u[s]ual, for many months, to meet me every evening at this place; but now I had gone often, and did not find him there. At la[s]t he withdrew altogether, and I heard he had left the settlement. Worthle[s]s and ba[s]e, as I now knew him to be; and, though my reason told me, that in per[s]on he was [s]till as homely as I fir[s]t thought him, yet I continued to love him to di[s]traction. What was my di[s]tre[s]s, when my father, and my brothers, found that I was with child? They charged me, though [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] unjustly, of having deceived them with re[s]pect to my attachment to this low creature, from the fir[s]t: In fine, my father dismissed me from the hou[s]e: My brothers, no le[s]s relenting than him, in their re[s]entment again[s]t me, upbraided me with the offers I had refu[s]ed, and the treatment I had given [s]everal gentlemen, in their advances to me. For, indeed, during the ab[s]ence of this worthle[s]s man, I had been addre[s][s]ed by [s]everal; but my pity and compa[s][s]ion for the wretch, had [s]o wrought upon me, that I could not think of any, or [s]carcely bear them to [s]peak to me. Di[s]mi[s][s]ed from my father's hou[s]e, even my younger brother, who was mo[s]t [s]oft and yielding in his nature, [s]eeming to approve of it, I went to the habitation of a tenant of my father; there remained [s]ome time, and endeavoured to make compen[s]ation, by the labour of my hands, for the trouble I was giving them. But the[s]e poor people, thinking my father would relent, had informed him where I was, and of the care they had taken of me. The consequence was, that, at the end of three months, he [s]ent for the child, of which I had been brought to bed [s]ome weeks before; but ordered them in[s]tantly to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] dismiss me, that I might never more offend his hearing with my name. I wandered to this city, and the fir[s]t night lay in the market hou[s]e, upon a bench. The next morning mixed with the women that came to market, and enquired for work of any kind. I could find none; but at la[s]t meeting with a young woman who felt for my di[s]tre[s]s, [s]he told me, that [s]he had a [s]mall room in this city, where [s]he had lived [s]ome time with an aunt that was lately dead; and that now [s]he [s]upported her[s]elf by doing a little in the millinery way; that if I would come and take breakfa[s]t with her, and [s]ee where [s]he lived, I was welcome. Going with the poor girl, I found her lonely and distressed enough. Neverthele[s]s I continued with her [s]everal months. But the work was [s]mall that we got to do, and times becoming [s]till wor[s]e, I was obliged to [s]ell the cloths that I brought with me, to the la[s]t petticoat and [s]hort gown, to support our[s]elves and pay rent. To bring me to the la[s]t [s]tage of mi[s]ery, the poor girl who was more expert than I was, in making any little provi[s]ion that could be made, fell [s]ick and in [s]hort time died. I could bear to [s]tay no longer in the room, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] and coming out to wander in the [s]treets, like a forlorn wretch indeed, and [s]obbing [s]orely by my[s]elf, when I thought no one heard me, I was ob[s]erved by this woman, at who[s]e hou[s]e you now are, and pre[s][s]ed by her to go home. I [s]oon found what [s]ort of a hou[s]e it was, and had I not been watched, when I talked of going away, and threatened to be [s]ent to jail, for what, it is pretended I owe [s]ince I came to the hou[s]e, I [s]hould not have been here longer than the fir[s]t day. The Captain feeling with great sensibility the circum[s]tances of her [s]tory, made reply: Said he, Young woman, I greatly commi[s]erate your hi[s]tory and [s]ituation, and feel my[s]elf impelled to revenge your wrong. But the villain which has thus injured you, is out of my reach, in two respects; fir[s]t, by di[s]tance; and [s]econd, being too contemptible and ba[s]e to be pursued by my re[s]entment even on your account. But revenge is not your object, but support and re[s]toration to your friends, and the good opinion of the world. As to money, it is not in my power to advance you any great [s]um; but as far as words can go, I could wi[s]h to [s]erve you: not words to your[s]elf only; but to others, in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] your behalf. It is evident to me, that you have [s]uffered by your own too great [s]en[s]ibility. It was humanity and generosity, that engaged you in his favour. It was your imagination, that gave tho[s]e attractions to his vile and uncomely person, by which you was [s]educed. You have been a victim to your own goodne[s]s, and not to his merit. The warmth of your heart has overcome the [s]trength of your judgment; and your prudence has been [s]ubdued by your pa[s][s]ion: or, rather, indeed, confiding in a man whom you had [s]aved from all the pains, and heart-felt mi[s]eries of un[s]ucce[s]sful love, you have become a [s]acrifice to your compa[s][s]ion and tenderne[s]s. The be[s]t advice I can give you, is, to compo[s]e your[s]elf for this night. Pre[s]erve your virtue; for I do not consider you as having lo[s]t it: your mind has not been in fault, or contaminated. I will endeavour to find out [s]ome per[s]on, who may be di[s]po[s]ed to a[s][s]i[s]t you; and, though it may be difficult for you yet to e[s]tabli[s]h lo[s]t fame, it is not impo[s][s]ible. So [s]aying, he left the room; but the young woman, impre[s][s]ed with the[s]e la[s]t words e[s]pecially, viz. the diffculty, if not impossibility, of regaining reputation, [s]unk [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] down upon her chair, and could not pay him the compliment of thanks, at his departure. During the night, through the whole of which he lay awake, at the public hou[s]e, he ruminated on the extraordinary nature of this incident, and the means which he would adopt to recover this woman from her unfortunate [s]ituation. Thought he, I am in a city where there are a great body of the people called Quakers. This [s]ociety, above all others, is remarkable for humanity, and charitable actions. There is a female preacher, of whom I have heard; a Lydia Wil[s]on: I will inform this good woman of the circum[s]tance; and, if ge gives me leave, I will bring this [s]tray [s]heep to her; [s]he may have it in her power to introduce her to [s]ome place, where, by needle work, and industry, [s]he might live, until it may be in my power, taking a journey to her father, and [s]tating the ca[s]e, and giving my sentiments, to re[s]tore her to her family. Early next morning, as [s]oon as it could be pre[s]umed, the Quaker lady had [s]et her hou[s]e in order;  that is, after the family might be [s]uppo[s]ed to have breakfasted, which was about nine o'clock, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] Captain [s]et out; and being admitted, stated to Mrs. Wil[s]on, the exact circum[s]tances as before related. The pious woman readily undertook every office in her power. Accordingly, taking leave, the Captain [s]et out for the hou[s]e of Mrs. Robe[s]on. At the door, he met a number of men coming out, and, on inquiry, he found a coroner's inque[s]t had ju[s]t [s]at on the body of a young woman of the hou[s]e, who had the preceding evening, [s]u[s]pended her[s]elf from the bed po[s]t with her garter. He was [s]truck, [s]u[s]pecting it mu[s]t be the young woman whom he had [s]o much in his thoughts. Going in, and enquiring, he found it to be the ca[s]e; and that they proposed to bury as [s]oon as the few boards of a coffin could be got ready. As a man of humanity, he could not but [s]hed tears; and blame him[s]elf that he had not given her [s]tronger a[s][s]urance of his interpo[s]ition before he left her, that [s]he might not have fallen into de[s]pair, and taken away her life. The coffin being now ready, the funeral [s]et out, not for the burying ground of a church yard; but for a place without the city, called the Potter's-field: For suicide forfeits Chri[s]tian burial: Her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] obsequies attended, not by a clergyman in front, nor by [s]carfed mourners, holding up the pall; nor was [s]he borne on a bier, but drawn on a cart; and the company that followed her uncovered her[s]e, were not decent matrons, nor venerable men, but old bauds, and [s]trumpets, and cullies, half drunk, making merry as they went along. Being interred, they returned home; but the Captain remaining [s]ome time, contemplating the grave, thus [s]poke: Earth, thou covere[s]t the body of a lovely woman, and with a mind not le[s]s lovely; yet doomed in her burial, to the [s]ame ground with negroes, and malefactors; not that I think the circum[s]tance makes any difference; but it [s]hews the opinion of the world with re[s]pect to thy per[s]onal demerit. Nor do I call in que[s]tion the ju[s]tne[s]s of this opinion; having [s]uch circumstances whereon to found it. But I reflect with my[s]elf how much opinion, operating like a general law, may do inju[s]tice. It remains only with heaven's chancery to reach the equity of the ca[s]e, and ab[s]olve her from a crime; or at lea[s]t qualify that which was the exce[s]s of virtue. If the fair elements that compo[s]ed her frame, [s]hall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] ever again unite, and ri[s]e to life, and as the divines [s]uppo[s]e, her form receive its [s]hape, and complexion from her mental qualities, and conduct on earth, [s]he will lo[s]e nothing of her beauty; for her daring di[s]dain of her[s]elf and fate, was a mark of repentance,---[s]tronger than all tears. Yet, had [s]he acted the nobler part of holding her[s]elf in life, pre[s]erving her mind and body cha[s]te until famine had taken her away, or the hand of heaven moved for her relief, [s]he had [s]hone, at the la[s]t ri[s]ing, with [s]uperior brightne[s]s; been ranked amongst the fir[s]t beauties of heaven, and walked di[s]tingui[s]hed in the paradi[s]e of God. Doubtle[s]s the Almighty mu[s]t blame, and chide her for this premature and ra[s]h [s]tep. Fallen to the la[s]t point of depre[s][s]ion, he was about to relieve her, and the sequel of her days might have been happy and [s]erene. It was a di[s]tru[s]t of his providence. She heard my words, though [s]he did not know my heart. And [s]urely it was my intention to relieve her. But [s]he erred again[s]t my thoughts; [s]he eluded the gra[s]p of my humanity. For this [s]he will be reprimanded by the Mo[s]t High; and fail of that [s]upereminent glory which awaits heroic minds.

Farewel, lovely form, whom late I knew; and let the gra[s]s grow green upon thy grave. Thy [s]orrows are expunged; but mine are awake; and will be [s]o, until I al[s]o come to the [s]hades invi[s]ible, and have the [s]ame apathy of heart with thee.

Such were his reflections for a great part of this day; and had thought of putting an adverti[s]ement in the paper, to know if any dead body had been lately di[s]covered; or inqui[s]ition held on a young man, with red hair, and a long leg, who had been mi[s][s]ing [s]ome days, and was supposed to have hung or drowned him[s]elf. But in the evening, meditating thus, mention being made by [s]ome of the lodgers, of going to hear the annual oration, delivered before the Philo[s]ophical Society, by a member; it [s]truck his mind, that po[s][s]ibly Teague, falling in with [s]ome of this body, had been induced by them to take a [s]eat, and might be pre[s]ent on that occa[s]ion. Not he[s]itating, therefore, he [s]econded the propo[s]al of going; and offered to be of the party. Coming to the hall, the philo[s]ophers were [s]eated; but a black member [s]at with a taper before him, who, it [s]eems, was to deliver the oration. The fact was this; A gentleman of Maryland of the name of Gorum, had [s]ent to the [s]ociety, [s]ome time before, a curiosity found by one of his negroes in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-233.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] mud of Wye river, on the banks of which his [s]eat was. It appeared to be a [s]tone, with a cavity [s]ufficient to receive a man's foot, and was adjudged by the [s]ociety to be an Indian's petrified mocca[s]on. The [s]ingularity of the di[s]covery, well intitling the gentleman to a [s]eat, he was invited; but [s]ending his compliments, he gave them to under[s]tand, that Cuff, (for that was the name of the negro) was more intitled to that honour than he was, being the per[s]on who had found the curio[s]ity; and as he made it a point to do his [s]laves ju[s]tice in any perqui[s]ite of their own, he could not think of robbing one, on this occasion of any honour, to which he might be introduced by this di[s]covery. The [s]ociety approved his hone[s]ty, and fair dealing; and by unanimous ballot, admitted the negro; who, having been a member [s]ome time, had been appointed, to pronounce the annual oration. Cuff, a good deal di[s]concerted in hearing of the ta[s]k impo[s]ed upon him, had applied to his ma[s]ter to know what to [s]ay. Colonel Gorum attending a good deal to literary matters, had heard of an oration delivered before the [s]ociety, the object of which was to prove that the Africans had been once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] white, had [s]harp no[s]es, and long hair; but that by living in [s]un-burnt climates, the [s]kin had changed colour, the hair become frizzled, and in the cour[s]e of generation, the imagination of the mother, presenting obtu[s]e objects, had produced an offspring with flat no[s]es. He therefore gave Cuff to under[s]tand, that it would be doing no more than ju[s]tice to his countrymen, for he was a Guinea negro, if he [s]hould avail him[s]elf of this occa[s]ion to prove that men were all once black, and that by living in [s]nowy countries, and being bleached by the weather, the [s]kin had gradually become white, and the hair moi[s]t and long, and the imagination pre[s]enting prominent objects to the mothers, or the fathers differing among them[s]elves, and pulling one another by this part, had given the long and pointed no[s]e. Cuff, thus prepared, [s]et out; having arrived, and being on this occa[s]ion to harangue, began as follows: The Oration. Massa [s]hentiman; I be ca[s]h crab in de Wye riva: found ting in de mud; tone, big a man's foot: hols like to he; fetch [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] Ma[s][s]a: Ma[s][s]a [s]ay, it be de Indian moccason.--- O! fat de call it; all tone. He [s]ay, you be a fila[s]afa, Cuff: I [s]ay, O no, Massa; you be de fila[s]afa. Wel; two tree monts afta, Ma[s][s]a call me, and [s]ay, You be a fila[s]afa, Cuff, fo' [s]artan: Getta ready, and go dis city, and make grate peech for [s]hentima fila[s]afa. I [s]ay, Fat [s]ay? Ma[s][s]a: Ma[s][s]a [s]ay, [s]omebody [s]ay, dat de fir[s]t man was de [s]ite man; but you [s]ay, dat de fir[s]t man was de black a-man. Vel, I [s]et out out: come along: Ma[s][s]a gi me pa[s]s. Some [s]ay, where you go, Cuff? I [s]ay, dis city, be a fila[s]afa. O no, Cuff, you be no filasafa: call me fool, gi me kick i'de backside; fall down, get up again, and come to dis city.

The oration being ended, the Society could do no le[s]s than appoint a committee to wait on Mr. Cuff, and reque[s]t a copy of his oration, that it might be publi[s]hed. But the Captain, in the mean time, had examined, with great attention, the whole audience; but could not di[s]cover Teague. Departing, therefore, with the re[s]t, his thoughts recurred to his fir[s]t idea, viz. that the unfortunate creature had committed [s]uicide. Drawing up, therefore, an adverti[s]ement, he [s]ent it to a daily paper; but, though it appeared next morning, and the day elap[s]ed, there was no word of Teague. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] THERE is no fact that has proved more [s]tubborn than the diver[s]ity of the human [s]pecies; e[s]pecially that great extreme of diver[s]ity in the natives of Africa. How the de[s]cendants of Adam and Eve, both good looking people, [s]hould ever come to be a vile negro, or even a mulatto man or woman, is puzzling. Some have conjectured, that a black complexion, frizzled hair, a flat no[s]e, and bandy legs, were the mark [s]et on Cain, for the murder of his brother Abel. But, as the deluge drowned the whole world, and only one family was [s]aved, the blacks mu[s]t have all peri[s]hed; like the Mammoth, who[s]e bones are found on the Ohio, and other places, which was too big for Noah to get into the ark. Some [s]uppo[s]e, that it was the cur[s]e pronounced upon Canaan, the [s]on of Noah, for looking at his father's nakedne[s]s. They got rid by this means of the difficulty of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] the flood; but by Mo[s]es' own account, the Canaanites were the de[s]cendents of Canaan; and we do not hear of them being negroes; which, had it been the ca[s]e, we cannot doubt would have been laid hold of by the I[s]raelites, as a circum[s]tance to ju[s]tify their extirpating, or making [s]laves of them. Lord Kames, in his Sketches of the History of Man, [s]olves the difficulty, by supposing, that, at the building of Babel, there was a confu[s]ion of complexions, as well as languages. But, be[s]ides that it is not to be [s]uppo[s]ed, that the hi[s]torian would pa[s]s over [s]o material a circum[s]tance, without particularly mentioning it, it is introducing a miracle, which we are not warranted in doing, unle[s]s it had been expressly laid down to have been wrought. The la[s]t theory, has been that of accounting for the change, from the climate, and accident of wind and weather; calling in aid, in the mean time, the imagination of the mothers. This does not appear altogether [s]atisfactory. At lea[s]t, there are tho[s]e who would not be aver[s]e to hear [s]ome other [s]olution of the difficulty. I have thought of one, which I would [s]ugge[s]t with great diffidence; the authors of tho[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] before me being great men, and their hypothesis not lightly overthrown. I am of opinion that Adam was a tall, [s]traight limbed, red haired man, with a fair complexion, blue eyes, and an aquiline no[s]e; and that Eve was a negro woman. For what nece[s][s]ity to make them both of the [s]ame colour, feature, and form, when there is beauty in variety. Do not you [s]ee in a tulip, one leaf blue, and another white, and [s]ometimes the [s]ame leaf white and red? As God made Adam in his own likeness, [s]o it is to be [s]uppo[s]ed, that Adam begat [s]ome in his; and the[s]e were red haired, fair complexioned, blue eyed, proportionably featured boys and girls; while, on the other hand, [s]ome took after the mother, and became negro men and women. From a mixture of complexion, the offspring, at other times, might be a [s]hade darker, in one ca[s]e, than the father; and a [s]hade lighter, in another ca[s]e, than the mother; and hence, a diver[s]ifyed progeny, with a variety of features; from the bottle-no[s]e to the mire-[s]nipe; which is that of the people in the we[s]t of Ireland; and from the auburn of the Cor[s]ican hair, to the golden locks of the Caledonian [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] beauty; and from the black eye, to the hazle and the grey. It may be a[s]ked, How at the flood? when Noah, his wife, his three [s]ons, and their wives, eight per[s]ons, only were saved? It is but giving [s]ome of the [s]ons negro wenches for their wives, and you have the matter all right. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] AS I have [s]aid, the day pa[s][s]ed over, and there was no word of Teague. In the evening, as it was u[s]ual with the gentlemen at the Indian Queen, to go to [s]ome place for the amu[s]ement of an hour or two; mention being made of a celebrated preacher, a Univer[s]ali[s]t, as he was called; that is, one who preaches the doctrine of univer[s]al [s]alvation; it was propo[s]ed to go to hear him, as he was to hold forth that evening. The Captain readily con[s]ented; and it [s]truck him, that, as this was a new fangled doctrine, and the preacher had made a great noi[s]e; and as it was a doctrine that, con[s]cious of a good deal of fornication, would naturally plea[s]e Teague, it was not impo[s][s]ible but the Iri[s]hman might have become a di[s]ciple of this reformist, and be at his conventicle. Coming in among[s]t the crowd, and obtaining [s]eats, they [s]aw the preacher a[s]cend the pulpit, and, after the preliminary [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] exercise of p[s]alms and prayer, take a text, and begin his [s]ermon. His text was taken from one of tho[s]e pa[s][s]ages of [s]cripture, which [s]peaks of "the lion lying down with the kid, and the tyger with the lamb;" which have been interpreted of the Millenium; but were applied by him, to that period, when, as the [s]ea [s]hall give up her dead, [s]o hell [s]hall give up her damned; and the devil himself [s]hall come to lick [s]alt out of the hand of an angel. Enlarging on this doctrine, and supporting it with a variety of proofs from [s]cripture, and arguments from rea[s]on, he [s]eemed to have brought the matter to a point; an[s]wering all objections, and closing in with the hearer. At this [s]tage, u[s]ing that figure of oratory, which is u[s]ual in the pulpit, of a[s]king que[s]tions, and pressing for an an[s]wer, but expecting none; he would [s]ay, Is not this conclu[s]ive? Is it not evident? Is there any here can advance an argument again[s]t it? Will any of you [s]peak---I pau[s]e for an an[s]wer? Mr. M`Donald, in the mean time, (the Scotch gentleman; who happened to be there,) thinking him really [s]erious, and that he wanted an an[s]wer; or taking [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] advantage of the pau[s]e, and the interrogation, to [s]peak his mind, leaning over the front of a back [s]eat, made reply: Why, [s]aid he, I like the doctrine well enough, and ha' na' di[s]po[s]ition to o'erthrow it. I dinna muckle care if there ware na' hell ava. If ye could make that out, I wad rather hear it, than o' being [s]moaked twa' or three thou[s]and years in the devil's nuke, or [s]inged wi' his burnt brim[s]tone, even if we [s]hould get out afterwards. Ye need na' put your[s]el in a pa[s][s]ion, or be flee'd that you'll no get proselytes; for I [s]hall warrant you, as many every night as ye can weel [s]tow awa i' the conventicle. The preacher giving thanks to God for the [s]ucce[s]s in his mini[s]try, in the remarkable conver[s]ion of the man who [s]poke, the Scotch gentleman [s]aid again; Ye need na ca' it a conver[s]ion; for I ha' been o' the [s]ame opinion a' my life; that it was a [s]are thing to bide the kiln of hell, and they wad de[s]erve muckle thanks wha could e[s]tabli[s]h that we [s]hould na' [s]tay long in it, or that there was na' [s]uch place ava. The preacher commenting upon this, ob[s]erved that [s]ome were orthodox from their birth, like Jeremiah, who was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] sanctified in his mother's womb; but others were hardly brought to the truth, with much teaching and in[s]truction. That the pre[s]ent was a happy in[s]tance of one who was in the right way from his very early years. The Captain in the mean time, had been thinking of the doctrine; and thought it rea[s]onable to [s]uppo[s]e, that the Almighty might relieve after [s]ome time, and let the damned devils go. Ju[s]t as with him[s]elf at pre[s]ent in the ca[s]e of Teague; if he had got his hands on the bog-trotter, he could not help being very angry, and would be di[s]po[s]ed to puni[s]h him with great [s]everity; but after [s]ome time he knew his pa[s][s]ion would [s]ub[s]ide, and he would forget his delinquencies. Teague in this manner running in his head, as the people, after [s]ome epilogue of prayer and benediction, being di[s]mi[s][s]ed, were retiring, he got up, and rai[s]ing his voice, begged the audience to detain a little. --- Good people, [s]aid he, if any of you [s]hould come acro[s]s a young man, a [s]ervant of mine, of the name of Teague O'Regan, I [s]hall thank you to [s]end me notice to the Indian Queen, where I lodge. And, according to the adverti[s]ement in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] this day's paper, I will give two dollars reward. Thinking him deranged in his brain, they proceeded, and took no notice of the proclamation. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] IN the infancy of Chri[s]tianity it was thought a hard matter to get to heaven; and that when once in hell, there was no geting out. A certain father of the church, of the name of Origen, was the fir[s]t to be more liberal in his sentiments, and thought, that after a certain period, there would be a jail-delivery of the damned. I do not know that he went [s]o far as to let the devils them[s]elves out upon a furlough; but at the pre[s]ent time, we all know very well, that the time will come, when they will be out all together; at lea[s]t the univer[s]ali[s]ts tell us this, and prove it. The doctrine was received in [s]ome part by the early councils; but in other parts rejected. The matter was compounded by e[s]tabli[s]hing a purgatory; for not consenting to liberate from hell, in order to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] [s]atisfy the advocates of a temporary punishment, they fixed up a middle place, where all the advantages of penal purgation could be enjoyed, without the necessity of contradicting the eternity of hell torments. Indeed under the catholic church, the [s]trait gate, and the narrow way, and the many called, and few cho[s]en, was a good deal laid a[s]ide, and the road made pretty plain by indulgencies and ab[s]olutions. But at the reformation, the matter was brought back to its old bed again, and the cry of their being but a remnant [s]aved, was raised in every pulpit. There has been [s]ome relaxation of late years with almo[s]t every [s]ect of Prote[s]tants; and there is not ju[s]t [s]uch a fury of tumbling great crowds into the tolbooth, as there was in the days of John Knox, and the framers of the Westminster confe[s][s]ion of faith, and catechi[s]ms. Dr. Bellamy, a New-England divine, [s]ome years ago, [s]tated in his pamphlet, that the damned would be to the [s]aved, as the malefactors of a country to hone[s]t people that came to an untimely end by jail or gibbet. Some now preach boldly, not perhaps a total exemption, from future puni[s]hment, but a final re[s]toration from it; [s]o that the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] matter is now brought nearly to what it was in the days of Origen. I do not know that I would be of opinion with the Scotch gentleman, and wi[s]h the matter carried farther, e[s]tabli[s]hing that there is no hell at all; becau[s]e if the thing [s]hould take a turn, it might go to the other extreme, and be all hell; [s]o that none [s]hould be [s]aved; and in[s]tead of univer[s]al salvation, we [s]hould then have the doctrine of the damnation of the whole, bodily. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] THE next day, revolving every thing in his mind, it occurred to the Captain, that the Iri[s]hman might have gone out of town, hearing of an election at a di[s]trict, and have been elected to Congre[s]s. As that body was then [s]itting, he thought it could be no great trouble to go to the hou[s]e, and ca[s]t an eye from the gallery, and [s]ee if the raggamuffin had got there. There was one that had a little of the brogue of Teague upon his tongue, but nothing of his phy[s]iognomy; others had a good deal of his manner; but there was none that came ab[s]olutely up to the physic of his per[s]on. However, being here, the Captain tho't it not ami[s]s to li[s]ten a while to the debates upon the carpet. A certain bill was depending, and made, it [s]eems, the order of the day. Mr. Cogan being on the floor, [s]poke:---Sir, [s]aid he, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf to the chair, the bill in contemplation, is, in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] my opinion, of a dangerous tendency. I will venture to foretel, that, if it goes into a law, the cows will have fewer calves, and the [s]heep le[s]s wool; hens will lay fewer eggs, and cocks forget to crow day-light. The hor[s]es will be wor[s]e [s]hod, and [s]tumble more; our watches go too [s]low; corns grow upon our toes; young women have the [s]tomach ach; old men the gout; and middle aged per[s]ons fainting fits. The larks will fall dead in the field; the frogs croak till they bur[s]t their bags; and the leaves of the trees fall before the autumn. Snow will be found in the heat of harve[s]t, and dog days in winter. The rivers will revert; and the [s]hadows fall to the ea[s]t in the morning. The moon will be eclip[s]ed; and the equinoxes happen at a wrong season of the year. Was it not [s]uch a bill as this, that changed the old [s]tile; that made the eclip[s]e in the time of Julius Cesar; that produced an earthquake at Jamaica, and [s]unk Port Royal? All history, both ancient and modern, is full of the mi[s]chiefs of [s]uch a bill. I [s]hall, therefore, vote again[s]t it. Mr. Bogan was now on the floor, and advocated the good effects of the bill. Sir, [s]aid he, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] chair, I appear in [s]upport of the bill. I [s]ay, it will have a good effect on the physical world e[s]pecially. The ducks will be fatter, the gee[s]e heavier, the [s]wans whiter, the red-birds [s]ing better, and partridges come more ea[s]ily into traps. It will kill rats, muzzle calves, and cut colts; and multiply the breed of oy[s]ters, and pickle cod-fi[s]h. It will moderate the [s]un's heat, and the winter's cold; prevent fogs, and cure the ague. It will help the natural brain; brace the nerves, cure [s]ore eyes, and the cholic, and remove rheumati[s]ms. Con[s]ult experience, and it will be found, that provi[s]ions of the nature propo[s]ed by this bill, have an a[s]toni[s]hing influence in this re[s]pect, where they have been tried. I mu[s]t take the liberty to [s]ay, the gentleman's allegations are totally unfounded; and he has committed him[s]elf, in the matter of his hi[s]tory; the earthquake in Jamaica, not happening in the time of Julius Ce[s]ar; and therefore could have nothing to do with the eclip[s]e of the [s]un. I [s]hall, therefore, vote in favour of the bill. Mr. Cogan ro[s]e to explain; and [s]aid, that he did not [s]ay, that the earthquake at Jamaica, was at the [s]ame time with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] clip[s]e of the [s]un, which happened at the birth of Julius Ce[s]ar. Mr. Bogan ro[s]e to correct the gentleman: It was not at the birth of Julius Ce[s]ar, but at his death, that the earthquake happened. Mr. Hogan was on the floor: Said, he thought he could reconcile the gentlemen on that head. It was well known Julius Ce[s]ar lived about the time of the rebellion in Scotland; a little after Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Jews. As to the earthquake, he did not remember what year it happened; and therefore could [s]ay nothing about it. At this period, the que[s]tion being called, it was put, and carried by a majority of 25. The Captain, [s]atisfied with this [s]ample of Congre[s][s]ional debates, retired, and came to his lodging. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] IT was about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, that [s]ome one, who had read the adverti[s]ement re[s]pecting Teague, came to the Captain, and informed him, that a per[s]on, an[s]wering the de[s]cription, had been lately employed to teach Greek in the Univer[s]ity. Struck with the idea, that the bog-trotter might have pa[s][s]ed himself for a Greek [s]cholar, whereas he understood only Iri[s]h, he [s]et out to the University, to make enquiry. Knocking at the door of the principal, he was admitted; and, being [s]eated, addre[s][s]ed him as follows: Said he, [s]ir, a pede[s]eque of mine, (for talking to the rector of a college, he did not chu[s]e to u[s]e the vulgar terms, waiter, or bog-trotter,) a pede[s]eque of mine, whom I have found u[s]eful, [s]ave that he is [s]omewhat trouble[s]ome in pretending to places of appointment for which he is not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] qualified; a thing, by the bye, too common in this country; where men, without the aid of academic knowledge, thru[s]t them[s]elves into places requiring great learning and ability: (This he [s]aid to [s]latter the man of letters; as if a man could know but little, that had not been forged or furbi[s]hed at his [s]chool): I [s]ay, this pedeseque of mine, has ab[s]conded for [s]ome days; and I have been able to collect no account of him until la[s]t evening, that a per[s]on, having read an adverti[s]ement of mine in the gazette, came to me, and informed, that one, an[s]wering the description I had given, both as to appearance and accompli[s]hments, had been lately employed, as profe[s][s]or of the Greek language, in this Univer[s]ity. Now, though I well know this Pady, as I may call him, to understand no Greek; yet, as he [s]peaks Irish, and has much a[s][s]urance, and little hone[s]ty in matters where his ambition is concerned, I did not know, but he might have impo[s]ed him[s]elf upon you, for a Greek [s]cholar, and obtained a professorship. The principal made an[s]wer, that it was true that a per[s]on from Ireland had been lately employed in that capacity; and that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] [s]hould he be di[s]covered to be an inpo[s]tor, it would be u[s]ing the univer[s]ity very ill. The Captain thought [s]o too; and taking it for granted that it was Teague, expressed his [s]urpri[s]e that they had not examined him, before he was admitted; or at lea[s]t had [s]uch proof by letters as would have had a[s]certained his being qualified. The principal ob[s]erved, that as to examination they had no one at hand to examine, as there were none of the tru[s]tees or profe[s][s]ors of other branches in the university under[s]tood Greek; as for him[s]elf he did not, having not [s]tudied it in early life, and for a [s]eries of years, having giving him[s]elf to politics and mathematics; [s]o that unle[s]s they could [s]end out for a Roman Catholic prie[s]t, or a Scotch clergyman, there was none to examine. The improbability of any per[s]on pa[s][s]ing himself, above all things, for a ma[s]ter of the Greek language on the [s]core of understanding Iri[s]h, was [s]uch, that it never came into their heads to [s]u[s]pect it, [s]o as to demand letters. Had you known [s]aid the Captain, this bog-trotter of mine, (here he forgot the word pede[s]eque) as well as I do, you would not be [s]urpri[s]ed at his attempting [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] any thing; and that he [s]hould be now in your academy giving Greek lectures, understanding nothing but the vernacular tongue of his own country. Here he gave an account of his [s]etting up for Congress, &c. as explained in the preceding part of this narrative. However, wi[s]hing to [s]ee the raggamuffin that he might unkennel him, he was accompanied by the principal to the chamber of the p[s]eudo profe[s][s]or, con[s]idering as he went along, in what manner he [s]hould acco[s]t him; whether he [s]hould break out upon him with a direct invective, or with ironical words; [s]uch as, Mr. Profe[s][s]or, you mu[s]t be a very learned man, not only to under[s]tand Iri[s]h, but Greek: but perhaps the Greek and Iri[s]h language are much the [s]ame. It mu[s]t be [s]o; for I know that a few days ago, you did not understand a word of this, and to acquire a dead language in [s]uch a [s]hort time would be impossible, unle[s]s the living tongue was a good deal a-kin to it. But I had never under[s]tood that Iri[s]h had any more affinity to the language of Athens and Sparta, than the Er[s]e, or the German, or the Welch; however, we mu[s]t live and learn, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] as the [s]aying is; you have [s]hewn us what we never knew before. Conning a [s]peech of this [s]ort in his own mind, with a view to divert the principal, and amu[s]e him[s]elf with Teague, he entered the chamber of the profe[s][s]or; who [s]at in an elbow chair with Thucidydes before him. What was the [s]urpri[s]e of the Captain to find that it was not Teague. In fact, it was a per[s]on not wholly unlike him, e[s]pecially in a hinge of the brogue which he betrayed in his di[s]cour[s]e; for though the profe[s][s]or was really a man of education, having been early [s]ent to St. Omer's, where he had [s]tudied, being intended for a prie[s]t, and under[s]tood not only the Greek, and Latin, but [s]poke French; yet in the pronunciation of the Engli[s]h tongue, he had that prolongation of the [s]ound of a word, and articulation of the vowel O, which con[s]titutes what is vulgarly called the brogue, as being the pronunciation of the native Iri[s]h; who being a depre[s][s]ed people, are mo[s]t of them poor, and wear a kind of mean [s]hoe, which they call a brogue. After an apology to the profe[s][s]or for mi[s]taking him for a certain Teague [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] O'Regan, whom he had in his employment, at the reque[s]t of the profe[s][s]or, the principal and the Captain took [s]eats. The profe[s][s]or [s]aid, His name was not O'Regan, being O'Dougherty; but he knew the O'Regans very well in Ireland. There was a Pady O'Regan in the [s]ame cla[s]s with him at St. Omer's, when he read Craike. That he was a good [s]cholar, and under[s]tood Craike very well; and he would be glad if he was over in this country to tach Craike here; it appeared to be a very [s]carce language; but he had become a pra[s]te, and was now a mi[s][s]ionary to Paraguay, in Sout-America. The Captain punning on his pronunciation of the word Greek; and willing to amu[s]e him[s]elf a little with the profe[s][s]or, could not help ob[s]erving, that he was under a mi[s]take, as to the [s]carcene[s]s of the Craike language in the[s]e States. That there were whole tribes who [s]poke the Craike language; there was that of the heron, and the raven, and [s]everal other fowls. A German profe[s][s]or, who was present, apprehending the Captain to be under a mi[s]take, and willing to correct him, ob[s]erved---It is, [s]aid he, the Creek language, that the profe[s][s]or means. As to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] that, [s]aid the Captain, it is al[s]o [s]poken plentifully in America. There is a whole nation of Indians, on the borders of South Carolina and Georgia, that [s]peak the Creek language; men, women, and children. The profe[s][s]or knowing more of the classics than of the geography of the[s]e United States, and of the heathen gods more than of the aborigines of this country, expressed a[s]toni[s]hment. If what you tell me be a trut, [s]aid he, it is a crate di[s]covery: perhaps de[s]e may have de fragments o' de books o' de philo[s]ophers and poets that are lo[s]t, and de profe[s][s]ors cannot come acra[s]s in deir own countries; but I have tought dat de Craike language was [s]poke only in de Morea, and a little in Ru[s][s]ia, and Con[s]tantinople. The Captain a[s][s]ured him, the principal favouring the mi[s]take, by a grave face, and bowing as the Captain [s]poke, that it was ab[s]olutely the vernacular language of the[s]e people. Why den, [s]aid the other, do dey not get profe[s][s]ors from among[s]t de[s]e, to tache Craike in deir Colleges? Becau[s]e, [s]aid the Captain, we have been heretofore on ho[s]tile terms with the[s]e Indians; and it is but of late that we have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] made a peace. But now, it is to be presumed, we [s]hall have it in our power to procure from them able teachers. The profe[s][s]or was alarmed at this; as [s]uppo[s]ing it would [s]upercede the nece[s][s]ity of his [s]ervices; or, at lea[s]t, much reduce the price of his tuition. He could have wi[s]hed he had not come to this quarter of the world; and was almo[s]t ready, in his own mind, to bind up what he had, and go back to Clogher. So ended their vi[s]it to the Univer[s]ity, and the Captain withdrew. Containing an Anecdote. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] IT may be thought a prepo[s]terous idea, that it could, for a moment, be supposed po[s][s]ible, that the pede[s]eque could have had the a[s][s]urance to pa[s]s him[s]elf for a Grecian. But I had it from the Marquis de la Luzerne, that a friend of his, who was in [s]ome public capacity at Mo[s]cow; and was entertained by a principal inhabitant of the city, was a[s]ked by him, to vi[s]it an academy, where the French language was taught; and at which his [s]on, a young lad, then was. What was the [s]urpri[s]e of the gentleman, to find a Pady from Cork, who under[s]tood not a [s]ingle word of French, or Latin, teaching an unknown gibberi[s]h, which mo[s]t probably was Iri[s]h? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] OUR Chevalier was now at his wits end; not being able to conceive of any other place of amu[s]ement, in which Teague might be found; when all at once it came into his head, (led to it, perhaps, from the reference, in his late conver[s]ation, to the Indian tribes,) that probably he might have fallen in with the Indian treaty-man, and have been prevailed upon to per[s]onate a chief. It appeared to him therefore advi[s]eable to go directly to the [s]ecretary at war, to know if any party of Indians had been lately there to negociate a treaty. Being introduced, and after [s]ome ceremony, acco[s]ting the [s]ecretary, he gave him to under[s]tand why it was that he had the honour to wait upon him, viz. that he had a [s]ervant of the name of Teague O'Regan, an Iri[s]hman, who had been ab[s]ent [s]ome days, and that from a circum[s]tance which happened in the way to the city, he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] had rea[s]on to [s]u[s]pect, he might have been picked up by a certain Indian treaty-man, to [s]upply the place of a Welch black[s]mith, who had died, and had pa[s][s]ed for a chief of the Kickapoos. The [s]ecretary was a good deal chagrined, believing the Captain to be [s]ome wag that had come to make this enquiry by way of burle[s]que on the Indian treaties; and with [s]ome irritation of mind, gave him to under[s]tand, that there had been no Indian treaty-man, or Kickapoo chief there; that no treaty had been held with the Indians for above a month pa[s]t, [s]ince the king of the Togamogans had drawn goods; but treaty or no treaty, it ill became him in the appearance of a gentleman, to throw a burle[s]que upon government, by insinuating that his Iri[s]hman could be impo[s]ed upon them for a chief. I mean no burle[s]que, [s]aid the Captain, a little irritated in his turn; I have had too much trouble to keep him from the Indian treaty-man that was coming here, to be di[s]po[s]ed to je[s]t with [s]o [s]erious an affair. The hair-breadth e[s]cape of going to Congress, or being licenced as a preacher, or being cho[s]en as a member of the philosophical [s]ociety, was nothing to this, as it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-264.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] was [s]o difficult to guard again[s]t it, the Indian recruiters imitating [s]avages, not only in their dre[s]s and painting, but in the dexterity to way-lay and [s]urpri[s]e. I wi[s]h youto know, [s]ir, [s]aid the secretary, that I comprehend your burle[s]que very well. But though you and others may mi[s]repre[s]ent our policy in the Indian treaties, it is ba[s]e irony and ridicule to insinuate that the Indians we treat with, are not chiefs. Chiefs, or no chiefs, [s]aid the Capain, I am not [s]aying, nor care; but only wi[s]h to know if you have been in[s]tituting any treaty with my Teague, who has been absent [s]ome days. I will be much obliged to you to withdraw from my office, [s]aid the [s]ecretary. I [s]hall withdraw, [s]aid the Captain; and not with that re[s]pect for your understanding and politene[s]s, which I could have wi[s]hed to entertain. I have addre[s][s]ed you with civility; and I was entitled to a civil an[s]wer; but I [s]ee the "in[s]olence of office," is well enumerated, by the poet, among[s]t the evils that make us [s]ick of life. Your humble [s]ervant Mon[s]ieur Secretary; I [s]hall trouble you no further. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-265.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] RETURNING to the Indian Queen, a play bill, for the evening, had announced the performance of the tragedy of Macbeth, and a farce called the Poor Solider. A party of the gentlemen, from the public hou[s]e, had taken a box; and the Captain agreed to go with them to the play. Having delivered their tickets, and being admitted to the box, it [s]truck the Captain to ca[s]t his eye upon the pit and galleries, and ob[s]erve if he could any way de[s]cry the phy[s]iognomy of Teague. As before, when with the [s]ame view he [s]urveyed the members of Congre[s]s, he could di[s]cover [s]everal that a good deal resembled him; but yet not the identical per[s]on. The curtain being now drawn the play began. Nothing material occured during the performance of the tragedy, [s]ave that when the witches came in, there was one in her cap and broom[s]tick who[s]e features a good deal re[s]embled the Irishman's, and who, had [s]he not been an old [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-266.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] woman and a witch, might have pa[s][s]ed for Teague. The Captain was [s]truck with the re[s]emblance of feature, and long frame of the bog-trotter, covered with a [s]hort gown and petticoat; and borrowing a gla[s]s from one that [s]at in the box with him, endeavoured to reconnoitre more perfectly, and could have [s]worn that it was the mother, or [s]i[s]ter of Teague, that had ju[s]t came from Ireland, and joined the company. The tragedy being ended, the farce began to be acted, and who [s]hould come forward in the character of Darby, but the long [s]ought for Teague. The fact was, he had before appeared in the tragedy, in the character of an over-grown red-headed witch. It was more natural for him to appear in the character of Darby his own countryman; for he [s]pake with the brogue naturally, and not by imitation. The managers had had him all the while of his ab[s]ence from the Captain, under tuition, teaching him his part, which was not difficult to do; the manner and pronunciation being already his own. It was this had induced the managers to take him up, as a [s]ub[s]titute; the per[s]on who actually played the part of Darby, being, at this time, out of the way. As the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-267.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] natural [s]qual of a pig is [s]uperior to an imitation of it; [s]o it was allowed by the audiance, that Teague exceeded the p[s]eudo Irishman that u[s]ually performed this part. All were plea[s]ed but the Captain, who[s]e [s]en[s]e of propriety could [s]carcely re[s]train him from throwing his cane at the begtrotter. Thought he with him[s]elf, what avails it that I prevented him from taking a [s]eat in a legi[s]lative body, or from preaching, or being a philo[s]opher; if after all, he has relinqui[s]hed my [s]ervice, and turned player; a thing, no doubt, fitter for him, than the being a [s]enator, or clergyman, or philo[s]opher; becau[s]e he can appear in [s]ome low character in the farce or comedy, and come off tolerably enough. For though among[s]t the dramatis per[s]onae of learned bodies, there are Tony Lumpkins, and Darby M`Faddins in abundance, yet there ought to be none; and Teague had better be on the [s]tage than in [s]uch capacities, [s]ince he mu[s]t be [s]ome where. But to leave me without notice, after all my civilities to him, is ungrateful, and de[s]erves all that I can [s]ay bad concerning him. I [s]hall give my[s]elf no farther trouble on this head; but let him take his cour[s]e. I mu[s]t endeavour to find another [s]ervant who can [s]upply his place. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-268.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] THE foregoing had been the reflections of the Captain during the exhibition of the farce. But the play being ended, and having come home, the next day he began to put his re[s]olution in practice; and to think how he could [s]upply him[s]elf with another [s]ervant. It [s]truck him to purcha[s]e a negro; and mentioning this to the company, at breakfa[s]t, at the Indian Queen, one of the people called Quakers, who was pre[s]ent, and overheard the conver[s]ation, made an apology for the liberty he took in making [s]ome objections. Friend, [s]aid he, thee appears to be a di[s]creet man, from thy behaviour, and conver[s]ation; and if thee will not be offended, I would a[s]k if thee can[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-269.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] reconcile it with thy principles, to keep a [s]lave. As to that, [s]aid the Captain, I have thought upon the [s]ubject, and do not [s]ee any great harm in the matter. If we look to inanimate nature, we [s]hall find, that the great law is Force. The Carte[s]ians call it pre[s][s]ure and [s]uction: The Newtonians call it attraction and gravitation. The [s]un, the large[s]t body in the univer[s]e, endeavours to draw all towards it; while the le[s][s]er globes [s]truggle to fly off at a tangent. The den[s]e air takes place of the rare; and the heavier particles of water cau[s]e the lighter to recede. The tall oak over[s]hades the under wood. There is a predominancy, and [s]ubordination in all things. In the animal creation, the weaker is always [s]ubject to the [s]trong; who even devour them, when the fle[s]h [s]uits their appetite: and the very teeth and jaw-bone of carnivorous animals, [s]hew the intention of nature, that they [s]hould make a prey of living creatures. Do you blame yourselves, when you [s]ubjugate elephants, or hor[s]es, or oxen of the plough, to your u[s]e? What right have you to invade the liberty of a playful young colt, more than of an African inhabitant? Or have you not as good a right to take up a negro, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-270.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] put him to your work, as you have to cut a calf, and manufacture him for the draft? In this ca[s]e, there is a difference, [s]aid the Quaker; a negro is a human creature, and po[s][s]e[s][s]es all the natural rights of man. That may be, [s]aid the Captain. But what are the natural rights of men? Are they not finally re[s]olvable, as in the inanimate world, into power on the one hand, and weakne[s]s on the other. Who is it that ab[s]tains from dominion, when he has it in his power to a[s][s]ert it? Power is the great law of nature; and nothing but the pacts or conventions of society can contravene it. I [s]hould think myself ju[s]tifiable in making any man a [s]lave to an[s]wer my purpo[s]es, provided I treated him well while he was [s]uch. This I take to be the only condition which the law of rea[s]on annexes to the enjoyment of [s]uch property. I may be warranted in taking, and managing an animal of the hor[s]e kind; but it is my indi[s]putable duty not to abu[s]e him by cau[s]ing him to [s]uffer famine, or endure too much toil. The [s]ame with any other animal that I en[s]lave; there is a tacit condition annexed to the grant which the law of nature gives, viz. That the [s]ervice be exacted with moderation; and proper [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-271.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] nouri[s]hment be provided. I admit al[s]o, that humanity would dictate that a [s]lave ought to be con[s]ulted as much as is consistent with my convenience. For in[s]tance; if I had the Grand Turk in my power, as he has been accu[s]tomed to a [s]oft and effeminate way of living, it would be hard to put him all at once to maul rails, or clearing out meadow ground, or the like; or if it [s]hould fall in my way to have Catherine of Ru[s][s]ia in that capacity, as [s]he is a women of an elevated mind, it would be inhumane to put her to the lowe[s]t drudgery, [s]uch as [s]crubing out rooms, and carrying water from the pump; but rather indulge her if I could afford it, with a more ea[s]y employment, e[s]pecially as [s]he is an old woman, of knitting [s]tockings and carding wool. There is no man would be more di[s]po[s]ed to treat a [s]lave with tenderne[s]s than my[s]elf; but to deny me of my right altogether of making one, or of trafficking for one when made, is carrying the matter too far. So much for the right of en[s]laving. But if we put it on the principle of what will conduce to the aggregate happine[s]s of mankind, we [s]hall find it to be, that there [s]hould be ma[s]ter and [s]ervant, or in other [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] words, owner and [s]lave. The economy of nature illu[s]trates this, in the [s]ub[s]erviency of one thing to another: But, independent of any illu[s]tration, it mu[s]t be known on reflection, and is felt in experience, that all are not competent to all things; and in the ca[s]e of temporary [s]ervants, much time is taken up in contracting with them for their remanence; and it is a considerable time before they get into the habit of our [s]ervice; and having it in their power to retire from us, when inclination may direct, there is an in[s]ecurity in the attachment. But as the [s]lave has the master always to provide for him; [s]o ma[s]ter has the [s]lave always to [s]ub[s]erve him: and thus, by a conjoint intere[s]t, the felicity of both is promoted, and the [s]um of human happine[s]s increa[s]ed. Hence it is, that mo[s]t nations have made u[s]e of [s]laves. The patriarch Abraham, had three[s]core and ten [s]ervants born in his hou[s]e. What were the[s]e but [s]laves? The Jews, his descendants, had bond-men, and bond-women: Were not the[s]e [s]laves? The Roman [s]laves were more in number than the citizens; and among[s]t the Greeks, the mo[s]t virtuous of them, viz. the Spartans, kept in their [s]ervice the mo[s]t depre[s][s]ed of all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] [s]laves, the Helotes; who, when we consider the black broth, the food, and severe life of the ma[s]ters, mu[s]t have lived on poor fare, and in a laborious [s]ervice indeed. But it may be [s]aid, that example of wrong never con[s]titutes right. Grant it; but if you examine the capacities, and even inclinations of men, will you not find, that [s]ome are qualified only to be [s]laves. They have not under[s]tanding to act for them[s]elves. Nor do all love freedom, even when they have it. Do not many surrender it; and prefer ki[s][s]ing a great man's back[s]ide, to being independent? It is not always, even from the views of advantage, that men are [s]ycophants; but from an ab[s]tract plea[s]ure in being drawn into the vortex of others. There is a plea[s]ure in [s]lavery, more than unen[s]laved men know. Why is it, that, even after the convul[s]ion of a revolution in a government, in favour of liberty, there is a natural tendency to [s]lavery; and it finally terminates in this point. The fact is, a [s]tate of liberty is an unnatural [s]tate. Like a bone out of place, the mind, in an individual, or political capacity, [s]eeks the condition of a ma[s]ter or [s]ervant; avoiding, as the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-274.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] particular propen[s]ity may be, the one or the other. There cannot be a greater proof that this is founded in nature, than the common moral ob[s]ervation, that the greate[s]t tyrants, that is, the wor[s]t ma[s]ters, make the mo[s]t abject [s]laves: And, vice ver[s]a, that the mo[s]t [s]ub[s]ervient of mankind, when you give them power, make the wor[s]t u[s]e of it: All this becau[s]e, in the[s]e ca[s]es, the per[s]ons are mi[s]placed, and not in their proper [s]tations. Julius Ce[s]ar made a humane generous master; but he would have made a very intriguing, trouble[s]ome valet de chambre. It would have been impo[s][s]ible to have got any good of him. On the other hand, Tiberius would have made an excellent ho[s]tler, and taken a beating, with as much re[s]ignation, as a hou[s]e beagle, who is u[s]ed to it. So that it evidently is the provi[s]ion of nature, that there are materials of [s]lavery; and the fault of tho[s]e, whom [s]he intends for ma[s]ters, if they do not make [s]laves. But as it is difficult to determine, a priori, who are intended for [s]lavery or freedom, [s]o as to make a judicious di[s]tribution, things mu[s]t take their cour[s]e; and the rule be, catch, catch can; and every man have a [s]ervant when he can get one. It is in vain to be [s]queami[s]h, and [s]tick at colour. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] It is true, I would rather have a white per[s]on, if [s]uch could be got; as I prefer white to black; e[s]pecially in the [s]ummer [s]ea[s]on, as being a more light and airy colour. Thy rea[s]oning, [s]aid the Quaker, is more rhetorical than logical; and thy analogies of nature, and hi[s]torical proofs, cannot [s]o far oppre[s]s the light within, as to make me think, that it is given to thee, or me, to make [s]laves of our [s]pecies. As to that, [s]aid the Captain, I am not clear that a negro is of our [s]pecies. You may claim kindred with him, if you plea[s]e; but I [s]hall not. I [s]hall not di[s]pute that with thee, [s]aid the Quaker: for I perceive thee does not give credit to what the book [s]ays of the fir[s]t man, and his de[s]cendants: But will thee not grant me, that the African, though not of the [s]ame [s]tock, is, at lea[s]t a man; that is of the human genus, though the [s]pecies of the white and the black may not be the [s]ame; if [s]o, ha[s]t thou more right to en[s]lave him, than he thee? Grant it, [s]aid the Captain; for my reasoning tends to that, and re[s]olves the right into the power. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-276.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] If [s]o, [s]aid the Quaker, thee may be the [s]lave in thy turn. Doubtle[s]s, [s]aid the Captain; and it is not of [s]o much con[s]equence who is [s]lave, as that there be one. It is better that the foot be foot, and the head be head; but if there is a conver[s]ion, neverthele[s]s, let there be head and foot. It is nece[s][s]ary that there be domination and [s]ubjection, in order to produce a compound improvement and advantage. You could [s]ee by the Quaker's countenance, that he thought the rea[s]oning sophistical; but as he did not know very well what he could [s]ay more, he was [s]ilent. Containing Remarks. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-277.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] IT is thought by [s]ome, the Captain was not [s]erious in thus advocating the cau[s]e of [s]lavery. Be that as it may, he omitted [s]ome [s]erious arguments, that naturally pre[s]ent them[s]elves on that [s]ide on which he rea[s]oned: For in[s]tance, it [s]trikes me at fir[s]t blu[s]h, that there can be no moral wrong in catching a young African, and bringing him away from his own happiness to pur[s]ue ours. For if there were, is it to be [s]uppo[s]ed, that humane and ju[s]t per[s]ons, would promote and [s]upport the evil, by purcha[s]ing [s]uch negro, or retaining him, and his offspring, when purchased. For, on the principle that the receiver is the thief, or, to [s]peak more strictly, a thief, the purcha[s]er of the African takes the guilt along with the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion; and, in the language of the law, every act of retainer is a new tre[s]pa[s]s. For the evil [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-278.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] of the original act, if there be evil in it, cannot be rendered pure by the filtration of purcha[s]e, and retaining. So that the holder of the negro, in the tenth transmission, is an aider, or abettor, of the original act of taking; if I may u[s]e the word aider, or abettor, in a ca[s]e of tre[s]pa[s]s; where, by the definition of the law, all who any ways concur in the act, and further it, are principals. The holder of a negro mu[s]t, therefore, look back to that act which fir[s]t made him, or an ance[s]tor, a [s]lave; and if he cannot ju[s]tify this, he cannot ju[s]tify the retaining him in servitude:--- What a con[s]equence mu[s]t this be! There is no man that pretends to humanity, much le[s]s to religion, would be [s]afe in being the po[s][s]e[s][s]or of a [s]lave. The only way therefore to get rid of the difficulty is to ju[s]tify, ab origine, traffic in all [s]uch property. That it is ju[s]tifiable I have no doubt. Is there any religious denomination, except the fanatical people called Quakers, that have made it a term of communion not to hold a [s]lave. In admitting to church privileges, I have never heard, of the que[s]tion a[s]ked, Have you any negroes, and do you keep [s]laves? If it was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] a matter of con[s]cience, would not conscientious per[s]ons them[s]elves make it. The a[s][s]emblies or [s]ynods of the Presbyterian church, or conventions of the Episcopal, in America, have [s]aid nothing on this [s]ubject. Is an omi[s][s]ion of this kind reconcilable with the idea, that it is a natural evil, or a moral wrong. In the phrenzy of the day, [s]ome weak minded powers, in Europe, begin to consider what is called the African trade as a moral wrong, and to provide for a gradual abolition of it. If they will aboli[s]h it, I approve of its being done gradually; becau[s]e, numbers being embarked in this trade, it mu[s]t ruin them all at once, to de[s]i[s]t from it. On this principle, I have always thought it a defect in the criminal codes of mo[s]t nations, not giving licence to the perpetrators of offences, to proceed, for a limited time, in larcenies, burglaries, &c. until they get their hands out of u[s]e to the[s]e pur[s]uits, and in u[s]e to others. For it mu[s]t be greatly inconvenient to thieves and cut-throats, who have engaged in this way of life, and [s]pent time, and expended money, and run great ri[s]ks in acquiring [s]kill in their employment, to be obliged all at once to withdraw their hands, and lay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] a[s]ide picking locks, and apply themselves to indu[s]try in other ways, for a livelihood. The law of Penn[s]ylvania on this principle, has provided for the gradual abolition of the [s]lavery of negroes. For tho[s]e who have got them could not do without them, no more than a robber could do without the money that he takes, being pre[s][s]ed by [s]ome great nece[s][s]ity to make u[s]e of that expedient to recruit his pur[s]e. All tho[s]e therefore who have been originally taken from the coa[s]t of Africa, and deprived of liberty, or de[s]cended from [s]uch, and inheriting [s]lavery, when recorded agreeably to the act in que[s]tion, continue [s]laves, and for life, and their offspring to a certain period. But were we to entramel the ca[s]e with political or moral doubts respecting the original right of caption, and subjugation, the difficulty would exi[s]t of reconciling it with natural right to hold a [s]lave for a moment, even whether the law [s]anctioned it or not;  in which ca[s]e we [s]hould find it nece[s][s]ary to go as far as the fanatics in religion, and [s]et our [s]laves free altogether. It is from not duly attending to this circumstance, that ab[s]tract rea[s]oners talk of abolition; a doctrine which, however [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-281.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] absurd, is becoming the whim of the day; and the phren[s]y [s]eems to gain [s]uch ground, that I would not wonder if they would next a[s][s]ert that it is unlawful to u[s]e the servitude of hor[s]es, or other bea[s]ts of burden, as having a natural right, to live in the fields, and be as free as mankind. The be[s]t way to avoid extremes, is to check the principle; I hold the right of ab[s]olute [s]ubjugation, of whites, blacks, and browns of all nations, again[s]t gradual abolition, or any abolition what[s]oever. This being the only con[s]i[s]tent principle, [s]hort of an ab[s]olute emancipation, made in[s]tantly; for in no mean is there rea[s]on, or a re[s]t for con[s]cience. That it is of importance to [s]ettle the consciences of [s]ober minded per[s]ons in Pennsylvania, clergymen, and members of the Pre[s]byterian church e[s]pecially, who have negroes, mu[s]t be well known from that tenderne[s]s of con[s]cience, for which [s]uch are remarkable. Some, indeed, carry their ideas of the extent of duties [s]o far, as not to omit grace to meat, or the formal worship of prayer, reading chapters, and singing p[s]alms, on the [s]et occa[s]ions, on any con[s]ideration what[s]oever; what is more, will not [s]have a beard, on the Sabbath day, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-282.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] for a cow. Now, [s]hould they, by any means, come once to think of the wickedness of en[s]laving men, there would be no getting them to keep a negro. For tho[s]e of this denomination; and, indeed, mo[s]t, or all others of the Chri[s]tian, hold, that the Africans, though of a [s]able race, is of their own [s]pecies; being de[s]cended from Adam. This being the ca[s]e, a [s]light matter, the bare directing their attention to the [s]ubject, would alarm pious people, and lead them to the favourite maxim of the go[s]pel---"Do to others, as you would have others to do to you." As oppo[s]ed to the enfranchi[s]ement of negroes, generally, and in Penn[s]ylvania in particular, I have been under apprehensions, that [s]ome of our young lawyers in the courts, might plead the con[s]titution of the [s]tate, by which it is e[s]tabli[s]hed that "all men are born equally free and independent." Now admitting that a negro is a man, how [s]hall any ma[s]ter retain him as a [s]lave? On a habeus corpus, he mu[s]t be [s]et at liberty. At lea[s]t I cannot conceive how the judge could remand him to his drudgery. The con[s]titution is the law paramount, and framed by a convention of the people, recognizing the original right [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-283.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] of freedom in a negro, allowing him to be a man; and caries us above the act of the legi[s]lature for the gradual abolition, &c. which by implication [s]eems to [s]uppo[s]e that negroes may be [s]laves:--- An implication incon[s]i[s]tent with the power exerci[s]ed by the law. For if negroes were [s]laves, and [s]o the property of tho[s]e who claimed them, could the legi[s]lature affect that property, without indemnification to the ma[s]ters? I [s]hall [s]ay no more on this head, le[s]t I [s]hould furni[s]h hints to pettifoggers, who may make an ill u[s]e of their information. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-284.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] JUST at this moment a waiter coming in, told him there was a per[s]on without, that is, in the bar room, who wi[s]hed to [s]peak with him. Going out, who [s]hould [s]trike his optics, but Teague. The fact was, being elated with the success of his performance on the [s]tage, attributing that to art which was nature itself, he had counted more upon his accomplishments than he ought to have done, and had made advances to the mi[s]tre[s]s of the manager, who was al[s]o an actre[s]s, and not greatly coveting an amour with the bog-trotter, made a merit of the circumstance, to induce an opinion of fidelity, and informed the manager of the pre[s]umption of the Iri[s]hman. The manager in the mo[s]t unbecoming manner, without either citation, examination, trial, conviction, or judgment, but laying a[s]ide all forms of law, had in[s]tituted an original proce[s]s of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-285.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] him[s]elf, and laying hold of a hor[s]e-whip, had applied this implement to the back and [s]houlders of Teague, and as the Iri[s]hman made an effort of re[s]i[s]tance at the fir[s]t onset, the manager had been under the necessity, by turning the but end of the whip, to knock him down, which he did by a [s]troke above the left eye-brow, which not only bereft him of [s]en[s]es for the pre[s]ent, but a di[s]colouration of the eye for [s]ome days, and a [s]car probably his whole life after. It was this incident had induced him to leave the theatre, and brought him back to the Captain, whom he now accosted in the following manner: Dear ma[s]ter, for the love of [s]halvation, forgive a poor [s]harvant that has been killed this marning with a great cudgel, ju[s]t for nothing at all, but not pla[s]ing a damned whore, that wanted me to [s]tale the manager's cloathing, and go off wid her. This is all that a poor [s]harvant gets by being hane[s]t; but by [s]hant Patrick, and the holy cra[s]s, it is what I de[s]erve for leaving the [s]arvice of a good ma[s]ter, as your anour, and taking up with bog-tratters, and [s]tage players, that would [s]ooner take a cup of wine than the holy [s]acrament, and get drunk every [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-286.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] night in de wake, and go to de devil head foremo[s]t; but if your honour, dear ma[s]ter, will forgive the pa[s]t, and my running away, and laving you, I will come back again, and [s]arve you to the day of judgment, or any langer time that your honour pla[s]es, and clane your boots and [s]purs, and rub down the bay har[s]e; the poor old crature, how aften I have tought of him when I was in my rambles and he was a [s]lape, la[s]te they [s]hould chare him of his oats, and give him nather hay nor [s]traw to ate; for I always liked to take care of a good har[s]e, and a good ma[s]ter; and aften tought of your honour, when I was among the bog-tratters of the [s]tage, and gave you a good name, and was always talking of you and forgot my part, and put the managers in a pa[s][s]ion, who fell upon me, and bate me like a dog. The Captain [s]aw the incon[s]i[s]tency in the relation; one while alleging the tale bearing of the mi[s]tre[s]s, as the occa[s]ion of it; again, a deficiency in the recital of his part; but expecting no truth from the Irishman, cared very little how it came to pa[s]s. The principal thing that occupied his thoughts, was whether to receive the bog-trotter, or di[s]mi[s]s him. He reflected [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-287.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] with him[s]elf on the trouble he had had with him, on his various preten[s]ions to advancement; his unea[s]ine[s]s of mind, and fatigue of body, for [s]everal days pa[s]t, in examining [s]tews, methodi[s]tical conventicles, rumaging philo[s]ophical [s]ocieties, attending elections, and li[s]tening to the debates of Congre[s]s, to [s]ee if he could any where ob[s]erve his phy[s]iognomy, or distinguish his brogue. He could not think of [s]ubjecting him[s]elf to [s]uch uncertainty in the attendance of any [s]ervant, with [s]uch prepo[s]terous ideas, as being a legi[s]lator, philo[s]opher, &c. Again, he con[s]idered, that probably this la[s]t cha[s]ti[s]ement he had received, might have a good effect, in curing him of the freaks of his ambition; and a mind broken and reduced by disappointment, is in a mellow [s]tate, and more capable of receiving the [s]eeds of good advice, than a mind full of vanity or pride, that has never yet received blows. Deliberating on the[s]e grounds, his humanity prevailed, and he determined to receive the raggamuffin into favour. This being [s]ettled, and learning from the Iri[s]hman in what manner he had been inveigled, and drawn away by the manager, to go upon the [s]tage; and that it was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-288.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] only becau[s]e Teague had made advances to a woman that was a whore already, that the manager had made [s]uch an attack upon his per[s]on, he wi[s]hed to puni[s]h him, if it [s]hould appear to be within the province of the law to do it. Accordingly, inquiring what principal lawyer there was in that city, was informed of a certain counsellor Grab. Taking Teague with him, he [s]et out to con[s]ult this gentleman. Coun[s]ellor Grab was in his office, among[s]t large [s]helves of books, or [s]helves of large books; not, as the Latins [s]ay, Co-opertus, aut obrutus, [s]ed comitatus libris; that is, In the mid[s]t of his books. He had on a pair of [s]pectacles, not [s]o much on account of age, as to make the client believe that he laboured under a premature want of [s]ight, from much reading; or, becau[s]e a pair of len[s]es, magnifying the organs of vi[s]ion, gives the appearance of a larger eye, which has a good effect on the per[s]on consulting, impre[s][s]ing the idea of a broader view of things that are before it. Entering, the Captain addre[s][s]ed him[s]elf to the coun[s]ellor, and gave him the outlines of the injury done to Teague; The coun[s]ellor, in the mean time, [s]u[s]pending his reading in a large book, which he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-289.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] before him, printed in Saxon letter, and rai[s]ing his head, until the gla[s][s]es of his [s]pectacles were brought to bear upon the phy[s]iognomy of the Captain. The Captain having fini[s]hed his account, referred him to Teague, the [s]ubject of the battery, for a a more particular detail of the circum[s]tances. Teague was glad of the opportunity of [s]peaking before a learned lawyer, and was beginning to give a relation of the whole affair; but the Captain [s]topped him, bidding him wait until the lawyer [s]hould him[s]elf reque[s]t him to begin. The lawyer was [s]ilent: after having reconnoitered with his gla[s][s]es, one while the Captain, another while Teague, he dropped his optics, and began to read again. The Captain, thinking he had not been [s]ufficiently under[s]tood, recommenced the narration, and gave an account of what he him[s]elf had [s]uffered from the inveigling and detaining his [s]ervant, and the vi[s]ible injury which the [s]ervant himself had [s]u[s]tained. The lawyer was [s]till [s]ilent; and, though he had eyed him while [s]peaking, as a Tu[s]can a[s]tronomer would the moon, yet he applyed him[s]elf again to the reading the black letter, that was before him. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-290.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] The Captain thought it [s]trange treatment; and was, for [s]ome time, at a lo[s]s to know what to think of the matter. But recollecting, opportunely, that the circumstance of a fee had been omitted, he took out his pur[s]e, and threw down two dollars. The lawyer [s]eemed a little moved, but ca[s]t his eye again upon the black letter. Finding the two dollars not sufficient, the Captain threw down two more. The coun[s]ellor rai[s]ed his head from the book, and you might di[s]cern [s]ome dilitation of the mu[s]cles of the face, as bespeaking an approaching opening of the voice; but [s]till there was [s]ilence; and might have been to this hour, had not the Captain recollected, at this moment, what he had all along forgot, that half a joe was the fee of a lawyer. Doubling, therefore, the four dollars that were already down, the lawyer came to his voice, the organs of his [s]peech were loo[s]ed, and taking the gla[s][s]es from his eyes, he gave his coun[s]el as follows: Said he, You have a double remedy in this ca[s]e; again[s]t the manager who inveigled, and again[s]t the [s]ervant him[s]elf: Again[s]t the [s]ervant, on the act of Assembly, if indented; at common law, on the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-291.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] contract to [s]erve. For even a [s]ervant at will, and not engaged for any [s]pecial time, is not at liberty to de[s]ert the [s]ervice of his ma[s]ter, without rea[s]onable notice fir[s]t given. So that you may have your remedy again[s]t the [s]ervant, in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, by bringing the matter before the court of quarter [s]e[s][s]ions; and having time put upon him, as the phra[s]e is, for this dereliction of your [s]ervice; or, an action on the contract, expre[s]s or implied, as the ca[s]e may be, wherein he [s]hall repair, in damages, the lo[s]s [s]u[s]tained. The bog-trotter was alarmed at the idea of an action again[s]t him; and looking wi[s]tfully at his ma[s]ter, exclaimed; Dear ma[s]ter, will you trow de law upon me, dat am as innocent as a [s]hild unborn; and would go to death and damnation for you. Dear ma[s]ter, I [s]uffered enough by de cudgel of dat player, for all de running away I have done; and, God love your [s]houl, keep de law in its own place, and not let it come acra[s]s a poor [s]harvant, that has nathing but as he works and trats about; but let de[s]e grate big books of his honour de lawyer, [s]pake to de manager, for his deceiving a poor [s]harvant, and putting it in his head to run away, and lave a good [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-292.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] ma[s]ter; and his beating him with a grate cudgel into the bargain. I have no de[s]ire, [s]aid the Captain, to pur[s]ue the bog-trotter; as he has made acknowledgments for his fault; but would want the utmo[s]t rigour of the law to be put in force again[s]t the player. You have al[s]o in this ca[s]e a double remedy, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor; by pro[s]ecution on the part of the [s]ervant, and on your part. Nay, the [s]ervant him[s]elf has a double remedy; for he may pro[s]ecute by indictment, or bring his action of a[s][s]ault and battery; or both. I would recommend the action only; becau[s]e, where no indictment is pro[s]ecuted, and the civil action only brought, exemplary damages may be given, as well as reparatory. For in the civil action, it will affect the minds of a jury, that the party has already [s]uffered all that is in the nature of puni[s]hment by a criminal proceeding; and nothing remains with them, but to give reparatory damages. On the part of the ma[s]ter, two kinds of action may be brought; either an action of tre[s]pa[s]s, vi et armis, laying a perquod [s]ervitium ami[s]it; or [s]imply an action on the ca[s]e, for the con[s]equential damage of inveigling the [s]ervant. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-293.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] As to the number of remedies [s]aid the Captain, or the kind of them, I care very little how many there are, or what they are; I want only a good remedy; give me a good [s]wingeing one again[s]t the ra[s]cal, and I care very little what it is called. I [s]hall then, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor, advi[s]e [s]imply an action on the ca[s]e; and count generally on the inveigling, and detaining, and rendering unfit for [s]ervice while in his power. In this mode, the whole circumstances of the injury may be brought together, and [s]ummed up into one point of view; and enhancing the quantum of damages, can expatiate on the value of your [s]ervant, and the [s]pecial occa[s]ion you had for his [s]ervice, at this particular juncture; for I make no doubt he is a valuable servant; and that it has been an almo[s]t irreparable injury to you, to have been defrauded of his [s]ervice at this time. As to his value, [s]aid the Captain, there can be no doubt, not only as a [s]ervant, but in other re[s]pects. I have been offered, or at lea[s]t I [s]uppo[s]e I could have got, an hundred pounds for him, to be a member of Congre[s]s, or to preach, or to go to the Philo[s]ophical Society, or to be an Indian treaty-man; but have refu[s]ed every [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-294.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] propo[s]al made him, or me, for the[s]e purposes; and now to have him kidnapped, and taken off, without fee or reward, and employed as an actor, and beat, and rendered u[s]ele[s]s, at lea[s]t for [s]ome time, into the bargain, is too much for any man to put up with. If there is law in the land, let it be put in force; and this man made an example. The coun[s]ellor had no need of spectacles, to give him[s]elf the appearance of a glaring and broad look, on this occa[s]ion; for the words of the Captain made him [s]tare [s]ufficiently, without the aid of a magnifying medium, to enlarge his optics. He began to take him for a madman; at lea[s]t, in [s]ome degree, deranged in his brain; to talk of his [s]ervant being in request for a member of Congre[s]s, and the like. Yes, continued the Captain, he not only inveigled away a [s]ervant, that was thought fit to be a member of Congre[s]s, and a preacher, and an Indian treaty-maker, and a philo[s]opher, and what not; but has kept me, the[s]e three days, trotting after him, and trying to find him, at election places, and in Congre[s]s boarding-houses, and the hall where they have their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-295.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] debates, and churches, and pulpits, and chambers of philo[s]ophical [s]ocieties, and profe[s][s]or[s]hips, and where not; to [s]ee if I could find him; while this manager had him, in the mean time, at rehear[s]als, teaching him the art of mimickry, for the [s]tage. The coun[s]ellor, in the mean time, had reflected with him[s]elf, that, whether madman, or no madman, the Captain had money, and might be a good client, let his cau[s]e be what it would; and [s]o composing the mu[s]cles of his face, [s]eemed to agree with him; and ob[s]erve, that doubtless the quality and capacity of the [s]ervant would be taken into view, in e[s]timating the damages: That, if it appeared he was not only fit [s]tuff for a [s]ervant; but to be advanced to [s]uch eminent offices as the[s]e, not only the inveigling the embryo legislator, preacher, and philo[s]opher; but the a[s][s]aulting and beating him, and, by that means, di[s]abling him from immediate service, mu[s]t be viewed in the light of an atrocious injury, and in[s]ure a verdict accordingly. Very well, [s]aid the Captain; and I [s]hall wi[s]h to have the matter determined as [s]peedily as po[s][s]ible, as I may be but a few [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-296.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] days in town; and, be[s]ides, as the marks are yet apparent on the face, and, I suppose, back, of the bog-trotter, it will appear to the judges, and jury, without the trouble of witne[s][s]es, what damage he has [s]u[s]tained. The proce[s]s of law, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor, is tedious, but certain; you cannot expect a trial, in this ca[s]e, until the 3d or 4th term; that is, nine months, or a year. How [s]o, [s]aid the Captain? Becau[s]e, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor, it is now two months, or upwards, before the court to which the writ will be returnable. Even if a declaration is then filed, the defendant may imparl until the [s]ucceeding term, which is three months; when if there is no demurer general or [s]pecial, a rule to plead will be taken, which may not be put in until the [s]ucceeding term of three months again: At this term, if there is no replication, rejoinder, [s]urrejoinder, rebutter, or [s]urrebutter, to draw up and file, while the defendant may crave a term, issue will be joined, and at the next term trial. But even after a verdict, there may be the delay of a term, on a motion for a new trial depending; [s]o that in the law [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-297.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] there is delay; but this delay is the price of ju[s]tice. It is a price, [s]aid the Captain, that I will not give for it. If you will bring it about in a [s]hort time to have this fellow flogged, even with half the [s]tripes he has given my [s]ervant, I [s]hall not think the half joe thrown away; but to be a year or half a year about the bu[s]ine[s]s, is putting the matter [s]o far off, that it may as well be omitted altogether. If you could only get him [s]entenced to take a kick or two from my foot, or Teague's, before we leave the city, I [s]hould be [s]atisfied. The lex talionis, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor, makes no part of our law. You can punish only in e[s]tate, not in per[s]on, for a [s]imple a[s][s]ault and battery, as this is. Do you not hang a man for murder, [s]aid the Captain; and why not puni[s]h per[s]onally for an a[s][s]ault and battery? Becau[s]e it is our law, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor; and, in a civil action, the object is damages. A civil action, and damages, are [s]trange phra[s]es, [s]aid the Captain; how can civility and damages, be reconciled. The[s]e are technical terms, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor, which per[s]ons, not of the prosession, are at lo[s]s to under[s]tand; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-298.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] have, in them[s]elves, a di[s]tinct and sensible meaning. Let the terms mean what they will, [s]aid the Captain, it all comes to this at la[s]t--- There is no getting at the manager, under a year, or two year's race for it; before which time, Teague will have forgot the abu[s]e he has received, and I my trouble in running after a [s]trayed Iri[s]hman, through this city; and, therefore, it may be as well to give the matter up, and [s]it down with the lo[s]s. That as you plea[s]e, [s]aid the coun[s]ellor; and putting on his [s]pectacles, ca[s]t his eye again upon the black letter. The Captain, without bidding him ki[s]s his back[s]ide, beckoned to Teague to follow him, and withdrew from the chamber. Having retired; Teague, [s]aid the Captain, this thing of law has been well [s]aid to be a bottomle[s]s pit. The way to it is like that to the [s]hades; \---Facilis de[s]cen[s]us averni; Sed re[s]erre gradus, hic labor, hoc opus e[s]t. This pettifogger [s]eemed to have a thousand remedies at his command, and yet none that would [s]erve us; as the redre[s]s, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-299.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] if any, is to be po[s]tponed to [s]uch a di[s]tant day. I have heard a great deal of the[s]e cattle, and I believe they are be[s]t off that have lea[s]t to do with them. They have [s]o much jargon of technical terms, that the devil him[s]elf cannot under[s]tand them. Their whole object is to get money; and, provided they can pick the pocket of half a joe, they care little about the per[s]on that con[s]ults them. The fir[s]t lo[s]s is the be[s]t; you had better put up with the currying you have got, than have my pocket picked, on pretence of redre[s]s a year or two hence, which may, perhaps, prove a century. Teague was contented to put up with the drubbing, and have no more [s]aid about it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-300.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] THE Captain had con[s]oled him[s]elf with the idea that Teague was now cured of his folly, and would no more be di[s]po[s]ed to entertain notions of ambition, and unrea[s]onable projects. He was disappointed in his hope; for that very evening, the Iri[s]hman wa[s]hing down the recollection of his woes with [s]ome exhilerating drink, and though not intoxicated, but enlivened only, he came to the Captain: Said he, Dear ma[s]ter, what would your anour think, if a poor [s]harvant [s]hould turn lawyer; and get a half joe when a cu[s]tomer comes to con[s]ult him in the morning? would it not be better than currying a hor[s]e, and tratting about like a big dog; with no [s]en[s]e to live like a man of fartune, and have a big hou[s]e over his head, and books about him, and take half joes from paple that come to him about their quarrels and batings, through [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-301.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] de town, and [s]ending dem aff as wi[s]e as if dey never had come to him, and de great [s]pectacles, to look like a blind man, dat was blind before he was born, and could [s]ee more than two or three other paple, for all dat; and was a canjurer, and a wizzard, and could take money for nating. Would it not be better, ma[s]ter, than tratting like a fool, and di[s]puting wid paple, and having nating to lay up; but be as poor as a church mou[s]e, or a rat, all the days of our life, and paple laugh after us when we are gone. The Captain was thrown into a reverie of thought, by the [s]peech of the bog-trotter; reflecting, that his pre[s]umption and folly was incurable; for, notwithstanding all that had been [s]aid to him, or [s]uffered by him, his natural propen[s]ity remained the [s]ame; according to the maxim--- Naturam expellas bufurca, u[s]que recurret; You may to[s]s out nature with a pitchfork, [s]he will [s]till come back upon you. Not [s]o much from any further view of reclaiming him, as from indignation, and re[s]entment, again[s]t his pre[s]umption, the Captain projected, in his mind, a farther means of cha[s]ti[s]ing him. He had heard of a work-hou[s]e, in this city, into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-302.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] which refractory [s]ervants are committed, and put to hard labour; [s]uch as pounding hemp, grinding plai[s]ter of Paris, and picking old ropes into oakum. He re[s]olved to have the raggamuffin put into this a while. Counterfeiting, therefore, an approbation of his project of becoming lawyer, doubtless, [s]aid he, the profe[s][s]ion of the law is a profitable bu[s]ine[s]s, where money is very ea[s]ily got, by the bare breath of the mouth. Neverthele[s]s, it requires time and [s]tudy to qualify for this profe[s][s]ion. Nay, the introduction to the [s]tudy, by being put under an eminent lawyer, in full practice, is it[s]elf very expen[s]ive. An hundred pi[s]toles is [s]ometimes the fee. This I could not very well afford; but I have an acquaintance in this town, who, I am persuaded, would be willing to oblige me, and will take le[s]s. I will call upon him early to-morrow, and [s]ettle the contract. Accordingly the next day, calling on the keeper of the work-hou[s]e, he gave him an account of his refractory [s]ervant, and with a gratuity of a couple of guineas, obtained his con[s]ent, to take the bog-trotter under his direction, and give him a few le[s][s]ons in picking oakum, and grinding plai[s]ter of Paris, and pounding hemp, not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-303.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] withholding, in the mean time, a [s]ea[s]onable application of the cow[s]kin, in the intervals of [s]tudy of the[s]e [s]everal branches of the law. For the idea was to be impo[s]ed upon Teague, that this was an office, or as it were an inn of court, or chamber of the Inner Temple; and that the [s]everal flagellations, and grindings, and poundings, were [s]o many le[s][s]ons, and lectures, to qualify him for the practice of the law. It happened, fortunately, that the keeper of the work-hou[s]e was well qualified for the ta[s]k; for, in early years, he had been put an apprentice to an attorney, and had [s]ome opportunity of attending courts, and hearing the names of books to which the advocates referred in their pleadings; but having a turn for extravagance, and a di[s][s]olute manner of life, he had come to poverty, and, through various [s]cenes, to jail. There, by addre[s]s, he had gained the good will of the jailor's daughter, whom he married; and, by the intere[s]t of his new father-in-law, having obtained his liberation, he was, from acting as deputy jailor, in a [s]eries of time, at length promoted to be the keeper of this work-hou[s]e. Indeed, from his employment, being acquainted with the pri[s]oners, and finding [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-304.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] him[s]elf [s]ometimes intere[s]ted in their fate, and being led to attend their trials, he had, even in his la[s]t capacity, been a good deal about courts, and heard law phra[s]es and books mentioned. Accordingly, when Teague was introduced, which was that very afternoon, he had, at his command, the names of the abridgers, and reporters, and commentators of the law, and the technical terms in the commencement and proce[s]s of a [s]uit; [s]o that, when the key was turned, and, after having [s]tript him of the linen doublet that was upon him, he began to give him the fir[s]t application of the cow[s]kin, he told him this was reading Wood's Institutes; and when, after this, he was sentenced to an hour or two's hard labour, at grinding plai[s]ter of Paris, this was called Coke upon Littleton; and when the employment was varied, pounding hemp, or picking oakum, it was called Hawkin's Pleas of the crown, or Fo[s]ter, or 4th Black[s]tone, &c. When the poor bog-trotter, reduced to a [s]keleton, living on bread and water, complained of the hard u[s]age, and offered him[s]elf a [s]ervant for life, to curry hor[s]es and bru[s]h boots, to any Chri[s]tian creature that would take him [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-305.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] out of that place; he was told, that, as he had begun the [s]tudy of the law, he mu[s]t go through with it; that that was but the commencement of the [s]uit; that in a year's time he would learn to file a declaration; in another, to put in a plea; in a third, to join i[s][s]ue; and in a fourth, to conduct a trial; that unle[s]s a bill of exceptions had been filed, or there was a motion, in arre[s]t of judgment, or a writ of error brought, he might be admitted the fifth, and begin to practice the [s]ixth year: At all events, provided he would [s]ubmit himself, with due application, to fa[s]ting, and cow[s]kinning, and grinding plai[s]ter of Paris, pounding hemp, and picking oakum, he might be a lawyer the [s]eventh year, and wear [s]pectacles, like coun[s]ellor Grab, and take half a joe when he thought proper. I know not by what [s]imile to repre[s]ent the howl of the Iri[s]hman, at this pro[s]pect of the duration of his woes. It was like that of a wolf at the bottom of a well, or a dog that had lo[s]t his ma[s]ter, or a cow her comrade, or [s]ome forlorn wanderer that has mi[s][s]ed the way, and given up all hopes of being extricated from the wilderness. At the various applications of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-306.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] cow[s]kin, he had jumped, and cur[s]ed, and [s]wore, and prayed, and be[s]eeched, and promi[s]ed a thou[s]and [s]ervices, of currying hor[s]es, and bru[s]hing boots, and trotting where ever he was ordered, provided they would [s]et him at liberty. When employed at the hard labour, before mentioned, he had groaned, and cur[s]ed the law, the coun[s]ellor, and the half joe. Ah, thought he, if my dear ma[s]ter, the Captain, knew how hard a ting it was to [s]tudy law, and to fa[s]t widout ating or drinking, and be bate wid a cow-[s]kin, he would not have given the hundred pi[s]toles, nor the half of it, to have had me kicked and cuffed in dis manner: I would give body and [s]houl into the bargain, if I could [s]ee him once more at that iron gate there, to [s]pake to him, and be[s]ache him to take me out of this purgatory. He was a good ma[s]ter; and when I was a fool, and wanted to be a member of Congre[s]s, and prache, and be a phalo[s]ophar, he told me, Teague, you are a fool; and what they would do wid me there; how they would bate me, and ate me, and take de [s]kin aff my back, and make a cow or a [s]hape od me; and now I am wor[s]e than a cow or a [s]hape, or a hor[s]e in de tame; for I am cut, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-307.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] curried, black and blue; till my fle[s]h is raw, and a cholic in my belly, wid fa[s]ting; and all to [s]toody dis law. The devil take coun[s]ellor Grab, and de half joe. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-308.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] THE Captain having been led to think [s]o much of law, of late, was [s]truck with the idea of vi[s]iting courts of ju[s]tice, and hearing [s]ome of tho[s]e ca[s]es argued, which come before them. Understanding that a court was then [s]itting, he resolved to take the opportunity of the interval of Teague's purgation, in the workhouse, to amu[s]e him[s]elf with the pleading of the advocates. Accordingly, repairing to the court hou[s]e, he took his place amongst the crowd, and li[s]tened to what was going forward. What came before the court was a motion in arre[s]t of judgment. A Jonathan Mun had been indicted, and found guilty of "felonoiu[s]ly taking and carrying away water out of the well of Andrew Mab." It was moved in arre[s]t of judgment, that larceny could not be committed of water in a well, it being real property; for it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-309.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] was a di[s]tinction of the common law, that larceny could not be committed of things real, or [s]avouring of the realty, Black. 232. 2 Ray. 470. Hawkins, &c. So that taking away the [s]oil was merely a tre[s]pa[s]s; and taking away the water could be no more. It was an[s]wered, that water being fluitans, et mobilis, could not be con[s]idered as real property; that an ejectment would not lie for water, but for [s]o many acres of land covered with water, Yelv. 143. 1 Burr. 142. Becau[s]e it was impo[s][s]ible to give execution of a thing which is always tran[s]ient and running, Run. 36. quotes Cro. Jas. 150. Lev. 114. Sid. 151. Thence it is that in a grant of the [s]oil it is nece[s][s]ary, as we [s]ee from old forms, to add the right of ways, woods, and water-courses, Lilly. Con. 132. and 179. Bridg. Con. 321. That whatever might be [s]aid of water in its natural bed on the [s]oil, as water in a running [s]tream; yet a well being dug by the labour of hands, the water thus acquired, mu[s]t be counted as per[s]onal, not real property. Barbcray, Titius, and Locke. That at a well, the water being drawn up by the bucket, and thus by one act [s]eparated from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-310.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] freehold, and by another taken from the bucket, it becomes a [s]ubject of larceny; as in the law of corn, trees, or gra[s]s growing. For if the[s]e be [s]evered at one time, and at another time taken away, it is larceny. Hawk. Pl. Cr. 93. It was replied, that an ejectment would lie of water in a well; for here the water is fixed in a certain place, within the bounds and compa[s]s of the well; and is con[s]idered as part of the [s]oil. Run. 37. That, ex vi termini, in the indictment, "out of the well," it mu[s]t be con[s]idered as water ex, out of, or from the well; that is, water [s]evered by the very act of taking; for otherwi[s]e it would have been expre[s][s]ed, by "water out of the bucket" of Andrew Mab; not out of the well; and [s]o the taking could not be larceny, but tre[s]pa[s]s; as in the ca[s]e of a tree that is cut down at one time, and taken away at another; or apples growing on a tree, or [s]haken down and gathered from the [s]oil; the fir[s]t being a tre[s]pa[s]s, the second larceny. Curia advi[s]ari vult. The Captain whi[s]pering to lawyer Grab, enquired what difference it made in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-311.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] puni[s]hment, whether it was larceny or trespass? He was an[s]wered, that in the one ca[s]e it was hanging by the common law, and in the other to pay the value of the property. A very material difference indeed, [s]aid the Captain, to depend on [s]o nice a di[s]tinction. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-312.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] THE Captain had now lei[s]ure to reflect on the predicament in which he left Teague; and thinking he might have had what was [s]ufficient to cure him of his folly, or at lea[s]t re[s]train it, thought of making a vi[s]it to the hou[s]e of employment, or [s]ending to liberate the valet. This thought running in his head, he naturally [s]ugge[s]ted it to a gentleman with whom he was, at this time, in conversation, on indifferent [s]ubjects; the gentleman lodging at the [s]ame inn, or public hou[s]e, and [s]eeming to be a per[s]on of considerable [s]hrewdne[s]s and di[s]cernment, not only of the affairs of men in general, but of the [s]pecial [s]pirit and character of the[s]e times. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-313.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] Said the gentleman; The folly of your man has certainly been very great, to suppose, that he could be qualified to [s]u[s]tain the profe[s][s]ion of an advocate, and to practise law: For, though in this, as in mo[s]t other profe[s][s]ions, "the race is not always to the [s]wift, nor the battle to the [s]trong;" but the people that [s]heweth favour; that is, take up an opinion of abilities, where there are none; yet your [s]ervant, having [s]o little, even of the [s]emblance of qualification, it would be counting too much on the circum[s]tance, to promi[s]e great [s]ucce[s]s in his ca[s]e. His pro[s]pect of advancement would be much more certain in the political career. You [s]eem, by your account, to have di[s]couraged him in taking a feat in the legi[s]lature; and would not wi[s]h now to contradict your[s]elf: yet why not indulge him in taking a place in the executive of [s]ome government. As far as I [s]ee, with that ambition which is natural to him, you will find him but of little u[s]e, as a waiter; and you may as well let him do [s]omething for him[s]elf, as not. If appointed in the department of finance, he can u[s]e clerks; and, in a very [s]hort time, he may learn to write his name, [s]o as to give his [s]ignature to any paper; and this, with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-314.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] the help of clerks to do the accountant business, would be [s]ufficient: At lea[s]t, there have been tho[s]e in the[s]e departments, who have been approved, and yet could do little more. Should he even become a governor; furni[s]hed with a [s]ecretary, he can be at no lo[s]s to compo[s]e his me[s][s]ages, or other communications, to individuals, or public bodies. But what I would propo[s]e, and will [s]uit him be[s]t, will be to go into the general government; and, under this, the diplomatic line will be eligible. He might be appointed con[s]ul to the port of Cork or Dublin; or the Barbary States; or other places: Or he might go as ambassador to the grand Mogul; or envoy extraordinary to the king of England; or other princes or potentates in Europe. If you [s]hould think of favouring him in this career, it will be nece[s][s]ary for him to appear at the levee of the pre[s]ident, that he may be introduced with a certain gradual etiquette of advancement. What! [s]aid the Captain; introduce a ragged bog-trotter to the pre[s]ident of the United States! Not ragged, [s]aid the gentleman; you can have a pair of breeches made for him; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-315.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] and put [s]hoes upon his feet: a [s]word will be nece[s][s]ary; and [s]ome other articles of equipment. And when you bring this into view with his making his fortune, you will not con[s]ider it as advancing much for a per[s]on whom you wi[s]h to [s]erve. The Captain began to think there was weight in the ob[s]ervations of this gentleman; and that it might be proper to let the bog-trotter have a chance of doing what he could: Accordingly, he wrote a note to the keeper of the hou[s]e of employment, to liberate him for the pre[s]ent. The [s]tate of politics at this time, and the pro[s]pect of Teague's advancement, we [s]hall leave to the Third Volume of this work.

For this rea[s]on, he would con[s]ider it as a great happine[s]s, could he be induced to tran[s]late [s]ome work of merit; and give it in the beautiful garb of his expre[s][s]ion. By this addre[s]s, and the addition of a pen[s]ion, the author was induced to undertake the tran[s]lation of Tacitus. Now, what government, with great art, got Gordon to do, I have done of my own accord; that is, to amu[s]e my[s]elf in ab[s]tract compo[s]ition; regarding words only, and letting men of place alone. Neverthele[s]s, as the [s]ale of the[s]e is not certain; and if I [s]hould find it an expen[s]e, rather than a profit, to proceed in the work, I may quit it, and fall foul of the public mea[s]ures, tho[s]e who di[s]charge the public tru[s]t, at the pre[s]ent time, may not be altogether [s]afe. It were, therefore, wi[s]e policy in [s]uch, to a[s][s]i[s]t the [s]ale as much as po[s][s]ible; and it might not be ami[s]s, in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, to buy up, each of them, a number of copies I do not know that I have any thing to [s]ay of the pre[s]ident of the United [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-317.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] States; or that I would [s]ay it, if I had; nevertheless, it might not be ami[s]s for him, on the principle of pre[s]ervation, and, agreeably to that univer[s]al prudence he has ever [s]hewn, to take a few; perhaps 50 might [s]uffice. The [s]ecretary of the trea[s]ury, and the [s]ecretary at war, might take, between them, about 500. As to the [s]ecretary of [s]tate, he is [s]uch a [s]kin-dried philo[s]opher, that an author would make as little out of him, as a fly would out of a weather-beaten bone; and [s]o, it is of little consequence to him, whether he buys one at all; for I believe I [s]hall not trouble my head about him. As to the Congre[s]s that have [s]at [s]ince the adoption of the federal con[s]titution, they need not put themselves to the expence, individually or collectively, of purcha[s]ing one pamphlet; as I am determined not to be bought off by them; but in a work which I [s]hall by and by publi[s]h, will canva[s]s, freely, the respective demerit of their votes. I have not yet written any of this work; but I have it all in my mind; and if I had a ready amanuen[s]is, to take it down, could give a volume in a [s]hort time. The whole gradation of officers and place-men, under government, are a good deal in my power. Not that I would de[s]cend to attack them; but I might affect the [s]y[s]tem by which they are supported. A pretty liberal purcha[s]e, therefore, on their part, might be money not ill laid out. The men that are upon the government of Pennsylvania, would find their account, in making it worth my while to let my fingers run in this way, a while longer. Peream ne [s]cribam; I mu[s]t write; and if I [s]hould break out upon them, I know not where I might end. The End of the Second Volume.

I well know, that it will not all at once, and by all per[s]ons, be thought to be the model of a perfect [s]tile, for it is only the perfectly in[s]tructed, and delicately di[s]cerning that can di[s]cover its beauties: and perhaps none will be more apt to pa[s]s them by than the learned of the academies, and the mo[s]t ver[s]ed in grammar rules of writing, for there is a greene[s]s in the judgment of the [s]chool critics with re[s]pect to what is [s]imple and natural in compo[s]ition. To illu[s]trate this by anology. Let a dancing ma[s]ter pa[s]s his judgment on the movements of the be[s]t bred man in life; and not finding in his po[s]ition and attitudes, an evident conformity to the le[s][s]ons of the [s]alatory art, he will conclude that he has not been taught to move with propriety. He does not know that it is this very circumstance that con[s]titutes the excellence of the movements of the ea[s]y and perfectly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-323.jpg) \- external link  - Page vi. ] genteelman; to wit, that when you observe him, it will never once come into your mind that he thinks of his attitudes or po[s]itions in the lea[s]t; but that every movement is ju[s]t as it happens, and without any intention on his part. Ars e[s]t celare artem. To wit; It is the [s]ecret of good ta[s]te and perfection in behavior to conceal that you ever think of it at all. So it is the mo[s]t perfect proof of a good [s]tile, that when you read the compo[s]ition, you think of nothing but the [s]en[s]e; and are never [s]truck with the idea that it is any otherwi[s]e expre[s][s]ed than every body would expre[s]s it. That [s]tile, is not good, where it appears that you have not dared to u[s]e a word without thinking a long time whether you ought to u[s]e it; that, in the di[s]po[s]ition of words, you have carefully [s]tudied which ought to go fir[s]t and which la[s]t; and, that your [s]entence has a cadence which could not come by chance; but is the effect of de[s]ign and art. I acknowledge that no man will ever write a good [s]tile that has not well [s]tudied, and exerci[s]ed him[s]elf in writing, [s]electing with a mo[s]t perfect delicacy, in all ca[s]es; the proper term; but he mu[s]t go beyond this, and be able to deceive the world, and never let it come into their heads that he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-324.jpg) \- external link  - Page vii. ] hath [s]pent a thought on the [s]ubject. But it is not one in five hundred that is born with that [s]en[s]ibility of nerve as to be able to attain with the help of great in[s]truction and practice, a perfect judgment in the u[s]e of words. It is for this rea[s]on that I am ambitious of the prai[s]e of writing well [s]o far as re[s]pects language. For it requires no uncommon [s]tructure of nerves, or organization of the brain to produce good [s]en[s]e; the ma[s]s of mankind is equal to this. Language, as it is the peculiar gift, [s]o it is the highe[s]t glory of our [s]pecies; and the philologi[s]t is to be con[s]idered as cultivating the mo[s]t u[s]eful and ornamental of all arts. Pur[s]uing therefore [s]olely the u[s]e of words, I do not de[s]cend profe[s][s]edly to think of [s]en[s]e; neverthele[s]s, if at any time there [s]hould be found ideas that have [s]ome con[s]i[s]tency and meaning, they may de[s]erve attention, as much as if it was the primary object of my work to expre[s]s them; for it is not their fault if I [s]et little [s]tore by them, and think more of the dre[s]s that I put upon them than I do of them[s]elves. I am happy to find that in the review of this publication, given in Young's magazine, my ideas of the merit of the [s]tile, is recognized, and fully ju[s]tified. And as my work may be well [s]uppo[s]ed, to have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-325.jpg) \- external link  - Page viii. ] a much more exten[s]ive circulation, and to live longer than that mi[s]cellaneous performance, I have thought it not ami[s]s, for the honor of the critics to extract [s]ome part of the ob[s]ervations which have been made by them, and which are as follows: "The author of the work before us, is H. H. Brackenridge, well known in the literary world for his treati[s]e on the oeconomy of Rats, a [s]atirical compo[s]ition, in which under the veil of allegory, he designates the mea[s]ures of the federal government; as al[s]o for his hi[s]tory of Weazles, in which the [s]ame [s]trokes are given to tho[s]e at the helm of our affairs, in a different fable, and narration. In the pre[s]ent work which he entitles Modern Chivalry, he disowns the idea of any moral or [s]entiment what[s]oever, and propo[s]es [s]tile only as the object of the compo[s]ition. And to this object, in our opinion, he [s]crupulou[s]ly adheres; for though on [s]ome occa[s]ions, there would [s]eem to be a [s]emblance of idea, yet this we mu[s]t attribute to the imagination of the reader, ju[s]t as in looking upon a plai[s]tered wall, attentively for a long time, you will conceive the inequality of the [s]urface, or accidental [s]cratchings, to be the [s]hape of birds and bea[s]ts, or the letters of the alphabet. Yet as rea[s]on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-326.jpg) \- external link  - Page ix. ] in this ca[s]e will correct the fancy, and bring to mind that there is really no character or image there, there being none intended; [s]o on a peru[s]al of the work in que[s]tion, looking a long time for [s]en[s]e, you may at la[s]t conceive that you ob[s]erve [s]ome glimmerings of it, yet when you recollect that you have it from the author him[s]elf that he means none, you will be [s]en[s]ible that it is nothing more than the accidental combination of words which has given this picture to the mind. Stile, then, which is his object, mu[s]t al[s]o be ours, in our view of the publication. For, to give a [s]imile; if a manufacturer of cloth, or a taylor that forms it into ve[s]tments, [s]hould come forward, and produce each his work, to be con[s]idered merely as to the manufacture, or making up, without regard to the materials of the woof and warp in the one ca[s]e, or the wearing in the other, it would be ab[s]urd to enquire of the[s]e when nothing was proposed to you re[s]pecting them, by the artists them[s]elves. Confining our[s]elves therefore to the [s]tile of this performance, we ob[s]erve, that it has what is the fir[s]t characteri[s]tic of excellence; viz. Simplicity. This con[s]i[s]ts in the choice of the plaine[s]t and mo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-327.jpg) \- external link  - Page x. ] familiar words, and in the arrangement of the words in their natural order. There is a great difference between a vulgar term, or phra[s]e, and that which is common, and comes fir[s]t upon the tongue, in ea[s]y and familiar conver[s]ation. It is the mistake of this di[s]tinction which leads [s]ome writers to avoid the phra[s]e that any one would u[s]e, and [s]eek out what is uncommon. Hence there appears a variation in the words they put upon paper, from tho[s]e which they them[s]elves would u[s]e in conver[s]ation. And why this? Ought not language to be preci[s]ely the [s]ame whether [s]poken or written. Per[s]picuity is the natural re[s]ult of simplicity, and needs not to be laid down as a different characteri[s]tic. For can there be ob[s]curity in that compo[s]ition where the mo[s]t familiar word is u[s]ed, and that word put in its proper place. This brings to mind the definition of [s]tile by Swift; "proper words in proper places." There can be nothing more ea[s]y than the compo[s]ition of our author, His writing [s]avours of the [s]kill of an artificer who after many years exercitation in his art, acquires a power of accompli[s]hing his work by a habit of the fingers, independent of any application of the mind. So that while in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-328.jpg) \- external link  - Page xi. ] the [s]tile of others there is an appearance of exertion, here there is what a superficial ob[s]erver would call carele[s][s]ne[s]s, but which the [s]ound critic will di[s]cover to be the re[s]ult of a perfect ma[s]tery of all that relates to language. It is pretty generally believed that our [s]tile has been con[s]tantly degenerating from the time of queen Anne, in who[s]e reign flouri[s]hed tho[s]e immortal penmen, Swift, Addi[s]on, Arbuthnot, Tillot[s]on, Bolinbroke. &c. If the [s]tile of Mr. Brackenridge is examined, and compared with tho[s]e models, it will be found to be in the [s]ame pure, [s]imple attic ta[s]te. We [s]hall therefore not he[s]itate to recommend it as a re[s]torer of all that is correct and beautiful in writing." So far the reviewers. I have [s]aid that I was happy to find that the[s]e have had the good ta[s]te to find out what I my[s]elf had thought of the composition. But as I wi[s]h at all times to let the reader, into a knowledge of my real [s]entiments, I will confe[s]s that the[s]e are merely words of cour[s]e with me, and that I was not happy to find my work prai[s]ed in any re[s]pect; becau[s]e I wi[s]hed to have a quarrel with the critics; and this not because I love war, ab[s]tractedly con[s]idered; but becau[s]e in this ca[s]e I [s]hould have had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-329.jpg) \- external link  - Page xii. ] an opportunity of [s]hewing my polemic talents. Nay, expecting an attack, I had prepared a number of good thoughts in my mind, to be u[s]ed in my conte[s]t with them. What is more I had actually written a copy of ver[s]es in the Hudibra[s]tic rhyme and manner, for their u[s]e, in which I con[s]idered them as Mu[s]kitoes, or flies of [s]ome kind, that were trouble[s]ome to men; and though the occa[s]ion fails, yet there can be no impropriety in giving to the public tho[s]e [s]trokes of [s]atire which lay dormant in my mind. As the[s]e would apply more particularly to an attack upon me; yet the e[s][s]ay being in general terms, it may appear without a particular circum[s]tance to call it forth; merely as a [s]pecimen of what I could do had there been occa[s]ion for it. And the in[s]ertion will be excu[s]eable, when it is con[s]idered how painful it is to be fru[s]trated in what we propo[s]e as our plea[s]ure. I have known a good man wi[s]h to have bad news true, merely becau[s]e he had related them: and we may conceive a [s]aint vexed at not finding a man dead, when he had dige[s]ted a funeral [s]ermon in his mind, and was ready to bury him. On this principle, therefore, and in [s]pite of the critics, I will have my ver[s]es publi[s]hed: they are as follows: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-330.jpg) \- external link  - Page xiii. ] THE critic fir[s]t po[s][s]e[s][s]'d the earth, And by his rules gave authors birth. You may be ancient: critic, hark! Were you with Noah in the ark? In what compartment were you [s]een? 'Mong[s]t creatures clean or the unclean? The critic, [s]ir's, the natural father Of every [s]nifling, [s]nuffling author; And when you nod or [s]nore or [s]leep, We [s]hly on po[s]teriors creep, And rou[s]e you to a bright exertion, Of all your faculties; you whore[s]on. How can there be idea of beauties, Unle[s]s the critic genius [s]hew't-us? The angle of the [s]ight obtu[s]e, Can [s]ee no more than doth a goo[s]e, Whil[s]t we with micro[s]copic eye, Examine as you would a fly, See through the crevices of fancy, As far as human eye[s]ight can [s]ee, Tell where there is or is not Grammar; What phra[s]eology wants hammer--- Or file to make the ver[s]e run [s]moother, Where [s]ound is har[s]h, or term uncouther. I grant you [s]ee defects and errors, Of tho[s]e in genius your [s]uperiors: The [s]kin however [s]moothly curried, To a flea's eye is deep and [s]urrowed. His optics may perceive a wart, That grows upon the un[s]een part, But for the beauty of the frame, It is above the ken of them--- Thus critics tell that bard divine Has a rough word in [s]uch a line, Or that the [s]acred poem [s]carce Can bear the trot of [s]uch a ver[s]e, That feeble author in [s]uch [s]entence Has not the vis, the [s]pirit inten[s]e, That Pega[s]us was lame when he rode, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-331.jpg) \- external link  - Page xiv. ] Over this or that dull period: They tell, but never felt the force, Of genius in his rapid cour[s]e. What? did not Quintilian fully, Develope all the prai[s]e of Tully? And 'mong[s]t the Greeks, the great Longinus, Who may be ju[s]tly [s]til'd his highne[s]s, With critic judgment join the fire, Of Heaven it[s]elf? who can go higher? From your vile accu[s]ation who[s]e's [s]afe? Not even the elder [s]caliger Jo[s]eph, Who had a mind as big's a mountain, Could all defects and beauties contain, And [s]hew'd that Homer was inferior, And Virgil hit perfection nearer. Have you the a[s][s]urance [s]ir to [s]peak, Again[s]t the Roman worth and Greek? So much we hear I believe that no man's, Tongue is [s]till of Greeks and Romans; For if di[s]pute [s]hould ri[s]e pa[s]t curing, Which way 'tis be[s]t to make our urine, And each [s]hould argue [s]tiffly his way, All mu[s]t give up, the Greeks pi[s]s'd this way. But there in modern times is Bently, Who [s]ung of Richard Blackmore daint'ly. I grant it, critic, there's a thou[s]and; The li[s]t beginning has nor knows end. They [s]warm in millions from the flood--- The Hebrew critics fir[s]t drew blood; And this is what is meant by Babel Where all were critics that were able. The Rabbin and the Talmudi[s]t, Fought hand to hand and fi[s]t to fi[s]t, About the pentateuch of Mo[s]es; Their tales, the wilde[s]t [s]tuff, God knows is. If there has been [s]ome Grecian critic, Above the offspring of a [s]eed-tic; Yet where is one in modern days Who can de[s]erve that [s]hare of prai[s]e? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-332.jpg) \- external link  - Page xv. ] For metamorphos'd down to vermin, Who can the various [s]hapes determine. And [s]mall and great are prone to mi[s]chief, And every clan and [s]ect has his chief. They [s]warm like Caledonian clu[s]ter, When the Mac Neils and Camrons mu[s]ter; Or as when hou[s]e wife [s]preads her [s]ugar, With water mix'd, each in[s]ect bugar, Relinqui[s]hes pots, tubs and pails, And for the booty [s]preads his [s]ails. Thus all the race of critics gather, Around the foot[s]teps of an author, Bite through his overalls and [s]tocking, And biting [s]hins, you know's no joking. Who now a days fits down to write Uninterrupted by a bite? Unle[s]s he takes good care and puts on, A pair of leggins or has boots on. They [s]ay of Reynard who loves gee[s]e, That when oppre[s]s'd with [s]warm of fleas He takes in's mouth a lock of wool, And gradually retires to pool; The fleas by [s]ecret in[s]tinct led, Fly from the tail and trunk to head, With [s]peed each mother's [s]on of them goes To [s]eek the promontory of no[s]e, And when no more remains abaft, Fox [s]hakes his head and leaves the raft. Who could find out by book or [s]ermon, An equal way t' allude the vermin, Would merit a rich premium more, Than vers'd in philo[s]ophic lore, The member who di[s][s]ects a glow-worm, To [s]ee if 'tis a bea[s]t and no worm, I wi[s]h [s]ome virtuo[s]o won'd, Who natural hi[s]tory under[s]tood, Di[s][s]ect a critic, [s]hew his jaw teeth, Whether they are quite [s]mooth or [s]aw-teeth, Re[s]embling butterfly or a[s]p, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-333.jpg) \- external link  - Page xvi. ] Or [s]harp and pointed like a wa[s]p; And by the grinders edge determine, Corn-eating or carnivrous vermin. I'd give, my[s]elf, a golden medal, To know if't has a brown or red tail, And whether when it moves it goes on An hundred feet or half a dozen; But many gla[s][s]es mu[s]t be ground out, Before the[s]e my[s]teries can be found out. I leave it to [s]ome great Linaeus, Who may by this be fam'd as he was. The reviewers in Young's Magazine, may [s]ee from hence how well it was for them, though unfortunate for me, that they have dealt in approbation [s]olely. The prettie[s]t part of the hi[s]tory of any author, is his war with the critics; and as that prince's reign, [s]eems unintere[s]ting where we are not amu[s]ed with [s]ieges and battles, [s]o the life of an author is dull and monotonous where we hear of no litigations with a Bavius, or Maevius, a Dennis, or a Colly Cibber. It is true I have heard one ob[s]ervation made, viz. that though my [s]tile is excellent of the kind; yet it is but of one kind, and as Swift [s]aid of him[s]elf that he could never ri[s]e to the [s]tile of an oration or a [s]ermon, [s]o it would [s]eem to be the ca[s]e with me, that I am competent only to that humble [s]pecies of diction which [s]uits the di[s][s]ertation, but ri[s]es not to the [s]well [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-334.jpg) \- external link  - Page xvii. ] of lofty oratory. It is true this is the [s]tile I have u[s]ed in the memoirs of the Captain; becau[s]e it is the [s]tile which [s]uits [s]imple narrative. Neverthele[s]s, it is not with me as it was with Swift; and in this re[s]pect, I am his [s]uperior; for I can ri[s]e to the [s]well of the highe[s]t pipe of diction. And to evince this, I will here produce an oration delivered by me about two years ago, when I officiated in the capacity of Chaplain to the light infantry company of Pittsburgh. I produce it only as a [s]ample of [s]tile; for as to other merit I will not answer for it; and if the learned [s]hould not think it, in point of [s]entiment, worthy of my fame, let it be my apology that the company at who[s]e call I was, and military di[s]cipline being [s]trict, I was obliged to obey at a [s]hort notice; the company I [s]ay, having given me but about two hours warning, the compo[s]ition bears the marks of ha[s]te, not having that condensation of [s]entiment which deliberation gives But of this let the public judge. I give it as delivered. The Oration. "What is the object for which a [s]oldier ju[s]tifiably draws his [s]word? the protection of per[s]onal and [s]ocial right. This is comprehended under one word, LIBERTY. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-335.jpg) \- external link  - Page xviii. ] By this we are to under[s]tand the natural liberty of man, independent of government; or liberty in a [s]tate of [s]ociety, and government. The fir[s]t being but ideal, it is the la[s]t to which our thoughts are directed in the u[s]e of this word. What then is liberty? It is the enjoying under [s]ome form of government, an equality of rights: an equal right to [s]peak, and an equal right to act: where no one can or dare arrogate a [s]uperiority of power or privilege. Who would not ri[s]k a life for [s]uch a blessing? Who would not immolate a hecatomb of foes who [s]hould dare to invade it. Caesar; I admire thy talents, I prai[s]e thy virtues; but in the face of nations, on the height of the world, thou dared[s]t to u[s]urp a [s]uperiority over brave men. The [s]oul of Brutus, or of Ca[s]ius could not brook it; the [s]oul of Cato or of Ca[s]ta could not brook it; every Roman felt the in[s]ult, and approved the act, that took away thy life. When under[s]tood and felt, what are the charms of Liberty? When po[s][s]e[s][s]ed and enjoyed, what are its effects: greatness of thought, and greatne[s]s of conduct. Can the va[s][s]al think nobly? Can the dependent mind act boldly? No, "there is a lion in the way," and cowardice benumbs the faculties. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-336.jpg) \- external link  - Page xix. ] Are mankind [s]en[s]ible of this? There have been tho[s]e who have borne honorable te[s]timony of it. Shall I give you proofs? I recur not to the academies to bring thence the [s]entiments of philo[s]ophic men. I depict not tho[s]e who have fought for liberty. I give you the [s]en[s]e of a people who had enjoyed it; who had lo[s]t it, and who had been re[s]tored to it. Stating the occa[s]ion, I [s]hall give it in the words of Plutarch. "Philip and the Macedonians had [s]ubdued the Grecian [s]tates. The[s]e calling in the Romans, [s]ubmitted to their authority, and received garri[s]ons in all their cities. Titus Flaminius, who commanded the Roman forces, beat the Macedonians, and reduced them to their own territories. The Grecian [s]tates were [s]till en[s]laved, but had changed their ma[s]ters. The Ætolians had thence taken occa[s]ion to a[s]k them, whether it were not matter of much consolation that, though their chains weighed heavier, yet they were now neater and better poli[s]hed than formerly? Whether Titus were not de[s]ervedly admired by them as their benefactor who had unshackled the feet of Greece and tied her up by her neck? Titus vexed hereat, made it his reque[s]t to the [s]enate, and at la[s]t prevailed in it, that the garri[s]ons in the[s]e cities [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-337.jpg) \- external link  - Page xx. ] be di[s]charged, that [s]o the Grecians might be no longer debtors to him, for a partial but entire favor. The I[s]thmian games were now renewed, and multitudes [s]at crowded in the theatre to [s]ee the exerci[s]es; for Greece, who of late days not only found re[s]pite from war, and was in full possession of peace, but entertained farther hopes of regaining her liberty, made holiday for it. As the[s]e were celebrating, [s]ilence was commanded by [s]ound of a trumpet, and the cryer, [s]tepping from amid[s]t the [s]pectators; made proclamation, that Titus Quintus, the procon[s]ular general, having vanqui[s]hed king Philip and the Macedonians, re[s]tored the Corinthians, Locreans, Phoceans, Eubaeans, Achaeans, Pthiotaeans, Magnitians, The[s][s]alians, and Perribaeans, to their own country, laws and liberty; took off all impo[s]itions upon them, and withdrew their garri[s]ons thence." At the fir[s]t, many heard not at all, and others did not di[s]tinctly hear what was [s]aid; but an odd kind of bu[s]tle and [s]tir there was in the theatre, [s]ome wondering, [s]ome a[s]king, [s]ome crying out to the cryer, "Repeat that again, repeat that again." When therefore fre[s]h [s]ilence was made, the cryer rai[s]ing his voice, his [s]peech [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-338.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxi. ] more ea[s]ily reached the ears of the company. The [s]hout, which in that extacy of joy they gave, was [s]o incredibly great that it was heard to [s]ea. The people all jumped upon their legs; there was no farther regard to the diver[s]ions they came for, but all fell a leaping and dancing, and hugging one another; and all [s]alute Titus with the title of [s]aviour and defender of Greece. The [s]trength there is in voices, and the many relations we have of the wonderful effects of it, were [s]een verified upon this occa[s]ion: For the crows that were then accidentally flying over the [s]tage, fell down dead upon the [s]hout. For the voices being numerous, and the acclamations violent, and the parts of the air [s]eparated from each other, they could no longer give [s]upport to the birds, but let them tumble; unle[s]s we [s]hould rather imagine the[s]e crows to fall and die, [s]hot through with the noi[s]e as with a dart." Are the pre[s]ent inhabitants of that country [s]en[s]ible of the value of liberty? They are not. They are en[s]laved by the Ottoman power. Could they be re[s]u[s]citated to a [s]en[s]e of this magic word; this extatic [s]entiment, what would be their [s]en[s]ation? What the acclamation? The Theban, the Achean country would hear it, all Attica [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-339.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxii. ] and Sparta would re[s]ound. The Ægean and Corinthian [s]eas would tremble. Mount Olympus and Helicon would triumph. The Gods on the one, and the Mu[s]es on the other, would celebrate the fe[s]tival. But O! Poetic and philo[s]ophie country, where my mind ranges every day; whence I draw my be[s]t thoughts; where I conver[s]e with the [s]chools of wi[s]e men, and [s]olace my[s]elf with the company of heroes, thou art lo[s]t in [s]ervitude, and great mu[s]t be the revolution that can extricate thee thence. Let me con[s]ole my[s]elf with the pro[s]pect of a nation, who, after more than a thou[s]and ages of barbarian conque[s]t and feudal tyranny, have emerged to liberty. It is France I have in view. O glorious people? Liberty de[s]cended not to you. But it is your acqui[s]ition. You have broke the fetters that en[s]lave you, and tyranny has been put under foot. The legi[s]lative and judicial authority of your government has been rendered independent of your monarch, and the monarch reduced to a [s]imple executive power. Shall the sovereigns of Europe con[s]pire to rein[s]tate him in his ab[s]olute dominion? Shall they hope to [s]ubdue a nation of brave men contending for liberty: Why do the heathen rage [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-340.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxiii. ] and the people imagine vain things." Sooner [s]hall the clouds of the atmo[s]phere re[s]train the electric fluid, or the object [s]truck upon re[s]i[s]t the electric [s]hock: Sooner [s]hall the height of hills and the weight of mountains repre[s]s the caverned air, and earthquakes cea[s]e to bur[s]t, than the generous flame of liberty in this enlightened nation, can be extingui[s]hed and lo[s]t. Noble nation, you do us too much honor in [s]aying that you drew from us the in[s]piration of liberty. You drew it from your[s]elves. The Monte[s]quieus, the Rousseaus, the Voltaires, the Abbe Raynalls of your country. We felt the like [s]pirit; and re[s]i[s]ted the Briti[s]h power, and were aided by you in the conflict. May you enjoy that liberty which you a[s][s]i[s]ted us to po[s][s]e[s]s; may your example give that liberty to [s]urrounding kingdoms which you your[s]elves enjoy. The mind contemplating the [s]ubject is enlarged, and travels from [s]tate to [s]tate, and from kingdom to kingdom hailing the voice of liberty. It is not in the nature of things that [s]uch a renovation [s]hould take place at once. But the day may not be far di[s]tant when Spain and Sardinia, Sweden and Ru[s][s]ia, Germany and Poland may hear the voice of liberty; when Turky in Europe, and the i[s]lands of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-341.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxiv. ] the Archipelago may hear the [s]ound, and with an acclaim [s]urpa[s]sing the I[s]thmean voice, convul[s]e the heavens with the impul[s]e. Pur[s]uing the thought, what would be the effect of [s]uch a re[s]urrection of the dead? The expre[s][s]ion which I have incidently u[s]ed has given me a [s]imile. It would re[s]emble the re[s]u[s]citation of the dead at the la[s]t day, when the inhabitants of the earth recovering limbs and new bodies, [s]hall rai[s]e their voice. Great will be their exultation; great their acclaim. They will [s]hout, and with an emulation not unplea[s]ing to the Almighty, [s]truggle to [s]urpa[s]s his yet re[s]ounding trump it[s]elf." A copy of the preceding oration was [s]ent by me to the Abbe Gochin, with whom I have been in habits of intimacy the[s]e forty five years, and was by him tran[s]lated into elegant French. It was the peru[s]al of this that brought me acquainted with the Jacobin clubs of that kingdom, and induced Mr. Claviers to make honorable mention of me at the bar of the a[s][s]embly. The fact is, as may be [s]een from the oration, I po[s][s]e[s]s great ver[s]atility of [s]tile, and va[s]t compa[s]s of [s]entiment and imagination. Nature intended me for a writer, and it has always been my ambition. How [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-342.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxv. ] often have I [s]ighed for the garrets of London; where I have read hi[s]tories, manners, and anecdotes of Otway, Dryden, and others, who have lived in the upper [s]tories of buildings, writing paragraphs, or e[s][s]ays in pro[s]e or ver[s]e. I have lamented my hard fate that I was not one of the[s]e. Was I to go to London, of which I have [s]ometimes thought, my fir[s]t object would be to vi[s]it the aerial man[s]ions of the[s]e divine inhabitants. There is not a garret where any of the[s]e have dwelt, or where any of their de[s]cendents now dwells, that I would not rummage to find papers, [s]craps and remains, of what may be [s]till there. I would at any rate vi[s]it mo[s]t of the pre[s]ent men who live by their wits, and conver[s]e with them, indulging that plea[s]ure which one takes in a con[s]imilarity of genius. It was on this principle that the la[s]t time I was in the city of Philadelphia, I made enquiry of the book[s]ellers, if there did not begin to be in that city [s]ome of the[s]e garret people? I was told by Dobson of a certain M`Comas, a Scotchman, that had come over about two years ago, and was in that way: that he had written paragraphs for the gazettes, and occasionally e[s][s]ays for the magazines; and that he lived in [s]uch an alley, I forget the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-343.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxvi. ] name of it, but that he had not [s]een him for [s]everal weeks; and [s]uppo[s]ed he was engaged in preparing [s]ome work for publication. With the advantage of this hint, [s]etting out, I found the alley, and by description, the hou[s]e; when knocking at the door, an old woman opened it, to whom addre[s][s]ing my[s]elf, I enquired if Mr. M`Comas, the author, did not live there? He did live here, [s]aid the old lady, but about two weeks ago he died, and left me a quarter's rent unpaid, This is all a poor woman gets by lou[s]y authors and [s]uch truck that keep writing night and day, and biting their nails, and mumbling to them[s]elves, like witches or warlocks, that I was frightened out of my wits many a night, as he was tramping about in the garret over my head and talking to him[s]elf. I was [s]truck with the undervaluing manner in which this old lady [s]poke of the author, and being in [s]ome pa[s][s]ion, you old jade [s]aid I, are you not [s]en[s]ible of the honor done you in having a genius for your tenant; a man that with a [s]ingle [s]troke of his pen could make you immortal. Ay mortal, [s]aid [s]he, I am a poor enough mortal to want my quarter's rent, with his writings and fangles; I would rather have a per[s]on that would [s]it [s]till, and hold [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-344.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxvii. ] his tongue, and [s]leep in my hou[s]e, than a raving crazy brained creature like him, that made more noi[s]e than the rats, and was behind with his rent when he died, not leaving a pair of breeches or an old coat that would [s]ell for the expence of burying him. By this time I had a little compo[s]ed my mind, and [s]uppre[s][s]ed my re[s]entment, and told her I would pay her the quarter's rent for the honor of the cloth, if [s]he would give me leave to vi[s]it the cele[s]tial man[s]ion where the bard had re[s]ided. Accordingly, depo[s]iting the rent, which was two [s]hillings and [s]even pence, I was permitted to a[s]cend or rather climb up a ladder with broad [s]teps of plank, to the habitation which was the [s]econd [s]tory, for it was a low building, with two apartments, the one on the lower, and the other on the upper flooring. The roof was low, and did not permit a tail man as I am, to [s]tand upright on my entrance. Looking about, by the help of an opening in the weather-boarding of the gable end, I di[s]covered a few papers, which I took to be manu[s]cripts, lying in a corner near a kind of [s]tool, with a board before it, nailed to the gable end, on which he u[s]ed to write, and making a perqui[s]ite of the[s]e in lieu of my two [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-345.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxviii. ] shillings and [s]even pence, I de[s]cended: nor have I any rea[s]on to repent of my vi[s]it, or the [s]um paid, for among[s]t the[s]e I have di[s]covered [s]ome [s]craps of great merit, and particularly a fini[s]hed poem, of considerable length, with the title of Cincinnatus, in Hudibra[s]tic ver[s]e; a kind of rhyme of which I am fond. I [s]hall not, therefore, [s]cruple here to in[s]ert the poem in this introduction, as a [s]pecimen of what this man's manner was. I know it will immediately be [s]urmi[s]ed by [s]ome, that the whole is a fiction, and that I my[s]elf have written this poem, and that the [s]tory of an author, &c. is an invention to make it the more intere[s]ting to the reader, and to keep my[s]elf out of [s]ight and behind the curtain; in the [s]ame manner, as Cervantes, in his Don Quixotte, pretends that his hi[s]tory is a translation from a Moori[s]h writer, Cid Hamed, if I forget not; and the author of the Adventures of a Guinea tells us of his tracing the work to its repo[s]itory in manu[s]cript, from a [s]ingle [s]heet which he found, if I remember right, wrapt round a pound of pepper which he had bought at the [s]hop of a grocer. At any rate, though I may not be accurate, as to the la[s]t circum[s]tance, yet I mean to [s]ay in general, that, as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-346.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxix. ] many writers of fictitious works, in order to give them an air of truth and reality; or to delight the reader by relating [s]ome accidental manner of coming at what was nearly lo[s]t, invent tales of finding [s]hreds and [s]craps of compo[s]itions, and thence tracing to the [s]ource; or that by taking lodgings that had been before occupied by [s]ome poet or philo[s]opher, they di[s]cover in an old trunk, or el[s]ewhere, the lucubrations which they now offer to the public, [s]o I may be [s]u[s]pected of adopting a common mode of introducing what I myself have written; but the fact is as I have [s]tated. Indeed, upon the lea[s]t reflection, no one would [s]uppo[s]e that I could be the author of the poem; becau[s]e, though it is but a playful [s]atire, and tho[s]e of the Cincinnati who are men of [s]en[s]e, would only [s]mile at the performance, yet there are weak brethren, who might be offended; and I [s]hould not wi[s]h to have a [s]word run through my body, for all the plea[s]ure that a little mirth gives. But as to the man that is dead, nothing can hurt him; and therefore there can be no danger in publi[s]hing what he wrote. The [s]cheme of the poem [s]eems to be, that of a member of the Cincinnati Society with the badge at his brea[s]t coming into a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-347.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxx. ] village, and the people of different descriptions falling in with him occa[s]ionally, and altercating with him re[s]pecting the demerits of the in[s]titution, and the propriety of the emblem which he wore. The introduction is as follows. A Poem. What time the States had [s]ettled peace With adver[s]aries over [s]eas, And troops di[s]banded, it [s]eem'd good, To in[s]titute a brotherhood, Among the chieftains of the war, Of Cincinnati character, Who now laid by their arms and came, To [s]eek an agricultural fame--- On territory they had [s]av'd; For as together they had brav'd, The toils of [s]ervice, wi[s]h'd a tie, At lea[s]t upon the memory, Of that companion[s]hip; hence 'twas, The in[s]titution came to pa[s]s, Of a [s]ociety and badge. At fir[s]t it did provoke the rage, Of [s]everal of the citizens, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-348.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxi. ] As being [s]avouring of de[s]igns, Of a nobility of title; And chevaliering here a little; And hence, when one of the[s]e in's gate, Came to a village of the [s]tate, With badge dependant at his bo[s]om, It [s]eem'd a [s]ingular ro[s]y crozum, And drew attention and [s]urmi[s]e; And every one that [s]eem'd more wi[s]e, Began di[s]cu[s][s]ion of th' affair. A certain pedagogue was there, Did fir[s]t acco[s]t, and a[s]k'd the ri[s]e, And the intendment of device, And why he wore a turkey there, Effigies of a bird of the air, And other [s]uch interrogatories. The Cincinnat who heard the queries, Explain'd the hi[s]tory of the club, And effigy upon the bob; Vidilicet, that having fought, And put the adver[s]ar's to trot, Retir'd from war, like Cincinnatus, And were about to plant potatoes; But fir[s]t in memory of their warfare, And individuals did mo[s]t care for, Had [s]et up club and wore a badge. And what bird have you in the cage, Quoth pedagogue? is it a goo[s]e, That you have cho[s]en for your u[s]e? Or a wild turkey or a [s]wan? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-349.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxii. ] This hurt the Cincinnati man---- Quoth he, I will not [s]ay you mean, T' affront, and throw out with de[s]ign, This [s]arca[s]m on the badge we wear; For 'tis an eagle of the air, And emblematical of power, As having dominion of the lower, The fowls of the [s]tack-yard and the grove; And hence become the bird of Jove, And is device upon the badge, Which you and other fools with rage, Decry and vilify and abu[s]e, As being without [s]en[s]e or u[s]e; Becau[s]e your ignorance is [s]uch, You cannot comprehend it much, The meaning of the hieroglyphic, Or motto that is [s]cientific, Devis'd by [s]cholars that were good, And authors of [s]imilitude. Quoth pedagogue, I own I [s]aw It had a bird's tail and a claw; But never did [s]o far encroach, To look di[s]tinctly on the broach Whether a grey goo[s]e or a drake, That gives him[s]elf i' th' roo[s]t a [s]hake, But what re[s]emblance is there here, To him of Roman character; Who wore no brochet at his button; Or a remarkable e[s]cutcheon; But when he quit the war and battle; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-350.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxiii. ] Return'd t' his harrow and draft cattle, Without a goo[s]e-re[s]embling bauble; Or other bird or bea[s]t, could gabble, A word of Latin or of Greek. But what the phra[s]e it [s]eems to [s]peak? Relinquit omnia, [s]ervare Rempublicam; by the lord Harry, The Roman had not much to leave, And would have laugh'd him[s]elf in's [s]leeve, T' have had the[s]e words applied to him. And you that are of modern time, Were in the [s]ame predicament, Before were to the warfare [s]ent; So that the point is not in this, From whence eulogium takes its ri[s]e, The having left a [s]teer or two, Or an old hor[s]e with which did plow; But your returning to your place, When armies had been [s]ent to gra[s]s; So that 'twere better you had made it, Nunc victor ad aratrum redit: Or [s]ome [s]uch phra[s]eology, De[s]ignating the eulogy, Which really did belong to [s]uch, As not ambitious over much, Return'd from victory and war, To till their ground, and take the care, Of [s]tock upon their farms; but wore, No other en[s]ign than before, With barbarous Latin [s]uch as this, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-351.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxiv. ] A[s][s]um'd for their hypothe[s]is. Quoth Cincinnat, a great Quintilian, You are, and have read books a million; Can give a Latin word to teach us, Which way the Romans pull'd up breeches; Or how tobacco quid in cheek, Was turn'd by the enlighten'd Greek; You cough and grunt by [s]yntax rules Drawn from the pro[s]ody of [s]chools; But though I know not Cincinnatus, Or other Roman that begat us, The club nam'd after him is good And I could [s]hew it if I would; But ea[s]ier to di[s][s]olve the knot By [s]litting no[s]e or cutting throat; Than talking about book or cla[s][s]ic, And reading till it makes the eyes ach; For that my bu[s]ine[s]s is; this, yours; Which [s]ophi[s]try, a hanger cures. So [s]ay no more about the matter. Meantime with ignorance and ill-nature, There was a certain clergyman, That took upon him to explain, The meaning of the badge and u[s]e, By reading hi[s]tory of the Jews; Conceiv'd was an idolater, That from the ea[s]tern climes came there With native [s]parrow at his brea[s]t; Or what el[s]e bird it was expre[s]s'd; Egyptian ibis or a [s]tork, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-352.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxv. ] That did among the [s]edges lurk, In face of dictate that was given, By decalogue that came from heaven, Inhibiting the wor[s]hiping, Of graven bird or bea[s]t or thing; Or otherwi[s]e a great magician, He was, and dangerous on the occa[s]ion; For had a trinket of his own, And abracadrabra writ thereon, With [s]ome infernal [s]pell or force, Above a common Chri[s]tian's powers. The Cincinnat enrag'd to hear Attack upon his character, Addre[s][s]ed him[s]elf to the populace, Were then a[s][s]embled at the place. Quoth he, though no great orator Experience being more in war, Yet [s]en[s]e of injury and wrong, May loo[s]en word-[s]trings of my tongue; Enable me to tell my tale In way, perhaps, acceptable; E[s]pecially as candour hears, As is evinc'd by your drop'd ears. For well aware that public lies, In[s]inuation and [s]urmi[s]e, Had got the [s]tart of me, I fear'd, I would not be with candour heard. But to begin----'tis gone abroad, That I have image of fal[s]e god, Hung at my brea[s]t; the effigy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-353.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxvi. ] Of bird, or bea[s]t, or fi[s]h or fly; Which idol grav'd in bit of gold, Like the idolaters of old, I wor[s]hip, and put up a prayer, Tho' but a wild fowl of the air. The clergyman has given ri[s]e, To this religious prejudice, As natural to every mind, To breed according to its kind; But nothing more di[s][s]imilar, Than that a [s]oldier in the war, Should wor[s]hip God at all, or bea[s]t, In effigy or [s]hape expre[s]s'd; For [s]eldom wor[s]hip the true God, Save when [s]ome danger comes the road; Unle[s]s the [s]wearing by the Lord, Or zounds or zucks, or [s]ome [s]uch word, May be accounted reverence, Expre[s]s'd to the Omnipotence; And therefore much le[s]s probable T' adore the vi[s]ual beak or bill Of this [s]mall eaglet that I wear. As to idolatry am clear; For though know nothing more about, Religions that are [s]et on foot Than a grey goo[s]e; yet catholic, Let all men wor[s]hip till they're [s]ick; Nor interfere with church or p[s]alm, But be plain [s]oldier as I am. You that compo[s]e my audience, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-354.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxvii. ] Are per[s]ons of [s]uperior [s]en[s]e, And can with others [s]et that right Mi[s]repre[s]ented by the wight, And [s]ave my hard earn'd character, And the good name I wi[s]h to bear. There was a citizen ju[s]t by, Who li[s]tened to apology. Quoth he it may not be the [s]hape Of bird or bea[s]t at which you gape, For [s]ake of reverence or of prayer; But to di[s]tingui[s]h what you are; The only [s]aviours of the cau[s]e; It being not the truth; whereas Are many others that have fought, And taken the He[s][s]ians by the throat, And may de[s]erve more [s]olid prai[s]e, Than wearing that [s]mall thing of bra[s]s, Unworthy even of you that chu[s]e, To have the en[s]ign of the goo[s]e. Is't not ridiculous that one, Who in the [s]ervice has been known, As champion of a [s]ober cau[s]e, Which with it [s]uch advantage draws As to [s]ecure our liberty, And place the thirteen [s]tripes on high In this [s]evere and ruggid clime, Should turn his thoughts to [s]uch a whim As [s]avours of a ruder age, When every light-head wore a badge; And is no trophy or a [s]poil [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-355.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxviii. ] The warrior earn'd, upon the [s]oil, But arbitrary honor made, By [s]ome one of the brazier trade; And is no [s]pecial proof of worth; There are [s]o many to hold forth.

Or are there not among[s]t the croud, Some others that have ju[s]t pretence, If not with [s]word, at lea[s]t with brains, To patrioti[s]m in the cau[s]e? If not with arms they have withjaws In councils of the [s]everal [s]tates, Or by their writings in Gazettes, Rebuff'd the Briti[s]h power and force And militated with di[s]cour[s]e; And many who have [s]poke and wrote, Have al[s]o on occa[s]ion fought. And there are victims of the cau[s]e, By operation of the laws; In favor of the general good. What think you of the multitude, Reduc'd by fluctuating paper, E[s]tates vani[s]hing like vapour, And brought to beggary and lo[s]s: For take the people in the gro[s]s, And all have [s]uffer'd more or le[s]s; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-356.jpg) \- external link  - Page xxxix. ] And [s]o may claim by [s]ervices, At lea[s]t a bit of lead or pewter, As their de[s]ervings are minuter, And in[s]titute a club or [s]o, For what they did again[s]t the foe, In their particular grades and places; So that the multitude increa[s]es, To an infinity of badges; The honorary rights and wages, Of the whole bulk of citizens. In this there was but little [s]ense, To which the Cincinnat replied, As having more rea[s]on on his [s]ide. Quoth he, it is a [s]mall affair, If at the period of the war, We in[s]tituted this our club, To recreate us after rub, And wear a badge which [s]ome arraign As vi[s]ionary toy, and vain; But is not fancy that [s]upplies, One half of things which are our choice; And all beyond the dre[s]s and food, Is but imaginary good? The cut, the colour of the garb Di[s]tingui[s]hing the Jew from Ar'b; And all kinds of appendages, Of different tribes and nations dre[s]s Have their foundation in caprice; Not from nece[s][s]ity take ri[s]e. The [s]avages that are untaught [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-357.jpg) \- external link  - Page xl. ] Do wear their honors at the [s]nout; And nature [s]anctions the pur[s]uit By giving feathers to the brute. The badge we wear is not a charm Of Phy[s]ical or moral harm; But forcibly doth operate, And in the human mind create A love of fame and dignity, By having this before the eye; As, in the Briti[s]h i[s]le, a [s]tar And Garter, is reward of war; And the St, Louis cro[s]s in France, In other places like advance: It is a [s]mall thing if from toil, Of [s]ummers [s]un and winters [s]oil, Deficient in the [s]tipend due, We wear a thing di[s]tinct from you, A trifling [s]ignet of our own, Shall [s]carcely co[s]t us half a crown, Is there a law again[s]t the u[s]age, Pro[s]cribing it as a [s]urplu[s][s]age; So that a writ of capias corpus Can have the virtue to di[s]turb us, If there is neither rule of nature, Or juri[s]prudence that can deter, Why not ju[s]t let the things go on, In the [s]ame channel 'tis begun? For though not great the excellence, Yet have there not been men of [s]en[s]e Among the Romans and the Greeks, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-358.jpg) \- external link  - Page xli. ] That wore [s]uch things about their necks? A bull or button at the brea[s]t; Or el[s]ewhere, that has well expre[s]s'd, The [s]ignal honor they had won, By keeping adver[s]aries down; Or [s]aving citizen at lea[s]t; And yet the thing not made a je[s]t, By per[s]ons that have talk'd like you? Quoth citizen, it may be true; And al[s]o in the modern days, There have been found out many ways, To tickle fancies of the fools. There [s]carcely is a king but gulls, His courtiers with appendages, (At lea[s]t when he is moneyle[s]s) Of title, or [s]ome [s]illy badge With which they dance like birds in cage, Proud of a feather that is red, Or blue, becau[s]e they take't in head, It does them honor with the prince; But here we have a little [s]en[s]e, In the[s]e United States, and hate, Such phanta[s]y of a wrong pate; And wi[s]h t' have merit of our own, And not a mark to make it known, Hung up like [s]ign at tavern door, Or barber's pole your no[s]e before, Evincing what there is within, You could not other ways divine. Be[s]ides why do you quote the Greeks, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-359.jpg) \- external link  - Page xlii. ] Or Romans that had like dogs tricks? There is a difference in the ca[s]e; For there, the people's [s]uffrages, Be[s]tow'd the honor that was worn; But here it would not [s]erve your turn, But you your[s]elves a[s][s]um'd device. Quoth Cincinnat, 'tis all damn'd lies; We took it up, 'tis true, but yet, It may be [s]aid the gift of the [s]tate, Becau[s]e the honor was our right, And by de[s]erving we came by 't. Be that as't may the thing is [s]afe, And well befitting to the brave; Quite innocent in name and nature; Nor works a harm to [s]ingle creature, Is neither error, nor a [s]in, T' offend a layman or divine. At this the clergyman [s]poke out, Who [s]till was [s]tanding in the croud. Quoth he, have [s]aid, and [s]ay it again The thing is heatheni[s]h and vain, And wearer an idolater, Of whom there is ju[s]t cau[s]e to fear, Being [s]ome fal[s]e prophet come to light As is laid down in [s]acred writ, That fell deceivers would ari[s]e, In latter times to blind our eyes, And draw us from the truth we hold; For as to that [s]ame bit of gold, What u[s]e? unle[s]s [s]imbolical, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-360.jpg) \- external link  - Page xliii. ] Of [s]omething bad and magical, With rhyme that is engrav'd thereon?

Is this the knowledge that you gather, From every old and half dead father, As Chry[s]to[s]tom or Poly-carp, Who on a different [s]tring did harp; From you, about our in[s]titutions, In[s]tead of prayers and ab[s]olutions, And teaching from the catechi[s]m, The origin of faith and [s]chi[s]m: Which is unnatural and ab[s]urd, De[s]erves to be cha[s]tis'd and cur'd?

I'[s]t not enough to [s]plit your text: (Till every hearer's heart is vex'd) In forks and branches multiple, And fir[s]tlies, and [s]o-forths at ill, With heads and horns of Daniel's ram, That in the prophet's vi[s]ion came; Or bring a [s]ermon out of what Has [s]carce the [s]emblance of a thought, By twi[s]ting, turning, proper phra[s]e; Or cloathing pri[s]tine nakedne[s]s, With commentaries of the brain, Which no man el[s]e could find therein? And have you not interminable, Career to run as fa[s]t as able, Through all the [s]y[s]tems of the faith, And variations that it hath, Drawn from theology of [s]chools, Or [s]elf-born of the preachers [s]kulls, And built upon the ab[s]tract ba[s]e; Which was originally much le[s]s: For [s]o exten[s]ive is the flood, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-362.jpg) \- external link  - Page xlv. ] Of knowledge that is bad or good, A man may [s]ou[s]e therein and to[s]s, Ju[s]t as in ocean would a goo[s]e, And find no [s]hore or bottom out Of doctrines that are [s]et on foot? Why then nece[s][s]ity to [s]tretch, Your legs upon us at a fetch, As if you had not room at home To canter on your hypodrome, But mu[s]t inveigh again[s]t what is But a mere [s]ymbol and device, And has no moral turpitude; Or meaning that is bad or good, Save ju[s]t to [s]hew the club we're of? Quoth preacher, it is well enough To put that face upon the matter, To keep the world from knowing better, Le[s]t it [s]hould do your club a damage. But is it not an molten image Which the commandment hath forbidden? Quoth Cincinnat, are [s]o prie[s]t-ridden That common [s]en[s]e has little place. It may be molten, to u[s]e phra[s]e, But what of that, if not the u[s]e Is a new god to introduce, And wor[s]hip [s]emblance of a bea[s]t, Or bird that is upon the cre[s]t?

Quoth clergyman the matter lies Ju[s]t here; the pagan deities, False gods in Egypt or el[s]ewhere Did under [s]ome [s]uch [s]hape appear; And even we read among[s]t the Jews They fell [s]ometimes to this abu[s]e; But chiefly wor[s]hip'd calves and [s]tocks; For which were given them [s]ore rebukes. But pagani[s]m wor[s]hip'd fowls, Eagles and pigeons and vile owls, Which you would imitate by this A [s]ample of idolatries, --- And whoredom people did commit, And [s]ins of the fle[s]h in holy writ; And hence were bani[s]h'd from the earth Which gave the [s]everal nations birth.

'Twas no Minerva, or a God, From dome cele[s]tial, or abode, But, his own rea[s]on, play'd the part, And put di[s]cretion in his heart. For, [s]eeing that the wild mi[s]rule, Of mob, as raging to the full, As pedlars at an Ul[s]ter fair, With their [s]hilelahs, [s]wung in air, Left him no hope of victory, He thought the be[s]t way was to fly, And without waiting for the blows, He turn'd the corner of a hou[s]e; E[s]caping from the rioters: As when a morning [s]hadow [s]tirs, And hides it[s]elf behind a wood, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-377.jpg) \- external link  - Page lx. ] Before the [s]un that would [s]uck blood, Pur[s]uing, with his ri[s]ing heat, The thing that is not adequate, To give him battle, and with[s]tand The numerous beams he has at hand: To overpower it on the plains, And maul it, and knock out its brains. Retir'd, and to a tavern got, Where [s]uch di[s]turbance there was not; Fatigu'd with what had [s]ung and [s]aid, Now on a [s]ofa laid his head; Becau[s]e he did not wi[s]h to trudge. God Morpheus who does not begrudge A dream, lent one to keep him quiet. He [s]aw a plain, and there e[s]pied, The champions of the former period, And airy cour[s]ers, on which they rode: The cavalcade of ancient knight-hood? A [s]hew would do the very [s]ight good; Such, as the mon[s]ters, had knock'd down; And dwarfs, and giants, overthrown; And fiery dragons of the air; And pale-fac'd virgins that were there; Whom they had re[s]cued from the gra[s]p, Of ravi[s]hers that did encla[s]p Their [s]nowy bodies, in their arms; And drank the lu[s]tre of their charms; Or knights them[s]elves, who had been freed, From oaken durance, where were tree'd; Or bound in rocks, where by a [s]pell, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-378.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxi. ] They had remained invi[s]ible, The Cincinnat approach'd the throng, Who beckon'd him to come along; As recognizing his advance, To be that of no common man's; But one who came to join the [s]quad, By that [s]ame baublet that he had; With en[s]ign of the eagle's beak, And motto in th' original Greek Or Latin, knew not which it was: For things had come to [s]uch a pa[s]s, When the[s]e knights flouri[s]h'd, devil a one, Had [s]uch a thing as learning known; But all depended on their [s]la[s]hing, For fame, and for diurnal ration; And cut and carv'd their [s]u[s]tenance, By force of vig'rous arm and lance. The Cincinnat addre[s]s'd as ought, With cho[s]en words and [s]elect thought. Quoth he, my [s]eniors, in the art, Of chevalry's great ma[s]ter part; You [s]ee me, of a junior breed; A germ, [s]prung from the [s]elf [s]ame [s]eed, Of predece[s][s]ors in romance, And orders that did flouri[s]h once; Profe[s][s]ion now degenerate, Reduc'd to the very lowe[s]t [s]tate; For even the Cincinnati club Which imitative is [s]et up, Is much traduce'd, and badge do wear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-379.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxii. ] Is greatly undervalu'd here; Particularly a pedagogue, And clergyman that is in vogue, And other cavilers, ju[s]t now I met with in a town came through; Do lead a[s]tray the populace, Who have no judgment in the ca[s]e.

And, if di[s]couragements ari[s]e, In this the greater honor lies, To overcome and per[s]evere. 'Tis true, no dragons of the air, Or fiery vultures do occur, T' encounter with, and make a [s]tir; Or dam[s]els ravi[s]h'd in a wood; Or giant to let out his blood: Or an inchanter with his [s]pell; But yet there is the devil in hell To pay with other villainies, That in your modern days take ri[s]e Such as fal[s]e notions of the right, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-380.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxiii. ] Which it behooves a valourous knight T' arraign with free born thought and [s]peech And tell the people which is which; And no le[s]s courage is requir'd, To [s]peak the truth with which are fir'd; Than to knock down a cow at gra[s]s, Or mon[s]ter that did come to pa[s]s. Meantime a me[s][s]age had been [s]ent By Charlemagne to call from tent, By trumpeter, the [s]everal orders, That lay upon th' enchanted borders, Our hero look'd to [s]ee where was, Old Cincinnatus in the ca[s]e. In vain, for, in ely[s]ium hous'd, His mettle had not yet be rous'd; But mixed, with the ignoble [s]hades, Did wander, idly in the glades; And as in life, had been a plowman, And wore no badge, or dre[s]s uncommon; So now he troubles not his herd, With the[s]e; but walks among the dead, The Romans, or ob[s]curer Greeks; That wore no pendle at their necks. At this the Cincinnat below, Awaking as [s]ome one came through, Saw nothing but the [s]tanding chairs, And landlord coming down the [s]tairs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-381.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxiv. ] It would [s]eem a little [s]trange, what could have induced this bard, to have made choice of the preceding [s]ubject for his poem, as not being an American; or at lea[s]t, long in America; and could not be much intere[s]ted, one would think, in the institution of the Cincinnati Society. But it is to be ob[s]erved, that poets, chu[s]e a [s]ubject, and ridicule, or prai[s]e, not becau[s]e they care any thing about the matter; but because there may be [s]ome novelty or originality in the [s]ubject; and, [s]o, what they write, not altogether beaten and common. It may be al[s]o ju[s]t to ob[s]erve, that foreigners were more alarmed at the institution of the [s]ociety than Americans, and for this rea[s]on, becau[s]e, they [s]aw at home the orders of nobility with [s]tars, garters, cro[s][s]es, &c. and felt the weight of superior rank, of which the[s]e were [s]ometimes the badges: and transferring the idea to the Cincinnati, they con[s]idered them in the [s]ame point of view. Hence, it was, that Mirabeau, in France, was led to compo[s]e a treati[s]e again[s]t the in[s]titution, [s]hewing it to be, as he conceived, unfavorable to equality, and dangerous to the liberty of the[s]e [s]tates. Burke has been the only American that has written, professedly, on the tendency of this club: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-382.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxv. ] but, as his name imports, I take it he mu[s]t have been, originally, an Iri[s]hman; and had conceived, in that country, an unfavorable idea of titled per[s]ons, Sir this, and Sir that one, &c. Probably he has been of the Hearts of Oak, or White Boys, who were of a levelling principle, and oppo[s]ed to all elevation from the common ma[s]s. For my part, I could never [s]ee that it was of any con[s]equence whether this institution exi[s]ted or not. For it mu[s]t naturally evaporate in a few years, the [s]pirit of the times being wholly changed, from what it was in the days of chivalry, and not capable of [s]upporting an excre[s]cene which has no natural root, or foundation in the opinion of the people. The public may think what it will of this little work of the unfortunate Scotchman; but it appears to me, to have the vivida vis, animi, in a very great degree; and the ver[s]ification, though carele[s]s, is [s]pirited. The brokenne[s]s and disjointings of the ver[s]es, one line running into, and interlaced with another, carries it beyond the monotous, though perhaps, more musical imitators of Butler: among[s]t whom, Trumbull, of Connecticut, ea[s]ily de[s]erves the fir[s]t place; yet though in his [s]imilies, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-383.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxvi. ] and other excellencies of his compo[s]ition, he may [s]urpa[s]s the Cincinnatus of M`Comas; neverthele[s]s I mu[s]t give the Scotch bard the prai[s]e of greater variety in the [s]tructure of his ver[s]es. I [s]hould have been glad to have [s]een him before his exit. I have no doubt, that want of food, reducing him to great weakne[s]s, together with pain of mind from his de[s]olate [s]ituation, in a new country, where there were but few in the [s]ame line with him[s]elf, with whom he could [s]hare his joys, or communicate his griefs, might ha[s]ten the di[s][s]olution of his frame, prematurely. For, from what I have collected of the mode of life and private hi[s]tory, in general, of bards, and tho[s]e who live by their wits, in old countries, I can ea[s]ily conceive the plea[s]ure which they have with each other, when, after a fortunate paragraph with one, or a copy of ver[s]es with another, they collect a few [s]hillings, and after [s]tarving several days in the garrets while they had been writing the[s]e, they now come together, in an evening, to break their fa[s]t, with a few tripes, and a little ale, to exhilirate their hearts. Peace to the manes of M`Comas. He lies buried in the Potter's-field; with a [s]ingle [s]tone at his head, which I my[s]elf, though [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-384.jpg) \- external link  - Page lxvii. ] I do not wi[s]h to boa[s]t of it, have put there, with this in[s]cription on it, and nothing more, Sanders M`Comas. I hope there will be no mi[s]take, in future times, reading it M`Comus, in[s]tead of M`Comas: becau[s]e, it might be thought, to be a composition of the name of the god of wit among the Romans, which was Comus, with the word Mac, put to it, which is a Scoth adjective, which would puzzle antiquarians, and be unintelligible: for the fact is, he was a Scotchman, and his name [s]pelled, as I have written it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-385.jpg) \- external link  - Page 001. ] Having got through this long introduction which may re[s]emble that [s]pecies of pompion they call a qua[s]haw, who[s]e neck is longer than the whole body; I [s]ay resemble it, for it will not be altogether like it, as it will not be more at mo[s]t, than a third of the work. However it has been long enough, in all con[s]cience. We hasten to the [s]equel of the adventures of the Captain, and Teague his [s]ervant. It will be recollected, that pe[s]tered with the prepo[s]terous ambition of the bog-trotter; the Captain, by the advice of a gentleman, had con[s]ented to let him try his luck of getting into [s]ome employment under government. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-386.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] However; after reflecting with him[s]elf, a long time on the [s]ubject, he could not help expre[s][s]ing to the gentleman, with whom he was [s]till in conver[s]ation, his doubt of the [s]ucce[s]s of [s]uch preten[s]ions. Said he, after all, I do not [s]ee, how it can be rea[s]onable to [s]uppo[s]e that he can come to any great height, in [s]tate affairs: He is totally illiterate and uncultivated. As to that, [s]aid the gentleman, it is no rea[s]on at all. Do we not read in hi[s]tory of per[s]ons of the lowe[s]t education who have ri[s]en to the greate[s]t heights both in the civil, and military line. Butcher's [s]ons, keepers of pigs, feeders of [s]heep, traffickers in [s]mall wares, have come to be Cardinals, Popes, and mini[s]ters of [s]tate. That impu[s]e of mind which he discovers to be [s]omething, indicates a capacity of being [s]o. We [s]eldom find in men, a [s]trong de[s]ire of obtaining any thing which depends on human power, who have not been able to obtain it. Hence it has been [s]aid, that let a man determine to be Lord Mayor of London, and he may arrive at that dignity. The Captain yielding to the rea[s]ons, began to think, in what manner, it might be proper, to give him an introduction, and bring him forward; whether to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-387.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] endeavor to cultivate an acquaintance with [s]ome members of Congre[s]s, or the heads of departments, [s]uch as the Secretary of the Trea[s]ury, of State, at War, &c. or to begin with [s]ome of the [s]ubordinate clerks, and ri[s]e gradually to the knowledge of the principals. This, [s]aid the gentleman, would be beginning at the wrong end. The[s]e people mu[s]t naturally be jealous, e[s]pecially of [s]uch as appear to have talents; not knowing but that in time they may come to supercede them. The mo[s]t advi[s]eable way is to attack the head at once: Pre[s]ent him at the levee of the Pre[s]ident, and make him known to the Chief Magi[s]trate. This is going to the fountain, and not depending on the [s]treams, that divide among themselves; and [s]ometimes [s]ink in the earth, and di[s]appear. Having been once [s]een at court, he will acquire friends; and the Pre[s]ident him[s]elf, can with more propriety take notice of him. But would it not be nece[s][s]ary, [s]aid the Captain, before we undertake to pre[s]ent him at the levee of the Pre[s]ident, that I [s]hould have him rubbed down, and cloathed a little better than he is at pre[s]ent. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-388.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] Not at all, [s]aid the gentleman. It will be be[s]t to pre[s]ent him, puris naturalibus, ju[s]t as he is, without brogues; in his over-alls, with that long coat and [s]louched hat, which you have given him to wear. The Pre[s]ident [s]eeing him as he is, will imagine what he may be, when he comes to be dre[s][s]ed off in a [s]uitable manner; and imagination always out-goes the reality. Besides; unle[s]s he had been accu[s]tomed for [s]ome time to good cloathing, he will appear aukward in it, and move with pain to him[s]elf, and to others. Take a country girl that is neat enough in her [s]hort gown and petticoat, and put her in a fine [s]ilk with [s]tays, and [s]he will appear to much le[s]s advantage. A clown in his jacket and trow[s]ers, is re[s]pectable; but in a broadcloth coat, with [s]uitable habiliments, he would move ridicule. Governed by the[s]e ob[s]ervations, the Captain propo[s]ed to take Teague to the levee the next evening. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-389.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] The gentleman who thus advi[s]ed the Captain, though a grave man, I do not think was [s]erious. He has been what we call a wag, and wi[s]hed to amu[s]e himself with the extravagance of introducing Teague as a candidate for public offices, and taking him to the Levee. For the Iri[s]hman was certainly in no very decent apparel to appear at the court, even of a republic. The jacket and trow[s]ers, or overalls, as [s]ome call them, that he had upon him, though of rough materials, being a coar[s]e tow linen, that had not had but one boiling before it was made up, were not even whole; what is more, not clean, not that he had voluntarily on [s]ome great occa[s]ion, for a public or private calamity, as was the manner of the Jews, rent his garments, and put on [s]ackcloth, and [s]trewed a[s]hes on his head; but what came to the [s]ame thing, by lying by the fire [s]ide at night, and wre[s]tling in the day with the ho[s]tler, and [s]ervants at the tavern, he was reduced to the [s]ame raggedne[s]s and a[s]h-powdered [s]tate. Neverthele[s]s, though there might not have been time to have wa[s]hed his duds; yet a patch or two might have been put upon his ve[s]tments; a con[s]iderable impression having been made upon his flank, by a [s]harp point; and his rear being uncovered, a hand's-breadth or more; unle[s]s indeed his breeches had been taken off altogether, and he had come forward, a real [s]ans culotte, without any thing on his back[s]ide at all. The Levee. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-390.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] Having waited with impatience for the evening, the Captain, with the candidate, [s]et out for the levee. Arriving at the door, the Captain, entering fir[s]t, and Teague ju[s]t behind, he addressed the Pre[s]ident: Said he, may it plea[s]e your Excellency, here is a young man, whom I take the liberty to introduce, as a candidate for [s]tate employment. He has been offered a [s]eat in Congre[s]s. But it appears to me that a place in the executive department would [s]uit him better; his name is Teague O'Regan; and has been for [s]ome time a [s]ervant of mine, a bog-trotter; but I believe I could now [s]pare him if your Excellency has occa[s]ion to make u[s]e of him. The Attorney General, and [s]everal others who were present, were a good deal confounded at the propo[s]ition. A little lean Frenchman in in the room, with a [s]word by his [s]ide, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-391.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] was a[s]toni[s]hed; and expre[s][s]ed above an hundred foutres to him[s]elf in the compa[s]s of a minute; I do not mean that he [s]poke out, but thought them to him[s]elf in a [s]hort [s]pace. A Briti[s]h con[s]ul pre[s]ent, who was a man of a philo[s]ophic turn of mind, could not but reflect on the nature of a republican government, and the extraordinary a[s][s]urance of the lowe[s]t cla[s]s to pretend to offices. The Pre[s]ident, in the mean time, contemplating the object, made a pau[s]e. But after [s]ome time recollecting him[s]elf, bowed to the Captain, and to Teague, and signified that doubtle[s]s proper notice [s]hould be taken of the merits of the gentleman, and provi[s]ion made for him. This he [s]aid, bowing at the [s]ame time in a circular manner, and turning round as if to converse with another per[s]on, to whom attention was in his turn, due. Teague in the mean time advancing with his mouth open, and both his arms [s]tretched out, was about to harrangue in his own dialect, as pla[s]e your honor, &c. But an aid of the Pre[s]ident, or [s]ome one concerned in the ceremonial of the occa[s]ion, touching the Captain and Teague, and conver[s]ing with them towards the door, gave them to understand, that they might depart for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-392.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] pre[s]ent; and that there was no manner of que[s]tion, but that his Excellency had taken a note of the matter, and when any appointment was about to take place, the gentleman would be remembered. Containing Remarks & Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-393.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] I observe, from [s]ome [s]craps, in the public papers, that the holding a levee by the Pre[s]ident of the United States, has given offence, to men of [s]evere, and extreme republican ideas: For, as at the reformation from the Roman Catholic [s]uper[s]tition, the puritans, and other thorough paced reformi[s]ts, were offended with the Church of England, for retaining [s]ome particulars of the ancient ceremonies; [s]uch as the ring in marriage; the cro[s]s in bapti[s]m; the [s]urplice; kneeling at the [s]acrament; bowing at the name of Je[s]us, &c. [s]o here; the more rigid revolutioni[s]ts from monarchy, object to any ve[s]tige of its cu[s]toms, and would lay a[s]ide totally all re[s]emblance of it. On the other hand, it is [s]ugge[s]ted by tho[s]e who would ju[s]tify, or, apologize for the holding a levee, that it is in it[s]elf, no [s]ub[s]tance or e[s][s]ential of monarchy; it is, at the mo[s]t, but a [s]hadow of it, and can do little harm; that the in[s]titution was [s]ugge[s]ted by John Adams, who having ju[s]t returned from his emba[s][s]y in England, had no doubt good rea[s]on to [s]uppo[s]e, that it would be plea[s]ing to the Engli[s]h people who were accustomed to [s]uch things; and to the king e[s]pecially, who, as far as we under[s]tand from Peter Pindar, is but a thick-headed prince: It would be plea[s]ing to him, to reflect that though he had lo[s]t direct authority and jurisdiction in the[s]e [s]tates, yet we were [s]till di[s]po[s]ed to touch, as it were, the hem of his garment, and adopt [s]ome of the trappings of royalty. In this ca[s]e he could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-394.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] with more propriety take notice of his brother George; having a levee like another prince, than if he remained but a bare republican, like a plucked fowl, without any plumage to decorate his dignity. It is al[s]o [s]aid, that it was on this principle that Citizen Adams, propo[s]ed introducing titles of nobility, [s]uch as, Duke and Dutche[s]s, Marqui[s]s and Marchione[s]s, Count and Counte[s]s, Baronet and Barone[s]s, &c. For, that complying in the[s]e [s]mall matters with the [s]tile of the Engli[s]h ranks, and the genius of their government, it would produce and pre[s]erve a greater amity between the nations; and with the court e[s]pecially, and enable us to obtain greater advantages in our treaties of commerce. Whatever may have been the principle, I do not think the proposition bad. It could not be blameable; for Saint Paul him[s]elf, in matters of religion, a thing much more delicate in its nature, did not he[s]itate to [s]have the heads of four young men, to plea[s]e the Jews; and what was wor[s]e, circumci[s]ed the poor boy Timothy. What then, if to humour a weak king, and a prejudiced people, we had received the appellations of nobility? Be[s]ides; the matter might have been [s]o managed, as not to injure the [s]tamina of our con[s]titution; that is, not to confer the titles; but let the people take them. Carlisle, for in[s]tance, the con[s]table in Philadelphia, might have called him[s]elf Lord Carli[s]le, and [s]o on. The advocates for a levee, [s]ay, that it is u[s]eful in order to avoid the interruptions of per[s]ons calling on the Pre[s]ident at his private hours, who have no other bu[s]ine[s]s than merely to be introduced and to [s]ee him; that setting a couple of hours a[s]ide, one day in the week, for the purpo[s]e of [s]atisfying the curio[s]ity of the people, is good oeconomy; and is like throwing a barrel to a whale, in order to pre[s]erve the [s]hip. For, that, if this was not indulged, little el[s]e could be done through the week, than attending to the formality of receiving vi[s]itants. To this it is an[s]wered that it mu[s]t be impertient in any one to call upon the Pre[s]ident who has no bu[s]ine[s]s with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-395.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] him, and if he has bu[s]ine[s]s, a levee is not the place to [s]ettle it; that the Roman Pretors, and Grecian Archons made out to di[s]charge their offices, without this expedient; that it is not con[s]i[s]tent with the honor of wi[s]e and mode[s]t republicans to have it [s]uppo[s]ed, that from idle, and light-headed curio[s]ity, they would be trouble[s]ome to their chief magi[s]trate; if any were [s]o, calling once, they could be di[s]mi[s][s]ed in [s]uch a manner, as to cure them of it; and the thing being once known to be improper, the idea would pervade the ma[s]s of the citizens, and the mo[s]t unin[s]tructed, would be taught not to tran[s]gre[s]s by [s]o obvious an intru[s]ion. Be[s]ides; the curio[s]ity of [s]eeing a man eminent in office, exi[s]ts chiefly with weak minds; for the more [s]olid know, that it is not the figure of a great man that has made him [s]uch; but a [s]eries of prudent and successful conduct. They are [s]en[s]ible that when they [s]ee the mo[s]t di[s]tingui[s]hed in arts, in letters, or in arms, they will [s]ee a per[s]on that looks ju[s]t like another man. Is it worth while then, [s]ay the anti-lee-vites, to con[s]ult the curio[s]ity of gaping haubucks, by obliging the chief magi[s]trate of a government, to [s]hew him[s]elf to them once a week, when he has [s]o much real bu[s]ine[s]s on his hands? For my part, lying at the back of a mountain here; the cool we[s]t wind blowing on me; I find my[s]elf little heated with the difference of opinions on this que[s]tion. All I [s]hall [s]ay, is, that the ceremony of a levee would not be agreeable to my mind; and if I [s]hould be cho[s]en Pre[s]ident at any time, with which my friends flatter me, I believe I [s]hall not continue it, unle[s]s indeed, I [s]hould be allowed to di[s]charge it by proxy. For I could not my[s]elf, [s]ubmit to [s]tand two hours, once a week, in a circle, like a bear at a [s]take, to be [s]aluted by all comers and goers, and be obliged to [s]ay, [s]ome words of cour[s]e, to get clear of them. It is po[s][s]ible, this declaration may affect my election, but [s]uch is my habit of candour, that being on the [s]ubject, I could not help making it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-396.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] And I flatter my[s]elf, the mo[s]t [s]treneous lee-vites, may be reconciled to it, when I propo[s]e in its place to have my[s]elf taken off the more abundantly in portraits, and to have innumerable medals [s]truck repre[s]enting my phy[s]iognomy and features; and to a[s][s]i[s]t this, I [s]hall not be backward, to have di[s]criptions given of my per[s]on, manners, and apparel, to [s]atisfy the curio[s]ity of strangers. This I hope will [s]uffice. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-397.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] From the reception at the levee, which the Captain thought favorable, he began to entertain more confidence in the advancement of Teague; and, under this impre[s][s]ion, thought it now advi[s]eable to begin to take [s]ome pains with his bodily appearance, and by the next interview, produce him to the be[s]t advantage. To conduct this by [s]y[s]tem, the fir[s]t thing was to heave him down, as it were, and [s]crape off his barnacles. This was done by ordering into an apartment of the kitchen, at the Indian Queen, a tub of warm water. His overalls being [s]tript off, and putting his feet and legs in this, with hickory a[s]hes, and a pint of [s]oft [s]oap, the ho[s]tler was occupied an hour or two, in the nece[s][s]ary lotion and friction, until the upper [s]kin began to come off, and the natural complexion of his fle[s]h appear. After this being [s]tript altogether, his whole body underwent the [s]ame operation, the Captain [s]tanding by, and ordering his joints to be [s]tretched, in the manner of the Turks in their baths. After this, a clean [s]hirt was put on him, and the u[s]ual attire of a common man. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-398.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] The next thing to be done towards forming the bog-trotter, to [s]ome degree of decency, was the teaching him [s]ome more ea[s]y movements of his per[s]on, [s]o as not to lift his feet [s]o high, or make [s]uch long [s]trides; as not being nece[s][s]ary, where there were now no [s]loughs or ditches to leap over, but carpets, or plain floors to [s]tep upon. This, with the in[s]tructing him, in what manner, to turn his toes out, or at lea[s]t to keep his feet parallel in walking; and turning round, to throw one heel into the hollow of the other foot; at the [s]ame time, in what manner to bear his arms and head; and to pre[s]erve, or, incline his body, in receiving or returning a [s]alutation: con[s]idering by what means this was be[s]t attainable, the Captain thought to him[s]elf it might be advi[s]eable, in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, to employ a dancing ma[s]ter. For though the le[s][s]ons of [s]uch a teacher, might not give ea[s]e of behavior, all at once, yet the[s]e might lay the foundation of it. For, no man ever came [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-399.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] from the hands of a dancing ma[s]ter with a natural ea[s]e and flexibility of joint and limb; yet being taught to move by rule at fir[s]t, in the cour[s]e of mixing with good company, the wire edge of art would wear off, and an ea[s]e of demeanor be attained. For this rea[s]on he thought proper, the next morning, to [s]end for Monsieur Douperie, and to addre[s]s him as follows: Mon[s]ieur Douperie, [s]aid he, here is a young man of [s]ome talents, as the world [s]uppo[s]es, though I never could find them in him; who, is in a fair way to be introduced into the political, and probably the gay world: and as he is but ru[s]tic and aukward in his movements, I would wi[s]h to have him poli[s]hed; not that I expect he can attain to great perfection in the highe[s]t [s]pecies of the dance, [s]uch as the minuet, or the cotilion, or even the manoeuvres of a country dance; but [s]imply in the position of his feet, and to [s]tep and move with propriety. For I do not think it nece[s][s]ary for a [s]tate[s]man, that he be a proficient in the [s]altatory art; but, simply, that he be able to bear him[s]elf upright, and to enter a room in an ea[s]y manner, and not take too long [s]trides in walking acro[s]s the floor. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-400.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] The Frenchman, eyeing Teague, thought with him[s]elf, that he was but a rough [s]ubject to work upon; neverthele[s]s, concealing his [s]entiment, as the manner of the nation is polite and compliant, he replied. Mon[s]ieur Capitaine, [s]aid he, ver great [s]en[s]ible of de honneur, que vous me faites, de attitude of dour[s]elf be [s]o ver natural, dat prove de high degree que vous acquis in de art dat I ta[s]he; and trow un grand lu[s]tre, on de talents dat I po[s][s]ede. Such was the compliment to the Captain him[s]elf; though, by the bye, he was but a plain man, and had never been taught to dance. Mon[s]ieur Douperie continuing, turned his attention now to the bog-trotter. Dis Mon[s]ieur, [s]aid he, appear de be[s]t calcule of de vorld for de dan[s]e. Sa taille, ver good, his limb promettent, ver much en faveur of his talents futures. His muscle, et [s]on apparance nerveu[s]e, confirm me of his [s]tren[s]e in de execution. His eye, be ver good, pour fixet [s]on vi[s]avis, his partner. Tout me promet un grand expectation make Mon[s]ieur mo[s]t egal my[s]elf, in de art of de dan[s]e. As to that, [s]aid the Captain, I would not have you too [s]anguine. You do not take into view the low [s]tate in which he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-401.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] is; and what pains will be nece[s][s]ary before you can bring him to that point where you begin with others. So low is my opinion of his pre[s]ent grade in point of manners, that I had thought of putting him a while under the care of a per[s]on [s]killed in breaking oxen, that he might be taught to move by rule in [s]ome rough way at fir[s]t, before I would trouble you with giving him the nicer precepts that re[s]pect the locomotive art. Tres plai[s]ant Capitaine, ver plai[s]ant, [s]aid the dancing ma[s]ter, mais, j'me promet dat Mon[s]ieur make ver good proficiance, in ver [s]hort time. The Captain now thinking proper to withdraw, left Teague to his le[s][s]ons. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-402.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] Monsieur Patrick, [s]aid Mon[s]ieur Douperie, for under[s]tanding that he was an Iri[s]hman, and thinking that all Irishmen were named Patrick, he gave him this appellation: Mon[s]ieur Patrick, [s]aid he, il faut commencer, par les principes; mu[s]t begin by de principle. La primiere principe, de fir[s]t le[s][s]ong e[s]t placer les pieds; place de foot. Voyez; dis foot, cy; comme cela, ([s]hewing him how to place his foot) and ce luy, dat foot, la; comme dis foot. (Shewing him by his own foot how to place it) Tournez les pieds; open de foot, quoi! vous ouvrez la bouche; vous open de mout, and not de foot. Vous keep vos foot in de [s]ame po[s]ition, et vous baillez: you open de mout. La [s]econ principe, is to keep de body droit; trait. Mu[s]t [s]it firm [s]ur [s]es membres, on de limb. Tenez votre body as dis ([s]hewing him in what manner to keep his body) a[s][s]ieyez vous, [s]ur vos membres, comme ce la; dis way Monsieur sieur Quoi! encore la bouche ouverte, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-403.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] you open de mout again Mon[s]ieur Patrick. Fermez la bouche, [s]hut de mout. I [s]top here to ob[s]erve, that the opening the mouth when an exertion of the mind or body is required, is a habit very common with uninformed men, and not at all peculiar to Teague: you will ob[s]erve, that men, who have not been long, or at lea[s]t much in the habit of writing, when they put pen to paper, open the mouth, and protrude the tongue, moving it, as the pen turns to the right hand or to the left; or draws the [s]troke long or [s]hort; and, you will [s]ee a cordwainer of good [s]kill in his trade, from mere habit, and not any defect of art, put out his tongue, and move it, as if it could guide his hand, when he is parcing nicely the margin of the [s]oal of a [s]hoe or boot: Having made this ob[s]ervation in ju[s]tice to the bog-trotter, I return to my narration. The Captain coming in at this point of the bu[s]ine[s]s, made enquiry of Mon[s]ieur Douperie, what [s]ucce[s]s he appeared to have with his pupil. Bien tolerable, Monsieur Capitaine, [s]aid Mon[s]ieur Douperie, ver tolerable: Mon[s]ieur es d'une tres bonne naturel; ver good di[s]po[s]ition. A la commencement il ne faut pas nous flatter, mu[s]t not flatter, wid de plus haut [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-404.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] degre, du [s]ucces; at de fir[s]t of de lessong. The Captain, not [s]o much from the words of the dancing ma[s]ter, as from his countenance, and the tone of his voice, [s]aw, that he was not [s]o [s]anguine with regard to the proficiency of the bog-trotter as he had been at fir[s]t: Neverthele[s]s, he was not di[s]couraged in [s]uffering Mon[s]ieur Douperie to go on with his le[s][s]ons; becau[s]e he expected little more, as has been [s]aid, than [s]ome improvement of [s]tep and gait. Nor did he draw any conclu[s]ion unfavorable with re[s]pect to the attainments of the bog-trotter in a political career; becau[s]e he well that auk wardne[s]s of manner is not at all incon[s]i[s]tent with the highe[s]t literary and political abilities; and that [s]ome of the greate[s]t geniu[s]e[s]s that the world has produced have never been able to attain the graces of behavior. The poet Horace, [s]ays of Virgil; magnum ingenium [s]ub inculto corpore latet: and the anecdote of Harley, earl of Oxford, is well known; who, when Queen Anne made him Lord Trea[s]urer, his dancing ma[s]ter expre[s][s]ed his a[s]tonishment, and wondered what the Queen could [s]ee in him; for he was the greate[s]t dunce he ever had at his [s]chool. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-405.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] With the[s]e reflections withdrawing he left the Frenchman to go on with his lesson. La troi[s]ieme principe; de tird le[s][s]ong, [s]aid Mon[s]ieur Douperie, is to lift de foot; you lift de foot, Mon[s]ieur Patrick, le pied droit, de right foot furs; here Teague rai[s]ed the left, O! mon dieu, [s]aid the dancing ma[s]ter, le pied droit, et non pas le guache; de right foot, and not de left. E[s]t il po[s][s]ible, you no di[s]ting de right foot from de left. Il faut lever le guache: a la bonne heure, you lift de left foot. Now, Mon[s]ieur Patrick; un pas avec le pied guache; lift de left foot. Here Teague lifted the right foot, thinking of the former le[s][s]on, and willing to plea[s]e the dancing ma[s]ter by giving him that foot which had [s]eemed to be [s]o much in reque[s]t with him. O! mon dieu, par blieu, [s]aid Mon[s]ieur Douperie, e[s]t il po[s][s]ible you no di[s]ting de right foot from de left? It is ob[s]ervable of the French character that while they pre[s]erve their temper, they are all complai[s]ance, and have the [s]ofe[s]t words imaginable; but when they break, it is all at once, and they pa[s]s to the oppo[s]ite extreme of peevi[s]hne[s]s. It is not altogether owing to an irritability of nerve but to that [s]y[s]tem of politene[s]s which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-406.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] they cultivate; becau[s]e when the chord of civility is immoderately [s]tretched by a concealment of the feelings, when it is let go, it flies the farther, and with the quicker vibration, beyond the medium of its ten[s]ion. O! mon dieu, par blieu, [s]aid the Frenchman; and here he had almo[s]t [s]aid foutre, which is one of the wor[s]t epithets that is given, when great contempt is about to be expre[s][s]ed. However, compo[s]ing his temper, and re[s]uming his in[s]tructions; he continued; now Mon[s]ieur Patrick, [s]aid he, le pied droit, lift de right foot. Here Teague, as he had not plea[s]ed his in[s]tructor by what he had done la[s]t, viz. lifting the right foot, now lifted the left, being always at cro[s]s purpo[s]es, as it were, or [s]till too far forward, or too far back in his motions, to corre[s]pond with the directions given. O! diable, diable, [s]aid the Frenchman, rai[s]ing his voice, and almo[s]t vociferating; quoi ferai je? il e[s]t impo[s][s]ible d' in[s]truire cet garcon: no po[s][s]ible make you understand fat I [s]ay, you do. Attendez vous, Mon[s]ieur Patrick; you look at me, and lift de foot dat I lift; now I lift de right foot; lift de right foot. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-407.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] Teague [s]tanding oppo[s]ite the ma[s]ter, and lifting that foot which was on the [s]ame [s]ide with that of the in[s]tructor made the [s]ame blunder as before, and lifted the left foot. Mon[s]ieur Douperie enraged beyond all bearing, ran out of the room, and left his [s]cholar for the pre[s]ent. The day after this, Mon[s]ieur Douperie, having compo[s]ed his temper and attending, the Captain made enquiry, as u[s]ual, of the progre[s]s of his pupil. The Frenchman endeavoring to put the be[s]t face on the matter, [s]aid [s]ome things of cour[s]e and complimentary; but could not help intimating that it was une grand difficulty en le commencement, in de beginning, to make Mon[s]ieur di[s]ting de difference of de right foot, and de left. As to that, [s]aid the Captain, it is a national incapacity; for which, as al[s]o for their propen[s]ity to make what they call bulls, it is difficult to account. There are not a people more brave than the aborigines of Ireland, and are far from being de[s]titute of talents, and yet there is a certain liability to blunders, both in their words and actions, that is [s]ingular. Whether it is that a mind [s]trong and vigorous, and of exten[s]ive range cannot attend to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-408.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] [s]mall things; or that a great flow and hurry of animal [s]pirits, carries them too fa[s]t for reflection; or that there is a transposition of the brain, [s]o that things pre[s]ent them[s]elves by contraries to the imagination; I cannot tell: but the fact is [s]o that in their own country, as I have been told, when they are taught to dance, which, by the bye, is a hint which I forgot to give you, they bind on the right and left foot different badges, on the one, a twisted wi[s]p of [s]traw, which they call a [s]ugan and on the other a band of ozier twi[s]ted in like manner, which they call a gad: [s]o that when the word is given to rai[s]e the one foot, and depre[s]s the other, it is ri[s]e upon [s]ugan, and sink upon gad; [s]o, that though the tiro may not all at once, and on the word given, be able to di[s]tingui[s]h the right foot from the left, he may ea[s]ily tell gad from [s]ugan, as his eye can a[s][s]i[s]t his ear in this ca[s]e; the object being [s]imple; whereas right and left are relative terms, and that which is on the right in one po[s]ition, will be on the left in the contrary. Mon[s]ieur Douperie was willing to avail him[s]elf of this hint, for under[s]tanding that the bog-trotter was a candidate for [s]tate affairs, he was greatly anxious to have the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-409.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] honor of giving him [s]ome proficiency. Accordingly, though he did not procure a [s]traw [s]ugan, and an ozier gad, yet he made u[s]e of what he thought might be equivalent, viz. a red rag, and a blue; [s]o that in[s]tead of bidding him move the right foot or the left, he could de[s]ire him to move the red rag or the blue. Having tied the[s]e upon his ancles next morning, he began his le[s][s]on. Now, Mon[s]ieur Patrick, [s]aid he, lift de foot dat hab de red ribbon: Teague obeyed with exactne[s]s and promptitude, and rai[s]ed that foot. Now, [s]aid Mon[s]ieur Douperie, de foot dat hab de blue ribbon. Teague hit the direction, and rai[s]ed the foot with the blue rag upon it. A la bonne heure, vous y voila, [s]aid the dancing ma[s]ter; ver glad Mon[s]ieur Patrick you make [s]o good proficiance; en peu de tems, je vous pre[s]entera a l' assemble. You dan[s]e ver well, [s]hort time. La quatrieme principe, [s]aid the dancing ma[s]ter, de fort le[s][s]ong e[s]t former une pas, to make de [s]tep. Voyez Mon[s]ieur Patrick, fat I do. You make [s]tep, ne pas long [s]tep, mais van little [s]tep. The Iri[s]hman attempting to obey the directions and to [s]tep, made a [s]tride about an ell in length with his arms [s]tretched out, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-410.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] gaping at the [s]ame time. Foutre, [s]aid the dancing ma[s]ter; quoi! Vous baillez; you ope de mout yet. Oh, diable! diable! foutre! une bete! But compo[s]ing him[s]elf, he proceeded. Rangez vous a quartier; [s]tep to de van [s]ide, comme ce la; [s]hewing in what manner to [s]tep out with one foot at right angles to the other. The Iri[s]hman, endeavoring to confine his feet to rule, felt him[s]elf as much embarrassed as if chained by the heels; and attempting to make the [s]tep as reque[s]ted, and making the u[s]ual exertions, with his eyes [s]taring, his arms [s]tretched, and his mouth open, lo[s]t the command of him[s]elf on the floor, and being thrown from the line of gravity, was about to fall, when to [s]ave him[s]elf, he made a catch at the dancing ma[s]ter, and drew him down with him. The dancing ma[s]ter [s]uppo[s]ing that he hand under[s]tood him, though in French, when he u[s]ed the term foutre, and called him a bea[s]t, and re[s]enting this, was about to take vengeance, and having heard of their mode of biting, gouging, &c. in America, was much alarmed, and di[s]po[s]ed to throw him[s]elf on the genero[s]ity of the Iri[s]hman, as not being able to contend with him in [s]trength: He exclaimed, O! my lord Patrick, excu[s]ez moi, pardon, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-411.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] Mon[s]ieur Patrick, je demand pardon. Pauvre diable que je [s]uis. I be van poor dible. Vous etes un honnete homme. Ver good man. Un homme brave, courageux, ab[s]olument un homme brave, gallant, tres brave, O! je [s]uis un malheureux, I be van poor dible. Je demand pardon, my lord Patrick. The[s]e were the exclamations of the Frenchman, though, at the [s]ame time, he was uppermo[s]t, but entangled by the bog-trotter, who having [s]till a hold of him, was endeavoring to ri[s]e; which the other was di[s]po[s]ed to prevent, thinking it advi[s]eable to retain the advantage he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, and to keep him down until he could appea[s]e him by his entreaties, or until help [s]hould arrive [s]o continuing his expo[s]tulation, he exclaimed, O! my lord Patrick, faites moi, grace. I give you my money. J'ai beacoup d'argent. I give you an order [s]ur mon intendant de cent Louis; one, two, tree hundred guinea. I forgive de compen[s]ation of de le[s][s]ong, Teague, in the mean time, having understood that cha[s]ti[s]ement was u[s]ually given at [s]chool, for inattention or flowne[s]s in acquiring the elements, and not understanding broken French, conceived, that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-412.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] the dancing ma[s]ter was expre[s][s]ing his resentment, and about to inflict puni[s]hment; and therefore endeavoured to excu[s]e himself by a [s]peech on his part. God love your [s]houl, [s]aid he, dont be after bateing me, becau[s]e I can't walk like a crippled coo[s]e, ju[s]t at once. By Shaint Patrick, dis is like [s]toodying law in de workhou[s]e, where de fir[s]t ting is a good bateing; God love your [s]houl, let me up, and i'l [s]tep as [s]trait as a lame [s]hape, or a dog wid dis leg broke into de bargain. By this time [s]truggling, they were both on their feet, the Frenchman, [s]till calling out, voulez vous me tuer; O! ma femme, mes enfans, [s]pare my life my lord Patrick, and the bog-trotter beginning to cur[s]e and [s]wear, and to rai[s]e the Iri[s]h howl. Being di[s]engaged, the dancing ma[s]ter made his e[s]cape, and waiting on the Captain, not wi[s]hing to be under the nece[s][s]ity of giving any more le[s][s]ons, gave him to under[s]tand that Mon[s]ieur had made ver good proficiance, en ver [s]hort time; that he was capable to pre[s]ent him[s]elf in public wid all de [s]ucce[s]s po[s][s]ible; that it was not nece[s][s]ary to give him any more le[s][s]ons. The Captain did not [s]uppo[s]e that the Iri[s]hman could have made [s]uch advances [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-413.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] as the politene[s]s of the Frenchman would lead him to believe, but he concluded he might have acquired what would be sufficient as a foundation for his obtaining [s]ome decency, though not elegance in his manner and deportment. Paying, therefore, Mon[s]ieur Douperie the [s]um he demanded, and thanking him for the pains he had taken, the Frenchman withdrew. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-414.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] Having be[s]towed [s]ome pains to cultivate the per[s]onal movements of the bog-trotter, it now remained to endeavor to improve his manners. This the Captain undertook, him[s]elf, and though he had not read Che[s]terfield, yet he had [s]ome common ideas of decency, and delicacy in habits, and behaviour. On this point, addre[s][s]ing his pupil, he began. Teague, [s]aid he, you have now got, in literal terms your rough coat off; that is, you have [s]ome better dre[s]s, than what you u[s]ed to wear; you have al[s]o had [s]ome le[s][s]ons, in what manner, to [s]tand, or move your feet, as there may be occa[s]ion; it now remains to in[s]truct you with regard to habits of delicacy, in [s]ome matters. You mu[s]t be careful to keep your hands and face clean; pair your nails, and let no black be under them. Wa[s]h the in[s]ide of your mouth, and bru[s]h your teeth; keep a handkerchief, and wipe your no[s]e with this, not with your bare hand; when [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-415.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] you cough, [s]pit out, even [s]hould there be nothing to [s]pit, le[s]t the imagination of another, may [s]uppo[s]e that there is; you mu[s]t not belch, or break wind from your mouth, or from any other part. By the bye Teague, I have my fears of you in this la[s]t particular, for you know you have not been always careful in trotting with me to ob[s]erve a delicacy in this respect; and, it would be the devil in hell, if in a company of ladies, an indi[s]cretion of this kind [s]hould e[s]cape you. In the next place you will be careful to avoid [s]cratching your head, or your backside, or putting your hand in the waistband of your breeches, or turning your back to the fire, and pulling up your coat behind, which is the way of the vulgar. Put but a [s]mall quid of tobacco in your mouth, not [s]well the cheeks as if you had robbed a weaver of a ball of yarn, and put it there. Do not [s]pit on a floor, but in the fire, or in your handkerchief if you mu[s]t [s]pit. In eating, [s]it clo[s]e to the table, do not put your no[s]e too near the plate; put but a little in your mouth at once; do not [s]peak while your mouth is full; or while you chew. If any one [s]peaks to you in this predicament, bow; as much as to [s]ay I will an[s]wer you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-416.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] presently: drink healths [s]paringly, if at all. Do not blow in your cup to cool your tea. Keep your infirmities to your[s]elf, and do not complain of co[s]tivene[s]s, or laxativeness; of pains in the bowels, &c. A gentleman [s]hould have no complaints, unle[s]s to his phy[s]ician, of any thing, but the gout, or a fever, or the like. Give no information of a bad dige[s]tion; or food, being heavy, or light to your [s]tomach; of your agreeing with this or that food, but its not agreeing with you, as the vulgar [s]ay; that is, as we [s]hall under[s]tand you, it gives you the belly-ach. Take care not to value your[s]elf, on your eating, as that will [s]hew a gro[s]s mind; or on your drinking much, as that is but a low ambition. Sing no bawdy [s]ongs; e[s]pecially among[s]t ladies; [s]uch as Brian O'Linn, and Arthur O'Bradley; or that about Tri[s]tram Shandy O. For though the[s]e were [s]uitable enough to your former station, and [s]uch as you have been accustomed to [s]ing among the girls at the taverns, yet they will not pa[s]s among[s]t more refined company. You mu[s]t get [s]ome more fa[s]hionable airs, [s]uch as the Bird, or Guardian Angels, or the like. Even at clubs, among[s]t gentlemen, I would recommend it to you to avoid lewd [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-417.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] and indecent [s]ongs; e[s]pecially if they are of the gro[s]s and di[s]gu[s]ting kind. As you are an Iri[s]hman, a ver[s]e or two of Lango Lee might be excu[s]eable, perhaps. It is true, that in the higher ranks, among both males and females, the double entendre is [s]ometimes u[s]ed; but unle[s]s it is with great delicacy, and relieved by [s]ingular wit, it is not admi[s][s]ible. There are rules of good manners which you are to ob[s]erve. Such as when you walk with any per[s]on, let them walk next the wall; if you are about to enter a room, with another, let him enter fir[s]t. or if about to [s]it down, give way to another who is al[s]o about to [s]it down. Decline the higher [s]eat. You mu[s]t not talk too much; e[s]pecially about your[s]elf; boa[s]ting, as I have heard you do sometimes, of jumping and trotting, and how you could wre[s]tler, and the like. I am afraid. Teague, that after all the pains I am taking with you, you will [s]poil the broth, by [s]ome out-breakings, of your old tricks, and habits in [s]ome way or other. However, [s]ince I have [s]uffered my[s]elf to be per[s]uaded to try the matter, let it go on, we [s]hall [s]ee the i[s][s]ue of it. The[s]e are the outlines of [s]ome of the hints upon manners, given by the Captain. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-418.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] The Beer Hou[s]e. Having thus far cultivated the bog-trotter by wa[s]hing, and currying his person, forming his movements; refining his manners, and give him [s]ome ideas of delicacy of behavior, it now remained to indoctrinate him in a knowledge of politics: and for this purpo[s]e, as he could not read the Gazettes, or other publications, it became nece[s][s]ary, to give him the opportunity of oral information, on political que[s]tions: and as attending the debates of Congre[s]s, and hearing only, in the galleries, would not put it in his power to join occa[s]ionally in the debates, and exerci[s]e him[s]elf in [s]peaking; the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-419.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] attending private clubs, or [s]pending evenings, occa[s]ionally, at beer hou[s]es, [s]eemed the more eligible means to be adopted. Accordingly an evening, after this, the Captain taking him to a beer hou[s]e, and occupying a bench, called for a mug of ale, and bade Teague attend to the conversations that were going forward. The redemption of what are called certificates was at that time the [s]ubject of debate. It is well known to the readers of the pre[s]ent day in America, but which perhaps will not be [s]o well under[s]tood when this work comes to be read an hundred years hence, that the United States, having incurred debts during the war with Great Britain, and being unable at that time to di[s]charge them, could only give, certificates of the re[s]pective [s]ums due to the [s]everal creditors; the[s]e they did give to the [s]oldiers of their army, to tho[s]e from whom they had purcha[s]ed articles, or who had rendered any [s]ervice: The prospect not being immediate of the public being in a condition of taking up the[s]e, and the nece[s][s]ity of many of the holders pressing, they had transferred their right in the certificates for a fourth, fifth, or [s]ixth of their nominal value; in [s]ome ca[s]es, at a much lower rate. The que[s]tion was, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-420.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] whether under the[s]e circum[s]tances, the original holder [s]hould be bound by the contract, and the transferree ought to take the whole [s]um from the public. It was [s]tated on one [s]ide, that it was the folly of the holder to make the contract. There was no fraud or impo[s]ition in the ca[s]e; what he did was with his eyes open. There was no undue advantage on the part of the purcha[s]er, for he took no more than the place of the holder; and the bargain was fair and equal on both [s]ides. The one had a pre[s]ent certainty which he preferred: the other an uncertainty of a greater [s]um, of which he cho[s]e to run the ri[s]k. The purcha[s]er who gave credit to the bills of the [s]tates, [s]tood in a better point of view than the holder, who di[s]tru[s]ting payment, had parted with them. On the other [s]ide it was contended, that the certificates being only the evidence of the debt, the receiving that was no payment; that real [s]ervice was rendered, and real payment [s]hould be made; that the purcha[s]er di[s]covered a di[s]tru[s]t of the credit of the government as well as the holder, in not giving the full value, and therefore [s]tood on no better ground; that from the prevailing ideas under which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-421.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] the[s]e contracts were made, the holder did conceive him[s]elf parting with the[s]e securities at an under value, and the purcha[s]er, as obtaining them at that rate, but neither had an idea that the lo[s]s on the one hand, or the advantage on the other, could be [s]o great as on the principle of the provi[s]ion made for the di[s]charge of the public debt it had come to be; that for the[s]e and other rea[s]ons mea[s]ures ought to have been adopted of a di[s]crimination between the original holders and the transferrees. Teague had li[s]tened attentively, and, contrary to the injunction of the Captain, with his mouth open. He would willingly have taken a part in the debates, but the Captain, thinking the [s]ubject too abstruse to begin with, did not [s]eem to approve of it, and [s]haking his head, repre[s][s]ed the di[s]po[s]ition of the bog-trotter. The next topic of argument, was that of the a[s][s]umption of the [s]tate debts. In order to under[s]tand this we mu[s]t [s]tate; that, in carrying on the war again[s]t Great Britain, contracts were made, and debts incurred, on the faith of the confederated [s]tates, by their repre[s]entatives in Congre[s]s, and this was called the continental debt. At the [s]ame time, contracts were made [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-422.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] and debts incurred, on the faith of individual [s]tates, by their repre[s]entatives in the [s]tate legi[s]lature, and this was called the [s]tate debt. This whole debt, continental and [s]tate, had been thrown into one ma[s]s, and the payment a[s][s]umed by the Congre[s]s. The policy of this mea[s]ure was now canvassed. On the one [s]ide, it was contended, that as the whole debt, continental or [s]tate, was payable by the United States, each [s]tate paying the quota apportioned by the re[s]olves of the former Congre[s]s, and having credit for what [s]tate debt contracted on account of the war, was over or beyond this quota, the que[s]tion was no more than this, whether the ways and means of rai[s]ing money for the discharge of its proportion of the [s]tate debt, [s]hould remain with any [s]tate, as was before in the ca[s]e of furni[s]hing its quota; or whether the United States, a[s][s]uming the debt in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, [s]hould take upon them[s]elves to di[s]charge the whole; that it came to the [s]ame thing, as the debt was payable by the whole, and the only que[s]tion, was with whom it [s]hould lie to devi[s]e ways and means, to di[s]charge it; that the [s]y[s]tem of finance became more [s]imple, when the United States, a[s][s]umed the whole, and provided for the payment [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-423.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] by ways and means of their own at once; that it would contribute to the energy and [s]ecure the establishment of the federal government, to have that government the immediate debtor of the whole amount. To this it was an[s]wered, that each [s]tate was a better judge of the ways and means, within it[s]elf, for the rai[s]ing money to discharge its debt; and while the United States, now having command of the imposts [s]hould nece[s][s]arily take upon them to collect and provide for the di[s]charge of the continental debt, properly [s]o called; yet it might be left with each [s]tate as before, to collect and pay over what was called the [s]tate debt; receiving credit from the United States, and having a right to draw from thence, any overplus of that proportion which by the re[s]olves of the former Congre[s]s they ought to pay of the whole debt. The Captain thinking this [s]ubject al[s]o above the comprehen[s]ion of the Iri[s]hman, was not willing that he [s]hould [s]peak yet. The next topic was that of the incorportion of the bank of the United States, [s]ome contending that no power was given by the con[s]titution to the general government to incorporate banks; others asserting that though not expre[s][s]ly, yet under [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-424.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] the article of paying debts, &c. and making laws nece[s][s]ary for that purpo[s]e, it was by implication given. The Captain thought this al[s]o above the reach of Teague, and obliged him to be [s]ilent. The next [s]ubject of argument was the policy of the war carrying on again[s]t the Indians. By [s]ome it was contended that an Indian was a good creature, [s]imple and inoffen[s]ive, like a young child; that you might put your finger in his mouth, and he would not bite; that by [s]peaking softly and kindly, and giving him victuals and drink, and leggins, and breech-clouts, and blankets, you might do what you plea[s]e with him; that when you gave him ammunition and fire arms, he would go out and kill turkies, and [s]hoot down [s]quirrels, and bring you in a deer, now and then; that there was no [s]uch thing as an Indian stealing a hor[s]e, or burning a hou[s]e, or taking a [s]calp, unle[s]s you had fir[s]t [s]tolen his hor[s]e, or burnt his hou[s]e, or made a catch at his [s]calp; that when you made a treaty with the[s]e people, they had [s]uch a love of ju[s]tice, [s]uch a [s]en[s]e of honor, [s]uch a perfect command of them[s]elves, and their young men, that, there was no danger of their departing from the treaty. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-425.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] On the other hand it was advanced, that, as a [s]avage differed little from a bea[s]t of prey; a wolf, or a panther of the woods; was rude; his pa[s][s]ions violent, attached to no farm; cultivating no art; his only amu[s]ement, or [s]en[s]e of honour, war; or hunting, the image of war; his [s]en[s]e of ju[s]tice, little; his [s]en[s]e of honour, none at all; no government in his [s]tate of [s]ociety; no [s]ecurity for individual or national engagements; that fear pervading the ma[s]s, by reaching the feelings, and apprehen[s]ions of each individual was the only principle by which they could be governed; that in[s]tead of treaties and giving goods, as heretofore, it became us to retaliate by a heavy war again[s]t them, and to make known, by feeling, our [s]uperior [s]trength. Such were the arguments on each [s]ide of this que[s]tion; when the Captain looking at Teague, and ob[s]erving that he was anxious to advance his opinion, a[s][s]enting with a bow, or inclination of his head, he [s]eemed to [s]ignify that he might [s]peak. But before we hear him, it will be necessary to ob[s]erve, that during the preceding arguments, the company had taken notice of him, as he [s]at be[s]ide the Captain with a mug of beer before them; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-426.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] had wondered in their own minds, who he could be; for though he was a little bru[s]hed up by this time, as may be supposed, having been at the levee, and taught to dance, and received le[s][s]ons of delicacy, and what not; neverthele[s]s, there was [s]till an uncoothne[s]s in his appearance that could not be all at once [s]haken off. "His form had yet not lo[s]t all her original roughne[s]s: nor appeared le[s]s than a paddy dre[s][s]ed; and the exce[s]s of ru[s]ticity removed." He therefore the more ea[s]ily engaged attention, when rai[s]ing his voice, he addre[s][s]ed them as follows: Pla[s]e your honours, [s]aid he; I have heard of de[s]e Indians, when I was trating with the Captain my ma[s]ter. I came acra[s]s one o' dem, who affer'd a hundred dallars for my [s]coolp; he was going to a traty here abouts. But my good ma[s]ter the Captain took my part, and didn't let him take it aff; de vile [s]avages! O! I have heard of de[s]e Indians; pla[s]e your honours; they come out of de woods, and [s]tale [s]hape, like de rabbers in Ireland, and burn hou[s]es, and take [s]coolps; trate wid de[s]e!

From the manner in which he [s]poke, of having been in danger of lo[s]ing his [s]calp, and the Captain re[s]cuing him, it was understood that he had been in a campaign [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-428.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] again[s]t the Indians, and his fervour was excu[s]ed, and thought natural. Tho[s]e particularly who were for u[s]ing force again[s]t the [s]avages, thought the Iri[s]h gentleman had [s]poken very well. Encouraged with this [s]ucce[s]s, the bog-trotter was confirmed in his opinion, that he was fit for any political appointment; and the Captain him[s]elf, began to entertain better hopes of his advances than he had yet done. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-429.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] Though I am not employed in political affairs; or, meaning to make my book a treati[s]e of finance; yet I may be indulged in a few remarks on the preceding [s]ubjects. I am far from being greatly confident that I am right; neverthele[s]s I will acknowledge that in the ca[s]e of the certificates, I always found my[s]elf inclined to have made a di[s]crimination. It [s]eems to me that even on the principles of the municipal law, it would have been justifiable. Let us apply the chancery deci[s]ions to the ca[s]e of the contract between the original holders, and the transferrees. In a court of equity, a contract will be [s]et a[s]ide on the principle of, 1[s]t. Fraud. 2d. The uncon[s]cionablene[s]s of the bargain. 3d. The being again[s]t the public intere[s]t, and good policy. 1[s]t. Fraud: And in this ca[s]e, it is not nece[s][s]ary to prove expre[s]s fraud: pre[s]umptive is [s]ufficient. "This court, meaning the court of chancery, [s]ays lord chancellor Hardwicke, will relieve again[s]t pre[s]umptive fraud, [s]o that equity goes farther than the rule of law; for there fraud mu[s]t be proved, and not pre[s]umed only." 1[s]t Atkins 352. To apply this principle in our ca[s]e. Is there not pre[s]umption of fraud, where the holder of a certificate parts with it for a little more than the tenth of what is really due upon it? But it is well known that actual and expre[s]s fraud, did in general exi[s]t in the traffic in the[s]e [s]ecurities, the purcha[s]ers, individually, or in combination with others, decrying the credit of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-430.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] government, and depreciating as much as po[s][s]ible, the value of the certificates. But the [s]ame great chancellor, lays it down, that "To take an advantage of another man's nece[s][s]ity is equally bad as taking advantage of his weakne[s]s, and in [s]uch [s]ituation, as incapable of making a right u[s]e of his rea[s]on, as in the other. Fraud has been con[s]tantly pre[s]umed, or inferred from circum[s]tances, and conditions of parties; weakne[s]s and nece[s][s]ity on the one [s]ide, and extortion and avarice, on the other; and merely from the intrin[s]ic uncon[s]cionablene[s]s of the bargain.  There are hard uncon[s]cionable bargains, which have been con[s]trued fraudulent, and there are in[s]tances, where even the common law hath relieved for this rea[s]on expressly." 1[s]t Atkins 352. 2d. But the bare uncon[s]cionablene[s]s of the bargain, all idea of fraud out of the que[s]tion, would be [s]ufficient to [s]et a[s]ide the contract in a court of equity. Sir John Strange, the ma[s]ter of the rolls in the court of chancery lays it down; that "there may be ca[s]es where this court will interpo[s]e to prevent improvident per[s]ons from ruining them[s]elves, before the expectancy falls into po[s][s]e[s][s]ion,  though no expre[s]s fraud or impo[s]ition appears." 1[s]t Atkins 346. But let it be [s]uppo[s]ed that the contract was equal, and con[s]cionable at the time of making it; the one taking a [s]mall [s]um certain, and the other receiving the uncertainty of a large [s]un.; yet has it not become unconscionable by the event? Did any purcha[s]er ever expect to be paid the whole nominal [s]um, in gold or [s]ilver? The ideas of the time mu[s]t be yet fre[s]h in every man's mind; and we well know that no man was [s]o [s]anguine as to expect this. It was [s]uppo[s]ed that [s]omething might be done towards paying the intere[s]t at a future day, or lands in the we[s]tern country, might be obtained for them. But whatever the purcha[s]er might think, no [s]eller did imagine that for one-third, or one-half of a dollar, he was transferring twenty or twenty five shillings. It was not in the contemplation of the parties [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-431.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] to lo[s]e [s]o much on the one [s]ide, or gain [s]o much on the other. It is an unexpected event that has put it in the power of the public to do more in making a provi[s]ion for the payment of the public debt, than could at that time be fore[s]een. What is more; it is an event brought about by the joint efforts of the original holder and the tranferree; I mean a new con[s]titution of government, under which the legi[s]lature of the [s]tates having the command of all re[s]ources, was able to make a better provi[s]ion for the[s]e debts. It is unrea[s]onable, and unconscionable that the transferree [s]hould take all the advantage of this event? Let any man putting a thou[s]and dollars in his pocket from the bank of the United States, look at the war-worn [s]oldier, or the widow and fatherless who has parted with them, and [s]ay if his con[s]cience is not touched with a [s]en[s]e of the unrea[s]onable gain. If it is not, it ought to be. At any rate, on the principle of unrea[s]onablene[s]s, a contract of [s]uch undue advantage, would not be [s]anctioned by the law. The 3d. Ground is that of the public intere[s]t, and good policy. Lord Hardwicke lays it down, "that political arguments, in the fulle[s]t [s]en[s]e of the word, as they concern the government of a nation mu[s]t, and have always been of great weight in the con[s]ideration of this court (the court of chancery) and though there may be no dolus malus in the contract, as to other per[s]ons; yet, if the re[s]t of mankind are concerned, as well as the parties, it may properly be [s]aid that it regards the public utility." 1[s]t Atkins 352. There can be nothing more hurtful to a people than [s]udden lo[s][s]es, and [s]udden gains to individuals. Happiness depends on a gradual acce[s][s]ion of attainment. Perhaps a [s]udden lo[s]s inflicting with melancholy, is not more hurtful, than [s]udden great gains, hurrying into a [s]ituation for which the mind is not gradually qualified. But [s]udden gains out of the way of common indu[s]try, affect the [s]en[s]ations of others, who partake not; and feel chagrin and di[s][s]atisfaction with their [s]tate in life. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-432.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] Such gains [s]ap the foundation of common indu[s]try. For what man will be equally content to labour in his vocation, and pur[s]ue the common means of a livelihood when he [s]ees his neighbour all at once, by [s]ome fortunate ca[s]t, [s]o far before him in his acqui[s]itions. It is on this principle that our legi[s]latures have prohibited gaming, lotteries, &c. In the natural world there is a gradation in all things. Animals grow to their [s]ize in a cour[s]e of years; trees and plants, have their progress; Jonah's ground might [s]pring up in a night by a miracle; but in general all the productions of nature have a regular period of increa[s]e. The attainments of men are made to depend u[s]ually upon their indu[s]try. As ye [s]ow, [s]o [s]hall ye reap. In well regulated [s]ocieties this oeconomy is imitated, and where one e[s]tate comes by accident, five hundred are acquired by common means. Such an in[s]titution of things con[s]titutes the health of any people. On all or any of the[s]e grounds, therefore, fraud, unconscionableness, or [s]ound policy, a contract of the nature in que[s]tion, would have been [s]et a[s]ide on a bill in the chancery of England, and in our courts, the contract would not be e[s]tabli[s]hed again[s]t the original holder of a certificate: or on payment to the transferree, an action would lie to the original holder, counting for money had and received to his u[s]e, and demanding all above the [s]um originally paid, and with legal intere[s]t from the date. But it will occur, that there were in mo[s]t ca[s]es a number of transferrees between the original holder, and the then po[s][s]e[s][s]or. The impracticability of making the[s]e an[s]werable to the original holder, for their respective proportions of the undue gain, will put them out of the que[s]tion. The ca[s]e would then have [s]tood between the original holder and the la[s]t transferree. Shall he be an[s]werable to the original holder for all the intermediate gains? No. But let him take no more than the then [s]elling price of the certificates. It became the legi[s]lature in the fir[s]t in[s]tance to have a[s]certained the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-433.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] current value of the public [s]ecurities, and to have made provi[s]ion for the redemption of them in the hands of the transferrees, at that value and no more; but in the hands of the original holders, at the full [s]pecie value; and let the [s]um [s]aved from transferrees go to the original holders who had transferred. Was it practicable that the[s]e could be a[s]certained? Let the proof lie on the original holders; and where it could not be made, let the public be the gainers. As to the a[s][s]umption of the [s]tate debts, perhaps, it would be advi[s]eable for me to be as [s]ilent as the bog-trotter; as it is po[s][s]ible, I may not have a perfect knowledge of the que[s]tion. But from the knowledge I have on the [s]ubject, it has appeared to me I will not [s]ay an unju[s]t, but an impolitic mea[s]ure. If more were led to look to the general government, and to depend upon it, as being the general debtor; yet with this it took the odium of impo[s]ing duties to di[s]charge the whole. It would have been as well perhaps, to have left the [s]tates them[s]elves, to enact exci[s]e laws, or to devi[s]e whatever other ways and means, they thought proper while the impo[s]ts, which the United States had now got in their collective capacity, would have been [s]ufficient to have an[s]wered the continental debt where they were the immediate contractors. There is that advantage in a public debt, that the fortunes of many are made to depend on the exi[s]tence of the government; but as there, in the nature of things, can be but few, in proportion to the whole, there will be in that proportion, a greater number to be affected with the payment, and to be carele[s]s of the exi[s]tence of the government, or to wi[s]h a di[s][s]olution of it. When that debt, as in the pre[s]ent in[s]tance, by the nece[s][s]iries of the di[s]tre[s][s]ed, the di[s]tru[s]t of the credulous, and opportunities of the knowing, has come to be in few hands; after having pa[s][s]ed from the mo[s]t de[s]erving, at a [s]mall value it exi[s]ts with an odium upon it in the public mind, which naturally transfers it[s]elf to all ways and means that can be devi[s]ed for the di[s]charge of it. At the [s]ame time [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-434.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] that it is well to brace the government, and [s]ecure its [s]trength, it is an object of equal moment to pre[s]erve it popular: affection, as well as power, are the bands of authority. As to the bank incorporation, I [s]hall only [s]ay, that the doctrine of in[s]ering powers by implication, is extremely dangerous, and may ea[s]ily be carried to overthrow all the boundaries of any con[s]titution. I think it much the mo[s]t advi[s]eable, when the ca[s]e is doubtful, to wait until the [s]ame authority by which the constitution is e[s]tabli[s]hed, [s]hall have declared its [s]en[s]e on the [s]ubject. For otherwi[s]e, except as to the form of a government, independent of its powers, a con[s]titution will be of no u[s]e. A tran[s]gre[s][s]ion of the con[s]titution is the breach at which tyranny enters; and of all things it is the mo[s]t difficult thing to pre[s]erve a con[s]titution inviolate. The Council of Cen[s]ors in Penn[s]ylvania, was a means, and I think a good one. They did them[s]elves honour in the report they made with re[s]pect to the violation of the con[s]titution, though the [s]pirit of party prevented them from going far enough. Under the United States there is but one means, and that is the deci[s]ion of the judiciary. The judges have done them[s]elves honour in a late ca[s]e where they had the independence to declare a law void which they con[s]idered as uncon[s]titutional. In the ca[s]e of the bank, would not a writ of quo warranto lie. I can have no doubt of it; and, I may be mi[s]taken, but I can have no doubt but that the judges would find them[s]elves bound to declare the act in que[s]tion not within the powers granted to the United States, and therefore void. As to Indian treaties, having occa[s]ionally in this work, in[s]inuated my ideas, it may [s]eem a repetition to [s]ay any thing more on the [s]ubject. Indeed the objection may lie in general again[s]t the work, that certain [s]ubjects, [s]uch as the Philo[s]ophical Society, Popular Preaching, Indian Treaties, &c. have been too often introduced. To this, I have to an[s]wer, that it has [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-435.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] been the [s]y[s]tem I propo[s]ed, not to exhau[s]t a [s]ubject all at once, but to touch it for the pre[s]ent, and introduce it afterwards in a different point of view, where [s]uch things might be added, as would otherwi[s]e originally have been brought in; ju[s]t as, in order to pre[s]erve a reli[s]h for the [s]ame food, we do not dine upon it in continuance, but having had veal to day, take pork to-morrow, and the third day return to veal again. Having certain ideas to inculcate, I bring them forward at various times, and in different [s]hapes, with front, flank, rear, corps de re[s]erve, &c. As the human mind, from defect of attention, or incapacity, cannot be reached all at once, in the manner of the prophet, imitating his zeal, and knowledge of the heart, I give "line upon line; precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little." This will be my apology, for touching the [s]ubject of Indian treaties again in this volume. On this [s]ubject I lay down the[s]e principles; that an Indian is a man, and you may bind him by kind words and good acts. But he is an ignorant, uninlightened man, and when you lo[s]e the affections of his heart, you have little hold upon his rea[s]on to recover it: Re[s]pect for you, in the fir[s]t ca[s]e, is the ground of his attachment; fear of you in the la[s]t, mu[s]t be your means to reclaim him. Hence it depends upon circumstances when a treaty is expedient, and when a war is necessary. Apply this to our pre[s]ent [s]ituation with the Indians. At the conclu[s]ion of the war with the Briti[s]h, we were thought to be conquerors: though the [s]avages were kept in the dark with re[s]pect to the [s]tipulated [s]urrender of the po[s]ts on the lakes, and the ce[s][s]ion of the Indian country by their allies, yet it had tran[s]pired among them that we had been [s]ucce[s]sful again[s]t the great king; hence a fear of us was impre[s][s]ed, and it was expedient to treat. We did treat, and after [s]ome interval, as will always be the ca[s]e, war, again took place. They have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-436.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] have had the advantage. This is not, therefore, the cri[s]is to treat. Among[s]t our[s]elves, do we not find, that if you yield to the impo[s]ition of an ignorant man, he will attribute it to your want of di[s]cernment to ob[s]erve it; whereas, on your part, it was to avoid all contention with a low per[s]on. If you are in[s]ulted by an ignorant man, he will attribute it to your cowardice, that you do not challenge him, whereas, it is an unwillingne[s]s to have your name mentioned with his, as having had a di[s]pute at all. If you attempt to negociate a contract with an ignorant man, and a[s]k him ju[s]t what you ought to a[s]k, he propo[s]es le[s]s than he otherwi[s]e would have done; and not until you convince him, that you are at a world, in the[s]e matters, will you induce him to agree to what is rea[s]onable. A [s]mall [s]ucce[s]s with an ignorant man, again[s]t an adversary, will give him hopes, which the occa[s]ion does not ju[s]tify; becau[s]e he does not comprehend the principles, and [s]ee how much accident, or cau[s]es that may not exi[s]t again, had to do in the bu[s]ine[s]s. It is therefore like [s]elling a fowl in a rainy day, to attempt negociating with an ignorant man, when his imagination is not corrected by an experience of facts again[s]t him. It is on the principles of human nature, that I found my ideas of managing the Indians. I would deprecate a treaty at pre[s]ent, becau[s]e it could not be permanent. We are in a fair way, to bring things to a [s]tate in which it might be advi[s]eable to treat. Let the event be what it may, I am one of tho[s]e who not only approve of the pre[s]ent war again[s]t the Indians, but al[s]o of the princ i ple on which it is carried on, viz. by a body of regular and well disciplined troops. It is [s]ugge[s]ted by [s]ome, that the militia would be adequate. What? Becau[s]e in the cour[s]e of the war again[s]t the Briti[s]h, when we had not disciplined troops at all times, and in [s]ufficient numbers to oppose to the enemy, the militia of nece[s][s]ity were obliged to act, and [s]ometimes acted well, will it be [s]aid that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-437.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] they were preferable to the di[s]ciplined troops? we know they were not, though occa[s]ionally they di[s]covered bravery, and were obedient to orders. But [s]uppo[s]ing them equal; what is more, [s]uppo[s]ing them preferable; are the inhabitants of the we[s]tern country, to be perpetually harra[s][s]ed with militia duty? To be [s]ubject to the nece[s][s]ity of quiting their occupations, and to be occasionally [s]oldiers? Did not the militia during the war with Britain, groan under the nece[s][s]ity of being obliged to act? And [s]hall this grievance exi[s]t to the we[s]tern country, ten years after that war has been terminated; and when it is in the power of the government, knowing the [s]eat of war with the [s]avages, to have regular troops to oppo[s]e them; not as in the ca[s]e of the Briti[s]h, where by means of their flects, the war was [s]uddenly transferable from place to place, and the militia were obliged to act, in order to a[s][s]i[s]t the parts of our army, until a greater force [s]hould arrive. Militia! That is, let every man do his own fighting. Why not every man his [s]mithing, ma[s]oning, weaving, and tayloring, as well? Becau[s]e it will be better to have per[s]ons who will make a bu[s]ine[s]s of each particular branch, and [s]tick to it. It does not do to be a Jack of all trades. Well, and why plow a [s]pell, and then fight? But the riflemen of the we[s]tern country, are the be[s]t calculated to fight the Indians. Well: enli[s]t [s]uch, and give them rifles, and make an abiding body of them, that the country may have a permanent force to depend upon. But they will not enli[s]t. I engage it, if you pay them well. When militia are called upon they are not tho[s]e that are drafted that go; they are [s]ub[s]titutes. They co[s]t high to tho[s]e that employ them; and being the refu[s]e of the country, they are good for nothing when they are employed. But let tho[s]e that are drafted go. Well; draft them from the inland parts of the government, that have not families to defend on the frontiers, and [s]ee what will then be [s]aid. Volunteers are the thing, making a [s]udden incursion. If they make a [s]udden incur[s]ion, they will make [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-438.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] a [s]udden recur[s]ion, and leave the matter as they found it. A large army cannot find the Indians. They will run away. Well, [s]tay till they come back. Occupy the country; and occupying it, then prepare to treat. Treating at their own towns you will not be impo[s]ed upon by raggamuffins pa[s][s]ing for chiefs; or tribes treating who are at peace already, and are [s]o [s]ituated that they dare not go to war. But the we[s]tern country is not worth defending at the expence of a [s]tanding army. Give it up then; ab[s]olve us from our allegiance, and let us make terms with the Briti[s]h who have the command of the Indians. For an army at lea[s]t equal to the pre[s]ent e[s]tabli[s]hment mu[s]t be kept up; otherwi[s]e all the treaties that can be made, will be of no avail; for a pre[s]ent vi[s]ible force is the only [s]anction of engagements, with the [s]avages; more e[s]pecially in their pre[s]ent [s]ituation, impelled, and [s]upported by the traders of Britain. I will not [s]ay how far the government takes a part, as there are different opinions on this subject. But it is not the we[s]tern country only that you are defending. It is the very [s]ea coa[s]t [s]ettlements. For if we give way, and return to the ea[s]t of the mountains, will not the enemy come to the ea[s]t after us? If he finds no hor[s]es or blankets, on the one [s]ide, will he not pur[s]ue his rout to the other? If he mi[s][s]es a [s]calp [s]hort of the Schuylkill, will it not do to take it there? The fact is, that the command of lake Erie, by po[s]ts e[s]tabli[s]hed upon it, and from thence to the Waba[s]h, are the only means of repre[s][s]ing the Indians; not [s]o much from the actual force of the[s]e e[s]tabli[s]hments as from the effect upon the imagination of the enemy; for [s]eeing the boldne[s]s of the [s]tep, they will count more upon our force than they ought; as at pre[s]ent they count le[s]s; and it will refute the Briti[s]h traders, who deny the ce[s][s]ion of the country made by that government. But more e[s]pecially, by encouraging our traders under the protection of our po[s]ts, a commerce will be e[s]tabli[s]hed with the [s]avages, under the no[s]e of the Briti[s]h, and we may equally have the direction of them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-439.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] Surely any man of the [s]malle[s]t reflection mu[s]t know, that a treaty and giving goods, is but a tran[s]itory act, and can have but a tran[s]itory effect; whereas the means that will reduce, and the intere[s]ts that will conciliate, ought to be permanent to be of any u[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-440.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] The circum[s]tance of having been at the levee, and having made a [s]peech in the beer-hou[s]e, which had been much approved, and above all, it being announced that he was a candidate for [s]tate employment, had made the bog-trotter a pretty general theme of conver[s]ation. Sundry per[s]ons who were expectants upon government, had procured them[s]elves to be introduced to him, as [s]uppo[s]ing that when in office, by and bye, he might have it in his power to do them [s]ervice. Even by tho[s]e that were in government, in the legi[s]lative, executive, or diplomatic line, he was not neglected. Several members of Congre[s]s had left cards. A[s][s]i[s]tants, and deputy a[s][s]i[s]tants in offices, foreign con[s]uls, two or three directors and ca[s]hiers of banks, had waited upon him and paid him their compliments. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-441.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] His name became known in the gay world, and by a gradual introduction, he had become acquainted in [s]ome of the be[s]t families of the city. The ladies, in general, were much taken with him. They thought him a plain, frank, blunt [s]poken Iri[s]h gentleman; not harra[s][s]ing them with deep ob[s]ervations, drawn from books, or an o[s]tentation of learning; but always [s]aying [s]omething gallant, and complimentary of their per[s]ons, or accompli[s]hments; [s]uch as God love your [s]houl, my dear cratur, but you are de beauty of de world. Sleeping or waking, I could take you to my heart, and ate you wid de very love o' d' my [s]houl dat I have for you. De look o' d' dur face, like de [s]un or de moon, run trugh me, and burn up like a coal o' d' de fire; dat I am [s]hick and fainting to take du to my arms, my dear cratur. Declarations of this nature, made without any ambiguity, and warm and violent in their nature, had rendered him, as I have [s]aid, pretty generally a favorite of the ladies: far indeed beyond any thing which the Captain, [s]imple and ignorant of the world, had ever imagined: his a[s]toni[s]hment therefore was not [s]mall, a day or two after this, when walking the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-442.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] [s]treet, he [s]aw a carriage, pa[s]s by, with a gentleman and lady; and on a[s]king who[s]e carriage that was, and who the gentleman that was in it; for he was [s]truck with [s]ome re[s]emblance of the bog-trotter; it was an[s]wered, that it was the carriage of Mr. Haberda[s]her, a merchant of the city, who[s]e lady was taking an airing it would [s]eem with Major O'Regan, a member of Congre[s]s, or Amba[s][s]ador, or [s]omething that was ju[s]t come to town. God Almighty! thought the Captain; is it po[s][s]ible. I [s]ee that I have been a fool, all my life, and though ju[s]t going out of the world, am but beginning to get experience to live in it. I had been led by his own confidence, and by the opinion of others, though with great doubts, on my part, to [s]uppo[s]e it po[s][s]ible that he might have come to be of [s]ome re[s]pect in government, the di[s]charge of an office, requiring rather [s]olid, than brilliant parts; but that in [s]o [s]hort a time, or indeed, after any period, he [s]hould become a favorite of females of ta[s]te and fa[s]hion, never entered into my head at all: and for[s]ooth they have given him the appellation of Major, though he is about as much a Major as my hor[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-443.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] Such were the ideas which the circumstance of Teague in a carriage with a fine lady, naturally produced in his mind. Nor indeed [s]hould we think them unreasonable, were it not that we know there was nothing extraordinary in the ca[s]e. For though ab[s]tractedly con[s]idered, it would [s]eem improbable that the female mind of great delicacy, and refinement, [s]hould be captivated by a rough and gro[s]s object; yet we know that the fact is in nature, and we mu[s]t leave it to the philosophers to account for it. Nor will this be any difficult ta[s]k, when we con[s]ider the powers of imagination. Here was a new object, unknown as to its origin, and high as to its preten[s]ions; and what is novel, and not fully comprehended, and lofty in its nature, has a [s]upereminent dominion over the human mind. Hence the proverb, "far fetched, and dear bought, is good for ladies." But on the pre[s]ent occa[s]ion, a particular principle operated in favour of the bog-trotter: viz. the ta[s]te and fa[s]hion of the day. For, as, in the age of chivalry, a knight was the only object in reque[s]t, and at the beginning of the revolution in America, a Baron, or a Count from France or Germany was the ton, [s]o now, [s]ince the adoption of the federal [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-444.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] con[s]titution, the appurtenant officers of government are the only characters in vogue. And as in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, mere [s]quires had been taken for knights, and pa[s][s]ed very well, and in the [s]econd ca[s]e, taylors and barbers, had [s]lurred them[s]elves for gentry or nobility, what could hinder the bog-trotter from availing him[s]elf of the whim of the day, and be taken for a per[s]on qualified to fill any place in government, from the bare pretending to it? And being once taken for [s]uch, what prodigy was there in his being in reque[s]t with the females, and all the fir[s]t families of the city, who might be ambitious, and vie with each other, in having him married to a niece or a daughter, that [s]o being rai[s]ed above plebians by the connection, they might be con[s]idered as of a pratrician degree? Let the principle be what it would, whether ta[s]te, or ambition, the fact was, that the bog-trotter was courted and carre[s][s]ed by all the fir[s]t people: there could be no card party without Major O'Regan. A young lady [s]itting by a gentleman in any hou[s]e, and [s]eeing him pa[s]s by, would [s]tart up, and run to the window and [s]ay, O, there is Major O'Regan. When he was in company, and would laugh, and put out his tongue, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-445.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] as if he was about to [s]ing, Lilibullero, the young ladies would laugh too; not that there was any je[s]t, in what he or they [s]aid, but ju[s]t becau[s]e the Major had laughed. When he would put out his great paw to touch the hand of any of them, O, la! Major, one would [s]ay, O, now! Major, another would [s]ay; don't now Major, a third would exclaim, rather to attract his attention, than to repre[s]s his advances. The fact was, there [s]eemed to be a kind of Teagueomania, among[s]t the females, [s]o that all idea of excellence, per[s]onal, or mental was centered in him, and all common lovers, were neglected, or repul[s]ed on his account. A melancholy in[s]tance of this kind occured to the Captain the following day, when walking by the margin of the river on which the city [s]tood, and towards a grove of wood, which [s]kirted it on the [s]outh, he ob[s]erved a man [s]itting on a tuft of the bank, with his head reclining forward, in a melancholy po[s]ition, and looking down upon the wave beneath him, in the manner in which Achilles is de[s]cribed by the poet Homer, as looking on the purple ocean, and complaining to the godde[s]s Thetis of the injury done to him, when the maid Bri[s]feis had been taken from his arms by the order of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-446.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] Agamemnon. Sen[s]ibly touched with an appearance of woe in any ca[s]e, the Captain could not avoid advancing, and accosting him: Sir, [s]aid he,----but what need I take up the time of the reader with [s]tating particularly the words of the address: it is [s]ufficient to [s]ay, that with all the nece[s][s]ary delicacy, the captain gave him to under[s]tand that he took a part in his misfortune, if there was any upon his mind, and would think him[s]elf extremely fortunate if by language, or acts, he could alleviate his griefs. Sir, [s]aid the other, it is impo[s][s]ible. I am an unhappy man, who have been for [s]ome months in love with a young lady of this city, and who[s]e affections I had conceived my[s]elf to have engaged by the mo[s]t unremitting attention. I had counted upon her, as my wife, and in all my industry in bu[s]ine[s]s, which is that of a merchant, I had my thoughts directed to the provi[s]ion, I hoped, to have it in my power, to make, in order to [s]upport her with dignity and affluence. Yet within the[s]e few days, her attention is engaged, and her affections alienated by a certain Major O'Regan, that is, or, is about to be engaged in [s]ome public employment. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-447.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] Major O'Regan, [s]aid the Captain, laughing; is it po[s][s]ible! Do you know him, [s]aid the gentleman? Know him, [s]aid the Captain; he is my bog-trotter; he has been my valet de chambre this three years; and of late my ho[s]tler and boot cleaner, in my travels to this city. I believe I could prevail with him for a pair of breeches, or [s]o, to re[s]ign his preten[s]ions to the lady. At this, the eye of the inamorato began to re[s]ume its lu[s]tre; and the palene[s]s of his countenance to give way to [s]ome freshness of complexion. Give me your name, and the name of the lady, [s]aid the Captain, and call upon me to morrow, at the Indian Queen, about nine o'clock, and I will endeavor to make [s]uch terms on your behalf with this [s]ame Major O'Regan, that he will give you no farther trouble, on the [s]core of the lady. The inamorato expre[s][s]ed his thankfulness with great animation and fervour; and accepted the invitation to wait upon him at the time and place propo[s]ed, informing him, at the [s]ame time, that his name was Williams, and that of the lady, was M`Cracken, a daughter of an alderman of the city of that name. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-448.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] The Captain coming home, addre[s][s]ed the bog-trotter as follows: Major O'Regan, [s]aid he, for that I find is the title which they have given you, there is a young lady of this town of the name of M`Cracken, whom you have by [s]ome means engaged to think favorably of you, to the neglect of a former admirer, a Mr. Williams, a merchant, of this city. This gentleman had a claim upon her from a prior attention, and though there is no municipal law that con[s]titutes it a wrong in you to interfere; yet humanity will dictate that it is a wrong. Becau[s]e it is a [s]mall thing to a man who[s]e affections are not engaged; and who has yet wa[s]ted no time upon an object, to decline attention to it, or relinqui[s]h it. But to him who has [s]et his mind upon this or that lady, it is death to be repulfed, and a man of honor and delicacy of feeling, who [s]ees the advances of another which are well received, will not interfere, even though the object might be agreeable to him. Much le[s]s will he amu[s]e him[s]elf at the expence of another, by paying attention when it is his own vanity alone that he con[s]ults, in [s]hewing in what point of view he could [s]tand if he [s]hould think proper to per[s]i[s]t. I hope better things of you Teague, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-449.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] that you will conduct your[s]elf on the principles of honour and humanity; you will re[s]ign this flirt, for [s]uch I deem her, who---- he was going to [s]ay, who could be tickled with you; but having a point to carry with Teague, he cho[s]e to u[s]e [s]oft words; who, continued he, could [s]o readily change one lover for another. What [s]ecurity have you of the affections of one of [s]o ver[s]atile a mind, Mr. Williams is a merchant, and has cloths in his [s]tore: he will give you the pattern of a pair of breeches to decline your pretensions, and re[s]ign the jade to him who had fir[s]t ca[s]t his eye upon her. Teague, much more from this la[s]t part of the argument, than from the fine sentiments of delicacy, &c. which were laid down in the fir[s]t of it, con[s]ented to relinquish the dulcinea; and [s]o when Mr. Williams called at the hour propo[s]ed, an order for the making of a pair of breeches was given and the bog-trotter pledged his word, that he neither would laugh, talk, walk, or ogle with her any more. Shortly after this, while reading a newspaper, the Captain heard two men conversing at the oppo[s]ite end of the [s]aloon in which they [s]at, one of them expre[s][s]ing his concern that having a cau[s]e to be tried [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-450.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] before the court then [s]itting, his lawyer Mr. Hardicknute could not attend, being indi[s]po[s]ed, and as it was alledged, from a di[s]appointment in love, by a Mi[s]s Thimbleton, who was of late, as it appeared, taken with a certain Major O'Regan, an Iri[s]h gentleman of [s]ome note, who had paid attention to her. Enquiring the re[s]idence of the gentleman, and being informed, the Captain ever prompt to do offices of humanity, immediately calling for Teague, who was in the bar room with the waiter getting him to write a love letter for him, [s]et out on a vi[s]it to lawyer Hardicknute, and being admitted to his chamber, where he lay langui[s]hing in bed, acco[s]ted him, giving him to under[s]tand that he knew the cau[s]e of his complaint, not by feeling his pul[s]e as did the phy[s]ician of Demetrius, who was in love with Stratonice: nor by any power of conjuring; but [s]imply by hearing it from a client who was intere[s]ted in his recovery; and that in con[s]equence of this information he had come to relieve him, and had brought the identical Major O'Regan along with him, who for half a johannes was ready to re[s]ign all pretensions to the lady. This the Captain presumed, from his influence with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-451.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] Irishman, and from his [s]ucceeding on the former occa[s]ion. The [s]ick lawyer at this [s]at up; and having put on on his gown and [s]lippers, expressed great thanks to the Captain and the Major, and very readily handed a half johannes from his bureau, and calling for pen, ink and paper, for he was not sufficiently re[s]tored to go to his office, he signified that it would be proper the Major [s]hould give him [s]ome in[s]trument of writing as evidence of the contract. It was agreed on the part of the Captain and the bog-trotter; and the lawyer wrote as follows: "Know all men by the[s]e pre[s]ents, that I Teague O'Regan, Major, am held and firmly bound unto John Hardicknute, in the [s]um of one hundred pounds, money of the United States, well and truly to be paid to him the [s]aid John, his heirs, executors, admini[s]tators, or a[s][s]igns. Given under my hand and [s]eal this [s]econd day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand [s]even hundred and ninety-one. The condition of the above obligation is [s]uch, That if I the [s]aid Teague O'Regan, [s]hall withdraw all attention, court[s]hip, or wooing on my behalf from a certain Martha Thimbleton, lady, then the [s]aid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-452.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] obligation to be void, otherwi[s]e to remain in full force and virtue. his TEAGUE  O'REGAN mark. Signed, [s]ealed and delivered in the pre[s]ence of JOHN FARRAGO. This matter being fully [s]ettled, the Captain and the bog-trotter took their leave and departed. On their way home, a man was [s]een to run acro[s]s the [s]treet, dre[s][s]ed in black, but without hat, coat, or breeches on. The Captain conceived it mu[s]t be [s]ome mad [s]ans culotte, or unbreeched per[s]on that had come over from Paris, and was running through the [s]treets here in order to bring about a revolution; but on enquiry, he was informed, that it was the Revd. Mr. M`Whorter, a young clergyman, who had been deranged in his under[s]tanding on account of a preference given by Mi[s]s Fiddle to a certain Major O'Regan, who had [s]eemed to have engaged her affections; that it was fir[s]t discovered on the preceding Sunday, when in his prayer, in[s]tead of [s]aying "give us this day our daily bread," he repeated, give us this day our daily Mi[s]s Fiddle, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-453.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] in[s]tead of [s]aying, "deliver us from evil," as he ought to have done, he [s]aid, deliver us from Major O'Regan; that ever [s]ince he had been getting wor[s]e, and now had thrown off a part of his garments, and expo[s]ing him[s]elf in public, appeared to be mad altogether. The Captain thinking on the [s]ubject, was about to parody that line of the poet and to [s]ay; Ye Gods what havock does O'Regan make Among[s]t your works. But repre[s][s]ing all poetical flights, he wi[s]hed to lo[s]e no time, but as [s]peedily as po[s][s]ible to wait upon the unfortunate ecclesiastic, and by [s]atisfying his mind, remove his derangement. Accordingly pur[s]uing the clergyman, and having had him [s]eized and conveyed to a chamber; he endeavored to make him [s]en[s]ible that Major O'Regan, the cau[s]e of his misfortune, who was there pre[s]ent, was ready to quit claim to Mi[s]s Fiddle, and give him no cau[s]e of unea[s]ine[s]s any farther. For this, on their way, the bog-trotter, in consideration of an intere[s]t in the clergyman's prayers, had promi[s]ed to do. But poor Mr. M`Whorter was too far gone. He could talk of nothing, but [s]ome incoherent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-454.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] jargon con[s]i[s]ting of a mixture of [s]cripture and profane language, one while about Mi[s]s Fiddle and Major O'Regan; another while of Daniel in the Lion's den, and Jonas in the whale's belly, and the Devil running into [s]wine. He would imagine [s]ometimes that the devil was in him[s]elf, and would [s]queel like a pig. The matter being thus hopele[s]s, they [s]et off to come home. On their way they fell in with a man who called him[s]elf a doctor, and had a bli[s]tering plai[s]ter in his hand, and a gallipot, and a cly[s]ter pipe tyed with a [s]tring about his neck, and hanging down his back, and had alarmed two or three ladies ju[s]t before, offering his [s]ervices in the way of his profe[s][s]ion. On enquiry, it was found, that it was the celebrated doctor Catapla[s]m that had lo[s]t his [s]en[s]es, within three days pa[s]t, on account of a Major O'Regan, that was likely to carry off Mi[s]s Bla[s]m, to whom the doctor had been a [s]uitor for [s]everal years, and with whom he had been ju[s]t on the point of marriage. De[s]pairing from the late experiment of doing any thing with mad people, the Captain waved any trouble with the doctor, but looking sternly at Teague; this will never do, [s]aid he: I cannot reconcile it to my[s]elf to be in the mo[s]t di[s]tant way acce[s][s]ary to [s]o much [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-455.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] mi[s]chief; and as, from a deference to the judgment of others, and to your importunity, I have [s]uffered my[s]elf to be the means of introducing you to this [s]phere, I mu[s]t take care to repair the injury as far as may be in my power, or at lea[s]t prevent any increa[s]e of it as much as possible. If there is [s]ome tali[s]manic charm, God knows what it is, in your per[s]on or appearance, that makes you thus formidable to the peace and happine[s]s of others in giving this [s]ucce[s]s among[s]t the females, and if you have not genero[s]ity, or moral [s]en[s]e of duty, to u[s]e your advantage consistent with humanity, it is full time you [s]hould be checked and drawn from this [s]phere altogether, and [s]ent to your former bog-trotting, or put into the [s]tate if you can get there, that hone[s]t men may marry their wenches, who[s]e affections they had previou[s]ly engaged. The bog-trotter was [s]omewhat obstreperous; or as the vulgar [s]ay, obstrapalous, on the occa[s]ion; and [s]eemed to [s]ignify that he would not de[s]i[s]t; but would pay attention to whom he thought proper. The Captain [s]aw that it was a difficult matter to lay the devil he had rai[s]ed; and his hopes re[s]ted in this, that he was but the bubble of a day, and that though [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-456.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] light-headed young women in the unfortunate ca[s]es mentioned, had given him a visible preference, yet it was rather to torture their former lovers with a view to try the [s]trength of their pa[s][s]ion than with any intention [s]eriou[s]ly to make choice of him, and finally accept him for a hu[s]band. For he could not think it po[s][s]ible that a woman of fa[s]hion, and education, would ultimately be willing to give her hand to [s]uch a raggamu[s][s]in. If indeed, he could come to be a judge, or a governor, [s]uch a thing might take place; but as it was, it [s]eemed to outrage all credibility. In this he was mi[s]taken; for but the very next day, he was waited on by Mr. Mutchkin, a merchant of the city, who was in the whole[s]ale and retail way as a grocer, and who had an only daughter, Mi[s]s Mutchkin, to whom the Iri[s]hman had made his mo[s]t [s]erious propo[s]als. It was to her, by the a[s][s]i[s]tance of the waiter, that he had been writing love letters: Mr. Mutchkin, a cautious man, before he would give his con[s]ent to the match, thought proper to call upon the Captain, whom he under[s]tood to be the uncle, or guardian of the young gentleman, with a view of enquiring into his expectations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-457.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] Expectations! [s]aid the Captain, why ju[s]t this; that if he [s]hould chance to get into office, it is well, and if not he mu[s]t return to his bog-trotting. Bog-trotting! [s]aid the merchant. Aye; bog-trotting, [s]aid the Captain: what el[s]e would he do. It is but ten days, or thereabouts, [s]ince he quitted it; and [s]ince, by taking him to levees, and beer-hou[s]es, and rubbing and [s]crubbing him, and teaching him to dance, and giving him [s]ome le[s][s]ons of manners, he has been made fit to appear in the gay world. He has but that pair of breeches that you [s]ee to his back[s]ide, and a pattern not made up yet, that merchant Williams gave him; and for my part I have done all for him that I can do: There is ju[s]t the truth Mr. Mutchkin; and if you chu[s]e to take him for a [s]on-in-law, you are welcome; but as, thank God, I have pre[s]erved a principle of candour and honesty all my life, I will not deceive on this occa[s]ion; and if the match [s]hould prove unfortunate, you will not have me to blame, Mr. Mutchkin, expre[s][s]ed by the staring of his eye, his a[s]toni[s]hment; and as [s]oon as he could [s]peak, thanked the Captain for his candour, and declared his resolution that if Major O'Regan as he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-458.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] the a[s][s]urance to call him[s]elf, [s]hould again come to his hou[s]e, he would turn him out of doors; and that if his daughter [s]hould give him the lea[s]t countenance for the future, he would di[s]own her entirely: He had taken the greate[s]t pains with her in her education; [s]he had been taught all the polite accompli[s]hments that could become a lady; dancing, mu[s]ic, painting, reading French, the Belles Lettres, geography, &c. and if, after all this, [s]he would throw her[s]elf away on a raggamuffin to the di[s]credit of the family, he would no longer take notice of her. Fair, and [s]oftly, [s]aid the Captain; I have a word of advice to give on the subject. It is true, I have not travelled much through the world; [s]o as to vi[s]it France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal; nevertheless, I have [s]ome general knowledge of the principles of human nature; not only from books, but from my own observations, of the [s]mall circum[s]tances that have fallen in my way, and reflection upon them; and have found, that in the intellectual province, as well as in material works, art accompli[s]hes more than force; nay, as in mechani[s]m, the arch is strengthened by the very weight you put upon it, [s]o, where the imagination is concerned, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-459.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] attachment is fixed by an oppo[s]ition to it. Hence, it is, that the di[s][s]ua[s]ion of parents, guardians, or friends is often [s]o ineffectual, with their daughters or wards, in matters of love. It will behoove you, on this occa[s]ion, in order to accompli[s]h your object, to conceal your knowledge of the circum[s]tances communicated; to allow the bog-trotter free ingre[s]s and egre[s]s as u[s]ual, and to affect to [s]peak of him with re[s]pect. Leave it to me to [s]ay [s]uch things to the young lady, as under pretence of recommending her lover, will be effectual to di[s]gu[s]t her, and remove her attachment, Mr. Mutchkin impre[s][s]ed with the sincerity and good [s]en[s]e of the Captain, consented to be guided by him in this bu[s]ine[s]s, and accordingly going home was [s]ilent to the mother and daughter with re[s]pect to the conver[s]ation he had with the old gentleman, who was con[s]idered as the uncle of Teague: and the following day when the Captain waited upon the family, and was introduced by Mr. Mutchkin, who retiring under pretence of bu[s]ine[s]s, left him alone with the daughter and mother to make u[s]e of the means he had propo[s]ed. For Mr. Mutchkin well knew that O'Regan was a great favorite with the mother; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-460.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] and that it would be as difficult to convince her as the daughter, of the impo[s]ition in his character. Nay, as [s]he had promoted the match, her pride, unle[s]s [s]he her[s]elf was the fir[s]t to detect the impo[s]ture, would hinder her from [s]eeing it, or at lea[s]t acknowledging it at all. Being [s]eated, conver[s]ation en[s]ued, and Mrs. Mutchkin, paid the Captain many compliments on the fine figure and addre[s]s of his nephew. Mi[s]s Mutchkin, hung down her head, and blu[s]hed, as being in the pre[s]ence of the uncle of her lover and hearing the name of Major O'Regan mentioned. Why madam, [s]aid the Captain, I under[s]tand that the bog-trotter, has been well received in your family. It is true I am not his uncle, nor is he a Major; neverthele[s]s many uncles have had wor[s]e nephews; and there have been Majors that did not perhaps ever [s]ee [s]o much [s]ervice: for I have under[s]tood from him[s]elf that he was inli[s]ted once when he was drunk, and was a while in the barracks in Dublin; but got off when the matter came to be examined, and it was found that advantage had been taken of him. For the Lord Lieutenant had given [s]trict orders, that in the enli[s]tments the utmo[s]t fairne[s]s [s]hould be u[s]ed; nor, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-461.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] indeed was it nece[s][s]ary in time of peace, to take advantage; becau[s]e there were men enough to be got voluntarily, and deliberately to enter the [s]ervice. Nor indeed had Teague him[s]elf any objections to be a [s]oldier, but that his con[s]titution had not given him that courage which is nece[s][s]ary to enable a man to face an enemy with fire arms: He could cudgel at a fair, or the like, where he was [s]upported by others that would take the weight of the battle off his hands; but except to wre[s]tle at carni[s]h hug, as he calls it, with a ho[s]tler, now and then, I never knew him fond of any contention what[s]oever. I under[s]tand that he has been fortunate enough to render him[s]elf agreeable to the young lady your daughter, and I congratulate myself on the pro[s]pect of having [s]o accomplished a young woman to be the wife of my dome[s]tic. I have had him now the[s]e three years. I bought him out a [s]hip of Iri[s]h [s]ervants. He has been always faithful to me in the offices in which I employed him, [s]uch as bru[s]hing boots, and rubbing down my hor[s]e. It is true his manners were a little rude at fir[s]t, but I have taken a good deal of pains to teach him [s]ome of the outlines of a decent behaviour, [s]uch as to blow his no[s]e with a handkerchief, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-462.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] and keep from breaking wind in company, a practice to which he was a good deal addicted at his fir[s]t [s]etting out; and though he takes long [s]trides as you may [s]ee, from wearing brogues, and bog-trotting; yet in the cour[s]e of time, this and other habits may be broke, by being in good company. He has made considerable improvement in the [s]hort time, I have taken pains with him. Though but ten days [s]ince he was heaved down, and curried and bru[s]hed up for a gentleman, he has learned to chew food, without grea[s]ing his chin and cheeks. If he [s]hould fall into the hands of a lady of ta[s]te, as he is like to do, [s]he may improve him [s]till more. It will be of particular advantage to him to get a woman that can write and read; as I under[s]tand Mi[s]s Mutchkin can do very well; for as he can neither read nor write him[s]elf, it is nece[s][s]ary that there [s]hould be one of a family that can. He has been fortunate at the taverns where we lodged to get the waiters to write and read billets to ladies; but [s]uch cannot be always at hand for the[s]e things; but a wife may. It is true his hopes in government are uncertain, as to being an amba[s][s]ador or con[s]ul, but he may get to be a valet de chambre to one of the[s]e: and though [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-463.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] the ambition of Mi[s]s Mutchkin may not be [s]o much flattered, as to be the lady of a mini[s]ter, yet true happine[s]s is to be found in contentment; and the love [s]he has for his per[s]on, may make amends for the want of rank and honor; much more for the want of fortune; for riches are but dro[s]s, and the maid of a kitchen may be as happy as the mi[s]tre[s]s in the parlour. His fortune indeed is not much. He has nothing of his own, but what dre[s]s he wears, and a pattern of a pair of breeches, not yet made up. My e[s]tate is but [s]mall, con[s]i[s]ting in a farm, and implements of hu[s]bandry, with a couple of hor[s]es, one of which I have rode from home, while he bog-trotted by my [s]ide. Neverthele[s]s, if he marries Mi[s]s Mutchkin I will endeavor to do [s]omething for him, and for two or three years to come will engage to find him in breeches and wai[s]tcoats. The young lady was confounded and withdrew. The mother was [s]ilent, and with all her heart wi[s]hed the Captain gone, that [s]he might dige[s]t her mortification in private. The Captain [s]aw all this; but without [s]eeming to [s]ee it, pre[s]erved a grave countenance, and with [s]ome apology of having an engagement [s]o that he could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-464.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] not have the honor of a longer conversation, he took his leave. The dialogue that took place after this between the mother and the daughter, may be more ea[s]ily imagined than expressed. It was conluded that when O'Regan came next to the hou[s]e, the porter [s]hould be ready with a cow[s]kin to give him a [s]uitable reception. Mr. Mutchkin coming in was made acquainted with the di[s]covery of Major O'Regan's hi[s]tory. Affecting to be as much a[s]toni[s]hed as them[s]elves, he observed, that it would be however proper to di[s]mi[s]s him with civility, as he had been received in the capacity of a [s]uitor. Here Mi[s]s Mutchkin again blu[s]hed, not as at fir[s]t, with an affected blu[s]h of mode[s]ty, when Major O'Regan was at any time mentioned, but with the blu[s]h of confu[s]ion and [s]hame. The mother di[s]covering in her countenance all the emotions of wounded pride, and ungovernable resentment, avowed her determination to have him received with a cow[s]kin by the porter. Mr. Mutchkin, affecting to acquiesce, as the[s]e were matters in which he did not wi[s]h to concern, did but confirm the re[s]olution. Accordingly, that evening, when the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-465.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] bog-trotter being on the point of marriage as he thought, came to take tea with Mi[s]s Mutchkin, ringing the bell, and being admitted, a [s]tout fellow, an Engli[s]hman, who [s]erved in the capacity of Porter, being prepared with a very heavy cowskin, made an attack upon him. The Iri[s]hman exclaimed, and called out for Mi[s]s Mutchkin. O! God love your dear lady[s]hip, Mi[s]s Mutchkin; by [s]haint Patrick; by de holy apo[s]tles, I [s]hall be kilt and murdered into de bargain! O! I [s]hall be kilt and murdered. God love your [s]houl [s]top wid your cow[s]kin, till I [s]ay may prayers; and [s]pare my life; O! I [s]hall be kilt and murdered, O! dis night, in de hou[s]e here. Mi[s]s Mutchkin, where is your dear lady[s]hip, to look upon me wid your eyes, and [s]ave me from dis bateing? O! I am kilt and murdered. Saying the[s]e words the porter had kicked him out of the hou[s]e, and [s]hutting the door, left him to his exclamations in the [s]treet. Coming home, to the Captain, he made a woeful complaint of the di[s]a[s]ter that had befallen him; which the Captain took care not to alleviate, but increa[s]e, alledging, that it mu[s]t have been [s]ome former lover of the lady, who was exa[s]perated at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-466.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] the preference given, and took this method of revenge; that he now [s]aw how dangerous it was to interfere with men of [s]pirit in their court[s]hips, and he ought to be more careful for the future. Containing Ob[s]ervations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-467.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] HAVING given the preceding hi[s]tory, and put my name to it, there is no man that knows me, will doubt of the truth of it. For I have always con[s]idered the fir[s]t character of an hi[s]torian to be veracity; and in all my former compo[s]itions, have endeavored to preserve that character. There being therefore no doubt of the facts, it will remain only to account for them, and indeed, though we have partly done it already, in [s]ome ob[s]ervations we have made, yet this, and the like circum[s]tances which occur every day in life, of Teague O'Regans and bog-trotters, being the favorites of ladies in preference to the mo[s]t accompli[s]hed men, is [s]o contrary to what we would expect, that it may de[s]erve a more minute developement of the cau[s]es and principles. In early times, and even yet among[s]t [s]imple and uninformed people, the effect has been attributed to love potions, or witchcraft; that is, either to [s]ome drug, or draught affecting the nerves, and deranging the brain; or to [s]ome [s]upernatural power operating on the faculties. But exploding the[s]e, we [s]hall endeavor to explain the phenomenon upon the common principles of the affections of the heart, and the power of the imagination. But it mu[s]t be presumed that in general, advantage of per[s]on, good [s]en[s]e, and virtue prevail with the females, and where the oppo[s]ite is the ca[s]e, it is to be con[s]idered as out of the common cour[s]e of choice. Why it ever [s]hould be [s]o, may depend on this; that a Teague O'Regan having little [s]en[s]ibility of nerve, has all that apathy from nature which the man of addre[s]s has from habit, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-468.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] more [s]teadily, becau[s]e the one is nature, the other art: and coolne[s]s in love, is a great [s]ecret of [s]ucce[s]s. Sensibility is irritable, unper[s]evering, de[s]ponding, extravagant; and hence it is that no man who is deeply enamoured of a lady before [s]he has conceived [s]ome attachment on her part, has an equal chance to be acceptable. The fond love of a refined mind, produces [s]illine[s]s, in proportion to the delicacy of the feelings; and the contra[s]t being more ob[s]ervable, the wi[s]e man becomes, or appears to be the greater fool. The Teague O'Regan makes love without any heart at all; he attends upon a lady as he would tread mortar: flatters her as he would [s]peak to a parrot, or [s]troke a cat, without a [s]ingle [s]en[s]ation to di[s]turb him. The appearance of [s]ecurity on the part of the lover, gives the lady to [s]uppo[s]e that he is con[s]cious of advantages, and of cour[s]e that there mu[s]t be [s]uch which [s]he does not yet di[s]cover: or conceiving that [s]he has not yet ab[s]olutely engaged him, [s]he makes it an object to in[s]pire his attachment, and the very exerci[s]e of her own pa[s][s]ions kindles a flame; for hopes and fears are the aliments of love. A Teague O'Regan has no [s]entiment of his own, and therefore he approves all the rea[s]on, and laughs at all the wit of the lady; [s]o that putting her in love with her[s]elf, [s]he becomes in love with him. A man of [s]en[s]e, expre[s][s]es it; but if contrary to the lady's [s]en[s]e, [s]he thinks it non[s]en[s]e, and he becomes the Teague O'Regan in her judgment. Again, a Teague O'Regan is repre[s][s]ed by no [s]en[s]e of honour, or regard to a permanent happine[s]s, from pa[s][s]ing him[s]elf for what he is not, and practi[s]ing imposition, he impo[s]es; talking of his great relations when he has none, and of an e[s]tate when the right owner, as the Iri[s]h phra[s]e is, keeps him out of it, and provided he can obtain the lady, he never thinks of the catastrophe when the deception is di[s]covered. A Teague O'Regan is le[s]s oppo[s]ed by his rivals; becau[s]e no one [s]uppo[s]es that he can prevail. He is a[s][s]i[s]ted by the female acquaintance of the lady, becau[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-469.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] they wi[s]h her mortified by making a bad choice. In affairs of love there is no lady has a friend except a father, an uncle, or a brother; not always a mother, [s]eldom a [s]i[s]ter, but never any one el[s]e. Becau[s]e the pride of a mother may be hurt by the defect of attention to her[s]elf; the jealou[s]y of a [s]i[s]ter is rou[s]ed, even tho' provided for, le[s]t it [s]hould appear [s]he had not married equally well; and therefore the greater the fool, the more friends he has with all the world, in his advances. But [s]etting all the[s]e principles a[s]ide, a particular circumstance, as in the late ca[s]e of the bog-trotter may operate for the [s]ea[s]on, and make it an object to be addressed by him. I [s]hall conclude the[s]e [s]trictures, by laying down [s]ome rules, for a prudent father, or guardian to correct the imagination of a young lady, who appears to be facinated with a bog-trotter; and in doing this, I conceive I [s]hall render e[s][s]ential [s]ervice to humanity. It is a painful thing, having accumulated property, for the [s]ake of a child; and having taken pains to improve and poli[s]h, to have her thrown away upon a bea[s]t; for according to the expre[s][s]ion of the poet, [s]ome men are bea[s]ts, compared with others. Man differs more from man, Than man from bea[s]t. Wilmot. As love then is the offspring of the imagination, rea[s]on has nothing to do with it. Ridicule is the only remedy. Never let the Teague O'Regan be oppo[s]ed, or excluded from the hou[s]e; but invited, and laughed at; in the mean time giving the young lady no rea[s]on to [s]uppo[s]e that it is [s]u[s]pected [s]he could po[s][s]ibly have any fancy for [s]uch a per[s]on. The father or guardian may engage [s]ome per[s]ons of both [s]exes, in confidence, to join in the ridicule, and relate or invent incidents of his ab[s]urdities; for as the bog-trotter is making an attack upon the honour and happine[s]s of the family, it is self-defence, and ju[s]tifiable to counteract him by [s]tratagem, when open force will not avail. No object that is made ridiculous can appear amiable; and as to what is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-470.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] respectable, we depend much more upon the opinion of others, than our own. If a lover is oppo[s]ed, the lady attributes it to an old mu[s]ty ta[s]te in the father, or to envy and jealou[s]y in others, and out of pride [s]he will [s]upport him; whereas if he is ridiculed, [s]he becomes a[s]hamed of him, and gives him up. I have thought it worth while to give this hint; becau[s]e the greater part of our romances and comedies in the Engli[s]h language are calculated to depreciate the re[s]pect which a young lady ought to have for the opinion of aged and grave per[s]ons; and to confirm her in taking the Teague O'Regan of her own choice. For all [s]uch are u[s]ually repre[s]ented as old humdrum curmudgeons, or grany's who[s]e judgment is not worth regarding, and who[s]e ta[s]te, in affairs of love, as in their dre[s]s, is antiquated, unfa[s]hionable, and ab[s]urd; but the adventurers, and fortune hunters, are all po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of ta[s]te, and [s]pirit, and gallantry, and carry off the dam[s]el and make her happy. They [s]top ju[s]t at the marriage, and give no view of the di[s]gu[s]t, repentance, and unhappine[s]s that en[s]ues. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-471.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] Taking advantage of the humiliated [s]tate of mind in which the bog-trotter now was, from the late cow[s]kining, he had received, the Captain thought he could be drawn off from an extreme attention to the ladies, and engaged to apply to the qualifying him[s]elf for [s]tate affairs. Accordingly continuing his addre[s]s to him, he ob[s]erved, that though gallantry and waiting upon ladies, was very agreeable, yet prudence ought to be ob[s]erved not to create enemies, by [s]eeming to engro[s]s their attachment, [s]o as to put a man in danger of duels, and cow[s]kinings: at the [s]ame time it behooved a man not to [s]uffer his gallantry to interfere with bu[s]ine[s]s; and more e[s]pecially in the early [s]tages when he was about qualifying him[s]elf for any occupation, or appointment; that, as he (Teague O'Regan) was a candidate for [s]tate affairs, he ought to check his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-472.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] career, and withdraw him[s]elf for [s]ome time from the gay circles, in order to acquire [s]ome [s]mall things which were nece[s][s]ary to the creditable and convenient di[s]charge of a public function; [s]uch as learning to write his name if po[s][s]ible. As to learning to read, or write generally that would be a thing of years, if at all acquirable at his period of life; but he might be taught to imitate the few characters that composed his name, in [s]uch a manner as to pa[s]s for it; [s]o that when he had to [s]ign dispatches or commi[s][s]ions, or the like, he need not be under the nece[s][s]ity of making his mark, like an Indian at a treaty; but might do [s]omething that would pa[s]s for a [s]ignature in letters of the alphabet. So providing him with a room, and placing a table before him with an ink[s]tand, and [s]trewing [s]ome papers, and furni[s]hing him with [s]pectacles, as if he was already making out di[s]patches, he began to in[s]truct him in making the letters, T, E, A, G, U, E, &c. But he had [s]carcely begun, when the waiter coming in, delivered a parcel of cards, and billets for Major O'Regan. The Captain in[s]tantly reflecting that this corre[s]pondence with the gay world would undo all that he was doing, and draw off the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-473.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] bog-trotter from his le[s][s]ons, as [s]oon as the [s]mart of the cow[s]kining had worn off, [s]aw it nece[s][s]ary to read the billets as from different per[s]ons, and containing language different from what was in them. The cards being chiefly from men in public employment, he read as they really were. Opening one of the large[s]t of the billets, aye, [s]aid he, there is more of it. Do you know this John[s]ton that [s]eems [s]o much enraged about Mi[s]s Mu[s]lin to whom you have paid [s]ome attention? by the bye, it was a billet from Mi[s]s Mu[s]lin, to who[s]e acquaintance it would [s]eem he had been introduced; but the Captain read John[s]ton. By de holy fathers, [s]aid Teague, I know no John[s]ton. He [s]ends you a challenge, [s]aid the Captain, to meet him on the commons this evening at [s]ix o'clock, with a brace of pi[s]tols and a [s]econd to determine whether you or he has the be[s]t right to pay attention to this lady. We [s]hall give the billet as written by the lady, and as read by the Captain. Would wi[s]h to have the plea[s]ure of Major O'Regan's company this evening at tea. Lawyer Crabtree and Doctor Drug will be here; and you know we [s]hall [s]plit [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-474.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] our [s]ides laughing at the ninnies. You're [s]o full of your jokes that I want you here. Dear Major, don't be engaged; but come. Yours [s]incerely, Patty Mu[s]lin. Wedne[s]day Morning. SIR, You will in[s]tantly do one of two things, either relinqui[s]h your attention to Mi[s]s Mu[s]lin, and be no more in her company; or meet me this evening preci[s]ely at [s]ix o'clock, on the commons the back of the Potter's-field, with a brace of pi[s]tols, and a [s]econd, to take a [s]hot. I [s]hall have a coffin ready, and a grave dug, for which ever of us [s]hall have occa[s]ion to make u[s]e of it. Your humble [s]ervant, Benjamin John[s]ton. Major Teague O'Regan. In the [s]ame manner, he read the other billets, converting them from love letters into challenges to fight with mortal weapons, or into declarations of cudgeling, and cow[s]kining if he interfered any farther in his attentions to [s]uch and [s]uch ladies. The bog-trotter began to think the devil was broke loo[s]e upon him, and very [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-475.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] readily gave the Captain leave to write an[s]wers, declining all combats, and declaring his compliance with all that was requested of him. The waiter was the only per[s]on who by receiving the billets, and handing them in the ab[s]ence of the Captain, and reading them to Teague, might inflame his mind with the thoughts of the fine ladies, and gay circles, from which he [s]eemed to be ju[s]t recovered: taking him a[s]ide, therefore, and acco[s]ting him, Mathew, [s]aid he, for that was the name of the waiter, I do not know that I ought to find any fault with your giving your [s]ervice for [s]ome time pa[s]t, to my Teague, in reading the billets directed to him, and in writing his an[s]wers; but I de[s]ire that there may be nothing more of this. As he is about to be clo[s]ely engaged for [s]ome time to come, in acquiring [s]ome [s]cholar[s]hip, and preparing to enter on [s]ome [s]tate appointment, I do not chu[s]e that his mind [s]hould be taken off by affairs of compliment or love. All billets therefore directed to him, you will for the future hand to me. The waiter promi[s]ed compliance, and [s]aid it was all the [s]ame thing to him, as all he had done, was to oblige the bog-trotter, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-476.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] if it was di[s]agreeable to him (the Captain) he [s]hould do no more of it. However, Teague continuing [s]till to have [s]ome hankering after the company of the ladies, [s]o as not to have his mind [s]o much upon learning to write the characters of his name as the Captain could have wi[s]hed, he found it nece[s][s]ary to engage the bar-keeper to a[s][s]i[s]t him in per[s]onating now and then, [s]ome one who had come to demand [s]atisfaction for the interference of the bog-trotter in affairs of love, that by keeping up the alarm on his mind, he might the better confine him to his [s]tudies. According to the plan agreed upon the bar-keeper knocking at the door, and the Captain opening it a little, and demanding his bu[s]ine[s]s; is there not a Major O'Regan here, he would [s]ay (with a counterfeited voice) who has preten[s]ions to Mi[s]s Nubbin? (one of tho[s]e who had [s]ent billets) I wi[s]h to [s]ee the gentleman, and try if I can put this [s]word in his body; (by the bye he had a long [s]word) God love your [s]houl, would O'Regan [s]ay, dear Captain, don't let him in. I [s]hall die wid fear upon de [s]pot here; for I never fought a man in cold blood in my life. Here the bar-keeper as recognizing the voice of O'Regan; yes, would he [s]ay, I find he is here, let [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-477.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] me in, that I may put this through him; I had paid my addre[s][s]es to Mi[s]s Nubbin, and was ju[s]t about to e[s]pou[s]e her, when, unlike a gentleman, he has interferred, and turned her head with his attention. By the New Jeru[s]alem I [s]hall be through his wind pipe in a [s]econd. Teague hearing this and rai[s]ing the Iri[s]h howl, would redouble his entreaties to the Captain not to let him in. The Captain would [s]ay, Sir, if you mean to make a pa[s]s at him, you mu[s]t make it through me; for I [s]hall not [s]tand to [s]ee a dome[s]tic run through the body, and his guts out, while mine are in. You may therefore de[s]i[s]t, or I [s]hall have you taken into cu[s]tody, as a breaker of the peace, With this he would [s]hut the door, and the bar-keeper would go off cur[s]ing and [s]wearing that he would have revenge for the in[s]ult that had been offered him, by the Iri[s]hman. By the[s]e artifices, certainly innocent as the object was good; for it can be no injury to deceive a man to his own advantage; by the[s]e artifices, the Captain succeeded, in preventing a corre[s]pondence with the gay world, and detaching the mind of his pupil, from the gallantries of love. But when any member of Congre[s]s or officer of [s]tate called upon him, he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-478.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] was admitted. Traddle called frequently, and declared that he had no re[s]entment on account of Teague's propo[s]ing to be his competitor, at the election in the country; but wi[s]hed him [s]ucce[s]s in obtaining [s]ome appointment where his talents might be u[s]eful. Containing Thoughts on [s]ome preceding Subjects. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-479.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] In looking over this volume, it [s]trikes me that by introducing Teague to the levee, I may be thought to mean a burlesque on the Pre[s]ident. It is not [s]o; I meant a burle[s]que on Teague. As to levee-holding, I do not know whether it is right or wrong; nor do I care. Because, be it as it may, I believe it can do little harm, and is one of tho[s]e in[s]ipidities in the affairs of men which are of no account. Univer[s]al prudence is a characteristic of the Pre[s]ident, with a capacity of attending to [s]ub[s]tantial bu[s]ine[s]s, and being able at the [s]ame time to accommodate him[s]elf to forms and ceremonies. As all mankind are not philo[s]ophers, perhaps it is well to po[s][s]e[s]s this talent, in order to plea[s]e them: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-480.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] As to what I have [s]aid on the [s]ubject of certificates, it may be a[s]ked what the induction of [s]hewing that by the municipal law the transfer might be [s]et a[s]ide in equity? Ju[s]t this; that if a court of equity could act with [s]uch latitude, the people them[s]elves, in a national capacity, might with as much. I never had an idea that after the[s]e [s]ecurities, became the [s]ubject of traffic, and had acquired a fixed value, for this was nearly the ca[s]e through all the [s]tates, that any means would have been adopted to di[s]turb them. If any means had been adopted, I had expected that at lea[s]t a [s]cale would have been formed to ascertain their value; as in the ca[s]e of the continental money; and I would have wanted nothing more than the letter of John Adams to the Count de Vergennes, in the ca[s]e of the continental money, to ju[s]tify the like [s]tep in the ca[s]e of the certificates. At any rate the transferees would have been contented, nay, thought them[s]elves very happy with a French crown in the pound, certain payment, or with le[s]s; and if it [s]hould be [s]aid that the original holders had no claim, having parted with their right, let the ma[s]s of the people be the gainers, in which ca[s]e the originalholders would gain [s]omething, not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-481.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] having [s]o much of the very debt to di[s]charge which was originally due to them[s]elves. But at the [s]ame time that I arraign the policy of the [s]y[s]tem, I do not call in que[s]tion the integrity or patrioti[s]m of the authors of it. I con[s]ider it as an error in judgment, and as I have already hinted, flowing from the exce[s]s of integrity it[s]elf: doing too much, from a fear of falling [s]hort of doing enough. But as the [s]y[s]tem now exists, it mu[s]t be [s]upported; all retreat is impracticable, and we mu[s]t advance. As to peace with the Indians; in order to effect it, my fir[s]t [s]tep would be, to establish a po[s]t at Pre[s]qu'i[s]le; build and equip ve[s][s]els on the lake; tran[s]port troops, and e[s]tabli[s]h a [s]econd po[s]t at the rapids of the Miami river: from this la[s]t po[s]t, make an advance to the Miami towns. It will doubtle[s]s be nece[s][s]ary to fight the Indians once; but only once, if beaten; for [s]eeing them[s]elves thus cut off from the Briti[s]h, their re[s]olution will as certainly die, as a plant cut from the root, and left to wither in the mid-day [s]un. A [s]tep of this nature will convince the Briti[s]h that we mean to hold the we[s]tern country, and will hold it; and lo[s]ing the hope which they entertain of po[s][s]e[s][s]ing it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-482.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] them[s]elves, they will be checked in their in[s]tigation of the [s]avages again[s]t us. It is a [s]trange thing that ideas of treating under pre[s]ent circum[s]tances, cannot possibly be eradicated from the minds of the public. I have conver[s]ed abundantly with men who know the Indians, and have been much among[s]t them [s]ince the conclu[s]ion of the war with the Briti[s]h. I do not draw my inferences as men in government do, from per[s]ons intere[s]ted in having treaties brought about: I have conver[s]ed with traders that have been in the woods, and not at the [s]eat of government, that have as much [s]en[s]e, and more truth, than Indian negociators who, unle[s]s treaties are [s]et on foot, are of no u[s]e. What has been the re[s]ult of my information? I will give the very language of the Indians. "You are learned, ([s]peaking of us) you think your[s]elves wi[s]e; and can get our land by giving your goods. Our chie[s]s are not learned, but are more wi[s]e; for they can take your goods, and keep our land too." They are po[s]itively astonished at our [s]implicity; for they have no idea of faith and honour in the ca[s]e. The greater fraud, the more honour, if it can be committed with impunity. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-483.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] They mu[s]t be made to dread us: that is the truth of it. Is this practicable? Ea[s]ily. Di[s]card treaties; increa[s]e, or at lea[s]t fill up, the e[s]tabli[s]hment of troops, under the command of General Wayne. Let him have an opportunity of giving them at lea[s]t one blow. This will do more good than a thou[s]and fires kindled, and ten thou[s]and bales of goods given. We are now in a fair way to be able to beat them. Our troops, not the be[s]t materials it is true, the be[s]t men not always enli[s]ting as [s]oldiers, at the low pay [s]tipulated; but from the great exertions of the Commander in Chief, in the cour[s]e of the la[s]t [s]ummer, and the present winter, they are certainly in a good [s]tate of di[s]cipline. It would be a pity that all this expence in rai[s]ing troops, and exertions in training them, [s]hould evaporate in the [s]moke of a treaty. OF THE THIRD VOLUME. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800&image=800-484.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] Looking over the preceding [s]heets, and observing [s]everal errors of the pre[s]s, I had thoughts of giving a table of them. But I recollect that in other books, a table of this kind has appeared to me unnece[s][s]ary.--- Becau[s]e the intelligent reader could in general him[s]elf [s]ee what were errors, and as to the unintelligent, it made no great odds, whether he did or not. But in ju[s]tice to the printer, it may be nece[s][s]ary to adverti[s]e the reader, that I have been the corrector of the pre[s]s my[s]elf, and therefore with re[s]pect to the[s]e errors he is not in fault. The truth is, though I am an excellent writer, I mean as to author[s]hip, yet I am, perhaps the wor[s]t corrector of a pre[s]s in the world. I have not patience in what is in the lea[s]t degree mechan nical. It is impo[s][s]ible for me to examine literatim and verbatim; not even indeed lineatim and paginatim. I ca[s]t a quick glance upon the [s]heet, and unle[s]s [s]omething very glaring [s]trikes my eye, I let it pa[s]s. As to the fate of the bog-trotter, I mu[s]t leave the matter in [s]u[s]pence until the fourth volume, when I [s]hall di[s]po[s]e of him to as much advantage as po[s][s]ible. I have only farther to [s]ay at pre[s]ent, that I wi[s]h I could get this work to make a little more noi[s]e. Will no body attack it, and prove that it is in[s]ipid, libellous, trea[s]onable, immoral, or irreligious? If they will not do this, let them do [s]omething el[s]e, prai[s]e it, call it excellent, [s]ay it contains wit, erudition, genius, and the Lord knows what? Will no body [s]peak? What? Ho! are ye all a[s]leep in the hold there down at Philadelphia? Will none of you abu[s]e, prai[s]e, reprobate, or commend this performance? It is ill u[s]age; that is all I can [s]ay; and I will take my revenge in a [s]hort time unle[s]s the matter mends, by dropping my pen altogether, as I now do for the pre[s]ent.
