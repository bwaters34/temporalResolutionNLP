 set such faithfull  & vigilant Centinells about me; that had not his then being abroad, and their vnusuall neglect both concurr'd for Perolla's safety, he might have fallen into troubles, the thoughts of which has a thousand times created mine; And he was no sooner retir'd than Blacius came into my Chamber, where with many expressions of gladnesse he celebrated his Protectors remove, & enjoyn'd me the like resentments for the same cause: but though disobedience to Parents be a Crime, yet when I consider'd the occasion of mine, I could not give it that Name, for I esteem'd the object of my affection so deseruing, that I had noe way so justly to merrit my sufferings as by not resolutly avowing so pure & meritorious a Freindship. But whilst I was thus persecuted by the Enemy of our affections, Perolla was persecuting him of our Empire. 'Twas he who vnder Fabius & Marcellus recover'd that Cassilinum by assault which was lost by Famine: 'Twas he that dureing Marcellus Sicknesse at Nola reconquer'd the Samnites, Lucanians, & Appulians, by the losse of 25000 of the Rebells & Affricans: In a word, 'Twas he perform'd such sublime Actions, that had I not knowne the Charmes of his Person and conversation, I could not yet have resisted those of his Fame. The Winter which succeeded this active Summer Hanniball made Salapia his head Quarters, and though he had endeavour'd by a world of civilities to make a Freind of Blacius (who Perolla, intent only on those accidents which related to his Amours had omitted to acquaint you was invited and perswaded into this Towne by the Carthaginian, after it was his) yet the miseries of his Country, and Magius blood were so recent in his memory, that none of Hanniballs inticements could induce him to stifle his designes of revenge; in order to which he made use of the Carthaginians offer, but yet liu'd vnder his Power, only to destroy it. But the tyme of Fabius Consulship being expir'd the Senate to testify the vallue they plac't upon his merit, elected his Sonne to succeed him, & the Father either to manifest the Goodnesse of their choyce, or to evince he beleeu'd who ever they esteem'd fit to command in Cheife he thought himselfe not too good to serve vnder, procur'd a Commission from the Senate to be Leiutenant Generall to his owne Sonne. It was worthy observation when the Father came into the Campe and the Sonne road forth to meet him. Eleven of the twelue Lictors which carried Rodds and Axes before the Consull, suffer'd him in respect of his Age & relations to passe by them on Horseback, which was positively against the custome, & which the Sonne perceiving commanded the last of his Lictors to note it, who thereupon bade the old Fabius to alight and come to the Consull on Foote, which he cheerefully did, and told him, 'twas not (Sonne) my neglect but my designe, to make tryall whether you understood your selfe to be what you are. I have related (said Izadora to my Prince) a perticular which though it has nothing of connexion to our story, yet being in that tyme exceedingly discourst of, I hope 'twill procure your excuse. Spartacus having assur'd hir that shee had committed noe fault but in thinking shee had committed one, begg'd hir to prosecute those Adventures wherein he tooke so much interest and satisfaction. This young Fabius (shee continu'd) was Generall of the Roman Army when Blacius had brought a designe of delivering Salapia and Hanniball into the Senates Power to so much perfection, that there wanted only asmuch tyme as the acting it would take up; The day which preceded that Night in which this plott was to be executed, my Father, who had covertly drawne the Consull with some forces neere this Towne, sent a Confident of his to advertice him, that at any hower he should appoint, he had so many Partizans at his devotion, as he could secure for him either the Samnite or the Brutian Gate, and that he desir'd to knowe which of them would be most commodious for his attempt. This Agent retourning aboute the duske of the Euening vnfortunatly mett with a Commander of the Carthaginians, whose gate & habitt was so resembling unto Blacius's, that blinded with that beleife, he tooke him aside and told him the Consull would not faile at midnight, and that the Samnite Gate would be the most commodious. You may easily beleive these words did asmuch surprize the Carthaginian, as the knowledge of this miserable errour did afterwards him that had comitted it; But the Carthaginian had too-long follow'd the trade of Warre not to conclude by what had bin said what was to have bin done, which made him immediatly seize upon the unfortunate Agent, & carry him to Hanniball, who by exquisite Torments forc't him to reveale the whole conspiracy. This discovery was as pleasing to Pacuvius (who then was present) as deplorable for Blacius, who with exceeding diligence was by a strong Guard violently carry'd into a Prison, which in the greatnesse of it's horror had this of advantagious, that it made Death a Comparative Good. Fabius for all sustain'd noe losse but that of his hopes, for though he were in Armes all Night, yet by my Fathers committall the signall not being given (which was a lighted Torch out of a Turret Window) he conceiu'd the designe had vent, and so leasurely a little before day retreated to his Campe. But alas I was no sooner inform'd of Blacius sadd Fate than I lamented him as dead, the knowledge of Hanniballs vindicative Nature justifying that propheticall way of greiving: but after I had moderated those Teares which my sexe and relation render'd vnauoydable, and that thereby my Reason was the lesse hinder'd from acting, I resolved to write unto Perolla who I knew was in the Consulls Army. The letter I sent by a trusty Messenger, and was to this purpose.  power with Fabius preserue it, by obtaining Prisoners for his ransome, or suspend his Death by a high Message of makeing all the Affricans in his hands follow my Fathers destiny. Doe not now I beseech you consider Blacius as Perolla's Enemy, but as Izadora's Father, and by a second protecting him create his affection, or so justify mine, that want of duty may appeare virtue: and though his past insensibility would render your Reuenge very just, yet your saueing him will therefore render your Generosity more eminent  to make his revenge appeare rather the effect of justice than of passion, proceeded against Blacius in the ordinary formes of Lawe, by which he was condemn'd to lose his Head, and to have his foure Quarters fixt upon the Gates of Salapia for a future Terror to all others.  o Gods! when this fatall sentence came to my hearing, what did I not vtter against Hanniballs Cruelty and Blacius ill fortune? but whilst I was in the midst of my despaire, my Messenger return'd with this Answer from my generous Freind.  apprehende my not being his; But as he is Izadora's Father, he cannot without a higher doubt of my exposing all that is most pretious for him;  & though his seuerity has bin somewhat great, yet his admirable Daughter by a contrary extreame has so over-repayred all his injuries, that the seruice I intend to render him will relish asmuch of Gratitude as obedience. Fabius Madam will embrace your Fathers deliuerance as he ought, and if his endeauors proue vnsuccessefull, I will either free him from so sadd a destiny, or my selfe from the misery of seeing you deplore it.  Oh, how pleasing and forlorne at once was this Letter? I sawe my Fathers deliverance promis'd, but the way which conduc'd unto it was almost as great a misfortune as it exempted me from: for I found I must hazard all my felicity in attempting to save but a large parte of it. Whilst I was thus perplext, I was inform'd that the Consull had sent a Trumpet to Hanniball with an offer of all his Libian Prisoners for the redemption of Blacius, and a deepe protestation in case he executed him, that he would give no Quarter to those he had already nor to any others in the future. To the first of which the Carthaginian reply'd, That he valu'd the execution of justice more than the Romans could the saveing a Traytor, and upon that score he would not pardon Blacius life for a fewe Prisoners, who by being so merited to continue so: And as to his latter threatning, he beleiv'd it was sent when he remember'd not Cannes, Trebia, Tissinum, and Thrassimene, and though Fabius by executing those he had then in his power would sooner free him from a trouble than give him any, yet he would consider that action as 'twas intended, & vindicate himselfe at that rate. In a word, he sent him a positive answer, That all the offers or threatnings of the Romans, noe nor the saving his deare Brother Assruballs Life (were it in their power) should tye up his hands from so just and necessary a Revenge. I was further acquainted that Hanniball had given order before the Trumpet was with drawne, to have a scaffold erected in the Allarme place, and had sworne by the glory of Carthage & his Fathers Memory (oaths which he hold in greatest veneration) That before two dayes were ended Blacius should receive the reward of his infidelity. I might appeare too impertinent did I acquaint you what sadd operations this cruell sentence produced in me, it shall suffice to tell you, that my weeping in the apprehension of my Fathers death had well-neere caus'd my owne, and that I shedd so many antedated Teares for it, that had the cruell Hanniball seene them they would doubtlesse have qench'd his rage. But whilst I abandon'd my selfe to a Greife that was as just as great, the Night arriv'd which was Eve to that fatall day, and as the horror of darknesse is alwayes apt to raise in us dismall immaginations, I fancy'd the vnfortunate Blacius all pale and bloody coming to my Bedd-side, and after he had view'd me with a looke which had allmost reduc't me to the condition he was in, he told me, behold Izadora, behold these severall wounds (which he open'd so wide that his soule had it yet inhabited his body might have come entire out of the least of them) though they are full of torment, yet I have forc't my selfe to travell from the Elizium, where I have receiv'd the reward of my fidelity to the Romans & of my Martyrdome under Hanniball, to come and conjure thee by the Duty thou owedst me before I was a Ghost: by the joy I have left: and the paine I shall suffer 'till thou grauntest my request: now thou art at thy owne dispose, never shew thou hast that power by giveing thy selfe to Perolla, but as thou art Heire to out blood, be so also to our generous resentments, & let him finde that revenge in thy Beauty and disdaine which he thought he had avoyded by the extinction of our Family: if thou graunt'st me this, the blessed Playnes cannot affoard me an equall satisfaction, but if thou deny'st it, all the felicity of that place will lose its quality, & where others finde their happinesse, I shall my torment. These words me thought were spoaken with Eyes swell'd with Teares, and with an accent so moving, that in my life I never was in a higher perplexity: I began a thousand tymes to condemne those learned Men which taught us that the felicity of the other life is so perfect an extacy of loy that it needs no foyle to set it off, & that they in it are noe more sensible of any concerne for us here than we are capable of conceiving their felicity there, when alas to my cost I found one there not only retain'd an vnjust desire of Revenge, which poyson'd all other delights, but also prosecuted a virtue here which was to possesse the highest Empire there: and I esteem'd it one great misfortune of the other world, that those in it were not confin'd to their happinesse, but by having a liberty of goeing from their owne, they could thereby ruine, or at least interrupt ours. oh how I did also inwardly exclaime against my Fathers Tyranny, who pretended a power over me after that by his death the bond was concell'd, and that he would be so much an Enemy to my felicity, as that to deprive me of mine he would involve himselfe in the like Fate. But whilst I was preparing such an answer for this immaginary Ghost as might render my disobedience a justice, I was diverted by a noyse so confused and lowde, that that Death it seem'd to threaten had bin rather to be elected than avoyded, since therein I had bin exempted from hearing so much horror. After halfe an howers suspence and Feare, a Servant of my Fathers came into my Chamber with a lighted Torch, and to remove my doubts told me, he beleiv'd that 'twas some false Allarme, which Hanniball had given to trye the readinesse of his Souldiers, for there was no Enemy neere enough to give him a true one, and whilst he was fortifying this conjecture by some other allegations, we heard a noyse in the garden, and suddenly after I perceiv'd a Gentleman all arm'd and cover'd with blood comeing towards me, and leading another whose bands were loaden with Irons. As soone as the first was come to my Beds-side he kneel'd downe and told me, Your commands Madam have not only giuen me the desire but the Power to serue you, and since by hazarding a Life that I feare is but indifferent to you I have preserv'd one that you highly value, I shall finde in the action the reward; Then riseing and turning towards the Prisoner he continu'd, you are at liberty Sir, and if I had had the power to free you from your Chaines aswell as from your Prison, you had long e're now bin eas'd of that burthen, but that office I must leave to some happier hand least by my continuance here the joy of your freedome might be extinguist by your knowledge of him that gave it you: Then saluting us with an humility as great as his obligation without staying for any answer he went out of the House the same way he came in, and left us in so deepe an astonishment, that for a long while wee could not get out of it. The first thing I perceiv'd after my amazement vanisht, was, that the fetter'd Prisoner was Blacius, ah! how pleasing was that surprize? and how I detested my disorder which had so long suspended & separated me from my joy, which wrought so powerfully on me, that forgetting the posture I was in, I flung my selfe out of my Bedd, & at my Fathers Feete by a thousand irregular actions testifyed the greatnesse of my satisfaction, which the more I reflected on, the lesse cause I found to suppresse any effects which proceeded from or illustrated it, neither can my amazement for the greatnesse and suddennesse of this alteration be attributed to the weaknesse of my Sexe, since Blacius whose courage had out-brav'd many dangers, resented a resembling one. And 'twas a long while & by many extravagancyes that I withdrew him from his, which when I perceiv'd entirely vanisht, I embrac't his Knees & cry'd out, You are then alive Sir, & the Gods have heard my reitterated prayers & Teares for your deliverance. Yes Izadora (he reply'd) I am once againe at liberty, & doubtlesse owe that blessing immediatly to those powers to whome thou hast addrest thy weepings: for certainly those prodigies of valour acted for my releife were too-much transcending a humane strength, But alas (he continu'd) turning about & perceiving none in the Chamber but his vnfortunate Daughter) what is become of my Protector? He is gone Sir (I answer'd) & by his departure has left as high a Testimony of his modesty here, as even now he did of his valour in the Prison. His modesty (said Blacius) is as injurious as his Courage was obligeing, for in acquainting me with a new Gallantry he has depriv'd me of expressing my Gratitude for the old. If (I reply'd) he could but heare your resentments in his favour, I am so well acquainted with his disposition, that I dare assure you he would esteeme them not only too- plentifull a reward for what he has already done, but for those services he hopes to pay you in the future; but the apprehension he had that the same Fate which attended Perolla might waite on him, & that what his vallour did create, your knoledge of his condition might destroy made him so suddenly vanish, & rather elect to leave you a good opinion of him by not knowing his Name, than hazard the contrary by a revealing of it. Am I then (he replyd) still so vnhappy, that to know, & not know to whome I am indebted for my Life must prove an equall misfortune? No no Izadora (he continu'd) I conjure you by all the Gods, if you are acquainted with my Deliverer, & would have me relish what he ha's given me, informe me who he is, & where he resides, for rather than leave him so ill a carracter of my resentments, I will repeate greater dangers than he has free'd me from, and to assure him of my Gratitude, I will undertake (it may be too performe) actions of as transcendent a quality as those which created it: This I command you as a duty, and this I begg of you as a charity, neither cann you suspect in this discovery the same destiny which attended Perolla, the difference of the action justly silenceing those apprehensions, For though it be true that the ends are the same, yet the wayes are etreamly different: Perolla perhaps was surpriz'd into his Gallantry, This acted it with premeditation, That freed me only from the hands of an apparent violence, but This from a seeming Iustice: That did but the duty of every man in suppressing Murtherers who are the destroyers of humane society, & who knowes whether his seeing my distresse did not put him in minde of what his owne might be assoone as my death had given those that were acting it the liberty & the power, and so, that which you terme his giveing me my life, might be in order to preserve his owne, But this generous stranger had nod motive to invite his assistance but his Gallantry, which makes him attempt an action, where the vndertaking of it is as great a wonder as the performance, and has thereby so bound me to Gratitude that I beleive were it Perolla that had thus oblig'd me, I should almost suppresse my just resentments for his Family, and that performace which gave me my life & liberty, might give him my affection and Freindship. Sir (I reply'd) Perolla's actions are of too-high a quality to neede any comendations but what they carry in themselves, & were not my duty more prevalent with me than Truth, I should perhaps averre that your comments can noe more diminish their naturall luster than myne can add unto it, but since you are pleas'd to place so right an esteeme upon this Strangers Services, and expresse as earnest a desire of knowing as of being gratefull to him, I will noe longer conceale him: 'Tis Perolla (Sir). That same Perolla whose former obligations you have lessen'd but to increase the present, 'Tis he whose Gallantry were it capable of being supprest, had doubtlesse bin so by your ingratitude; (Pardon me if I dare say what you did act) But he from your Cruelty deduces arguments to convince you of his Affection and Freindship, by not declineing your preservation when Dangers as great as your hatred threatn'd whosoever should attempt it: 'Tis then, that He with an vnimmitable virtue exposes his owne life to redeeme yours which by a sadd experiment he knew was the cheifest obstruction in his felicity. Give me leave Sir too, a litle to repine that you could fancy any other could vndertake & act so much for you, & certainly were not your judgement clouded with a prejudicate opinion of him, the Gallantry of the performance, and the modesty and humility of the Performer, would have bin a certainer information than my words that it was Perolla, in whose behalfe I begg you to practice (now you know him) what you promi'st when you only knew his services, for all returnes but that of your Affection & Freindship wilbe as short of his merit as both those will abundantly reward it. Blacius when I had ended speakeing after having fetcht two or three turnes about the Roome with an angry looke reply'd, I should have sooner knowne 'twas Perolla by the great rate you set upon his services than by the services themselves, and if I plac't a higher carracter on them than they merited, 'twas only to drawe a Confession from you which I thought nothing else could performe: My designe has succeeded, and in those very expressions which you intended should create my affection for your Lover, I perceive the continuation of yours to him, and in it so high a disobedience to my Commands that that Death I am free'd from turnes to a Misfortune, and forces me to tell you, if you persevere in this crimminall Passion, I shall embrace Hanniballs resentments rather as a cure than a punishment. Alas Sir (I answer'd excedingly surpriz'd) must then Perollas saveing your life, and my Gratitude for it be look't upon as Crymes? and must an obligation from an Enemy which should raise the greatnesse of it, turne it to an offence? Since these are the constructions you make of his actions, 'tis high tyme for him to despaire: since 'tis as impossible for him nor to offend you (if obligations be an offence) as for you with justice to give his performances that name. If what he has done for me (said Blacius) be an obligation, from thence you may derive a proofe of my Affection to you, which had rather indure the Name of vngratefull than by giveing you away, free my selfe from that aspersion. But doe not proceede in this disputeing against my resolutions which may force me to hate what I defire to love. You are too- just (I reply'd) to hate without a cause, and 'tis on that assurance I dare become Perolla's Advocate, since his feare of offending you makes him decline being his owne: doe not then (Sir) employ that breath he has preserv'd to destroy him that gave it you, his service merits an esteeme if not a reward, and it may be others will say you doe as high an injustice in thus useing your Deliverer, as he did that put you in a condition to neede his helpe. (To which Blacius told me) That Life which is now (I hope) out of Hanniballs power, and which you say I owe Perolla's Affection to me, was rather an argument of his owne to himselfe, he knew the justice of those resentments I had for his blood could not be silenc'd but by actions as great as those which created them, and that whilst they continu'd he could no more obtaine my permission of possessing you, than you without it, so that my deliverance being the best way to that ende, he perform'd it, and thereby no more oblidg'd me than a Passenger does the Commander of a Ship by saveing what could not perish without involving him in the common ruine, so that his being a freind to himselfe only made him a Freind to me. Sir (I reply'd) he that sau'd your Life once, and could not by that obligation suppresse your hatred, had no great reason by a repetition of that Favour, to expect a better returne; so that his experience convinceing him your aversion was not to be taken away, he might have suffer'd your Life to have bin so by Hanniball who had both the power and will to doe it: especially, that being the only obstacle to his desires, had not his affection to one of your family inclin'd him upon that Score to love all of it; This gallantry shewes so handsomely, that I hope it will invite yours to an immitation, especially too, since by the effects of it you receive a benefit whose greatnesse cannot be equall'd, but by that injustice which makes you endeavour his ruine that conferr'd it on you. He that by saveing my life (said Blacius extreamly mou'd) found in that action a gratitude so extraordinary as to suppresse a revenge (where my power to performe it was not greater than the justice which invited me to it) might reasonably hope that by a succession of Services of that Nature I might in tyme be induc't aswell to silence my hatred as I had my revenge, so that what you attribute to my Enemyes gallantry, might be better ascrib'd to his reason and judgement: My death too had bin so farre from freeing all his obstructions, that it had but created greater, for I had so order'd it in my Will, that if you had marryed him, you should have broake those Tyes & Conjurations which had render'd you vnworthy of his Bedd, or if his Passion had attributed your want of duty to your Father to be a higher argument of your affection to your Lover, yet you should have brought him nothing but the bare Izadora; for apprehending by what you have done, what you might doe, I had (upon so transcendent a violatio of those comands which I would have seal'd with my last breath) given to another all my estate, which I beleive (whatever advantagious & partiall opinion you have of your selfe) makes Perolla asmuch your Servant as your Beauty. If no one (I reply'd) had a greater value of me than I have of my selfe, Perolla would soone have as Iowe an opinio of me as you have of his Services; & truely when I consider the largnesse of your Fortune, & the litle- Title I have to any perfections which are capable of inviting so transcendent a happinesse as his Affection, I am apt enough to beleive I derive that felicity from the first of those motiues; but on the other side, when I reflect upon those sacred protestations he has made me that his passion was created and is nourisht by my Beauty and vertue, and from no secundary causes, I am inclin'd to beleive any thing rather than that he dissembles; especially since in not crediting his vowes I cannot injure him more than I doe my owne felicity. At this Reply Blacius could no longer suppresse his Choller, but with Eyes and lookes which had terrified me in a Cause lesse just than I now defended, he told me, You are not then only contented to preserve a crimminall Flame in your heart, but you must publish it too, And to raise your insolence to an vnaccessionall height you voluntarily acknowledge that you finde your contentment in that which divests me of myne; but since by your disobedience you will force me to use my paternall power, I will make you e're long not only know but practice your duty. Finishing these words he went out of my Chamber, and left me in as great a trouble at his rigour, as he could resent for my Constancy. I must confesse that my Affection made me say things which I should have condemn'd upon any other score, and which after my resentment was a litle over I endeavourd to wash away with Teares. But no passions of Love or Repentance were hardly more predominant in me, than those of Rage and Fury were in Hanniball, who could not reflect upon the injury done his Authority and Revenge, by forceing a Prison in his Head-Quarters & taking thence his capitall Enemy upon the Eve of the execution (which Perolla had done by surprize, & by the assistance of a few resolute Freinds he had in Salapia who were all disguis'd as well as He,) without abandoning himselfe to an excesse of choller, which made him vtter things vnworthy his Place and Reputation: Neither for two dayes together could those which had most intimacy & power with him obtaine of him to appeare in publique, or so much as to take sufficient nourishment to preserve Nature, Nor had his despaire bin so soone vanquisht had not his officers enguadg'd themselves, not only to finde out the offenders, but the Prisoner too, if he would publish a Proclamation, which might promise large Rewardes to those which should effect either; upon which the Carthaginian set forth a Manifest of this Tenore. Were not ingratitude a Crime of so high a Quality, that nothing can be of a higher than to pardon it, That same clemency which induced us heretofore not only to forgiue Blacius but restore him to his Estate, might haue now againe extended it selfe to him: But our aboue specified principle, and his vnparalleld treachery makes him so vnfit for a repetition of Mercy, that 'twould lose that name and turne to injustice were it conferr'd on him, who was not contented to be guilty himselfe, but hath so inuolu'd others in his offences, that he ha's (in having forc't our Prisons by his Complices (asmuch violated the publque justice as his priuate enguadgements. These great wrongs done to the Carthaginian Empire through me their Minister are well merited if endur'd, which to auoyde, I hereby solemnly protest before the Gods: by the Glory of Carthage: and my dead Fathers memory: that whatsoeuer Person shall reveale where the perfidious Blacius is conceal'd, or who were the Contriuers, Causers, or Actors of his liberty, shall haue any one thing that the said party can desire  & wee can graunt, and receiue besides some such other marke of our fauour, that all Men shall knowe, wee are asmuch concern'd in rewarding of fidelity, as in punishing the want of it. the Gods (who would not let Blacius enjoy that liberty he had bin so vnthankefull for to the Bestower of it) was the cause of his discovery, but two dayes after he had relisht the Blessing of Freedome, he lost it againe by a Squadron of Souldiers who violently breaking open the Doores, went so directly to a secret Vault where he had conceal'd himselfe, that it manifested their search for him proceeded from their knowledge  & not from their suspitions; from thence they conuey'd him bound in Irons (and with words as ill to be digested as their vsage) to Hanniballs owne Lodgings, where a Guard of Barbarous Affricans newly come from Carthage were set over him, who no more vnderstood the Roman Languadge, than what belong'd to humanity. For Hanniball, you may (in some sorte) guesse at his joy by what his trouble had bin, But for my parte, I was so drown'd in sorrow, that when you can immagine the highest operation of Greife, I can truely affirme mine did make that good. And indeed when I consider'd my vnfortunate Father in the hands of those whose fury would not be quencht but with his blood: and that Perolla's vsage made me esteeme it as high a sinn to enguadge him in any further attempt for Blacius releife, as my ignorance where he was made it imposible to send to him, I found in my iudgement and duty such strong arguments for sorrowe, that I had no way better merited the misfortune than not to have deplor'd it in the sublimest degree. In the meane while the cruell Carthaginian, to avoyde all accidents, and to hasten the satisfaction of his Revenge, caus'd my Father the next day to be brought with ignominious cruelty, to a Scaffold he had erected in the Allarme-place, and aswell to avoyde those Tumults which the Salapians Affection to Blacius might raise, as to satiate his Eyes with his Enemy's blood, he had rais'd another scaffold nere the first, & there waited on by his Guards, he intended to become a Spectator of that Execution of which he had bin the Iudge. Whilst these things were performing in publique, an ancient Freind of Blacius's came to visite me, and to give me that consolation my duty and Affection so aboundantly wanted. After some discourses of a nature fitt for the subject, I was very inquisitive whether the Revealer of my Fathers retirement was not yet found out? To which he answer'd me, that though he had declin'd no wayes immaginable for that discovery, yet his endeavours had bin fruitlesse, but (he continu'd) though I cannot tell you the offender, yet I can (I am confident) shew you the Cause of the offence, and thereupon pull'd out a Coppy of that Proclamation I even now acquainted you with. Though my greife were of a quality which hardly permited my Eyes to doe any thing but weepe, yet (as the Gods would have it) I stopt a while their employment, to reade that Fatall Proclamatio, which assoone as I had ended, I reflected upon some words in it that I thought might prove of great advantage to me, & immediately after asked this charitable Freind, whether he thought the execution were yet done? to which he answer'd he was cofident it was not, for just then he came from the place where it was to be perform'd (his ancient Freindship rendring him vncapable of seeing such a Spectacle) where some of the Assistants had told him, the vsuall Ceremonies that are practic'd in such Cases would take up at least an hower, which was not yet halfe expir'd. I receiu'd this assurance with exceeding joy, and immediatly conjur'd him to conduct me to the cruell Hanniball, who he had told me was an Assistant at Blacius Tragedy. The good old Man would have disswaded me from seeing an object which would but augment my Greife, but I begg'd that favour of him with such earnest words and expressions that at last he yeelded to me, but it was so long e're I could vanquish him, that what he design'd for a proofe of his Care, had like to have produc'd a strange and contrary effect. For just as I came vnder the Scaffold, I perceiv'd my poore Father preparing himselfe for the fatall stroake with a courage which render'd him vnworthy of it: so sadd a spectacle made me hasten to Hanniballs seate, where at last I came, and with a Countenance more suitable to my resentment than condition, I presented my selfe unto him, and told him, Sir, I beseech you command a suspension of Blacius death, till I have acquainted you with some tings that may perhaps induce you to pardon him. The Carthaginian (who then consider'd nothing but my Sexe and motion) with a looke as barbarous as his Country, reply'd, Woman, th' offences of that Traytor are too-transcendent to expect a pardon for any thing thou canst reveale, thou mayst well therefore spare thy selfe a labour which will prove altogether fruitlesse. Then turning about he commanded some of his Guards to carry me downe againe. At that cruell order I flung my selfe at his Feete, and embraceing his Knees, I thus continu'd; I am (Sir) come to invoake that Iustice which has hither to made you as famous as your successe, and will not stirre from this posture till you assure me I shall not be deny'd it. (Those few words I spoke so lowde, & so distinctly, that most of those Salapians which were neere the Scaffold heard them, which puting them in hopes that it might be something that would conduce to Blacius advantage (whome I told you they extreamly lou'd) they cry'd out to Hanniball, Heare hir, Heare hir, which voyces (as is common in a Croude) were seconded by those that neither vnderstood the cause nor the approvers of that motion. The Carthaginian findeing the Cry so pressing & vnanimous forbadd his Guards to medle with me, who were already begining to force my hold, and not only enjoyn'd the suspension of the execution 'till I had done speaking, but told me I might be as confident of his doeing me right as of Blacius death, than which nothing the Oracles did tell could be more certaine. Sir (I continu'd) you will soone finde how great a Confidence I have of your justice, since my relyance on it makes me offer my Life into your Power, who am the vnfortunate Daughter of this Blacius, that it seemes ha's offended you in such a degree as nothing but his blood can be your reparation; in pursuance of which resolve you were pleas'd vnder sacred oathes when his Prison was forc't (and thereby your revenge frustrated) to publish, that whosoever would reveale unto you who were the Contrivers, Causers, or Actors of his Liberty, should have graunted any one thing the said party could aske that was in your power: this Proclamation which I here present you is my witnesse, & the assurance you are inviolate in your enguagements, has brought me to discover unto you who is the offender that has so exceedingly transgrest your Lawes; but before I disclose this secret I must begg a reitteration of that assurance, which to induce you to with the lesse reluctancy, be pleas'd to receive mine, that the same minuit you confirme your first enguadgement, I will put into your power the crimminall Person which procur'd my vnfortunate Father his short liberty, so that the same action which makes you satisfy your word, will give you the power to satisfie your Revenge too. All those which could heare my request gave their approbation to it by a lowd shoute, for they car'd not upon whose ruines they built Blacius deliverance, & Hanniball who was alwayes as ambitious of Glory as of Revenge, repeated and confirm'd the oathes and promises of his Proclamation, which being finisht, I thus continu'd. Since by a generosity which I ever expected from so great a Prince, you have silenc't all those doubts my owne costant vnhappinesse & not any suspitions of your virtue did create, I shall boldly acquaint you, that your justice receiv'd that affront from Izadora, and though my Sexe exempted me from actions of that nature, yet by my Prayers and letters to a young Roman Gentleman I rais'd that power which cast you into so great disorders, and for the punishment of which, you have made such vnlimited promises. Thus Sir I have satisfyed my enguadgement, not only by acquainting you who commited the offence, but by putting the offender into your hands: And now I shall expect as punctuall a performance from you. Then, as I was beginning to make my request, the Carthaginian, who suspected by my resolution that it would be Blacius Life (wherein he was not deceiv'd) suddenly started up, and with a furious looke told me: If thou art so madd as to begg thy Fathers Life for this discovery, in expectation afterwards that thy Sexe will induce me to pitty thee, know, that thy Cryme will make me passe bie all considerations, and raise a fury which by all the Gods nothing but thy destruction will appease; this I acquaint thee with that thou mayst owe thy death to thy wilfullnesse and not to my resentments, which I tell thee once more, will prove so severe, thou wilt soone repent thou e're didst raise them; but if thou wilt yet decline that Request, thy Sexe and relations, will invite me to pardon what I know I ought to punish. Sir (I reply'd, nothing terrified at these Threatnings) I desire not to be oblig'd to your Mercy but your Iustice, neither can I lose my life more gloriously than for him that gave it me: My duty in this case is most predominant, and I know nothing man make me more worthy of death than now to avoyde it; therefore (Sir) I conjure you by those Gods you have invoak't: by that Empire which derives it's greatest Glory from your virtve, and by that Father whose memory you ought to reverence were it only for giveing the world so great a Conqueror. At the ende of these words I heard a voyce which stopt me from proceeding any further by saying hold, hold Izadora, be not vnjust to be generous, nor accuse your selfe of a fault, which if it be one, I (by your owne confession) am only guilty of it. This voyce (which I too-soone knew was Perolla's) made me turne about, where I immediatly sawe my generous Freind breaking through Hanniballs Guards that would have stoppt him (among whome he had stay'd a while, where he had heard all that had past,) and flinging himselfe at his Enemy's Feete told him. Sir, You have bound yourselfe by obligatios too-strong to leave me any suspition that you will not performe your enguagement to him that shall reveale who was Blacius's deliverer; and therefore I shall make no scruple to acknowledge that it was I, and the reward that I expect for this discovery, is, that you will suppresse all those cruell thoughts you have taken up against the faire Izadora, who through an eccesse of duty condemnes hir selfe to free hir Father. You that have bin just Sir to your Enemyes, will not now I hope be the contrary to your selfe, especially when the subject you are to employ your virtue on merits adoration sooner than Pardon, and whose only Crime is hir Charity. Insteed then of so vnfitt a victim to appease your fury, I offer you that Perolla who had at Capua depriv'd you of Life if his Sword had prou'd the more fortunate, & had not his Fathers Teares & dissimulatio preserv'd you: Who at Pettely rais'd his reputation by the destruction of 10000 Affricans; Who at Cassilinum made you send blankes where you had deny'd any conditions; Who by the destroying of 25000. of your Allyes & Souldiers forc't from you the Samnites, Lucanians, & Appulians; Who tooke that Cassilinum by storme, which you only wonne by Fammin; In a word, I present you that Perolla who was not only content to offend you in all these perticulers, but came even into your Head-Quarters, and in the Center of your Army broke open your Prisons, kill'd your Guards, restor'd your capitall Enemy to his freedome, and was now come to have stoppt the progresse of your Revenge upon him by owning the action, and by tyeing you (vnlesse you would violate your faith) to give me his Life for the Reward of this discovery, which I had too effected, had not his generous Daughter by hir owne confession, necessitated me to employ that Petition for hir safety which I had design'd for hir Fathers. Gods! into what confusions did this resolute acknowledgement cast me in to? That death which I was prepar'd to suffer appear'd farre more supportable than this action of Perolla's, for it reduc't me either to employ my request for my Fathers, & so lose my Frinds Life; or if I preseru'd Perolla's I must lose Blacius's, & that which was an aggravatio to this misery, was, that by what was done already, I was necessitated to survive the losse of one of them, vnlesse I would prove my owne executioner; Alas how sadd a conflict had I betwixt my duty and my Affection? Nature pleading for the one, and Gratitude for the other. What, (said I to my selfe) wilt thou destroy thy Father to save his Enemy? wilt thou not preserve that Life that gave thee thine? wilt thou satisfy thy debts with the Fathers blood, and shall the Tyes of Freindship be more prevalent than those of Nature? But on the other side, shall the name of Father make thee act that which will render thee vnworthy that relation? shall that breath which even now Perolla gave thee be employ'd to save anothers life by the ruine of his? Vnfortunate Izadora! hast thou no way to performe thy duty but by a Murther? & hast thou no way to performe thy gratitude but by a Paricide? must the satisfactio of thy gratitude be the ruine of thy Father? & must the satisfaction of thy duty be the losse of thy Freind? must to be gratefull and vngratefull prove an equall cryme? and must the paying of one debt render thee vncapable of paying the other? I take the Gods to witnesse that I would joyfully have put an ende to this fatall dispute by that of my Life, and have embrac't that Fate with a satisfaction equall to that of Martirs, who know their punishment is but the way unto their Glory: but the Tyme was so pressing that I was necessitated to spend what remain'd, not in complaints but resolutions, therefore I thus continu'd: Perolla came to preserve Blacius, though my vnfortunate duty made him change his designe: and that Generosity which once made my Father to esteeme his life his Misfortune, because his Enemy conferr'd it on him, though only by his Courage, will make a repetition of that favour create a higher trouble in him, when the purchace of his safety is his Enemyes voluntary death; his virtue doubtlesse will make him decline an obligation where what makes him recive it deprives him of all power to expresse his resentments for it: 'Tis but just too that that life which has so often preserv'd Blacius's should now be preserv'd by his, Yes yes Izadora, let Perolla finde his safety from one of that Family in which he hath hitherto found his Misery; act now thy Fathers parte, and upon the score of his virtue performe that for Perolla whose effects may demonstrate their cause, and let him finde, now thou art in Blacius roome, that that cruelty thou didst condemne in him thou wilt not practice for him, & in this one action shew what they Fathers resentments should be, and what thine owne are: Then when this debt is discharg'd, satisfy thy owne as generously, and by ending thy Life with his that gave it thee, convince him and the World, that as thou valu'st thy life short of thy duty, which should'st thou any longer enjoy would bring that truth in question, & make that relish of selfe-interest which is of a contrary quality. But alas (I continu'd) how will Perolla resent this proceeding? hee'l alleadge that what thou term'st Gratitude is Cruelty, that the way thou tak'st to save his Life is the certain'st meanes to lose it, and that in steed of repaireing Blacius's injuries thou art more injurious farre than he. These and a world of such, thy Freind will object against thee, to which thou hast noe reply, but that thy Fate having inviron'd thee with excesse of Miseries, thou electest those that to thy judgement are the least, & that thou hadst rather dye by acting what may merit his esteeme than live in a contrary vnhappinesse. Whilst I was thus debating, and had fixt upon this resolution, Perolla was all the while conjureing Hanniball to observe his promise, and to make him the object of his cruelty, so he made me that of his Iustice, and in order to this told the Carthaginian such reasons that I apprehended nothing more than he would finde his destruction in his Eloquence, and so raise his Enemy's fury, that he would sacrifice the violations of his oathes and Faith to his Revenge. In this feare I interrupted him from proceeding by addressing my selfe in these termes to the Carthaginian. Sir, if I have bin thus long silent you will I hope pardon it when you know, that a dispute betwixt Gratitude and Nature was the occasion, in the end the first has bin victorious, but to make it so I was necessitated to act my Fathers parte, who I know is too-generous to let Perolla suffer for him, when by his owne sufferings he may hinder his, and 'twere too-much wrong to the generosity of Perolla's action not to let it instruct my Fathers to an immitation of it. These words too-fully inform'd my Freind of my intentions to let him permitt my proceeding any further, which he hinder'd by leaveing Hanniball, and by prostrating himselfe before me, where assoone as his disorder would permitt him he cry'd out, Ah Madam, doe not I beseech you by so vnjust a victory blemish your virtue, nor make me so wretched as to finde my misery in that which perhaps you intend as an Argument of your Affection, to preserve your Fathers and your Life, nay your Fame too, are causes too-glorious to deplore any effects which may proceede from them: doe not then enuy me a death by which I shall alwayes live, and by loseing only an vncertaine being obtaine an Eternall one. If I had not (I reply'd) taken up this resolution, that which you doe to suppresse would have created it, & in this fresh proofe of your virtue I finde a greater invitation to continue than alter my intentions: Blacius would live more miserable with such a debt than he can dye by paying it, and I cannot deplore his destiny which makes that Life (which euen now was to be an oblation only to Hanniballs fury) to prove a sacrifice to Gratitude. If (said Perolla) the payment of that Gratitude be addrest to me, I take all that's holy to witnesse, I shall finde in the designe only, a larger and more pleasing payment than in the action: Alas Madam consider too I beseech you, what all mankinde will say of you, they will (doubtlesse) condemne that virtue which has bin hitherto their admiration, and that which you thinke will raise their esteeme will absolutely supprsse it; besides, if you proceede in your designe, 'twill be so farre from hindering that it will but hasten my death; doe not then I beseech you force me through despaire to spill that blood which now may be shedd for a subject that out-weighes the losse. I shall finde (I reply'd) in your silence a stronger inducement to obey you than in your words, especially if they be of this nature, and for your apprehension of my prejudiceing in this action that litle virtue I possesse, I have fixt upon a resolue shall still preserve if not increase it, and I have so order'd all things, that your last declaration is now my only trouble, which forces me to make use of that power you have so often assur'd me I have over you, to begg, and if that be not sufficient to command you, by our passions which have bin as pure as great, and by all other conjurations that are most powerfull, whatsoever happens to me, use noe violence upon your selfe, nor leave this Life 'till the Gods doe call you to a better; this I implore with the more earnestnesse, because posterity shall judge of your Love by your obedience. Then without staying for his answer, (whose quality I read in his amazement) I went to Hanniball, & having lay'd open all the most pressing termes. I could compose to illustrate the vnworthinesse of a violated enguagement, I conjur'd him as a recompence of what I had reveal'd, to give Perolla his Life and liberty; who having follow'd me & heareing my request, detesting to derive his safety from a Cause he esteem'd in me so vnnaturall, thus spoke to the Carthaginian. By a true confession (Sir) how Blacius was releiu'd I am confident you finde no other had a hand in it but I, at least Izadora had not, who was so farre from either contriving or knowing it that when I presented him to her shee was weepeing him for dead, and admir'd asmuch at his deliverance as he himselfe did. As for that Letter shee alleadges which was the cause of his Liberty, I protest by all the Gods, it commanded me only to make use of the Consulls favour for Blacius redemption by offering some Lybian Prisoners, or for a suspension of his Death by threatning all those he had to follow his Destiny, so that shee was no more the Cause than the Effect of her Fathers freedome; Neither can shee pretend any title to the benefit of your Proclamation by discovering who was the Actor, for when I brought Blacius to hir, I was so cover'd with Armour that shee could not possibly know me, and as an argument of this Truth shee call'd me a Roman, when as yet I never sawe Rome and had my birth in this Citty, therefore (Sir) none but I has any interest in your Manifest, which obliges you noe lesse to preserve in violate your vowes and promises than to punish those which have offended you. Ah Sir (said I, flinging my selfe at his Feete) I hope you are too-judicious not to distinguish betwixt an accusation which proceeds from Generosity & one which proceeds from Guilt, and consequently not to impute this of Perolla's to one of the first quality, but yet lest you should want light to see so much virtue, I beseech you reflect upon whose Sonne he is, and you will finde in his extraction causes to inuite him rather to destroy Blacius by the hazard of his owne Life, than to save him by a certaine losse of it. Yes (Sir) I blush in his behalfe to acknwledg that the litle Beauty & virtue which the Gods have given me, converted his inclinations, & made him cherrish what he would otherwise have destroy'd, so that I am apparently the cause of that freedome which created your resentments: besides I have a title to my request by discovering who was the actor; For as to that allegation, that I was weeping my Fathers losse when he presented him to me, I may truely answer, my Affection had as large a share in those Teares as my duty, for I could not reflect upon Blacius danger & Perolla's Courage, but it was impossible to retaine them, & though indeed at his comeing into my Chaber he was cover'd with Armes and blood, yet his Gallantry discover'd what his vnkinde Armour would have conceal'd, and in his Actions I found as great an assurance that it was Perolla, as I could have had in seeing his Face; So that my calling him Roman proceeded not from my ignorance but my feares, for I was inform'd after my Fathers rescue such strict Guards were plac't about the Citty that I apprehended my generous Freind was not yet gotten out of it, so that if by any misfortune he fell into your power, I would not (by precisely acquainting you who he was) have given you so great an accession to that hatred you had already contracted for him; besides, I might aptly enough call him a Roman, his Inclinations and Actions having alwayes bin for that Empire. Thus (Sir) have I cleerely demonstrated the interest I have in your enguagement, which gives me the confidence to conjure you by these Teares, and by that Word which you have hitherto so religiously obseru'd, give Perolla that Life and Liberty he would so meritoriously have lost, which is the Petition I humbly make for my discovery: neither can you satisfy that request he has alredy made you, without yeelding to mine too; for that Life he has begg'd is so vnited to his, that it cannot admitt of a different Fate. To which Hanniball reply'd, Madam, Perolla may with reason be credited since 'tis not likely he would disclaime a Truth which would save his Life, and therefore as I have bin just to him in granting his desires for you; so permitt me now to be just to my selfe by sacrificeing an Offender, who is not only contented to be so, but glories in it, and out-braves my Iustice. Yes Sir (said Perolla) since you have sav'd the faire Izadora; inflict on me all the Torments your Revenge & fury can inspire you with, & I will embrace them with more joy than they are impos'd, nay comend that justice which by my sufferings exempts the perfectest Creature from indureing any. This generous reply so incenst the barbarous Hanniball, that he Commanded his Guards to binde Perolla, and carry him to receive a Death whose Torments might be as great as his Crime. The Guards at those barbarous orders advaunc't to seize upon Perolla, who perceiveing their intentions went halfe way to meete them, and holding out his Armes told them, here here Souldiers, obey your Generall, & binde up these Armes which when they were at liberty were asmuch his Feare, as now they are his satisfaction, & which yet (were I dispos'd to sell my Life) might make him tremble in the midst of you; but I will not oppose that in which I finde my Glory. Those words he spoke with so furious a looke, that though vnarm'd, and inviron'd with his Enemyes, yet it struck such a dampe into their hearts, that their trembling was the greatest proofe they were alive. But Perolla instantly disarming himselfe of all his fury, with an humility great as my Greife, kneel'd at my Feete, & told me, The Gods shall be my witnesse (Madam) that the only thing which made me cherrish my Life was out of a hope that it might prove serviceable to you, & now it is so fortunate not only to save you, but pardon me if I say so, to keepe you too from a staine which might blemmish all your other virtues, I resigne it with more Ioy then I kept it; but yet I must confesse when I reflect upon our separation, I finde a strong aversion to it, and am forc't to runn for my consolation to the necessary Causes of it. Must then (I reply'd) interrupting him with a shower of Teares) must then the vnequall'd Perolla have so hard a Fate that he findes his cosolation in the distructio of my felicity? vnjust heaven! who will ever adore Freindship when it turnes to be the ruine of him that possest it in the highest Perfection. Ah Madam (said he) call me rather your Votary than your Freind, and then you neede not feare this president will prejudice Posterity, for men sooner adore then decline a Deity by the example of a Martyrdome. But Madam, you may convert my trouble into my felicity, by permitting this voluntary death to preserve me alive in your esteeme, which will be a nobler existence, and render me an object fitter for your joy, than Teares. You shall not only have my esteme (I reply'd) but my Company: since 'tis a greater misery to outlive the losse of so much virtue, than to dye with it. But Sir (said Izadora) speaking to Spartacus) perhaps I make the relation only of these accidents as tedious and troublesome to you, as they themselves were to us: But I will repaire that fault by contracting the sequell of our Adventures. To which my Prince reply'd, Madam, If I am in any trouble, it only proceeds from sympathizing in those disasters you were falen into, & the difficulties I finde in your being deliver'd out of them, of which I am so impatient, and concern'd, that I shall begg you hence-forward to beleive, that as long as you prosecute your Story, you will asmuch oblige me, as by interrupting it you will doe the contrary. Izadora, with an action which testify'd hir acknowledgement, thus continu'd her relatio. I will obey you (Sir) and it may be in my following Discourse, you will finde that our perplexities were cur'd by as strange an accident as that which created them; For Hanniball all this while continu'd in a deepe silence which I attributed to his being a Iudge, rather than a Lover, but the Gods who magnify their power by produceing great effects from small Causes, made us finde in this poore beauty the redresse of those disorders which it had occasion'd; For at the first, when I presented my selfe unto the Carthaginian, I was (as my condition requir'd) all vayl'd, & continu'd so 'till Perolla's cruell Gallantry forc't me to vncover my Face, in which Hanniball fancy'd as many charmes as it wanted, and by the helpe of his owne immagination, so abundantly supply'd the vnkindnesse of Nature to me, that in his wounds wee found our remedy. And truely for it to vanquish any heart was strange, but to captiuate Hanniballs, who hated our Sexe asmuch as he did the Romans, and to divest him too, of his fury and Revenge, appear'd so great a Miracle, that had not some visible effects bin the witnesse of that Truth, I had found in my imperfections too-many Arguments too have doubted it; & without question 'twas such Passions as his, that made Love be painted blinde; but many that stood by & were not so inguadg'd as I was, obseru'd at first that which I noe way suspected or perceiv'd, 'till Hanniball who found Perolla was asmuch his Ryvall in Love as in Glory, after having layde downe all those motives he esteem'd most prevalent to induce me rather to employ my request for my Father, than my Freind, perceiving me so vnshaken in my resolves, & so pressing in my Teares, & Prayers, and guessing at my disposition by his owne, which harden'd it selfe by opposition, at last when the Guards were carrying away the Generous Perolla, he told me, Madam, If I have labour'd to prove you had noe title to my Proclamatio, 'twas only to shew you that you had a power over me from your selfe greater than you can derive from thence & that you may command upon the score of your Beauty, that which you only begg by virtue of my Manifest. Alas (Sir) I reply'd) I am too- well acquainted with this vnfortunate Beauty, to beleive it can have so high an influence on so great a Conqueror, pardon me then if I dare tell you, I shallbe diffident of its power, vnlesse I am convinc't of it by a demonstration? If you suspect (said he) that which carryes its authority with it, and if you can doubt that Truth which Hanniballs captivity does witnesse; command me any other Tryall, & you shall finde in my obedience how great a wrong you have done the faire Izadora: So high a Civility (I answer'd) merits a proportionate returne, and therefore I shall employ that power you give me for your owne aduantage, and only begg you to be just unto your vowes, by giveing Perolla his Life. Madam (said Hanniball) though in saveing him, I shall preserve (by what I have observ'd) as great an opposer of my felicity as of my Conquests: and thereby too, create as many Enemyes as Souldiers in my Army, Yet I will observe your orders. Yes Madam, I give Perolla's life to your Commands, and I give you Blacius's without them, who for having bestowed so great a Perfection on the world, merrits rather my esteeme than Revenge: my zeale to your service stayes not in that dull method of only obeying what you Command, it layes hold on that which it thinkes is your Will without the reveling it. I could not have the patience to let him proceede, his Words and actions were too-generous to delay my acknowledgments for them, which I exprest (prosterate at his Feete) in the most moveing and humble manner I was capable off. I will not Sir (said Izadora) trouble you with the repetition of them, though they were so satisfactory to him to whom they were addrest, that as an acknowledgement of it, he went immediatly himselfe, vnbound both Blacius and Perolla, and presented them to me, with an humility so farre beyond his practice, that the standers by, admir'd asmuch as I was pleas'd at it. But to obscure this joy, some of Pacuvius's Freinds seeing the danger his generous Sonne had bin in, went to his house to informe him of it, (for he out of gallantry would not be present at his Enemyes Death, though he had Hanniballs example to authorize that action). As soone as he had notice of it, he went with so great haste to the place of Execution that those which sawe it thought that his Affection and not his hatred was the cause of it. The Crowde about the Scaffold was so great, that it was with much difficulty and with an often repeating of his name (to which all pay'd a deepe respect) that he gott at last to Hanniball, and it was just at that instant, that the Carthaginian had vnbound Perolla and given him to me. Pacuvius was suddenly informed of all that had hapned, which every one assur'd themselves would render him a large sharer in the generall Ioy: but alas he soone put them out of that beleife by thus speakeing to Hanniball. I were (Sir) vnworthy the Freindship of so great a Conquerour did I value any relation above it, 'tis upon that principle that I have detested Perolla who hates asmuch your Person as your Glory, and if I hitherto conceal'd that horrid attempt against you which he himselfe has now publisht, 'twas not because he was my Sonne, but out of a beleife that I might convert him: for I knew, a Courage which was capable in so greene an Age to attempt so bold and high a designe, was more advantagious to you to be gained, than distroyed; but since that vallour the Gods have given him, has bin imploy'd to ruine what it should have advanc't, I am come to implore your Iustice against one who is asmuch an Enemy to Nature as to Carthage; punnish him for intending your destruction, in a place where not to have sacrifiz'd himselfe for you, had bin as great a Sinn. Yes (Sir) Punnish him for designeing your death, and punnish me in him not only for concealing but likewise for not revengeing it, and let one execution repaire both our Crymes; you see generous Hanniball, how I contemne my owne interest when yours comes in competition with it, which I embrace with such a concerne that I had rather extinguish my family, than continue it by leaving so great a staine upon your justice, & danger to your Person, as the saveing of Perolla will amount unto. Besides Sir shall that Courage, which hitherto found nothing so easy as to conquer, leave the blemish behinde it of having bin vanquisht by the Eyes only of one of your Enemyes? shall the Romans derive their Triumph from a Sexe which never merited higher than your pitty? shall such a pleasing desire as Revenge, and such a virtue as Iustice be supprest by an vnworthy Passion, which like maddnesse, none beleiue they ever were possest with when th're cur'd of it? let not (Sir) I beseech you the cause of your disorders be worse than the effects, but by a generous conquest over your selfe, shew you are capable to vanquish all obstacles, and let your Enemyes in that very action which they esteem'd would prove your shame finde an Argument that you are invincible, for he that can overcome Hanniball, cannot but be thought to doe the like to Rome, and all the World. The Carthaginian who knew no other cause of Pacuvius's hatred to his Sonne then what he had alleag'd, not only upon that accompt excus'd his Passion, and expressions, but reply'd, Had I not already given Perolla's life to the faire Izadora's commands, I now had bestow'd it on Pacuvius's generosity, & finde in what he alleages more cause to suppresse than to create my Revenge; He that could sacrifice the hopes of his Posterity for my Interest, had too much misplac't his freindship if for a returne to it I would not silence a Revenge, especially when the acting it will prove the destruction of so generous a Family, in which my misfortune is the only fault of any one of it; For Perolla wants not virtue, but I the felicity to merit it, & though (he continu'd with a smile) you vpbraide me with being vanquisht; yet I cannot but acknowledge I am more pleas'd in this defeate than with all my former victoryes; I have too, this satisfaction, that I was never conquer'd but by a Sexe which the Gods themselvs could not resist, who if they can for their subjectio produce thus much beauty, they carry their justificatio in the cause of their fault, (if it be one) so that I commit none vnlesse it be one to immitate those wee adore. I will not perticularize all the dispute betwixt them, since it serves but to acquaint you, that Hanniball remain'd vnshaken in what he had done, and then came to me, and told me: I should Madam with the lives of Blacius and Perolla, have given you too their liberty's, were it not that the graunt of the first of these has bin too-great an exasperation to my Army, to increase it at the same time by the last, I will therefore hope for your pardon if I obey you but by degrees, since otherwise I might hazard the loseing of a power which is not so deare to me upon any score as out of a confidence it may serve you; Yet still for your sake, they shall have no other Prisons but their Lodgings, & as soone as I have fashion'd my Officers to approve of their liberty, I shall restore it to them with asmuch joy as I have lost my owne. Though this hard declaration (however moderated both by reasons and Civilities) did extreamely perplexe me, yet I only begg'd him to shorten their sufferings asmuch as might be, and to perfect what had so generously begunn, for I durst not be too-earnest on so tender a subject, lest it might create his suspicions, that my love asmuch as duty occasion'd my solicitations. 'Twas in this sorte, (continu'd Izadora) that we were preferu'd, and truly when you consider all the accidents of this Adventure, you will acknowledge it to be a strange one: For that life I came to sacrifice to preserve Blacius's had bin preserv'd by the sacrificeing of his, & where I thought to have found my Death, I found my safety, but by a way which made it odious to me: Perolla too, who came with the same designe, found the same Fate, & that Sympathy which till then wee both glory'd in, in that occasion was converted to our misfortune: What wee singly might have effected, wee joyntly destroy'd, And my Father by having more Freinds than one, found he had never a one, & which was more intricate, wee both came to lose our selves to save him, and wee both sav'd our selves to lose him, and yet wee ruine our selves all three, for Perolla by begging my life and I his, wee leave Blacius's to the Execution, which made me resolve having so satisfy'd my gratitude, to dye with my Father, as a vindication of my duty, and as my generous freind has often since vow'd unto me, he was determin'd to have borne me company: On the other side, Hanniball to be more certaine of his Revenge, publishes a Proclamation which debarrs him of it, and to end this miraculous day with a greater wonder than any which had happen'd in it, Izadora's beauty by ingendring as great a Passion in the Carthaginian as he had 'till then a detestation for our Sexe, dissolues all our Feares, & makes us returne in tryumph where wee thought never to have return'd againe. For Hanniball with all his Guards, & with th'acclamations of an infinite confluence of people accompany'd me to my Fathers house. But alas (Sir) assoone as Blacius was inform'd how I had declin'd his deliverance to purchase Perolla's, & knowing what I had done, but not what I had resolv'd to doe, he contracted so violent a hatred against me, that doubtlesse I had in the effects of it found my ruine, had not the apprehension of offending Hanniball silenc't his fury, who every day gave me such fresh & high proofes of his Passion, that had my felicity depended on his Affection, I had bin then as happy, as since I have bin miserable. But in that which most of my Sexe would have glory'd, I found my Affliction, for I had given too visible proofes of my affection to Perolla to doubt the Carthaginian was ignorant of it, & consequently, I read my Freinds vnlikelihood of liberty in the losse of his Ryvalls, whose actions too-soone inform'd me, that his denying to give me Perolla's Freedome, proceeded more from his jealousie than any apprehension of distasteing his Army, over which he had so great an Ascendent, that though it were compos'd of sundry nations, and that they often indur'd Miseries as great as their successes, yet they never Mutin'd but thought their sufferings too meritoriously recompenc'd, if in them their Generall might finde his glory. But Sir (continu'd the faire Izadora) to fatisfy my enguadgement and perhaps you in it) I will passe over all those adderesses which Hanniball made me, and only informe you, his Passion grew to such a height, that he declin'd the Conquest of the World to conquer the vnfortunat Izadora, & that Glory which he had thitherto so exceedingly ador'd, he now asmuch vndervalu'd, delivering up the conduct of all Martiall Affaires unto the Generous Maharball, and those Dayes and Nights which he esteem'd misemploy'd, if not projecting some new Conquest, visiting & regulating his Troopes, provoaking and improveing their naturall feircenesse by Orations, & in performing all the functions of an expert Generall, he now had the same opinion of, if not spent at my Feete, in which dejected posture, he often vow'd he tooke more satisfaction than in his former Tryumphs. But for my perticular, I may justly professe, if I deriu'd any contentment from his expressios & submissios, 'twas only in seeing by so strong an experiment, that my Constancy was immoveable; I say so strong an experiment, for Hanniball was a Prince capable to infuse a Flame into the coldest heart, for he had a looke so spirituall and full of vivacity, that no effeminate Beauty was comparable to it, his Person and shape were nothing dissonant to his Face, (which had not then receiv'd the blemish of being depriu'd of that Eye which soone after he lost in the Marishes of Ancona) his fashion was majesticke and without constraint, and he was indu'd with so singular an Eloquence, that you would have thought him an Athenian sooner than an Affrican, and rather bred up in those famous Schooles, than in a barbarous Campe. And though Hanniball himselfe when he sawe his Fortune was expir'd, did alleadge in open Senate when he pull'd downe Gisgoe out of the Pulpitt of Orations for enveighing against a Peace then offer'd them by Scipio (whose succeeding Conquests gave him the sur-name of Affrican) that he never knew any way but force to suppresse offenders, yet in a subsequent Speech, he vnfolded such pregnant arguments in so transcending expressions and method, that the Senate soone perceiv'd he wrong'd his Elequence to excuse his passion. His Fortune also was proportionat to his other Qualities being at Fower and Twenty yeares old after the Death of Amilcar and Asdruball his Father and Vncle elected Generall by the vnanimous concurrence both of the Senate and Army; His conquests too, were as early as his preferrment, and he never apprehended a defeate, for his victories had allwayes so litle of fortune in them, that they could hardly prove inconstant. But I feare (said Izadora) that by my confidence of vndertakeing to give you his Caracter, I give you an ill one of him: I will therefore conclude, that he had no fault but an vnconfyn'd ambition which made him embrace any meanes that conduced to his desires, & to conquer whatsoever oppos'd him, he never scrupl'd to sacrifice his virtue to his ends. This truly makes me beleive, 'twas more upon the score of his wilfullnesse than his judgement that he persever'd in his passion for me. But after a long tyme in both our computaions, he for his sufferings (as he term'd them) and I for his importunities, he came one Euening to my Chamber as I had newly done reading a letter of Perolla's which contain'd such passionate expressions for our cruell separation, that they infus'd into me a greife equall to his that writ them; th'impression whereof was so evident at his comeing in that he soone perceiv'd it; and after a Melancholly silence to shew the interest and conformity he had in my saddnesse, he at last begg'd me to pardon him if he presum'd to enquire the cause of it. You may easily (Sir I reply'd) finde it out, when you remember that Blacius is yet a Prisoner. If that he answer'd be the occasion, I shall finde my satisfaction in your disorders, haveing the power to redresse them, & to cofirme you in this truth, from this instant I declare him free: But Madam (he continu'd (interrupting that returne I was about to make him for so transcendent an obligation) may not I feare your Love has as great a share in your melancholly, as your duty? That freindship (I reply'd) which I pay Perolla, is too-pure to be deny'd, and he has done so many things for the preservation of him to whome I owe my duty, that without an offence to it, I may give him (as an acknowlegement) a share in my saddnesse. Call you that Madam (said Hanniball) but an acknowledgement, which made you on the Scaffold preferre his life before your Fathers? I did not (I reply'd) preferre him, but Gratitude before my Father. Ah Madam (he answer'd) take heede of what you say, for if you so much vndervalue your selfe, as to beleive any Services can deserve your Gratitude, you will perhaps give me a title to that by justice which I never could expect but from your Mercy: For Perolla when he sav'd Blacius the first time, knew not who he was, and the second time did it to obey his Mistris, and offend his Enemy; But I not only knew, that in preserveing him I preseru'd my mortall'st Enemy and did it without any inducement except a beleife that it might be pleaseing to you, but also sav'd that Perolla too, for whome you would have sacrific'd not only your Father but your selfe, & by which I found, I cherrisht my owne Distruction: but my obedience was too-perfect to stand upon Reason, or if it did, it found nothing which more deseru'd that name, than to obey you. Yes Madam, I consider'd my Distruction too-glorious to deplore it, if thereby I might settle your Contentment; judge then (faire Izadora) if I have not cause to say, that there is some Disparity betweene our Services, & whether I may not upon that beleife expect, that you will at least commiserate the captivity of my minde, asmuch as of his body, who certainly is vnworthy his felicity, if he can finde roome to entertaine a greife, having the highest preservative from it the blessing of your Affection. Sir (I reply'd) those obligations you have conferr'd on me, are of so transcendent a Nature, that to thinke to define, is to injure them; and if they have any defect it proceeds only from their greatnesse, which by a necessity of ingratitude casts me into as high a Misery as they tooke me out of: Yes generous Hanniball, I can truely say, that when I reflect upon your obligations, and finde not only a want of power but of hope to make them a proportionate returne, I am struck with a Melancholly equall to the joy I resented when you conferr'd them on me; and perhaps I should not lye if I profest that these thoughts are as large a Cause of my saddnesse as any other. Would to the Gods Madam (said he) that your will to oblige me were but equall to your power, I could soone then exchange my feares for joyes in the very contemplation whereof I quickly lose my selfe; yes faire Izadora, those that gave you the power to command, have given you too, the power to reward, and I should finde in an Hymeneall Crowne, an abundant recompence for my services & sufferings; this vnion should give the World Peace, or you the World, which is a farre easier Conquest than that of Izadora, whome I durst promise to make Empresse of that by Armes, which by virtue shee has so just a title to; for if only to obey the Carthaginians & to satisfy my owne inclinations, I have already so farre proceeded, shee cannot doubt but to justify hir choyce & to merit the glorious title of hir Souldier, I would performe miracles almost as great as the cause of them. Though the words of this declaration were very confident, yet the declaration it selfe was not, for Hanniball maugre his high Courage, was all the while it lasted, as pale as guilt, & made it with so great a trembling, and constraint, that he had asmuch of my pitty, as of my anger; but after a litle silence, which rather shew'd my resentment than irresolution I told him, My apprehensions of being vngratefull, were now I perceive too-well grounded, For that you doe me the honor to mention, is not in my power to graunt; I know this confession to a Prince lesse generous might produce a cotrary effect than I am confident it will in you, from whome I have receiu'd such memorable obligations, that I had rather have your disesteeme by acknowledgeing a Truth, than continue your favour by a dissimulation which would render me vnworthy of it: That Heart which is belowe the great Hanniball is so given to another; that were it revocable, 'twere upon that score, if not on any other, vnfitt for your acceptance; for I must be vnconstant to be kinde, and I know you have a greater passion for virtue, than for Beauty. Alas Madam (he reply'd fetching a deepe sigh) why did you make such haste to give your selfe away, and knowing the influence of your Eyes, which would create as many Servants as beholders, why did you prove vnjust to one of them, to be the like to all the rest? for, to give all to the happy Perolla is as great an injustice in one extreame, as to reserve none for the residue of your Adorers is in the other. Sir (said I) you may easily perceive the great distinction I place betweene your and Perolla's actions, for by vndertakeing to reward his, I shew at how lowe a rate I value them, & by acknowledging that the impossibility of my satisfying what I owe you is as great as my desires to pay it, I acquaint you with the largenesse of my resentments, and doe perhaps in my, very ingratitude it selfe in some degree prove gratefull. Ah Madam (he answer'd) doe not lessen your power to the increase of your cruelty? nor render my services vncapable of reward, by esteeming them above any? No, faire Izadora, let me not finde my ruine in that which was my duty, and shalbe my ambition? nor let my performances like bubbles increase to nothing? But at last Hanniball, (who perceiv'd that his replyes did rather confirme than lessen my constancy, and that he had vnfortunately taken a tyme which my melancholly made vnfitt for his addresses,) told me; I should be too-partiall to my selfe (Madam,) did I expect to supprsse one flame in you, & create another any way but by perseverance; I will therfore no more importune you with my Passion, nor make use of any other Orators than my services, and sufferings; neither shall I despaire, but by their helpe to vanquish your disdaine, for I finde in my very Feare an ample cause of hope, since the impressions of nature are as firme as those of our owne acquisition, and Perolla by his services and glory having vanquisht your aversion to his blood, it gives me a confidence by the same wayes to produce as high effects, the disproportion being at worst, but equally great. I will goe then Madam, and performe things of such virtue, that you shalbe as vnjust as I am miserable, if you decline my Passion, and the World shall see, if Perolla exceeds me in any thing, 'tis in Happinesse not in merit. Then without staying for any reply, he saluted me with an humility as great as he would have perswaded me his Passion was, and went derectly to his owne house where he immediatly gave Orders to have the next morning his Army ready to move, for he would act some Exployt, which should abundantly repaire his vnaccustom'd idlenesse. This promise gave the generous Maharball as high a contentment as the Effects of it did the contrary to the Romans; but after he had distributed those Orders which were necessary for hastening his Martch, he began to reflect upon the impossibility of successe in his Passion, as long as I had so just and advantagious an opinion of Perolla; he therefore fancy'd, that if he could but create any suspitions in him of my constancy, it might furnish him with the meanes to destroy his, whose perfection he esteem'd it's fault, because it was his owne mifortune. But after he had projected a Million of wayes to accomplish this designe, he esteem'd none so probable as by corrupting Oristes, a Salapian of quallity in whose house Perolla was a Prisoner, and who by his exceeding Civility, & the interest he tooke in all his troubles, had gotten a great share in my generous Freind. This Oristes Hanniball sent for that Night, and having brought him into his Cabinet, disclosed to him there his condition, & desires, but in such pressing words, and actions, that he easily perceiv'd how infinitly the Carthaginian was concearn'd in the accomplishing of them; The Salapian who had some weake principles of virtue, did a longe tyme resist both Hanniballs Prayers and Rewards, yet in the ende that litle generossity he had shew'd, seru'd but to aggravate his offence, for he was vanquisht, & evidens'd thereby he knew his duty, but would not practice it, for he promist the Carthaginia not only to vndertake but to succeede in the designe, which fill'd him with so much satisfaction, that the effects of it were visible next morning when he past vnder my Windowe; for out of Gallantry he made his Army martch through Salapia, & in a military Civility saluted me with all those victorious Ensignes, which never before or since pay'd that homage to any but their Generall; and because those triumphant Troopes appear'd that day by his expresse comands in all their magnificence, I shall not thinke it impertinent to mention their order and Numbers, which though it be a thing out of my Sex'es element, yet I tooke so perticular notice of it then, that I am confident I shall in my relation abuse nothing but your patience. The first divisions consisted of 8000. Numidian Horse leade by the Gallant Maharball, whose Meene was as full of virtve as Courage, and whose actions sufficiently justify'd his Phisiognomy; These Tropes me thought relisht somthing of their Commander, and were gegenerally so well Arm'd and Horst, that they seem'd rather goeing to a Tryumph than a Battell. After these Hanniball appear'd environ'd by a thowsand young Carthaginians which he had elected for his Guards, & follow'd by 40000. Foote, (all Affricans). I must doe him the right to acknowledge, that he had so noble a feircenesse in his Armour, that though I had never seene him, I should yet have taken him for the Generall; and certainly he was no Freind to his good Meene, when he shew'd himselfe out of an Army. These Affricans resign'd their places to three and Thirty great Elephants (all that then were left) which had Towers of Wood upon their Backs, and so not only carryed but fortifyed their Riders. After these folowed 4000. Mules and Horses, the most of them loaden with so many severall engines of Battery, that I admir'd asmuch at the wickednesse as at the ingenuity of Men, which could finde such severall wayes to destroy one another. These were no sooner past but there appear'd 10000. Gaules, 6000. Lygurians, and 4000. Grecians, all lead by Commanders of their owne Nations, and fighting vnder Carthaginian Colours, more for Hanniballs Fame than his Pay; These Squadrons had so warr-like & haughty a Martch, that it shew'd how eager and ambitious they were of Battell. The last divisions consisted of 8000. Horse, fowre thousand of which were men at Armes, and all Gaules, lead by the valiant Britogentrix, and the other fowre thousand were Iberians, vnder the Commands of Mircall and Barmocall, who brought up the Reare of this great Army, which was compos'd almost of all Nations but those it was goeing to Conquer. I must confesse, this sight made me excuse that haughtinesse of which Hanniball was esteeem'd guilty, for who could have bin so much a Philosopher, as not to be prowde of having so many Thousand gallant Men ready to sacrifice themselves at his Command; but my admiration at it was not greater than my feare for the Romans, and that reflection at last lead me to a joy which I shall not scruple to reveale, since if it proceeded from a want of courage, it did not from a want of Love: 'Twas Sir, (Izadora continu'd) occasion'd at Perolla's being a Prisoner, for I could not consider his valour and the endlesse subjects it was to be imploy'd against, but I found my satisfaction in that which had bin my trouble, and was more pleas'd that Hanniball had deny'd me his liberty, than I should have bin in his obedience, for I could no more deplore my generous Freinds sufferings since it procur'd his safety, than I could any mans condition who tooke Phisick, but to be well. I must not omitt to tell you, that every common Souldier of this vaste body carryed a branch of Lawrell, their confidence being so great, that they wore the Reward of victory before they had obtain'd it. 'Twas with this Army that Hanniball martch't first to Tarentum, where though he found a vigorous resistance, yet the valour of the Defendants serued only but to sett off his owne the better, for he carry'd it by storme, & in that action perform'd so much of the Souldier aswell as of the Generall, that he deriv'd his successe asmuch from his Courage as his conduct. I know (continu'd Izadora) the Romans affirme that Nico and Philomenes betrayed that great Citty to him, but I know too, that both of them being kill'd not long after in the beseidgeing of Capua, they seal'd their innocency with their last breath, and vow'd that the Carthaginians Civility in cureing those wounds they had receiv'd in being made their Prisoners, and the Romans ingratitude in termeing their misfortune their Treachery, made them in revenge abandon the Eagles and serve vnder Hanniballs Ensignes; who, though he had taken the Towne, yet the Castle which stood upon the point of the harbour did resolutly defend it selfe, and well it might, for the Carthaginians having no shipps to hinder their releife, every easterly winde the Graecians supply'd it with Men and Victualls; but at last when all Haniballs Engineeres could not finde a way to block it up, he himselfe did, for haveing taken good store of Gallyes in the Key of Tarentum, and not being able by Sea to bring them out of the Harbour, because the Castle commanded all the straights and passages, he caus'd the Gallyes with an admirable celerity and Arte to be putt upon Cartes, & so carry'd them by Lande into the Sea, and in that miraculous manner beseidg'd them round, which the Romans discerning, not long after yealded. I have told you (said Izadora) this perticular, since it never had a precedent, or an immitation, and because it dejected the Senate more than the losse of a Battell, by finding they had to deale with an Enemy whose industry peruerted the very order of Nature, makeing one Element beare the burthen, and doe the office of another. From thence he went into Lucania, where in a blooddy Battell he defeated Marcus Centineus, who publishing alowde, that he lov'd the Senate & his honor too-weell to bring them Newes that his Army was lost, resolutly thrust himselfe into the middst of the Carthaginians, where he found upon the points of a Thousand Swords the cure of that dayes misfortune. From this fatall Feild, he carry'd his victorious Troopes into Apulia, where by a stratagem too-intricate and tedious to be related he reduced the Praeter Fabius's Army, from Twenty, to Two Thousand: But to qualify these high successes he receiv'd advertisement that both the Consulls were sett downe before Capua, and by the celerity of their approaches, had alreaddy so straightned it, that vnlesse he brought the place an immediat releife, it would be past any. These pressing letters made him carry the Warre into Campania, where after he had a litle refresht himselfe, he offer'd the Consulls Battell, who as readily accepted it, for the Romane Empire was then in too-desperate a sicknesse to trye a desperate cure. That day much of those fertile Playnes were moysten'd with Blood, & though Hanniball perform'd all the parts of an excellent Generall and of a vallliant Souldier, yet it was darknesse & not victory which ended the dispute. The next morning assoone as it was light, Hanniball againe drew his Army in Battalia, but the Consulls who had not (by the presedent Dayes losse) Men enough to keepe the Feild & the Trenches too, contented themselves to continue in the latter, so that there by they made his Fortune the more admirable, for he was Conqueror without fighting, because he wonne the Battell the day after it was fought. But after he had by many attempts endeavour'd to releive his Confederates, & found, that though he beseidg'd the Romans, yet that they did the like to the Capuans, the Consulls having both victuall'd & fortifyed themselves suficiently, he resolv'd to effect that by diversion which he could not by force, and therefore past silently the River Vulturnus, and crossing with wonderfull expedition the Countries of the Sidicinians, Attifanians, Cassinians and Fregellans, he in seaven dayes presented himselfe before the magnificent Walls of Rome, and had done it much sooner, had not the Fregellans pull'd downe the Bridge at the River Lyris, and thereby much retarded his martch; & though this was meerely a stratagem of Warre, yet he attributed it to a Gallantry of his Passion, for in a Letter he sent me, he alleadg'd it relisht more of Izadora's Souldier to take Rome than releive Capua. It is not difficult to beleive that the Romans who did feare to heare of Hanniball did much more so to see him at their Gates, especially being follow'd by a tryumphant Army; But for all his vseing such vnimmaginable dilligence, the Senate receiv'd secret advice of his designes. Never Rome was fill'd with so vniversall a Terror as then, no not when the Gaules vnder the valiant Brennus conquer'd all of it but the Capitoll, & when the Forum ranne with streames of the Senates and Patricians blood. This great consternation had noe influence upon any but the People, the Senate still maintaining that gravity and Courage which was their nature asmuch as practice; but at the length the Common feare was well silenct by the arrivall of Fulvius Flaccus, (one of the Consulls that had beseidg'd Capua) who being sent for to defend Rome, was come almost assoone as Hanniball, and brought with him 15000. of the select Legionaries and a thousand choyce men at Armes. That which gave him the happinesse of comeing so opportunely was, not only the tymely intelligence was sent Him, but also passing through Countries that were his freinds, he receiu'd none of those impediments which the Carthaginian mett with. The Senate sent for one of the Consulls to please the People, and but for one, not to please Hanniball, who might have too-much glory'd to have made them neglect their Conquests for their safeties. The Consull Flaccus being inform'd, that the next morning the Enemy intended to storme Rome, resolv'd (with the permission of the Senate) to make a Battell Hanniballs only way to the assault, declaring generously that 'twas not fitt the Empire of the world should fall like a Comon Citty, but if the expiration of it were now arriv'd, 'twere requisite it's Ruine should shew it's greatnesse, and that those which compos'd should dye with it. The day therefore no sooner began to appeare but the valiant Consull drew out his Army, which with those he brought and those Romans that voluntarily came vnder his Ensignes, consisted of 50000. Men. Hanniball on the other side about the same instant drewe his Souldiers out of their Campe, but he admir'd when insteed of seeing the Walls cover'd with his enemyes, he perceiv'd the Feilds were so; but his wonder was soone conuerted into joy to observe that Rome would fall like hirselfe, & that he should have to deale with those upon even tearmes, who he had suspected would give him more trouble to joyne with, than to conquer them; And to lose noe tyme he commanded the Trumpets the Clairons, and all the other Musick of Warre to give the signall of Battell, which no sooner was heard than both those great bodyes began to move with resolution worthy their Quarrell, the one fighting to winne the Empire of the World, and the other to keepe it. But just as they were about to begin that fatall Tragedy, the Sunn (which till then had shone very bright) began to hide it selfe, as perhaps detesting to looke upon so many intended Murthers: the whole face of heaven was in an instant obscur'd with a thick darknesse, the Thunder did hideously grumble: the windes made a noyse as if they had all broaken loose out of their Caves, and the Clowdes melted so fast that many thought the Lightnings had dissolv'd them, & as many admir'd how so much fire could avoyde quenching in so much water: in a word, I cannot better describe the horror of this day, than by the effects it produced, which were that it constrain'd the Consull & Hanniball to returne with their Army's into their severall Campes, for Flaccus too had pitch't his Tents in a great feild some two Furlongs from the Temple of Hercules, lest Hanniballs being before Rome should looke like beseidging it, which none could truly say he did, whilst there was a Roman Army betwixt him and the Citty. But that which afflicted Hanniball asmuch as this miraculous separation, which he then termed but a suspension of his victory, was, an advertisement he received by his Spyes, that the Senate had not only since his comeing sent certaine Companyes with flying Ensignes to the recruit of their Legios in Spaine, but also had sold those very feilds on which he camp't at a higher rate than they were valu'd at before his being possest of them, In revenge whereof he caus'd all the rich Shopps in the Forum to be sold by a publique Cryer. But Sir (said Izadora) that which made the precedent storme so absolutly a wonder, was, that assoone as Flaccus and Hanniball were return'd into their Campes, the day prou'd so very faire, and the Night too that the Carthaginian was prowde with a beleife, that the next visit of the Sunn would vnavoydably decide his Fate; but therein also he was deluded, for the succeeding day was but a perfect repetition of the preceding, aswell for the Miracle, as for the separation of the two Armyes, only the Tyber was with those cataracts of raine so exceedingly swell'd, that she overflow'd hir bankes, and had like to have reveng'd all the Romans losses by the ruine of Hanniballs Army; but he by a tymely care remou'd his Tents to a higher ground, and thereby avoyded an Enemy which he could not resist, I remember I have bin often told that severall private persons in Rome (for the Senate detested to seeme to derive any advantage but from their Armes) perform'd many sacrifices to the Nymphes & Nayades of Tyber, for endeavoring their revenge, and for making Hanniball flye out of his Campe, which never any Romans thitherto had done. I must now generous Spartacus, acquaint you with a particular which few have heard, and fewer have beleiv'd, in which last number I perhaps include my selfe; but yet I shall tell it you, since it is a parte of that story you seeme so much concern'd in: Blacius (according to Hanniballs promise to me) being set at liberty, & vnderstanding of Hanniballs designe upon Rome, and of the continuance of his Passion, commanded me to desire him by the pressing'st conjurations a letter was capable of, to carry his Armes to any other place rather than to the destructio of that Citty where I had my Birth, with this hope, that if my Prayers were successefull it would free Rome from an imminet ruine, & if they were not, 'twould prove a good rise to free me from his addresses, for he abhorr'd an allyance with Hanniball as highly as with Perolla, and detested the Enemy of his Country asmuch as of his family. I immediatly obey'd Blacius, asmuch by inclination as by duty, and sent a Post away with a letter to the Carthaginian, which because 'twas my owne I did not thinke it worthy the remembring: my Expresse came to him in the middst of his fury for these two vnfortunate separations, and of his Resolues the next morning if his Souldiers could not martch, they should swimme to a victory, but assoone as he had read my Letter, he divested himselfe of all his rage, and gave immediate Orders to have his Army the next day readdy to martch away, contenting himselfe (as he gave it out) that he had made Rome tremble, and necessitated the Gods to a double miracle for hir safety (that of the inundations, and that of his not taking hir) But yet to satisfy the Avarice & sufferings of his Souldiers, he lead them the direct way to the Grove of Feronia, where stood a Temple of inestimable Riches, all which he expos'd to their pillage, & from thence return'd me by my Messenger, this answer to my Letter.  like now with his Victory, I should haue said with his Glory, did he not finde more in his obedience than he could in his successe. VVould to the Gods faire Izadora, you could but enjoy as high a contentment in the reception as I doe in the payment of this Duty. I might then haue some hopes that my passion might not proue eternally fruitlesse, and that he who ambitions nothing but your satisfaction, might by incessant impressions of that quality and production, inuite you by an immitation, to reward what you can not but approue.  Colleague Appius Clodius, and the Capuans who had indur'd miseries allmost sufficient for the punishment of their Rebellion, obserueing the Consull was not follow'd by the Carthaginian Army, found it high tyme to thinke upon their securities; In order whereunto they assembl'd the Senate, where after a serious debate, Vibius (vncle to Perolla) perceiveing that the Major parte inclin'd to submitt unto the Roman Mercy, in an excellent Oration, besought them rather to dye by their owne hands, and so robb their Enemyes of the Glory of full Conquest by contributing to their owne ruine, and make Hanniball knowe by so noble a fall, that the preserving of such generovs Freinds, had bin more worthy his Armes, than the takeing of that, which he but attempted; that it was more resembling the auncient splendor of Capua to performe what might rather create the Romans admiration than their pitty, that for his owne perticular, he esteem'd no Fate so badd as to make up a part of Claudius  & Flaccus Tryumph, which was the best condition they could expect by a surrender, therefore all those who were gallant enough to expire with their liberty, he inuited to goe with him, and take their share of a Cupp which should exempt them for ever from the cruelties and vicissitudes of Fortune. After he had finished these words he saluted the Senate with an admirable constancy, and being follow'd by seaven and Twenty Senators, he went directly home, where they all hasted to pledge that fatall health which he began, haveing no feares in their Deaths, but that the Romans should possesse Capua before they were acted. I have told you (said Izadora) this Tragedy, not only because it was the discourse and admiration of the whole World, but also because the cheife actor of it, had so neere a relation to my Generous Freind. The rest of the Senate immediatly submitted to the Consulls, and found from Flaccus, that death with ignominy, which they might have given themselus with Glory. Hanniball to Revenge his dead. Freinds perform'd many great exploytes in the Countries of the Brutians & Lucanians, where he sacrifiz'd to appease their Manes above Tenn thousand Romans, and then the season being vnfitt for action, he return'd to this Citty, and in a Complement to me, declin'd a tryumphant Entry, because the cheifest ornaments of it, were to have bin compos'd of the spoyles of my Country. Masters Commands, they both perceiv'd him comeing towards them, accompany'd with one of the Preists of Venus, who was come to advertise his Superior, that the Sacrifices which are vsually offer'd to appease the incensed Deity, and to breake the Oracles vnaccustom'd silence, only expected his presence to be performed. He immediatly obey'd the Summons though he had much rather employ'd his Tyme in heereing of Symander, whose relations so charm'd him, that it almost darkned his Piety; but that he might returne the sooner to so pleasing an entertainment, he tooke Artabbanes by the hand,  & lead him to be an Assistant to those Ceremonies, which were vnavoydably to be perform'd before he could learne his Fate. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PARTE. THE SIXTH BOOKE. the Propheticall partes of the Victims, assur'd all the Assistants, that the Deity was well pleas'd with their Devotions, but that he could not as yet discover any Maxime in Divination, which might afford a certainty, that within few dayes, the Oracle should be restored to the liberty of speakeing. Artabbans was extreamly troubl'd with this beleife, and the better to entertaine those thoughts it created, he withdrew himselfe into a solitude which that morning he had discover'd, and which was indeede a place fitt to cherrish so deepe a Melancholly as hist it was in a Vally all over-hung with lofty Trees, whose Topps were so interwoven by the helpe of Nature only, that they rather form'd an obscurity than a shade; it was water'd too, with many cleere Fountaines whose sadd murmour seem'd to beare our vnfortunate Lover company, and to have a sence of his Miseries: but this forlorne retirement was so farre from the Temple, that Artabbanes (whose naturall strength was very much impair'd by an internall Greife which by degrees consum'd him) was constrain'd to make use of his Horse to returne thither, where he was no sooner come, than having ty'd him to a Tree, he flung himselfe upon the Grasse, and after a serious reflection on his past Fortunes, and present Condition, he cry'd out, Great Gods! doe you take delight in cruelty, that you enjoyne me to live after a losse which makes my Life my Torment? or are you ignorant that it lyes not in your Power (in this Life) to repaire the Miseries you have cast upon me in it? if not one of these, why did you command me to live, when I had almost found in my Resolutio my cure? & enjoyne me to receive my Fate from this Oracle, on which at the same instant you impos'd an extraordinary silence; if you intended my Ruine, why doe you bring your power in question by not effecting it, and if you design'd my Felicity, why did you take Parthenissa to you? if you were resolu'd upon the former, why did you bestowe on me so great a Heart? and if you meant the latter, why did you give me so great a Constancy. Shall I finde Courage is as high a Curse to me, as it is a blessiing to others? and shall I finde in virtue a greater torment than ever you inflicted for the punishment of vice? Great Gods! (he continu'd, fetching a deepe sigh) I have for all this obey'd you, when it was against my reason, when it was against my inclination, and yet all the reward I begg of you for so painfull an obedience, is, that by a marke of your fury I may receive one of your Love: but if your Thunder be kept for the wicked and not the Vnfortunate, let your Oracle command me to dye, this hand (when you have taken off the impiety) shall be the joyfull Executioner of your sentence, and by one generous blowe send me to that vnion in the other World, which it seem'd you thought me vnworthy of in this. Whilst Artabbanes was in these expostulations, Callimmachus had lead Symander into that walke in which he had begun his relations, and where he desir'd him (with an impatience that manifested his concernment) to prosecute them, which the faithfull Servant willingly vndertooke, and having begg'd Callimmachus Pardon for dwelling so long on a Story, not essentiall to his Princes, which yet he beleiv'd highly worth the Relation, and minded him that he was interrupted at Hanniballs returne unto Salapia, and that he alwayes spoke the faire Izadora's words, thus continu'd hir Adventures. too-much perticulariz'd Hanniballs successe and actions, on which I should not have so long insisted, had he not vow'd to me, they were perform'd more upon the score of Love than Glory, in which last he was ambitious to our Ryvall Perolla, asmuch as Perolla had him in the first. I beleive too, you have not forgott, that when he did leave this Citty, he did not either his hopes or his passion, the first of which was cherisht by Oristes vndertakeing  & promises, who to avoyde being as false to Hanniball as he had bin to virtue, entirely bent himselfe to ruine the perfectest Flame that ever any Lovers were capable of, and knowing, that vice, is never so powerfull as when it assumes the habit of virtue, he resolv'd to take up the name and (for a while too) the actions of a Freind, in which hypocrisie he was so successefull, that he made Perolla his, as sincerely as he was seemingly so to him; and truely he prov'd so excellent a Counterfeict, that his Misfortune had bin as great if he had not reacht his ends, as his fault was in attaining them. In breife, he so enguadg'd himselfe in all my generous Freinds concernes, and so deepely sympathiz'd in his Ioyes, his Feares, and all his other passions, that it was only the worke of tyme to disclose the fallacy: but at last heareing of Hanniballs returne, and knowing that delay in designes of Love, and Glory, are equally intollerable, he began to sowe that seed of jealousie betwixt us, which he was confident would bring him so plentifull a returne; and indeede it was a great Misfortune that the Carthaginian had elected an Instrument so perfect both in dissimulation, and in Wickednesse; for if the Former had bin lesse, his power to doe ill had resembl'd it, and if the Latter had bin so, his will had bin the like; but both concurring together, was a danger whose greatnesse can hardly be equal'd, but to the goodnesse of those Powers which hinder'd it's effect. I tould you Sir that though Oristes knew well what Hanniballs impatience would be, yet he declin'd his attempt 'till a good while after his returne, not doubting but to satisfy him for the delay, by the certainty of the advantage it would produce. In order to this, the same Night he entre'd Salapia, Oristes waited on him, of whome he immediatly enquir'd with an earnestnesse which demonstrated an accession rather than a Diminution of his Passion, what progresse he had made towards the settelment of his felicity: to which the false Agent reply'd, that as yet he had bin but prepareing, what he shortly intended to act & thereupon inform'd him how that he had got so great an Interest in Perolla that he doubted not but to employ it for his certaine Ruine, if at least Hanniball redoubl'd his assiduity towards me, and whatsoever my vsage were, that he would not only put on a Countenance which might relish of satisfaction, but cast out words which might make all the Salapians beleive & talke of the change, which when once divulg'd, & none permitted to visit Perolla but such as would credit & relate what they hear'd, he would so husband that report, that if Perolla's constancy were not his Nature, it must inevitably be ruin'd. Hanniball exceedingly approv'd of this advice, and so admirably acted his part, that not only most of the Salapians beleiv'd I had a reall Passion for him, but also Blacius did so. This great alteration soone flew like lightning thorough the Citty, & at last came to Perolla, whose amazement at it proceeded rather from his finding so many were mistaken in me, than that he himselfe was so. But Oristes who attributed his to the cause he desir'd and not to the true one, came one day to Perolla's Chamber, where after having with great vehemency protested unto him an vnequall'd Freindship, he conjur'd him by it to cast off a melancholy which would rather increase my Tryumph than make me repent my cryme, and that if he were so vnfortunate as yet to have a Passion for one which was so vnworthy of it, and desir'd to reclaime me; he should rather, than constantly continue, seemingly divest himselfe of his flame, and contemne me; for Women like Kings were more concern'd to subdue a Rebell, than to make a new Conquest. I am sorry (Perolla coldly reply'd) that I have an opportunity to place so high a Iustice upon the faire Izadora's constancy, as not to suspect it when Oristes does: But (he continu'd) is it possible that a perfection more apparent than this Callumny can be so vnhappy as to be doubted by men of judgement & of honesty? Ah! vnjust Heavens, why did you establish the Throne of virtue in the Heart, and not in some conspicuous place, where to be virtuous & to be knowne so, had bin the same thing, but perhaps the highest proofe of virtue is vndisturbedly to endure the reproaches of vice, and if goodnesse were visible, our Interests and not our inclinations might make us imbrace it, whereas when it has no witnesse but the Possessor, it is a nobler invitation to it. But Oristes, least you should persevere in your Cryme, know, that Constancy is Izadora's Nature as well as practice, and I having noe title to hir affection, but hir goodnesse, I should be as foolish to doubt the foundation of my felicity, as miserable if it fail'd. I wish (reply'd Oristes) Izadora had a Constancy worthy so noble a Flame, and if this be not the object of my beleife, it shalbe at least of my Prayers. You speake (said Perolla) as if you had still some doubts of hir Passion for me. Would to the Gods (he coldly reply'd folding his Armes & casting downe his Eyes) that mine wear but doubts; (& then vnfolding them, and lookeing up cheerfully againe) but I am to blame (he continu'd) to make you miserable before your tyme, and to let my words be so vnfortunate as to acquaint you with what hir actions will. Ah Oristes (Perolla cry'd out) I conjure you by all the Gods, informe me of your suspitions, and be confident, if I receive any trouble from them, it can proceed only from the knowledge that my Freind has injur'd what he should admire; for in what concernes my perticuler, I am as farre from beleiving shee can be crimminall as shee is from being so; No no Oristes, I beseech you tell me your suspitions, that I may remove them, and that for your good opinion of hir, I may be obliged asmuch to your reason, as your faith; & the sooner to induce you to this, I must tell you plainely, that to be my Freind, and Izadora's Enemy is inconsistent. The wicked Oristes perceiv'd by these generous replyes, that he had vndertaken a taske as difficult, as dishonest, but knowing himselfe too farr enguadg'd to retire, he told Perolla (with a deepe sigh) I had rather renounce all things than the blessing of your Freindship and therefore what I thought to have acquainted you with as an effect of my care, will silence as an argument of my respect; but perhaps Izadora's Flame for Hanniball may tell you a truth which the excesse of your Passion makes me decline to doe. Neither would I have so much as mention'd this, did I not knowe, it is already as publique as true, and consequently that you have heard it. That I have heard it (said Perolla) is not more certaine than that I doe not beleive it, but alas (he continu'd) is it possible that Oristes does? If I did not apprehend (he reply'd) to offend you by acquainting you with my beleife, I should informe you of it, and accompany it with such pregnant reasons as perhaps it might turne to be yours too. I conjure you (said Perolla, hastily) to imparte it to me, for I finde 'tis as impossible to remove your jealousies 'till I know them, as 'twere for you to have any of Izadora if you knew hir. I will then (said Oristes) tell you freely, that not only I beleive shee has given hir selfe to the Carthaginian, but also wonder you doe not: consider (I beseech you) that Inconstancy & Ambition are the Hereditary Vices of hir Sex; That you are a forlorne Prisoner, that your Ryvall is a tryumphant Conqueror which are two extreames that can hardly avoyde creating those two others in your Mistris: Reflect I beseech you upon the difference betweene the immaginary Crowne of Constancy, and the reall one of Empire; For though Hanniball be not borne a King, yet his virtue makes him the distributer of Kingdomes, which is a more glorious power than any that can be deriv'd from Succession, or Birth; Remember also that a Woman is more pleas'd with the power than with the merit of hir Lover, the first being an advantage which shee participats in, but the last, one, which he wholly ingrosses to himselfe. This (said Perolla interrupting him) is the Carracter of some of hir Sex, but 'tis not of Izadora, whose reason asmuch as Nature detests so black a Cryme: I say hir reason, for shee cannot decline a Crowne of Virtue for one of Gold, but the reflection on the purchase, will deprive hir of all the joy of it; and though a Crowne of Empire be more glittering than one of Constancy, yet the just Gods by conferring many reall aduantages on the latter, have abundantly repair'd the seeming ones of the former, for the first being materiall is subject to the inconstancy's of Fortune, but the last being a speculative blessing, is exempted from the power of that blinde Goddesse, yes doubtlesse, a Crowne of Constancy is the noblest aswell as safest, for it produces Admiration where the other does Enuy. Alas (said Oristes) how ingenious you are to inuent arguments to cosen your-selfe, and as if you thought Izadora deluded you not fast-enough, you contribute to hir designe. Take heed (reply'd Perolla) of what you say for I can hardly beleive him virtuous, that thinkes shee is not. This made Oristes perceive that to destroy my generous Freinds good opinion of me, he must decline arguments and employ demonstrations, which made him say, Though I finde I shall create your anger by acquainting you with what I lately discover'd, yet I had rather hazard the loseing of your Freindship by an action which will render me worthy of it, than continue it by a silence which my owne Conscience will more severely punish than you can; Yes yes, Perrolla, I am determin'd since to cure your disease I must shew you the deformity of it, to instruct you with a Truth, that had not my sight bin the witnesse of, I should never have credited; in a word, 'tis that with these Eyes I lately sawe hir give such large proofes of hir passion to Hanniball, that not only I suspect hir constancy, but hir Virtue. At these barbarous words all Perolla's temper abandon'd him, & in its roome he entertan'd a rage so vnresistable, that forgeting all the former Tye's of Freindship, he flung himselfe upon the false Oristes, & having cast him at his Feete, and there drawne out the Wretches owne Ponyard, he held it to his Brest, & cry'd out to him, Traytor that vnder the Habit of a Freind think'st to shrow'de thy selfe from the punishment of an Enemy, and from a Cryme the Divells would tremble but to heare; know, that in accusing Izadora's Virtue thou hast justify'd Her, & by vndertakeing to make hir guilty; hast prov'd thy selfe so. Doe not thinke that because I have lost my Liberty I have lost my Courage; nor that the apprehension of Hanniballs resentmemts shall hinder me from acting Mine; no no, could he inflict on me. Torments as great as those thou merit'st, I would endure them all, rather than thy impiety should 'scape vnreveng'd, for that Divine Iustice which has made me from a Prisoner a Iudge, and has furnisht me with Power aswell as Will to punish thee, would not have so arm'd my hand, if it had not ordain'd, thy Death should appease that sacred virtue thy Life has so highly injur'd. Whilst Perolla was thus speaking, the false Oristes lay as if he had already receiv'd the reward of his infidelity, but when he perceiv'd his resolution, & that he was goeing to act it, he cry'd out, hold generous Perolla, and if I begg this small suspension of Life, 'tis only to let you know who 'tis you destroy, 'tis your faithfull'st Freind, & now I have told you that Truth, act your resentments, for since you have withdrawne your Freindship, they wilbe rather effects of your goodnesse than your Revenge, and the Gods who know my innocency, are so juste as to render that which makes my Life my misfortune, the cure of the latter, by the ending of the former. Though I knowe well (reply'd Perolla) all thou now say'st is but a continuation of thy wickednesse, and that these words are spoaken because thou hast found I am sooner vanquish't with dissembling than resistance, yet I give thee thy Life, not as a Mercy but a punishment, for the horror of having injur'd so faire an Innocence, wilbe a greater torment, than that Death from which I now exempt thee: Rise then (he continu'd) and be gone, but if ever againe thou presenst't thy selfe before me, thou wilt kindle a fire which nothing but thy blood can extinguish. I will obey you (said the perfidious Oristes) in hope that by so painfull an obedience you will discover a Freindship, & innocency, which your Passion hinders you now from seeing, and if by my sufferings I can shew you your error, I shall never deplore them. Then saluting Perolla with a great humility, he went from him with a greater joy, having 'scapt a Death which he could not think he had more strangly avoyded, then he had justly deserved it. I know (said Izadora) that 'twere but just to decline a while the prosecuting the rest of my Story, to declame upon this generous part of it, but I know too, that Perolla's virtue would be asmuch offended with such a gratitude, as I was pleas'd with the cause of it. Perolla, who for so obligeing a Civility esteem'd it necessary to make his faire Mistris a returne, told hir, If you had a designe Madam to have made this performance passe in the generous Spartacus opinion for an action of Merit, you should not then have shew'd him the perfect Izadora; for in hir Beauty shee carryes hir Iustification, and to suspect that vice can dwell in so much brightnesse, is to be ignorant of its Nature, and to comitt a folly as high as Oristes wickednesse. Izadora by a reply of the same quality repay'd hir Lovers Complement, and thus re-assum'd hir discourse. As soone as the false Agent was gone from Perolla, he went and acquainted the Carthaginian with his ill successe, from whose rage he had like to have receiv'd an vsage as ill, as that which Perollas Iustice had neere imposed on him; for he had rais'd his expectation to such a height, that it made the fall the more vnsupportable; but at last Hanniball perceiving that Oristes was vnfortunate, and not faulty (at least as to him) he was contented to tell him, that he must not expect his favour 'till he had gain'd him Mine, that it was too, the sensibl'st way of obligeing him, aswell as of revenging that so fresh and high Affront, that their Intrest being now joyn'd, he would not dispaire but that he would project some new designe for the obtaineing of his desires, which if it succeeded, should make him acknowledge, that whosoever made Haniball happy, could not doubt the being made so by him. Thereupon Oristes having first assur'd him that no perticuler Interest of his owne could bring any accession to that zeale he had already for his satisfaction, & that he would employ all his faculties to the settelment of it, withdrew himselfe to meditate on what he determin'd to practice. But it is high tyme to informe you, that the Carthaginian (though he constantly visited me) had yet (in reliance on Oristes promises) declin'd makeing any overtures of his Passion, least my replyes might have provok'd him beyond his temper, and made him disclose a fallacy which with admirable patience and sagasity, he had so longe continu'd; but now seeing those hopes were vanisht, he resolv'd to renue his addresses, and to that end came to see me, where findeing me alone (which my humor and condition made me often elect) he, without any of those Civilities which he vsually practis'd, told me; That Long silence Madam which your Commands have made me observe, the violence of my Passion makes me breake, which is arriv'd to such a height, that it must now be the occasion of my Felicity or my Ruine, for it can admitt of nothing but extreames, and I must now become the object of your Hate or of your Love; the Gods shall be my wtitnesses; that I have declin'd this declaration 'till necessity constrain'd me to it, and I beleive you canot doubt but it must be a strange violence, which forces me to what I apprehend is a trouble to you; Yes faire Izadora, I say forces me unto it, for, in what depended on my Will, when 'twas to acquaint you with my respect, I declin'd my Revenge, I declin'd my Ambition, two of the most pleasing passions, & not to offend you, I elected to offend the Gods, chusing to reward my Souldiers vallours with Sacred things, rather than with the spoyles of Rome. But in what relates to my Flame I am not Master of my owne motions, I have afflicted my selfe not to doe the like to you, I have endeavour'd to establish your felicity by ruining my owne, and I have represented to my selfe, that I ought not to have a higher contentment than the setteling of yours; but Madam, all my endeavours therein are fruitlesse, for I finde the passion of Love is the most predominant, and that the extinguishing my Flame is as impossible, as I beleive the performeing it would be pleasing to you; but your Beauty that makes my Cryme, must be my excuse, for it has charmes to print a Passion, aswell as Majesty to enjoyne Obedience. This (farire Izadora) is my condition, and 'tis at the last extreamity, and after all Essayes, that I am come to implore your Affection, when I know I should rather begg your Pardon. I must confesse (said Izadora) so violent a begining gave me strange apprehensios what the conclusion of this visit would produce; but (least my feares might increase his confidence) I instantly reply'd; If you have had any great conflicts with your selfe for the setteling of my felicity, I beleive those I have had for the acquainting you with my gratitude, have not bin inferior to them; but that same Will which forces you to a perseverance in your Affection, necessitates me to the like in Mine, and since by an experiment you finde wee have something within us which is the God over our inclinations, I hope you will pardon my not accepting your affection, upon the same score that I excuse the continuation of yours. If (said Hanniball extreamly mou'd) our Wills were wholly created by our Fancy's which are the most often deprav'd irregularities, there might besome apparence in what you alleadge, but since amongst reasonable Creatures, Reason commonly formes them, I must looke upon that which you doe tearme a costraint resembling mine, rather as a design'd Cruelty for my destruction; for if Perolla has purchast any glory, I beleive my stock is not lesse than his; if he have a high Passio for you, myne is not inferior; if he have pay'd you any services, I have not bin deficient in those Dutyes: and if he has receiv'd any guifts from Nature, perhaps I have not bin vnbeholding to hir: therefore Madam, you cannot be so vnjust to vse that argument, for the continuing of your flame, which I did for your pardon for persevereing in mine, the difference betwixt you and Perolla being so vast, that none which is not as blinde as Love, can immagine the same effects have an equall Cause. I must acknowledge (said Izadora) I was so sensible of heareing him make his owne Elogie, so much too, to the prejudice of Perolla, that had I not appreheded what I should have said for his justification, might have turn'd (thorough Hanniballs) fury to his prejudice, I had made him knowe how much (in truth and in my Iudgement) he was his owne Flatterer; but that consideration made me only tell him, If either our Wills be form'd by our Fancye or Reason, or compos'd of both, I finde in Perolla a greater subject for the continuance of my affection, than you can doe in me, for a perseverance in yours; 'tis not that I give him any precedency over the great Hanniball, who it may be (had I knowne him first) might have had that Heart which now it is impossible for any but Perolla to possesse; but the Starrs having ty'd me to him, 'tis not in my power, nor in my inclination to change their influence: therefore (Sir) I conjure you, let your generosity act what your Iudgement should, give me cause to admire what I am vnworthy to love, and consider 'tis something of divine to make others happy. If (said the Carthaginian with a Face all inflam'd with fury) it be impossible for Hannibll to possesse your heart, I will render it as impossible for Perolla, who shall finde I have a power to make others miserable, if I my selfe am made so; and since you esteeme the possession of Izadora too-great a Felicity for me, I must thinke it is so for any other; Your Cruelty (Madam) constraines me to this declaration, which whatsoever influence it has on me, it shall have the like on Perolla: and if at last you reduce me to despaire, I will accompany my ruine with one's whose losse you will deplore, asmuch as you would rejoyce at Mine. Great Gods! what a trembling did these barbarous threatnings put me into? they were a thousand tymes fuller of horror than if they had bin made against my owne Life, but amongst all those feares, the reflection on Hanniballs power, and inclination, and consequently on Perollas danger, arm'd me with such a resolution, that had I follow'd the dictates of it, I might have render'd that rage a Iustice, which was a Cruelty: but my good Genius gave me power to suppresse it, & findeing the Tyrant was the feircer by opposition, I reply'd, the Virtues of the great Hanniball are too-well knowne unto me, to suspect, any passions can be more predominant over him, than they: those humane frailties can only doe like Clouds, hinder the Sunn from shineing, but not extinguish his Light, 'Tis his anger, and not He which threatens me. No no Madam (the Carthaginian hastily reply'd interrupting me) doe not flatter your selfe, nor me, in beleiveing I am capable of milder resolutions than I have acquainted you with, and receive this as an vnalterable Truth, that the same hower in which you absolutely take away my hopes, I will Perolla's Life. With those cruell words he went out of the Roome, & left me at liberty to breathe out those Complaints which I disdain'd to vtter in his presence. But (Sir) my astonishment at this proceeding was farr short of what it was rais'd unto by that I am now goeing to tell you. Some fowre or five dayes after, Hanniball came to visit me againe, where having found by oblique questions, that his assaults had rather confirm'd than mov'd my Resolution, he immediatly made me such submissive recantations for what was past, that I beleiv'd they were as reall, as humble; Then he assur'd me, that having alwayes lov'd me above himselfe, he was come to evidence that Truth, by an vndeniable experiment; that the respect he pay'd the happy Perolla as being the object of my Love, was greater than his aversion to him, for being the obstructer of his; & since he thought noe evincement of the reallity of those professions could be both so great & pleasing, as the ruining of his owne Felicity for the establishing of Mine, he was determin'd to settel it, at that rate, That his former threatnings were but as a last Essay, & that having found our Flames were too-divine to admitt of extinction, he was inviolably fix't to admire what he could not destroy; & to obtaine a Pardon for those persecutions his passion, and not he had rais'd us, he would immediatly restore Perolla to his liberty, and employ all his authority with Blacius to vnite, what was a sinne any longer to divide. At these generous words, I cast my selfe at the Carthaginians Feete, and by too-many expressions for a repetition, acquainted him with my joy and acknowledgements. Immediatly after he went to Perolla, where in Civilities of a resembling quality he implor'd his forgivenesse, and begg'd him allwayes when he consider'd his persecutions, that he would too, consider, the occasion of them, that so the reflection on the cause might appollogize for the effect; he besought him further, to remember that the obligation was greater to lay downe a Passion for Izadora, than the injury was to have assum'd one: since having seene hir, not to be his Ryvall could not prove a greater Miracle, than having bin it, ever to decline that name. After some other expressions and embraces Hanniball assur'd Perolla, that as an argument of his conversion & that he had silenc't (if not supprest) his passion, from that instant he restor'd him to so perfect a liberty, that he might either returne to Rome or continue in Salapia. My generous Freind with an equall proportion of wonder and joy receiv'd these transcendent Civilities from the Carthaginian, and having made him some retributions proportionat to their cause, he was invited by him to his owne house, where by fresh accessions of the like quality, he induc'd all the Salapians not only to wonder at, but beleive the change. But (continu'd Izadora) least your astonishment should prove as great at the heareing, as ours at the performance of these mutations, I must acquaint you that Hanniball was seemeingly gallant, but to become the more securely the contrary; and though he were a Prince who in affaires of craft and ingenuity had hardly any equall, yet his Genius had a greater propensity to those stratagems, which were for the winning of a Battell, or a Kingdome, than a Mistris; This Truth I beleive you will not question by the sequell of this dicourse, which I must continue, by informing you that the same Night after his fatall declaration which he made me concearning Perolla, he sent for Oristes, and having lockt themselves up in his Closset, he inform'd him perticularly of what had past betwixt us, and conjur'd him to finde out an expedient for his releife, which if any loger delay'd, would immediatly prove his destruction, To this his wicked Councellor reply'd, Wee have already (Sir) by our atempts on Perolla, obseru'd that his constancy findes in them rather arguments of Tryumph, than suppression; we must therefore now assault Izadora's, For it imports not whether you reach your desires by Perolla's declineing hir; or by Izadora's deserting him; & I am confident had not your Resentments forc't you to threaten your Ryvalls Life, I had found out a way which would have made it his Torment, & whose successe could not have fayl'd, without the Gods declareing themselves asmuch Enemyes to your Love, as they have bin Freinds to your Glory. 'Twas (he continu'd) that I would have had you in your next visit to Izadora (in case you found your threatnings had not produc'd the effects you desir'd) not only alter your words, but your lookes, & by a Countenance altogether penitent, acquaint hir that you are resolv'd to give hir a Testimony of your Passion by suppressing the effects of it; that since the only way to manifest how much you valu'd hir contemtment, is to deprive your selfe of your owne, you are come to divest your selfe of it, by renounceing your hopes, & resigneing them to Perolla, who you must acknowledge is more worthy of the Felicity by hir esteemeing him so; that since you could not coquer hir, you have vanquisht your selfe, and that in immitation of hir, you valu'd him above your selfe. 'Tis (said Oristes) with such professions as these I would infuse in hir a firme beleife, that you would attempt against your owne, rather than Perollas Life, and the better to disguise the fallacy, I am absolutely of opinion, that not only your words but your actions speake your change, (I meane by giving him his liberty, and inviting him to continve neere his Mistris; for I can assure you Blacicius is so vigilant of his Daughter, that your Rivall can derive no advantage by his Freedome, and so detests any allyance with Pacuvius Blood, that he had rather marry Izadora to hir Grave, than to Perolla; whose Father I would have you send on some employment of so long a continuance, that in his absence we may act our intentions, having then by such pregnant testimonyes of your conversion rais'd a beleife in your Mistris that you have no designes for hir, but to see hir marryed to Perolla (which I would allwayes presse to Blacius, and as his aversions for it increast, so should your sollicitations) I would then one Night privatly seize upon Perolla, and by bribeing two or three Phisitians (amongst which Blacius's should be one who is my intimate acquaintance, and whose aversion to all Pacuvius's Family, and affection to Gold, will induce him to say any thing wee shall put in his mouth) make them give out that he dy'd of an Appoplexie, or some such sudden disease, & then celebrate his Funeralls with such mourning & pompe, that the World may beleive the reallity of your Freindship as great, as that of his Death. This being artificially perform'd, you must a while mingle your Teares with Izadora's as for your common losse, and so steale into hir affections by sympathizing in hir Freindship and hir greife; For I cannot fancy but if your Ryvall were remov'd, all obstructions were so too, & the object of hir Flame being dead, shee will (since 'tis without injureing hir virtue or felicity) bestow hir selfe upon a Conqueror, whose Fame only is able to dissolve the most frozen Brest. As for Perolla (if this succeed) you may either send him to another World in earnest, or after you are marry'd, the more sensibly to revenge his having bin so dangerous a Ryvall both in Love and Glory, permit him to continue in this; but the first is the more secure, for his presence may receive those Fires which nothing extinguist but hir beleife that his Life was so; & thus whilst you possesse Izadora, he may hir Affectio. That which induces me, not to have Perolla Kil'd before you see the event of this designe, is, least if by a miracle shee should resent his losse to such an extreamity as it may prove hir owne; you may have still your remedy in your power, and thereby be in no worse a condition than that which you are in at present. The malicious Oristes having done speakeing, Hanniball continu'd a while weighing the probability of this designe, and having at last absolutely approv'd it; he demaunded (with much impatiency) of Oristes whether yet it might not be acted? To which his Agent reply'd, that those mennaces made against Perolla, would make that relish of designe, which should be esteem'd the contrary; since all the hope of the plott, was the mannageing it with such dexterity, that Izadora should rather beleive you deplor'd than acted hir losse. I am (said the Carthaginian) perfectly conuinc't of what you alleadge, but those threatnings I made against my Ryvalls Life, were spoaken when I was in so visible a distemper, that I am confident shee ascribes them sooner to my choller than designe. Neither were they possitive, but conditionall, and therefore probably all the prejudice they will bring, will be only to me, and not to what you propose, for it will tye me to act my part with more dissimulation, and protract the tyme of my sufferings. Thus (said Izadora) Hanniball tooke up a designe, whose begining I have already inform'd you of, & whose successe was so proportionat to his desires, that not only Izadora, but Perolla beleiv'd his conversion was as reall, as 'twas well acted. And Blacius (on the other side) so perfectly made good Oristes assurance to the Carthaginian, that in halfe a yeare (in which Perolla enjoy'd his liberty and the priviledge of liveing in Salapia) I could never have the happines of seeing, or the satisfaction of heareing from him, and when so intollerable a separation made the effects of it visible in my humour, the artificious Hanniball offer'd, and conjur'd me to make vse of his power for our vnion, which had formerly bin employ'd for our separation, that what had injur'd, might releeve us. But he too-well knew I had rather intrench upon my felicity than duty, and 'twas upon that confidence he made me that overture. To abbreviat my Relation I shall tell you, that all which Oristes advis'd was perform'd, and that which contributed to the better executeing what related to Perollas sudden death was, that Pacuvius & all his were remov'd to Tarentum, and that Perolla (who only had Strato to waite on him) had employ'd him to Rome about some private Affaires. Oh Gods! what my sufferinge was at that fatall Newes you only know, but those effects of it which were visible, prov'd so dangerous, that Blacius's Phisitian was immediatly sent for, to hinder my Death from accompanying Perollas: & that Traytor detesting my allyance with any of Pacuvius Family, and being corrupted by Hanniballs Rewards, after he had prescrib'd those things which he held needfull for my condition, told me, that he was apprehensive the Carthaginian had murther'd my Freind, to build his owne felicity on his ruines; that Hanniball had rather counterfeicted than extinguisht his Flame, and therefore he would goe and visite Perollas body, which if it had receiv'd any violence, he would as certainly discover, as the Gods punish it. This proposition suited with my jealousies, & though the knowledge of what he suspected, would have added to my greife (if at least it had bin capable of any accession) by a manifestatio that his passion for me, was the occassion of his Death, yet I embrac'd his motion, resolveing if any Symptomes should evince so black a Truth, that I would with one stroake revenge his Murther, and with another follow him: The Phisitian some litle tyme after being return'd, with many false Teares, protested, that Perolla's body had not the least marke of an vnnaturall Death, and that he ask't the Gods forgivenesse for having suspected so cleere an Innocency as Hanniballs. He then too began to play the Phisitian of the Minde, and besought me not to afflict my selfe, since 'twas not Man that had sent Perolla to the Gods, but that they themselves had call'd him: But alas my afflictions had too-just an object ever to cease but with my Life, which every day so exceedingly impair'd, that I was in hopes by a speedy dissolution to make the end of Torments in this world, to be the begining of Ioyes in the other. In the meane tyme Hanniball celebrated Perolla's funeralls with so many counterfeict weepeings, and with so much solemnity, that all Salapia beleiv'd 'twas he and not Pacuvius which had lost a Sonne. Two Months together he was so farre from consoleing me by his visits, that by them he increast my greife, which, though it reduc'd me to a condition fitter to create his pitty than his affection, yet the last had taken so deepe a roote, that no diminution of my litle Beauty, could bring any to his passion, which indeed he could no longer silence; therefore one Euening he came to visite me, & though I was fitter for a Preist than a Lover, yet he declar'd himselfe the latter, & beg'd me with the perfect'st importunities to receive and cherrish a Flame which he had silenc'd whilst he held it a cryme; but now that the higher Powers contributed so much to reward its purity, as to take him, to them, which had hinder'd me from justly receiveing it, he flatter'd himselfe with a hope that to recopence his respect and passion, and obey what the Gods themselves had so evidently approv'd, I would accept of a Harte that yeelded nothing in the zeale of adoreing me, to that of my last Servant and his Freind. I know he spoake many things of this quality, which because I detested to heare, I cannot repeate; for I so Iustly disrellisht this motion, that I had a strong conflict with my selfe to silence my resentments for it, but at length I told him, Ah (Sir) how can you call your selfe Perolla's Freind, and yet endeavour to disturbe his Ashes? and how can you have a passion for one, who you have hopes to make vnworthy your affection, by conferring hirs on you? No Sir, I beseech you let me follow my resolution, which is, to dye Perolla's, since I could not live his: for my hart (after such a losse) is not capable of any Passion, but greife, or if it be, that passion I had for his virtues, I must now continue to his memory. To which Hanniball answer'd, Will you then conferre a blessing upon one which is not capable of it, to deny it to another who is, and perhaps deserves it too: Ah Madam, if it is your affection for Perolla, & not your hatred for Hanniball which produces this resolve, you will evince that truth sooner by granting than declineing my request, for if in the other Life we are not ignorant of what is done in this; Perolla will be more satisfyed to know by your giveing your selfe now to me, that he only hinder'd it hitherto, than by your refuseing me absolutly that felicity; since that may appeare rather an effect of your aversion for me, than your respect to him. I am Sir (I reply'd) of a contrary opinion, for my passion and my resentments for his losse wilbe much more legible in their taking from me the ambition of being the object of great so a Coquerors Love; and in abandoning not only the pleasure of Life, but the desire of it too: I conjure you therefore by the quiet of Perolla, which you endeavour to disturbe, torment me not by so fruitlesse a persecution, which if you persevere in, 'twill induce me rather to suppresse the respect I pay you, than to create that affection you solicite, and force me to beleive that Hanniball (& not the Gods) have taken away his Ryvall. It may be (continu'd Izadora) you will beleive so great a Prince meritted a proportionat respect, but I must acknowledg, I was not in an humour to affoard it him, neither doe I beleive I could give him a worse opinion of me by my replyes, than he seem'd to have of me by his desires; but after by his lookes he had exprest what his answer would be, he told me; You thinke Madam to silence my Passion with reproaches, to avoyde ingratitude by becomeing vniust, & by accuseing my innocency to decline being a debtor to my Flame; but know, that your cruelty may induce me to revenge what I cannot obtaine, and though you have avoyded any impressions of my Love, some that you are concern'd in may not those of my resentments. Tyrant (I reply'd) while Perolla was alive I consider'd thy threatnings because I fear'd them, but now the subject of my apprehensions is remov'd, I desire them, for in becomeing my executioner, thou wilt be more kinde than in continuing my Lover. Oh Gods! (Hanniball cry'd out interupting me) why doe you give me so much chollor & so much Love together? & why did you not give me a hart capable of indureing injuries, when you give me a Mistris apt to conferre them on me; then immediatly flinging himselfe on his knees by my Bedds side (for my weakenesse made me vnable to receive his visits in another conditio, he cotinu'd, Madam, though my rage have made me sinne by mennaceing in a place where I should only adore, yet doe not so much misinterpret my cryme, as to thinke my threatnings had you for their object, You I say, for whose safety had I as many lives as you have Beauties, I would Sacrifice them all rather than employ one minute of them to a contrary thought; No faire Izadora, if my resentments at your cruelty forc't my Passion to what my Reason condemnes, beleives me 'twas only against Blacius, who for his injuries to you, aswell as relations, appear'd in my fury the fittest object for it. Alas Sir (I reply'd interrupting him) you are more cruell in your interpretation, than in your threatnings, and are more injurious in having those designes against my Father, than against me: for if they were only intended against Izadora, if my greife deceive me not, 'twill be so charitable as to exempt me from them, or if it does not, your resentments will prove an obligation, (for I consider every thing at that rate which hastens my vnion with Perolla) but if neither my sorrow for my losse, nor your fury for your fruitlesse passion, will prove my cure, know that I will act it my selfe, and to punish my coldnesse for Hanniball, & reward my Flame for his Ryvall, I will vntye my Soule from that Cley which invirons it, & thereby also secure Blacius against your revenge, by rendring the acting it an injustice. Thereuppon turning from him, I fell so bitterly a weepeing, that though Hanniball made me a long answer to what I spoke, yet I did not so much as listen to him, being wholly intent in summoning all those thoughts which I fancy'd would soonest make me performe what I told the Carthaginian I design'd; and indeed those sadd resentments findeing a body extreamly weakned, and a Minde as apt to receive their impressions, were in one daye so kinde, as to give me the hopes of not liveing an other; neither was this only my conjecture, but the possitive opinon of my Fathers Phisitian, who in a trembling haste acquainted Hanniball with it, & conjur'd him since by so evinceing a demonstration, it was impossible to separate us, that he would contribute to what he saw he could not hinder. I will not tell you all the Carthaginians disputes with himselfe, which could not on so plentifull a Subject but be excellent, let it be sufficient you learne, that though the cause which was to create his pitty, might as justly his Revenge (I meane the sadd extreamity my Passion for his Ryvall had reduc'd me to) yet he gott the victory over the latter, & generously told the Doctor; Come, let us shew Izadora hir Perolla, for I had rather lose my hopes than the object of them; but if this fresh experiment of my Passion, create none in hir, it may induce me to act what I have hitherto but counterfeicted. Thereupon immediatly he sent the Captaine of his guards for Perolla (who had till then bin kept in the Dungeon of a litle Castle some two Miles from Salapia) who was no sooner come (though it was very late) but the Carthaginian (who had accesse into Blacius's house at his pleasure) came with him into my Chamber, where all those that watcht with me, were weepeing a Death which according to their beleife & my desire, was not many howres distant: But all of them no sooner sawe my generous Freind, whose funeralls had bin solemniz'd above a quarter of a yeare before, than with horrid skreeks they fledd out of the Roome. Hanniball was not displeas'd at their absence, and Perolla (who 'till then thought he was drawne out of a Prison to end his Life) began now to feare a more transcendent misfortune, for being ignorant of his owne supposed Death, the sadd posture he found my Women in, and those strange extravagancyes of theirs, made him attribute the first to my Death, and the last to their Charity, for that horror they knew would invade him, at his seeing me Dead; which absolutly he was confirm'd in, by my not (at so great a Clamour) lookeing out to discover or enquire the cause of it; and he further beleiv'd, that his Tyrant had only brought him thither, to shew him so melancholly a spectacle, as a Revenge for being his Ryvall both in Love and Glory. But then on the other side, he could hardly beleive the Carthaginian durst shew him so inrageing an object, and trust him vnty'd to act his resentments. Whilst the poore Perolla was in this laborynth, he was lead out of it by Hanniballs opening my Curtens a litle, and telling me; See Madam, my power and my infelicity, that can performe Miracles for others, & not for my selfe, that can raise the Dead to bring you to Life, and perhaps my selfe to Death, that can doe all things indeede but what I most desire: here faire Izadora (he continu'd) drawing Perolla towards me) drye up your Teares, which else may hinder you from seeing your happinesse, and remember he which to save your life has runn so hazardous a course to his owne, merits (at least) that you never give your selfe to another, if you will not bestow your selfe on him. These strange words, & the as-strange noyse which somwhat preceded them, made me turne about to vnderstand their meaning, but o Gods! what was my surprize when I sawe Perolla in this world who I was makeing such haste to finde out in the other? truly 'twas so transcendent, that I fell into a deepe swoond, and thereby those powres which have ever tooke delight to afflict me, continu'd that practice, for whilst I beleiv'd Perolla dead, they kept me alive, and now they shew'd him me alive, thy flung me into a seemeing Death, which too had like to have caus'd a reall one in my generous Freind; but Hanniball, whose concearne for me was not so great as his, permitted his care to be greater, who rann out to call my women to my assistance, & to whome he was constrain'd to make many oathes, that it was really Perolla and not his Ghost, before he could perswade them to come in to me; But Callione, the cheifest of them, both in hir extraction and my esteeme, knew so well the interest I had in Perolla, that whilst others tooke up their employment about me, shee made him the object of hirs; and was so vnhappily successefull in it, that shee brought him out of his fainting before I was recover'd of mine, which rais'd in him so high despaire, that had not all those which were present assur'd him my disease and his were of the same quallity, and that only mine meeting with a body disabl'd by a deepe sicknes, was the cause of its longer continuance, I beleive he would have acted some such violence on himselfe, as had made my recovery my highest misfortune; but at length, about an hower after, by the helpe of strong Cordialls my swoonding abandon'd me, and I no sooner open'd my Eyes than the first objects they saw, were Hanniball and Perolla, who were both kneeling by my beds side, but the joy of beholding the latter, made me neither consider nor care how much the expressions of it would offend the former; to confirme this truth, I told the other: Are the Gods then so just (Perolla) as to reward by this sight the fidelity of my Eyes, which abhor'd all objects but you, and which having lost you, have endeavour'd to weepe themselves out as vselesse things; or else is it an illusion and a mockery of Fate, by makeing me (in resenting the joy of your Resurrection) the more exactly sensible of your reall Death, Tell me I conjure you, which of them 'tis? for if it be the latter, I will deceive hir cruelty, and convert what shee intends for one, into a summons to follow you, which I thanke the Gods my weaknesse (for you supposed or reall Death) makes me as able, as my passion willing to performe. Madam (he reply'd) kissing my hands, I am really alive, but 'tis only your joy at it which makes me esteeme my being so, a happinesse; for how can I consider the persecutions I have rais'd you in being alive, and those afflictions I have cast you into, in not being thought so by you, but I must be strucke with a greife as great as my Flame, & perpetually deplore an experiment which convinces me, that both my Life and my Death must be a trouble to you. All this I heard Perolla speake, yet I was so overjoy'd at his first words, which were an assurance of what I only desir'd, that not answering his last, I rais'd my selfe up the best I could and embraceing him that spoke them, I did that which on any other occasion, & in that posture, I should not have perform'd; but the subject of my satisfaction was so legittimate, that I could not suppresse any extravagancy it produc'd. It is true Madam (said Perolla, interrupting his faire Mistris) your joy was obligeing to Hanniball aswell as to me, for in your acting it (as he afterwards confest to Oristes) he discover'd Beautyes which he protested sufficiently pay'd his Charity in preserveing your Life. Izadora at these words, was all cover'd with blushes, and hir Servant perceiveing it (to repaire hir disorder) told hir But Madam, as it was but just that Hanniball should receive a reward for his cure, so it was as just his Eyes should receive the punishment of their presumption, which were both perform'd, for as their seeing those perfections effected the former, so his seeing the litle share He had in them, did the latter. Izadora (said Symander) was so confus'd in the remembrance of theise perticulers, that without takeing notice of Perollas words, shee made haste to passe over the subject of them, by thus reassumeing hir relation. Hanniball was so inrag'd, that in my joy I had forgott my gratitude to him which furnisht me with the Cause of it, that riseing up he told me. Is then all the Reward (Madam) you give my Love, but a demonstration that you have given all yours to my Ryvall, and is your Flame so great, that you cannot conceale it when the disclosure is both vnwise and vngratefull? ah Izadora! how much doe you rely on the power you have over me, when you care not to offend mine by so sensible a provocation! These words drew me from that employment my excesse of joy had enguadg'd me in, and findeing the Carthaginian was as just in his repoaches, as I esteem'd I was in what caus'd them, I thought fitt to tell him. You doe place (Sir) a wrong construction on my actions, since that which you tearme my ingratitude, is rather an effect of my confidence in your virtue; for did I thinke you a Tyrant, I would not add a Provocation to the power of your Revenge, but knowing you to be just, I dare even in your presence manifest a Flame, whose virtue renders me confident rather of your protection, than resentments. Ah Madam (said Hanniball) why doe you make me just, to make me miserable? and if what I have seene you act be in reliance on my virtue, I beseech you ascribe none vnto me, for mine will then be my punishment, & make me rather implore the Gods to take from me that litle I possesse, than to let it thus torment me. Wee were in discourses of this quality, when Blacius being inform'd of Hanniballs visit (and of Perollas Resurrection) came into my Chamber; where in tearmes as sharpe as the remembrance of the Carthaginians Power permitted him to vse, he murmur'd at his bringing his mortall Enemy into his house, and restoreing his Daughter to a certainty of his being alive: And though Hanniball represented, that that was the only way to continue me so; yet my Father never lessen'd his repineing, but added that since I was of so degenerate a disposition, he had rather have lost than preserv'd me at so high a rate: then he besought Hanniball to permitt him to make vse of his paternall, and domestick power, over his Daughter, and in his owne house; which the Carthaginian granted, that wee might be separated & yet not derive that misfortune from him; but though it was not immediatly his acte, yet it was an effect of his permission, which I so resented, that seeing my Father goeing to send out Perolla with somewhat a lesse Civility than I expected, I made haste to tell him; Since (generous Perolla) I know not whether wee shall ever meete againe, I esteeme it fitt to give you an assurance before such memorable wittnesses, that the Gods shall be mine, I will never be any's but yours, that nothing but Death shall dissolve this enguadgment, & if yours happen before mine, I will by the helpe of my greife, or my resolution, immediatly follow you. Perolla at this profession turn'd about (though Blacius was leading him forth) and told me, And I Madam, doe beseech the same Gods if ever I cherrish my Life but for your sake, if ever I decline my Passion, or if ever I surviue your losse a minute after I know it, to make me the object of their fury, and to throwe onn me as many miseries, as they have bestow'd perfections on the faire Izadora, This profession I made him aswell to reward his Flame, as to take from Blacius all the hopes of changeing mine, as also to punish Hanniball for giveing my Father a power which he deny'd him in all things but to torment me; & truly the Carthaginian was in such a rage at this just and mutuall inguadgement, that he commanded some of his Guards (which waited at the Dore) to take Perolla and keepe him as their Lives, 'till his pleasure were knowne. Then comeing to my Bedds side, he told me; I see Madam that you trample on the goodnesse of my disposition, and that you beleive because I have not, that I dare not revenge my selfe on my Ryvall; but know, if you persevere in that beleife, I will covince you of the contrary by so blooddy an experiment, that you will finde I am capable of as high a proportion of Revenge, as Love, and that by not rewarding the latter, you will necessitate me to act the former. He had no sooner done speakeing, than without staying for a reply he left me, and at Oristes importunat intreaties he committed Perolla to his charge, with horrid vowes, that he should answer for him with his Life; to which condition the Traytor condiscended; and having receiv'd his Charge, he brought him to his house, lod'gd him in a Chamber with grated windowes, & plac'd at the comeing in to it, a strong Guard of Affricans which Hanniball furnisht him with, whoe every day visited me, and as his discourse, so his reception was; sometymes returning with hopes, for I consider'd Perolla was in his power; sometymes without any, least he might thinke him his only obstacle, and so remove him. But I omitted to tell you, that the certainty of my generous Freinds being alive, made me court asmuch my recovery, as formerly I had my Death, and with my health, my litle (& vnfortunate) Beauty being return'd, it increast so much the Carthaginians Fire, that vnder the pretence of the greatnesse of it, one Evening he became so indiscreet that I was not capable any longer to dissemble, but gave him so just and sharpe a reprehension, that in the fury it produc'd, upon his returne to his owne house, he sent for Oristes, and lead him into his owne Bedd-Chamber, where having shutt the Dore, he acquainted that Traytor, that he was able no longer to containe his resentments, & that he could not beare two such powerfull passions, as Revenge & Love. The false Oristes, readily lay'd hold of the motio, & to satisfy his owne Revenge on Perolla (whom he highly apprehended) so husbanded Hanniballs fury, that he inclin'd him at last really to make away his Ryvall, concludeing that his respect had bin too-long his torment, that it was but just to take away so considerable an Enemy both to him and to Carthage, & that if he could not thereby obtaine his desires, yet he should his Revenge. This Resolve being assum'd, Oristes as he had procur'd Perollas Death, so he offer'd himselfe to act it, & propounded for that performance to give him a lingering Poyson, which should be so slowe in operation, that the World should rather beleive he dy'd by his owne melancholly, than by Hanniballs resentments. This the Carthaginian having approu'd, he and Oristes separated themselves, the former to make some publique dispatches, and the latter with a designe instantly to execute the result of that meeting. But the Gods which detested so darke a Sinn, prevented it by a way as strange as was the intended designe it selfe, For the Gallant Maharball, Generall of the Carthaginian Horse, who all the preceedent Night, had bin putting things in a posture for the Armyes Martch, came to Hanniballs house, that selfesame Evening & tyme in which he was visiting me, where learning that his Generall was in an Employment which commonly was of no small continuance, and being somwhat sleepie, flung himselfe upon Hanniballs Bedd, which was not strange because of that great familiarity that was allwayes betwixt them, where he slept 'till the Carthaginians and Oristes comeing in did wake him, & before that he had tyme to rise, they had lockt the Dore, and begunn this horrid consultatio. Maharball, whose Genius was only inclin'd to Warre, detested the contrary humur in his Generall, which by experiment he found had bin alreaddy so distructiue to the Carthaginian Comon-wealth; This made him listen attentively in hope to discover some of those contrivances which Hanniball kept so private, and which by his knowledge of them, might furnish him with a meanes to weane him from a Passion he so much underualu'd & detested; but at length heareing so black a resolue, he determin'd to prevent what he condemn'd, but did not thinke the best way to effect it was to discover what he knew, which he beleiv'd would rather make his Generall a sham'd, than penitent; therefore as-soone as he & Oristes were gone, he himselfe retir'd to his owne house, and not knowing how soone that Traytor would execute his resolution, he immediatly calld for one of his owne Liveries, which being brought him, and haveing enjoyn'd the bringer of it an inuiolable secrecy; he went immediatly (as his custome was) to visit Perolla, being attended by some Twenty of his Domesticks all in one Livery, (as is the Carthaginian fashion) where findeing Perolla alone, he generously acquainted him with his danger, and presenting him with his Livery, advis'd him to putt it onn, and at his goeing out to shuffle himselfe amongst his Servants, which none of the Guards durst examine or would suspect. For this transcendent favour Perolla made him as many returnes as his Gratitude could inspire him withall, and the tyme permitt; and indeed he was so eloquent in his retributions, that not only Maharball inguadg'd himselfe to acquaint me with his escape, but also to make Oristes receive from Hanniball himselfe, the punishment of his Treachery & wickednesse. Immediatly therefore (as soone as Perolla was drest) Maharball (whose Servants attended him at the Dore) went out of Perolla's Chamber, and amongst the rest was lighted downe by him, who no sooner gott out of Oristes house (who all this while was at a Phisitians prepareing his fatall Poyson) than with the helpe of the Word Maharball gave him, he gott too out of the Samnite Gate; & his generous deliverer not only by a visit next day assur'd me of his escape, but also so incenst Hanniball against Oristes at it, (whose jealousie of his conivance at his flight, he so increast by puting him in minde of his pressing importunities to have him his Prisoner,) that in the height of that Rage, he gave order to putt Oristes to death, which he knowing was both vnavoydable & just, as being an effect of that cotract which had past betwixt Hanniball & him when Perolla was comitted to his charge, to disburthen his Conscience, he sent me privately in writeing a large relation of all those perticulers which I was ignorant of, & then receiu'd the stroake of Death in his owne Chamber, by his Command, for whome he had so wickedly employ'd his Life. Twas in this sorte that Perolla 'scap't a Treachery which fill'd him with so legittimate and high a resentment against him which had at least alowed it, that from that tyme he cotracted an implacable aversion for him, & resolu'd the first Battell the Romans fought, to tye himselfe so perticularly to Hanniball, that nothing but his owne Death should prevent his Ryvalls. In order to this determination, he went directly to Marcellus, from whose active courage he expected an earlyer opportunity to put his resolution in practice, than from Crispinus (his Colleague); I need not tell you the great satisfaction the gallant Marcellus receiu'd at Perolla's arrivall, you may in some degree immagin it by his saying he esteem'd his single Courage, and conduct, a greater reinforcement to his Army, than the addition of the best Roman Legion, and he was confident Hanniball valu'd it at no lesse a rate. After these Civilities, the Consull offer'd him any preferrment in his Army, and conjur'd him not to decline the Command of Generall of his Horse, (which then was vacant by the death of Marcus Aulius) but my generous freind, who was more ambitious of revenge than preferrment, & who suspected that office would confine him to a certaine Duty, and thereby frustrate his designe upon Hanniball, absolutely declin'd Marcellus offer, by assureing him, that he had better proportion'd his ambition to his desert, and consequently desir'd no greater honor than to serve vnder him as a Volunteer. The Consull was extreamely greiu'd at this refusall, for he would gladly have bound to him a Person he justly admir'd, but yet he vsd Perolla with the same respect as if he had taken so considerable an employment; for in all attempts, and in all Counsells, he would doe nothing without his advice & assistance, and if in things of action he was aboundantly satisfyed with his Courage, in those of consell he was no lesse with his judgement. But Hanniball (whose rage at Perolla's escape is fitter for immagination than discription) heareing that he had retir'd himselfe into Marcellus Army, immediatly putt his in a posture to attempt the ruine of his publique and perticuler Enemy; but before he quitted Salapia, he came to visit me, & perceiveing my joy in my Face, it inflam'd his to such a degree, that for a good while his choller was vnleagible in any thing else; but at length he told me, Madam, I see with what satisfaction you consider my trouble, & that my Misery is the subject of your contentment, but I hope my Patience at it will instruct yours, or at least induce you not to condemne in another what you practice your selfe, For know I am goeing to Sacrifice a person which my respect & your teares hinder'd me hitherto from performeing, & which by his flight you thinke has escapt for ever; but you shall finde, if my ambitio only inspir'd me with a resolutio that has neere subverted the Roman Empire; my Revenge & my Passion will give me strength enough to destroy a Subject of it, which being perform'd I will injoy you Legittimatly, or if your perversnesse decline that honor, I will satisfy my Flame by an easier though not so pleaseing a way; & beleive me, did not your coldnesse render my Revenge a greater Passion than my Love, I would suspend the former to satisfy the latter; besides, haveing taken you first from Perolla, to kill him, would rather appeare an obligation, than a punishment. Those words deliver'd with an accent as barbarous as themselves were, banisht all my patience, and made me tell him: Thou Monster (greater than thy Country Affrick did ever yet produce) know, that the same Gods which preseru'd Perolla from thy Rage, when thou hadst the Power to act it, will doe the like now thou hast only the designe: he never fear'd any thing of thee but thy Treachery, & if thou makest vse but of thy owne Arme to performe thy revenge, thou wilt sooner furnish him with the meanes to effect his, than create my feare of thine. For my perticuler, be assur'd, that I will cast my selfe into the Armes of Death, farre rather than into Hanniballs, that I have as great a detestation for being thy wife, as thou hast for virtue, and that the same minute in which thou attemp'st my Chastity if nothing else will preserve me, I will free my selfe from Life to doe the like from thee. You shall see (the Carthaginian reply'd) that 'tis easier for Hanniball to act than to threaten, & at his returne he will make you know the greatnesse of his Passion, by his resentments for your neglecting it. He left me (saying these words) and the same day Salapia, but in it, a select Garrison of Libians, rather to keepe Me, than it. Their Commander was one of his trustiest Captaines, who he inviolably protested should answer for me in Torments and Death. This Tyrant was no sooner onn his martch, than some of my Servants having inform'd Blacius I was fallen into such abundant weepings, that vnlesse they were stoppt, they might extinguish my Life, His goodnesse for a while suppressing his aversion, he came to visit me, and being acquainted with those threatnings the Carthaginian had made against my Chastity, he only told me, that he would prevent or not see my wrongs. I knew not what interpretation to giue that profession, 'till not a long while after, I heard one Night a horrid noyse in all the streetes, & the next morning saw them paved with the dead Carkeises of Hanniballs Garrison; my Father then comeing againe to see me, all hidious with blood, assur'd me that Hanniball now might threaten, but had not the power to act his impiety, and that he expected, since for my preservation he had vndertaken so great a hazard, that my duty would be resembling his care. I too-well knew those words related to my Passion for Perolla, which since the impossibility of declineing was as great as the injustice; I thought, that as my silence was the best way of expressing my resentments for his affection, so it was the civilest of assureing him of my legittimate disobedience: I know not whether he imputed it to my respect, or my wilfullnesse, for he went away without speakeing one word, which might be as pertinently attributed to his satisfaction as his Anger. Fowre dayes after the Senate sent a solemne Embassy to him to congratulate his successe, & to furnish him with a Gar, rison to secure it. Though this soone came to Hanniballs knowledge; yet he was necessitated by the Pretor Cneius Fulvius besedgeing the Citty of Herdonea to suspend a while his designe upon Marcellus and Perolla; but to appease so many Lybian Ghosts as were lost in Salapia, and perhapps the losse of Izadora had some share in that Fury, he offer'd the vnfortunate Praetor Battell, whose courage being greater than his judgement accepted it, and by that fault was render'd vncapable of ever commiting any other, being killd with Twelue of his Tribunes, and the most of his Army. That vnhappy Playne neere Herdonea prov'd an vnfortunat Theater for the Fulvius's, two of them in one yeare, both Praetors and both Generalls receiv'd the same Fate in the same Place by the Carthaginian; who rais'd by this accession of Glory, martcht directly to Venusia, where Marcellus and Crispinus were joyn'd, the better to oppose their common Enemy. But because I have not vndertaken Hanniballs but Perolla's Story, I will passe over all those memorable accidents which happen'd that active Summer by telling you that Hanniball knowing Asdruball his Brother (aswell in Glory as in Blood), had crost France and was comeing to him with neere 100000. Men, as a Torrent to throwe-downe all opposition, declyn'd a Battell though often provoak'd to it by Marcellus, who being not ignorant of the danger of two such Men & Armyes joyneing, thought himselfe allwayes too-farre from his Enemye if not fighting with him, resolv'd to remove his Campe to a Hill cover'd with Wood, which lay betwixt this and Hanniballs, and not suspecting his Fate, tooke Crspinus (his fellow-Consull) with him, with 200. Hetrurian horse for their Guard and went to viewe the commodiousnesse of the place, where (alas) there lay in ambush above 1500. Numidian horse, who invironing those vnfortunate Generalls, charged them with so much fury that all those false or tymerous Hetrurians, fledd and left the Two Consulls no hope, but by a glorious Death to justify how vnworthy they were of so privat a one; and that Rome without loseing a Battell, might resent as high a Greife as such a losse could inspire. Perolla (as the Gods would have it) had bin that Night upon a Parry, & was not return'd when the Consulls went to performe so fatall a curiosity; but he was no sooner come into his Tent, than the Allarme of their danger was given by a tymerous Hetrurian, which Perolla vnderstanding tooke the first horse he mett with, & rann full speed to the Theater where this Tragedy was acting, and where the first object he sawe was a Numidian Officer, that comeing behinde Marcellus, ran that great Man thorough with his Launce; but though my generous Freind could not prevent, yet he reveng'd his Death, & by a furious blowe sent that Affrican into the other world; to see how great his virtues were, whome he had so treacherously kill'd in this Perolla having thus Sacrific'd his Generalls Murtherer to his Manes, he rescued first the young Marcellus (his Sonne) & then perceiveing that Crispinus was peirc't with two Darts, and thereby render'd vncapable any longer to defend himselfe, he abandon'd his owne horse, and vaulting up behinde the Consulls, vpheld his tottering body with one Arme, and with the other forc'd his passage through 100. Numidian Swords, and brought him into the Roman Campe, where their feares had so farre clouded their Iudgements, that they only remember'd, but did not relieve their Consulls danger. Never Rome had at once a resembling misfortune, and never was that Empire in a worse condition to sustaine it, and though Hanniball was more satisfyed at Marcellus Death, than he could have bin at the cuting in peices of the Roman Army without it, yet he was so generous as to be content with the joy, without giveing any open demonstration of it: For he first wept the fall of so eminent a person, then, in a military pompe burn't his body, and having put the Ashes in a silver Vrne, and on it a Crowne of Gold; he sent it in great State with a condoleing Letter to the young Marcellus, & executed some Numidians for Offering (by the way) to robb Marcellus Reliques of a Crowne which his noble Life and valiant Death so justly meritted. Spartacus was extreamly satisfyed to observe that Izadora's resentments did not silence hir justice, and that though shee were an Enemy to Hanniball, yet that shee was not so to his Fame & virtue. But (shee continu'd) though Crispinus was mortally wounded, yet his care for the publique was as great as if he had bin to live and enjoy the effects of it. As an evincement of this Truth he sent certaine Spyes into the Affrican Campe to learne what advantage the Enemy propounded to himselfe by his successe; these perform'd their employment so happily, that they brought the Consull word, that Hanniball having an vnextinguishable desire to be reveng'd on the Salapians, and having too, by the possession of Marcellus Seale, which with his body remain'd in the Victors Power, found an expedient to effect it. He had sent false Letters with the true Signett to Blacius, in the dead Consulls name, to let him knowe that that Night he would come to Salapia, & commanded all the Garrison to be in Armes without the Samnite-Gate, for some exployte he intended to employ them in. Crispinus no sooner receiu'd this Intelligence than he sent for Perolla to communicate it to him, and knowing those concearnes he had for the preservation of this place, gave him Commission to command the Garrison, 'till Hanniball had lost the hopes of takeing it. Perolla declin'd it because Blacius was Governour, but the Consull told him, that it was not to intrench on my Fathers authority, but to strengthen him in it; for he was confident Hanniballs assault would be so vigorous, that Blacius could not but thinke so powerfull an assistant a blessing rather than an affront, & that he was no true Freind to Rome, if for a Temporary suspension of his Power, he hazarded so important a place. Perolla findeing Crispinus was vnalterable, tooke horse, and with that speed which Love and Revenge inspires came to Salapia, where he soone found the Truth of the Consulls Intelligence, and that all the Garrison were drawing out of the Samnite-Gate, which was the opposite one to that which Hanniball intended to enter at, and though by his authority he might have hinder'd the Souldiers martch; yet he boare so great a respect to Blacius, that he declin'd it, and rather elected to hazard the ruine of Salapia by not stopping them, then prevent it by intrenching on the seemeing right my Father had, who (he was inform'd) was at his owne house, where he lighted, and comeing in, found him with some of his intimate Freinds (and his vnfortunate Daughter) discourseing what might be the subject of Marcellus designe. But o Gods! what was my astonishment at the sight of Perolla? truely it was so transcending, that I obseru'd neither Blacius's nor his, but the latters being a litle supprest, he addrest himselfe to my Father, acquainted him with the fatall News, the Cause of his comeing, and then presented him his Commission, which whilst Blacius was viewing, Perolla & I were doeing the like to each other, for wee durst not expresse our Thoughts but by our Eyes; yet that silent languadge was as significant & legible as Perolla's Commission, which Blacius had no sooner read, than he whose it was told him, Sir the Consull shall beare me wittnesse, that I declin'd this Authority when 'twas offer'd me, and all Salapia shall doe the like now I have receiu'd it, and if I expect to derive any advantage from it, 'tis only to shew you, that I esteeme it a greater justice to obey than Comand you; thereupon without staying for Blacius answer, in all our sights he tore his Comission in peeces. I canot tell you how great an influence this generosiity had on all of us; But my Father (who a good while ballanc't betwixt his naturall aversion and present Cause for suppressing it) told Perolla, Your generosity is not only greater than I could expect, but than I could desire from an Enemy, and you had more obliged me, in vseing your authority, than in thus declineing it; but though you esteeme it just that I should Command in my owne Government, yet since the Consull does not, I am rather inclind to conforme my selfe to his opinion than yours. Alas (Sir reply'd Perolla) must I be still so miserable, as to beare a Name which I have no title to? and which I detest; & will you attribute that to your Place, which I pay to you? No no Sir all the World shall be Salapia to me, and the Senate cannot give you so absolute a power over me, as my inclinatio does. You are more Civill to me (said Blacius) than the Consull is, & I thinke 'tis my Fate to be oblig'd where I desire it not, and to be injur'd where I expect the contrary; but since you are resolu'd not to command in Cheife, I will immitate your example; let us therfore divide our selves, and the Garrison, & each of us take his halfe of Salapia to defend. I had rather (Perolla reply'd) be neere your person, that you might see with how little feare (to preserve your Life) I will expose mine owne, which I take the Gods to witnesse is not dearer to me upon any score, than out of a beleife that it may be serviceable to you. To convince you (Said Blacius) that the teareing of your Commission has not taken away it's power, you shall (as an effect of it) choose where, & how you will fight; but if my honor were not now enguadg'd to defend this Place, the Romans should knowe that the same instant in which they thought me vnfitt to command Salapia, that I esteem'd my selfe so, to live in it. If the Romans (answer'd Perolla) are so vnjust to themselves, and you, as to thinke you vnworthy to governe what you so generously have conquer'd, I shall thinke them so of my service, and will embrace your interest with so just a passion, that if the Senate send any to vsurpe upon your vallours conquest, I will oppose every Roman, as if he were a Hanniball, and either preserve you in your Command, or not live to see you out of it. Come (said Blacius, without seemeing to heare this last Civility) let us goe, and make Hanniball knowe, that at Salapia he shall have as litle progresse in glory, as in Love. Blacius had no sooner said these words, than he went away, & Perolla (who durst not but accompany him) was necessitated to signify his discontent for not dareing to speake to me by a deepe sigh, which was the Languadge too I exprest mine in; but assoone as my Father was inform'd that all the Garrison was without the Samnite-Gate, & that though Perolla had mett them, yet he had so dangerously declyned makeing use of his authority, he turn'd about to a familiar Freind of his, and told him softly; I feare Pacuvius Sonne will force me to be an Enemy to virtue, if I prove any longer so to him. I need not tell you all the preparatives that were made to receive Hanniball, who about an hower before day, came to the Brutian-Gate (which was Blacius and Perolla's Post) where the Forlorne-Hope of his Army, consisting of six hundred Runnagate Romans (the better to disguise the businesse) were admitted into the Gate, and some 300 Carthaginian horse after them, who were all no sooner enter'd, than the Percullis was let downe, & my Father with Perolla breakeing out of those Houses, and Courts they had lodg'd themselves in, gave the Enemy so briske and vnexpected a Charge, that above halfe of them were cutt in peeces, before the residue could put them selves in a posture to dispute their owne Lives, or revenge their Companions Deaths. I will not amuse my selfe to tell you the perticulers of this action, 'tis sufficient you knowe that Crastinus who Commanded the revolted Romans, knew his Crime was vncapable of Mercy, and therefore resolv'd to render his Death famous enough to excuse the faults of his Life: This made him conjure his Companions so generously to dispute the businesse, as to make the Salapians never mention their defeate but in as many Teares, as if they themselves had dy'd what they were borne. This Traytor acted without his Companions what he desir'd of them, by killing with his owne hand, five of the most considerable Salapians, & then by assaulting Blacius, where Fortune seconding Crastinus despaire, he had certainly ended my Fathers Life, had not Perolla preserv'd it by puting a period to that Traytors; but yet Blacius receiv'd so deepe a wound, that fainting, he was carryed by Perolla, & his other Freinds, unto his owne house, where, lest he might thinke the generous Perolla would take any advantage of visiting me, (by his weakenesse) he immedatly withdrew himselfe to the Brutian Gate, and there found the Combate renu'd by a Carthaginian Comander, who perform'd exployts as farre above beleife, as description: This Enemy Perolla had the Honor singly to fight with, for most of the Garrison were searching those houses where, any of Hanniballs Souldiers had taken sanctuary, and others tooke upon them the same employment, that it might be thought the following the execution (& not their feare) hinder'd their assaulting so valiant an Enemy, who by this tyme had so over-harras'd himselfe, that Perolla who had more inclination to preserve than destroy so admirable a vallor, tooke occasion (by heareing a division of Horse come trampling up the Street) to offer him Quarter; for he thought his Enemy was too-gallant to resigne his liberty to a single Sword, haveing still his owne in his hand to dispute it; neither was he deceiv'd in his conjecture, for the other was so farre from listening to a surrender, or being terrified at that Troope which was comeing towards him, that he reply'd; whosoever thou art, that to give me a good opinion of thy Civility, assurst me thou hast an ill one of my courage, know, that I shalbe more pleas'd to receive Death, than safety from my Eenemyes; and have more cause to be joy'd than troubl'd at this Assistance which is neere thee, for I would not have Maharball curst with so loe a Fate as to fall by one Enemy, which the arrivall of so many will I hope prevent. Oh Gods! (said Perolla extremly surpriz'd) are you then the generous Maharball. I am what I told thee (he reply'd) but lest my being so ill accompany'd might induce thee to suspect the contrary, or that by nameing my selfe thou shouldst thinke I intende my preservation; I will by a generous death hinder thee from justly assumeing that thought; but whilst those I elect for my Executioners are comeing, let me knowe (I beseech thee) who thou art that giu'st me so advantagious a Title? Alas (Sir) said my generous Freind my Name is much fitter to be conceal'd than knowne; it may wound you more than my Sword has done, and perhaps I shalbe lesse injurious in declineing than obaying your commands; but yet, that you may learne 'twas my ignorance made my offence and that I persevere not willingly in the former, to continue the latter; know I am calld Perolla, that same Perolla, whome you so generously reveng'd on the false Oristes, who would lose his Life for you, as he owes it to you, & who now thinkes your preserveing him a misfortune, since thereby he has lift up his prophane Arme against his generous Deliverer; but that you may see I am vnfortunate & not vngratefull, here Sir (said Perolla, presenting him his Sword) this cannot make reparation for what it has acted, but by becomeing the Sword of Iustice, and by spilling some crimminall blood, for haveing shed so much innocent. Maharball was as surpriz'd at this Gallantry, as at the knowledge of him that perform'd it; & being a Prince as great in virtue as in Title, and as loath to be vanquish'd in civiliy as fight, haveing passionatly embrac't Perolla & as absolutely declin'd his present, told him. If I had bin kill'd aswell as I am conquer'd by your Sword, and that you had knowne who 'twas you destroy'd, your Iustice (yet) had bin as great as your courage; For my attempting to surprize a place for Hanniball, where your Izadora is, deserves that Fate: But if you will give credit to a profession which my actions seeme to contradict, I doe protest before those Gods which punish Perjury, that when I could not obtaine Hanniballs permission to decline this attempt, I put my selfe at the head of our first Troops, that if we had bin victorious, I might have conuey'd your Mistris from his passion, or revenge, for both now seeme so equally powerfull, that 'tis difficult to know which of them is the most. But it seemes the Gods would have Izadora derive hir safety only from him, from whome shee does hir felicity, & I attest those Powers, that I am more pleas'd with our Defeate than I could have bin at our Victory, and if I resent any trouble at it, it is to be found in a posture, wherein I must be wholly bound to your goodnesse not to be concluded your Enemy as much as I am your Prisoner, which is a Fate I willingly embrace, for I count it as litle a dishonor to be vanquisht by Perolla, as 'tis a great one, to be so by any other. I should be (Perolla hastily reply'd because those horse were so neere) asmuch much an Enemy to my contentment in beleiveing you were so to me, as to virtue, did I accept of my Portector for my Prisoner; No (generous Maharball) I assure you, you are free, and if you wilbe Pleas'd to take off the Carthaginian, and put onn Roman Colours, 'till I have dispos'd of this Troope, you shall finde I will turne my promises into action, and that where I have any power, it shalbe still employ'd to evidence a gratitude which cannot be greater than what creates it. The Salapians were by this so neere, that Maharball wanted tyme to answer this Civility, and had scarce pulld off his owne Scarfe and taken his Freinds, before they were come up; Perolla immediatly commanded them to follow him out of the Brutian-Gate, to discover whether any of the Enemy were yet about the Walls, which they were no sooner out of, than he desir'd Maharball in Civilities proportionat to the Favour, to make vse of that occasion to retourne to the Carthaginian Army. Maharball embrac't the opportunity and him that gave it him, to whome he said, I am sorry (generous Perolla) that I must receive an obligation from you which I must not publish, but be sure though I am silent I am not vngratefull, & that I shall remember what I dare not speake of, nor hope to requite. That said Perolla) which is the subject of your sorrow, is of my contentment, since it lets you see I ambition no other glory in serveing you, than that of doeing so. 'Twas in as many expressions of this quality as the tyme would permitt, that Maharball and Perolla tooke leave of one another, the first immediatly overtooke the Carthaginian Army which he discover'd by the help of the Day that then began to daune, and the last seemeing to have receiv'd satisfaction in what he never doubted, return'd into Salapia by the contrary Porte, to that through which he went out of it, & then not staying so much as to dresse some slight hurts he receiv'd in the combate & from Maharball, he came to visit Blacius, where having given him an exact accompt of all things but his owne Gallantry against his Enemyes, and to his Freind, he desier'd to receive his Commands if he had any to impose on him, for he was determin'd immediatly to returne to the Roman Campe, lest a longer stay might raise in him a suspition that he came for some other intent than the honor of his service. This fresh evincement of affection wrought so powerfully on a heart which was already ballanceing, that it intirely dissipated that aversion, which 'till then my Father had contracted for him; and to publish a change, which he thought too just to be conceal'd, he told Perolla; You have made your virtve too-well known, to let your professions neede a demonstration to proove their Truth, No generous Perolla, I doe acknowledg you have vanquisht me, and by such noble Armes, that I am aswell satisfiied with my defeate, as you can be with your victory; whose reward shalbe Izadora, assoone as you get Pacuvius consent to be hirs; for whome I have upon your score banisht all my hatred, and whose freindship I will meete, with open Armes: goe then, and perswade him to conferre it on me, but before your departure, let your Izadora know of that conversion which hir Teares & your virtue have produc't. oh Gods! who can tell those Raptures this declaration cast Perolla into? you may in some measure gesse at their greatnesse, when so excellent a Witt, found silence the best way of expressing them; but though his Tongue was vnimploy'd, yet He was not, for he flung himselfe upon his knees by Blacius Bedd-side, kist, and washt his hands with Teares of Ioy, and by a thousand such extravagancyes, was more eloquent & gratefull, than he could possibly have bin in words, which I beleive you cannot doubt, when I assure you that thereby he so mov'd my Father, that he answer'd him in weepeings of the same quality. I will not tell you those few expressions Perolla made after his first irregularities were ended, for they were so disjoynted, that had not my Father bin perfectly acquainted with his Excellent Iudgement, he might have beleiv'd he had oblig'd a madd, and not a greatefull man. At last the Phisitians perceiveing how ill an influence his concernment and joy might have upon his distemper'd body, desir'd Perolla to take his leave, which he immediatly did and to whome my Father againe repeated his enguadgements, and having embrac'd him, & kist his Cheeke (a high marke of freindshipp amongst the Romans) he commanded one of his Servants to conduct him to my Chamber. When he was come to the dore, he sent in to know whether his visit might not prove an offence? I must acknowledge I was infinitly surpriz'd at this Message, and that which contributed most unto it, was that he which deliver'd it, was one of my Fathers exactest observers of my actions: but he perceiveing my astonishment, & not willing any should suppresse it but Perolla, ask't me (smileing) if I would permitt him to come in? This indeed made me suspect, his insolency (not his joy) was the cause of it, and that he was employ'd by Blacius, to learne, whether dureing his weaknesse, I would admitt of Perolla's visits, & in this beleife, I was upon the point of seemeing to decline what I so passionatly desir'd, and of paying one dissimulation with another: but at last Perollas Messenger who fancy'd the subject of my disorder, told me, that since I was silent to his proposall, he would take it for my yeelding to it, and immediatly brought him in, who soone prostrated himselfe on his knees, & did nothing for a tyme, but embrace mine: this brought a great accession to my first astonishment, which yet was rais'd higher, by his saying, Madam, I shall hardly any more exclaime against Hanniball, since he has now more oblig'd than ever injur'd me, for he has furnisht me with an occasion to conquer an Enemy I much more apprehended than himselfe; yes Madam, Blacius has bin so generous as to consider my desires, as if they had bin actions, for the Rewards he has given myne are too disproportionat a returne for any thing else: I beleive Madam, you cannot doubt after this declaration, but 'tis you I intend, a guift as farre above my hopes, as merit. (Thereupon he acquainted me with all that my Father had promis'd him, and then continu'd) But, faire Izadora, may I not feare the knowledg you have of your selfe, and of Perolla, may induce you to condemne his injustice and my ambition, or that you created these hopes in me, only out of a confidence that it would never be in your power to convert them into reallityes? No no (said I interruping him) be not injurious to your selfe, to be the like unto me, for I never gave you expectations out of an opinon that they would never change that name, for beleive me, my Fathers consent can only render legitimate not increase my Flame, which was vncapable of addition since I knew you, and shall be of diminution while you are of inconstancy. Ah Madam (he reply'd) why did not the Gods, when they destin'd me this falicity, furnish me with virtue to deserve it? but since my defects are but indeerings of my joyes, by makeing me derive my contentment from your inclinations (a nobler Cause than merit can be) I will silence my Complaints, & fix all my endeavors to inthrone my selfe in a condition of being vncapable of any desires, by being so of any wants, Yes Madam, I will use such meanes to Pacuvius, that he shall not deny his honor and my happinesse, or if he does, the same minuite in which he deprives me of my hope, I will him of his Sonne: for my condition admitts of nothing but extreames, & I am destin'd (since you have permitted it to my ambition) by possessing Izadora to relish no misery, or by Death to feele none. If (said I) this be your resolve, I shall thinke your obtaineing Blacius consent a misfortune, since thereby he has put it in your Fathers power that hates, to ruine you: Ah Perolla, you shall not leave me with such cruell and irrationall intentions: Pacuvius by denying your contentment will declare himselfe your Enemy, so that your distroying one which beares that title, is rather to please, than to be revenged on him: will you punish Izadora for your Fathers Crime? & will you make me miserable, because he makes himselfe vnjust? No Perolla, rather live, and shew him by an vndisturb'd serenity, that since he has divested himselfe of the nature of a Father, you have suspended the relations of a Sonne, and 'till he assumes the former, that you can lay aside the latter; for the Gods expect not wee should pay obedience to the name of a Father, where he banishes the relation and care of one, and from a preserver becoms a destroyer of his Sonne. I conjure you therefore, before our separation, promise me inviolably, that whatsoever Pacuvius vsage be, you dispose not without my consent of a Life which cannot cease, but by Izadora's beareing it Company, to whome you have a thousand tymes given it, and from whome you cannot take it without an equall injustice to the highest that your Father is capable of; besides I beleive, that Blacius, (who now lookes upon your virtues and actions with an vnprejudicate opinion) will give that to them singly, which yet he seemes to desire might be accompany'd with Pacuvius's consent. Madam (said Perolla) if the apprehensions of his cruelty made me pretend to any right over a Life which I have given you, and of which I againe confirme the Guift, I doe acknowledge it an vsurpation, which you rather reward, than punish, when you declare 'tis yours, and that you have so transcendent a care of it: yes faire Izadora, I will obey your Comands with asmuch willingnesse as justice, and begg you to beleive, that whilst my Life is deare unto you, it shall be so to me, & that I will never vndertake to dispose of it, as long as it beares the glorious Title of yours. I know (continu'd Izadora) that had not Perolla's nature bin of an admirable temper, my Fathers former proceedings might have rais'd some jealousies in him, that what he would have had taken for an effect of his Gratitude, was one of his Malice, and that turning him over to Pacuvius's consent, here (mov'd his hopes to as great a distance as ever, and did it too to make Perolla contract a higher hatred for his Father, by declineing what his very Enemy seem'd to coferre upon him but his generosity was so perfect; that he has often protested those imaginations were as litle on his heart as his Tongue. To hasten to a conclusion, That morning, after I had inform'd Perolla of all things which had arriv'd me since our separation, & of those barbarous threatnings Hanniball made against my Honor (which inflam'd him with an vnextinguishable Revenge) he left me, & having againe kist my Fathers hands, he return'd to the Roman Campe in expectation to obtaine from the Consull a Pardon for Pacuvius reuolt, & an order to enjoy his Estate in Salapia & Capua, which might give his generous Sonne a safe opportunity to implore his consent. For he being then at Tarentum, (a Garrison of the Enemyes; (he durst not trust himselfe to Hanniballs and his Fathers resentments, but at his comeing to Crispinus he found him on the point of yeelding up the Ghost, which he did some few howers after, having first writt to the Senate an ample and just Letter in his praise, which did not a litle contribute to the immediate chuseing of Clodius Nero, Consull, who had marrye'd Pacuvius's Sister, the other Consull was Marcus Livius, whome the People had formerly banisht, and whose service they now implor'd; (a Fate common to vngratfull States & Princes) who not learning Gratitude from Virtue must be taught it from Necessity. The first thing which Nero perform'd was an vnfortunate justice to Perolla's Gallantry, which has bin the source of our second Miseries, For he so truly, and so highly extol'd the whole series of his Nephewes Actions; and perticularly that last of preserving Salapia; (which came to his knowledge by Fame, and not by the Actor) that he procur'd a congratulatory Letter to him from the Senate, (which was a favour he declin'd for Blacius, though his wounds spake his fidelity and Courage, which he would not permitt his words to doe, lest the World might beleive he esteem'd his Eloquence greater than his performances.) This action of the Consulls, whether it proceeded from his embraceing the Interest of his Family above that of the State, or the designe he had thereby to breake that new contracted Freindship betwixt Perolla & Blacius, or his ignorance of the latters generosity in that action, I cannot certainely determine; but this (alas) I too-well know, that my Father receiv'd such deepe impressions of his slighting, which his owne freinds perswaded him was an effect of Perolla's being more ambitious of Glory than of his Daughter, & which Pacuvius's on the other side fomented, and concurr'd in, to breake an vnion which their hereditary malice made them detest, that Blacius who was not so perfectly recover'd of his aversion for Perolla as to be vncapable of a relapse, immediatly tore from his heart a Freindship which began but to take roote: for his spirit was too-high to preserve a good opinion for one, which both his Freinds & his Enemyes acknowledg'd, was greedier of a litle Fame than of Iustice, his esteeme, or Alyance. oh Gods! (said Izadora, raiseing hir voyce) could you finde out nothing but Perollas virtue, to be the cause of Perollas destruction? a misery so much the greater, by how much since that provoakt you it was impossible for him ever to doe otherwise. But Sir (shee continu'd addressing still hir discourse to Spartacus) Pardon (I beseech you) a digression, which the sence of our succeeding misfortunes extorted from me, which began by Blacius comanding me to bannish from my heart a Flame that was not to be extinguisht but with my Life. That cruell injunction had like to have effected both, but I preseru'd the latter because it was inseparable from the former, and though I represented Perolla's innocency as cleere as it was yet Blacius passion had so clouded his Iudgement; that like a false optick, it represented all objects to be of the same colour of the Glasse which was lookt through; and indeede I deriv'd nothing from my attempts but the raiseing of his hatred for me insteed of suppressing his for Perolla; whose trouble I judg'd by my owne, and therefore was almost asmuch perplext to let him know my Fathers change, as I was at it: at length I determin'd by my sielnce to preserve him as long (as might be) from the knowledge of his misfortunes, in expectation that some favourable accident might intervene, which would restore Blacius to his justice, and so Perolla might avoyde knowing he had bin vnfortunate, 'till he were so no longer; but (alas) out of an apprehension of creating his trouble, I continu'd it, for by not leting him know my Fathers suspitions, I deny'd him the meanes of suppressing them; and Blacius not ascribeing his silence to his ignorance of his displeasure, but to a contary cause, so confirm'd himselfe in his jealousies; that the aversion they produc'd has bin ever since vnremoveable. But in this proceeding I could not be more faulty to Perolla, than I was obligeing to Rome, which by his continuing ignorant of what was past, receiv'd a bennefit from his vallor; that perhaps it had faild of, had I acquainted him with his misfortunes; for I beleive they would have necessitated him to have made use of all that Courage to struggle with his Miseries, which he ignoreing he employ'd against Hanniball; for 'twas he that vnder Nero draue him from the Salentines and Apulians, into the Country of the Brutians, 'twas he which was the cheife Actor in those famous exployts at Grumentum, and Venusia, and 'twas he that render'd it impossible for Hanniball to martch any farther than Canusium to joyne with his Brother Asdruball, who having left the Government of Spaine to his Brother Mago, & Asdruball the Sonne of Gesco, had already crost the Perenian Mountaines, all Gaull, & the Alpes, and had with a powerfull recruite of Lygurians lai'd seidge to Placentia: The Consulls on this Intelligence drew lots who should oppose this Torrent, & it fell to Licius, who with neere 50000. Horse and Foote, went to meete so redoubted an Enemy. Asdruball inform'd of it, raises his seidge to shorten the Consulls martch who haveing thereby releiv'd his freinds, was very wary how he dealt with his Enemyes; and though he left Rome to take possession of his Command, he told the great Fabius (who advis'd him to protract the Warre) that he was resolu'd to fight the very first day, being impatient 'till he recover'd his honor by a Victory; or by seeing the ruine of his vnjust Country-men, satisfy himselfe with the joy of a great (though not of an honest) Revenge; yet his intention was better than his words, for at a place of advantage call'd Scaena Gallica, neere the River of Metaurus, he pitcht his Campe, and by winning the Passe hinder'd Asdruballs progresse, who by letters advertis'd his Brother of it (that then lay on the bankes of Aufidus, neere the same plaine of Cannes in which he had wonne his highest Glory) & that in few dayes he would storme the Roman Generalls Campe rather than not joyne with him; but these being intercepted by Nero's Scouts, that Consull by the advice of Perolla to releive Lucius danger, tooke 6000 select Foote, and 1000 Horse, and haveing left the charge of his Army (which Camp't within Tenn furlongs of Hanniballs, to Veturius Philo (his Leiutenant-Generall) in six Dayes by tedious Martches and with exceeding secrecy he came to his Colleague, & was receiv'd into his Campe by Night without enlargeing it, or any Loude demonstrations of joy; where in a Counsell of Warre, it was resolv'd next day to give Asdruball Battell, which Lucius (though provokt unto) had thitherto declin'd: The next morning therefore, a purple Coate was hung up over Lucius pavilion, & Perolla the better to delude Asdruball, desir'd the Generall that a Trumpett might sound in Nero's Quarters aswell as in Portius the Praetors, to make the Enemy beleive that either Hanniball was defeated by the Consulls being joyn'd, or that it was done in policy to supply the defects of their Numbers, the first (if credited) would halfe vanquish them before they fought; and the last (if beleiv'd) would inuite them immediatly to a Battell, which (next to a victory) was most in theire desires. This was much approv'd, and readily practis'd and Asdruball who was perfectly acquainted with the Roman discipline, was extreamely surpriz'd at it, but yet attributing it to the latter, and perceiveing by the Signall) the Consulls Resolutions, he joyfully drew his Army in Battalia, but then perceiveing Lucius Numbers to be increast, and that some of his Enemyes Horses look'd as if they had perform'd a long martch (this being an accident above his expectation) he esteem'd it rather a policy than a dishonor to deferre an enguadgement, 'till he could discover the Truth of that mistery, and in order to this spent, that day in slight Skirmishes, & by Night retreated with all his Army towards the River of Metaurus, from which the succeeding Battell tooke it's Name, but he was follow'd by Nero & Perolla with all the Roman Cavalry & so vigorously prest, that he resolv'd next morning to decide the difference by a pitch'd Battell, lest if he gain'd any advantage by retiring, it might be said a victory was forc't upon, and not obtained by him, and if he were defeated, that at lest he dy'd like Amilcars Sonne, and Hanniballs Brother. The Day no sooner dawn'd (which was the last that so many thousands were to see) than those two great Bodyes which consisted of about 150000 effective men, were drawn up in a posture to determine all disputes; The Carthaginian having the advantage of Number, and the Roman of Resolution, which was sufficintly evinc't by their Enemyes attending the Battell by necessity, and not election. Asdruball plac'd his Gaulls (in whome he least rely'd) in the left wing upon a Hill of impossible accesse: In the right were his Spaniards & Affricans, and himselfe at the head of them; his Lygurians formed the Battell, & his Elephants he bestow'd in the Front of his severall Divisions. The right wing of the Roman Army was lead by Nero, (who was accompanyed by Perolla that Commanded those Thousand Horse his Vncle had brought with him) the left by Liuius, & the Battell by Portius. You cannot doubt the dispute was bloody, if either you reflect upon the courage of the Souldiers, the resolution & conduct of the Comanders, or the Glory & advantages which were to attende the conquerors. Liuius found a generous resistance from the Affricans & Spaniards; Portius from the Lygurians; but Nero and Perolla found more difficulty to come to fight, than I beleive they would after it have found in obtaineing a victory; but whilst they were disputing against a precipice, the scaleing of which was not much lesse difficult than to scale the Cloudes, the last of them perceiveing what disorder Liuius & Portius were in, besought Nero to leave those Gaules to a security which Nature & not their Courages had plac'd them in, & who by the strange hight they were upon, were as vncapable of doeing as receiveing harme, and that he would goe to releive the Consull & the Praetor. Nero soone found the justness of this motion, & immagining by the precipice the Gaules were upon, that Asdruball had plac't them there, rather to amuze than oppose him, yeelded to his Nephews request, & leaveing some 3000 Foote & Horse, to keepe the Gaules at gaze, follow'd him with all the rest; but Perolla with admirable celerity having fetcht a compasse behinde all the Roman Army, fell upon the right flanke of the Carthaginian so opportunely, that 'twas when Liuius was brought to the last exigency, & so vigorously, that by it he courted victory so handsomely, that though shee were declareing for Carthage, yet he wonne hir absolutely for Rome. The execution after the Route was excessive bloody, the Romans remembring how freely the Affricans had open'd their veines, were not vngratefull in their returne. The Gaules too found they had bin more securely fortified by nature, than by 80000 of their Companions, and though the Roman Swords were almost dull'd with blood before they came to them, yet they scapt not absolutely that Day's Fate; but that which brought a large accssion to the Honour of this successe, was the noble Asdruball's fall, who perceiveing his Glory fledd, resolv'd his Life should accompany it, and seekeing some Gallant Enemy to end his, he found none which gave greater markes of that title than Perolla; 'twas therefore upon his Sword he resolv'd to receive it, & 'twas upon his Sword indeed that he found it. I know (continu'd Izadora) that some alleage he had his Death from many an Enemy, & not from a single one, but I know withall that that report had it's rise from Perolla's modesty, who learning afterwrds how great a virtue he had kill'd, rather deplor'd than glory'd in the action. This Battell of Metaurus equall'd that of Cannes, for in it were left 56000 upon the place, 5400 taken Prisoners, and 4000 Captive Romans releas'd. But if in a Relation which my Sex renders me ignoran in, I have fail'd in the former, I have not in the Truth, for my concearne in Perolla made me exactly learne it; neither would I have so perticularly inform'd you of it, had it not so great a connexion to my generous Freinds Story, that in declining it, I must have injur'd his adventures, asmuch as his Glory. The day after this famous Battell, Nero and Perolla martch'd towards their Campe, observeing the same silence & diligence in their return to it, that they had in there leaving of it, for they serv'd Hanniball as we were inform'd you did Varinus; and though he were a Captaine as celebrated, for his policy as his Conquests; yet in this expeditio he never discover'd any light of Nero's martch nor successe, till he sent two Numidian Prisoners to acquaint him with it; & lest that Testimony might not be authentique, he flung his Brothers (the gallant Asdruballs) head over his Trenches: which barbarisme Perolla so much resented, that not being able to hinder it, he abandon'd his Vncle, to manifest he detested the Action; and indeed it was the blaker, because Hanniball had alwayes given the bodyes of his dead Enemyes a Sepulture, & vsage, proportionat to their qualities, & virtue whilst they were alive. Yes (Sir) Perolla was so justly transported at this inhumanity, that though the Consulls in their Tryumph for this victory besought him (who they acknowledg'd, vnder the Gods obtain'd it) to beare a share in his owne acquisitions, yet he absolutely declin'd it, protesting that he was more asham'd at the use they had made of their victory, than pleas'd at the glory of it; and that he declin'd participating in their Tryumph, lest it might be thought, he did the like in their Crime. After this generosity he came to Salapia where he vow'd had not the Consulls cruelty (for Livius approu'd of what Nero had done to Asdruballs head) render'd it an injustice to have shar'd in their glorious entry into Rome; yet he had rather have declin'd the honour of it, than purchast it, at the price of a longer absence. I must confesse, I never till that tyme, thought it was possible for Perolla's visits to become my misfortune, but my hard fate then renderd his so, and I beleive my discloseing to him that which I could no longer conceale, was the more sensible by his being vnprepar'd to receive the stroake, and by his beleife that his new accession of Glory, would have render'd his company the more acceptable to Blacius. Alas, I cannot tell you his extravagancyes at so fatall & vnexpected an intelligence, but I remember they were so exorbitant, that I suspended a while the reflexion on my owne greifes, that I might the more justly deplore his. Blacius, being ignorant of his being with me, came to visit me, when my generous Freinds resentments were in their highest operation, and though my Father upon so vnlookt for an accident, would have retir'd, yet Perolla hinder'd him, by casting himselfe on his knees and embraceing of Blacius's. His sorrowes for a while were silent, which was no small proofe of their vastnesse and reallity, but when they got a passage, they were so eloquent, that had he bin guilty he had done enough to obtaine his pardon, & being innocent, he did enough to evince he was so. Yet (alas) my Father had so exquisitly fortified his heart against all assaults of this quality, that what should have vanquisht him, turn'd to a testimony of his Cruelty. In breif, Perolla observeing that Blacius relisht no reasons for his innocency, resolu'd to convince him of it by a demonstration, & in the rage & greife of so vnxepected a Misery, he rose up, and with Eyes (in which Death were evidently painted) he cry'd out, farewell faire Izadora, I will goe expect you in another World, for I see 'tis impossible to possesse you in this; and since there is nothing but the losse of this vnfortunate Life, which can either appease your Fathers hatred, or cleere my innocency, I am determin'd at that rate to satisfy both. At the end of these Fatall words he drew out his Sword, & turning the Pomell to the ground, he had cast his body upon the point of it, had not I struck the hilte away tyme enough to prevent it; and he not suspecting any thing of that nature, by falling all along gave me tyme to take up his Sword before he rose, and to protest that if he abjur'd not all designes of so black a nature, I would immediatly make use of that weapon for my owne destruction, which he had design'd for his. 'Twas thus I preseru'd a virtue so pure, that if the higher Powers doe not reward it in this world, 'tis certainely because they reserve their recompence for a place where all things are of a resembling quality; & because I so sau'd Perolla's Life, Blacius consider'd that which was an evincement of his integrity, as a premeditated designe to palliate & disguise his guilt; & though his words did not declare what I tell you, yet his actions did, for he instantly comanded my generous Freind to abandon his house, or he would act what I had prevented. Perolla at this cruell & barbarous command cryed out, o Gods! why doe you render sufferings so necessary to my condition, & make me vncapable to beare them? (Then turning to me he continu'd) but Madam, if you are not of your Fathers opinion aswell as of his blood, I shall contemne asmuch his threatnings, as he doe's my affection & allyance, & shall finde in the virtue of one of the Family, charmes enough to defende me from the cruelties of all the rest. Alas (I reply'd interrupting him) are we come to that againe of makeing fresh assurances of constancy? & will you so highly injure the merit of my Passion, as to render it as much an effect of my promise as my inclination? Ah Perolla, be not so cruell, as to thinke my Fathers change is contagious, nor divest me of the consolation I have had in my past sufferings, that they were vndergone with resolution and patience enough, to suppresse all jealousies in you, that I was capable of sinking in the future vnder any burthen of that nature. O Madam (he reply'd) why doe you so infinitly injure my intentions? for my askeing that question was not to resolve my doubts, but to heare my joy repeated, neither can you condemne my imploreing so strong a preservative, when you see, what Misfortunes I am to struggle with. Blacius who perceiv'd what our entertainment was, having repeated his Threatnings to Perolla, commanded me immediatly to leave him, which, before I obey'd I told Perolla; since your Question proceeds from that cause, I shall as willingly satisfy it, as I should have bin troubled to to have done so on any other accompt; know then, that if my Passion for you be a preservatiue against your miseries, you shall be for ever vncapable of any, for your Desires cannot give you so large a possession in my heart, as my affection does, & this justice is so farre from being susseptible of change, that the Gods while they give me Life, & Reason, are not able to alter it. My Father at this assureance thrust me out of the Roome, but he to whome it was addrest observeing he could not have tyme enough to make me in words a retribution of my enguadgement, by lifting up his Eyes, & his hands to those Powers I had mention'd sufficiently confirm'd me that his resolutions, and flame, were resembling unto mine. But (alas) my Love for Perolla had not that power he ascrib'd unto it, for though I had given him pregnant Testimonys of the greatnesse and reallity of it; yet Blacius cruelty had so fatall an influence on him, that his resolution yeelded to his greife, which cast him into so dangerous and long a sicknesse, that for above halfe a yeare he was vnable to leave his Chamber. I must acknowledge, dureing that tyme I was oblig'd to my Fathers rigour, for 'twas by the strictnesse of his watches that I was preserv'd from knowing so sensible a Misfortune. But at last he recover'd, and with his health assum'd a resolution, that he would act such gallant things, as all the Roman Empire should make his perticular satisfaction, or Death, a publique concernment; but his designe was a while suspended, for after the Battell of Metaurus the Plague so violently raged both in the Roman & Carthaginian Armyes, that we hardly knew who commanded the former, and the Generall of the latter spent that whole Sommer neere the Temple of Iuno Lucinia, in erecting a magnificent Altar, with a large Title of all his Actions in Punick and Greeke Carracters. But the same yeare was not vnactive in Spaine, where Publius Cornelius Scipio (who justly acquir'd by his glorious victoryes in Affrick, the surname of Affrican) beate Asdruball the Sonne of Gesgo out of the continent into the Isle of Gades, where he pilladg'd all things aswell sacred, as prophane, & then retir'd to Carthage. The conqueror after having deliver'd up his Province to those the Romans had appointed his successors, return'd to Rome, where he made suite for the honour of Tryumph; this was deny'd him, having never bin graunted to a Proconsull, except to such as had receiu'd that dignity after a Consullship, as it were by prorogation, which (continu'd Izadora) in my opinion was some injustice, and evinc'd the reward was not to the Merit but the Title. But to repaire this repulse, Scipio and Publius Crassus were chosen Consulls, the last being high Preist of the Romans, was confined by the quality of his office to a neere residence to Rome; but the first, begg'd the Senate to permit him to carry the Warre to the Gates of Carthage, which was the most probable expedient to drawe Hanniball out of Italy. This motion had more reason in it than successe, for some that were envious, and others that were fearfull oppos'd it; yet at last he obtain'd Scicily for his Province, with liberty (if he thought fitt) to transport the Warre into Affrick. Perolla a Freind to the Fame and virtue of this great Man, put himselfe vnder his Ensignes, and partly by stratagem, but more largely by his valor, tooke the inexpugnable Towne of Locry, with the two famous Cittadells, as it were in Hanniballs sight. Scipio highly extolld his Courage and conduct in this performance, and pressingly invited him to his Affrican journy, which to the wonder of all the Empire he was admirably provided for, though he had receiv'd neither encouragement by words, nor Actions from the Senate. Perolla, (whose Love and Revenge confin'd him to Italy,) declin'd Scipio's request, but with inviolable protestations, that if his successe drew Hanniball (on whose ruine he was vnchangeably bent) into Affrick, he would not faile there to offer the Consull his Sword and Life. Scipio with this assurance sett Saile for Affrick, and Perolla return'd to Rome, where in open Senate he receiv'd ample expressions of their Gratitude for the blood he had lost, and the victores he had wonne for their Empire; Neither was he long out of a probability of obligeing them at a resembling rate: For Mago, a true Sonne of Amilcars, having reciv'd orders from Carthage to abandon the Ile of Gades, and mony to raise an Army of Gaules & Lygurians to helpe his Brother in Italy, first whipt and crucified the Gadentine Magistrates for holdeing a secrett correspondency with the Romans, and then takeing an eternall leave of Spaine, by his industry, & wealth, rais'd so vast an Army of those two Nations, that the Senate began to tremble, & some to moue that Scipio might be recall'd, which in such an exigency had bin perform'd, if his successes in Affrick had not bin more prevalent for him, than his Freinds in Rome. But though his actions were of a peculiar quality & merit; yet haveing already so much vserpt upon your patience, and having only vndertaken our owne Story, I will passe bye Scipio's Madam (Said my Prince interrupting hir) if I durst in any thing have the confidence to instruct my Desires at so vnciuill a rate as the lengthening of your trouble, it should be in his Story; For though the Fame of that great man has in generalls defus'd it selfe over the whole world, yet I must confesse, I have only heard of his Glory, but not of those perticuler Trophies which compos'd and form'd it. Sir (reply'd Izadora) since you seeme to decline the being inform'd of his generous Aduentures, only out of a beleife that the telling them may prove my trouble, I would by experiment conuince you, nothing can beare that name, or have that opperation with me, which proves a satisfaction to the gallant Spartacus, but that I beleive the relatio wilbe more exact by Perolla's makeing it than by Mine, whose willingnesse to obey you I dare answer for by my owne, since the sympathy betwixt us has bin so great & constant, that I allwayes knew his heart by Mine. My Prince (continu'd Symander) by his silence seem'd to impose that taske on the generous Lover, who observeing it, and having by a handsome expression acknowledg'd the advantagious carracter Izadora had given Spartacus of his Heart, by compareing it to hirs, and protested that he vndertooke the Story to ease hir, and not to improve it; in these tearmes continu'd Scipio's Adventures and ended his owne. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PARTE THE SEAVENTH BOOKE. Quinquereme-Gallyes privatly into Affrick, to Syphax that great Numidian King, who being a neighboure to his new,  & to his intended Conquests, he courted to declare for the Romans, whose victories were so recent, that though at the same instant Asdruball was sent from Carthage to solicite his Freindship for their Empier, yet he at last declared for the Roman, and protested to their Generall, that upon his arrivall there he would joyne interest and Armyes with him. Scipio on this assurance being chosen Consull, hastens into Affrick, but as he was in Scicily, ready for his intended expedition, he receives Ambassadors from Syphax which inform'd him, though not in positive tearmes, yet obliquely of his change. The Consull not only kept this disaster secret, least if it had bin diuvlg'd, the Senate, & his Souldiers feares might have put a period to his voyage before it began, but gave out that Syphax had sent purposely to accellerate his landing, and to acquaint him if he protracted the tyme, he was so intent upon the Warre, that he would upon his owne score begin it. With this joyfull declaration the Roman Army set saile from Lilibeum; But while they are crossing the Mediterranian- Sea, it will not be amisse to tell you the cause of this barbarous Kings inconstancy. The same Asdruball, to whome lately he had refus'd his Freindship, had a Daughter of such excellent Beauty, that Syphax (who was not vnapt to receive the flames of Love) so abundantly admitted those which the faire Sophonisba's Eyes inspir'd; that it made him not only abandon his Faith; but his interest too, and to purchase hir (for shee was bought he offer'd to decline the Romans & declare himselfe Carthaginian. This motion on so emergent a necessity, was greedily embrac't, and Sophonisba deliver'd up a sacrifice for the Publique advantage. For it is certayne the Numidian King had nothing considerable but his Crowne, and shee by that fatall marriage declin'd Massanissa, to whome shee was contracted; a Prince of so much virtue and so, perfectly blest with the guifts of Nature, that I may truly say Sophonisba's preferrment was hir ruine. This Massanissa, was the Sonne of Gala (surnamed the Good) King of the Massesily, and though he were very young, yet by his great courage & wisdome he recover'd his Fathers Kingdome, (inuolu'd in a dangerous and intricate Rebellion) and by wayes which made all the world acknowledge him as worthy of it as by his Title. His next care was to secure his right: (both by succession and Conquest) To effect which, and for the satisfying his inclination, he made his addresses to the faire Sophonisba, whose Father (Asdruball) had so large an Interest in Carthage, that whosoever obtain'd his allyance, might be said thereby to be ally'd to that Empire. The Title of a Queene, and the felicity of such a husband, so pleas'd the Father and the Daughter, that the marriage was assoone agree'd upon as motion'd, and the more to endeere it to the Carthaginians, it was resolv'd that a contract should be perfected, but before the consumation of the Nuptialls, Massanissa should goe in person with an Army into Spaine vnder his design'd Father in lawe, which the young Prince (more troubl'd to abandon his Mistris, than his Kingdome) perform'd, and in that expedition acted things of so transcendent virtue, that Carthage judg'd his merit without his Title, worthy the admirable Sophonisba; but Asdruball having vndertaken that fatall expedition, (being himselfe noe excellent Captaine), mett with disasters and oppositions, which would have render'd his being otherwise of no great advantage; for he began to move presently after the famous Battell of Metaurus, in which I may say Spaine was conquer'd in Italy, for there all the Spanish Hostages were taken, that Asdruball the Sonne of Amilcar had brought with him out of that Country, and by which he kept that warlike Nation in more awe, than by his Garrisons or Army. This successe made the Spaniards consider the Romans as the riseing Sunne, and consequently adore them, so that his Leuying an Army prov'd more advantagious to his Enemyes than his Freinds, for every day they abandon'd his Ensignes in whole Troopes, and put themselves under Scipio's, who was a Generall that in Courage, Patience, and Conduct, was hardly to be equall'd; In a word in one Summer Asdruball lost all Spaine, and Massanissa (perhaps glad of any subject which might returne him to Sophonisba, joyfully abandon'd a great Kingdome to his Enemyes, as hopeing in hir embraces to lose all thoughts of misfortune; but he too soone found his error, for in his absence Syphax (as I told you) had seene Sophonisbe, and so passionatly admir'd hir, that upon his promise to the Carthaginians not only of relinquishing Scipio (who was prepareing to inuade their Counery) but to bring them an Army of 100000 Men; they made of a perticuler allyance a publique concernment, & in spight of Asdruball and Massanissa, (who was asmuch his Ryvalls superior in virtue, as he was his in power) gave that barbarous King the faire Sophonisba, and Syphax no sooner was in possession of his felicity, than proportioning Massanissa's resentments by the greatnesse of his losse; resolv'd to take from him the power of acting them. This perticular malice he made passe at Carthage for an act of publique security, it being a folly (as great as the injustice) to trust an offended Enemy with a Kingdome; therefore the Senate not only approv'd of their new Allyes designe, but furnisht him with additionall forces to expell the vnfortunate Massanissa out of his Country, which Syphax soone effected, his Ryvalls virtue yeelding to his Nubers; but though Massanissa lost his Crowne, yet did he not either his Courage or Iudgement, the first was too-great to sitt downe with such an affront to his Passion, & his Right; & the latter lead him to offer his service to Scipio, who having found how considerable an Enemy he had bin, doubted not but he would prove a resembling Freind, wherein he was not deceiu'd, for the Consull having acquainted him from Lilibeum (where he shipt his Army) that he would land at the Promontory of Apollo, he found Massanissa there with a Gallant Body of Horse ready to joyne with him. Then first action was to cut off 500 Horse sent out of Carthage to interrupt the Romans descent, which Massanissa perform'd as an earnest of his future Service. The next was against Hanno, a young Carthaginian Gentleman, of as litle experience as yeares, who with 4000 select Horse, lay at a Towne of importance call'd Salera. This hasty Comander, Massanissa (by braveing him at his very Gates) tol'd out into an Ambush, then cutt him (with his small Army) in peices, & in the heate of the pursuite, enter'd the Towne with some fewe Runn awayes, which presently. He became Master of. This shewes that Scipio gain'd by the losse of Syphax, for by his defection, he sent him a Freind whose gallantry was more considerable than the others Forces. From Salera they martch'd to beseidge Vtica, a place considerable for it's strength and scituation, but much more for the virtue of the Defenders which indeed was such, that though it were the first Towne attempted, yet it was the last taken, and the Consull would have given his hopes of wining it, to avoyde the disgrace he apprehended of haveing sate downe before it; but Syphax & Asdruball (whom the Carthaginians had made their Generall) by approaching with two Armyes, which consisted of, neere 80000 Foote & 13000 Horse, gave him an honorable pretence of abandoning Vtica, which he redily embrac't, but the winter was so farre advanc't that the three Generalls did nothing in it, but fortify their severall Campes, which were not seaven miles assunder; that of the Romans being excellently provided for, by the providence and liberallity of Massanissa, who Reigned in his Subjects, though not over them; but the Spring being come Scipio, who beleiv'd the naturall inconstancy of the Affricans, the tediousnesse of a winter Campe, the hazard of a Warre whose Prologue had bin vnsuccessefull, and perhaps the saciety of a wife, might be plentifull motives to induce Syphax to decline Carthage by sitting a Newter, sent Embasdors to him for that effect, with hope that if they succeeded not, yet at least the treaty would drawe him into a jealousy with his new Freinds. The Namidian King receiv'd the Embassadors with a magnificence that evinc'd they were not vnwelcome, & sent them back to Scipio with this motion. That if the Romans would returne out of Affrick, the Carthaginians should doe the like out of Europe. But the Consull receiv'd a more pleaseing & advantagious intelligence than this, though brought by the same persons, which was, that both the Carthaginian & Numidian Campe were so ill intrencht, and their Hutts cover'd with such combustible stuffe, that it were a thing of asmuch ease, as glory, to end the Warre in one Night, in breife Scipio held onn the Treaty till such tyme as he had perfectly instructed himselfe in the truth of this information, and the facility of performeing it, both which being convinc'd of, one Morning he commanded his Embassadors to returne & sent Syphax & Asdruball word, that 'twas in vaine any longer to continue the Treaty, since he found all his Army vnanimously bent to make them yeeld to their Mercy, or their Swords; This message blasted the Two Generalls like Lightening, for they had so fedd themselves with the assurance of Peace, that the losse of that hope appear'd as great a misfortune to them, as if they had lost a certaynty; but at last makeing virtve of necessity, they consoal'd one another with mutuall assurances, that as Scipio follow'd the steps of Marcus Atilius, so he would his Fate; but the same Night, the Romans who built their confidence upon a firmer foundation than hope, & prophecies, divided their Army, one halfe Massanissa and Lelius the Generall of their Horse commanded; these were sent against Syphax Campe, to whome Massanissa was an Enemy by two the most enflameing provocations, of a succesfull Ryvall both in Love, & Empire; the other Scipio himselfe lead; The first had orders to assault the Numidians, who lay a Mile behind the Carthaginians, lest if Asdruballs Campe were first on fire, it might be thought a designe, and not a mischance. Massanissa and Lelius martch't two howers before the Consull, and before day so exactly executed their instructions, that all Syphaxe's Campe was in a generall Flame in the sight of Asdruballs, who attributing it to some disaster (for they could not fancy the Romans would attempt the remotest, and so enguadge themselves betweene two Armyes) rann without Armes or order, to the releife of their Freinds; but their Charity was their Ruine, for the Roman Horse of Scipio's division, cutt off all those which rann out of the Campe, and the Legions assaulting those in it, soone kindled as great fire there as that they were deploreing, and goeing to extinguish. The confusion, horror, and execution was transcendent, and though in both places the flame diffus'd it selfe above fower miles, yet 'tis thought there was blood enough spilt to have quencht it; for there were kill'd and destroy'd (what by the Flame what by the Sword) above 80000, & about 8000 were taken Prisoners; 2000 Foote, & 500 Horse were all the serviceable forces that escapt, in which number were the two vnfortunate Generalls. Never did Affrick receive a resembling misfortune, neither did all their Hanniballs victories inspire them with a joy proportionate to the vastnesse of their Greife and astonishment for this losse. But in this high Misery the Barcinian Faction shew'd a spirit vnworthy of it, & not only absolutely oppos'd the sending for Hanniball out of Italy; (which they said would be a greater victory to the Rommans, than that they had so lately wonne) but vndertooke in fewe dayes, (if one of their Family might be Generall) to raise an Army, that at least should not be kill'd like Sacrifices (without resistance) that perhaps might make the Romans acknowledge a succession of victories was aswell the way to Carthage as to Rome, and that none must present themselves before hir walls, but they must be loden with Lawrells as much as Armes. This motion joy'd, and confounded the Senate; but the result of their dispute was, that not to discontent the Barcinian faction, lest they might lose Hanniball, they resolv'd not to recall him; & not to discontent Asdruball lest they might lose Syphax, they gave Asdruball againe the Command of the Affrican Warre, sent Sophonisba as Embassadresse from hir Country, to hir husband, to implore him not to abandon them, when their condition render'd his Frendship an action of Charity aswell as interest; & besought the Barcinian Princes, by joyneing their power & affections with Asdruball, to manifest, that they lov'd the Common-wealth more than they hated their Enemy. In breife Syphax vanquisht with the abundant Prayers & Teares of the faire Sophonisba, and the Barcinians mov'd with the intreatyes and danger of Carthage, so well improv'd the Tyme, that in thirty dayes, they rays'd 30000 Men for Asdruball, who resolveing to repaire or repeate his disgrace, martcht directly towards Vtica, which Scipio, (more intent to vindicate his honor, than increase his conquest) had againe beseidg'd, which the second tyme he was necessitated to leave, and in a bloody Battell overcame Syphax and his Father-in-lawe, as absolutely by Courage, as he had formerly by Policy; the last flying to Carthage, and the other (follow'd soone after by his Queene) into his owne Kingdome. The Consull to husband this Victory better than the former, resolv'd himselfe to attempt Carthage, (the Rome of Affrick) sent a select number to continue the seidge of Vtica, and enjoyn'd Massanissa with all his Numidians and some of the Romans vnder Lelius, to prosecute Syphax. Scipio with his division, tooke many Townes by his Name, and by his Armes, & at last presented himselfe before that stately Citty, which had so long bin a dangerous Ryvall unto his. Tunis a great Towne in the prospect of Carthage, he tooke by assault; but as he was goeing to trye his fortune upon hir Neghbor and Mistris, he was forc't to alter his designe, by the Carthaginians sending out their Fleete to destroy his that lay ill- mann'd before Vtica. By hasty martches therefore he came thither, and so well animated his Souldiers, and secur'd his Gallyes, that his Enemyes only retourn'd to Carthage with six of his Shipps, where their Tryumph was much greater than their Victory. In the meane while Massanissa cary'd by the Wings of Love, Empire, and Revenge, came with his Army into Numidia, where the Masesily, who had never bin but his Subjects, now publiquely declar'd themselves so, and joyneing their Armes to their Princes, martcht resolutely against Syphax, who with 50000 Foote, & 10000 Horse, was comeing to dispute his Queene and his Kingdome: Massanissa and Lelius joyfully accepted the Battell, especially the first, who thought the way's to Empire, & fruition, were but the same. Syphax tought his Men to fight in the Roman order, but not being able to give them Roman hearts, he lost his Army, and his liberty, to those that practic'd the former, and posses'd the latter. Massanissa justly pleas'd with this purchace, and being one who knew aswell how to prosecute as winn a Victory, desir'd Lelius to follow to Citta the Metropolis of Numidia, whether he went before with all the Horse, & his great Prisoner: The Cittizens, upon the Conqueror's approach (who perhaps hated their King asmuch as an vnsuccessefull Cause) open'd their Gates, where the first object that saluted his Eyes was the faire Sophonisba, not as a tryumphant Mistris, but an imploreing Prisoner: Massanissa, who consider'd hir & not hir condition, alighting from his Horse, & immitateing hir posture, desir'd hir to beleive, hir Empire was as great where he comded, as where Syphax did, and begg'd hir if shee doubted so perfect a Truth, to evince it by some Comands. Shee told him that hir inconstancy made hir as litle merit as desire obligations from him, that had shee not thought it a Cryme to have destroy'd hir selfe, by any thing, but by the sentence of his offended Love, shee had, by becomeing hir owne executioner, punisht hir inconstancy & misfortune (the former being the latter) and not liv'd to be so publique a spectacle of Fortunes mutability; that since he was pleas'd to pardon a Sinne that was it's owne punishment; shee besought him 'till hir repentance for hir fault, had created in him desires of affection, or the greatnesse of it, desires of Revenge, that he would preserve hir from the Romans power. Hir youth & admirable beauty, made so deepe an impression in Massanissa's heart; that not only he graunted hir request, but pardon'd hir past inconstancy, and to take from the Romans all hopes of such a Prisoner, he seemeingly, or really at that instant marry'd hir. But Lelius upon his arrivall was inso great a fury, that he had like to have bin the destruction of the Nuptialls, by being the distroyer of the Bride; but Massanissa knew so well how to humble himselfe before that prow'd Roman, and to represent that shee had allwayes bin his Wife, though marryed to Syphax; that he was content to suspend all things 'till they return'd to the Consull, which (after the setteling that great Kingdome) they soone did; There was noe common joy in the Roman Campe at the arrivall of so great a Freind a Conqueror, and so great an Enemy a Prisoner; the first having by Scipio receiv'd in publique a just and ample commendation, & acknowledgement for his transcendent obligations on this Empire; the last was strictly examin'd, what had induc'd him to embrace the Carthaginian Quarrell, having so professedly enguag'd himselfe in the Roman; to which he resolutely answer'd, 'twas the charmes of his Wife, which Truth he was confident e're long, a resembling operation on Massanissa would abundantly cofirme. Whether Syphax spoake this really or in revenge, I cannot tell, but his assertion had so powerfull an influence on the Consull, that rakeing Massanissa aside, he told him ingenuously, the Romans had an vndeniable title to Sophonisba's Life, whome he consider'd as the efficient cause of these Warrs, and therefore conjur'd him, not to ruine the reward of so great services, by committing as great a Crime, which his detention of his new Wife, did & would appeare, in his, and the Senats judgement. Massanissa blusht and wept, but finally begg'd some tyme to worke on his inclination to submitt unto his duty; this civill request, had the desir'd returne, and Massanissa being retir'd into his Tent, spent an hower in an Agony, whose torments nothing but an vnfortunate Lover is capable to immagine, but at length after a serious reflection, that by denying hir, he should deliver both himselfe and Sophonisba into the Roman hands, & perhaps beleiveing, if shee had a reall passion for him, that hir owne Fate would be the lesse bitter by his not being involu'd in it, & if shee had not, the losse was the more tollerable, he determin'd to preserve Hir in his memory, that he could not in his embraces, and sending for an exquisite Poyson, he commanded one of his domesticks to present it from him to Sophonisba, as the only way he had left to keepe his word, & Hir from the Romans. The faire Queene vndauntedly takeing the fatall cupp, bidd the Messenger to tell his Lord, that to manifest, nothing which came from him was vnwelcome, shee would receive from Him the present of hir Fate; which haveing dranke, shee further enjoyn'd him to begg Massanissa, that if the actions of hir life, had impair'd hir in his first affection; that the resolutnesse of hir death might restore it to it's former luster, and that shee might live In, though not with him: then casting hir selfe upon hir Bedd, an eternall darknesse soone clos'd up the fairest lights which ever shin' in Affrick, to which barbarous Country I had not confin'd my similitude, had the faire Sophonisba bin as constant in hir Love, as in hir Death. This Tragedy and the sadd influence it had on Massanissa, no sooner reacht the Consulls knowledg, than he sent for him, & having drawne all his Army in Battalia, in their sight, to repaire the having taken from him Syphax wife, he gave him Syphax Kingdome, saluted him by the name King, presented him with a Crowne of Gold, and by large Elogies on his noble actions, dry'd up his Teares. This truly was the best Cordiall, and those Cloudes of greife by so admirable a Sunnshine of prosperity, were soone dissipated, and he with the Romans martch'd to the seidge of Carthage, from whence, they having heard of Syphax defeate, insteed of sending armed Troopes to meete them, they sent out old Hanno with the Princes of his Faction, who prostrating themselves on the ground, not only kist Scipio's feete, but the feete of those that sate in Consull with him, to whome they acknowledg'd they had vnjustly broaken the Peace betwixt Rome & Carthage, which they besought might continue as a monument of their mercy, and in a resembling series of basenesse, begg'd Peace on tearmes though as Lowe as those spirits that implor'd it. Scipio who knew Rome to be poore though victorious, and Carthage rich though subdu'd, willing to releive the necessities of the former, by the aboundance of the latter, & perhaps fearfull that dispaire might make them continue the Warre longer than his Consulship, & so his victories might prove but the foundation of an others Glory, or else beleiveing so prostrate an Enemy vnworthy his Sword, or esteemeing it more generous to be knowne a Conqueror by the confession, than the ruine of his Enemyes, graunted them Peace, but upon tearmes as long as their submission, and permitted them to send vnto the Roman Senate for their ratification. In the meane time, Mago had rais'd so considerable an Army of Gaullsand and Lygurians, that the Romans apprehended he would kindle as great a flame in Italy, as Scipio had in Affrick. They therefore sent against him Marcus Cornelius the Pro-Consull, and Quintillius Varrus one of their Pretors, with whome I associated my selfe. In short, Mago and the Roman Army, mett in the Country of the Insubrians, where was faught a Battell of asmuch variety & resolution as any since Rome or Carthage were founded: twice the Romans, and twice their Enemyes were embraceing victory, but at length Quintilius, and I, having rally'd the Reliques of our scatter'd Horse, and Mago of his, we resolutely advanc't to determine this bloody dispute; Hanniballs Brother who suspected his men needed some high encouragement, advanc't about an hundred paces before them, & invited the Pro-Consull by a single Combate, to shew they were as prodigall of their owne blood, as of their Souldiers. He not being present, & the Pretor (perhaps) more concearn'd in the publique safety, than in his perticular honor, declineing it, (with his permission) I gallopt up to Mago, told him the Pro-Consull was on an employment which render'd him vncapable of heareing and consequently answering his Challenge, and that therefore I was come (nameing my selfe) to supply his place, that so generous an invitation might not fall to the ground. As soone as Mago heard the Name of Perolla, his Eyes were all inflam'd, & he was so transported with Passion, he had scarce the patience to tell me, that had he knowne of my being in the Roman Army, he had addrest his words to me sooner than to the Pro-Consull, and that the tyme was now come, I must answer for Asdruballs blood or shedd more of it: then not giveing me the leasure of a reply, wee began a Combate of so peculiar a quality, that it produc'd a resembling effect, for both Armyes were so concearn'd in the dispute of their Combatants, that forgeting their owne, as if it had bin by mutuall consent, they became spectators of their Fates, which they thought would be legible in that of their Champions: but why doe I so long protract my relation? let it suffice I tell you, that though Mago's virtue relisht of his Family, yet his successe was Carthaginian, for I having first receiv'd a wound on my Bridle- hand, gave my Enemy so large a one in his thigh, that he fell from his Horse, and had there lost his Life, had not I thought it more handsome to give, than take it. At this victory the Romans gave so lowde a shoute, that most of the Gaules & Lygurians were hardly able to abide it, much lesse their victorious Armes; but the Battell had so long continu'd, that the approach of Night hinder'd the conquerors from makeing any considerable advantage by wining it, & the vanquisht dureing the obscurity, made so long a martch with their wounded Generall, that in two dayes after they came into Lyguria, where he receiv'd the sadd Commands of Carthage without delay to retourne thither, and rather employ his blood to preserve his owne Coutry, than to Conquer his Enemyes. This fatall Summons he obey'd in parte, but his wound open'd so large a way for his soule, that it flew out at that passage, as he was as farre as Sardinia in his returne. This losse the Carthaginians resented at a higher rate than that Battell which was the cause of it: To contract my discourse, I will passe over those Civilities not only the Pro-Consull & the Pretor but also the whole Roman Senate made me, to let you know that those lowe submissions Carthage had made Scipio (which indeed were too humble to be reall) were only to protract the Tyme 'till those two famous Sonnes of Amilcar were come out of Italy for their deliverance; the Fate of the youngest, & his Army, Sir I have already told you, That of Hanniball I am now goeing to relate, and it shalbe in as litle a volume as I can possibly cotract so much Truth, & businesse in, I will therefore in persuance of this assurance passe by all his actios since that famous Battell of Metaurus, & therein be no Enemy to his Glory, which would be more obscur'd by saying he did litle then that he did nothing, & come to his receiving from Carthage the orders for his returne; which though they were the same had bin sent his great Brother, yet he did not cosider them with so philosophicall a temper; for whereas Mago at their reception obey'd them with an absolute resignation, Hanniball by a Thousand extravagancyes exprest his rage, & discontent: but after his fury gave him leave to speake, he cry'd out to his Officers, yet at lest this is plaine dealeing, and more handsome to let their Commands, than their not supplying my necessityes recall me, besides, (he continu'd) Rome nor Scipio cannot now glory, they have sent Hanniball out of Italy, no, 'tis Hanno & his Faction, who not able any other way to effect the destruction of the Barcinians, act it by that of Carthage. But this great Captaine whose providence extended over all events, had in readinessea Fleete for so sadd a Navigation, in which he embarkt his Army, but all such Italians as were not willing to follow his fortune, nor able to flye his power and fury, and had taken sanctuary in that sacred one of Iuno Lucinia, he forc'd from thence, and by puting them to severall ignominious Deaths, did that for them, which they merited of their Country: After so bloody a Sacrifice to the Manes of those Freinds he had left behind, he tooke Ship himselfe, more troubl'd at his abandoning Italy, than at the cause of it, curseing both the Gods and his owne stupidity, that after the Battell of Cannes, he had not lead his Army all hott and bloody to the Walls of Rome, But whilst he is at Sea it will not be amisse to let you know what is done on land. The Carthaginian Embassadors sent to Rome to Ratify that Peace made with Scipio, appear'd so ignorant in what they were sent to conclude, and so vncertaine in their desires, & answers, that the Senate easily Discouer'd their hearts, and found what their presented to be their simplicity, was their treachery: whereupon that great assembly return'd them back to Scipio, by Lelius, who had bin sent to Rome with Syphax. Lelius in a swift Gally accompany'd with his false Embassadors, soone came to the Roman standing Campe, where he learn't that the Carthaginians having certainely heard of that great Army (following too the Famous Name of Hanniball) which was comeing out of Italy, asham'd of their tame submission, & that they had despair'd of their Fate, whilst so fear'd a Generall was to dispute it, and comeing powerfully to their deliverance, had not only broake the Treaty, but by Asdruball their Admirall had taken 200 Ships sent from Sicily to releive the Roman Campe, they being by extreamity of weather cast into the Bay of Carthage; & that Scipio having sent Embassadors to Complaine of so barbarous a violation contrary to the Lawes of Nations, they had like to have bin Murther'd, declareing their Embassy; but haveing strangely escap't that Misfortune, returning by Sea to the Consull, who then encamp't not farre from the River Bagradas, they were encounter'd by the same Asdruball, who lay behinde a Promontory to intercept them, which doubtlesse he had perform'd, had not the Embassadors in a swift Quimquereme-Gally avoyded his stremming, and runn ashore to some Romane Companies which were sent for their rescue, where though they sav'd themselues, yet they lost many of their Attendants and followers, which Affrican proceeding had so incenst the Consull, that he was gone to vindicate it with his Army, which now breath'd nothing but blood and fury. Lelius surpriz'd at this strange & true information, went to Scipio, who he found acting a Revenge proportionate to the greatnesse of those Crymes that made it just: but the Carthaginian Embassadors, he left in the Roman Campe, which then was commanded by Bebius, one of those that had so narrowly scap't in his late Embassy, and though by Lelius he begg'd the Consull by the death of the Carthaginian Embassadors, to let his Enemyes know, and suffer for their fault; yet the generous Scipio comanded him not only to spare their Lives, but immediatly to give them their liberty; for he esteem'd it a nobler way so to reprove their Sinn, than to immitate it. This great Coquest over himselfe was but a prophecy of that over his Enemyes, which now was not farre off, for their great Hanniball, about this tyme landed at Leptis, a hundred Miles from Carthage, which he did to refresh his Men after their Navigation, and to get some additionall forces, especially of Horse, in which he was most defective. Tycheus, & Mezetullus, two Affrican Princes brought him 3000, with which reinforcemet, haveing receiv'd positive orders from Carthage, without protractio to determine their destiny by Battell, he martcht directly to Zama, not farre from the place where the Consull lay, from whence he sent out Spyes, to discover the Romans countenance & strength; some of them being taken, were brought to Scipio, who insteed of crucifying them (which was then the generall practice) comcommanded an Officer to carry them about the Campe, and punctually to shew them what ever they desir'd: this done he sent them back to their Generall, who admir'd at the bravery of his Enemy, & concluded his Army was deficient in nothing, since he was so ready to shew the posture it was in. Hanniball immediately after, (but I cannot tell from which of those two Causes it proceeded) sent to desire a Parly with Scipio, who assur'd him shortly to satisfy his request. The next day after Massanissa (who upon that false Peace was sent into his owne kingdome) came to the Campe, at the Consulls reitterated requests, with 4000 Horse, and 6000 Foote, and the same day I arriv'd there, to satisfy my enguadgement and Revenge. Those additionall Forces gave the Consull so great a certainty of victory, that the next morning with all his Army he remov'd to Nadagara, where mindefull of his enguadgement to Hanniball, he sent him word he was then readdy to discharge it. The tyme & place was immediatly appointed, & those two great Men went out of their Camps to meete one another, each of them with 1000 Horse for their Guarde; and I being desirous to see my Ryvall had the Comand of Scipio's. No sooner were they come to a convenient distance than all the rest makeing a stand, the two Generalls advanc't, and for a while did nothing but veiw one another with mutuall admiration, perhaps to finde out where that virtue lay, which had render'd them so equally famous over all the World: at length Hanniball saluteing Scipio first told him: It had bin (generous Enemy) more advantagious both for Carthage, & Rome, if they had confin'd their Ambitions within the shoares of Affrick and Italy, since the Kingdomes of Spaine and Sicily, about which our Fathers and we have so obstinatly contended, are not a sufficient recompence for that blood & treasure they have exhausted; but though things past are irrevocable, yet they may instruct us for the future, and induce us (by a serious raflection on those dangers wee have expos'd our owne Countries vnto, to conquer others) to beleive it necessary and just, rather with safety to possesse our owne, than runn a hazard of that, for an vncertainty of more: To this temper my experience of the World, & of Fortune has reduc'd me but I apprehend thy Youth and heate will decline these thoughts, 'till thou hast learn'd them in the same schoole; but me thinkes thou mayst by my example be inform'd of a Truth, which if now vnreguarded, thou mayst learne at a more troublesome rate: for I am that Hanniball, which after many bloody Battells, brought my victorious Armes to the Walls of Rome, & how behold here I come to offer Peace unto thee, that thou may'st not doe the like to Carthage? Consider too, the Fate of Marcus Atilius, who for declineing so advantagious an overture, receiv'd a ruine from the Gods, which perhaps attends all those that delight in shedding human blood: canst thou be content Scipio that Spaine, Sicily, Sardinia, & whatever other Ilands lye betweene Affrick, & Italy, be eternally abandon'd by the Carthaginians! 'Tis a glorious bargaine for the Romans, and for our parts, our future quiett shalbe our satisfaction, & the contentment which from thence we shall derive, wilbe an abundant obligation to tye us faithfully to observe the Peace that give's it: but if thou esteem'st all this too-litle; reflect (I beseech thee) how great a hazard thou vndergoest, for the obtaineing of a litle more tha thou mayst enjoy without any. 'Tis now in thy Power to make thy Fate, but if thou stayst 'till to morrow Night, the Gods will make it for thee; let us therefore conclude on this vniversall blessing, and reproach me not the late Treachery of some false-heatred Cittizens of owrs: It is Hanniball that now desyres Peace, which he would never doe, did he not finde it expedient for his Country, & knowing it so, he will alwayes maintaine it, as he did the Warre he began, 'till the Gods & Men did en uy him. (To which Scipio reply'd) 'Twas not (generous Hanniball) the ambiton of Rome which made them take up Armes, but the defence of the Memertines, and Saguntines, their Confederats, which action of theirs, the Gods by the issue of the Warre, have, and will declare was just; for the mutabillity of fortune, I am not ignorant of it, the condition which thou once didst reduce Rome unto, & that which I have since Carthage, does sufficiently evince it, and therefore I would as willingly give Peace, as thou desir'st it, if it were upon Tearmes which might convince the World, tis the Roman Magnanimity, & not the Roman Feare, that graunts it; but by what thou offer'st, thou only giu'st what their Swords have given them already; and whereas I expected, that in recompence of thy Cittizens perfidiousnesse thou would'st enlarge the Articles of their late violated Peace, thou dost exceedingly contract them, and thereby would'st have them Gainers by their Treachery. No Hanniball, those that will have Rome their Freind, must not doe actions vnworthy of that end; and if the Carthaginians breake an Agreement, assoone as they see a probability of building their Fortune, by the ruine of their Faith; they doe thereby instruct the Romans, to reduce them to a condition of not being able to violate a Peace before they grante them one. But (continu'd Scipio) all this I speake to Carthage, & not to Hanniball, to whose desires I will give, what I will deny my owne Iudgement, and that is Peace, provided that my first Concessions be the Articles of it, and that an equall saitsfaction be made for those Injuries wee have sustain'd by their Infidelity. I am not come (Hanniball reply'd) to cheapen a Peace, I come to offer what I esteeme just, & as I have done it at first word, so I will not recede from my first overture; if thou esteem'st it vnreasonable, the God of Battells must be our Iudge. 'Tis to him then (Scipio briskly reply'd) I referre our difference, who I beleive thou wilt finde more vntractable than I am, for he cannot be a God if he favour an Army which comes more loaden with infidelity than Armes, and from whome Victory will flye, least shee be thought as blinde as Fortune. Then the Consull, laying by his serious lookes, told the Carthaginian smileing, but if at my returne to my Army, euery one be aswell satisfyed with this conclusion, as a Gentleman that Commands those Horse (pointing to his Guards) I shall finde as generall a Ioy at the assurance of a Battell, as at the possession of a Victory; and if every Souldier had his resolution and designe, Hanniball would not avoy'd his perticular Fate, whatever the Gods determin'd of the publique. Who is this said the Carthaginian, that is so great an Enemy to Peace, & to Hanniball! 'Tis Perolla (said the Consull) oh Gods (the Affrican reply'd) what strange accident makes him abandon his Izadora? but may I not (generous Scipio) by you fauour, be satisfy'd from his owne Mouth? Yes (said the Consull) I will send him to you, but first I must exact an engadgement from you, and then the like from him, that whatever your discourses be, you shall passe noe farther. I doe (Hanniball answer'd) faithfully promise it, for since I am certaine in so shorte a tyme, to have so many thousand Witnesses of my Revenge, I would not confine the sight of it to so fewe. This confidence (said Scipio) I will leave Perolla to answer, who immediatly shall meete you; then takeing leave of Hanniball, he told him, Remember Carthage pulls downe hir owne destiny, by declineing a Peace, which shee implor'd with Teares, and when I aske no other satisfaction for their Treachery, but to restore what they tooke from us by it. Remember (said the Carthaginian) 'twas Cittizens, not Souldiers which begg'd, made, and broake the Peace, & tis Hanniball you have now to deale with, who intending to keepe his bargaine, will make it accordingly, and has offer'd you what before next Sunne does set, you will repent you have declin'd. The Consull would not heare this reply, but came immediatly where I wayted for him, and there told me the publique transactions, and my Ryvalls desire, which he gave me leave to satisfy, but first enguadg'd me to the same conditions Hanniball had submitted unto; which having faithfully promis'd; I gallopt to the place where he attended me, & where truely I was receiv'd by that great Man, with a Civility, & Coutenance which had nothing of an Enemy, & Ryvall: I saluted him with a high respect, & with an humility proportionable to the difference of our Qualities; but I could not suspende that just hatred I had cotracted against his barbarous usage, to a Perfection greater than that Sinn; which the seeing him so infiinitly increast, that had I not remember'd my enguadgement to Scipio, I had then either ended our differences, or my Life; but whilst I was in those thoughts, they were interrupted by Hanniballs telling me. Is then (Porolla) your Hate greater than your Love, that you abandon your Mistris, to prosecute your Ryvall! or has that high justice of Izadora's, which esteem'd Hanniball vnworthy of hir, taken up the same beleife of you? Sir (I reply'd) that affection which I confesse is an injustice for the faire Izadora to conferre on any Man, forces me to seeke out the high interrupter of it, which yet is noe argument that my desire of Revenge is greater than my Flame, for the cause being alwayes more noble than the effect, my Passion which makes me endeavour to vindicate the object of it, cannot be esteem'd lesse great, than that which it forces me unto: Neither could I by any one action render my selfe more vnworthy the beatitude of Izadora's Love, than in not declineing my joyes, to revenge hir wrongs, which to effect, I will fling my selfe into dangers as high as those pleasures I have lately abandon'd. Ah young Man (said Hanniball) thou art as litle sensible of, as worthy thy felicity: canst thou possesse Izadora's Love and thinke of any thing besides? were I in thy blest condition, nor Revenge, Empire, or Glory, should one Minuite seperate me from a felicity which I could not render my selfe more vnworthy of, than by abandoning: nay, I would quarrell with any thought which should interpose, much more remove me from it: but since thou hast left all to follow thy Revenge, if thou hast the courage to act it, to morrow, I'le present thee the occasion. oh Gods! I cry'd out, if I have the Courage to act it? alas, he that did not want it to vindicate an injur'd Empire, will not certainly, when 'tis to right a perfection as farre above an Empire, as shee is any thing else that's mortall: Yes Hanniball, thou shalt finde, a Heart that's fill'd with so divine an Immage, cannot be capable of so lowe a Sinne as Feare; but on the contrary, 'twill inspire me with resolution enough to seeke thee out, even in the Center of thy Troopes. I will (said Hanniball) spare thee that paines, Thou shalt finde me at the head of them, where I will more handsomely punish those Miseries thy better Starres have cast upon me, and by thy death before 200000 wittnesses, evince thou hadst more fortune than Merrit in thy love, and by destroying the object of Izadora's flame, punish hir ingratitude to myne. Doe but (I reply'd) assault my Life in so generous a way, I will excuse thy attempt upon it by Oristes, and never implore a greater certainty for the punishment of thy Crymes, than to have thee defende them with thy Sword. The apprehension I had (continu'd Perolla) that my Passion might transport me beyond my promise, made me (after having againe summon'd Hanniball of his enguadgement) gallop away to the Consull, who I found (by an excesse of Civility) was become the Captaine of my Guards, as I had bin of his; he made me too, that generous Coplement, and after I had by an humility resembling the Cause of it, exprest my gratitude, I inform'd him (as wee were returning to the Campe) what had past betwixt my Ryvall & me, whilst he was doeing so great an injury to his Quality. As soone as we were come within sight of it Massanissa, Lelius, and all the most considerable officers came to meete Scipio, who told them with a looke which relisht of victory; that the Carthaginians would force the Romans to become their Lords, & by denying them a parte of their Empire, give them a Title to the whole, which the next Sunn should absolutly decide. The Numidian King & all the rest were exceedingly satisfy'd with this Newes, for they were confident, their Swords would give them more, than the Carthaginians. The day therfore no sooner appear'd, than the large Playnes of Nadagara were cover'd with Souldiers, from which place the ensueing Battell tooke it's name though many (but ignorantly) tearm'd it that of Zama; and though I had the honor to have bin in most of the signall actions of my Tyme, yet there were none of them to be equall'd with this, whether you reflect upon the Generalls, the Armyes, or the Dispute, which in effect was to decide the Quarell betwixt Rome and Carthage. Scipio divided his horse in two wings, the Right Massanissa had with his Numidians, vnder whome I elected to serve, because their manner of Fight gave me a greater probability of meeteing with Hanniball, though the Consull offer'd me the Command of the flying Regiment, which consisted of 1000 Roman & Sicilian Gentlemen. The Left Lelius commanded, which was compos'd of the Italian Cavalry: The first Maniples were the Hastati, The next the Princepes, and the Third the Triarij, who were mutually seconds to each other, & only in this the Consull differ'd from the vsuall Roman discipline; for he plac't not the Maniples of his Princepes opposite to the intervalls betwixt the Hastati, that so (as was usuall) they might fall back betweene the Princepes, but plac'd them directly one behinde the other, as it were in file, which was of singuler advantage, for those Elephants that charg'd the Romans, findeing a free passage through the Intervalls, never broake upon the Souldiers, which it seem'd was rather their constraint, than their choyce. The Consull haveing thus drawne up his Army, made them this short speech. If Glory, Revenge, and the Empire of the World, are capable (generous Companions) to bring any accession to your vallors, in this Battell, as in their Center they all meete; your safetyes too, are included in it, for in this barbarous Clyme you have no retreate, so that wore there any Cowards amongst you, they must finde their security in their hands, not in their Feete: for my owne Perticuler, I blesse the Gods, that have made it my Fate to be after this day vncapable of misery, for Death or victory equally, secures me from it and this Battell ended, you may quietly possesse the fruits of it, since if your Swords Conquer this Nation, your Fame will all the others: Remember your Enemyes last action in Italy, was the violating of Sanctuaryes, and their first in Affrick was the violating of Peace: so that their Crymes weigh downe their Armes, and by destroying them, you Sacrifice aswell to the Gods, as to your Revenge: lett us then begin the Charge, & let it be vigorous enough, to make them acknowledge, that their Sinn was not capable of transcending their punishment, that by flying from that Peace which we graunted them, they have asmuch injur'd their interest, as their honesty, and force the Surviveors to shedd as many Teares for having declin'd our Mercy, as they did to obtaine it. Hanniball too was not vnimploy'd, for he knew this day was to perfect, or ruine his Glory. His Elephants (which were above Fowerscore) he plac't in the Front of his Battalions, behinde these was his Vantguard (all Mercenaries) and compos'd of Lygurians, Gaules, Baleares and Moores; his Battell then follow'd, consisting of Carthaginians & other Affricans, more concearn'd in the Quarell but not so valiant maintainers of it. To these were added 4000 Macedonians vnder the Command of Sopater their Captaine, lately sent him by Philip, King of that Warrelike People. More than a Furlong behinde these last divisions, came his Reareguard, consisting of those brave Souldiers, which had seru'd him in his Italian Warres, in whose virtue only he was confident of victory. His Rightwing of Horse, (all Carthaginians) was lead by Mircall, and Barmocall (for the generous Maharball was dead.) Two famous Captaines Tycheus & Mezetullus commanded the Left, which was formed of Numidians. Hanniball having thus order'd the Fate of Carthage, endeavour'd by fewe but powerfull words, to elevate and increase his Souldiers Courages: To the Mercenaries he promis'd Rewards as great as the Quarrell that Battell was to decide. To the Carthaginians perpetuall slavery and Chaines, if by death or victory, they did not avoyde those Misfortunes. But to his old Army, he put them in minde of all that Glory they had wonne, when their Courages effected greater wonders, than would be necessary that day: 'Tis not (he continu'd) your Generall alone that now incites your valors, 'Tis Carthage, Liberty, Glory, your Wives, Children and Freinds, that speake by my mouth, they will thinke you valu'd Italy above all these, if you had Courage to conquer that, and want it to preserve them: No, generous Companions, shew the Senate by the defeate of these Romans, what you had done to all the rest, had your supplyes bin equall to your Merit, and convince them by so noble an Argument, of your virtue, & of their neglect of it. Then turning towards our Army, he told them Observe whether these Numbers equall those at Cannes, Trebia, Tesinum, or Thracimene, alas these are so farre from opposeing you, that their ruine will hardly bring any accession to your Gloryes. Remember this Scipio's Father was the first Captaine we beate in Europe, let his Sonne be the first you beate in Affrick, make your successes runn in a blood, his Souldiers will contribute to this designe, for they are the Sonnes of those Cowards you have so often vanquisht, that you have entayld feare upon their Posterity. No sooner had Hanniball done speakeing, than he commanded his Numidian Horse to begin the Battell, where unto they were invited by a thousand Trumpetts, Clairons, and other Warre-like Musick: The Elephants too were commanded to charge the Romans, but those irrationall Creatures seem'd to reprove the Carthaginians with their violation of Faith; for the greatest part of them turn'd head and extreamly disorder'd their owne Left-Wing; Massanissa so well improv'd so vnexpected an advantage, that he perfected what they had but begun: The rest of the Elephants (which were faithfull to their owne side) made a horrid execution on the Roman Velites, whome they chased through the Intervalls of the Maniples; yet did the Battallions no prejudice, by that excellent prevention of the Consulls, which I formerly mention'd: but divers of those moveing Castles being at length much wounded, turn'd head, and rann furiously upon their owne Right-wing, and thereby gave Lelius the same advantage which they had presented Massanissa, and which he aswell improv'd as the Numidian King: In the meane tyme the Battalions of, Foote of either Army advanc't, with a slowe and confident martch, till thy came within shott, but then giveing a shoute which made the neighbouring Hills to tremble, they rann against each other with a fury worthy their dispute; at first the barbarous strength of the Mercenaries prevail'd over the Roman virtue; but at length the Romane discipline, & resolution, wrough 'its accustom'd effect; for the Princepes by sustaining the Hastati, releiv'd their feare, and disorder; but as soone as the Mercenaries retreated, the new-rais'd Affricans had not the Courage to second them, which the others attributing asmuch to theire Treachery, as Feare, began to flye, but not being able to runn away but through the Intervalls of the Affricans, those either to punish, or hinder their Cowardize, would not permitt them that way of safety: On the other side, the Gaulls, & Lygurians, by not being seconded, and by then being oppos'd, thought themselves betray'd; and esteemeing it a more pleaseing Revenge to destroy their false Freinds, than their valiant Enemyes, made use of those Armes against the Carthaginians, which they had taken up for them, which disorder the Romans soone ended, by involveing both parties almost in a generall ruine. I have (said Perolla) the more insisted on this parte of the Battell, to vindicate the justice of the Gods, For these forces were those only which had broake their Faith, and Peace; & they only were those against whome Fortune so visibly, faught that the Romans were convinc't victory was on their side, because justice was, & indeede they acted their successe with so much ease, that it appear'd the worke of the Gods, and not of Men. But all this while Hanniball with his Italian Army stood firme, and charged His Pikes, and Launces against those Cowards which sought their safety in their Feete, so that they were necessitated to seeke their deliverance in that, by which they had thitherto found it. Scipio perceiveing those gallant Troopes, with as litle feare in their lookes, as Hearts; Hanniball too at the head of them, and the ground over which he was to martch, slippery with blood, and incumber'd with dead Carkeises, was in a great apprehensio, whether martching such an obstructed way, his Battalions might not be disorder'd before he came where he was confident they would most stand in need of their discipline and virtue; but after a shorte debate with himselfe, (for he was blest with an excellent presence of minde) not to lose the victorious heate his Souldiers were in, he commanded the Hastati to wade slowely thorough that Sea of blood, and (as I may say) as soone as they were landed, to draw up all in Front, & if Hanniball offer'd to assault them before the Princepes, and the Tritarij were come up, immediatly to retreae into that purple flood they had made, where the Carthaginians might share the inconveniences of the ground, and where the dead Affricans would assume the Quarell of the Gods and hinder the Liveing. But these directions though they abundantly manifested the Consulls Souldiery, yet there was noe use of them, for Hanniball either disdaineing all advantages from those dead, that when liveing had affoarded him none, the better to set off the virtue of his old Army, or the distance being too great to advance and charge the Hastati, before their Companions came, made that great Man decline it, and so Scipio had tyme to drawe his Princepes and Triarij on the Right and left Flanke of his Hastrati, which was no sooner effected than he immediatly advanc't to charge an Army, who never sawe any defeates but those they had given the Romans, and where he was so entertain'd, that it made the precedent fight against the Mercenaryes, & Affricans, appeare not worthy that name, for the Romans encouraged with their numbers & successe, & their Enemyes enflam'd with the losse of their Companions, the hazard of their Empire, & perhaps with the Glory of haveing the generall safety left to their Swords, so mutually fill'd all places with blood & horror, that I may truly say, the World was well disputed, & Victory was so equally and generously courted, that shee knew not which side to elect; whereby you may in some sorte conjecture what hazard the Roman Empire was reduc'd unto, by the too violent pursuite of Massanissa & Lelius, which I may truly say, I first discover'd, and first made them sensible of; for whilst wee were following those whose lowe resistance made them vnworthy our Armes, we abandon'd those whose resolutions merited our assistance, & whose condition needed it: Massanissa & Lelius were so farre from condemning my confidence, that they acknowledg'd their fault, and after the Battell, confest unto the Consull, that he deriu'd his releife from my care (This I tell you, not to acquaint you with my virtue, but to shew you how secure thy were in their owne). I will omitt (generous Spartacus) informing you how that day I kill'd two Affrycan Captaines, that nameing themselves Hanniball, by deludeing me into a false revenge, deluded themselves into a reall death; It is tyme to retourne to Scipio, who perhaps wee have too-long abandon'd in our Story, aswell as in the Battell: That great Man at our Arrivall with all our Horse, was upon the point of loseing a victory, by our haveing prosecuted one too-farre. To be breife, our returne was most happy, and in a needefull tyme, for the Carthaginian had so well continu'd his practice, that he had left forces enough to prosecute his dawneing successe, and drew a considerable body (aswell for their Number, as virtue) to oppose Massanissa & Lelius, & that which made this litle Army the more formidable, was, that Hanniball himselfe lead them: The gallantry of the Charge was proportionate to the Souldiers, and Generalls, and we were no sooner mingl'd, than I sought him amongst the presse who had promist to be found at the head of his Troopes, but I was soone releiv'd from that employment, by a voice which I heard often repeate my Name, I rann with excessive Joy to the place where I was call'd, in hope that it might be Hanniball; I soone found 'twas no third Counterfitt, aswell by that majestick Grace he had under his Armes, as by the fury of his blowes, which I immagin'd could not be inspir'd but from Revenge, and Iealousy: Our Iavelings workeing noe effect (mine glaunceing upon his his sheild, flew betweene his right Arme & his body, and His past hisseing by my Eares) we soone made use of our Swords, and were so equally annimated, that our rage for a while hinder'd the actings of it; but not to hold you long in a Combate which did not last so, after we had almost cut in peeces those Armors whose goodnesse wee mutually curst, and that we had by light wounds drawne of each others blood, Hanniball who apprehended, that by playing too- much the parte of a Souldier, he should asmuch neglect that of the Generall, determin'd by a powerfull reverse to ende both the dispute, & his Life that was the cause of it; but what he design'd for that effect, might have had a cotrary one, for the blowe was so vigorous, that by chaunce lighting upon a peece of my Helmett, it broake the Sword that strooke it, & left nothing in Hanniballs hand, but the Hilts: Though a peece of the Sword gave me a deepe wound in my left shoulder, yet I no sooner sawe my Enemy disarm'd, than my Anger was so too; but the object of it perceiveing his misfortune, was so farre from being terrified with it, that observeing I declin'd prosecuteing my advantage, he told me, Why dost thou not (Perolla) embrace an opportunity which Fortune has offer'd thee, since thou canst never expect an advantage ouer me, but on such a scoare? those words mov'd me a litle, but not so much as his conditio, so that laying aside Izadora's wrongs, my Coutryes, & my owne I reply'd 'Tis not (Hanniball) from Fortune, but from Iustice that I will derive my Revenge, for since I vndertake to vindicate an injur'd Innocency, I must make use of no wayes but those as virtuous as the subject of my Quarrell: Thy attempt on my Life by Oristes when I could make noe resistance, I condemn'd, and therefore will not proctice a resembling Cryme, since to immitate so lowe a Sinne; were rather to authorize, than punish it; goe then and at our next meeting get a better Cause, aswell as Sword, for if the first be the same, the latter will be the like. Hannibal made me some reply which by the tone I immagin'd was very civill, but I gallopt away from him, endering those words (lest he might conjecture I oblig'd him, to make him my Freind, and lest some Romans might have made a more fatall use of my advantage) and joyn'd my selfe with Massanissa, who had perform'd Miracles that day, which (in a word) concluded with an entire defeate of the Carthaginians, 22000 being left dead upon the place, & almost halfe as many Prisoners taken. Scipio in the middst of his Troopes (upon Lelivs & the Numidian Kings information) came & embrac'd me with trasports which were too great either to be related, or beleiv'd & then ask't me whether I had mett with my owne & our Empires greatest Enemy? I told him I had, and exchang'd some blowes with him, but that wee were soone separated. This I acknowledg'd, but durst not acquaint him with the entire Truth, lest he might have esteem'd that an offence to Rome, which I was certaine was not one to Gallantry; and on the other side, Hanniball either not to owne his misfortune, or out of an apprehension that the discovering of his safety, might endanger him that gave it, ever kept it private, which was the cause that so great a Truth was not a publique one. In this great Battell of Nadagara, or (as some call'd it) of Zama, was determin'd the Fate of Carthage, though Hanniball avoyded that dayes ruine, having perform'd all the virtues of a Generall and Souldier; & where to speake the Truth 'twas (as he said) more the Gods than the Romans that wonne it; for his Two Wings of Horse were routed by his owne Elephants, and had he bin blest with their returne as Scipio was with Massanissa and Lelius's, he had probably prosecuted that advantage over the Consull which their arrivall forc't from him; Many who knew his temper, admir'd, and askt him, why he out-liv'd that losse? to which he reply'd, That the Romans might not too-much glory in it, for to destroy Carthage & Haniball in one day, would have made them prowde with more justice, than they could be condemn'd for being so; that to deprive his Country of himselfe, was to doe more against them than Scipio had, who might lay too-heavy a Peace upon Carthage, if they had lost Hanniball and their Army; that it would have made his Countryes condition appeare more desperate than it was, if he had lost the Courage of not seeing it, and that perhaps the pride of Carthage might be hir ruine, in not making a Peace, when the Gods had abadon'd hir, which he knew shee would embrace when Hanniball himselfe advis'd hir to it. These reasons were as trve as lofty, and to evince they were not excuses but realityes, he went to Carthage with a delerity that manifested his concernement, which place he had not seene from his Child-hoode, and where he was receiv'd according to his virtue, not successe. There he besought them to leave off their Tryumphs, since the Gods had left off giveing them the occasions; & That immediatly they would conclude a Peace with Scipio, and so preserve somthing by a capitulation, lest they lost all by declineing one. A Senator call'd Gesco, who thought it a manifestation of Courage indeed, to shew some, in a season when Hanniball had lost it, began to incite the Senate to a new Warre, by the example of Rome, who had lost hir Empire, had shee lost hir resolution, and that they wanted only a Roman Successe by wanting a Roman magnanimity. But Haniball inrag'd to heare those discourse of Warre, who were as ignorant of, as vnfitt for so dangerous a profession; and were only like Trumpetters, that set Men by the Eares by their breath, but never fight themselves, arose from his Seate, and pull'd downe Gesco out of his, which the Senate resenting, Hanniball (as the faire Izadora ha's told you) so excellently excus'd himselfe by his zeale for his Countryes safety, & so Pathettically declam'd upon the makeing of a Peace, that he obtain'd an excuse for the former, and invited them to embrace the latter; This was the cause that the Consull faycing towards Carthage, was mett by a Gally loaden with Carthaginian Embassadors, who beareing up with the Admirall & useing the gesture of Suppliants, were commanded to wait for an answer at Tunis, where the Consull arriv'd (after having brav'd the prowdest Citty of the World with his Fleete) & where he was advertis'd that Vermina the Sonne of Syphax was advanceing towards Carthage, with a good body of horse, either to bring the fate of that Citty to a new tryall, and Feild, or protract hir Ruine by flinging himselfe within hir Walls. This Allarme the Consull receiv'd as the meanes of an infallible accession to his Glory; & because he had employ'd Lelivs to Rome, with the Newes of his Victory, & that Massanissa in the gaineing of it, had receiv'd some wounds which might have render'd his martch against Vermina, more dangerous than the Combate, Scipio sent for me, And though I beleive he elected me because of those two great Mens being vncapable of the acting; yet with a flattering Complement he assur'd me, his choyce was the effect of his judgement, & not his necessity, that he commanded me to goe against this Numidian Prince, who by his largest Intelligence was not above 8000; That he had selected me 4000 choyce Horse for this expeditio, supplying the defects of their Nubers by the gallantry which compos'd them, & that he gave me so few, that my courage might be the more conspicuous. I will not tell you in what words I cloath'd my Gratitude, I rather was covetous to expresse it by my actions, which the sooner to performe, I went to the Rendezvous, where I found my litle Army ready to Martch: I would not lose that good disposition they were in, but having assur'd them I was as conscious of the Consulls injustice in putting me at their head, as any of them could be, and that I knew them so perfectly that I would make lesse scruple to serve vnder, than Comand over them: I immediatly sent out my Forlorne Hope, which had not martcht Tenn Miles, er'e they return'd me word that they had discouer'd the Enemy, which could not be lesse than 15000 Horse. I told the Messenger that sure they had seene with multiplying Eyes, but yet the greater the Number was, the greater the Glory, and then desir'd my Body to continue their martch a Foote pace, and with Twenty Horse I gallop't to the place where my Advertizers were, where againe they confirm'd their first intelligence, but Vermina had so cover'd his Army that I could not possibly satisfy my curiosity by my Eyes, without beating in a body of 500 Numidians, which I elected with my 250, and perform'd. The fruits of that litle successe was the discovery of our Enemyes Army, which I found was rather contracted than multiplyed by my first Intelligences, this had startl'd me but that I perceiv'd in my litle Troope an augmentation of Courage by that of danger, and in them I found the patterne of the residue, to whome I retreated all the way in view of the Enemy that prest us in all things well but in successe. By that tyme we came in sight of our Body, the Sunn was sett, and Vermina perceiveing so many Horse, tooke them for the Vann of the Consulls Army, (that too, which fortify'd his beleife was, his owne strength and Scipio's care of Intelligence:) in this faith he makes a stand, and judgeing of the Cause of it I resolv'd whilst he was in so terryfying a beleife to improve it to the best advantage, in order to which I sent a Souldier of mine, (as if he had fledd from me) to let Vermina know, that Hanniball was defeated, and shutt up within the Walls of Carthage, and that all the Roman Army was ready to make him a Companion of his Fortune, aswell as of his Cause, this advertisement was given just as I fell onn which was an hower before day, for I would not give it him sooner lest he might have retir'd, & had the benefitt of the whole Night to favour his retreate; I sent also advertisement to Scipio of what I had discover'd, and that he might thinke 'twas my duty and not my feare produc't it, before I had any returne or additionall forces, I began the Battell. The obscurity, the Newes of Hanniballs defeate, & the beleife that wee were all the victorious Roman Army, excellently contributed to our advantage, though the Numidians so resolutly disputed the difference, that above 14300 found their Graves where they thought to have found their successe, but Vermina himselfe was none of that Number, my losse was about 900 and I receiv'd a slight hurt in the selfe ame place that Hanniballs Sword had made one, which was in effect but opening a litle wider, that which was not yet well clos'd up, and consolidated. But the Allarme of the Numidians strength no sooner came to the Consull (who was then visiting Massanissa) than that valiant Prince, who merited a Kingdome from Rome, though hee had had no Title to one, caus'd himselfe to be lead to his horse, and though Scipio earnestly disswaded him from so dangerous a Gallantry, yet with all the rest of the Roman Cavalry, & some Foote, he advanc'd to my assistance. I knowe not whether their appearance was any advantage to my litle Army, (for they came in sight as soone as we could see) but I am sure their actions were not, for they sawe us Conquerors assoone as they perceiv'd us: and their generous Commander, to give those entirely the Glory that had wonne it, would not so much as permitt his Souldiers to follow the Execution, or to share in that spoyle, which had bin purchas'd at the expence of our blood. Indeede the Pillage was great, and their Civility too which had gott it, for they brought me a proportion, that might have asmuch satisfy'd my avarice, as the cause of their being so liberall, did my honor; & though I accepted their present, it was only to deny them nothing, for immediatly I had it all divided amogst those Souldiers, whose wounds disenabl'd them to seize upon what they had purchas'd by them; This just distributio wrought so powerfully on all the rest, that they thought I had only perform'd that actio, to shew them what they had omitted, & in that beleife, they made amogst themselves new Collections of as great a value as the former, which they begg'd me passionatly to accept, for (as they alleag'd) 'twas vnjust I should devest my selfe of what was my due, to repaire their fault; This Gallantry from Common Men was extraordinary, & if I have insisted so long uppon't 'twas to acquaint you withe theirs not my owne. To conclude this businesse, I declin'd the repetition of their Civility, and though it were in tearmes as obligeing as I was capable of, yet I found to have left them rich, was to have injur'd them. Massanissa, after wee had ended the Execution came to embrace me, and to be Civill, he was so vnjust as to protest; that, though Rome had made him a King, & Scipio gave him the Crowne; yet 'twas I (by Vermina's defeate) that had given him the Kingdome. I did not answer this Complement, lest he might beleive I was so vaine as to thinke I had a title to it. I cannot tell you (generous Spartacus) all the Tryumphs & joyes at the Armyes returne, since alas I was torne from them by a storme greater than the reception the Consull prepar'd for us; For as I was within two Miles of the Roman Campe, a Sranger (having drawne me aside as I was rideing with the Numidian King) told me, if I were at leasure to heare him, he had something of high concernement for me from Izadora, who had expressly sent him. That faire Name surpriz'd me, and made me use the Embassador from such a perfection, with Civilities, that manifested the respect I paid hir: after a thowsand embraces I told him, yes my deare Freind, if you come from the faire Izadora, I am not only at leisure to heare you, but to desert all the Glory of the Earth for that of obeying hir Commands. You will (said the Messenger) somewhat confounded with those Civilities at the head of the Army) receive them in this Paper, which I tooke with a transcendent greedinesse, and devotion, & having open'd it, found it contayn'd these words.  or to Death, if the former will haue me, he must returne suddenly or he will finde I am in the possession of the latter, lose no tyme then (generous Freind) since the least delay will leaue you nothing to loue of Izadora; but hir memory, and hir Constancy.  No no (I cry'd out) faire Izadora (having twice reade this letter) I will lose no tyme, but goe and releive you from your Fathers Tyranny, or by my Death remove the cause of it; then turning to the Messenger I told him, come (my Freind) I am ready to obey you,  & Izadora's Commands, and the Gods knowing the justice of my obedience, will doubtlesse contribute to so necessary a duty. Sir (he reply'd) me thinks as yet they doe not favour your desires, for they have tyde you to celebrate a Tryumph, & confin'd you to Affrick by an opposit winde. Alas (said I interrupting him) how ill thou vnderstandest me, to beleive that Tryumphs or the Empire of the World, can one Minuite suspend my serveing the faire Izadora: Nor those, nor the Windes shall stopp me a moment; I'le force the Sea to be my Freind, or Ruine, by perishing in attempting of my duty. Let us goe then; (reply'd Izadora's Servant) That Gally which transported me, is now at Tunis, and expects but our returne; shee has a gallant Ginge, and nothing but a storme great enough to swallow us, shall hinder our arrivall in Italy. Thou rejoycest me (I reply'd) for the best fortune next to our intended Harbour, is a wrack: goe then and prepare all things, that we may set to Sea within this hower, for before that tyme be expir'd, I'le be aboard. The faithfull Messenger without reply, gallop't away, & in an instant, in a cloude of dust wee lost sight of him. But my Passion for hir that merited a higher was so great, that 'till the faire Izadora's Servant was gone, I tooke no notice that Massanissa and all the Army had made a stand, whilst I was receiveing so fatall an Intelligence; to repaire this rudenesse (which nothing could excuse but the cause of it) I rid up to the Numidia King, besought him & who had known the effects of Love, from the faire Sophonisba's Eyes, to pardon those which proceeded from a resembling perfection. That generous Prince at the name of Sophonisba look't pase, & sigh'd, & then told me, he was sadly skilfull enough in the operation of Beauty, not only to excuse what it produc'd, but was bound by his knowledge of those effects, to offer all his assistance to them; & therefore he begg'd me to make use of five excellent Gallyes of his, which lay ready behind the Promontory of Carthage, well man'd both for the Oare, and the Sword; that if Blacius continu'd his Tyranny, I might have where with all to disinguage Izadora from it, & that I should finde a plentifull Sanctuary in his Kingdome which was at my devotion, by my having reduc'd it to his. This transcendent Civility I declin'd with all the submission I was capable of, and assur'd him, that it was by more humble Armes than those he had so generously offerd me, that I would vanquish Izadoras Father; but since by what he had mention'd, he gave me the confidence to implore something of him, I would make use of those humble Prayers, to beseech him, to appologize for me to the Consull, for my instant departure, since an howres delay might be the eternall ruine of a virtue, greater than ever yet had shin'd on the Earth, that my Cryme was the more extenuated by my resigneing those Forces he trusted me with, to the great Massanissa's care, and after they had obey'd his Commands. That virtuous Prince vndertooke what I implor'd, and bidd me not doubt, but Scipio would listen to all excuses of Love from him, but to those which concern'd himselfe: he spoak these last words in high disorders, which the Consulls sadd commands concerning the faire Sophonisba had created. From Massanissa I went to make my excuse to those Troopes I had comanded, who exprest asmuch saddnesse for the cause of my departure, as for my abadoning them. Some of them were so gallant as to offer me their Swords, & Lives, (which they might dispose of, being all Voluntiers.) I would not make use of so obligeing a proffer, but haveing declin'd it upon the same score I had Massanissa's, I immediatly tooke leave, and only follow'd by Strato, I soone lost sight of the Army, and recover'd Tunis, where I found my Gally had weigh'd Anchor, and stay'd upon hir Oares for my arrivall. As soone as I came aboard, I animated the Slaves by Guifts, and promises of excessive rewards, and in the joy of those hopes, they cheerefully began the voyadge; but we had not crost halfe the Sea, which separates Carthage from Naples, when a furious Northerne Winde began to whistle so hollowe, & so lowde, that though it rais'd a storme of it selfe, yet we knew it was but the fore runner of a greater, which soone follow'd, with such extreamity, that the Marriners, and Slaves, were asmuch troubl'd, as the Sea, and as deafe to all my Prayers of continuing their Navigation, as the Winde. But at length findeing the Pilote had put the Gally before the Wind, and was stereing for Tunis, I rann to him, & presenting my Sword to his brest, I vow'd by many horrid oathes, that if he did not change his Course, whatever become of the Gally, he should immediately receive his Fate. That which too increast the horror, was an Ecclipse of the Moone, which those Superstitious ignorant Soules, attributed to a divine forewathing of their wrack, & not to a naturall cause: but I had (whilst studdy was my employment) so great a propensity to Astronomy, and made some such progresse in it, that I knew perfectly the Cause and duration of Eclipses, & having by a former calculation found out how long this would continue, what with my threatnings, what with my enguadgements to them, that if the Moone did not recover hir former luster (which I said shee had only lost, in horror, & detestation of their feare) within Three howres, I would be content to returne with them, I made the trembling Pilote Tacke aboute, and the Gods of the Wind, and Sea, with the Queene of Love, who sprung from that Element, so favour'd my resolution (which had for ende the releiveing of a Duty as faire as shee, and which presented hir more votories than all the residue of hir Sexe) that after the Moone within the tyme limmited, had assum'd hir former light, by a freindly South-wind, wee safely arriv'd in Two dayes at Naples; where leaveing Izadora's Servant, next Night I came post to this Citty, but in disguize, lest the rumor of my arrivall might prejudice the intention of it. Imediatly after I lighted, I went towards Blacius House, to learne by what intelligence I could gett, how to forme my resolutions; and though there was no light in the streets, but what the Lampes of the Shopps, & Windowes did affoard, yet as I was passing by that house Pacuvius vs'd to dwell in; I heard a Gentleman that stood at the Dore, tell his Companion, either I am infinitly mistaken, or that is Perolla which is goeing bye; tother being of his opinio, they immediatly follow'd and overtooke me, & so confidently call'd me by my name, that I could not well deny it; neither indeed would I at any tyme have deny'd it to them, for they were two of those intimate Freinds which had help't me to force Hanniballs Prisons, when Blacius was in them. I was asmuch astonisht at the weaknesse of my disguise, as to finde my Freinds without any, in a place where Blacius comanded, but they silenc't that wonder by a greater: their assurance that my Father was too in Salapia; That the Senate (after Hanniballs abandining Italy) had sent him a Pardon for his Estate, and Life, & were so generous, as to attribute that favour to those services (they said) his Sonne had done their Empire; That the Garrison of Salapia was disbanded, and things were in the same posture they had bin in before the Carthaginian crost the Alpes. All this I heard with astonishment, but being vncapable of any concerne, but my greatest, I conjur'd my Freinds to preserve me vnknowne, to provide me a private lodgeing in one of their houses, and to permitt me a while to prosecute an intended designe. All this (but the last,) they promis'd, and seemeing to know the scope of that, they begg'd me passionatly to be sharers (& serve me) in it: this I as passionatly declin'd, and having taken a hasty leave of them, I went alone directly to Blacius's house, which findeing open, (guided by my Eare) I came into a large Rome, almost fill'd with Company, that then were danceing a Ball, and where the Crowde of Lookers-onn was so thick, that for a good while I could not come to see those perticulers that compos'd it; but as soone as I did, the first object I saw was Izadora, drest in all the shineings of a Bride, and with a Face as full of content, as 'twas of Charmes. Iudge (Sir) continu'd Perolla sepkeing to my Prince) what a perplexity this sight did cast me into, but after the first disorders of it was lessen'd, immagining what I knew to be a reallity, was an illusion, I enquir'd of a Gentleman that stood by me, what was the occasion of so celebrated a meeteing? He (without considering any thing but my Cloathes) answer'd me briskly; of what Country art thou Freind, that art ignorant of it? I told him I was one that dwelt not farre of, & that passing along the Sreete, having heard excellent Musick, I had permitted my Eare to guide me, and was come to heare it, but findeing some things that plea'd my Eyes as well, I was desirous to satisfy them too, & by his favour to learne thir Names that did it. Since thou art a Stranger indeede (he reply'd) I will to the best of my knowledge informe thy curiosity, assoone as thou acquainte'st me with it. I would then (said I) beseech you to tell me, who that Gentleman is which goes so richly drest, & that becomes his Cloathes so well? 'Tis (he reply'd) Flamminius, who is this Night to possesse that Beauty (pointing at Izadara) which cannot be greater than his merit. Oh Gods (said Perolla interrupting himselfe) you only know my disorders at so fatall an Intelligence, but lest the Gentleman, should the better to conceale them I begg'd him to let me know that Beauty's Name? 'Tis Izadora, (he reply'd.) I have heard (said I) that Izadora (if this be the same) was so enguadg'd to Pacuvius Sonne, both by inclination and services, that he only should have marry'd hir. 'Twas, the Gentleman answer'd, generally beleiv'd so, & I am sure hir Father has bin sufficiently oblidg'd to him, to make the Guift of his Daughter the evincement of his Gratitude; but either hir inconstancy, or Blacius's hatred is the cause of these Nuptialls, though for my parte I attribute them to the former, for me thinkes hir Face is too full of joy, to beleive hir heart is possest with a contrary passion; yet beleive me Freind (he continu'd) this marriage will ende in Teares, for I know Perolla's Courage too well to be ignorant of what his resentments wilbe in such an Afront, and therefore I could gladly wish the gallant Flaminius had plac't his Passion on an object as fitt for that honor in all things, as this is in Beauty. I could not heare these sadd words without some sighes stealeing from my Brest, which he that caus'd them observeing, askt me the occasion. I told him coldly, 'twas to finde that the Gods bestow'd the blessing of Beauty, without that of constancy, which was in effect to lay snares for Mens destruction; but to take him off from considering me, and to learne whether there were any suspitions, or beleife of my being in Salapia, I besought him to tell me where Perolla was, for I could not but thinke it Strange if he were a Man of Courage, that he did not employ his, to vindicate such a wrong. Alas (he reply'd) the poore Gentleman I beleive is so happy as to be ignorant of his misfortune: He is now in affrick, where he has obtain'd within these few dayes, a great victory against Vermina (the Sonne of Syphax) who it seemes is successor to his Fathers Misfortunes, and consequently not to his Kingdome: this I was even now told by a Gentleman that came from the Roman Campe before Perolla was return'd unto it, who I beleive when he heares Izadoras Inconstancy, will curse his Fate, that he did not finde his Death, where he found his victory; but I am still of opinion, that he which takes Perollas Mirtles whilst he is gathering Laurell, will shortlly finde them turn'd to Cypresse, vnlesse the forsaken Lover will esteeme Flamminius possessing a Woman of asmuch Inconstancy, as Beauty, a sufficient punishment. I cannot tell you the disorders I was in at these strange discourses, but I can perfectly tell you, that had not he which made them, bin more intent in considering the Company than to whome they were addrest, he had certainely discover'd me; but as I was about to retire to forme my resolutions, (which I could not doe whilst I sawe Izadora, and Flamminius,) I heard a fresh Consort of musick, which presently vsher'd in a Youth in a Saffron Coate, a Crowne of Roses on his Head, & an vnlighted Torch of Pyne in his hand. This I knew was a representation of Hymen, who is the Deity of our Italian Nuptialls, and his appeareing made me soone learne that the intended Marriage was suddenly to be consumated. I withdrew my selfe in the horror of such a sight, and haveing observ'd, Callione (Izadora's Confident) was not amongst the other Ladyes, being perfectly knowing in the Passages of Blacius house, I stoale up to hir Chamber, to be inform'd of my destiny; for though I sawe hir faire Mistris (as it were) in my Ryvalls Armes and embraces, yet I attributed my misery to all Causes, rather than to hir infidelity; which if by a Miracle I should learne from Callione, shee was capable of, I was determin'd to change the Marryage into a Funerall, by killing the Bride-groome first, and then his Murtherer at Izadora's Feete. But Madam (continu'd Perolla with an humble gesture, and accent) though I have as often begg'd & obtain'd your pardon for this Cryme, as I have mention'd it, yet I must still continue that practice; for to thinke 'twas in the power of a Miracle for you to be one, in any thing but Perfection, is a sinne greater than all things, but the Mercy which has forgiven it: In confidence that you have so againe, which I implore with an humility as transcendet, as my offence, I will prosecute my relation, which was so necessarily interrupted at my goeing to Callione's Chamber, where findeing the Dore shutt but not lock't, I gently open'd it, & lookeing in, perceiv'd there was no light in the Chamber, but that there was some in a Closset contiguous to it; thither I softly went, & lookeing thorough a Crevice of the Dore, I sawe Callione leaning upon the Table with a Bole before hir, over which shee wept Teares enough to have fill'd it: so high a melancholly in a house where nothing (any where else) was visible but joy, extreamly surpriz'd me; but I was much more, when I heard hir say to hir selfe, what Callione canst thou then be faithfull to Izadora, when thy fidelity is a Cryme? & when shee makes use of thy affection for so fatall an ende, as to become hir Murtherer? No, no, Perolla doubtlesse wilbe more satisfyed to finde hir in the Armes of Flamminius, than in those of Death; especially since hir being the former, was hir misfortune not hir designe; He will too console himselfe in the knowledge of my Treachery, and pardon it, since 'twas to preserve, what his delay only ruin'd: but (alas shee continu'd after a small silence) thou speak'st Callione, as if hindring hir Fate in this Nuptiall Bole, would hinder it 'till the hand of Age impos'd it: No, shee that has resolution enough to receive Poyson into hir Brest, will not want it to plant a Ponyard there, when the first has faild: what wilt thou doe then vnfortunate Callione? To obey thy Mistris is to become hir executioner, and not to doe it, is to make hir become hir owne, after the Gods too (by a holy tye) has left hir no disposall of hirselfe, and thereby must act hir Murther, by almost as high a Sinne; shee must dye too Flammius'es & not Perolla's, and must detest Thee asmuch as shee will Life, oh Gods (Callione continu'd) you that have brought me into this Laborinth, leade me out of it, and doe not destroy a perfection which suppresse's Atheisme, for nothing can create, but must be more perfect than what it creates, and to be more perfect than Izadora, is to be without doubt a Deity. The faire Calliones Teares for a while interrupted hir words, but the confusion they wrought in me (I attest the same Gods shee invoak't) was so great, that I was in hope, what betwixt that and greife, I should never more have bin capable of any: but those that forme our Destinies, made not mine so favourable, for they render'd my heart stronger than my Misery, & by that tyme they had perfectly restor'd me my Senses, I heard Callione thus assume hir discourse yes faire Izadora I will obey your Commands, the Nuptiall Cupp shalbe poyson'd, but you shall not take it, for I will goe, & acquaint Blacius with your resolves, who shall hinder them in such a way, that you will attribute his care, rather to his doubts, than knowledge; perhapps your despaire may more worke on him, than your Teares have done, and when he findes you elect Death before Flamminius, he may let Perolla supply his place. No Callione, (I reply'd knocking at the Dore) Perolla knowes the Gods, and Izadora too-well, to beleive the former have ordain'd me the latter; if I am come, 'tis to contribute to, not interrupt the marryage. Yes, yes, I am resolu'd to give Izadora up all hir vowes, they have bin too-much hir torment, for me to continue their possession; but if shee be too-generous to receive them by a resignation, I will present them to hir by my Death. Callione hareing my voyce, (after a litle trembling,) open'd the Dore, & hir Eyes had no sooner confirm'd the Intelligence of hir Eares, than shee cry'd out, Is it you indeed Perolla? alas what Teares has your absence cost us? you cannot gesse them, but by the joy of your returne, which reviues my hopes, for the Gods are not so cruell to send you to be a spectator, but a Releiver of our miseries. Thereupon after some other discourses of this quality, to satisfy my intreaties, shee told me; That Flamminius, a Roman Gentleman, who had noe fault but too transcendent a Passion for Izadora, had seene hir one day in the Temple, where from adoreing an invisible Deity, he ador'd a Mortall of asmuch perfection; & being as great in the Riches of Fortune as of Nature, had by some Senators (expressely come from Rome) propounded his Allyance to Blacius, who meeting in him all things worthy it, and your absence contributing a favourable opportunity, greedily embrac't the motion, and Flamminius began his addresses, with so charmeing a Grace, and humility, that nothing transcended both, but Izadora's Constancy, which is not to be extinguisht, but with hir Life. I cannot tell you how diligent shee was to discover an imperfection in hir Servant, that might have render'd hir declineing him, an action of asmuch reason to hir Father, as it was to hir: 'tis too much you know, that though shee had you for hir Patterne (I tell you said Perolla hir flattering expression) yet shee could finde no fault in him, but that in which he resembl'd you most; I meane the greatnesse, and vnmoueablenesse of his Love; In this misfortune to declare the good opinion shee had of his virtue, and to be convinc't of the reallity of it by an experiment, one day shee freely acquainted him with all your Loves, and how fully he might be satisfy'd of the fixtnesse of hir Passion, since He could not Remove it; that therefore shee implor'd him to render that an effect of his generosity, which else would be one of hir Constancy, & that he would turne his Love into Freindship, since shee was as ambitious of that, as vncapable of the other. These words so mou'd the generous Flaminius, that his blood rann all to preserve the seate of Life, his Eyes were fixt in his head, his Tongue was movelesse, and suddenly he fell so at Izadora's Feete, who in a fright rann out, and calld me in to hir assistance; both ours prou'd so powerfull, that after a quarter of an hower, Flamminius came to himselfe, and haveing immediatly begg'd Izadora's Pardon for the incivillity of his indisposition, he only told hir; That either He, or Death would obey hir Commands; and then retir'd to his Lodgeing, where, what reasons he rais'd against his Passion, I am ignorant of, though not of the strange effects they produc'd, for two, or three dayes after, he came to visit Izadora, where he was hardly knowne, & where constantly afterwards if shee were alone, he never mention'd any thing of his Passion, but would only looke fixtly upon hir, fold his Armes, and Grone, and say he was not yet Conqueror. But if Blacius were there, he would court Izadora with a Countenance as full of Ioy, as his heart was empty of it, and if he admir'd at Flamminius pineing away, he protested 'twas an inward disease, but not one of the Minde, nor of Izadora's neglect. This was his practice for Twenty dayes, the Night of the last he came againe to visit Izadora, and in Sighs, & some Teares, implor'd his pardon for his Passion, Importunities, and so long disobedience; & protested that he would shortly so vindicate hir, on himselfe, that shee should acknowledge hir Interests, and satisfaction, were much deerer to him, than his owne Flamminius after those assurces without any more words, immediatly withdrew himselfe, and the next intelligence wee had of him, was, that he kep't his Bedd, of a disease, whose nature the Phisitians were as ignorant of, as of the cure; & that though Blacius by many reitterated, and passionate conjurations, begg'd againe to know whether Izadora's coldnesse were not the efficient cause of his sicknesse, yet he could never receive any other answer, but that shee was not, at least if the Gods impos'd not that affliction on him, for so aspireing a Passion. Six dayes, Flamminius feaver was so violent, that he despair'd not the Seauenth (which in that disease was the first critticall day) but to be able to obey Izadora. Therefore calling to him a Page of his who was his Confident, he commanded him to bring him some Paper, on which (though with much difficulty) he writt thes few lines.  from you Louer makes himselfe your Martyr. Let your Resentments (faire Izadora) Die with the object of them, and be so mercifull as to beleiue, I finde more satisfaction in Death, since 'tis the effect of my obedience, than I can in Life, haueing lost the hopes of what my ambition desir'd, and your justice deny'd me.  strictest Tyes he could invent, to deliver it with his owne hands, and without any witnesse, to hir to whome it was addrest, For if Blacius, or any other discouer'd what it contain'd, he should spend those few howers he had to live, in so much despaire, and horror, that those torments would almost equall Izadora's hate. Iudge (Perolla) if ever Gallantry was rais'd to a greater height, than to have so particular a care for the preservation, of one's owne destruction,  & whether you have not cause to glory in possessing a Beauty, which could produce such rare effects, and in a Constancy that was not mou'd with them, at least noe further than Pitty could extend. I answer'd (continu'd Perolla) Callione's words only with a deepe sigh, that the reflection of having bin cursed with one Ryvall too-full of Power, and another too-full of Virtue drew from me, which made hir thus continue. But though the circumspection of the Master, and the Servant was great, yet it was fruitlesse, for haveing deliver'd Izadora the Letter, as privatly as he was directed, Blacius, who alwayes suspected Flamminius denialls proceeded rather from his goodnesse, than his Truth, and who observ'd an admirable vigilancy over Izadoras actions, was no sooner advertis'd of the Pages comeing to his house, than he stoale to his Daughters Chamber, who had scarcely read hir Lovers fatall generosity, than shee fell a deploreing it with Teares, & in so great disorders, that in the height of them Blacius surpriz'd hir with the cause in hir hands, which he violently snatcht from hirs, and haveing perus'd it, contracted so transcendent a rage for hir to whome it was sent, that his Ponyard was twice out to have quencht it in hir blood; but perhapps beleiveing to kill hir would be rather an obligation, than a Revenge, he resolv'd as the most sensible one he could invent, to carry hir to Flamminius, & force hir to give him some such pregnant evincements of hir conversion, that hee should not doubt it; and which if afterwards shee broake, might render hir as vnworthy his affections, as Resentments. Blacius being thus fixt, comanded a Charriott to be made readdy, in which he tooke Izadora with him to Flamminius's, to whome he commanded hir to be as kinde, as shee had bin cruell, or as he meritted; which if shee declin'd, he protested by oathes (that to be repeated would give one horror, much more to have broaken them) that if he could hier no Murtherers to destroy you, he would doe it with his owne hand, and that then he would force hir to marry Flamminius, or Diana's Numery. The Feare (as shee vow'd to me) shee had for you, the pitty of Flamminius sufferings, and virtue, and the duty to a Father, made hir more incline to obedience than hir owne safety, which the Gods by the condition they had reduc'd hir to, had render'd the least of hir cares. As soone as they were come into Flamminius's Chamber, the poore Gentleman seeing Blacius with Izadora, began to exclaime against the Fates cruelty, and not hirs, that had given him no obstacle but want of health, to enjoy a felicity as transcendent, as hir Beauty. This discourse the generous Lover held, for he was ignorant that Blacius knew the cause of his danger, his Page not dareing to acquaint him with it, lest what was his misfortune, might have bin esteem'd his fault; but he was soone put out of that Faith by Blacius shewing him his owne Letter. oh Gods! who can tell you those sadd words Flamminius vtter'd at that discovery? they were such, that I asmuch admir'd, as comended Izadoras Costancy not to have bin shaken by them. But hir Father who had solemnly sworne that nothing but Flamminius's recovery, should convince him of his Daughters change, withdrew himselfe to a Windowe, lest the dying Lover might attribute Izadora's kindnesse, to his presence, & not hir conuersion. Flamminius perceieving 'twas with designe, insteed of employing so kinde an opportunity, to implore hir Mercy, in receiveing, and cherrishing so pure, and bright a flame, made use of it only to inuoake hir pardon, that the assurance he had sent of his obedience, had prov'd so vnfortunate a duty, and then protested (with Eyes & hands elevated to heaven) that if hir justice would not invite hir to beleive, he intended not to make use of Blacius's authority, hir reason should be convinc't of it, by the demonstration of his Death; and least that might be consider'd as hir act, he would by a letter & before wittnesses, seale with his last breath, 'twas not hir disdaine that produc'd so sadd an effect, but the joy of hir alteration, meeting with a body too-much weaken'd, to receive so transcendent a blessing. This new, and perhapps vnexpected Gallantry, more troubl'd Izadora, than had he made use of that Power Blacius was so wiliing to furnish him with; for shee found it farre more difficult to oppose Virtue, than Persecution; & indeede hir perplexity, was such, that for a while shee answer'd him in nothing but weepeings; which the Generous Flamminius obserueing, and perhapps fancying the cause of hir disorders, begg'd hir to beleive he was more sensible at hir Teares, than shee could be for their subject; that all he said, or hoped for, was but to obtaine a Pardon for what his passion, and misfortune had cast upon hir; that shee would not so much contribute to his Torment, as to manifest shee was sensible of it; nor to his Recovery, as shewing him a Beauty, which was capable of greater miracles. This discourse confounded Izadora, on the one side to distroy so perfect a virtue, and on the other to preserve so dangerous a Ryvall for Perolla, was a strange perplexity; besides to give him hopes, was to cast hirselfe into as great a danger, as shee exempted him from; and to make him despaire, was (by Blacius's vowes) against your Life) to involue you in a resembling misfortune; but at length considering that he had virtue enough, to give hir a confidence that by it, he might in tyme suppresse his Passion, or if that which was so strong in all other occasions, should proove so weake in this, that yet his, and your condition would be but as desperate, as without that Essay, shee resolu'd to save a Life that the Gods (but by Izadora) had not the Power to preserve. In this relation shee told Flamminius (blushing, & trembling) I will pardon you all things, so to dye be not one of them. o Ma- (he reply'd) are my Crymes so great, that you deny me too that way of avoyding farther punishments? No (said Izadora) your virtues are so that I can better suffer your passion, than your ruine. I could not but sigh at those words (said Perolla) but Callione did not, or would not heare me. Ah Madam (shee continu'd, Flaminius reply'd) doe not you thinke me past recovery, and in that faith doe like Phisitians to Patients, which are so, permit them any thing? or may not I feare I owe this preservation to your duty, not your mercy? But I carry my feares too-farre, and make them perhapps as injurious, as my hopes, which have no greater ambition than to have the divine Izadora for the object of their adoration, and that shee will promise me, in the same moment shee forbidds me that felicity, I may (as by hir Comands) end my Life with what gives the relish to it? This (said Izadora, hastily and in Disorder) I promise you. And this promise (said Flamminius kissing hir hand) I doe more joyfully receive, than that health, and life it will restore me to Izadora gave Flamminius that enguadgement, because it was nothing conclusive to your prejudice, and because Blacius (who was impatient to learne the event of their discourse) was comeing towards them, who might have forc't his faire Daughter to a more bindeing one, or to as great a danger by hir declineing it. To shorten my relation, Blacius, though he had many protestations from Flamminius, that his Truth & not his complyance, publisht, that Izadora (as farre above his hopes, as merit) had made him happy, and that his health should be suddenly a visible Effect, & evincement of what he profest; yet upon his returne, he confin'd Izadora to hir Chamber, 'till by Flamminius recovery he was convinc't of his Daughters obedience, which yet he durst not manifest to be his intention before Flamminius, who he knew would revenge any Tyrany upon himselfe, that was impos'd on his Mistris. But upon hir first visit, which was not long after (so powerfull a Charme were Izadora's words) shee was restor'd to that freedome, hir Servant never knew shee had lost; but it was upon condition that shee should receive Flamminius addresses, and the same minuite shee manifested any aversion for them, to be made one of the vestall Nunns of Diana, which you know is a Society that admitts of noe returne to the world, to any that are once enguadg'd in it. If it had not bin for Perolla, this threatning had lost that quality, and the Pennance had invited hir to the Sinn: but shee knew to be in the World, & not his, was as inconsistent with hir inclination as vowes; and that the way was easier for him to follow hir to Elizium, than to that Nunnery; but yet the hope shee had in his Fortune, & Courage, made hir looke as at a distance, though as at a certainty upon the latter, and to dispatch an expresse to acquaint him with hir resolution, if his Arrivall prevented it not. But whether Blacius has heard of this Messenger, or whether his apprehension that your new accession of Glory, (which came to his knowledge last Night by a Spye he kept about you) would make the Senate consider your perticuler, as a publique Concernment, accellerated the Nuptialls I cannot tell; but this I can, that there was noe intentions of them so suddenly, and that Flamminius had never the confidence to aske Izadora's Consent, but contents himselfe with not learning hir aversion for them, & in observeing in hir Countenance, a joy which has not only deluded him, but all those that have consider'd it; but alas it was but the better to palliate hir fatall resolution, which is in the Nuptiall Bole that is offer'd to Venus, to drowne hir Life; or else perhaps shee does not counterfeict: but hir exterior satisfaction proceeds from an eternall one, that shee dyes a martyr for Perolla, and for Constancy, which I hope his Arrivall will prevent, and convert our feares, into nobler passions. For my part, I shall not tell you either the Office Izadora impos'd on me, or the Resolution I form'd on it; since I am confident you have heard both. Yes (said I) faire Callione) I have, and you must practice neither, I will act a part, that will exempt you from acting any. Then lifting up my Eyes and hands I thanke the Gods for haveing comunicated so much divinity to a Creature, & implor'd them to direct my actions, for hir satisfactio, though to my owne ruine. This short Ejaculation finisht, I begg'd Callione, that I might have the felicity to see (and talke one minnit with) Izadora, which shee promis'd, and was no further on hir way towards the satisfying hir Engagement than hir Closet doore, but Izadora came into the Chamber, waited on by Flamminius. Great Gods! what tremblings did that sight cast me into, which I sawe through the crivice of the Doore? I was once goeing to have made him no more my Ryvall, or to have bin his no longer; but the presence of Izadora (and Flamminius virtue) ty'd up my Arme; neither though my Reason had not supprest my Disorders, had I enjoy'd the opportunity of acting my despaire: for the Cause of it, immediatly withdrew himselfe, with so much Grace, & Humility, that I exclaim'd against Fate which had render'd my being his Freind and Izadora's Servant inconsistent. Flaminius was no sooner gone, than shee haveing shut the Chamber Doore told hir Confident; Now Callione I perceive the Gods are determin'd to furnish me by Perolla's absence with what shall evince, that my passion for him, is as perfect, as vnfortunate, I must dye (Callione) and I beseech the Gods to make me as vnfortunate in the other World, as I have bin in this, if I resent any trouble for my Death, but what I apprehende it may create in him; and that by this one argument of my Flame, I am render'd for ever vncapable of giueing him any other; but it may be the cause of my Death may extinguish, or lessen the effects of it. On the contrary Madam (Callione reply'd) 'twill augment them, not only by the losse of the highest perfection that ever was, but by his knowledge that that losse was his, & for him. Let us speake no more of it (said Izadora) my resolution is too just and too setl'd, to be remov'd; for, either 'twill make him love my memory, or follow me; and in this one performance, I satisfy my Duty, & my Love; the first being cancell'd by the hand of Death, the last by goeing to a place where the object of mine may be sure to finde and possesse me; and I have stolne this minuite to let him know so much vnder my hand. For thy particular (Callione) the trust I have impos'd on thee, is of a quality which manifests the greatnesse of it, and this is all I have to enjoine thee, that thou wilt deliver my last desires to Perolla's hands, and that thou will with asmuch resolution see me take the Poyson, as I will drinke it. Come Madam (said Callione) I cannot believe Miracles are ceast since I see your Constancy: retire your selfe into this Closet, where you may deliver me your Commands with more secrecy, which I beseech you to beleive I shall faithfully obey, though I would not any of them with so much Passion, as that of pledgeing you. Alas Callione (said Izadora) thou hast noe greifes which Death alone can ease. I shall have Madam (shee reply'd) when yours are cur'd by that remedy. At the end of these words, the faire Izadora open'd the Closett Doore, & perceiveing a Man there for my disguise hinder'd hir from knowing me) shee cry'd out, oh Callione thou hast betray'd, thou hast betray'd me, but Death hath more Dores than one, and I will trye them all, but I will finde a passage. No Madam (said Callione perceiveing hir Error) your Suspitions, wrong me more, than you beleive my Treachery does you. 'Tis Perolla you see, & vnlesse my presenting him unto you be a Treachery. I am guilty of none, Izadora at that; assurance, consider'd me more attentively, and then continu'd, oh Gods 'tis not Perolla but his Ghost which comes to invite me to a place, where Merit, and Love have no Enemyes, & where a virtuous, and a happy Flame are the same thing. No faire Izadora (I reply'd prostrating my selfe at hir Feete, (for 'till then my distempers were too violent to let me speake) I am Perolla, not his Ghost, and am come to implore your continuance in this Life, not to invite you to another; The Gods will not so much tempt us: to doubt their Providence, as to decline rewarding your virtue, on the same Theater where it has so conspicuously shin'd: for that were to make Sinne, Reason. Callione (Madam) has told me such a story of Flamminius, that you must be the vnjustest Woman in the World, if you make me not the miserablest Man; and that hatred of your Fathers which I thought was the Gods cruelty; I now finde was their care, since it has reseru'd you to a blessing, which nothing can transcend, but my misfortune which builds it. I had continu'd this discourse had not Izadora interrupted it first, by goeing two steps back, & then by saying; This is sure Perolla's Ghost, not he: for nothing but a Spirit deuested of Flesh could entertaine so high a Philosophy; but can you esteeme Flamminius virtues great, that never but hazarded his life to please his Mistris, when at the same instant you make yours your misery, to reward your Ryvall? his performance carry'd it's ease with it, but Perolla's it's torment; had I bin curst with any doubts of your transcending him, this action had cleer'd them, and what you intend for the discloseing of his virtues, doe but the better manifest your owne: neither can you thinke, but that his embraceing your Offer, will render him vnworthy of it; for the receiveing a resign'd up Mistris, is like loseing a life for a Freind, where that act which makes the obligation, imposes an impossibility of gratitude. Ah Madam (said I interrupting hir) he that could dye to please Izadora, merits to live for hir. Observe (shee reply'd) the justice of the Gods, which furnishes me with arguments out of your owne Mouth; for you will acknowledge, to live in Torment is a greater vnhappinesse, than Death, and since you assure me by becomeing Flamminius's, I must make the first of those your Fate, must not a higher Martyrdome, have a proportionat reward? will you make Izadora vnfortunate, because the Gods have made Flamminius Generous? and will you give away what you have given your selfe to? have you not rewarded a gallant intention, by a gallanter? and have you nothing to pay Izadora's debts with, but Izadora hir selfe? Alas Madam (I reply'd they are my debts, aswell as yours, and I beseech you judge of the value I place upon those that oblige you, when I submitt to such a payment. Great Gods! (said Izadora, lifting up hir hands) what have I comitted, that Perolla against Reason, against my Teares, and against my Prayers, will part with me? cruell Perolla (shee continu'd) fixing hir Eyes upon me after a short silence and weepeing, you shall but extend your power over your selfe; you can but deny Izadora to be yours, & recall those vowes you have made hir: you cannot make hir cancell hirs, which were to be yours, or Deaths; the first you willingly exempt hir from, and the last shee therefore as wilingly elects. When shee had done speakeing shee came againe to the place where I kneel'd, and after haveing wett my Face with hir Teares, shee dry'd hir Eyes, and with a looke as cold, as temperate, and as farre above misfortune, as shee was vnworthy any, shee told me: farewell Perolla, farewell forever but before I execute what your cruelty, and my religion renders necessary, I will satisfy you, and Flamminius by my Nuptialls; and after in that Bole, (pointing to the Poyson) or in as certaine a remedy, if that be deny'd me, I will satisfy my duty to the Gods. At the finishing of these words shee left me, as if Life had done so, but observeing hir fatall resolution, and that, to be just to my Ryvall, was to be vnjust and cruell to Izadora, before shee was gone out of the Chamber, I cry'd out to hir, Stay, Stay (faire Izadora) your Life is dearer unto me than Iustice, Gratitude, or all other considerations; & upon better thoughts, I have plac't too-high a value upon Flamminius's performances, that could thinke they meritted Izadora for their Reward, who can finde none worthy of hir, but he that shee raises to that hight by hir esteemeing him so; and since shee has created Perolla to, not found him in that blest condition, let hir impose what Commands shee will on the worke of hir creation, he will either act them, or not surviue his impotency, and disobedience. All that I have (said Izadora returning) to enjoyne you, is, that you leave no meanes vnessay'd (I will not so much wrong you, as to limitt them no further than honor shall direct) to free me from Flaminius, and if those faile, to give me leave to doe it. Farewell Perolla, though I dare embrace death, yet I dare not stay to see the event of your designes. Izadora was no sooner gone, than I begg'd Callione to let me know, whether there were a private Roome, in which I might by hir favour entertaine Flamminius without witnesses, whose virtue shee had given me so large a Carracter of, that I despair'd not to perswade him to abandon a blessing he could not purchase but by as great a Tyrany, I beleive (said Callione) I might bring him into the lower Hall, which is kept empty for the celebrating the Nuptialls; but allow I did, & that his Flame prove greater than his virtue? Ah Callione (I reply'd) doe not doe the latter so much wrong, nor me, as to aske what my resentments will be at so high an injustice. I will not (said Callione) doe my innocence so much, for if I know your intentions, perhaps I might not contribute towards them, but being ignorant what they are, I may serve you without a Sinn: Goe then Perolla into the great Roome pau'd with marble, whereas certainely I will send him as that my Prayers shall attend you. Hir goeing away immediatly left me no tyme to answer, and that litle I had left, was too-pretious to be misimploy'd: I therefore stoale downe to the place I was assign'd, where I had not long continu'd but Flamminius came alone unto me; I besought him first to permit me to lock the Doore, for my intellgence was to be without witnesses, or interruption. This he cosented to, & this being perform'd, I tooke off my disguise, and told him; The Gods shall beare me witnesse generous Flaminius, that I almost esteeme my not vnfruitfull Passion to Izadora a misfortune, since I feare it may deny me a Freindship, which is a blessing next to hirs I should be most ambitious of and most cherrish; For you have bin my Ryvall in so handsome a way, that I must acknowledge hir declineing the giveing you yet a more advantagious Name, is as great a demonstration of hir partiality, as of my happinesse; I have too, bin so bold as to tell hir this truth in your behalfe, and some things more as hard to be credited, as perhaps they were to be spoaken. Yes Flamminius I have bin your Advocate against my selfe, and have passionatly pleaded your Cause, with hope of successe, though I know I could not obtaine it, but by my eternall ruine; Neither should I now have alter'd that practice, were not Izadora's Life the Cause of it, who more constant to hir Vowes, than hir Felicity, preferrs Perolla, or Death before Flamminius; so that the latter cannot attempt to be hir Husband, but he will necessitate hir to be hir owne Executioner, & by so fatall a perseverance, not only extinguish the fairest light that ever shin'd, but make your selfe so guilty to your selfe, that should Izadora want Freinds to revenge your cruelty, your Conscience would assume that part, and act it with asmuch certainty, as horror. There is glory Flamminius aswell as Reason in declineing one Blessing, for a greater, & of two evills you choose the least, when you elect your owne Ruine before Izadoras; Neither should I ever have had the confidence to begg this of you, had I not begg'd more for you, and were I only to receive the fruite of your virtue, I would never have implor'd it: For Blacius, being as constant in his Hate, as I am in my Love, I shall remove noe obstacle by removeing my Ryvall; but remaine at as great a distance from my happinesse, though you decline possessing it, as I shall be if you act the contrary. I will not tell you (Sir) what were Flaminius astonishments, both at learning who I was, and my requests; for they were indeed of a quality fitter to be immagin'd than related: but his answer (after a litle silence) was this. Though I only know Perolla by report yet I beleive him such as he is describ'd, but had I bin as ignorant of his actions as his Person, I must have concluded them both excellent (I tell you said Perolla) true, though not the Truth) since they had charmes sufficient to captivate Izadora, who haveing hir owne perfections to trye others by, evinces his to be great, since they were esteem'd so by hir. This faith (when I first sawe Izadora) made me esteeme my enguadgeing my selfe in hir service, and becomeing your Ryvall, an action of as litle justice, as hope: but that Beauty which is the cause of my Flame, must be the appology of it, which would need none to any but Perolla; and lest he might beleive the distance betwixt him, and Blacius, did create my expectations of a neerenesse betwixt his admirable Daughter, and me, I declin'd all armes to conquer hir with, but those you made use of, and would be oblig'd to Blacius for nothing, but his wishes, and the opportunity of makeing my addresses. What their successe have bin by the mercy of hir to whome they were pay'd is visible in this Nights preparations & in Izadora's: neither by hir commands nor by hir lookes opposeing them. So that though I should credit Perolla in all things as an Oracle, yet I must looke upon what he now alleadges, as proceeding sooner from his Despaire, than Truth, and beleive since Art in Love is rather a Virtue, than a Cryme, that he considering of it in that quality, do's make use of it to distroy what Izadora's Mercy, & Duty, have elected to conferre on Flamminius, to the prejudice (perhaps) of hir Inclination, and of hir Reason. If (I reply'd) I am troubl'd at your not beleiveing me, it is only by knowing what prejudice it may involue Izadora in; to whome you have hitherto bin so civill, that I am upon that Score vncapable of resenting any thing from you, as an injury to me, which does not absolutely prove one to hir; and if there be any Art in speaking Truth, what I have alleadg'd is abundantly replenisht with it, for by Izadora (an oath I hold in too-much veneration to violate) what I have told you is a reall Truth, and, is only in designe to preserve you from a Sinne, the very thought whereof doth make me tremble. You must pardon me Perolla (said Flamminius interrupting me) if I cannot raise my Faith so farre above my reason. Alas (I reply'd) I must of necessity be oblig'd only to your Faith, for your doubts are of so sadd a nature, that if reason and demonstration only must remove them, the very performance which does it, will render you vncapable of makeing any advantage by their suppression, and the knowledge of your mistake. No Perolla (said Flamminius) I have not bin so rude an Admirer of Izadora, as not before now to have convinc't hir, that I preferre my obedience, before my Death, and when to manifest that reality, I had almost made use of a demonstration, I would not againe returne to life, (lest hir enjoyning me it might have proceeded from hir duty, or hir present pitty) 'till shee had faithfully enguadg'd hir selfe, to permitt my Death, when shee would no longer my Passion; so that haveing given hir the power, when shee has the will to be free from my Flame, I cannot consider you now, but as your owne, and not Izadora's Agent. Alas Flamminius (I answer'd) that which you build upon the Cause of your Confidence, wilbe of our Misery, and hir ruine; for the enguagment Izadora gave you, the invitation to which was your virtue, with the condition you were in, when shee gave it you, and hir feare of what you may doe, by what you have done, makes hir elect hir owne Death, rather than avoyde it by yours; so that what you chose to evince your respect by, turnes to a Tyranny: but let hir generosity instruct yours, & remember it can be but virtuous to immitate Izadora. You make me (said Flamminius) happy whether I doe, or doe not credit you, for if the latter by my choyce, there is nothing since I spoake with you that troubles me, and consequently I am in joyes of hopes, 'till those of fruition converts them into greater: and if the former, I must be convinc't that Izadora loves Flamminius better than hir selfe; but yet (he continu'd) were I assur'd so fatall a proofe, must certify that Truth, I should be lesse vnfortunate in hir hate, than hir esteeme; besides (he continu'd prepareing himselfe to leave me) Izadora knowing hir death, will be so farre from preventing, that it will but accellerate mine. I must againe (Perolla) begg your Pardon for not crediting your vowes, which you may graunt with the lesse reluctancy, since my vnbeleife is with Reason and against my selfe. Then (I reply'd) staying him, and drawing my Ponyard, which was all the Armes I had then about me, you must either oblige me so much as not to let me live to see you restor'd to a better opinion of me by so black an Experiment; or You must not Live to be Izadora's Death; which, were I not certaine your intended Nuptialls would prove, I had rather make use of my hand against my selfe, than Flamminius. Since (said he, vnsheathing his Ponyard, which was a weapon all Gentlemen constantly wore in those tymes) you will force me to dispute Izadora by my Armes aswell as by my services, I make no question but to prove as successefull in the First, as I have bin in the last. Wee had no more words after those, but rann furiously at each other; My Trust was more fortunate than Flamminius'es, for though his enter'd my right side, yet meeting with a Ribb, and glaunceing on it, it gave me but a large flesh wound, whereas Mine past thorough, and thorough his Body, a litle above his Heart; and our weapons being not long, wee were constrain'd to close, in which I had the Fortune to fling him downe, and disarme him; but perceiveing by the great Spring of Blood which issu'd from his wound, that I had at least for a while hinder'd his Marryage, presenting him his Ponyard, I implor'd his forgivenesse for what I had done, begg'd him to be satisfy'd by my being able to have successe against him, that I had the better Cause, and besought him not to implore that Life I gave him, and Izadora had preserv'd; for hir ruine, and for mine: since he would hereafter know how neere shee was to Sacrifice hir owne for his, and that I would ever be of a resembling resolution. Flamminius made me some answer which I could not heare, for haveing effected my designe (though in the most vnfortunate way) I thought it high tyme to retire, lest a longer continuance in so dangerous a place, might robb me of the fruits of my Victory. I was but newly gone out of the Roome, when (occasion'd by the curiosity of some that had listen'd at the Doore whilst we were fighting) I heard all the house in an Allarme, & was scarce halfeway out of it, but that I found my selfe in a narrow Entry assaulted by fower with Swords, who cry'd out, kill, kill, the Murtherer of Flamminius; one of those was so hott in his Fury, that running at me he stumbl'd, & fell at my Feete, and by his fall choaking up the Passage, I had tyme to take away his Sword, with which for a while I retreated safe against the rest; but assoone as I was come into a more spatious place, not only the other three came all upon me, but most of that Crowde, which were invited to this Marryage, and Blacius at the head of them: so that I had certainely there receiv'd my Fate, had not those two Freinds I formerly specified, with Strato, releived me; who suspecting my designe, had continu'd about the house ready to answer all Allarmes, and this they did so vigorously, that haveing worsted some that oppos'd their Entrance, they joyn'd me in my greattest danger, and crying out Courage Perolla, by their voyces, and their performances, had restor'd me myne, though I had lost it. The Name of Perolla made Blacius discover what my disguise had conceal'd, & the Afront, but more the Actor of it, so transported him, that strikeing at me with all his force, and I defending his blowe with my Ponyard, his Sword fell out of his hand, which snatching up I presented it him by the hilt, & begg'd him not to employ his Armes, against a Life, that I was perpetually ready to sacrifice for his service. Blacius was so extreamly surpriz'd at the losse of his Sword, and at the manner of his recovering it, that I had tyme to leave him in his astonishment. But I ow'd it to the valour of the Gentleman with whome I had that discourse at my first comeing into the Roome where the Ball was daunceing, who learneing by the publique noyse that I was Perolla, and pardoning my attempt on Flamminius, as to my resentments, did preserve my Life, by cutting off another Gentlemans hand that was comeing behind me to have taken it away whilst I was restoreing Blacius his Ames. With this generous additional Assistance, I recover'd the Streete-Gate, where I found by the care of my two Freinds so powerfull a recruite, that had my revenge bin my designe, I might as easily have acted, as desir'd it; and indeede I found a greater difficulty to suppresse the fury of those Swords which were drawne in my Quarell, than I beleive I should, to have bin Victorious by them. To be breife, I retir'd to a private, & secure Sanctuary, though most of us receiv'd so many wounds, that their being not dangerous, made us acknowledge a high providence; Whilst wee were thus disputeing our difference, Izadora though shee were but a hearer of it, was (as shee has assur'd me) in farre greater feares, than any that were actors in it; but being told that Flamminius was kill'd, shee ranne with Callione where he lay, and where shee wept so many Teares, that he almost mistooke hir Pitty, for hir Love; but Blacius being (after our retreate) come thither also, caus'd Flamminius to be carry'd into the next Chamber, and assoone as the Chyrurgions had searcht, and bound up his wound; the impatient Father ask'd him whether his Daughter had any share in this Tragedy. Ah Sir (said Flamminius) be not so cruell to Truth, & to me as to suspect hir guilty of such a Cryme, for had shee intentions of that nature, shee needed not employ any to kill me, since shee knowes, shee has not only the power to act it hir selfe, but by the honor of dying by hir comands, shee has where-with-all abundantly to recompence my Death. No Sir, he that has reduc'd me to this condition, is some stranger, and Freind to Perolla, who beleiveing him too-much injur'd by the losse of Izadora, has so ciuilly endeavour'd to revenge his absent Freind, that I can no more complaine of his Resentments, than I should at the losse of so much blood, had it bin in Izadora's service; for after he had by Courage (& not surprize) disarm'd me, and that I had given him noe slight hurt, when the latter provoakt him to Reuenge, & the former gave him power to execute it, he restor'd me my Ponyard, & for that guift, only besought me to excuse those resentments his Freinds interest had created, and so left me. Take heed Flamminius (said Blacius) lest you make me question what you said of Izadora's innocency, by seemeing to be ignorant of Perolla's guilt, when that he wounded you, is so knowne a Truth, that there are as many witnesses of it, as People in this house. It may be (said Flamminius) that it was Perolla, but you cannot therefore conclude that I must know 'twas he, for if it were, his disguise might have deceiv'd one that had bin better acquainted with him than I have the honor to be; besides Sir, 'twould have bin too much in me, had I thought it had bin my Ryvall, to have given so large a Caracter of his performances before my Mistris. Well (reply'd Blacius) the certainty that it is Perolla cannot be greater, than that he shall never have Izadora, who I will thinke innocent because you doe, and who upon your recovery, shall be the reward of your Passion, & your wounds. Blacius immediatly after went away, & Izadora to satisfy hir Father, and hir goodnesse; continu'd with Flamminius, whose gallantry she admir'd, asmuch as shee esteem'd hir selfe vnfortunate in being vncapable of rewarding it. But he (as soone as Blacius was retir'd) somewhat toucht with my Carriage to him, but much more with what I had told him concerning Izadora's designe upon hir selfe, besought hir, to permitt him the honor of entertaining hir without witnesses, which shee graunted and the Chamber being empty'd, Flamminius told hir particularly all that had past betwixt us, magnified my actions in tearmes as flattering as handsome; and then coniur'd Izadora with passionate and moveing words, to acquaint him ingenuously, whether all I had deliver'd was true; but shee (more perplext at this question, than shee would have bin to drinke the fatall Bole) for a good while did nothing but fixe hir Eyes upon him, and cry'd out, oh Gods! Flamminius, oh Gods Flamminius, what is it you aske me? and at length answer'd him only in a shower of Teares, which drewe another from him, and words so distracted, yet so significant, that Izadora found, Rhethorick did not wholly consist in well speakeing, or in talkeing sence. But Flamminius'es disorder being somwhat mittigated, he continu'd; I perceive (faire Izadora) that your apprehensions I should destroy my Life, when you doe my hopes, hinders you from letting your words acknowledge, what your Teares have done, but I beseech you beleive, that I shalbe more tormented in continueing your Misery, than in knowing my owne; that I shall consider my affliction as my Ioy, if it can build yours; and if by the learning my owne misfortunes, I may put a period to Izadora's, shee will more oblige me by building hir happinesse on the ruine of mine, than if shee continu'd my hopes, by hir sufferings. Alas (said Izadora) what shall I answer? for your Virtue is such, that it makes mine my Paine; and that Constancy which I still glory'd in, is now a subject as fitt for my Teares, as satisfaction. oh Gods! shee continu'd after a short silence, why doe you make virtue so offensive to virtue! why doe you make Flamminius's virtue of such a quality, that I am troubl'd to professe mine? & why doe you render perseverance in good, a Torment as great, as the fault in declineing it? Alas Flamminius, presse me not to tell you what I elected to shunn by death, & gesse at the Nature of what I am to speake, by what I would have perform'd to avoyde it; let it suffice, you having ty'de me to approve of your passion, or your Death, and that since my preinguadgement hinder'd me from cherishing the former, to preserve you from the latter, I was willing, and am resolu'd to exchange our destinies. Great Gods! (Flamminius cry'd out) why did you teach me what retributions I ought to make so high a perfection, & so long delay'd giveing me the power to performe them; then turning to the Excellency he had mention'd, he continu'd; faire Izadora, you have not only taught me what to practice, but given me the power to act it; Yes, I am now readdy to lose my Hopes, without my Life, and the joyes of haveing served you in a way that you can no more hereafter doubt of, than reward my Passion, will recompence my losse, and preserve a Life which must be my contentment, since it has establisht yours, and is esteemed by you. But why doe I lengthen my discourse? 'tis sufficient you learne (generous Spartacus) that the Great Flamminius made a resignation of all his Passions for Izadora, but those of being serviceable to hir, and became as perfect a Freind, as he had bin a Lover. This admirable change both he and Izadora acquainted me with, by a Servant of his, to whome shee had told my retreate. To drawe to a conclusion, dureing Flaminius weakenesse, he so perfectly acted the Lover before Blacius, and so perfectly the Freind when he was absent, that Izadora was covinc't (by so painfull a part) he was asmuch concern'd in procureing hir for me, as formerly he had bin in doeing it for himselfe, but when his health was so much return'd, that he could no longer clowde the fallacy, we were all in new disorders; for Blacius who was still confident of Izadora's Constancy to me, and who suspected what shee design'd to attempt for hir owne deliverance, would be as soone as Flamminius was recover'd, so strictly kept his Daughter, that shee was then absolutely confin'd to hir Chamber, whose windowes were grated with Iron, and whose Doores were justified by a Guard. Flamminius in this exigency, to manifest his conversion, and to make himselfe vncapable of a relapse, advis'd us by a speedy Marriage to exempt our selves from the power both of Blacius, and of Fortune, which course if wee would elect, he was confident in some short tyme to furnish us with the meanes to practice. This both my Passion, and Reason infinitly approu'd, and by Callione, with whome I had in disguise some private meetings in the Temple, I besought Izadora to be of my opinion, and made use of those very arguments to hir, that shee had to me, when I was in the blest condition of Blacius esteeme, and apprehended the contrary from Pacuvius; but that scrupulous virtue resolu'd it as great a Sinn against hir Duty, to Marry Perolla without hir Fathers consent, as it was against hir Vowes, to Marry any other; and though the generous Flamminius represented, that when he could no longer conceale his change from Blacius, shee must expect to be depriv'd of his assistance, which, if not made use of whilst he had the opportunity of paying it, might probably alter hir confinement, into a perpetuall Prison, or by hir Fathers presenting hir a new husband, necessitate hir to act what shee had but design'd, yet all he could extort from Izadora (in my favour) was, that shee would contribute to any thing which might secure hir from hir Fathers violence, so the place of hir future Sanctuary were of such a quality, that shee might be confident hir honor would no more suffer in Report, than in Act; this vnalterable decree cast us into new difficultyes, and before wee could immagin any way of suppressing them, Flaminius was so perfectly recover'd, that Blacius publisht within two dayes the Nuptiall, which had bin interrupted, should be consummated. This Allarme (which I receiv'd from Callione) by that just, and high Carracter I had of my late Ryvall, had noe further an opperation on me, than the feares of what advantages we might lose by his Banishment from Blacius, who permitted noe Creature but Flamminius, & Callione, to see Izadora, & who kept a Guard as strong, as faithfull to him, at the doore of his house, as at the doore of hir Chamber; but when my hope had resign'd it selfe to despaire, he that to create my joyes, had ruin'd his owne, was not content only to leave Izadora to me, but to helpe hir to me; in prosecution of which Gallantry, the day before the intended Marriage (for 'twas so long deferr'd, either that he found not out the invention sooner, or else to endeere it) by that free accesse he had into Izadoras Chamber, he came to visit hir, with a Countenance as full of satisfaction as if he, not another, had bin to enjoye the fruits of his industry; and there inform'd hir, that he had seene, & consequently ador'd hir, coming to Salapia to visit an Aunt of his, who was cheife of Diana's Vestalls, whom that morning he had acquainted with all his story, & whom he had perswaded, to repaire what his Civility to hir had caus'd, to receive hir into that Nunnery, without those oath's which they really admitted must necessarily take, and thereby, by deludeing Blacius's beleife, frustrate his hopes of forceing hir returne into the world, 'till shee might make it hir Election, & not Constraint. I cannot expresse with what joy & acknowledgement Izadora receiv'd this Newes, both which were increast by Flamminius assureing hir that before the Night was many howers old, he would conduct hir safely to hir retirement; and towards the effecting it presented hir with a water of so excellent a quality, that 'its nouriture was Iron; This strange liquor he aply'd to the Barres of the Windowes, in litle channells of wax, which did its operation so powerfully, and silently, that late at Night when he repeated his visit, he found a breach in the Windowe, large enough for Izadora, and Callione to gett out at, which they did by a ladder of silke he had purposely brought; They were no sooner descended into the Garden, upon which the Window answer'd, than by the ordinary way (to delude the Guards at hir Doore) he went thither himselfe, and by picking the lock, they gott into a retir'd Streete, where by Flamminius appointment I attended them. I cannot tell you what were my expressions of joy, & gratitude, to my Mistris, and my Ryvall; nor what Prayers, & Reasons, I us'd to inuite hir rather to a Temple, than a Nunnery, and to embrace the opportunity of an union when the Gods presented us so favourable a one: that to decline it was not to rely on, but tempt their providence. 'Tis too-much you know, that all was fruitlesse, and that we conducted Izadora to hir liveing Grave. Who can repeate Blacius amazement; when next morning insteed of findeing his daughter prepareing hirselfe to be a Bride, he only found a Letter on the Table of what forlorne courses his rigour had forc'd hir to; but though his surprize, and astonishment, had bin as high as fancy could reach yet it could not transcend Izadora's & mine, when discourseing together, we were advertis'd that one of Appollo's Prests, desir'd to speake with us, who being admitted, wee found 'twas Flamminius; which had taken that holy order, & who told us, That haveing lost the hopes of this world, he would no longer live in it, that haveing bin a Servant to Izadora, he could not goe lesse, loseing that servitude, than become one to the Gods, that he was the more fitted for their service, by haveing practic'd vnder their perfectest Resembler; & at last so passionatly begg'd a pardon for haveing so much endanger'd Izadora's, safety, as to have brought it to an equall Fight (though his victory had bin both his & hir ruine) & so admirably declaim'd upon a speculative, and recluse Life; that we could not more absolutely excuse what he had done against us, then admire what he had done for us; which had it not bin of a quality that had plac'd us above the thoughts of any other felicity, Izadora had esteem'd a reall Nunnery, and I the takeing of Flamminius Habit a blessing; But what he had perform'd, render'd fruitlesse what he had spoken; & his Actions were more eloquent, than his Words. When this great Man had spent about an hower with us, he tooke his eternall leave, with a looke as serene as his thought, and with words, as Heavenly as his profession; wee both accompany'd him as farre as wee durst, and then casting ourselves at his Feete, we implor'd him by his Prayers to preserve us in that Condition, as his virtue had plac'd us in, which haveing faithfully promis'd to endeavour, he return'd to that holy Society, of which he was the greatest Glory, and the noblest Portion. After our Teares were something lessen'd for so sadd a separation, because I had but that day allow'd me by Flamminius Aunt to entertaine Izadora in (which too, was a favour aboue example) I imploy'd the small tyme that was left to implore hir permission (now that shee was in an inviolable Sanctuary, and my visits thither prohibited) to returne to Scipio, and Massanissa, by whose favours (upon the knowledge of my Condition) I made no doubt but to procure the Senate to enjoyne Blacius to permitt our Nuptialls, which Course was sufficintly justifiable, since wee sought to make use of Power but to oppose Tyranny, and to obtaine that from Authority, which was deny'd to Reason; that since the severe lawes of the Society shee was in, permitted me not to see or speake with hir, dureing hir residence there, my absence in Affrick or Italy was the same, and by my continuance about Salapia, I might induce Blacius to suspect shee was a conditionall, not an absolute Vestall, and increase his hatred, by increaseing his jealousye. These reasons (and my enguadgement of a sudden returne) obtain'd hir consent for my Iourny which I began the next morning, haveing first sent a Freind to begg, Pacuvius permission to pay him the duty of a Sonne, who return'd me word, that he knew of none which bore that Name, but that if ever Perolla appear'd before him, he should esteeme it the highest injury he had ever done him. The greife of this Message, was not much inferior to the satisfaction of haveing free'd Izadora from so great a hazard, and the haveing settl'd hir in as great a security. But I must acknowledge (Sir continu'd Perolla speakeing to my Prince) in this voyage my Heart and my Tongue were strangers, for though what I have specifie'd were the pretence of it; yet the designe was to prosecute Hanniball, whose wrongs to Izadora and me, though they were as hard to be Reveng'd as Pardon'd, yet I could not but vndertake the former, not being able to graunt him the latter, and I esteem'd the seidge of Carthage would furnish me with an occasion. But as I was goeing to Capua to take Shipp for Affrick, I mett Scipio return'd from thence, he landed at Lillibeum in Scicily, from whence all the way to Rome he was mett, with merited, and tryumphant Songs and Trophyes. That great Man haveing pardon'd my vncivill departure upon the knowledge of the Cause, told me the perticuler Conditions Carthage had submitted vnto, without a Seidge (which are too long to be specified) and which were in substance, they had acknowledg'd themselves vanquisht, in such a way, that the very proofes they had given of that confession; ty'd them perpetually to continue so. He inform'd me also as a testimony of their beleiveing themselves as justly, as absolutly conquer'd, that a Senator askeing them by what Gods they would sweare to keepe the Peace, He was answer'd by Asdruball; Even by the very same Gods, wee have found so severe to those that violate it. After I had a while congratulated a successe which none could doubt, that were not ignorant of Scipio's Quarell and Virtue, and after I had begg'd his assistance in converting Blacius, I tooke leave of him, & learning that Hanniball was about Carthage, at Scipio's departure thence, I row'd downe the Ryver Vulturnus that Night, next morning sett sayle for Affrick, and in three Dayes arriu'd where I thought my Enemy was; but I found that but six dayes before, he had embarkt himselfe for Asia, and had elected the Court of King Antiochus for his Retreate: Thither I directed my Iourny resolueing to prosecute him with as litle intermission, as he had Izadoras virtue, but the Gods were so much Enemyes to my designe that what by tedious sicknesse, what by the crossenesse of the Windes, I arriu'd not there, 'till there was nothing left of the Carthaginian, but his Fame; he himselfe being gone to Prusia's King of Bithinia, after he had lost the Battell of Magnesia at Sea by the Cowardice of Apolonius his Colleague who flying away, left all the right wing of the Enemyes Fleete entire, to fall upon the Carthaginians Squadron that was much shatter'd in obtaineing a victory over the Rhodians which compos'd the left; but this misfortune was tearm'd a Cryme by Antiochus Courtiers, who apprehended Hanniballs knowledge in Warre, would soone if once manifested to their King, discover their ignorance in it. I cannot omitt telling you a passage which perhaps you may esteeme worthy the digression, when Antiochus was at Ephesus, & Hanniball with him, the Romans, amongst many other Embassadors they sent to that great King, elected Scipio for one, who discourseing familiarly with the Carthaginian, desir'd to know of him, who he esteem'd the noblest Generall of all others? Hanniball answer'd, First he thought Alexander King of Macedon the cheifest, next to him Pyrrhus King of Epire, & Thirdly Hanniball. Scipio (smileing) ask't him what wouldst thou say Hanniball, if thou hadst vanquisht me) Truely (said he) then I would have bin the cheifest my selfe. This reply was the handsomest complement I have heard, for without counting Scipio amongst the greatest, he inclusively acknowledg'd him so. To conclude our Story, I will not tell you all Hanniballs actions vnder Prusias in his warres against Eumenes King of Pergamus, 'tis enough you konw whersoever I follow'd him, I found him (by his military virtue) a Generall, & at last (through a Thousand troubles and dangers) I came to Libissa, the towne of his residence, where the next morning I intended to endeavour the finishing of that Combate in Asia, which was but begun in Affrick, & that which gave me the hopes of effecting it with lesse paine, was, that by a new contracted jealousy of Prusias'es, he liv'd then but as a private person. The day no sooner appear'd, than I went to Hanniballs house, but alas I found all his Domesticks weepeing over his dead body, & inquireing from one of the principall'st of them, the occasion of that disaster, he told me, That Titus Quintus Flamminius, a Roman Embassador to Prusias, haveing seene Hanniball in his Court, was so incenst at that object, by the remembrance of those miseries his valour had involu'd the Roman Empire in, that he never left soliciting the barbarous King, to revenge their sufferings on the Actor of them, 'till he had obtain'd an order to have him deliver'd into his hands, which the Generous Hanniball inform'd of, to prevent falling into a Romans Power, had that night temper'd an exact Poyson, and heareing Prusias Guards forceing his lodgeings cry'd out, Come let us ende our owne Miserie, and the Roman Feares, and then dranke of the fatall Cupp, which has affoarded him that case, which none that know him, and virtue, can participate of, 'till they are in his condition; but (said the sadd Servant) I beseech you (Sir) observe in this example, how much the present Romans, doe degenerat from their Auncestors; Those preserv'd their conquering Enemye from Poyson, and These induce a King, contrary to the Lawes of hospitality, and faith, to betray his Guest, Hanniballs servant could speake no more for weeping, and though I was sorry any but Perolla should revenge Izadora, yet I was satisfy'd that the Gods (by makeing him become his owne Executioner) evinc't, his Crymes were great, by their punishment, and declar'd their justice to be so too, in forceing him that had bin hir Enemy, to become his owne, & hir Revenger. The next day this great Captaine was buryed, and my anger dying with the cause of it, I esteem'd it a duty to attend his body to the Tombe, which had no other Inscription, but, Here Lyes HANNIBALL, and indeed was not capable of a greater. This solemnity perform'd I began to returne into Italy, from whence my Revenge had too-long detain'd me, but the misfortunes I endur'd, and the obstructions I met with were such, that I arriu'd not in this Citty 'till the very day the Inhabitants of it sent to treate with the generous Spartacus, which to doe by feare, and not by necessity, I esteem'd so lowe a thing, that makeing my selfe knowne, I made their duty so to them, which was to oppose their Captivity in a way, that if afterward it prou'd their destiny, yet at least it would be esteem'd their misfortune,  & not their Cryme. The first day our successe was proportionate to our desires; & the next, where Canitius storm'd, I had the fortune to oppose, and worst him; but whilst a fresh Allarme drew me, though not the Guard, from that Post, by your vnresistable Sword, you made a Passage for your Army, as easy for them, as glorious for your selfe: But I thanke the Gods (Perolla continu'd) that I was call'd away, for perhaps my sacrilledgious Arme might have bin employ'd against a virtue, which to have fought against, or resisted, would have more troubl'd me, than to be vanquisht by it, and which to know is so great a felicity, that I count my defeate an easy, purchace of it. The newes of your possessing that Quarter of the Towne, no sooner came to me in this, than not knowing to what insolency the Souldiers heate, authoriz'd by a successefull assault might raise them to, abandoning all other Cares but those for Izadora, I rann to the Religious house shee was in, and carry'd hir from thence to Palcuvius'es there to preserve hir honor, or not, live to see it violated; where all those Freinds I had about me, were lost in so generous a defence and where, (when my resistance was no longer usefull) I deriu'd that from my Enemyes virtue which the Gods deny'd my) endeavours, and my Sword. 'Twas thus (said Symander to Callimmachus) that Perolla finisht his Story, on which, if I have too long insisted 'twas to publish what were a Sinn to conceale all remaines now to acquaint you, what period had our Lovers sufferings, in which my Prince so justly sympathiz'd, that he had doubtlesse made use of his power to settle them in their joyes, had he not first esteem'd it requisite too heare what their Fathers could object, which he haveing invited them too, Pacuvins addrest his discourse unto him in these Tearmes. If I thought your Iustice were not as great as your conquests, I might apprehend, after Izadora's Story, that you would not have the patience to heare my defence, but looke upon That as an evincement of my being as highly guilty of cruelty, as I am confident by that tyme I have ended speakeing, you will thinke me free from it, For I will make it evident that all those actions which shee alleadges proceed from his inclinations to hir, and to virtue, are only testimonyes of his hatred to his Father. His high Generosity, and a desire of freeing his Country was, to kill Hanniball, my greatest Freind, which was farre worse than to have murther'd me, my Death had ended all miseries with it, but to survive such a Freind, was to endure a Torment, which none but he that resented it, can beleive; or if I thought Death a greater contentment than Life, by that action he reduc'd me to the sadd extreamity, of being my owne Executioner; but which was worse than all this, he design'd to murther that great Conqueror in my owne house, where he would have no Guards but my fidelity, which to have violated, had bin a breach of Trust, & Hospitality, two of the most sacred Tyes, & all this vnder a pretence of serveing the Romans, who had they not scorn'd to owe their safety to a Sinn that had render'd them unworthy of it, might certainly have found spirits of a temper apt enough to Sacrifice themselves, to have preserv'd the Publique; but the high esteeme they yet pay Fabritius memory, for not permiting one of Pyrrhus owne Subjects, upon (as it were) the Eue of their Ruine, to Poyson him, doe's sufficiently demonstrate, they had rather bazard their Empire than their Reputation; and certainly if they thought it gallantry in Fabritius, not to purchase their safetyes, by only permiting an ill act in an Epyrote, which he had noe interest in, but what his knowledge of it gave him, how much would they then condemne a Roman, when their State was not neere in so great a hazard, so that that which he would have appeare an obligation to his Country, would have bin really a Sinn against it, and his Family: But besides, who knowes if after having done the fact, he would not have fledd (for I can hardly beleive, he that would act a treacherous designe, would expose his Life to justify he intended it for a generous one) and so have left me a Sacrifice to the fury of Hanniballs Souldiers. The next proofe of his Affection to me, was to preserve my greatest enemyes Life, when I might by so favourable an adventure have purchast that Death, which I would a thousand tymes have bought by my owne, had not higher considerations, plac't limitts to my just Revenge. He pretends indeede, that he comes to see me, but the event justifyes 'tis to preserve Blacius, he is loaden with wounds for the defence of Izadora's Father, and spends that blood for his preservation, which could not have bin more generously spile than for his destruction; in a word, he employes that Life I gave him, to preserve his, that he knew made mine my greatest torment; & as if all those were not sufficient wrongs, he makes his House his Sanctuary, and thereby excludes me, and his Freinds from affoarding him any demonstrations of our care; but that I looke upon as an argument of his guilt, which was of a quality, to make him esteeme himselfe safer with his Enemyes, than with me. But his most vnpardonable Cryme was, to become a Slave to one of that Family, whose greatest ambition should have bin, to have made all of them his; nay, Courts hir with Sighes, & Teares, to accept his liberty, & by a thousand such vnworthy submissions, endeavours to make me qustion his Mothers Faith, which I should have done, did I not know one of the greatest vices, is to suspect shee had any; for in a long succession of yeares, there were none legittimate of our Line, 'till the degenerate Perolla, but with their milke; suckt a hatred for that of Blacius's; But he had no sooner gotten his health & lost his liberty, but more loyfull of the last than of the first, he quitts Salapia, without paying me the duty of a visit, which was the pretence of his comeing thither, and his impiety not being yet come to the height of attempting my Life with his owne hand, he endeavours it obliquely, by takeing up Armes for the Romans Against the Carthaginians, in whose party I was so enguadg'd, that he could not prosecure their overthrowe and effect it, without involveing me in their ruine; and when the great Hanniball, had justly censur'd Blacius to Death, for his practice with the Romans, Perolla (that I might not suspect the first service he did him, was by accident, but designe) enguages all such of his Freinds as he could seduce, and with them, employes his Sword, and Life, to redeeme my greatest Enemyes; in which attempt, as you have heard, he had a successe proportionat to his desires; and after that Blacius was found out, and brought to the Scaffold, there to receive the punishment of his offences, lest I might yet doubt he Lov'd his Enemyes, asmuch as he hated his Father, he voluntarily embraces Death, to justify that Truth Iudge (Sir) if ever there were a higher injury than this, and if by it, my hatred be not as just, as great, for in this one action, he distroyes that Life, he knew (maugre all his ingratitude) I yet lov'd best, to preserve his, whome I hated most; but he was preserv'd from death, by Izadora's Teares; Izadora I, say, one of Blacius Family, which had he had any generosity, he should rather have suffer'd, than ow'd his deliverance to such a Deliverer; For my part the cause of his safety, tooke away all my joyes for the effect, & made me celebrate his preseruatio in Teares: but though Hanniball pardon'd his Life, yet he kept him in Prison, where he had still retain'd him, had not the generous Maharball given him his Liberty, which he had no sooner obtain'd, than he employes it by beareing Armes vnder the Romans) for his, distruction that gave it him; but perhapps he will say, he redeem'd that fault by giveing Maharball his Life; to which I answer, that was no satisfaction for the old Cryme, but the acting of a new one, for He was only treacherous to his Freinds, to repaire his ingratitude to his Enemyes, and thereby comitted one Sinn, to act another; he makes the Publique, pay for his particuler fault, and redeemes his owne unworthynesse, by depriveing the party he seru'd, of so considerable a Prisoner; besides, what happen'd was but an accident, but his takeing up Armes was a designe. Thus you see, those actions he most gloryes in, being diligently enquir'd into, are found contrary to what they appear'd, & if his best performances are Crymes, what are then his others? He was an earnest persecuter of Haniball, (my greatest Freind) while he continu'd in Italy, all my perswasions, and Prayers, not being able to hinder him so much, as from acting against him in his Person; and as if the knowledge of the affection I pay'd that great Generall, were a sufficient cause to create Perolla's hatred for him, he left his owne Country, and his Izadora too, to prosecute him vnder Scipio in Affrick, & at that famous Battell of Zama, a thowsand tymes ventur'd his owne Life, to deprive Hanniball of his; and though he alleadges that he preserved him, when he might have acted his destruction, yet I shall beseech you to consider, he is but his owne witnesse, & whether it be likely he would have neglected that opportunity had it bin offer'd, which he has since sought out over all the world, & never declin'd, whilst there was any possibility of findeing it. He was not only content to injure me in my Freind, but doe's it too in my Enemy: and that I might not doubt his perseverance in his former courses, by stealeing away Izadora (in which Sinn every accessary is a principall) he violat's both Humane, and Divine Lawes, and rather elects the committing of so high a cryme, than that I should want testimonyes of so proportionat a Truth; nay by his owne confession, would have Marryed hir, & joyn'd those two Bloods together, that never 'till then were vnited, but when they rann from wounds, & mingled on the ground, and would thereby have ty'de my hand from Revenge, or forc't me to act it, thorough my only Sonne. Lastly, and that I hope will not prove in your judgement inferiour to any, when your victorious Armes had struck such a Terror into our Cittizens, that we were goeing to present you our Keyes, and Liberties, he by his vnfortunate perswasion, and example, made them take up Armes, and forc't you to purchase your victory by blood, reduc'd his Country, and Freinds, to a fatall subjection, or death, or to owe their deliverance to a Mercy, they have so highly offended that they are vnworthy of it; but if you execute the rigour of Warre upon us, and that your justice involues Perolla in the publique Fate, I shall then finde my happinesse in my destruction, and more commend Fortune in revengeing me upon him, than be displeas'd at Hir, for my owne, and Salapia's ruine. Spartacus & all the assistants, were infinitly surpriz'd at so strange a reasoning, and request: But my Prince put a silence to the Generall murmur, by inviting Blacius to speake, who thus obay'd him. I attest the Gods (said he, lifting his Eyes and his hands to the place of their residence) that from the Tyme Perolla preserv'd my Life, it has bin my misfortune; for if ever since, I deriv'd any joy from this woman; (pointing at Izadora) 'twas only learning by my owne sufferings in hir want of duty, what Pacuvius'es were in his Sonnes immitateing hir Cryme; but because shee has told hir owne Story with so much Art, that it may induce you to consider my resentments, as an injustice, I shall breifely give you a true Comment upon it; I confesse shee had my command to cherrish, and esteeme him that preserv'd my Life, but shee had it not to give those retributions to Perolla: That ignorance which (I beleive) procur'd my safety, procur'd that injunction; I found him my Freind, when I gave him my affection, but shee knew him my Enemy, when shee gave him hirs. Observe too, I beseech you, how confident this young man was of haveing it; when the argument he us'd to make hir declare that truth, was only, if shee avow'd it not, he would kill hir Fathers Enemy; that which was a just motive to silence hir Flame, was his inducement to invite hir to disclose it; in which one action shee doubly injur'd me, in not only being content to save my mortal'st Enemy, when too, shee contributed nothing to his ruine, but the performeing of hir duty, but also in makeing the purchace of that safety, the losse of my only Childe; shee obey'd me whilst shee knew I was ignorant of what I did, & disobey'd me when shee ignor'd not what I enjoyn'd, but that also the injunction was just; besides, after I had preserv'd Perolla's Life, when I had both power, and justice, to extinguish it, by hir receiveing his prohibited visits, and by makeing a contract of passions with him, shee thereby endeavours to induce me to detest Charity, by converting the effects of Mine, into so sensible a greife; and when for my successefull indeavours, and duty, to the Roman Empire, I became Hanniballs Prisoner, shee invites an assistance for my Liberty, which I had declar'd (in hir heareing) was a greater misfortune than that execution I was menac't with; whereby shee did offend either my professions, or me; the first by not crediting them, or the last, in acting against them, if shee beleiv'd their Truth; nay shee acknowledg'd shee was apprehensive of loseing hir happinesse in attempting to preserve a part, intending hir Lover by the former, and hir Father by the latter, thereby becomeing so impious, as before Perolla was hir Husband, to give him a precedency, only due unto that relation: Shee is so ernest to disoblidge me, that shee impudently confest shee put hir selfe in the highest perplexity shee was capable of, to involve me in a resembling one. When I was gott out of Prison, in the hurry of that change, shee endeavours to extort a declaration from me, that in a set led temper of minde, shee knew my judgement would deny; gives Perolla vnjust prayses, to make me give him, an vnjust reward, and would render that an act of Freindship for me, which was but one of Freindship to himselfe, as you may be pleas'd to remember I then largely evinc't; but when the second tyme I was taken, whether it proceeded from their Revenge, or my owne Misfortune, I will not possitively determine; Alas (Sir) how vngratefull was hir carriage? shee sayes that shee came to preserve my life, but hir actions say 'twas to preserve Perolla's, and when hir Fathers, and hir Lovers Life, came in competition, shee gave up the first a Sacrifice, to preserve the last from being one; neither can shee alleadge this impious proceeding was an effect of a precipitate election upon a sudden emergency, for after shee had publisht hir Love was the God over hir duty, Hanniball (startled at a declaration which was even a Monster in Nature) gave hir not only leasure to reflect on hir Cryme, but power to recall it; yet shee, to demonstrate that the murthering hir Father, was a premeditated designe, and not a hasty choyce, perseveres in, and repeates hir impiety, when he that was to receive the advantage of it condemn'd, & detested it: which action of virtue, hir depraved reason makes a confirmative argument for hir continueing in hir vice. This (Sir) which I aleadge, would be, I beleive, the reasoning of a stranger, which has any, but now I beseech you let us take hir owne sence upon this way of proceeding; shee first alleadg'd, that I had not bin grateful enough to Perolla's virtue, and that now shee was to act my part, shee would make him know what his performances were, and what my gratitude should have bin by hir Retributions. To this I answere that besides my former saveing his Life, after his Father treacherously endeavour'd to take away Mine, the Condition I then was in, sufficiently confirm'd my Gratitude; for the same Proclamation which gave hir a rise to save my Life, by hir declareing who 'twas that forc't the Prison for my deliverance, gave me the same power, (for no one was excluded by the manifest) which my Gratitude made me decline, and rather elect to lose my owne life, than secure it by hazarding my Preservers; (for I was cofident the Guards were too strict to have admitted his goeing out of Salapia) and though as in this action I evinc't that I preferr'd my gratitude, before my Life, so I did too, that I preferr'd Death, before any allyance with Pacuvius Blood; yet shee persever'd in a Passion which tended to that, or a more vnlegittimate end; Hir next allegation is as vaine as the first; for to justify shee murther'd me with a good intention, shee designes to murther hirselfe, as if one cryme could expiate another, or as if having kill'd one of the Family the destroying of the residue, were a sufficient reparation; No Sir shee loves Pacuvius blood so much, that shee has a hatred to hir owne, for being the object of his, & so wedds his resentments, that shee executes hir Father, hir selfe, and consequently all hir Family, to act them; but my Enemy was more mercifull than my Daughter, for I receiv'd that Life from Hanniball, which Izadora deny'd me, and though those Crymes (hir Constancy in a forbidden Flame, and hir seekeing Death, because of a supposed losse which shee knew, was my satisfaction) might have induc't me to consider hir sufferings, as an immediate justice of the Gods, for hir want of duty; yet as soone as Hanniball threatn'd to be their instrument in it, I not only hazarded my Life, and Fortune to prevent it, but also embrac't hir satisfaction with so much concerne, that rather than continue hir languishings, I intended to sett a period to them by giveing hir to Perolla; which I had effected, had not he at the same tyme I was acting his felicity bin robbing me of my Glory; for though he attributed his immediate leaveing of Salapia after Hanniballs repulse, to a designe of suppressing any jealousy his continuance in it might create, yet I was perfectly inform'd, 'twas his Ambition, not his Respect, that caus'd it; and his speedy returne to the Campe, was only to ingrosse an honor to himselfe, which in a good proportion was built with my blood; neither did his long abstaineing from justifying himselfe to me, proceede (as his Mistris said) from his ignorance of my resentments, but from his being conscious of the justice of them; And though shee magnifyes Pacuvius's Sonnes gallantry, in crediting my Change, I must only his Reason, since in that only, by what I had already done, he might well credit any thing I should doe. But after that by Perolla's new affront I had alter'd my resolutions, by esteemeing him vnworthy of my Allyance that esteem'd me vnworthy of justice, & after that by my former concessions, I had manifested to hir, my present Resentments were effects of my Reason, and not of aversion for hir Lover, yet shee was so farre from sympathizeing with me in my legittimate resolues that when I presented hir Flamminius, who wanted nothing, but the being of Pacuvius Family, shee was not only content to decline the Husband I approu'd but elected one I justly abhorr'd; & when his being more intent, in Affrick, on hir Revenge, than his Love, which might have somthing lessen'd hirs, had like to have render'd hir disobedience without excuse, shee determines to abandon hir Father, and the World, rather than a negligent Lover; & was satisfyed with no way of being releiv'd from hir Distresse, vnlesse shee increases hir owne Cryme, by makeing Perolla act another; nay, so much abhorres any thing from hir Fathers recomendation, that Flamminius coming to hir upon that score, shee will rather hazard hir Lovers blood, than spare His. To conclude, that hir impiety might be vncapable of any accession, and to resemble hir Servant as perfectly in Sinn, as in Affection, shee (like him) by stealeing away, violates all divine, and human Lawes; and hir not being Marry'd, which shee alleadges to qualify hir Cryme, is an aggravation of it, for flying from hir Father, to hir Husband, had bin only an offence in giveing Perolla that Title, but flying from hir Father, to hir Lover, shee must be more oblig'd to Mens Charityes, than to hir actions, if they have not thereby as bad a Carracter of hir Chastity, as I of hir duty. These Sir said Blacius, are my reasonings, and as I beleive they are not much dissonant from Truth, which gives me a confidence, that if your justice be proportionable to your Power, you will right an injur'd Father; but if hir Sex moues you to pitty; Perolla's I hope will not: your punishment of him will obliquely repaire my wrongs, for either his death, wilbe the occasion of hirs, or if shee survive him, hir torment, or hir cure, wilbe my satisfaction. This discourse did but increase that wonder Pacuvius's had given a being unto; And my Prince was prepareing himselfe to declaime upon a Theame, which would have furnisht reasons to a Iudgement as ill, as his was excellent, when he was diverted by a noyse, & suddenly perceiu'd the occasion of it was the comeing in of Granicus, Euriles, & some other Officers of his Army, that presented him with two Salapians, whose very sight almost depriv'd Pacuvius, and Blacius, both of theirs, and of their Lives; Spartacus obseru'd it, and so did our generous Lovers, but being ignorant of the Cause, they expected with much patience to learne it, which they soone did, by one of the Salapians addressing himselfe to Spartacus, in these words. Sir, wee are come to begg Iustice of you, for you, These two Gentlemen (pointing at Pacuvius and Blacius) whose guilt is asmuch in their Faces, as in their Hearts, observing in the Assault, that my Companion, and I, employ'd our Lives somewhat prodigally for the defence of our Citty, inferr'd from thence, that wee would hazard them, to be revenged on the Conqueror of it; & in this Faith came severally to us, & by assurances of excessive rewards, hir'd us by our treachery to destroy what wee could not by our Swords. This office wee accepted; were seemeingly wicked, but to be really the contrary; and vndertooke to kill you, that wee might preserve you; for we apprehended our declineing their overture, might have induc't them to invite some others to embrace it, where the greatnesse of the Reward, might have cover'd the greatnesse of the Cryme; besides (Sir) for us to have vndertooke such a Designe, had bin a Sinn against gratitude, aswell as honor; for wee are two of those that receiv'd our Liberties, when wee expected our Deathes, and if wee employ'd those Lives against you, which wee receiv'd from you; 'twas not only by your permission, but by your Command, and since to obey you wee durst draw our Swords against you, you cannot suspect wee will decline any other obedience. The Salapian had no sooner done speakeing, than Blacius first, and afterwards Pacuvius, acknowledg'd by their words, what their tremblings and disorders had confest and though they severally alleadg'd, that the ignorance they then were in of my Princes virtue, & their knowledge that in him only consisted the life, & soule of his Army, had induc'd them to that revenge, yet all the Assistants (but the generous Lovers) were so enrag'd at them, for their Tyranny to their Children, and their intended Treachery to so milde a Conqueror, that there was no-thing heard in that great Assembly out Cryes, That Spartacus should revenge himselfe, that he should extirpate such Monsters out of the World, & pay with their Lives those Crosses which they had given to Izadora and Perolla. Granicus too, and the other Officers that came with him, inform'd Spartacus, that they had bin already condemn'd by a Court-marshall upon that Article, That whosoever endeavour'd the Death of the Generall, should receive his owne, for his punishment, so that he had nothing to doe, but to give the Lawe it's course, which in that case to oppose, was not to be mercifull, but vnjust. All this while the Generous Lovers were so confounded, that had not their Innocence bin knowne, their disorders, and trouble, had bin taken for their guilt; but my Prince haveing whisper'd something privatly to Euriles, he went to Izadora, and hir generous Servant begg'd them to excuse an execution which Blacius, & Pacuvius merritted, had it bin only for their Cruelty to them, that in their deaths they might reade the justice of the Gods, by rendring their vices, (which had bin the cause of their owne troubles) the occasion, of their Parents punishment, and of their owne quiett; that since for him to be just, would make them happy, he hoped they would pardon a Revenge which he inflicted asmuch upon their score, as his owne. Then my Prince bid Euriles carry away the Delinquents, to receive the Censure had bin given them. At that sadd command both Izadora, and Perolla, cast themselves at Spartacus Feete, which haveing a while washt with their Teares, they begg'd him either to alter his sentence, or permit them to perticipate in it; that if the Death of their Fathers must be the only way to their vnion; they would be content with the being eternally deny'd it, rather than purchase it at that Rate; that they should be more miserable in the Losse of their Parents, than in their Cruelty: and lastly, they protested by inviolable oathes, if they suffer'd; they would perpetually banish themselves from each others Company, and either by greife, or resolution, suddenly follow them. Then riseing up from my Prince they prostrated themselves at their Fathers Feete, where they againe reitterated those engagements, and in such passionate tearmes, and moveing actions implor'd their pardons for those disobediences their Love's, (not they) had commited, and which they would suddenly repaire by embraceing a resembling destiny to theirs, that my Prince could not abstaine from crying out, Tyrants, are you so much fortified against virtue, that so powerfull an assauls, must remaine fruitlesse? can Fathers see that without pitty which Strangers cannot? can Nature be insensible against the attempts of Nature? Whilst Spartacus was speakeing many things of this quality, Izadora and hir generous Servant, had by their weepeings so lay'd their Fathers rage, as showres doe stormes that those Cloudes of hatred, which had so long hinder'd Reason, & Nature from shineing, began by litle & litle to dispell, & they were no sooner absolutely vanisht, than Blacius first went to Perolla, and Pacuvius afterwards to Izadora, and in more Teares, then words acknowledg'd their repentance, and conversion, & when their severall passions permitted them to speake, they joyfully commanded them to consider their sentence but as a tribute to the Law of Nature, and Warre, and that they should in the joyes of their vnion, extinguish all the Sorrow their Deaths could inspire, which they protested was not so great a trouble to them, as that they had so long, and cruelly hinder'd it. I am I confesse (continu'd Symander) vnable to tell you Spartacus raptures at this change; he first rann to the Fathers, embraceing them, pardon'd them, and gave them as many thankes for their conversion, as if he, had bin to enjoy the effect of it; Then he went to our generous Lovers, told them, that his private Comands to Euriles were much different from his publique one's, that he seem'd to be cruell, but to make their Fathers just, that he was glad an attempt against his Life had settled the felicity of theirs, which he would have gladly bought by the attempts, haveing bin turn'd into an execution. I should lose my selfe did I acquaint you with Perolla's & Izadora's extacyes with Pacuvius and Blacius's embraceings, their begging mutuall Pardons for a hate, which then was converted into as great a Freindship, & with all their gratitudes to Spartacus. To finish their Adventures, 'tis sufficient I tell you all things changed their Faces, & those Passions of Hatred, Feare, & Revenge resign'd their places unto Love, Freindship & Kindnes, & as soone as those wouds Perolla had receiu'd from the Sword, permitted him to heale those he had receiu'd from Love, he was put in Possession of his Izadora, which was a Felicity so farre above needing a foyle to set it off that his past troubles, & crosses were not consider'd, but forgott; And lest you should thinke I have the two Salapians, or Spartacus, I will tell you, that the former had abundant cause given them of satisfaction and the latters Adventures I will now resume, where I broake them off. PARTHENISSA. THE FIRST PRATE THE EIGHT BOOKE. Vnion, ...] Vnion, wherein he omitted nothing which might testify his satisfaction at it, That the Salapians might for ever remember, and be sharers in the joy; Spartacus assembl'd the cheifest of them together, and and in tearmes as obligeing as the action it selfe, inform'd them: That least they might alleage Perolla's Courage drew them into their misfortunes he protested, the Iust esteeme he had of it, and of his virtue, made him restore them to their former freedome; That for his sake, and the Faire Izadora's; he would immediatly withdrawe his Army from their City, which should never approach it againe but for their preservation, for which he would at any tyme relinquish his owne designes,  & repeate as great dangers to defend, as he had done to take it. This generous declaration (as they all profest) afforded them a satisfaction, farre transcending the greife they resented, for that losse, which gave my deare Master the power of thus obligeing them; & to publish their gratitude, aswell as contentment, they deputed immediatly from the body of the People, certaine select Cittizens to the generous Lovers, where after an Oration (too- tedious to be remembre'd,) they concluded, that since their owne sufferings, had bin the cause of Their Felicity, they were so farre from deploreing them, that they would wilingly vndergoe greater, if they might produce a resembling effect. These Ceremoyes were no sooner finisht, than Spartacus went to take his Leave of Perolla and Izadora, the last of which (in both their Names) conjur'd him to acquaint them who he was, for they could not fancy, so sublime a virtue had a disproportionable extraction. Alas Madam (said my Prince extreamly surpriz'd) what is it that you aske of me? then after some deepe sighes (which the reflection on his miseries forc't from him) he continu'd; I take the Gods for witnesses (faire Izadora) did not an inviolable vowe tye me to a concealement of my selfe, I would have satisfy'd your curiosity, as soone as I had knowne it but all that I dare informe you of, is, That I had my birth in Asia; that I am borne a Prince of the greatest blood of the World; that an infelicity in Love has not made me abandon my Country only, but my hopes, and forces me to languish in as high torments, as you are now in joyes. These sadd words, and the remembrance of the cause which produc'd them, strooke Spartacus with so black a melancholly that it prou'd contagious, and communicated it selfe to the faire Izadora and hir generous Servant, who judgeing what those misfortunes must be which could have so powerfull an assendent, over so admirable a Courage and Iudgement; immediatly conuerted those prayers which they had used for the learning of his adventures, for his Pardon in having desir'd a knowledge of them. After that Perolla in Civility, and Sympathy, had a while continu'd in silence, he at last interrupted it, by saying to Spartacus; Generous Prince (for I should have given your virtue that Title, had I yet bin ignorant of your Birth) since you are resolu'd that wee shall only know you by the felicity's you have plac't us in, permit me to offer you that Life you have preserv'd, and made me relish; perhaps it may serve you, and helpe to build for you, what you have perfected in me; I know the faire Izadora will dispence with my absence, when shee considers the Cause of it, and wilbe asmuch satisfy'd with my Gratitude, as with my Company. This I implore (continu'd Perolla) as the only meanes to let you know my resentments, whose greatnesse you cannot suspect, since I begg even to forsake Izadora, to acquaint you with them. This offer (said Spartacus embraceing Perolla) is farre more obligeing, than if it were acted, for I know no way which could render me more vnworthy of it, than the accepting it; Neither could I embrace so generous a motion, without being asmuch an Enemy to my owne happinesse, as to yours, for the only consolation in my misfortunes is, that they have put a period to yours, and by your abandoning the excellent Izadora, that also would be rauisht from me. I should never finish my Relation, did I acquaint you with all those noble Teares, and expressions, which were shedd, and spoken, at my Princes departure, but in a word, to describe the strange operation it had, not only Pacuvius and Blacius, but all the Salapians were vnconsolable, & so justly admir'd his virtues, that they almost accompted it a misfortune to returne to their former liberty, since the being depriv'd of his company, was the rate of that purchase. At last all the Divisions, & Squadrons, of my Princes Army martched our of the Citty, rather like Freinds, than Conquerors, and receiv'd at the Gates so liberall a Largesse, that they had asmuch reason to be satisfy'd with the Salapians as the Salapians had to be so with them; All the Nobility and Gentry, accompany'd him two miles on his Martch, where they made him so many fresh retributions for his Civilities, that he found his Sword had not bin the only thing which had couquer'd them. 'Twas at this last farewell that Spartacus having taken his leave of all the rest, reitterated his vowes of perpetuall Freindship to Perolla, whose greife was of a Nature not to be exprest by any thing, so well as silence. But alas those glories and Tryumphs lost that name, or at least their operation with my Prince, he languisht in the midst of prosperity, and had bin more oblig'd to Fortune, if shee had presented him with Death, in steed of Lawrells. All that day, and the next following he continu'd in so silent a melancholly, that those which knew not the Cause, admir'd at the Effect, but at last findeing, that Tyme did rather improve, than diminish it, I tooke the Confidence to conjure him by what he had so lately heard, to banish his despaire, that his Love could not be more improbable of successe than Perolla's had bin, and that I was confident the Gods had shew'd him so miraculous an example, to raise, and fortify his Faith. No no Symander (said my Prince) the Gods are resolv'd never to let me see the joyes of fruition, but in others; they will give me the power to create all Mens Felicities but my owne; and to speake Truth, they have so farre ruin'd me; that it is as litle in their Power now, as Wills to restore me; for Parthenissa is fallen into a Cryme which admitts no Cure, and hir loveing me againe, would but render hir more vnworthy of my Love for shee cannot now be kinde, but by a new vice; Had the cruell Gods bin pleas'd to have rais'd me but as great crosses as Perolla's, I might have struggl'd with, & perhapps overcome them aswell as he, & should never have repin'd at my afflictions, could I have propounded a possibility of ending them, but at the same Instant that they made me wretched, they made me vncapable of being otherwise, and gave me noe hopes in my Torments, but that their greatnesse would prove their cure; whereas when they made Blacius hate Perolla, they made Izadora have a Passion for him; when they brought him to be executed, he receiv'd his Life from Izadora's Love; the Cause of his preservation being more pleaseing than the preservation, and when they made Hanniball his Enemy, they made Izadora's Constancy his Freind, and gave it power to tryumph over all obstacles; so that all his Miseries were but demonstrations, and endeereings of his happinesse; he had never impossibilities to wrestle against, For if the Carthaginian, and Blacius, were destroy'd or converted, he had allwayes Izadora's Heart, & Armes, ready to receive him so that his obstructions (vnlike mine) were in the way, and not in the ende. 'Twas with a Thowsand such Reasons as these, that he answer'd mine, and indeed they were vtter'd with such violence, that findeing my argueing would rather Inflame, than lessen his greife, I determin'd to choose a fitter season for my designe. The night which succeeded this day, assoone as the Army was camp't, and the Guards plac't, Spartacus (who long'd to be in his design'd solitude) sent for all his Cheife Officers, and spoake to them to this effect. Since (my generous Companions) wee tooke up Armes only for our safetyes, & to repaire our wrongs, and since the Gods have contributed towards, and perfected our designes, it is high tyme to thinke of laying them downe; But before wee put this resolution in practice, let us face Rome, and shew Her by so bold an action, that what wee intend to performe, is our election, not our necessity; from thence, if their feares will not give us new occasions of Glory, let us martch directly to the Alpes, which haveing crost, every Man may returne into his owne Country, and I make no doubt, but passing thus through the heart of Italy, I shall loade you with asmuch Wealth, as Glory. I must acknowledge (said Symander) that he extended himselfe eloquently, & largely upon this Subject; But because I have so long dwelt on Izadoras story, I am resolu'd to repaire that fault by cutting off all things that are not absolutely essentiall in my Princes. This motion found it's wisht effect, for his Army were as desirous to secure what they had gotten, as my Prince was to be a Hermitt; & truely he so doted on reclusenesse, and upon any thing which nourisht his melancholly, that he would have preferr'd a Cell, before a Throne, and often told me, that since the Gods would not affoard him a Crowne of Myrtles, he would never weareone of Lawrell. In breife, the Senate haveing advice that wee tooke the direct way towards Rome, sent Gellius and Lentulus (both their Consulls) to meete us, as to the most dangerous Warre they could employ them in; and the whole People of Rome, by a Thousand Sacrifices, and publique Humiliations, acknowledg'd a feare, the justice of which, was soone made evident by an entire losse of their Armies, which in a pitch't feild, wee absolutly defeated; but this victory was bought, rather than wonne by Spartacus, for he purchast it by the losse of all the Germans in his Army, who in a Bravery having quitted that Post my Prince had assign'd them, found their destruction in their disobedience, and their punishment in their fault: Canitius who commanded them, came cover'd with wounds, & vow'd to Spartacus, that though he had bin a sharer in their sufferings, he was not in their Crime, which protestation my generous Master accepted as his excuse. But this Successe hinder'd us from veiwing Rome, though wee might have done it in a farre nobler Possture than at the first tyme, being now more loaden with successe, than then we had bin with Chaines. But my Prince who design'd to face those stately walls only because 'taws dangerous, now declin'd it because 'twas safe, and thought what he intended for a Gallantry, would looke (after the Consulls defeate) like an insulting; wee therefore left Rome on our left hand, & martcht without any opposition, into that Gaule which extends it's selfe along the famous River Poe, so celebrated by the Roman Poets, vnder the name of Eridanus. Cassius the Pretor, & Governor there, thought with a select Army of 10000 Men, & by the advantages, & straights of the Country, to interrupt our passage, but he found by the losse of his Army that Resolution, & Conduct, can overcome all obstacles; He had not the misfortune only to out-live his losse; but to carry the newes of it himselfe to the Senate, who were so highly troubl'd at these successive disasters, that immediatly as a punishment of the Consulls faults, or misfortunes, they recalled them, & gave the ordering of the Warre to Marcus Crassus (one of those that copos'd the first & greatest Triumuirate) and rais'd so vast an Army for him, that the Fame of it comeing to my Princes knowledge, it kindl'd that fire of Glory in him, which had bin so long cover'd; & made him lead back his victorious Troopes, towards this new Generall lest if ever he were discover'd, the World might thinke his abandoning Italy proceeded from the noyse of those forces, and not from a premeditated intent. Crassus attended by all the Gallantry of the Roman Empire joyfully vnderstood that Spartacus was saveing him the trouble of a Martch, and the lesse to harras his Army, expected my Princes approach in the fertile Playnes of Romania: To be short, the Night before the design'd Battell, Crassus sent Mummius (his Leiutenant Generall) with two select Legions, to lye in Ambush on the left Flanke of our Army, & strictly commanded him, that upon no provocation, he should discover himselfe 'till both Bodyes were joyn'd. But my Prince who is the vigilant'st Captaine living, and of whome no advantage is to be gotten, but what is given by Fate, sent two Souldiers in the Habits of Italian Women to a hight which was vnsecure for our Scouts, & which look't into the Roman Campe, where vnder a pretence of Sacrificeing for the safety of their Army, they became the Intellgencers of ours, & soone advertis'd Spartacus of this Stratagem, but before he could enguadge them, they had recover'd a fastnesse, where 'twas impossible to make use of Force, but yet next morning before, the Battell was ready to beginn, he gave Mummius so seemeing an advantage that thereby he himselfe gain'd a reall one, and by so sadd an argument as the cutting in peeces of 8000 Romans, made both the Leiutenant, and his Generall, of an opinion that he was invincible. Those that fledd, were againe receiv'd by Crassus, and haveing cast away their Armes to save their Lives, he furnisht them with new ones, but first made them give security, that they should keepe them better than they had the former, and then reviu'd that strict discipline of Decimation, where every Tenth Run-away was executed in the sight of the whole Army, so that 500 rann to receiue from their Freinds that Death with shame, which with lesse paine, & with honor, they might have had from their Enemyes. But for Mummius, his rebuke was so just and sharpe, that he withdrew himselfe from the Campe, and by a lingering Death justify'd, that whosoever in Warre vndertakes an attempt without Order, must either make victory his Apology, or render himselfe vncapable of makeing any other. This Breakfast hinder'd the Feast, for Crassus perceiveing a pannicke terror in all his Souldiers, would not expose those to our Swords, whose feares had already halfe conquer'd them, but was so much more a Freind to his Country, than his Ambition, that he advis'd the Senate to send for Pompey back, and rather endeavour to preserve, than increase their Empire. Three dayes successively my generous Prince presented the Romans Battell, and the fourth day, as he was goeing to take up his late designe of martching over the Alpes, & afterwards of confineing himselfe eternally in their greatest horrors he receiv'd a solemne Embassy from those Sicilians which had cast off the Roman Yoake, wherein they protested, That his Fame, & not their necessity made them chuse him their Prince; That though the latter was pressings, yet the former was the only motive of their election; That he could not employ his Armes more gloriously, nor more charitably, than for their defence; that the only hope that his Courage would protect them, inflam'd theirs; but if they were supprest before he came, they would sell their Ruine so deerely, that he should not be asham'd to acknowledge them His; and that they would all take up that consolation at their deaths, that they dy'd Subjects to the great Spartacus. The Sicilian Deputies accompany'd their Oration with so many Teares, that my generous Master, though he declin'd the Title of their Prince, yet he did not that of their Freind, and haveing compos'd a considerable body of Men, aswell for their numbers, as their Resolutions, he conuoy'd them with all his Army to the Farr of Messina, and from thence sent them over into Sicily, where they renew'd the Warre with such successe, as at length that fertile Iland was upon the point of changeing their old Lords. The dayly intelligence of our Companions victories, and of the wealth which attended them, so fixt all our Army upon participating of both, that they vnanimously begg'd Spartacus to finish their labours, by setleing them in so delitious a Country, who willingly yeelded to their requests, perceiveing that Crassus absolutely declin'd a Battell, and that now he might with honor prosecute his old designe, haveing no Enemyes that durst oppose him, and haveing given his Souldiers for their Reward one of the pleasantest Kingdomes in the world. Consider, I beseech you, how deepe a roote his Melancholly had, when Tryumphs, nor the Empire of Rome (which he might almost as easily have possest as desir'd, could neither teare it up, or so much as shake it; and truely to the best of my observation, I never perceiv'd him pleas'd but in dangers & never so much troubl'd as when he had avoyded them; which I attributed to the hight of his Greife, whose torment was so great a burthen, that he would even have joy'd if Death itselfe, had eas'd him of it. But to effect this determination, vnderstanding that Menas ridd with a good Fleete in that small Channell which separates Italy, from Sicily, he employ'd an Expresse to him, who by large promises, and Guifts, receiu'd an assurance from him, that if my Prince would martch with his Army into a Pen-insule of the Reggians, where there was good Quarters for his Army, and a good Road for his Fleete he would not faile within Tenn dayes, there to receive and obey his Commands. Immediatly the Messenger return'd with this dispatch, and soone after Spartacus mou'd with his Army to the place assign'd, where after twice Tenn dayes expectation, insteed of discovering a Fleete, wee only perceiu'd a single Gally, which haveing cast Anchor, Mann'd a small Skiffe and sent a Gentleman on shoare, attended only by two Slaves, who informeing the Guards that he desir'd to speake with Spartacus, was immediatly conducted to his Tent, where he soone found it was that Gallippus who had made Pompey so just a Carracter of him, that it had like to have procur'd his liberty. My Prince remembring it us'd him with exceeding Civility, and the first Complements being past, Gallippus thus spake to him. Sir, I am employ'd by Menas to acquaint you, that as he was weighing Anchor for this Iland wee perceiv'd a Sayle to the Wind-ward of us, and haveing immediatly sent a swift Brigantine to bring us an accompt of hir, they both came to the Fleete, where Domitius, one of Pompey's greatest Favourites, presented my Admirall with a Letter from the Generall, (all written with his owne hand) which was to conjure him, as ever he valu'd his Freindship, that laying all other designes a part, he would immediatly come to him with his Nauy to Dyrrhachium, where then he was, and where he would expect him, being newly return'd from the Asian Warre, and from the defeate of Mithridates. This Letter (continu'd Gallippus) was accompany'd with such earnest, & reitterated desires, from the valiant Domitius, that at last Menas, who fancy'd the businesse could not be but of exceeding consequence, since Pompey thought fitt to make him the Messenger, & not being above eighteene howres Sayle, & the winde sudden veering about to the Southwest which was as opposite for our sayleing this way as faire for Greece, yeelded to his request, and in two Nights, & a day, haveing crost the Adriattick Gulph which separates that Country, from Italy, cast Anchor at Dyrrachium, where my Admirall and I waited upon the great Pompey, who first shew'd us letters from the Senate (occasion'd by the apprehensions Crassus had of your Army) which recalld him out of Asia, to finish the Bond mens warre, (for that was (said Symander) the appellation the Romans gave it) Then Pompey further told him, that being inform'd by a Shipp which accidentaly came from Messina, that Spartacus had contracted with him to transport him into Sicily; he had sent for him purposely to hinder it, & to desire him as he valu'd the title of being esteem'd a Freind to Rome, not to transport those Slaves from the Romans Revenge & his Glory, but as Italy had bin the Scene of their Rebellion, so to let it be of their Ruine. Pompey joyn'd with those words so many other pressing motives, and perswasions, that Menas desir'd that Nights respite to forme his Resolution, which was readily yeelded unto. I confesse Sir (said Gallippus) that the feare I had of my Admiralls yeelding (for who-soever considers whether he shall doe ill, has already don it) made me take the confidence (after we were retyr'd) to tell him; That he ought to preferre the being a Freind to virtue, above the being one to the People of Rome; that the way he tooke, made him vnworthy of the ende; and that to deserve that Title without possesseing it, was nobler than to possesse it, without deserveing it. I know (Menas hastily reply'd) all thou say'st is true, but canst thou wonder Gallippus that a Genius which has triumph't over Europe, Affrick, and Asia, should now vanquish Menas? No, no, all things yeelding to that Great Man, makes it no shame for me to immitate them. In a word, seeing I could not make him continue your Freind, I made him vowe he would not be your Enemy. The next morning Pompey haveing repeated his Charmes, obtain'd from my Admirall an assurance not to serue you, on condition, not to be employ'd against you, There were some of the Roman Collonells which mov'd, that Menas should take you a-board, and then carry you to Dyrachium, but that, both He & Pompey detested, the last alleageing he would not cheate himselfe of a victory. This being thus determin'd, my Admirall thought fitt to employ me to acquaint you with what had past, to begg your excuse, to returne your presents, and to protest, that nothing but the great Pompey could have made him violate his enguadgement. Gallippus thus finisht his discourse, at which my Prince was extreamly troubl'd, as indeede he was at all things that retarded his retirement, but least his melancholly might be misinterpreted, he made haste to returne him this Answer. If your Admirall had bin principle'd like you, he would never have vndertaken to serue me, or haveing enguadg'd himselfe, would have perform'd it, but tell him from me, I am very much my owne Flatterer, if what he has done to make the Romans his Freinds, will not produce a contrary effect: for by necessitating me to stay in Italy, he will too necessitate me to conquer it, and that haveing hitherto had noe designes but of revenge; he will now inspire me with those of Ambition, & force me against my will to be victorious: But (my Prince continu'd) because you have so generously oppos'd your Captaines breach of promise, I give your virtue that Reward I should have given his Services; and thereupon presented him all those Guifts that Menas had return'd, which Gallippus made some scruple to accept, but at last tooke: And then in acknowledgement of my Princes generosity, offer'd him to Saile into Sicily, and there to hire as many Shipps for his Service as would transport his Army thither, which Spartacus absolutely declin'd, alleadgeing that he would not have his Gratitude hazard his Ruine, & that since Pompey was comeing into Italy, he had now left the designe of abandoning it, being 'twas only taken up because he could see no Enemyes there, but those which were his Prisoers. Gallippus admir'd at his Gallantry, & haveing made him a million of enguadgements to Sacrifice, his Life and Fortune, when the honor of his Service should affoard him an occasion, tooke his leave, and return'd towards his Gally: But the report of his Message to my Prince being diffus'd over the Campe, fill'd some of the Comon-Souldiers with such a blinde rage, that not being able to discharge their Fury on Menas for the violation of his promise, and for leaueing of them (as they falsely said) a prey to Pompey's victorious Troopes, they determin'd to punish the Innocent for the Guilty, and make Gallippus pay for his Captains Crime, who not suspecting any treachery of that Nature, was setting foote in his Skiffe, attended only by his two Slaves, when a Crowde of those insolent Men fell upon him; at first he endeavour'd to appease them with an information of their error, but perceiveing they were deafe to all Reason, he retir'd into the Sea to his middle that none might come behinde him, & there with his Sword resolued to sell his Life. One of his Slaves in immitatition of him, gott an Oare, and being joyn'd to his Captaine, twice preserv'd his Life, and gave so large a proofe of a singuler Courage, that my Prince (upon heareing of this barbarisme, being runn thither) admir'd it, and judg'd that his condition was not answerable to his Clothes but though Spartacus presence and threatnings qualify'd, yet it did not extinguish the Tumult, which he no sonner obseru'd, than with his Sword, haveing kill'd Three of the most violent; he ended the disorder by causeing five others to be executed upon the place. All things thus appeas'd and Gallippus come out of his Fortification, my deare Master begg'd a thowsand Pardons of him, that his Souldiers had so far violated the law of Nations, & that if he esteem'd the punishment already inflicted not sufficient for their Crime, he permitted him to be his owne Iudge. Gallippus assur'd him that he had rather bin too-severe than too- partiall, and haveing by many Complements repay'd his Civility, my Prince desir'd to see that Slave, whose Fidelity, and valour, deseru'd so plentifull a charracter. Gallippus instantly call'd him, & spite of his Habit and some blood which endeavour'd to disfigure him, Spartacus, obseru'd that his Shape, & Meene, were answerable to his Courage, and after a litle reflection on the inequallity of Fate in bestowing him such ornaments if his extraction were like his Habit, or if the contrary, in giveing such blessings so disproportionate a Fortune, he very intentively obseru'd the Slave, and found that the Slave was not lesse fixt in lookeing upon him. This made him remember he had once seene some features not vnresembling his, and as he was calling to mind where it had bin, he heard him fetch a deepe sigh, and say to himselfe: oh Gods! what is it that I see? am I deluded; or have I already found what I seeke? These few words (which were lowde enough for Spartacus to heare) put him into strange disorders, sometymes he cast his Eyes upon him that spoake them, somtymes upon the ground, now trembling and lookeing pale, and then instantly blushing: The poore Slave did not only observe those alterations, but immitated them, which wholly converted my Princes suspitions into a certainty, but the better to confirme himselfe, he drew him aside, and haveing whisper'd something in his Eare, they both, to our great admiration embraced one another with admirable transports; I was present whilst all this was acting, and was so ravisht with the strangenesse, and intricacy of the adventure, that before I could goe to discover what it mean't, I perceiu'd them both returning to Gallippus, to whome my Prince said, He that was once your Slave (Gallippus) now beggs one of you, but doe's not intend so much to wrong your valours wages as to expect him as guift: the hight of my desires is, that you will let me have him at any Ransome, & if those Treasures I possesse be not of sufficient value, I will lose my Army and my Selfe, but I will present you too, all those in the Capitoll. Gallippus who relisht nothing of his profession, and who thought to excuse himselfe to Menas in giveing the Slave his liberty, for the service he had that day render'd him reply'd; Generous Spartacus, you have pay'd his Ransome in desireing his liberty, which from this instant I give him, & all I expect in exchange is, that you will beleive I have bin lesse beholding to him in twice saveing my Life, than in furnishing me with the happinesse of obligeing you. At this noble answer my deare Master rann with open Armes to embrace him that made it, & then sent me for his Cabbinet, from whence he tooke out many Iewells of an immence value, and by plaine force made him accept them. Then Gallippus haveing acknowledg'd my Princes liberality in words as ample as the cause of them, and embraced a thousand tymes his enfranchis'd Slave, tooke of both, his last farewell, and went from them with as high a satisfaction as he had left them in. Gallippus being gone, Spartatacus return'd to his Tent, leading his Slave with him in so high raptures of joy, that both his lookes, and actions testify'd them. They were no sooner come thither, than he desir'd all that accompany'd him (but I) to give him an hower or two's privacy, & then he fell againe to repeate his transports with so much earnestnesse, that I beleiu'd in those very embraceings he had lost the thought of ever doeing the like to Parthenissa; but at last perceiveing, my astonishment was the effect of my ignorance, he was so charitable as to tell me, what! Symander doe you not knowe the Prince Sillaces? At those words my Eyes were vnseal'd, & I admir'd asmuch all that while, I knew him not, as then I was happy in doeing it. I will passe by telling you how I flung my selfe at his Feete, how I embrac't his knees, & how I washt them with my Teares, since all my extravagancyes were interrupted by Spartacuse's, who lov'd so passionatly his Freind, that he could not be at quiet, 'till he had askt him what strange adventure had reduc'd him to the sadd condition he found him in. I know not (said Sillaces) if it be a strange, but I am certaine 'tis an advantagious one, for when I least expected to finde my liberty, and my desires, I have lighted upon both; 'tis you (my deare Artabbanes) that I seeke, and 'tis only in that employment I have suffer'd miseries, which nothing could render tollerable, but the reflecting upon him for whose sake I endur'd them. The Gods forbidd (my Prince reply'd) that I should be the cause of your sufferings, they are not sure so cruell as to render my misfortunes infectious, and to make those that share in my Freindshipp, to participate in my Miseries. You have none (Sillaces answer'd) vnlesse you contracted them since you left Parthenissa. Certainly (said my Prince exceedingly astonisht) when you speake thus, you looke upon my resolution, and not my condition, for there has nothing happen'd since I abandon'd that fatall Country, which could affoard me any ease of my torments, but what I found in my courage, and resentments. Alas! (reply'd Sillaces) are you still in that Darknesse which your jealousye cast you into? must you beleive Parthenissa criminall, 'till you appeare so your selfe? and must I shew you your fault to shew you your happinesse? Yes yes (he continu'd) I see your suspitions will vanish no other way, prepare your selfe then to heare a Story, which these two yeares I have sought you out to tell you, and beleive it with that Faith you would an Oracle, for nothing it delivers is more certaine. That which Sillaces tells me (said my Prince) I allwayes credit at that rate. You had best (he reply'd) not decline that practice now, for what I must acquaint you with, will asmuch neede your Faith, as the cure of your afflictions will stand in neede of it. Spartacus at these last words, had too great an impatience to delay the satisfying it by any reply, which Sillaces perceiveing, began this ensveing relation. with Surena, Arsaces (as he vsually did) was walkeing in those plesant Feilds which are water'd by the Ryuer Tygris, and as they were the shortest way to Niniue from the place you faught in, so he had not long bin there, but he perceiv'd some Fower or Five Men advanceing towards him, carrying something betwixt them, which by the great care they shew'd of their loade, manifested how much they were concern'd in it; But they were no sooner come neere enough to know it was the King, than one of them leaveing his Companions, came with all the visible signes of an exquisite Greife,  & flung himselfe at Arsaces Feete, where the aboundance of Teares he shedd, hinder'd him a while from shewing the cause of them, but at last (though his words were interrupted with many sighes) he told the King, I am come (Sir) to demand justice against one, who has not only contemn'd your Lawes, but you also. 'Tis against Artabbanes that I aske it, who this morning sent Surena a Challenge, whose courage has bin so vnfortunate, that this last proofe of it, has (I feare) render'd him vncapable of ever giveing any other: Yes (Sir) 'tis his Body that wee are carrying back, and his Murtherer is fledd, who could I have overtaken, I would never have implor'd any other Sword of Iustice for my revenge, than my owne, & either punisht the Killer of my Brother, or not resented the misery of surviveing him. That word of Brother made us soone knowe 'twas Vixores that spoak it, & truely he so mingl'd his Greife with his expressions, that Arsaces who (you know) doted on that Favourite was so inflam'd, that he protested by a world of horrid Oathes, you should never enter into his Dominions, but to bring your head upon a Scaffold. Then running to Surena's Body, he flung himselfe upon it, and by kissing his pale and bloody Face, and a thousand such other extravagancyes, publisht his Freind hipp and his Greife. I know not whether the motion in carrying, or Arsaces tormenting him was the cause, but we soone perceiv'd that he began to breath, and suddenly after faintly to open his Eyes. oh Gods! into what transports did this discovery cast Orodes in, truely he was thereby so overjoy'd, that he perform'd many things vnworthy of his yeares, and Majesty; but that these good symptomes might be improv'd, a Litter was instantly brought, Surena putt into it, and carry'd to his owne Pallace, accompany'd (on Foote by Arsaces and all the Court. The Chyrurgions haveing immediatly sercht and bound up his wounds, tould the impatient King, that 'till the third dressing, they could make no possitive judgement of his Life, but they assur'd him, if his cure lay in the power of Art, they durst boldly promise it. I was present whilst all this was acting, and as soone as I found they left Surena to his rest, I stoale out of the Company and went to Parthenissa, in hope to learne the subject of your difference, but alas I found hir so droun'd in weepeings, that I forgott a while the Cause of my visit, to heare hir Company in that sadd employment, at length observeing that my weakenesse did but augment hirs, I interrupted hir Teares by desireing to learne the subject of them, for if shee knew no more than I, shee had no just cause for so immoderate an affliction. Alas Sillaces (shee reply'd) have not you then vnderstood what I Came from being inform'd of, that Artabbannes has kill'd Surena, and being fledd, Arsaces has solemnly bound himselfe by sacred oathes, that the reparation of his Offence shalbe a perpetuall banishment? Madam (said I) 'tis true indeed, Arsaces in his Passion when he thought Surena dead, swoare what you say, but since, 'tis found that 'twas only a long swoun'd he was fallen into, & that the hopes of his Life are greater than the feares of his Death, so that I beleive the King will repent and recall his vowes. But Sillaces (shee hastily reply'd) doe you tell me this as a Truth; or to flatter my Greife? I tell you it (Maddam said I) as the former, for I pay you too-high a respect to delude you into a greater sorrowe, which I should vnavoydably performe, did I give you a falce subject of joy. Then (shee said) one of my greatest feares is supprest, but I am doubtfull, I shall not so easily silence the other, which is (for, to you I dare boldly tell my Thoughts) I apprehend I am the innocent cause of this disorder, & that Surena findeing the advantage Artabbanes had over him in my Affection, has taken this fatall way to destroy his Ryvall. No, no, Madam (I reply'd, though I cannot tell you the Cause of their difference, yet I can assure you, that which you mention is not it, for Vixores relation to the King made us evidently vnderstand, that the Challenge came from Artabbanes. oh Gods! (shee immediatly reply'd) what is it Sillaces that you tell me? you have made my admiration as great as my greife; thereupon shee began to renewe hir weepeing with such violence, that I have often since beleiv'd some Divine foreknowledge of your suspitions, produced hir Teares; For my particular, I was at first as ignorant of their Cause, as perplext at their Effect, but at last remembring that 'twas at my last words shee resum'd hir Greife, to repaire my Error, I told hir perhaps (Madam) Vixores relation had more of designe than Truth, and knowing that the Kings Edicts were only rigorous against the Senders & not the Accepters of Challenges, he to exasperate Arsaces fury, & extenuate his Brothers Crime, made that to be Artabbanes which was Surena's Offence. Alas (said the faire Parthenissa) would your conjecture were certaine, 'twould exempt me from feares which makes me tremble: But Sillaces (shee continu'd) if you have any sence of that affliction my suspence has cast me into, I conjure you to enquire certainly & particulerly what has happen'd, for I verily beleive the knowledge of what I apprehende could hardly prove a higher misery than are my doubts. I was so earnest to obey hir, that immediatly I went to Lindadory's, aswell to satisfy my inclination as my Duty to Parthenissa's comands, for I was confident, your Sister was aswell instructed with your affaires as any other could be; but alas I discover'd nothing there but fresh causers of saddnesse, & found by a melancholly experiment, that the resentments of Nature, are as violent, as those of Love, or Freindshipp, & at my first comeing in, though I had arm'd my selfe against all weakenesses of that quality, yet the faire Lindadoryes Teares were so eloquent, that I thought it no Sinne to immitate them, & haveing mingl'd ours together for our common losse, I began to doe that for hir, which I needed asmuch my selfe; in breif I so fortify'd hir hopes, by assureing hir you could not be dangerously wounded, since you had strength enough to flye from Arsaces choller, and that Surena being in a probability of recovering, 'twas not vnlikely to make him recall a rash vowe, where the performance would be a greater Sinne than the breach of it, that in the end I moderated hir afflictions, and then acquainting hir how I was employ'd by the vnconsolable Parthenissa, shee permitted me to follow my enquiry, which though extreame dilligent, was absolutely fruitlesse, for though I ask't of Zephalinda, and shee of all hir Brothers Servants, & Confidents, yet we could no more discover the occasion of your difference, than suppresse the troubles it created. All this while Arsaces sufferings were not inferior to ours, that vnfortunate Prince never abandon'd his Favourites Chamber, and by promiseing excessive rewards to the Chirurgions, courted their Art and diligence; but now the tyme was come in which they were to give their positive judgements of Surena's life, & whilst they were takeing off their Plaisters, the poore Orodes stood all pale, and trembling, and in a farre worse perplexity, than if their sentence were to have bin pronounc'd upon himselfe; at last Surena's wounds being perfectly view'd, the Chyrurgions found they were exceedingly inflam'd, and so many symptomes of their being inwardly gangrin'd, that they all with Teares in their Eyes acquainted Arsaces, that it lay not in the power of any thing but a Miracle to recover him, at this fatall declaration, the King (fetching a deepe sigh) fell speechlesse on the ground, and Surena perceiveing so high demonstrations of his favour, made such excellent and passionate retributions for them, & so admirably exclaim'd against, Fate, not for ending his Life, but for not permiting him to end it in so generous a Princes service, that all which heard him, found his impiety, rather a justtice, than a Crime. Arsaces being by many remedies recovered from his fainting, was (before he had the strength to speake) carry'd out of his Favourites Chamber, who no sooner perceiu'd it emptty of all but his Domesticks, sent one of them for the Princesse Zephalinda, who being come, was conjur'd by him; to obtaine from Parthenissa for him, the honor of a visit, to whom he protested he had some secrets of importance to communicate, which should he dye before they were reveal'd, would leave too great a horror on his Conscience. The faire Zephalinda immediatly obey'd his injunction, and came to waite on Parthenissa, when shee, & I, were admireing at the occasion of your silence. The saddnesse which so visibly appear'd in Zephalinda's Face, was at first attributed by us both entirely to that vnimmitable Freindship that generous Princesse pay'd you, but wee soone found, that Nature had a large share in it. When shee had inform'd Parthenissa with the occasion of hir visit, your faire Mistris was extreamly startl'd at it, whether it proceeded from a Prophecy of what shee afterwards learn'd, out of sympathy with Zephalinda, or from that sadd banishment which would inevitably follow by your Ryvalls Death; but to contract your suspension, I will not informe you of all those pressing motiues his generous Sister us'd to obtaine hir desires, since 'tis enough you know they were successefull. But Parthenissa was no sooer retir'd into hir Chaber, to make hir selfe ready for the intended visit, than one of hir Servants came to informe me, that a Country Man which had sought me at my owne house, & mist of me there, (being acquainted where I was) was come to speake with me, having a Packett, which he said was of some consequence. Zephalinda, (though shee knew 'twas you which had reduced hir Brother to that extreamity, never lessen'd hir Freindshipp, but was so generous as to professe shee was cofident 'twas Surena, not you that was the cause of hir misfortune) & was so earnest with me to satisfy hir opinio, which was that those letters were from you, that to obey hir I was vncivill, & left hir alone to goe & receive them. The superscription I scarcely lookt upon, when I knew it to be your hand, & transported with joy, I rann up to Zephalinda, and with hir into Parthenissa's Chamber, where I assur'd them, that not only I should now know your condition, but the cause of your Duell; But alas assoone as I open'd my Packett, I found a letter for the King, and another for Zephalinda, but none for hir which did most desire, & most meritt one; I confesse my disorder at it was not farre short of hirs, but shee attributing your silence to any subject rather than the trve one, and beleiveing my letter might discover the cause, conjur'd me to peruse it; But oh Gods! what astonishment was mine, when I found what it contain'd? it made me a long tyme continue silent, and trembling, and Zephalinda had no sooner ended hirs, but it ingender'd the same Effect; Parthenissa who could not fancy (since you were liveing as appear'd by your letters) what strange accident could produce such an operation, broake hir owne silence, to learne the occasion of ours. Alas madam (I reply'd) you wilbe more happy in the ignorance, than the knowledge of it. If (said shee) I knew not Artabbanes to be liveing, your words would make me suspect he were dead. No, no, Madam Zephalinda answer'd, the certainty he is alive, is not greater, than haveing committed his Crime, he is vnworthy to continue so. Is it possible (said Parthenissa) that he cann commit a Cryme, which may render him worthy of Death in your judgement? Yes Madam (shee reply'd) & when you have read this letter (presenting hirs to Parthenissia) I beleive you will be of my judgement; whilst he was the Destroyer of Surena, I excus'd the action upon the beleife I had that he was invited to it by justice, but now I have discover'd he can suspect your Constancy, & convert a Passion of Love, vnjustly into one of hatred, he shall find I can from his Freind, become his Iudge, and when his actions are ill, not feare to tearme them so. Whilst Zephalinda was thus speakeing, the vnfortunate Parthenissa read hir letter, and no sooner found what was in it, than fetching a languishing sigh from the bottome of hir Heart, shee only said, alas, Artabbanes how ill doe you reward the purest Flame, and then fell downe at our Feete, without giveing any signes of Life. Zephalinda who thought the sight of hir letter, would have rather inspir'd hir with resentment, than greife, a thousand tymes condemn'd hir owne rashnesse, & by an abundant weepeing, discover'd hir repentance for it; but at last what with hir helpe and mine, wee brought Parthenissa to hir selfe againe, but indeede shee employ'd that life wee restor'd hir to to torment hir selfe so excessively, that we found our charity was a disobligation. Yes Artabbanes, had you but seene how shee deplor'd your inconstancy, & how transcendent hir passion was, even when shee thought you vnworthy of it, I am confident the knowledge how you were lou'd, would have sufficiently punnisht your beleife that you were not Surena in the meae while, findeing his forces very much diminisht, and apprehending he should not have life enough left to disclose that which would make his Death a lesse misfortune, sent a Servant of his to knowe the cause of Zephalinda's stay, who findeing Parthenissa so well recover'd, as not to neede hir helpe, went to give hir Brother an accompt of hir employment; but he hardly was inform'd what had happen'd, when he conjur'd his Sister with fresh impatiency's, to begg Parthenissa to affoard him the blessing of seeing hir before he dy'd, for he had somthing to reveale, which might sett a period to hir Greise, and which he protested was of so high a cocearnment, that she should never repent the visit. With this Message Zephalinda return'd, and though Parthenissa was in extreame disorder, yet wee both so effectually employ'd our prayers, that wee obtain'd what they desir'd, & were no sooner come into Surena's Chamber, than he begg'd all but your faire Mistris, to goe out of it, which being perform'd he told hir; (Madam) I know the incivility of puting you to this trouble, and of leaveing you alone in this Roome, is so great, that nothing but my weakenesse could render it excusable; I know too, that as some expressions of my joy for this transcendent honor, I should cast my selfe at your Feete; but Madam, what is my appologie for the former, must be also for the latter. I should too (I must confesse) be offended at these wounds, which necessitates me to this rudenesse; but Madam, so much is the respect I pay you, that I cannot be troubl'd at my owne torment, when I consider it as a punishment of haveing betray'd you, at those words the faire Parthenissa fell fresh a weepeing, which Surena perceiveing, he cry'd out, oh Gods! would I were so blest as to be the object and not the occasion of those Teares; but alas (he continu'd) 'tis in vaine to expect a felicity which the Gods, aswell as a perfection as great as theirs, thinkes me vnworthy of. Know then Madam, that I have bin wicked, in expectation to be happy, but haveing lost the hopes of the latter, I will no longer-practice the former; Yes (faire Parthenissa) those Eyes which are vnresistable, had that influence over me, which they have over all they looke upon, or they which looke on them, and inspir'd me with a flame, whose violence forc'd me to embrace any remedy, that might moderate it; and findeing that my continuall sighes, did rather coole than enflame your brest, I could not fancy but some other possest, what I sought: To resolve this suspition, I courted Zianthes favour with such humblenesse and assiduity; that at last I obtain'd it, and from hir learnt that Artabbanes was the happy man which blasted all my joyes, and possest what I but ambition'd; I must confesse, when I reflected on that seemeing passion he had for Zephalinda, I wonder'd for a while at that Truth, but upon that publique breach betwixt them, I began to beleive the Mistery, & soone after, to apprehend by Moneses resentment, to see it too-visibly; This made me hasten Arsaces declaration in my favour, in expectation that Artabbanes would not oppose his King, but I quickly found by Zianthes intelligence, that all the operation it produc'd, was only a necessitating you to mannage your Amours with greater privacy, and a bringing of an accession to your aversion for me. This discovery had so powerfull a production, that in its effects, I had like to have found the cure of all my troubles, and an exemption from needing that forgivenesse, which I acknowledge I cannot be more ambitious, than I am vnworthy of; would to the Gods faire Parthenissa I had bin so happy, for then I had dy'd with this satisfaction, that I had only merited your pitty, and not your hatred; but the higher Powers which forme our Fates, and permitt us not to make them, ordain'd the contrary, and Arsaces, who was too-much concern'd in my Life, not to contribute every thing which might preserve it, so necessarily conjur'd me to discover the cause of my languishings, that at last I obey'd him, & gave him a true accompt of all which Zianthe had inform'd me. At first, that generous King, would publiquely have taken notice to Artabbanes, of his dareing to contradict, what he had so openly manifested was his intention, & then by some rigorous penalty, have commanded him never more to see you againe; but I absolutely oppos'd this proceeding, by representing to the King, that it would infallibly ruine Zianthe, who being the only Confident of your Loves, must be immediatly knowne to be the discoverer of them; that by loseing my Intelligencer I should lose my hopes; and that his violence to Artabbanes, might perhapps hinder the progresse of his passion, but nothing advantage mine. I will not trouble you with all those reasons I us'd to make Arsaces decline that overture, since at last he did it, and immediatly caus'd me to send privatly for Zianthe, where giveing hir large Presents, and larger Hopes, and by telling hir how infinitly he was concearn'd in my recovery, so en'irely gain'd, hir that shee promis'd him, not only to leave no meanes vnessay'd which might cast a jealousy betwixt you, and your Artabbanes, but also to act any thing I propounded which might conduce to that end. This assurance, which 'till then by all my Artes I could never drawe from hir, gave me my health, by restoreing my hopes, for I could not despaire of vanquishing all difficulties, when I had so powerfull an Assistant; But Madam for a long tyme wee could not fixe upon any designe proportionate to our desires, 'till the Tabienian Revolt, which necessitated Arsaces to raise a vast Army, to repaire that affront they had done his Leiutenants, and to reduce them to their obedience. This I elected as the fittest opportunity to act, what I intended, & besought the King before that Army was form'd, not to declare who should be the Generall, but afterwards to make Artabbanes, & the same Night he gave him his Commission, to enjoyne him by inviolable commands, next morning to goe to his charge; This was perform'd as I desir'd, & the same Euening in which Arsaces gave Artabbanes his orders, I made Zephalinda (who I durst not informe of my resolutions, for I found hir more inclin'd to your Interests, than mine) to invite you to a Ball, where, whilst you were diverting your selfe, I writt a letter to you as if that Command Arsaces had given Artabbanes, was by your advice to me, that we might dureing his absence enjoy a satisfaction which his vigilancy, and presence deny'd us, and fill'd the rest of the letter with some expressions which might make him conjecture you had long honor'd me with a private Passion. This Letter I sent Zianthe, & cojur'd hir to let it so fall into Artabbanes hands, as if it had bin by accident, for I knew he would waite your returne at your owne Lodgeings, to kisse your hands before his departure. All this was so admirably acted by Zianthe, that it produc't the wish't effect; (as that very Night shee advertis'd me) & the more to confirme him in his error, I caus'd a small Christall lookeing Glasse to be made, by one of the rarest Artists in Asia, and by a false screw I artificially put my Picture betwix't the Case and the Glasse, and some tyme before, sent a Marchant to sell it you, which he did, the curiosity of the worke inviteing you (as I was confident) to buy it. This Glasse you so justly priz'd, that for the most part you carry'd it about you, & valu'd it, so much above any thing of that nature, that Artabbanes tooke notice of it. Zianthe therefore after shee had reveal'd unto him what by the readeing of my letter shee seem'd shee could not well any longer conceale, the better to confirme the fallacy, shew'd Artabbanes the lookeing Glasse which he well observ'd you had often worne, & then by opening the private screw, discover'd that to him, which you never knew of your selfe, and so excellently insinuated, that the esteeme you plac't upon it, proceeded more from that which was conceal'd in it, than from that which was visible, that being fill'd with a rage which render'd him vncapable of all things but Revenge, he went away, & goeing downe the Stayres, mett with a Servant of mine in the darke whome I had expressely sent thither, who seemeing to take him for one of yours, desir'd him to tell Zianthe that you lay that Night at my Lodgeings with Zephalinda, and that he was sent purposely to waite upon hir thither. You know Madam (continu'd Surena) that all that Night you honor'd my Sister with your Company, for when you were returning late, I caus'd one of the wheeles of your Charriot to be so dexterously broaken, that upon the first motion it fell all to-peices, so that you were necessitated to remaine at my house, which the deluded Artabbanes attributed to a contrary cause, and thought, that to put the greater Complement upon me, you evaded allowing him the honor of takeing leave; for his being made Generall, and his resolusion of goeing next morning to his charge, was so suddenly diuulg'd, that I am confident all Ninive except those of my house knew it in an hower; but there, I had taken such strict order, that none should speake of it, that it came not to your knowledge. Artabbanes therefore without so much as answering my servant, retir'd to his owne house, where, had I seene the effects my delusion produc'd, I had (it may be) repented it. But Madam his Greifes had another operation than I expected, for I beleiv'd the being so egregiously abus'd, would have made him decline any resolutions, but those of hateing you, and have induced him to vent his despaire, upon the revolted Tabienians, in which tyme by the assistance of your resentments for his so abandoning you, and my humility, and constant passion, I was not out of hopes to gaine, what he had lost; but it seemes he abandon'd himselfe so entirely to Revenge, that as he had lost the hopes of possessing you, so he resolv'd to endeavour I should weare his Livery; in persuance whereof he sent me a Challenge, which I could not decline, for he that has the courage to adore you cannot want it to dispute you, which I did, but the Gods (who will not suffer infidelity to prosper not in Love it selfe, where 'tis lest vnlawfull) gave him an advantage over me, which perhaps upon a juster subject he could not so easily have gain'd. Whilst Sillaces (said Symander) was makeing this Relation, my poore Master was in so many severall disorders, that in my life I never sawe a subject fitter for pitty; But no sooner had his generous freind disclos'd this fatall Treachery, than he cry'd out o Gods, o Gods, Sillaces: what is it you tell me? I tell (he reply'd) that, which, if your vnjust suspition had not bin too-predominant, Parthenissa would have inform'd you of, and thereby exempted hir selfe, you, and all your Freinds, from that misery, your precipitate and voluntary Banishment has cast us into; but be not so cruell to your selfe, as to interrupt me in that which makes your wound, and not permit me to apply the cure. Alas (said Artabbanes) 'tis not in your power, for though Parthenissa should by an excesse of goodnesse pardon my Cryme, yet that it selfe would but increase it, by demonstrating I have offended the greatest Mercy, as well as the greatest Beauty. You are (said Sillaces) very ingenious to persecute your selfe, and your willfullnesse is admirable; you will runn into a storme, and then refuse the harbour. No generous Freind (Artabbanes answer'd) that which you call a wilfulnesse, is a justice, since for a Criminall to embrace Life, when his Conscience wilbe more severe than his Iudge can be, is to become asmuch an Enemy to himselfe, as to Iustice. If (said Sillaces) you will not permitt me to finish my relation, for the interest you have in it, yet at least let me obtaine that favour, as a reward of those sufferings I have vndergone, to bring you newes which I thought would not have bin altogether vnacceptable. I begg a thousand tymes your pardon (said my Prince) if the effects of my despaire have bin so vncivill, but as a pennance for it, I will no more interrupt your relation, but listen to it with asmuch silence, as my miseries will permitt. Surena (said Sillaces) had no sooner ended this parte of his discourse, than perceiveing how strange an influence it had over Parthenissa, he thus continu'd, Alas (Madam) all the hopes I had in my misfortunes, I apprehende are groundlesse, for I expected by discloseing my fault, to obtaine a pardon for it; but I finde by your disorder, that you are more inclin'd to justice, than to mercy. I confesse (said Parthenissa) you have by your relation, made your selfe very vnworthy the latter, for by your owne acknowledgement you are no longer wicked, but because you can live no longer, and 'tis not your repentance, but your Death, which makes this discovery. 'Tis true Madam (Surena answer'd) and thereby learne the power of your Beauty, which violently forces me to actions against my inclinations, and against Iustice. But Madam I have greater hopes of your forgivenesse by submitting, than disputeing, and the more to induce you to it, consider, that if I am the only actor in this fault, 'tis because I only had the meanes to act it; that none would have declin'd my Cryme, if he had had my hopes; that it lay in my power to continue, aswell as to create your troubles, (for I vnderstand Artabbanes is too-perfectly deluded ever to returne of himselfe, and discover the contrary) consider too Madam, that I have given you an ill opinion of me, to restore you to a good one of my Ryvall, that you will render my death as full of torment without your pardon, as of quietnesse with it, and excuse my fault upon the score that the purest flame was the Creator of it, and that as it was my first, so 'tis impossible but it must be my last. All the while Surena was thus speakeing, his sighs accompany'd his words, and had so efficatious a power over the generous Parthenissa, that shee told him; Yes Surena you have my forgiuenesse, and I beseech the Gods, that it may render your Death as full of satisfaction, as that Crime which made you neede it, will (I feare) fill my life with misery. At the ende of these words shee went out of his Chamber, and comeing where Zephalinda, and I were, shee told hir (passing by) ah Madam, your Brother has forever ruin'd me. That virtuous Princesse was asmuch surpri'd at this declaration, as Parthenissa had bin when shee learn't the cause of it: But Zephalinda perceiueing your faire Misteris was too-much possest with greife, to desire an explanation of what shee had said, contented hir selfe to suspende hir curiosity 'till a fitter season, and having waited on hir to hir Charriott, return'd to Surena, who shee knew by the emotions of such a visit, would remaine in too sadd a disorder to abandon him; but as soone as Parthenissa was got home, shee learnt Zianthe had absented hir selfe, which so confirm'd Surena's relation, that Parthenissa immediatly fell into a violent feaver and the distempers of hir minde so well conspir'd with the malignity of the disease, that for seaven dayes together, all the Phisitiants were in despaire of hir recovery, but in the middle of hir highest raveings shee would often excuse, and condeme you, and in such passionat tearmes, that in hir frenzie I almost learn't the subject of it; but at last, the Gods who shew'd us our feares, to indeere our Ioyes, heard our feares, and by a happy Crysis asswadg'd, and at last tooke away hir paine, & danger, I say our Teares, for Lyndadory, Zephalinda, & I, had hardly any other employment dureing hir sicknesse, and that generous Princesse was so much more concearn'd in Parthenissa, than in hir Brother, that as often as possibly shee could, shee left Surena, to waite on hir Ryvall. Whilst we were thus paying our duty, and care, to your sadd Mistris, Arsaces was not lesse vigilant, and concearn'd, about his Favourite, who it seemes (was by those powers which were concearn'd in your Loves) reduced, into a danger of Death, only to extore a discovery from him, which nothing else could have had the power to doe, for no sooner was his Treachery disclos'd, than an Arabian Phisitian (who certainely has farther peirc't into the secrets of Nature than any which ever have bin of his profession) vnderstanding Orodes greife, and the Subject of it; came boldly to him, as he was returneing from the Temple, where he had bin Sacrificeing for Surena's health, & told him that he would vndertake to ende his feares, by recovering his Favourite, if for his Cure, the King would build a Colledge for Phisitiants, and endowe it with a competent Revenue for their maintenance; Arsaces who easily sawe, that to graunt the Arabian his desire, was but to oblige his people in obligeing himselfe, greedily yeelded to his request, and promis'd him Rewards, which though they were immense, yet were but short of his merit; For by an admirable Art, only dipping some Linnen in Surena's blood, and by covering it with a powder which he tearm'd the Sympathetick, in eight dayes to our wonder, & Orodes joy, brought your Ryvall out of all feare of Death; but the Parthian Phisitians, who envy'd what they could not immitate, gave out, that his cure was not the effect of Knowledge but of Magick: But the skillfull Arabian to make their Malice, as apparent as their ignorance, promis'd to publish a Treatise which should evince, that for his receipt he was only beholding to Art. His Enemyes therefore who immagin'd, that he which could performe a cure, could tell the meanes how it was wrought, one Night privetly Murther'd him in his Bedd, and to that excellent remedy is (I feare) forever lost, and only appear'd, to make us thinck it a misfortune. But assoone as Parthenissa was in any condition fitt to be spoaken to, Lindadory, Zephalinda, and I begg'd hir with such incessant importunities, to discover to us, what Surena had to hir, that at length shee graunted our request. Alas! what disorders were we in at that relation? they were indeede so great, that for a tyme Parthenissa attributed what was meerly our astonishment, to a tacite codemning of you, but Zephalinda's resentments against Surena, gave hir soonest the power, not only to condemne hir Brother, but to drawe Parthenessa out of that error, our silence had lead hir into, by telling hir; But Madam, since the Gods so mercifuly have discover'd your and Artabbanes delusion, why doe you so; long let him continue in Torments, whose greatnesse you may know by your owne sufferings, and which are too high a punishment, were his Crime asmuch his designe, as 'tis his misfortune. Madam (said Parthenissa) who condemn'd you, but to learne more Arguments for your pardon) it seemes then by your discourse, that Artabbanes is not faulty, which I must informe you, is a farre different opinion from mine; for was it a sufficient inducement to thinke me vnconstant, because his Ryvall said I was so? if he thought me guilty, why did he not accuse me? and if not, why did he condemne me? is an accusation then a sufficient convincement? No, no, (Madam) when I consider the slight foundations his suspitions have, I must beleive he has resigned his Liberty to some new Conqueror, and that which he ascribed to my in constancy, is but an effect of his owne. Ah (replyl'd Zephalinda interrupting hir) how vnjust are you now to Artabbanes, aswell as to your selfe, had he any such criminall designe, he would not have expos'd his Life to Surena's Sword, that was too dangerously counterfeicting; No Madam, he was deluded so artificially, that he merits rather your pitty than your resentments; for t'was not only Surena said you were inconstant, but Zianthe (your Confident too) whose flight has confirm'd hir guilt; besides your weareing my Brothers Picture, and transcendently cherrishing the Glasse which contain'd it, above all things of that quality, your absenting your selfe from his Company, when it might have bin the last tyme of your enjoying it, and when all Ninive knew of his departure, your makeing his Ryvalls house your lodgeing, and his next dayes accepting a Challenge to justify your election (as he alleadg'd) were such strong temptations, that I should rather have admir'd if they had not suceeded, than that they did; whilst I thought him faulty, I was the first to condemne him, but now I finde him only vnhappy, I am become his Intercessor, and if I prove not a successefull one, I will publish to all the world, that 'twas not the Gods cruelty, but Parthenissa's that ruin'd Artabbanes. Madam (said Parthenissa) your Freindship makes you partiall, and you could not but condemne what you excuse, did you reflect upon it with an vnprejudicate opinion, for he that could thinke me vncapable of Constancy, I must make him so of my Affection, and since his beleiveing me guilty of change is his fault, I am resolu'd it shalbe his punishment. If (reply'd the perfect Zephalinda) you are determin'd to be rigorous, let him rather know his error, than conceale it; for whilst he thinkes you faulty, he may finde his cure in that beleife, but to learne the contrary, will prove a torment almost great enough (if 'twere plac't on Surena) to punnish his Treachery, Madam (said Lindadory, who all this while was drown'd in Teares by a reflection on your sadd condition) will you make my Brother miserable, because others have made him vnfortunate? will you make him beare the punishment of Surena's fault? and will you not graunt him your forgivenesse, because his Ryvall has reduc't him to a condition to neede, and deserue it? Would to the Gods (Parthenissa answer'd) I could finde asmuch reason, as I have inclination to pardon him; but Madam, the cause of his fault is of so misterious a quallity to me, that perhapps in forgiveing this crime, I may discover him guilty of a greater, and what I intend as a Charity, may prove an offence. Madam (said I) you ought then the sooner to cleere your doubts; neither will we become his Solicitors, if he obey not your first summons, and if at your Feete he doe not acknowledge the infelicity of his credulity, and the continuation of his passion; consider faire Parthenissa I conjure you, that a longer delay may so confirme him in his error, that his despaire may render your mercy fruitlesse, by driveing him into some fatall resolutions against his Life, or at least make him elect an eternall exile, and I beseech the Gods that alreaddy he has not chosen one of those misfortunes. But why (continu'd Sillaces) doe I make the way to your felicity so long, that I render it a new misfortune, let it suffice, that at last Parthenissa seem'd to give that to our Reasons, which proceeded from hir inclination; Yes Artabbanes, that generous Princesse pardon'd your vnfortunate Crime, assur'd us that shee would divide the joy of your Returne, and that hir heart should be as open to receive you, as ever. With this favourable declaration, I despatcht severall Expresses to seeke you, & to informe you of it, & in the meane tyme employ'd all my Freinds, and my owne power with Arsaces to recall his vowes; but alas our incessant Prayers were so farre from altering, that they confirm'd his cruelty; and though I know not from what misterious cause his aversion for you proceeded, yet I remember for his finall answer he told us; The Parthians shalbe convinc't how sacred an observer I am of my Lawes, by makeing them as penall to the first Prince of my Blood, as to the meanest of my Subjects; that though Surena be recover'd, it was no lessening of Artabbanes offence; that I owe the preservation of my Favourite, not to his respect, but to the goodnesse of the Gods, to whome I should make an vnworthy retribution, if my first action was, a violation of my oathes; And concluded, that whosoever mention'd your returne againe he would consider it as an affront to his Authority, & resent it at that rate. With this barbarous answer I went to the three Princesses, where I found two of my Expresses return'd, who assur'd us that they had bin at Babilon, Selutia, Hecatomphile, Arbelles, & all the other cheife Cittyes of Orodes Empire, and made such diligent search for you that they durst enguadge their Lives, had you bin in any of them, their paines had not bin fruitlesse; the others also at their comeing back, made us the like assurances, so that all their testimonies concurring, is fill'd Lindadory, Parthenissa, and Zephalinda with such excessive sorrowes, that perceiveing nothing but your returne, could put a period to them, I vndertooke to give them an accompt of you, or never againe to give them any of my selfe. This motion extreamly surpriz'd them, who perhapps thought, that an improbable way of findeing one Freind, would turne to a certaine one of loseing another; but I so represented, that my Freindship to you, and my eagernesse of silenceing all their Teares, would inspire me with a higher diligence than any other, that I obtain'd my request; and indeed I found Captivity a lesser trouble, than the seeing every day so deepe a Melancholly as that which possest your Sister, your Mistris, and your Freind. Immediatly therefore I fitted my selfe for my journy, & though the King did me the honor to sende me a Commission for that Army, which was design'd for you, yet I wholly declin'd it, and rather elected to become a Wanderer to restore you to your felicity, than to tread the way which leads to glory, when not in order to it; within two dayes I had fitted my selfe, and haveing taken a pretence (to obtaine the Kings permission) for a private affaire, which would necessitate my absence for some tyme, I tooke leave of of those, for whose sakes, and yours, I vndertooke so vncertaine a voyage; I will not tell you how I rais'd their Faiths by nameing greater probabilities of successe, than I fancy'd, nor all the passionate expressions at our separation, but I must tell you that in hope I might be so fortunate as to succed in my inquiry, I procur'd a letter from Parthenissa to you, which haveing secretly made up in a Ribbin, that Night I left Ninive, and bethinkeing my selfe that from that Peasant, which you sent with your Packett to me I might get some light of the way you tooke, I went directly to that Village, where I found my hopes deceiv'd, but rideing a dayes journy further, by incessant inquiries after you, I learnt, that not very long before, a Gentleman, only attended only by one Servant, had hir'd a Guide to passe over those sandy Deserts, which are betweene that place, and Antioch, and by the description they made of the person, and his saddnesse, I immagin'd it was you; I therefore instantly hir'd the same Guide, who brought me to tho same Inn you lay at in Antioch, where tho Master of it assur'd me, that Gentleman had embarqued himselfe in a small vessell that was bound for Cyprus, this gave me a beleife, that since an infelicity in Love was the cause of your Banishment, you intended to confine your selfe in that Iland, where the Queene of that Passion, had chosen hir earthly residence. With this hopefull fancy, I hir'd a Shipp, and in two dayes landed at Paphos, & from thence exactly visited every corner of that Kingdome, yet all the advantage I deriv'd from a hundred dayes spent in so curious a search, was, to remaine confident you were not in it; but because I was inform'd, that severall disconted persons, retir'd themselves into certaine small Ilands of the Archipelago, I resolu'd to trye whether you did not increase their Number, but we had not bin vnder the Saile aboue twelve howres, when a Colician Pyrate gave us chase, & though with my Sword I disputed my liberty, yet at last being opprest by number, I lost both, and receiv'd so many wounds, that had not our Enemyes Captaine, by a good opinion conceiu'd of my Courage, bin exceeding carefull of my cure, I had mist the happinesse of restoreing you to yours; about halfe a yeare I continu'd with this Cilician, where I had nothing of a Slave, but the Name, & whose affection I gain'd so entirely, that he often protested, 'twas that only which hinder'd my liberty, but out of apprehension that I might not have the same inclinations for him, which he had for me, he would everyday endeavour to weane himselfe from my Company, & assoone as he could digest our separation, he would then give me my liberty, to obtaine a pardone for haveing so long delay'd it; his former Charity, and those fresh demonstrations of his Freindship, were so justly predominant over me, that when the valliant Gallippus, & Menas, with three Gallyes more fell upon ours, I joyn'd myselfe to the generous Cilician, & though after a virtuous resistance he lost his Life, yet in that action I sav'd it three tymes, and loaden with wounds, fell by his Side; Gallippus and Menas haveing inquir'd after their victory who I was, were inform'd by some which surviv'd our defeate, that I was a Slave, and only in gratitude to him, whose courage tooke, and whose charity preserv'd me, I perform'd what they sawe. I know not whether my resolution, or gratitude, gave them an opinion, that it was not vnlikely, the same vsage might produce the same resentments, but whatsoever was the cause, Gallippus tooke up my Body, carry'd it into his Cabbin, and there so prest the Chyrurgions to shew their Art, that as a proofe of it, by powerfull cordialls, they brought me to my selfe againe, and haveing found my faintnesse proceeded rather from the losse of blood, than any mortall wound, they then gave Gallippus an assurance of recovering me, and afterwards perform'd it. I cannot but tell you, that had not higher reflections than any which related to my selfe, silenc't my dispaire, I had made my owne Sword testify, that I prefer'd Death, before Slavery; but the consideration of my enguadgements to your faire Sister, Parthenissa, and Zephalinda, and the eternall torment the not knowing your error would be to you, made me looke as a providence upon my double Captivity, and as it were my double resurrection; besides, I could not fancy the Gods, who are the Releivers of Innocency, did so miraculously preserve me, but to render me at last their instrument in it; and since the Sea was the place where I lost any further intelligence of you, the being with Pyrates, who examine all shipps they see, gave me no small hopes, that those accidents, which in appearance were misfortunes, might prove the best way of puting a period to yours, and Mine; to conclude, the Gods made not my conjectures false, for 'tis by my Captivity that they have brought my troubles to an ende; but before I have done so to my discourse, I must let you know, that in some fights, I did Gallippus such memorable services (for 'twas with him I allwayes went) that he endeavour'd to obtaine my freedome from Menas, which the barbarous Pyrate allwayes declin'd, but the valiant Gallipus to make my hopes ease my sufferings, protested that the next service I render'd him, which might make his Admirall not justly to condemne his setting me free, he would rather hazard to lose the expectation of his future preferrment, than not doe it; 'twas a long while before I could light on so favourable an opportunity, which at last was given me this day in your sight; But my being a Slave, having bin the meanes of inceraseing your Glory, I shall no more deplore it, than I doe my other miseries, since they are so fortunatly finisht, and since by them I have given some proofes of a Freindshipp, whose greatnesse cannot be resembling to any thing so aptly, as to his perfections to whome it is pay'd. 'Twas thus the generous Sillaces ended his Relation, & 'twas in passionat embraceings, and not in words that Spartacus was eloquent in his gratitude; but his Freind perceiveing that his Silence exprest his impatience for Parthenissa's Letter, immediatly by vnsoweing a little Ribbon, which in all his misfortunes he had artificially preserv'd, presented my deare Master with those faire Caracters, which, haveing kist a thousand tymes, he found that they conteyn'd these words. recall you from your banishment, should be a confirmation of it, and perhapps your Crime (if my affection were not your advocate) might deserue that punishment; for in esteeming me Inconstant, you haue asmuch wrong'd my Iudgement, as my Virtue, but since your fault affoards you an euincement, that my Affection by my yet continuing it is vncapable of alteration, I pardon an error, which on that score I can hardly condemne, and all the reparation I desire, is, that you will neuer thinke me so neere being guilty, as to haue bin thought so by you; that you will make a greife cease, which nothing but your presence has the power to doe; and that you will be confident, 'tis as impossible for me to alter my Passion, as to improue my first election by a second choyce. O Gods! (Spartacus cry'd out when he had ended readeing) why did you give me the courage to love Parthenissa, the happinesse to obtaine hirs, and not virtue enough to know shee was vncapable of vice; Then abstaineing a while from words, he made those sighs which interrupted them, performe their office; but haveing at length allay'd that storme, he thus continu'd; Great Gods! what Cryme have I committed, that you make a declaration of Parthenissa's Passion for me, my punishment? and yet you are therein but just, for since the suspecting of it was my Sinne, it is fitt it should be too my Torment. My Relation would be endlesse did I tell you all those rationall extravagancyes he vtter'd, I will therefore passe them over, with all those menaces he made against Surena's Life, and only informe you, that never any Mans condemnation brought him a more reall greife, than did Artabbanes pardon to him, & that his despaire for haveing injur'd the perfect'st excellency, flung him into a violent Feaver, which was not only like to have cost him his Life, but was really the cause of those disasters, which afterwards did happen. For Canitius (who my Prince had honur'd with the office of his Leiutenant Generall) at the takeing of Salapia, sawe the faire Izadora, & had for hir so violent a Passion, that it gave him the impudence to begg hir of my generous Master, as a Reward of his Services; But Spartacus not only refus'd it, but gave him so just a Reprehension for it, that insteed of produceing repentance, it inspir'd him with Revenge; to effect which (as we afterwards learn't) he held a private Correspondency with Gellius, & Letulus, at that famous Bartell in which they were defeated, & 'twas by his Treachery, & the quitting of his Post, that all those valiant Garmans were then cut off; and for which, he attributing of it to their rashnesse, and my Prince not to his Infidelity, he had his pardon; which generosity was so farre from produceing his conversion, that it gave him encouragement to abuse a virtue, which, if he had had any himselfe, he should rather have admir'd. This Traytor therefor takeing the advantage of his Generalls sicknesse, which gave him an vnrestrain'd liberty to accomplish his infidelity, began by his Agents, to let the Army know that Spartacus, who built his Glory upon their blood, car'd not how profuse he was of so pretious a treasure, whilst that by it he could purchase his desires; that they had no reason any longer to follow a Captaine, who declin'd so much as acquainting them with his Name, and Country; that to the best of his observation, they must not expect a period of their troubles but by a period of their lives, for haveing lead them crosse all Italy, with an enguadgement of disbanding them, when they had reach't the Alpes, yet, when all their dangers were past (but that of not observeing his promise) upon the bare noyse of Crassus Army, he leads them from their security, to make them vndertake a hazardous Warre; that when by the only blessing of the Gods, by the defeate of Mummius, they had created such feares in Crassus, that they might with asmuch safety, as honor, have retir'd themselves to enjoy their valours recompence, he declines Gallipus overture, of sendeing them a Fleete, which would have convey'd them into a Country, where at once they might receive their security, and their rewards; that for the only hopes of a little glory, which their Swords and lives too must purchase for him, he is resolu'd not only to expose them to all the Force of Italy, but to attend Pompeys tryumphant Army, who are so accustom'd to victory, that they desire no greater certainty of it, than to come to a Battell; in which the best Name our victory can beare, willbe that of a happy rashnesse; neither can they have any hopes of his favour, had they no other experiment of the cotrary, than that of Salapia, where least Perolla should be too-weake to shedd their blood, he sends him those Prisoners to destroy their valours, which had bin made so, by their valours, & that late one of Gallippus Slave, who though he gave no other proofe of his Courage, than the defence of himselfe, and the killing of some of them, yet immediatly, as if the shedding their companions blood, had bin the best Title to a recompence, his liberty is purchas't, and by Treasures farre greater than any which has bin, their reward for two yeares Misery and Successe; and not content with this injury, but because they vented their just resentments upon a violater of his Faith, from their Generall he becomes their Executioner, and lest they might judge that violence proceeded from the heate of blood, he causes afterwards five of them to be publiquely hang'd, and offers their Enemy to become their Iudge, who findeing Spartacus to be more cruell, than he himselfe could be (though a Pyrate) declin'd the motion upon that score only. It was with many such infusions that the Traytor Canitius, and his Instruments, endeavour'd my Princes ruine, & though he were the only Author of this wickednesse, yet he appear'd the cheife detester of it; Neither was he content to be false within our Campe, but carry'd his perfidiousnesse to that of the Romans, and by a private contract with Crassus (which my Princes indisposition permitted him to mannage with security) not only became his Freind, but his Intelligencer; & advis'd him dureing his Generalls sicknesse to advance, and by a strong Trench to shutt up the Neck of that Peninsule we then quarter'd in where if Spartacus ended his Life by his present disease, the Command of the Army by succession being his, he would betray it into his hands; or if he recover'd, he would raise so dangerous a Mutiny in the Army (for the which, their being thus beseidg'd would give a sufficient rise) that in so great a disorder, he might make his advantage. He further protested he would then have perform'd that, for which he was futurely inguadg'd, but that as yet those seeds of disorder, had not taken roote deepe enough to produce the fruite he expected, but yet as an earnest of the reallity of his professions he would not oppose Crassus's makeing that Trench which was to beseidge us; who upon this perfidiousnesse rais'd his hopes, & his Campe, which he remou'd to the Neck of our Peninsule where contrary to the advice, & above the hope of all his Officers, he in a short while cast up a Trench from Sea to Sea, of three hunder'd Furlongs in length, fifteene Foote broad, as many high, and on the topp of it rais'd a Wall of an admirable strength whilst this was performeing, our Army often repin'd at Canitius not opposeing it, who to make his sitting still, appeare rather his respect, than his Treachery, protested he would adventure nothing 'till Spartacus was recover'd, lest fighting vnder his Fortune, the successe might be attributed to his owne Courage; besides, he often laught at so endlesse a toyle (as he tearm'd Crassus Trench) & said 'twas a worke fitter for Labourers, than Souldiers; but yet if the Romans effected it, they would but become the makers of their owne Graves, for they must be thereby so overharras'd, that it would be impossible for them to use a Pike or a Sword: I must confesse I was of his opinion, and had I not bin so, I esteem'd it lesse hazardous to be besieidg'd by Crassus, than to fight a Battell vnder Canitius. Neither was it singly Canitius Treachery, which gave the Roman Generall this confidence, but Pompey's vnexpected returne had a share in it, for though Crassus had conjur'd the Senate to send for him out of Asia, yet he had done it to palliate any disgrace which might have befallen him, to manifest the greatnesse of the danger, & the better to sett off the glory of a victory, than out of a beleife that Pompey could so soone and so successefully disinguadge himselfe from the Mithridatick Warre; but when to his greife, & admiration he receiu'd advice from Rome, that not only Pompey was at Dyrrhachium, and expected but a faire winde to transport him into Italy, but that all the Senate consider'd him as the Man destin'd for that worke, and had made him Generall of that Warre, takeing the very rise from Crassus his owne letters, spight, and ambition made him vndertake what his Iudgement, nor his Courage, could have invited him to. In the meane while my generous Prince lay strugling with greater difficulties than all the Roman Empire could have rais'd him, I meane his despaire for haveing suspected the perfectest Innocency; which cruell thoughts, made him looke with some sort of joy, upon that Sicknesse we consider'd with horror; but in the end the Gods (who had no yet wearyed themselves in persecuting him) abated, and afterwards tooke away the danger of his Feaver; but then his Melancholly augmented, as his disease decreast, and had so powerfull an influence over him, that it appear'd as dangerous an Enemy, as that which was so lately supprest; to be breife, Sillaces tooke so opportunely his good intervalls, and so effectually employ'd them, that Spartacus began to listen unto Reason, and one Euening findeing him much inclin'd to relish his perswasions, he told him. Are you then Artabbanes resolu'd eternally to render fruitlesse that miraculous discovery the Gods have made in your favour? will you by your wilfullnesse, necessitate Parthenissa to beleive, that what was your misfortune, was your designe? will you render what you would make the testimony of your Repentance, a greater offence than your fault? and will you make your Love, more disobligeing than your hatred? for whilst you thought your presence was Parthenissa's trouble, you banisht your selfe from hir, and now shee tells you 'twill prove hir only consolation, you deny it hir: No, no, (Artabanes) if you thinke you have not really hir pardon a new disobedience is not the way to obtaine it; & if you beleive you have, why doe you deny your selfe the benefitt of it? 'Twas with many perswasions of this Nature, that Artabbanes despaire was assaulted, which at last were so prevalent, that after a deepe sigh, he told Sillaces, You have vanquisht me (generous Freind) yes: I will goe to Parthenissa, for since 'tis shee I have offended, 'tis vnfitt any other but that injur'd Innocence should pronounce my sentence; neither can shee doubt how sensible I am of my Cryme, since I make hir both the Party, and the Iudge, and offer my Life unto Arsaces fury, only to present it to hir Iustice. You will finde (said Sillaces) with extacyes of joy, & a thousand embraces, how litle cause you have to be apprehensive of either, for as Parthenissa's goodnesse has pardon'd your offence, so if Orodes justice doe's not immitate hir example, let it be my care to preserve your being in Parthea from his knowledge. My generous Master being brought to this good temper, we thought it high tyme to informe him that the Romans had in a manner beseidg'd us, and that the vastnesse of our Army had so exhausted the Iland of all Provisions, that our necessities, if not our Courages must invite us to force our passage. Spartacus heard this advertisement (which 'till then we had declin'd giveing him, by reason of his sicknesse, & melancholly) with a singuler satisfaction, & about some fower or fiive dayes after, haveing recover'd sufficient strength to make use of a Horse, he came out of his Tent, which the Souldiers celebrated with so lowde a shoute, that the Romans apprehended their beseidg'd were comeing to be their Assaulters; neither doe I beleive their feares had bin any thing lessen'd, had they knowne the true cause of that Allarme, for I dare justly affirme, they more apprehended my Princes recovery, than a Battell: But Artabbanes haveing taken 10000 Men for his Guard, went to veiw that miraculous Trench; which he more admir'd than fear'd; but least his Officers might misinterpret his silence, he told them; That Crassus (doubtlesse) had more Pioners than Souldiers in his Army: that since he never declin'd a Battell, he rather thought the Romas secur'd themselves, than beseidg'd him; that 'twas impossible any people could take that paines but for their owne preservation; yet lest the world might beleive the contrary, he would in fewe dayes evince the truth by a demonstration, & was more pleas'd to know where he might fight with Crassus, than troubl'd at those difficulties he must surmount to doe it. And indeede not long after, when he had perfectly recover'd his strength, and when all his Army despair'd of disinguadgeing themselves from so ruinous a labrynth, in a hideous stormy Night, when the Earth was cover'd with snowe, he gave orders to all his Forces to be ready to Martch, & whilst he was putting on his Armour, he told Sillaces; Come Generous Freind, let us make Crassus defeate the way to assault Rome, and haveing taken it, let us retire into Parthia where I will manifest, that I preferre not the greatest Empire of the World, before lying prostrate at Parthenissa's Feete, nay, that I relinquisht it, for so glorious, & advantagious an exchange, Yes Sillaces I will in few dayes so cover my selfe with Paliues & Lawrells, that my crimminall jealousie shall not be seene & doe such virtuous actions, that hir justice shall pardon my offence; or my blood shall expiate it. These words were scarce spoaken, when he put himselfe at the head of the Army, & without the least stopp, ledd on those Troopes, who vnder such a Generall could not be but victorious; in effect Sillaces & he, were the first in person which pull'd downe the Roman Eagles planted more fortunat Ensignes in their places, & without giveing their successe any leave to coole, with their Swords perform'd so great an Execution, and so strew'd the wayes with Roman Carkeises, that the effects of their valour almost hinder'd the progresse of it, & had they not had a nobler designe, they might have beseidg'd the liveing Romans with the Dead, & made as famous a Trench by their victory, as Crassus had done by his Labour; but the vnequall'd Freinds so much vndervalu'd a Conquest where nothing was considerable in it but the Number of the Dead, & so abhorr'd all things which retarded their returne into Parthia, that leaving Crassus to deplore, & admire his defeate, they tooke the direct way to Rome, which was to be the Crowne, and limmitt of their Conquests; but alas that fatall poyson which the Traytor Canitius had given our Souldiers, began now to shew how strangely it had diffus'd it selfe; and though Granicus (a considerable Officer of our Army) were not of his conspiracy, yet immagining that Crassus losse had made him vncapable to revenge it, & findeing the Souldiers prepar'd for any Muteny, he so well husbanded their disorder, that the second Night, as we were in our Martch towards Rome, he revolted with 13000 Men from our Army, and campt with them neere the Lake of Lucania, with intention to sett up for himselfe, Spartacus was extreamly entag'd at this, and none appear'd more violent to punish it than the false Canitius, who inwardly rejoyc't at so vnexpected an advantage, and immediatly advertis'd Crassus of it, lest he might lose that favourable oportunity; but though my Prince was sensible of so great a dismembring of his Forces, yet the beleife he had, that in them all the Traytors of the Army were out of it, he consol'd himselfe, knowing that they were lesse dangerous in a distinct body, than vnder his Colours, and to satisfy those that prest him to be reveng'd, he told them; That he knew no way more probable for their punishment than their haveing put themselves out of his Protection, and that he doubted not, but in their very offence they would receive the reward of it. Therefore beleiveing himselfe for all that losse strong enough to carry Rome by storme, he determin'd the next morning to continue his martch, almost asmuch troubl'd that Granicus had hinder'd it a day, as at his Revolt; But the first Squadrons were hardly drawne out of the Campe, when advertisement was brought; That Crassus, (who now faught for revenge & the preservatio of Rome) was fallen upon Graicus with so much fury that 'twas impossible but in it he must finde his ruine. This Allarme so mou'd the gallant Spartacus generosity, that though Canitius, (and Crassus, who by that tyme was corrupted too) begg'd my Prince to permitt the Romans to become his Executioners, yet considering the danger, & not the Cause of it, and remembring Granicus Courage, and not his Revolt, he lead his Ensignes back to the releife of those, who had so often bin victorious vnder them; and though his only appeareing made Crassus returne to his Campe in a hasty martch, yet it produc't no other considerable effect; For Granicus, & all his Souldiers were kill'd before Spartacus arrivall, not one receiveing a wound in his back, or dyeing out of his Rancke, preserveing that order with their Bodyes, which they could not with their Lives, their Deaths manifesting whose Souldiers they were, and their defeate what Generall they had abandon'd; and indeed my Prince was so taken with their resolution, that he spent two dayes in giveing them a military funerall, burying their Crimes in their Graves. This sadd solemnity perform'd we continu'd our designe; But as if my Princes virtue had not opposition enough from publique and private Enemyes; the Heavens themselves conspir'd against him, and by continuall raines so swell'd the Ryvers, that the Romans having broaken downe all the Bridges, it was impossible for him to proceede. I leave you to thinke what his resentments were at so froward a destiny, for it not only retarded the Conquest of Rome, and, (which was more intollerable) his returne to Parthia, but also gave Crassus Recruits leasure to joyne with him, and the danger of the Empire made them so considerable that before the waters were return'd into their usuall channells, he came, and with much confidence pitcht his Tents within some 16 Furlongs of ours, where the vicinity of our Campes furnisht frequent occasions of fighting, which was our constant divertisement, in expectation of more favourable weather; but one day Spartacus haveing advice that Scroffa and Quintus, two of Crassus bravest Captaines, were gone with all the Roman Cavalrye for Forrage, he sent the generous Sillaces with all his to intercept their returne, where after a bloody dispute, our forces by the valour of their Leader had the better, who with his owne hand haveing given Scroffa very dangerous markes of his Courage, return'd into the Campe loaden with victory & wounds. My Prince receiv'd him in Tryumphs, but was more afflicted for the latter, than pleas'd at the former, esteemeing the losse of so much pretious blood too-prodigall a payment, not only for haveing vanquisht those Romans, but though it had done the like, unto their Empire. But the Chirurgions soone mittigated his feares, by an assureance that Sillaces was in no danger, and that the greatest trouble he was like to suffer, was the keeping of his Bedd for some Tenn or Twelve dayes; Five of which were not expir'd, e're the Floods were so asswadg'd, that Spartacus might have continu'd his martch towards Rome, had not his Freinds weaknesse hinder'd it. Crassus imputed this delay to his feare, and having a while before received advice from Canitius, that now all things were in such a perfect readinesse, that if the Romans could bring Spartacus to a Battell, he would bring them to a victory, he determin'd as a provocation to my Prince (which was a needelesse labour) to cast up two great Trenches, the one to hinder our passage towards Rome the other to hinder our Campe from watering. To interrupt this designe, Spartacus made many vigorous attempts, and thereby necessitated the Romans by fighting, to obtaine leave to worke; but the Eight day after Sillaces victory, the morning was spent in so sharpe a dispute betwixt us, and the Romans, and Seconds on either side came so thick, & numerous, that my Prince perceiveing he might enguadge Crassus, gallopt back into the Campe, and commanded all his Army immediatly to prepare themselves for a Battell, which whiles they were doeing he came in to Sillaces, where he acquainted him that before Night, he would be in a conditio immediatly to returne into Parthia, or never to see it againe; that nothing appear'd a higher misfortune than to be depriv'd of his Company, and helpe, in so glorious an occasion, but since he had so lately engross'd a memorable victory to himselfe, he was hopefull he would not repine, if he also lay'd hold on so favourable and so often ambition'd an occasion to immitate his example. Sillaces was extreamly surpriz'd at this declaration, and haveing sufficiently curst those former markes of honor, which now hinder'd him from increaseing his Stock, he begg'd Artabbanes he might waite on him, though in a litter, that since he could not be a sharer in, he might at least be a spectator-and admirer of his Glory; and thereupon forceing himselfe to rise, he found how ill a correspondency his Minde, and strength had together: This sadd experiment, and my Princes prayers, made him yeeld to his weaknesse, & his Freind, who haveing selected 7000 choyce men, more for the Guard of Sillaces than his Campe, he gave me the Command of them, & though I begg'd with vehement importunities, to be neere his person in so famous an occasion, yet the consideration of some slight hurts I had receiv'd in Scroffa's defeate, and the necessity of a faithfull attendant on Sillaces made him deny me. The two generous Freinds haveing tooke leave of one another, with words which nothing but so perfect a Freindshipp was capable to produce, & my Prince haveing done me the honor to embrace me, he immediatly lead his Troopes (which consisted (not counting those left with me) of 55000 effective Men to that feild in which he was confident they would purchase so much Glory; where he already found the Roman Army in Battalia, and with asmuch resolution in their countinance, & posture, as if they had bin victorious as often, as defeated; His Army too being put in order, by an Oration, he animated his Souldiers, & then gave order to the Trumpetts, Clarions, and all the warlike Musick to doe the like by sounding the Charge; and that his Souldiers might see his resolution, in all their sight he kill'd that Horse which he constantly made use of in a Battell, saying, that if he were Conqueror, he should want none and if defeated he would make use of none. My Princes Army was divided into two great Battallions, the greatest was lead by Canitius, and Castus, which consisted of 30000 Horse and Foote, the other which made up 25000 more, had my Prince in the head of them, who that morning was assur'd by those two traytors, that they would act miracles, which indeede they perform'd, in betraying the greatest virtue that ever shin'd upon Earth. The ground over which my generous Masters Battallion was to move, proved so vneven, that the other went first to the charge, & those which lead it, march'd with much order, and seemeing resolution, 'till they came within short of their Enemyes, but then Canitius and Crassus (with each of them) aboute forty of their cheifest Officers) turning the points of thit Iauelins to the graound, abandon'd their Souldiers, and rann full speed to the Romans, who opening their divisions receiv'd them with shoutes of Tryumph. This treachery you may well immagin, brought a world of confusion in those vn-officer'd Troopes, & in the height of it, the two Traytors accompany'd with their Adherents, & some Romans, return'd and Canitius in Crassus name offer'd all those their Lives, who would lay downe their Armes; To which a gallant Thracian (that my Prince had honor'd with a considerable Command) immediatly reply'd, Traytor, 'tis a higher satisfaction to punish thy Treachery, than to live by it, and 'tis upon that score, that I decline the latter, to act the former; thereupon breakeing like Lighning through a hundred Sword, he past his through Canitius body, and by so resolute a performance, depriv'd him of his Life; but Euriles (for his virtue merits to have his name recorded) had not the consolation long to out live his, and Spartacus revenge, yet before his Death, he gave Castus (who was most earnest after it) so many wounds, that he made him Canitius Companion aswell in Death, as Infidelity, and sent him to learne in the other world, the punishment which attends the being treacherous in this. But though the beginner of this generous Actio, found his owne ende in it; yet it had so strange an influence over all those which were ignorant of Canitius designes, that in immitation of Eurises, haveing chang'd their disorder into Resolution, they oppos'd all those which were not of their opinions, so that the Numbers being almost equally divided, there began a most bloody dispute, and the Romans had that satisfaction to see those Swords which were design'd for their ruine, employ'd to ruine those which had that designe; But whilst the honest, and the Traytors, were thus enguadg'd one against another, (Crassus being inform'd that Canitius & Castus were Dead to whome only he had past his word) came, and ended both their differences, by endeing all their Lives; which was no small satisfaction to my Princes martyr'd Freinds, to see those which their Companions faught for, to become the punishers of their Treachery. But (continu'd Symander) you wonder perhapps why Spartacus all this while was idle? but your admiration may cease when I informe you, that the Fates, either not to see so vnparalelld a Treachery, or to contribute towards it, had on a sudden rai'd so thick a Mist for above a quarter of an hower, that my Prince, by the vncouthnesse of the ground, advanceing slowly with his Battalion, could not possibly see what had happen'd, & perhaps had longer continu'd in his ignorance, had not a Trooper which scap't the Enemy, come full speede, and aloude advertis'd him of those events which I have told you, but not of their cause, and immediatly after, as if that Mist had bin purposely sent to contribute to his ruine, and then to shew him the greatnesse of it, it suddenly broake up, & discover'd the cruell execution the Romans had made, & their Army in all it's glory, martching a precipitate pace to charge us. Gods what courage (but Artabbanes) had not bin startled vnder such misfortunes? but his was so farre from being thereby impair'd, that it increast, & turning to those that follow'd him, he encourag'd them, both by his words, & then by his example, for advanceing some hunder'd paces before all the rest, he call'd Crassus out, resolveing as the Romans had by accident depriv'd his Army of a Wing, so he would by his valour deprive theirs of it's head. At this Summons two of Crassus valiantest Centurions successively came out of their rankes to my Prince, & by a Fatall counterfecting, were render'd for ever vncapable of deludeing him againe; Crassus perceiveing by those Examples, what his owne Fate had bin, had his valour resembl'd theirs, declin'd what he was goeing to vndertake, and to disguise his feare, commanded his Army to cutt in peices all the Reliques of those Slaves, (for those were his words.) But why doe I dwell so long on so sadd a subject? let it suffice I tell you, That Spartacus was become so horrible by the being cover'd with his Enemyes blood; that his presence was asmuch apprehended, as his Sword; that in him was verified the Fable of Anteus, recovering strength from his very falls, that he never wonne so much Glory in all his victories, as in that defeate; & that he perform'd such prodigious exploytes, that I absolutly beleive, had he bin blest but with Twenty of his humour, and resolution, their valours had supply'd the losses of Canitius Treachery; but at length those Divisions he had left being infinitly over- number'd disheart'ned, and peirc't in severall places, were totally routed, & most of them cut in peices; Spartacus perceiu'd it, and might have avoyded so generall a Fate, but scorning to out-live a losse, which he thought would have render'd him worthy of it, and observeing a Roman who had that fatall day made himselfe admirably remarkeable, by his Courage, he seiz'd upon one of those many Horses which were without Masters, and takeing a lavelin in his hand, he rann full speed after him, & having overtaken him alone in the Grove, in the midd'st whereof was a litle Meaddow, fitt for his purpose, he cry'd out to his valiant Enemy, To me, to me brave Roman, I am Spartacus, & seeke but a gallant Sword to oute this dayes misfortune; 'Tis thee I seeke (the other briskly reply'd) & since thou hast thought me fitt to ende thy sufferings; I should be very vnwilling to have thee mistaken in thy choyce; therupon they both leapt a Ditch into that litle Meaddowe, where haveing fetcht as long a Career as the place would permitt, they fell upon each other with more fury than two opposite stormes, and their Iauelins flying into the Ayre in a Thousand shivers, they drew their Swords to supply that losse, and to ende their Combate, or their Lives; & truely they were so intent upon each others ruine, that 'tis a miracle they did not mutually act it; above a quarter of an hower the dispute was so equally ballanc'd that detesting the faithfullnesse of their Armours, they were often upon the point of moueing a truce, 'till they had taken them off, but so long to be idle appea'd, a greater difficulty than to cut them in peices in the fight; at last my Prince enrag'd that Posterity should know one single Sword ended a Life, which that day had divers tymes forced a passage through a Thousand, recollecting all the strength which his Greife, & Rage could inspire him with, struck his valiant Enemy so furious a blowe, that cleaveing his sheild in two, it did the like unto the Gorget, & made a wound upon the hight of his shoulder. He (on the other side) enrag'd at a resistance which 'till then he had never found, to be only vanquisht when all the Army he faught in was victorious, and to leave so liberall a guift vnrepay'd, stiffening himselfe upon his stirropps, & inflaeing himselfe with those thoughts by an vnresistable reverse, which though it glaunc't upon my Princes sheild, yet afterwards lighting upon his Helmett, cleft it in two, & left his head, and face vnguarded, & vncover'd which his Enemy perceiveing, and as the Gods would have it, knowing perfectly those vnequall'd features, though his Sword were in the Ayre, to prosecute the advantage my Princes perfidions Armour had given him, yet he suspended it there, and by crying out, Great Gods! is it not Artabbanes that I see? not only hinder'd Spartacus by that example, and those words, from giveing him a blowe, whose strength had render'd it vnavoydably fatall to the Receiver, but also made him say, who ever thou art, if thou bee'st a Freind to the Romans, kill me as Spartacus, and if thou bee'st a Freind to me, kill me as Artabbans, for this dayes misery will make the graunting that request, the highest proofe thou canst give me of thy being mine. The Gods (forbid the Stranger reply'd vnlaceing his Helmet) that ever my Sword should be employ'd in so cryminall an action, for though my ignorance made my sacralegious Arme offend, 'tis not the Gods themselves that can command my knowledge of you to repeate my Sinne; Therupon flinging off his Hellmet, he discover'd a Face, which Spartacus no sooner sawe, than they both rann with asmuch willingnesse to embrace, as they before did to destroy one another, and for a while my Prince in the joy of such an encounter, had lay'd aside the thoughts of those miseries which had caus'd it; but alas they were too-deepe, and too-recent to be forgotten, and the sadd remembrance of them made him on a sudden crye out, oh Gods! why doe you give me so new a subject to desire Life, when you had so lately given me many to detest it? and why (if you designe my ruine) doe you make Him know, and favour me, that was only capable to act it? These reasonings made him that only heard them, admire what might be their cause, and his wonder produceing his silence, made my deare Master thus to continue, No, no, Artabbanes, when thou wert a Slave to Fortune, & to the Romans, and when thou sought'st Death; & not victory, the Gods gave thee the last and deny'd thee the first; but now thou bearst the glorious title of Parthenissa's, the Gods having deny'd thee the latter, deny not thy selfe the former, shew by so generous an experiment, that he which for not obtaining the victory could act his owne Death, did not lose the one, out of an apprehension of the other; Thereupon he had certainly extinguisht the fairest Life that ever was, had not the generous Artavasdes (for 'twas he whome Spartacus had faught with, & whose strange being in the Roman Army shall be told you in it's due order) observeing my Princes despaire proceeded from his defeate, first hinder'd the fatall effects of it, and then to take-away the cause, assur'd him that he was betray'd, and not vanquisht. Spartacus at this assurance (for 'till then he was ignorant of it) look't upon his Freind with a Face which spoake his doubts, and then begg'd him to deale cleerely, and informe him, whether what he had said was not only out of a designe to hinder his violence towards himselfe? But Artavasdes haveing by many protestations, and perticulers, assur'd him of Canitius, and Castus perfidiousnesse, made Artabbanes (who sawe that 'twas not Crassus, but Treachery that had beaten him) to relinquish those sadd designes he had upon his owne Life, and to preserve it for a perfection, who only meritted so transcendent a blessing. This resolve was no sooner taken up, but the apprehension of Sillaces safety began to afflict my Prince with such excesse, that Artavasdes for a while suspected, a relapse into his former despaire produced it; but being inform'd of the occasion, he immediatly made Artabbanes to fling away his owne Armes, to take those of a Servant of his, (which by accident was rideing by) and then assureing him the power he had with Crassus was so great, that if Sillaces were not already lost, he durst vndertake his, and my preservation (for they were so generous as to give me a parte in their care) they both gallopt away towards the Campe, where they found, that Night (and not victory) had put an ende to the Romans assault, whereby it was apparent, if so vnconsiderable a person as Symander, could defend so large a line with so few hands, what then Artabbanes would have done with so vast an Army, had it bin free from Treachery. Artavasdes therefore joy'd at Crassus repulse, & having lodg'd Artabbanes in his owne Tent, caus'd an inviolable secrecy to be administer'd to his Servants, & his generous freinds wounds to be drest, which were many, and those much inflam'd by that violent agitation, that his care to preserve Sillaces had occasion'd, he went to Crassus (who with eloquent Elogies gave his valour a just Caracter) and acquainted him, that a Servant or rather a Freind of his (for his vnimmitable fidelity merited that Name) was taken Prisoner in the Enemyes Campe, dangerously wounded and had sent him word that he had obtain'd his owne liberty, if Crassus would enguadge himselfe to their Commander in cheife, to release the first Prisoner of his quality which he should take; that whether or no this was granted, he desir'd that a Chirurgion might be sent him, (all those of the Enemyes, were so busie about their owne patients, that none of them had the tyme, or the charity to dresse his wounds. Artavasdes further told the Roman Generall that the Chirurgion he meant to employ, might serve also to bring intelligence in what posture the Reliques of his Enemyes were, and added to those two, so many further motives, that Crassus willingly yeelded to both his requests. Artavasdes was no sooner return'd than he acquainted my Prince with what he had done, & after a short consultation, they immediatly imploy'd the faithfull Philanax (who my Prince mention'd in his generous Freinds adventures) as a Chirurgion to Sillaces, who passing the Roman Guard (by Crassus direction) came with a Letter of credence vnder Artabbanes hand into our Campe, and fill'd us both, by the relation I have made you, with a joy, which nothing could equall but the greatnesse of our greife before his arrivall; but the tyme pressing us, I gave all my Souldiers orders (by Philanax'es advice) to shift for themselves dureing the obscurity, for we were not able next morning with so small Numbers, to receive that storme was intended; therefore all of them that Night (by a way which the Romans thought inaccessible) descended to a litle Ryver that issues from the lake of Lucania, where some that could swimme helpeing others that could not, what by that charity, & some few Boates & Plankes which were there, & which had bin employ'd to fetch Victualls to our Campe whilest the Floods were so violent, all of them (before day) recover'd the mountaines of the Brutians, where afterwards they renew'd the Warre, and furnisht Pompey with an occasion to tell the Senate, that it was Crassus had defeated the Slaves in Battell, but 'twas he had pull'd up the Warre by the very roote. But our Souldiers were no sooner gone, than Philanax, and I, prepar'd Sillaces Litter, and haveing put him into it, wee carry'd him out of the Campe, & freely passing the Roman Guards, brought him to Artavasdes Tent, where these Three great Men manifested their joyes, and Freindship, in expressions, which if not related in their owne words, were too great a wrong vnto them; & the better to palliate the businesse, I writt a letter to Crassus (as Commander-in cheife of his Enemyes) and deliver'd it with my owne hands, as a Messenger sent expressely with it from the Campe, wherein I let him know, that upon his promise of the like Civility, I had sent the Prisoner he desir'd, and afterwards to favour the flight of that remainder of my Princes Army, I assur'd him, those in the Campe were in a readdinesse for some exployte, that 'twas not impossible but they would make a desperate Sally, to sell their Lives handsomely, and that I told him this the more freely, because I was resolv'd to abandon his Enemyes for ever, being assur'd of my Life, & liberty by the Prisoner I had brought off. Crassus for this Intellignce & at Artavasdes request (who accompany'd me to him) confirm'd what the Prisoner promis'd, and immediatly put all his Campe in Armes, in apprehenssion of a Sally, which abundantly contributed to my poore Companions escape; For all the Romans being only intent on the East side of our Campe, which was the only place for an attempt, permitted those on the West (which was the way that lead to the River) to make a more facile flight. 'Twas in this sorte (continu'd Symander) that all things happen'd in that famous Battell of the Trenches, I know some Romans gave out that Spartacus was cut in peices, others (and more truly) affirm'd, that after the Battell his boddy was never found, and some too (knowing none could contradict them, for there was no Quarter given) &, to receive a reward cut off a head, which they said was my Princes, carryed it to Rome, and fixt it on the Gate of the Capitoll. To conclude, this parte of my Story, I will not tell you all those desires Artabbanes had to returne to those Men which scapt unto the Brutian Mountaines, whose Courage & fidelity he admir'd, and with whome he was confident to repaire the misfortune of Canitius & Castus Treacheryes. 'Tis enough you learne, That had not his wounds hinder'd him a while, & their defeate afterwards he would never have return'd to Parthia without haveing redeem'd that losse, which was his misfortune not his fault. The next morning as Crassus was prepareing to repeate his assault, newes was brought him, that his Enemyes had abandon'd the Campe, at which his discontent was greater in appearance, than in effect, for we had not so ill defended our selves the precedent day, as to make any thing which avoyded a secod storme, appeare a misfortune. Three dayes Crassus spent, to repaire the disorders of his Army, & to bury the dead, least if left without Sepulture, the numbers being great, they might infect the Ayre; in which tyme my Prince acquainted the generous Artavasdes
