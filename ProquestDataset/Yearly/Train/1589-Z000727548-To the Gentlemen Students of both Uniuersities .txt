 Plutarch and Plinie ; and to conclude, their whole methode of writing, from the libertie of Comical fictions, that haue succeeded to our Rethoritians, by a second imitation: so that, well may the Adage, Nil dictum quod non dictum prius , bee the most iudiciall estimate, of our latter Writers. But the hunger of our vnsatiate humorists, beeing such as it is, readie to swallowe all draffe without indifference, that insinuates it selfe to their senses vnder the name of delight, imployes oft times manie thred bare witts, to emptie their inuention of their Apish deuices, and talke most superficiallie of Pollicie, as those that neuer ware gowne in the Vniuersitie; wherein they reuiue the olde saide Adage, Sui Mineruam ,  & cause the wiser to quippe them with Asinus ad Lyram . Would Gentlemen  & riper iudgements admit my motion of moderation in a matter of follie, I wold perswade them to phisicke their faculties of seeing & hearing, as the Sab aeans doo their dulled senses with smelling; who (as Strabo reporteth) ouer-cloyed with such odoriferous sauours, as the naturall encrease of their Countrey, (Balsamum, Amomum, with Myrrhe and Frankencense) sends foorth, refresh their nosthrills with the vnsauorie sent, of the pitchie slime, that Euphrates casts vp, and the contagious fumes of Goates beardes burnt; so woulde I haue them, beeing surfetted vnawares with the sweete sacietie of eloquence, which the lauish of our copious Language maie procure, to vse the remedie of contraries; and recreate their rebated witts, not as they did, with the senting of slyme or Goates beardes burnt, but with the ouer-seeing of that sublime dicendi genus , which walkes abroad for wast paper in each seruing mans pocket, and the otherwhile perusing of our Gothamists barbarisme; so shoulde the opposite comparison of Puritie , expell the infection of absurditie; and their ouer- rackte Rhethorique, bee the Ironicall recreation of the Reader. But so farre discrepant is the idle vsage of our vnexperienst punies from this prescription, that a tale of Ihon a Brainfords will, and the vnluckie furmentie, wilbe as soon interteined into their libraries, as the best poeme that euer Tasso eternisht: which being the effect of an vndescerning iudgement, makes drosse as valuable as gold, and losse as welcome as gaine, the Glow-worme mentioned in Æ sops fables, namelie the apes follie, to be mistaken for fire, when as God wot poore soules, they haue nought but their toyle for their heate, their paines for their sweate, and (to bring it to our english prouerbe) their labour for their trauaile. Wherin I can but resemble them to the Panther, who is so greedie of mens excrements; that if they be hangd vp in a vessell higher than his reach, he sooner killeth himselfe with the ouer-stretching of his windlesse bodie, than he wil cease from his intended enterprise. Oft haue I obserued what I now set downe; a secular wit that hath liued all daies of his life by what doo you lacke, to bee more iudiciall in matters of conceit, than our quadrant crepundios, that spit ergo in the mouth of euerie one they meete: yet those & these are so affectionate to dogged detracting, as the most poysonous Pasquil , anie durtie mouthed Martin , or Momus euer composed, is gathered vp with greedinesse before it fall to the ground, and bought at the deerest though they smell of the friplers lauander halfe a yeere after: for I know not how the minde of the meanest is fedde with this follie, that they impute singularitie, to him that slanders priuelie, and count it a great peece of arte in an inkhorne man, in anie tapsterlie tearmes whatsoeuer, to oppose his superiours to enuie. I will not denie but in scholler-like matters of controuersie, a quicker stile may passe as commendable; and that a quippe to an asse is as good as a goad to an oxe: but when an irregular idiot, that was vp to the eares in diuinitie, before euer he met with probabile in the Vniuersitie, shall leaue pro & contra before he can scarcely pronounce it, & come to correct Common weales, that neuer heard of the name of Magistrate before he came to Cambridge , it is no meruaile if euery alehouse vaunt the table of the world turned vpside down; since the childe beats his father,  & the asse whippes his master. But least I might seeme with these night crowes, Nimis curiosus in aliena republica . I'le turne backe to my first text, of studies of delight; and talke a little in friendship with a few of our triuiall translators. It is a comon practise now a daies amongst a sort of shifting companions, that runne through euery arte and thriue by none, to leaue the trade of Nouerint whereto they were borne, and busie themselues with the indeuors of Art, that could scarcelie latinize their necke-verse if they should haue neede; yet English Seneca read by candle light yeeldes manie good sentences, as Bloud is a begger , and so foorth: and if you intreate him faire in a frostie morning, he will affoord you whole Hamlets , I should say handfulls of tragical speaches. But  o griefe! tempus edax rerum , what's that will last alwaies? The sea exhaled by droppes will in continuance be drie, and Seneca let bloud line by line and page by page, at length must needes die to our stage: which makes his famisht followers to imitate the Kidde in Æ sop , who enamored with the Foxes newfangles, forsooke all hopes of life to leape into a new occupation; and these men renowncing all possibilities of credit or estimation, to intermeddle with Italian translations: wherein how poorelie they haue plodded, (as those that are neither prouencall men, nor are able to distinguish of Articles,) let all indifferent Gentlemen that haue trauailed in that tongue; discerne by their two penie pamphlets: & no meruaile though their home-born mediocritie be such in this matter; for what can be hoped of those, that thrust Elisium into hell, and haue not learned so long as they haue liued in the spheares, the iust measure of the Horizon without an hexameter. Sufficeth them to bodge vp a blanke verse with ifs and ands,  & other while for recreation after their candle stuffe, hauing starched their beardes most curiouslie, to make a peripateticall path into the inner parts of the Citie, & spend two or three howers in turning ouer French Doudie , where they attract more infection in one minute, than they can do eloquence all dayes of their life, by conuersing with anie Authors of like argument. But least in this declamatorie vaine, I should condemne all and commend none, I will propound to your learned imitation, those men of import, that haue laboured with credit in this laudable kinde of Translation; In the forefront of whom, I cannot but place that aged Father Erasmus , that inuested most of our Greeke Writers, in the roabes of the auncient Romaines ; in whose traces, Philip Melancthon, Sadolet, Plantine , and manie other reuerent Germaines insisting, haue reedified the ruines of our decayed Libraries, and merueilouslie inriched the Latine tongue with the expence of their toyle. Not long after, their emulation beeing transported into England , euerie priuate Scholler, William Turner , and who not, beganne to vaunt their smattering of Latine, in English Impressions. But amongst others in that Age, Sir Thomas Eliots elegance did seuer it selfe from all equalls, although Sir Thomas Moore with his Comicall wit, at that instant was not altogether idle: yet was not Knowledge fullie confirmed in hir Monarchie amongst vs, till that most famous and fortunate Nurse of all learning, Saint Iohns in Cambridge , that at that time was as an Vniuersitie within it selfe; shining so farre aboue all other Houses, Halls, and Hospitalls whatsoeuer, that no Colledge in the Towne, was able to compare with the tythe of her Students; hauing (as I haue hearde graue men of credite report) more candles light in it, euerie Winter Morning before fowre of the clocke, than the fowre of clocke bell gaue stroakes; till Shee (I saie) as a pittying Mother, put too her helping hande, and sent from her fruitefull wombe, sufficient Schollers, both to support her owne weale, as also to supplie all other inferiour foundations defects, and namelie that royall erection of Trinitie Colledge , which the Vniuersitie Orator, in an Epistle to the Duke of Somerset , aptlie tearmed Colona diducta , from the Suburbes of Saint Iohns . In which extraordinarie conception, vno partu in rempublicam prodiere , the Exchequer of eloquence Sir Ihon Cheeke , a man of men, supernaturally traded in al tongues, Sir Ihon Mason , Doctor Watson, Redman, Aschame, Grindall, Leuer, Pilkington: all which, haue either by their priuate readings, or publique workes, repurged the errors of Artes, expelde from their puritie, and set before our eyes, a more perfect Methode of Studie. But howe ill their preceptes haue prospered with our idle Age, that leaue the fountaines of sciences, to follow the riuers of Knowledge, their ouer-fraught Studies, with trifling Compendiaries maie testifie: for I knowe not howe it comes to passe, by the doating practise of our Diuinitie dunces, that striue to make their Pupills pulpet men, before they are reconciled to Priscian : but those yeares, which shoulde bee employed in Aristotle , are expired in Epitomes; and well too, they maye haue so much Catechisme vacation, to rake vp a little refuse Philosophie. And heere could I enter into a large fielde of inuectiue, against our abiect abbreuiations of Artes, were it not growen to a newe fashion amongst our Nation, to vaunt the pride of contraction in euerie manuarie action: in so much, that the Pater noster , which was woont to fill a sheete of paper, is written in the compasse of a pennie: whereupon one merelie affirmed, that prouerb to be deriued, No pennie, no pater noster ; which their nice curtalling, puts me in mind of the custome of the Scythians , who if they be at any time distressed with famin, take in their girdles shorter,  & swaddle themselues streighter, to the intent no vacuum beeing left in their intrayles, hunger should not so much tirannnize ouer their stomacks; euen so these men opprest with a greater penurie of Art, do pound their capacitie in barren Compendiums, and bound their base humors, in the beggerly straites of a hungry Analysis, least longing after that infinitum which the pouertie of their conceit cannot compasse, they sooner yeeld vp their youth to destinie, than their heart to vnderstanding. How is it then, such bungling practitioners in principles, shuld euer profite the Common wealth by their negligent paines, who haue no more cunning in Logique or Dialogue Latine, than appertains to the literall construction of either; neuerthelesse it is daily apparant to our domesticall eyes, that there is none so forward to publish their imperfections, either in the trade of glose or translations, as those that are more vnlearned than ignorance, and lesse conceiuing than infants. Yet dare I not impute absurditie to all of that societie, though some of them haue set their names to their simplicitie. Who euer my priuate opinion condemneth as faultie, Master Gascoigne is not to bee abridged of his deserued esteeme, who first beate the path to that perfection which our best Poets haue aspired too since his departure; whereto he did ascend by comparing the Italian with the English, as Tullie did Gr aecacum Latinis . Neither was Master Turbenile the worst of his time, although in translating he attributed too much to the necessitie of rime. And in this page of praise, I cannot omit aged Arthur Golding , for his industrious toile in Englishing Ouids Metamorphosis , besides manie other exquisite editions of Diuinitie, turned by him out of the French tongue into our own. Master Phaer likewise is not to be forgot in regard of his famous Uirgil , whose heauely verse had it not bin blemisht by his hautie thoghts England might haue long insulted in his wit, and corrigat qui potest haue been subscribed to his workes. But fortune the Mistres of change with a pitying compassion, respecting Master Stanihursts praise, would that Phaer shoulde fall that hee might rise, whose heroicall Poetrie infired, I should say inspired, with an hexameter furie, recalled to life, what euer hated barbarisme, hath bin buried this hundred yeare; and reuiued by his ragged quill, such carterlie varietie, as no hodge plowman in a countrie, but would haue held as the extremitie of clownerie; a patterne whereof, I will propounde to your iudgements, as neere as I can, being parte of one of his descriptions of a tempest, which is thus Then did he make, heauens vault to rebounde, with rounce robble, hobble Of russe rasse roaring, with thwick thirack thurlery bouncing Which strange language of the firmament neuer subiect before to our common phrase, makes vs that are not vsed to terminate heauens moueings, in the accents of any voice, esteeme of their triobulare interpreter, as of some Thrasonical huffe snuffe, for so terrible was his stile, to all milde eares, as would haue affrighted our peaceable Poets, from intermedling hereafter, with that quarrelling kinde of verse; had not sweete Master France by his excellent translation of Master Thomas Watsons sugred Amintas , animated their dulled spirits, to such high witted endeuors But I knowe not how, their ouer timerous cowardise, hath stoode in awe of enuie, that no man since him, durst imitate any of the worste, of those Romane wonders in english, which makes me thinke, that either the louers of mediocritie, are verie many, or that the number of good Poets, are very small: and in trueth, (Master Watson except, whom I mentioned before) I knowe not almost any of late dayes that hath shewed himselfe singular in any speciall Latine Po em, whose Amintas , and translated Antigone may march in equipage of honour, with any of our ancient Poets. I will not say but wee had a Haddon whose pen would haue challenged the Lawrell from Homer , together with Carre , that came as nere him, as Uirgil to Theocritus . But Tho. Newton with his Leyland , and Gabriell Haruey , with two or three other, is almost all the store, that is left vs at this hower. Epitaphers, and position Poets haue wee more than a good many, that swarme like Crowes to a dead carcas, but flie like Swallows in the VVinter, from any continuate subiect of witte. The efficient whereof, I imagine to issue, from the vpstart discipline, of our reformatorie Churchmen, who account wit vanitie, and poetrie impietie; whose error, although the necessitie of Philosophie might confute, which lies couched most closely vnder darke fables profunditie, yet I had rather referre it, as a disputatiue plea to diuines, than set it downe as a determinate position, in my vnexperienst opinion. But how euer their dissentious iudgements, should decree in their afternoone sessions of in sit , the priuat trueth, of my discouered Creede in this controuersie is this, that as that beast, was thought scarce worthie to bee sacrifised, to the  Ægiptian Epaphus , who had not some or other blacke spotte on his skinne: so I deeme him farre vnworthie of the name of a scholler,  & so consequentlie, to sacrifice his endeuors to art, that is not a Poet, either in whole or in a parte and here peraduenture, some desperate quipper, will canuaze my proposed comparison plus vltra , reconciling the allusion of the blacke spot, to the blacke pot; which makes our Poets vndermeale Muses so mutinous, as euerie stanzo they pen after dinner, is full poynted with a stabbe. Which their dagger drunkennesse, although it might be excused, with Tam Martiquam Mercurio , yet will I couer it as well as I may, with that prouerbiall foecundi calices , that might wel haue been doore keeper, to the kanne of Silenus , when nodding on his Asse trapt with iuie, hee made his moist nose cloth, the pausing intermedium, twixt euerie nappe. Let frugale scholares, and fine fingerd nouices, take their drinke by the ownce, and their wine by the halpe-worthes, but it is for a Poet, to examine the pottle pottes, and gage the bottome of whole gallons; qui bene vult ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , debet ante ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) .  A pot of blew burning ale, with a fierie flaming tost, is as good as Pallas with the nine Muses on Pernassus top: without the which, in vaine may they crie;  o thou my muse inspire mee with some pen, when they want certaine liquid sacrifice, to rouze her foorth her denne. Pardon me Gentlemen, though somewhat merely I glaunce, at their imoderate follie, who affirme that no man can write with conceit, except he take counsell of the cup: nor would I haue you thinke, that Theonino dente , I arme my stile against all, since I doo knowe the moderation of many Gentlemen of that studie, to be so farre from infamie, as their verse from equalitie: whose sufficiencie, were it as well seene into, by those of higher place, as it wanders abroade vnrewarded, in the mouthes of vngratefull monsters, no doubte but the remembrance, of Moecenas liberalitie, extended to Maro , and men of like qualitie, would haue lefte no memorie to that prouerb of pouertie, Si nihil attuleris, ibis Homere foras . Tut saies our English Italians, the finest witts our Climate sends foorth, are but drie braind doltes, in comparison of other countries: whome if you interrupt with redde rationem , they will tell you of Petrache, Tasso, Celiano , with an infinite number of others; to whome if I should oppose Chaucer, Lidgate, Gower , with such like, that liued vnder the tirranie of ignorance, I do think their best louers, would bee much discontented, with the collation of contraries, if I should write ouer al their heads, Haile fellow well met. One thing I am sure of, that each of these three, haue vaunted their meeters, with as much admiration in English, as euer the proudest Ariosto , did his verse in Italian. What should I come to our court, where the otherwhile vacations of our grauer Nobilitie, are prodigall of more pompous wit, and choyce of words, than euer tragick Tasso could attaine too: but as for pastorall Po emes, I will not make the comparison, least our countrimens credit should bee discountenanst by the contention, who although they cannot fare, with such inferior facilitie, yet I knowe would carrie the bucklers full easilie, from all forreine brauers, if their subiectum circa quod , should sauor of any thing haughtie: and should the challenge of deepe conceit, be intruded by any forreiner, to bring our english wit to the tutcsthone of Arte, I would preferre, diuine Master Spencer , the miracle of wit to bandie line for line for my life, in the honor of England , gainst Spaine, France, Italie , and all the worlde. Neither is he, the only swallow of our summer, (although Apollo , if his Tripos were vp again would pronounce him his Socrates ) but he being forborne, there are extant about London , many most able men, to reuiue Poetrie, though it were executed ten thousand times, as in Platos , so in Puritanes common wealth; as for example Mathew Roydon, Thomas Atchelow and George Peele , the first of whome, as hee hath shewed himselfe singular, in the immortall Epitaph of his beloued Astrophel , besides many other most absolute comicke inuentions (made more publique by euerie mans praise, than they can bee by my speache) so the second, hath more than once or twise manifested, his deepe witted schollership in places of credit;  & for the last, thogh not the least of them all, I dare commend him to all that know him, as the chiefe supporter of pleasance nowe liuing, the Atlas of Poetrie,  & primus verborum Artifex : whose first encrease, the Arraignement of Paris , might plead to your opinions, his pregnant dexteritie of wit, and manifold varietie of inuention; wherein ( me iudice ) hee goeth a step beyond all that write. Sundrie other sweete Gentlemen I know, that haue vaunted their pens in priuate deuices, and trickt vp a companie of taffata fooles with their feathers, whose beautie if our Poets had not peecte with the supply of their periwigs, they might haue antickt it vntill this time vp and downe the countrey with the King of Fairies , and dinde euerie daie at the pease porredge ordinarie with Delphrigus . But Tolossa hath forgot that it was sometime sackt, and beggers that euer they caried their fardles on footback: and in truth no meruaile, when as the deserued reputation of one Rossius , is of force to inrich a rabble of counterfets; yet let subiects for all their insolence, dedicate a De profundis euerie morning to the preseruation of their C aesar , least their encreasing indignities returne them ere long to their
