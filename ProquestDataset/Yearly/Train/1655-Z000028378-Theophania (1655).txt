 Had not this curious Piece (which of the kind, I think to be the first that ever our Country produced) come to my hands, in the quality of an Orphan, I had sav'd this labour; yet (since it seems the noble Author rather chose to be glorious in obscurity, then shine in popular applause) I will be bold to say, you will find so many marks and emanations of an illustrious Spirit, as could not possibly be acquired, but by the great advantages of education, travel and converse in the world and the Epitome's of the world (Courts) which may well intitle our Author to undertake a Subject of this nature wherein you will find Man, and the Passions of man (the great Engines of our Conversation) and (it may be) Traverses of State, set down as in a Mapp or Chart before you; withall, it is naturally English , and you have it faithfully out of the Original. Nor did I rashly venture upon this Publication; I took councel from the best Judges of these things: They unanimously tell me, that there wants nothing of the Spanish Designe, the French fluency and Courtship, the Italian gravity; or indeed any thing that may make up the whole Symmetry and decorum of a Piece of this nature. For, his Designes are natural, correspondent, and effective; his Scenes probable, and suitable; his Loves high and generous (but without extravagancy;) his Passions essential, and real, and such as perfectly limn different souls, in their different agitations; his discourses and reflections solid and mature, and the resultance of all this, so generous and harmonious, that I rather choose to leave you to the consideration of the several beauties you will find in every part thereof, then corrupt your judgements by a previous information in the general. Thus much to doe you and my self right, I thought fit to acquaint you with; being of opinion that the smallest part of the fate of this book depends upon my word, since I am perswaded it wil justifie it self; and if under some seeming Grotesques, you can find such a glass as will represent to you real and excellent figures, you will add to the pleasure I intend you, and I believe be a gainer by it. Near the Piazza in Covent -Garden, November 14\. 1654\. T. HEATH. THEOPHANIA. BOOK I. the envy of her neighbours, and the wonder of the whole world; till the people weary of so much felicity, to shew the greatness of their power, destroyed their own happiness, and what no Enemy durst attempt, by an intestine war invaded the liberties of their native Country. But this madness was not yet generall, when the season of the year, with the favorable influence of the heavens, had produced so great a serenity in the air, that the Sea having remained divers days in an undisturbed calm, the inhabitants of the coasts of Leontium resorted in troops to the shore, there to enjoy the freshness that in the evening came off from the Main; and whilst some recreated themselvs with their country sports upon the sands, others more active shewed their address in rowing, and those whose profession it was cast out nets for fish the chief Lord of the place, and of many adjacent villages, a person of eminent rank and condition, who being retired from the great affairs of the world, chose rather to live beloved in his own Province, then through vain ambition to tempt the hazards of fortune, in a State by civil dissentions exposed to ruine; and though not insensible of his Countries sufferings, yet not so far dejected with the sense thereof, as to debar himself of such delights as were necessary for the preservation of his health; with two Gentlemen, his attendants, came down to the Sea-side; and after some ordinary civilities passed amongst the chiefest of the Country-people that were his neighbours, entred into a Fallocque that waited for him, which was covered with Crimson-dammask, and slightly gilt and painted with the Arms and Devices of his Family, rather to shew a distinction from the vulgar, then any way to boast either his birth or quality. The Steers-man, as soon as his Master was seated in the Boat, directed his course towards a great point of Land that lay out into the Sea, where with more privacie he might enjoy the benefit of the air: And whilst they advanced gently into the Main, he entertained his company with several discourses, to which they were exceeding attentive, all that had the honour to be neer him, finding that they profited more by his ordinary familiar talk, then they could ever attain to in the Schools of the Philosophers; for they study only to dispute, but he studied the truth; and with those reasons on which he had founded his own judgment, would communicate his conclusions to others: Yet at that time he was not upon any deep subject, but only relating divers passages and occurrences of State, in which himself had been a principal actor; and from the unexpected alterations that had happened, arguing the uncertainty of mans condition. When having gained the Point whither he was going, he discovered a tall Ship, with her sails flaging about her masts, that lay becalmed about two leagues from the shore, which at the same instant first hung out a white Flag, and then struck her main Top-sail, intelligible signs amongst Mariners of a friendly approach; and if she were not in some distress, that either she desired Boats to land passengers, or else a Pilot to conduct her upon those Coasts. Synesius, so was this noble person called, whatsoever the meaning were, being ever ready to perform the office of a Cavalier, presently commanded his men to row back agen with all the speed that was possible; and having taken care himself to see a Fallocque well manned, gave them order to go immediately aboard the Vessel, to be informed what she was, and if they found her a friend, as he imagined, to do them all hospitable services that their occasions did require. But notwithstanding the diligence that was used. by that time they were ready to launch, the Sun had finished his course for that day; yet the dawn of the evening, with the brightness of the Moon in a cleer sky, encouraged the Sea-men to a prompt obedience, though otherwise observant enough of their Lords commands, who was not more reverenced amongst them for his authority, then beloved and honour'd for his hospitality. As soon as they had doubled the Point, they presently saw the Ship, which still lay hulking in the same manner, and at that time again with beat of drum and sound of trumpet made all the noise that was possible; which caused the Mariners the more vigorously to pursue their course: But before they had advanced far, they perceived, a good distance from them, two things floating upon the water, which at first they supposed to be either by chance, or on purpose, cast out of the vessel; but by the disturbance of the Sea in so great a Calm, they soon found their mistake, yet could not imagine what they should be; for their motions yielded sometimes such a resplendent brightness, and such a sparkling light, as if against nature the Ocean had cast up flakes of fire, or else Stars shot from the firmament had remained floating upon the surface thereof. Some conjectured one thing, some another; and the wisest amongst them would needs have the rest imagine that it was nothing else but the reflection of the Moon upon the breaking of the water, caused by Porpices or some other great fishes, and began to wish their business dispatched, apprehending, as it is commonly believed among Sea-men, that the appearing of those creatures presaged a storm, or at least a great alteration of the weather. Whilst they were thus reasoning amongst themselves, they approached so neer the object of their wonder, that the dispute ceased, though not their admiration: For they plainly discerned two young men of an excellent beauty swiming towards them; one whereof carried in his hand a naked Sword of a rarely polished mettle, and the other had about his neck a Tablet mervailously enriched with diamonds. The former seeing an unexpected assistance so neer, launched himself forward with a wonderfull force, and catching hold of one of the Oars, with the help thereof leaped aboard; then waving his sword above his head, immediately with both his hands laid the hilt thereof, which was curiously enchased with rubies, to his heart, and casting up his eyes to heaven smiled a little, as if by that he had overcome the present, and meant to vanquish all future danger. But at the same instant the other, his strength failing him, began to sink, and he had undoubtedly perished, if the mariners, notwithstanding their surprisal by so strange an accident, had not been very speedy in giving him assistance, and as he rise agen above the water, taken hold of his Taffata breeches, which were all the garment he had on, and by them lifted him into their Fallocque. At the first, though he were not altogether without life, yet he was in a manner past sense; but by bending his body forward, and other usual remedies that Sea-men in such cases practice, having voided a great quantity of water, which overcharged his stomack, he soon came to himself again, and immediately feeling for the Tablet that was about his neck, with great reverence kissed it, holding up his hands to heaven, as in token of thankfulness, that since his life was preserved, that Jewel was so likewise, which he seemed to value not inferior to the other: Then kissing it agen, and fixing his eyes upon the Characters artificially formed with Diamonds of an inestimable value, after a deep sigh cryed out, Ah Mariana! and having pronounced that name so sacred to his memory; presently stoped, as if in that one word he had said all that could be spoken. But at length calling to mind his condition, he looked earnestly about him to consider into what hands he was fallen; when perceiving his companion that had run the like hazard with himself, and in the same manner as he thought preserved, they presently embraced, with infinite testimonies of joy congratulating each others safety; and had continued longer in those expressions, if the mariners desiring to finish their work, had not interrupted them with signs that they made, for they perceived they were strangers, and spake another language, to know whether they should return back, or else go on to the ship, of which they supposed they were: but understanding they desired rather they should return, having accommodated them the best they could with garments, of which two of the Sea-men willingly stript themselves, they instantly tackt about, and a fresh gale then rising from the sea, almost in a moment arrived upon the shore. The Country-people, partly in curiosity to hear news, for by reason of the war some novelty or other happened almost every day, but the better sort to wait upon Synesius , attended the return of the Fallocque; which no sooner touched upon the Beach, but they all flocked to the Sea-side, and when they were ready to land, He with his Gentlemen being come to the head of the Boat, when they saw the strangers, were seised with a kind of admiration, in beholding two such goodly persons in a habit so unsuitable to their demeanure, and presently step'd to give them their hands; which civility, as soon as they were on shore, they returned with great demonstrations of gratitude, and by their deportment gave testimony of a birth and education far above their present condition. They were both of equal perfections, though somthing differing in years, the eldest being about two and twenty, the other not above nineteen; the one of a most delicate complexion, the other of a more manly vigorous composition; the one the people were ready to adore as the God of war, the other emblemed that Youth for whom the Goddess of Love herself suffered such an ardent passion; and both had impressed such characters of manhood and beauty, as promised an assured victory in the contentions either of Love, or War. The elder was of a stature more then the ordinary size of men; his hair, which was brown, hung in great tings dangling upon his shoulders, his beard appeared only like young doun, his eyes were gray, yet full of a majestick gravity, and his face though something enclined to leanness, was the index of a most daring mind, and more generous spirit; in brief, nature had framed his body, as if to shew the perfection of the sex both in comelines of proportion, and address in all manner of exercises. The other was about half the head lower, and of a complexion that made all others neer him seem to have none; his hair flaxen, with such a glistering brightness, as that alone was ornament enough for any one man; but all the rest of the fabrick was answerable, large gray eyes, a wide forehead, a mild cheerfull countenance, and a shape so compleat as drew the eyes of all the beholders into admiration. The worthy Synesius took so strict a survey of these rare endowments, that he assured himself they were persons to be treated with more then a common civility: On the other side, his grave deportment, the honour that was rendred him by the people, and the extraordinary respect he used towards them, were sufficient testimonies that he was a person of eminent degree and quality; wherefore they made their addresses to him with great shews of humility, being ready to give him all the dues belonged to his quality, as willing for the present to conceal their own. So that after the first salutations were past with equal complements and caresses on either side; Sir, said the elder stranger, We desire you will be pleased to look upon us as persons, after infinite sufferings, at length by the compassion of the Gods exposed to your charity; and though we already owe you for our own preservation, before we can scarcely acknowledg that debt, we must implore the continuance thereof towards the men left in our Vessel, which lies not far hence in the road, but hath sprung so many leaks, that without present assistance they must all certainly perish. Synesius not suffering him to proceed farther, replied, If I have any way obliged you, I perceive you are Cavaliers of so much worth, that I esteem my self happy in the occasion; and for your request, it is my duty to perform what you desire: But you have already suffered too much in your own persons, therefore I beseech you to take such refreshment as my poor habitation not far from hence will afford, and doubt not of my care in sending present assistance to your ship. Whereupon turning about to Nicander, he gave him order and full authority immediately to man all the Boats upon the coast, and to conduct them himself into the Road. Whilst he was giving such directions as were necessary, it being something late, and the sky begining to be darkned with clouds, his Chariot was come to the place, with some of his servants, to wait upon their Lord home; and immediately the wind begining to rise by degrees, such a sudden shower of rain poured down upon them, as forced him with his guests, and Eleutherius the other Gentleman that accompanied him, without farther complement or ceremony to enter into the Chariot, and dissipated the rest of the company to their several homes; only Nicander calling the Sea-men about him, remained under the shelter of a poor Cottage, to put in execution those commands which his Lord had left with him concerning the Vessel in the road. Though Synesius house were but a little way distant from the sea, yet the storm was so sudden and violent, mixed with such terrible thunder and lightening, that the horses being hot-metled could not be governed by the driver; yet with the help of the Footmen. though with some disorder, they were made to advance, till being come under the shelter of certain trees, which planted in four ranks made a spacious shady ascent up to the house, they began to go quietly of themselves; and at length being come into the Base-court, divers servants with torches of white-wax attended at the gate: But when they were descending from the Chariot, the younger of the two Strangers was found in such a condition, that they could scarcely discern any life in him, which by reason of the noise and disorder caused by the tempest, was not till then perceived; wherefore he was carried upon mens arms, accompanied by Synesius , and his companion in misfortune, into a chamber fit to receive so noble a guest, where all means were used to recover his fainting spirits, caused, being of a delicate complexion, through his sufferings first in the ship, and the over-violent force he used afterwards to recover the shore by swiming. But being laid in a bed, and having taken such Cordials which Synesius sent for out of his Cabinet, he soon came to himself agen, yet not so but that there remained almost certain symptoms of a violent feaver; to prevent which, nothing was judged more necessary for the present then a little repose: wherefore Synesius having expressed his sorrow for so ill an accident, and left a necessary attendance about him, conducted his other guest to another appartement, which was so richly furnished, the feelings so nobly gilt, and the chimneys and windows so adorned with porphyrie, and polished marble, that the Stranger could not think it less then a Princes palace, or at least a Subjects of the most eminent rank. Nevertheless Synesius , through his accustomed civility, made many excuses for the defects of the place, promising to supply them with a ready obedience to all his commands; and thereupon it being late, caused only a slight Collation to be brought up, to refresh him after his sufferings at sea: But as they sate together, perceiving his Guest to be full of pensiveness, for that time troubled him not with many questions, or much discourse; but the tables being taken away, told him that he thought rest was most suitable to one in his condition, and therefore for the present he would leave him to it, assuring him that he would not be deficient in any obsequious offices either towards himself, or those remaining in the ship; and that if the sudden tempest had not prevented it, they had already received such succor as that Coast could afford. Sir, replied the Stranger, I find you so abounding in all kind of courtesie, that I cannot but render thanks to heaven, that after so many adversities I am arrived in a place of such generous entertainment; yet I cannot but remain perplexed to see my companion in affliction, though otherwise a stranger to me, in so ill a condition; but as to those in the ship, (whereupon through a generous compassion he fetched a deep sigh) I fear the storm hath prevented those benefits you intended towards them; however I cannot despair of their safety, since you have been pleased to undertake their protection, whose actions I perceive are favoured by the Gods. Synesius told him, If the Gods were pleased to concur with his desires, there was no doubt of their safety; therefore earnestly entreated him to take such repose as the time required: And thereupon, after infinite acknowledgments of mutual obligations, and many civilities passed on either side, Synesius, leaving two Gentlemen to attend him, retired to his own lodging, where as soon as he had given order to one of his servants to go early the next morning for Cassianus a famous Physitian, who was then at certain medicinal wells about two leagues off, went to his rest, which he fell into with great satisfaction, having ended the day with works of so much hospitable charity, yet not with a perfect content, because of the fears he conceived for those still remaining in the ship. The Stranger being now left to himself, having put on such linnen as lay prepared for him, soon dismissed his attendants, and casting himself into his bed, the remembrance of his former misfortunes in the whole course of his life, came so thick upon him, that overpressed with care and grief, at length he yielded to sleep which on a sudden wholly possessed him. About two or three hours after, as soon as day began to break, by which time the storm was quite over, there was a great noise of men and horse about the house: whereupon Synesius , who was watchfull upon all occasions, apprehending Souldiers were come into those quarters, and fearing his new guests might be molested with tumults, immediately calling for Eleutherius , desired him to look out, and to bring word what might be the occasion of so early a disturbance. But as soon as he had caused the gates to be opened, and was going out with half a dozen resolute men, well prepared for any equal encounter, Nicander entred into the Court, followed by a great number of Sea-men and Country people, besides horses and mules with several ladings, and amongst the rest two persons, who both by their habits and demeanure bore the appearance of Gentlemen. Eleutherius soon conjectured the truth, that these were persons and goods come from the ship; yet desiring to return with full information, entreated Nicander to relate to him the particular passages that had happened: Who readily condescending to his request, told him that immediately after his Lord was departed, whilst he was preparing Boats, there rise so great a wind, which came directly off from the Sea, that the Captain seeing his Vessel almost half full of water, and despairing of all other means of safety, taking the advantage thereof, commanded his men to make all the sail they could, and laying her just in the wind, ran in upon the shore, where she stuck fast upon the sand for a while; but being so neer, he used such diligence, that all the men, and goods of any value were saved, and that immediately after by the force of the waves beating upon her she was broke into a thousand pieces: That among the rest those two Gentlemen, who called themselvs Lysander & Cleanthes , made great enquiry after two persons, who rather then to run the hazard of perishing miserably in the Vessel, had exposed themselves, whilst the Sea was calm, to the mercy of the waters; And being assured they were in safety, with great expressions of joy desired to be conducted to them with those coffers which it seems were left in their charge; but being very sparing in their discourse, and wary of discovering themselves, that he knew nothing more of their story then what their present condition declared. This was sufficient: Therefore having desired Nicander to give all civil respects to the Gentlemen, and to entertain the rest in the best manner he could, according to their several conditions, he hasted with the news to Synesius, who was not a little pleased that the men were so happily preserved, and desired Eleutherius to communicate the same to his guests, but by no means if they were reposed to disturb them. The one being indisposed, he judged it most convenient to go first to the others appartement, who being lodged on that side the house next the gate, had heard much that passed, and as Eleutherius came to the door, was ready, having cast a night-gown about him, to come out; and as soon as they met, after the first salutations were past, he recounted to him all that had happened, and how there were two Gentlemen, Cleanthes and Lysander , that made great enquiry after him and his Companion. Whereat the Stranger seeming much rejoyced, returning agen into his chamber, desired Cleanthes might be brought to him, which was immediately done, who as soon as he saw his master, touched the ground with one knee, and offered to kiss his hand; but he not suffering it, raised him up, and as he embraced him, pretending to kiss his cheek, whispered something in his ear: which Eleutherius observing, though it were only to advertise him that he should not use any such ceremony, imagined he desired to be in private, and presently withdrew. Being gone down stairs, passing through the great Hall, he met Cassianus the Physitian, whom Synesius had sent for to visit his sick guest, and after a civil salute conducted him to his Lords lodging, who being by this time ready, kindly welcomed him; and having first visited his Lady to acquaint her with what had passed, which as yet she understood but imperfectly, immediately called for Lysander, and having embraced him gave him his hand, which the other offered to kiss; but he not permitting that, said, I shall perhaps return your civility to your satisfaction, if you will take the pains to go a little with me. For understanding the other was private with Cleanthes , he meant to visit his sick guest first; and entring into the Ante-chamber, he was informed by the attendants, that though he had taken a little rest, yet he found no intermission of his feaver. Wherefore going softly into the room, they approached towards him with as little noise as might be: but he hearing their tread, put back the curtain with his hand; to see who they were; and as soon as Lysander espied him, without any ceremony, running to the bed-side, he kneeled down, and holding up his hands said, Ah my Lord and Prince! Is it possible I see you safe here? Have the Gods been so favorable to hear my prayers for your preservation? I can now no more doubt of a good success to all our undertakings, and that this Land will be propitious unto us, since at our first arrival we have found such humanity amongst the inhabitants, and so favourable an entertainment in this place. He would have spoken more; but the Prince putting his arm about his neck, and laying his face close to his, with a close embrace hindred his speech, saying, How pleasing this encounter is, I leave to your self to judge; but the preservation of my life, and with my life this Jewel (shewing the Tablet) which encloseth the Idea of my souls happiness, I owe to this worthy Lord, pointing to Synesius , who took that occasion to approach neerer to him, though with greater reverence then before, understanding somthing of his quality, and humbly desired him not to call that a debt which was but a duty on his part; for if he had done him any service, both the benefit and the honour redounded wholly to himself, praying him for the present to think of nothing but the preservation of his health, and thereupon presented Cassianus , assuring him that he might rely upon his skill as the most learned and practised in his profession, of the whole kingdom. The Prince having accepted his offer, and with a courteous salute welcomed the Physitian, Synesius presently left the chamber, desiring Lysander who remained there, to command both himself, his house, and family in any thing that might be usefull for the Princes service, who having made a due acknowledgment of his noble hospitality, and conducted him to the stairs head, returned agen into the chamber to advise with Cassianus concerning the Princes indisposition. In this interim Cleanthes gave a full account to his Lord of all that had happened in the ship after his departure; how the mariners being wearied with their continual labour in pmping, the water came in upon them in such abundance, that to lighten her they were forced to heave all the lumber, and a great part of their lading over board, and that amongst the rest the coffer in which was the Cabinet with all his jewels, was in the confusion, by mistake, cast into the sea. Wherewith not seeming at all moved, he only asked whether his Arms were safe; and understanding they were, replied, With them, and this, pointing to his sword, I must get more. And thereupon Synesius entring into his chamber, hearing him coming he left Cleanthes , and receiving him at the dore, after mutual complements and civilities on either side, the Company waiting in the outward room, they sate down together, and began to enter into discourse. There is no doubt but Synesius had a great desire to know the person he had entertained, and something of the passages of his life, having as it appeared by some strange accident been brought upon that coast; yet he would not so much as by circumstance give any hint thereof, left it might displease. But the Stranger making many acknowledgments of the obligations he had received from him, and then composing his countenance, began to speak in the native language of the Country; at which Synesius was not a little amazed, and could not so conceal it but the Stranger perceived an alteration in his countenance. Whereupon he said, I see you wonder that I, a Stranger, having hitherto used another dialect, should now speak in your own language: But I find you a person of so much honour, that I dare not doubt to repose a confidence in you; yet I have been hitherto so unfortunate both in my self and family, that if I were not inwardly assured by all your proceedings, that you live by principles of honor and justice, should not so freely communicate my self to you as I intend. When you know my name, you will know part of my misfortunes; and as you are affected to your Kings service, either continue your friendly offices towards me, or else deliver me into the hands of his and my enemies, who I very well know have only for their own ends caused so many miserable distractions in this Island. Synesius finding him so well acquainted with the affairs of the Country, replied, Sir, whatsoever my inward inclinations are concerning the present war, or the differences between the King and his People, you may be assured I can never betray a trust; and therefore you may freely communicate your self so far as you think I may be serviceable to your affairs, and you shall not find me so impertinently curious as to enquire farther. Then the Stranger, bending his body a little forward, with a great sigh said, No, I know the worthy Synesius is descended of too noble a race, to be treacherous to the unfortunate, and much wronged Philocles . Immediately Synesius putting back his chair, rise up, and replied, Sir, you have told me enough to teach me my duty; I now know the respect I ought to bear you, and you shall not find yourself deceived in the trust you have been pleased to repose in me. But before he could proceed farther, Prince Philocles forced him to take his seat agen, and then he continued: Sir, if I am contended to be thus unmannerly in your presence, be pleased to impute it to a compliance with your affairs; for I shall humbly advise you will as yet conceal your self, and not make known who you are to any in this place: For though my loyalty, and the relation I have ever had to the Kings service, will oblige me to be faithful to you, yet I am not exempt from those inconveniences which divers great Families in this Country now suffer, to have many neer to me, and even my own Children, of contrary inclinations perhaps to my self; and though I believe they would not injure me so much, as to do any thing unworthy of their birth, yet being engaged with the other party, I cannot tell how far those obligations may prevail with them above the respect they ought to bear to you as a Prince, or the reverence which is due to me as a Father. It is true, I have heard much of the calamities that have befallen your royal family, yet not so perfectly, but I shall, if the request be not unmannerly, desire to be better informed, when your disposition, and the convenience both of time and place shall concur to invite you to it; but for the present I shall with leave retire, untill such time as you make yourself ready to partake of that homely entertainment which this poor place can afford. And Philocles being exceedingly pleased with the discourse he had already held with Synesius , not desiring to pass farther for the present, willingly dismissed him. During the time of this conference, Cleanthes having caused the Coffers to be opened, had prepared cloaths and other necessaries for the Princes wearing, which he put on whilst Synesius was giving order about his houshold affairs. The one and the other were soon dispatched: For Synesius lived in such order and method, that his more serious thoughts were seldom interrupted with petty domestick business; and Prince Philocles was so much a Souldier, that he despised effeminate adornments, and held those unworthy the name of Man, that would consume any considerable part of their time in those affected vanities. Therefore soon after they had parted, Philocles having sent Cleanthes to visit the sick Prince, they met in the garden, which was so stored with rare fruits of all kinds, so adorned with Fountains, Grots, Canals, and Walks both artificial and natural; and that part of the house which fronted upon the Garden, was such a noble, antient fabrick, that all considered together, they shewed both the antiquity of the family to which they belonged, and the continuance of it in greatness and prosperity to those latter times, which had furnished so many rare inventions for pleasure and magnificence. When they had a little recreated themselves with walking, and were discoursing of the pleasant scituation of the place, Eleutherius brought Lysander and Cassianus the Physitian to them, who gave this account of his Patients condition, that he was in a violent dangerous feaver, caused as he understood by unaccustomed sufferings in his voyage, yet, as he feared, augmented by some inward passion of the mind; and that besides the remedies he should apply, there was nothing more necessary for the recovery of his health then a quiet repose, and therefore that he desired he might not be molested with any company saving a necessary attendance for the space of three dayes, in which time he should be able to give a sure judgment of his disease; doubting not if these orders were observed; he would by the help of youth quickly recover his former strength. The Prince was exceedingly pleased with such fair hopes of his Companions recovery; and after mutual congratulations between him and Lysander for their safe arrival, notice-being given by the Steward that it was Noon, and Synesius having intimated to Prince Philocles , that to avoid the suspition of desiring to be concealed, it would be best to eat publikely, as a private person with the rest, all the Company went together to his appartement, where by Synesius directions the dinner was prepared, and all things were served with that decencie and order as was suitable to the present occasion, though not with that ceremony and state as was due to so great a Prince. But Synesius failed not to entertain his guests with variety of discourse, in which he excelled most men of that age; and in this differed from all others, that he never willingly suffered any thing to be said at his table of sacred things belonging to the worship of the Gods, nor of the present differences or publike affairs, nor yet in censure of particular persons of what degree or quality soever; but ever framed his discourse suitable to his company: With Souldiers, he would talk of martial exercises, or Fortifications; with Courtiers, of Tennis, Hunting, or riding the great Horse; with Scholars, of some point of Philosophie, or else compare histories of antient times; and was so generally knowing, that he pleased all of the meanest capacities: For even with the Country Magistrates he would seem to inform himself of their wayes of Judicature; and with his neighbours talk of Husbandry, planting Trees, or breeding of Cattel, with as much insight as if he had been bred only in such employments. But at that time falling aptly upon it by reason of the Princes sickness, he proposed a subject whereby Cassianus might shew his learning, concerning the Circulation of the blood, which by reason of the novelty was very pleasing; and he proved it with such strong argumentations, and solid reasons, that all the company condescended to his opinion. Dinner being ended, they returned agen into the garden; where Philocles and Synesius having withdrawn themselves into a private Walk shaded with Laurel, Synesius with many professions of service and fidelity humbly desired the Prince to acquaint him with the particular passages of his life: To which he was very willing, but for the present excused himself, as thinking it necessary in the first place to give a visit to his Lady: but Synesius told him, that she having intended a journey to Palermo , the Metropolis of that Kingdom, to visit her Sister, had chosen that time as most convenient, that the house might be the more free for the entertainment of himself; which inclination of hers he had farthered, as thinking her absence at that time not unnecessary, and that she was departed early, to enjoy the cool of the morning. The Prince smiling, thanked him for his care; but instead of entring into the discourse desired, told him, You already know much of my story, or at least so much as is publike to the world; and for other particulars, I shall not fail to take a time to acquaint you with them. But for the present I should request you to make me some brief accompt of the state of these Kingdoms, the original of the War, and the proceedings thereof, in which I am too ignorant being so neerly concerned, having never yet, though I have been active enough in the cause, met with any that agreed in their relations, or could make a perfect discourse thereof; yet if it please you, we will for a while lay by both the one and the other: For this stranger that is in your house, and who it seems is a Prince, hath certainly been drawn hither by some extraordinary adventure, which perhaps would be of some concernment to know; and the Physitian having ordained him so many dayes of repose, it is not unlikely we may receive satisfaction therein from Lysander , who undoubtedly is acquainted with every particular of his life. This Proposition was very gratefull to Synesius ; therefore they returned agen to mingle with the company, and having separated Lysander from the rest, when they were at a distance, Prince Philocles without more circumstance said, Worthy Lysander , I esteem it one of the happiest encounters of my life, that offered an occasion of my coming first into your Princes company; and though we were strangers before, we have since been companions, at least in our sufferings; and I have observed in him so great and generous a courage upon all occasions, that I cannot be blamed if I am transported with a passionate desire to know the story of his life: Besides, we are both indebted to this noble Lord for our preservation; and he joyning with me in this request, I suppose you will be ready to give him that satisfaction, unless there be some notable reason to the contrary. Sir, replied Lysander , I easily imagined our noble Host and yourself, having seen so much of the Prince my master, could not be without a curiosity of knowing more; and therefore conceiving it just to comply with persons of so much worth, I took that time you were retired together into the close walk, to ask his consent thereunto; which having easily obtained, I am ready whensoever you please to satisfie your desires. They both returned him many thanks for his ready compliance; and their curiosity not suffering them to defer it longer, by Synesius advice, for the more privacie, they went out of the garden, through the house, into the Park, which was but a hundred paces distant, and lay upon an easie ascent, there being a spacious Walk adorned with fountains, and shaded with well grown trees, that led to a Mount covered with a great wood, in the midst whereof was a square place cut out with seats of marble, and an artificial Grot representing Parnassus , on the top whereof stood a Pegasus, from the impression of whose foot issued a Fountain, and round about it were placed Apollo with the Muses playing upon several instruments, which by the motion of the water yielded a most pleasing harmony, and even ravished the beholders with delight. But having a while considered the beauty of the place, the artificial conveyance of the water, and the pleasant prospect they had from thence over a declining Lawn, (in the midst whereof, by a great Lake, fed a numerous Herd of Deer) upon the house and gardens compassed in with a large river, and bounded on the other side with fruitful hills, flourishing with corn and wine; Synesius invited them to sit down, and Prince Philocles not failing to put Lysander in mind of his promise, he expecting it, being placed in the midst of them, began his relation after this manner. ' Greece is not so remote, nor the name of the renowned Polidor so unknown to the world, that I need spend much time either in the description of the Country, or of the noble race of which Prince Demetrius my master is descended.' Philocles at that name clapping his hand upon his breast, Is this, said he, that Prince Demetrius whose actions have rendred him so famous, and whose loss of late hath been so much lamented throughout all Greece? It is the same, replied Lysander ; and since you take such pleasure in the discovery of the person, I doubt not but the story of his life will yield you such content, that you will the easilier pardon my defect of language in the relation of it. Then setling himself agen to continue his discourse, they heard in the wood close behind them the treading of horse, and a sound of harness; when starting up to see what the matter should be, they perceived they were almost quite environed by a company of twelve or fourteen armed men, who as they came out of the Grot, rushing violently upon them, he that seemed to command, cryed out, That is the other we look for, pointing to Philocles, Seise upon him; and for the rest, you may if you please be secure, for there is no harm intended towards you. But Prince Philocles being of too great a courage so tamely to yield himself, stood upon his guard; and the first that advanced to lay hold of him, he encountred so luckily with the point of his sword beneath his arms, that receiving a mortal wound in the belly, he fell dead from his horse; and the Prince at the same instant seising upon the reins, with a marvellous activity leapt into the saddle; when immediately the whole Troop having surrounded him, one crying out, Yield thy self and thou shalt have quarter, those words animated him with such a fury, that he soon stopt his speech that uttered them with a fatal thrust, which entring in at his mouth pierced him quite through the throat: Then seeking to disengage himself from amongst them, and finding one, who was the chief of the party, had fast hold of his bridle, with one mighty blow he cut off both his hands, and so having freed himself wheeled about to gain advantage for a second encounter. These more then actions of a man, seeing two of their men killed, and their Commander in such a condition, so daunted the rest, that they began to think of their defence; but perceiving that Synesius and Lysander having possessed themselves of the weapons of their slain Companions came likewise to assault them, one taking their hurt man behind him, they immediately set spurs to their horses, and with all the speed they could make fled towards a great Wood about five hundred paces distant, not far from the Park-gate. Philocles eager of an absolute victory, pursued them close: Synesius and Lysander being on foot, could not accompany him otherwise then with their eyes, which notwithstanding all their manhood were even ready to overflow with tears, when they perceived it was impossible for them to give any assistance to that gallant Prince, who being neer the Wood, there issued out of the shelter thereof a body of about a hundred horse, which having on a sudden hemmed him on every side, immediately marched away quite of their sight. This unexpected surprisal was such an infinite affliction to the noble Synesius , that notwithstanding the great resolution which in all accidents ever preserved him in an equal temper, he could not forbear to break out into most grievous complaints, that the hospitality of his house should against all the laws of civility be so barbarously violated; and Lysander was no less sensible of the Princes misfortune: But having both been Souldiers, they very well knew that such accidents were the ordinary effects of war; and therefore returned towards the house, with a resolution to make all the force they could and immediately to pursue after them. But as they were going down the hill, they perceived four or five horsmen spuring up towards them, which were Nicander with some other of the domesticks; who told his Lord, That he and Cleanthes walking in the Park without any weapons, they were on a sudden set upon by a party of half a dozen horse, and that not being in a posture to make any defence, they had seised upon Cleanthes and carried him away with them; wherefore his intent was to follow the same rout they had taken, and if it were possible to deliver him out of their hands. No, no, replied Synesius, it is too late: But immediately return; and whilst some make ready all the horse in my own stables, let others try what force they can raise in the village, for we have present occasion to use all our friends. Nicander not staying to reply, presently returned; and by that time Synesius entred into the Court, the allarum which was given had brought together a great number of Country-people, who without asking the cause were ready to hazard themselves upon any design, and nothing seemed more irksom to them then delay of action. Nevertheless he declared to them in short the reason of their assembling; and having called for his Arms, desired such as were sensible of the affront he had received, to assist him in the just vindication of his honour: To which all expressed a wonderfull readiness, professing to live and die with him; and Lysander having visited Prince Demetrius , yet with a great caution that he should not acquaint him with any thing that had passed, would needs accompany him in the action; but Eleutherius was left behind with order to arm all the Mariners and Sea-men, that had suffered shipwrack, to defend the house, if occasion should be, from any sudden assault. They marched about two leagues upon the same rout which they imagined the other took, without hearing any news of them; but at last met a poor Peasant, who being asked whether he had not seen such a troop, replied yes too lately for they had by force taken away his horse to mount one of their companions, and that about a quarter of a league thence, in the valley, lay their main body, consisting of fiveteen hundred horse, and that when they joyned they made great shoutings and acclamations of joy, as in token of some notable success. Synesius and Lysander easily conjectured the cause of their rejoycing, but were very much troubled at the report of their number; and the Country-people, though before their coming forth they were so hot and defied all the world, presently upon this news began to face about; yet at Synesius entreaty were content to make a stand, till himself with Lysander and some others went to the top of the hill to discover their strength; and finding it rather more then less then was reported, besides that they knew it would be impossible to make the men advance, they saw indeed it would be but a vain attempt to pursue them any further; and therefore with many thanks dismissing the peasants to their several habitations, he with Lysander and his domesticks, though with sorrowful hearts, returned towards his own house. But when they were within sight of the Park-wall, a little on the right hand, behind a Wood, they heard a great clashing of weapons and arms: wherefore moved with curiosity to know what should be the occasion thereof, Synesius spuring his horse, took a path that led directly to the place from whence the noise came, where he beheld a Knight in black Arms excellently well mounted, that seemed to perform more then humane actions: For of a dozen that had attacqued him, four lay already dead upon the ground; and he with the help only of his Squire, who having had his horse newly killed under him fought on foot, with admirable valour and address defended himself against the rest, yet so wounded in several places, that through the loss of blood it was impossible they should have held out long against so great a disadvantage: but at the same instant that Synesius came in, having recollected all his strength, he charged the foremost with such a mighty force upon the head, that his helmet flew off, and then redoubling the blow, separated his head from his shoulders: which struck so great an admiration into Synesius , that he could not forbear to cry out, Sir, I perceive your own valour is enough to protect you against a multitude of enemies; but the baseness of these appears such, that they deserve not to fall by your hands; thereupon giving one of them such a wound upon the right arm, that his sword fell to the ground; and by this time Lysander with the rest being come up to them, finding it in vain any longer to persist in their attempt, they sought to preserve themselves by flight, which was no difficult matter, for there was not any took care to pursue after them, believing their own fears would carry them far enough from attempting any new mischief. But the stranger Knight finding himself disencumbered of his enemies, lighted immediately from his horse, which he delivered to his Squire; and Synesius at the same time doing the like, they embraced each other with great sentiments of joy, the one that he had been so fortunate to succor so undaunted a Cavalier, and the other in the encounter of so generous a Friend. But the Knight breaking silence first, said, Sir, I know not who you are that have thus obliged me; but I am sure your courtesie hath preserved my life from the barbarous attempt of these bloody villains; which I shall never hereafter account my own, since in gratitude you ought to dispose of it. To which Synesius replied, That the Gods being sensible of his late sufferings, had blessed him with this occasion to perform a service to a person of so much apparent merit; and though he feared the assistance he had given him, in it self unconsiderable, might be a detraction to his own valour, by which alone he would undoubtedly have forced his adversaries to have paid the forfeiture of so vile a treachery with the effusion of their dearest blood, yet he beseeched him that he would make a favourable construction of his intentions, and in token thereof (putting up his own beaver) fo far to honour him, that he might know his face, whose vertue he so much admired. Whereupon the Knight thinking it discourteous not to satisfie his request, having unlaced his helmet, discovered such a majestick beauty, that they all thought they never had beheld any equal to it, though Synesius who was no less ravished then the rest, supposed the air of his countenance was not altogether unknown to him; yet not calling any thing perfectly to mind that might avow such an imagination, he only looked upon him as the perfection of all the sex: His eyes, when he fixed them seriously, commanding an awful reverence in all the assistants; and when he smiled a little, infusing a kind of cheerfulness into their hearts. He was not above eighteen years of age, yet of the just stature of the most accomplished men; his hair of so perfect a black, that for colour and lustre nothing could be compared to it but Jet; which hanging in great curls below his shoulders, as the wind blew it before his face, appeared like a cloud envying the glory of the sun; and his face which was full and round, cast such resplendeut rays through that cloud, that it even dazeled the eyes of the beholders; and all together framed such a royal meine, that both knees and hearts were ready to bow at his devotion. And though Synesius still lamented the ill fortune of Prince Philocles , yet he could not but applaud his own, which had ministred such an opportunity to offer his service to this stranger. Therefore with great respect addressing his speech to him, he besought him that he would be pleased, though he could no way merit so great an honour, that in regard of himself, having some wounds upon him, which perhaps might require the assistance of a Chirurgion, for the present to repose himself at his house, whither he should not presume to invite him, but that he was assured he had one there that was esteemed the most skilfull Operator in the whole kingdom. The Knight finding his condition required such a one, kindly accepted his offer; and mounting agen on hors-back, having given Nicander's to the Squire, they soon arrived at Synesius house, which was not above half a league from that place; where having conducted the Knight to Philocles appartement, and called for Cassianus , who was a most excellent Chyrurgion as well as a Physitian. All retiring out of the room except the Squire and some few attendants, he was presently laid into his bed; and Cassianus having searched his wounds, found none of them dangerous, and but one of any consequence, which was a deep cnt upon the fleshy part of his left arm: To which having applied such remedies as were necessary, and by reason of his loss of blood ordained him only some comfortable Cordial for that night, would have left him to his rest; but the Knight would not let him depart untill he had, in his presence, first performed the same office to his Squire, who had, besides a great hurt on the head, a deep wound on his left side under the heart, which raised some apprehensions of danger; and the Knight perceiving as much; caused a pallat to be made for him in his own chamber, his life being so dear to him, that he would not trust the preservation thereof to any but himself. It was now well advanced in the night, and Cassianus not permitting Synesius to visit any of his patients, assuring him that Demetrius reposed, and that the other had need of nothing more then the rest, supper was called for, of which both they and Lysander fed but very sparingly, being full of thoughts both for what was become of Philocles , and who this Stranger should be that was so barbarously assaulted by such an unequal number. But committing the care of the one to the Gods, and doubting not in a short time to satisfie their curiosities concerning the other, for that night they retired to their several rests; only Synesius earnestly entreated Lysander , that he would not acquaint the Prince with the misfortune befallen to Philocles , lest so sad a mischance should cause an augmentation of his feaver. End of the first Book. THEOPHANIA. BOOK II. Synesius and his guests were so distracted with various thoughts, that they little enjoyed the benefit thereof. Himself calling to remembrance the several accidents that had befallen in so short a time, could not but make strange conjectures of the event, and the violence offered to Philocles was no small affliction; but above all, his imagination wrought most upon the adventure of the strange Knight; for sometimes he conceived he perfectly knew him, and then agen was as far from that conceit, as from the remembrance where that knowledge should begin. On the other side Demetrius , not heeding his disease, languished in the hopes of a future happiness, embracing a shadow instead of a substance, and sacrificing an ocean of tears to a Picture that was insensible of his complaints. But the Knight suffered agonies too great for any breast to contain but his, that was fortified with so much vertue: Yet that vertue was so violently assaulted with vehement passions, that the force thereof sometimes transported him into most bitter complaints; and at that time knowing none were neer but his faithful Squire Eruillius , he brake out in this manner. Wretch that thou art! wert thou only made great, to be exposed to the greatest of all miseries? Have the Gods that favoured thy birth with so much happiness, so soon forsaken thee? Or else to shew the infiniteness of their power, made such a sudden change in thy condition? Yet if they remain just, why have they chosen thee for a subject of their anger, that hast scarce lived days enough to commit sins answerable to their punishments? Or if the guilt lie in our family, and through a secret providence vengeance were reserved only to these times, have not the sufferings of my Royal parents yet satisfied your wrath? Will you still persecute them, and be nothing mercifull to me? Or if by destiny I were involved in the same fate, is it not enough that my infancie was exposed to all the barbarisms of a cruel war? That my daily passtimes were interrupted with mournfull spectacles of the blood and slaughter of my dearest friends? That I could never advance any but to certain ruine? And that those who were born to be my Subjects, use all manner of stratagems and force for my destruction? But to add to all these, and at once to cut off all possibilities of a future happiness, have you likewise deprived me of the divine Theophania? Heap afflictions upon my parents; deprive them of their Empire, and me of my succession; destroy my friends; let the designs of the people prevail against me; and besides those at home, raise up foreign Nations to be my enemies, so you restore to me agen that innocent Virgin. Let me enjoy her, and though the whole world oppose me, I shall not doubt to vanquish their malice. We were in our infancie bred together; and nothing could have separated us but a general ruine; and whensoever we meet agen it will I doubt not bring a general ruine to all our adversaries. Oh Theophania , if thou beest yet in the world, why doest thou not hear my complaints? and hearing them, find some means or other to afford me relief? Or if thou art retired to the mansion of the Gods, why doest thou not, by thy intercession, procure my deliverance from such a world of miseries? But I am assured thou livest; for otherwise my soul hath such a sympathie with thine, that it could not long remain behind: besides, immediately after thy birth, the Oracle declared to thy Nurse, who was curious to enquire after thy fate, that thou shouldst live to be the mother of many Kings; and if it were not for this assurance, I would with my own hands soon release it out of this vild prison, I would tear off these bands and swathes, and not suffer so many plaisters and medicines only to prolong a miserable life. Yes, yes, Thou livest, Theophania , and Alexandro lives to be thy Champion, who will not leave any part of the habitable world unsought for thee, and no corner or desert of the earth shall conceal thee from him, but in despight of all opposition he will at length place thee by him upon the Imperial throne of this Island, where we will triumph over the persecutors of Princes, and the Kings that descend from us shall remain a perpetual terror to their posterity. Ervillius , who besides the pain of his wounds, bore so great a part in his Masters sufferings, that he enjoyed but little rest, plainly overheard all that he said; yet knowing that the best way to asswage his passion, was, not to interrupt the course thereof, remained silent; and Alexandro , after infinite transportations both of grief and anger, his spirits being at length wasted, sleep seised upon his senses, giving some intermission to the anguish of his mind, and the cool distillations of the morning which then began to appear, yielding a general refreshment to mens bodies, Ervillius likewise fell into a sound repose. But if waking Alexandro endured all the torments of an afflicted mind, sleeping he enjoyed all the pleasures that imagination could afford: For, the Idea of her whom his heart adored, appeared to him in a more pefect shape then ever he had beheld her, and with a pleasing countenance approached neer to him, holding in her right hand a naked sword, and delivering it to him, said, The Gods, Alexandro , have destined me to be thine; and though I am now deteined from thee by the cruel persecutors both of my life and honour, with this thou must make thy way to me through a multitude of enemies. Whereupon immediately awaking, and having seised upon his own sword which stood ever ready drawn at his bed-side, seeing it in his hand, he believed it more then a dream, and began to cry out, Yes my Theophania , with this I will force my way to thee, and through a sea of our enemies blood swim to thy embraces. But as he uttered these speeches, his ears being strucken as from the next room with the heavenly sound of a most excellent harmonious voice, which he believed to be the very same of his Theophania , he began to be confirmed in the reality of the apparition; and lying quietly down agen upon his pillow as in a trance, was exceeding attentive, when to the ravishing touch of a Lute, with wonderfull admiration he heard these ensuing words.  Great Jove , in thee all power doth rest To make men wretched, or else blest; But in our selves it doth remain Our lives unspotted to maintain, And never yet a vertuous mind Though kingdoms have, hath ere declin'd. Then if my Love do live, To him this comfort give, That whilst our lives and hearts are pure Midst all our foes we're still secure. This ended, he lay still a while with his cheeks all bathed in tears; then gently raising himself, opened his arms to embrace her whom his fancie represented to him in the chief perfection of her beauty; but after he had recollected himself, finding he embraced nothing but empty air, and that it was only a meer illusion, he burst out agen into these bitter exclamations. Oh ye divine Powers! is the wretched Alexandro at length become your sport, that you thus delude his miseries with vain imaginations? Either direct me to a real fruition of her presence, or else in compassion free me from this languishing life, and armed with all your thunder at once destroy me in an instant. These last words proceeded from him with such a vehement shril voice, that Ervillius being wakened therewith, though with some difficulty, by reason of his wounds, rise to comfort him. But when he came to the bed-side, and saw such a strange alteration in his countenance, that he was scarcely to be known; his eyes, at so sad an object, overflowing with tears, Oh Prince, said he, will you thus by an obstinate perseverance in your griefs, destroy both your self, and all your hopes? Can the vertue of Alexandro so much fail as to doubt of the protection of the Gods, who so lately defended him from the fury of his enemies? Are not those bands and swathes testimonies against you of the care they have of your preservation? And your heart, if it be not at defiance with heaven, must it not needs confess it was providence guided the sword which made this wound in your arm, that otherwise might with more ease have clest that asunder. Alas my dear Ervillius , replied the Prince, how cunningly doest thou argue, to render me impious against those Divinities, which thou thinkst I do not with reverence enough adore? The Gods lay afflictions upon men, to make them sensible of their displeasure; and if they slight their punishments, think they contemn their power. Thou hast been a constant witness of all my sufferings; and if thou canst not deny they are beyond all examples of former ages, thou must needs confess my griefs ought to be so too, or else they come short of that sense which in piety I ought to have of them. But suppose my complaints have hitherto exceeded a mean, there are no expressions answerable to the present pangs I endure. The divine Theophania , through a charitable commiseration of my sufferings, came herself to encourage me to a generous fortitude, and on a sudden she was ravished agen out of my sight. I saw her here before me, she spoke to me, she directed me what I was to do, and with her heavenly voice raised my soul into such an extasie of joy, that I forgot all my former sufferings, but by the deprivation of that blessed object am now become far more miserable then ever. Whereupon sighs stoping his speech, after he had lain a good while silent, at length a torrent of tears issuing from his eyes, he remained such a spectacle of sorrow, as would have moved the most obdurate heart to pitty his condition; much more the gentle Ervillius who participated so much of his grief: For, all his former passionate transportations, to him, that was acquainted with them, seemed only the effects of an afflicted mind; but this was so transcendent, that it appeared little less then the extravagancie of a broken and disjointed understanding. Wherefore casting a pittifull regard upon him, and lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, as if at the same instant his heart had broke, sunk down breathless upon the bed. Which the Prince perceiving, and that the life so precious to him was ready to expire, he recollected himself from that profound trance, and endeavoured to give him all the assistance that he could; which doubtless had proved altogether vain, if immediately thereupon Cassianus , thinking it time to open their wounds, had not by chance entred into the chamber. But he was not a little surprised to find them in such a posture: Nevertheless presently calling the attendants to assist him, he laid Ervillius agen upon his own bed and giving him a little Cordial, which he ever had ready for all occasions, soon brought him to himself agen; and then whilst he had a little recovered his spirits, approaching to the Prince, by the motion of his pulse, conceived him to be possessed with a high feaver; but by that time he had dressed his wounds, the violence thereof was so much abated, that it appeared plainly to have proceeded from some other cause; wherefore without difficulty he permitted him, having thrown a night-gown over his shoulders, to rise, whilst Ervillius wound was opened, which he presently assured him was not at all dangerous in it self, though his feaver through some ill accident were a little increased. Which was such pleasing news to Alexandro , that he returned to his bed with so much satisfaction, that if Synesius and Lysander thinking it their duty, had not come to visit him, he might perhaps have refreshed himself with a little rest, after those violent agitations which he had suffered in the night. But the presence of that person from whom he had received so late an obligation was so grateful to him, that for the present he was diverted from all other thoughts, but how to make an acknowledgment equal to the benefit he had received. On the other side, Synesius, who though he surpassed all men in a general knowledg, and was likewise a most perfect Cavalier, yet in this encounter he was strucken with such an awe, that he could neither conceive expressions suitable, as he thought, to the person to whom they were to be addressed, nor yet express those conceptions which his heart prompted him to utter. Wherefore with great respect approaching to the bedside, as Alexandro put forth his arms to embrace him, he with wonderful submission kissed his hand; and then having fixed his eyes upon him said, Sir, in beholding you methinks I see somthing so far above me, that I am almost ready to pay you the same reverence that I would pay the Gods; but then I confess there is something in your countenance so familiar to my knowledge, that it inwardly checks those inclinations: Yet not being able to make any certain conjecture, when I consider your courage, and beauty, the rays of majesty that encompass you, and the actions which I have seen you perform, my Genius gives me an assurance that you have divinity about your person, and sayes, Synesius, thy life and fortunes are all too little to sacrifice to his service whom thou hast now the honour to harbor in thy house. Alexandro starting a little at that name, with a modest blush replied, Noble Synesius, if I were happy in the least of those perfections which you are pleased to attribute to me, I should perchance think the life you have preserved a fit Present for a person to whom I stand engaged upon so great an accompt: however I shall never fail in a due acknowledgment of those courtesies I have received from you, and hope you will never find a cause to repent that you have placed them upon so unworthy a subject. Whereupon Cassianus , who whilst they were in discourse had slipt out of the room to give a visit to Prince Demetrius , came smiling to Alexandro, and said, Sir, by what I had heard before I admired your valour, but now by experience I must applaud your skill in my own art, and, which those of our profession seldom do, yield to you as a much better Physitian then my self. The Prince not conceiving what he meant, with a pleased countenance answered, that he was as far from knowing any such good quality in himself, as from avowing the other. It may be so, Sir, replied Cassianus ; yet for ought I can perceive, notwithstanding the report these Gentlemen have made of your actions, you may with more ease recover a thousand men that are sick to their health, then kill one of your enemies; for that I evidently see is not without some expence of your own blood, but the mention of you only I find works miraculous cures. Whereupon the Prince desiring him to explain his meaning, he began in a more serious manner to tell him, that a stranger who through many sufferings at sea had been seised with such a violent feaver, that he believed many days must have passed before it was possible he should have been able to quit his bed, at the relation which Lysander had made of his magnanimous actions, was transported with such a passion to see the person that was master of so much vertue, that having quite forgotten his disease, no perswasions almost could detein him from coming to have the honour to kiss his hands; and though he could not truly say it was very safe for him to go out of his chamber, yet he absolutely was of opinion that it was far less dangerous then to debar him of a thing which with such ardencie he desired. Oh said Alexandro , smiling, I perceive it is not any thing in me, but Lysander who hath wrought the miracle; and indeed it is little less then a miracle, that so mean a subject should furnish matter for a discourse of such advantage to the author: but since his eloquence is so powerfull, I could wish it were employed amongst my enemies, for by the effects I easily suppose it would avail me more then an Army; and it is much more glorious by the force of words only to conquer mens affections; then by the sword and violence to triumph over their wils. Sir, replied Lysander , my life is an unworthy offering with devotion dedicated to your service; and though I am conscious of my own defects, yet I very well know that to a good subject Eloquence is as necessary a consequence, as harmony from an excellent Lute well tuned, though touched by an ordinary master: Nevertheless as those who have not a musical ear are not affected with the sound thereof, no more can any but generous spirits be transported with the relation of heroical actions. But the admirable sympathie which we see between two instruments set to the same note, that if you touch the strings of the one, the others will apparently move, the same is naturally between vertuous minds. Your selves therefore contain within your selves the cause of this wonder; and if either resist those motions which invite to a mutual band of amity betwixt you, that party must needs confess he enclines to a discord, and for the present doth a little fail of his vertue; which defect I dare not suppose on your side, in whose every part there is such a perfect harmony with the rest; and of the other you have heard with what earnestness he runs to your embraces. Neglect not then the proffered friendship of a stranger, which I will presume to say, if you knew some passages of his life, you would esteem worthy of your acceptance; and though he that saith so hath a neer relation to him, yet he is so far from flattery, that he dares avow even to your self, that he no less boasts that relation, then he admires your vertue. Having thus spoken, Alexandro made only this answer; That being bred a Souldier, he was so unaccustomed to such Courtships, that he knew not what reply to make to his civil expressions; and though he had many imperfections; yet to shew how ready he was to embrace the friendship of vertuous persons, he would presently prepare himself, if he might be permitted, to give his friend a visit. To which Synesius and Lysander , knowing with what impatience the Prince desired to see him, and that it would be dangerous for him to expose himself to the air, though unwillingly, seemed to consent; and whilst he put on his cloaths, withdrawing themselves to Ervillius his bed, gave him a kind of particular visit; and Cassianus , to prevent Demetrius lest he should rise, went to entertain him in the mean while with discourse. But Alexandro, who used little curiosity in adorning himself, made them not attend long; for being instantly ready, he put only a scarf about his neck to support his arm, and desired they would conduct him to the strangers lodging; who as they entred into the chamber, notwithstanding all the resistance Cassianus could make, would have risen out of his bed; yet perceiving company enter, he lay down agen: But when he saw Alexandro, who presently went to embrace him, instead of returning that civility, all his senses were on a sudden seised with so strange a stupidity; that falling backwards upon his pillow, he fixed his eyes upon him with such a ghastly countenance, that they all thought he was at the same instant yielding up the ghost. Whereupon the Prince, turning about to Lysander , cryed out, Is this sympathie, that produces such horrid effects! Oh Lysander , now confess thy error; and that he whom thou wouldst have flattered into a belief that he was more then man, is the vilest of all creatures, that only by his presence hath brought this direful calamity upon thy friend. But whilst he was speaking, Demetrius by degrees began to move his eyes; and raising his body, cryed out, Oh let me for ever gaze upon that glorious object! Some heavenly Deity in commiseration of the languishing Demetrius hath assumed that form, to restore him to a perfect happiness. When Alexandro once more approaching towards him, before he could speak, he proceeded; Disdain not, divine creature, a sacrifice of that heart which hath been so long devoted to thy service: Thy presence hath infused into me a new soul, and I already feel such an overflowing joy, that one pleasing look will enable me not only to overcome this trivial sicknes, but to vanquish even death it self. But Alexandro was so far from shewing any content in his looks, that on the contrary finding what Lysander had said too true, he had such a sympathie with him in his sufferings, that his cheeks were all bedewed with tears, to see so gallant a Youth so miserably oppressed, as he conceived, with the violence of his disease, believing all those strange expressions to be the extravagant ravings of a mortal feaver. Nevertheless desiring to pacifie him a little, if it were possible, he could not forbear to reply, Sir, whatsoever represents it self to your imagination, I suppose you do not know me; for till this hour to my remembrance I never had the happiness to see you, if it may be called a happiness to see one whom I have such strong inclinations to serve in so ill a condition. An ill condition, said Demetrius , when I hear such pleasing language from (the divine Mariana , he was about to say, but recollecting himself a little, after a short pause he continued) one whose very shape I am ready to adore, and whose vertue, by the relation I had heard of his glorious exploits, before I had the honour to see him, I admired, though now I do not at all wonder you should with your sword vanquish a few barbarous Assassins; for you strangely resemble, if you are not the same, a person, whose least regards are capable to subdue and triumph over whole Nations. There was still such a confusion in his speech, but withall such a connexion, that Alexandro nor the rest could not tell what judgment to make thereof, yet finding him much more composed, he began to comfort him in this manner. Noble Knight, I believe some providence hath directed me to this place, where I have met a Cavalier of such generous sentiments; and though there be nothing really in me worthy of your esteem, yet if I bear any resemblance that may render my service gratefull to you, I shall esteem this a most happy encounter; for you seem endued with all those perfections of a man, to whom I would willingly and with ambition give the name of Friend. I take you at your word, replied Demetrius ; and if you repent not your courteous offers, as ordinary civilities that you pass indifferently upon all, which I will not imagine, let me embrace that person whose friendship I would have purchased with my dearest blood. Whereupon they flew into each others arms with such a mutual concurrence of affection, that they seemed to breath their souls into each other bosoms. At which sight the standers by were moved with such a tenderness, that they could not refrain from tears; and the two Princes glorying in the acquisitions of their several vertues, by the cheerfulness of their countenances declared the inward content of their minds. Nevertheless on both sides there was something wanting to accomplish their felicity. The one, though his new friend spake the language perfectly, yet perceiving him to be a stranger, and by all appearances of eminent condition, infinitely desired to be perfectly informed both of his birth and country. And the other, the more he considered, the more still fancying within himself a resemblance to his souls Idol, the beautiful Mariana , could not longer have concealed his passion to know more particularly the owner of those rare perfections, if Alexandro preventing him, upon a sign Cassianus made, lest his spirits should suffer too much agitation, had not at the same instant began to take his leave of him for the present: But as he was going away, by chance saying, that there was nothing he desired more then a confirmation of their friendship by a better acquaintance; Demetrius taking hold thereof, and thinking it would conduce to his own satisfaction in the same kind, replied, That though his life afforded nothing remarkable, or worthy of his knowledg, yet he would willingly acquaint him not only with every particular passage thereof, but even with the most secret thoughts of his heart. Alexandro answered, Though he meant not then to have made that request, yet he embraced his offer as an exceeding obligation; and that when the Doctor should think it might be without prejudice of his health, he would challenge him of his promise. Whereupon Cassianus interposing, earnestly desired he would finish the three dayes with repose, before he strained himself too much either with discourse, or any other motion: Which being seconded by the entreaties of Alexandro , he promised that though he was then assured of his health, and that nothing could endanger it more then such a confinement from his presence, yet to shew an absolute obedience to his will, he would for the present submit to the Physitians: And to make the way more clear to compass his own desires, pretending it would put him to the blush to recount things so inconsiderable of himself, desired whilst he was under this restraint, that he would take the relation from Lysander . Which being agreed to on all sides, after a multitude of embraces, and infinite protestations of an eternal friendship, Alexandro attended by Synesius and the rest, retired agen to his own appartement, where they found Ervillius , having in their absence taken a little rest, in an apparent disposition of amendment. Prince Demetrius being thus left to himself, his fancy began to work upon a thousand several imaginations; and immediately taking the Tablet out of his bosom, when he had opened it, considering the several parts of that visage which was then before him, and calling to mind those of Alexandro's, after a strict survey of every lineament and feature, the complexion and proportion, he could observe no other difference, but that the hair was not so perfectly black, the symetry of the face not altogether so round, and the eyes, though of equal majesty, more inclined to sweetness; yet such an admirable resemblance in every part, that what he thought amiable in the one, he admired as excellent in the other. The one was the object of his affection, the other of his emulation; to the one he dedicated a pure flame of chaste love, to the other a loyal breast full of friendly inclinations, and to both an entire submission of his heart, where they reigned as victorious conquerors over all the faculties of his soul, yet their several Empires causing no civil dissentions in his breast. On the contrary he enjoyed such an absolute peace of mind for the present, that through the transportations thereof he fell into a gentle repose, which so refreshed his spirits, that Alexandro proved indeed the Physitian which restored him to his perfect health. In the mean while Synesius having commanded dinner to be prepared, caused Alexandro to be served alone in his Ante-chamber, yet he forced him by many entreaties to sit with him, whilst Lysander , impatient to know his Princes disposition after the late interview, returned agen to his appartement. There passed not much discourse between them at that time by reason of the attendants; but dinner being ended, they descended into the garden, where to avoid the heat, they retired into a square arched room, supported with marble pillars, and curiously paved with mosaicque work, built on purpose for coolness at the end of a large Canal, in the midst whereof was a Fountain that by an artificial conveyance cast forth an abundance of water like small rain, and caused a pleasing freshness in the air, which rendred the place exceeding delightful, even when the sun was at the highest. But before they were entred into any serious talk, Lysander came to them with news that his Prince was fallen into such a sound sleep, that he thought it was impossible to wake him. At which Alexandro and Synesius having expressed a great content, they desired him then, since the time and place were so convenient, to discharge the injunction that was laid upon him by Demetrius to communicate to them the passages of his life; which knowing he ought not to refuse, being seated, he began in this manner. discourse, when we were by a sudden accident interrupted; but not so far advanced therein, that I shall need to make any repetition; only I must renew my request, That the person whose actions I am to relate may not suffer through my want of expressions; for though I am able to give a faithful account of every particular passage, yet I cannot set them off with that advantage of language which should give them their proper lustre. However, not to transgress too much with an apologie, I shall without farther circumstance proceed. The Grecian Emperors having either by conquest or alliance gotten the possession of many large and spacious dominions, trusting in the vastness of their own power, so miserably oppressed their subjects with taxes and insupportable burthens, that they grew weary of their yoke: But above all, the people inhabiting the Islande and Provinces bordering upon the sea, though they were not subdued by the sword, but by a marriage with the rightful Princess thereof annexed to the Imperial crown, suffered such violation both of their laws and liberties, that being no longer able to support that tyrannical government, by a general consent they resolved to free themselves from so cruel a slavery; and having addressed their complaints to the renowned Polidor Prince of Achaia , chose him for their General, who in compassion undertaking their protection, by his great valour and wisdom not only delivered them from their oppressions, but established them a free State, which in short time grew so mighty, that it stood upon equal terms of defiance with the Emperor himself, and grew even a terror to all the neighbouring Nations. Which great successes rendred Polidor so beloved and popular, that the people were ready to deliver up agen into his hands that liberty, which with such eagerness they had pursued; and though he had not the title of King, he enjoyed in effect all the prerogatives and priviledges of Soveraignty. Besides, to shew their gratitude, in case he should dye, they declared his young son Demetrius the Prince my master, then an Infant, their General. Thus being in his cradle destined to the war, his Genius so suited to his destiny, that in his childhood his only passtimes were martial exercises; and when he had attained to the age of fourteen years, he always accompanied the Prince his father in the Army, where notwithstanding the care and diligence that was used to prevent him, he would many times go out upon occasions, and performed actions so far above his years, that they were the admiration of those that were about him. But lest this forwardness should at some time or other hazard him too far, the Prince, though he would not absolutely check his inclinations, thought fit to place some one of trust about his person that might have a care of his preservation; and though I was not then above nineteen years of age, he was pleased to repose that confidence in me, believing perhaps that being of noble birth, and not very much elder then himself, I might the easilier gain upon his affections as a companion, and by that means have a power to perswade him to any thing. Neither was the Prince deceived in his opinion: For I knew so well upon all occasions to manage his humour, that in a short time I was so much in his esteem, that he would do nothing either of recreation, or serious without me, but I could when I pleased with as much ease divert him from any rash design, as he was apt of himself to engage in any action of honour; and I have been so happy, that as he grew in years, the affection which he bore me then hath still more increased, insomuch that I have not only been privy to all the actions of his life, but I believe very few of his thoughts have been concealed from me. Two Summers passed in this manner, during which time he performed many gallant exploits upon the enemy, sometimes as a private person, and sometimes as chief of a considerable party. But the third Prince Polidor thinking it time to make the early vertue of his son known to the world, entrusted him with the command of an Army designed for the assistance of Philocles Prince of Thessaly , by the Emperor dispossessed of his Country: And though Philocles main Army, through a precipitate haste to fight, were unfortunately defeated before Demetrius could come to joyn with him, and himself forced to flie for safety, Hydaspes his brother, against whose advice he had engaged, having rallied about a thousand horse of the scattered Troops, before the Enemy was aware passed a river, and by diligent marching came safe to our Army, bringing himself the first certain news of his brothers defeat. This stoped Demetrius intended course, and made him immediately enter into councel what new design to go upon. Some would have continued their march to find out the Imperial army and to give them battel; but that was thought vain, because we were far inferior in number, and the Emperor by his late victory having cleered those parts, was marched to joyn in person with those Forces that were already sent against the Persians . Others proposed to take that advantage to make an inroad into Philocles Country, and to seise upon some strong places there: But that was rejected, because if they should take any, they could not spare Forces to man them, and so by consequence they would presently be lost again. When Demetrius having with attention heard all, said, No, let us neither follow an Enemy that marches away from us, nor lose time in taking of places that cannot be kept. The Emperor not supposing we have an army considerable enough to annoy his dominions, is gone towards the borders to prevent the invasion of the Persians by an invasive war; so that the way lies open before us even to Constantinople the chief City of the Empire; which though perhaps we shall not take, yet the attempt is glorious, and it is more honor to strike a terror into the heart, then to wound any other member. This proposition was generally applauded, not only as the gallantest, but as the wisest thing that could be undertaken. Wherefore the whole Army, which consisted not of above twenty thousand men, the word being given, immediately faced about, and by the encouragement of the General made such long marches, that in a short time, almost as soon as notice could be given of their approach, they were before the wals of Constantinople . If nothing were more attempted, Demetrius had already obtained his end; for his approach struck such a general terror not only into the inhabitants, but even amongst the Souldiers also, that they were ready to abandon the City, the Commanders with much difficulty perswading them to make any defence; neither had they been able to prevail over them, if Theodosia the Empress with her daughters had not gon from place to place themselves, to see the Ports secured. Where they saw any forwardness, animating them to the defence of their capital City, her self and Children, who were committed to their trust; and above all of their own honours, which would suffer with perpetual infamy, if the sight only of an inconsiderable Enemy should make them abandon their Country, their Emperor, who was then hazarding his life for their safeties, the dear pledges of his soul his Children, and the Temples of the Gods to a certain destruction. On the other side, where they found any neglect, reproaching their vile cowardise; That if they were not corrupted by the Enemy, they could not so basely betray the whole Nation; and that if they had but so much the hearts of men as to shew themselvs only, the very sight of their numbers would gain the victory: But since the Gods had deprived the Emperor of his son, they did well to deliver up his daughters to the mercy of strangers; for even women would disdain the subjection of so pusillanimous a people, and that it was far more honour for them to live in perpetual slavery, then to have the dominion of such treacherous subjects. These and the like speeches so wrought upon them, that partly through shame, partly through a sense of honour, they began to stand to their arms, and things being now in a reasonable posture of defence, she retired with her daughters to the Palace, where, besides the ordinary guards, all the chief Cavaliers and young Noblemen of the City assembled themselves for their defence. In the mean while Demetrius was not unmindful of his condition, That he was too far engaged in the Enemies country to make any long stay, having so small a force, lest the passage for his retreat should be cut off; besides the allarum being once given, the Emperor with his whole power would come upon him. But perceiving no Sallies to be made out of the City, imagining the true cause thereof, that his sudden approach had struck them with a panick fear, being informed by Emilius a principal Officer, who the year before had been prisoner in Constantinople, of the scituation of the place, with the several advenues and approaches, and that the Palace was a spacious building by it self, on the one side compassed in by the Sea, on the other separated from the City with strong wals and towers, and that part which lay exposed to the Campagne very well fortified in the same manner; The description agreed so in all points with the several Planes he had seen, that imagining he knew enough thereof, a little before Sun-set calling me to him, he said, Now, Lysander, is the time to make a trial of our valour, and either to dye gloriously, or to live with eternal fame. Whereupon communicating to me his whole design, I thought it an undertaking, though of wonderful hazard, yet nothing impossible; and withall of such infinite honour, that I could not but applaud the generosity of his resolution. Wherefore giving presently order that the Souldiers should refresh themselves, and repose till midnight, he divided the Army into two bodies, the one under the command of Hydaspes, and the other of Telamon his Lieutenant-General, appointing them at that houre, having left some horse to guard the baggage, to assault the City in two several places at once; and reserved to himself, for a particular service, only a thousand selected men, that were the eldest and most experienced Souldiers, which Emilius and my self chose out of the whole Army. Things thus disposed, he rid out himself with a small party of horse to view the wals; and being returned, commanding Emilius and me to draw out those thousand reserved men apart, coming to the head of them, made a short speech to this purpose. Fellow-souldiers, I have from my infancie been bred among you, being in my cradle destined to be your General; and to shew my self worthy of so great an honour, I would do something worthy of that birth which advanced me to it; wherefore amongst thousands of others I have made choice of your tryed valour to assist me in an enterprise, which is not more full of danger then of glory, in which we will be all equal sharers, and if you stand firm to me, both vanquish the one, and triumph with the other. Remember only that when I lead you on, I commit my honour into your hands: therefore whosoever is not a friend to Demetrius honour, let him with leave depart; and to those who undertake the prorection of that, Demetrius here in the presence of the Gods dedicates both his life and fortunes. There was none so meanly spirited as to relinquish his General in a personal occasion; but all cried out with one voice, Demetrius honour is his Souldiers glory . Wherefore having thanked them for their forwardness, he presently divided them into two bodies, and giving the conduct of the one to Emilius , led the other himself, commanding me, as I always did, to accompany him. The night being very dark, was exceeding favorable to our design; for by the help thereof, marching with a wonderful silence, we passed quite beyond the City till we came under the Palace-wals without being discovered by any of their Sentinels, and lay close there for almost the space of an hour under the covert of a thick Wood; but the time being come that the assault was to be given, by reason of the silence of the night, we plainly heard the beating of the drums, accompanied with a great shout, by which we knew our men were engaged, who on both sides made a furious onset; and though Telamon's after a fierce contestation were at length repulsed, Hydaspes shewed such an example of courage to his men, with a pike in his hand, himself first mounting upon the ladders, that being seconded by Philander and Drusilius , two eminent Commanders, they forced the Enemy with great slaughter to retire, and possessed themselves of one of the Towers; which being secured, they advanced, notwithstanding all resistance, to the gate, and having killed most of the guards, letting fall the bridge, made an easie entrance for Telamon with all his Forces. This gave so hot an allarum, a general cry runing through the City, that all was lost; that the Cavaliers who were in the Palace thinking all secure on that side, leaving none there but the guards, hasted to the place from whence the chief allarum came, and so encouraged the Souldiers, that they rallied their forces, and began to make a strong resistance; but by reason of the darkness not distinguishing enemies from friends, miserably slew and oppressed one another: And there was now such a confused cry in the City, that Demetrius thought the time no longer to be delayed; but having commanded his men to put their shirts above their arms, himself and the Officers wearing white scarfs, they began to fasten the ladders in several places, which could not be so done, but the Sentinels took an allarum; nevertheless Demetrius covering himself with his shield, went on first himself to the assault, and was followed with such an unanimous consent of the souldiers, that we were upon the wals almost as soon as the enemy; yet there we encountred so strong an opposition, that our men began to fall back: whereupon the Prince crying out to them, Will you thus betray the honour committed to your trust? remembring their promise, they were animated with such a courage, that they not only possessed themselves of the walls, but forced the Imperialists to retreat, yet in so good order, that if Demetrius had not performed actions above the strength of man, we had all certainly perished; but he made such way with his sword, killing all about him which made any resistance, that we advanced into a large open place, where our men had room to exercise their valour, which was so well employed, that divers casting down their weapons cryed out for mercy, and the rest paid the forfeiture of their obstinacie with their lives; insomuch that having seised upon the gates, especially those towards the Sea, and placed strong guards about them, we became absolute masters of the Palace. This attempt was so unexpected, and the execution so sudden, that the Empress, by the information that was given her on all sides, finding into what a straight she was reduced, and to escape impossible, she took a resolution suitable to the dignity of so great a Princess; every thing, as we heard since by certain prisoners, being ordered by her directions: For not to shew any apprehension of danger, having commanded all the gates and doors that led to her appartement, to be set wide open, she prepared to entertain her sufferings, or if the worst should happen, even death it self, with as much majesty and glory, as if she had been to receive the Emperor returning triumphant with all the spoils of the Persian Monarchy. On the other side Demetrius , having secured the Ports, though he intended no violence, meant to shew himself as a Conqueror: Therefore giving a strict command that none upon pain of death should follow him save Emilius and my self, with two Gentlemen more, he went presently towards the Empress quarter, whither he was directed by an infinite number of lights that appeared both before the gate, and in the windows of the Palace, and approaching neerer we found a guard of Halbardiers, every one with a great white Torch lighted in his hand, who at first we expected would have made some resistance, but they were so far from offering any violence, that neither using motion nor speech, they stood orderly in two ranks from the entry of the gate, through a great hall, and so up the stairs into another room, as if they had been liveless Statues. Nevertheless seeing so many armed men, and yet such an open passage, the Prince made a little stop, as thinking some treachery might be intended: But then supposing they durst not attempt any such thing, or else having a courage above all fear, he passed through them into the hall, which was a spacious arched room, supported with two rows of pillars of white marble, with the walls and pavement of the same; then ascending a large stair, which was likewise of white marble, with a rail and balluster of Porphyrie, adorned at the bottom with two Lyons, and on the top with two figures representing Justice and Fortitude, we entred into another great Hall beautified with Statues round about it in niches, the rest embellish'd with marbles of several colours curiously carved with a large border of Frutage, and the Roof richly gilt and embossed. Then having the Guards still on each hand of us to the next room, for they reached no further, we passed through another paved with Mosaique work, and adorned with the pictures of all the Grecian Emperors, drawn by the most excellent Masters of their several times, in which were divers Pages and Attendants, who seeming to take no notice of us, we went on into another room that was hanged with Tapestry, besides the rarity of the workmanship richly set off with gold and silver, which by the reflection of the lights appeared in great abundance. At the upper end, under a State of wonderful rich Embroidery, stood a Chair upon an ascent covered with Persian Carpers; and upon seats that were placed round about the wals, sate divers persons of several ages, by ther habits and presence appearing to be the most eminent Councellors or Officers of the Empire; and those which sate uppermost, being very aged, with long beards as white as snow, bore such a reverend aspect, that if their sad dejected countenances had not shewed them subject to humane passions, they would have appeared more then mortal. Yet seeing them remain without motion, not so much as casting an eye upon us, in so profound a silence, I could not, for my part, but call to mind the strange stories of enchanted Castles which we read of in Romances. But as we advanced further, our wonder still encreased; for the next Room that lay open before us, was so richly furnished, that it seemed the wealth of a whole Nation amassed together in that place; and the company was suitable to the richness of the furniture; An assembly of Ladies of such rare beauty, and withall so gloriously apparelled and adorned with jewels, that the whole world could not afford the like spectacle, though the riches and state of that Court made it usual there. And this disorder happening before they were retired to their rest, they were not devested of those ornaments. Nevertheless there was such a silent sadness amongst them, as at once represented to our considerations, in the pride of those luxuries, the glory of all earthly happiness, and the uncertain content those glories afford our minds. Insomuch that the Prince seised with a kind of admiration, turning the point of his sword to the ground, made a little stand, looking about to whom he should address himself; but perceiving that none of them would vouchsafe so much as the least regard, seeing yet another door open, he boldly stept in. But if before he were seised with admiration, he was now in an instant struck with an astonishment: If before he saw none but dejected countenances that seemed to submit to him as a Conqueror, he now beheld such transcendent beauties, armed with so magnanimous a fortitude, that himself was ready to fall prostrate at their feet, to crave the pardon of his bold intrusion: For at the upper end of the room, from the ceeling whereof hung about forty Branches of Chrystal with white Tapers, upon an ascent of some half a dozen steps sate the Empress alone under a State, with an Imperial Crown placed by her upon a Cushion of Crimson-velvet; and besides those Diamonds in a kind of Coronet upon her head, having so many Jewels besides of an inestimable value about her, that with the reflexion of the lights her least motion seemed to dart forth flames of fire. At a little distance on her right hand but a step lower, sate the young Princess Mariana, eldest daughter to King Antiochus , who you know upon the peace made between the two crowns, being sent a child into Greece , became the contracted wife of Leonides, the Emperors only son, though before the marriage was consummate he dyed sudenly of an Apoplexie, and at that time she was not returned back agen into Sicily ; but, by reason of her widowhood she was then cloathed in a long garment of black after the Grecian fashion, with wide sleeves that touched the ground, her neck bare, and on her head a light Vail that shadowed a little her face, but hid no part of it, and without any other ornaments besides, save only those of nature, with which she was so plentifully stored, that her beauty was the admiration of the whole Empire. On the other hand but a step lower then that, and at a farther distance, sate the Emperors two daughters Doriclea and Clarinda magnificently habited according to their birth, not being inferior to one another in perfections, and surpassing all others except only the incomparable Mariana . The Empress in her countenance expressed a majestick gravity, accompanied with an undaunted mind; Mariana a cheerfull sweetness, as secured by her own beauty against the violence of fortune; and the two Princesses a noble disdain of their present condition; but Doriclea a severity enclined to revenge; Clarinda a mildness apt to pardon her enemies; and all in beholding Demetrius , began to be so far from apprehending the tyrannie of a cruel enemy, that they rather believed some divine assistance was sent them by the Gods. On the other side Demetrius viewing their several perfections, especially those of the accomplished Mariana , began to feel that courage which had never failed him in so many encounters amidst a multitude of enemies, to yield at the very first summons of two fair Eyes: yet remembring where he was, and how little time, perhaps, he had to spare, with great submission approaching to the degrees, kissed the hem of the Empress garment, and casting such glances upon Mariana , that she might easily imagine his speech was directed chiefly to her, said, Madam, I find the rashness of my youth hath precipitated me into an action of so much violence, that my guilt is little less then theirs, who impioufly assaulted the sacred mansions of the Gods; and if armed with their anger, you pronounce against me the heavy sentence of your just displeasure, there will need no mountains, my own afflictions will be enough to overwhelm and press me down even to the very center of the earth. Therefore consider, most excellent Princess, looking stedfastly upon Theodosia , that He who stands here a supplicant is Demetrius the son of Polidor a professed enemy, who very well knows, that if he should lay desolate this noble City, and bury in its own ruines the remembrance of this Imperial palace, the laws of arms and of nations would not only justifie the act, but render him a noble fame to posterity that was the author of so great an exploict. Then casting his eyes agen upon Mariana ; Yet I confess there is a divinity about your person which is above all humane laws; and my valour, since it hath offended you, I account a crime, in expiation whereof I offer my life a sacrifice, if that may satisfie for so great an offence. Here is my sword, laying it at her feet, the instrument of my transgression, with which if you please you may exercise upon this breast that cruelty which you expected from it. Mariana either perceiving the conquest her beauty had made, or moved through her natural mildness, cast a smiling look upon the Prince: But Theodosia , to whom his speech seemed only addressed, rising from her seat, with a wonderful gravity replied, Noble Demetrius, To conquer is the effect of a daring courage, common to beasts, and men of a savage nature; but such a generosity of mind, is a particular endowment of the Gods: Against the one I was armed with a resolution above the malice of fortune; but to the other I submit a willing Captive, and here deliver up my self, and these Princesses the daughters of the invincible Andronicus into your power. I need not exhort you to make a noble use of your victory, but let not your success make you too secure: Our honours are now in your protection; and be not less active in the preservation of them, then you were by enthralling our persons to advance your own fame. The Souldiers and Inhabitants, though surprised with the terror of a nightly assault, may yet again, as day appears, make head against your Forces, and in that confusion both expose this City to the hazard of perishing in its own flames, and us all to the violences of an incensed enemy: Or if by the chance of war, or their multitudes they should prevail, be assured, they who have so basely defended their own and their Countries safety, will exercise a barbarous tyrannie over those they reduce into their power; for Cowards have naturally cruel inclinations, and it would grieve me more to see so much vertue suffer, then to see a whole nation of such pusillanimous people led into perpetual slavery. Therefore reassume your sword, and consider that Demetrius though environed with a victorious Army, is less safe in Constantinople , then Theodosia and these Princesses in the sole protection of the generous Demetrius . As the Empress was thus speaking, some of the Souldiers, notwithstanding the command to the contrary, knowing how much both their own safety and the Princes honour was concerned, came runing into the room, giving an allarum that the enemy attempted the recovery of the Palace, and came on so furiously, that the men wanting his presence, began to be disheartened, and were no longer able to withstand the fierceness of the assault. Wherefore the Prince taking his sword in his hand, said, I must go, Madam, whither the conservation, as you confess, of your own honour cals me, and armed with your authority shall soon appease this fury of my enemies. But as he was going away, the Empress taking a Diamond of an unseen bigness and lustre from her finger, said, You might if you pleased seise upon that, pointing at the Crown, as the price of your valour, or carry us after you in chains as witnesses of your conquest; but since you refuse such trophies, and are pleased that I shall still retain my dignity, being still an Empress, I will enjoin you to wear this as a testimony of my gratitude. Which having accepted with great reverence, turning about he cast a languishing regard upon the Princess Mariana , and immediately hasted to encourage his men in this unexpected assault; leaving behind him no less an admiration both of his beauty, youth and person, then of his unparallell'd generosity to the wife and children of his greatest, and so powerful an enemy. But his return to his Souldiers was so seasonable, that at the same time they were ready to give way to the assailants, but reanimated with his presence, on the contrary forced them to retire: Wherefore intending a fair composition, and an honorable retreat, he sounded a Parley, and went himself to the battlements to declare his intentions were not to use any farther violence, but without any the least damage to quit the City. When day beginning to appear, though so as things were scarcely distinguishable, he perceived by the Ensigns that he was attacqued by Hydaspes forces: wherefore he only cryed out to them, Tell Prince Hydaspes , who hath gallantly forced his way thus far, that Demetrius is advanced hither to meet him, and will immediately set open the gates to receive so noble a friend. Whereupon his voice being known by some of the principal Officers, there was an unspeakable joy amongst them all, which when they met was expressed by a general shout and acclamations on either side; and the Princes having embraced, Demetrius, though his heart returned into the Palace, thinking it necessary for the preservation of the Army to unite his forces, marched towards the chief Market place, which Hydaspes told him Telamon had possessed, and that thereupon he was advanced with three thousand men to attempt the Palace, which they conceived had still held out. But as he was marching away, turning about to behold those walls that enclosed his incomparable Mariana , a Damsel of a most exquisite beauty, having a small Casket under her arm, in the habit of a slave, came running towards him, and almost breathless, with her cheeks bathed in tears, prostrating herself at his feet, besought him by the love he bore to vertue, by the reverence he ought the Gods, and as he was desirous by their protection to obtain a noble fame, to take compassion on the sufferings of a distressed Captive, who amongst many other grievous calamities was at length reduced to an ignominious slavery, and had no hope of freedom, but by the generosity of so noble a Prince. Demetrius was not a little surprised at so wonderful an object; for such a dazeling beauty appeared through that cloud of sorrow, that he thought he never beheld any thing more excellent, but his most excellent Mariana . Wherefore raising her gently from the ground, he assured her if the hazard of his dearest blood could contribute any thing to her repose, she might give an intermission to her griefs; for when he once understood what way he might afford her relief, he should not think any enterprise impossible in the assistance of so rare a creature; and that in the mean while she might rest secure upon his word, that he would sooner transgress the sacred ordinances of the divine powers, then suffer any violence to approach her person. Wherewith seeming a little comforted, she said, Upon that noble pawn I deliver my self and honour into your protection; and that preserved, dispose of this miserable life as you please. Then immediately calling me to him, Here Lysander , said he, I dare trust to thee my own life, and in that confidence commit to thy care, till these disorders are a little over, the safeguard of this excellent Maid, whose preservation I charge thee to be as tender of, as thou wouldst be of mine or thine own honour. I confess I was not a little pleased with so worthy a charge: Therefore with great submission approaching to her, she rested her hand upon my arm, and we continued our march towards that quarter where Telamon lay with the rest of the army. But when we came to the market place, we sound him engaged in a hot conflict with the enemy, who when the day approached rallied their forces, and made a gallant attempt to recover their lost city, and indeed had forced Telamon to give ground; but when they saw a fresh supply come to him, their hearts absolutely failed them, and casting away their weapons, they yielded at discretion to our mercy. Whereupon Demetrius instantly commanding all actions of hostility to cease, called for the Governor, who being brought into his presence, he spake to him in this manner. I believe no neglect of yours hath caused the surprisal of this noble City; you appear a person worthy so great a trust as the command of that place which is the residence of the Empress Theodosia and those excellent Princesses her daughters; therefore into your hands I deliver it agen; there shall no violence be offered to the inhabitants, nor to any thing that belongs to them: And all that I require of you is, That you tell Andronicus the Emperor, from Demetrius the son of Polidor his mortal enemy, that he could as easily and with more justice have laid desolate this metropolitan City, than he deteins the Country and patrimonial inheritance of Prince. Philocles: but if he continue his oppression, that we now know the way to Constantinople , and in his own Palace shall force him to a due surrender, or bury him in the ruines of it. Then, not suffering any reply, looking back once more upon the Palace, and sighing to himself the name of Mariana , he immediately gave the word to march; and having appointed a chariot for the stranger Captive, commanding her to be attended with all manner of observance, in a short time we arrived at Sparta the capital City of the United Provinces, where Demetrius was recived with a general applause and acclamations both by the States and common people, but especially by Polidor , who gloried more in this one exploict of his son, then in all the actions of his own life. Insomuch that if being deprived of the presence of the incomparable Mariana , he had been capable of any content, he might have enjoyed a perfect felicity; but he was so far from esteeming his condition happy, that he believed himself the most miserable man living. Nevertheless his afflictions made him not forget his respects to the stranger Virgin; but having, according to her desire, placed her in a private condition with the Queen of Macedon mother to Philocles , who being driven out of her own country lived there retired, she received from her, being a Lady of incomparable goodness and humanity towards strangers, such extraordinary demonstrations of kindness, that though her griefs were so pressing, that they were not to be forgotten, nevertheless she found some relaxation for them at the present; yet Demetrius could find no intermission of his own, but on the contrary by unexpected accidents was so traversed in the designs of his new affection, that he grew almost desperate of any future happiness. Lysander had continued his discourse, but that a servant came in haste to give notice that the Prince being awake called for him, and would not be satisfied but with his presence. Wherefore Alexandro giving him many thanks for what he had already related, and expressing an impatience to hear the rest, they all returned together into the house, and would have visited Demetrius , but that the Physitian entreated them, though he were strangely amended, to forbear till the next day; and only Lysander , being alwayes about him, was permitted to enter into the chamber. So that Alexandro passing the rest of the evening alone with Synesius , he entertained him with such excellent discourse, that he was wonderfully satisfied with his company; and at length, though it grew late, very unwillingly parted from him. End of the Second Book. THEOPHANIA. BOOK III. retire from his griefs: When he was alone, they came pressing upon him in multitudes, and now brought with them a new companion, the noble sense of Demetrius sufferings in the languishments of an uncertain affection: but then reflecting upon the gallantry of his actions, the assured acquisition of so generous a friendship afforded some little refreshment to his sorrows. On the other side Demetrius , though he found a perfect intermission of his feaver, his wonder still continued at the height in contemplation of those admirable objects of his souls chief felicity, those Twins of beauty and honour, the most beautiful chaste Mariana, and the no less accomplished valiant Alexandro . Insomuch that when day was come, having called to him Lysander , who lay in the same room; Behold, said he, Lysander , the lively representation of all earthly perfections, the Model of Mariana's beauty, and the Epitome of that noble Strangers accomplishments; And wonder not it bears so great a resemblance to both, for such singular excellencies cannot but be of neer affinity. Whereupon, as he was continuing, one knocking softly, interrupted his speech, and Lysander having opened the dore, he was not at all displeased to be so interrupted when he saw Alexandro enter, who through an impatient desire to establish their new commenced friendship, having only cast a nightgown about him, came to his chamber, and without any ceremony approaching to the bed- side, having embraced him, said, Most generous Prince! my inclinations to confirm an everlasting league of amity between us can no longer comply with these ceremonious delays of Cassianus: If you are still in that state, as he, perhaps only to set an esteem upon his art, would have us think, I come to assist you with my service; or if you find an amendment in your self, to enjoy your conversation; for to a sick man there is no such comfortable cordial, nor to one in health any companion more grateful then a perfect friend: and if you honour me with such an esteem, which I cannot doubt from Demetrius who shewed such an example of generosity to his greatest enemies, I am sure in any condition I shall be welcome to him. Welcome, replied the Prince, As glorious victory to a Souldier; As deliverance from a violent Ravisher to a chaste Virgin; As any noble occasion of action to a vertuous mind; As the fruition of your own dearest wishes to your self; Or as one gracious regard, or the heavenly presence of the divine Mariana would be to the languishing Demetrius . The report of your valour bred in me an impatient desire to see you: Seeing you, that valour was so communicative, that at the very first view it infused into me a vigor to encounter the terrible assaults of death; and now by the confirmation of your friendship I am restored to such a degree of strength, that it assures me the victory over that cruel enemy. Alexandro was about to answer in terms answerable to these high Encomiums: but Synesius and Cassianus at the same time coming into the room, he had only time to say, I am glad to be thus happily prevented in a reply that would come as far short of the zealous intentions of my heart, as my now limited power is of the vast desires I have to serve you; but let Prince Demetrius rest assured, he hath besides his owh vertues such powerful advocates with the Princess Mariana, that he cannot be more constant to his friend, then the Gods have ordained him to be successful in his love. Then kissing him on the cheek, and with a strait embrace testifying something more of kindness then was yet expressed, he rose to entertain the company, leaving Demetrius in a strange perplexity to comprehend the meaning of his ambiguous speeches, for he could not imagine who should be that happy mediator of his love to his adored Princess. Nevertheless at that time he had not leisure to let his imagination work; for Synesius came to congratulate his unexpected amendment, and Cassianus to perswade him, if it were possible, not to stir that day out of his bed; but all he could obtain, though assisted by the company, was, that he would not go out of his chamber, which Alexandro pressed the more earnestly, that he might have the better opportunity to hear the rest of Lysanders relation: wherefore desiring him and Synesius to meet him presently in the garden, he returned with Cassianus to his own appartement, that his wound being drest he might prepare himself for that entertainment; and Synesius staying behind, not thinking it sit any longer to conceal the accident befallen to Philocles , acquainted the Prince with every particular that had happened, at which he expressed a wonderful discontent; yet being something appeased by Synesius with the hopes that they should suddenly have certain news of him, it was agreed amongst them that no mention thereof should be made to the Stranger. And Lysander having by this time cloathed himself, with Demetrius leave they went immediately according to their appointment into the garden, where they were no sooner entred into a shady walk, but in an Arbor close by a pleasant Fountain they found Alexandro, which being a convenient place, without going any farther they took their seats, and Lysander proceeded in his discourse. Theatre of the world; but the Scene is already changed, and as you beheld him at Constantinople victorious amongst his enemies, you must now look upon him as a submiss Captive paying myriads of tributary sighs and tears to an emperious Beauty; by his patient sufferance, and constant perseverance, by his many resolute undertakings and an undaunted resistance to all oppositions, giving unpatterned testimonies of an incomparable Lover. After he had received the several congratulations of his friends, and taken order to dispose his Souldiers into quarters, the visits of ceremony being past, his first care was, having commanded me only to wait upon him, to give one in particular to the stranger-Virgin; and entring one morning into her chamber, he found her sitting by a table, whereon stood a small Casket open full of Jewels of an infinite price: but she was so far from taking delight in such a treasure, that on the contrary beholding it, her eyes overflowed with teares, which trickling apace down her cheeks seemed to outvie in value those oriental pearls and sparkling diamonds that lay before her, and every succeeding tear to contend for bigness and lustre with the former. Never was such a spectacle of sorrow, nor ever sorrow which shewed so lovely as in the mansion of that heavenly face, her griefs seeming rather a divine compassion of humane sufferings, then the cruel oppressors of an afflicted mind subject to mortal passions. Wherefore being seised with an awful reverence, he began to retire; but she having spied him, cryed out, Oh generous Prince, slie not from the miserablest creature living; my griefs are not infectious; on the contrary when you know the cause of them for the present, armed with a noble anger, you will take a just revenge upon her who hath sullied the lustre of all your glories. You undertook my defence, being a desolate stranger; by your charity I enjoy the protection of this vertuous Queen; and which is above all, you have preserved my honor inviolate: In recompence whereof I have stained your noble fame, made you appear a violator of your word, and your whole Army a rude multitude not subject to warlike discipline For though through an heroick generosity you not only restored the Empress, and the Princesses her daughters to their liberty, but at the same time made them a present of their City, with an entire restitution of the wealth thereof; and though your orders were so punctually observed by the souldiers, that not any of the inhabitants could complain of the least loss, nevertheless miserable I, who ought to have obeyed you more then all the rest, by a fatal misprision, contrary to your express command, committed a violence in that place which you esteemed most sacred, even in the Palace it self, from whence I brought that mass of wealth which you see there before you, belonging as I suppose formerly to young Leonides the Emperors only son, but by his death in the possession of the most excellent Princess Mariana, amongst which there is a Tablet enchased with the Characters of her name, that bears the value of a Princes ransom, but contains within a far greater treasure, her own picture drawn by that famous Limner Pecorus , who hath so happily encountred every feature and lineament of her face, that beholding it, I think she herself is present, reproaching the monstrousness of my crime, which hath given occasion of so vile a scandal, that either Demetrius was not careful of his word, or else his Souldiers through a base avarice slighting their Generals command, sought rather a prise of wealth then fame: For none will suppose me guilty of such an act, but rather a part of the prey; and though you perhaps may contemn so mean a satisfaction as this unworthy life, yet when the Souldiers shall know how much I have injured your vertue and their own, their just rage can never be appeased but by my blood, which I shall willingly offer in expiation of my offence. Nevertheless I will not be so treacherous to my own innocence, as to acknowledge a wilful guilt: This is but one amongst infinite other misfortunes, to which my whole life hath been exposed; yet a greater malice of fortune then any of the rest, that not content to have brought me into the miserable rank of slaves, she would likewise make me seem to participate of their nature, who because they are forced to serve, seldom prove faithful. But the Grecian Admiral who first made me a prisoner was more favorable; for he, I must ever confess, used me nobly, and took nothing from me but my liberty; which he would in some measure seem to restore, when at his arrival in Constantinople he bestowed me upon the Princess Mariana, with whom I remained, till you by a gallant attempt became master of that City: And though I cannot but extol the favourable usage I received from the Princess, yet the natural desire of liberty, and to return into my own country, made me flie to you for refuge, who by such an unpatterned unparallel'd generosity had so lately enfranchised even the Empress herself with all the Royal family, and the Princess to whom I was a servant. Wherefore taking the opportunity of the confusion that was then in the Palace, hasting to my Mistress Cabinet, where none having such free access as my self, I had hid a small Casket which contained all my poor treasure, through haste, being in the dark, and both of them of the same size and proportion, I brought away this instead of my own, which at first, without considering it at all, I delivered to Lysanders care; at the same time you were pleased to commit to him likewise the protection of my person, and he by reason of his many imployments having restored it to me agen but the last night, I did not till then know the error of my mistake, by which I have robbed the Princess of all her chiefest jewels; and though I have left some behind in my own Casket of value considerable enough, yet she will be no more satisfied with the exchange, then I am with my self for having committed so great a folly, by which I have not only offended so gracious a Princess, and left in their place things that I valued far above my own life, but which more afflicts me, trespassed against the honour of that person to whom I owe the preservation of my own; and I am so miserable, that it is not in my power in the least degree to repair the injury, much less to make a due satisfaction on either side: Therefore laying my life at your feet, I desire you will be pleased to take these into your disposal, for of right they belong to you; and it is in your power, by restoring them to the Princess, both to vindicate your Army from a foul aspersion, and me from the blame of a premeditated malice. The Prince was exceeding attentive to this discourse; but at the mention of Marianas Picture, so transported at once both with a sudden joy, and a passionate desire to be possessed of that dear jewel of his life, that he could scarcely forbear to discover the inward inclinations of his heart; yet containing himself as much as was possible within the bounds of a moderate temper, replied, Most excellent Virgin, though both your name and quality lie concealed under your misfortunes, yet your perfections are so eminent, that they abundantly testifie the excellencie of the person to whom they belong: And I am so far from supposing you have in the least degree injured me, or my souldiers, that on the contrary I believe they owe their success to your cause, some supreme power having directed me to lead them on to that enterprise only for your deliverance: Neither do I imagine any wrong done to the Princess Mariana ; for thus to restore those trifles, is far more justice, then not to have brought them away. Therefore I may presume to say, your griefs are unseasonable; unless as our great Heros wept when there were no more worlds to conquer, you likewise lament because it is not in your power to exercise a greater vertue. But remember, his insatiable desire of honour was imputed to him as an ambition too great for any mortal creature: And either you must confess your self what indeed you resemble, a Divinity, or else remaining unsatisfied with the admirable effects your vertues have already produced, be content to submit to the same censure. However, since the deteining of those things seems such a burden to your mind, if you please to trust me with them, I shall not only take care to send them back, but that your own may be restored to you agen: For though I believe the Princess Mariana infinitely regret your loss, yet I cannot imagine, though it were in her power, that she would refuse to enfranchise that person, of whom the Gods seem to have no less a care then of herself; much less keep from you those Jewels, which a conquering Enemy thought a sacriledge to make his prise. Whereupon immediately delivering the Casket, she besought him by many conjurations to obtain a pardon of the Princess for her fugitive slave Irene: And until she could find a fit opportunity to return into her own Country, that she might still remain in the same condition; assuring him, that though for many reasons she desired not to be farther known, yet neither her birth was so mean, nor her alliance so inconsiderable, that either he needed to shame at, or repent those charitable offices, which through a generous compassion he used to an afflicted stranger, by destinie cast into his protection. No, I can no more, said the Prince, repent those poor services I am able to render you, then yourself can conceal those excellencies, which require a strict obedience to all your commands. But the same power you have over others, exercise, in some degree, upon your self, and suffer not sorrow to tyrannize over that beauty which hath so absolute a dominion over all the world besides. I would not say I leave you to your griefs, but in a disposition to vanquish them; at least permit me to hope, that when I have the honour to see you next, I may congratulate with you for that happy victory. Whereupon taking his leave, he immediately returned to the Court to his own appartement; and being retired alone into his Cabinet, you may easily imagine with what an excess of joy he beheld the Idea of that face which was already so engraven in his heart, that it was not capable of any other content. But then considering how he was engaged by promise to part with a Jewel so precious to him, he began to exclaim against the severe laws of Honour, as injurious to those of Love: yet not willing to transgress either, his fancie wrought upon a thousand several inventions how to satisfie both; but finding no better expedient, at length after some few days respite he resolved, though then unknown to me, to keep the Picture as in a complement, for he durst not presume to avow his love, and to send the rest back by Mercurio a Sicilian gentleman of an approved fidelity, who being of a Nation in league with the Empire, especially as employed to the Princess Mariana , might without difficulty pass through the Enemies country. Wherefore having given him sufficient instructions, he secretly dispatched him away with a Letter, which I have seen since, and was as I remember to this effect. sent back a Casket which through a mistake she brought away with her; yet can never cease from tears, till you both confirm a grant of her liberty, and a remission of that unwilling offence, which she still laments as a crime of the highest nature, but I applaud as a particular favor of the Gods to render me possessor of a shadow of that Beauty which preserved the Imperial City of Constantinople from destruction, and redeemed the Empress Theodosia with her daughters from captivity; for it was not any inherent vertue in the Conquerors, but the powerful operation of your heavenly eys, which changed the savage customs of war to so contrary a proceeding with a professed enemy: Therefore I will henceforth keep it to preserve me from all future dangers; and unless you wish his ruine who offers daily sacrifices for your preservation, you will not disdain the wearing of so glorious a favor by your Captive Demetrius He conceived some hopes, if Mariana answered this Letter, he should discover something of her inclinations, or at least open a way to the farther declaration of his love. But whilst he pleased himself with these thoughts, there were countermines a working, which turned his hopes even into despair; and though he found difficulties enough before, interposed almost impossibilities to encounter. For Polidor , when he saw he had a son worthy to succeed him in his honours, not content with a small Principality, his patrimonial inheritance, nor with the great power he enjoyed in the new Commonwealth of the Revolted Provinces, as Generalissimo, and chief in all their Councels; but believing what he had gained with his own sword, by the same right, of due belonged not to any other, had long entertained a secret design to bring them likewise into his subjection, and either by a popular carriage to induce them to a voluntary resignation of their liberty, or else by a foreign alliance to awe them with his power. Neither wanted he abettors, even amongst the States themselves, who either through a grateful consideration of his merit, or else for their own interests, sought to advance his. But above all, the Princess Salmona his wife, a Lady of an aspiring mind, yet no less prudent in all her actions, and exceedingly wise in the management of great affairs, let pass no occasion or opportunity to encourage him in the attempt; and besides by her compliance, and private conversation with persons of all degrees, gained no inconsiderable party of adherents amongst those of most eminent authority. Insomuch that being now prepared for the yoke, they began by a general accord to contrive the means with most ease to bring themselves into it. Some would have it proposed to the people in their several Provinces; Others, that by degrees the power should be let fall into his hands as it were through a remisness of the States ; Others, that he should make use of the credit he had with the Army, and having seised upon all the strong places, immediately to declare himself: But the wiser sort proposed an Alliance first with some powerful neighbouring Prince, and then whatsoever should be attempted afterwards none would dare to resist; but the people, though the name of Liberty were precious amongst them, yet being much less esteemed then the dear fruition of their wealth, would rather submit to an easie government, then expose all to the hazard of a doubtful war. Wherefore the result of their debates was, that the States in gratitude to Polidor should offer to treat in their own names with the Nobility of Armenia to bestow their young Queen Diophanta in marriage upon Prince Demetrius ; and to second it with such advantagious conditions to that Crown, that they should not be easily rejected. What was thus concluded in their several private Cabals, in a short time became the publike act of a general Assembly; and Polidor finding himself entreated to accept what with such industry he had laboured to procure, began to think of nothing less then a Crown, or at least the establishment of it in his son. But Solmona imagined herself already possessed of it; and though she were endued with a singular wisdom, yet to shew she was a woman, and subject to the passions of that sex, she began to stand upon punctilio's and terms of competition with the Queen of Macedon , whose greatness of birth, and experience in the changes of the world, made her nevertheless contemn, or at least not take notice of those little frailties in a person whose vertues she had ever loved. But in the mean while Demetrius was altogether ignorant of these great contrivances; what intrigues, plottings and stratagems were used to make him a King, who esteemed it a far greater honor to be a slave, and would not have changed his fetters for the Empire of the whole world, much less for so inconsiderable a portion of it as the Armenian Crown. But when by the publike act he perceived how far they had proceeded to his ruine, he armed himself with a resolution answerable to so great an opposition; and it was not long before he was put to the trial of his force: For within a few dayes after Polidor coming early one morning to his chamber, after the attendants were dismissed, he began to entertain him with this unwelcom discourse. Demetrius , how dear thou art to me I cannot better express, then by letting thee know the care I have ever had of thy advancement. These people who thou seest thus forward to treat a marriage for thee with the Queen of Armenia , will be as ready when occasion shall serve to offer thee the soveraignty of these Provinces; but it will be necessary in the first place to strengthen our selves with this alliance; therefore prepare thy self to be a Lover, that thou mayst be a King, and having the possession of one Crown, soon become master of another. Yet you must consider, that though I have with great patience by degrees ascended to these hopes, there lies now a necessity upon us to go on vigorously in the prosecution of his enterprise: For our intents are perceived, if not known, by many who at the present only comply because either they think it most secure for themselves, or else know not how to avoid it without the hazard of greater inconveniences both to the private and publike: But if they find any remisness in our proceedings, or that we fail never so little of those supports upon which we have laid the foundation of our rise, they will quickly take the advantage of our defects; and having once insinuated into the vulgar how neer they are to the loss of their liberty, easily prevent the like danger for the future, by removing not only all possibilities of making a second attempt, but those persons from amongst them, whose greatness they have such cause to apprehend: For the Emperor being weary of the war, and attacqued on all sides by other enemies, they may, having once raised these jealousies, when they please make a peace with him upon any terms; and the peace once confirmed, under fair pretences, at once disband the Army, and deprive us of our power. Therefore we must now either advance forward, or else be sure to retire with disgrace; and that these very people whose fathers Polidor with his sword redeemed from slavery, will trample upon his son Demetrius as their vassal. But by this Match you may establish your power above the reach of their malice, and bring the whole Nation into an absolute obedience; which otherwise, when I am dead, will neither want arts nor pretences to contrive your ruine, and repose no security in the benefits they have received from me, for they will as easily forget them, as they did their allegiance to their own natural Prince. Commonwealths reverence their Benefactors when they are marble, gracing their sepulchers and statues with glorious inscriptions to point others the way to the same honours, but seldom suffer the power to remain long in any one family that is great, either in birth, or merit; for though they love and cherish valour and courage, and undertaking spirits, when they are in distress, and have need of such vertues, yet in times of prosperity and peace they become their greatest terror. If Demetrius were less worthy, this State perhaps in gratitude would be content to let him enjoy the title, which when he was a child, in a complement, as a thing yet remote, they conferred upon him; but having already seen how much he dares, they will not dare to trust him with so great a power, unless their fears make them not dare to deprive him of it. Since then we are not safe, nor the honor of our family secure, whilst these Peasants who despise all Nobility, and love nothing but wealth, enjoy their liberty, to reduce them agen to the obedience of a Crown, cannot be called ambition, or if it be, having so just a motive, it is an ambition without a crime, and Diaphanta cannot but embrace the love of that Prince who hath so noble an ambition to preserve his own honour. Demetrius being prepared for such an encounter with a recollected serious countenance, presently replied; Sir, I am not ignorant, that as I received my life from you, I was not only born your Subject, but likewise bred a Souldier under your command, and by those relations am obliged by a triple duty to render an humble, willing, and strict obedience to all your commands. Nevertheless having ever shewed your self both a singular just Prince, as well as an admired wise General, and a no less indulgent Father, I conceive you will permit me the liberty, before I yield an absolute concurrence, to alleadge some objections, which perhaps will not be inconsiderable, against the many supposed advantages of this pretended alliance. It is chiefly proposed as the only means to cumulate honours upon our family, and as a strong Rampier, not only to defend it against the malitious assaults of an insolent ungrateful people, but from thence to batter and destroy that liberty which otherwise would perhaps in time seek the ruine of its Protectors. But alas, what honor can it be to the son of the renowned Polidor to borrow the shadow of a Kingly dignity from a woman, that is herself a meer titulary Queen? For do not the Nobility; and chief Officers of the Crown, to whose care she was left during her minority, though she be now of age to assume the government, still as Guardians usurp the Regal authority? which cannot be without an aim either to confirm it for ever in themselves, or else by a marriage to establish it in some of their own families. Therefore to what intent, unless to procure a disgraceful repulse, should I direct my addresses to such a Queen, who is so miserably oppressed, that she hath the least voice of all in the disposal of her own affections? Or suppose you should by a formal Embassie gain the consent of the Nobility, which is very unlikely, can it be thought probable, that they who contrary to all right detein the power from the lawful Inheritrix, will by the mediation of a foreign Allie resign both that and themselves into the hands of a stranger? So Demetrius who was born to be a Soveraign in his own Country, must sue, and entreat, and perhaps with much difficulty obtain the honor to be admitted a Subject to the Subjects of another Nation. Where are then those specious advantages of aids, and strength, not only to support the present dignity of our family, but to make an assured passage to the dominion of the United Provinces? Are they not still in the disposal of the Armenian Nobility? And it is not likely till they have a desire to devest themselves of that authority, that they will arm their new made Pupil with a force to make a conquest of the Peloponesians , that he may the easilier when he please reduce them to an absolute obedience. Therefore if my vote, as I am a party of no small interest, might intervene in the decision of this great affair, I should wholly reject the proposition as grounded upon false principles, and as absolutely contrary to the noble designs of so worthy a Father, as it is prejudicial both to his own and his Sons honor. Then falling at his feet, and embracing his knees, besought him by the tender affections of a father, either to leave him to his own inclinations, or else at least to respite his definitive sentence till he had taken time to consider of his reasons, which if they proved not of validity to alter him from his resolutions, he would by submitting to his will, in testimony of a perfect obedience, deliver up again into his hands that life which he had received from him. But Polidor was so far from being moved by his supplications, that on the contrary relying upon the experienced wisdom of his age, either through disdain that so young a man, and his son, should undertake to dispute what he upon mature deliberation had resolved on, or else contrary to his nature, by the perswasions of the Princess Solmona rendred inexorable, in a passionate rage he turned away from him, and going out of the room, with a look that expressed his displeasure, made only this short reply: Either resolve instantly to prosecute the love of Diophanta , and be a King, or remain for ever unworthy the name of Son. So heavy a decree, with such severity pronounced, struck such a sudden damp upon his spirits, that he continued a while in a manner sensless like a statue fixed to the earth: But then recollecting himself, rising from the ground, cryed out; No Demetrius will never shew himself unworthy of his birth; He will either be a King, or perish in the attempt; and that title which he disdains to hold from a woman, by the vertue of his sword make the purchase of his own valour. But oh Polidor! from whence proceeds it that of an indulgent father thou art so soon become a tyrannical oppressor of thy sons affections? Thou wouldst have me love, and my soul is already so wholly possessed with that divine passion, that the Goddess of Love herself sitting enthroned in my heart, I cannot be subject to any other laws; and I love a Princess, besides her natural endowments, both in birth and dignity so far above a petty titulary Queen of Armenia, that if I thought not my self assured of a Crown, I should not presume to say I loved her: And thy self, if thou knewest the flight my fancie hath taken, would say, Demetrius , thy thoughts soar too high. If then I love with such an ardent flame; if I am in my imagination already a King; and if my ambition be much greater then thy self didst ordain; in what do I contradict thy will? Is it an infringement of thy commands, to anticipate thy desires? Or am I less a Lover, or less ambitious, because my Love hath raised my Ambition to a heigth so far above thy pretences? Is it against the laws of piety to be directed by that supreme law of laws, that ought to be the guide of all our actions, Reason? which assures me, that in complying with thy desires I submit my self to a perpetual slavery; but in the fruition of Mariana's love shall at the same instant become possessed of a vast Empire. A filial duty is less obliging then a divine decree: The Gods have ordained me to love the incomparable Mariana ; and either I must enjoy her love, or else the family of Polidor , which to establish he vainly contests with heaven, remain for ever extinct in the miserable death of the unfortunate Demetrius . Whereupon throwing himself upon his bed, such a tempest was raised within his breast, that if his passion had not burst out in tears to allay the violence thereof, his soul undoubtedly had been oppressed and overwhelmed with the weight thereof. But at the same instant I entring casually into the chamber, having overheard these last words which proceeded from him with an unusual vehemence, and besides seeing him in so sad a condition, I could not forbear to say, What can make the happy Demetrius call himself unfortunate, and thus talk of misery and death, and the extinction of his family, and a contestation with heaven as if he were a person wholly abandoned to despair? What hath dissolved that manly courage into these womanish teares and complaints? Can any thing but a general ruine produce so great an alteration? Sure some strange unheard- of grief hath taken possession of that noble soul, and expelled thence the use of reason, or else he could not thus yield to passion, and lie as it were sensless of any thing but sorrow. If it be so, and your griefs are too violent, as it appears, for any one man to encounter, communicate them to me that I may bear a part in your sufferings; for I have dedicated my life to your service, and either now employ it to ease you, if it be possible, of these afflictions, or else having entertained a diffidence of my fidelity, adde to your miseries by embruing your hands in that blood, which shed in your cause would prove fatal to the oppressors of your felicity. Whereupon turning towards me, after a great groan, he replied, Oh Lysander! I am so far from the least mistrust of thy faith, that if I were not assured of thy friendship, and that I might with confidence discharge my soul into thy bosom, my heart is so overcharged with unspeakable griefs, that it would force a passage through this tormented breast. I can no longer conceal from thee the only secret of my life; let this, shewing me the Tablet, represent to thee the true object of my happiness, and consider in Polidor the counterfeit of an indulgent father: Mariana's beauty is the star by which I direct my course, and his cruelty the storm that threatens a miserable shipwrack to all my fortunes. Then relating to me the beginning of his love, how he deteined the Picture, when he sent the Casket back by Mercurio , and all the particulars that had newly passed between him and the old Prince, he continued: Now canst thou wonder that this constancie is shaken that lies exposed to such furious batteries? Rather admire that the whole fabrick is not sunk into the earth, which hath been so cunningly undermined by the councels and policies of an erronious affection. But Mariana makes good the place, and will for ever keep possession, not by secret plots and stratagems, but by an open defiance against the assaults of the whole world. Nevertheless it is a miserable condition, to maintain a war, though in a just cause, against a Father; and in a Subject a crime so capital, as cannot be expiated by the life of the offender, but the whole race must be involved in the same punishment: Yet it is as impossible to disunite me from my Love, as to be separated from those relations. A fathers severity may be turned into mildness, and a Prince at his pleasure may alter his laws; nay, the vast frame of the world may be shaken, and the universality of nature suffer a change; but a perfect Lover can neither turn, nor alter, nor change; for Love is the chiefest attribute of the Gods, and he that participates so much of their divine nature, must like themselves still remain the same. That power therefore which hath laid a necessity upon me to continue constant in my love, will either inspire me by a just means to overcome these difficulties, or else infuse such a gentleness into Polidor, that he will at length comply with my desires. In the mean while I expect from thee an assistance to my resolutions; which, to avoid the anger of an incensed father, and to dash at first all hopes of proceeding farther in this business so fatal to my happiness, are immediately to retire into the shelter of some other Country, till the violence of the storm be over. Prepare therefore habits with all things necessary for our escape, and after to morrow, about midnight, meet me in the wood, on the farther side of the Park, without the City, from whence, before any notice can be taken of our departure, we may easily get out of the States territories: And wheresoever I am, freed from these incumbrances, and Lysander in my company, I cannot want somthing of content, which in this place is wholly denied by the cruel adversaries both of my life and liberty. I perceived that the apprehension of being crossed in his designs, had so firmly setled him in this resolution, that it was impossible by any arguments to disswade him from it: Wherfore only desiring he would duly consider the condition of his affairs, without farther circumstance, I promised faithfully to obey his commands; yet that it would be necessary however to recollect his spirits, and not by a dejectedness to express his discontents, but by appearing in the Court with his usual alacrity, if occasion of discourse were offered by Polidor , to shew a flexibility to his desires, and that it was rather a youthful ardor, or love of liberty, then any aversness, that had moved him at first to disrelish his proposition, which a little time, with better consideration, might bring to an effect agreeable to his wish. Whereupon having with many kind embraces testified a great satisfaction in my ready compliance, and assured me punctually to follow my advice; he prepared himself to receive his ordinary visits, and I retired the private way out of his chamber; but upon the stairs unexpectedly met Mercurio, who was newly returned; yet knowing he would not communicate any thing of his business to me, passed by him only with a salute; and though I thought his coming might cause some retardment of our intended departure, yet not to give any suspition of a neglect, as Lovers are subject to all kind of jealousies, I went immediately to put things in order according to my directions. In the mean while, after some great persons were dispatched, who attended to present their customary respects, Mercurio gave a short account of his voyage: That the Princess Mariana at his arrival shewed him so little countenance, that at the first he doubted whether he should see her any more; nevertheless after two days attendance, one of her Ladies having sent for him, delivered him a Casket, and afterwards with her own hands she gave him a Letter, which having presented, he told him that the Emperor being advertised of the surprisal of Constantinople , marched that way with his Army, but afterwards understanding he had agen left it, came only himself with his ordinary train, to see how matters stood, and by the relation made to him by Theodosia of his proceedings, so admired his valour, and was so enamoured of his generosity, that it was commonly discoursed he had an intent to offer him his younger daughter Clarinda in marriage, and upon ratification of the match both to relinquish his right to the united Provinces, and to acknowledge them a free State; it being said there was already one nominated to be sent to propose a Treaty, and an indifferent place for Commissioners of both sides to meet, because the Emperor for the preservation of his honour to the world, stood only upon this punctilio, That at the same time he offered his daughter, the States should likewise send an honorable Embassie to demand a Peace. Which news was so displeasing to the Prince, that he could scarce forbear to break out into complaints against the hardness of his destinie, which raised so many oppositions to his happiness: But having received the Letter, his joyes and fears were infinite, till he had perused the contents: wherefore Mercurio being dismissed, first he considered the Characters, then kissed it a thousand times; but going to open the seal, he made a pause, as loth to offer violence to an impression made by those fair hands; and when pale and trembling, he began to tear the paper, a messenger from the Princess Solmona came to give him notice that she desired instantly to speak with him. When remembring my advertisements and indeed considering how necessary it was by a present cheerfulness in some measure to asswage Polidors anger, and apprehending the Letter might move such an alteration in him as would render his compliance impossible, having agen kissed it with great reverence, he put it next his heart, and went directly to the Princess appartement, who beginning to enter into a discourse concerning Diophanta , he so behaved himself, that she received an unexpected satisfaction, beyond her hopes; and the old Prince likewise coming in, he found his humour so changed, that he believed the greatest difficulty already past; wherefore with a seeming content on all sides, they passed a great part of the day together: but the houres were tedious to Demetrius , untill he had disengaged himself, for it was towards evening before he could find an opportunity to retire; at which time I being then in the Ante-chamber, he made me a sign to follow him; and being come together into his private Cabinet, he drew the Letter out of his bosom, and with a trembling hand breaking the Seal, read these following lines. testimony whereof I return the Casket, which contains things of so great value, that I believe she had no intent to injure me in that kind: But I can never consent that a Prince who is Captive to a Slaves beauty, should boast in any favor of mine; neither can I think that you esteem it such; but repenting your generosity in carrying none with you from Constantinople , you mean to wear that as a Trophy of your victory, in contempt of MARIANA. That this caused a strange emotion, you may easily imagine; but it is impossible to conceive the effects it wrought in him; for he was scarce come to the end, before his life seemed to be at the last period. But that word Contempt pierced him so to the heart, that the Paper falling immediately out of his hand, he sunk down upon the Couch like a breathless carkass, continuing so a long time without any the least shew of motion, and by all appearances past the help of any external remedies; for he was already pale, and cold, in his face and hands: but unbracing him, about his heart where the Tablet lay, remained such a burning heat, as if his soul by Mariana's cruelty expelled that noble mansion, had in a just revenge kindled a fire there to consume the Idol it had so much adored; yet withall such a violent beating, as if Love and Anger armed with all their power contending for the victory, and having made that the seat of their war, sought in the same flames to consume each other. But Love, the more powerful passion, at length prevailing, she by her gentleness extinguished that fire; and his vital heat at her command dissipating it self agen through all his members, he began by degrees to return to his former colour: When lifting up his eyes, as if two flood-gates had been opened, there issued forth a torrent of tears, which making way for his speech, with a faint voice he uttered only these few words. He that can serve any other beauty, is indeed unworthy of Mariana's favours; but he that can harbor a thought of contempt in disparagement of so divine an excellence, ought to suffer, as I do now, torments worse then the pangs of death. Whereupon I answered, He that did not contemn Marianas love, or at least were not ignorant in the arts of Lovers, could not so miserably afflict himself, having such fair assurances of her affection. What in modesty could she have said more? Or in regard of her honour less, then that the jealousie you served some other Beauty, suggested to her thoughts you contemned hers, and bred an apprehension you did not set so great a value upon her favors as she desired. It is evident she labours with these doubts, no less then Demetrius with the fears of her displeasure; and used this artifice to procure her satisfaction, whilst he loseth all his, and even his life with vain imaginations. Women are not less enclined to love then men, but far more subtle to conceal their flames; yet her regards did sufficiently testifie, when you gave the other Princess, their freedom, that her heart still remained the prise of your conquest. Oh my dear Lysander, he replied, how severe thou art to thy friend, and how charitable to the chiefest enemy of his life! Had the Princess such skill as thou supposest in the arts of Love, she would have been more merciful then by so cruel a censure to deprive him of all hopes, whom she thought worthy in the least degree of her affection. But for thy sake I will for a while flatter my self with a belief of impossibilities, and do somthing speedily either to vanquish Mariana's disdain, or else to convince thee of thy error, that thou mayst at length be forced to confess, there is nothing so despicable and wretched, as that life which thou endeavorest to preserve. In the mean while deliver that, pointing to the Casket which stood on his table, to Irene ; and whilst I take care of the rest, dispose all things in a readiness according to our agreement. Whereupon leaving him that night to his thoughts, the next morning he made a visit to the Queen of Macedon , to recommend more earnestly to her the protection of Irene: And having shewed himself in the Court, toward the evening retired to his Cabinet, where he writ a Letter to Polidor , which he left sealed upon his table: and at the hour appointed, in the habit prepared for him, came alone into the Park, where I waited with horses to receive him. The Letter was to this effect. honour, are crimes of an equal nature; therefore to maintain my innocence, I am forced to seek for refuge in another Clime. If this may excuse the present, my actions shall justifie those future proceedings, by which I will either compass those ends your self hath proposed, and obtain your pardon, or else in a noble pursuance of the means by a resolute death expiate the offence of your unfortunate son DEMETRIUS. How this came to Polidors hands, or of what happened afterwards, I can give no perfect account more then by common report, that his departure as soon as known was generally lamented; but before any notice could be taken thereof, we were advanced beyond the States dominions to Larissa a Town upon the borders of Macedon, and from thence making a great circuit, to avoid all possibilities of being discovered, after two moneths travel we came to the famous City of Thessalonica, where we had first news that Ambassadors were arrived from Sicily at the Port to conduct the Princess Mariana into her own Country; and that the Emperor with his whole Court intending to bring her as far as Trajanopolis , meant there to consign her, with a full restitution of her Dowry into their hands. Notwithstanding the Prince remaining constant to his purpose, we continued our journey to Amphipolis a great City built upon a Lake some four leagues over, and about forty from Trajanopolis: when being certainly informed the Emperor was already upon the way, and that after a weeks repose at Trajanopolis the Princess would in a short time be in that City, where Artabaces the Soveraign Prince thereof, but a Feudotary of the Empire, made exceeding preparations for her reception; he resolved there to expect the happiness he so much desired, once more to behold those fair eyes, whose first glances had gained such a soveraign dominion over his heart. Wherefore for privacie seeking a lodging in a remote part of the City, we happened upon a house joining to the Lake, that belonged to an aged man of a very reverend aspect, called Dribleon , who was a great Naturalist, and his humour, though a little extravagant, so divertising, that the Prince took great delight in his company. He was the author of many rare inventions, and amongst the rest had framed a motion of water, that indeed was most admirable to consider; and finding we were not only exceedingly delighted with it, but applauded his industry, he the more freely communicated to us his other secrets; and the Prince apprehending his art might be useful to him in a design he had working in his head, with an assurance of large rewards, obtained a promise of his assistance; and thereupon having commanded me to sell certain Jewels, furnished him with what money he would demand to encourage him in the work he had undertaken. In the mean while there happned no thing worthy mention. On the contrary the time began to seem tedious, especially to Demetrius ; for by reason of some little indisposition in the Princess, they staid twenty dayes longer at Trajanopolis then was intended: But that being over, and the ceremonies of parting ended, the two Princesses Doriclea and Clarinda were to accompany her to Amphipolis , and Xenobarbus Prince of Thrace , with Simonida his Princess, and a numerous train of great Lords and Ladies, being appointed by the Emperor to conduct her to Epidaurus where she was to embark, they departed from thence, and in eight days after arrived at Amphipolis ; where the entertainment was so noble, and the manner of it so extraordinary, that I cannot forbear to make a brief relation of the particulars. It was on purpose ordered that she should make her entry upon the water; and being arrived at the Lake, she was there received by Artabaces, who (as we heard afterwards) bearing a concealed affection to Doriclea , took that occasion to shew the magnificence of his State. He came with a Fleet of a hundred Gallies all compleatly rigged and manned, as if appointed for some present expedition; but so gloriously gilt, and adorned with Ensigns and Streamers, as if he would at once display both the riches and power of his Principality. They lay all ranged along upon the shore, and from the Admiral was cast forth a spacious bridge, at the foot whereof Artabaces with a great number of Gentlemen, the chief Nobility of his Country, sumptuously clad, though like Souldiers, attended her coming; and as the Princesses descended from their Chariot, with great reverence approaching towards them, having kissed the skirt of their garments, conducted them, with the Ambassadors and the chiefest persons of quality, aboard his own Gally, the rest of the Train being at the same time by the several Commanders disposed in the others appointed for them, which were all splendidly furnished according to the occasion, but the equipage of the Admiral surpassed the whole Fleet besides. There was no part of her that appeared, not so much as the Oars and Masts, but were richly carved and guilt; The Sails, being fastened to the Yards, were of white Taffata, and all the Shrouds and Tacklings of ropes of gold; The Chiorm which consisted of twenty Banks, and twenty Slaves on a Bank, were cloathed in Cassocks of Cloth of gold, with their Chains of massie silver; And on the Poop was raised a Pavillion of Tissue embroidered with the Imperial Arms, supported by pillars of Goldsmiths work; under which upon a little Ascent covered with Persian carpets of silk and gold, were placed Chairs for the Princesses, and a little lower Seats for Artabaces and the rest; Forty Pages, all of a stature and age, being cloathed alike with Gaberdines of Tissue, and short paned Hose richly embroidered, attending upon the Deck to serve upon any occasion. Having thus taken their seats, the Admiral moved first, and the whole Fleet dividing it self into three Squadrons, two came on each side at a distance, and the other in the rear. In this posture they began to advance towards an Island, which was made in the middle of the Lake upon great Boats, containing a thousand paces in compass; on the one side whereof upon a Rock, artificially raised to an extraordinary heigth, stood a Castle of a seeming impregnable strength, with divers armed men appearing upon the battlements as in a posture of defence: But coming before the Harbor, which lay in the form of a Half-moon, with two Forts upon each point as to guard the entrance thereof, there issued from thence another Fleet of Gallies with all warlike appointment; whereupon the two flanking Squadrons (for the Train were in the other) advancing to encounter them, there began a terrible Sea fight, which seemed so much in earnest, that in the conflict two Gallies of the adverse party were sunk, and a great number of the men seen swiming as it were for their lives. But Artabaces Gallies at length prevailing, the others fled; and the Castle and Forts at the same time, as in token of obedience, taking in their Flags, planted other Ensigns in their rooms, with the Imperial and Sicilian Arms joyned together. Then the Admiral with the Squadron in the Rear entring the Harbor, as it were to seise upon the place, as the Princesses landed, there was a young woman of an exquisite beauty representing Venus , attended by divers Cupids , and two hundred Virgins, who upon her knees delivered up the keyes of the Castle, with the possession of the whole Island, and the Palace, which was a piece of excellent Architecture raised upon pillars some twenty paces from the water- side, and in the Frontispiece of the Porch, in great characters of gold, was written, THE PALACE OF LOVE ; Through which was seen a spacious Garden, adorned with many artificial Fountains, and Walks of Trees, bearing all manner of ripe fruits; which being taken up by the roots, and set in ranks, made it appear a place by long industry brought to an admirable perfection. Here was prepared for them a sumptuous Banquet, during the time whereof the Nymphs made such a ravishing Consort of musick and voices, that it appeared indeed the heavenly Palace of the divine Godess of Love: And the Collation being ended, the Tables on a sudden vanishing out of sight, the Princesses remained seated upon a kind of Throne, which, part of the Island at the same time falling away, remained even with the water: When immediately out of the hollow of the Rock whereon the Castle stood, appeared two Sea-monsters, which drew after them a Chariot framed like a great shell, in which sate Neptune and Thetis by themselves, being followed by divers other Chariots, drawn likewise by several Fishes with little Boyes upon their backs blowing trumpets of Fish-shels; in which were an infinite number of Sea- Gods and Nymphs, who with voices and instruments made a most delectable harmony; and passing by the Princesses, Neptune as in sign of homage laid his Trident at their feet. Then entred into the haven a small Gally with twenty oars, at the head whereof stood Clitiphon brother to Artabaces , in compleat armor richly gilt, representing Mars, with all manner of warlike instruments at his feet; and coming up to the throne, presented his Sword and Shield, in which was engraven this Motto in Greek, Vanquished by Love . Presently after entred two other Gallies, in the former whereof was the young Prince Euripedon , Nephew to Artabaces , clad like Paris , with a golden ball in his hand; and in the other the three Goddesses, who eagerly pursued him for that prize of beauty: But passing by the Princesses, he cast the ball amongst them; whereupon the other Gally with the Goddesses immediately making a stand, they celebrated the praise of their beauty in an excellent song, being answered by all the Sea-Nymphs that made up the Chorus. But whilst they were singing, in the middle of the Harbor, to the admiration of all the beholders, rise from under water the Hulk as it were of a small Vessel, which casting forth smoke and flakes of fire, the Decks at the same instant parted, and there appeared a Gally rowed by twelve Negro's clothed in cloth of silver, the Stern guided by an old man representing Time , and upon a Shield of silver sate Cupid triumphing with a shaft in his hand, pierced through a heart; at whose feet lay a Knight in plain silver-arms suitable to the shield, his helmet by him, and his sword and lance, broken into divers pieces. But when the Gally came before the Princesses, and Cupid delivered the Shaft to Mariana , she was surprised with such a wonder, that her colour and countenance changing on a sudden, she neither believed what she saw to be real, nor had the power to behold what she imagined only an apparition: Neither were the two Princesses less amazed at so unexpected an object; Doriclea remembred perfectly the lineaments of Demetrius face, and Clarinda by her blushes shewed she had never forgotten that person, whose vertues she esteemed incomparable. But before they had recollected themselves, whilst they remained gazing one upon another, the Gally being advanced agen into the midst of the harbor, with artificial fire-works that were placed about it, seemed all in a bright flame, and as it were by degrees consuming, the Decks on a sudden closing agen, in an instant it sunk under the water, leaving all the company in an astonishment what art could produce so rare a spectacle. Artabaces himself beheld it as miraculous, and approaching to the Princesses, said; Some Deity that inhabits this Lake, in derision of our endeavours, hath now at length shewed it self to congratulate your presence; for otherwise I confess my self as ignorant from whence it should proceed, as unable to comprehend the secret of so strange a mysterie. But the Princesses who knew the vertue and power of Demetrius made another conjecture, yet not seeming to take farther notice of it for the present, they agen embarked, and in the same manner they came to the Island, save only the Sea-Chariots with their Muoick kept about the Admiral-Gally, they went on to the City; where they received an entertainment suitable to the entry, but I know nothing more of the particulars: For the Prince being returned with Dribleon the Conductor, and inventor of the invisible Gally, to his house, having nobly rewarded his ingenuity, lest enquiry should be made after him, immediately left the City; and but once more had the happiness to see the Princess in her passage, which was at Stobi . Wherefore finding it was impossible, whilst she was thus in continual motion, to effect his desires or approach her presence, he retired to Salona a Port-town in Albania , with a resolution to hire a ship there, and with the first occasion to follow her into Sicily . Being come thither, we lay a while privately, till news came that the Sicilian Fleet with the Princess was departed from Epidaurus: And in the mean time having found a Captain of a Vessel, who for a good reward was willing to undertake the voyage, we prepared our selves for our departure; when being ready to embark, a stranger who likewise waited for a passage, desiring to be admitted into our company, the Prince perceiving he was a person worthy respect, willingly condescended thereunto; and the wind being fair, we presently set sail with assured hopes of a succesful voyage. Thus favored with a fresh gale, we advanced into the Main: but towards the evening the wind so abated, that we scarcely made any way at all, and six days and nights successively after were in a manner be calmed: Nevertheless at the end of the seventh, we hoped with the next rising Sun to discover the Coasts of Sicily ; and early in the morning one of the Shipboyes having from the main-top descried land, at the news thereof ascending upon the Deck, whilst we stood with delight beholding the long wished for shore afar off, we perceived a Gally with mighty force making towards us; which when she approached neerer, the Captain by her Colours knowing to be a Sicilian , wished us to prepare to fight, for it was impossible, we having so little advantage of the wind, but by the help of her oars she would overtake our Vessel, and if she were of the adverse party to Antiochus , undoubtedly assault us. Whereupon the Decks being cleered of incumbrances, every one betook himself to such weapons as were next at hand; except only a young man about nineteen years of age, in the habit of a Mariner, but whose extraordinary mein could not be concealed under that base covering; who with his arms folded upon his breast, his legs a-cross, and a sad countenance, leaning against the Main- mast, stood in that dejected posture as unconcerned in all our motions, or any thing else, but his own sorrowful thoughts. Which Demetrius first observing, wondring at such an indifferencie in a time that threatned somthing of danger, and in a person whose goodly composition promised a manly performance, stepping to him, said, If thou art what thy habit speaks thee, why art thou so neglectful of thy Captains command, or so careless of thy own safety, when every man expects the encounter of an enemy, to remain thus regardless of both? But either not heating, or not minding his words, he only looked up a little, and pulling his cap more over his eyes, fixed himself agen in the same disconsolate posture; and before the Prince could question him farther, the Gally having hailed our Vessel, commanded the Captain to strike his Topsail, which he refusing unless required in the name of Antiochus , they presently attacqued us, and being grapled together, the Sicilians came on so vigorously, that in an instant they leapt upon our decks; yet by the valour of Demetrius , and the Stranger that came with us, many of them by the loss of their lives found the error of their boldness, divers with dismembred bodies, lay gored in their own blood, bewailing their too much forwardness; and the rest being driven to despair, to avoid the fury of the Conquerors, were ready to expose themselves to the mercy of the waves. When the Captain of the Gally perceiving such a slaughter amongst his men, and that they were not only like to lose the possession of the Ship, which he esteemed so easie a purchase, that he had not vouchsafed his own presence in the fight, but his Gally likewise, if his men were so repulsed, to run the hazard of being taken; incensed with the disgrace, with his sword it his hand, he flew like lightening into our ship, and his motions were no less terrible to our almost wearied men: So that easily making a way through them, the Stranger, who had given exemplary testimonies of a noble courage, was forced to a little retreat, and even Demetrius himself to retire two or three steps backwards; but reassuring his footing, he advanced upon him agen with a double force, and a terrible combat began between them two. When the Mariner, who all this while had remained as one stupid either to his own or others danger, as soon as he behold the Captain of the Gally, like a Lyon roused from his sleep, he stept as enraged to the next man he encountred, and having wrested his sword out of his hand, with a voice that threatned destruction, he cryed out, To me, thou rebellious inhumane monster! for to me alone belongs the chastisement of thy horrible treasons; and whosoever seeks to share with me in the glory of my revenge, I defie him as an enemy. At which summons, the Captain, as receiving new vigor, forsaking Demetrius , turned to the Mariner, whose prodigious strength was no less an admiration, then the occasion of his sudden fury; for with the weight of his blows he compelled his daring adversary to retire, and having driven him to the side of the ship, on a sudden closing with him, thought as we conjectured to have thrown him headlong into the Sea; but strugling so for mastery, being fast entwined in one anothers arms, they fell both together overboard with a confused shout and cry, both of our own and the adverse party. When Neptune , who by the terrible clashing of their swords, as if summoned by Joves thunder, had been raised from his profound mansions, to behold the issue of this furious conflict, astonished with the prodigie of so much courage in humane breasts, and affrighted with their fall, lest if they perished in the Main, their ghosts should invade the peace of his dominions, by the power of his Divinity conveyed them safe into the Gally; where having loosened their hold, they soon recovered their feet, and as soon, with the same eagerness as before, renewed the combat. But the Captain, shewing that in the greatest extremities he had a present judgment, as soon as he perceived he was in his own Vessel, content with that prize which he then thought sure his own, lest we should follow after them, cryed out to his men presently to unfasten the grapling irons; who were so speedy and resolute in the execution of his command, that before we could force a passage, they got free of our ship, and with main force made for the shore; whilst with afflicted minds that we were not able to afford him any assistance, we beheld the Mariner alone defending himself against the whole force of the Gally, and we lost the sight both of him and it, before we perceived he was vanquished; for when we could no longer distinguish the men, by the brandishing of their weapons in the air we knew the fight was not yet ended. Which more then humane prowess seemed to verifie those antient fables of the Gods, who upon several occasions are feigned to have assumed the shapes of inferior mortals. Nothing ever before caused greater admiration in Demetrius , then this unexpected accident; nor ever any mans actions, except only Prince Alexandro's , could make so great impressions of an Heroick vertue. But when we had recomposed our selves and whilst the ship was cleansed, the hurt men provided for, and the dead heaved over-board, we sate in the Cabin descanting thereon: As if the Gods had been offended that we should so partially attribute so much of miracle to a creature of the same composition with our selves; To shew there was something above us both of greater power and terror, on a sudden covered the heavens with a mid-night darkness, and at the same time loosening the winds from their obscure dens, which with hideous roaring invaded the bosom of the Ocean, we had no other light, but what with horrible thunder breaking from the clouds, seeming to inflame the whole horizon, menaced us with a fearful destruction; and the Sea, as if our boasting had been the cause of its disturbance, with mountainous waves threatned to overwhelm our frail Bark, which with their impetuous beatings against her sides, having at length opened a plank, the Mariners forsaking their labour, abandoned both themselves and us to be devoured by that merciless element. When the courage of the Stranger was in this remarkable, that with threats of death overcoming their fears, he compelled them agen to work, some at the pump, and others to endeavour the stopping of the leak; whilst Demetrius , as once the Trojan Heros in the like extremity, though not seised with the like cold fear, stretching forth his hands to heaven, implored the assistance of the divine powers, who pleased with that humiliation, commanded the winds back agen to their dark prisons, and unvailing the heavens, discovered certain stars, which comforted us with the hopes of an ensuing day, and with the day once more to enjoy the glorious light of the Sun. Such was the efficacie of a pious devotion, that our wishes were fully accomplished; but when day appeared, we found the violence of the tempest had driven us many leagues from the coasts of Sicily , and in a now still calm, not left us without almost as certain apprehensions of danger: For, our Vessel had sprung many leaks, and having no wind to drive us to any Port, our only trust was in the strength of our arms, by continual pumping to endeavor our preservation; and though death was now as neer as in the storm, yet the terrors not being so great, our men having less apprehension thereof, with wonderful alacrity continued their labour. In this manner we remained ten days floting upon the sea, without any certain hopes of succor; and though we hoised all our sail, could scarcely perceive we made any way. Nevertheless at length we descried land, and by degrees, contrary to all expectation, arrived in this road, within two leagues of the shore; where our men, with much watching and extreme labor, of which though every one of us, and even the Prince himself bore a share, not able longer to continue, unless Boats came to fetch us off, we were sure before the next morning to perish. Wherefore, notwithstanding all the signs we had made perceiving no aid coming to us from the land, Demetrius and the stranger, confident in their swiming, with a generous resolution exposed themselves to the sea; with an assurance that if they scaped themselves, as in such a calm they doubted not of their strength, they would send us a timely relief; which both they and we, turning to Synesius , have received by your noble care: And now you know the person you have so highly obliged, I hope you will not retract any of your favors, but for his sake pardon the many errors I have committed in my tedious discourse, especially for deteining you so long at this time. Whereupon Alexandro infinitely delighted with this story, with many thanks kindly embraced Lysander ; and both he and Synesius having expressed a great satisfaction in the knowledge of so gallant a Prince, by a mutual consent they returned all agen to his appartement. End of the Third Book. THEOPHANIA. BOOK IV. to his no little content: But the company being retired, Alexandro , whose thoughts suffered him not to enjoy any long repose, early the next morning walked out alone; and when he was about two furlongs from the house, following a small tract that led into a solitary grove, the place so suited to his humor, that venting a world of sighs and tears, he became insensibly engaged in a thick wood, on the farther side whereof lay a great rode; and wandring up and down to seek a path whereby to return, having at length traversed it almost quite through, between the Trees in a green Lawn, not far from the high-way, he spied a horse tyed by the reins to a shrub that grew upon the banks of a runing stream; and advancing a little further under the shade of a large spreading Oak, perceived an armed Knight lying upon the ground, with his helmet off, and a tawny shield under his head, who by the restlesness of his motions expressed a great unquietness of mind: which breeding a curiosity in Alexandro to know more, he approached softly without being perceived to a thick bush within distance, and lying down under the shelter thereof, to his wonderful astonishment heard these ensuing complaints. Iust Gods! You have at length forced me to acknowledg your power; I now see the vanity of my ambition, the malice of my revenge, and the little confidence that is to be reposed in Armies; for I that so lately commanded multitudes which threatned destruction to Antiochus and his posterity, am now left thus desolate, forsaken of my friends, and unpittied by my self. But why do you not pursue your vengeance? Will you suffer him still to live, who hath been so vile a Traitor both to his King and Country; and not only sacrilegiously profaned your Temples, violated the holy Priesthood, and despised your Laws, but as in contempt of your divinity pulled down your Altars, and thrown your sacred Images on the earth? Can you forbear to dart thunder against that breast which hath harboured such impieties? I have by degrees proceeded to the heigth of all mischiefs, and it is not now in my power to provoke you farther: Therefore no longer delay your punishment. But death is too mild a chastisement for offences of so transcendent a nature: The World, which I have abused, must be a witness of my miseries; Antiochus , whom I have injured, receive a satisfaction in my sufferings; and Eudoxia his vertuous Queen, whose chastity I have defamed, triumph in my overthrow. But Love, thou gentle Deity, to thee I appeal for mercy; Thou kindlest those flames which sought to consume all that opposed them. Had I not by thy command loved Artemia , and she by violence been taken from me, my other injuries perhaps had been forgotten, and I had not thus been at defiance both with Gods and men. Therefore since thou hast in some measure been the author of my crimes, in compassion afford relief to my torments; and if thy own darts have not the power to kill, borrow one of death, and with a favorable wound pierce this heart, which by thy instigation hath nourished such presumptuous thoughts not only against Antiochus and Eudoxia , but even against heaven it self. Whereupon Alexandro being no longer able to contain his passion, rising from his place, and drawing his sword, cryed out, Wicked Cenodoxius! for by thy crimes I know thy name; darest thou think of death, and still thus add to thy guilt? Wilt thou make innocent Love, which never inspired other then noble thoughts, conscious of thy bloody designs? Thou hast enough derided the divine mysteries of the Gods, and vilifying their authority, rebelled against Antiochus: Therefore Alexandro , the son of that Antiochus, whose birth, if it had been possible, would have been stained with thy base scandals of Eudoxia , stands here armed with their power, as the minister of their justice, to send thy soul to those torments, if there be any so horrid, that thy ills deserve. Upon this sword depends thy fate, which thou canst not possibly avoid: yet in thy defence shew thy self worthy of my revenge, that I may not repent thou hadst the honour to fall by these hands; which, if thou hast not a courage, great as thy mischiefs, to encounter me, I shall wish had been the act of an infamous executioner. To which Cenodoxius , who when he first saw him approach in such a posture, started up and stood upon guard, presently replied, The world hath received such testimonies of my valour, that Prince Alexandro cannot be ignorant I dread not death, much less any mortal encounter; and only chance hath discovered to him that inward sense of my proceedings, which his sword assisted with the force of all his allies, nor the united strength of the whole Nation, nor the cruelty of tortures, could ever have extorted from me. Yet know I repent not my own intentions, but lament in my fall the rise I have given to others to put in execution their dangerous designs. What I have done was in a noble sense of my sufferings, which were so injurious, that I believed the Gods would never have forsaken so just a cause; and I will avow I was ambitious to have had it in my power to revenge them, but was ever as far from intending any violence to the sacred person of your Royal Father, as I am now from lifting my arm against his lawful Successor, which shall never be, though provoked in the just defence both of my life and honour; for I acknowledge there belong to him as well a present respect, as a future obedience. Therefore if it were possible, I would flie this encounter: But lest he should be apt to impute that to a degenerate cowardise, which proceeds only from a reverence to his birth, I will remain here under the shelter of my sword and shield; as just men when Jove darts lightening upon the earth, retire into their house, not that they fear the thunder, but because they will not defie his power: And thus guarded, my life is secure as in an impregnable Fort, which apprehending neither batteries nor assaults, sends forth no forces, nor makes any sallies to repulse the enemy. Yet if you will vouchsafe a parley, I shall upon easie terms surrender up the place into your hands. I only desire a patient hearing of my wrongs, the redress I will leave to your Princely inclinations: But if upon the recital of my story you judge me, though not blameless, unworthy of your compassion, and still despise that life, which perhaps will appear the only means left for your preservation, I shall patiently submit to my own misfortunes; but you will never be able to divert that torrent of confusion, which, in Corastus new acquired greatness, threatens the total subversion of this flourishing Monarchy. Whereupon making a stop; Thou do'st so gallantly, said the Prince, beg for thy life, that I almost begin to wish thou wert less faulty, or that thou hadst not spoke so well. Such an undauntedness of spirit in a lawful enemy, would make me ambitious to embrace his friendship; but in a Subject it is an insolence so insupportable, and the permission of it so destructive to the dignity of Princes, that hadst thou no other crime, I might in a just indignation, to suppress thy arrogance, sacrifice thy blood to my anger. Yet I so much love the resemblance of vertue, for I cannot deny the bravery of thy resolution appears no less, that I am content for a while to respite thy fate; and not to satisfie thy desire, but the world in the candor of my actions, will lend an impartial ear to the relation of thy story; of which already I know so much, that though thy courage were equal to thy boasting, and thy security, under the defence of thy arms, much more then thy vanity doth suppose, yet I could not doubt with far less difficulty to force a passage through them to thy disloyal heart, then I have obtained this victory over my self, to delay the execution of my just revenge. However I give thee my word for thy security, till thy discourse be ended; but upon this assurance, for I suppose a reconcilement impossible, that thou shalt afterwards prepare in equal combat to receive the chastisement due to thy demerits; though I confess I feel a strange inclination within my self, to desire that thou mightst appear, after a due submission, worthy of Antiochus and my pardon. If I do not, replied Cenodoxius , I am content to accept of your conditions; but I am as confident to be received into your favor, as I am assured you are a Prince of a generous magnanimous spirit, and being born to be a King, have such a publick soul, that for the general good you will forget all personal injuries, or particular interests. In the mean while I deliver my self into your hands; and in testimony I desire not henceforth to employ my sword but in your service, thus prostrate upon my knees, I lay it at your feet. This was a strange unexpected sight to Synesius, who when he heard Alexandro was gone abroad, fearing some ill encounter, with Eleutherius in his company, went to seek him; and imagining it most likely he was walked into the wood, knowing the passages thereof, happened presently upon the place where he and Cenodoxius were together, at the very same instant that in such a submissive posture he delivered up his sword. Which caused in him no little wonder; for though he were ignorant who Alexandro was, he very well knew Cenodoxius , and that such humiliations were very contrary either to his custom or humor. But he was surprised beyond all imagination, when Alexandro putting forth his hand to raise him up, said, I receive this thy submission not as satisfactory, but as the duty of a Subject: yet laying aside my birth, and the name of Alexandro, though I will not say I should be glad to find a cause to entertain thee as a friend into my bosom, I cannot deny but I wish thy actions had not rendred thee so odious. By which time having spied Synesius, No more they had not, he replied, if the prudent advice of this my noble Kinsman could have prevailed, who wisely judging of the event, disswaded me from the undertaking; and though I inconsiderately rejected his counsel, I must, with pardon, crave leave to embrace his person. But Synesius stepping back, told him, he could not permit his embraces, whose actions had rendred him odious to Prince Alexandro ; and though the neerness of his alliance had hitherto been chiefly the cause of his disgrace with the King, yet he would now give that testimony of his loyalty, as not to own a relation to his enemy. Then with one knee touching the ground, and kissing the Princes hand, humbly besought him to pardon those errors he had through ignorance committed: For though, as he had often expressed, his genius ever assured him he was a person to whom he ought to pay more then an ordinary duty, and that there was something in his countenance which he believed he had formerly known; yet not having had the honour to see him since he was a child, and not forgetting how unhappy he was in the displeasure of his Royal master, he was as far from supposing him to be the Prince, as from the imagination that he would be pleased to grace that Subjects roof with his presence, whose fidelity, through the malicious suggestions of his adversaries, was, though wrongfully, so much suspected. When the Prince interrupting him, replied, I cannot dissemble, that the impressions I formerly received, if I had known you sooner, might perhaps have made me more scrupulous in accepting the offer of your house: But besides the obligation at our first encounter, I have since observed such a discerning judgment in your discourses, and so right a sense of honor in all your proceedings, that I believed it impossible you could any way favour, or be engaged in so unworthy and unjust a cause as the present war; and this accident hath but by a few hours prevented the discovery I meant to make to you of the person whose life you did preserve, which I am resolved so to imploy in the vindication of your honor from those scandalous aspersions of disloyaltie, that the King finding his error, shall at length in justice be forced to declare, that they who treacherously in such difficult times deprived him of so worthy a Councellor, were no less his, then your enemies. But for the present let me prevail with you to give a friendly entertainment to Cenodoxius ; for in your presence I will hear the relation of his story, and in the mean while engage my promise, That though I cannot easily forget the injuries past, I will neither look upon him as an enemy, nor yet by any outward resentment testifie that I believe him to be the author of them. Whereupon not admitting any farther discourse of that subject, he desired Synesius to be their guide to conduct them out of the Wood; and going directly to his house, whilst Cenodoxius disarmed himself, went to visit Prince Demetrius , and entring into the chamber, heard him, as he lay upon his bed, utter these complaints. Oh Love! why art thou so cruel a tyrant to require such a strict observance of thy laws, and wilt not afford thy vassals the reward of their obedience? Which though I have served thee with so pure a devotion, I dare not presume to hope, much less to aspire to the fruition of those incomparable joyes, which thou hast ordained to be the only object of my felicity. Where then shall I vent my moans, or of whom seek redress to my sufferings? Of whom, replied Prince Alexandro , but of thy friend? Who being a witness of thy constant love, will be the instrument to procure thy satisfaction; and either Mariana must gratefully acknowledg her happiness in the acquisition of so noble a Lover, or else disclaim the interest which Alexandro, as a Brother, may justly pretend to in her affection. When Demetrius casting himself at his feet, and embracing his knees, I cannot, said he, more reverence the person of Alexandro, knowing him the heir of a mighty Monarch, then I did before in his resemblance of the divine Mariana: But that from such a heigth he can descend so low as to compassionate my miseries, strikes me with no less admiration of his generosity, then the consciousness of my own demerits makes me apprehensive of her cruelty. She must be cruel to herself, replied the Prince, and an enemy to Alexandro , if with the same tenderness of affection as he doth now, she receive not his friend Demetrius into her bosom. Then casting his arms about his neck, they remained both a while mute; till Alexandro first breaking silence, said, With what an excess of joy could I thus for ever embrace my friend, if like him I might at length hope to see the period of my sufferings? Whereupon Lysander entring into the room, interrupted their farther Caresses; and understanding who Alexandro was, kneeling down to kiss his hand, besought him to pardon the over-great liberty he had presumed to use in his presence: which though it had been a known fault, would have been easily excused in one so dear to Demetrius: And to express the confidence he reposed in him for his sake, he presently related the passages of the late encounter between him and Cenodoxius , desiring them to be witnesses of his story, which if he were faithful in the recital, would acquaint them with a great part of his own misfortunes. And thereupon taking them both with him to his own appartement, where they dined together, which was by Alexandro's absolute command, because he would not be known to the domesticks; after the tables were taken away, Cenodoxius having by Synesius desired to be admitted to his presence, whilst he went to call him, they retired into the Princes bed-chamber, that Ervillius likeise might partake of that entertainment; who finding a great amendment in himself, sate up in his night-gown upon a couch; and Demetrius having embraced him with great demonstrations of affection, Alexandro acquainted him with the occasion of their coming thither, with which he was exceedingly surprised at first; but seeing Cenodoxius enter into the chamber, he composed himself the best he could; and the Prince having placed Demetrius by him, and commanded the rest to take seats, after such salutations as you may imagine might pass from persons that bore such inward animosities against Cenodoxius , he began to enter into this ensuing discourse. wicked designs ever reproachful to the contrivers; both the one and the other are variously censured, or esteemed according to the success: But it is the constant fate of great undertakers, that if they fail in their attempts, they not only lose their fortunes, but withall the reputation either of conduct or valour. Therefore I will not seek by arguments to maintain a cause, which is already condemned because it hath miscarried; though I may truly boast, not through either of those defects: Neither was I ever conscious to my self of those ignoble principles destructive to Monarchy; which by the discourse of my life will be so evident, that in considering the vast ruines of my party, I am confident you will find not only sufficient, but worthy materials to raise a rampier against this popular inundation, which by the overflowing power of Corastus and his adherents menaceth the devastation of your Fathers Kingdoms. And not to lose more time in the pursuance of so glorious an enterprise, I will without farther circumstance enter into the narration of my story; by which you will perceive, that though in the late defeat of my forces the superstructure were demolished, a foundation still remains whereupon Prince Alexandro may build to himself a more absolute Empire, then any of his Predecessors, since with victorious arms they first gained the soveraignty of this Nation, durst ever aspire unto. This preamble, to Demetrius and Lysander , who were strangers, and unacquainted with insolence in Subjects, appeared very unsuitable to the condition of a vanquished Rebel in the presence of his natural Prince, which by their countenances they seemed to express: But Alexandro , who very well knew the vain-glory of the person, and being besides resolved to hear with patience what he would say, without shewing the least distaste, desired him to proceed: And the rest thereupon setling themselves in a posture of attention, he continued in this manner. To shew the original of my disgraces, and of the troubles in which this Nation is now involved, I must look back some few years to the reign of Theodora, who though by a doubtful claim she got possession of the Crown, through a seeming popularity brought the people into a slavish obedience: And not only the Natives, but foreign Princes, and even a Queen as absolute in dominion as her self, who if not before her in right, the acknowledged heir of this Kingdom, by whose title the King your father now sits upon the throne, felt the bloody effects of her tyrannie. But however the legality of her succession were questionable, having once assumed the government, she entertained those Maxims which most conduced to the establishment of her power. Wherefore knowing that a Prince who will be absolute, must either by an awful terror compel a strict obedience, or else with a shew, at least, of clemencie and vertue gain the affections of the people; and being in her nature cruel and ambitious, she thought severity the most certain means to compass her designs: Nevertheless surpassing even all her sexe in the art of dissembling, she so vailed it over with a mask of affability, that though she were resolved to make her will a law, yet she appeared to the vulgar the most submiss of women, and was believed to have neither affections nor desires, but what tended only to the common good: Insomuch that her most violent proceedings were thought forced by a publike necessity; her unjust wars abroad in fostering rebellions amongst the subjects of neighbouring Princes, pious undertakings for the relief of the distressed; her frequent oppressions at home, studied policies for the preservation of her Countries liberty; her violation of the laws, a watchful providence for the protection of justice; and which was most admirable, her profound dissimulations real vertues, and an innate tenderness of affection to the people; by which she so won their hearts, who judge only by outward appearances, that the great ones, who chiefly groaned under her tyrannie, though they perceived her artifices, durst not seek to undeceive them; but whilst she lived, they reverenced her as their common mother and Protectrix, after her death deified her, and have ever since offered annual sacrifices to her memory. Amongst other subtleties by which she deluded the world, it was her chiefest glory to maintain the name and reputation of the Virgin-Queen, pretending that having wedded the Subjects Interests, she could not confine her love to any particular object: But indeed neither her pride would suffer her to admit a Companion in the Empire, nor her variable desires to be confined to the chaste embraces of the nuptial bed. Notwithstanding being often pressed and supplicated by her dear Children, for so fawningly she called the people, by the choice of a Royal husband, to permit them at least to hope continuation of their present happiness to their posterity, which they could no way expect but by the establishment of the succession in the issue of so gracious a Princess; though she meant nothing less, yet upon occasions to serve her own ends, which without regard of the future, were only to maintain a vast uncontrolled power in herself during her own life, she many times seemed to comply with their desires, and by this bait appeased the fury of divers neighbouring Princes, who whilst she entertained them with the hopes of joyning this Kingdom to their own by an alliance, neither assisted one another against the invasion of her Armies, nor sought to revenge the injuries received in their own persons. To omit divers others, A great example of the advantages she gained by this cuning practice, was that notable overthrow given to the Imperial Navy: For having by her allurements brought Hipolito Prince of Istria into a belief that she meant to marry him, the hopes of a Crown, though otherwise his vertue was the glory and emulation of that age, made him so far forgetful of his vertue, that upon several pretences and punctilio's of command, retarding those succors which from the Islands that were under his government should have joined with the Grecians, he gave the Queen leisure to raise a mighty force both by sea and land; and whilst the Emperors Fleet hovered about these coasts in expectation of his assistance, it was by a terrible storm for the most part so broken and shattered, that Marcellus our Admiral obtained an easie victory over the remainder of that invincible Armado. But Theodora being once past her fears, Hipolito soon found how he had been deluded by the vain hopes of an imaginary greatness; and by that wonderful success being now freed from all apprehensions of a foreign enemy, she so little cared any longer to dissemble her inclinations, that those Princes whom till then she had amused as Suiters, finding that their perseverance would in the end produce nothing but a dishonorable repulse, began with less earnestness to pursue those treaties, and at length wholly desisted from their addresses. Nevertheless the Queen seeming still desirous to satisfie her people; and having by her instruments instilled into them as it was easie for her to work them any way, that a strange alliance would be prejudicial to their liberties, she began to publish to the world, that she intended to provide them a Father indeed, by making a worthy choice amongst the Nobles and Princes of her own Nation. Under which pretence admiting divers Favorites to a more then ordinary familiarity, as often as her fancie pleased, disgraced some, and advanced others to the same hopes: But amongst all those who were looked upon as capable of so great an honor as the fruition of this reputed incomparable Queen, none was more worthy, though none had so sad an experience of her pride and inconstancie, as the noble Heraclius my unfortunate father. He was by a long continued descent of famous ancestors, though born a Subject, a fit pretender to a Crown; By his glorious atchievements both at home and abroad, though young in years, grown old in the esteem and admiration of the people; And as if the Gods by the excellence of his endowments had intended to raise him to a fortune equal to his merits, the beauty of his person, his meine, and deportment considered together, had such a powerful influence, that even the chastest Virgins, to maintain their vertue, contended for his love; but all their hopes and contestations ended, when they perceived that those perfections were now become the sole object of the ungrateful Theodora's affection. At first by eminent employments she drew him to a neerness about her person, which he so discharged both to his own and her honour, that the favors she cast upon him seemed but the just rewards of his service: Then at times letting fall ambiguous speeches, she emboldened him to pretensions of a higher nature, which though either through modesty, or prudence, knowing the fickleness of womens passions, he seemed not to understand, yet he wanted neither a noble ambition to undertake, nor a generosity of courage to struggle with those difficulties, which either through envy, or competitors were opposed in his way to the throne of Soveraignty. But whilst things hung thus in suspence, an unexpected accident seemed to remove all obstacles on every side, which to to the world might both justifie Thedora's love, and entitle Heclius to a more then common interest in her affection. Though the Queen were now in the height of all her glory, victorious over her enemies, and generally beloved by her own people, yet there wanted not those both at home and abroad, who maligning her prosperity, when they saw open force could not prevail, sought by secret machinations to deprive her both of life and Empire; amongst which, her greatest, and then most powerful adversary, was Valentinianus Emperor of Rome , who, besides the affronts and indignities he received from her, had ever favored the title of Aurelia Queen of Cyprus , who being her Competitor for the Crown, she then deteined in a miserable imprisonment, and afterwards, when there was no opposition to awe her tyrannie, under a formal shew of Justice most barbarously murthered: Which the Emperor either foreseeing, or at least endeavouring to prevent, had long sollicited her deliverance: but finding no submissions or entreaties could procure her liberty, had set on and assisted the Grecians to invade this Kingdom; but when that design failed, lamenting the misfortunes of Aurelia , and his own want of power in not being able at that time to afford her relief, Castorax a valiant Commander amongst the Romans, but whether or no authorised by the Emperor was never certainly known, undertook by a desperate course at once both to satisfie his Masters revenge, and to free the distressed Queen from the oppressions of her usurping adversary. Wherefore assuming the habit of a Merchant, he soon arrived in Sicily ; and having some time frequented the Court, under pretence of several Negotiations, as was very well known to those by whom he made his addresses: One day as the Queen was walking in a garden, attended by Heraclius with divers other Lords and Ladies, taking that advantage to put his enterprise in execution, he presented her with a Memorial, which whilst she was perusing, he secretly drew from under his mantle a short dagger; but as he lift up his hand to give the fatal blow, Heraclius perceiving his treacherie, at the same instant steping between, received a terrible wound under his right pap; yet nothing daunted either with the danger, or the suddenness of the accident, the poignard remaining behind, he pulled it immediately out of his own bosom, and stuck it in the Assasins heart. Then turning about to Theodora , The Gods, said he, have this day shewed their justice in your protection. But as he was about to continue his speech, through the abundance of blood that issued from his wounds, his spirits begining to fail, he fell prostrate at her feet, and with a faint voice uttered only these words; Madam, I die, but die contented, since I have sacrificed my life for your preservation. Whereupon the Queen, who knew not any cause she had to fear, till at the same time she saw both the Traitor weltring in his blood upon the ground, and the dear preserver of her life ready to expire his latest breath, she could no longer suppress that passion, which till then she had so artificially concealed; but breaking out into a desperate rage, ran furiously to the dead body of Castorax , and setting her foot upon his throat, drew the poignard out of his side, which aiming at her own breast, she perceived certain characters engraven upon the blade thereof, and pausing a little to peruse them, read this inscription:  Castorax a true born Roman To Theodora the Barbarian. In considering whereof, having something recollected herself, Are these, said she, the Regalio's, those boasters of their own vertue prepare for Princes? Barbarous Theodora indeed, if thou shouldst thus abandon thy life, which now more then ever thou art bound to cherish, that thy just vengeance may become the terror of these blood-thirsty Romans. Then falling upon Heraclius , and as she embraced him puting one hand under his head, and the other upon his wound, with a pale trembling countenance, the Index both of sorrow and wrath, burst out into these expressions: I will, if it be possible, stop this passage through which thy soul flies so swift away towards the Elysian shades, as esteeming the love of a Queen too mean a reward for the merit of such an heroick action. But why wert thou so generous, to raise that hidden fire in my bosom to such a mighty flame, if thou wilt now leave me to be consumed by it? The Gods have allotted me too sad a fate, if I could not live but by thy death, and yet have ordained my life to be inseparable from thine. When sighs interrupting her speech; she laid her mouth so close to his, that she seemed to breathe into him her own soul; for holding her hand still upon his wound, which stopped the blood, he lift up his eyes a little, and looked her in the face, but immediately closed them agen. Whereupon she cryed out, Ah do not so unkindly leave me! Live, my Heraclius , live to add the glory of thy revenge to that of thy suffering: She intreats thee to live, for whose sake thou wert so willing to die; Or if thy eyes are now shut for ever, let thy spirit hover a while about this place, to hear the vows, which in stead of tears, that would asswage, if not extinguish the heat of a noble passion, I here offer to appease thy offended ghost. Be witness, O you Gods! I henceforth declare a professed hatred to the Roman Empire, that Nursery of pride and ambition, which not contented with any limits, seeks to usurp the dominion of the whole earth; and those Kings that do not willingly submit their necks to be trampled on, either they endeavor by force to subdue, or else employ their bloody Agents thus to massacre them even in their own Palaces. But for every drop of blood that hath issued from this manly breast, I will send thousands of Roman souls to lament their cruelty upon the Stygian banks. I will pull that usurping Monarch from his throne; his insulting Princes shall feel the sharpness of my sword, their Priests nor Flamens shall nor escape the fury of my revenge; or if amongst the Gods any can be so unjust to protect such monsters, I will throw down their Altars, and renounce their Deities, and even Jove himself shall find the people of Sicily love their Queen, and reverence her authority, more then they fear his thunder; and in contempt of his power I will set up Onions, or Cats, or what my own fancie shall best like to be adored in his chiefest Temples. As she uttered these horrible blasphemies against the divine Powers, which were enough to fright even the dead out of their graves, Heraclius stirred a little and fetched a great groan; insomuch that the Physitians, who were instantly called, being come upon the place, and perceiving motion in him, gave some hopes that his condition was not altogether desperate; and desiring the Queen to commit him to their care, which by the perswasions of the Lords that were about her she willingly granted, they conveyed him to his lodging, and having searched his wound, assured her the danger was not great, unless the abundance of blood which he lost had too much weakned him: But when they had applied their remedies, and given him some Cordials, the signs of his amendment were more apparent; for in a short time he recovered his speech, and not long after took a little rest, to which Theodora with infinite joy for the present left him. Nevertheless her desire of revenge was nothing abated, but immediately assembling her Councel, after unheard of cruelties used upon the dead body of Castorax , she published an Edict that diligent search should be made to apprehend all the Romans in her dominions: which was accordingly done, and those that could be taken, of what age, sex, or condition soever, were presently condemned to dye by most cruel tortures; nor therewith satisfied, the enacted a law, that those who were found for the future should be proceeded against with the like severity. No Province, City, Town or Village, but was filled with blood and slaughters: For by reason of the strict league that till the reign of Theodora had been between the Emperors and the Kings of this Island, the Romans lived promiscuously amongst the Sicilians, as if they had been one people: but now such was the zeal they bore to their Queen, that when they heard of the attempt made by one of that Nation against her life, they ran headlong in multitudes to destroy them; Children delivered their parents, parents their children, and wives their husbands into the hands of their persecutors; Infants were torn from their Mothers breasts, and even Priests in the midst of their sacrifices were dragged from the Altar to the place of execution. Whilst these tragedies were acting in all parts of the Kingdom, Heraclius by the exceeding care and diligence of the Physitians was agen restored to his former strength, and Theodora now openly avowed her inclinations, insomuch that the management of all great affairs was wholly committed to his trust, the Nobles courted him, the people applauded so worthy a choice, and all in general expected either with envy or desire the consummation of their hymeneals. But the news being arrived at Rome , of the terrible persecution of the Romans in Sicily ; the Emperor Valentinianus, though with a resentment of the injury equal to the provocation, and no less revengeful in his resolutions then Theodora , yet proceeding with more moderation, sent Ambassadors to disavow the fact of Castorax , and withal to desire a cessation from the slaughter of his innocent subjects. Which was only to mitigate the Queens rage, if it were possible, until such time that he had prepared an Army for their defence, and her chastisement But these modest sollicitations on the one side rendred her more insolent; and Valentinianus on the other lost no time in compleating his Army, which was already encreased to a formidable number; so that the Ambassadors, who were scornfully treated, had no sooner set sail for Italy, but they were ready, if not prevented, to arrive upon our coasts; and the report of their force struck such a terror into Theodora, that her thoughts were for the present diverted from the soft delights of a Lovers embraces. The only care now was to divert the fury of this terrible storm; the Ports are secured, the Nobles consulted, and the people by invective declarations against the Romans animated to their just defence. But the result of all lay in her own bosom, which at that time was open only to Heraclius , whom she appointed Generalissimo of all her forces both by sea and land; and when all things were in a readiness for this great expedition, retiring one day into her Cabinet, she spake to him in this manner. Heraclius , how high thou art in my esteem, thy own merits may assure thee; for I have never been ungrateful for the least benefit received from any the meanest of my subjects, but to thee I owe the preservation of my life with the apparent hazard of thy own; which being an obligation of the highest nature, thou mayst justly expect from me whatsoever is in me to give: Wherefore I have already invested thee with the power; and when thou returnest victorious, as it were a sin to doubt of thy success, I may without exceptions of the most envious, bestow upon thee with my self, the title and dignity of a King. Remember then, it is not fame alone for which thou art now to fight, nor the spoil of the enemy, nor thy Princes honor, nor the publick good, those ordinary incitements that draw all generous spirits into action, but for thy own proper interest, and the establishment of the Crown upon thy self and thy posterity: which can never be, unless together with the suppression of the Romans power, we raise an irreconcileable hatred between the two Nations, who otherwise, having lived hapyily so many ages in a firm league of amity, will perhaps when they feel the inconveniences of a war, desire to unite again; and our subjects, to purchase their own peace with security, relinquish that cause, which now through a blind zeal of affection they are so forward to maintain. For thou art not ignorant through what difficulties I have passed to the Crown, nor with what a constancie the Emperor Valentinianus hath adhered to Aurelia's party, under a false supposition, not only that my birth was illegitimate, but that Dyonisius my father did at his death by a solemn testament deprive me of the succession; which though maliciously suggested, are pretences that strongly oppugne the conservation both of my life and honor: For as well the laws of the Kingdom, as likewise the strict dictates of the Gods, do under severe penalties forbid that the scepter of this Island should be polluted by the hand of a spurious issue. And though by artifices and dissimulations, to speak truly, unworthy the dignity of a Queen, I have so gained the hearts of the people, that hitherto for the most part they have given but little credit to those scandalous aspersions; yet being in their nature sickle and unconstant, we shall be too much wanting to our selves, if we neglect any means wahtsoever to prevent the danger of a future alteration. I will no longer therefore conceal from thee those secret counels which haye so long labored in my bosom for a delivery: And be not startled at my resolutions; for though at the first view they may seem to carry a face of horror, yet once brought to maturity, they will appear the beautiful issue of Piety and Reason. Know then that the chief tye between the people of this Country and the Romans, is the unanimous consent of both Nations in matters of Religion; which knot nothing can dissolve, but by discovering to the world the luxury, pride, and avarice of the Priests and Flamens, and by that means to work them to a detestation of the Roman Gods, the numerous, various adoration whereof are indeed either the vain Chimera's of superstitious brains, or else the subtile inventions of wicked Polititians, introduced only by a specious shew of devotion to tyrannise over mens consciences, and by bringing them into an awful reverence of their divine power, to serve as bottomless gulfs to devour the vast treasure of whole families provinces and kingdoms. For what else are the several names given to Jupiter , but so many effects of his power; and all the other rabble of Gods, but the sundry attributes or influences of his divinity? Yet those divers names are honored with several Temples, and different ceremonies; and the heavenly vertues or divine influences which flow from him only, are reverenced as so many distinct Deities with peculiar rites and sacrifices. Yet not content with those delusions, but to accommodate their Religion to all sorts of inclinations, the drunken feasts of Bacchus , the immodest Lupercals, and even the beastly God Priapus himself are held in no less veneration then the Goddess of Temperance, Minerva , or the most chaste Diana . Is it not then evident that this multiplicity of Godheads is only to increase a blind zeal amongst the vulgar, and by the infinite number of sacrifices and oblations to enrich and cherish the slothful luxury of their attendants? into whose store all kind of humors empty their superfluities, and even the most necessitous increase their own wants to add to their abundance; insomuch that the Priests doe in every Province enjoy the goodliest possessions; and they who ought to be examples of humility, are grown so insolent with their wealth, that they dare contest with the chief Nobles and Princes of the land; nay, their pride is so exorbitant, that they have often strugled for power with our Predecessors, and do to this day exempt themselves from the jurisdiction and authority of our lawes. Wherefore, not to hold thee longer in suspence, I am resolved to launce these pestilent tumors, which otherwise will ulcerate the whole body of the State; besides, it were a dangerous folly to permit those to have the directions of our Subjects consciences, who tacitly disavow our right of succession, and at the same time to engage them against an enemy whose principles are the same, and their quarrel grounded on no other pretence. No, my Heraclius , since we cannot by any other mean procure our own safety, we must no longer suffer these idle superstitions to reign amongst us. Yet that both Nobility and people may be the rather induced to like the change; and not imagine it proceeds from any interest of our own, they must be enriched with the spoils of these domineering Flamens and their adherents; but especially the Souldiers, who being ever least scrupulous in matters of Religion, will, when they see it so much concerns their own profit, need no provocation to hasten their ruine, and ever after with a more stedfast resolution maintain the justice of our cause. If therefore thou concurrest with me in opinion, we will immediately put this design in execution, and henceforth no God shall be acknowledged in Sicily but the omnipotent Jupiter, whose Images we will adore by the name of the Sicilian Jupiter , yet with a limited devotion, and such rites as may best suit with the politick maxims of the present Government; and as for the rest, their Priests and superstitions being abolished, they shall be exposed to the rapine of those who are most forward to seise upon the prey. Heraclius with no little astonishment, but with exceeding attention observed the issue of this discourse; and whether convinced with her reasons, or knowing it in vain to oppose her will, and that not to comply was instead of advancement to procure his own ruine, finding she expected an answer without any deliberation, made this reply. Most illustrious Princess, I can neither sufficiently admire your wisdom, nor give a due commendation of the studious care you have ever shewn for the welfare of your people; but that you should make one so unworthy as my self the object of your favor, is a goodness so far beyond all expectation, as the poor inconsiderable services of your Vassal Heraclius are from the ambition of aspiring to so great a reward as the affection of the most excellent Theodora ; yet to remain insensible of the impressions of so transcendent a happiness, were an unmanly degenerate stupidity: And though I cannot plead desert to raise me to such a height of felicity, I am in that no more deficient then the most potent Monarchs of the earth; for though they may lay Crowns and Scepters, and the Trophies of conquered Nations at your feet, yet they cannot be so vain to boast an offering that may deserve the love of so incomparable a Queen: It is your clemencie alone can create such a world of merit; which if you lay upon these shoulders, shall be as strongly supported as Atlas doth the immense fabrick of the Universe. I cannot promise more, nor will I perform less; and to testifie I am as ready to comply with your desires, as free from the servile flattery of ignoble spirits, your pleasure once declared, the insulting Flamens shall soon feel the chastisement due to their demerits: Yet consider, I beseech you, the dangerous consequence of such violent alterations; and if whilst you thus endeavor to secure your self, you open not a way to the extirpation of your posterity; for it is only the fear of the Gods, and of infringing their laws, which maintains amongst the people the Prerogatives of Princes, as deputed to them for the administration of their divine justice; nor is it improbable, that to add a greater reverence to their persons, they have by degrees suffered the increase of these superstitions, as pious frauds, both to preserve the dignity of their office, and a civil union amongst men; therefore in abolishing them you may perhaps destroy the tenure of your own power: however it is apparent, when you embolden the vulgar with prophane hands to violate those things which in all ages have been reputed sacred, at the same time you instruct them to vilifie and despise the authority of Kings; for if they once perceive the holy mysteries of the Gods have not been exempt from error, upon the least suggestion of turbulent discontented spirits, they will easily believe that Princes their Vicegerents have through ambition usurped a tyrannical jurisdiction, and then the Sacred Unction cannot protect them from the rage of popular innovation; but the multitude contemning all humane dictates, the Regal Ornaments will become the derision, and the Flowers of the Crown the Trophies of their fury. Besides, it is not unworthy our most serious thoughts, that as Religion is the chief obligation which preserves the concord of particular people amongst themselves, and of several Nations one with another, so it is the fairest pretence for factious Contrivers to stir up domestick Rebellions, or for foreign Princes, being ambitious of Empire, to invade the Territories of their neighbors. And though amongst your subjects, some will undoubtedly without difficulty approve of the change, others for their profit comply, and the major part perhaps through fear submit to the present exigence; yet education hath so powerful an influence upon the mindes of men, that they who have been bred in them, will never be drawn to forsake their errors, but be ready to embrace any occasion whatsoever to embroil the State, through hopes that in a general confusion an opportunity may occur to introduce agen their antient superstitions: And stranger Princes, under a pretended detestation of our new received opinions, though indeed to make a miserable prey of this so distracted Kingdom, will not only renounce their former leagues, but be still ready to foment the fire that shall set all in a combustion. And though our habitation be indeed strongly fenced in with the Sea, and separated from all the rest of the world, yet we are so small a parcel of it, that we cannot possibly think long to subsist, if we live at defiance with the whole race of mankind: which, if we set up a new Religion, never before heard of, or received in any other Clime or Region, must inevitably follow; for our old Allies will forsake us, and if we seek for new, the most barbarous Nations will refuse us for their friends, who have been so unconstant to our Gods. When therefore our Island, as the best policed Commonwealths are subject to mutability, shall either be infested with civil dissentions, or else lie open to the oppressions of some formidable Invader, having neither charity amongst ourselves one to another, nor the compassion of friends from abroad, being destitute of help, and utterly deprived of all external support, it will appear like a poor small weather-beaten Bark floting in the midst of the Ocean, and miserably tossed with storms and tempests; whilst the despairing passengers beholding her sails torn with the wind, her tackling fail, her masts shivered, her anchors lost, the rudder broken, and their whole Vessel full of leaks, terrified with the horror of their present danger, both lose the use of reason to assist themselves, and in vain implore the assistance of the heavens, having neither Compass, nor Mariner, nor Pilot, nor so much as the glimmering light of any favorable star to conduct them safe to a secure harbor. I may therefore under favor suppose, that though what you have designed is most congruent to the present condition of your affairs, yet perchance the most certain means to establish your Empire for the future, will be to let things rest as they are, and to conclude a happy peace with the Emperor Valentinianus , though purchased at any rate, so he will relinquish Aurelia's, and acknowledge your, Title: Otherwise, I am ready to execute your just commands; and this arm, supported with your power, shall either depopulate the vastest Regions of the habitable world, or secure you from the apprehension of your Enemies. Oh my better Genius! replied the Queen; it is no marvel thou hast such an attractive power over my affections, since both our souls seem inspired with the same thoughts, and governed by the same principles. These reasons thou hast now put into the ballance, have long strugled with my resolutions; and if either by Treaties, or the mediation of Allies, or by incredible submissions, or any other means whatsoever I could have contracted a peace with Valentinianus , I should never have proceeded to such extremities; and you may easily believe it is not choice, but necessity, that at length forces me to it: For during the reign of Euphemia my elder sister, when I was cruelly persecuted by the Flamens, as suspected to have an aversion to their Gods, did I not by oaths and protestations, and a strict observance of all the usual rites and ceremonies, assure my sister of my constancie in that belief wherein I had been bred? And if you will imagine me so wicked to have dissembled then for my own security, why, since the power hath been in my self, have I not freely declared my opinions? You see I have not yet since my coming to the Throne, either in my own private practice, or in the publick solemnities altered any thing of the antient forms; but to shew my zeal to that profession, received my Crown, and the holy Unction from the Roman Flamens, aud have hitherto maintained Ambassadors at Rome , by declaring my sincere intentions to continue still the same league and union with the Emperor, to obtain his approbation of my Title: But since he is so obstinate not to depart from Aurelia's interest, and nothing can induce him to hearken to any terms of reconciliation, We must, if it be possible, by rooting out his faction, disenable him to offend us. This is the most visible remedy for the present evil; and future ages, as we do now, must suit their councels according to the different revolutions of their affairs. Pursue therefore, with an undaunted courage, in my safety, thy own greatness: But let us no longer lose time in discoursing of what ought already to be put in execution. And thereupon taking a Ring from her finger, she brake it asunder, and delivering the one half thereof to Heraclius, I conjure thee, said she, to preserve this, as I will do the other part, in testimony of my promise that thou shalt hereafter enjoy with me an equal share in the Empire, as likewise to remain a pledge of our mutual fidelity: And if in thy absence during this present expedition, or at at any other time, thou shouldst by cross fate be plunged in any exigence of misfortune send me that as in remembrance of the vow I here make in the presence of heaven, that though in the remotest part of the earth, I will employ all the power of our dominions, and even my own life to redeem thee from thy adversity. Whereupon kneeling down, he kissed her hand with such a zeal as expressed the gratitude of his heart; and after reciprocal protestations of an inseparable amity, and a constant perseverance in the prosecution of their designs, they parted for that time, Theodora to communicate her intentions to the Nobles, and Heraclius with the promises of infinite booty to prepare the Souldiers to withstand any opposition that might happen. The souldiers with little difficulty embraced the proposition; but the Princes and Nobility, or the greatest part of them, as much as they durst, sought to disswade her from such an attempt, as they conceived no less perillous then impious: But knowing the obstinacie of her disposition, and that besides the fond affection of the people, the Army was disposed to be at her devotion, they were forced to submit, or at least to suffer what was not in their power to remedy. So that things being thus ordered, and Theodora having in a general assembly of the States made a specious declaration of the abuses and superstitions introduced by the Flamens, a severe Decree was published, under grievous penalties prohibiting the use of any other rites or ceremonies except only those that appertained to the worship of Jupiter ; and to cover her malice with a greater shew of piety, lest through corruption the same errors should agen creep in amongst them, she assumed to herself and to her successors the sacred office of the High-Priesthood, vainly supposing that all the inferior orders depending wholly upon the Prince, He might the easilier, upon any occasion, impose upon mens consciences such Tenents or laws, as should most conduce to the supporting of an unlimited Prerogative. Whereas indeed the right of divine authority being denied them, their ordinances have ever since been contemned; and then their abject compliance with the Crown, only to maintain the shadow of a borrowed power, hath in these latter times been so scandalous, that it hath given the chief, if not the sole occasion, to ruine both themselves and it; whose sufferings it will be then too late to lament, when their fall, as inevitably it must, hath crushed and dashed in peeces the whole frame of the civil government. Nevertheless mischiefs not foreseen, or if foreseen, not regarded by Theodora , in respect of the secure fruition of a Crown, not at all deterred her from the accomplishment of her designs; but proceeding without controll, every thing succeeded so according to her desire, that it is almost incredible with what a precipitate rage the multitude ran in throngs to demolish those antient Reliques of Antiquity with which their Ancestors had adorned the Shrines and Altars of the Gods. The Priests were expelled the Temples; the Vestal fire was extinguished; and the sacred Virgins wishing to be interred alive, as desirous rather to suffer the punishment than the crime, were polluted with unchaste embraces. In fine, all was exposed either to massacre or rapine; and the Queen being now absolute Mistress of her desires, she seemed to defie the force not only of Valentinianus , but even of the whole world. Yet to carry all with a shew of sanctity, in the first place she took care to establish her new Model of Religion; and having caused an Image of gold, formed by cunning workmen, such as for art the like had never been seen, to be set up in the chief Temple; Herself attired in the holy vestments, with a Garland of Oak upon her head, riding in a Chariot drawn by four white Bulls covered with trappings of gold, with a hundred Virgins cloathed in white, perfuming the air with incense, being attended by Heraclius and divers of the Nobility, who durst not seem to dislike of her proceedings, besides an infinite number of the common people, the Beasts destined for the offering being led before, went in solemn Procession through the City, every street where they passed being sumptuously adorned with the richest furniture belonging to to the Inhabitants: And approaching with a submissive reverence to the new erected Altar, herself pulling some of the hair from between the Beasts horns, which she cast into the sire, and drawing a long crooked knife upon their backs, the inferior Priests slew the Sacrificee, the Ceremonies whereof being ended, with a general applause of the people, she returned agen in the same pomp, to her own Palace. In the mean while Valentinianus with his whole fleet was approached so neer our Coasts, that those who would not comply, and had escaped the persecution were fled to him for protection; but finding by their relation, that the party he relyed upon for assistance was totally suppressed, and the rest generally united with the Queen, knowing his own strength was not sufficient to make an invasion, rather then to hazard a disgraceful repulse he resolved to return back agen to Rome without attempting any thing, and though now more irritated then ever, to delay his intended revenge till some fitter opportunity. Thus those enterprises however difficult, that are resolutely undertaken, and vigorously pursued, are for the most part prosperous in the event, the success making them appear both just to the world, and honorable to the contrivers: And so at this time it happened to Theodora , for having luckily effected her designs, and Valentinianus at the report thereof having withdrawn his Army, never any action was esteemd more glorious, nor ever Prince so applauded with the general acclamations of the people. But this surfet of happiness made her nauseate all other pleasures; the thoughts of Love were despised, her Vowes to Heaven forgotten, and Heraclius who had placed her on the Throne of Fortune, because the onely instrument of her Felicity, the chief object of her hatred. Nevertheless she knew so well how to dissemble, for that was her chief master- piece, that at first, being of a frank generous nature, he perceived it not: And the Sardinians , a people acknowledging Theodora for their Soveraign, having at the same time tumultuously taken arms in several Provinces for the protection of their antient Gods, and at last united all their force under the command of Conar , who was descended of the true race of their native Kings; Heraclius , under a pretence to add to his glory, was with the Army under his command, sent upon that enterprise. But he no sooner arrived at Oristagnum , the Metropolis of that Kingdom, but his friends at home advertised him, that the Queen began already to cast her eye upon new Favorites, and that it was apparent a little absence would wholly alienate him from her affection, if not prove fatal both to his life and honour. Whereupon transported with a rage, he furiously assaulted the Army of the Rebels; and having driven them into their holds, began with a recollected seriousness to consider of the condition of his affairs. When being daily stimulated with fresh advices of the inconstancie of that ungrateful woman, he privately assembled some few of his chiefest Confidents, to whom having laid open his secret griefs, after various debates they all concluded, That since the Queen, according to the common maxim of tyrannical Princes, no longer regarded any Subject, then either whilst his service was apparently necessary for the support of her greatness, or his power a terror to the licentiousness of her will, no means ought to be omitted which might conduce to those ends of which herself had been the principal author: Neither could he now with security retire agen to a private condition; for a popular great man, though he walk in never so direct a path, very hardly avoids at some time or other to stumble upon a scaffold; and she very well knew the people so applauded her choice, that finding themselves deluded of their expectation, they might be apt upon the least summons to take arms, in his sufferings to revenge their own injury: Nor was it to be doubted, that incited by those jealousies, she would endeavour, either by force or stratagem, to procure his ruine; which if not suddenly prevented, would be no less certain, than reproachful, That he who for Theodora's sake, to establish her upon the throne, durst by abolishing their rites, provoke the anger of the immortal Gods; to maintain justice, and for his own security, had not the courage to oppose the petulant humors of a fickle ungrateful woman. Therefore to avoid both the danger and the scandal, he should immediately whilst the memory of his late victory rendred him terrible to the Sardinians, by offering a grateful advantagious peace, oblige them to his party; and to engage them more firmly, having taken hostages of Conar for their fidelity, to put Sicilian garrisons into some of their chief Towns; yet that his Army might not be diminished, and to express a greater confidence of the Sardinians, to receive a competent number of them under his pay, who through an innate disdain of their long slavery, would willingly follow his Ensigns: By which means he should not only wonderfully encrease his strength, but by their invading of Sicily , putting them past all hopes of a reconciliation with the Queen, make them more faithful to his designs: And though he might be confident his own souldiers would ever remain firm to him, yet such associates who fought for the vindication of their Gods, and their Countries liberty, would questionless by their example render them more resolute in their undertakings: And if he attained to his ends, the restoring of their antient priviledges would be a welcom reward of their labour; or if by the chance of war he were overcome, he had a whole Kingdom at his devotion for a secure retreat. But success was as certain as the attempt; for having a Fleet ready in the harbor, he might transport his whole Army, before there could be any advertisement of the design. Neither had the Queen as yet secure in her prosperity, prepared any force to oppose his power. Nothing ought therefore to retard so just and necessary an enterprise; but instantly concluding a Treaty, with as much expedition as might be to prepare for his departure, and with his sword in his hand, either to force Theodora to ratifie her former vows, or else by the punishment of her infidelity to wash away the stain of his own dishonor. This was the united advice of all his friends, but most urgently pressed by Ergastrix his own Secretary, who though ever faithful to his master, in his heart detesting the violation offered to the Gods by Theodora, hoped thus by her fall, in restoring Aurelia to her right, to introduce again those antient customs; not without some assurance, that being free in her choice, she would in gratitude of so great a benefit, make the author thereof the companion of her happiness. But Heraclius , who never rashly concluded any thing, having with a profound judgment hearkened to their debates, when Ergastrix had ended his speech, remained a while silent, but presently recollecting himself said, Most faithful friends, By the councel you have given me, I perceive how sensible you are of my injuries, and doubt not but you will be as forward to assist me in all dangers, as you have been free in your advice to prevent them: But before I can return a determinate answer, you must give me some small respie in a business of such weighty consequence, to consult a while with my honor. Whereupon immediately leaving the room, they retired severally; his friends to expect, and he into his private Cabinet to form a resolution. Hereupon Cenodoxius fetched a deep sigh, and making a little pause, said; Some accidents about that time intervened, which though they are material to the continuation of this story, yet because they more particularly concern Heraclius , than point at that end to which this discourse is chiefly directed, and having already perhaps in your opinions, though I shall aptly enough apply all in the conclusion, related many things impertinent to the present purpose, not to delay your expectation any longer, I will hasten to those occurrences, which having reference only to the publick, will seem most worthy of your attention. But Alexandro at that sudden stop observing an alteration in his countenance, was curious to know what might be the cause thereof; besides having never before heard those affairs discoursed of in that manner, though he thought he had too boldly trenched upon the honor of Theodora , and the justice of her proceedings, yet desiring rather to know the truth from an enemy, then relying upon things, because none durst contradict them, received as truths, to found his actions upon false principles, was not only exceeding attentive to what he had said, but seeming very much pacified towards him, desired he would not omit any particular either of Heraclius or his own fortune: For though at first he had only promised to hearken with patience to his discourse, he confessed he was now somthing pleased with the novelty thereof; therefore enjoyned him what persons soever he were to mention, or whatsoever were the subject of his ensuing narration, that he should use the same freedom which he had done hitherto. And this he spake with so much mildness, that Cenodoxius began already to conceive he had vanquished the fury of his disdain: Wherefore absolutely to gain him, in a more submissive manner he proceeded in his discourse. End of the Fourth Book. THEOPHANIA. BOOK V. required in those who are born to Soveraignty, and you abundantly testifie how worthy you are of such a birth, by permitting so great a licence to my speech, in which otherwise, through fear of offence, I should have forborn to touch upon divers passages which will not be unworthy of your knowledge. But emboldened by so gracious an invitation, I shall conceal nothing that is material to the present subject, nor leave your curiosity unsatisfied in those particulars, which hitherto have been the secrets of our unfortunate Family; therefore without interruption to continue. No sooner had Heraclius retired to his Cabinet, which for the greater privacy, was in one of the highest Towers of the Castle, which had a fair prospect upon a large Plain that extended it self many Leagues upon the Sea-side, but opening one of the Casements he addressed his prayers to heaven to direct him in his resolutions; when suddenly his meditations were interrupted with an unusual spectacle, which at a remote distance presented it self to his view in the adjacent Plain. He immagined he saw a great white cloud advance leasurely forward upon the earth, and as it moved ascending into the air, seemed to be insensibly dissipated by the brightness of the Sun, which by reason of a clear serene skie, caused in him no little admiration, but approaching within distance to be discerned, his wonder was not at all abated, when he perceived a solemn procession of Matrons and Virgins, cloathed all in white, barefooted, some bearing white Tapers in their hands, and others with Censors casting Incense into the air. Whereupon immediately descending, he called his chiefest friends to him, and placing a strong guard upon the Gate, for fear of some intended stratagem by the enemy, himself accompanied only with those that were of his secret Councel issued forth to attend the success of this adventure, giving a strict command, that whatever happened there should be no farther motion in the City but by express order, and by that time they had advanced some few paces from the Castle, the Procession was almost ready to encounter them, when it immediately made a stand, Heraclius and his attendants doing the same, exceedingly admiring the order of their proceeding. But I doubt once more, said Cenodoxius , you will think me teadious in the relation of this seeming Pageantry; No, reply'd Alexandro , and again I both entreat, and enjoyn you, not to omit any circumstance to make up the full narration of your story especially in this particular, for it promiseth to be both delightfull, and of consequence in the conclusion. Your Highness judgeth rightly, answered Cenodoxius , therefore I will under pardon describe to you the whole manner of their solemnity. The Leader of this reverend Band, was a modest elderly Matron clothed in a loose garment of course Canvas, with a vail upon her head of the same; she was bare-footed, and carried in her hand a Spear, to the point whereof was fastened a Banner, having painted on it in lively colours, a Peacock with his train spread, being the bird of Juno, the Goddess whom that people superstitiously adore as their Protectrix, After whom followed in pairs a hundred and fifty women more, about the same age, and in the same habit, their eyes devoutly fixed on the earth, each one bearing in her hand a burning Taper; and after them a very aged Matron supported by two others, herself in the same kind of habit, but flowing more loosly, and some other little distinctions, which shewed her to be the Superior, or Governess of that society. The next was a woman of middle years, who bore likewise in her hand a Banner, wherein was represented Juno sitting upon a cloud, and divers people of all conditions praying to her; she was followed by two hundred more in the same manner, carrying lighted Tapers, and bare footed, but their habit differing from the former, for their under-garment, the border whereof only appeared, was black over which they wore a white vest or fine linnen girt close to them with a silken cord, and their Matron had on her head a larger vail then the rest, training upon the ground, with a long silver staff in her hand, on the top whereof was an Imperial Crown. The third Banner was richly embroidered with the figures of Jupiter and Juno sitting together in their Majestie, and the troop that followed were young women, none above thirty, their heads adorned with curious Coronets made of Peacocks feathers; their under garments were of Purple, their upper vests of pure Lawn pleated, and fringed with silver, being girt to them with a silver girdle, over which they wore mantles of cloth of silver training upon the ground; their Matron bore in her right hand a mass of gold set with precious stones, on the top whereof was a small figure of Juno cut out of one entire Emerald; she had divers attendants about her, and her mantle was born up by one of the same order; but herself as well as her company, had sandals upon their feet of Crimson Velvet, with laces of silver. After them marched another banner, which by reason of the greatness, was born up by twelve young maids, in which Jupiter sate enthroned with his threefold Scepter, Juno kneeling on a cloud before him, and on the earth a King in his Royal Robes offering up his Crown, with divers people behind him in a devout posture, who by the intercession of that great Queen of heaven, seemed to be recommended to the protection of the Thunderer. Those that followed were maids of admirable beauty, their hair hanging loose, and on their heads Chaplets of flowres; their under garment was of crimson, short before, but very long behind, covered with another of lawne girt close to them, with wide sleeves hanging to their feet, and over that a kind of jacket of silver net close to their bodies, and streight short sleeves as far as the elbow, but a loose skirt cut in panes like scallops, which reached to their knees. These as the others bore tapers in their hands, but sung in a most mournfull tune, yet with a harmony that seemed celestial. Then followed two hundred maids more, four in a rank, little differing in habit from the others, with silver Censors, which smoaking with rich perfumes, they tossed in the air as they marched. The next in order were fifty young women playing upon Ivory Harps, with strings of silver wier, being clad in a close garment of black, over which they wore a short vest of lawn curiously wrought about the skirts, and in every seam with needle work, which reached only to their knees; after whom followed fifty more in the same habit, that played upon several other Instruments, all together making a most excellent consort, which infusing a kind of sorrowfulness into the heart, raised the soul into a divine contemplation; yet in contemplating the celestial quires, no humane fancy could frame a more perfect image of them then what was there represented to the sight. Then came a hundred yong Virgins, none above twelve yeers of age, in long garments of cloth of silver, with wide sleeves, bearing in their hands Olive branches, who likewise in sad notes sang the praises of their Goddes; after whom came a Damsel cloathed in black, on her head a battered Coronet, and in her right hand a broken Scepter. Then followed a Lady of a Majestical presence, her hair flowing upon her shoulders, on her head a Garland of Olive mixed with Roses; her Garment which was close to her body with wide sleeves, and a long train; was made of little plates of silver artificially joyned together like the small scales of fish, over which she wore a Mantle embroidered with pearl, in the Anticque fashion fastened on one shoulder with a large Diamond of great value: Her train was born up by six Virgins of the most eminent quality, besides divers others which attended her; but her self with her eys, and hands held up to Heaven, seemed unmindful of all earthly glory. Immediately after, under a Canopy embroidered with a Sun, whose glistering rays cast a glorious light, supported with twelve staves of Gold, which were born up by twelve Virgins richly habted, followed the Image of Juno all of massie Gold, with a Crown upon her head, enchassed with Precious-Stones of an inestimable value, in her right hand a Scepter, in the other a heart of one entire Rubie hanging at a small chain of Gold, and about her neck, wrists, and waste, great ropes of Oriental Pearl, besides divers other Ornaments, as Tablets of Diamonds, Saphirs, and Emeralds, which altogether made a vast treasure, and testifyed with the greatness, and liberality, the devotion of the doners; but because of the sadness of the occasion, all this glory was shaded over with a vail of thin black Tiffany, which covered her from the head to the feet. Twenty Virgins carryed the Goddess upon their shoulders, fifty more carryed great white Tapors lighted, and two hundred with golden Censors raised a cloud of perfume that encompassed her: after which followed promiscuously a great number of women, by their sad countenances, and the motion of their lips seeming to implore the ayd of their Protectrix against some common calamity. But as soon as they perceived a company of men to encounter them on a suddain they all made a stand, and dividing themselves into two ranks, made a long lane; so that Heraclius had a full view of Juno s image, and of the incomparable Lady, who stood in a devout posture before the shrine, when immediately he perceived the damsel cloathed in black, advance towards him, and being come within convenient distance, she asked whether the General Heraclius was present amongst them; who stepping forward said, Beautiful maid, If to him you have ought to deliver, he stands here read to Answer your demands; when falling upon her knees with tears in her eys she thus began. Most redoubted Lord, my doleful Lady, the no less vertuous, then beautiful Agnesia , sole heir to the great Conar , the last surviver of our unfortunate Princes, whom now in a hostile manner you persecute, by me, who bear these ensignes of an oppressed Royalty, surrenders her self, and this dejected company, who are willing to follow her fortune, into your protection, humbly desiring she may be admitted into your presence; which reasonable request she supposeth you will not deny to a Lady of her birth, though the daughter of an enemy, and by the power of your Arms now reduced into a most deplorable condition. When raising her up he replyed. Ill were the power of my Arms employed, and I should esteem that victory a scandal to my honor, by which either Beauty, or Vertue, were oppressed, and if your Lady accompanyed with those Graces seek here for protection, she may not onely command my presence, but you may likewise give her assurance, that even my life is devoted to her service. Whereupon the Damsel making a low reverence, without any reply hasted back to her Lady; who as soon as she had received this joyful message, turning about, and prostrating her self before the Goddess, after a short Orison for a happy success to her undertaking, with a modest pace, attended only by the same damsel, and some principal young Virgins, moved towards Heraclius , who hasting to meet her, as soon as they had a distinct view of each others perfections, they both were sensible of unexpected passions. Heraclius spirits retiring to his heart, he looked pale, and felt a trembling in his flesh; but Agnesia's blood starting into her face, made her cheeks sensible of that flame which was on a suddain kindled in her heart. Then Heraclius blushing that he had appeared so unmanly, and Agnesia trembling through an apprehension that she had betrayed too much of woman, by the often changing of their colour, they discovered the secret agitations of their minds, yet both were so amazed that neither perceived the others alteration; but Heraclius first recovering out of his trance, offered humbly to kiss her hand, which she by no means permitting thus addressed her speech to him. Noble Heraclius the Ceremonious respect you are pleased to shew to me, as to a woman, I wish rather may be converted to a real compassion of these my compassions, and my sufferings. That I am the daughter of the unfortunate Conar , you are not ignorant, but I retain an honour above that my virgin purity: These you see are likewise professed votaries to chastity, and those that follow after us the chaste wives and matrons of the neighbouring City, all devout reverencers of that sacred figure of the Celestial Juno , which we hold in the greater veneration, because it was not formed by the art or industry of man, but he who had undertaken the work, finding his fancy incapable to comprehend such an excellence as might represent the perfections of that great Queen of the Universe, devoutly invoking the assistance of the Gods to aid him in his endeavours, was instantly surprised with a heavy slumber, and waking, found the Image formed in that heavenly shape, which as a present from the Divine Powers, being forthwith transferred into a sumptuous Temple, by the piety of our Ancesters, prepared for it, the place hath ever since been especially honoured by the presence of the Goddess, as hath convincingly appeared by the effectual operation of divers admirable miracles, nor was that the least, of which we our selves are late witneses, when the Goddess, vouchsafing to forewarn us of these our present calamities, this her sacred Image was seen many days together continually to weep. But perhaps I recount these supernatural effects to persons incredulous of such divine mysteries; however our wretchedness is so obvious to every sense, as cannot but gain a credit in the relation, and may beget a compassion in the most barbarous enemy, much more in the generous breast of so noble a Conquerer. For it so happened immediately after the late encounter, wherein the chiefest of our youth signalized the nobleness of their courage with their blood, that our troops disheartned with their fall, being at length forced to a shamefull flight, the runaways to palliat the ignominy of their cowardise, made such a terrible relation of the invincible valour of the Sicilians to the rest of the Army, that of twenty thousand men, who lay encamped without the City, in less then an hours space, being overcome by their own fears, not any remained for the defence thereof, except some few of the principal Commanders, who, notwithstanding all their endeavours, finding themselves so abandoned by their souldiers, hasted to the Palace to advertise their Prince of his peoples disloyalty. Whereupon his Highness immediately taking horse, with an intent, if it were possible, either by perswasions or threats, to bring them back again to the defence of their Country, this sad disaster was so quickly bruited among the inhabitants, that perceiving the soldiers precipitate flight and beleiving their Prince had likewise forsaken them, being struck with a pannick feare, all the men, both old and young, that were able so to secure themselvs, and even the Preists, who by hollowed vows, are obliged to attend at the Altars, ran headlong out of the gates, to lurk for safety in the adjacent Woods, and Mountains. The Mothers tears, the VVifes embraces, the lamentable cryes of tender infants, nor the reverence due to the supreme Powers, could not fortifie them with a resolution, rather to dye manfully in the discharge of those natural, pious Obligations, then most unnaturally, and impiously, in seeking refuge amongst beasts to relinquish the protection of the Gods. In this confusion, ignorant of what had passed, I returned from the Temple, accompanyed onely with a small traine of Ladies, when I found the streets filled with multitudes of women running distractedly up and down; some weeping over their children, some tearing their hair, and wringing their hands, and others though more patient in their griefs, ready to expire with the anguish thereof, but all irresolute, whether they should by laying violent hands upon themselves, and their Infants, put a period to their miseries, or else by following their fugitive friends, perish with them by a languishing death. Thus whilst some exclaimed against the unkindness of their dearest Allies, others reproached the vild timerousness of the Prince and Souldiers, and all in general bewailed the cruelty of their own destiny, at length understanding perfectly the cause of their lamentations, being inspired by the Goddess, I ascended a high Tribunal in the chief place where on certain days the Magistrate gives publike audience to the people, whether they al presently flockt about me, and having with much difficulty obtained hearing, after some few arguments to excuse my fathers so hasty leaving the City, having assured them if they would follow my example, either to lead them on by a glorious fal to terminate their sufferings, or else to restore them to their former happiness, with these promises, together with the respect and affection that they bore to me as their natural Princess, they were perswaded to return quietly to their houses, and with patience three days onely to expect the return of our Prince, our kinsmen and Allies; which being expired, and having not heard the least news what is become of them, now truly disdaining either the Empire, or Society of such pusillanimous men, with a general consent we submit our selves as Vassals to that power, the onely report whereof hath already vanquished our Armies: Yet with these conditions, That our Chastities may be preserved inviolate; The holy residences of these Votaries remain protected from the rapine of your souldiers; and the sacred Temple of our Goddess not be prophaned, or polluted by the irreligious contemners of her Deity: Otherwise rather then to suffer our own dishonor, or to be the wretched spectators of any impious violence which may be offered to that Heavenly Image, in contempt of your power we come thus prepared both to prevent your tyranny, and by a voluntary Martyrdom to appease the anger of the incensed Gods. When on a suddain, and at the same instant both her self, and all the rest drawing out of their sleeves short poignards, the points whereof of they directed against their own breasts, pawsing a little, in that fatal posture, they expected the answer of Haraclius . But he without any demur falling presently on his knees, and laying one hand on Agnesias poignard, besought her, that if from him she apprehended any violation of her honor, that she would rather by his death secure her fears, then through a diffidence of the Conquest her Vertue had made leave his memory infamous to posterity. When raising himself up, and having a while considered such a multitude of Beauties, and in Agnesias person the amassed perfections of the whole multitude; You have conquered, said he, most excellent Lady; The Invaders of your Country, will henceforth become the Champions of your Liberty, and either Theodora shall by remitting the punishment of this late revolt confirm to your Nation their ancient priviledges, or I will my self armed in your defence undertake the protection of your cause. Return therefore triumphant to the City with your holy Band, and recall thither your Prince, your Husbands, and your friends, and despise not their society, who by the chance of warr being subdued, and through a fear in such occurrences incident to humane nature flying the supposed fury of a Conqueror, have lost nothing of their own honor, and given such a glorious occasion to the whole world to celebrate the fame of your Heroick vertues; which will spread so far, that as the Amazonian Queen to raise an issue worthy of her self, incited by the report of his matchless Valour, through many Regions, sought the embraces of the renowned Alexander , so the remotest Monarchs of the earth, hearing the relation of this noble enterprise, will contendingly submit their Crowns to these Virgins, that the glory of them may be preserved in their posterity: But to your self the great example of so magnanimous an action, none must dare to aspire, but he who by an invincible vertue shall acquire the Empire of the Universe. I know not by what tradition you have received the story of your miraculous Image, but Nature hath in your self formed so excellent a shape, a beauty so transcendent, and the whole composure adorned with such heavenly endowments, as if at the same time, in villification of the supreme powers, she meant to ensnare men in Idolatry. But since you so superstitiously reverence the shadow of a Deity, I may certainly with less offence adore a mortal deifyed with such real perfections. Therefore you may henceforth remain as secure from any attempt by us against your divine person, your Patriots, or those things which you esteem sacred, as the Temples, and Altars of your Gods are from being prophaned, or destroyed by their own Priests. This more then expected Grace; abundantly satisfyed Agnesia, as concerning the success of her designe: But she who preferring her Countries honor above her life, came fortifyed with a resolution to defye the strength of a whole army, now inspired with gentler thoughts, neither mindful of Country, nor friends, nor the terror of those dangers so lately passed, through a compassion of her self desired to live, yet not to live unless pittyed by that enemy, whose power she had before despised: And though Heraclius had sufficiently discovered the passions of his mind, yet innocent love ignorant how to extract any assured hopes out of artificial expressions, though she thought he had given her attributes far exceding her merit, yet imputing all to Courtship, she could hardly believe he was an affectionate lover, and when through a self kindnes she would, have interpreted his words in favour of her desires, the remembrance of Theodoras greatnes, and the fame of their contracted vowes, so confounded those imaginations, that rage, dispair, and emulation with an united strength combating the sole support of a vertuous minde, if Honor and Chastity had not repelled the fierceness of their invasion, would perhaps have forced a yielding to those violent transportations. But Reason being now agen placed in its proper sphere, with a heart full of generous thoughts, and the beams darted from her eys, dissipating all cloudes of discontent, like a triumphing Conqueror, to secure a submissive enemy from his fears, she first threw away her mortal weapon, and then thus replyed. Theodora's insatiate ambition of rule will be soon satisfied through your generosity, for to be thus vanquished, all Nations will esteem as a certain foundation of their liberty, unless through the fond opinion of a servile loyalty, by suffering your vertue to be made the instrument of her tyrannical oppression, you stain the glory of your Conquests. However if you so dispose of us, we must now to her render a passive obedience, but I believe the Immortal Juno , who in compassion of our long sufferings inspired you with such a generous clemency, hath likewise chosen you to be the Author, and preserver of our future felicity, and remember that Agnesia though a feeble Virgin, deserted by her father and his people, armed with a resolution to despise the power of Theodora though supported by the prowess of Heraclius , yielded not her self, as her slave, but the sole prize of his incomparable Vertue. When blushing that she had said so much, yet continuing her speech, on a suddain upon the side of a hill descending into the plain, their appeared advancing towards them a numerous Army, for Conar having collected together his scattered Troops, and being besides animated with a fresh supply of his confederates returned to the City but finding it desolate, and supposing the Sicilians by the advantage of his absence had led his daughter; and the inhabitants into captivity, inraged with the disgrace, he resolved either to free them agen, or else to perish in the enterprise; and their march being likewise perceived by the Sentinels from the Castle of Oristagnuns , the Commanders not attending any order, fearing a surprisal, issued out with a considerable force, to the defence of their General, which moving a jealousie on either side of some intended stratagem, yet each party apprehending even more then death it self, to be thought guilty of so vile a treachery, they awhile gazed upon each other without uttering a word; but Heraclius fearing his men would advance too far, lest in an ignorant zeal, violence might be offered to the Ladies, without any reply, hasted to withstand their attempt, yet if need were to defend himself from the attempt of the enemy. But Agnesia by his abrupt departure, judging her self already condemned as a Traitor, with a perplexed mind remained doubtfull, whether to justifie her innocence she should follow Heraclius , or else to prevent the mischief of a fatal encounter, carry the joyfull tidings to her friends, who she saw were come to her rescue, of the happily contracted Peace. Nevertheless, Love, not yet grown an absolute Tyrant, permitting a consideration of the event, though it were an anguish to her soul to remain so long suspected as the Agent of a contrived treachery, yet reflecting on the dangerous ruine both of her life and honour, through an unhappy misprision on either side, she with all the Virgins, chaunting the praises of their Goddess , as the author of this success, but ignorant what sacrifices they ought to have offer'd to the God of Love, in the same solemn manner of procession, returned towards the Princes host, who being fully informed of all that had passed, no less admiring his sisters matchless resolution, then the transcendent humanity of Heraclius ; presently commanding his Army to face, about, with general acclamations of joy, they returned to the quiet possession of their City; and Heraclius when he perceived they were marched away, dismissing likewise his Souldiers to their several stations, retired to commune with his own thoughts. On the one side they represented to him Agnesias youthfull beauty, accompanied with such an undaunted courage, yet governed by the mildness of a modest chastity; on the other the mature graces of Theodora , with an equal greatness of mind, but subject to all the passions of an unbridled appetite; the one innocent of what she desierd, the other so full of those desires that were destructive to innocence; the one tyed to him by the band of a holy vow; himself united to the other by the sacred power of Love, and both, though through a different influence, threatning the period of his fate, he proposed to himself all the waies immaginable how to evade those difficulties into which his cross fortune had plunged him, and at length with the preservation of his honour to compass his desires. In which perplexity he remained altogether irresolute, till the next day Conar accompanied only with half a dozen of his chief Nobility ariving unexpectedly about a furlong from Oristagnum , without any ceremony or safe conduct, desired admittance to a parley: whereupon Heraclius advertised of his coming, with the like number went to meet him, and after the first salutations were past, retiring a good distance from their followers, they entred into privat conference; the effect whereof was never known to any; only it was observed that they parted with great demonstrations of kindness on either side, and Heraclius assumed a more contented countenance then usually he had shewn in many daies before; which Ergastrix perceiving pressed him to resolve his friends concerning their late consultation, and omitting no occasion to incense him against Theodora , produced fresh Letters of the immoderate favours she bestowed upon her new minion Arsidas . At the perusal whereof, with a disdainfull smile, he replyed, The resolution is already taken; I will not by invading my Country, blemish the renown of my Ancestors with the reproach of disloyalty, but by maintaining my faith, punish the infidelity of this perfidious Queen. To be short, I am determined privatly to imbarque for Sicily , and let none examin the drift of my intention, but that my absence may not be known in the Army, give it out that I am detained in my bed by an access of feaver: In the mean while to Callisthenes, Clytas and Lysias , with this caution, that by no means they offend the Sardinians , I commit the government of all affairs; to you the care presently to provide a Vessel, and my self will so manage the rest, that at my return, which if I prosper in my designes, shall be no less sudden then my departure, those friends who have been faithfull to me, shall participate of the glory; but if I miscarry, be now way involved in my disgraces. Having thus disposed of all things in order to his intentions, within a few daies after in the habit of a Souldier, attended only by two trusty servants, he set sail, and guided by a favourable wind, in a short time arrived in the road of Palermo , upon the Western coast of Sicily , where Theodora being then in her Summers progress, recreated her self with the pleasant situation of the place, and to vary her delights, at the same time that Heraclius ship cast anchor, she was in her barge upon the sea, to enjoy the coolness of the evening. When supposing by her equipage it could be none but the Queen, presently descending into a small skiff, he intended to go on land, yet as he passed, if it were possible, to take a view of Theodora and her company, but being almost within convenient distance, the gang to shew their address, beginning to row cheerfully with all their force, ignorant of the Steersmans treachery, who as the bruit present ran, was by some of Aurelias faction suborned to that treason, the barge ran so violently against a rock, that her keel being broken, the Queen her self with Arsidas , and the Ladies that accompanied her, were all exposed to the mercy of the Ocean. Whereupon he hasted to their relief, but Arsidas unskilfull in swimming, was presently drowned, and the rest every one in such an exigence preferring their own safety, hanging about her sides endangered the oversetting of the skiff, which Heraclius perceiving, and that Theodora by the help only of a small plank, being as yet preserved, cryed out for assistance, casting away his garments he plunged himself into the main, and with a manly strength lanching forward to the distressed Queen, with the one hand he supported her under the arm, and with the other, like another Neptune to preserve the Queen of his most beloved Island, guided both himself and her, being somewhat assisted by the plank, safe to the shore, from whence a timely assistance was sent to those Ladies that yet hung strugling about the skiff; but when the manner of this accident was related, all grew into a horrible confusion, with terrible threats and exclamations against the authors of so foul a Treason. Nevertheless the Court being again appeased, and the astonishment of the danger a little past, Theodora knew not whether she should most lament the death of Arsidas , or that she was now again preserved by Heraclius ; yet questionless the remembrance of past obligations, the nobleness of his person, and this present deliverance had restored him again entirely to her favour, especially now his corival was gon, if Glaucus and Pausanias , two chief Councellors, who because they could not imitate his vertues, envied his advancement, having by their spies intelligence of all that passed, had not malitiously suggested that his excessive greatness began to grow dangerous to the State, and already menaced a destruction of the Royal Authority; for if his ambition were not boundless, why did he not content himself to remain in his Government of Sardinia till it had pleased her Majestie to recall him home to greater honours; or if his designes were not pernicious, why in such a manner did he come away; but that which most manifesteth his high aspiring mind, was the assuming to himself such a soveraign power, as of his own head to grant a peace to Rebels, and without the privity of the Councel, to entertain a Conference with a publique Enemy. Which Objections were so aggravated with politick recriminations, that instead of a reception answerable to the merit of so notorious a service, one morning as he entered into the Palace he was by a suddain surprisal disarmed, and by the guards conveyed to a strict prison, where notwithstanding the earnest endeavours of secret friends, finding it impossible to gain access to the Queen, and by this violent proceeding confirmed in the Opinion that she had cancelled the Bond of all former Obligations, the remembrance of Agnesia's beauty wholly possessing his affections, and the known malice of his enemies, representing to him his present danger, He began for her sake more studiously to think of his own preservation; and by promise of large rewards, so entirely gained Cardonius , Captain of the prison, that the second night after he made an escape, and though with some difficulty in a short time after returned undiscovered towards Sardinia , hoping by the fidelity of his friends, there to arrive in a secure port, from whence he might upon a gentle stream sail to the embraces of Agnesia , whose hereditary right would possess him of a Kingdom, and her fathers forces united with his own, invest him with a power to oppose the Tyranny of Theodora . But those instruments who with such dexterity wrought his disgrace, being no less diligent at the same time to secure the obedience of that Army; had instantly dispatched Cleomenes , of their Partizans, with a large Commission from the Queen, to assume the charge thereof; who at his first arrival at Oristagnum , presently secured the persons of Calisthenes, Clytus , and Lysias , with all others who were thought favourers of his designs, and then in a long studyed Oration laid such horrible Treasons to his charge, that the souldiery remained for the most part satisfyed with those transactions; and those whose affections, nor Faith, would not admit of any alteration, Heraclius being absent, and his chief friends under restraint, being destitute of Councel, fearing to act against their own interest, in expectation of another, submitted to the present change. Nevertheless Ergastrix as he was more vigilant then the rest, and his power to hurt not so much regarded, escaping the persecution of Cleomenes , easily procured a barque to transport him into Sicily , and having advanced some few Leagues from the shoar, happily encountred his Masters, who being desirous to learn the news of Sardinia , boarded his vessel, and was not a little astonished to meet so accidentally his faithful servant, but understanding by him the state of his affairs, and how his designs were traversed by Cleomenes , without any long deliberation altering his course, he steered directly for Sardinia ; where being received with exceeding honor by Conar, Agnesias gracious deportment, added hopes so correspondent to his desires, that he believed he might without offence discover the ardency of his affection; which was so acceptable on the other side, that the nuptials were forthwith celebrated with all the pomp due to the birth of so great a Princess, and the mannagement of the war, being then resolved on as necessary, was wholly committed to his direction. This news flew quickly to Oristagnum , which caused a suddain disorder in Cleomenes Army, for a considerable party that only watched an opportunity to express their zeal to their former General, separating themselves from the rest, forced their way through the Guards, to the Tower, where Calisthenes with his other adherents were imprisoned, and having set them at liberty, marched triumphantly with Colours' displayed to Heraclius Camp, offering with their lives to secure him from the persecution of his enemies, and he with this suddain addition of force was so elevated, that he now esteemed himself beyond the reach, or malice, of fortune. On the other side Cleomenes giving advertizement of this unexpected defection into Sicily , was presently supplyed with fresh recruits, wherupon knowing his greatness was inconsistent with his enemies, he took the field, with a resolution to give him battail, which was joyfully accepted by Heraclius , but in the encounter, the circumstances whereof would be tedious to relate, the Sicilians on Heraclius party fighting gallantly, being all slain, the Sardinians were soon totally routed, by which defeat their Country remained afterwards annexed to the Sicilian Crown, and their Prince, and people the slaves of the Conquerors: But my unfortunate Father seeking a noble death amongst his enemies, performed actions, which though I spare to mention, succeeding ages will admire, yet being overpressed with multitudes, he vvas at length taken Prisoner, and as a sure token of an entire victory, sent vvith a strong guard into Sicily , vvhere Glaucus and Pausanias , fearing time might mitigate the Queens indignation caused his Process to be presently dispatched, and the Judges being all of the same Cabal, vvithout consideration of his many glorious atchievements, they condemned him to an ignominious death, vvhich being the sentence of a partial Fiction, the relenting people, vvith a general murmur, voted the Authors thereof the greater malefactors. But they, vvho about the same time, had barbarously embrewed their hands in the sacred blood of Aurelia , vvhich vvas a horrid example for future ages to violate the dignitie of Princes, having brought Heraclius so neer the Scaffold, thought all delays dangerous until they had delivered him into the hands of the Executioner. Nevertheless Theodora , vvho though she dissembled her inclinations, vvas of a haughty, insolent spirit, and no less unconstant then cruel in her resolutions, through a disdain as some supposed, that the person vvhom she had once destined to her bed, should by an infamous fall, be laid in an obscure Grave, for the present suspended the Execution, vvhich made others conceive, that hovvever, by the persvvasion of his adversaries, vvho pretended her safety, she had suffered them to proceed to this tryal, and condemnation, yet she did it only to submit him to her povver, and that some sparks of her former love still remaining, began to kindle a nevv flame, vvhich if he vvould have absolutely humbled himself, and acknovvledging his fault, have repudiated Agnesia , might have lighted the Torches to his second Hymeneals. But those vvho best knevv the Nature of her disposition, believed she did indeed desire his submission, but vvith an intent only to insult over his misfortunes, or if she suffered him to live, to let him knovv he lived only by her Grace, and that she vvas abundantly acquit of all past Obligations, in shevving so unusual a clemency, to so great an offender; vvhereas the best of his services could pretend to no other esteem then as the duties of a subject so highly obliged by his Prince, nor to no farther revvard then the acknovvledgemen of his loyalty. This was the conceit of the best judgements, and Heraclius himself concurred in the same opinion, wherefore besides his unalterable affection to Agnesia , rather then to submit, he resolved to entertain death, without any shew of a servile fear, and though some perswaded him to implore the mercy of his Soveraign, and intimations were given him even from the Queen her self, that if he would conform to the compliance of a submissive subject, he might expect the mercy of a gracious Princess, yet he would never condescend to owe his life to that person, who had so manifestly outraged his honor. Notwithstanding the pitteous lamentations of Agnesia , who was then young with child of me, and who, if he died, vowed her own destruction, so shaked his resolutions, that the evening before he suffered, he sent privatly for Despina one of the Ladies of the bed-chamber, who being highly regarded by the Queen, was acquainted with many passages of their former love. To her therefore with many conjurations of secrecy, he delivered that pledge of a perpetual Union, the divided Ring, which in his greatest perils Theodora had obliged him to send her, with a solemn protestation, that she would interpose the whole power, of her Kingdom, and even her own life between him and danger; beseeching her if she tendered his life, with all the speed that was possible to convey it to her, and his once most gracious Mistress, not doubting it might produce effects suitable to her own desires. Despina seemed very joyfull of this occasion to serve him, but like a true Courtier following the vogue of the times, when Heraclius began to decline, she had received the addresses of Glaucus , who being one of Arsidas familiars, and of the then prevalent faction, he so far ingratiated himself into her favour, that to comply with him, having stained the honour of her husbands bed, she thought it no crime to betray to him the secrets of a despicable friend. So that instead of delivering the half Ring to Theodora , to oblige him the more to her, she carried it immediately to her servant Glaucus , with a full relation of all other passages, who giving her infinite thanks for so great a discovery, charmed her by all the endeerments of their secret love to an everlasting silence, and early the next morning, with Pausanias , posting to the Queen, pressed her with divers arguments to secure her self from many eminent dangers, and her faithful Councellors from their perpetual fears, by delivering at length the publique enemy into the hands of Justice, who had not only lived a contemner of her Authority, but being legally convicted of most enormous Treasons had neither acknowledged his guilt, nor once vouchsafed to sue to her for mercy; but on the contrary, boasting of his own innocence, vauntingly affirmed, even to the scandal of her Majesties honour, that though he knew a certain means to secure his life, yet he would rather suffer a thousand deaths, then not leave a testimony to the world, that he despised both her favour aud her power. This allegation had so strong an influence upon the womanish humour of Theodora , who more then any thing, resented a contempt, that to punish his arrogance, as she termed it, she condesended to their desires, whereupon not expecting any further Commission, or Warrant for their proceedings, they hasted to the prison, and to prevent a second reluctance, caused him inhumanly to be dragged out of his bed to the common place of execution, where being spectators of his fall, they did not more glory in their cruelty, then he by a generous contempt of the world, triumphing over their malice, and even death it self, with a chearful alacrity exposed his neck to that fatal stroak, which though at once it deprived him of life, and separated him from his dear Agnesia , yet could not be said to shed his bloud, since it so firmly cemented the affections of the people, both to her and his posterity, that though deprived of her Country, she was ever after honoured by them as a Princess, and her son since with the Title of their General. But though I pass over the griefs of Agnesia as altogether unspeakable, it were too great an omission, and even a transgression against the providence of the supream Justice, to seem forgetful of the last Scene of this woful Tragedy. Despina within the compass of a few moneths was seised by a violent Feaver, in the ravings whereof, she often cryed out upon Heraclius , as if he had been present by her bed; and at length desiring to speak with the Queen, delivering the Ring, revealed her Treachery, and immediately thereupon delivered up the ghost, not without many bitter curses and exclamations of Theodora , who either through a real regret of her ingratitude, or else through a vexation of mind, to be so deprived of her hopes in the submission of Heraclius , passed the rest of her daies in a languishing discontent, and before the year expired, often sighing out the names of Aurelia , and Heraclius , at length breathed forth her soul; and those torments of conscience that accompanied her to the end, being generally interpreted to proceed from a tenderness of compassion, the effects of her tyrannical cruelty, were wholly imputed to her Ministers, and to her self the glorious, and still lasting titles, of the most Pious, Just, and Merciful of Princes. End of the Fifth Book. THEOPHANIA BOOK VI. lamented the loss of so beloved a Princess, Seleucus , son to Aurelia , King of Cyprus , as her undoubted successor, with no less acclamations of joy, was solemnly invested with the Regal Authority, who to endear himself to his new Subjects with a shew of mildness, amongst other acts of grace, to sweeten the beginning of his Government, reestablished Agnesia in a great part of my fathers possessions, that by his conviction were seised upon for the Crown, which was so far a comfort in her afflictions, that the issue of Heraclius , for whose preservation only she was content to live, should not be exposed to the miseries of a necessitous fortune; and having about that time brought me into the world, her care of my education was such as suited to the tenderness of a mother of an only child, the son of so beloved a husband. But assoon as I grew up to any shew of capacity, to ease her griefs, with weeping eys, she continually entertained me, from my childhood, with this sad story of our misfortunes, which then made such an impression, that though being over-worn with sorrow, she ended this life before I had attained to the thirteenth year of my age, yet I still retain so perfectly in memory every particular passage thereof: Besides, after her death, the care of my youth being committed to the tuition of Veveus, an intimate friend to my deceased father, who sharing in his disgraces, lead a retired life in the Country, he in that sollitude punctually related to me those secret transactions between Heraclius and the Queen, with the inveterate hatred of his malicious enemies, not to incite me to a revenge, but on the contrary, by so great an example, to arm me against the various uncertain changes of the world and foreseeing I should not be favoured at the Court, instructed me with principles of Philosophy, to suit my mind to the present condition of my fortunes, which I easily comprehending, applyed my self wholly to martial exercises, or those harmless recreations of hunting, hawking, and racing, which so unbend the mind from any great thoughts, that the lovers of them, for the most part, become incapable of any other imployment. But neither that retirement, his excellent precepts, nor these divertisements could defend me from the resistless power of love. For Lysimacus , a person highly esteemed by the King, being appointed Governor of our Province, the Inhabitants of Nicosia , the capital City prepared to entertain him with that honour which was due to the dignity of his place, and one in such special favour with his Prince. Wherefore being advertised of the time of his arrival, and that he brought with him, accompanied with an illustrious train, his Lady, and two daughters of a renowned beauty, being swayed by a cross fate, I was so transported with a desire to be a spectator of those triumphs, that communicating my design to Parmenio , one of my most familiar companions, and finding him possessed with the same inclinations, we went privatly together to Nicosia , where the first night of our coming, at a publique ball, though unknown, we had a full survey of all the choice beauties in the Country; but the two sisters, Belinda and Artemia were adorned with such admirable graces, that the whole assembly receiving lustre from their motions, all the delights ordained for mankind, seemed to move in that circle as in their proper sphear. Belinda the elder though not more mature in perfections, was by the Kings mediation already espoused to an ancient Lord, who by his meritorious services deserved no less a reward; but so unequal to her in years, that it was not probable she could entertain his embraces with that content which was necessary in the conjunction, to satisfie his hopes, in raising an heir to his Family; and indeed, though she had complyed with the commands of authority, it appeared too evidently, by exposing her self to the Courtship of others, that she had not pleased her own fancy in the choice of a husband: But Artemia was so tender a Virgin, that though she were desired of all, nevertheless being thought incapable of the impressions, she was not yet acquainted with the assaults of love. The contemplation of this Saintlike innocence so diverted my thoughts from all other objects, that I observed not with what delight Parmenio's eyes followed the motion of Belindas , but perceiving her so open to all addresses, he fancied such a success to his new desires, that he had leasure enough to mark with what a greedy appetite I sucked in that poyson, the infection whereof hath since spread with such a rancorous aspersion upon my honour. But alas! how can man avoid the perversness of the fates, since from his birth he is ordained to pursue those means which submit him to their decrees? I saw Artemia , I admired her beauty, her innocent behaviour even ravished my thoughts with the contemplation of her growing vertues, and by envying their happiness who had the honour to approach her person, though ignorant of such passions, I knew I loved her, and loving her, with a restless anxiety of mind employed all the arts a Lover could invent to betray my self to my own ruine, in which I was so successful, that having found the means to discover the fervency of my passion, I met with such a reciprocal concurrence of affection, that in short, for I will not detain you with a narration of the circumstances, I approached in my conceit to the fruition of all earthly happiness; for the example of her sisters disproportioned match, which I failed not to enforce, rendring her more plyant to my desires, we were solemnly contracted in the presence of Parmenio and Hortensia her confident attendant, who were privy to all our proceedings. Nevertheless because Lysimacus fortunes depended wholly upon the Court, doubting, lest he might seem to favour his cause, he would not easily consent to bestow his daughter upon the son of him that had suffered as a Traitor; that no opposition might traverse our joyes, we resolved, having performed the rites, secretly to consummate the marriage: And things were at length brought to such a point, that nothing wanted to the accomplishment of our wishes, but the period of all wishes, an oportunity to perfect our felicity, in the mutual blisses of the sacred nuptial bed. In this difficulty Hortensia her confident nurse used such dexterity, that soon after, having one night concealed my self in the Governors Palace, the Court being all at rest, I was secretly conveyed into Artemias Chamber, where meeting no opposition, but a yielding Virgins modesty, I soon entred, like a triumphant Conqueror into the Fort of Love; but had scarce taken possession of that inestimable treasure, which all the graces, her faithfull attendants, had then been fourteen years amassing together, when suddenly the whole Palace being filled with a confused noise; Hortensia as one amazed came running into the chamber, and trembling, told us, that her old Lady Calista , with Belinda and their maids, by what accident raised out of their beds, she knew not, were coming towards the Lodging. You may easily imagin such an unexpected alarm struck terrible apprehensions into the poor Artemia , who notwithstanding my best perswasions to assure her against the encounter, sunk down upon her pillow in a swound; at which sight, though resolved to justifie the action, yet moved with a tenderness of compassion, I cast such a vengfull regard upon Hortensia , that she easily understood I believed her treachery to be the cause of that mischief, whereat either offended, or thinking it necessary to shew her innocence, having recollected her self, and being aided by her womans wit, ever excellent in such occurrences, without any shew of perplexity, it is now no time, said she, to talk, or by frivolous protestations to seek to remove your suspition; if you can shift for your self, leave to me the care of my Mistress honor, and of my own justification. Whereupon with a great lighted Taper that she had in her hand, in an instant she put fire to the curtains, and to the other combustible things either about the bed or the Chamber, and taking the half dead Artemia in her arms, ran hastily with her towards the next room, which fell out so seasonably, that just at the dore meeting Calista , without any stay, thrusting by her, she cryed out, Alas Madam! what do you here? If you regard your own safety, or my Mistress life, let us convey her quickly to some more open place, for what with the smoak and the flames, that I know not by what mischance have seised upon our Chamber, she is almost stifled, and if by chance sitting up late I had not the sooner perceived it, she had undoubtedly perished in the fire. Which by what they had seen, being already affrighted, bore such an appearance of truth, that none suspecting the deceit, they hasted again to Belindas appartment, where by their diligence Artemia soon recovered her sense, and was presently so carefully instructed by Hortensia , that not any of them imagined the true cause of her distemper. In the mean while, when I perceived the Nurses subtile intention, and withall heard what he had said to the Ladies, I was so altered in my opinion both of her fidelity and address, that I was in no further pain for Artemia , but conveying my self our of her Lodging, under the same disguise that I had entred, the distraction was so great, that I easily mingled amongst the croud without any danger of suspition. The occasion of this uproar was a tumult amongst the Country people, who having a little before had a new Tax laid upon them, though in it self very easie, yet being unaccustomed to such impositions, thinking the pressure thereof insupportable, they ran in multitudes to Nicosia , hoping either through entreaties or fear to force Lysimacus , being scarce in possession of his Government, to discharge them of that burden, and the better to effect their desires, knowing the advenues of the City, at a certain place where the Wall was decayed, entered at that dead time of the night, without being perceived either by the Watch, which in a time of peace was but slight, or any of the inhabitants, who slept securely under the protection of their careless guards, untill having possessed themselves of the Magazine, the Souldiers that escaped their fury gave the alarm, which being unexpected, was so much the more terrible, and the Peasans being by this time Masters of all the Ports, none durst stir to make any resistance; but the Citizens running distractedly to the Palace, had raised the Governor, who by their confused relation, not understanding rightly the cause of their fears, nor perceiving any thing as yet but clamor and disorder, assembling his guards, stood only in a posture of defence, in expectation of the day, whilst Calista more apprehensive of danger, having raised her daughters, intended to retire with them to some place in the Palace, that might best secure them from the outrage of any sudden attempt. But the flames by this time bursting out from Artemias lodging, caused a second confusion, at the sight thereof a general cry running amongst them, that they were miserably betrayed to an inevitable destruction, and they were so possessed with the horror of their present danger, that death was the least of their apprehension. Nevertheless Lysimacus , whose courage had advanced him to eminent honours, being accustomed to perils, with an unaltered temper, endeavoured to allay the tumult, and having by his example animated them to a better assurance, first gave order to quench the fire, and then sent a party of his most resolute men, amongst whom I intruded my self, towards the chief Market-place, where finding none to encounter them, they made a stand in expectation of a further order. This pause gave me time to retire to my Lodging, where being presently armed, and well mounted, I returned again to the Governor with the offer of my service in this unexpected occasion, which he accepting with his usual civility, and day by this time appearing, I marched out of the Palace to discover the cause of this sudden uproar: But before I had passed through one street, the party which was first sent out, being beaten from their Post by the Rebels, fled in such haste and disorder, that if I had not happily withstood them in their carreer, Lysimacus having so small a force, must of necessity have submitted to the licentious will of an incensed rabble; but having encouraged them to a second attaque, the pursuers began quickly to retire; in which action, though my service might perhaps merit from the King, it was from none but Artemia that I expected the reward, whose beauty only was of that power to animate me to such a performance. O that she, whose outward graces had then so strong an influence to repel the rage of a lawless multitude, had not afterward so much vertue within her self, to give the Law to the unruly appetite of one single man, or rather of an impuissant effeminate Courtier. But she being yet guiltless, her Champion fighting under the protection of her innocence, soon gave those Traitors the chastisement due to their delinquency, and afterwards though they compassed not their ends, they obtained what they less expected, not only a free pardon of their offence, but a promise that their complaints should be favourably recommended to the King: with which they were so well satisfied, that returning again to their several Villages, they infinitly extolled the justice and clemency of their Governor. This tumult thus appeased, Lysimacus spent some daies in rectifying the disorders of the Province, that the Government being well settled, he might return again to Palermo , in which interim though I had frequent access to Artemia , yet since the late accident, being lodged in Belindas appartment, it was impossible to enjoy that privacy of conversation which the united hearts of the chastest lovers are priviledged to desire. Wherefore knowing her departure would be sudden, and that the air of the Court was not my proper element, rather then to be separated from my happiness; or by appearing at Palermo , to revive the remembrance of my fathers disgraces, I resolved publickly to avow our marriage; yet doubting Artemia , who had ever been bred up in an awfull obedience to her parents, being young and timerous, would through fear of their displeasure, oppose my proceedings, without acquainting her with my intentions, I went directly to Lysimacus, whose many obliging civilities since the suppression of the Rebels, encouraged me to reveal my secret first to him. With this resolution entring into his Chamber, I found him, having newly received a Packet from the Court, giving order for his removal the next day; and before I could find an oportunity to utter my mind, taking me by the hand he retired into his Cabinet, and after many endearing professions of kindness, said, If you have been rightly informed of my actions, you have no reason to esteem me an enemy of your Family; On the contrary, as I lamented your fathers fall, so I should rejoyce to see you advanced to such a height, that you may be above the reach of his persecuters; wherefore since your own vertue hath opened you a way to those honors which belong to your birth, neglect not the means, by pursuing of glory, to establish your security, and that you may perceive I intend more then a superficial complement, peruse this letter, and according to the contents, judge how forward I shall be, by advancing your hopes, to confirm you in a beleif of the sincerity of my intentions. Wherupon putting a paper into my hand, he immediatly returned again to the company, leaving me full of amazed thoughts, to what end this discourse should tend; but having unfolded it, I perceived it was a Letter from the King, the contents whereof were to this effect. yet my affairs here are of so great concernment, that I can no longer dispence with your absence: Therefore committing all to the care of your Lievtenant, by the haste you make to return, shew the affection you bear to my service: And that the young Cenodoxius who by your relation deserves so high an esteem, may receive the reward due to his merit, fail not to bring him with you. For as there is nothing I desire more then peace, especially in my own Dominions, so I shall ever most cherish those persons who by their Loyalty, or valour, do most contribute to it. SELEUCUS. I must confess I was not a little pleased with this real effect of Lysimacus friendship, for I supposed he would not be averse to receive that person into his alliance, whom he had so generously obliged, and with that assurance, knowing I must of necessity accompany him, I quitted my resolution of declaring our marriage till some fitter oportunity; yet as if by a secret instinct foreseeing my future miseries, I could not without some reluctance cast my thoughts upon the displeasing encounters, I might meet withall at Court. I knew many of my fathers enemies remained still in great places of Authority; I knew likewise that divers of his friends being of no less eminence either in birth or power, that my presence, especially if the king looked upon me with an eye of favour, might perhaps revive those factions which had formerly been between them; and I was not ignorant that their clashings might render me odious to that Prince whose only end was peace, and his chiefest policies to suppress the dissentions amongst his Nobles. Nevertheless on the other side I considered that the commands of a Soveraign were equivalent to Laws, that to make excuses would be held a crime equal to disobedience, and that only to avoid supposed inconveniences, I might both neglect my fortunes, and incur the censure of ingratitude: But that which removed all scruples, was the remembrance, that though those factions should through my occasion break out into new animosities, Seleucus himself would be a party engaged in the same interests, for those very persons who to satisfie their vain ambition, brought my father to an ignominious death, to comply with Theodoras , had embrewed their hands in his own mothers blood, with a double scandal both to his linage and dignity. Whilst I thus ruminated upon my own imaginations, Lysimachus returning again into the Cabinet, with all the submissions due to a father, I acknowled the benefit I was like to receive by his favour, and his expressions on the other side were so obliging, that invited by delusive hopes, with exceeding alacrity I prepared for my journey, and the third day after we arrived with the Ladies, in very good equipage at Palermo , where I met such civilities in the Court, and received such extraordinary favours from Seleucus , that as I could not hear the praises he gave me without blushing, so I cannot repeat them without an ostentation of too much vanity: Let it suffice I found such an entire satisfaction, that all things seemed to sort with my own desires, and I now rather expected addresses from Lysimachus , then to meet with any opposition to my just demands. But these mountains of prosperity by my own vain imagination raised to such a heighth, were but as heaps of sand, easily levelled with the least gust of adverse fortune: and the first clouds that darkened this sun-shine of my glory, appeared in Artemias countenance for intending to make her participant of my joys, entring one morning into her Chamber, I found her sitting in her chair with her hair loose, her head supported by her hand, a small Table that had been placed before her, thrown down, her Jewels and other ornaments scattered upon the floor, her cheeks blubbered with tears, her swoln heart ready to burst with sighs, and in short all the marks of an extreme grief, enclining even to dispair. What an afflicting object this was to a perfect Lover, your selves if you have ever felt the effects of that noble passion, may easily judge. The accurate sense of sorrow had so bereft me of all sense, that as if thunder-struck, I fell prostrate at her feet, not able to utter one syllable; which she perceiving, taking me by the hand, and gently pressing it, said: Ah Cenodoxius ! what a world of enemies oppose themselves to our happiness? Parents, kindred, friends, allies, and even the King himself, who ought to be the protector of innocence, hath determined our ruine. Whereupon a great number of Guards rushing in upon us, she gave a great shrike, and before I could turn my self about, we were both seised upon, and without being suffered to exchange a word, conveyed severally away, under a most severe restraint. It is impossible to relate how strangely I was surprized with this barbarous proceeding, and I will not offend your ears with the speeches or complaints which I uttered in my passion; but in the solitude of my imprisonment, which I may truly so term, for during the space of three months, in which time my enemies were perfecting their mischief, none were suffered to come at me except only two servants, who remained under the same close confinement, with the help of those Precepts that I had received from my faithful instructer Veveus, though ignorant of my offence, I so composed my thoughts, that I resolved with patience to expect the event, and at length things being brought to that maturity which the contrivers thereof themselves desired, my friends were again permitted to visit me, yet my affairs went so ill that none were very forward to perform that office, only Parmenio , whose friendship made him a partner in my disgraces, would not suffer me to remain ignorant of what so neerly concerned my honor. Nevertheless he so prepared me to endure the changes of fortune, and withal cast out such ambiguous speeches concerning my Love, that imagining any thing more possible then that Artemia could be false, I expected nothing less then the certain news of her death. When at last fixing his eyes upon me, and fetching a great sigh; upon what terms, said he, would you be content to quit your interest in Artemia ? Whereupon my blood rising into my face, Thy demand, I replyed, is injurious to our friendship, yet upon the first offence not to cancel that band, remain satisfyed with this answer, That not all the possessions of the world, the hidden Treasures of the Sea, what the fruitful earth may produce, or the benignity of the Heavens can promise, is able to purchase from me that inestimable Jewel. My demand indeed he continued, might give just occasion of offence, if she had valued you at so high a rate; but if she have already changed you for another, and voluntarily delivered up that Treasure into the possession of a Rival, upon which you set such an infinite esteem, I suppose you will be content to compound upon easier conditions, and not be such a slave to your affections as by continuing your Love, to abandon your Honor. To which as in a fury I presently returned, If Parmenio had sense of honor, he could not thus vildly blemish the vertue of Artemia : Thou hast conspired with my enemies to betray me to some action of infamy, and under the pretence of friendship, seekest to undermine my Love, but thy blood shall pay the forfeit of thy base scandal, that in thy heart I may read the story of thy treachery. Whereupon with a sad countenance, and tears in his eys, he replyed, These transportations are the generous effects of a violent, but I hope the last effects of a dying passion. I came prepared for such reproaches, and value not your threats. However though my life were as much in your power as you pretend, yet I am not to be frighted out of my fidelity, but when your rage is satisfyed with my blood, in that heart which you believe so trecherous, you shall finde the impressions of your own sad story, all but this last part of it, which a heart so loyal as mine is not capable of receiving, That Cenodoxius in defending the falsest of women, hath in his madness shed the innocent blood of the faithfullest of friends. The faithfullest of friends! said I to my self, is a title much more precious then that of the best of women: whereupon recollecting my thoughts, and almost beginning to suspect, what under that name he had seemed to affirm, as one prepared to hear the sentence of death, I began to hearken to his discourse, wherfore with the most comfortable terms he could possibly invent, he told me: That Eumenes the Kings only minion, though he never declared so much, having strong inclinations to Artemia , at the report of my actions, and perhaps upon some information of my particular addresses, grew into such a jealousie of being supplanted in his pretences, that at his sollicitation Seleucus , who in his excessive indulgence to his favourites was only defective, had in such hast recalled Lysimachus from his Government. That the match being proposed, was joyfully accepted both by him and his Allies. That thereupon Calista was employed to prepare her daughter to receive this new suiter, which she at first coldly refused, but being more earnestly pressed, absolutely denyed; not sticking to avow that she was already engaged in her affections, and in short, that she was Contracted to me, but apprehending the rigor of her Parents, or perhaps her own dishonor, had concealed the consummation of our marriage. That nevertheless Eumenes persisting in his resolution, since he could not prevail by intreaties, to shew the power of a favourite, determined by force to compass his desires. That Calista was by the King himself commanded to tell her daughter, that it was his pleasure, she should marry Eumenes , who so abused the interest he had with his Master, not being able indeed to deny him any thing, that in case of refusal Guards were appointed to secure her person, and at the same time to convey me to prison, as having transgressed an antiquated Law against secret Contracts without the consent of friends. That it happened immediately after Calista had declared the Kings resolute command to her daughter, and was gone, I entring thereupon into the chamber, found her having newly received this cruel Arrest, in that disconsolate posture, and so as I have already told you, we were both seised upon together. That to hinder all correspondence between us, it was held fit I should be kept close prisoner, and in the mean while the kindred, and friends, to be employed to remove her from her resolutions, but that she remaining yet firm, Hortensia who only knew our secret, and till then as suspected of partiality, had been kept from her, being gained with large promises of rewards, had so wrought upon the weakness of her young novice, by the charmes and allurements of a Princely greatness in becoming the wife of the sole favorite, that she was at length absolutely overcome, and being now agen at liberty, did openly avow her love to Eumenes , and that though it were already determined to nullifie the former marriage, yet to make some shew of a legal proceeding, the chief Flamens were appointed as Delegates to examine the justice of my cause. And indeed to confirm the truth of Eumenes relation, before he had quite finished his discourse, or I could make any Reply, I was summoned to appear in the Court, and by my Guards conveyed to the presence of those temporising Judges. It is impossible to recount the various agitations of my distracted mind in this unexpected occasion: But oh the Heavens! when I beheld Artemia supported by Eumenes , with an unusual confidence, before a publique Assembly, stand ready to confront me, the billows of a tempestuous sea are not more raging then at that time were my distracted thoughts, and with the same impetuosity if I had been at liberty, I should have broken out to my revenge. But then calling to mind the innocent delights of our former conversation, a tender remorse of love so calmed those swelling passions, that being asked what were my pretences of Interest in that Lady, believing her innocence was betrayed, and though forced to a complyance, that she was not fallen from her Vertue; instead of reproaching her Levity, magnifying her perfections, I related at large the birth, growth, and maturation of our Love, our mutual Vows, our private Contracts, our formal marriage, and at last the fruition of those joys, which the Heavens esteeming me worthy to possess, I could not now be deprived of, but by a too manifest, and impious violation of their divine Ordinances. This last asseveration was a circumstance unexpected by the Judges, and I observed raised blushes in Artemias cheeks, but being prepared with an answer, laying aside all modesty she boldly replyed: It is indeed true, that overcome with Cenodoxius flatteries, not weighing the greatness of the sin, I transgressed the rules of piety in consenting to an unlawful Contract, but considering my unexperienced yeers, I hope my crime is not so great, that for my punishment I shall be condemned to remain his wife, who hath here, in the face of the world, laid so foul an aspersion upon my Honor. Till now, I must confess, I retained inclinations, so far as it was lawful, to love that vild man, but since not satisfied to have betrayed my youth to such an unnatural contempt of my Parents, he hath here so unworthily defamed my Chastity, there is nothing I more truely hate, nor nothing more warrantable, then to use all means possible to free my self from his engagements. Wherefore though Hortensia's testimony with my own protestations, might be sufficient to vindicate my fame, and to leave me free to a more worthy choice, yet because the scandal hath been publick, to satisfie the whole world hovv much my innocence hath been traduced, since our Lavvs permit not the tryals of Chastity practiced among other Nations, by vvalking vvith bare feet through fire, or over the sharp edges of burning plough-shares, I am content, though either of those would be far more gratefull, to expose my body to the near survey of such skilfull persons, who being competent witnesses of my virginity, and by a sacred Oath obliged to the truth, may give testimony there of to this Assembly. Yet considering the repugnancy of a maiden-modesty, to such an immodest scrutiny, let me obtain this favour, that to cover my shame, my face may be vailed from the view of those who are to be the witnesses of my nakedness. Was there ever such an unheard of impudence? or ever such a subtile invention to work a sinister end? which was so much the more admirable, because she could hardly yet be called woman. I cannot but blush at the recital of such immodesties, and must make a digression to crave your pardon before I can proceed farther in my discourse, which not to offend your chaste ears, I shall pass over in as few words as possible. The Delegats commending her willing submission to such a certain decision of the truth, and thinking it reasonable, in respect of the sex, to grant her request, a Jury of Haggs, for it would be a scandal to Lucina , who is the Protectrix of marriage rites, to entitle them that were the perjured Agents to violate those sacred bands, her Ministers, were presently appointed to this unseemly inquisition; and Artemia having before contrived her business, retiring into a privat Chamber only with Hortensia , and a young maid one of her attendants, who was both well instructed, and that she might not deceive them, had already passed a privy search; the maid only with a vail over her was laid naked upon the bed, and the Beldams streight called in to perform their office, in which they were so punctual, that not exceeding their Commission, without having seen her face, gave a verdict upon their oaths on Artemias side, who whilst they were busie in their vote, being concealed in a Closset behind the Arras, stood laughing at their simplicity. But being thus cleared, she was again summoned into the Court, where calling upon the Supreme Powers as witnesses of her virgin purity, to revenge her injuries, and falling upon her knees, with dissembled tears, desired an equitable sentence from those, as she called them, sacred Judges. Sacred indeed in their profession and institution, but by their practice and precepts, the corrupters and sycophants of Princes. The Kings favorite is enamoured of a beauty already possessed by another; he by his wicked Agents works her to a willing divorce, and they to please the times, by a corrupt judgement, become the vile instruments to accomplish his unjust desires: For notwithstanding the truth of my allegations, Artemia gained her process, and not long after with all the pomp of the Court, was by the King himself given to Eumenes . A gift I must confess worthy of a King, if overcome with vanity, and the subtile allurements of a wicked confident, her fame, before she knew the esteem of vertue, had not been so miserably betrayed to an eternal obloquie. But whilst she gloried in her inconstancy, and Eumenes boasted the purchase of so rich a prize, the sense of this deep disgrace raised such furies in my breast, that whilst I meditated a revenge answerable to the indignity I had received, the torments of my own mind were greater then any I could invent to inflict upon my enemies. Eumenes death alone I thought too mean a satisfaction for so monstruous an injury, unless the false Hortensia , the perjured Artemia , the corrupt Flamens , and even the King himself, as guilty of too much partiality, being complices in the offence, participated likewise of the punishment. But Artemia and Hortensia not long after being found culpable of a greater crime, which is so publick a story, that none are ignorant thereof, and Eumenes as a confederate, from that height of favour falling into the hands of Justice, my anger for the present was in some measure appeased: In so much that knowing the peacefull humor of Seleucus , and with what excellent pollicies he prevented all occasions that might disturb the calm of his Government, during the rest of his Reigne I lived quietly, if not contented in my former retirement. At length Seleucus being dead, and Antiochus seated in the Throne, though Clearchus for a time through an excess of affection enjoyed little less then a partnership in the Empire, and the Prince and Nobility, though they could not deny his merit, maligned his greatness; yet he being by the butcherly hand of an impious assassin, as you all know, in the midst of the Camp Royal, most barbarously murthered, the beams of favour were so equally dispersed, that through their benigne influence, every one believing the way was now cleared to those honours and dignities, which belonged either to their birth or vertue, sought to ingross that authority to themselves, which with so much murmuring they repined at in another. And in this general mutation of affairs, aspiring with the highest, the renowned Justice and generosity of the King, made me hope, if not the chief place, at least a change in my condition. Wherefore having in a manner buried the remembrance of my former disgrace, in the graves of my persecutors, I resolved once more to become a Courtier? O resolution so destructive to my repose! O ambition so fatal to my honour! But had I only served my ambition, and not again rendred my self a slave to love, Fortune who contemns that petty Deity, would perhaps have been more propitious to my designs. In Artemias perfections I might have considered the hidden rancor of those charming poysons; in her sudden change the flexibility of womens minds, and in her unpatterned levity, the frailty of the whole sex. I was not yet so neglected by Antiochus , nor so discountenanced by Eudoxia , as well the Queen of his heart, as his associate in Soveraignty, but that in the pursuance of their favour, I might have expected a more glorious success, then in the vain contestations of love, though Venus her self had been proposed the price of my Conquest: Nevertheless yielding to the flatteries of those impotent delights, I began insensibly to burn in a second flame, which hath been the destruction both of my self and Family. The Court was enriched with many excellent beauties, but none in my opinion to be compared to the incomparable Paulina , whose fortunes not equalling her birth, she easily condescended to so advantagious a party. But the story of her infidelity is so well known to all the world, and so fresh in every mans memory, that I need not be the relater of my own infamy; though I cannot but exclaim against the folly of mankind, with such a general consent to allow the lubricity of women, to become the staine of their husbands honor. It is sufficient the adultres was detected, and though I were not my self present, by divers of my neerest freinds, surprized in the lustfull embraces of her amorous paramour. Wherefore her shame being so publick, and her minion Vitellio , though in the rank of Gentlemen, of too mean a quality, and the offence too great, to admit the dispute of an honourable encounter, instead of revenge, seeking for Justice, I required of Antiochus the punishment due to their crime. But Vitellio being favoured by Eudoxia , in lieu of redress, I was forced upon our separation, not alone to endow Paulina with a large revenue, but to receive her bastard-issue as the lawful inheritor of all my fortunes, and only Vitellio to avoid the fury of my indignation, was for the present, not banished, but as a darling of the Court, with many rich presents, sent to recreate himself in foreign parts; in so much that I became the scorn and derision, not only of Palermo , but even of the whole Kingdom. This last wound stuck so deep, and made so large an orrifice, that all the furies of hel entring at once into my bosom, represented my past disgraces in such hideous forms tyranizing over my honour, that the thoughts of revenge depriving me of all repose, rage and dispaire became at length the greater tyrants. My Fathers blood, Agnesias languishing griefs, my violate marriage, and this late contempt, raised several passions, which like so many torrents, overthrew all obstacles that withstood the rapacity of their course, where they met the greatest checks, raging with the greatest impetuosity, and though the sacred person of the King, with the holy Office of the Priesthood, seemed secure Ramparts against any violence, they swelled to such a prodigious height, that at last they overflowed them, and have now caused a vast sea of confusion, in which my self have first suffered a miserable shipwrack. Nevertheless those two considerations of piety and allegiance had perhaps suppressed such unruly thoughts, if the male-contents of the times perceiving my distemper, had not taken that oportunity to engage me in their own designes; but that which chiefly fortifed me in those resolutions, was the authority of Alucinus whose councels I had ever esteemed as Oracles; for coming one day into my Cabinet, where overwhelmed with griefs, I sate ruminating upon my own misfortunes, after some gentle reprehensions, he began to entertain me with a discourse much to this effect. If I were ignorant of your sufferings, I should wonder to see so great a courage so overcome by sorrow; and if your injuries were not so publick to the world. I should advise you with a manly fortitude rather to resist those motions, which I doubt not prompt you to a revenge, then by the pursuance thereof to publish your own shame. But who is there, though then unborn, that is unacquainted with the story of Heraclius misfortunes? Is not the miserable slavery of the Sardinians a sad testimony of Agnesia's calamities? Who knows not with what injustice you were deprived of Artemia? And the contempt cast upon you in the impunity of those base adulterers, is it not the common discourse of every mans mirth? even children point at you as you pass the streets, and Mechanicks in every corner sing the vile pasquils published in your disgrace. Notwithstanding you will perchance object, and that may be the chief cause of your perplexity, That Theodora's monstrous ingratitude to Heraclius and her tyrannical oppression of Agnesia , though they were acts of extream cruelty, yet she being dead, you can now retain only the resentment of them, That Seleucus who supported the insolency of Eumenes , is by the same fate exempt from the justice of your revenge, That the holy function of the Flamens, cannot without sacrileidge suffer a violation in their persons; and though Antiochus , through the instigations of the Queen, hath by an injury of the highest nature, without regarding the dignity of your birth, exposed your life to a perpetual infamy, yet being by the supreme powers ordained a King, though he abuse his Authority, the punishment is reserved only to themselves, and to attempt ought either against his person, or his power, were an impious violation of their divine Prerogatives. It is true, though three Kings successively have been the constant persecuters of your Family, yet if their malice had extended no farther, these reasons might prevail with you, for a privat cause, not to disturb the publick peace. But the whole Nation groans under the power of Antiochus , who not content with an unlimited power in himself, which he wholly submits to the unbridled will of Eudoxia ; but seeking to introduce again the superstitions of the Romans , would likewise make us slaves to the insulting pride of his ambitious Flamens, which by the memorable prudence and piety of Theodora , though in other things extravagant enough, being reduced to a small number, and a power depending only on the Crown begin now to be more aspiring then ever. I will not insist upon the sufferings of the Commons, or under what false pretences they are burthened with intollerable Taxes: It will be enough by representing the corruptness of the Fountain, to give you a view of the impurity that flows in all the streams Doth not the Queen with such an absolute dominion sway the affections of the King, that none dare pretend to advancement but by her mediation? And by her ill placed favours is not the Court, the proper sphear of Princes, become a harbor only for dissolute youth? or at the best such as they call wits? who because they can hold up a chat, contrive the intriques of a Comedy, and in their smooth Rimes flatter the Ladies, are thought the fittest Ministers to govern a State. How often whilst the Buffon Crotus ; the chief Poet, and the chiefest of Poltrons Valerius , the strong gameing wit Andemus , the play-wright Dante , the Railleur Arterius ; the intriguer Grollio , with the rest of that Cabal, and their chief Patron, the luxurious Vitellio , have been admitted to the privacy of Councellors; have the chiefest of the Nobility, upon urgent affairs, like so many Lacquays, attended in the Ante-Chamber for an Audience? And no sooner dismissed, but every one of you passed under the censure of those flattering Criticques? Adrasius in his old fashioned habit smells too rank of Antiquity, Percianus is reasonably well dressed, but holding his nose in the Aire, walks as if he were broached upon a stake, Giraldo besoted with too much Learning, Archelaus an honest fool, and your self of so tame a disposition, that no Lady would desire a more patient husband. Can men of such noble descent suffer such vild affronts? Or because Antiochus hath devested himself of his power, are you obliged to lose the remembrance of what you are? Were not Kings chosen for the publick good, and when by their ill government they in a manner make a war against their people, doth it not tend to the dissolution of their power? And if they obstinately persist, are not the Subjects freed from the bond of their Alleagiance? To which they are no longer obliged, then whilst they receive Protection from their Prince. Consider the general ruine that is threatned to the whole Kingdom, in the subversion of our fundamental Laws, and though the rest are possessed with a Lethargick stupidity, be you awake to the crying complaints of your Country. The supreme Jupiter hath laid so many afflictions upon you, not as punishments, but by inciting a just indignation against the subverter of our native rights, to manifest to the whole world the incomparable vertue of your mind. Wherefore since by these disgraces, you are as it were pointed out to the people, to be the Champion of their Liberty, refuse not to undertake the protection of so just a cause. Or if you can forget your unspeakable injuries, and unconcernedly behold the miseries of the Commonwealth, at least suffer not your self to be thus trampled on by every upstart Polititian. Though you have neither a heart of revenge, nor a sense of justice, I am sure you cannot be without an ambition to enjoy those honors that belong to your birth: and the path to the highest dignities is now so beaten, that every State-Novice hath found the way to compass his own desires. If you once shew your self an enemy to Antiochus , you may be sure he will seek your friendship: both Seleucus and himself have been so besotted with the love of Peace, and so unskilled in the art of governing, that whosoever have opposed their proceedings, or by any means sought to embroil them in troubles, instead of punishment have been rewarded with Offices of the greatest trust. Who more fierce to defend the Peoples Rights, then that Gyant of the Law Severus , till for the title of Advocate-Royal he sold his honesty? Appius upon the same score was made high Chancellor, Gallus Treasurer, Hortensius chief Justician, and to conclude, what greater enemie of the kingly Prerogative, then the now only Atlas of the present Tyranny Affrodartus ? Therefore the more you decline from that which you call duty, the greater value you set upon your self: and if you pass so far as once to appear in Arms, doubt not but Antiochus to purchase his peace will part with a great share of his power, which you may afterwards employ as you please, either for your own interest, or which is most worthy so generous a spirit to redeem your Country from a certain slavery. I must confess being willing to be deceived I was easily convinced by these delusive Arguments, and though moved by a private hate, framing such plausible pretences for the common welfare, as were generally approved, I gained such a considerable number of adherents, even amongst the most moderate men, who wished only a reformation of certain disorders which were prejudicial both to the King, and people, that I doubted not of a success in the enterprise: which not to dissemble my intentions, being so highly provoked by them, was absolutely to destroy the power and Office of the Flamens, and to let Antiochus see that person he had so much contemned, was considerable enough to pull the Crown from his head, but having shewn what I was able to do, to do no more then was the duty of a subject, or at the most but to limit that Arbitrary power, which had been the destruction of mine own Honor, and was indeed the general grievance of the people. Wherefore knowing how He was, notwithstanding, as yet, in a manner adored by the subjects, and the name of King even reverenced amongst them, I began first to cast an aspersion upon the present Government insinuating by subtile Agents, that they were unjustly burdened with heavy Taxes, that the publick Revenues were lavishly expended, that the pride of the Flamens was insupportable, the Queens power intolerable, the designs of Affrodartus pernicious, and the proceedings of the King terribly threatning a general subversion both of our Liberties and Religion. The Alliance contracted with the Roman Emperor, by the match between your self and the Princess Theophania , though you were then both infants, giving manifest assurances of the one, and the undertaking, contrary to his inclinations, a war against the Cyprians , promising nothing less of the other. For it could not be doubted when Affrodartus engaged him in that enterprise, it was with a design, if he proved succesful, to conclude his Conquests with the absolute slavery of this Nation. These suggestions taking that effect as was desired, having gained the --- to stand as newters, all other neighbouring Princes being imbroiled with wars at home, the people of Palermo leagued with us, the Cyprians our faithful friends already in Arms; the Sardinians through jealousie I had caused to be sowed amongst them, of a total extirpation of their Nation, revolted; and Antiochus through want of mony, the sinews of a war, but ill assured of those forces he had raised under the command of Affrodartus for the Cyprian expedition, I began more openly to declare my self, and being accompanyed by Adrastus , Giraldo , and Archelaus , with divers more of the same confederacy, confidently presenting our selves before his Majestie: I boldly told him, that his own mis-government was the cause of these disorders, and if he did not apply a present remedy, himself with his posterity would be involved in the general ruin. Insomuch, that perceiving his designs to fail, his person encompassed with so many dangers, and without doubt relying upon the integrity of our intentions, returning agen to his former desires of Peace, he seemed ready to comply with us in whatsoever we would propose. Whereupon in the first place, we obliged him, having confirmed their priviledges, to desist from his enterprise against the Cyprians , and disbanding his Army, to repair to his chief City, there to consult with us, for the future settlement of his affairs, with faithful protestations, that a lasting peace being established in the Kingdome, we would imploy all our endeavours to render him the most glorious of Princes: which either through a belief of our promises, or with the hopes of a perfect settlement was so easily granted, that being now in Palermo , secured by the affections of the Citizens we became more arrogant in our demands, requiring, before we would enter into any debate, that Affrodartus , whose destruction was necessary for the advancement of our designs, for having counselled the war against the Cyprians ; and Evaldus , the Arch-Flamen, as the chief contriver of the Roman alliance, should be both delivered into the hands of justice; That the marriage being not yet consummate, the Princess Theophania should be immediately sent back to Rome , the Contract pronounced void, and open war declared against the Emperor. That all Taxes should be abolished, the Flamens absolutely deprived of their Authority, the Receivers of the publick Revenue called to a strict account, and the strength of the kingdom entrusted with such persons, as our selves should nominate; but above all, as obliged in commiseration of their sufferings, though indeed to have an Army yet on foot for security, That the Cyprians , till they were reimbursed their charges, should not be bound to dismiss their Troops. It would be infinitely tedious to relate the several disputes, and contestations on either side before Antiochus would yield to these Propositions, but we persisted so resolutely in them, and were so cordially abetted by the Citizens, that at length, finding it vain to resist, he condescended to all our desires, and to shew the confidence he reposed in us, puting himself wholly into our hands, constituted me Lievtenant General of all the forces in his Dominions, with so absolute an Authority that I was no longer a subject, but more then a Colleague in the Empire, and himself enjoyed onely the Title of a King. Having thus attained to that heigth which was beyond the aym of my Ambition, presently seising upon all the strong holds and Forts of the Kingdom, but especially the Magazines and Navy; to be yet more absolute, all thoughts of Reformation being now laid aside, I raised an Army, under pretence, that the King, repenting his confidence in us, upon whom he ought chiefly to relye, sought to introduce a foreign Enemy for the re-establishment of his Tyranny. Nor ye content having thus devested him of his Power, to render him as well contemptible, as odious, I declared him, through natural defects incapable to govern, and to compleat my revenge, through the occasion of Vitellios favor, spared not to cast some aspersions upon Eudoxias honor. At this discourse the Prince could not so govern his passions, but the blood rising into his face, seemed ready to flye forth at every part, to vindicate it self from so foul a scandal; which Cenodoxius perceiving, with a submissive countenance casting his eys upon the earth, and with a profound sigh that testified the sorrow of his heart. The remembrance, said he, of these proceedings, is no less grievous to my self, then they are offensive to you, and have been injurious to my Soveraigns Honor; but I have been thus punctual in my confession, that I might leave nothing to be objected against me; and my past crimes not being greater then my present griefs, I still hope in the conclusion to reconcile my self agen to your favour He, reply'd the Prince, that is conscious of so much guilt, and can hope for a reconciliation, adds to his other faults a presumption unpardonable. But proceed without reply, for I will be as just in my censure, as severe in the prosecution of my revenge. Whereupon reassuming his discourse, the King, said he, at last perceiving, and too late repenting the error he had committed in conferring so unlimited a power upon a subject, began seriously to reflect upon his condition, which by his too much facility he believed was almost become desperate. His chief Councellors, Affrodartus , and Evaldus , were already made a sacrifice to the publick hate, the authority of the Flamens, Theodora having taught us that it was not devine, without scruple absolutely abollished, his friends as suspected, removed, or apprehending their own danger, fled from him; all the strength and Treasure of the Kingdom in my hands, and nothing wanted to the consummation of his ruine, but by sending back the Princess Theophania , and declaring war against the Emperor, to deprive himself even of all hopes of support. Reduced to such extremity, to prevent so fatal a mischief, with a resolution desperate as fortunes, but with a courage great as his birth, he resolved, if he must perish, to perish like himself. To secure his Crown, and his Countreys peace, he was content to be unkinged, and he would now be a King again, though to the uttermost hazard of both. Wherefore departing from Parlermo with a numerous Court, under pretence, according to the agreement, of conducting the Princess Theophania to the sea-side, being a daies journey from the City, with a small train he took the rout of --- where being arrived with the Queen and Princess in safety, having proclaimed me and my adherents Traitors, he began presently to levy Forces for his own and their defence. This was the period of all my wishes, and I now applauded the influence of my stars, that I should at length come to a contestation worthy of my self, for to speak truly, though I were content to make use of them, those dissimulations and stratagems with which I had proceeded hitherto, were arts, that in my nature I utterly abhorred: But to come to the decision of a pitched battail, though the hazard were more, the undertaking was more honourable, and in conquering a King, and then to lay the Conquest at his feet, the glory would be infinite. Wherefore flattering my self with these Chimerical imaginations, having put the Army in a readiness, which consisted of fifty thousand foot, and ten thousand horse, I began to advance towards Cornavij ; yet being within two daies march of the Kings quarters, and understanding by my Scouts, that he had not above ten thousand men together, seeking only for honour, I disdained such an advantage, which, if I had harbored the same thoughts as most of my adherents, I might then have pursued to his final destruction; whereas on the contrary, knowing his weakness, whilst he marched away with that inconsiderable number, under feigned pretences, I drew farther off, giving him all the oportunity himself could desire to assemble his friends, who perceiving my slackness, and seeing him go on with so undaunted a courage, flocked to him in his retreat from all the Provinces of the Kingdom. The first Rendezvouz was at Mottingham, where Philocles Prince of Thessalie met him, though without any aid saving his own valour; but at the same time Selindus , a Prince of long experience in the Grecian Wars, came in with eight thousand foot and two thousand horse, so that advancing to Vriconvi , the Gates were immediately opened to him,  & the Citizens having at their own charge raised six thousand men, gave besides such ample testimonies of their fidelity, that considering the commodity of the Haven, and if any accident should happen, that it lay open to the sea, having appointed Ismenus , a Souldier of approved trust, to be their Governor, and Vitellio with five hundred choice horse to be a guard for the Queen, he left her and the Princess Theophania there, as in a place of undoubted security. Then having constituted Selindus his Lieutenant General, and Philocles General of the horse, himself with all the expedition he could make, marched towards --- where Maxentius a Prince of the blood-Royal, received him with five thousand foot well armed, and four thousand Lances; Fulvio likewise brought six hundred barded horse, Petruchio eight hundred Cross-bows, Cardenius a thousand horse lightly armed, Martianus a thousand expert slingers, besides two thousand more armed only with short Swords and Targets of beasts skins, and Protomanthius Prince of Bernicia two thousand Archers, and eight thousand resolute horse commanded by himself, and his four sons, the eldest whereof was not above nineteen years of age, yet I must confess, both for their vertue and courage, the admiration of Armies. Besides the forces of these generous Princes, there were three thousand Gentlemen, the chief flowre of the Nobility, who chusing Albinius, Julianus and Bernardo , three Noble youths, the brothers of Maxentius for their Captains, served as a peculiar guard for the Kings own person. Having thus assembled a considerable power, confident in his own strength, without regarding my motions, he marched into the Province of Coritani, and as he advanced, daily encreased in numbers. But though I had all this while remained in a manner quiet, yet I was very carefull to observe his proceedings, and being particularly advertised by my spies of all occurrences, knowing the advantage was not great on either side, having received a fresh supply of ten thousand men from Palermo , I advanced upon the same rout he had taken, and he being resolute for the encounter, staying for me, encamped with his whole Army in a large Campagne at the foot of Trapanio , having the Mountain for shelter on one side, and a small River for defence on the other. The Armies being now in sight of each other, seeing the advantagious Post of the enemy, I thought it impossible to attain them without too evident a hazard, and therefore ranging my Batalies, stood as in a posture of defiance, ready to fight; which Antiochus perceiving, either impatient of delays, or disdaining to be so braved by a Subject, passed the River, and Selindus , like an expert General in the ordering of his men, shewed himself worthy of that Authority. The King had the advantage of horse both for number and courage, being for the most part composed of Gentlemen of the chiefest quality in the Kingdom; but my Infantry were both better disciplined and more resolute for the combat. To be short, both sides shewed such an ardor to meet, that they prevented the directions of their Officers, and the charge was so furious, that they ran together pel mel without any distinction of Commanders, and even the King himself fighting in the melle as a common Soldier; so that though before the Armies joyned I had given a strict command not to endanger, but if it were possible, to seize upon his person; yet in so general a combustion, he ought his preservation only to his own valour, shewing such an invincible strength in his arm, that the brandishment of his Sword was no less terrible, then if Jove himself to support the glory of a triple royalty, had armed him with his threefold Dart, to the amazement and confusion of his enemies. Prince Philocles likewise by his surpassing courage shewed himself animated with the blood of Antiochus , and after a brave contest, at length totally routed the whole body of our Cavalry, but transported with a youthfull ardor, was so eager in the pursuit, and afterwards his men, believing they were absolute victors, so abandoned themselves to the plunder of our baggage, that in the mean while my rescue commanded by Pratinus , charing them afresh, made a horrible slaughter amongst the foot, which would rather have appeared a massacre, if the King having a vigilant eye in every place, with the three thousand horse of his guard, and a thousand more under the conduct of Prontomanthius , had not come oportunely to their rescue. But upon his appearance, the souldiers who before having seen the fall of Selindus , were ready to shrink, renewing their vigor, the fight began to be bloudy, and the victory wavering, sometimes enclined to the one side, and sometimes to the other; When Corinnus a daring Souldier, making his way with his sword through the thickest of the Enemy, having killed Enaruius the Bearer, seized upon the royal Standart, which being thrown down had undoubtedly put an end to the dispute; if Iurius as bold in his attempt, had not by the death of Corinnus recovered that lost Ensigne, with which he again raised the courage of his party. But once more Fortune seemed inclinable to favour ours, when the King spyed me single, in a sudden rage spurring on his horse, so far engaged himself, that he was presently invested round, with a yet entire Troop that came to my succour, who notwithstanding my order, to secure themselves from the fury of his blowes, to endeavor the preservation of their own; for death attended upon his stroakes, and the fire darting from his eyes, was no less killing then his sword. Nevertheless he must at length have been oppressed with multitudes; if the three gallant brothers Albinius, Iulianus, and Bernardo , with the resolute Prontomanthius , perceiving the danger of their Prince had not like lightning flown to his aid. Albinius first making his way over heaps of dead bodies joyned with the King at the same instant that his horse was killed under him, who presently mounting him agen on his own, fought himself on foot, till with his death he gave the last testimony of his loyalty. But Iulianus, Bernardo , and Prontomanthius having despight of all opposition by this time forced their way through our Troops, environing their Soveraign, gave some respite to his almost wearyed force, yet it was my chance with the force of a batle-axe to throw the young Bernardo on the earth, and I was now engaged with Iulianus who fought gallantly to revenge, his brothers death, when the Kings guards of Cavaliers coming furiously on to their succour, ended this cruel conflict by forceing us to retire. Nevertheless though they secured the person of the King, and carryed off Iulianus , and Prontomanthius , yet both those latter dyed shortly after of their wounds; and the night now coming upon us, both sides were rather tyred, then either of them victorious. Wherefore by a mutual consent sounding a retreat, we both drew off, uncertain which side had gained the advantage, onely this I must confess, that what the Enemy onely doubted, we absolutely believed, and therefore the King retyring to the other side of the river kept the Feild, and in the darkness of the night, I having rallyed my Troops the best that I could, withdrew to Cornavit a strong Town, some three hours march from the place of battaile, leaving it as yet disputed who bore away the honor of the day, which for my part I will not take upon me to decide, your selves weighing the circumstances will be the most competent judges. On our side the horse were absolutely defeated, the baggage taken, and many of our choice Commanders, besides common Souldiers slain; On the other, the number of their dead was many more, the foot almost either all killed or routed, and besides Selindus who commanded in chief under the King, and those already named, a great number of the Nobility likewise lost their lives. Indeed it is true, besides the honour of the remaining last in the feild, the King the next day, seeing no Enemy appeared, marched directly towards Palermo the chief fortress of our strength, though being within four leagues of the City, the principal Burgers, who were faithful to my designes so prepossessed the people with the bloody cruelty of the Royalists, that to prevent his neerer approach they issued out in multitudes against him; Insomuch that Antiochus apprehending I might likewise advance upon him in the rear, having passed only some light skirmishes with those swarmes of Citizens, he retreated in very good order to Nicosia ; which being in the heart of the Kingdome, and the Province abounding with all manner of provisions was thought the fittest place to make his chiefe residence, and therefore applying himself to the care of rendering that City defensible the winter growing on, for the present, desisted from any further enterprise;  & his Majesty thus establishing himself, I having not a power to impeach his designe, with the residue of my broken Army, retired for shelter, and to recover new force, into Palermo . This was the event of the first battaile in this bloody war, which I have related thus punctually; because your Highness being then too young to use the exercise of arms, hath not perhaps been fully informed of some passages that I have now noted unto you: but in the ensuing treaties of peace, and all actions that have occurred since, having been your self either present, or a principal actor, I shall pass them over with silence, and come now to that last point, which hath been to me so disastrous, and is of greatest consequence to your self. The Armies therefore being withdrawn into their winter quarters, the King, to ingratiate himself with the people, offering a general pardon, proposed certain Articles of agreement; but some of my party having farther designes, hindered the effect thereof, perswading me that though they intended nothing more then the preservation of the royal dignity in a well grounded peace; yet no peace could be secure till the prosperity of our affairs made us able to prescribe the conditions, insomuch that by degrees ingaging my self, I was insensibly so far ingulfed in a disturbed sea, that it was indeed impossible to return agen to the harbour. Wherefore after the various successes of seven years war, growing at length sensible of those miseries in which through ambition, I had involved my native Country, I resolved at last in the hazard of one battel, both to put a period to my owne hopes, and to the lamentable distractions of the whole Island. To which purpose raising a mighty power, and through an experience of his conduct and courage, having constituted Corastus my Lieutenant General, who having cunningly insinuated himself into all my Councels, though I were not ignorant his Principles squared not altogether with mine, yet being acquainted with the secret of my intentions, he so well dissembled the rancor of his heart, that I conceived not the least suspition of his treacherous machinations; and therefore understanding that the King returning victorious from the siege of Dobuni , at once to put a foil upon his conquests, and likewise to intercept his passage, the whole Army not being yet ready to move, I left Corastus to hasten their dispatch, and my self onely with twelve thousand foot and six thousand horse, advanced to the borders of Coves , where his Majesty then lay to refresh his Army, with an intent as soon as the rest of my forces came up to give him battel, and in the mean while to hinder those supplies that might come to him from Nicosia , or the other Garrisons remaining in his obedience. But whilst secure in the fidelity of Corastus , and boasting the hoped for success of this last enterprize, I contrived the way how to manage the conquest to my greatest glory, he most deceitfully, not onely retarded the advance of those supplyes; but having infused into the Souldiers his owne Principals, imployed them perfidiously to my destruction: For publishing to the world, I aspired onely by subduing Antiochus , to set the Crown upon my owne head, and to continue, if not increase the slavery of the people; having expelled those of my party, he rendred himself master of Palermo , and by the advertisements of my friends, I knew it was in vain either to expect aid from a new enemy, or to attempt any thing against Antiochus , who having likewise intelligence of this rupture amongst our selves, though I offerred upon conditions to submit, and to joyne with him against the common Enemy; yet the propositions which seemed necessary to me for my security, appearing to him insolent and unreasonable, he resolved to give us battel; and I through the exigence of my affaires sought not to avoid the encounter, the issue whereof hung some time in suspence, and the victory without flattery, ought wholly to be attributed to your owne valour, for when you charged our horse, they retired upon the foot, put all into such a confusion, that never was a more absolute defeat, nor ever any General from so much greatness reduced to a more miserable condition. Wherefore being distitute of all hopes to restore my fortunes, or by death to finish my disgraces, I abandoned the feild, and have ever since wandered vp and down, as much as was possible avoiding the society of men, thinking my self only happy in having no witnesses of my shame. But in this sollitary perigrination often reflecting upon those discourses with which Corastus frequently entertained me in privat, though I thought them then rather matters of argument, then setled maxims by which he would govern his actions, yet by what he hath now done, the perniciousness of his designes is too manifest, and by his betraying of me, and the suppression of my party, he only endeavours to make his way more easie to the ruine, not only of Antiochus , but by cutting off the Royal line of the Regal Authority. This is no aspersion of malice that in revenge I seek to lay upon my adversary, in discovering to you his transactions and proceedings, I shall manifest the true drift of his designes, and free my self from that suspition, wherefore having now ended the story of my misfortunes, which I hope hath in some sort mittigated the height of your indignation, though I have nothing more then what you may collect from the circumstances thereof, to alleadg in my excuse, yet when I have represented to you the condition of your affairs, which through a partiality of Councels, perhaps you do not rightly understand, embracing the interests of the Crown, I doubt not but you will rather pardon my transgressions, though never so great, then by nourishing a vindicatiue humor, abandon your own cause. Whereupon Alexandro casting his eye upon Ervillius , smiled a little, but perceiving by an alteration in his countenance, that with so long sitting up he began to be weary, with exceeding shew of mildness he desired Cenodoxius to reserve the conclusion of his discourse till some other oportunity. Whereupon Nicander entring into the room, presented a pacquet newly come from Palermo to Synesius , who immediately taking Cenodoxius with him, retired to his own appartment, leaving Ervillius to his repose, and the two Princes to entertain themselves with descanting upon the several passages of Cenodoxius story. But the time of day inviting them to a repast, after a short refection they parted for the present, Alexandro to commune with his griefs, and Demetrius to cherish his hopes with a successful progress in his love, since he had already gained such an advantagious friendship. End of the Sixth Book. THEOPHANIA BOOK VII. Alexandro , whose griefs through a forced complyance, had been so long suppressed, were now grown to such a height, that his swoln breast was ready to break with anguish: wherefore descending into the Garden, invited by the murmuring of the fountains that seemed to sympathize with his complaints, he threw himself at his length upon a seat at the entrance of a grot, with his head, though his back were towards it, leaning upon a Marble Pillar that supported the Arch which lead into that pleasant solitude; and then casting up his eyes to heaven, and often repeating to himself the name of Theophania , he began with sighs and tears to give a vent to his passions. When as ecchoing his groans, from the inmost part of the Cave issued a mournful sound, which by exceeding attention he perceived to proceed from the sad accents of two womens discourse, but they were so far within, and the running of the water made such a hollow noise, that he could scarcely distinguish the articulation of their words, much less collect from them any connexed dependance; yet imagining he often heard pronounced the names of Alexandro and Demetrius , leaving his place with a curiosity to approach nearer, he entred softly into the grot, and being more careful to conceal himself, then mindful of his steps, treading by chance upon a loose quarrie in the pavement, artificially placed so on purpose, at the pressing thereof a great stream of water hit him with such a force just in the face and eyes, that whilst he dryed himself with his handkerchief, the Ladies, who were not willing to be seen, pulling down their vails, had an oportunity without being descerned, to step by him, and through a doore that entred into the Park, which in their passage they made fast, conveyed themselues out of his sight, though not so nimbly but that turning about, he discovered in them both such a perfect shape and proportion, as drew after them his admiration: The one attired in great mourning, by that habit testified the nature of her griefs, and the other was so suitably clad, as shewed she accompanied her in sorrow, but that the occasion thereof was not of so near a relation. The Prince remaining astonished at so rare an accident, and to have heard himself and his friend named, as he thought, by persons of that sort, in a place where the one was an absolute stranger, and both of them relying upon the fidelity of Synesius concealed from the knowledge of any but those to whom they, had discovered themselues: sometimes he blamed his modesty that he had not laid hold on them as they passed by him, but then checked his thoughts, for suggesting to him an action of so much rudeness, and in this confusion walking to and fro, returned agen to the consideration of the desperateness of his fortunes in the prosecution of his love, which remov'd from his memory the novelty of this late encounter with the two ladys: when Synesius advancing towards him, after an excuse for so bold an intrusion upon his privacy, presented him a Letter, that at their parting had been delivered to him by Nicander , which coming from a person of eminence, and the Contents thereof relating to his affairs, he desired him to peruse; Wherefore taking the benefit of a seat under the shade of a large Palm, and having placed Synesius by him, he read these ensuing lines. disgraces cast upon himself and his Family, under pretence of the publique good, together with his revenge, sought the advancement of his own greatness: And that though many of us perceiving the drift of his designes, nevertheless favoured his proceedings, it was still with a hope by those means to recover that dignity, of which, Kings fearing our power, have by degrees, and to their own ruine, inconsiderately deprived us. But whilst by force and policy we thus strove to satisfie our ambition, in contending for more then we had, we shall probably loose that little which remained. For Corastus considering with what facility we brake those bands that tyed our obedience to the Crown, and being a diligent observer of the dissimulations, arts and stratagems, by which we sought to compass our ends, inspired with more generous thoughts, he thought it a vertue, which perhaps Cenodoxius cals treachery, to separate himself from such partial Interests. Without fraud or deceit he declares his intentions to the world, and with an heroick resolution professeth himself an open enemy to Antiochus , who deriving his Title from the power of the Sword, he esteems it no injury, by the same power to dispossess him of it: And having no other end then to redeem the people from slavery, pretends no farther honour then to become the Protector of their Liberty. His secret Councels, as appears by the effects, have been managed with such wisdom, and the candor of his actions in the prosecution of them, promiseth so happy a success, that confessing my former error, I am ready to embrace the same cause; but having ever in matters of consequence, been directed by advice, I will not absolutely engage till by the concurrence of your judgement I am either confirmed in that resolution, or by considering your reasons to the contrary, may steere such a course, as shall be most agreeable to the strict rules both of Justice and Honour. PERCIANUS. Alexandro having read the Letter, I see, said he, the heavens are just in making our enemies the active instruments to destroy each other; and though Corastus at length supplant me in my right, I shall not lose my revenge. The heavens, replyed Synesius , afford you other comforts, then to make your greatest and most dangerous enemies, the Umpires of your Cause. The greatest perhaps, said the Prince, but not the most dangerous: A plain thrust, though directed by a stronger arm, is easilyer avoided then a cunning feignt, which offering at the foot, is aimed at the heart. Force may repel force, but dissimulations, plots, and impostures, noble spirits know not how to encounter, because they are not exercised in the management of such arms. Corastus cannot be truely said to rebel against the King, but rather to have suppressed a rebellious Usurper, and by what I understand, the frankness of his proceedings is so generous, that whatsoever are his pretences, if it were possible to come to an agreement, I had rather to enjoy a devided Empire with him, then be fully restored by the assistance of Cenodoxius ; for his proceedings under specious pretences of reformation, and dissembled protestations to advance the interests of the Crown have been so injurious both to King and people, that by his wicked practices they are now almost irreconcileably engaged in one anothers ruine: Yet I must confess if he had avowed his cause, I should not have been so much offended with his actions, nor altogether so averse from a reconciliation: For great men that are sensible of their owne dishonour, are the fittest Ministers for Princes, and being cherished the chief supports of the Crown. Your wisdome replyed Synesius , so far exceeds your graces, that if your conduct be equal, though you should be overcome, whilst you maintaine such gallant principles, your fall will be more glorious then others conquests; and even your enemies in the height of their prosperity will lament the misfortune of their victories, that in the just pursuance, as they call it, of their liberties, they were forced to be so unseasonably vertuous. I wish, said Alexandro , I may deserve your praises, for I had rather have my memory preserved with the attribute of good, then fortunate: But fortune is commonly an attendant of prudence, and wise Councels will add rigor to my armes, therefore since your advice may be far more beneficial to my affaires, then your commendations, though I accept the one as an effect of your civility, I shall hearken to the other as to an Oracle. Whereupon Synesius glad of the occasion presently answered. They presume with too much vanity upon their owne sufficiency, that intrude themselves into the Councels of Princes, but to every one, when commanded to deliver his opinion, it is an obligation of duty; yet I should now be sparing of mine, because I perceive your judgement is already byass'd another way, and Cenodoxius having desired me, as a mediator, to deliver what he hath more to say, I may perhaps incur the censure of partiality. However since in obeying your commands, I cannot but satisfie his request, I shall the more boldly hazard my self, with a hope to content both; and craving pardon for my presumption, desire the liberty to utter my thoughts freely, as well concerning the more remote originals, as the present remedies, which if prudentially applyed, may appease the raging of these our horrible distractions. Whereupon the Prince having assured him that he expected not less, nor desired nothing more, with a composed gravity, he entred into this ensuing discourse. Cenodoxius in his story hath pointed out divers things, which like still gliding streames searching the defects, have in succession of time undermined the banks that preserved our peace from all perils of inundation. The popularity of Theodora ; the contempt of all things sacred; The too peaceful inclinations of Seleucus ; The unlimited power of favourites, the unseasonable mildness of Antiochus , pardon me if I mention it, his too great indulgence to Eudoxia ; Her slighting of the Nobility, and through a fond aversion towar a general neglect of our security: But in these latter times nothing hath been more prejudicial to the Kingly dignity, then by seeking with rewards to appease the turbulence of factious discontented spirits: For every weak capacity perceiving that was the way to advancement, studying nothing more then to shock the royal authority, easily arrived at those honours that were above their deserts, and so disencouraged the loyal endeavours of those, who truly reverencing their Soveraign as they ought, would not by meriting his hate, assure themselves of his avour. Besides the examples already produced, look into your fathers Court, and you will there finde many that may be brought into this number, and not a few of greatest credit, and power, who even in the beginning of the troubles, were either partisans, or busie agents to advance the interests of Cenodoxius . The old Gibideus now a great Councellour, through hate to Clearchus laid the slander of a horrible paraside upon his Master, Ergogius his Son, the now onely confident of the Court, through ambition was a fierce persecutor of Affrodartus; Iolcandus though more to shew his wit, then out of designe, a bitter enemy both to himself and Evaldus ; and Probus to boast his eloquence a frequent declamer against, I those who, though perhaps too partially, upheld the Prerogatives of the Crown. These, with many more, who not being so eminent, I purposely omit, were the first industrious instruments to shake the foundations of our Government, and therefore, some in derision have been pleased to say, they are still entrusted, as in a matter of far less skill, to repair the breaches thereof; for they fondly believe it was so strongly cemented together, and the super- structure so firme, and solid, that to all humane apprehension it was beyond the power of art or pollicy to endeavour its ruine, which they conceive good conduct, with the help of the sword, or which is more to be desired, a happy peace, notwithstanding the many terrible batteries it hath endured, may as yet prevent. But this is an errour too manifest to every common understanding, for our disorders have proceeded not onely from the inclinations or imbecility of some few Princes, or the corruptness of their Ministers, in this latter age, but if you consider the management of affaires in the whole series of our Kings since the first original of this Monarchy, you may observe such a strange defect of judgement, as if from the beginning the heavenly powers depriving us of the use of reason, had ordained us for destruction. All other Nations in the world, when they first established their Empire, aiming at continuance, prescribed to themselves certain fundamental laws, as well concerning the succession as the Government, which should remain immutable to all posterity; and considering their own true proper interest, in relation to other people, proposed a certain end, and ordained pollitick maximes, by which those that are intrusted with the management of affaires must direct their councels for the advancement of that interest, So that whosoever is ambitious to participate the honours of the Commonwealth frames his studies and actions wholly according to those Principles, and they being unalterable, the State is never destitute of able, and expert Ministers. By these Maximes still tending to the same end, that State which had no other Original, then a small company of fugitives in a few scattered desolate Islands, hath justly obtained the title of the Virgin Commonwealth, still flourishing and increasing, and never receding from her first Principles, never suffering any change either in her customes or government. The Grecians by a renowned constancy, and preservation in their designes have gained such large limits, that the Sun never sets upon their Dominions. The Romans by adhering so firmly to their owne constitutitutions, have so many ages, had such a swaying influence upon most Kingdomes of the world; and though their Emperours be Elective, and often chosen out of Families of different interests, yet once elected, imbracing resolutely those of the Empire, though himself slept, and his Ministers were wallowing in those luxuries of which they are so frequently accused, yet their affaires, continuing in the same setled course, would still prosper with the same success, and their greatness be the envy of all other Nations. The Sicilians who are condemned of so much levity, notwithstanding by the like constancy to their first institutions, have many hundred years enjoyed vast Territory, with an uninterrupted succession of their Monarchs: And even Peloponesus a poor inconsiderable corner of Greece , inhabited by a rude boarish people, and besides a mighty Emperour, having the Sea a continual enemy, is notwithstanding, by remaining true to their Maxims, in a short time become a potent State, and as they all finde by experience, a terrour to its Neighbours. Onely the Sicilians confident of their owne strength, and the natural defence of the Sea, despising all rules, and contemning their wisdom and vertue, have by degrees imbraced the imperfections and vices of all other Nations. The pride of the Grecians , The luxury of the Romans , The intemperance of the Peloponesians , The levity of the Sicilians , and in conclusion whatsoever may render them contemtible, or contribute to their own ruine. Our Ancestors indeed since the entrance of this last race, for I will look no higher, not yet declined into vice, nor softned with the delicacies of these moderne times, with an invincible courage, I confess, but with a kinde of a rude barbarous fiercenese, not onely preserved their own limits entire, but frequently invading the territories of their Neighbours, brought other Nations into their obedience. Nevertheless wanting a good foundation, and not directing their actions to any certain end, they could neither long enjoy those conquests, nor maintain any lasting peace amongst themselves. For what fruit remaines to us of all those famous victories in Galia , but the reproach of not being as prudent in preserving what we had gotten, as we were fortunate in the acquisition? And the frequent bloody strifes between our Kings and the Nobility, with those more lasting and more devouring between the two pretending families to the Crown, were but the necessary consequences of an ill composed government in the first institution, which neither sufficiently declaring in whom consisted that supream authority, which is necessary to the preservation of every Commonwealth, nor yet fully determining the right of succession, left a liberty to subjects to enlarge their priviledges by force, and to every one, as he had most power, the arbitrament of his owne interest. But not to be tedious in producing examples of our inconstancy; The often changing of alliances, and confedaracies, the uncertainty of our Councels; and the dayly introducing of new customes; there is no greater testimony of the defect in our primitive constitutions then the practice of this latter age, wherein the publick affaires have been still swayed by the interests or inclinations of particular persons. Eumenes , whilst he bore the sway, being by birth a Cyprian , reguardless of the honour, neglected the interest of our Sicely . Clearchus that great example of fortunes power, and impotency, who when she thought she had raised him to a secure height, in the favour of two mighty Monarchs, that constantly defended him from the rageing malice of the people, could not protect her so much beloved darling from that fatal stroke which was given by one of her most contemptible Vassals; was, though worthy of all his greatness, too much byassed by his own affections and measuring all mens sufficiency, and integrity, by a submiss compliance to his will, admitted none to the management of affaires, but those who were absolutely obedient to his commands. Eurideus succeeding in the Ministry, proceeded by other principles. Affrodarius despising the conduct of his predecessours, laid new foundations; and Evaldus differing from all others, not considering whether the ground were good, raised a glorious structure of imaginarie greatness upon a devouring quicksand, so that any the least mark remaines of that great designe, which was beheld with such general admiration by the whole world. Thus, what one built, another presently destroyed, and those active spirits, who sought to prefer themselves, neglecting the interests of their Country, applyed themselves onely to those studies that might render them most gratefull to the present favourites, who being most powerful, were most likely to advance their fortunes; Or if any with their owne fortunes, industriously endeavoured the advancement of the publick good, the chief work masters so often failing, and every new one serving himself with new instruments, and new materials, the old ones were either altogether useless, or through disesteam, or want of complyance, not regarded. That Country which is so unhappy to be governed by such depraved Councels, must of necessity be a nursery of factions, and discontents, which through those errors, and defects so abounded amongst us, that it was impossible they should be long contained within the bounds of duty: And Cenodoxius moved by the sense of his disgraces, finding the humors of men so congruent to his designs, through Vanity and Revenge, engaged us all in a miserable war, of which as he was himself the first Author, so himself hath first felt the cruel effects thereof. He hath freely confessed the fault, and you acknowledge his provocations have been great, wherefore if satisfyed with the punishment he hath already suffered, and what he alleadgeth as an excuse, can move your judgement to a mitigation of his offence, I fear the Arguments are pregnant enough to perswade you for the future to embrace his Amity. If it were possible, as you seem to intimate such a desire, to come to an agreement with Corastus , I should acquiess in that opinion, for he indeed so openly discovers his intentions, and those who adhere to his party, are a people of so much greater integrity, then either the Cyprians, or those of our own Nation, which favor Cenodoxius , that probably the Peace might be lasting, though obtained upon hard conditions. But the freedom of his declaration, manifests the firmness of his resolution; neither is it reasonable to suppose, that he, who hath undertaken so great an enterprise, and, without doubt satisfyed in the justness of his proceedings, having such powerful means to effect it, the chief strength of the kingdom in his hands, a mighty formidable Army, and in the possession of Palermo, an inexhaustible treasure, will easily abandon such advantages, when the success promiseth so great a reward. On the other side in his strength you may behold the Kings weakness, who though he hath obtained a slight victory over Cenodoxius , yet we know from whence that proceeds, and his own force is so inconsiderable, and so destitute of supplies to maintain the courage of the souldiers, that Corastus already assures himself of the victory. Wherefore your own strength not being sufficient to shelter you from so great a storm, you must by a timely assistance seek to prevent the so much threatned danger. From whence then shall we expect these succors? If you depend upon supplies from abroad, you already know by experience, the fruitlesness of those expectations, but that you may no longer be deluded with such vain hopes, consider with how little reason they have been hitherto entertained. The Grecian Emperors have received so many horrible great affronts, and indignities from the Sicilian Crown, that Andronicus who now sways that Scepter, cannot but with pleasure behold the oppression of the royal Family. For though Theodora during the reign of her sister, ought the preservation of her life to the son of that famous Emperor, who devesting himself of his royalty, added immortality to his glory; yet being seated in the Throne, she not onely refused his alliance, (which though perhaps in it self just, was a large testimony of his affection) but in a time of Peace, not any occasion being given, with fire and sword invaded his Dominions: And afterwards, contrary to all Laws of Equity when the Peloponesians revolted, with mighty supplies both of men and treasure, maintained them in their Rebellion. Neither hath the King your father given less occasion of offence, where with scorn rejecting the sister of this present Emperor, he immediately contracted an alliance with his greatest enemy. Nor content with that affront when one of his chiefest Provinces, shaking off the Imperial yoak set up an usurping King of their own, he without difficulty receiving the Ambassadors of that new created Soveraign, both justifyed his actions, and allowed a power of election in the people. Wherefore the match with the Princess Mariana , by the death of young Leonides , taking no greater an effect, it cannot be expected now he apprehends not your power, that he will commiserate your sufferings. However though help fail on that side, you may imagine the brother of Eudoxia will never suffer a King, so neer an allye, in a case of such exigence to remain destitute of ayd. Alas! He, and his great Minister, that strong support of his masters glory, Armandus , haue not contributed a little to these our disorders, though I must confess, not without mighty provocations; for besides that never any rebellions, as they have been very frequent, were ever stirred up by any of the great Princes in that kingdom, but either they were fomented or strenuously abetted by Antiochus , in their greatest extremities, when oppressed by a foraign enemy, we have likewise, notwithstanding the alliance, and most unexpected propositions that have been made to our advantage, refused them our assistance. Wherefore Armandus whose pollicies had a general influence, since we would not accept of his offers, to shew his friendship was not to be despised, and to let us know, our peace proceeded not from our own prudent conduct, but from the distractions of others; in that height of our felicity, when surfeited with happiness, we were grown insolent, as with an unconcerned indifferency, to behold the sword, and destruction ravageing the dominions of our neighbours, yet neither through generosity, nor compassion, endeavouring to appease them, He by his practises kindled that fire in the Cottages of Cyprus , which hath since consumed, and laid desolate, many of the stateliest Palaces: And though by this time, perhaps, satisfyed with their revenge, they would prevent our final ruine, they are now so assaulted on every side themselves, that it is not in their power. The Peloponesians likewise forgetting they owe their liberty, to our predecessors, moved with some slight injuries, and loving your enemies mony better then your cause, are corrupted to be spectators of the Tragedy. For the Romans your self too well know the terms we stand upon with them, in consideration of the Princess Theophania . Other Princes are so remote that they are unconcerned in our differences. And to conclude having in our prosperity separated our interests from all the world, and never had a feeling of others, we ought not to expect that any should have a sense of our miseries. Since then in this necessity of friends, there is no variety of choice, there need no other motives then the consideration of your own security, to perswade you to a reconciliation with Canodoxius . But though all neighbouring Princes were ready to afford you their best assistance, foreign forces are so odious to your own subjects, that they would little advantage your cause. Besides you need not doubt of the fidelity, and real engagement of the Cenodoxians , for they very well know, if you receive them not into favor, they are absolutely ruined, and though moved principally by their own interest, they fight in your defence, yet a Prince who is deputed by Heaven, to exercise a kingly power upon Earth, ought in this to imitate the supreme Divinity, that though the people only through fear of punishment are obedient to his Laws, yet whilst they perform their duty, he refuseth them not his protection. Whereupon the Prince perceiving he made a stop; it is enough said he. I confess my self vanquished; and furnished with these reasons shall easily induce the King to imbrace your advice. But my dear Synecius , my Father; my Oaacle, is it not possible, though not the affection you bear to Alexandro yet the duty that you owe to your Country, should withdraw you from this retirement? Though you have made no mention of them, I am not ignorant of your sufferings, and the Heavens be so favourable to Alexandro , as he will be just in the reparation of them. Sir, replyed Synesius , this retirement is an effect of my obedience, and in obeying my Soveraign, I at once testifie my loyalty unto him, discharge the duty I owe to my Country, and best merit your favor. They had entred farther into this obliging discourse, but interrupted with a sudden noise, they went both to see what should be the occasion thereof; when passing through the great Hall, towards the Gate, they were encountred by a multitude of country people, all armed with rustick weapons, and some bearing in several parts of their bodies, the fresh bleeding marks of a terrible scuffle; but as a token of their victory, they lead pinioned amongst them nine or ten men, who by their appearance seemed to be souldiers, and by their sad dejected countenances, sensible of their disgrace. By this time Demetrius , with Lysander and the rest, were run to the bruit, and the Peasants as soon as they saw their Lord, making a stand, without any confusion, which commonly accompanies such assemblies, gave way to a young man, a rich Farmers son of the Village, that bore a great sway amongst them, who stepping forward, whilst the rest were silent, with a very good grace, and in terms better then his habit promised, said, Having some days together repaired to the adjacent woods in search of cattle that were straied, these two last, I observed divers soldiers likewise frequented the same whom I met somtimes two, somtimes three, and once discovered twelve together refreshing themselves by a spring, whether unless by some extraordinary chance, not any man ever resorteth. Wherefore seeing them lie so concealed, I supposed they were either the consorts of those that had caused the late disorder, or else were appointed for some more mischievous intentions: so that possessed with this apprehension, having advertised my neighbours thereof, we surprised them this day again in the same thicket feeding upon such provision as they carried about them, and though unarmed, every man laying hold of his Sword, they made so stout a resistance, that many of my companions bear, as you see, the marks of their valor. But at length being hedged in on every side, and three of their associates already slain; the rest throwing down their weapons, yielded themselves all, saving that (pointing to one who held by half a dozen, was stronglyer fettered then all the rest) I know not whether to call him, more, or less then man; for though in his defence he shewed a courage more then humane, yet so obstinately to resist such a multitude, was rather the testimony of a savage fierceness, then of a courage guided by reason. His looks threatned to devour, and when moved by compassion to see so much valour so desperately employed, intreating him to yield, we offered him his life, disdaining our courtesies, as assured of the prey, he ran more furiously upon his assailants. Nevertheless he was at the length overthrown by his own strength, for with a prodigious force directing a blow at my self, missing his aim, and following his stroke, his feet failing, he fell to the ground; whereupon half a dozen of our most resolute men at the same instant falling upon him, he was rather catched as in a toil, then taken. What himself and his fellows did intend, we know not, nor were we so over curious to seek to force that from them which they seemed so resolute to conceal; but by preventing of danger, in bringing them thus captived into your presence, we conceive we have performed our duty. The Princes exceedingly attentive to this relation, with curious eyes observed the comely personage of the valiant prisoner, who all this while never lift his eyes from the earth, till being asked by Synesius , with such civility as might oblige him to a reply, what he was? With a stern regard he boldly answered, A Souldier. I suppose no less, said he, But how came you hither? when with a disdainfull smile, he replyed, Hath not this gallant champion, who with his quaint Rhetorick cals valour brutality, already told you? By the vile cowardise of my companions, who basely yielding themselves, betrayed me into the hands of this rabble. It is not my intent, continued Synesius , to irritate you with unseasonable or impertinent demands, I mean, what designes brought you into these Quarters? My revenge, replyed the Souldier, which since I have failed of accomplishing upon my enemies, if I did not still retain hopes to satisfie, I would presently execute upon my self. Whereupon Alexandro steping forward, said, so great a courage ought not to be vanquished by despair; if your quarrel be just, you shall not want the liberty in a noble way to prosecute your revenge, nor yet friends that will readily embrace your cause: But before we proceed any farther, tell me freely whose Souldier you are? When the Prisoner looking stedfastly upon him, with a more submiss, but with a countenance expressing something of disgust, answered, Should any here but your self, by asking that question, have dared so much as in thought, to doubt of my loyalty, my hands in despight of these fetters, without other reply, should soon have forced him to learn that truth, which by a natural sympathy with my heart, is so plainly charactered in my face. This answer discovering to Synesius that the Prisoner knew Alexandro , presently causing him and his companions to be loosened, with great commendations, and many thanks, especially to the young Farmer, he dismissed the Countrey people; and the Prince with his company retiring into another room, whether the Souldier was commanded to follow, after they were seated, he told him, I perceive you know me so well, that you cannot but know the respect you are obliged to bear me, yet I will not now use my power, but with entreaties perswade you to lay aside your fierceness, and in complyance with my curiosity, to acquaint us both what you are, and with the cause of your discontent. I dare not, said the Souldier, disobey so great an authority, though to any else I might justly excuse my self, in the renewing the remembrance of my griefs, not to add to my torments; But since so sad a Story cannot but make impressions in a Princely heart, it will be some comfort to my miseries, that they have been honoured with so noble a compassion. When breathing forth a mighty sigh, which like a sudden tempest, ended with a few dissolving drops, after a little pause he entred into this tragical Relation. they merit not the report of fame, rendred me unworthy the name of Clorimanthes ; what wants in performance, hath been supplyed by loyal intentions, for since I was first able to wield a sword, I have employed mine in the service of my Prince, under the command of that renowned Captain Honorius , who for his signalized fidelity is entrusted with the Government of that impregnable Cittadel which awes the inhabitants of a City six Leagues from hence, and though not great, the most considerable place next Nicosia , that now remains in the Kings obedience. To this City, drawn by the worthy esteem of the Governor, resorted divers young Cavaliers, under his discipline to passe their noviciat in the War; but amongst the rest, none better employed his time, or arived at a higher degree of perfection in all martial exercises then Perrotus , who by the advantagious endowments both of body and mind, gained an absolute dominion over the affections of all those that had the honour to know him; for my own part, I was so true an admirer of his vertues, that his heart was the treasury of mine, and he was so faithfull a Steward, that he both preserved the principal, and paid me such a large proportion of Interest, that our friendship being observed, was paragoned with the best examples of antient times. We consorted our selves together in all actions either of danger, or recreation: our thoughts were so vniform, that whatsoever pleased the one, was the delight of the other, and even our loves, which it was impossible to separate, by the secret sympathy of our souls, were without jealousies or emulation, directed both to the same object. Our Academie of Mars was not without a Temples of Venus , to whom all his Disciples offered the devotion of their hearts. A virgin, besides the advantages of her birth, which, being the sole heir of the illustrious Family of the Amelsi , gave her the preheminence, both for nobility and wealth, adorned with such a resplendant beauty, that her tragical end may be thought to proceed from the malignity of the heavens, through envie that the earth should enjoy another Sun. The day of our horizon brake from under that aromatical cloud, her Ivory forehead, and set in an ocean of tears flowing from those eyes to whom she obscured her self. When Monelia , so was this Luminary called, was pleased to enlighten the air with her presence, all that beheld her, astonished with so much brightness, to avoid a sudden dazling, fell prostrate on the earth as she passed by; or if any were so presumptuous to fix his view upon her face, if her eyes by chance encountred his, they darted forth such beams, as at once confounded his sight, and in punishment of his temerity, kindled a consuming fire in his heart. In the sacred Temple of Jupiter , assisting at the pomp of her Fathers Funeral, Perrotus and my self, being inseparable companions, first beheld this miracle of Nature, and whilst kneeling before the Hearse, with tears of piety she expressed a sorrow worthy so dear a loss, by the interposition of that watry cloud; we were able with less dazling to gaze upon her perfections. Perrotus after a long contemplation, first discovering his wound, brake out into these expressions, Oh the supernatural power of a filial affection, that from the elemental purity of two such glorious flames, whose spendor might afford light to the Universe, can extract such Cataracts, as rather threaten an inundation, and yet not be themselves extinguished! More miraculous, said I, is that contrariety, and even a prodigie in nature, when fire and water yield a mutual nourishment to each other. Those Torches of love, are the fountains of those pious tears, and every one of those cristal drops, is fewel to kindle the triumphant fires of love. You heated by those showres, already burn, and I chilled by those flames, at the same instant feel my heart oppressed with a cold damp of dispair. Ah Clorimanthes , replyed he, do not yet despair, for then, such is the influence of our stars, which hath ordained us both to the same martyrdom, that it will be impossible for me to hope, and depriving me of that consolation, thou wilt at once become the author of my death, and which is more cruel, injurious to our friendship. Srange effect of an unparalelled amity, to desire a rival in the contests of love, to animate those thoughts which are diametrically opposite to our happiness, to aim at fruition, in opening a way to another possession, and to seek a partner in those joyes, which are only perfect whilst they are not only communicative. But Perrotus by my concurrence, judged the worthiness of his affection, and because with such a discerning judgement, he placed his affection upon the divine Monelia , I thought him the more worthy of my esteem: So that the ardor of our loves, was the cement of our friendship, and by cherishing that Noble flame, as our desires encreased, we grew more enamoured of each others vertue. This was the original of that fatal love, which beginning in the sad obsequies of a dead Father, had likewise a most lamentable conclusion. Nevertheless at the present we flattered our selves with the hopes of a farr better success, when the ceremonies being ended, and Monelia supported by two of her nearest allies, returning out of the Temple, and stopt by the croud of people, made a stand just at the Pillar, which during the solemnity, had been our station, and offering her the convenience of that place to repose her self from the press, with a gracious bending of her body she accepted of our civilitie. There at a nearer distance, but through a scarf of thin black Tiffany, we surveyed those perfections, which believing immortal, we were ready to adore, till perceiving our boldness, she pulled down her great vail; and when with one offended look, she might as easily have struck us both dead, was pleased only with that gentle cruelty to check our presumption. But the throng once passed, being retired to her Palace, she was so strict an observer of the rules of mourning, that many weeks after not stirring abroad, nor admitting any visits but the condoleances of her kindred, we could not possibly arive at that felicity, to be blessed with the sight of her fair eyes, much less by any assay of our fortunes, to begin the progress to our happiness. We daily visited those Walls which enclosed the habitation of our Deity, whether multitudes of souls continually flocked to offer up their devotions; We went frequently to the Temple to reverence those stones which she had hallowed with her tears; we presumed to possess that seat, which was the throne wherein with such mildness she reproved our audacity, and at length one day as we sate thereon, discovering of that passage, we perceived walking by us, attended only by two maids, the Saint that we adored. It was the first time after her retirement, that she appeared again to the world, and therefore as others out of custom, she through a devout zeal made her motions to the Altar; at the steps whereof whilst in an humble posture she implored the protection of the God, Perrotus , transported with I know not what rapsodie, not saying any thing to me went directly to the degrees, and kneeling close by her, with his eyes fixed upon the holy Image, but with his heart directed to Monelia , in a low tone, yet so that she might easily hear him, formed his orizons after this manner. Hail blessed Deity! Thou celestial purity, the Soveraign of my heart, the period of my desires, the soul of my life, my only good! Though I dare not presume to exalt my eyes to the Majesty of such a heavenly beauty, vouchsafe to turn thy favourable regards upon the wretched captive Perrotus , either ease him of his torments, or in compassion end them with his life. This short supplication was uttered with such fervency, as sufficiently expressed the zeal of the supplicant; but the boldness of the attempt so surprised Monelia , who very well perceived to whom it was addressed, that remaining a while immoveable, she appeared as one through excess of order in her devotions ravished into an extasie, wholly alienated from her senses. Nevertheless recovering her self, she presently rise, and glancing a look on him, which he could not interpret other then a messenger of her displeasure, beckning her Maids, who waited at a distance, hasted out of the Temple, but through disorder, and confusion, leaving a scarfe upon the Pavement, which he instantly with a trembling hand took up, that favour of hazard, made him give it a contrary construction. Wherefore with infinite content, but with a pale discomposed countenance returning agen to the place, where with admiration I beheld the extravagance of his proceeding, he recounted to me the particulars, and success of his audacity. I must confess, though I conceived his indiscretion unpardonable, yet not to cast him into dispaire, I dissembled my opinion, which at length I found was indeed erroneous. For frequenting all publick assemblies, that we might have the opportunity to meet Monelia , and to insinuate our selves into her conversation, she cast such favourable regards upon my friend, that I, who observed all her gestures, perceived she was not displeased with his observances. Notwithstanding fearing her blushes would betray more then her modesty was willing to discover, she avoided as much as was possible, all opportunities of discourse; which she not onely graciously afforded me, but would oftentimes her self minister the occasion, and one night at a Ball, being seated just behind her, whilst Perrotus danced with a young Lady, her most intimate confident, turning about to me; I wonder, said she, that so hardy a Cavalier as Perrotus hath not yet by his addresses shewed a particular inclination to some choice beauty; Or doth he display that black ensigne, meaning the scarfe, which he concontinually wore about his arm, to shew that his heart is dead to love? Rather, replyed I, the fair one that bestowed it upon him, meant it as an emblem of her cruelty, as willing to afford him no other favour but the livery of dispaire, for aspiring to a fortune so far above his merit; and in acknowledging his crime, to mourn for his presumption, in having dared to boldly to declare his passion. These words, perceiving to what they tended, made her whole face appear a garden of full blown Roses, wherefore apprehending to be too far engaged upon that subject, converting her blushes into a smile, she asked me if being perhaps more discreet, I were not more fortunate in my love? To which I presently returned answer; If never to have presumed to say I love, be free from offence; Or if to enjoy all that ever I may pretend, be a happiness, I may justly vaunt my self both discreet and fortunate. However though I dare not by an unworthy mention, prophane her name, who vouchsafes to afford me such comfort, I I may without endangering her despleasure tell you, that I have a competitor in my love, yet, which perchance you will think a miracle, his rivality, though I were assured he would arive at his desires, can no way traverse my pretences. But to solve this Enigma, a secret instinct of nature works such a Sympathy between Perrotus and me, that one divine beauty is the center of both our ambitions, her whom he admires, I admire, The object of my delight is the soul of his content, and the Sun that yeilds him light, by the same vertue inspires me with life. Onely in this we differ, that his desires, with a noble ardor, aim at a chaste fruition, but my flame is so pure and sublime, that it hath purged the dross of all low sensual appetites; And whilst he with uncertain hopes pursues the dictates of that generous passion, I, approaching her person, and admitted to a familiarity of conversation in contemplating her better part, her soul, enjoy a happiness which it is as impossible should suffer any diminution, as it is that she should decline from her vertue. Wherefore though the influence of our stars, in submitting us both to the same fate, threatned the dissolution of a loyal friendship, the supream powers, protector of such holy leagues, have by regulating our affections, more firmly united our hearts and the Goddess to whom we direct our addressess, when she frowns upon the one, torments the other, and if she would be so gracious, in satisfying both, can offend neither. But whilst they contendingly submit to each others merit, may by the beams of her favour communicate to the one all earthly joyes, to the other more sublimed pleasures, till their souls Evaporating in those amorous delights, ascend to a perfect fruition of her celestial perfections. So whilst the glorious light of the world, into the displayed bosome of the amorous Heliotropian , darts his directests beams, his cherishing warmth affords likewise beauty, and sweetness to the neighbouring rose, yet both growing on to perfection, flourish without emulation, till the same power which gave them being, greedy of their precious odors, with ardent Caresses extracting their vital moisture, they expire, a sacrifice of perfume to the adored author both of their life and death. Thus Monelia in declining the discourse of Perrotus temerity, found her self more embrased with this submiss declaration, of my no less temerarious, though more refined passion. Notwithstanding the assembly then breaking up respited the doom I expected from so rigorous a Judge, and in the mean while, what I had said, made such happy impressions, that consulting with her thoughts, and finding her charity could not be prejudicial to her honour, through a generous compassion she afforded relief to our sufferings, so that at length Perrotus became possessor of that rich mine of treasure, which yeilded me abundance of wealth, yet diminished nothing of his owne store. A Diamond abates nothing of his hardness, receives no stain, nor is of less worth the owner in being considered by a skilful Lapidary, who understanding the true value thereof, with admiration contemplates its oriental lustre. No more did Monelias perfections receive any change or blemish, nor were less esteemed by her dear Perrotus, because I paid them that reverence which was due to their incomparable worth, but he in the possession, and I in the contemplations of her divine excellencies, enjoyed such an absolute content that it wanted nothing of perfect but immortality, till the supream powers to shew a great example to the world, that there is no true felicity, but in their celestial mansions, from that height of happiness suffered us to be precipitated into a bottomless sea of misery, which the two peerless lovers have already dyed with their blood, and wherein I yet struggle for life, onely through a desire, if the heavens will so permit, by a dire revenge to appease their incensed ghosts. But whilst we lived favoured by fortune, though Perrotus was indulgent to his love, he was not neglected of his honour, nor was I so ravished with the contemplation of vertue that I wholly neglected the practical part thereof: Being by profession Souldiers, we are obliged in the occasions of war to pursue glory, of which we were the more ambitious that we might in some degree correspond with the merits of Monelia, and by our powers gain lawrels not to crown our own browes, but to plant her an ever flourishing garden of delight. Wherefore though whilst we were Probationers in that noble science, we ever fought under the same Ensignes, yet grown more mature in practice, being honoured with several commands, we were many times separated as the service of our Prince required; and whilst I was employed in this last expedition against Cenodoxius. Honorius being avertised that the two sons of the Lord Synesius, Philemon and Gernolanus , two persons of such excellent judgement, and conduct, that being fallen from their first Principles, they were no less esteemed by Corastus , then dangerous enemies to the King, either to raise new forces, or for some other pernicious design, under pretence of a visit to their father, received harbor in this Palace, being persons of such consequence, and of a known courage, Perrotus , with vvhat Troops he should think necessary for the enterprise, vvas appointed either by force or surprisal to bring them prisoners to Which charge he willingly undertook because he was well acquainted with the Country, and being to enter into the enemies quarters, having besides an intention if the first design succeeded, or not, to make some other attempt, he marched out two thousand strong, the gross whereof he left in a valley some two leagues from hence, whilst with one choice Troop he advanced to a Wood at the entry of the Park, where commanding them to lie concealed under the covert thereof, having chosen out three small parties of his most experienced men, he sent two of them under the command of Diphilus and Erato , two Cavaliers of a tryed courage, by several ways through the Parke, and himself with the third went a little compass about, through the Wood, where we encountred that rabble of Peasants, with a purpose that none might escape, to surround the house, and so without farther violence, unless they met resistance, to require the two brothers to be delivered into their hands. Erato taking the lower way in a solitary remote walk, met two Gentlemen, one whereof by the description had been made to him he conceived was Philemon , who being unarmed without any difficulty suffered himself to be taken, and Erato sending him guarded to the Wood, went with this good news to seek Diphilus , whom he found engaged, close by a Grot, upon the Mount with one of an invincible courage, who by the like mistake he believed to be Gernolanus , but with the loss of both his hands, the death of Erato , and two or three more of his companions paid the forfeiture of that errour, wherefore not able longer to withstand so great a force, his souldiers fled with him towards the Wood, whether being eagerly pursued by the Conqueror, surrounded by the Troop that lay there in ambush, he was forced to yield; when supposing themselves possessed of the prey that they hunted after, they presently marched away to their main body, where by some of the principal Officers, the two prisoners were soon known to be Prince Philocles and his servant Cleanthes , who notwithstanding the mischief he had done them, was received with great shouts and acclamations of joy, neither was Philocles displeased though he very much regretted the misfortune of Diphilus and Erato, to find himself secure amongst the Kings friends. But this mutual rejoycing was turned into a general consternation, when the remainder of Perrotus party flying from the fury of the two enraged brothers, whom it was his chance to encounter in the adjacent Wood, related the miserable fall of their valiant Captain, the only mirror for Lovers, the envy of husbands, the soul of all Society, and a miracle of friendship. Whereupon sighs stopping the current of his speech, the Princes and Synesius looking sadly and with astonishment one upon another, they all knew by the circumstances, that Alexandro had been a principal actor in thls Tragedy, yet remaining silent: Oh mighty Jupiter, continued he, doest thou now rather seek the attribute of powerful, then equitable, by such extraordinary means, (for it was not their courage alone could protect them from the justice of his sword,) to support Traytors and Rebels against an unequalled example of Obedience, and Loyalty! Where shall Vertue, and Truth seek for refuge, if thou sufferest them thus in their followers, to be prosecuted and dishonored? for in depriving us of Perrotus , thou hast deprived us of all that in man could be called excellent. But not to give farther vent to my griefs, the mournful nevvs of his death being by his dejected Troops carryed to Palermo , he vvas bevvailed as a publick loss: but ariving at the ears of his so dearly cherished spouse, though she appeared a little surprised therevvith as first, contrary to all expectation, she vvas so far from abandoning her self to sorrovv, that she scarce expressed so much grief as was decent; but instantly calling for Lucius , one of Perrotus his servants, who had been present in the action, as if unconcerned, or delighting in her loss, made him relate every particular passage of that fatal encounter, and as though she doubted they had not been sufficient, curiously informed her self how many wounds he had received, in what part of his body, which was the most deadly, and whether Philemon , or Gernolanus had given that mortal stroak. When having satisfied her as far as he was able, and to justifie himself, shewed her the yet fresh bleeding testimonies of his fidelity; she with a kind of smile; telling him they were but scratches, which would serve him to boast of as marks of honour, amongst his companions, dismissed him her presence; and I the same day returning from the Army, not knowing any thing of this disaster, but hasting to embrace my friend without stopping, rid directly to his Palace, and dismounting at the gate, encountered that faithful servant, with tears flowing in his eyes, his countenance pale, and his limbs trembling, descending from his Ladies Chamber: At which gastly sight, presaging the worst, I began not to be a little perplexed, but was wholly confounded, when at once telling me of his Masters death, and his Ladies indifferency, crying out he had lived too long, to be the witness of such a monstrous ingratitude, through excess of grief, and want of spirits, which had issued out with his blood, embracing my knees, he fell immediately dead at my feet. Good heavens! how at this mutation of fortune, rage, grief, and pitty, at once strugling together in my bosom, destroyed each other, yet neither obtained the victory! In beholding that sad spectacle of a loyal servants fidelity, I was all compassion, then reflecting on the bloudy slaughter of my friend, I thought I saw his gaping wounds crying out to me for vengeance, which at the instant inflamed me with an unquenchable fury; but then considering, that by a prodigious change, Monelia was now no more the same, but the sepulchre of her own vertue, senseless of pitty, and regardless of revenge through extremity of anguish, I was ready to sacrifice my own, life in expiation of her inconstancy, to the grieved ghost of her noble husband; yet aiming a poignard at my heart, the other passions were so strong, that they withheld my arm, and I remained the prey, of their cruel contestation. Had not Lucius avouched it with his death, and had not his death been a testimony of his truth, I could not possibly have credited such an unnatural failing; Nevertheless having something recollected my self, I resolved once more to see her, and to perswade her, though she had lost her vertue, not to bring an infamy upon the whole sex, by a too open manifestation of her frailty. Wherefore using my former liberty, without a guide, I ascended the degrees, and passing through the outward room, approaching softly to the chamber dore, which being open, in putting by the Tapistrie, I perceived her sitting at a Table, with her back towards me, as in a posture of writing. I must confess, finding she neither saw, nor heard me, I could not but make a little stand, to observe with what an undisturbed tranquility of minde, she busied her self in such unseasonable employments: But I was astonished, when on a suddain she cryed out, I come Perrotus ; and at the same instant that she spake those words, rising from her seat, and aided with a more then masculine courage, she plunged a Dagger into her bosome, found an easie passage to her heart. Oh Heavens! how my blood chilled when I beheld her fall? At the noise whereof a maide that waited in another roome, came running, though in vain, to her assistance, whilst I through amazement, knew not whether to believe Lucius death a dreame, or this Tragicall Sceane a vision. But approaching nearer, I found it was indeed the very same, Constant, Chaste, Monelia , in this last act of her life, displaying the crimson Ensignes of a Triumphant Vertue. I cannot say which was greater at the present, my joy, to be so undeceived, or my grief to see the world bereaved of so glorious an ornament. Whilst I bathed her wound with my tears, through which her precious life expired, I kissed that heroick hand, which still grasped the reeking instrument, that had freed me from my fears. But in applauding her resolution, and in bewailing her cruel fate, she became sensible of my expressions, for opening her fair eyes, with a smiling countenance she embraced me, and pointing to the Table, without saying a word, and without either pang or groan, but still and quiet, as the gentle calm of a sweet spring-tide-evening, that fair Sun set in the vermilion cloud. Thus deprived of my light I was seized with a kind of horror and my feeble limbs being scarcely able to support the burden or my greifs, leaning against the table, I perceiued lying theron a paper directed to my self, written with carracters of blood which I stil preserve about me as the warrant I have to live til her commands be fulfilled. Wherupon drawing it forth of his bosom, he delivered it to Prince Alexandro who whilst he disburdened himself of a world of sighs, read aloud this short Billet. testifie the purity of my chaste love; being a woman, I can only accompany him in death, to thee I leave the honor in the punishment of his murtherers, to shew thy self worthy the name of friend, and the esteem of MONELIA. Having finished the reading hereof, now, said Clorimanthes , judge of the equity of my cause, and I doubt not but you will give me leave to prosecute my revenge, which, though in the presence of Synesius , I dare avow, can never be satisfied, but with the blood of his own sons. This sad tragedie moved a wonderfull compassion in the hearers, and exceedingly augmented the griefs of Alexandro , who perceiving Synesius expected he should say something to appease the causeless hate of Clorimanthes , taking him by the hand, and embracing him, The heavens, said he, Clorimanthes , are witness, with what a true sense of sorrow, I have heard the woful story of your unfortunate friends: I confess as well to satisfie your own honor, as the commands of Monelia , you are obliged to seek revenge upon the authors of their death, and I confirm my promise to aid you in the pursuit thereof; but you must first find out who they were that have offended, and against whom you are so justly incensed, for I can assure you upon the word of a Prince, that neither Philemon , nor Gernolanus, are the persons at whom you ought to direct your fury. Therefore if you esteem your honour, or desire a certain revenge,
