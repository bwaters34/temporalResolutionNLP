 in this Book cannot be so great as His, who shall Condemn what has bin Written for you, and is by Your own Allowance humbly addrest to You. Nothing less then Your Name could be my Sanctuary; and nothing more than your Name can make it Inviolable. If ever your Royal Highness can give away so much of your time as must be Imploy'd in Reading this Tome, You will find in it the Fairest, the greatest, and the most Vertuous Princess of Asia so much divided between what she ows to Her Quality, and her Obedience, and what she ows to her Inclinations, and Her gratitude, as possibly your Royal Highness may oblige Her at once, both with your Pity and your Kindness. But Madam, she has Commanded me to assure you, that if you will Honor Her with the Last, she will neither desire, nor need the First. Your Concernments for Her Misfortunes will put a Period to them; since she cannot lament any Cause, which will Produce for Her so Advantageous an Effect. I did once design to have Ended Her story in this Book; But the Vicissitudes of Her Fate were so many, and so various, that I could not confine it within so narrow a compass. Nor was I Over-much solicitous to do it; For since I limit my self in the main Events to to the Truth of the History, I was Apprehensive, Madam, that the ill Result of Her Destiny might have given you as much Trouble, as the ill Stile in which I should have related it. But Madam, rather than to Apolologize, for having Written no more, I should humbly beg your Pardon, for having written so much. And since nothing can be a nobler Motive to forgive an Offence (especially where the Person offended is equally merciful and generous) than Ingenuously to acknowledge it; I will confess; that being to draw the most Excellent Princess of that Age, I took for my Model the most Accomplisht of Ours. And to make the Portraicture of the fair Methridatia , I attempted Madam to Make it resemble Yours. But I find the Coppy so unlike the Admirable Original, that I could not go more beyond my duty in the Design, than I am come short of my intention in the Event. But Madam, though who ever had been possest with my Ambition, must have fallen into my disappointment; for 'tis one of your Noblest Advantantages to be above discription; Yet I am so far from being grieved at my fault, as I rejoyce that I could not avoid comitting it. Since I had exceedingly rather want, than have the Power to Discribe You. As much as Your Royal Highness Transcends the Pontick Princess in all the Guifts of Nature, and Excellencies of the Mind. May You by so much surpass Her in All the Services of Fortune and the Felicities of Power; And may you be inclin'd to Extend one Evidence of the Latter, by pardoning the confidence of laying at your Feet this Tribute now Paid You by Madam, Your Royal Highnesses most Humble, most Obedient, and most Devoted Servant.

The Continuation of Callimachus his HISTORY . so full of Horrors for me, that nothing could Equal it; and in a Condition so far above the hope of Remedy, that nothing could be more; for that Fatal day was come, which was to place the Princess Statira in an Estate, far more inaccessible to me, than she had been, either by the height of her Quality or the Lowness of mine, As vast disproportions as those having been often Equall'd by Love; and had I been so bless'd as to have obtained hers, the other Obstacle had been Conquer'd as an Effect of that Victory; But now her Vows were so Intirely to confine her to the Happy Ascanius affection, That to have Sollicited hers, would have been an Action as void of Hope as Virtue; Already the Sacrifices were brought to the Temple; The Augures were there to Judge of the Prophetical part of the Victims; The People by the way began to sing the usual Songs, in Honor of Hymen; The Tryumphal Arches were Imbellish'd with their Noblest Ornaments; The Priest which was to Joyn their Hands, stood ready at the Altar; and the Cyprian King himself, with looks as full of Felicity as his Condition was, came at last leading Statira into Ataphernes Chamber, to Sollicite his Presence and Company, at the Nuptial Solemnities; This sight, Generous Princes, This sight had so Universal an Influence on me, that had not Ascanius been absolutely intent upon his Request, he might have easily seen my Disorders, and as easily have imagined their Cause; I had not the Confidence, or Resolution, to speak one word to the Princess; But my Eyes were so unmovably fixed upon hers, and were so sad, and languishing, that they proved no uneloquent Orators; for I perceived the Brightness of hers began to be obscured with a Cloud, which would have dissolved into Tears, had not the Cyprian King turned towards her, to implore the joyning of her Desires to his Prayers, where by she had been surprised in a disorder, which though she had much Trouble to Conquer, yet (I believe) it did not equal that which had occasioned it; from which flattering Belief, I had still new cause to condemn my Fortune, which never gave me pleasing hopes, but to torment me; for my condition was such, That I more needed what would send me to the Grave, than what might dissuade me from it; had I been Master of my own reason, I should have attributed Statira's grief, to her being so near a performance, which would separate her from a Brother, whose loss might have but too abundantly justified the highest effect thereof; and not have ascribed that Noble sorrow, to some Esteem she had for the unhappy Callimachus , whose Condition, and Services were too Low to hope for such a Felicity. The Generous Ataphernes was not conquered by Statira , or Ascanius , Sollicitations. Excusing himself upon the Account of his want of health, which going into the Air, might so much increase, that it might prove an Interruption in those Ceremonies: Though the real Cause was, That he would not assist at a Solemnity, which was to Cost him (as he afterwards told me) the deprivation of his Sister, and possibly the loss of his friend. The King of Cyprus (not a little troubled at this Refusal, which he disguised by saying, he was as much afflicted for that Indisposition which denied him the honour of his Company, as at the want of it) soon after took his Leave; Mithridates sending him word that all things were ready if he were. This happy Summons, he Joyfully obeyed, and blush'd that he had needed it, and leading out the Princess, went to possess a happiness as much above Merit, as Description; But whilst I reflected thereon, all my passions broke their Chains, and did so violently Agitate me, that my Reason could not more Torment me, than they (at that time) did; and though Ataphernes Endeavoured by his Arguings, and his simpathising with me, to persuade me to moderate a grief, which I could not Cure, yet all his Attempts were in vain; I could not consider what Statira was gone to do, without giving my self as much up to despair, as she was to give her self up to Ascanius : The very remembrance of whose Name, seemed to Add more Fire to my rage; in the dictates whereof, I thought such Extravagant things, that (if my memory could serve me to repeat them) yet I should be ashamed to do it. What Condition (Generous hearers) could be more Irrecoverable, than mine seemed to be; Which I have the more particularly told you, to raise your hopes, or hinder your despair, for your own; for just in the moment I had cause to believe Statira might be giving her hand and faith to the Cyprian King, Demetrius came running hastily into the Chamber, (and losing that respect he owed to the Prince) he told me, I have brought you (Sir) an Intelligence, which (doubtless) will exceedingly surprise you, if at least it hath the like Operation on you, which it had, and has, on all that Great Assembly in the Temple; At the Gate whereof, a Gentleman who had rid Post, in Haste Acquainted Mithridates , that his, and the King of Cyprus Fleet had fought with Nicomedes's , in the Prospect of the City of Carri , where after a bloody dispute Nicomedes had remained the Conquerour, and that so Intirely, as hardly any one had Escaped; But a few Quinquereme Galleys: That Arsides, Ascanius's Brother, and Admiral, had been Kill'd in the first Heat of the Battle, which had not a little Contributed to the Enemies Success; Who immediatly after, the wind blowing from the North, had hoised up all his Sayles, and as swiftly (as those and his Oars could carry him) made for the Bosphorus: And as the Governor of Scutari did Conjecture, would indeavour to surprise the Residue of the Cyprian Fleet, in the Bay of Nicomedia , who (if they got not Intelligence of their Friends defeat) might be Conquered by their Security, or (if they did) by their Fear, if Vigorously Assaulted on the first Impression of it. This Gentleman (whom the King knew to be a Person of Honesty and of Courage, and therefore through apprehension had not augmented the Loss or the Danger) had scarce done speaking, but several Posts came one upon the Heels of another with Advertisements from the several Governours on the Coast, that a Prodigious Fleet had already pass'd the straits of Bosphorus , and was with all Celerity doubling the Point of Acritas , which makes the North-West head-Land of the Bay of Nicomedia . These Re-iterated Assurances, gave the Two Kings no time for Consideration, there being scarce time enough left to prepare for Action. Ascanius's misfortunes could not appear greater to him, than his disorders did to all the Assembly; The loss of a Fleet, and a Brother much more Considerable, did seem sufficiently to Apologize for his Trouble, which yet he told the Princess had a higher cause than either or both of those. Which was, that by so Signal an Infelicity he should be cast into a greater, That of being a while suspended from Joys, which, if in degrees compared to his Losses, made them appear little; That his Brother and Navy could not have been Noblyer lost, than in her service, to whom all he had was both his dedication and his debt; That since Arsides was dead, there was no other but himself, with whom he durst Intrust the Remainder of a Fleet, which were to have the Glory, not only to fight for her, but before her; That he had often exclaim'd against the Excellency of his Fortune, which had destin'd him the Highest Happiness, and had still denied him the Opportunity of Acting what might make him the less unworthy of it; That therefore the Gods had now removed that Occasion of Complaint, and though it were at a high price, yet it was not at one he would decline to purchase it at; That he was confident this day should, in the conclusion, be as Signal for his advantage, as the beginning of it had been to his prejudice, and that since a few Hours would decide the difference, he Humbly begg'd, that all the preparations for the Nuptials might continue as they were, that at his Return with Victory; he might receive a Crown from her of Mirtles which he would infinitely value above one of Lawrel, and which would be a Cure above any misfortunes he had or could undergo. Mithridates was present all this while, and either to satisfie Ascanius's Request, or else to let the people see the confidence he had of Victory; He commanded all the Assistants to continue as they were, till that King's Return, and to joyn their Sacrifices and Prayers to his Arms. He then commanded Pharnaces to permit Ascanius to draw out of his Army, what Souldiers he should need to man his Fleet with; and the like Orders he sent to Ataphernes's forces: But the Cyprian King declin'd that High favour; possibly, lest whilst he brought Mithridates assistance, he should seem to need his. Ascanius had no sooner took leave of the Princess, and her Father, but he was followed by Pharnaces , who publickly declared, he was resolved to share in his Danger, and Triumph; That it was unjust another only should dispute his Quarrel, and he himself be but a Looker on; And that he would let Mithridates see, he wanted not Inclination, or Courage, but Fortune to have served him, as eminently as his Brother; with these and many such reasons (continued Demetrius ) he conquer'd Ascanius his resolution, and went with him on Board his Fleet, which, doubtless had been surprised, if the solemnity of this Day, which they were prepar'd to Celebrate, had not put them into a readiness; and scarce were they Ordered to prepare for the Battel, when the Enemy, who was to present Them it, appear'd. In this condition (said Demetrius ) I left things when I came from the Temple, and, if I be not much mistaken, there is a Tower at the end of the adjoyning Gallery, from whence you may see this Naval Fight. Oh Gods (continued Callimachus ) what retributions did I not pay you for this admirable Interruption, and Blessing, which in raptures I considered as the fore-runner of a greater? Nay, the Generous Ataphernes was himself overjoyed thereat; and in his Servant's concernment, seemed to have forgot those he had for his Father, and his Country. I begg'd his leave a Thousand times to contribute my help to those Forces which fought for Mithridates ; That I might imitate my Prince, by letting him see, I had a stronger inclination for what was his, and his Father's interest, than my own. But though he still resolutely denied me, yet I was not silenced till he told me, 'twould be fit I considered, That not only Ascanius , and Pharnaces , might esteem it as an offence, that uninvitedly I came to participate in their Glory; but that also, having declined to assist at the Nuptials for want of strength, if I could assist at the Fight, it might give some occasion to suspect by the one, what caused the other. These reasons (I confess) conquer'd me, and Demetrius then returning with assurance, that from the Tower he had mentioned, we could see all the Bay of Nicomedia , the Scene of the intended Fight; The Prince, and I, went thither, having first sent Orders to his Army to Imbattel themselves along the Shore, and to five thousand Men, to have a watchful Eye towards the City, lest upon any ill Success of the Fleet, it might be ready to receive her former King. As soon as we came to the uppermost Room of the Tower, which afforded so commanding a Prospect, we discovered the Cyprian Fleet had weighed Anchor, and was, with their utmost Industry, striving to get the Wind of Nicomedes , which he rendred an Impossibility to do, for he had no sooner doubled the point of Acritas , but he kept the Northern- shore of the Bay so close on his left hand, that he doubted not, by that Advantage, to get as certain a Victory, as he thought to have obteined, by a surprise; which failing off, and seeing his Enemies in so good and ready a form, relying on the benefit he had of the Wind, on his Courage, and on his former Success, he resolutely advanced, to become as absolute Master of one Element, as Mithridates had made himself of the other: The Cyprian Fleet inraged by the loss of their Companions, animated by the presence of their King, and by the glorious Assembly on the shore, loudly published, such unusual Incitements were of more advantage to them, than the Wind was now, or that recent Victory had been, to their Enemies. In a moment, we saw that noble Order, which both Fleets had so well observed, turned into confusion, and Cyprian and Nicomedian Flaggs, and Streamers, so promiscuously mingled, that the Discomposure was then as Great, as a little before the Regularity had been; sometimes Galleys of equal strength had also an equal Fate, and by opening each other with their Brasen Beaks, sank both to the bottom together, with those fatal Engins which sent them thither: Sometimes we saw Men so eager after their Dawning success, that they minded not how by an unexpected Leak, they became a prey to an Enemy more merciless than themselves; and needed that help from others, which even then, they had denied to others; sometimes the Heavens were darkned with a Cloud of Arrows, and then again nothing but seeming Lightnings imploy'd our Sight, occasion'd by the Sun's reflections on the Helmets and Swords of the contending Souldiers: But though these Prospects, affroded us variety of Objects to entertain us, yet one above the rest, did it so intirely, that nothing else could divert us from it; and this was, the two Galleys which carried the Admiral's Flaggs met, and grappled, and so long fought for the Victory, that we thought there would have been hardly any left in either to have solemnised it: But in the conclusion, we saw one run up the main Mast of the Cyprian Admiral, and having taken down from thence the mark of her being so, forthwith the rest of the Fleet began to retire, and in a short while so visibly and hastily fled, towards those Forces which were their Friends and Spectators on the shore, that we could no longer doubt of Ascanius and Pharnaces's Defeat; but in it, I was so equally divided between the Inspirations of Interest, and those of Honour, that the one not intirely overcoming the other, I remained neither sensible of Joy or Grief: But Ataphernes , who, by his Condition, was left to a more free way of resolving, than my unfortunate one left me; Cried out, Callimachus , I know not what disorder this Loss may bring amongst our Souldiers; Nor what intelligence Nicomedes may have in this City, (over which, but by the Fate of War, he is lawful King) therefore, if your strength will permit you, see to the safety of it, if Mithridates has not given particular Orders therein already; and I will hasten down to the Strand to save what we can of our Vanquish'd friends, and to oppose any Descent the Enemy may make in this confusion of our Affairs. Though I had not Health enough to see Ascanius possess Statira , yet I had enough to defend her against Nicomedes ; and with Joy accepting that employment, Ataphernes forthwith commanded a couple of Chariots to be brought us, for we were not in a condition, without much pain, either on Foot, or on Horse-back, to act those Duties, we held necessary, and had therefore undertaken: The Prince's Chariot being first come, and he having the longer way to go, instantly made use of it; and mine soon after coming, I forthwith went in it, from the Palace, towards the great place of Arms in the Center of the City; but by the way, I was met by the then chief Magistrate of Nicomedia , and Mithridates's natural Subject, who told me, he had even then presented his apprehensions to the Prince of some Conspiracy by the Nicomedians , who were more active, and stirring, than he had observed them ever to have been in Alarms; and that Ataphernes had commanded him to impart this Intelligence to me: I thanked him for his care, desired a continuance of it, and that he would forthwith draw all the Citizens into Arms, of whose Fidelity he was groundedly confident, and have a vigilant Eye over the rest. I forthwith dispatch'd some of my Servants to Ataphernes's Camp, with repeated Orders, to have their Men in a readiness, with parties of Horse, constantly moving between Nicomedia and the Army, that if any thing were stirring, they might with the needed Celerity repair to the City, and defence of Mithridates , securing the Gate that was next the Camp; to be thereby certain of admittance, if there were need: When these Orders were given, finding the King had left none particularly to answer a Revolt within the Walls, I did the more hastily put the Pontick Militia of Nicomedia in Arms, and no sooner were they in a posture to Fight, but the occasion was offer'd; for most of the antient Inhabitants of the place, hearing of their King's success, took up Arms to increase it, and thinking to surprise us, began the Ingagement with that Fury, which usually possesses such as promise themselves Success, or, wanting it, are certain of Death; I was not over- forward to oppose them, not knowing the Courages of those I headed, and being (with much difficulty) able to make use of a Horse which then was brought me: But principally, because I knew the Conspirator's party was at the heighth, and mine would be increasing; for some time, I was therefore contented not to lose Ground, as my Enemies were, that I won none. When a hasty Intelligence was brought me, that a rich Nicomedian had invited the Princess Statira to a Gallery in his House, which stood much more commodiously to see the Fleets, than any part of the Temple; and that she was no sooner there, but her Gentlemen were assaulted, who yet defended themselves with some resolution, but (if not instantly relieved) their Courages would yield to their Enemies number: This fatal advice made me cast off all those cold prudential considerations, under which I had thitherto Acted, and telling the danger the Princess was in, to those Forces I headed, they seem'd, by an universal Acclamation, to evidence their sense of it, and to promise with the hazard of their Lives to free her from it; I was loath to lose the first heat of this Duty, and, having by a successful charge broke through those which had stopt up my way to my relieving the Princess, I flew from those as fast as they had done from me, minding now no Enemies but those which were such upon the most unpardonable score; as soon as I had discovered them under their Ensigns, before the Gate of that treacherous Nicomedian's House, I saluted them with a furious Cry, and finding by the Order they were in, they had finish'd their attempt, I had not so much patience as to look behind me, to see whether I was well followed, which I too late found I was not; for many of my Party thinking it safer and more beneficial to persue a routed Enemy, than to Conquer one that seemed to Brave them, followed the Execution of those, and left me with a few to conquer these. It was a miracle I was not worsted, my own weakness, and the weakness of my Party concurring, seemed to condemn me to a Defeat, against the belief whereof, nothing did fortifie me, but the remembrance for whom, and (possibly) in whose presence, I fought: These two Reflections gave me that strength, which my late Wounds seemed to have denied me, evidencing thereby, that Love has a higher power than Nature; the weakness of this, being repaired by the strength of that. But whilst I was thus forcing a passage through a thousand Swords, I received from a young Nicomedian , so large and deep a Wound, through my left Arm, into my left Side, that almost despairing of Victory, I even bless'd that Hand which had given me so great an assurance of not out-living the loss of it; yet still I fought, esteeming that as great a Duty whilst I did live, as it was to live no longer, when I could not by my Sword act the Deliverance of the fair Statira ; but I was snatch'd from these Melancholy thoughts, by the welcome Cry of Demetrius , who aloud told me, Sir, your relief is at hand; he told me what was true: For, immediately I heard the Trumpets of some of Ataphernes's Troops, who, having by my Orders secured that Gate of Nicomedia , next their Camp; just as the Revolters were Marching hastily to possess it, had, by it, a free admittance into the City; whose Revolt having been assured of, and of my danger, they came hastily to punish the one, and relieve the other. Demetrius's assurance was heard by the Enemy, as well as by me, and was so throughly believed by them, that what brought me Advertisement of a relief, did also Act it; for, fearing least all the Prince's victorious Army was falling on them, most fled away towards the Harbour, and there in Boats sought to save themselves under his Protection, for whose Service only they needed it; others fled in at the Gate of the House in which Statira was, and having forthwith Barricadoed it, began from the Court-wall to play upon my relief, with their Darts and Arrows. I forthwith commanded all those Troops which came to my succour, to leave their Horses, and some to attempt the breaking open of the Gate, others to get Ladders in the adjacent Houses to scale the Walls, and in the opposite Buildings I placed some Foot (who by this time were come up) to beat the Enemy from their Defences; it seemed those that took this House for their Sanctuary, were of the resolutest; for though my Souldiers omitted not their Duties, yet they proved fruitless: My old Wounds, and my new, rendred me unable to lead my Men up those Ladders, from whence so many had been tumbled down, that even the most heated amongst them, were somewhat cooled. The much Blood I had lost, made my strength decay so visibly, that several of the Officers came to conjure me, to retire to some place out of danger of the Enemies shot, to dress my Wounds, lest my longer neglect might render those mortal, which possibly of themselves were not such: But I was Deaf to all such persuasions, and leaning upon my Sword, I did by my words sollicit their Courages, to whom I was not able to bring any Accession by my example, or Assistance: Never was any disability so sensible as mine was then to me, to stand useless, in my Princess's service; and when to act it, no other impediment remain'd, but forcing of an ordinary Wall, wounded me more than all the Arms of the false Nicomedians had done: But I was soon struck with a deeper stroak than any yet I had received, 'twas with a redoubled Cry of some of the Princess's Women, that they were forcing her away into a Barge, to carry her to Nicomedes's Fleet. This Advertisement, generous Princes, this Advertisement acted a miracle on me, I lost not only the remembrance of all my Wounds, but even of the pain and weakness they had given me; and running to the next scaling Ladder, I climb'd it up, killed two of those which resisted my gaining the Top of it, and having won the Battlements of the Wall, I was soon so well followed by the rest of my Friends, that the Enemy by a precipitated Flight, left us no other trouble, but to follow them, which, whilst the Souldiers were doing, I flew to the place where the Princess's Women continued their Crys, by which I was guided to a small Key, where the Barge they had mentioned was; there I saw a Crowd of Souldiers forcing into it the fair Statira , and those Women which had attended her, for all the Men had been lost in her defence: This sight gave my decaying Strength a new inspiration, in the Dictates whereof, by a furious Cry, I warned the Ravishers of their inevitable Death, if they proceeded in their Crime: But this was so far from hindering what I feared, that it did but hasten it; for knowing they had done too much to be pardoned by Mithridates , and too little to be receiv'd by Nicomedes , unless they presented him with some benefit to his Service, as well as endeavour in it: Leaving all the Women on the shore, two of the Nicomedians by plain force ran with Statira into it, and the chief of them commanded all the Rowers immediately to Launch from the shore. This fatal Order was no sooner given, than obey'd; so that not coming timely enough to hinder the execution of it, recollecting all my remaining forces, I leap'd into the Barge, and passing my Sword through him who commanded in it, and who had laid his impious hands upon the Princess, I fell Dead at her feet; seeming in that place to have received the reward of my endeavours; and in that condition, the punishment of their unsuccessfulness. The Death of the Nicomedian Commander raised a fury in all his Souldiers, which my fall, and the Barges being got off from the Key, gave them but too much opportunity safely to discharge; and therefore running to my Body with their Swords drawn, from the head of the Barge towards the Stern where I lay, and at which end I had got in, (that part being brought near the Shore, for the Princess's more convenient going into it) they had doubtless by many new Wounds acted that, which seemingly had been acted to their hands, had not she (forgetting her own misfortune, and contemning all their Arms, interposed her self between me and them, and, by the majesty of a Look, only peculiar to her self, and able to infuse a deep veneration in the most salvage hearts) put thereby a full stop to their fury, even in the highest Dictates of it. She was her self as much amazed, to find this unexpected reverence, as those were, in whom she had rais'd it: And therefore, not to lose the desired effects of it, she told them; Barbarians , Will you, to the horrid Sin of forcing away your King's Daughter, add that Inhumanity, of imbruing your hands in the blood of a Dead man? The truth of that reproach, and the belief they gave to that assurance, made them by degrees retire to the head of the Barge again, which they had no sooner done, but the Princess, and Nerea , (the only person of all her Attendants, which had the honour to participate in her misfortunes; for, (as she told us afterwards) finding they were resolv'd to force away the fair Statira , she had flung her self into the Barge at first, not to be separated from her) these two, I say, by an excess of goodness, and the Princess of condescension, tearing off the Linnen they wore, did with it indeavour to stop the many springs of Blood which ran out of my Body; and by a Deluge of weeping, Statira her self celebrated her apprehensions of my having lost my Life; a Life too nobly lost, since 'twas in her Service, and too nobly lamented, since 'twas so, even by her Tears. But her Charity and Grief were soon forced to resign their rooms to her fears; for the Nicomedian I had run through, when I leap'd into the Barge, had a Brother with him, who more minding to save his wounded Brother than to revenge him, whilst others were running to this, he imployed himself in that; but in vain: For the Souldiers, which the awe of the Princess had made retire, were no sooner gone back to their dying Captain, but he expired in his Brother's Arms; who now seeing 'twas no more time to serve him, ran to revenge him, and finding my Sword (which by accident lay near him) covered with his Brother's blood, he cried out to his Souldiers, Companions, follow me, and you shall see this Sword that has acted yours, and my loss, revenge it. This was no sooner said, than with a furious look, he ran towards the place where I lay. The words he spake, were so loud, that they reached the Princess's ears; who, fearing lest those who had been so soon converted, might as soon be guilty of a relapse, had not so intirely minded me, as not at all to mind them. And therefore, when my intended Murtherer was come near me, with Looks as bloody as his intention, the Princess, by an excess of generosity, interposed her self a second time between me and my Death, commanding Nerea to give me that care, which the cruelty of these men, forced her from contributing unto; and with a Look, able to have struck a veneration and awe into any but him, on whom 'twas mispent, she told him; Monster, Art thou alone of all thy Companions capable to act a violence to me, and a barbarity to a dead Gentleman? That Crime which they were ashamed to have designed, art not thou ashamed to perform? Madam, (he replied, interrupting the Princess) 'Tis I only of all my Companions, who have lost a Brother, and yet a Person dearer to me upon the account of Friendship, than of Blood; who even now Dying in my Arms, recommended in his last Breath his revenge to my Sword, which, by all that is sacred, nothing shall hinder me from. Cruel man, (she answer'd) what revenge wouldst thou desire that is not acted already for thee? His Condition renders him uncapable to suffer more, or thee to do more: Malice it self ceases in Death; and thou wilt not (I hope) be worse than the worst of Ills. If he were Dead. (the Nicomedian hastily answer'd) you would not both have taken such care in dressing his Wounds; neither whilst you fruitlesly endeavour to keep me from increasing their number, would you imploy your Woman to dress those he already has: No, Madam, be he what you say he is, and what I think he is not, this innocent Blood, which covers this Sword, must be wash'd away with his guilty Blood, who has thus stained it. Barbarian, (the fair Statira replied) Canst thou draw from the duty of a performance I owe a Gentleman which Died in my defence, an Argument to provoke thy rage, and increase thy guilt? Because our charity is mistaken in doing good, lest thy malice from thence should be mistaken in not doing ill, thou wilt run to a Sin which past Ages have not parallel'd, neither future ones will? What greater evidence canst thou have, that Callimachus is Dead, than that thou hast his Sword? That Prince also to whom thou art now carrying us, is too generous to receive under his protection, a Person so loaded with crimes; and the wickedness thou art now intent to commit, will out-weigh the Service thou dost him in making me his Prisoner, and force him, lest he share in thy guilt, to deny thee the reward of it; I never use (the Nicomedian furiously replied) to sell my Services, and those I have now paid, being done for my King, are both my Duty and my Reward; and having lost my Brother, do I thirst after any other recompence, than the satisfaction of revenging him? which lest your tears, and prayers, might hinder my Prince from denying me the right to do, when I come unto him; I will perform it before: I conjure you therefore, Madam, as you value your own safety, do not any longer put your self in a posture of hazarding it, lest any of those blows, my just resentments aim at him, should fall where I mean them not, and make me as actually guilty, as you would persuade me I am already intentionally. Thou wouldst (said Statira ) not only commit a Sin, but, to do it, wouldst persuade me to act another; since thus to revenge thy Brother's Death, cannot be worse in thee, than the permitting of it would be in me: Thy Brother's Blood is shed in a treacherous action, for so I must call what thou now doest, though it be for thy natural Prince, whom thou shouldst have followed in his misery, or, not having the courage or honesty to do that, thou shouldst not have had the wickedness to do this. Thou didst live under my Father's protection as a Subject, and now forcest away his Daughter as a Traitor into the hands of his Enemies: Canst thou, I say, who, in all the actions of thy Life, hast not done what thou shouldst do, and done that which thou shouldst not do, think it a duty to revenge a Brother, who Dy'd in the Crimes thou art guilty of? And shall not I esteem it a higher Duty, to preserve from more than Inhumanity, the Body of a generous Person, who now lies weltring in a deluge of Blood, only for my defence; or, if by a miracle, he should above my belief, have any remnant of Life remaining, shall I not expose mine to defend his, which had not needed my defence, had he not been reduced to what it is, by defending me from thee, and that Brother, whose just loss excites thy rage? Do not think to fright me from a duty I would not fear to pay, with the certain loss of that, which thou doest thus threaten me with: Canst thou think thy resentments are fit to be acted? And canst thou have the vanity to think thou canst terrifie me out of mine? Shall the imaginary Debts of wickedness be more punctually paid by thee, than the real ones of virtue by me? Ah! 'Tis thy Ignorance of good, which makes thee so bad, or makes thee hope to make me the like! No, no, if thou wilt go to thy cruelty, thou shalt go to it through me; I should be more troubled, to decline thy fury, than to endure the fiercest effects of it: Therefore, lose no time, for all thy sollicitations to me, are as vain as mine have been to thee, or rather for thee. I will lose no more time then, since you command me it, (repli'd the angry Nicomedian ) I have lost too much already, and the Ghost of my Brother seems to reproach me for that remisness, which my respect to you has made me guilty off to him; Permit me therefore (he continued advancing nearer the Princess) to lead you from a sight which might but heighten your displeasure. Touch me not, (said the fair Statira ) thy seeming care of me, is a real cruelty to me: Those impious hands, which are to be imbrued in Callimachus's blood, must not give me any assistance; or, if thou hast a respect for me, shew it in obeying my commands, or, in granting my desires, of desisting from a Crime, the Gods will punish, if Men would not. Remember the condition thou art now in, flying from Mithridates's justice, which may make thee rationally fear thou may'st one day feel the highest effects of it: Desist from this wickedness, and I will engage to procure thee my Father's pardon; not only a forgiveness for thy self, but for all thy Companions; and the remittal of all your Forfeitures. Consider, what it is, to be eternally banish'd from your native Country, from your Friends, and from all that is dear unto you, and to become Vagabonds, eternally confin'd to an Element, as merciless as thy self; for Nicomedes has no place but his Navy, on which to set his Foot: I do not conjure thee, not to bring me to thy King. Keep me as Hostage there, till what I have promised be performed; I ask not for my self, I ask for him, who, in serving me, is rendred for ever unable to serve himself: Thou needest but not to be wicked, to be happy; abstaining from one intended Crime, shall procure thy pardon for every one thou hast acted: No man except thy self, but would lose all he has, rather than perform that Sin, which, to buy thee from, I offer thee all that thou hast lost: But, if all my commands, my desires, and my offers move thee not, as I fear they will not, (for he that is Deaf to virtue, probably will be so to all things else) carry thy Rage to the highest; add to the Barbarity of giving new Wounds to a generous Person that is Dead, and to the forcing away thy King's Daughter; that of shedding her Blood also; for thy Sword can no way be so sensible to me, as to see it imployed against him. Can you, Madam, possibly believe, (replied the Nicomedian ) after having unmovedly heard all your commands, and with disdain (pardon me if I must say so) all your offers, that only an Inhuman desire to shed Blood, and not a virtuous Revenge, inspires my now resolution. And since I am acted by such a principle, in the name of all the Gods, Madam, do no longer fruitlesly endeavour to hinder its effects; were Callimachus as much Alive, as you would persuade me he is Dead, and from my own being Alive, would thence have assured me he is Dead; were he, I say, in the condition you wish him, possibly his Courage would not have so long protected him, as my respect to you has done: He, that at the Head of a victorious Army, could not force a weak House, till my Companions fear did more for him, than his own Valour; is not an Enemy so much to be fear'd, as you would have me fear him; nor a Friend so much to be esteemed, as I perceive he has the honour to be esteemed by you. Whilst the Princess (continued Callimachus ) was by more than a Human goodness employing her words for one so highly unworthy of them, Nerea had not only stopt the bleeding of that great Wound I had in my Side, but also by casting water upon my Face, and by several other things practised to one in a Swoon, brought me out of that, which too much Motion, and too little Blood, had cast me into; and I was no sooner come to my self, than confusedly remembring the danger the fair Statira had been in, and not being able to imagine what the result of it had been, (fetching a deep groan) Oh Gods! said I, What is become of the Princess? Those few words I spoke just as the Nicomedian had ended what I last related, and were no sooner heard by him, than (crying out aloud) Madam, Does your Dead man speak? He at the same time struck a furious blow at me, and said, Take that as a present sent thee from the Manes of my Brother. The violence of the Stroke was broken by the interposition of the Princess; who, finding now my Enemy had lost all respect to her, and was carried away by a Deaf fury to my immediate destruction, began now to conclude, I should immediately be what she but fear'd I had been. Nerea , the better to afford me her help, had set me up against the Stern of the Barge, (the place in which my strength had so fatally left me) which was so narrow, that whilst the Princess stood before me, none could come on either side to me, so that all the blows made at me were over her Shoulder; therefore, more offensive to me, being hindred at that price, than had they all taken an unobstructed effect. The Nicomedian's words, and actions, made me soon imagine what was doing, and therefore looking about for my Sword, more to punish his insolence to Statira , than to defend, or revenge my self; I endeavour'd to get up, but my Treacherous weakness cast me down again, and left me to the rage of an insulting Enemy; to which I had then been sacrificed, had not the fair Statira , by a prodigious Cruelty to her self, finding all other ways unsuccessful, cast her self upon me, and by covering me with her Body, rendred it an impossibility for the Nicomedian (but by her Death) to act mine. Nerea also seizing with all her strength upon his Leggs, did so intangle him, that he was not able to move one step, to force Statira from the posture she was in; this made him call to some of his Souldiers to tear that impediment from him, and that safety from me; who, by striving to get up, had open'd my Wound again, and had thereby repeated my former fainting; and therefore was not sensible, either of my danger, or of the felicity, by which yet I was preserved from it: The way of it, being infinitely fuller of satisfaction, than the end. The Nicomedian's Souldiers ran to obey their Captain's command, and, having with much difficulty, forced Nerea from his Knees, and with infinitely more rudeness forced the Princess from off me; lifting his Eyes up to Heaven, and his Sword into the Air, he cried out, Brother, dear Brother, accept of this Sacrifice, the least that I owe thee, and the greatest I can pay thee. Statira by a loud shriek endeavour'd to stop his lifted up Arm, from falling on me, or by it, endeavoured to honour and lament my Death. When on a sudden, instead of seeing the Nicomedian's Sword fall upon my head, she saw it fall out of his hand, and him soon after Dead at her feet. Possibly, generous Princes, (continued Callimachus ) never any Man was so near Death, and so strangely escaped it; I have not, to make the deliverance seem the greater, made the danger seem such, for even in that very instant, which was between the lifting up the Sword to Kill me, and the letting it fall for that effect, an Arrow shot him through the heart. Statira has often told me, she thought it came from Heaven, as a Return to her prayers and tears: But lest the truth might look like a Fiction, permit me to tell you, what will free it from that unhappiness. The Barge we then were in, was that Magnificent one, which Mithridates himself commonly made use of, when for his Divertisement, he would take the Air in the Bay; and because it was imbellished with much Guilt, and admirable Painting, it was kept in a House built on purpose for it upon Pillars, some little distance from the shore, lest the curiosity of the common people might injure it in either; and therefore, those to whose care it was committed, had a small Skiff, capable only to hold the Rowers of the Barge, which were twenty, in which as they had occasion they went to it, and returned from it. This Skiff, when the Barge was thrust from the shore by the Nicomedians at my Arrival, had only six Rowers, ready to receive such, as in their intended flight to Nicomedes's Fleet, could not have room enough in the Barge; the Water-men, left in the Skiff, seeing the Barge hasten away, from whence only they could expect their relief, were so amazed, and terrified thereat, that before they could resolve of any thing, they were discovered by Demetrius , and by his orders secured: He having seen my danger, in having cast my self single, amongst above twenty Armed men, besides as many Rowers, and ready at the time I did so, to sink under my Wounds, calling to him some of the nearest Officers, ran with them to the Skiff, and just as he was going to leap into it, he fell down by the side of it; for, in the Fight he had received some Wounds, which his zeal in my Service had not made him consider. The decay of his strength was so great, that it hardly gave him power to say hastily to Rebadates ; I recommend, valiant Rebadates, Statira and Callimachus's relief unto you, which it seems the Gods have esteemed me unworthy to contribute unto; Fly then, and lose no time, lest you lose them. Some Souldiers forthwith took up Demetrius , and carried him to the next help; in the mean time, Rebadates and ten more of his Companions leap'd into the Skiff, and having not only promised the fearful Rowers their pardon, but exceeding great rewards, if they carried him time enough to relieve their Princess, and me; those timorous Men tugg'd at their Oars so vigorously, that Rebadates soon perceiv'd he went faster than those he persued, and therein he was not mistaken; for those in the Barge, both Rowers, and Souldiers, being out of all danger from the shore, had been at first so intirely taken up, with their common design of revenging their dead Captain; and after they had been diverted from that, by the Princess, were so intent, in observing what past between her and his Brother, that thereby they made such slow way, as a small Boat, with fewer Rowers, might easily overtake them. Rebadates perceiving a-far off, the Barge full of Men, (for all in it standing up, made it appear so to him) he did esteem it advisable, by a slight, to supply the smallness of his number: He therefore order'd the Rowers to continue their diligence, and on their Lives, by no word, or signal, to give any notice to their late Companions, who were in the Barge; but rather, if any question'd them, before they came near, they should answer, they thought themselves happy, they had only brought away themselves: He then appointed all his Friends to keep themselves undiscovered, by lying flat in the bottom of the Skiff, with their Arms ready, that as soon as ever they came to the stern of the Barge, they might, with all their Arrows, salute the Enemy, and second that salutation, by leaping in with their drawn Swords. These directions were not more exactly observed, than the whole design happily succeeded; for, of all that were in the Barge, some were wholly taken up in the imployment I already mentioned; and others, who looking towards the Skiff, saw none in it, but the known Rowers belonging to it, troubl'd not themselves in asking any questions, they might at leisure be resolved of. This gave our relief, the opportunity they wished: And Rebadates lying himself at the head of the Skiff, when he came near the stern of the Barge, seeing a bloody Sword high in the Air, was at once confounded and pleas'd at it; this in a belief it gave him, I still was alive, since I alone was in the Barge to oppose them; and that, from an apprehension, 'twas so colour'd at my cost: Therefore, starting up with all his Companions, just in that moment the Nicomedian was going to Kill me, by a happy Arrow he killed him; and springing into the Barge, with his Friends, he made such an execution amongst his Enemies, that those of them, who had escaped the first furies of it, fled from the stern to the head of the Barge, and there, but by defending themselves, gave their Assaulters an incouragement which they needed not. Whilst Rebadates was thus imploying his Valour, for my safety, one of his Companions was imploying his Art, for the like end: 'Twas an Officer, who had received so often, and so many Wounds, that by a dear experience he had no small Skill in the Cure of any, which were Curable; and, because the duty of his Profession often called him unto danger, and his Courage oftner, he never went without things necessary about him, for his own, or his Friend's use: And seeing me lye in that sad posture I was in, and that the fair Statira and Nerea's help (which they were honouring me with again) was too small for a danger, which seem'd so great; observing also, that his Companions had not so much need of his assistance as I: He came to afford me his, in so seasonable a time, that he told the Princess, though he could not warrant the event, yet he did assure her, had his Service been never so little delay'd, it could not but have proved fatal to me: But whilst this obliging Person was preserving me, his Friends were destroying my Enemies, in which they prov'd so successful, that by that time I opened my Eyes, I could see none of them in a posture of resistance; though the last of them, which had been so, in a despair, had expos'd himself to ten Swords, that he might pass his own through Rebadates , which he did, but paid for that Wound, by the loss of his Life; yet Rebadates by that he had received, fell, and needed the assistance of that Friend, as soon as I had received from him, all which then he could afford me. Several others of those Gentlemen, by whose courage the Princess had receiv'd that deliverance, I was thought unworthy by the Gods to present her, were so dangerously hurt, besides two which were Kill'd; that had the Water-men in the Barge, had half as much courage as they had fear, they might have done that with their Oars, which their Masters fail'd of doing with their Swords: But these men, conscious of their own guilt, and well seeing which way the dispute was like to be decided, and having no promise, or hope of pardon, whilst Rebadates and his Friends were Fighting, and the Princess Nerea , and Tomsones (for so was that Gentleman called who had dress'd my Wounds) were intently bestowing their care on me; the Water-men of the Barge, had got into the Skiff, and fled towards some Boats they saw afar off; the Rowers also of the Skiff fled with them, suspecting their past Crimes would have a more punctual payment, than their late Services a reward, especially those being voluntary, these constrained; so that by the time we were deliver'd from our Enemies, we found our selves unable to return to our Friends; at least did it so slowly, that before we had time sufficiently to admire the miracle of our deliverance, we saw we needed another, to secure it: For all the Rowers being fled, and not above two with Tomsones being free from Wounds, and thereby, as well as by their unacquaintedness in using of an Oar, unable to Row, we moved so slowly towards the shore, that our Water-men had time enough to overtake those Boats and Persons they fled unto; who they found were Nicomedians , flying from their City, to their King: These being fully inform'd how great a prize was in the Barge, and how little resistance would be made in the defence of it, and knowing well all the Boats and Barges in Nicomedia , were carried from the shore by their defeated Companions; they made towards our Barge, hoping by presenting Nicomedes with so great a gift, they might deface the blemish of their first unsuccessfulness. Their Barges being so well fitted, and ours so ill, they had no great difficulty to overtake us; and though Tomsones was a person of great Valour, yet having but three sound Men in the Barge, and seeing about two hundred in three others, and many more coming, thought it better to use his Tongue, than his Sword; and therefore began, as soon as they were within Call, to capitulate with them; Telling them, though possibly their numbers might at length oppress him, and his Companions, yet he assur'd them, ere they did so, he would lessen them considerably; and therefore, he offer'd them, if they were Inhabitants of Nicomedia , their pardons, and full Indempnity, would they carry the Princess, and me, back to Mithridates ; if they were Souldiers of the Fleet of Nicomedes , and that they could esteem a Lady, and a dying Gentleman fit Presents for them to make, and him to receive, he would, upon their faithful engagements of carrying us with all honour and civility directly to their Prince, without any opposition yield himself upon the faith of that Ingagement. Whilst he was thus talking with the several Companies which had surrounded him, one of the Nicomedians , which commanded in one of the Barges, came gently behind Tomsones's Barge, and then furiously leaped into it, as soon as he had joyned it; but Tomsones soon made him find, that Treachery should be more fatal to him that had designed it, than to him who was to have suffer'd by it; for at first Thrust, he pass'd his Sword through him up to the Hilt, and having thereby laid him Dead at his feet; by a second Thrust, having happily done the like to another; and his few Companions, by a brisk seconding him, and mingling themselves amongst those which had Boarded them, made them immediately with more celerity abandon our Barge, than they had entred into it; and the rest seeing how ill this intended surprize had succeeded, were so far from revenging, that they openly condemned it, and began to listen to what had been offer'd; esteeming it now a more hopeful thing to take us by Capitulation, than by Force: Nay, some of the Soberest amongst them, sensible of the Ills they were to suffer, by a wandring Sea-life, and probably an eternal Banishment from their Country, and Estates, and therefore much moved with the assurance of the contrary, of which they seem'd no way to doubt, by reason of that great Influence the Princess had over her Father, (who, the more hopefully to conquer their doubts, had her self confirm'd that offer made them by Tomsones ) began to incline to the first proposal, rather than the last, and had actually accepted of it, had not amongst that number, (as almost amongst all others) the Indiscreeter, and the Worst, been the most; who, being also of a condition, which rendred War their hopefullest Trade, and who expected more from Nicomedes by such a Present, than to recover of their own, by returning; and believing this manifested condescension of some of their Companions, would, when known to Nicomedes , render the Numbers which were to share his Liberality, the less, and their Services which oppsed it, the greater, so loudly exclaimed against this, and so readily promis'd to observe the other, that the less Number at length yielded to the bigger; and We to both. Tomsones having first made them solemnly Vow, that none should enter our Barge, but Water-men to Row it, till we were arrived at the victorious Fleet. This he did, to secure himself, as much as his condition did admit, that no incivility should be offer'd the Princess, nor to me, by a multitude he apprehended, by what they had done, might not be too averse to it; as also, that thereby he kept himself in no worse a posture for defence than he was in before the Agreement, should they, by any Treachery, violate or break it. As soon as we had received our Rowers on Board, inviron'd with all the other Barges, we moved directly to the Nicomedian Fleet, which lay at Anchor about thirty Furlongs from us; all the time we were going thither, the Princess sat by me, waiting for some stronger marks of Life, than hitherto I had given; and conjuring Tomsones , by the most pressing words she could speak, to give me all his Care, and Skill; and, if after their separation, and Imprisonment, Rebadates , or any of those generous Officers, to whom, as to him, she owed that little Life I had, wanted any thing, which might contribute to their Recovery, that he would acquaint her with it; for the promised her self from Nicomedes's civility, all things of that Nature which she could ask Tomsones assur'd the Princess of a perfect observance of all her commands: But begg'd, if I should Dye of my Wounds, that she would not ascribe it to his neglect of them, for they were so deep, and dangerous, and I so weak, that at their first Dressing, he was not able to form any certain judgment of them; but had more reason to fear the worst, than to believe the best. These words, as he that spoke them, did afterwards assure me, drew some Tears from the fair Statira's Eyes, and cast her into a Melancholy, greater than she had discover'd for her own Captivity. We had not now ten Furlongs to the Fleet, when I began to open my Eyes again, and to recover so much Memory, as to call to mind how I was brought to that sad Condition; and that the danger Mithridatia had been in, was the cause of it. But not knowing any thing more, and the incertainty which that I knew left me in, forced me to fetch a deep Groan, and to say, Oh Gods! What is become of the Princess? She her self being near enough to hear this Question, had the goodness to answer it, by saying, I am here, Callimachus , and have not any greater trouble, than what your danger gives me: Ah! Madam, (I repli'd, turning my faint Sight towards that place from whence her Voice came) Mine is not worthy your thoughts, much less your trouble; but for the sake of the Gods, tell me, where you are, and what condition you are in. The Princess justly believing, the truth thereof would but heighten my danger, told me, As to my condition, I have acquainted you with it already; and as to the place, we are on the Water, and in that Barge, where the Gods have so signally favour'd your safety, that I cannot think, they will soon permit the loss of a Life, which by a miracle they even now have saved. Alas! Madam, (I repli'd) I find you are not pleas'd to return direct answers to my humble desires; and therefore, by your so telling me, you are not a Prisoner, you do but too much acquaint me you are one. Oh Gods! (I continued) What has the unhappy Callimachus done, that you have thought fit to call him out for the Princess's deliverance, and then deni'd him the honour of it, and yet permitted him to out-live it? Ah! Take again the Life you have lent me, it can now only serve to Torment me: No honours, nor glories to come, can ballance this Infamy; to live to see the fair Statira a Captive, and made such by my unhappy defence of her, is a Load too great for Life to support. The deep Wounds these considerations gave me, not long after made me relapse into a more dangerous Swoonding than any I had had before; and though Statira , in Expressions far above me, and Condescensions far below her, endeavour'd (whilst I was capable to hear and observe them) to remove the cause of my despair; yet I thought it built upon too much Reason, to permit it to be Vanquish'd, nay, that admirable goodness which she shewed me, was so far from acting her desires, that it made me but the more resolutely approve of mine own, which was to Dye. My condition having left me nothing more Eligible; since, if I recover'd, 'twould be but to see that fair Princess in the Bonds of Imprisonment, whilst she continued with Nicomedes , and in those of Marriage, as soon as she was freed from the others, either of which was a misery that render'd Death a less, than to behold one of them. Whilst I yet lay in a seeming Death, we were come so near the victorious Fleet, that one of the Barges, which had conducted us, advanced faster than the rest, to acquaint the King, how they had fail'd of their first design, and what good marks they brought him, that they had attempted it. This was the cause, that, by that time we were come to the side of the Admiral's Galley, Nicomedes was ready to descend into our Barge, which he did, and with many civilities and respects, strove to render Statira's loss of Liberty, as little uneasie as he could. After she had convinced him, she was not insensible of what he said, and did; She told him, there is, Sir, in this Barge, a Gentleman, who, though he has been your Enemy, yet I will believe you will not deny him your care. Madam, (said Nicomedes ) I have already been told, that Callimachus is here, and dangerously Wounded; and though he has been my Enemy in so high a degree, that by his Sword I have been kept out of my Kingdom, and this Day out of the chiefest City of it, yet your commands, and the duty I owe to Gallantry, though in an Enemy, shall make my care of him be as great, as if his Wounds had been received for, and not against me. Statira , as Tomsones afterwards assured me, gave Nicomedes more acknowledgments for what he had promis'd her for me, than for what he had paid her, for her self; which had made the Bythinian King tell her, I cannot, Madam, blame Callimachus for tying himself so absolutely to your Service, since, by the honour of your concernments for him, he has that Duty so advantagiously rewarded; and possibly, his present condition is not so much to be lamented upon any account, as that by it he is rendred uncapable to know these fresh Obligations you lay upon him; and to pay you his Acknowledgments for them. Callimachus (replied the fair Statira blushing) has too much hazarded himself for me, not to make my care of him a Debt due unto him; and since he has been Prodigal in obliging, I ought to be just in paying. But I believe, were he to speak only the truth, he would esteem his now Condition more deplorable by its rendring him uncapable to resent your generosity to him, and to pay you his retributions for it, than on any other score; and since by favouring me, his is reduced to that misfortune, be pleas'd to accept of my acknowledgments for him, till the Gods render him able to present you with his own for himself. Nicomedes , who found, by that little disorder Statira had been in, that what he had intended only in a Gallantry, was otherwise received, took a particular care, no more to err on that side: But having, in magnificent tearms, applauded the justness and greatness of the Princess's care of me, he presented her his hand, to lead her up into his Galley, and then told her; I know not, Madam, if you have any other commands to honour me with for any else in this Barge; but if you have, I beg to receive them ere we go out of it. Sir, (replied Statira ) here are some Gentlemen, who had not now been Prisoners, or Wounded, if their civility to me had not involved them in that misfortune: But I know, they are in the power of a Prince, that renders any Intercession of mine for their good usage a needless thing. Nicomedes , by bowing himself, acknowledged that advantagious opinion the Princess had contracted for him; who, to evince it was a true one, commanded some of his Officers to take as much care of Rebadates , and those others that were hurt, as they would of their best Friends; and to give all the rest any freedom they desired, but that of returning to Nicomedia ; and because he had understood Tomsones had dress'd me, and was very happy and skilful in curing of Wounds, he appointed him to be still near me, and to lye in a Pallet in the next Cabin to me: These Orders being given, the Princess, helped by Nicomedes , ascended into his Admiral, and as soon as she was come into the noblest Room of it, he acquainted her, that her Brother, and the Prince, who was to have a happier and nearer relation to her, were in the same Vessel with her, and because he easily believed they would have longing impatiencies to wait on her, he would retire the sooner to afford them that honour. Statira had scarce time enough to reflect upon the prodigious changes of that Day, but she was interrupted, first by the arrival of Pharnaces , who carried his Arm in a Scarf, having received a Wound which had necessitated him thereto; and he having condoled their common misfortune, and magnified the high Gallantry of the King of Cyprus , which, he solemnly protested, transcended his present misfortune; for while he had been generously disputing in the head of his Galley, there had enter'd a throng of Souldiers, which had Boarded her on her quarter, and had made him a Prisoner. Ascanius himself immediately after came in, but with Looks so dejected, that Nerea told me afterwards, she more pitied his so ill entertaining his misfortune, than his having fallen into it; and that Statira her self, through all her reservedness, seem'd to think much more of it, than she would speak. The Cyprian Prince having with all imaginable Humility, paid his respects to Mithridatia , folding his Arms th' one within the other, and breathing some Sighs, told her; I thought, Madam, to have been called one moment from the Temple, considering the glorious occasion that carried me thither, had been infelicity enough to punish all my sins, but those of daring to lift up my desires to the Princess Statira: But it seems the Gods have placed a higher punishment upon that noble and unavoidable offence; for they have not only defeated my Fleet, which had the great honour to Fight for you, but even before your Eyes; and have made my Enemies surprise me into the Infamy of out-living it: But alas, I sadly find, they have reserved for me other miseries, which make these hardly deserve that name; for these chiefly, if not wholly, relate to my self; and so much duty and veneration I owe your Butise, that these infelicities I could suffer as a just Punishment of my happy presumption, and as an easie purchace of that blessing, your extreme mercy and condescension had rais'd me unto: But when I find, that to all these Sorrows, I was reserved alive, but to see my Princess in captivity; and that that calamity is an undeniable effect of my unsuccessfulness in her Service; (For, had I been Victorious, Where could the treacherous Nicomedians have carried, and where could Nicomedes have deteined her?) That, Madam, wounds me above the Cure of Art, Reason, and Time, and makes me esteem my Enemies saving my Life, the highest torment could befall it. Sir, (replied the Princess) I am sensible of your misfortunes, and of the grief with which you bear them; but cannot upon any tearms ascribe them to that cause to which you do: Though sometimes we do not know what those Sins are, for which we are punished, yet we still know, and should always confess, the Gods are just even in their punishments; and oftentimes repining at what is done, we provoke them to do more. To do more, ( Ascanius hastily replied, interrupting her) Ah! Madam, What can the Gods do more than they have done? And what can they make me suffer more than now I do? When one endures a Torment, which Death compared unto is an ease; What can befall him worse, than by Life to be denied it? Oh Gods! (he continued) What has the wretched Ascanius done, that you have made him feel, in the compass of a few hours, changes, and miseries, above whatever any other did, in the whole course of his Life? What Triumphs, and Glories, was I destin'd unto, in the Morning? And what black, and deep Calamities, am I plunged into, in the Evening? Pardon me, Madam, I humbly beg you, that I do in your Sight give vent unto a Sorrow, which your Sight does animate, and heighten; and let your mercy so far indulge to my condition, as to excuse me, if in an extraordinary grief, I give Evincements of it, which are not common. Statira was going to reply, when she was interrupted by Nicomedes his coming in, to acquaint her, that he paid so much obedience to her Commands, that he was not contented only to order them to be observed, but he even then came from seeing them obey'd; that Rebadates's Wounds were not unpromising, but that mine were not yet altogether so hopeful, yet that by Cordials I was brought from my fainting: But that when he came from me, I had neither open'd my Eyes, nor spoken. Statira , for those new Obligations gave Nicomedes new Acknowledgments. But Pharnaces , and Ascanius , not having heard of my being in the Galley, or Wounded; and the first of them, expressing a desire to know, how that misfortune was befallen me; She gave them a relation of it, in such advantagious tearms for me, that in it, my Wounds, and Sufferings, were but too prodigally recompensed. At the end of the Princess's Narrative, one of Nicomedes his chiefest Officers, came to Advertise him, that the Gentleman he had sent to Mithridates , was return'd, with an Answer from him; which made him withdraw to receive it: And not long after, Pharnaces , and Ascanius , began to retire, to leave Statira to that Quiet, which both her Mind, and her Body, but too much needed. But before they had finished their parting Ceremonies, Nicomedes returned again, and told Ascanius ; Sir, You are at liberty, at least you are no longer my Prisoner; for as soon as you were made such, I sent to Mithridates , to offer you in exchange for the King of Cappadocia , which he has accepted of: Ariobarzanes will be immediately here; and I have ingaged my Faith to the Pontick King, to send you to him. Ascanius (as Nerea afterwards told me, from whom I had an account of those things, at which I was not present my self) seemed at this Advertisement to have a Look mingled with Joy, and Astonishment; but immediately after, recollecting himself, he told Nicomedes , I am too much obliged, both to the great Mithridates , and you; To you, Sir, for offering so advantagious an Exchange; and to him, for accepting it: But you have now Prisoner, a Princess, who ought, the first of all, to cast off that unhappy condition; and if you can esteem any, nay, all those in her Father's power, an equal Ransom for her, and accept of them, you will thereby act a greater Victory over us, than your Sword has this Day given you. Do not, generous Nicomedes , esteem me so unworthy of liberty, as to accept of it, while my Princess has lost hers; or to allow for my Exchange, of a part of that, which I hope will purchase hers. I confess, (repli'd the Bythinian King) I propounded you for Ariobarzanes , ere I knew of the Princess's misfortune; but had I known of it earlier, I should have made Mithridates no other proposal; for I know too well, to value the fair Statira , to think any Exchange in the Pontick King's power, can be proportionate for her: Nay, should I restore her to him, for a quiet re- possession of the Throne which he keeps me out of, I should yet give him much above what I received from him. Will you, (replied Ascanius ) accept of Ariobarzanes for me, and then me for the Princess; that will in effect present you with two Kings for part of her Ransom, and I shall eternally acknowledge I yet owe you more than I have paid you, or more than ever I can pay. This I propound, has a mixture of both those Virtues, in the manifestation of which, I know you are concerned; The serving of your great Friend, and your obliging the admirable Statira ; which you will abundantly evidence, by taking so little, for what deserves so much: And your Obligations to me, will not be inferiour; since, to lose my liberty, to restore the Princess to hers, will in some degree repair my having lost her liberty, by first having lost my own. That, which you have offer'd, (said Nicomedes ) will doubtless be better accepted of by the Princess, than it can be by me: She is, in her self, and in my opinion, above all Ransoms; and when I shall pay her the Duty I owe her, it shall be without mixture, lest that should be esteemed a Bargain, which has nothing of so low a Nature in it. This noble Dispute (continued Callimachus ) lasted so long, that ere it was concluded, News was brought Nicomedes , that the King of Cappadocia was so near the Fleet, that he could hardly have time enough to meet him, if he any longer deferr'd going about it: This made the Bythinian King tell the Cyprian , I wish, Sir, you were come to a resolution, for I have passed my ingagement to Mithridates , as soon as I receive Ariobarzanes , to return you to him. My resolution is already taken, (repli'd Ascanius ) and a captivity at the Feet of my Princess, is exceedingly preferable to a Liberty, which must force me from thence. Here Pharnaces interposing himself, desired Nicomedes to go and receive Ariobarzanes , whilst he, and his Sister, would endeavour to persuade the King of Cyprus . The Bythinian King, strangely perplex'd at the Cyprian's resolution, went in great trouble to receive his Friend; whom he was either to send back, having avowedly in his power a sufficient Exchange for him, or else must deliver up the Princess Mithridatia , for whose Exchange he had entertain'd such high hopes: On the other side, as soon as he was gone, the Princess Statira , and the Prince of Pontus , had no small trouble to vanquish the Cyprian King's resolution; neither could they ever conquer it, till Mithridatia her self, having told him, how fix'd she found Nicomedes against her Exchange; and that by his Liberty, she would entertain hopes in a few Moons, he would get together such a Fleet, as might give her that freedom by his Arms, which his great Overtures had failed of; and therefore, by all the power she had over him, she injoyned him not to decline an Offer, which also might be resented by Mithridates . In short, Ascanius obey'd Statira's Commands, and Pharnaces Desires, which, when told to Nicomedes , it gave him a satisfaction as great as his trouble lately had been; and therefore, he hasten'd away Ascanius , lest he should relapse, and lest his stay in the Fleet, after Ariobarzanes's arrival there, should make Mithridates believe his generosity, and trust, had not had a fitting Return. The King of Cyprus , before he went, kneeling at Statira's feet, made her many earnest and high protestations of his Passion, and solemn Vows of speedily freeing her from her restraint, or of losing his Life, in the Duty of that attempt; conjuring her, by all those things she honoured with her highest Esteem, never to forget, that the misery of his being free from all Captivity (but hers) when she was not, was a pure effect of his Obedience, which he hop'd she would believe could not but be paid her in all things else, since 'twas not declin'd in this. Mithridatia , with her usual reservedness, and civility, gave him a Return, and soon after Ascanius imbracing Pharnaces , with whom he had contracted a strict friendship, he took his leave, having first visited Ariobarzanes, Nicomedes , and design'd to do me also the like honour; but my condition render'd me uncapable of it, being not then come out of my fainting. Whilst Ascanius was returning to Mithridates, Tomsones's Care, and Art, had been so successful, that, by them, I was brought again to Life: Nicomedes , as soon as he heard it, came to visit me, but being informed, my weakness was such, that to be spoken unto, or to speak, might be highly prejudicial to me; he forthwith retir'd again, giving repeated Orders for my being us'd, as if I were his Son; Civility in him doing as much before he knew who I was, as Nature it self could have done, had he known it: But being assur'd, that my Recovery would be much hinder'd, if not indanger'd, by the motion of the Galley, and the straitness of Room in it; and having also observed Mithridatia , even while they were at Anchor in a good Road, felt a disturbance, which yet she would not complain of; gave Orders to weigh, and steer their course for the Island of Scyros , which was the only place, the Kings of Bythinia and Cappadocia had left; in which was a Castle, where they kept all their Magazines, for their Fleets, and where they usually deteined their most important Prisoners: And because this Island was so considerable to them, as that the Loss of it, would be the loss of all; they had fortified that Castle in it, so well, as it was esteemed impregnable, two sides of it standing on a precipice over the Sea, and the other two being cut off from the Land, by a deep Graft, forced through a main Rock, with three Fortifications, one within another, consisting of Walls, and Towers, of a prodigious heighth, and thickness, which clearly forbad all hopes of taking that place, but by Treachery, Surprise, or Famine. Nicomedes the rather hasten'd thither, because Ariobarzanes had yet one Wound, whose Recovery needed rest, and time. As soon as the whole Fleet was moving, which, by their late Fight, needed the Recruits of their Stores, the Bythinian King waited on Mithridatia , and told her, that to render her misfortune the less uneasie, and more hopefully to observe her Commands for me, he was going to Land her in a place, where my Wounds might be better looked after, and where she her self might resent less inconvenience than in that Element she now was on. Ariobarzanes also at that time waited on her, to acknowledge the noble Treatment he had received from her Father, whilst he had been his Prisoner, and to assure her of all the respects he was able to pay her. Statira was not unsensible of these civilities, and by her Expressions convinced them of it: But whilst she was in the midst of them, she was interrupted by the hasty coming in of Tomsones , who told her; Madam, I hope you will pardon this confidence, since, 'tis in Obedience to your Commands; for having done for Callimachus all that my Art has taught me, and having had Success, almost above my hopes, he was no sooner come to Strength enough to speak, but he asked a particular account of all that had passed since his first fainting; and though I endeavoured all I could, to dissuade him from a Relation, which I knew, would have some fatal Operation on him, yet his resolution was not to be conquer'd, and fearing, left by an obstinate silence, he might imagine what was too bad, to be yet worse, I gave him a particular relation of all, except of the Danger, you had exposed your self unto, in saving him; which was no sooner signified, than he cried out, with much more Strength than I thought he had been Master of; Great Gods! Did you then reserve the unfortunate Callimachus to the highest honour, that of defending the Princess Statira , only thereby to involve him in a proportionate misery, that of letting her by his fault, become a Captive! Yes, yes, (he continued) you may be severe to her, you may be cruel to me; but you shall not any longer make me such unto my self; you may Cloath me with Infamy, but you cannot force me to wear it; that ought only to be the Livery of guilt: But since you have made it the Livery of misfortune, thus I cast it off. At these words, he began to tear off what bound up his Wounds; and, finding that our holding him by force, was as dangerous to him, by his struggling, as if we had left him at liberty to act his despair; and that the horrour of having been unsuccessful in your Service, only created it; I ran, Madam, to inform you of it, that by your Presence, and your Commands, you may suppress it, for 'tis uncapable of any other Cure. These words were scarce out of Tomsones's mouth, when another of the Chyrurgeons came running to confirm their truth; and to add, that I had already, in spight of all their opposition, opened one of my Wounds, and that, if I did the like to the greatest, such a Flux of Blood would run from thence, that, with it, my Life would go away. Statira , transported with fear, and fill'd with an excess of goodness, having begg'd the pardons of the two Kings, for leaving them, went precipitately to my Cabin, which was not so far from hers, but that she could hear the Crys of those that tended me; and as soon as she came thither, she found me in that condition, she had been informed I was in; and therefore, holding one of my hands, she told me; Is it thus, Callimachus , that you evince your acknowledgments to the Gods, for their late preserving your Life! A Life, they shewed themselves so much concerned in, that rather than lose it, they chose to save it by a miracle! The sight of the Princess, with the words she spoke, and the action she did, put a period immediately to all those effects of my sorrow, and despair, and made me in Gestures, full of Humility, reply; Can you still, Madam, can you still, have any care for a Person, who, wanting success in the honour of your Service, could out-live that misery? Or, do you esteem, that Sin merits the punishment of surviving it, as the highest can be inflicted on it? You have committed no Sin, (said Mithridatia ) but in endeavouring to act that, which therefore has forced me to come and hinder it; not as a Punishment of what you could not do, but as a Duty for what you have done: I have seen your Virtue shine in all conditions, but Captivity; and in that, it chiefly evidences it self: the Gods therefore have chose sooner to deny your Courage its ordinary effects, than to deny your Merit so extraordinary a Rise to manifest its greatness. Ah! Madam, (I repli'd) interrupting her, Can you then so much add unto my Affliction, as to think it can proceed from my own being a Prisoner, when even you your self are one, and made one by my fault? He, Madam, that wanted not Fortitude to sustein the unhappiness of being Ignorant, what, or from whence he is; of having in an abject, or unknown extraction, Ambition fit for, if not transcending, the highest; and that could without Dying, see a misery to which Death is infinitely preferrable; He, I say, that could endure, and not sink under these Burthens, cannot be suspected to fall under any others, abstractedly relating to himself: No, Madam, they are your Sufferings, occasion'd by my Crime, that weigh me down unto Death; which I hope you will not deny me to embrace, since I have no way but that left me, to evince to the World, my misery is not my fault; for none can justly believe, he that elected Dying, because he did not serve you as he ought, did neglect to serve you as he ought, for fear of Dying. Since (replied the fair Statira ) 'tis my condition only, which inspires you with such Criminal resolutions, I shall not much doubt to suppress them; when I mind you, that to endeavour to remedy it, is more suitable to Callimachus , than to despair of it. Can you think my Imprisonment a deep Affliction? And can you deprive me of that Arm, and Sword, by which I chiefly hope, under the Gods, to be delivered from it? If you act any thing against your self, after this assurance, I shall believe a despair for your own condition, rather than a sense of mine, invited you to it. Alas! Madam, (I answer'd) What can be hoped for, from a Sword, and Arm, which could do nothing in your Service? It is now uncapable of any thing, but that only, to which therefore I would imploy it. Callimachus , said Mithridatia , You are too unjust to your self, and thereby would become the like unto me; because, when Wounded, and Single, you could not for me, destroy a multitude, you will therefore destroy your self; you would thereby do more against me, than Fortune has done, for she has but robb'd me of freedom, but you would rob me of the best, if not the only means of recovering it; She has flung me into the misery, but 'tis you will fling away the Cure of it. Tomsones here whisper'd the Princess in the Ear, that these Discourses, if long continued, would prove destructive to that end, for which they were made; She therefore putting on that Majestick Look, with which she not only used to injoyn Obedience, but by which she always obteined it, told me; Callimachus , Believe me, I have use of your Life, and therefore I conjure you, and if that be not enough, I enjoyn you, nay, I command you, to act nothing against it; but observe all that Tomsones shall prescribe you, for the preserving of it; and if you have any value for me, shew it by your Obedience in this. Ah! Madam, (I repli'd, with a deep Groan) since you command me, you must be obey'd; but, I believe, when you find me plung'd in these miseries, to which these Orders do reserve me, you will then as much Lament the having injoyn'd them, as I do, that you have done it now. If ever (said Statira ) I should be so unhappy, as to see what you say, I shall be so Ingenious, as to acknowledge it, and so Just, as to free you then from this Injunction: But (she continued) I have in my Care of your Life, I fear, too much indanger'd it; I will therefore leave you to that Rest, which your Health cannot more need, than I do wish it you. She retired, having said so: And Tomsones found me, ever after, perfectly obedient to the Princess Commands, in an exact observance of all his prescriptions. The Wind favouring us, it was not long ere we arrived at the Island of Scyros ; and soon after, the Princess was conducted to the Castle of it, by Nicomedes , with as much honour, and respect, as if the place had belonged to the Pontick King. Statira's Appartment was magnificent, both for the Largeness, and the Furniture of it, and had an unlimited Prospect towards the Sea; next to hers was the Prince Pharnaces's ; and a little beyond his, I was Lodged: But though it were at some distance from the Princess, yet by the obliging Neighbourhood of a long Gallery, I could go to her Ante-Chamber, without passing through any other Room. In this place, my Wounds, as obedient to Mithridatia's commands, as I, or my Chyrurgions, began daily to mend, and so fast, that I found, I should be sooner ready to serve her, than restored to the capacity of doing it. Every day, Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes gave me the honour of a Visit; and the Princess manifested her concernment in my Recovery, by often sending Nerea to inquire after it. I thought it not strange, that the King of Bythinia continued in the Island, whilst the Defects in his Fleets were repairing; nor that the King of Cappadocia did it longer, because his Wounds were not so fully consolidated, but that the motion of the Sea, might be both troublesome and dangerous to him: But I admir'd, that Nicomedes , when his Galleys were fitted, did not imploy them to improve by a new Success, the fresh one, his Conduct and Courage had given him, which was not more contrary to his Interest, than his Practice. But alas! I had too many sad Thoughts relating to my own Condition, to admit me to imploy often any of them, upon anothers; and I could not fancy for what end, Statira was so concerned in my Life, resolving to give her self to Ascanius , which would make it my Torment; neither could I imagine, Why the Gods had so strangely preserv'd me from Death; and as strangely, twice in one Day, separated Mithridatia from the King of Cyprus ; and by such admirable ways, had brought me to wait on her in her misfortunes; as well as in a high degree, to have been the unhappy cause of them. These Generals, you may easily believe, were not unfruitful in affording me Particulars, which never left me unentertained; and never entertained me with any thing that was clear, but that my Condition was uncapable of any Remedy, but that only which Statira's positive Commands had forbidden me. Oh Gods! (continued Callimachus ) Had I then known I was Nicomedes his Son, how many Miseries might I have avoided? How many Battels by Sea and Land, had been unfought? And some Lives had been spared, for which I joyfully would have laid down my own; and for the loss of which, I shall mourn whilst I have any Life. Callimachus , at these words, could not resent a higher Grief, than invaded Artabanus and Artavasdes by their Sympathizing with him; which he saw so evidently, that it brought at once, an Accession to his Sorrow, and made him the sooner hasten to conceal the effects of it, by thus prosecuting his Relation: One Evening, the Princess having sent the fair Nerea to visit me, (who was much my Friend) I endeavour'd, as I had unsuccessfully several times before, to win her to such a sense of and concernment for my Condition, as thereby to learn something less obscurely what Statira's Inclinations were towards me, than her own excessive Reservedness would allow me to discover from her self; and finding, Nerea was less unwilling then, to lissen to words of that Nature, than she had been before; after some Introductory discourses, I spoke to her to this effect: That great goodness, which you have on all occasions manifested to me; and that great necessity I shall have, to hope in it hereafter, will give you the trouble of my disclosing to you some Thoughts, and Secrets, which I am so far from imparting to any other, that I dare hardly impart them to my self: Yes, fair Nerea , I have the highest, and the most improbable design of any Man living; and having told you so much, I need not tell you any more, to acquaint you with it. A design, which cannot promise more felicities, if it succeed, than there are impossibilities to prohibit so much as the hopes of its Success; a Design, I so much despair of effecting, and am so criminal in undertaking, that I would now have Died of these Wounds, as much upon the accompt of the last of these Causes as the first, had I not received an absolute command to the contrary, from the Princess, whom to disobey, would hardly have been a greater Sin, than to obey, will be a Punishment to me. But, Oh Gods! Nerea , if you have any pity for this unhappy Callimachus , Tell him, tell him, I beseech you, for what end it is, he is injoyned to Live; since he sees nothing in Life, which makes not Death as desirable to him, as it ought to be dreaded, by the too happy Ascanius . Since (repli'd Nerea ) you are pleas'd to make me your Confident, I shall endeavour to deserve that Trust by all ways, but those, which, in my opinion, may render me unworthy of it; and therefore, I will not scruple to acquaint you, That my own Observations of you, told me that long since, which now you tell me; and from the first hour, I had reason to believe what now I do, I had as much reason to deplore the Design you ingaged in: Such a confluence of Obstacles being visible, and many more invisible, that the Result was not more apparent to me, than I doubt it will be unsupportable to you. 'Tis not that your Services have not been highly eminent, and many; nor that they have been paid to a Person insensible of them: But---Here Nerea stopp'd; and therefore I did by fresh and vehement Implorings, beg her to continue, and at last vanquish'd by my Prayers, or Importunities, she thus proceeded: But, the power of the Father, and his ingagement also; the punctual obedience of the Daughter, and the Ignorance of your Extraction, outweigh all your Actions, and turn the Scale so heavily, that the possibility is not great, it will ever be rais'd again: You see (said Nerea ) I flatter you not; for having profess'd a Friendship to you, and Sincerity being the noblest part of Friendship, I had rather practise it, though it might afflict you, than the contrary, though it might please you. That (I repli'd, fetching a Sigh) which you now have told me, has been hitherto my highest apprehension, and by your telling it me, it becomes as high a certainty; and since it is so, How can Statira injoyn me to Live? If she says I have been too presumptuous in daring to lift up my Eyes to her; I am so far from denying it, that I would have Died, that I would have Killed my self, to have revenged her, and to have punished my self: And possibly a voluntary Death, embrac'd by an Offender, should be a sufficient expiation for an unavoidable Offence. 'Tis in this only, obliging Nerea , that I will now beg your Assistance; and since so many invincible Impediments deny me the expectation of obteining her Esteem, I will not despair, but, by your Intercession, to obtein her Mercy; and that is, her Permission to Dye. Possibly (said Nerea ) you could hardly ask any thing of her, which she would not sooner grant you; I say, any thing, whatever; and even all those Obstructions I so lately Particularized, might be sooner vanquish'd, than this one Request yielded unto. No, Callimachus , she has a Value for you, and such a one, that had her Inclinations the Liberty of a free Acting, possibly you would not have too much cause to complain: Think not therefore, to imploy my Services in so fatal, and ungrateful a Request; for she that to save your Life so recently expos'd her own to an eminent Danger, will not by a voluntary consent, give that away, which she has shewed is not indifferent to her. I was strangely surprised at these words, and therefore raising my self up hastily, I begg'd her to explain what they meant; She therefore told me, what Tomsones had concealed from me, and thereby fill'd me with so much Trouble, Satisfaction, and Amazement, that, for a while, I remain'd as Moveless, and Speechless, as, after I came to my self, I found I had too much cause to wish I had eternally continued. As soon as I could speak, I cried out, Great Gods! Was I not miserable enough in the disability of not preserving Statira's Liberty, and in surviving that crime, and misfortune, but that thereby I must also have been the occasion of hazarding even her Life? Ah! Farewel those Griefs which hitherto tormented me: Mithridates's Authority, Statira's Obedience, Ascanius's Felicity, and my own concealed Extraction; These deserve no longer that Name, nor can any longer act their usual Effects, compar'd to what now I have resented. Those only related to me; but this to my Princess; for whom my concerns are higher than any I can have for my self, as much as she is above me, or my Designs above my Birth, or Merit. Nerea , who hoped what she had acquainted me with, would have had a contrary Effect, to that she now too late found it had produced in me, left no Reasons unspoken, to suppress that despair, she had so unexpectedly cast me into; and though she did long insist upon the too great Right, and Empire, which Statira had over that Life she had saved, for me to destroy it without, nay against, her Permission; and how by that Action of hers, I might be convinced, my Preservation was not inconsiderable to her; since even, to preserve an unfortunate Life, as I tearm'd it, she eminently indanger'd her own: Yet it was a long time, ere she could reduce me to any moderate Thoughts; neither had she ever brought me to that desired Condition, but upon reiterated promises, of her Assistance, and of embracing my Concernments with her best Care, and Affection; which, by that high, and great esteem Mithridatia had for her, gave me some hopes; but such faint ones, that though I could not but entertain them, yet I could not tell why I did so. Nerea having staid much longer than she had used, or than she had designed, no sooner found me fit to be trusted with my self, but she left me to my self: The only Company I could justly desire; and the worst I could keep. The Continuation of Callimachus his HISTORY . the Relation of it as unsupportable to you, as the Events in it are to me; I will therefore acquaint you, that after a few days, I recovered Strength enough to walk the length of that Gallery, which was between my Lodging, and the Princess's Appartment; and welcoming that dawning Health I then injoy'd, only as 'twas an effect of my Obedience to her Commands; and in hope, that I might by it be inabled to serve her: I sent to beg her Permission to wait on her, which she was pleased to send me; and I, soon after, to make use of. By accident there was none but Nerea with her, when I came into her Chamber; and therefore, with the less constraint, I had the opportunity of Kneeling before her, and of telling her, I am come, Madam, to lay that Life at your Feet, which is yours upon so many Accounts, that I durst not end it without your Leave, much less against your Commands; though by its great unhappiness in having fail'd serving you, and its infinitely greater, in thereby having engaged your Goodness to indanger yours, it merited a thousand Deaths; and if I can support its being unextinguished, 'tis only because thereby I suffer a more signal Punishment, than by the most tormenting Death could be inflicted on me. Statira having made me Rise by her repeated Commands, was then pleas'd to answer me, Since by your belief, that I have a Right to your Life, I have thereby obteined a power to preserve it; I will not deny a Title, which, though no just one, yet is very advantageous and obliging to me; and though as yet I see no visible means for my deliverance, yet I will not despair of it. The Gods having given me so powerful an earnest of it, as your recovery of Health: which when you injoy'd, I have been freed from a more hopeless and more unpleasing Condition than now I am in. Madam, (I replied) That eminent Virtue, and Innocence, which has shined so bright in the whole course of your Life, may well invite you to believe, though the means of your speedy Releasment is not now visible, yet it is certain: But alas! Madam, my Crimes make me despair of the honour of contributing to it; for he that could not rescue you at first from being a Prisoner, and could afterwards survive that Infamy, cannot, I fear, be reserved for a happiness even too great for a Person of the most unblemished Fortune: But yet, Madam, this I do promise you, if ever I am bless'd with the opportunity once more to draw my Sword for your deliverance, if I be not so happy as to Act it, I will avoid being so miserable as to Out-live it; and by a second Attempt, repair You, or punish on my Self, the misery of my unsuccessfulness. But, Madam, since yet we hear nothing from Ascanius , nor that the generous Ataphernes has yet a probability of getting together a Fleet able to force his passage with an Army hither; Why may there be no endeavours used by Treaty, to win Nicomedes to pay you the Duty of restoring you to Freedom, since with so much Cheerfulness he pays you every one else? And though the way by which you lost it, being by Arms, seems to require by the like way your Restauration, and that by no other means but those, I have so much of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) an expectation to serve you; yet so much I prefer your Satisfaction, before all things else, that I cannot but pray for any way which may lead to such an End. I confess, (said the Princess) that Nicomedes's usage is so full of Generosity, that since there wants nothing to compleat the Evidencing of his, but restoring to Liberty, a Person, whose loss of it, is neither considerable to him, or his Enemies; neither would her Recovery of it, be otherwise. I have admired at my Detension, especially Ataphernes having so far prevail'd with Mithridates , as to offer him so high a Ransom for me, with the choice of having it, either in Treasure, or the Value thereof, by restoring some Towns and Countries in Bythinia , to his immediate Possession: But it seems nothing will satisfie Nicomedes in Exchange for me, but the intire Resignation of all Bythinia , and Cappadocia ; so that by asking so much, I begin to fear he has no mind to part with me; nor can I ever get out of his hands, but by force; and therefore could I any way contrive your Inlargement, I should hope, that a Fleet led by Ataphernes , and Callimachus , would soon win what an unfortunate Fleet had the unhappiness to lose: And in this desire I have not been Idle, though I have been Unsuccessful; for though Nicomedes over-values me, yet he knows justly how to value you; and therefore, though but a little before your coming now to Visit me, I was impowered by Ataphernes , to propose to him as much for your Releasment, as Ariobarzanes offer'd for his, when he was my Father's Prisoner, yet I received a positive Denial, with an assurance, that nothing could put an end to your Imprisonment, but the end of the War, between him and my Father; and that his Friends in Nicomedia , by presenting you unto him, had given him that, which he more valued than his Victory over the King of Cyprus , and my Brother, and his having made them both his Prisoners. Madam, (I replied) prostrating my self again at her Feet, (from whence she immediately made me rise) I am not able sufficiently to admire your Goodness, or deplore my own Infelicity, that, where I owe both my Life, and Liberty, I must, instead of paying them to you, receive them from you; and though those immense offers you were pleas'd to make Nicomedes , for a worthless Person, be above all things, but your Goodness, and my Wonder and Confusion at it; yet I cannot but esteem my self more obliged to him in the refusal, than I could have been, in the acceptance of them: For I know not, if I were at Liberty, whether my usual unhappiness might not involve me in that greatest, of being unable to serve you; but by being in restraint, I have the honour to suffer with you; and therefore, I had rather have a certainty of this, than run a hazard of that: But, I confess, Madam, I have not been without Thoughts, Why so active a Prince, as Nicomedes hitherto hath been, has continued so long uselesly here, after his Navy was repair'd, and after his late Victory had offered him so large a cause for hope, if in the heat of that Success, he had vigorously improved it: It may possibly give me occasion to believe, there is something in this place which he prefers to his Revenge, his Glory, and the Recovery of his Throne: I admire also, at his setting a Value upon what is above all; for nothing can fully pay the setting you at Liberty, but the satisfaction of having done that Duty, without any other Consideration, but the honour of the Performance. Nicomedes has Acted a double Ill; to detein you a Prisoner at all, or, daring to detein you, to offer your Redemption at any Rate. And, Madam, if I may presume to tell my humble Apprehensions, I must say, I know not which has done worse; Nicomedes , since he will Sell you, asking no more, or Mithridates , since Nicomedes will Exchange you, proposing so little: The Kingdoms of Bythinia , and Cappadocia , ought not to be put in Balance, with one moment of your Trouble, much less with your Liberty: The common consequences of Battails, are the winning of Kingdoms, which is a happiness not to be named in comparison with the Guilt of letting the Princess Statira continue a Prisoner. Ah! Madam, Why have the Gods made those only which have the Power to serve you, so unwilling to do it? And him that has so highly the Will, so little the Power to do it? Were Bythinia , and Cappadocia mine, and were the giving up those two Crowns the Price of your Ransom, I would pay it with an unexpressible Contentment, and resent more Happiness in being so devested of Monarchy, than any could injoy by possessing that of the whole World. That which I had spoke of my Apprehensions, concerning Nicomedes's continuance in the Island, and what I had spoke in the later part of my Answer, had covered Mithridatia with Blushes; and therefore the sooner to take me off, from an intent considering of them, She repli'd; with a little Smile; I perceive, Callimachus , though I am unlikely to recover my Liberty, being Nicomedes's Prisoner, I should have been much more unlike, had I been Yours; for, by condemning my Father in refusing so much, you thereby shew, you would have demanded more: But let us not mispend our time in discoursing of things which are past, and on things that will not be; but rather imploy it, to mind what may be, that is, your Deliverance; and as a consequence of that, I shall hope for mine: 'Tis not improbable, but some of those Officers, to whose Care you are committed, may have their Fidelity to Nicomedes conquer'd by that Ransom Mithridates has offer'd him for you; and that I will assure them of, if they will act your Releasment any way. Madam, (I answer'd) Possibly in what I said, you might have found more cause to believe I detested Nicomedes's Crime, than that I would have increased it, had it been in my Power. Could such a vast Misery have again befallen you, as to be a Prisoner; And could such a vaster Guilt have befallen me, as to have made you mine; You could not, I hope, imagine, I would practise more wickedly that Sin, I condemn in another; nor that I would part with Kingdoms to purchase you from a misfortune, which, had I the Power to exempt you from, I would continue you in: Let it, Madam, I most humbly conjure you, suffice, That I am so criminal, and miserable in my Condition, and Actions, and make me not more so, in your Thoughts, where I would appear to You, what I am to my Self, in my own, that is, a Person, who, during the whole course of his Life, would serve you as perfectly in all things as you can imagine, and would sacrifice it a thousand times, rather than one moment admit of a contrary Thought. I believ'd, (said Statira ) That the manner in which I spoke, would easily have convinced you, that my Words, and my Intentions, were different; but since you entertain them otherwise than I meant them, I will seriously assure you, I have no ungrateful Esteem for you; nor will I believe, 'tis in the power of Fortune ever to force you to an Action which may invite me to alter it: But since you do renew your Promises of obliging me in all things, Do it, I beseech you, in this particular I so lately motion'd to you, and desired of you. Madam, (I repli'd) I pay you my humblest Acknowledgments for the Justice you do me, in believing what you now said you believed of me; and for your extreme Goodness, in giving that belief so Prodigal a Reward, as the high honour of your Esteem. But, doubtless Madam, I should too certainly deserve to be eternally deprived of it; if, having a hope, that Nicomedes's Officers could be won, I did not indeavour to win them for your Liberty, for the recovery whereof, I would for ever with Joy lose even the very hopes of my own. Banish, I beseech you (repli'd the Princess) all expectations of that Nature, unless you can hope to win Nicomedes to be unfaithful to himself; for of late, he has Dismissed all his Officers, that Guarded me, and performs that Trust himself, with a greater Assiduity than all of them till then did; and therefore, to design my Freedom any way but by force, is so far from being fit to be attempted, that 'tis not rationally to be hop'd: But if my Enlargement be considerable to you, evince it, by a speedy endeavouring your own, and omit no ways to obtein it; that in your Liberty, I may have grounds to believe I shall speedily after recover mine. I was about to reply, when Pharnaces came into the Chamber to visit his Sister: He was very much surprised to find me there, and seem'd much more pleas'd to see me so well recovered; soon after his Arrival, there came in also Nicomedes , and Ariobarzanes: The first of them, after having paid his respect to the Princess, told me what noble Offers she had made him for my Enlargement, and that the high Value he had for me, not any Hatred to me, had made him decline them; which, if ever an Agreement was made between the King of Pontus , and Him, should be manifested, by giving me an unransomed Liberty. I gave him a Return suitable to his Degree, and to his Civility, and soon after, went back to my own Lodgings; having now in the fair Statira's , too many Witnesses to permit me to continue those Discourses, which they had so disobligingly interrupted. Several Days, things continued in the State they then were in; and yet, to our Admiration, we heard nothing of Nicomedes's intention, to leave us, or of Ascanius's preparations to help us; though almost every Day, by our Conquerour's civility, an express from Ataphernes was admitted to the Princess, to bring him an account of her Health, and to acquaint her with his yet unsuccessful Indeavours for her Inlargement. That generous Prince had also the Goodness, by the same opportunities, still to be inquisitive after my Recovery; and to assure me of his utmost Assistance, towards the freeing me from my Imprisonment; which, because Mithridatia had so positively and repeatedly commanded me to indeavour my self, I did busie my Thoughts about it, and was not over-troubled, that the more I reflected on it, the less likelihood I found of it. For had I escaped, I had fallen into two of those misfortunes which I most apprehended: The being Banished from the happiness of waiting on her; and by Mithridates's wanting a Fleet, from the hopes of serving her; nay, I knew not whether sometimes I were not almost so unworthy, as not to grieve at her Imprisonment, rather than that my Rival should deliver her, and after Marry her. One Morning, when I was alone in my Chamber, Rebadates came into it, being recover'd of his Wounds; and having obtein'd of his Keeper leave to do it, I was pleas'd to see so good a Friend, pass'd that Danger, which his kindness to me had in part cast him into: But the Business he came about, did not a little perplex me; for he came to tell me; That having found his Keeper was a Person to be wrought upon, he had therefore made him such large Offers, if he would connive at his Escape, that he had embraced them, and promis'd the succeeding Night, so to order all things, that without interruption he should get away; that he had given him a rich Jewel he wore about him, so concealed that none of Nicomedes's Souldiers had discovered it, as an earnest of the rest, when he was free: But, said Rebadates , I have thought that he which could do this for me, might do it for you; and therefore I am come to assure you, I had rather you should have your Freedom, than I mine; for an easie Ransom may deliver me, but I am assured you are Valued above any. Therefore I conjure you, Sir, deny not this profer of my Service, having by my now Condition, no other way, but that, to pay you any: I embraced and thanked Rebadates for this high Evincement of his kindness, though I wished perfectly he had never conferr'd it on me; and then told him, That if his Keeper could imploy his industry, for acting the inlargement of the Princess, it would be a Service indeed, and should be paid with Treasures, which should inrich him, and his Posterity. I did already (said Rebadates ) propose that unto him, but he cut me off, with an assurance, that it was impossible; since his King himself guarded her: But when I proposed you unto him, he seem'd not to be out of hopes thereof, and has within an hour promised to bring me a good account of his Endeavours therein; and I have promised him, he should receive from Mithridates a proportionate Reward, to the greatness of that Service; for he assured me, if he could contrive your Escape, he must accompany you in it, since, that would be a Crime above the hope of pardon, though it were attributed to carelesness, and not design. I will not trouble you (said Callimachus ) with the Dispute I had with Rebadates , to persuade him to imbrace the opportunity of his Deliverance; nor in telling you, the Trouble I was in, when I could not prevail with him; for he was unconquerable in his Civility to me: And soon after he withdrew to learn from his Keeper what Success he had met with, that he might acquaint me with it; whereby I might accordingly provide my Self for that appointed hour. To the short, after he had with some Impatience waited for his Keeper's Return, some hours beyond the prefixed Time, his Chamber-door was hastily open'd, and instead of his Keeper, a rude Stranger came to him, and told him, his whole Design was discovered, and the manager of it put to a painful Death for his intended Treachery; and that, since he and I so unworthily abused that Liberty the Kings had allowed us, we should suffer for that Offence: I being now confined positively to my Chamber, with new, and more numerous Guards; and he being expresly sent to keep him, from the hopes of any new design. This which this Officer told Rebadates , was too true; for the unhappy Keeper, sounding the inclinations of one, whose help he was to need in my Escape, did it so uncircumspectly, that he discover'd his own, which the other went, and revealed to the two Kings; who punished the Keeper with Death, and confined us to our Chambers, with Guards too numerous, and too faithful, to be Deceived, or Corrupted. I did indeed with much more Trouble endure the being denied the Happiness of waiting on Mithridatia , than my loss of Liberty, or the narrow Limits I was confined unto; but one Evening, when I was in a deep Sadness for Mithridatia's , and my own Condition, Nicomedes alone came into my Chamber, and having Lock'd the Door after him, he told me; I am come, Callimachus , to act a thing, which possibly you will wonder at, and possibly you would more wonder at, if you were acquainted with the cause, for I come to restore you to your Liberty; and that, which lately Mithridates's great Offers, and, which is much more, the Princess Statira's Commands, could not prevail with me to do, I now perform of my Self, without any consideration, but that of obliging so worthy a Person, and perhaps of saving him too. But I doubt I have said too much, in those last words; at Midnight therefore, fit your self to follow Ostanes , the Officer that now Guards you, who will bring you a Disguise, by which he will safely conduct you to a Vessel in a small Creek, which has Orders to carry you where ever you will go. All that I ask of you, is, that you keep an inviolable Secrecy concerning the means of your Escape: Let it always be believed, an effect of your having corrupted the Fidelity of Ostanes , who is one I intirely Trust, and much Esteem; and whom I recommend to your Favour, till I may again, by some fortunate Accident, openly restore him to mine. I confess, (continued Callimachus ) few Accidents in all my Life surprised me more than this; and the longer I Reflected on it, and every Circumstance of it, the more cause I had still to continue that Reflection: I told Nicomedes so much, and after, by many Acknowledgments, I had endeavour'd to exalt the gallantry of this Action, and the gratitude I had for it, I said unto him; Generous Prince, though after what you have done, there might seem nothing left for me to do, but to endeavour, by continued Services, to pay you some part of my vast Debt; yet I must, by an humble Request, add unto, and increase it: 'Tis, that you will pardon me, if, as soon as my hands are free, I use them against you; or else, that you will not restore me to a Liberty, which I must forthwith imploy against the Giver of it: For whilst you keep the Princess Statira a Prisoner, I must as certainly be your Enemy, as in all things else, I will be your Servant. When I told you, (the King of Bythinia repli'd) That I would set you at Liberty, I told you too, I exacted nothing of you, but your Silence; neither after the Declaration you now make me, do I expect any thing else, but a Grant of that, which I desired of you before. This (said I) is a Gallantry worthy of Nicomedes ; and this is a higher Favour, than his free Breaking of my Imprisonment; and therefore Loads me with a greater Trouble, than by it, he has freed me from: A Trouble, which shall never cease, but with my Life, unless by some Retributions, as eminent and signal as the Sense I have of your Generosity, I be inabled to act my Gratitude for it. That silence you injoyn me, I vow Religiously to observe, and by my kindness to Ostanes , I shall indeavour to make him endure his absence from you, as little inconveniently as may be, and in some degree convince him, by the respect I shall pay the Subject, how highly I esteem my self indebted to his Prince: Of whom also, I will not beg to know why such a Secrecy is injoyned me; because I perceive, that ought to be as much a Secret to me, as from whose obligingness I owe my Deliverance, ought to be to every one else: Though Sir, I must assure you, 'tis no small Trouble to me, being so deeply in your Debt, to be prohibited from publickly acknowledging it, till I shall be so happy, as to pay it: But, Sir, since this Action, when known to the Princess Statira , will, I hope, procure you her Thanks for it, which will be no ill Reward of it; though it will not at all diminish my Score; May I not beg your Permission, before I go, to tell her of my going, and from whom I derive that Liberty, that in her acknowledgments to you, you may have cause never to repent what you have done to me, if my own unhappy Condition should not allow me the satisfaction of doing any thing by way of Retribution for my self. I am sorry, Callimachus, (Nicomedes repli'd.) That you should ask me any thing I should deny you: But I hope, when you remember, that for above twenty Days, you have been kept with such strictness, that you have not been permitted to see any one, nor to be seen by any, should you just before your Escape, have that Freedom allow'd you by me, for it cannot be by any other, it might raise a suspition, by what means you obtein'd it, and by destroying that end, for which I have desired so perfect a Secrecy from you, draw a greater inconvenience upon me, than I believe, could I acquaint you with it, you would have me run into. But to omit nothing for your satisfaction, I will possibly contrive some way before the hour of your departure, whereby you may acquaint the Princess with it, and receive her Commands before you leave her; though neither She her self, nor the Person imploy'd between you, must upon any tearms know I have the least hand in, or so much as knowledge of, your Escape. Perhaps (continued Nicomedes ) one Day I may Live to tell you, Why I have thus dealt with you: But if such a thing should never happen, oblige me in believing there was reason for it. As soon as he had done speaking, he immediately withdrew, and with as little Noise as he had made when he came in; leaving me, not so full of wonder at the Action, and the Circumstances accompanying it, as of Trouble, that now I must forsake either my Princess, or highly Disobey her. The unhappiness of this ill Choice, entertained me till an hour before Midnight, when I was interrupted by my Doors being opened, and by seeing Nerea come into my Chamber, who, in many Blushes, for so undue a Time to give me a Visit, told me, She now did it, because Ostanes a little before had whisper'd to her, there was a very great and real necessity of her coming to me immediately, where, possibly, she might hear of things not unpleasing to her; but that she was to come then, or never: She told me, that having inform'd the Princess thereof, she had forthwith injoyned her to come to me, which Orders she had obey'd, being conducted to the Door by Ostanes , who had open'd, and then was waiting at it for her Return. After that I had paid her my Acknowledgments for the favour of her Visit, which could not be so unseasonable, but that her Virtue would preserve it from being thought so by any, that had the happiness to know her; I gave her an Account, how that above my Expectation, and even above my Desires also, a certain way was offer'd me, of escaping that Night; the Overture whereof I could not decline listning to, because it was Mithridatia's repeated Commands; but that I so much preferr'd being a Prisoner, when she was one, before Liberty, when she was deni'd hers, that at the same time, I told her, Probably, I could Escape; I begg'd her leave, not to do it; though by being of late deprived of the high Duty and Happiness of waiting on her, I had been deprived of my only comfort in my Imprisonment; which yet I supported, without repining, as a righteous Judgment, for having been Guilty of the Princess's. Nerea told me, she would carry my message, and durst tell me my Answer before she had received it. To be brief, she went immediately to Mithridatia's Chamber, told her what I had said, and brought me a positive Command, to lay hold of that opportunity, which was so happily presented me, by which she now had more than hopes of soon being restored to her Liberty also: Nerea told me at the same time, if I should delay my Obedience to these Orders, it would trouble the Princess, almost as much as her restraint; She did acquaint me too with a particular I did think somewhat strange, which was, that as she was returning to me, passing by Pharnaces's Chamber-door, she perceived Nicomedes gently coming out of it, who no sooner saw her, but he hastily shut the Door again, and seem'd by his Looks to be in no small disorder at his having been seen by her at that hour in that place. I had not much leisure then, to Reflect upon this assurance, being so incessantly press'd by Nerea to that Obedience Statira had commanded me, and so concernedly expected from me; which, at last, I resolved to pay her, and begg'd Nerea to acquaint her therewith, who immediately retired to do it. And not long after, Ostanes came into my Chamber, with a Livery-coat of one of Nicomedes's Guards, which I put on, and being led by him, I past all the Souldiers, and came to that Creek, where the Vessel staid for me; and all things being in readiness, the Wind too favouring us, I desired them to direct their course for Nicomedia , to which City in two Days we arrived, without meeting any Impediment: I went first to the Appartment of the generous Ataphernes , whom I found in a deep Melancholy in his Closet; and because he protested to me, my Absence and Imprisonment did partly cause it, he forthwith cast off so large a proportion of it, as did evidence the reality of that assurance; after many Embraces, he honoured me with, and many Inquiries after the Princess Statira's Health, and Condition, he was pleas'd to acquaint me, how many ways he had endeavour'd to get a Naval Force able to Land his Army in the Island of Scyros , to restore his Sister, his Brother, and me, to our Liberty: But that the late Victory Nicomedes obteined, had so terrified all Auxiliaries from serving against him, that even in that Success, he not only ruin'd the Cyprian Fleet, but almost the hopes of ever getting another together to oppose him: He further told me, that as soon as Ascanius was defeated, he had prevailed with Mithridates to post away Betuitus , than somewhat recovered of that tedious Indisposition he had so long Languish'd under, into Cylicia , to ingage all the Naval strength of that Nation; in which Betuitus had been so diligent, and successful, that whilst Ascanius was here Visiting the King, and Court, acknowledging the high Favour of his inlargement, excusing his Loss to them, and making many positive Assurances of repairing his Defeat, and restoring Statira , and Pharnaces , to their Freedom; Betuitus had so far ingaged the chief Cylician Sea-men, that when Ascanius was return'd to Cyprus , he found in his own and his Brother's unsuccessfulness, his Maritim strength so exhausted, that he was necessitated to send to hire a forein Help; but he could procure none, by reason of their pre-ingagement to my Father's Admiral. But the Cylicians hired by Betuitus , are not near enough, with that little Sea-strength Mithridates has left, to form a Fleet strong enough of themselves to oppose Nicomedes ; so that, though by preventing Ascanius , we have not done our selves much good, yet we have hinder'd him from wholly ingrossing that Force, which is necessary to reduce the Island of Scyros. Betuitus , who is a faithful Servant to our Family, and particularly affectionated to Statira , and me, having receiv'd a private Advertisement from me, how passionately I desir'd her Deliverance, without being indebted to Ascanius for it, but only to himself; had no sooner assur'd the Cylicians to Mithridates's Service, than he forthwith went to the Phoenicians , and has prevail'd with many of them, to come under my Father's Pay; and whilst these are fitting their Galleys, he is returning to Miletus , where, if he can have the like Success, he assures me, not only to have a Fleet able to oppose Nicomedes , but to have it ready, before Ascanius has his, who, by a double disappointment in Cylicia , and Phoenicia , has been compell'd to send into Egypt , to hire Galleys there. And now (continued Ataphernes ) we hourly expect to hear of Betuitus's Arrival at Miletus , and what Success his endeavours will meet with there. I was not (said Callimachus ) a little pleas'd to find what I most desir'd, in so hopeful a way towards a good Result; nor was the Prince less pleas'd, when, in Obedience to his Commands, I had acquainted him how by the means of Ostanes , I had acted my Escape; even when I had not only lost the hopes, but the desires of it; neither would he be satisfied, till I had called in Ostanes to him, whom he Embraced with many Thanks for what he had done, (for I never mentioned any thing to him of Nicomedes , because of my solemn Vow) and forced him to take such rich Jewels, that even those had been of themselves too Prodigal a Ransom for me. Ataphernes soon after told me, how he intended, and had got Mithridates's leave, to Imbarque his Army in Betuitus's Fleet, not only to Strengthen it, but if it were bless'd with a Victory, immediately to Land, and prosecute that End, for which chiefly, if not only, 'twould be a Blessing to him. I was exceedingly Joyed at this assurance, because the Duty of my Office led me, where the Duty of my Passion call'd me; but the Prince, who knew how much I should rejoyce his Father, by waiting on him, made me attend on him to Mithridates , though it were very Late; we found the King in his Night-gown, ready to go to Bed; but as soon as he saw me, he ran, and embraced me, with this flattering Complement, That he never had received more refreshment from Sleep, than he now received in seeing me: I will not Enumerate all the Questions he asked me concerning the Princess Statira ; the Prince Pharnaces ; their Usage; What had made Nicomedes of late so unusually Unactive; nor how inquisitive he was of the means of my Escape, to all which I gave him the truest Answers I could; and when I had mentioned to him, the Obligation I had to Ostanes , he sent for him into his Closet, loaded him with rich Gifts, and setled a plentiful Pension on him during his Life. Mithridates by my Return, had been so long interrupted from his intended Rest, that I thought it a Duty to Retire, which, whilst I was ready to perform, an express came to him, and Ataphernes , with the sad News of the Death of Betuitus , the same Day of his Arrival at Miletus ; His Age, and the excessive Diligence he had used in preparing a Fleet, in so many Regions for his King's Service, and the Deliverance of his Prince, and Princess, had cast him into a Fever, which ended his Life, just as he was come to that City, where he hop'd to increase his Navy considerably, and before which he had appointed all his Ships, and Galleys, waged amongst the Cylicians and Phoenicians to Rendezvouz. This sad Intelligence, wounded sensibly the Pontick King, for he had no Subject to whom he could intrust his Fleet; and he fear'd, lest those Auxiliaries engaged by Betuitus , might esteem themselves absolved by his Death; and the Miletians also, wanting the presence and sollicitations of the Pontick Admiral, might decline that Assistance, in which Mithridates had his Rationallest hopes. I was not unmoved at the Loss of so worthy a Person, and in such a Juncture of time, (and possibly those two Reasons gave the Prince opportunity to move his Father, to imploy my Service) ere I could present him an Offer of it: He told Mithridates , That my longest practice in War had been by Sea; that in several Actions I had gain'd some repute in the minds of those which frequent that Element; and that by my Education, and long Residence in Miletus , my Interests there were likelier to contribute to his Service, than any other he could employ: He could have added, with at least as much probability, that my concernments for the relief of the fair Statira , and succeeding my Rival in that Duty, would add Wings to my haste, as well as Courage to my hopes. In brief, Ataphernes said so much, and Mithridates believed so much, that immediately he declared me Successor to Betuitus , and gave Directions forthwith to dispatch my Commission, and finish my Orders and Instructions. I was a thousand times ready to have prostrated my self at the Pontick King's feet, to evidence my Joy, and Gratitude, for an Employment which I valued more than all his Empires; for by it I was inabled to dispute Statira on that Element, on which she had been forced from me; and in a possibility to recover that Glory, which my Rival then had lost. Never did Ataphernes so sensibly Oblige any, as then he did me; and never did Looks speak more acknowledgments, than mine did to him. The generous Craterus , newly recover'd of his Wounds, hearing of my Arrival, came to Visit me, and to give me new Assurances of an old Friendship; I met him just as the Prince and I were coming out of the King's Appartment, where, in Embraces, he celebrated my Return; and the honour Mithridates had so freshly bestowed upon me; which, in a moment, was dispersed about the Court: So, that the news of my Liberty, and Succession to Betuitus , went together. I had only the next Day allowed me by the King, to visit, and take leave of all my Friends; and though the time was short, yet the Duty of my impatience, made me esteem it too long. My faithful Demetrius I found recover'd of his Wounds, and ready to go my Journey. When Ataphernes retired to his Chamber, I waited on him thither, and in renew'd Repetitions of Gratitude, I endeavour'd to let him see, I was not insensible, though unworthy, of his Favours: The assurances I gave the Prince, that I would not mis-imploy one moment in the relief of the Princess Statira , made him give Craterus Orders to have his Army in a readiness to Ship on twelve hours notice, when ever I came upon the South-west Coast of Bythinia ; that if the Gods favour'd my Arms by Sea, the Land Forces might be ready to be transported into the Island of Scyros , to perfect that Deliverance, which chiefly occasion'd the War; in which Ataphernes was resolved in Person to appear. That Night, when I retir'd, Demetrius told me, amongst many other things, that he was exceedingly deceived, if Monima had not some sensible Reliques of that Affection she had once conferr'd on me at Miletus . I wonder'd to hear a Discourse of this Nature from him, who never had practised the like before; and knowing of how dangerous a consequence the least vent of that belief might prove, both to her, and me; I told him so much, in tearms which might let him understand how highly I was concerned in his Cautiousness therein; and then ask'd him, What Rise that Apprehension of his had? (For, possibly, by my knowledge thereof, I might be better instructed how to carry my self towards her, and others; for though those Beauties which had first conquer'd me at Miletus , were still as Flourishing, and Charming as ever, and had received no small Accession, by the noble Ornaments of a Crown; yet I confess, her inconstancy to me, and the resistless and triumphant Graces both of the Princess Statira's outward, and internal Beauties, had so intirely possessed all my Affection, and Admiration, that Monima's favour was so far from being my desire, that it would have been my trouble.) Demetrius in Answer to my Question, told me; As soon, Sir, as the Queen had heard of my Wounds, and Danger, she sent her most experienced Physicians and Chyrurgeons to me, and commanded their constant attendance on me, till I was inabled thereby to attend her; which, as soon as ever I was, she sent for me to her, and without permitting me to pay her my humble acknowledgments for that recovery, which (under the Gods) I owed unto her favour, she began a Discourse of you; and knowing I was not ignorant of that Affection she had for you at Miletus , she did the more freely speak unto me; there being then either by design, or accident, none of her Women in her Cabinet: Her first Questions were, Whether yet you had discover'd from whence you derived your Extraction? How you had resented her necessitated Marriage of Mithridates? (For, continued Demetrius , she spake in such an Accent that word necessitated , as I perceived well, she had a desire I should observe it) And whether you had ever had a Passion for any before her, or had ever resented any since? I easily found she was more intent in my Return to the last part of this Question, than to all the rest; and though I gave her the best Answers I could, yet still me-thought she had something to say, which she had not said, or would not say. And though in her whole Discourses, her Words, had they been written, could not have strictly born a sence which could have manifested any thing more, than a common Affection, and a concernment for you, yet in their Tone, in her Looks, and in her Dwelling more upon some parts of her Demands, than on others; I had abundant cause to believe, her inquiries after you, were the productions of more than an ordinary curiosity: And by several other Discourses, at several other times, (for ever since I was able to indure the Air, I was daily commanded to wait upon her) I perceived, she still reteined her former Passion for you; and was not a little Jealous, you had dedicated yours to some other Beauty. Demetrius having ended speaking, I did again with earnestness repeat my former Orders to him; and though I needed Rest, yet before I would take any, I did in my Thoughts propound a thousand ways how to carry my Self towards Monima , from a continuance of whose Affection to me, I more easily foresaw the Prejudices, than their Remedies: And after all were examined, I found none attended with less inconveniencies, than never to wait on her, but in Ataphernes's Company, or the Princess Statira's when she should return, for thereby I should not decline the Duty of attending her, and yet do it in Company, where she would be confined from evidencing any Inclination for me. The next Morning I attended Ataphernes at his Rising, and begg'd him, that, in the Afternoon, he would let me wait on him to the Queen, to kiss her Hands, both as my first Visit, and my last. He promised me this favour; and then we went to the King's Appartment, who had sat up so Late, in preparing my Orders, that it was Noon ere he Rose; and then finding himself unfit for Business, he told me, 'Twould be the next Morning, ere I could begin my Journey. That Afternoon, Ataphernes led me to the Queen's Appartment, who received me with many obliging Civilities, and with Looks, which nothing but Statira's Idea could have enabled me to resist; the whole Discourse consisted of such usual things, that I shall not repeat any of them in particular: And after an Hour, the Prince rising to take his leave, I desired the honour of the Queen's Commands, and acquainted her, that being by the King's Orders to go to Miletus , 'twas not improbable, but she might have some Services to command me thither. Monima instantly replied, You have not a little obliged me, Callimachus , in letting me know you were to go to Miletus , for I hear Irene's Father being Dead, she inheriting all his Riches, is return'd thither with her Husband, where most of them were left her: I intend to present her something, which may let her see, she continues in my remembrance and affection; and therefore, I will desire you this Evening to come hither and receive it; for I know your delivering it, will give it a double good reception. I was so confounded at this Command which had defeated all I had built, and so vexed at my Self for having given a Rise to it, that I had like to have discovered to the Queen and Prince my disorders, which the better to conceal. I told her, I would not fail to come, and receive the Honour of such an imployment; since, to observe her Commands, and oblige the fair Irene , were Duties, in which I found a high contentment. Ataphernes hereupon retir'd, and I durst not beg him again to go in the Evening to Monima's , lest that might have discover'd, what I was so desirous to keep from his Knowledge. From the Queen's side, we went to wait on the Princess Nisa , and the Princess Cleopatra , who then began to disclose Beauties, which, but for the fair Statira's , had not had any Superiour in the World. Both their entertainments consisted in things relating to the Danger their Sister had been in, and inquiries, how she indur'd her Imprisonment, and what hopes there was to free her from it. By that time these Duties were paid, and other Visits I owed to my Friends, it was Evening; and therefore I sent Demetrius to discover whether there were any Company with Monima , resolving when there was most, to wait upon her, that I might not be ingaged in a particular Discourse with her, which I so much fear'd, and she, I found, desir'd: I waited so long, that at last he returned, with assurance, that both the Princesses, Nisa , and Cleopatra were with the Queen, attended by all the greatest Persons of the Court. To embrace therefore this desir'd opportunity, I went directly towards the Queen's Appartment, and crossing a long Gallery, which was in my way, I found Mithridates in it, who, seeing me, called me to him, as he said, to make me a sharer in the good News he had then receiv'd; which was a Packet sent by an express from Ascanius , to assure him, though he had met with many difficulties in forming a Fleet for the Princess Statira's Deliverance, and his Service, yet now he had vanquish'd them all, and would in twenty Days present him a Navy, which he was confident would cure the Wounds of his former misfortunes, and present his Princess and her Brother with that Liberty, the loss whereof was more insupportable to him, than it could be to them. I was not (continued Callimachus ) generous enough to rejoyce at such an additional Strength to the Princess's Deliverance; I had rather have had it left to my Fleet, than have had the Assistance of my Rivals: But this Packet made the King detein me a long hour, in resolving where the two Fleets should Rendezvouz; and when, and how they should prosecute the War. Miletus was judged the most fit place for the Fleets assembling; that being in the way, for the Cyprian Fleet, and the appointed Rendezvouz by Betuitus for all his Phoenician and Cilician Galleys, as well as the place from whence we expected so considerable a Force, which I thought would the sooner be much Augmented by their seeing how considerable a Navy we had got together. The Fleet in the Hellespont , had Orders sent, forthwith (Wind and Weather serving) to Rendezvouz in the great Bay before Miletus , there to expect further Commands. The taking up these Resolves and the dispatches for putting them in Execution, took us up a full hour; so that by the time I came to Monima's Chamber, I found the two Princesses and all the Company had left it; which necessitated me wholly to disobey her Commands, and break my own Ingagement, or else to do that, which, next to an Incivility, and breach of Promise, I most apprehended. Whilst I was debating with my Self what to do, one of the Queen's Women, who thought my stay near the Door, was only to know whether the Queen was at leisure to receive my Visit; was so over Officious, as to go in to Monima , and to tell her I waited at the Door to kiss her Hands; Monima forthwith sent the same Woman, to desire me to come in, which cut off all Debates, and made me follow my Guide, who led me into the Queen's Bed-chamber, who no sooner saw me, but she rose, and came to meet me: But so lovely, and so charming, that had not the remembrance of her Inconstancy, been as much my Preservative, as my Flame to my Princess, I must then have Acted that Sin my self, which was my only Quarrel to her. An hundred Crystal Lamps shined in the Chamber, and yet gave it a less Light, both in degrees, and quality, than the Queen's Eyes: Her Dress was at once so negligent, and advantagious, that I found a great Art consisted in seemingly declining of any: Her Looks had an equal mixture of Sorrow, and Obligingness; and yet I never saw any Face, cover'd with Joy, inhabited with more Lustre, and Empire. I must confess, what I saw, made me often willing to have exchanged the hopes of the Glory of Triumphing over such an Enemy, to have avoided the Temptation of her Conquest; and if ever I knew the power I had over my self, or rather the power the fair Statira had over me, 'twas in that Night remaining (I will not say Unmoved, but I may say) Unvanquish'd. After my little Disorders were over; I told the Queen, Madam, I should not have been guilty of twice troubling you in one Day, had not the honour of your Commands occasion'd it; nor have paid you this last Duty at so uncivil an hour, if the King had not unexpectedly kept me so Late, and injoyned me to begin my Journey so Early, that I must now have obey'd you, or else have been uncapable to do it. Monima walking towards a part of her Chamber, where, though some of her Women had continued in the place they were, yet they could neither see nor hear us; and there seating her self under a great Cloath of State, she told me; I did indeed, Callimachus , expect this favour from you somewhat Earlier; and your staying thus long, might have made me doubt you would not have come, had I not remembred, that you so detested a forced breach of Promise in another, that you would not have acted a voluntary one your self. But you see Mithridates has the power to hinder you, from performing, at your own time, your intentions to me, as well as to hinder me, from observing mine to you: I am so good Natur'd, (she continued, with a Smile mixt with a serious Look, that what she said might be taken either way) that I freely forgive your failer; and I will hope, that your Reason, your good Nature, and my Example, will invite you to practise the like towards me. This Answer (said Callimachus ) made me judge what the whole entertainment of my Visit would consist of; and though it was but what I expected, yet it was also what I fear'd; and therefore the less to intangle my self in Discourse, I only chose to answer such parts of hers, as might give her the least Rise to dwell upon those particulars on which I apprehended she would most insist. I therefore only replied; I will hope, Madam, by that power you have found Mithridates has, you will the sooner pardon an Incivility in me, which is but an effect of that Cause. I shall never (repli'd the Queen) esteem your Visits an Incivility, but an Obligation; yet, lest you should think them otherwise, (for I find you have some Thoughts of me concerning you, which you ought not to have) to silence those Scruples, I do grant you whatever forgiveness you desire: Then lifting up her Eyes, and fixing them on me, she said; May I have that satisfaction, to receive from you, as full a forgiveness, as I have given you? This is the second time I have asked it; and if your Answer be not as positive as the Desire, whatever words your Civility or Wit may disguise it in, I shall esteem it a flat Denial, and deplore it at that Rate. Then casting down her Eyes, which began to swell with some Tears, she added; Callimachus , before you make me any Return, remember what I acted was in obedience to the highest Duty; was a performance of necessity, not choice; and is a punishment as great as the fault. At the end of these words, those Tears which a little before had but appear'd in her fair Eyes, now began to give way to those which were to follow; which did so in such abundance, that though she strove, by wiping them away, to conceal them, or at least their excess, yet both were so visible, that they melted the violence of all my Resentments: And in an Accent, which might as much evidence Truth in one of my Sex, as Weeping could in one of hers, kneeling at her feet, I told her; Whatever, Madam, my Griefs, whatever my Resentments have been, I hope neither of them have been so rude, as to make you doubt my Obedience to any of your Commands: If they have been fo undesignedly unfortunate, they have as much Wounded me in you, as for you; and if an assurance of an intire observance of those Commands you have mention'd to me, can repair that unhappiness, I shall find in my Duty, my contentment. At the end of these words, Monima casting one of her Arms over me, she repli'd; Callimachus , What you have promised cannot be a greater Justice than it is an Obligation; an Obligation of so noble a Nature, and Efficacy, that I ought to cast my self in the like posture, to speak my Gratitude, as you have been in, whilst you perform'd that which caused it. I was not (continued Callimachus ) a little confounded and surprised at what Monima said, and did: But though I were in the Arms of one of the greatest Beauties of the World, and of the greatest Person in it, th' Effects of whose kindness, in the then Dictates of it, I might possibly have carried to a higher degree; yet I had so intirely resigned up my self to the fair Statira , that the highest satisfaction I took in the Queen's favours, proceeded from a knowledge I attain'd thereby, that nothing was capable to alter or diminish my Passion for my Princess, since Monima's Charms, and Kindness, wanted that Power; Charms, I say, which consisted of those almost resistless Ingredients, of Beauty, Kindness, Opportunity, and Quality: And though I were not a little concerned, that Mithridatia should have seen the small transports in which I entertained my first Mistress's favours, that thereby she might have read the intireness of my Flame for the last; yet I had so much respect for the Queen, that I would not have purchas'd such a satisfaction, at so dear a price to her. But after she had a while continued in that Fashion I have mentioned, and I Speechless, occasion'd by what she did, and what I thought; She rais'd her self up at last, with a Face so cover'd with Blushes, that I have since believed, what by surprise she had Acted, having caused that Vermillion, she so long continued what she had done, to give it time to retire: She had no sooner recover'd a little out of those disorders she had been in, than she told me; Rise, Callimachus , lest some unexpected Witnesses of the postures we have been in, might mis-interpret them. These words waked me out of my Thoughts, and whatever else had entertain'd me; and having paid an obedience to her Commands, she told me; I hope, Callimachus , you believe, that great Joy does bring some Madness with it, and therefore, that you will attribute to what you have promised me, all those Productions that assurance has made me guilty of; and since I am now (I hope) restored to your good Opinion, you will permit me, as an effect of that vast Concern I have still had for you, which always continued its first Lustre in me, though clouded to your Sight; to be inquisitive after whatever Relates unto you, and to offer you all the interests I have in Mithridates , to establish any of yours, which you are to derive from him: And because, when I left you at Miletus , (at which words, said Callimachus , she Sighed) you were in no small perplexity, at your Ignorance of your Extraction; Tell me, I beseech you, whether yet you have had any Light of it. Madam, (I repli'd) I am yet as great a Stranger to my Birth, as I was then; but having lost the generous Tellamon , on the Sea, as soon as I had in some degree conquer'd my Sorrows, I resolved, on that Element, to make a diligent Inquiry after him; in which search I continued, till the Gods presented me the occasion to serve the Princess Statira ; and ever since that time, you have seen and known my Adventures. Those Gods (the Queen repli'd) were not a little concerned in the manifestation of my Innocence, and in restoring me to the happiness of your Friendship, since, as the way to the end, they permitted so excellent a Person as the Princess Statira to be reduced to a danger, which only Callimachus's Courage was able to free her from: But, (said Mouima , fixing her Eyes on me) confess to me, I conjure you, Were you not in the same Action, Conquerour, and Conquered? I was not (said Callimachus ) a little confounded at so unexpected a Question; which made the Queen thus to continue; Blush not, Callimachus , at what I ask you, I know nothing greater than the impossibility of not adoring Statira , but the Sin of being ashamed at it: You that did not resist that little Beauty the Gods had favour'd me with, How could you resist those Graces, which disclose themselves with such triumphing Lustre, in that Princess? I tell you not this, to discover your Inclinations, but by letting you know I am acquainted with them, I hope to invite you to make me your Confident: For by the Laws of the Gods, of Men, and of Virtue, being indispensably confined from even the Thoughts of possessing you my self, it will be my happiness to contribute to the making of yours. I know the height of her Birth, and your Ignorance of yours, are vast Impediments; but I know also your Person, and your Actions, are above all other Men's, as much as her Quality is above Yours: I know too, that her exact Obedience to the King, and the near consummation of her Nuptials, are considerable hinderances; but I know also, that Love is a more considerable help: And all my exactest Observations abuse me, if she had not gone with less trouble to the Temple, had she been led thither by Callimachus , instead of Ascanius . Who knows, but that the Glory of her third Deliverance is reserved to you? And who knows, but that those Gods, which so miraculously separated her from the King of Cyprus for a time, may, in the next Battel, separate him from her Eternally? 'Tis not impossible too, but that Mithridates , to reward your Services, and to repair the intended fatal Obedience of his Daughter, may be induced to make that Happiness for you, which the Gods, by so many repeated and admirable Events, have seem'd to declare they design you to; Possibly also, some happy Accident may discover to you in the progress of this Warr, it being Naval, and Tellamon being separated from you on the Sea, from whence you derive your Extraction, and the Knowledge of your Quality, may give you as free an admittance to make your Addresses to Statira , as your Services have given you an interest in her. These (continued Monima ) are the Hopes I have for you; and if, by the affection Mithridates honours me with, I may in any degree contribute by my endeavours to change them unto Certainties, if you esteem me worthy of your Trust, you shall find by my Actions, that I have afresh desired your Friendship, but the more hopefully to place on you the Effects of mine; and by my future Deportment, in some measure, to repair you for the Sins of my past Carriage: For though, Callimachus , I confess I love you, and possibly more than I ought for my Quiet, and perhaps for Yours too; yet, since such an Affection is a Guilt, I the sooner take this way, to free my self from it; and 'tis no small satisfaction to me, that what is the intended remedy of my Fault, should be the evidence of my Esteem and Concernment for you. Never, (said Callimachus ) never, was I reduced to a greater Trouble in forming an Answer, than at that time: The first part of her Discourse, had so flatter'd my Passion, and my Hopes, that I listned to it in Extasies; but the later part, reducing me to the necessity of owning my Flame, or of disobliging the Queen, who so generously offer'd me her Assistance, and seem'd in what she had spoke, to have taken off the Veil from all Disguisements, and to express a Tenderness for me, which at least requir'd Truth and Respect from me; that, between those extremes, I remain'd in Troubles so unexpressible, and great, that the Gods pitying me, sent me an unexpected Relief; for just as I was going to speak, and yet not fully resolv'd what I should say, one of the Ladies of the Queen's Bed-chamber came hastily to her, and told her; Madam, the King has sent to tell you, that, having all this Day wearied himself in Business, he intends to give himself the contentment of passing this Night in your Company; and is now coming through the Gallery hither. Monima casting her Eyes upon me, seem'd, by them, to say something, which, I interpreted, was to express more trouble than satisfaction at the King's message; and rising hastily up, gave me a Present for the fair Irene , and commanded me to tell her, She sent her that, as an assurance, that whomsoever she loved perfectly once, she would always love in that degree. And then hastily [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) taking leaving of me, she went to meet the King, who was almost at her Chamber-door; where she entertained him a while, that I might have the more leisure to retire; which I did, with a Joy equal to the Trouble I was then freed from. I will not trouble you, withall the various Thoughts which imploy'd me, upon what the Queen had done, spoken, and offer'd; but to repair, having so long insisted on this Visit, I will hasten, generous Princes, to tell you, That that Night, I took my last leave of Ataphernes , and having dispatched Persons of Quality, and Parts, with Mithridates's desires to the Cylicians , and Phoenicians , to hasten their Fleets to the Bay of Miletus ; I sent also by expresses of great Trust, Orders to Galatides , Admiral for Mithridates of the Euxin and Hellespontick Squadrons, that, because his Fleet was to pass by the Island of Scyros , where all Ariobarzanes and Nicomedes's Fleet lay, lest they should attempt to intercept him, to keep the Western Coast of Asia , close on his left hand; to have Scouts so far advanced, as to receive timely Allarms; to take up all the small Vessels of Bithynia , and Fisher-boats along the Coast, with as much privacy as possibly he could; and in the beginning of the Night, to give all those small Vessels the Lights of his Fleet, with Order to keep as near that Coast as they could; which might not only delude the Enemy, but endanger them: For his Ships, and Galleys, being of the largest in the World, they would boldly (possibly without Sounding) follow such; and that with all his Fleet, during the Night, he should strike over to the Eastern Coast of Greece , and keep that on his right Hand, till he were gotten so far to the Southward of Greece , as the length of the Bay of Miletus , for which he should then hasten, as fast as his Oars and Sails could carry him. These Orders, soon after my coming to Miletus , I found had not been needless; for, by them, Galatides assur'd me, he not only escaped Nicomedes , but the Lights in the small Vessels so well abused him, that not a few of his were Stranded, and others Cast away, in their Chase, ere the rest of his Fleet perceived the Delusion. The Miletians , who were a People wholly, of late Years, dedicated to their Trade; though they received Mithridates's Letters to them, with all the formalities of reverence, and respect, yet could not be induced to let that King have any help under their publique Flaggs; for Nicomedes seemed to give the Law on the Sea, and their greatest Trade was on that Element; and his Ships had been so Civil to them, as thitherto not to have interrupted it. Yet by the help of the fair Irene , and her Lord, together with that Interest I had gained newly, and formerly, amongst some of the Chiefest of that City, I procured leave to raise what Volunteers I could engage, and particular Vessels I could Hire; which was a Privilege also, they gave at the same time, though unsought after, unto Nicomedes , and Ariobarzanes ; but they made not use of it, either as not wanting it, or not having timely notice of it. From Miletus I daily renew'd my Sollicitations to the Cylicians , and Phoenicians ; and whatever time I had to imploy from the Duties of my Charge, I dedicated it to the fair Irene ; in the happiness of whose Nuptials, I saw enough to make me at once rejoyce at her Condition, and deplore my Own. But when I deliver'd to her Monima's Present, and Words, she told me smiling; If the Queen's assurance be without Limitation, Mithridates has a double Reason to ingage you to Command his Fleets and Armies abroad. But I assured her, all that had been Passion on my side, was turned to Respect; and all that had been seeming Affection on her side, was turned into real Friendship. She told me, she was perfectly glad thereof, both for Monima's sake, and mine. The last Evening that I waited on her, the joyful News was brought me, in her Company, that a great Fleet was discover'd in the South-east, making for the Bay of Miletus: This Advertisement drew me hastily from that excellent Person, and her Lord, and made me take a final Leave of the Magistrates of the City, having that Morning sent into the Bay, all those Men and Vessels I could ingage there, to joyn with Galatides , then Riding there; and though I flatter'd my self with a belief, that this appearing Fleet, was from Cilicia , and Phoenicia , yet least it should be Nicomedes , which might come that Course, either from having persued Galatides , or at the least to Alarm me, by taking that way by which my expected Helps were to come, I hastened on Board, and put my Fleet in the best posture I could to receive them as Enemies, or Friends: But the incertainty soon ceased, my Scouts bringing me word it was the conjoyned Navies of Cyprus , and Egypt , led by Ascanius in Person; and soon after, I perceived in the Flagg of the Admiral, a Venus ascending out of the Waves; but a Venus fairer than she, which sprung out of the Sea: For the lovely Image as perfectly resembled the Princess Statira , as the noblest Piece of Art could the noblest Piece the Gods did ever Create. Ah! How I envied the high honour Ascanius had assumed of Fighting for the Princess Statira under her Picture, and did a thousand times repine, that by the Barbarous Maritim Laws, I could not change my Flaggs! And that the King of Cyprus , by observing those of his Country, might bear such glorious ones! Had I not been confined to those miserable Tyes, I could have hoped, by imitating Ascanius , to have rais'd the Valour of my Souldiers, by letting them see [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) in Copy, what the Original was for which they Fought: My Flagg displayed a Terrestrial Globe; Mithridates thereby intimating his aspiring to the universal Monarchy; so that I bore the World, and Ascanius bore mine: Yet 'twas no small consolation to me, that though I carried not her Image in so conspicuous a Place, as my Rival did; yet I carried it, where it was more Lively drawn, and where I could not out-live the Loss of it. Whilst I was thus entertaining my Self, the Cyprian and Egyptian Fleets cast Anchor, at which I knew not whether I was more pleas'd, or troubled; This, that their Admiral did thereby confess he stood in need of my help; That, because some precious time was lost, in acting for Statira's deliverance. But the various Thoughts I was in, hinder'd me not, from paying to the Cyprian King, the Duty I owed his Title. Wherefore I went forthwith Aboard him, where I was entertained with all imaginable Civility, and Honour; and with no small expressions of his Trouble, that the Cilician and Phoenician Helps were not yet Arrived; which, he said, he esteemed advisable to stay some Days for, that they might lose no accessional Force in so Ambition'd a Victory. I assur'd him, that it was more desirable, with the Force we had, to proceed in so glorious a Quarrel, than to permit the Imprisonment of the Princess so long time, as must be spent in the expectancy of their Arrival; that the Justice of the Quarrel, and the Person for whom 'twas undertaken, were assurances of Success, in the Result of it; and if we thought a good Cause was favour'd by the Gods, we could not but believe thereby, we were supplied with more Strength, than even the desired Addition could produce: And therefore, I offer'd, with the Naval Force I had, to compose the left Wing; that, to stay for those Fleets we expected, would convince the Enemy, and our own Souldiers, that we thought we needed them; and if they came not, as 'twas as probable they would not come at all, as that they should not come by the Day prefixed by Mithridates , and promised by themselves, we must then, either wholly decline the Action, or attempt it, with the evidences of our own doubt of Success; nay, possibly, by a continuance where we were, invite Nicomedes , and Ariobarzanes , to seek us out, when also, by our continuance where we were, we acknowledged we apprehended their Encounter. These Reasons, and that Offer of mine, made the Cyprian King cast off all Thoughts of delaying the Battel, or at least of presenting the Enemy with it; Possibly their own Weight, possibly that none might appear more forward than himself in that Action, in which he was to receive the greatest and highest rewards, made him resolve and declare, that the next Morning he would set Sail for the Island of Scyros : and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) there find the end of his Hopes, or of his Life. And to evidence [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) his Apprehensions sprung from his fears, that my Wing needed assistance, not his, he offer'd me some eighteen Galleys to Fortifie it: But having paid him my Acknowledgments for that offer, I declined it, Thereby to convince him, his Fleet, and mine, That I thought I needed no such Accession. After we had resolved on all things for the Decision of the Battel, in which he chose the right Wing, and assigned me the left, He shew'd me several rare Inventions of his own Subjects, and of the Egyptians ; both which had then the opinion of the best, and most experienced Sea-men in the whole World, as well for Navigation, as Fight. One of which I cannot omit particularizing, which was, that the Egyptians , in most of their Galleys, had divers great Earthen pots, full of small holes; in which Pots they had inclosed great Serpents, which, by the Holes, received Air and Sustenance enough to preserve them. These were to be flung into such Galleys as they grappled with. The fall of the Earthen pots on the Decks of the Enemies Vessels, would infallibly break them; And then the hungry Serpents being at liberty, would wind themselves about the Limbs of the next they could seize on: and thereby not onely hinder them from Fighting, but in a short while put an end to their Lives. This admirable, and cruel Invention, I commended, onely because 'twas to be imployed against the Detainers of my Princess; though in it self, I did not like it, esteeming it a Savage cruelty, to employ venemous Beasts to destroy the Lives of Valiant men. Soon after I had seen some other like Inventions, I retired to my own Fleet; and, according to the resolution taken aboard Ascanius , made all things ready to weigh Anchor with the Morning's light: which accordingly we did, (I having first left Orders for the Cilician , and Phoenician Fleets to follow me) And with Oars and Sails we steer'd our course to the Island of Scyros ; where, to my unspeakable Joy, the Day following, by that time the Sun was two hours high, we discover'd the two Kings Fleets, embatteling within the easie prospect of the Castle: and as ready to accept of the Fight, as we were to present it them. I soon perceived the Bythinian Flags composed the right Wing, which I was to Fight against; and the Cappadocian the left Wing, which Ascanius was to oppose. Elevated with the Glory of what I fought for, and before whom I fought; and troubled at nothing more than at the glorious Flagg which the King of Cyprus carried, I began the Battel: which I might truly say, was replenished with more various accidents, than ever any which was fought before. And though the Princess had the trouble to see her Deliverance was a long time in the Ballance; yet at last, she had the satisfaction to see the Pontick , and Bythinian Admiral ingaged singly: and, though Nicomedes did all that became a King, and a General, yet being himself sunk under the weight of his personal Wounds, I entred his Galley, and took him my Prisoner; though when I did it, he was by the loss of Blood, uncapable to see my Success, or deplore the want of his own. As soon as ever that Admiral Galley was conquer'd, all the rest of his Fleet confusedly fled to the Shore; in which Chace, we sunk many, and took more: and prosecuted our Victory as far as the water would give us leave. But the Success could not be more glorious on our left Wing, than it was deplorable in the right; for, on my Return to see, whether our Friends needed our assistance, I found the Cyprian , and Egyptian Fleets, as totally vanquisht, as the Mithridatick had the Bythinian : nay, I saw a Cappadocian Galley, carrying That glorious Flagg at her Stern, which a little before had adorned the main Top of the Cyprian Admiral. The fury I was in at that sight, carried my Galley with wings to so desired a recompense and revenge; and the Enemy, as proud of their prize, as I was inraged to see it theirs, disputed their purchase, with at least as much resolution, as that with which they had acquired it. The Fight was such, that even the winning of this Galley, cost me not less blood, and time, than Nicomedes's ; But at length she yielded, and presented me with an Effigies , than which, nothing to me could be more acceptable, unless the glorious Original. To recover that noble Trophy, was an honour which needed not to set it off, the Foyl of my Rivals having lost it. In brief, that large Scene in which the Battel had been Fought, was clear'd of all our Enemies, but five Galleys. For Ariobarzanes satisfied with his having done that to our right Wing, which I had done to his; and having been disorder'd in that Success, too much, to attempt the changing of mine: or else apprehending a Forrest of Vessels, which then began to appear, (and, which afterwards I found were my Phoenician and Cilician Fleets) retired to the Island of Scyros , and left those five Galleys I had mentioned, engaged against one single Egyptian Galley. Which, though it defended it self with much Resolution; yet I saw at last those in it, did not more deserve than need my assistance: I therefore hastened to afford it them. A young Gentleman of that Nation, and of the colour of those Inhabitants, in splendid Arms, so animated his, both by words, and by example, that in his Valour onely, the hopes and life of their party consisted. The Enemy observing my Approach, offer'd him all honourable Quarter; and though he was Courted by many civilities to accept it, yet he declined it, in words which testified his resolution, as much as his defence had done. And by that time I had joyned his Galley, I heard the end of the young Egyptians reply, which he finisht in these words; That it was an unavoidable Fate for every man once to Dye: but he did not think it was the like, for gallant Men once to yield. This generous Answer, in my judgment, made him, and his, the more worthy of my assistance; which I presented him with such Success, that he was soon in a condition to afford his Enemies those Civilities, which he had so lately refused to receive from them. By that time I came into his Galley, to congratulate his Success, and give his Valour those Ellogies it merited, I found him weltring in abundance of Blood, which he had drawn from others, and lost himself. The taking off of his Helmet to give him Air, discover'd a Face as remarkable for the noble features of it, as any I ever saw; and which, though black, and in the Arms of Death, retained Charms enough to make me admire it. I gave all my Chyrurgeons express, and repeated Orders, concerning him; and though I strictly examined all his Souldiers who he was: yet none of them would or could satisfie my Curiosity, protesting they had never seen him before that Morning, in which, by the Egyptian Vice-Admiral, he was put to Command that Galley, upon the Death of the late Captain of it. But, continued Callimachus , I doubt generous Princes, my concernment for this eminent Stranger has too long carried me away from the direct Sequel of my Relation; which therefore, (having begg'd your pardons for) I will re-assume, by telling you, that several of the Cyprian Commanders which had fled under my Flaggs, to avoid the Cappadocian King's Navy, assured me, that their own Prince was fallen Dead on his Deck, ere Ariobarzanes had taken him: and that his last words were, It more troubles me to lose my Flagg, than my Life. His last consideration being so worthy of an Adorer of my Princess, made me Celebrate his Fall, with a grief as real as great; and the obhorred Name of a prevailing Rival, hinder'd not my paying his Merits, the acknowledgments due to his Title, and Unhappiness. I offer'd all those Cyprian Commanders, to imploy my whole Fleet, to recover his Body; that those which could not Conquer him whilst alive, might not possess him when Dead: But they all assured me, he was past recovery, as well out of the Enemies hands, as out of the hands of Death; for they had seen the Cappadocian Admiral carry [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) him under the Castle in the Island of Scyros , the Cyprian Admiral's Galley, in which their dead King and General's Body was. This loss appearing past remedy, I went to inquire how the generous Nicomedes was; and how my Physician, and Chyrurgeon's care of him, had succeeded: but alas I still found him in that swoon, in which I had left him: and in so little hopes of Life, that hardly any misery had befal'n me in the whole course of my own, had been more intolerable or sensible to me. But those about him, either as it was their belief, or else to lessen that grief which his condition so visibly invaded me with, assur'd me, he was Alive; and that none of those Wounds they had sounded, appear'd mortal: so that his Escaping was not onely possible, but hopeful. And though these words were very welcome to me, yet the Gods were pleas'd to send me something else, which was much more; for even whilst I was under my fears of his Death, by a deep Sigh, and opening of his Eyes, he manifested he had Life. The eminent generosity of this Prince to all men, and the particular effects of it to me, which also were in some measure the Causes of his then Condition, gave me as high a satisfaction, as my sorrow for him had been before; both which, could not have been more sincere, and eminent, had I then known the Relation I had unto him. And because the motion of the Sea, and the small accommodations in a Galley, were incommodious, if not dangerous, to him; I forthwith sent a Trumpet on shore to Ariobarzanes with this Letter.  that to you, which now upon the score of your Generosity, I will hope for from you; and by sending to you the Body of Nicomedes , have expected from you, the Body of Ascanius : But the Gods having restored your great Friend to Life, and my best Physicians, and Chirurgeons, giving me more than hopes of his Recovery, I was unwilling to keep so welcome an assurance from you. I believe you will not esteem the Restauration of the Princess Statira , and the Prince Pharnaces , too disproportionate an exchange for him; I have therefore sent this Letter, to propound it to you: And because 'tis below the generous Ariobarzanes to detain the body of a dead Enemy, or receive any exchange for it, I will with Certainty wait for those effects therein, that his vertue will give me; which cannot be greater, than my esteem of it, and confidence in it.  I was necessitated, both to cloud my passion, and not appear too unworthy of Mithridates his trust, to add Pharnaces to the exchange of Nicomedes ; and onely to [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) maintain the name of my Princess, without particularizing those inducements, for her deliverance, which her innocence, her Beauties, and other admirable perfections, might have excessively furnisht me with. Whilst my Trumpet was going, and returning, I was visited by the Cilician , and Phoenician Admirals, who in such humble and moving expressions, evidenced their sorrow for coming some hours too late, That I was more troubled to console them, than I had been at their absence; which was occasion'd by an unhappy Difference had fallen out between the Chiefs of both their Countreys, which had already drawn some Blood: and they doubted would draw more, ere it was extinguished. Nay, they had not now come, but that a religious Person; who for being such, was eminent to both their Nations, represented to them, that whilst they strove about what was doubtful, they acted a Certain evil, by employing those Forces against each other which were mutually engaged to serve Mithridates . This being spoken from so reverend a Person, produced this effect, That they all unanimously engaged to perform their Contract, and to serve the Pontick King in his first Naval ingagement. But then by solemn oath, they tyed themselves the next day, to return whatever their success was, and to obey whatever their Superiors should enjoyn; who they hoped by this short Peace, would assume thoughts of a perpetual one: and by their Absence, might be invited to extinguish that flame, which their Presence did but kindle, and animate. That therefore they were come, not onely to implore my pardon, for their having been absent; but to beg my permission to return, that they might therein satisfie their oaths to their Gods, and their duties to their Chiefs. After I had acquainted them with my trouble for their absence, and for the cause of it, I began to endeavour to make them sensible, that even by their vows, they were confined to see one ingagement more; for this that was past, they had rather heard of, than seen, That our Fleets which had ingaged, were so shatter'd, that without their help, we could not continue the siedg of the Island, till it was reduced: which to effect, we were to imploy half of our number to transport at once the Prince Ataphernes's Army since to Land it in Parts, were to expose it to the Army there, who by that worst proceeding, might soon repair on the Land, what they had lost on the Sea. I did not omit to add to these Motives, all those others which I thought might ingage them; But pleading their Oaths to the Gods, and their Superiors, as soon as the first ingagement was over, and binding themselves to me by the most sacred vows they could make, as soon as their domestick differences were ended, by the Sword, or by Agreement, they would immediately return to Mithridates service, if called, and face the Island for five days before they returned: which was a competent time to transport the Prince's Army into it. Not being able to prevail for more, I accepted so much; and forthwith sent an express to the King, to acquaint him with our success; and at what rate we had bought it. I likewise imployed another express to the generous Ataphernes , with an account of all things; and how that in two dayes I intended to bring into the Bay of Nicomedia so many of his Father's Fleet, as would transport into the Island forces enough to conquer it: and that I would leave the residue of the Fleet with the Cilician and Phoenician Navies, to block it up in the mean time, that none in it, might get out of it, and no new supplies might be received into it. By that time I had formed these resolutions, and dispatched these expresses, the Barge I had sent with the Trumpet, returned; and he brought me this Letter.  Fleet. noble men, his Subjects, and my prisoners, had not begg'd it of me; that they might perform the Cyprian Funeral Solemnities due unto his Quality; and after that, carry it to receive the like obsequies in his own Country: for which end I have given them their own Liberty, and their own Gally, with my Pass to return to Cyprus , as soon as these intended Ceremonies are finished here, and that his Corps is Embalmed. I acknowledge your great Civility, in sending me news of Nicomedes being alive; which yet does therefore hinder me from being able to dispose of so considerable a Prisoner, as the Prince Pharnaces is: But for the Princess Statira , as it was alwayes against my will, she was detained (Women being neither the Cause, nor the Continuance of our War) so I shall willingly exchange her, and all the Prisoners with her, for Nicomedes . Who, I am confident, in your judgment, and in her Fathers also, will be a sufficient Ransom for the King of Bithynia , if he does not recover of his wounds: And if he do, you may with reason, expect from his justice without a bargain, what ever he esteems, this exchange will fall short of the value of his Liberty.  The Gods, continued Callimachus , onely knew my transports at the reading of this Letter; For had the King of Cappadocia demanded for the Princess, not onely Nicomedes , but also Callimachus , and the whole Fleet he commanded, he had in raptures of joy delivered them up to Ariobarzanes ; and esteemed that Purchase too low a Price for the honour of her redemption. I therefore immediately accepted of his offer on the Conditions he proposed; and having received his assurance of delivering the Princess on his receiving Nicomedes , I forthwith sent that generous King to the Island in his own Galley, least his removal might have been at once painful and dangerous to him: and as some small Evidence, how disadvantageous an Agreement I thought my Enemies had made for themselves, I cast their Admiral Gally, into the bargain; And I did with all my Fleets, accompany the King of Bithynia towards his Port. And having attended him, as far as with safety I might, and paid him all the Sea-honours I was capable of, which yet his Condition made him ignorant he had received, I then cast Anchor, and in impatiencies above description, waited for the Arrival of the Princess; to whom I had order'd the Fleets to pay submissions, and honours, which they never had before presented to any Admiral. Whilst this ambitioned happiness was expected in raptures due unto it, or rather short of it, I perused a Letter brought me by my Trumpeter from those two Cyprian Noblemen, to whom Ariobarzanes had given their King's Body; who therein did acquaint me, that the necessary honours due by their Laws to their King's embalming, would consume at least thirty dayes: by which time they desired, if any occasions called me elsewhere, I would appoint all the remainder of the Cyprian Fleet to be where now they Anchor'd, to receive their King's body, and to attend it into Cyprus to the Tomb of his Predecessors. My Trumpeter also told me, that he learned Ariobarzanes , having as totally defeated our right wing, as I had his left, had determined by a new Combat to have forced from me my success, or increased it; but that the then appearing of the Fleets of the Cilicians , and Phoenicians , which they knew was not for their assistance, they having then all the help they could expect. But chiefly the Cappadocian King's wounds which he dissembled till their effects then, reveal'd them, and a large leak his Admiral Gally had received, made him retire with the glory of that Victory, he had obtained over the Cyprians . That he had seen the Body of Ascanius , wept over by all his Subjects, which were prisoners, who in the greatest of their griefs, had evinced the greatness of their Loves. Whilst my Trumpeter was entertaining me with these relations, I perceived a magnificent Barge appear from the shoar. I concluded the Princess Statira was in it; and having drawn up my Fleet in a Cressent to receive her, leaving them in that figure, I advanced with my own Admiral Gally, to wait on her. And as soon as I saw she was there, I descended into my Barge; and in unconceivable raptures, went aboord hers: where casting my self at her feet, I did more by actions, than words, endeavour to show her my Transports at her restauration, and at my having been instrumental in it. She had the goodness to receive me with that Empire, and modesty, which still accompanied her highest favours to me; and having with acknowledgments dismist the Cappadocian , and Bithynian Nobility, which had till then waited on her, as Ariobarzanes , notwithstanding the pain of his wounds, had done, to the Barge, she ascended my Gally: and in it went to the Fleet, who received her with shouts and clashing of Arms, and all the other military evincements and complements of Joy. Nay, all the flagg-ships, struck their signs of being such, and onely let them fly again, when she commanded; to show, that she onely gave Laws, where I was Admiral. All Ceremonies of her return being ended, she retired unto the stern-Cabbin of my Gally; and none being present but Nerea , I did again prostrate my self at her feet, and told her: Madam, I now find the honour of fighting in your Quarrel, cannot be greater, than is the Certainty or success in so glorious a Cause; and if I failed of that happiness once, it proceeded from the mercy of the Gods: which though intolerable to me, when dispensed, yet by what hath happened since, I have found abundant cause to admire. But could I have [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) presented my highest misery, at so Criminal a Price as by wishing of your suffering, I should have esteemed that sin equal to this success; for such is the respect, and veneration, I pay the Princess Statira : that to have prevented her Captivity, I would joyfully, (had it been left at my Election,) have suffered what the Gods destined, her Captivity should prevent. The fair Statira by her blushes seemed to tell me she understood what I meant; and she had too the Condescension to give me this answer. If you have received any advantage by a Captivity you then so much deplored, and would have so fatally revenged, on him that had been so far from acting it, that he almost lost his life to prevent it, I shall find that contentment in it upon your score which I could not on my own; for 'tis but reason, that he who frees me from Captivity, should receive some consolation in my having undergon it: and that my sufferings should pay some of that debt, which my Actings could not. And since by experience you have Learned, that even the bitterest things which the Gods cast upon us, have by a patient waiting on them, a sweetness in the result, I will hope, that thereby we shall be prepared with an entire resignation, to submit to whatever portion they shall think fit to allot us. 'Tis in the force of this duty, that I find strength to submit to the loss of the unhappy Ascanius ; and though he perished for my relief, and though by designation of my Father, his neerness to me might apologize for my Tears, nay, render them a duty: yet so much I mind that hand from whence I received that stroke, that in as little emotions, as the frailty of my nature is capable of, I desire to submit unto it. At these words, said Callimachus , her fair Eyes were obscured, which made me say; Madam, in those admirable expressions, you do not more evidence your piety to the Gods, than by those unvaluable tears, you manifest your kindness and esteem for Ascanius : whose fall thereby is Celebrated with nobler obsequies, than all his friends, and Subjects can design for him. To be loved by the Princess Statira whilst he was alive, and to be wept by her when he is dead, are felicities, which render him a fitter object of Envy, than of sorrow; and since, Madam, you are so Charitable, and just to the dead, permit me to beg you to be the like to him that yet is alive, which is, to believe, though had I got as much by your Captivity, as the King of Cyprus lost: yet even therein I should have condemned your [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) fate, and my own too, for being so mistaken, as to think, I could raise [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) any joy, by your sorrow. In that particular, the power of destiny is limited; for it can present nothing of contentment to me, which is caused by your sufferings. Could you, Madam, believe the contrary, To lead you out of that iniustice (pardon the Zeal of that expression) I would elect Eternally to be miserable, rather than be made happy by a cause, which might confirm you in that misbelief; and might reproach me with having valued my self above you. But Madam, I continued, whilst I ought to imploy all my time in expressions of my trouble, that you were made a Captive, and of my joy that you are no longer one; will you pardon me, if I employ some of it, in imploring a concession from you, which onely can be granted by you; and which I fear you may with Justice, deny me. 'Tis that by your order I may enjoy a part of this dayes Victory, which by the Law of Arms is mine already; yet onely by your decree, can Authentickly be made such. The Princess again was cover'd with blushes, fearing my confidence had been greater, than my Success; and that my implorings would have been more suted to my desires, than my merit: therefore to free her from those wounding imaginations, I told her, by the fate of War Ascanius lost his Flagg, and by the chance of War I recover'd it. 'Tis the Effigies of a Venus ascending from the Sea; but a Venus so like the Princess Mithridatia , that no Production of Art, was ever comparable to it. I thereupon presented her with the King of Cyprus's Flagg, which contained a Copy, nothing but the Original could transcend. She considered it a while, more I believe to gain time to form her answer than on any other score; for her Glass could alwayes entertain her with a nobler prospect: though whilst she was unresolved what to say, she might the sooner be induced to grant my suit, than give reasons for denying it; and therefore I did with no small importunity, seek a return to my request; which at last obtained from her these words. I am wholly ignorant, Callimachus , of your Maritine Laws, but I suppose you are so just, as not to ask any thing from me, contrary to them; and since you are on that Element where you give the Law, I must not contradict what you assure is yours by it: though in my own judgment, I think it little Just, that two Fleets which came to fight in the same Quarrel, the misfortune of the one, should compose the Trophies of the other. Madam, I replyed (expecting at least as much reservedness as I found) 'tis not time, but possession which gives Armed numbers a Title to what they possess; else those which did wrong the longest, should have the greatest Right to what in wrong doing they acquired. And therefore the Enemy being a while possest of this Flag, Ascanius lost his Title to it, and the property was alter'd; which when it was our Adversaries, was both lawful for me to recover, and keep when it was recover'd. I know not, said the Princess, whether the Laws be not proportionate to the Element, on which, or for which, they are made, and therefore that being wild, those may be the like also, as best suted to it; and being received as such, Custom may authorize what reason could not; elss if the possession of an Enemy alters the property of what is possessed, and that this rule went throughout in all cases, (as what is reason in one particular ought to be the like in every other of a parallel nature) then prisoners of your side which are taken by an Enemy, if recovered by you, are prisoners also to you; and so the success of their Friends changes not their Condition, but their Masters. By this Law too, said the Princess smiling, Tomsones, Rebadates , and to say no more, even Nerea her self must be that to you, which your Valour and Civility have recently freed them from being to another; and thus make one of the noblest Actions of friendship, become in its effect one of the highest impositions of Enmity; and thereby make what should nourish, and increase friendship, totally destroy it; by this rule also Ariobarzanes must be Nicomedes's Prisoner, and had both those Kings been recovered by their Souldiers, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) that they must have been such unto their very Subjects. I must acknowledge, said Callimachus , this reasoning of the Princesses, did not a little [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) surprise, and her particularly specifying no higher than Nerea , with that smile which accompanied it, seemed to tell me, what she would not speak. I therefore made no small hast to tell her, there is, Madam, a vast difference between the exchanges, and acquisitions in War; that which is by [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) part, and agreement, relishing more of the Civil, than the Military nature, is exempted from these wild Rules, which force has imposed, and custom has authorized amongst Souldiers; besides, Madam, things which men may buy, and sell, and thereby may transfer the property of them, to the Master which last [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) acquiessed them, may well have that property transferr'd by the purchase of mens Swords, which may be transferr'd by common ways of bargaining. But Women, and Men, not being vendable, are not subiected to the like rules, that things which are so, are liable unto; for liberty being not to be valued, ought not to be sold, though it be lost; and so life, though it be above price, is not thereby exempted from deprivation: but Madam, I hope you will remember, that when I first moved this unfortunate request, I told you what I was to beg, was fit to be denied; and since I find the invinciblest Argument against me, is that of your not approving what I have implored, I here put a period to my sute, and change those Prayers which I made to obtain it, into as fervent ones for your pardon, that I durst desire it: onely Madam, I will earnestly beg that you will so dispose of it, that whatever has the glory to bear your Image, may never be exposed to the hazards of composing a Trophy to your Enemies; and for my particular, I shall find my contentment in my obedience, and in carrying about me an Image which much more resembles you, and which lies not in the power of fate to take from me. Statira receiving the Flagg which I then presented her, told me; though I know few things I more desire than to receive evidences that Callimachus is of my opinion, yet not to appear too unworthy thereof; and to owe that in some degree to his Justice, as well as to his Civility; I will onely mind him, that there are Slaves amongst men, and made so by no law, but force; but yet are bought and sold, as merchandize is; and though liberty to him that looses it, is above price; yet he that takes it from him values it to him that buyes it of him: Though things inanimate taken by force of Arms, become the property of those who take them, and are no longer so, to those that lose them; yet all such things are not subjected to that Law: for then the Images of our Gods, in which we reverence themselves, might by the fate of War become the property of men. 'Tis upon this score that I accept of this present; had it born any Image, but that of a Deity, I should have rejoyced at your possessing of it. But since it carries the Effigies of a Goddess you have formerly adored, in reverence to what she is in her self, and for what she has been to you. Allow me to restore her to her Temple, from whence I shall oblige all the Cyprians , by solemn vow, never to remove her; lest the needless exposing of their Goddess, may make their whole Island indure the like misfortune, which their unhappy King has been involved in; and whose fall I attribute to the impiety of carrying that power he worshipt, to a Forraign War, which should have still resided in her Temple at home. The piety of my Princess in giving me this refusal, and at the same time, consecrating her Picture to a Temple, the just, though undesigned reward, due unto it, gave me a full consolation, and made me admire the goodness of the Gods; that in the duty of taking their part, made her receive ever after her self, the oblations due unto themselves. For that noble Effigies being accepted of by the chief Commander of the Cyprian Fleet, on the terms the Princess prescribed, was by him sent unto Cyprus , aud in the Temple at Paphos , is worshipped unto this day. Yet Statira , to hinder as much as in her lay any glory, which her resemblance to that Picture, might cast upon her, Caused to be written over it in great letters of Gold. The Goddess Venus . The fair Mithridatia , having thus taken, or rather accepted from me, the highest prize of that day's Victory, did by many repeated Civilities convince me, that that Action proceeded from her respect to the Gods, and not out of want of it to me; so that I received more from her denial of what I had asked, than I could have received in the grant of it. I decline particularizing all those discourses which then past between us; mine chiefly consisting in the expressions of my Joy for her Deliverance, and hers in expressions of acknowledgments to me for it. Whilst we were making ready to Sail for Nicomedia , whither the necessity of Mithridate's Affairs did call me, as well as the restoring the Princess to her Father; I entertained with many embraces, Rebadates, Tomsones , and those other Gentlemen, to whose Valour and Friendship I owed so much; and having ordered the Cilician , and Phoenician Fleets, their Stations, for blocking up the Island, and residue of the Enemies Fleet, till with mine, I had transported the Prince's Ataphernes Army; I assembled the chief Cyprian , and Egyptian Commanders, and desired to know of them, what instructions they had in case of their King's death, which now was happened; and if they had none, what resolutions they had elected; in which if any assistance of mine were necessary, I might pay it them. They told me their Instructions were, in case that misery should befall them, which now had happened, never to stir from Mithridates's Service, till the Princess Statira was at liberty; and then to obey her Commands, whilst his Successor allowed them that Honour. This made me accompany them to the Princess, who was not [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) little surprised at this assurance; but having declined that power Ascanius had given her, and they protesting a perfect obedience to it. She told them, that she thought she could no way better use that unexpected Authority, which their dead King had given her, than imploying it in Orders, which might evidence the value and honour she had for him; that therefore they should keep about the Iland, till the Solemnities there, of his Funeral were ended, and then attend his Body to Cyprus , and obey the orders of their new King. This they all declared they would punctually obey. Having thus settled things, that Fleet which was to wait on the Princess, and transport her Brother's Army, weighed Anchor, and steerd their Course towards the Bay of Nicomedia , which the neerer we came unto, the more I found my Joys clouded; the high honour of the Pontick King's Alliance, and the higher of possessing the Princess Mithridatia , would, I knew too well, draw all the Eastern Kings to his Court; and thereby onely alter my Rivals, not suppress my Fears. Whilst I was entertaining my self with these sad thoughts in my Cabbin, which was under the Princesses, they forced from me such loud and violent sighs, that even Statira heard them; which perswaded her to send Nerea to visit me, lest some unexpected indisposition, might have ceised me. I was ashamed when Nerea came with this message, that my troubles had been so loud in their effects; and therefore, finding by her, that Statira was not in any entertainment, which my waiting on her might offensively interrupt, I went to her Cabbin, with Nerea , to apologize for the rudeness of my griefs, which yet had obtained the honour of her sending to inquire after me. I thought, said Statira , that the glory you had this day acquired, and the obligations which you have laid upon me, would have exempted you from troubles like unto those, which you have often assured me, my Captivity did only occasion. I observed when the Princess was speaking these words to me, that the motion of the Galley having disordered Nerea , she retired to a small Cabbin, at the door of the great one; which made me to kneel at Mithridatia's feet, and tell her; I confess, Madam, in the day of your deliverance I ought to entertain nothing but raptures of Joy, and that I ought not to admit of a grief, whose troublesome productions have even reached your Ears: judge, Madam, what my griefs must be, when in such an occasion of Joy, I cannot suppress them, nay, from coming to your Knowledge. Had they been confined to my own Breast, they would have acted that miracle, of becomming at once, the more great, and the more supportable; the giving of vent to Sorrow, which to others is an ease, in me is a sin: For my afflictions are of such a Quality, that they appear as great a Crime, as a Punishment to me; and could I tell the Cause of my sorrows to any, they could no more pitty, or advise me, than I can pitty or advise my self. Yes, Madam, the knowledge of what I ought to do, is not more evident than is the impossibility of doing it; I am necessitated at the same time to condemn what I act, and still to act what I condemn. I thought, and hoped, replyed the Princess, that since you could find by your own confession, even my Captivity a mercy from the Gods, which at first you had considered as their sharpest Judgment; you would in that past Event, have found wherewith to have raised your Faith in any other in the future; I rather expected you would have contributed to ease those sorrows, Ascanius's death hath rais'd in me; than add unto them, by acquainting me with your own. I could bring, Madam, I answered, but a few reasons to console you for the death of one, whose Condition has always had, and now does deserve, rather my Envy; than my Sorrow. That Generous Prince lived in your favour, and dyed in your Service; what life could be more happy; and what death could be more glorious? Do not therefore, Madam, I humbly Conjure You, expect that I should console You for that fate in another, which I ambition for my self; and if You are capable of such a condescention, as to Entertain a grief for either, bestow yours upon him, who aspires at no better a Destiny, than that, which even in another you think fit to lament: If he deserves your weepings, who had all that I wish; what then do I, who want all that he had, and wish no more than what he possess'd? You are, said the Princess, casting on me a languishing look, too-too ingenious to torment me; Ascanius's death which is my sorrow, you tell me is your Envy; And Callimachus's life, which is my contentment, you tell me is his Trouble. But O Gods! Callimachus , What new affections can those be, since I saw you last, which can raise such a storm in you? Madam, I answered, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) not new afflictions have befaln me; But onely a more clear contemplation of those I am already involved in: whilst you were in troubles, the duty I owed you, and the care of ending them, so intirely took me up, that I neither had the time, nor the will to reflect on my own; as the greater sorrow suspends the Actings, and Effects of the lesser: But now that the Justice of the Gods have put a period to yours; the same Justice, revives mine: For I have that sensible accession to my sufferings, as to be convinced, my Ambition does deserve them; And I think by the rest they have had, gathering new strength, they assault me with the more unsupportable Violence: Possibly in revenge, that having been so vast, I could so long neglect them. Alas, Madam, could you condescend to a thorough consideration of the causes of my sorrow, you could not but pitty, if not excuse their production; for what is there now for the unhappy Callimachus to expect? He has nothing which can be so much as acceptable by you, but his services to you; and those the height of your condition, and the lowness of his own, renders his hopes of paying, equal impossibilities: I am so far from the expectancy of Happiness, that I am not within the wishes of it; for though by the Crime of Fate, my Sword has been rendred serviceable to you, yet I cannot be guilty of the Crime, of wishing you may ever be reduced to a condition of repeating that misery, though I were certain of repeating that honour. You see, Madam, how desirous soever, I am to serve you, yet I am much more desireous you may never stand in need of being served by me; And even whilst by the sin of your Destiny, I derived an occasion to serve you, yet I shall call it the Sin of your Destiny; and the obligation it presented me, could not bribe me to call it by another Name: Nay, the sorrow that you were in captivity, silenced the Joy of my being instrumental to end it. Sure Callimachus , said Statira , interrupting me, you cannot notwithstanding all that you have said, esteem your self more unhappy, then you esteem me unjust; you first make me bad, thereby to make your Condition worse; Do you think your obligations are so small, and my sence of them the like, that unless you still present me with new ones, those I have already been loaded with, will loose their Efficacy; I am not a little pleased you have told me the cause of your Troubles, how wounding so ever they are to me, both upon your account and mine also; since thereby I find, in freeing you from being unjust to me, I free you from being the like unto your self. And in believing I need fresh and unintermitted obligations from you, you injure me as much as you oblige me by your favours to me: which are of a nature, that whilst I have life, I must remember them, and whilst I remember them, I must rather be troubled, considering my incapacity to acknowledge them as I ought, and as they deserved: that they are so many, than that they are no more. Your past Actions have hitherto obliged me in a degree, that nothing can equal, but the generosity with which they were confer'd, and the sense with which they were received; and for the future, what can be more obligeing, than after your evidencing your great concernment to serve me, you evidence a greater, that I may never be in a Condition to be served by you? By which it's impossible, but that I must still be obliged to your performances, or to your Wishes. Alas Madam, I replied, if my services be valued by you, how unhappy have I been, that I have pay'd you so few; and how miserable am I, that I can neither hope, or so much as wish, ever to pay you any more? I see your Goodness indeavours to repaire the deficiencies of my Fate; and finding I am never likely in the future to serve you, but in wishes, you would have me believe, that even those are accepted of by you; when that Condescention rather increases my debt, than any way lessens my Trouble: But, Madam, since by your Mercy, you seem not to be unmoved at my sorrow; and since it's above me, ever to cast it off, I will endeavour to cloud that, which I cannot conquer; and so confine my Afflictions to my heart, that I will keep them as invisible to your Eyes; as I have beg'd of the Gods, I could have kept that Adoration, which cannot be a greater confidence in me to acknowledge, than it was an impossibility to avoyd. Perhaps, Madam, I may not tell you a untruth, if I should assure you, that my Ambition cannot be more strange than is my entertainment of its punishment: For whereas in other Afflictions, it's a consolation not to deserve them; in mine, the contrary, is the only one I receive: for by the knowledge of the vastness of my Crimes, I derive some support in the enduring of their Punishment. For since all that I do suffer, nay all that I can suffer (if at least both those be not the same in me) is in my own Estimation, much disproportionate to the height of my aspiring; the Justice of the punishment, hinders me from repining at it, though not from being sensible of it; and the less you condemn my offence, the more just I esteem my sufferings, and the less impatiently I will bear them. Yes, Madam, though I know by attending you back to Mitbridates , I shall restore you to the capacity of repeating that fatal obedience for some other King, which the justice of the Gods, has punished Ascanius for soliciting, and accepting; and though by my waiting on you to your Father, I am like to see, what I most fear; yet I will go; yes, I will pay you my duty, though to the encrease of my Torment. But Madam, if some dejected look, if some unsuppressible groan force it selfe from me, pardon, I beg you, a Fault, which you cannot be so much troubled to see, as I shall be to commit; And asscribe all to a sorrow which possibly will not be above your pitty, since 'tis for having offended you, that 'tis so great, and unconfinable: Or else Madam, permit me rather than to be still a trouble to you, and a greater to my self, because I am such to you, to seek that death on some Enemies Sword, which you have prohibited my own, from acting; you shall then soon be convinced, that I have not so willingly offended you, as I am ready to punish my selfe, for having done so; and that nothing is more preferrable to me, than revenging of you. But fair Princess, if my sin be such, that your Justice decrees me rather to a lingring, than a speedy Death; and that you therefore condemn me, to see all those Kings prostrate at your Feet, which the priviledge Mithridates gave Ascanius , will invite unto that happy Posture: (For no Monarch, that knows the Princess Statira is to be obtained, but will fly to be that happy Person, that shall obtain her) If I say Madam, you destine me to this misery, I have destined my self to an entire submission to it; and I shall think my Torments, my happiness, if by undergoing the greatness of them, you may be convinced, my Passion, and my Obedience, are proportionate to your Beauties, and to the Duty I owe you. Though possibly, said Statira , this Discourse might as much trouble me, as the condition you apprehend your self in, does you; and that some parts of it might justly exempt me from answering any of it: yet to let you see, That your past obligations, and your present wishes, have that Operation on me which I even now assured you they had, I will not onely pass over, without any further notice, what you have spoke; but advise you too, not to afflict your selfe with antedated fears, which is, to abuse your Reason, and make that wound you which should help you. Our highest Prerogative so imploied, will make the condition of Beast preferrable to that of Man; They feel nothing but what actually is: and if you so injure that noble Gift, as thereby to sink your self below the State of irrational Creatures, 'tis but just, that even that blessing, should be your Tormentor. Ah Madam! I replyed, judge then of my condition, when that which in it self, is given for a Preservative against sorrow, and often a Cure of it, changes its nature, and becomes the cause of that, whose effects it should remedy. Reason, replyed the Princess, is still it self and therefore still a help; if ever it be other, 'tis in the abuse, not in the Nature of it. If by a consideratioin of things to come, I have more reason to fear the Ill, than to hope the Good, I have then Reason not to entertaine those considerations; and if it cannot hinder me from being miserable, when I must be so, it shall hinder me from being so, before I am so: Nay, after I actually am miserable, Reason leads me in to a contemplation of the Gods, who inflict the punishments, as well as they bestow the blessings; and who being just in all their ways, I am taught by it, to believe, I deserve what they impose; and therefore should with chearfulness submit to what they determine, especially, when by repining at what I must acknowledge, I deserve, (or else I must not acknowledge them to be Just, and to deny any of their attributes is in effect to deny them) I provoke the continuance of their judgments; and by an entire resignation I hasten their forgiveness. Possibly, Callimachus , I teach you the Theory of what I have practiced my self; and when I advise you to that which I follow, though you may suspect the advice, yet you cannot the adviser. Since, Madam, I replied, your goodness does not decline the condescension of giving advice to so unfortunate, and low a Person, as I am, permit it I beseech you to continue it's actings; and having told me what I should not do, that is, not reflect upon what is to come, and not express a sadness for what is, let it also tell me what I shall do. Wait upon the good pleasure of the Gods, said Statira , they know better what is fit for you, than you know what is fit for your self; and their Time is the best. But to fortifie you in the duty of this Attendance, remember That nothing can be more improbable in the time to come, than you have seen Acted, in the time that is past; and this also you may believe, if you please, That he whose Death I deplore, and whose condition you say you envy, had not more of my esteem than you have: and perhaps had not so many assurances thereof from me, as you have had. Let this suffice, continued the fair Statira , rising up, and Blushing; and if you have that friendship for me, that I believe you have, do not force me to give you such (I will onely say) uneasie evincement of mine. These words, said Callimachus , and the obliging Majesty with which they were spoke, charmed all my dispair, and my Tongue also; for I had not words to declare my thoughts, nor gestures to express the raptures of my Gratitude: which possibly yet might expose my acknowledgment to her apprehension in more lively, and significant Characters, than any other way they could have been exprest in. As soon as Statira was risen, she told me, I doubt Nerea will think, I am more concerned for your indisposition, than I should be, and less for hers than I ought to be; Let us therefore go, and visit her. Statira went immediately to her Cabbin, which was at the door of her own, and finding She was at most ease when she lay on her Bed, would not permit her to rise; but went her self upon the Deck, to take the fresh Air: and to see at what rate she hastened towards Nicomedia . As soon as we were come upon the Deck, an  Ægyptian Captain came close up to my Gally in his own; and told me, that the young Gentleman whose Vallour I had so much esteemed, was recovered out of his fainting, and was desirous to be carried to Nicomedia , to be cured of his Wounds: The Sea, and the ill accommodations on it, being not only troublesome, but dangerous to him. I forthwith stopt my Course, hoised out my Boat, and received the Valiant Stranger with his servants into my Gally; but the motion in his removal, made him again to swound: and Tomsones being present, calling hastily for some Vinegar, and chasing his Temples, and his Nostrils with it, he perceived the Blackness of his Face to vanish with the force of his rubbing and the sharpness of the liquor; and by degrees the whole coming off, he discovered a Countenance which even in the paleness, and disfigurings of Death, was not without Graces, and Charms, which merited an Admiration, The Princess Statira at so unexpected an accident, went to see this strange mutation; and while we were in the discourses of it, His chief Servant who was gone under the Decks to prepare a Cabbin for him, returned: and finding what Tomsones had done, exprest so much of grief more than astonishment, that we all concluded, he was not a stranger to that Disguisement, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) nor a little troubled at discovery of it; but his Master's fainting beginning to leave him, he carried him to his Bed. The night of this day I sent for the wounded Stranger's Servant, who called himself Photinus ; and desired him to acquaint me with his Lord's Name and Condition: and why he had assumed such a disguise? Photinus reply'd; I am Sir, confined to secrecie in all these particulars, by such Sacred Ties, That should I break them, I believe you would esteem my Obedience a greater Crime than my Disobedience; for which yet I most humbly beg your pardon: But this I will assure you, that his Quality, and his Merit is such, that you will not I hope repent your care of him; nor possibly when he knows how he owes you his Life, or Liberty, and your Curiosity to be acquainted who he is, will he decline satisfiing you therein. This answer made me press him no farther, and made me injoyn him to acquaint me from time to time, how his Lord did; and whether any thing was in my Power to serve him. I further desired him, when we came to Nicomedia , that he would carry him to my Appartment; where Lodgings should be provided for him, and all other accommodations. Photinus promised me all that I expected, and having made me many acknowledgments, went to pay his usual care to his wounded Master. The Continuation of Callimachus his HISTORY . day, discovered unto us the North-west Promontory of the Bay of Nicomedia ; and by Noon we were come so near it, that to our wonder we perceived several Horsemen quit their Horses: and with their Swords drawn, run into a Wood, in which Mithridates had made a Wilderness, and often delighted himself in visiting it. Remembring this, and seeing what I did, I told my apprehensions to the Princess, who was come on the Deck at this news; and though we could not imagin the Cause of what we beheld: yet the late Treachery that had been acted on her self, made me doubt something of the same nature might have been practiced towards the King. Which being her apprehensions as well as mine, I commanded, that my Gally should be rowed as near the Shoar as might be; and ordered all that Gallant Nobility, and Youth which was in it, to Arm themselves, and follow me. This was immediately performed, and our Boats had no sooner set some fifty of us on Shoar; but we were too well guided by the Shreeks of some Women, to the Center of the Wood; where we found all the King's Guards kill'd, or routed: and by one that was flying away, we learned, that about three Hundred select men had lain in Ambush in the Wilderness. And when the King with the Prince Ataphernes , the Queen, the Princess Nisa , and the Princess Cleopatra where diverting themselves in that pleasant Place, they were forthwith assaulted by unknown men; And the Guards running to their rescue, not being able to make use of their Horses, by reason of the thickness of the Wood, were after a brisk Fight, killed and dispersed; onely the King, and Prince, with some of their Attendants, getting into a Summer House, where the Queen, and Princess were, defended the door of it, in hope of relief: but he had even then seen it forced, and many of the Enemy enter it. This relation he told us, whilest we were running to their rescue; and least our indeavours might be fruitless, I sent forthwith orders to my Gally, which was advanced a league before all the rest of the Fleet, to make all possible dilligence to the Western part of the North-west Promontory, to hinder any Vessels from escaping that way: for the place in which this Attempt was made, easily perswaded me to believe it was from the Sea, that these enemies were come. These orders given, we continued our March with such speed, that we discovered our Enemies, whom immediately we assaulted; and who received us with that resolution which became men, that attempted their Designe. The Fight was bloody, and my small Troop being heightened by the glory of so Noble an occasion to evidence their Courages, did it in so unresistable a degree, that the resolutest of our Adversaries began to loose their Ground as well as their Number, though still fighting and retreating towards the Seaside. I easily judged thereby, That their intentions was to recover their Vessel; and therefore, by a resolute charge, we so discomposed them, that they turned their Backs, and made precipitately to their Boats: into two whereof some of them got, and immediately Launced out towards a Gally, which then we discovered riding in a Creek in the Promontory. The trouble we received by their then Escape, was raised to a height above my description; when by one of our Prisoners we learned that in the largest of those Boats they sent away the King, and Prince much wounded, and all the Princes prisoners. Twas time to Act, and therefore [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) thoug we had cause; yet we had not leisure to grieve: we [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) seize upon one Boat that remained, and persued after them, as well as four Oars could carry us, which were all we could find. But alas! we soon found how fruitlessly we labour'd; for before we could get half way to their Gally, we saw them enter into it, with their Noble Prize: and cutting their Cables, with as much hast as Oars and Sails could lend them, bent their Course for Greece . Whilest we were in the trouble of this prospect, I was revived by the sight of my own Gally, doubling the Point. Her Celerity in the obedience of my Orders was unspeakably welcome. I hastily got on Boord, told the fair Statira what we had done, and what we had failed of; and promising all the Slaves their Liberty if they overtook the flying Gally, they so powerfully plied their Oars, that we immediately found we gained visibly of them. The rest of my fleet, which were above twenty Furlongs behind, seeing me alter my course, and not knowing the cause of it; for though I saw the Gally I pursued, and my Fleet saw mine, yet by the interposition of the Head-Land they saw not what I chased: And having positive Order to sail directly into the Bay of Nicomedia , and none to the contrary, continued their Course thither; so that by the time I was gotten within half a league of the Enemy, they could discover no vessel was within two leagues of me; and therefore scorning to fly from a single Gally, saved me the labour of following them, and turning about their Prow, came as fast towards me, as a little before she had fled from me. Over-joyed with this unlooked-for Gallantry, I went in to the Princesses Cabbin; and told her, I hope now, Madam (telling her what the Enemy had done) to do you that service on the Sea, that I failed of paying you on the shore: and I am come now onely to beg you to permit the lights of your Cabbin to be stopt up, lest any Darts, or Javelings, of the Enemy, might fly into them. You see, Callimachus , she replied, how the sins of our Family, afford you too often occasions to oblige it; and you may perceive how fallacious even the best judgments are, in Humane things: when you could yesterday believe, I was in a Condition above your Services, and this day all the Royal House of Pontus , depend upon your Sword. The Gods, I replied, who have destined it to so high a glory, will I question not, give it a proportionate Success; and have onely permitted the Royal House of Pontus to receive some of their frowns, that it may be the more sensible of their smiles. They had rais'd it so high, that it being uncapable of accessions, they have subjected it to changes, and then to restaurations; that in those vicissitudes, the impossibilities of additions might be repaired. Your Virtues, Madam, are a security to your whole Family; and since I now fight to restore them, and to preserve you, to doubt success were to intitle me to a denial of it. The Princess at the end of what I had spoke, perceiving some blood trickle down from a wound I had received in my left Arm, had the mercy to lament it, and the condescension to take of a Ribband of her own, and to bind it up; which unvaluable Civility, was no sooner conferred, then Demetrius came to the Cabbin Door, to tell me the Enemy was at hand. I therefore hastily took my leave, and was scarce got at the head of my Men, when our Gallies [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) shoal'd one another with their Brazen Prows; and then as if it had, been by mutual consent, grappled so strongly, that nothing but Victory was able to unloose them: never possibly in so little room, was performed so great things; our numbers seemed equal, and our resolutions the same, which were to Conquer or to Dye. Twice they got into my Gally, and once oftner I got into theirs, which in the End proved fatal to them; for perceiving with how much difficulty we had purchast that advantage, we as resolutely kept it: and, so many of mine got in after me, that the Commander of our Enemies called Enastes , who was a Lord of Pontus , who was in highest esteem with Nicomedes , and his Vice-Admiral, perceiving since they could not keep us out, it would be difficult, if possible, to keep us from vanquishing them, now we were got in, with a lowd Voice called me twice by my name; and told me, Callimachus , There is already too much blood spilt on either side: but since that precious loss is not to be repaired, Let us prevent the increase of it, and Let thou, and I, decide the Quarrel. I was not a little pleased at this motion, which gave me an opportunity singly to do a service to my Princess and all her Family, which otherwise had been divided amongst so many, that my share of it, had been inconsiderable. I therefore told him, the advantage which my Friends have over thine, is already so visible, That in this Combate they have acquired as much Honour, as it is capable to present them. A farther progress may increase the number of the Dead, not the visibility of their success; and though thou esteemest it no unhopeful expedient, in the ruinous Condition to which thou art reduced, to bring the decision now to an equal number, which the Valour of my Friends, have reduced to an unequal one: Yet to let thee see, the justice of my Quarrel needs no advantage to end it, I accept of thy desire. Both parties at what we had said, suspended fighting; and mine having gotten the Prow of his Gally, and his defending the residue of it, we had close by the main Mast a Stage for our Duel, in which Enastes was as Unfortunate as Valiant: and after no inconsiderable resistance he fell dead under my Sword, oppressed with Wounds. I was sorry at his Death, for the obligation he had laid on me, by inviting me to the Combate, and by declining a further Flight. When he saw himself pursued, but by one Gally, all his Souldiers when he was vanquish'd, in the fury of that loss renewed the Fight with much obstinacy; and one of them seeing all was lost, resolved to accompany his own death with an Action which might take from us all cause of rejoycing at it: for running hastily to the Stern-Cabbin, where the Queen, the two Princesses Ataphernes and Mithridates were kept Prisoners, he opened the door, and in a furious Voice he cried out, King of Pontus , I must now be revenged on thee, for having so long usurped the Throne of the King of Bithynia ; and Thine, and thy Sons Blood, must answer for the Blood of so many of my Friends, as thine have spilt, and which but in this way I cannot revenge. This threatning was not more Cruel, than Friendly to those against whom it was made; for the warning it gave them, not only raised them from their Beds on which they were laid, for the ease of their Wounds: but also gave Monima , the Princess Nisa , and the Princess Cleopatra , leisure to put themselves before the King and the Prince; and by their shreeks to call for assistance, which admitted no delay. The Gallies being grappled, the sides of each of them touched one another; and therefore those Cries reached the fair Statira : who abandoning her Cabbin, came upon the Deck, and told me, Alas Callimachus , whilst you dispute my Father's, and Brother's Liberty, they are loosing their Lives. This advertisement made me fly to the Cabbin, and so timely, that the Monster in it having flung down all those weak impediments which had opposed him, had his Sword bloody with one wound he had given the King, and with another he had made in Ataphernes's shoulder; who being unable to stand to defend Mithridates , had generously cast himself on his knees before him: and with some of his Bed-Cloaths wrapped about his Arm, endeavoured in that posture and with that pitiful defence, to save his Father's Life with the loss of his own. The horrid cruelty of this Bithynian , and the admirable piety of this great Prince, gave such wings to my revenge, that they saw that Monster kill'd, before they saw him who did it; But as soon as I had lifted up the sight of my Helmet: and that thereby they discovered who had paid them so seasonable a service, I saw in Ataphernes's Countenance a Joy as great, that I had saved his Father, and him, as that they were so unexpectedly saved. Mithridates too, though much wounded, took me in his Arms; and in Elogies and Embraces testified his Joy, and his Kindness. The Queen in the raptures of this unlooked-for Safety, gave me Eminent marks of her satisfaction, and friendship; And, though possibly they might have been mixed with some other Ingredient: yet all was attributed merely to the Transports of their then Condition, compared with what so lately it had been. In the midst of this Noble entertainment, the Princely Statira came into the Cabbin. The sight of her, fill'd all that were in it with new wonder; for the King having in the cool of the Morning left Nicomedia , the Gally I had sent to advertise him of our Victory, was not then arrived: which had hindered him from receiving an Account of it. Mithridatia therefore told him of our Naval success, of the rate at which we had bought it; and how she was exchanged. The loss of Ascanius , who the Pontick King intirely loved, qualified not a little the Extacies he was in; and even in his Sorrow for the King of Cyprus , he evidenced how much he had esteemed him. But at last Mithridates thinking 'twas to be ungrateful to the Gods, to let one cause of trouble cloud so many causes of satisfaction, He wiped off those Tears he had shed for his intended Son-in-Law; and in embracing his Favorite-Daughter, seemed by that happy privilege, and posture, to know, and act a certain Cure for the deepest Afflictions. I therefore told him, Now that you have the Princess Statira in your Arms, I believe Sir, you will think your Civilities to Ariobarzanes whilest he was your Prisoner, were not misplaced; for but in the duty he owed her, and the retributions he owed you for them, he could not have made so unequal a Bargain, as to have exchanged a Princess above Ransome, for the dying Body of Nicomedes . And if I presumed to dispose of such a Prisoner, without your knowledge, I will hope for your Pardon upon two Accounts; The first is, his Wounds were so many, and dangerous, That had I sent for your Orders, he might have been unexchangeable, before I had received them. The second is, That having an offered exchange for the Princess, the Crime of afterwards permitting her so long to continue Prisoner, as must have been imployed in sending for your Commands, and receiving them, would have been greater, than the releasing her without them. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) These were my Inducements Sir, when I lay before the Island of Scyros ; but now I find, that the Gods themselves have approved thereof. For had I not done what I did, the Punishment would have equalled the Sin; for the Royal house of Pontus had now been, what the Princess lately was: whereas by her freedom, the Gods have acted yours, and made that a Consequence, or Product of this. Mithridates , though the Chyrurgeons were dressing his, and the Prince Ataphernes's Wounds, made me this Reply. You have, Callimachus , imployed that Power I gave you, so much to my Honour and Satisfaction, that your desiring a forgiveness is really a greater offence, than that for which you ask it; and to evidence you have not only obliged me to the height: but that I am sensible you have done so, I promise before the Gods and all these Witnesses, that whatever you ask of me, without any exception, I will grant it to you; for you have given me more than you can ask of me. And lest your Modesty might hinder you from asking, I injoyn you to ask; nay, by that Friendship you have for me, I command you to do it: But lest this Injunction, might be a surprise, I give you three dayes time to deliberate, that you may think of something worthy your mentioning, and worthy my giving. To convince you too, how fixed I am in this resolution, and how knowing I am in your Vertue, I conjure you make me no reply, nor excuses; and grant me this request, as an Evidence you believe, I will grant you yours. All the while the King was speaking these charming words, my Eyes were fixed on my Princess; and her Blushes thereat told me her Apprehensions were, I would fix my Request, where I had fixed my sight: But Mithridates having done speaking, to obey him, I only bowed my self to his feet, as an evincement both of my Joy, and Obedience. The generous Ataphernes diligently observed my Looks, and his fair Sisters Blushes; and had the goodness to whisper me these ravishing words: Your Eyes, Callimachus , have spoke your Request; and Statira's readiness seems to be no Irreconcileable Enemy to it: Leave the Management of your happiness to my care. I whispered to him this answer, 'Tis the Company, Great Prince, and not the want of resentment, that hinders me from prostrating my self at your feet, as some signe of my acknowledgments. My Fortune cannot be but glorious, since you have undertaken the care of it; And what I despaired of on my own Accounts, I will presume of upon yours. I will not generous Princess, continued Callimachus , particularize all the Discourses which then entertained the company; Only I observed the Princes Statira who in less services had honoured me, with her taking notice of them, did not so much as speak to me of this; which I durst not so flatter my self, as to Attribute to her intentions of giving me more lively and ambitioned Characters of her Resentment, than Verbal acknowlegments could be: But rather to her fear, That I would, by my request to the King, owe that to her Obedience which I could not hope for from her inclination, or justice; and thereby punish my offence, before I had committed it. To remove therefore from the observation of others, those disorders which such thoughts raised in me, I told the King, That all his Enemies having paid by their Deaths, the last Crime of their Lives, I came to receive his commands for his return to Nicomedia ; and how the Enemies Gally, and their dead Bodies should be disposed of: begging him to remove into mine, from the blood and noysomness of that, he then was in. He forthwith appointed all those dead Bodies to be flung over-Boord, That they might as he said, receive their Burial, where they had acted their Sin, and suffered their Punishment; and That if any one of them were alive, he should be brought to him, who should save him the sending of an Herauld to Nicomedes . The Gally being diligently searched, one Souldier was found; who having bloodied himself all over, lay amongst the Dead to avoyd increasing their number: But when he found they were casting his Companions into the Sea, he discovered himself, hoping the fury of the Execution was over. He was therefore brought to Mithridates , who told him; I thought thy King would have endeavoured to recover Bithynia , only by such Arms, and by such wayes, as he lost it: but since with the loss of his Kingdom, he has lost his Kingly Vertues, and imploys his Souldiers to surprize Women, and murther his Enemies after they are his Prisoners, Tell him from me, that by all the Gods, and the Sacred Ashes of my glorious Ancestors, if ever he comes into my hands, he shall suffer that Death, which it seems he had appointed for me. I give thee, he continued, thy life, and liberty, to carry Nicomedes if [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) timeing this Message; and I shall appoint thee a Vessel to transport thee to him. The trembling Prisoner, who expected Death himself, was so confounded with the assurance of life; and liberty; and at the rate at which he was to buy it, that he could not speak: and his silence being taken for his consent, the King appointed the Captain of my Gally to see him sent away from Nicomedia . The obligation I so recently had received from Nicomedes , and the high and just Value I paid his Gallantry, made me abhor this Oath, and Message; And therefore I began to move the Pontick King to consider, how much better it would be, to stop, than to send such a Denunciation. I represented to him, That if Nicomedes had given Orders to kill him, he had not been made a Prisoner; for it was easie to have acted the first. Therefore that his having been taken alive whilest Enastes Commanded his Enemies, and his being in danger of being Murthered, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) but Enastes was killed, evidenced that the first proceeded from Nicomedes's Orders, the last from a Souldiers despair; that the Noble usage the Princess Statira had received and the Prince Pharnaces does receive, were sufficient Manifestations how much a friend he was ever to Civility; and therefore could not be capable of a Sin so far below a King, That it was below a Man. Consider, replied Mithridates , whether one of Nicomedes's Subjects durst kill a King that was his Prisoner, had their Orders been onely, to have made me such; and had he not known that performance, intitled him rather to Rewards, than Punishments. To which I answered; Consider also, I beseech you Sir, that when that Monster was about to kill you, you were not likely to be his King's Prisoner, nor he himself ever to see his King; and therefore neither to receive Rewards or Punishments from him. Even that, said Mithridates , evidences the Truth of my belief; for 'tis not probable, that a Subject which endures Banishment for the Love and Duty he owes his Prince, and daily in his Service ventures his Life, would make the last Action of it a violation of his Commands. If he thought you should not be Victorious, how durst he have rob'd his King of such a Prisoner as I was; Nay, and believing what you believe, against his Kings Orders: And if he thought you would be Victorious, how durst he contrary also to those supposed Orders, have taken away a Life which he could not but know you would revenge by the loss of his, and all his parties. No, no, Callimachus , he was confined to what he did by Nicomedes ; and nothing but Obedience could have tied him to his attempts. Sir, I replied, even the unseasonableness of his attempts, evinces it rather an Action of despair, than obedience; no duty to reasonable men being greater, than the Duty to reason. His was a fury, and pardon me if I say, 'tis not fit to judge by the Rules of Reason, of an irrational Action: But if the contrary were allowable, I might say, he never began his villany, but when he was certain never to be accountable for it to his King. And since the designe denied him the hope of life, if your Servants had success; and that he was so confident of their having it, that he fled from the combat, we may well ascribe his Action to despair: and having failed of being Famous for succeeding in a bold attempt, he resolved to make himself so, for an impious one: The height of wickedness is not attained unto at once, but gradually. The attempt against your person being such, and Nicomedes in the whole course of his life, having never done what misbecomes a Prince, proves him free from commanding, or permitting such a Crime. 'Tis but a justice due unto the whole course of his Gallantry, to believe him free from one Action of the highest Guilt; at least Sir, what ever you judge him to be in your own thoughts, it will be but consonant to your usual Justice, not to condemn him till you hear him: you would not deal so with your meanest Subjects. Therefore I will believe you will not use a great Prince worse; if he owns the Action, he Authorises your intended Revenge of it: and if he denies it, why should you credit the despair of a Subject, more than the word and assurance of his King. Whoever, replied Mithridates , has the wickedness to Command such an attempt, will not want enough, to deny it; And though I have not a sufficient proof thereof judicially: yet I have as much proof of it as the Nature of the Design can, or will admit. Actions of Darkness are rather judged by Circumstances, than Proofs. 'Tis enough I am satisfied of Nicomedes's guilt, and the Oath I have sworn, is too Sacred to be recalled, or violated; therefore I conjure you speak to me no more of it. I was, continued Callimachus , silenced, but not convinced; and the King, whose wounds hindred him not from being able to go with help, led Monima out of the Gally he was in, into mine. The Prince Ataphernes supported by two, was able to remove thither, and the Princess Statira I led; But as if Mithridates's vow of granting me my request what ever it were, had a Magick Charm annexed unto it, I neither had the confidence to speak to her, nor she the condescension to speak to me. Rebadates led the Princess Nisa , and the Captain of my Gally the Princess Cleopatra . By that time we were moving towards Nicomedia , we discovered the whole Fleet making towards us with all the celerity their Sails and Oars could give them; for being come neer unto the Shore, they learnt how the King had been surprized, and therefore came to his rescue. Galatides assured me, that when I had doubled the North-West Cape, he thought I had rowed close along the Northren Shore; and that the darkness thereof, had taken away his sight of us, Else he had steered as I did: but as soon as they found their mistake, and learned the sad accident had befaln Mithridates , they flew to serve him, and follow me. The whole Fleet being met, Mithridates made a Triumphant entry into Nicomedia ; and to avoid the like hazard again, ordered a Fort to be built, at the end of the North-West Cape, where the Enemies Gally had concealed it self: and such of his Guards as had fled from his defence, he put to death in Torments. The Pontick King was no sooner come into his Palace, but the Princess Nisa cast her self at his Feet; and in Tears, and Prayers as moving as her Tears, besought him to permit her now, to accomplish her vow of retiring into the Temple of Diana in Ephesus , which his Commands only had so long hindered her from accomplishing; and she made use of the late danger he had been in, as an Argument to perswade him [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) to allow of one of that Family, to be constantly interceding with the Gods, for the safety of the rest, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) who had been so many times, and now so recently was indangered: but the King not denying her request, but only putting off the acting it for a season, so grieved her, that she said, since she was denied to fulfill her Vows at Ephesus , she was resolved to pay them to the Gods at Nicomedia ; and since she could not be allowed to go from a Court to a Temple, she would change a Court into a Temple: and from that hour so wholly confined her self to her devotions in the Palace, that she manifested no force can hinder a resolved mind from serving the Gods; and that they can be adored out of a Cloyster, as acceptably as in one. The Kings Wounds requiring his silence, as well as bodily rest, all the Company that waited on him, paid him the duty of retiring as soon as he was come to his Chamber; and the Queen, either to take from me the opportunity, and happiness of conversing with my Princess, or to evidence the delight she had in being with her, accompanied her to her appartment: where perceiving those sleight Hurts I had received, were still undrest, they united their Commands unto me to retire to have them looked after. This Injunction gave me a deeper Wound than any which their care was concerned for; But before the Chirurgeons visited me, I visited the Generous Ataphernes , who was inviron'd by Craterus , and such a great croud of congratulating Friends and Servants, that I was unable to obtain a particular entertainment with him. The best lodgings in my own Appartment, I had resigned to the  Ægyptian stranger of whom I than acquainted the Prince; who therefore enjoyned me to lodge in the next Chamber to his: which I obeyed untill the hour destined to rest, was come. Ataphernes received the unintermissive respects of his Friends and Servants; and when it was come, and they gone, I thought it too rude by my waiting on him, to keep him longer from it: and therefore withdrew my self into the Chamber designed me, where most of the Night, I had but too much entertainment. To make no request to Mithridates , [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) were to disobey him: to make any but that which I had not the presumption to make, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) were to injure my self: to beg to know of Statira what I should ask, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) were if she vouchsafed me any answer, certainly to receive one I wished not for; and which yet I must not disobey. To speak any thing to Ataphernes after what he had spoken to me, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) were to doubt he intended not, what he proffer'd, and promised; especially too, when what he mentioned was the only thing I could desire, and his mentioning it freed me from the guilt of having solicited him to so unjust an Action: and left me no other Crime, but not having declined what I acknowledge my self too-too unworthy of. After, having turned my affairs into all the postures my Reason or Fancy suggested to me, I determined it was best to wait the result of the Prince his undertaking; And if nothing could be acted by him before the hour limited by the King for me to make my rest in, then by a strict silence to evidence my request was of a Quality not to be spoken: and thus by not speking, manifest what only I could speak for, The succeeding day I paid my duty to Mithridates , who used me at a Rate, which might have assured me he would deny me nothing, but that alone which I feared to ask; And yet when I was going away, as [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) if I had read my apprehensions, to surpress them, he told me: Callimachus . you have now but a little time left to acquaint me with your desire, which again I protest before all the Gods, I will grant whatever it be. Nothing could have been more welcome than that repeated Oath, unless to have had it reiterated. After I had made my request, or rather after the Prince Ataphernes had made it for me, from the King's Appartment, I returned to my own; where I learn'd, Monima , and the fair Mithridatia , had sent two of their Gentlemen to visit me, and know how I did. All that afternoon Ataphernes was visited by Statira and Cleopatra ; for Roxana stirr'd no more out of her Lodgings: and towards the Evening Monima came thither. I do not acquaint you with the particulars of their discourses; for as soon as I found they consisted chiefly of those obligations they all had to me, and of the Frights and Dangers they had been in, I gave my self wholly up to contemplate my Princess: in whom appeared a sadness so visible, that some of the Company took notice of it; and then of mine, as a consequence of it. Statira to take them off from that consideration, desired me to give the Queen some news of the  Ægyptian Gentleman; to whom I gave in brief an account of his Gallantry in the Battle: and how fainting in his being removed to my Gally, in the absence of his own servant, Tomsones having cast Water in his Face, and rub'd his Temples and his Nostrils with Vinegar, the seeming blackness of his Skin had vanished; and he discovered a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) mean, that even in the paleness of Death appeared lovely, and therefore could not be but charming in a perfect Health. And though I had done what Civilly I might, to learn from his Servant, his Quality, and the Reason of disguisement; yet could I not make any discovery of either, he having been tied to a strict secrecie: But he gave me hopes, as soon as his Master was in a condition to do it, I might be satisfied in those desires from himself. All that generous Company after this short Relation, did express nosmall Concernment to know, who this stranger was; which made me promise them, That the next day (which my Chirurgeons had assured me, would be the soonest that he could be able without danger to discourse) I would endeavour to learn of him, that which every one of them seemed so intently curious to know. I was not long after called away from Ataphernes by Craterus , to whom the King had left the care of drawing to the Sea-side, so much of the Prince's Army, as was esteemed convenient to be landed in the Island of Scyros to reduce it, and suppress the King in it; Ataphernes's own wounds denying him the strength to undertake that expedition. I found by the Generous Craterus's diligence, that by the Evening of that day in which I was to make my request, all would be in a readiness to set to Sea. At my return to the Prince's Chamber, I found none in it with him, but the fair Statira ; [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and they were taken up in what they were discoursing of, That though I presented my self before them, yet neither of them took any notice of me: which made me retire into my own Chamber, imagining what was the occasion of their entertainment. I had not been long there, but the Ægyptian Stranger's Servant, came in to me from his Lord, to tell me, That being now in some degree recovered out of his fainting weakness, he begg'd me to oblige him with my company for a few Moments. I obeyed him, and was no sooner come to his Bed-side, Then he told me. I have learnt generous Callimachus from Photinus , all that you have done for me; how That by your generosity I live, and by your Civility I am now in this Place; I owe you so much, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) That to acknowledge to you my Obligations, and the sense I have of them, would have more endangered me, than the Chirurgeons tell me I may endanger my self, by so much, and so soon speaking. Generous Stranger I replyed, the Vallour you manifested in that glorious Quarrel in which we bore Arms together, and those fatal, yet noble Marks, you carry about you, of having so prodigally acted in it, confined me to those services, which are so much my debt to you, That they merit not your acknowledgments to me; Especially such, as while you give them, you prejudice the giver of them. I conjure you therefore, not to hazard a Life by an excess of Civility, which by what I have already seen of it, is too precious to let it be endangered on any Account; especially on mine. Though I know few things, the other replyed, which I more ambition, than to assure you of my acknowledgments, unless it be the acting of them; yet I should not, to have told you so much, been guilty of the confidence of inviting you to this place to have done it: But that Photinus having told me how desirous you were to know who I am, I have begg'd the honour of your Company, only to pay you that Obedience which his duty to me hindered him from; and thereby to convince you, by satisfying you in what is within my power, I would do it in all things, were my ability proportionate to my resentments. I shall, he continued, (having first made me sit down by his Bed side in a Chair which Photinus brought me) trust you with a secret, which is such to all the World, but to these in this Chamber; and which I will not beg you may be continued such, because you will find how requisite it is: and That will exempt me from the need of making such a request. My true Name is Auletes , my disguised is Achillas . I am by birth Prince of Æ gypt. Ptolomy my Father, who possessess that Kingdom, found from my infancy something in my humour or [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) mean, that made his Natural affection receive so large an Accession; that possibly never Parent loved a Son more than he did me. All that Education could conferr, 'tis my own fault if I received it not; and finding, my Proficiency in what was taught me, was as much his contentment as mine, It doubled my Inclination, and my Endeavours: but as soon as I was capable to endure Travelling, I had a longing to form my self by the choyce of my own Judgment, having first seen, and experimented whatever was most considerable in Asia, Greece , and Italy . This intention I communicated to my Father, but his fondness of me, made me receive a denial, clouding what disgusted him, with an assurance that it would disgust all Æ gypt ; who having no Prince but I to succeed, he would not expose me to the hazard of Travelling in remote Countreys. I would not disobey a Father, to whom by Nature and Frienship I was so bound; and though I paid him an actual observance, yet I could not hide my sorrow for his denial: the visibility thereof, though it could not produce what only could end it, yet it made Ptolomy seek out all those divertisements for me, which he thought might mitigate it. Alexandria was therefore fill'd with all things which might invite me to esteem it, a more agreeable residence, than any else I could elect; amongst other things, the greatest Gallery in the Palace was furnished on one side, with the Pictures and Stories of all the great Men, and Women of our Family, from Lagus to my Father: and on the other side, with the Pictures of all the considerablest persons of either Sex, in that Age in which we live. And because Ptolomy found, that in this Room, and Furniture I took most satisfaction, he built another Gallery, which he intended to imbellish with the like Ornaments; and therefore imployed skilful Painters into the most eminent parts of the World, to Act and Design: who performed so well [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) what they were imployed about, that when those sent into Asia were returned, they boasted the Furniture of the new Gallery would much transcend that of the old: But above all the rest, The Artist which had been at Heraclea publickly avowed, that the piece he had drawn of the Princess Statira , had nothing comparable to it but the Original. It happened at the same time, the Prince Ascanius was then in his Travels, visiting Ptolomy's Court; for his Father had permitted that to him, which mine had denied me. He exprest a curiosity of seeing what was so much commended, I waited on him to satisfie it; and having considered with much intentness all those pieces which adorned one side of the Room: at the last the picture he was so impatient to look upon, was showed him. I never saw any surprize like unto his, even at the very first sight of it; and after he had a while contemplated it in silence, he brake it off, to ask him that drew it, Whether Statira owed nothing to his Pencil? Yes, Sir, the Painter replied, She owes a Pardon [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) for it, for having done so little, where I should have done so much; for I could never get any opportunity to draw it, but when the Princess was at her Devotions: and then too, but by stealths, and in imperfect lights. I must acknowledg, He continued, that till I saw her, I believed I could produce a greater Beauty than Nature; for by my skill I could make a Collection of all the exactest parts of every Woman, and draw them in one: so that Nature, whose productions are subjected to a Thousand casualties; and who cannot repair the least, if it happen, which is an infelicity the Pencil is not confined unto, I did esteem my belief was rational: But when I saw the Princess Statira , and began to draw her, I found experimentally she had an Air, a Vivacity, and such a Harmony, springing from the result of all her Motions, and Graces, that I owned my self a Convert, and must own her above the faint representations of Art. And therefore I have endeavoured by my words, to draw her better than I have done by my Pencil. All the while this Artist was thus speaking, methought I saw Ascanius receive Love by two senses at once; and indeed he was so wholly taken up with what he had heard, and seen, That I think he had not stirr'd out of the Place all that day, had not he been summoned thence to a Ball, which only waited his coming to be begun: And though he danced in it, yet it was with a face so full of thoughts, and so little like unto that, in which in former ones he had assisted, that the effects were not more visible to Ptolomy , and all the Court, than the cause was to me. Seven Dayes he continued at this rate, and the eighth a Cyprian Lord brought him the news of his Father's Death, who dyed of an Apoplexy; And the desires of all his Subjects by his presence to repair that loss, and fill the Throne. This sad, and hasty Summons, accelerated his return to his Kingdom; from whence he sent Ambassadors to obtain Mithridates's permission, of making his addresses to that admirable Princess. His going thither after he had obtained that leave he so passionately ambitioned, his loosing his Brother in a Naval Battle against the King of Bithynia and on the day of his intended Nuptials, loosing another within the prospect of Nicomedia , and his liberty also, The Princess being carried away by the Treachery of some of the Inhabitants, and his Exchange for the King of Cappadocia , are better known to you than to me. I have therefore only to add, That he being ingaged by three the most powerful Motives to repair his misfortune, Those of Love, Glory , and Revenge , he left no means unattempted to assemble a Fleet powerful enough to act his desires; and because the Cilicians , and Phoenicians , were pre-engaged in the service of Mithridates , though in the same Warr: yet coveting as much to end the Warr by his own Forces, as to have it ended, he came himself to Ptolomy to desire his permission to form a Fleet of his Subjects, which more through my perswasions, than his own, he procured leave to do. The growing greatness of the Romans , and the Universal Government of the World which they aspired unto, making it the Interest of all Princes to oppose them, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) had not resolved to submit unto them. I had too a particular Interest of my own which ingaged me to joyn my request to Ascanius ; for I desired to Command this Fleet in this Action: But the First Motion I made of it to Ptolomy , I found the impossibility of it's success; intending therefore to do that by stealth, which I perceived was not otherwise to be acted, I seemed not much concerned in the refusal, to take from my Father the Jealousie of my intentions. As soon as the Fleet was formed, without acquainting any Person living with it but Photinus , no not the Admirall lest his knowledg of it might have been penal to him in Ptolomy's resentments, disguising my Face, with a Colour as black as any  Ægyptian's, I went on Board the Gally of the Vice-Admiral, who was a particular friend to Photinus ; and who in the first Fury of the Naval Battle being killed, I assumed his place: and had no other Honour, but a while to fight single against some of the Enemies Gallies, and to avoyd being made a Prisoner by Part of a conquered Fleet. But I owe the avoyding of that unhappiness to your Civility and Courage, which I can in no way requite, but in owning it to all the World; and in assuring you, That what I owe unto you, I will on all occasions imploy and hazard for you: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and so in acquainting you, that my chief Motive to this voyage, and disguise, proceeded from a passion I had assumed at the Noble and high Character which Ascanius , when last in Ægypt, gave me of the Princess. At this very word, Continued Callimachus , the Prince of Æ gypt's senses abandon'd him; which made Photinus , and I, hasten to afford him all the help we could: but finding ours was not proportionable to his necessity, we called in the Physician and Chirurgeons, which were in the next Room; who having done all that their Art suggested to them, desired us to withdraw, and to leave him to that silence, the breaking whereof had cast him into that faintness. Photinus , and I, observed a little before, that his words came more languishingly from him, then when he began his Narrative; But both of us attributing it to the sense he had of his being reduced to need my assistance in that Battle, in which he had promised himself so much glory, we did neither of us desire him to forbear prosecuting his Relation, till the swound he fell into, put a period to it. I was not a little concerned to ask of Photinus one word more, than his Prince had spoke; But he protested to me, that was as great a secret to him, as it was to me. He only knew that as Ascanius had fallen in love by the sight of a Picture, his Prince had assumed the same Passion, by a Relation of the King of Cyprus ; but who the Object of his Passion was, he was a perfect stranger unto. Photinus having accompanied me to my Appartment, returned to pay his Duty to his Prince, and left me in no small perplexities; which had he spoke one word more, might have been increased, or supprest. I was not without my Fears, that the Princess Statira's Beauty had ingaged him in this Voyage; for since the Description which had kindled his flame, had been made by Ascanius , 'twas but too likely he would most exalt that Perfection, which in captivating him, had evinced it self to be the greatest, as well in truth, as in his Estimation. Neither could I believe, that the fear of speaking the Truth to Auletes might have any operation on the King of Cyprus in raising him so dangerous a Rival; since he had already ingaged Mithridates , and secured his raptures to a degree above the apprehension of Danger. I was too the more confirmed in that belief, by reason that Auletes kept himself disguised to Ascanius as well as any other; which sure he had not had much cause to do, if his Aimes had not been such, as necessitated him to such a proceeding: for if his Love was paid to any else, he might expect from the King of Cyprus's assistance, a powerful help; which by his not discovering himself to him, he was certainly to fail of. This consideration left me abundant cause to believe, my apprehensions were but too rational; and therefore in Auletes's Person and Quality I found cause to think Ascanius had raised me as powerful a Rival as himself: and I remained only with this consolation, That by Ataphernes's favour, I should know my Fate, before the Prince Auletes could be an obstacle to the felicity of it. With these thoughts I went to wait upon my Prince, who though I had left in his Bed; yet I found [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) him in his Chamber. Some of those Gentlemen that waited on him in it, telling me he was gone to Mithridates's Appartment in no small pain, I fear'd I was the cause of this trouble; for the time of making my request was to end the next day: and he had undertaken my Destiny. I learned also, That all that time I had spent with the Prince of Æ gypt , He had entertained in private the Princess Statira . I resolved therefore in his Chamber, to expect his return, which I did in impatiencies, and fears, that were almost equal. I never had been in such troubles. When I was Ignorant to what the Gods had reserved me to, and when I thought they had allotted for me the deepest Affliction as now I was in, when I was positively to learn what I was designed unto, My entertainments on this subject were so confused, and irrational; that I will not trouble you with a repetition of them: neither did they cease, till the Gentleman came from Mithridates to call me to him. I found the King of Pontus in his Bed, and the Prince Ataphernes sitting by him; as soon as I came in, the King commanded every one besides to withdraw: then calling me to him, he told me. Callimachus , you may conclude it was an important Affair which made me send to my Son to come to me, considering the indisposition he is under; and to let you see I will have nothing in reserve for you, I will now communicate to you, what I have imparted to him: for owing all that I have to you, I wil conceal nothing from you. There is at this hour in this Palace, three persons disguised, who have brought me strange News; and presented to me Glorious offers: they are all three Romans . The first is Martius Varius , Lieutenant-General to the Great Sertorius ; the other two are Lucius Mannius , and Lucius Fannius , Senators of Rome , and Cabbinet-Counsellors to Sertorius . They assure me, the Gods by an immediate judgment of their own, have taken out of this World my only dreaded Enemy, Cornelius Sylla ; which has filled not only Rome , but even all the Roman Empire with such high confusions, as every one is now striving to diminish that entire greatness which so lately every one endeavoured to augment. Sertorius has already appropriated to himself all the Kingdoms of Spain , and raised so powerful an Army there, and of his other Confederares; as even at that distance, the Capitol does tremble. He has got together so many of the Senatorian. Order, that he has already constituted a Roman Senate in Spain ; and disowns any Senate but that: so that he has not alone the power, but the Authority of the Roman People. He intends immediately, to carry his Ensignes to Rome it self; and wants not Friends and Confederates there, nor at the East and Western feet of the Alps : so that he is not only confident of an uninterrupted passage thither, but of success, and victory when he comes there. Yet to expose his attempts to as little incertitude as actions of War can admit, He has sent to invite my assistance; assuring me, that if my Forces from the East, and his from the West, do unite in one common Design, the success cannot be more great than it will be certain: But then we must move at once. He offers me for my Part, and to confirm it by a Decree of the Senate, That I shall for ever without acknowledging any thing to Rome , possess Asia so properly called, Bythinia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Comagena, Pamphilia, Phrygia , and Galatia . He desires to oblige me to this, That if he needs my Armies, or Navies, I must afford him their help under his Pay; and offers me if I need his, he will afford me them under my Pay. These Proposals I did but this morning receive, and have accepted of them; only I have insisted upon this Addition of having into my Portion the Republick Cities and Countries of Greece , that Asia may have another Sea, and Bulwork, between Italy , and it. This they have not a Commission to grant; But rather than not conclude the League, they have assured me of their utmost endeavours to have it granted by Sertorius and the Senate with him; or something else equivalent to it in my own esteem, with which I have declared my self contented: and this Night I am to signe that Agreement, which is to make Sertorius Lord of the West of the World, and me of the East. We must therefore divert to a Nobler End all our Preparatives for the reduction of Scyros , which will be as a consequence of our other successes; and if attempted now, would probably hinder us in one Moon, from greater advantages than it can ever present us. I have therefore designed out of Ataphernes , and Pharnaces Armies, to compose two others, which I will strengthen with great recruits, that shall meet them on their March; and a small Army drawn out of both, shall under Craterus attend my Person, and secure Bithynia , which I find is so ready to revolt. To Ataphernes I have designed the conquest of Paphlagonia , and Phrygia ; to Callimachus I have designed the Conquest of Galatia , and Pamphilia : And because I will not alwayes be obliged by him, and never oblige him I now require him to make his request unto me, which I again vow before all the Gods, I will grant him. Mithridates at the end of these Words paused a while, and having then twice commanded me to speak; and I as often looked upon Ataphernes , but not answering, the Pontick King thus continued: Since Callimachus , you will not make me a desire, I will make you an offer. Your Friend here has acquainted me with that great and respectful passion which you have for Statira ; your not making her your request, tyes me to make her my grant. I do therefore not only give you my permission to solicit her affection; but, I will also injoyn her to give it you: and if I mistake not, she has obeyed some Commands of mine with more repugnancy than she will do [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) this. Judge, Generous Princes, Continued Callimachus , Judge if ever any Astonishment could equal mine; if ever any Raptures of Joy could come near those I then resented. I cast my self on my Knees by Mithridates his Bed; and having kissed his Hand with transports, I told him; I confess Great King, I confess, That the first hour I saw the Princess Statira , I ador'd her: but it was with an adoration like unto that we pay the Gods, who while we yield them all our services, we expect no return, or reward but their acceptance. I found the impossibility of expecting more, could not transcend the injustice of desiring more; and having placed such Religious Limits to my Flame, I thought it not unworthy of her; and therefore continued the duty of it: But this you have now condescended to mention, is so infinitely below her, and above me, That to make any other use thereof, than to admire your goodness, were almost as highly to injure it, as her. No, Sir, my Passion and Ambition, have not so much blinded my duty and my reason; as to accept of exalting my own Felicity, on so criminal a foundation, as the making of you unjust, and her unhappy. If your intention be to confine me eternally to your Service, the Offer, more than the Acceptance, will do it; for in that, I have already received too vast a reward, both for what I have, and for all that I can do: But in this I should be as guilty as happy; and the way would be destructive to the end. I have by your mercy a double Glory, That of the Offer of the Princess, and That of having in duty adjudged my self unworthy to accept it. I can now convince Her, as well as the World, and my self, That my adoration was as perfect as it was great; and being free from those common and mean ends which other passions are animated with, I may in the future with the more satisfaction pay her mine: and she with the less reluctancy receive them. Rise Callimachus , rise, replyed Mithridates ; whilest you thus plead against what I offer, you but the more entitle your self to it. Besides I hope you will allow, That no man is a fit Judge in his own case; and That a Father has the best right to dispose of his Daughter. This being granted, as they can hardly be well denyed, I command you to dispute no more against what I have as rationally, as resolutely fixed upon; and because that either Nature, or the Ignorance of your condition has denyed you a Crown, and That I never designed my Daughter to less, I give you an Army to Conquer Galatia and Pamphilia : and I give those Kingdoms to you, and your Heirs for ever, to hold of the Crown of Pontus ; and wanting of Heirs, to revert unto my successors again. But because Statira was so near being Ascanius his Wife, That meer decency will require she should for some time decline actually marrying another; and That I would not by a delay make any suspect, my intentions to you, are not as clear and sincere, as my professions: to answer these two ends, I declare that the twentieth day, after this, you shall solemnly be contracted before me to Statira ; and as soon as by your Sword, you have made your self Lord of Galatia and Pamphilia , and thereby prepared a Throne for her to sit in, you shall publickly marry her: and govern there as King, with the limitations I have mentioned. Ah! Sir, I replied, since you Command me to dispute no more, I will obey you; and in that obedience I hope you will be convinced of mine in all things else: for doubtless never man had at once so much Reason to be ravish'd with Joys, and so little Title to them. For to be the Princess Statira's Servant by your commands, and consequently by her permission, is a Glory above the Empire of Galatia and Pamphilia ; nay, of the whole World: But by what you have done, you have so transcended all that I can express, that I must not onely be obliged to you for my happiness, but also for believing, my sense of it is at once as great as it can be, and yet less than it should be. Alas! Mighty Prince, Why do you confer Felicities on me which have no Limits, and command me services which have such narrow ones. I am but to conquer Galatia , and, I am to be the happy Servant of the Princess: rather Sir, Command me to carry your Ensignes to the Capitol; and cast that proud Senate as low by your Arms, as they have exalted themselves by their own. Command me to make her Empire as large as her Title is to Empire; and then you shall see, I will present her with that of the Universe, or perish in the duty of attempting it: and thereby gain what she is worthy of, or loose him that is unworthy of her. I do not, replyed Mithridates , end your Victories in the conquest of Galatia and Pamphilia , I do but begin them there; Comagena is the next Country to which you shall carry your Conquest. And possibly by then, new Objects may be presented to your Valour; and the occasions of Glory will proportionate your desire of it. Retire your self now, Callimachus , and leave Ataphernes with me; for Statira by my appointment, is coming hither, that I may signifie to her, what I have acquainted you with. This command I obeyed, but before I did so, I again cast my self on my Knees by Mithridates's Bed-side, and kiss'd his Hands with such transports; that he told the Prince when I was gone, in those Actions, he read my resentments, as visibly, as in all my other expressions. I was not many steps out of the King's Chamber, when I met the Princess Statira going thither; who asked of me, Whether I then came from thence? I told her I did. She inquired then of me, Whether Ataphernes was there? I told her he was. She then demanded, Whether I knew what the occasion could be, which made her Father send for her Brother, in the unfit condition he was in to stir out of his Bed; much more out of his Chamber? and, Whether I knew what She was sent for about? Yes, Madam, I replyed, with a deep sigh, twice repeated, I can answer all your demands; but 'twill be less unfit you should receive an account of all those questions from the King, than from me. But yet, Madam, to obey you as much as I can, I will presume to tell you [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) that you are even now sent for, to be either the most disobedient, or the most unjust person living; and I have endeavoured to prevent your being either: though you are too likely, only to find thereby, that your being made so, is rather an effect of my Obedience than solicitation. By this time we were come to Mithridates's Chamber-door, where Statira saluting me, with no little trouble in her Countenance, went in, and left me, to pursue my first intention of going to Ataphernes's Appartment; there to wait the result of her attendance on the King. I had not above halfe an hour entertained my self with the felicities of my then condition; but the Prince was brought back to his Chamber: and immediately being put to Bed, he commanded all his Servants to leave him and I alone. The Room was no sooner emptied, than I I cast my self on my knees by his Bed- side; and there in innumerable Actions and Words, endeavoured to assure him of those resentments, which were above demonstration. He had the goodness to embrace me, and to assure me though he had done all he could; yet he had done too little in proportion to the friendship he had for me. He then was pleased acquaint me, how Mithridates had disclosed his pleasure concerning me to the Princess; how he had particularized all those services I had done for him, and had paid to her; how Miraculously her intended Nuptials had been broken off; and how when Ascanius was released she was a Prisoner, and when she was released he was defeated and kill'd: All which seem'd to evince the Gods, were not more concerned in interrupting that marriage, than in my services, They seem'd to designe me alone to that Glory. That he neither would nor could oppose what was so declaredly their wills, and therefore whatever my extraction was, my Actions and his Bounty had made me worthy of, and should make me possessor of a Crown; and consequently not unfit for her Acceptance, or his Alliance. That therefore he did not only desire her to receive me, as her intended Husband, but he enjoyned her to do it; and that the more positively because she was not ignorant who I was, and that my preceding services had given me no small Title to the subsequent honour he designed me to. I tell you in brief, continued Callimachus , Generous [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Princess, what the obliging Ataphernes told me at large; But when he began to relate the Princesses answer, The confidence I had in her exact obedience to her Father, in her unequalled affection to her Brother, and in that glorious assurance when she was to marry Ascanius , which she gave me in these never to be forgotten Words, I Attest the Gods, had they made me the distributer of their Rewards, I would place Callimichus, in whatever he ambitions, and that without any Reservation , could not secure me from a Fear which invaded me with Confusions; and those in such excess, That the Prince taking notice of them, interrupted his relation, to enquire of me whether I were ill. I told him I was, and till I knew what the Authress of my Fate, had decreed of it, I should be in horrors whose visible Effects were the least uneasie part of them. I will then, replied Ataphernes , hasten to free you from sufferings in which I sympathize, by telling you that after Mithridates had done speaking, Statira continued silent for some time; which made him say, I will not so much doubt your Obedience, as to think I need a verbal assurance of it. I know you pay me an exact affection and duty; and I have enjoyned you by both those to observe what I have signified to you. Within Twenty dayes my Army designed for the Conquest of Galatia and Pamphilia , will be moving, and before Callimachus is at the head of it, I have resolved to contract you to him, and when he has subdued that Kingdom, to place you and him in the Throne thereof, Mithridates having done speaking, turned himself to me and told me Ataphernes I doubt I have too long detained you from your rest; to which now you may retire: I leave it to your care to perfect with your Sister. What I have so far advanced for your Friend: I did therefore cause my self to be carried hither, and desired Statira forthwith to follow me, which she assured me she would, I believe she will be immediately here, therefore I would have you withdraw into the next Room, and as soon as I call you, to come hither again, for I am determined before I rest, to make my Sister give you such assurances as shall leave you no grounds to doubt of her Obedience to Mithridates , her Friendship to me, and her esteem of, if not affection for you, I was going again by new evincements of gratitude to shew him some sense of my Resentments: When I heard the Princess coming, I did therefore hastily retire into my generous Friends Closet which was Contiguous to his Chamber, and had no sooner shut the Door than Mithridatia came to her Brothers Bed-side, he commanded all out of the Chamber, and to let none come in till he Called. The Closet was so near the Bed, That I heard Ataphernes thus discourse to his Sister. The Continuation of Callimachus his HISTORY . permit Callimachus his Addresses, and I have received a Command from the King to see that finished which he has begun: though the distemper of my body needs sleep, yet the satisfaction of mind does more need the placing of my Friend in a Condition above the Reverse of Fortune. I am uncapable of my Rest, till you have established his, by such assurances as may convince him you are not insencible of your duty to your Father, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) if your friendship to your Brother, and all his services to you, and your Family. I confess Brother (the Princess replyed) in the whole course of my life, I never was more surprised, than at the command my Father laid upon me, it was the least of my expectations, not that I think any thing in his Power, was too great a reward for what he owed Callimachus , but that he could think I was a sufficient one. And that with one of the unworthiest of his Family, he could design to pay the Debts of all of it. I shall also confess I am not a little troubled at the Injunction, not that I do not preferr your Friend above any Man, but that I preferr a single life before any other, both as it is most proportionate to my Nature, and that by it, I may be still in a condition to live near Ataphernes , in whose company and Friendship I have established my higheh satisfaction. I can, (replied Ataphernes ) make you the like assurance; for 'tis in your Friendship and company I take most delight, and therefore in order to that end, I am the more concerned in the success of what I now sollicit. You know Pharnace ; is to succeed in all Mithridates's Kingdomes, and you know how little I am to expect from his Friendship when he comes to the Power, your being settled in Galatia will be a safe, and happy Retreat for me. And with you and Callimachus I can enjoy a contentment preferrable to all my Fathers Empires, 'tis therefore that by thus disposing of your self, you are most likely to continue in the condition you desire, and I ambition. I know you will obey the King. I know you will not deny my Happiness. But 'ts not enough I know it, unless I do so by your assurance of it to me, and to my Friend. Before I will obey any of your Commands, (replied Statira ) I must beg the knowledg of one particular, and in that I must not be denied; 'tis to tell me by what inducement Mithridates was led, to what he has injoyned me, for I cannot imagine how he could know, that Callimachus had an esteem for me, more than for any other, and as little believe, unless he thought so, how he could fancy me, the recompence he intended him. And I can as uneasily believe, that Callimachus would make me his request without having ever sounded my Inclinations therein either by himself or by you. Though I am certain, ( Ataphernes answered) that all the desires of Mankind united, cannot transcend the passion with which he desires to serve you, yet I'le assure you, he was so far from making you his request, that when the King made you his offer, he did so generously acknowledg his unworthiness of you, and so civilly tax the Kings Justice in that offer, that had you heard what he said, and seen what he did, you could no more have declined admireing his Respect, than without Injustice, you can decline rewarding it. But to obey your Commands I will Ingeniously acknowledge that when Mithridates had acquainted me with his new League with Sertorius , and with his intent, to employ Callimachus , in the Conquest of Galatia and Pamphilia , he commanded me to Acquaint him if I knew what he intended to ask, I protested to him I was intirely ignorant thereof, and that I was more perswaded he would ask nothing, than any thing. The King then commanded me to tell him, what I thought would be most grateful to him, and whether I had any apprehensions consonant to the Queens, of his having a passion for you; I told him if he was capable of any, for any, possible it might be for you, Mithridates having a while considered, told me, that he intended him the greatest Gift, and he considered you to be that, and because you should not be married to any but a King, he would with you give Callimachus an Army to present you a Crown. This was so suited to my intentions, that I did all I could to confirm the King in his and prevailed with him to send forthwith for Callimachus : whom he injoyned three times, to make his Request, and he as often by an unconquerable silence declineing it, Mithridates then made him his greatest offer; and was necessitated to make use of his Command to make him keep that silence after his proposal, which three re-iterations of it, could not make him break before, having thus satisfied your desire, I not only hope but expect you will satisfie mine which is exacted from you by duty, Friendship, and Gratitude, and which you cannot either deny or delay, without giving me as much trouble, as by granting it you will give Callimachus and me raptures of satisfaction. You are so importunate (the Princess replied) that I know not what particularly to say to you; and therefore I will in General promise to be ruled by you. Ah Statira , (the Princess answered) embraceing her, you have now given me a greater and more welcom Evincement of your kindness than you can ever repeat. I heard, Generous [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Princess, I heard distinctly this Ravishing engagement and soon after Ataphernes call'd me out of his Closet; from whence I came with such extasies, as nothing could transcend them, but their Cause. And being come to the Prince's Bed-side, he told me, I did acquaint you Callimachus with Mithridates Commands to Statira , and with my passionate desires to her in your Favour, and now I can tell you, you need no more doubt your Felicity, than my Friendship; for she has promised to be Ruled by me in this greatest Concernment of hers and yours. Sir, I replyed; The Princess Statira esteems it some Mercy, that I should not receive my Condemnation from her own Mouth, and therefore has substituted you to pronounce it for her; but since I must receive the Fatal sentence. I most humbly beg it may be from her self, for my perfect Obedience to all her Commands will make me that way embrace my Destiny with more Resignation, and make you consider it with somwhat less sorrow when you only see my Misery, and do not by speaking those words, Act what must cause it. Yes Sir, I know I esteem, nay, I admire that Friendship you have alwayes blest me with; but I know also, I should be more unworthy of it by my Actions, than I am by the infignificancy of my Condition, and Services, could I sollicit, nay, could I so much as hope that to be the most obligeing to me, you should be the most injurious to her, and since my cruel Fate has denyed my Actions, the Power to express the lively Sense I have of your goodness; Permit me to evidence that high Truth, by my sufferings, and by my silence under them. She has done much in leaveing it in your Power to make me happy above imagination; [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and possibly I have done a little in desireing you, and that with earnestness, that you will not abuse that unlimited Trust; She has too highly rewarded my unavoidable Ambition in not punishing it, and you will highly reward my passionate desires to serve you, in granting me a Request which must convince you I would not be ungrateful, since as a Pregnant evidence thereof, I sollicit to be the miserablest of Men, to preserve you from being the unjustest. Certainly Callimachus , said Ataphernes , Your Memory is very bad, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) or you esteem mine, as so, for you have so often and so signally served, nay saved Mithridates, Statira and all the Royall House of Pontus , that it is more necessary you should receive proofs of our gratitude, than that you should think we need any fresh ones of yours, and if you longer persist in Pleading at theis rate, we must believe you esteem your obligations above reward, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) by the declineing the highest we can present you. Do not think Statira has left the pronouncing of your Destiny to me; Because she would her self avoid ruining you, for I know she loves me too well to lay such an Imposition on me, and she knows I love you too well, to accept it, No, Callimachus , she has Elected this way to satisfie both our debts; Mine by speaking our happiness, and hers by performing what I shall speak; for she is not ignorant that my ingagements to you are too vast to be paid by me alone, and that it will make my Joy proportionate to yours, by ordering her self in such a manner as in one payment she may satisfie both our debts. Oh Gods, Sir! I cried out interrupting him: I had much rather you should condemn me to death, than condemn me to hear expressions which are more wounding, than death it self. Esteem me not, I beseech you so ignorant of what my services are, and what the Princess Statira is, as to fancy I think they are above all reward because I decline the highest; No, Generous Prince, the contrary of that belief ought to be yours, and is mine; I had much rather be the miserablest of our sex; than that she should be the like of hers; to bestow her on any Man, is the greatest sin, but to believe she [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) cannot be any Mans as a debt; whoever were capable of entertaining such a crime, deserves the greatest punishment, as the lowest reward of it: And though I am as far from believeing what you said (pardon me Sir, the fault and duty of that expression) as deserving it. Yet to repair your offence against the Princess, I will revenge it on my self, which is the duty I should pay her, and the respect I owe you. Oh miserable Callimachus , I continued, Oh Fatal Services, which has reduced the greatest Beauty and Vertue that ever shined to be disobedient to her Father, and disobligeing to her Brother, or unjust to her self, Ah Madam, I proceeded prostrating my self at her feet and kissing them; At least be so Just to this unfortunate person, as to believe the necessities to which you are undesignedly reduced unto by him, are more wounding to him, than they can be to you; and oblige your Adorer so far as to be satisfied that for all those services he endeavoured to present you, he ambitioned nothing else, but that you should receive them, and that you would pardon their being so few, and so disproportionate to the person, to whom they were paid, and to the desires and duty of him that paid them; Above this I swear by your self, too great an oath to be violated, I covet nothing, and if your goodness induce you to credit so much; I shall never aspire at more, but that by a resolute denial of what the great Mithridates has commanded you, and your Generous Brother has implored of you, you would evidence to them and all the World besides, that you know your self; and believe me Statira , dear Statira , (the obligeing Ataphernes cryed out) will you then by your fatal silence, manifest you have no obedience for your fathers Commands, but when they are imposed on you for Ascanius , and shall that Friendship you have alwayes vowed to me, and still blest me with, only fail me, where I most desire and am most concerned to receive the effects of it; Alas Ataphernes , the fair Mithridatia replyed, what is it you expect from me, I thought I had at least done enough in leaving it to you, to dispose of me; yes, yes, said Ataphernes that had been enough in any Mans Case but Callimachus's : But you see 'tis not enough that you permit me to make him happy, you your self must command him to be so, or else you must resolve to see me as miserable, as he would make himself in his respects for you. At these words, Statira , at once cast off all those disorders which had been but too visible in her Looks, in her Words, and in her Actions, and with that Empire, which still I admired as much as I heard, casting her eyes upon me, she said, Challimachus , you are too cruel in making Ataphernes to press me beyond what I have already spoke, but since, Ah! Madam, I cried out, do not call that my Crime which is my Torment. If my Arguings, if my praying against my self, produced such guilty desires in your Generous Brother; Be pleas'd to let me only endure the punishment thereof, but do not impute to me the sin; I would have dyed, I would have kill'd my self, to have exempted you from those difficulties, your obedience to Mithridates , and your affection for Ataphernes have ingaged you in; when you denied me that just and only prevention, I held my peace, but then my silence pleaded against you, and for me; I then argued and prayed against my self, but both those produced the like effect, what therefore does remain but that now you permit me to embrace that Remedie which hitherto your Commands, nay, your reiterated Commands prohibited me to Act; I am as ready now to present your Vertues, your Beauty and your Quality that cure, as ever: nay, I am more ready to do it now, than before, being more convinced now, than ever, that the necessity of that performance is now as great, as the Duty, but if your goodness declines to behold what I now mention, my respect shall carry me into some remote Countrey, where on the point of your Enemies Swords I will receive that Fate my crimes and your sufferings have made you deny me, to receive from mine own hand. Ataphernes at the conclusion of these words, overwhelmed with the sorrow they had invaded him with, sunk down into his Bed, and his spirits abandoning him, he remained pale and speechless in his Sisters and my Arms, for we were both run to his Assistance. Which proved so effectual that in a few Moments he opened his Eyes again, and casting them languishingly on his weeping Sister, he told her, Statira , you imploy your goodness where it is not needed, and decline it, where 'tis. But all these evincements of your Love to me, unless you confer yours on my Friend, I shall receive as Manfestations of your hate, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) for to love or to see Callimachus miserable is more cruelty, than to let me dy. Since, replied the fair Statira , you will have me speak that, which possibly were enough in me if I obeyed, I will force my self to an intire observance of your Commands.

The Gods (continued Callimachus , speaking to his Generous hearers) only knew the Raptures with which I celebrated such a promise, and such a Command, the first had made me still defend my self, if the last had not made that great duty a greater sin; But yet casting my self again at my Princess Her Feet, I could not [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) tye my self from saying, in unfanciable Transports, The Gods, Madam, shall be my Witnesses, that I never did any thing more with the obedience of a Subject, than in the accepting that Felicity which raises me infinitely above the Condition of any King, nor had you any way, to perswade me to this happiness but making me receive it, as an effect of my obedience, and if ever I perform an Action, Nay, if ever I entertain a thought, but what may be Consonant to this high Truth; May my miseries be as unexpressible, as my Joys, or which is more, as the Mercy which had placed me in them. Why should I (continued Challimachus ) speaking to Artabanus , and Artauasdes , trouble you with particularizing those transports which are so far from being describable, that they are not imaginable; Let it suffice you to know, Ataphernes at that assurance, recovered out of his fainting and heard his fair Sisters words, with extasies which nothing but Mine could transcend, and from that houre the Princess Statira used me at a rate which evidenced, she [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) has resolved to Act that Happiness she had then assured me of, Mithridates also the next Morning visited Ataphernes , and there inquired of, and learned from him, the result of that blessed Nights discourse at which he exprest a satisfaction so sublime, that I then was confident, my felicities were as far from being reverst, as of admitting an accession. The next day I attended on Auletes who then told me, what his Fatal indisposition had interrupted, when I last waited on him; He confest the Beauty which had conquered him was the Princess Cleopatra , and conjured me neither to disclose his passion, or his quality, till by some happy services, he might find an opportunity to reveal both, and conjur'd me with all the pressings of a Generous Lover and Prince, to take all occasions to prepare the fair Cleopatra to entertain his adorations when he should find the Ambitioned season of paying them to her; This I faithfully assured him of, and as the, hopefullest way to that end, I advised and prevailed with him, to permit me, to acquaint the princess Statira and the Prince Ataphernes , who he was and what he aspired unto; for I [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) know the lovely Cleopatra guided all her Actions by their advices, and if they could be ingaged for him, his happiness would be half perfected. I found Auletes so Worthy a Person, and I had found in my self how vast the miseries are of a Lover in suspence, and his Joyes when certain, as in all those knowledges I esteemed my self the more ingaged to serve him; and did discover his Secret to the admirable Sister and Brother, so much to his advantage, that all things concurring in the Prince of Æ gypt ; which could make Cleopatra's Happiness; They assured me that to Act it should be their endeavours and they hoped should also be their success. Auletes a few dayes after received a private visit from Ataphernes and such assurances both of his Esteem of him and desires to oblige him in his addresses to his Sister, that those promises made him recover faster, than all the Art of his Physicians, and made him ever as much a Friend to the Brother, as he was a Lover to the Sister. Whil'st I was thus contributing to the Happiness of the Æ gyptian Prince, the Glorious Day of my own advanced, and by that time the Army was raised, with which I was to Conquer Galatia and Pamphilia : The Eve of it was come, but the nearer I came to my Felicity, the greater inspection I made into it, and consequently I judged my self the more unworthy of it; I past much of the Evening which preceded that Memorable Day in the Fair Statira's appartment, where by Ataphernes Conjurations, and her unlimited goodness, I received such new evincements of her esteem, that I Knew not which was greater, my Joy that I received them, or my Grief that I neither did nor could, so much as rationally hope ever to deserve them, and though many admirable particularities were contained in those few Moments, yet I will not retail them, reserving the Honour of your attentions for those Prodigious events which a few hours after, were by the Gods destined to follow. The morning at last came, in which by Sacred Contract, I was to receive assurances of a Blessing, my Enemies could not think me more unworthy of, than I thought my self; That Justice against my self was as requisit to preserve me from death by an excess of Joy, as the Princess Statira's Promises and Commands had been to preserve me from it, by a Contrary extream. But that Day no sooner dawn'd, than I rose to Celebrate an ingagement which was to give me more pregnant Invitations to Sollicit the Conquest of Galatia , than the wearing the Crown of that Kingdom, and the Glory of that Victory, could present me; never did War provoke the aspireing to success, with a Recompence Proportionate to Mine, neither could I have been more certain of Victory, after I had Acted it, than I was before I began to court it, I considered whilst I was dressing my self that the Sacred Promises the Princess Statira was that day to give me after my subduing of Galatia , as a certain evidence of my Conquering of it; And me thought no obstacles which could oppose that end but would be rather Foiles than impediments to my Glory; nay, the suspension of my Joyes, till I presented her with a Crown, did not diminish them; for I thought it but just I should pay my debts before I received my Reward, and if any thing in that happy Morning clouded my raptures, 'twas only that I was designed to do so little, and to receive so much. Had I been destined to present her, with the Empire of Rome , instead of that of Galatia , I should more joyfully have attempted that, than this, and the length of the trouble would have been abundantly repaired by the Glory of the attempt, and the proportionatness of the Present, if I succeeded, and with the Honour and Justice of the attempt, if I succeded not; whilst I was entertaining my self with these pleasing Imaginations, they were interrupted by the visit of the Generous Ataphernes , who had so much joy in his looks that had I never received any other evidence of the height and reallity of his Friendship, I might even in those only have read the certainty of both; A thousand times he embraced me, and seemed as happy in having made me so, as I was in being so, I paid him all the humble acknowledgments I was capable of, and I believe he easily saw I was troubled I could present him, with no more, But I beg'd him that the same goodness which had valued me above my services, would also accept of my desires, as my performances. To cut off such expressions (as he told me) he led me soon after to Mithridates Appartment, at the door of which he met him, and all the considerable Persons of the Court. Who by the example of my Princes Gallantry appeared in all theirs; which so far exceeded what had been seen at Ascanius intended Nuptials that I flattered my self with a belief, their satisfaction at my condition transcended theirs for his. The King of Pontus by many re-iterated assurances of his Favour, endeavoured by words to oblige me, as much as he had done by Actions and so confounded me with the excesses of his Favour, that I hope he read in my silence a livelier Character of my Resentments, than my words could have presented him, from thence he led me to the Princes Statira's Appartment, who that day having cast off her Mourning for the King of Cyprus , seemed to be the goodness of that Island, and had she made the Fourth of that Number where the happy Paris was Judge, she must have been the First in Beauty, by his sentence, or rather the other three durst not have stood in Competition for it with her. Her Beauty so dazled all our Eyes, and so blinded Mine, that I was a Thousand times ready to have violated her last Commands, and again to have begg'd of her to make me rather the Miserablest, than the Happiest of Men; But the Generous Ataphernes , observing both in my silence and my looks the height of my confusions, and apprehending their effects, told Mithridates ; all things were ready for the Celebration of that Solemnity, who thereupon leading me by the hand to the Ptincess Mithridatia , on whom I durst not so much as lift up my Eyes; He Commanded her to give me hers, which she did, and which I received prostrate at her Feet, and should have done it in a more humble and acknowledging Posture; if any such had been, the fair Statira had the goodness to Command me to rise, which after three Commands to do it, I obeyed. The Pontick King then led the way to his Domestick Temple; And by his appointment immediately after him, I waited on the Princess, Ataphernes led the Queen, on whose face only any sadness was visible which yet she attributed to an indisposition which had hindred her from Rest all the preceding Night; The rest of that Noble Company followed in order, till we came to the Holy Place; where at the Altar stood the Priest, who was to perform the requisite Ceremonies. Mithridates having caused a deep silence to be observed; In an Eloquent speech declared the perfect affection he had for his Admirable Daughter, and then in Elogies was pleased to Magnifie those low services, I had paid his Family and Crown, concluding with these words; that since my Actings had been the highest, he had proportioned thereunto, the Recompence of his acknowledgments and Bounty; And aswell to pay my past services, as to encourage my future, he had set this day apart, to contract his best Daughter to me, whom he then declared he would give me in marriage, as soon as ever I had with the Army then raised, conquered Galatia and Pamphilia and by my valour and conduct provided that for her, which her Merit and extraction deserved, and the ignorance of my Birth denied me any other way to present her. At the end of these expressions, he commanded the Priest to do this office; who immediatly pronounced those Glorious words which the Princess Statira , and I, on my knees spoke after him; By which I received an assurance, before the Gods above, and before the greatest Assembly in the World, that the highest Beauty in It had condescended to give her self to me, and that nothing but death should ever dissolve that contract: The contemplation of this Felicity, made me cast my self again at Statira's Feet, and there in Actions, rather than in words, I acknowledged her Mercy and my unworthiness of it. In the midst of my acknowledgments we heard many loud and repeated shouts of Joy in the City, which still seemed to advance nearer to the Palace, and at last we heard them continued even in the Gates of it; and soon after we distinctly heard in the Court the like Cryes, often intermixt with them, the names Pharnaces and Ascanius , which drew many out of the Temple to learn their Cause, which immediately after was made evident even in the Temple it self by Pharnaces and Ascanius entring into it, The first running to salute Mithridates , and the last with the like hast casting himself before the Princess Statira , and embraceing her knees in Raptures, nothing in degrees could transcend, but her wonder and Mine at that Miracle: His weakness or his joy, was so great that in that action only for some time he evidenced his transports; But as soon as he could break his silence, he did it in these words. You see Madam at your Feet, he that lately lost his life in the Honour of your Service, and he that would not admit of a second life, but to imploy and end it in the like Glorious Duty. My supposed Death in designing the Princes Statira's Deliverance manifests, what I would have done to have Acted it, and it was more painfull to me, than those wounds which gave me a seeming death, that what was my intention was not my performance, I knew to dye for you was fitter for me, than that Felicity your Mercy had destined me unto, I submitted to the first, as more just than the last, and being unworthy of the highest happiness, I repined not, that I underwent the highest Duty. But those powers which know he is least unworthy of you, which does most perfectly adore you, have raised me to life, that by your Mercy and condescention the World and Ascanius may know by the Recompence of that Truth, how intirely you believe the reality of it, my unsuccessfullness, in your deliverance merited my seeming Death, and my unequal'd Flame merited that Resurrection, without which your mercy in crowning it, would have been rendred ineffectual, so that in those several Fates the Gods have imposed on Ascanius you may see Fair Methridatia , how equally just they are, both to my unhappiness and my Adorations. After these words the King of Cyprus told the Princess Statira , how whilst some of his Nobility were preparing for his Body, the requisite Solemnities due to the Monarchs of that Island, they found some Symptomes of life remaining in it, which they improved with such Art, Care Diligence, and Secresie, that in a few Hours their hopes of his recovery, had wiped away Their tears for his imaginary Death; That the better to cloud the transpotrs of that chang and the more successfully to enjoy the fruits of their endeavours and Duty, they caused the dead Body of a young Cyprian Lord to receive all the Ceremonies due unto his own, and did uot communicate the Fallacy unto any; But those who could not but know it, who yet they tied by Sacred Oaths to inviolable Secresie even from the rest of the Cyprians themselves, whose tears and sorrows so well deluded the Subjects and Servants of Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes that they never had the least umbrage of the Truth, whereby when the thirty dayes of the usual Funeral Rites were efflux'd, the two Kings permitted a Cyprian Gally to transport his supposed Embalmed Corps to Cyprus . As soon as the Funeral-Gally, had recovered the Cyprian Fleet, he shewed himself unto them, their suprize was not greater, than his own, when he found in the same Gally with him, the Prince Pharnaces ; who had also recovered his liberty, by an unexpected Accident; For Euastes who was Vice-Admiral to Nicomedes having lost his life, attempting to carry away by surprize the Royal Family of Pontus ; Many of the Bythinian Nobility were sollicitors to succeed him in that high imployment and amongst those Cleomax favorite to Nicomedes , upon that score, was most earnest, and had most hopes; but his King as a reward of the high attempt of the Father, conferred that Office on Lixcestes his Son who by many signal Actions of Conduct and Courage, had a double title to that Command, to which he added the most powerful one of silence, to Merit. Cleomax though sensibly wounded by his Failer-suppresses all Resentments, by Words, and resolves to manifest them by Actions; so that soon after, having got an opportunity of a private Conference with Pharnaces , offered him to set him at Liberty and to depend on his Favour for his future Fortunes; The Prince of Pontus Joyfully laid hold of this Overture, and Promises Cleomax rewards proportionate to his Service, so that when the Funeral Gally was to begin her voyage Cleomax disguises Pharnaces and himself and thrusting themselves into the Croud of that solemnity without interruption, got into the Gally and escaped. Whilst Ascanius said Callimachaus to his Generous hearers was thus telling the Princess Statira these admirabel Accidents, Pharnaces was relating them to Mithridates , and then presented Cleomax to him, whom the Pontick King received with all Manner of acknowledgments, and on the Place ordered him rewards, as great as his Infidelity, this being done, the Pontick King came to Embrace Ascanius , to whom the Princess had not answered one word to all he had said, so great was her wonder and her trouble at once. The King of Cyprus , after his acknowledgments were paid in the most passionate Words and Actions, summoned Mithridates of his Promise, and implored, that as in the publick Temple he had been divorced from his blessing, so in the Domestick Temple he might be possest of it. I perceive Generous Prince, replied Mithridates , by this request you are ignorant of the occasion which has brought this Assembly hither; No Sir, Ascanius answered, I heard it since my Landing, But Great King I know 'twas only my supposed Death led you to what you have done, the Cause ceaseing, the Effects should do the like, the chief Motive to the performance failing, 'tis a necessary consequence, that all built on it, should fail with it. You would not have given the Fair Statira to Callimachus , had you known Ascanius was alive. 'Tis too much your ignorance of my Condition ha's so much wounded me, let not your Knowledge of it wound me more. Had I known you were living, the Pontick King replied, interrupting him, I would in some other way have endeavoured to reward Callimachus's innumerable Services; but I doubt Statira's Engagementss and mine are too far past to be recalled, so that if I should not keep my Engagements to the Generous Ascanius , 'tis not my Crime, but the Crime of his own Fate. Would to the Gods, the King of Cyprus answered, I had really dyed, rather than live to hear these killing words! What Sir, shall your promises be thus observed, and shall my services and sufferings be thus rewarded? did you only raise my hopes to the most Glorious height, that ever any atain'd unto, only with more cruelty to precipitate me and them? shall your mistake be more powerfull for my Ruine, than your knowledge for my preservation? Oh Sir, give me not so much cause to believe, that what you say proceeded from your Ignorance, proceeded from your design, and let not that Princess Mithridatia , be made a Sacrifice to Gratitude, who is a Blessing above all, that services can pretend unto; do not give Callimachus more than you should, and do not give me less, than you promised. The Services of Callimachus said Mithridates , deserve my higheh acknowledgments; And in giving him Statira , you therefore see how highly I valued Ascanius since to him, I once had destined, what I thought a full recompence for preserving and restoring my whole Family and my self: If these intentions have not had the success, I meant them, possibly it is not more your trouble, than it is mine; But my intentions and sufferings said Ascanius have been greater, than his, in what depended of our selves I have been as much his superiour, as in what depended on Chance he has been mine, Do not therefore reward Fortune more than you will reward Vertue; and let me not so much doubt your Justice, as experimentally to feel, you give more to my sollicitations, than to my services; since only to Crown the First you design'd for me the Princess Mithridatia , and to recompence the last you condemn me to a loss, as much transcending Death, as his Condition who shall possess the Princess, will transcend the condition of all others. While I did nothing, you gave me all I could wish, and when I have done, all I could, you deny me, what you promist; Callimachus's Services have the highest Favour, but mine are denied the lowest Justice. Excuse me Sir, if what you spoke as a doubt, I resent as a certainty, I know you are too just and too Generous to violate your solemne ingagements, and that I need no other Argument to incline you to observe them, but to remember you of them, I will therefore no longer plead them, but only lay before you, what is your debt to the Prinbess who ought (if bestowed on any) to be given to him who by the highest Flame has the least unworthy title to her, she merits more, than to sit in the Throne of the Universe; and therefore though to sit in that of Cyprus , be below her, yet 'tis much more below her to be given to one, who is so far from having a Throne to invite her to, that he has not so much as a certain residence to present her; whose Birth is not known to you and possibly to himself, or if he be not ignorant of it, yet his not discovering of it, may justly invite you to believe the lowness of it, is the cause why he conceales it, for 'tis better to doubt that evil, than to be certain of it, whereby your admirable Daughter will be made a Sacrifice to your Ignorance, instead of your Gratitude, and perhaps after her Condition is irrevocable, you may find: that she who merits the whole World may be cast away upon one who is of the lowest degree in it, and who has nothing considerable but his Fortune and his Sword. While I perceived, continued Callimachus , that Mithridates opposed the desires of Ascanius , I did without interrupting his sollicitations listen to them, but when so rudely he reflected on me, and that at the end of what he had said, I observed the Pontick King, and the whole Assembly turned their Eyes upon me, and thereby seemed to tell me, They expected I should answer for my self, I did immediately upon my knees kiss the Princess Statira's hand, which during the Glorious words of Contract, and till then, I had by her permission held in Mine: and then rising and turning my self to Ascanius , with a look which some of my Friends afterwards assured me, made him look paler, than his wounds had done, I told him, King of Cyprus ; while you did plead that Great Mithridates Promises, the only title you could show for the Confidence of your Ambition, and while you owned, every man, unworthy of that Blessing, you sollicited; I kept that silence which my respect to the highest Assembly in the World, rendered my duty; But now that you have broken those Bounds and that you endeavour to raise your own Trophies to my prejudice; I must tell you, that if the highest and most perfect Flame that ever burnt, renders him that is blest with it, the least unworthy of the Princess Statira's Esteem, 'tis Challimachus and not Ascanius , has the best Title to that Happiness; which in any part of the World, but before those which are the chiefest in it, I will justifie. The Ignorance of my Birth which you upbraid me with, is that I glory in; for 'tis more to perform the Actions of a King, than only to be born One; and the Sword which can conquer Kingdoms, is more to be valued than that King whose Sword does loose them. In what quarrel is it, you can flatter your self, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) with Hope's success? when even in the Princess Statira's Service, Nay, even in her sight, you have twice fail'd of it; By your first drawing of your Sword, she lost her precious Liberty; and by your second, she had lost even the hopes of recovering it. If this Callimachus , whose Birth is unknown, or possibly is of the lowest in the whole World, had not paid her those duties, which your exalted Birth were unable to present her; Ascanius , said Callimachus , had not the patience to hear me out, but interrupting me, at these Words, replied, Were not this Glorious Assembly, and the Sacred Place in which thou dost speak thy insolent words, thy double Sanctuaries, thou shouldst before now, have felt thy punishment from that Sword which thy Pride does so undervalue: if it should not serve me in this reparation, I would eternally forswear wearing it, but I may live to see thee, before other company, and in another place. If that were really thy desire, I answered, thou would'st not have taken so hopeful a way of preventing it, as to have made this Declaration before so many Witnesses, neither could'st thou have more evidently manifested my Adorations; for the Princess Statira excels thine, than in promising thy self more success from thy Sword in revenging thy own Quarrel, than revenging hers, when even thy own Faults, made her Revenge, a double duty; Thou dost allow me two Sanctuaries, but I allow thee but one; for were it not in reverence to this Assembly, thou should'st find that neither the Temple we are in, nor the Altar of it, should be thy Protection. Would to the Gods, Ascanius furiously replied, that only the Sword thou so magnifi'st, and that Sword thou so undervaluest, were to decide who is least unworthy of the Princess Statira ; Thou should'st soon feel, the highest Birth is capable only of the highest Passion: And though I might with Justice promise my self upon my own Account a Victory against thy Sword, yet I would ascertain it, by making the fair Mithridatia not only the Cause of our dispute, but the reward of it; thou wouldst then learn that all those Laurels Fortune has heaped upon thy Head, were but prepared for me; that I was seemingly unsuccessful, but to become more really the contrary; and what thou did'st obtain more from the valour of those thou had'st the Honour to lead, than from thine own, would by my Swords purchase, become my Right; yes, presumptuous Callimachus , I renounce the King of Pontus his engagements to me, I renounce the superiority of my Title, and Birth, I will forget the Ignorance, or meanness of thine, do but singly dispute the Princess Statira with me, and I will forgive thy past insolencies to her and me, if thou wilt put me but in so certain a way, of hindering thee from repeating them in the Future. This Generosity I replied, with raptures of Joy I accept, give me so certain a way of punishing thee, I will renounce my Glorious Contract, I will forget thy being twice defeated, I will only consider thee as a Rival, worthy of my Sword; and leave it to the Gods, whether a Third time they think fit to declare, what they have twice declared already, Ascanius without listening further to what I was about to say, or answering what I had said, turned himself to Mithridates , and in the most moveing Actions and expressions he was capable of, sollicited his permission, to that offer which he had made, and I had so joyfully accepted. Possibly Generous Princess, Callimachus continued, you may admire that Mithridates did not interpose his Authority at the very beginning of these discourses between the King of Cyprus and me. But perhaps you will do so no longer, when I have told you, that when our First heats began, Cleomax having whispered to Pharnaces , that Prince forthwith told his Father in his Ear something, at which he was so surprized, that he was so far from interrupting what had past betwixt us, that he scarcely listened unto it, for he had taken Cleomax aside: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) which Pharnaces , with whom he so intently did discourse that all the while Ascanius was imploreing a Concession to his request, the King of Pontus neither answered him, nor so much as looked towards him; And by that time the Cyprian had finished his Request; Mithridates having done speaking with his Son, and with Cleomax, Ascanius fell a repeating that suite which he had so lately made, and to which he had received no return; having the second time ended what he would say, Mithridates desired his Excuse, for having given so little attention to his First Sollicitation; for he had been taken up in an imployment, which possibly might render [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) unnecessary in the yeilding to his desires. Then turning himself to me, with his voyce raised more than ordinarily, he told me, Callimachus what I have done this day for you, be-before I Knew of the King of Cyprus being being alive, and what I have said for you, since I [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) know it gives you no shadow to doubt that I not only value your Eminent services, but made it my care to reward them in a way at least answerable to their greatness, and the just sence I had of them; But I have been now assured of that, which if true, I shall more repent my Favours, than ever I was desirous to load you with them; had it been what only my informer would have told me, and not justified to your Face, I had received his Intelligence with as much contempt, as now I entertain it with trouble, but since he desires, I will beleive what he told me to be true or false, but as you shall confess, or deny, I will not scruple to put that to a tryal, where you are Party-Witness, and Judg. My Informer is Cleomax , my Information is, that 'twas not only Ostanes which helped you to escape, but that he did it by Nicomedes's Orders, and that the banished Bythinian King laid the design for your Flight, by a Joint contrivance of it with your self; whether this be true or false, you your self can best tell me, and till you give me your answer, I will believe neither; but I expect, nay, I enjoyn you to deal clearly with me; and to disguise nothing; the freedom I have used, merits what I demand, and I know you will not give me an answer which may render you unworthy of such an usage. Never, Generous Princess, continued Callimachus , was any Man's surprize comparable to Mine, at this Fatal Question; to deny the Truth was to wound that sincerity which my Words and Actions had alwayes observed, and to confess the Truth, was to wound me mortally in those hopes, whose death I most apprehended; This unexpected fatal discovery and question and the Ruinous Consequences of not answering at all or answering the Truth, so confounded me, that I remained speechless so long, that Mirhridates told me, if I would not answer, he would take my silence for a Confession. This cruel Declaration forced me to say, Sir, you should not have needed a second and a threatning Command, if by Solemn Engagements, I had not bound my self to silence, in what I now seem to be accused of. Sir, said Pharnaces , to his Father, you need no greater evincement of Cleomax's Fidelity to your service, and of Callimachus's guilt, than his not answering this Charge, and he that is so much a Friend to your Mortallest Enemy, merits not to be trusted against him; Much less to have your Favourite-Daughter, made the reward of his Services. To which the Generous Ataphernes , interrupting what I was going to answer, replied, Allow Sir, that what Cleomax informs were true, I hope Sir, you will not think it just to credit inferences, above actual Services, he values still his duty to you above his Gratitude to Nicomedes and he that cannot be corrupted by such obligations, is uncapable of that sin, so that even his accusation is so far from rendring him the less capable of your favour, that he thereby becomes more deserving of it. The Prince Ataphernes , I answered, Mithridates , has said so much in so little, That he leavs me nothing to do, but only to mind you, Sir, that I was guilty once before I had the Honour to know the great Mithridates , to draw my Sword in Nicomedes's Quarrel against yours; His Generosity possibly remembred more, what I had at first done for him, than what since I had done against him, and if I submitted to his resentments; for by all the Gods, I never courted them, no not so much as moved him to them, it was with this firm assurance, that nothing he could do for me, should diminish in the least, the zeal I had to your service, and what I then might have told him, I have since fully Acted, But why? replied the Pontick King, with a furious look, did you wholly ascribe your Deliverance to Ostanes's kindness? And why did you conceal from me Nicomedes's ? Perhaps, Sir, I answered, Nicomedes was resolv'd to oblige me entirely, he might doubt, should you know his Favour only had given me my liberty, you might suspect me so far, as to decline receiving those services which your Ignorance of it might inable me to present you: He knew my Nature, and my Justice tied me to acknowledge obligations, till I could with Honour pay them; And to prevent my receiveing a prejudice, where he intended me a Favour, he might confine me to that silence which now you seem to ascribe unto my guilt; since replyed Mithridates with an inflamed Countenance, I find Cleomax , has told me the Truth; I since find you acknowledge an high obligation to Nicomedes and a Duty therefore upon you to repay it; And since you have declared your resolution never to part from my service, I must conclude you intend, whilst in that, to serve him, so that even out of your own Mouth, I find it but just, not to give my Daughter to the Friend of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) any Enemy; And not to trust any of my Armies or Fleets to one, whom I cannot beleive, or else must believe him unworthy that high Alliance and Trust. Now I see what made you forward to excahnge him without my consent, nay, without my knowledg. And now I call to mind the Earnest you lately gave, of your resolutions to oblige Nicomedes since, after his having designed my Captivity, Nay, I believe my Murther also, when I exprest my just detestations of that most Barbarous proceeding, and bound my self to revenge it by my most inviolable Oaths, you would have had me forget, both my Injuries and Vows. No, no, Callimachus , you have but too much forfeited all my good Opinion of you, and all my intentions for you, and thereby have made it but Reasonable that I should send you to that Nicomedes , to whom you are so much indebted, that by your services to him, you may discharge some of those obligations you acknowledg you owe him. I was, continued Callimachus , wounded to the heart at these piercing words, and therefore told the King, Because Nicomedes was so generous to me, Because I was so just to him, as to pay him that Gratitude and Obedience, I might present him without Infidelity to you, nay, which was more for your service than his, for had I told you my obligations to him, your suspicion, had disabled me from paying you these services of defeating his Fleet, and of saving your precious Life, and the Lives and Liberties of the Royal House of Pontus ; Must his Gallantry, and my Innocent Retributions for it, be esteemed my Guilt? And must weak Inferences be more Credited against me, than signal Actions be Credited for me? Must the Exchanging of a dying Prisoner for the Princess Statira , be now esteemed a Crime, which so lately was esteemed a considerable service? Had I stayed for receiving your Commands I might have lost the power of obeying them; And shall the exchanging a Prisoner loaden with Wounds, for that divine Princess, which is above Ransom be thought a greater Guilt, than reduceing that great Prisoner to that Condition, is thought a Service? Shall my pleading against a Vow, which pregnant evincements [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17027001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF120D1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) manifested, be mistakenly grounded, and which was to hinder the great Mithridates from what I thought unjust, be now considered as my crime? Shall my words Pleading for you as much, if not more than for him, be more operative against me, than my Actions and my Wounds are perswasive for me? Alas it is high time to despair, when what was my Merit, is now considered, as my Guilt; No Sir, think not offending me to Nicomedes , though I acknowledge I owe him much, yet I preferr Affronts in your service, above Glory in his; And if your differences should never be reconciled, I had rather dye ungrateful to him, than ever separate my self one Moment from your interests. Pardon me, Sir, if I say, I find my only Guilt is Ascanius's Resurrection; You owe the Princess Mithridatia's Vertue, and Birth, more than you owe the Duties of my Services, and since you see nothing can pay them, But, what does over pay them? and that you think it juster to give her to him, who can place her in a Throne, than to him who has only a Sword to conquer one for her, you therefore choose to pay my performances, by blasting of them, and rob me of all Tittle to Happiness, by laying to my charge an imaginary Crime, but though my respect to the great Mithridates , and which is more to the Father of the Princess Statira , will bind me not to repine at what he shall decree, yet having no obligation to the Cypriau King, I must and do now solemnly Vow before those Gods to whom this Temple is dedicated, and who were invoked to be Witnesses of my Felicty, as now they are of my Disgrace, that if he sollicits the breaking of that Glorious Contract, your Commands and the Princess Mithridatia's condescention ha's blessed me with, though he still should sit in his Throne, and should still be guarded by all his Subjects yet through all their Swords, Mine shall Force a passage to his Breast, and make him feel, and the World see, the vastness of my Passion, in that of my Revenges overcoming all those dissiculties which could oppose it. Mithridates at these words loosing all his Temper, in Raptures of Fury told me, art thou not only contentented with having owned thy self a Friend to my Enemy, but wilt also declare thy self the intended Murtherer of that King, to whom I will give Statira , Since thy Insolence has made thee discover thy Criminal Intentions. My Justice shall prevent thy Acting them; Then turning to the Captain of his Guards he Commanded him and them, to seize on me, Whilst the Captain of the Guards, and the Guards themselves, in their amazement or trouble, at that fatal and unjust Command, continued Moveless; Pharnaces and Ascanius drawing their Swords came towards me to execure that Order, which those to whom only it was given, wanted Power, or had too much honesty to perform; this made me immediately draw Mine, and having told Pharnaces the employment he took was below a Prince, and a Prince that was the Princess Statira's Brother, against whom I durst not lift up my hands, but would offer to his Sword my unguarded Breast, rather than imploy it against one so nearly related to her; I put by that thrust Ascanius in the mean time, made at me, and closeing with him I flung him down disarmed him, and had then and there Acted my Revenge, if the Fair Statira's Commands more, than all those Guards which at last by their Kings repeated Orders had invironed me, and forced from my hands my own Sword, had not hindred me from the Execution of my just Resentments; But those being supprest by the highest Commands, I turned my self towards her, who had imposed them on me, and with the deepest submission imaginable I told her. The Gods Madam, even in their Temple, and in their presence, and yours also have so much eased that weight of these miseries I am loaden with, that even in that way my Rival Elected to decide who is the least unworthy of you, have declared their Sentence in that great Cause, in favour of him to whom the right did belong; your mercy, Fair Princess is not more evident to him, than my Success is, and instead of punishing the Presumptuous aspireing of his Addresses; and his unsuccessfullness in your Quarrel by which you were made a Prisoner, you were pleased to save his life; for 'twas only your Commands which did it, and I glory more in my obedience, than my Victory, since in that I powerfully evidence all your Commands are Sacred to me, nor can you doubt I will disobey any of them, since I even obey those for him, whose injuries to you are greater, than those he ha's cast upon me. Mithridates inflamed at what I had done, beyond the capability of Accession, Commanded me forthwith to be carried close Prisoner to Heraclia : Solemnly vowing that if I escaped thence, the Governour's life should answer it, and then observing the Dejectedness of Ascanius , to revive him, and the more sensibly to be revenged on me; He turned himself to the Princess and told her, Statira, Callimachus having thus forfieted all my good intentions for him, and that Ptince to whom I first designed, you being restored to life, I Command you to perfect in this Temple that happiness for him; which you were interrupted from conferring on him, in the other; This Injunction continued Callimachus , wounded me, more than all those unparalel'd Miseries Fortune had that day heaped upon me; and whilst I was sinking under their weight, I observed the Princess Mithridatia at that fatal Command change Colour, and continued in a deep silence which made the Pontick King tell her; I shall think your cruelty, not kindness, made you concerned to save Ascanius's life, unless in the way I enjoyne you, you forthwith, to ask his Blessing. At this second Assault; she continued as silent, and under the same found higher disorders, than at the First time he so incenced her inraged Father, that he told her; What, Statira , have you also lost that Obedience, which till this Moment you so exactly paid to all my Commands? Can you think that Callimachus worthy of my Daughter? That I think unworthy of Liberty, perhaps of life, and, can you for such a man decline a Prince, as great it his Passion as in his Birth, who ha's expos'd the Forces of his Kingdom, and his Life also for your Service, and if his success ha's not proportion'd his Courage, or his Vertue, yet he that so nearly had lost his Life to obtain the Victory, showed how much he deserved it; and if you value not him above the false Callimachus , you Manifest, you esteem Merit less, than Fortune; I require you, nay, I Command you to place the King of Cyprus in that Felicity I had designed for one, you must acknowledge unworthy of it. And let me not meet with a disobedience in an Injunction which I am concerned should be observ'd in Honour to my self, Affection to you, and Revenge to Callimachus ; Alas Sir, replied the Princess Statira , with the deepest submssion, and mildness, What is it you Command me? The Gods are my Witnesses, I have in all things paid you an Obedience so perfect, that 'tis in the last evincement of that Truth that you have now rendered me uncapable to present you with this other, which now you require from me. For to obey your Commands I have Solemnly Vowed before all the Gods, and the Great Assembly: That I will be no Man's, but Callimachus's , and that I will be his; A higher Duty therefore, than that I owe my Father and my King, renders me unable to obey him; and since my Obedience Justifies, my now disobedience, you will not I hope call that my Crime, which is my Religion; By all those Gods Mithridates furiously Answered, you shall never be Callimachus's ; you may Sir, replied the Princess, in her former submissiveness, hinder me from being his: But Sir I can never be any Man's but his. At these Glorious words breaking out of the hands of those Guards which held me, I cast my self at her Feet, and told her. This Charming Assurance, divine Princess gives me a Joy which does overballance all those Miseries I have had this day hurl'd upon me; you show your self in this admirable Action worthy of greater Empires, than your Piety makes you decline, your vochsafeing to own your despised Callimachus , when Men, nay, when Fortune, and Justice it self abandons him, puts him in a Capacity to out-brave all Misfortunes; yes divine Statira , I consider now all my sufferings with coutentment, since 'tis those only have invited you to say more in my Favour, than all my Services could extort from you; I now no more condemn my Destiny, 'tis so Glorious, it rather Merits Envy, than Pity, now I despise Captivity, nay, Death it self, having in this one moment, heard assurances from the justest and Fairest Lips, which are Felicities enough for an Age, and those Happinesses the Gods deny me in length, their perfectest resembler confers on me, in weight; I had longer continued in Raptures of this Nature; but that I was by Mithridates's Commands forced from that happy posture in which I had entertained
