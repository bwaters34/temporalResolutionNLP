 which it affordeth, apply what your worship maketh choyce of, vnto your priuate pleasure, and thus wishing your prosperity, acceptance to this my guilt, and a good opinion of the giuer I conclude, hoping that my honest wish, shall not be voyd of a happy successe. Your Worships, most humble to command discourses, and witty merriments, whereat the quickest wits may laugh and the wiser sort take pleasure In the beginning of Queene Elizabeths most happy raigne, our late deceased Soueraigne, vnder whose peacefull gouerment, long florished this our Country of England : There liued in the Citty of London a merry Cittizen named old Hobson , a haberdasher of smale wares, dwelling at the lower end of cheapside , in the Poultry : as well knowne thorough this part of England , as a Sargeant knows the Counter-gate, he was a homely plaine man, most commonly wearing a buttond cap close to his eares, a short gowne girt hard about his midle and a paire of slippers vpon his feete of an ancient fashion, as for his wealth, it was answerable to the better sort of our Cittizens, but of so mery a disposition, that his equal therein is hardly to be found: hereat let the pleasant disposed people laugh and the more grauer in carriage take no exceptions, for here are merriments without hurt, and humorous iests sauoring vpon wisdome: read willingly, but scoffe not spitefully, for old Hobson spent his dayes merrily. Not many yeares since: there was Sir Iohn Baynes , (by the common voyce of the Citty,) chosen Shriefe of London , which man in former times had beene master Hobsons Prentice, and ridinge alonge the streete with other Aldermen about the Citty businesse, was saluted by Master Hobson in this maner, Bones a God man, what a cock-horse knaue, and thy master a foote, heres the world turnd vpside downe: Sir Iohn Baines hearing this his Masters merry salutation, passed along with a pleasant smyle, makinge no answere at all. Upon slight regard, Master Hobson tooke occasion to say as followeth, heres pride rydes on horse-backe whilste humilitye goes a foote: in speakinge these words, came foure other Alldermen rydinge after Master Shreife whose names were these: Alderman Ramsey , Allderman Bond , Allderman Beecher , and Allderman Cooper , at whose passage by, he made this pleasant rime. 1 Ramsey the rich, 2 Bond the stout. 3 Beecher the gentle-man, 4 and Cooper the loute. This pleasant rime so sodaynely spoken by Master Hobson is to this day accounted for his Proverbe in London Master Hobson being a haberdasher of small wares (as I sayd before)  & his shoppe on a time full of customers, his negligent Prentises, carelessly creditted a kentish pedler with ten pounds of commodities, neither knowing his name nor his dwelling place, which ouersight, when maister Hobson vnderstood, and noting the simplicity of his seruantes, and their forgetfulnes, demanded what apparrell the pedler had on? mary Sir (quoth one of ye prentises) he had on a Taunycote, Then (quoth Maister Hobson ) put downe Iohn tauny cote and so was the pedler, by the name of Iohn tauny cote , entred to the booke, about a month after the same pedler, came againe to London to buy ware, and comming to maister Hobson in a russet cote willed him to turne ouer his booke for ten poundes that one Iohn Rowlands owed him. Ten pounds, (quoth Maister Hobson ) that Iohn Rowlands oweth me, I remember no such man, bones of God knaue, thou owest mee none, but I doe saith the pedler: where vpon the booke was serched, but no Iohn Rowlands was to be found, I thinke thou art mad quoth Hobson , for thou owest me nothing, but I doe quoth the Pedler, and will pay it. Being in this strife a long time one of his seruants said, that hee had found in the booke such a debte by one Iohn tawny cote that is my selfe replyed the Pedler, I was then Iohn tawny cote , though I am now Iohn Russet cote , so paid hee the ten pounds by the same name to Maister Hobson , and receiued twenty more vpon his owne word and name of Iohn Rowland , the which twenty pound, hee shortly after paid for suertyshippe and so by this his ouer kind heart, paying other mens debtes, hee grew so poore, and into such necessity, that he was forced to maintaine his liuing by hedging and ditching and other such like country labours, within a while after this, Maister Hobson comming into kent, to seeke vp some desperate debts, came to Dartford , where finding this poore man ditching for a groat a day, in pitty of him said how now Iohn tawny cote , bones a God man, thou canst neuer pay me with this poore labour, come home knaue, come home I will trust thee with twenty pound more, follow thy old trade of pedling again & one day thou maiest pay me all. Thus the pedler had a new credit of Maister Hobson , by which good meanes he grew rich, that in time he bought his freedome of London, and therein grew so welthy a Cittisen, that he became one of the maisters of the Hospitall and when he died he proued a good benefactor to the same house. Vupon a time Maister Hobson inuited very solemnly ye whol liuery of his company to a light banquet, and for the same prouided the greatest tauerne in all London in a redines: the appoynted houre being come, the Cittizens repaired thether, richly atired, the better to grace Maister Hobsons banquet: but expecting great cheare, and good intertainement, they were all vtterly disapoynted, for what found they there thinke you? nothing on my word, but each one a cup of wine and a manchet of bread on his trencher & some fiue hundred candles lighted about the Roome, which in my mind was a very light banquet both for the belly and for the eye. By this merry Iest, hee gained such loue of his companie, that hee borowed Gratis out of the hall a hundred and fiftie pound for two yeares. Euermore when Maister Hobson had any bussines abroad, his prentises wold ether bee at the tauerne, filling there heads with wine, or at the dagger in cheapeside cramming their bellies with minced pyes, but aboue al other times, it was their common costome (as London prentises vse) to follow their maisters vpon sundays to the Church dore) and then to leaue them and hie vnto the tauerne, which Maister Hobson on a time, perceuing one of his men so to doe, demanded at his comming home, what the Preachers text was: Sir (quoth the fellow) I was not at the beginning, what was in the midle (quoth Maister Hobson ) Sir (qd. the fellow) then was I a sleepe: (said Maister Hobson againe) what was then the conclusion? then Replyed his seruant, I was come sir away before the end: by which meanes he knew well he was not there, but rather in some tipling house offending Gods maiesty and the lawes of the land. Therefore the next Sunday morning after, maister Hobson called all his seruants together, and in the sight of many of his neighbors and their prentises tooke apeece of chauke, & chaukd them all the way along to the Church derectly, which proued a great shame to his owne seruants, but a good example to all others of like condition, after this was there neuer the like misdemenour vsed amongst them. In the beginning of Queene Elizabeaths raigne, when the order of hanging out lanterne and candlelight first of all was brought vp: the bedell of the warde where Maister Hobson dwelt, in a darke euening crieng vp and downe, hang out your lantornes, hang out your lantornes: vsing no other words: wherevpon Maister Hobson tooke an empty lantorne, and according to the beadles call hung it out. This flout by the Lord Maior was taken in ill part, and for the same offence was sent to the counter: but being released, the next night following, the beadle thinking to amend his call: cried with a loud voice hang out your lantorne and candle. maister Hobson here-vpon hung out a lantorne and candle vnlighted, as the beadle againe commanded, where vpon he was sent againe to the counter: but the next night the beadle being better aduised, cryed, hang out your lantorne and candlelight, hang out your lantorne and candle light, which maister Hobson at last did to his great commendations which cry of lanthorne and candlight is in right manner vsed to this day. Not farre from maister Hobsons house, there dwelled one of the cunning men, other wise called fortune tellers, such cossoning companions, as at this day, (by their crafts) make simple women beleeue, how they can tell what husbands they shall haue, how many children, how many sweet harts, and such like: if goods bee stole who hath them, with promise to helpe them to their losses againe: with many other like deceiptfull elusions. To this wise men (as some termes him) goes maister Hobson , not to reap any benefit by his crafty cunning, but to make a Iest and tryall of his experience, so causing one of his seruants to lead a masty dog after him, staying at the cuning mans doore with the dog in his hand vp goes master Hobson to ye wise man, requesting his skil, for he had lost ten pound lately taken from him by theeues, but when and how he knew not well the cunning man knowing maister Hobson to be one of his neighbors, and a man of a good reputation, fell (as he made showe) to coniuring and casting of figures, and after a few words of incantation, as his common vse was, he tooke a very large faire looking glasse, and bad Maister Hobson to looke in the same, but not to cast his eyes backward in any case; the which hee did, and therein saw the picture of a huge and large oxe with two broad hornes on his head, the which was no other wise, (but as hee had often deceitfully shewd to others) a cossoning fellow like the cunning man himselfe, clothed in an oxe hide, which fellow he maintained as his seruant to blinde the peoples eyes withall, and to make them beleeue hee could shew them the Diuill at his pleasure in a glasse: this vision maister Hobson perceuing, & gessing at the knauery thereof, gaue a whistle for his dog which then stayed below at the doore in his mans keeping, which whistle being no sooner hard but the dog ran vp stayers to his maister as he had beene mad and presently fastned vpon the poore fellow in the oxe hide, and so tore him as it was pittifull to see: the cunning man cried for the passion of God take off your dog. no (quoth Maister Hobson ) let the Diuill and the dogge fight, venture thou thy deuill and I will venture my dog. To coclude the oxe hide was torne from the fellows backe and so their knaueryes were discouered, and their cunning shifts layd open to the world. market. As Mai. Hobson increased in riches, so increased his wife in pride, in such sort that she would seldom goe out of doores without her man before her, vpon a time hauing buissnes to cheapside market amoungst many other of her neighbors, the more to shew her haughty stomack, desired of her husband that she might haue her man to attend her: who seeing her disposition, willingly consented thereunto: and therevpon called two of his lustiest men, put them in armor with two browne bills on their necks, placing one of them before her, the other after, and so proffered to send her forth to market, she in a nicenes, tooke such displeasure hereatt that for a mounth after she lay sicke in her bed, and would eate nothing but caudles made of muskadine. There was a very Rich Cittyzen (dwelling not far from London bridge) whom in his life time was neuer knowne to doe any deed worthy of memorie: who dying, left Maister Hobson his onely executor to dispose of his goods as also to lay vpon his graue a faire marble stone, and as vpon marble stones there bee commonly ingrauen certaine verses in the maner of an epitaph of the mans conuersation there vnder buried, so Maister Hobson considered, what epitaph he would set vpon his friends graue, knowing the few good deeds he did in his life time, caused these two verses following to be ingrauen vpon the marble stone. He was begotten borne, and cryed, He liued long time, fell Sicke, and died. Maister Hobson hauing ocasion to ride into the wild of kent, where in that age Scollers were very scarce, during the time of his taring there, there hapned to be buried one Iohn Medcaufe a very sufficient farmer, vpon whose graue was written these verses following in faire Romaine letters. I desire yee in the Lords behalfe, To pray for the soule of poore Iohn Caufe. Maister Hobson noting the simplicity of the verses writ vnderneath as foloweth, O thou death more futtell then a foxe, Thou mighst a let this caufe liued to be an oxe, To haue, eat, grasse, hay and corne, And like his Sire to haue wore a horne. Maister Hobson hauing in France a factor which dealt for him in marchandise, and lacking diuers sorts of wares, to furnish his chapmen for Bristowe farre, sent to his a fore said factor (being a mery conceited youth) for certaine matches of such commodities as were then most in request: he mistaking his maisters meaning, sent him all the matches, vsed for gun-pouder that could be bought in France , to thy valew of two thousand poundes worth, Master Hobso receauing them, and seing himselfe matcht with a commodyty of matches, thought all was not well in France , and that his man necklected his busines there. To know the truth thereof, the next morning very early, not reuealing it to his wife, in a night gowne, a buttoned cap, and in a payre of slippers: tooke shipping at billinsgate, and so passed ouer into France , where after some inquiry made, of his mans life and conuersation he found him in a lewdhouse, reueling with a most gallant French curtezan, whome Maister Hobson after a smile or two saluted in this manner what now knaue: what a wenching knaue? at rack and manger knaue? bones of me cannot a snatch and a way serue your turne knaue? is this the French wares you deale withall knaue? his man seeing himselfe so taken napping, for a time stood amazed, not knowing what to say, but recouering his sences, he gaue his maister this pleasant answere though Sir this ware is a broken commodity yet may wee deale with them, being dealers with all wares or rather haberdashers of small wares, which is sildome lik'd of French gentlewoman: Maister Hobson at this plesant answere could not choose but pardon him, and so came they both ouer into England , where now this rack and a manger is growne to a prouerbe. The commodity of matches which his factor sent him from France , being slow of saile, cosidering the little vse for them being a time of peace, like a witty Cittizen, Maister Hobson hies himselfe to court to the Queene Elizabeth for then she raigned, and hauing a pattent ready made for the sale of the aforesaid matches, where so soone as hee came into the Queenes presence, hee kneeled downe, and desired her grace to giue an asignement to his pattent declaring what it was and ye great losse he was like to sustaine by that commodity, the Queene perceauing for what intent he came, and considering the great benefit that would come by such a grant, & meaning to giue it to some gentlman nere vnto hir, as a recompence for his seruice, said vnto Maister Hobson , my friend (sayd the Queene,) bee content for thou shalt not haue thy pattent sealed, nor will I giue thee thy request, Maister Hobson hearing the Queenes denial said, I most hartely thanke your maiesty, both I and all mine, are bound to thanke and pray for your highnes: and so making lowe obeysance, went his way: at these his wo ds, the Queene much maruailed, and when he had gone a litle from her, she caused him to be sent for backe againe, whome when he was returned, the Queene asked, if he did well vnderstand what answer her grace did giue him, yes truely saide Maister Hobson , what said I (quoth the Queene?) marry your grace bad me be content for I should not haue my desire, nor my pattent sealed, why did your then (qd. the Queene) giue me such great thanks? because (sayd Maister Hobson ) your grace gaue mee so soone an answere without either longer sute, or losse of time, the which would haue bene to my very much harme and great hinderance, for I haue at home a mighty charge of househould, to which I am bound in duety to looke diligently, and to maintaine carefully. The Queene marking well the wisdom and discreet answer of Maister Hobson , and now conceauing a new fauour towards him, sayd, now shall you giue me twice thanks, for you shall haue your pattent sealed, and your desiers performed that you sue for. So casting her eyes vpon the Lord chauncelour commaunded the same by him to be done, which was accomplished with all speede, whereby in short time, hee had quicke saile of his commodity of matches to his hearts content, and his welthes great encrease. Vpon Satint Hewes day being the seuententh of Nouember vpon which day the tryumph was holden for Queene Elizabeths hapy gouermet, as bonfiers ringing of bells & such like, but in the Parish where Maister Hobso dwelled he being Churchwarden) was no ringing at all, by reason the steeple was a mending and the bells downe, and being asked by a seruant of the Qeuenes house why they Ringed not? hee answered, because they had no bels in their steeple, then qd the Queens man, may you very wel sel a way your steeple, why so qd. Maister Hobson because quoth the other it standet emty and vaant to whom maister Hobson replyed againe, we may better sell awaye our pulpet, for these twelue mounths was there neuer a sermon in the same and it rather stands empty and vacant after this the parson of the church preached euery Sonday following. A poore begger man, that was foule, blacke, and loathsome to behould, came on a time to Maister Hobson as he walked in Moore feelds, and asked something of him for an almes, to whom Maister Hobson said, I prethee good fellow get thee from me, for thou lookst as thou camst lately out of hell, the poore begger man perceuing, hee would giue him nothing, answered forsooth. Sir you say true, for I came lately out of Hell indeed, why didst not thou tarry there still quoth maister Hobson , nay Sir quoth the begger, there is no Roome for such begerr men as I am, for all is kept for such gentlemen Cittizens as you be: this wity answere caused Maister Hobson to giue the poore man a teaster. Maister Hobson had a daughter which was a very faire & young woman, the which for her husband that laye a dying, made great sorrow and lamentation, and would not bee comforted by any perswasions, wherefore her father came to her and sayd, daughter leaue of your mourning, for if God take away your husband: I will speedily prouide you another of as great a welth & credit as he is now of, and farre more young and lusty, but yet for all this would shee not leaue mourning, and grew greatly displeased that her father made any motion of another husband, protesting that she would neure marry more. But now marke the variable minds of women, her husbad was no sooner dead and buried, the charges of his buriall paid for, and shee with her friends set at supper to comfort her, betweene sobbing and weeping, she whispered her father in the eare and said, father where is the same man, that ye said should bee my husband thus may you see (quoth Maister Hobson , the nature of women kind, & how long they mourne for their husbandes after they bee dead: these words made the yong woman neuer after to aske her father for a husband. Maister Hobson hauing one of his Prentices new come out of his time and being made a free man of London, desired to set vp for himself, so taking a house not far from Saint Laurence lane, furnished it with store of ware, & set the signe of the Mayden head: hard by was a very rich man of the same trade, had the same signe, and reported in euery place where he came, that ye yong man had set vp ye same signe that he had, onely to get a way his customers & dayly vexed the yong man therewithall, who being greued in mind, made it knowne to Maister Hobson his late maister who comming to the rich man said, I maruell Sir (quoth Maister Hobson ) why you wrong my man so much as to say he seketh to get away your customers, mary so he doth (quoth the other) for he hath set vp a signe called the maiden head as mine is, that is not so (replied (Maister Hobson ,) for his is the widdoes head, and no mayden head, therfore you do him great wrong: the rich man hereupon seing himselfe requited with mocks rested satisfied, and neuer after that enuied Maister Hobsons man, but let him liue quietly. Vpon a time Maister Hobson going to my Lord Maiors to dinner amongst the liuery of his company, and being waited on by one of his prentices: the said prentise spied a louse creeping vpon the side of his gowne and tooke it off: maister Hobson espying him to doe some thing in secret, asked what it was? the fellow being ashamed, was loath to tell him, but being importuned by his maister said it was a louse: oh (qd. Maister Hobson ) this is good lucke: for it sheweth me to be a man, for this kind of vermine chiefly breedeth on mankind, and there-vpon gaue fiue shillings to his man for his labour: another of his Prentises being a pickthanke-knaue and hauing hard that his fellow had fiue shilings giuen him for taking a louse from of his maister (hauing his gowne likewise on) and made as though he tooke a flea from the same, & conuayed it priuily away, but when maister Hobson constrayned him to tell what it was, with much dissembling shamefastnes he said it was a flea: Maister Hobson perceuing his disimulation said to him, what dost thou make mee a dogge? for fleas be most commonly bread vpon dogs: and so the fiue shillinges he lookd for he had giuen fiueteene stripes: for quoth maister Hobson , there is great difference betweene one that doth a thing with a good mind, and him that doth a thing by disimulation Maister Hobson had a seruant that hee had long before made a freeman and was still at maister Hobsons commaundment & did him much good seruice, wherfore vpon a time hee came vnto his maister and said, Sir, I haue done your seruce long time iust and truly, wherefore I pray you bestowe some thing vpon mee to begin the world with all, fellow, quoth maister Hobson thou sayst true, & hereon haue I thought many times to doe a good turne, now will I tell thee what thou shalt doe, I must shortly ride to Bristowe faire, and if thou wilt beare my charges thether, I will giue thee such a thing, as shall be worth to thee a hundred pounds: I am content (quoth the fellowe) so all the way as hee Road, his man bore his charges, & paid for all things dewly, till they came to their last lodging and there after supper he came to his maister & said: Sir, I haue borne your charges as you commanded me, now I pray you let me know what the thing is that will be worth to me a hundred pounds? did I promise thee such a thing (quoth his maister) you did (quoth the fellow,) shew it me in wrighting (quoth his master) I haue none (qd. the fellow) then thou art like to haue nothing (quoth his maister) and learne this of me, when so euer thou makest a bargaine with any man, looke that thou take a wrighting for thy security, and be wel aduised how thou giuest thy bond to any man, this thing hath benefitted me in my time a hundred pounds, and so may it likewise do thee: Thus when the poore fellow saw there was no remedy, he held him selfe content, and all that night pondred in his mind how to grow quittance with his maister so on the morrow whe his maister had dispatched his buissines in the towne & was set forward back again towards London, he taried a litle behind to recon with the hostes where he lay, and of her he borrowed as much mony, on his maisters cloke as came to all the charges that they spent by the way: Maister Hobson had not riden past two miles but that it begon to raine, wherupon he called for his cloke of another seruat that rod- by, who said that it was behind with his fellow, who had it with him: so they tooke shellter vnder a tree, till he ouer tooke them, when he was come, maister Hobson most angerly, sayd: thou knaue why comst not thou away with my cloke: Sir and please you (quoth the poore fellow (I haue layd it to pawne for your charges all the way: why knaue quoth maister Hobson , didest not thou promisse to beare my charges to Bristowe : did I quoth the fellow? yes (quoth maister Hobson ) that thou didest, shew me a wrighting then therefore (said the fellow) wherevnto Maister Hobson (seeing him selfe so cunningly ouerreached) answered but litle. Maister Hobson on a time in company of one of his neighbors roade from London towards Sturbrige faire, so the first night of there iorny they lodged at Ware in an Inne where great store of Company was, and in the morning when euery man made him ready to ride, and some were on horsbacke setting forward, the Cittizen his neighbour found him sitting at the Inne gate booted and spurd in a browne studdy, to whome hee saide, for shame Maister Hobson why sitte you heare, why doe you not make your selfe redy to horse backe, that we may set forward with company? Maister Hobson replyed in this manner, I tarry (quoth he) for a good cause: for what cause quoth his neighbour: mary quoth Master Hobson here be so many horses, that I cannot tell which is mine owne, and I know well, when euery man is ridden and gone the horse that remaneth behind, must needs be mine. There was a certaine farmer that lost forty pounds betwixt Cambridg and Londo , and being so great a summe, he made proclamation in all market Townes thereabouts, that whoso euer had found forty and fiue pounds, should haue the fiue pounds for his labour for finding it, and therefore he put in the fiue pound more the was lost, it was Maister Hobsons fortune to find the same some of forty pounds, and brought the same to the baylife of Ware & required the fiue pounds for his paines as it was proclaymed: when the country farmer vnderstood this, and that he must needs pay fiue pounds for the finding, he sayd that there was in the purse fiue and forty pounds, and so would hee haue his owne mony and fiue pounds ouer, so long they stroue that the matter was brought before a Iustice of peace which was then one Maister Fleetwood , who after was Recorder of London: but when Maister Fleetewood , vnderstood by the bayleife, that the proclamation was made for a purse of fiue and forty pound, he demanded where it was here quoth the baylie, and gaue it him, is it iust forty pound said Maister Fleete Wood , yes truly (quoth the bayleife): here maister Hobson , sayd Ma. Fleetwood , take you this mony for it is your owne, and if you chance to find a purse of fiue and forty pound bring it to this honest farmer, that is mine quoth the farmer for I lost iust forty pound, you speake to late (quoth maister Fleetewood ) thus the farmer lost the mony, and maister Hobson had it according to iustice. There dwelled not farre from Maister Hobson , two very ancient women the youngest of them both, was aboue three-score yeares of age, and vppon a time sitting at the tauerne together, they grew at varience which of them should be the youngest, (as women indeede desier to bee accounpted younger then they be) in such manner that they layd a good supper, of the valew of twenty shillings, for the truth thereof, and Maister Hobson they agreed vpon to bee their Iudge of the difference: so after Maister Hobson had knowledge thereof, the one, came to him, and as a present gaue him a very faire pidgion pye, worth some fiue shillings desiering him to passe the vardet of her side: within a while after the other came, and gaue maister Hobson a very faire grayhound, which kind of dogges he much delighted in: praying him likewise to be fauorable on her side wherefore hee gaue iudgment that the woman that gaue him the grayhound was the yonger, and so she woun the supper of twenty shillings which she perceiuing, came to him and sayd (Sir, I gaue you a pidgion pie, and you promised the verdit should goe on my side. To whome maister Hobson said, of a truth good woman, there came a grayhound into my house, and eate vp the pidgion pye, and so by that meanes I quite forgot thee. Maister Hobsons wife carrying something a stately mind, and delighting in braue apprell, vpon a time walking abroad with other women her neighbours, they espied a payre of silke stockins vpon her legges and desiring the like, neuer let their husbands to liue in quiet after, til they had silke stockins of the same fashion: so within a weeke or two following, their husbandes came complayning to maister Hobson and said, Sir, (quoth one of them) the sufferance of your wiues pride, hath spoyled all ours, for since she hath worne silke stockings, our wiues haue growne so importunate, that they must needs haue the like, and you are the cheifest cause in suffering her to weare the same: Oh my good neighbours, (qd. M. Hobso ) I haue great cause in doing so and it bringes me much quietnes, as how (qd. one of them) mary thus (neighboures) for seeing I cannot please her aboue the knee, I most needs please her belowe the knee, and the only thing to please a woman is to let her haue her will. Vpon a new yeares day Maister Hobson sitting at dinner in a Poets company, or one as you may tearme him a writer of histories, there came a poore man and presented him a cople of orringes, which hee kindly tooke as a new yeares guift, and gaue the poore man for the same, an angell of gould, and therevpon gaue it his wife to lay it vp among other Iewells, considering that it had likewise cost him an angel, the which he did, the Poet siting by and marking the bounty of Ma. Hobson for so small a matter, he went home and deuised a booke contayning forty sheets of paper which was halfe a yeare in writing, and came and gaue it to Maister Hobson in dedication, and thought in his mind, that he in- recompencing the poore man so much for an orringe would yeeld far more recompence for his booke, being so long in studying. Maister Hobson tooke the Poets booke thankfully, and perseuing he did it onely for his bounty shewed for the orring giuen him: willed his wife to fetch the said oringe, which he gaue to the Poet, being then almost rotten, saying, here is a Iewell which cost me a thousand times the worth in gould, therefore I thinke thou art well satisfied for thy bookes dedication: the poet seing this, went his way all ashamed. benefit. Maister Hobson beeing still very good to poore and most bountyfull to aged people, there came to him vsually twice or thrice a weeke a silly poore ould blinde man to sing vnder his window, for the which he continually gaue him twelue pence a time. Maister Hobson hauing one of his seruants so chorlish and withall so couitous that he would suffer the blind man to come no more vnles he shard halfe his benefit: the which the blind singing man was forst to giue, rather then to loose all: after twice or thrice parting shares, Maister Hobson had there of intelligence, who consulting with the blind man, serued his seruant in this maner, still he looked for halfe whatsoeuer he got, so this at last was Maister Hobsons guift, who gaue commaundement that the blind man should haue for his singing three-score Ieerkes with a good whippe, and to be equally parted as the other guifts were, the which were presently giuen: the blinde mans were but easie, but Master Hobsons mans were very sound ones, so that euery Ierke drewe bloud, after this he neuer sought to deminish his masters bounty. In Christmas holy dayes when Ma. Hobsons wife had many pyes in the ouen, one of his seruats had stole one of them out: & at the tauerne had merrilie eate it, it fortund that same day, some of his frieds dined with him, & one of the best pyes were missing, the stealer whereof, at after dinner he found out in this maner: he caled all his seruants in friendly sort together into the hall, and caused each of them to drinke one to another both wine, ale, and beare till the were al drunke, then caused hee a table to be furnished with very good cheare, whereat hee likewise pleased them, being set all together, he said, why sit you not downe fellowes, we be set allredy quoth they: nay quoth Maister Hobson he that stole the pye is not set yet, yes that I doe (quoth he that stole it (by which meanes he knew what was become of the pye, for the poore fellow being drunke could not keepe his owne secretts. Vpon a time when Maister Hobson lay sicke, and in very great payne, there came vnto him a Doctor of Phisicke, that tould him he could not escape but must needs die of that sicknes, Maister Hobson a while after, not by the Doctors helpe, but by the will of God, recouered, and was whole of his disease, yet was he very lowe, and bare brought, and as he walked forth on a day, he met the said Doctor which doubting whether it ware the sicke man or no, sayd (are not you Sir the man called maister Hobson ? yes trewly (quoth he) are you aliue or dead sayd the Doctor, I am dead quoth Maister Hobson , what doe you here then sayde the Doctor, I am here quoth Maister Hobson , because I haue experience in many earthly things and God hath sent me to the world againe, with a commandement to take vp all Phisitions that I can get and send them thether to him, which saying made Maister Doctor as pale as ashes for feare, Maister Hobson seing this sayd vnto him, feare not Maister Doctor though I said all phisitions, for you are none, and there is no man that hath witte will take you for one: therfore you are not in my charge: farewell In the rainge of Queene Mary , when this land was blinded with supersition, there was a Popish Frier that made an oration in the charterhouse yard, where many formes were placed full of people, to here the same oration, amoungst which number sat Maister Hobson , which Fryer much extolling him that was then Pope of Rome , comparing him to Saint Peter , for in degree he names him aboue all ye holy Fathers in time past as Doctors, marters, Prophets, yea and aboue more then Prophets, Iohn Baptist , then in what high place sayd the Frier shall we place this good man, what place I say is fit for him or where shall he sit? Master Hobson hearing him speake so prophanly and sitting amongst the Audience, start vp and sayd, if thou canst find no other. then set him here in my place, for I am weary, and so went his way. Vpon a time Maister Hobson lying in saint Albones, there came certaine musitions to play at his chamber doore, to the intent as they filled his ears with their musicke, he should fil their purses with mony: where vpon he bad one of the seruants of the Inne (that waited vpon him (to goe and tell them, that hee could not then indure to heare their musicke for he mourned for the death of his mother, so the musitians disapoynted of their purpose went sadly all a way, The fellow heard him speake of mourning, asked him how long agoe it is since he buried his mother, truely (quoth master Hobson ,) it is now very neare forty yeares agoe, the fellow vnderstanding his subtilty, and how wittily he sent away the musitians: laughed very hartely. Master Hobson had a seruant so couetous, and withall so simple witted, that all the money he could gather together, he hid in the ground, of the which Maister Hobson hauing some inteligence fell a coniuring for it in this maner, with a good wand he so belabored my yong man, that he presently reuealed where it lay: the which summe of money master Hobson tooke quite away, all sauing a smale summe, the which the poore fellow put to so good a vse, in buying and selling, that in short time he greatly increased it: when master Hobson vnderstood what he had done, and what good vse he put his money too, sayd, Sirra, you can tell how to vse money, and learne to make profit thereof: I will restore to thee all againe and and so he did, which made the fellow euer after a good husband. Vpon a time, when master Hobso had sore eyes, there came a certaine Phisition to him, thinking to haue some recompence for his councell, warning him that he should in any case forbeare drinking, or ells by the same loose his eyes, to whom Master Hobson sayde, it is much more pleasure for me to loose my eyes with drinking then to keepe them for worms to eate them out: another time a phisition came to maister Hobson and said, Sir you looke well, and greeue at nothing, and haue a healthfull countenance, true (quoth maister Hobson ) for I haue not to doe with any Phisitions, nor with Phisicke: to whom he replied. Sir said he you haue no cause to blame the phisition, for his Phisicke neuer did you hurt, thou saist true quoth maister Hobson , for if I had proued Phisicke, I had not beene now heare aliue: another Phisition, came to him on a time and said, Sir you be a very ould man, (very trew quoth maister Hobson ,) for thou wert neuer my Phisition, such maner of checkes and floutes would he stil giue to them that spoke to him of Phisicke, for in all his life hee neuer tooke any. Maister Hobson , and another of his neighbours on a time walking to Southwarke faire, by chance drunke in a house, which had the signe of Sa. Christopher , of the which signe the good man of the house gaue this commendation, Saint Christopher (quoth he when hee liued vpon the earth bore the greatest burden that euer was, which was this, he bore Christ ouer a riuer, nay there was one (quoth maister Hobson ,) that bore a greater burden, who was that (quoth the in-keeper, mary quoth Maister Hobson , the asse that bore both him and his mother: so was the Inne-keeper called asse by craft. After this talking merely together, the aforsaid Inne keeper being a litle whitled with drinke  & his head so giddy that he fell into the fire, people standing by ran sodainely and tooke him vp, oh let him alone (quoth Maist Hobson ,) a man may doe what he will in his owne house, and lie where so euer he listeth, the man hauing little hurt, with this fight grew immediately sober, and after foxed Maister Hobson and his neighbour so mightely, that comming ouer London bridge being very late ranne against one of the cheane posts, at which Maister Hobson thinking it to bee some man that had iustled him, drew out his dodgion dagger and thrust it vp into the very hillts into the hollow post, where-vpon verely hee had thought he had kil'd some man: so runing away was taken by the watch, and so all the Iest was discouered. Vpon a time Ma. Hobson had arested one of my L. Maiors kinsmen for a certaine det owing him, and being in the counter my Lord Maior sent one of his officers for to intreat Maister Hobson to be- fauorable to his kinsman, telling a long tale, and to little purpose, whome maister Hobson answered in this manner, my friend (quoth he) what thou saydst in the beginning I doe not like of: and what was in the middle, I doe not well remember, and for thy conclution, I vnderstand It not: and this was all the fauour maister Hobson shewed to my Lord Maiors kinsman. This maister Hobson on a time had a seruant that was ouer full of words, and too much talkatiue, being offended there with gaue him still in charge, to say nothing, and to answer to that hee was demaunded and no more: so vpon a day maister Hobson made a great diner, and sent his said seruant some two dayes, before to inuite an Alderman of London there-vnto, so vpon the day when diner time came, all the guestes stayd for the said Alldermans comming till two of the clocke, and so at last maister Hobson , sayd vnto his seruant: didst thou bid maister Alderman to diner? yes truly (said he,) why cometh he not then? (quoth maister Hobson ) mary (quoth the fellow) he said hee could not: why touldst thou not me so quoth maister Hobson ? because quoth the fellow, you did not aske me? here-vpon (though long first) they went all to diner, and being mery together drinking of wine there came in a certaine ruffen and stole one of the fairest silluer cupps away the which the fellow seing, said neuer a word but let him goe, which when maister Hobson missed, he demanded of his seruant where it was Sir (quoth the fellow,) a theefe came in and stole it a way: why didst not thou stay him (qd. maister Hobson ?) mary sir, (quoth he) because he asked no question of me, after this, maister Hobson noting the simplenes of his seruant let him haue his toung at free liberty. In the raing of Queene Mary , when great superstition was vsed in England , as creeping to the crosse, worshipping of Images and such like, it was Maister Hobsons chaunce amongst other people to be in the Church, and kneeling to an Image to pray, as it was then vsed, the same Image by some mishapp fell downe vpon Maister Hobson and broke his head, vpon which occatio he came not thether in halfe an yeare after but at length by the procurement of his neighbours he came to the Church againe, and because he saw his neighbours kneele before the same Image, he kneeled downe likewise, and said thus, wel I may cap, and kneele to thee, but thou shalt neuer haue my heart againe so long as I liue: meaning for the broken head it had giuen him. On a time Master Hobson vpon some ocation came to Master Fleete woods house to speake with him, being then new chosen the recorder of London, and asked one of his men if he were within and
