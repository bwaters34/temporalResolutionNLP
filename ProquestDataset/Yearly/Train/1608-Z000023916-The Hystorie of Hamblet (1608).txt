 feared  & honored of all men; to beare all the charge and burden vpon his shoulders;   [   The miserable condition of such as rule ouer others.  ] to serue and please the fantasies of the common people; to liue continually in feare, & to see himself exposed to a thousand occasions of danger; and most commonly assailed and spoiled, when hee thinkes verily to hold Fortune as slaue to his fantasies & will: & yet buyes such and so great misery, for the vaine & fraile pleasures of this world, with the losse of his owne soule: making so large a measure of his conscience, that it is not once mooued at any murther, treason, deceit, nor wickednes whatsoeuer he comitted, so the way may be opened and made plaine vnto him, whereby hee may attaine to that miserable filicitie, to command and gouerne a multitude of men (as I said of Romulus ) who by a most abhominable action,    [   Romulus for small or no cause, killed his brother.  ] prepared himselfe a way to heauen (but not by vertue.) The ambitious and seditious Orator of Rome , supposed the degrees and steps to heauen,    [   Cicero in his Paradoxes.  ] & the wayes to vertue, to consist in the treasons, rauishments & massacres comitted by him, that first layd the foundations of that citty. And not to leaue the hystories of Rome ;    [   Tarquin the elder slaine in Rome.  ] what I pray you incited Ancius Martinus , to massacre Tarquin the elder, but the desire of raigning, as a king: who before had bin the onely man to moue  & solicite the saide Tarquinius , to bereaue the right heires and inheriters thereof? what caused Tarquinius the proud,    [   Seruius Tullius slaine by his sonne in law.  ] traiterously to imbrue his hands in the blood of Seruius Tullius , his father in law, but onely that fumish and vnbridled desire, to be commander ouer the Cittie of Rome ? which practise neuer ceased nor discontinued, in the said principall Cittie of the Empire, as long as it was gouerned by the greatest  & wisest personages, chosen and elected by the people:   [   Wherefore Rome was subiect to seditions.  ] for therein haue beene seen infinite numbers of seditions, troubles, pledges, ransommings, confiscations and massacres, onely proceeding from this ground and principle: which entereth into mens hearts, & maketh them couet and desirous to be heads and rulers of a whole common wealth. And after the people were depriued of that libertie of Election, and that the Empire became subiect to the pleasure & fantasie of one man, commanding al the rest, I pray you peruse their bookes, and read diligently their Hystories; & do but looke into the meanes vsed by the most part of their kings and Emperours,   [   Diuers attained to the Empire, by murther.  ] to attaine to such power and authoritie: and you shall see how poysons, massacres, and secret murthers, were the meanes to push them forwards, that durst not openly attempt it, or else could not compasse to make open warres. And for that the Hystory (which I pretend to shew vnto you) is chiefly grounded vpon treason, committed by one brother against the other; I will not erre far out of the matter: thereby desiring to shew you, that it is and hath been a thing long since practised and put in vse by men, to spill the blood of their neerest kinsmen and friends, to attaine to the honour of being great and in authoritie, and that there hath bin some, that being impatient of staying till their iust time of succession, haue hastened the death of their owne parents;   [   Absalon conspired against Dauid his father.  ] as Absolon would haue done to the holy king Dauid his father: and as wee read of Domitian , that poysoned his brother Titus , the most curtious and liberall Prince that euer swayed the Empire of Rome. And God knowes we haue many the like examples in this our time, where the sonne conspired against the father:    [   Zelin slew his father Baiazeth  ] for that Sultan Zelin , Emperour of Turkes, was so honest a man, that fearing Baiazeth his father would die of his naturall death, and that thereby he should haue stayd too long for the Empire, bereaued him of his life:  & Sultan Soliman his successor,    [   Soliman caused Mustapha his sonne to bee hanged.  ] although he attempted not any thing against his father, yet being mooued with a certaine feare to bee deposed from his Emperie, & bearing a hatred to Mustapha his son, (incited therunto by Rustain Bassa (whom the Iewes enemies to the yong prince, had by gifts procured thereunto) caused him to be strangled with a bowe string, without hearing him (that neuer had offended his father) once speake to iustifie his innocencie. But let vs leaue the Turkes like Barbarians as they are, whose throne is ordinarily established by the effusion of the blood of those that are neerest of kindred and consanguinitie to the Empire,  & consider what Tragedies haue bin plaid to the like effect, in the memorie of our Ancestors, and with what charitie and loue the neerest kindreds and friendes among them haue bin intertained; one of the other,   [   Great mischiefe in our age.  ] if you had not the Hystories extant before you, if the memorie were not in a manner fresh, & known almost to euery man, I would make a long discourse therof: but things being so cleare & euidet, the truth so much discouered, [   God stayeth his wrath, but yet reuengeth wrong: read Plucarch Opuscules, of the slownesse of Gods iudgements.  ] & the people almost as it were glutted with such treasons, I will omit them & follow my matter, to shew you; that if the iniquitie of a brother, caused his brother to loose his life, yet that vengeance was not log after delayed: to the end that traitors may know, although the punishment of their trespasses committed, be stayed for awhile, yet that they may assure themselues, that without all doubt they shal neuer escape the puisant and reuenging hand of God: who being slow to anger, yet in the ende doth not not faile to shew some signes and euident tokens of his fearefull iudgement, vpon such as forgetting their duties, shed innocent blood, and betray their Rulers, whom they ought chiefly to honour, serue, and reuerence. troubled you with any other matter, then a Hystorie of our owne time, hauing sufficient tragicall matter to satisfie the minds of men: but because I canxot wel discourse therof, without touching many personages, whom I would not willingly displease; and partly because the Argument that I haue in hand, seemed vnto me a thing worthy to bee offered to our French Nobilitie for the great  & gallant accurrences therein set downe: I haue somewhat strayed from my course, as touching the Tragedies of this our age: and starting out of France and ouer Neitherlanders countries, I haue ventured to visit the Hystories of Denmarke , that it may serue for an example of vertue and contentment to our Nation (whom I specially seeke to please) and for whose satisfaction, I haue not left any flower what soeuer vntasted, from whence I haue not drawne the most perfect and delicate hony, thereby to bind them to my diligence herein: not caring, for the ingratitude of the time present, that leaueth (and as it were reiecteth) without recompence, such as serue the Common-wealth, and by their trauell and diligence honour their Countrey, and illustrate the Realme of France ; so that often times the fault proceedeth rather from them, then from the great personages that haue other affaires which withdraw them from things that seeme of small consequence. Withall, esteeming my selfe more then satisfied, in this contentment and freedome, which I now inioy, being loued of the Nobilitie, for whom I trauell without grudging; fauoured of men of learning & knowledge, for admiring & reuerencing them, according to their worthinesse; and honoured of the common people, of whom although I craue not their iudgement, as not esteeming them of abilitie, to eternize the name of a worthy man, yet I account my self sufficiently happy to haue attained to this felicitie, that fewe or no men refuse, or disdaine to reade my workes, many admiring and wondering thereat: as there are some, that prouoked by enuie, blame and condemne it. To whom I confesse my selfe much bound and beholding, for that by their meanes, I am the more vigelant, and so by my trauell much more beloued and honored, then euer I was: which to mee is the greatest pleasure that I can inioy, and the most abundant treasures in my coffers, wherewith I am more satisfied and contented, then (if without comparison) I enioyed the greatect treasures in all Asia. Now returning to our matter, let vs beginne to declare the Hystorie. How Horuendile and Fengon were made Gouernours of the Prouince of Ditmarse , and how Horuendile marryed Geruth , daughter to Roderick chief K. of Denmark : by whom he had Hamblet : and how after his marriage his brother Fengon slewe him trayterously, and marryed his brothers wife, and what followed. You must vnderstand, that long time before the Kingdome of Denmark receiued the faith of Iesus Christ , and imbraced the doctrin of the Christians,    [ The Danes in times past barbarous and vnciuill. ] that the common people in those dayes were barbarous & vnciuill, and their Princes cruell, without faith or loyaltie: seeking nothing but murther, and deposing (or at the least) offending each other; either in honours, goods, or liues: not caring to ransome such as they tooke prisoners,   [  The crueltie of the Danes. ] but rather sacrificing the to the cruell vengeance, naturally imprinted in their hearts; in such sort, yt if ther were sometime a good prince, or king among them, who beeing adorned with the most perfect gifts of nature, would adict himselfe to vertue, and vse courtesie, although the people held him in admiration (as vertue is admirable to the most wicked) yet the enuie of his neighbors was so great, that they neuer ceased vntill that vertuous man, were dispatched out of the world.   [  Rodericke king of Denmarke. ] King Rodericke as then raigning in Denmarke , after hee had appeased the troubles in the countrey, and driuen the Sweathlanders and Slaueans from thence; he diuided the kingdom into diuers Prouinces, placing Gouernours therein: who after (as the like happened in France) bare the names of Dukes, Marqueses, & Earls, giuing the gouernment of Iutie (at this present called Ditmarsse )   [  Iutie at this time, called then Ditmarsse. ] lying vpon the countrey of ye Cimbrians, in the straight or narrow part of land, that sheweth like a point or cape of groud vpon the sea, which neithward bordereth vpon the countrey of Norway.) Two valiant & warlike Lords, Horuendile and Fengon , sonnes to Geruendile , who likewise had beene Gouernour of that Prouince. Now the greatest honor that men of noble birth could at that time win and obtaine, was in exercising the art of Piracie vpon the seas; assayling their neighbours, & the countries bordering vpon them:   [  Horuendile a king and a Pirate. ] and how much the more they vsed to rob, pill, and spoyle other Prouinces, and Ilands farre adiacent, so much the more their honours and reputation increased and augmented: wherin Horuendile obtained the highest place in his time, beeing the most renouned Pirate that in those dayes scoured the seas, & hauens of the North parts: whose great fame, so mooued the heart of Collere king of Norway,   [ Collere king of Norway. ] that he was much grieued to heare that Horuendile surmounting him in feates of armes, thereby obscuring the glorie by him alreadie obtained vpon the seas: (honor more then couetousnesse of richer, (in those dayes) being the reason that prouoked those barbarian princes, to ouerthrow and vanquish one the other; not caring to be slaine by the handes of a victorious person.) This valiant and hardy king, hauing chalenged Horuendile to fight with him body to body, the combate was by him accepted, with conditions, that hee which should be vanquished, should loose all the riches he had in his ship, and that the vanquisher should cause the body of the vanquished (that should bee slaine in the combate) to be honourably buried, death being the prise and reward of him that should loose the battaile: and to conclude, Collere king of Norway (although a valiant, hardy and couragious prince) was in the end vanquished and slaine by Horuendile :   [  Horuendile slewe Collere. ] who presently caused a Tombe to be erected, and therein (with all honorable obseques fit for a prince) buried the body of king Collere , according to their auncient manner, and superstitions in those dayes, and the conditions of the combate, bereauing the Kings shippes of all their riches, and hauing slaine the kings sister, a very braue and valiant warriour, and ouer runne all the coast of Norway, and the Northren Ilands, returned home againe layden with much treasure, sending the most part thereof, to his soueraigne king Rodericke , thereby to procure his good liking, and so to be accounted one of the greatest fauourites about his maiestie. The King allured by those presents, and esteeming himselfe happy to haue so valiant a subiect, sought by a great fauour and coutesie, to make him become bounden vnto him perpetually, giuing him Geruth his daughter to his wife, of whom he knew Horuendile to bee already much inamored: and the more to honor him, determined himselfe in person to conduct her into Iutie, where the marriage was celebrated according to the ancient manner: and to be briefe, of this marriage proceeded Hamblet ,   [  Hamlet sonne to Horuendile. ] of whom I intend to speake, and for his cause haue chosen to renew this present Hystorie. Fengon brother to this Prince Horuendile , who onely fretting and despighting in his heart at the great honor and reputation wonne by his brother in warlike affaires, but solicited and prouoked (by a foolish ielousie) to see him honored with royall aliance,   [  Fengon his conspiracie against his brother. ] and fearing thereby to bee deposed from his part of the gouernment: or rather desiring to be onely Gouernour: thereby to obscure the memorie of the victories and conquests of his brother Horuendile ; determined (whatsoeuer happened) to kill him, which hee effected in such sort, that no man once so much as suspected him, euery man esteeming that from such and so firme a knot of alliance and consanguinitie, there could proceed no other issue then the full effects of vertue and courtesie: but (as I sayd before) the desire of bearing soueraigne, rule and authoritie, respecteth neither blood nor amitie, nor caring for vertue as being wholly without respect of lawes, or maiestie deuine: for it is not possible that hee which inuadeth the countrey & taketh away the riches of an other man without cause or reason, should know, or feare God. Was not this a craftie and subtile Counsellor? but he might haue thought that the mother, knowing her husbands case, would not cast her sonne into the danger of death. But Fengon hauing secretly assembled certain men, & perceiuing himself strong enough to execute his interprise, Horuendile , his brother being at a banquet with his friends,   [  Fengon killeth his brother. ] sodainely set vpon him, where he slewe him as traiterously, as cunningly he purged himselfe of so detestable a murther to his subiects: for that before he had any violent or bloody handes, or once committed parricide vpon his brother, hee had incestuously abused his wife, whose honour hee ought as well to haue sought and procured, as traiterously he pursued and effected his destruction: and it is most certaine, that the man that abandoneth himselfe to any notorious and wicked action, whereby he becommeth a great sinner, hee careth not to commit much more haynous and abhominable offences, & couered his boldnesse and wicked practise with so great subtiltie and policie, and vnder a vaile of meere simplicitie, that beeing fauoured for the honest loue that he bare to his sister in lawe, for whose sake hee affirmed, hee had in that sort murthered his brother, that his sinne found excuse among the common people, & of the Nobilitie was esteemed for iustice: for that Geruth being as courteous a Princesse, as any then liuing in the North parts, and one that had neuer once so much as offended any of her subiects, either commons, or Courtyers; this adulterer and infamous murtherer, slaundered his dead brother, that hee would haue slaine his wife, and that hee by chance finding him vpon the point ready to doe it, in defence of the Lady had slaine him, bearing off the blows which as then hee strooke at the innocent Princesse, without any other cause of malice whatsoeuer: wherein hee wanted no false witnesses to approoue his act, which deposed in like sort, as the wicked calumniator himselfe protested, being the same persons that had born him company, & were participants of his treason, so that insteed of pursuing him as a parricide, & an incestuous person,   [  Slanderers more honoured in court then vertuous persons. ] al the Courtyers admired and flattered him in his good fortune: making more account of false witnesses and detestable wicked reporters, and more honouring the callumniators, then they esteemed of those that seeking to call the matter in question, and admiring the vertues of the murthered Prince would haue punished the massacrers and bereauers of his life. Which was the cause that Fengon , boldned and incouraged by such impunitie, venture to couple himselfe in marriage with her, whom hee vsed as his Concubine, during good Horuendiles life, in that sort spotting his name with a double vice, and charging his conscience with abhominable guilt, and twofold impietie, as incestuous adulterie, and parricide murther: and that the vnfortunate and wicked woman, that had receaued the honour to bee the wife of one of the valiantest and wisest Princes in the North, imbased her selfe in such vile sort, as to falsifie her faith vnto him, and which is worse, to marrie him, that had bin the tyranous murtherer of her lawfull husband: which made diuers men thinke, that she had beene the causer of the murther, thereby to liue in her adultery without controle. But where shall a man finde a more wicked & bold woman, then a great parsonage, once hauing loosed the bands of honor and honestie? This Princesse who at the first, for her rare vertues and courtesies was honored of al men, and beloued of her husband, as soone as she once gaue eare to the tyrant Fengon , forgot both the ranke she helde among the greatest dames, and the dutie of an honest wife on her behalfe. But I will not stand to gaze and meruaile at women: for that there are many which seeke to blase and set them foorth: in which their writings, they spare not to blame them all for the faults of some one, or fewe women. But I say, that either Nature ought to haue bereaued man of that opinion to accompany with women, endow them with such spirits, as that they may easily support the crosses they endure, without complaining so often and so strangely, seeing it is their owne beastlinesse that ouerthrowes them. For if it be so, that a woman is so imperfect a creature, as they make her to be: and that they know this beast, to bee so hard to bee tamed as they affirme: why then are they so foolish to preserue them, and so dull and brutish as to trust their deceitfull and wanton imbraceings. But let vs leaue her in this extreamitie of lasciuiousnesse, and proceed to shewe you, in what sort the yong Prince Hamlet behaued himselfe, to escape the tyranny of his vncle. How Hamblet counterfeited the mad man, to escape the tyrannie of his vncle, and how he was tempted by a woman (through his vncles procurement) who thereby thought to vnderminde the Prince, and by that meanes to finde out whether he counterfeited madnesse or not: and how Hamblet would by no meanes bee brought to consent vnto her; and what followed. Hamblet perceiuing himselfe to bee in danger of his life, as beeing abandoned of his owne mother, and forsaken of all men; and assuring himselfe that Fengon would not detract the time, to send him the same way his father Horuendile was gone: to begiule the tyrant in his subtilties (that esteemed him to bee of such a minde, that if he once attained to mans estate, he wold not long delay ye time to reuege the death of his father) counterfeiting the mad man with such craft  & subtill practises, that hee made shewe as if hee had vtterly lost his wittes: and vnder that vayle hee couered his pretence, and defended his life from the treasons and practises of the tyrant his vncle. And all though hee had beene at the Schoole of the Romans Prince, who because hee counterfeited himselfe to bee a foole, was called Brutus : yet hee imitated his fashions, and his wisedom. For euery day beeing in the Queenes Palace, (who as then was more carefull to please her whoremaster, then ready to reuenge the cruell death of her husband, or to restore her sonne to his inheritance) hee rent and tore his clothes, wallowing and lying in the durt and mire, his face all filthy and blacke, running through the streets like a man distraught, not speaking one worde, but such as seemed to proceede of madnesse, and meere frenzie, all his actions and iestures beeing no other, then the right countenances of a man wholly depriued of all reason and vnderstanding: in such sort, that as then hee seemed fitte for nothing, but to make sport to the Pages, and ruffling Courtiers, that attended in the court of his vncle and father in law. But the yong Prince noted them well enough, minding one day to bee reuenged in such manner, that the memorie thereof should remaine perpetually to the world. Beholde, I pray you, a great point of a wise, and braue spirite in a yong Prince, by so great a shewe of imperfection in his person for aduancement, and his owne imbasing and despising, to worke the meanes and to prepare the way for himselfe to bee one of the happiest Kings in his age. In like sort, neuer any man was reputed by any of his actions more wise and prudent then Brutus , [  Brutus esteemed wise, for counterfeiting the foole. Read Titus Liuius, and Halicarnassus. ] dissembling a great alteration in his minde, for that the occasion of such his deuise of foolishnesse, proceeded onely of a good and mature counsell and deliberation; not onely to preserue his goods, and shunne the rage of the proude Tyrant, but also to open a large way to procure the banishment and vtter ruine of wicked Tarquinius , and to infranchise the people (which were before oppressed) from the yoake of a great and miserable seruitude. And so not onely Brutus , but this man and worthy prince, to whom wee may also adde King Dauid ,   [  Dauid counterfeited the mad man, before king Athes. ] that counterfeited the madde man among the petie kings of Palestina , to preserue his life from the subtill practises of those kings. I shew this example, vnto such as beeing offended with any great personage, haue not sufficient meanes to preuaile in their intents, or reuenge the iniurie by them receaued: but when I speake of reuenging any iniury receiued, vpon a great personage, or superior: it must bee vnderstood by such an one as is not our soueraigne,  1 againste whome wee maie by no meanes resiste, nor once practise anie Treason, nor conspiracie against his life: and hee that will followe this course, muste speake and doe all things whatsoeuer that are pleasing and acceptable to him whom hee meaneth to deceiue, practise his actions, and esteeme him aboue all men, cleane contrarye to his owne intent and meaning, for that is rightly to playe and counterfeite the foole, when a man is constrained to dissemble, and kisse his hand, whome in hearte hee could wishe an hundred foote depth vnder the earth so hee mighte neuer see him more: if it were not a thing wholly to bee disliked in a christian, who by no meanes ought to haue a bitter gall, or desires infected with reuenge. Hamblet in this sorte counterfeiting the madde man, many times did diuers actions of great and deepe consideration, and often made such and so fitte answeres, that a wise man would soone haue iudged from what spirite so fine an inuention mighte proceede, for that standing by the fire and sharpning sticks like poynards and prickes, one in smiling manner asked him wherefore he made those little staues so sharpe at the points,   [ A subtill answere of prince Hamlet .   ] I prepare (saith he) piersing dartes, and sharpe arrowes, to reuenge my fathers death, fooles as I said before, esteemed those his words as nothing, but men of quicke spirits, and such as hadde a deeper reache began to suspect somewhat, esteeming that vnder that kinde of folly there lay hidden a greate & rare subtilty, such as one day might bee preiudiciall to their prince, saying that vnder colour of such rudenes he shadowed a crafty pollicy, and by his deuised simplicitye, he concealed a sharp and pregnant spirit, for which cause they counselled the king to try, & know if it were possible, how to discouer ye intent & meaning of ye yog prince, & they could find no better,   [  Nature corrupted in man ] nor more fit inuetion to intrap him then to set some faire, and beawtifull woman in a secret place, that with flattering speeches and all the craftiest meanes she could vse, should purposely seek to allure his mind to haue his pleasure of her: for the nature of all young men,   [  Subtilties vsed to discouer Hamblets madnes. ] (specially such as are brought vp wantonlie) is so transported with the desires of the flesh, and entreth so greedily into the pleasures therof, that it is almost impossible to couer ye foul affectio neither yet to dissemble or hyde the same dy art or industry, much lesse to shunne it. what cunning or subtilty so euer they vse to cloak theire pretence, seeing occasion offered, and that in secret, specially in the most inticing sinne that rayneth in man, they cannot chuse (being constrayned by voluptuousnesse, but fall to naturall effect and working. To this end certaine courtiers were appointed to leade Hamblet into a solitary place within the woods, whether they brought the woman, inciting him to take their pleasures together, and to imbrace one another, but ye subtill practises vsed in these our daies, not to try if men of great account bee extract out of their wits, but rather to depriue them of strength, vertue, and wisedome, by meanes of such diuelish practitioners, and intefernall spirits their domestical seruants, and ministers of corruption: and surely the poore prince at this assault had bin in great danger, if a gentleman (that in Horuendiles time had bin nourished with him) had not showne himselfe more affectioned to the bringing vp he had receiued with Hamblet , desirous to please the Tirant, who by all meanes sought to intangle the sonne in the same nets wherein the father had ended his dayes. This Gentleman bare the courtiers (appointed as aforesaide of this treason) company, more desiring to giue the prince instructions what he should do, then to intrap him making full account that the least showe of perfect sence and wisedome that Hamblet should make, would be sufficient to cause him to loose his life: and therfore by certain signes, he gaue Hamblet intelligence, in what danger hee was like to fall if by any meanes hee seemed to obaye, or once like the wanton toyes, & vicious prouocations of the gentlewoman, sent thither by his Uncle: which much abashed the prince, as then wholy beeing in affection to the Lady, but by her he was likewise informed of the treason, as being one that from her infancy loued and fauoured him, and would haue been exceeding sorrowfull for his misfortune, and much more to leaue his companie without inioying the pleasure of his body, whome shee loued more then her selfe. The Prince in this sort hauing both deceiued the courtiers, and the Ladyes expectation, that affirmed and swoore that hee neuer once offered to haue his pleasure of the woman, although in subtilty hee affirmed the contrary: euery man there vpon assured theselues that without all doubt hee was distraught of his sences, that his braynes were as then wholly void of force, and incapable of reasonable apprehension so that as then Fengons practise took no effect: but for al that he left not off: still seeking by al meanes to finde out Hamblets subtilty: as in the next chapter you shall perceiue. How Fengon Vncle to Hamblet a second time to intrap him in his pollitick madnes: caused one of his counsellors to be secretly hidden in the Queenes chamber: behind the arras, to heare what speeches past betweene Hamblet and the Queen and how Hamblet killed him, and escaped that danger and what followed. Among the friends of Fengon , ther was one that aboue al the rest,    [  An other subtilty vsed to deceiue Hamblet. ] doubted of Hamblets practises, in counterfeiting the madman, who for that cause said, that it was impossible that so craftie a gallant as Hamblet that counterfeited the foole, should be discouered with so common & vnskilfull practises, which might easily bee perceiued, and that to finde out his politique pretence it were necessary to inuent some subtill and craftie meanes, more atractiue: wherby the gallant might not haue the leysure to vse his accustomed dissimulation, which to effect he said he knewe a fit waie and a most conuenient meane to effect the kings desire, and thereby to intrap Hamblet in his subtilties, and cause him of his owne accord to fall into the net prepared for him, and thereby euidently shewe his secret meaning: his deuise was thus, that King Fengon should make as though he were to goe some long voyage, concerning affayres of great importance and that in the meane time Hamblet should be shut vp alone in a chamber with his mother, wherein some other should secretly be hidden behind the hangings, vnknowne either to him or his mother, there to stand and heere their speeches, and the complots by them to bee taken, concerning the accomplishments of the dissembling fooles pretence, assuring the king that if there were any point of wisedome and perfect sence in the gallants spirit that without all doubte he would easily discouer it to his mother as being deuoid of all feare that she would vtter or make knowne his secret intent, beeing the woman that had borne him in her bodie, and nourished him so carefully, and withall offered himselfe to be the man, that should stand to harken, and beare witnesse of Hamblets speeches with his mother, that hee might not be esteemed a counsellor in such a case, wherein he refused to be the executioner, for the behoofe and seruice of his prince. This inuention pleased the King exceeding well, esteeming it as the onelie, and soueraigne remedie to heale the prince of his lunacie, and to that ende making a long voyage issued out of his pallace, and road to hunt in the forrest, meane time the counsellor entred secretly into the Queenes chamber, and there hid himselfe behind the arras, not long before the Queene and Hamblet came thither,   [   Hamblets subtilty.   ] who beeing craftie and pollitique, as soone as hee was within the chamber doubting some treason, and fearing if he should speake seuerely and wisely to his mother touching his secret practises he should be vnderstood, and by that meanes intercepted, vsed his ordinary manner of dissimulation, and began to come like a cocke beating with his armes, (in such manner as cockes vse to strike with their wings, vpon the hangings of the chamber, whereby feeling something stirring vnder them, hee cried a rat a rat, and presently drawing his sworde thrust it into the hangings, which done, pulled the counsellour (halfe dead) out by the heeles, made an end of killing him, and beeing slaine, cut his bodie in peeces,   [  A cruell reuenge taken by Hamblet vpon him that would haue betraid him. ] which he caused to be boyled and then cast it into an open vaulte or priuie, that so it mighte serue for foode to the hogges, by which meanes hauing discouered the ambushe, and giuen the inuenter thereof his iust rewarde, hee came againe to his mother, who in the meane time wepte and tormented her selfe, to see all her hopes frustrate, for that what fault soeuer she had committed, yet was shee sore grieued, to see her onely child made a meere mockery, euery man reproaching her with his folly, one point whereof she had as then seene before her eyes, which was no small pricke to her conscience, esteeming that the Gods sent her that punishmet,   [  Queene Geruthes repentance. ] for ioyning incestuously in marriage with the tyrrannous murtherer of her husbad, who like wise ceased not to inuent all the means he could, to bring his nephew to his ende, accusing his owne naturall indiscretion as beeing the ordinary guide of those that so much desire the pleasures of the bodie, who shuttting vp the waie to all reason respect not what maie ensue of their lightnes, and greate inconstancy, and how a pleasure of small moment is sufficient to giue them cause of repentance, during their liues, and make them curse the daye and time that euer any such apprehensions, entred into theire mindes, or that they closed theire eies, to reiect the honestie requisite in Ladies of her qualitie, and to despise the holy institution of those dames that had gone before her both in nobility and vertue, calling to mind the   [   Rinde a princes of an admirable chastitie.   ] great prayses and commendations giuen by the Danes to Rinde daughter to King Rothere , the chastest Lady in her time, and withall so shamefast that she would neuer consent to marriage with any prince or knight whatsoeuer, surpassing in vertue all the ladyes of her time, as shee her selfe surmounted them in beawtie, good behauiour and comelines, and while in this sort she sate tormenting her selfe, Hamlet entred into the chamber, who hauing once againe searched euery corner of the same, distrusting his mother aswell as the rest, and perceiuing himselfe to bee alone, began in sober and discreet manner to speak vnto her saying. What treason is this, O most infamous woman! of all that euer prostrated themselues to the will of an abhominable whoremonger who vnder the vail of a dissembling creature couereth the most wicked and detestable crime that man could euer imagine, or was committed. How may I be assured to trust you, that like a vile wanton adulteresse, altogether impudent & giuen ouer to her pleasure, runnes spreading forth her armes ioyfully to imbrace the trayterous villanous tyrant, that murthered my father, and most incestuously receiuest the villain into the lawfull bed of your loyall spouse, impudently entertaining him in steede of the deare father of your miserable and discomforted sonne, if the gods graunt him not the grace speedilie to escape from a captiuity so vnworthie the degree he holdeth, and the race & noble familie of his ancestors. Is this the part of a queene, and daughter to a king? to liue like a bruite beast, (and like a mare that yeeldeth her bodie to the horse that hath beaten hir companion awaye,) to followe the pleasure of an abhominable king, that hath murthered a farre more honester and better man then himself in massacring Horuendile , the honor, and glory of the Danes , who are now esteemed of no force nor valour at all, since the shining splendure of knighthood, was brought to an end by the most wickedest, and cruellest villaine liuing vpon earth? I for my part will neuer account him for my kinsman, nor once knowe him for mine vncle, nor you my deer mother for not hauing respect to the blud that ought to haue vnited vs so straightly together & who neither wt your honor nor without suspitio of cosent to the death of your husbad could euer haue agreed to haue marryed with his cruell enemie: O Queene Geruthe , it is the part of a bitch, to couple with many, and desire acquaintance of diuers mastiffes: it is licentiousnes only that hath made you deface out of your minde the memory of the valor & vertues of the good King your husband and my father: it was an vnbrideled desire that guided the daughter of Roderick to imbrace the Tirant Fengon , & not to remember Horuendile (vnworthy of so strange intertainment), neither that he killed his brother traiterously, and that shee being his fathers wife betrayed him, although he so well fauoured and loued her, that for her sake he vtterly bereaued Norway of her riches and valiant souldiers, to augment the treasures of Roderick , and make Geruthe wife to the hardyest prince in Europe , It is not the parte of a woman, much lesse of a princesse, in whome all modesty, curtesie, compassion and loue ought to abound, thus to leaue her deare child to fortune in the bloody & murtherous hands of a villain and traytor, bruite beasts do not so: for Lyons, Tygers, ounces, and leopards fight for the safety and defence of their whelpes, and birds that haue beakes, claws and wings, resist such as would rauish them of their yong ones, but you to the contrary expose and deliuer mee to death, whereas ye should defend me. Is not this as much as if you should betray me, when you knowing the peruersenes of the tyrant and his intents, ful of deadly counsell as touching the race & image of his brother, haue not once sought nor desired to finde the meanes to saue your child (& only son) by sending him into Swethland, Norway or England , rather then to leaue him as a pray to youre infamous adulterer? bee not offended I praye you Madame, if transported with dolour and griefe I speake so boldely vnto you, and that I respect you lesse then duetie requireth, for you hauing forgotten mee, and wholy reiected the memorye of the deceased K. my father, must not bee abashed if I also surpasse the bounds and limits of due consideration, Beholde into what distresse I am now fallen, and to what mischiefe my fortune and your ouer greate lightnesse, and want of wisedome haue induced mee, that I am constrained to playe the madde man to saue my life in steed of vsing and practising armes, following aduentures, and seeking all meanes to make my selfe knowne to bee the true and vndoubted heire of the valiant and vertuous King Horuendile , it was not without cause, and iuste occasion, yt my gestures, countenances and words seeme all to proceed from a madman, and that I desire to haue all men esteeme mee wholy depriued of sence and reasonable vnderstanding, bycause I am well assured, that he that hath made no conscience to kill his owne brother, (accustomed to murthers, & allured with desire of gouernement without controll in his treasons) will not spare to saue himselfe with the like crueltie, in the blood, & flesh of the loyns of his brother, by him massacred: & therefore it is better for me to fayne madnesse then to vse my right sences as nature hath bestowed the vpon me, The bright shining clearnes therof I am forced to hide vnder this shadow of dissimulation, as the sun doth hir beams vnder some great cloud, when the wether in sommer time ouercasteth: the face of a mad man, serueth to couer my gallant countenance, & the gestures of a fool are fit for me, to ye end that guiding my self wisely therin I may preserue my life for ye Danes & the memory of my late deceased father, for yt the desire of reueging his death is so ingrauen in my heart yt if I dye not shortly, I hope to take such and so great vengeance, that these Countryes shall for euer speake thereof. Neuerthelesse I must stay the time, meanes, and occasion, lest by making ouer great hast, I be now the cause of mine owne sodaine ruine and ouerthrow, and by that meanes, end, before I beginne to effect my hearts desire: hee that hath to doe with a wicked, disloyall, cruell, and discourteous man, must vse craft, and politike inuentions, such as a fine witte can best imagine, not to discouer his interprise:   [  We must vse subtiltie to a disloyall person. ] for seeing that by force I cannot effect my desire, reason alloweth me by dissimulation, subtiltie, and secret practises to proceed therein. To conclude, weepe not (Madame) to see my folly, but rather sigh and lament your owne offence, tormenting your conscience in regard of the infamie that hath so defiled the ancient renowne and glorie that (in times past) honoured Queene Geruth :   [  We must weepe for our owne faults and not for other mens. ] for wee are not to sorrowe and grieue at other mens vices, but for our owne misdeedes, and great follyes. Desiring you, for the surplus of my proceedings, aboue all things (as you loue your owne life and welfare) that neither the king, nor any other may by any meanes know mine intent, and let me alone with the rest, for I hope in the ende to bring my purpose to effect. Although the Queene perceiued her selfe neerly touched, and that Hamlet mooued her to the quicke, where she felt her selfe interessed: neuerthelesse shee forgot all disdaine & wrath, which thereby she might as then haue had, hearing her selfe so sharply chiden, & reprooued, for the ioy she then conceaued, to behold the gallant spirit of her sonne, and to thinke what she might hope, & the easier expect of his so great policie and wisdome. But on the one side she durst not lift vp her eyes to behold him, remebring her offence, & on the other side she would gladly haue imbraced her son, in regard of the wise admonitions by him giuen vnto her, which as then quenched the flames of vnbridled desire, yt before had moued her to affect K. Fengon: to ingraff in her heart ye vertuous actios of her lawfull spouse, whom inwardly she much lamented, when she beheld the liuely image and portraiture of his vertue & great wisedome in her childe, representing his fathers haughtie and valiant heart: and so ouercome and vanquished with this honest passion, and weeping most bitterly, hauing long time fixed her eyes vpon Hamlet , as beeing rauished into some great and deepe contemplation, & as it were wholy amazed; at the last imbracing him in her armes (with the like loue that a vertuous mother may or can vse, to kisse and entertaine her owne childe) shee spake vnto him in this manner. I know well (my Sonne) that I haue done thee great wrong in marrying with Fengon , the cruell tyrant and murtherer of thy father, and my loyall spouse: but when thou shalt consider the small meanes of resistance, and the treason of the Palace, with the little cause of confidence we are to expect or hope for of the Courtiers, all wrought to his will: as also the power hee made ready, if I should haue refused to like of him, thou wouldest rather excuse, then accuse me of lasciuiousnes or inconstancy, much lesse offer me that wrong, to suspect that euer thy mother Geruthe once conseted to the death & murther of her husband: swearing vnto thee (by the maiestie of the Gods) that if it had layne in my power to haue resisted the Tyrant, although it had beene with the losse of my blood, yea and of my life, I would surely haue saued the life of my Lord and husband, with as good a will & desire, as since that time, I haue often beene a meanes to hinder and impeach the shortning of thy life, which being taken away, I will no longer liue here vpon earth: for seeing that thy sences are whole and sound, I am in hope to see an easie meanes inuented, for the reuenging of thy fathers death. Neuerthelesse, mine owne sweet sonne, if thou hast pittie of thy selfe, or care of the memorie of thy father (although thou wilt do nothing for her, that deserueth not the name of a mother in this respect) I pray thee carie thine affayres wisely, bee not hastie, nor ouer furious in thy interprises, neither yet aduance thy selfe more then reason shall mooue thee to effect thy purpose. Thou seest there is not almost any man wherein thou mayest put thy trust, nor any woman to whom I dare vtter the least part of my secrets, that would not presently report it to thine aduersarie, who although in outward shew he dissebleth to loue thee, the better to inioy his pleasures of me, yet hee distrusteth and feareth mee for thy sake, and is not so simple to be easily perswaded, that thou art a foole or mad, so that if thou chance to doe any thing that seemeth to proceed of wisedome or policie (how secretly soeuer it be done) he will presently be informed thereof, and I am greatly afraide that the deuils haue shewed him, what hath past at this present betweene vs: (Fortune so much pursueth and contrarieth our ease and welfare) or that this murther that now thou hast committed, be not the cause of both our destructions, which I by no meanes will seeme to know, but will keepe secret both thy wisedome & hardy interprise. Beseeching the Gods (my good sonne) that they guiding thy heart, directing thy counsels and prospering thy interprise, I may see thee possesse and inioy that which is thy right, and weare the crowne of Denmarke , by the Tyrant taken from thee: that I may reioyce in thy prosperitie, and therewith content my self, seeing with what courage and boldnesse thou shalt take vengeance vpon the murtherer of thy father, as also vpon all those that haue assisted and fauoured him, in his murtherous and bloody enterprise. Madame (sayd Hamlet ) I will put my trust in you, and from hencefoorth meane not to meddle further with your affayres, beseeching you (as you loue your owne flesh and blood) that you will from hence foorth no more esteeme of the adulterer mine enemie, whom I wil surely kill, or cause to be put to death, in despite of all the deuils in hel: and haue he neuer so manie flattering courtezans to defend him yet will I bring him to his death, & they themselues also shall beare him company therein: as they haue bin his peruerse counsellors in the action of killing my father, and his companions in his treason, massacre, and cruell enterprise. And reason requireth, that euen as trayterously they then caused their prince to bee put to death, that with the like (nay well much more) iustice they should pay the interest of their fellonious actions. You know (Madame) how Hother your grandfather,   [  Hother father to Rodericke. Guimon burnt his lord Geuare. ] and father to the good king Roderick , hauing vanquished Guimon , caused him to be burnt, for that the cruell vilain had done the like to his Lord Geuare , whom he betrayed in the night time.   [  Wee must obserue neither faithfulnesse or fidelitie to traytors or Parricides. ] And who knoweth not that traytors and periured pesons deserue no faith nor loyaltie to be obserued towardes them, and that conditions made with murtherers, ought to bee esteemed as cobwebs, and accounted as if they were things neuer promised nor agreed vpon: but if I lay handes vpon Fengon , it will neither be fellonie nor treason, hee being neither my King nor my Lord: but I shall iustly punish him as my subiect, that hath disloyaly behaued himselfe against his Lord & soueraigne prince: and seeing that glory is the rewarde of the vertuous, and the honour and praise of those that doe seruice to their naturall Prince, why should not blame and dishonour accompany Traytors, & ignominious death al those that dare be so bold as to lay violent hands vpon sacred Kings, that are friends & companions of the gods, as representing their maiestie & persons. To conclude, glorie is the crowne of vertue, & the price of constancie, and seeing that it neuer accompanieth with infelicitie, but shunneth cowardize and spirits of base & trayterous conditions, it must necessarily followe, that either a glorious death will be mine ende, or with my sword in hand, (laden with tryumph and victorie) I shall bereaue them of their liues, that made mine vnfortunate, & darkened the beames of that vertue which I possessed from the blood, and famous memory of my Predecessors. For why should men desire to liue, when shame & infamie are the executioners that torment their consciences, and villany is the cause that withholdeth the heart from valiant interprises, and diuerteth the minde from honest desire of glorie and commendatio, which indureth for euer? I know it is foolishly done, to gather fruit before it is ripe, & to seeke to enioy a benefit not knowing whither it belong to vs of right: but I hope to effect it so well, and haue so great confidence in my fortune (that hitherto hath guided the action of my life) that I shall not dye, without reuenging my selfe vpon mine enemie, and that himselfe shall be the instrument of his owne decay, and to execute that which of my selfe I durst not haue enterprised. After this Fengon (as if hee had beene out some long iourney) came to the Court againe, and asked for him that had receiued the charge to play the intillegencer, to entrap Hamlet , in his dissembled wisedome, was abashed to heare neither newes nor tydings of him, and for that cause asked Hamlet what was become of him: naming the man. The Prince that neuer vsed lying, and who in all the answers that euer he made (during his counterfeit madnesse) neuer strayed from the trueth (as a generous minde is a mortal enemie to vntruth) answered and sayd, that the counsellor he sought for, was gone downe through the priuie, where beeing choaked by the filthynesse of the place, the Hogs meeting him had filled their bellyes. How Fengon the third time deuised to send Hamblet to the king of England , with secret Letters to haue him put to death: and how Hamblet when his companions slept, read the Letters, and in stead of them, counterfeited others, willing the king of England to put the two Messengers to death, and to marry his daughter to Hamblet , which was effected, and how Hamblet escaped out of England . A man would haue iudged any thing rather then that Hamblet had committed that murther, neuerthelesse Fengon could not content himselfe, but still his minde gaue him, that the foole would play him some tricke of Liegerdemaine, and willingly would haue killed him, but he feared king Rodericke , his grandfather, and further durst not offend the Queene, mother to the foole, whom she loued  & much cherished: shewing great griefe and heauinesse to see him so transported out of his wits. And in that conceit, seeking to bee rid of him, determined to finde the meanes to doe it by the ayde of a stranger, making the king of England minister of his massacring resolution, choosing rather that his friende should defile his renowne, with so great a wickednesse, then himselfe to fall into perpetuall infamie, by an exployt of so great crueltie, to whom hee purposed to send him, and by letters desire to him to put him to death. Hamblet vnderstanding that he should be sent into England , presently doubted the occasion of his voyage, and for that cause speaking to the Queene, desired her not to make any shew of sorrow or griefe for his departure, but rather counterfeit a gladnesse, as being rid of his presence, who although she loued, yet she dayly greiued to see him in so pittifull estate depriued of all sence and reason: desiring her further, that she should hang the hall with Tapestrie and make it fast with nayles vpon the walles, and keepe the brands for him which he had sharpened at the points, then, when as he said he made arrowes to reuenge the death of his father: lastly, he counselled her, that the yeere after his departure being accomplished, she should celebrate his funerals: assuring her, that at the same instant, she should see him returne with great contentment, and pleasure vnto her for that his voyage. Now to beare him company, were assigned two of Fengons faithfull ministers, bearing Letters ingraued in wood, that contained Hamlets death, in such sort as he had aduertised the King of England . But the subtile Danish prince (beeing at sea) whilest his companions slept, hauing read the letters, and knowne his vncles great treason, with the wicked and villainous mindes of the two courtyers that led him to the slaughter; raced out the letters that concerned his death, and in stead thereof graued others, with Commission to the king of England to hang his two companions,   [  Hamblets craft to saue his life. ] and not content to turne the death they had deuised against him vpon their owne neckes, wrote further, that King Fengon willed him, to giue his daughter to Hamlet in mariage: and so arriuing in England , the Messengers presented themselues to the King, giuing him Fengons Letters, who hauing read the contents, sayd nothing as then, but stayed conuenient time to effect Fengons desire: meane time vsing the Danes familiarly, doing them that honour to sit at his table (for that kings as then were not so curiously nor solemnely serued as in these our dayes, for in these dayes meane kings and lords, of small reuenewe are as difficult and hard to bee seene, as in times past the Monarches of Persia vsed to bee: or as it is reported of the great king of Aethyopia who (wil not permit any man to see his face, which ordinarily hee couereth with a vaile.) And as the Messengers sate at the table with the king, subtile Hamlet was so far from being merry with them, that he would not taste one bit of meate, bread, nor cup of beare whatsoeuer, as then set vpon the table, not without great wondering of the company, abashed to see a yong man and a stranger, not to esteeme of the delicate meates & pleasant drinkes serued at the banquet, reiecting them as things filthy, euill of tast & worse prepared. The king who for that time dissembled what he thought, caused his ghests to be conueyed into their chamber, willing one of his secret seruantes to hide himself therein, & so to certifie him what speeches past among the Danes at their going to bed. Now they were no sooner entred into the chamber, and those that were appointed to attend vpon them gone out, but Hamlets companions asked him, why hee refused to eate and drinke of that which hee found vpon the table, not honouring the banquet of so great a king, that entertained them in friendly sort, with such honour and courtesie as it deserued: saying further, that hee did not well, but dishonoured him that sent him, as if he sent men into England that feared to bee poysoned, by so great a king. The Prince that had done nothing without reason and prudent consideration, answered them and sayd: What think you, that I wil eat bread dipt in humane blood, and defile my throate with the rust of yron, and vse that meat that stinketh and sauoureth of mans flesh, already purified and corrupted, and that senteth like the sauour of a dead carryon long since cast into a valt: and how woulde you haue mee to respect the King, that hath the countenance of a slaue, and the Queene who in stead of great maiestie, hath done three things more like a woman of base parentage,  & fitter for a waiting Gentlewoman then beseeming a Lady of her qualitie and estate: & hauing sayd so, vsed many iniurious & sharpe speeches as well against the king & queen, as others that had assisted at that banquet for the intertainment of the Danish Ambassadors: & therein Hamblet said trueth, as hereafter you shall heare, for that in those dayes, the North parts of the worlde liuing as then vnder Sathans lawes, were full of inchanters, so that there was not any yong gentleman whatsoeuer, that knew not something therein sufficient to serue his turne, if need required: as yet in those dayes in Gothland  & Biarmy , there are many yt knew not what the christian religion permitteth, as by reading the histories of Norway & Gothland you maie easilie perceiue: and so Hamlet , while his father liued had bin instructed in that diuelish art whereby the wicked spirite abuseth man kind, and aduertiseth him (as he can) of things past. It toucheth not the matter herein to discouer the parts of diuination in man, and whether this prince by reason of his ouer great melancholy had receiued those impressions, deuining that, which neuer any but himselfe had before declared, like the Philosophers, who discoursing of diuers deep points of philosophie, attribute the force of those diuinatio to such as are Saturnists by coplection who, oftentimes speake of things which their fury ceasing they then alreadye can hardly vnderstand who are the pronouncers, and for that cause Plato saith, many deuiners, and many poets, after the force and vigour of theire fier beginneth to lessen, do hardly vnderstand what they haue written although intreating of such things, while the spirite of diuination continueth vpon them, they doe in such sort discourse thereof that the authors and inuenters of the arts theselues by the alledged comend their discourses & subtill disputations. Likewise I mean not to relate yt which diuers me beleeue yt a reasonable soul, becometh ye habitation of a meaner sort of diuels, by whom men learn the secrets of things natural & much lesse do I accout of ye supposed gouernors of ye world fained by magitias by whose means they brag to effect meruailous things; It would seeme miraculous yt Hamlet shold diuine in yt sort, which after prooued so true (if as I said before) the diuel had not knowledg of things past, but to grat it he knoweth things I hope you shall neuer finde me in so grose an error, you will compare and make equall deriuation, & coniecture with those that are made by the spirit of God, and pronounced by the holy prophets, that tasted of that maruelous science, to whome onely, was declared the secrets & wondrous workes of the almighty. Yet there are some imposturious companions that impute so much deuinitie to the Diuell the father of lyes yt they attribute vnto him the truth of the knowledge of thinges that shall happen vnto men, alledging the conference of Saul with the witch although one example out of the holy scriptures, specially set downe for the condemnation of wicked man is not of force to giue a sufficient law to all the world, for they themselues confesse, that they can deuine, not according to the vniuersal cause of things, but by signes borrowed from such like causes, which are all waies alike, and by those coniectures, they can giue iudgement of thinges to come, but all this beeing grounded vpon a weake support, (which is a simple coniecture) & hauing so slender a foundation, as some foolish or late experience the fictions being voluntarie, It should be a great folly in a man of good iudgment specially one that imbraceth the preachn of the gospell, & seeketh after no other but the trueth thereof, to repose vpon any of these likelihoods or wrltings full of deceipt. As touching magical operations, I will grant them somewhat therein, finding diuers histories yt write thereof, & that the Bible maketh mention and forbiddeth the vse thereof, yea the lawes of the gentiles and ordinances of Emperors, haue bin made against it, in such sort, that Mahomet the great Hereticke & friend of the Diuell by whose subtiltyes hee abused most part of the East countries hath ordained great punishments, for such as vse and practise those vnlawfull & damnable arts which for this time leauing of, let vs returne to Hamblet , brought vp in these abuses, according the manner of his coutry, whose companions hearing his answere reproached him of folly, saying that hee could by no meanes show a greater point of indiscretion, Then In despising that which is lawfull, and reiecting that which all men receaued, as a necessary thing and that hee had not grossely so forgotte himselfe, as in yt sort to accuse such and so excellent a man as the king of England , and to slander the Queene, being then as famous and wise a princes, as any at that day raigning in the Ilands thereabouts, to cause him to be puntshed, according to his deserts, but he continuing in his dissimulation, mocked him, saying, that hee had not done any thing that was not good & most true: on the otherside the King being aduertised thereof by him that stood to heare the discourse, iudged presently that Hamlet speaking so ambiguously was either a perfect foole, or else one of the wisest princes in his time, answering so sodainly, and so much to the purpose, vpon the demaund by his companions, made touching his behauiour, and the better to finde the trueth caused the babler to be sent for, of whome inquiring in what place the corne grew, whereof he made bread for his table, and whether in that ground there were not some signes or shewes of a battaile fought whereby humaine blood had therein been shed. The babler answered that not far from thence there lay a field ful of dead mens boes: in times past slaine in a battaile, as by the greate heapes of wounded scullea, mighte well appeare and for that the grounds in that parte was become fertiler then other grounds by reason, of the fatte and humours of the dead bodies yt euery yeer the farmers vsed there to haue in ye best wheat they could finde to serue his maiesties house The King perceiuing it to be true, according to the yong princes wordes asked where the hogs had bin fed that were killed to be serued at his table, and answere was made him, that those hogs getting out of the said fielde wherein they were kepte had found the bodie of a thiefe that had beene hanged for his demerits, and had eaten thereof, whereat the King of England beeing abashed, wonld needs know with what water the Beer he vsed to drinke of, had beene brued, which hauing knowne he caused the riuer to bee digged somewhat deeper, and therin found great store of swords & rustie armours: that gaue an ill sauour to the drinke. It were good I should heere dilate somewhat of Merlins prophesies which are said to be spoke of him before he was fuly one yeere old, but if you cosider wel what hath al reddy been spoke it is no hard matter to diuine of things past, although the minister of Sathan therein played his part giuing sodaine and prompt answeres, to this yong prince, for that herein are nothing but natural things, such as were wel known to be true, and therfore not needfull to dreame of thinges to come. This knowne the King greatly moued with a certaine curiositie, to knowe why the Danish prince saide that he had the countenance of a slaue suspecting thereby that he reproached the basenes of his blood and that he wold affirme that neuer any prince had bin his sire, wherin to satisfie himselfe, he went to his mother, and leading her into a secret chamber, which he shut as soone as they were entred desired her of her honour to shewe him of whome he was ingendred in this world. The good Lady wel assured that neuer any man had bin acquainted wt her loue, touching any other man then her husbad, sware that the King her husband onely was the man that had enioyed the pleasures of her body, but the king hir sonne al readie with the truth of the Danish princes answers, threatned his mother to make her tell by force, if otherwise she would not confesse it, who for feare of death acknowledged that she had prostrated her body to a slaue, & made him father to the king of England whereat the king was abashed and wholy ashamed, I giue them leaue to iudge who esteeming themselues honester then theire neighbours, & supposing that there can be nothing amisse in their houses, make more enquirie then is requisite to know yt, which they would rather not haue known, neuerthelesse dissembling what he thought, & biting vpon the bridle, rather then he would depriue himselfe, by publishing the lasciuiousnes of his mother, thought better to leaue a great sin vnpunished, then thereby to make himselfe contemptible to his subiects, who peraduenture would haue reiected him as not desiring to haue a bastard to raigne ouer so great a kingdome. But as he was sorry to hear his mothers confession, on the otherside he tooke great pleasure in the subtilty, and quick spirit of the yong prince, and for that cause wet vnto him to aske him why he had reprooued three things in his Queene conuenient for a slaue, and sauoring more of basenes then of royaltie & far vnfit for the maiesty of a great prince, The king not content to haue receaued a great displeasure by knowing him selfe to be a bastard, & to haue heard wt what iniuries he charged her whom hee loued best in all the world, would not content himself vntill he also vnderstood yt which displeased him, as much as his owne proper disgrace, which was that his Queen was the daughter of a chambermaid, and with all noted certaine foolish countenances, she made, which not onely shewed of what parentage she came, but also yt hir humors sauored of the basenes and low degree of hir parents, whose mother he assured the king was as then yet holden in seruitude. The king admiring the young, prince and behoulding in him some matter of greater respect then in the comon sort of me, gaue him his daughter in marriage, according to the counterfet letters by him deuised, & the next day caused the two seruants of Fengon to be executed, to satisfie as he thought the kings desire, but Hamlet although ye sport plesed him wel, & that the King of England could not haue done him a greater fauor made as though he had been much offended, threatning the king to be reuenged, but the King to appease him gaue him a great sum of gold, which Hamlet caused to be molten, and put it into two staues made hollow for the same purpose, to serue his tourne there with as neede should require, for of all other the kings treasures he took nothing wt him into Denmark but onely those two staues, and as soone as the yeere began to bee at an end hauing somewhat before obtained licence of the King his father in law to depart, went for Denmarke , Then with all the speed hee could to returne againe into England to marry his daughter and so set sayle for Denmarke . How Hamblet hauing escaped out of England , arriued in Denmarke the same day that the Danes were celebrating his funerals, supposing him to be dead in England , and how he reuenged his fathers death vpon his Vncle and the rest of the Courtiers: and what followed. entred into the the pallace of his Uncle the same day that they were celebrating his funeralls and going into the Hall procured no small astonishment and wonder to them all no man thinking other but that hee had beene deade among the which many of them reioyced not a little, for the pleasure which they knew Fengon would coceaue for so pleasant a losse, and some were sadde, as remembring the honourable king Horuendile , whose victories they could by no meanes forget, much lesse deface out of theire memories that which apperteined vnto him, who as the greatly reioyced to see a false report spread of Hamlets death, and that the tyrant had not as yet obtained his will of the heire of Jutie , but rather hoped God would restore him to his sences againe for the good and welfare of that prouince. Their amazement at the last beeing tourned into laughter, all that as then were assistant at the funerall banquet, of him whome they esteemed dead, mocked each at other, for hauing beene so simply deceiued, and wondring at the Prince, that in his so long a voyage he had not recouered any of his sences, asked what was become of them that had borne him company into greate Brittain , to whome he made answere (shewing them the two hollow staues, wherein he had put his molten golde, that the king of England had giuen him to appease his fury, concerning the murther of his two companions,) and said here they are both, Whereat many that already knew his humours, presently coniectured that hee had plaide some tricke of legerdemane, and to deliuer himselfe out of danger, had throwne them into the pitte prepared for him, so that fearing to follow after them and light vpon some euil aduenture they went presently out of the court, and it was well for them that they didde so, considering the Tragedy acted by him the same daie beeing accounted his funerall, but in trueth theire last daies, that as then reioyced for their ouerthrow, for when euery man busied himselfe to make good cheare, and Hamlets ariuall, prouoked them more to drinke and carouse, the prince himselfe at that time played the Butler, and a gentleman attending on the tables, not suffering the pots nor goblets to bee empty whereby hee gaue the noble men such store of liquor, that all of them being ful laden with wine, and, gorged with meate were constrained to lay themselues downe in the same place where they had supt,    [  Drunkenes a vice ouer comon in the North partes of the world. ] so much their sences were dulled, and ouercome with the fire of ouer great drinking, (a vice common and familiar among the Almaines , and other natios, inhabiting the north parts of ye word which when Hamlet perceiuing & finding so good opportunitie, to effect his purpose & bee reuenged of hss enemies & by yt means to abadon the actions gestures, & apparel of a mad man, occasion so fitly finding his turn, & as it were effecting it selfe failed not to take hold therof & seeing those druken bodies, filled with wine, lying like hogs, vpon the groud, some sleeping, others vomiting the ouer great abudace of wine which without measure they had swallowed vp, made the hangings about the hall to fall downe & couer them all ouer, which he nailed to the ground beeing boorded, & at the ends therof he stuck the brands whereof I spake before by him sharpned, which serued for prickes, binding and tying the hangings, in such sort, that what force soeuer they vsed to loose themselues, it was vnpossible to get from vnder them, and presently he set fire in the foure corners of the hal in such sort that all that were as the therin not one escaped away but were forced to purge their sins by fire, & dry vp the great aboundance of liquor by them receiued into their bodies, all of the dying in the vneuitable & mercilesse flames of the whot & burning fire which the prince perceiuing became wise, & knowing yt his vncle before the end of the banquet had withdrawn himselfe into his chamber,   [   A strange reuenge taken by Hamlet .   ] which stood apart from the place where the fire burnt, went thither, & entring into ye chamber, layd had vpo the sword of his fathers murtherer, leauing his own in the place, which while he was at the baket some of the courtiers had nailed fast into the scaberd & going to Fengon said, I wonder disloyal king how thou canst sleep heer at thine ease: & al thy pallace is burnt the fire thereof hauing burnt ye greatest part of thy courtiers & ministers of thy cruelty, detestable tirannies, & which is more I cannot imagin how thou sholdst wel assure thy self, & thy estate, as now to take thy ease, seeing Hamlet so neer thee armed with ye shafts by him prepared long since & at this preset is redy to reuege the traiterous iniury, by thee done to his Lord & Father. Fengon as the knowing ye truth of his nephews subtil practise, & hering him speak wt stayed mind, & which is more, perceiued a sword naked hand, which he already lifted vp to depriue him of his life, leaped quickly out of the bed, taking holde of Hamlets sworde, that was nayled into the scaberd, which as hee sought to pull out, Hamlet gaue him such a blowe vpon the chine of the necke, that hee cut his head cleane from his shoulders, and as he fell to the ground sayd: This iust and violent death is a first reward for such as thou art, now go thy wayes,  & when thou comest in hell, see thou forget not to tell thy brother (who thou trayterously slewest) that it was his sonne that sent thee thither with the message, to the ende that beeing comforted thereby, his soule may rest among the blessed spirits, and quit mee of the obligation that bound me to pursue his vengeance vpon mine owne blood, that seeing it was by thee, that I left the chiefe thing that tyed me to this aliance & consaguinitie. A man (to say the trueth) hardie, couragious, and worthy of eternall comendation, who arming himself with a crafty, dissembling and strange shew of beeing distract out of his wits, vnder that pretence, deceiued the wise, pollitike and craftie: thereby not onely preseruing his life from the treasons & wicked practises of the Tyrant,   [  Commendation of Hamlet for killing the Tyrant. ] but (which is more) by an new & vnexpected kinde of punishment reuenged his fathers death: many yeeres after the act committed: in no such sort that directing his courses with such prudence, & effecting his purposes, with so great boldnes & constancie, he left a iudgement to be decyded among men of wisdom, which was more commendable in him, his constancy or magnanimitie, or his wisdom in ordring his affaires, according to the premeditable determination he had conceaued. If vengeance euer seemed to haue any shew of iustice, it is then,   [  How iust vengeance ought to be considered. ] when pietie and affection constraineth vs to remember our fathers vniustly murdred, as the things wherby we are dispensed withal, & which seeke the means not to leaue treason and murther vnpunished: seeing Dauid a holy & iust king, & of nature simple, courteous and debonaire, yet when he dyed he charged his sonne Salomon (that succeeded him in his throane) not to suffer certaine men that had done him iniurie to escape vnpunished:   [  Dauids intent in commanding Salomon to reuenge him of some of his enemies. ] not that this holy King (as then ready to dye, and to giue account before God of all his actions) was carefull or desirous of reuenge, but to leaue this example vnto vs, that where the Prince or Countrey is interessed, the desire of reuenge can not by any meanes (how small soeuer) beare the title of condemnation, but is rather commendable, and worthy of praise: for otherwise the good kings of Iuda , nor others had not pursued them to death, that had offended their predecessors, if God himselfe had not inspired and ingrauen that desire within their hearts. Hereof the Athenian lawes beare witnesse, whose custome was, to erect Images in remembrance of those men, that reuenging the iniuries of the Common-wealth, boldly massacred tyrants and such as troubled the peace and welfare of the Citizens. Hamblet hauing in this manner reuenged himselfe, durst not presently declare his action to the people, but to the contrary determined to worke by policie, so to giue them intelligence, what he had done, and the reason that drewe him thereunto; so that beeing accompanied with such of his fathers friends, that then were rising, he stayed to see what the people would doe, when they shoulde heare of that sodaine and fearefull action. The next morning the Townes bordering there aboutes, desiring to know from whence the flames of fire proceeded the night before they had seene, came thither, and perceiuing the kings Palace burnt to ashes, & many bodyes (most part consumed) lying among the ruines of the house, all of them were much abashed, nothing being left of the Palace but the foundation: but they were much more amased to beholde the body of the king all bloody, & his head cut off lying hard by him, whereat some began to threaten reuenge, yet not knowing against whom: others beholding so lamentable a spectacle armed themselues, the rest reioycing, yet not daring to make any shewe thereof, some detesting the crueltie, others lamenting the death of their Prince, but the greatest part calling Horuendiles murther to remembrance, acknowledging a iust iudgement from aboue, that had throwne downe the pride of the Tyrant: and in this sort the diuersities of opinions among that multitude of people, being many, yet euery man ignorant what would be the issue of that Tragedie, none stirred from thence, neither yet attempted to moue any tumult, euery man fearing his owne skinne, and distrusting his neighbour, esteeming each other to bee consenting to the massacre. How Hamlet hauing slaine his vncle, and burnt his Palace, made an Oration to the Danes , to shew them what he had done: and how they made him king of Denmarke , and what followed. vsing any words, all searching onely and simply the cause of this ruine and destruction, not minding to loose any time, but ayding himself with the commoditie thereof, entred among the multitude of people, and standing in the middle spake vnto them, as followeth. If there be any among you (good people of Denmark ) that as yet haue fresh within your memories, the wrong done to the valiant king Horuendile , let him not be mooued, nor thinke it strange to behold the confused, hydeous and fearefull spectacle of this present calamitie: if there be any man that affecteth fidelitie, and alloweth of the loue and dutie that man is bound to shewe his parents, and finde it a iust cause to call to remembrance the iniuryes and wrongs that haue been done to our progenitors, let him not bee ashamed beholding this massacre, much lesse offended to see so fearefull a ruine both of men, and of the brauest house in all this countrey: for the hand that hath done this iustice, could not effect it by any other meanes, neither yet was it lawfull for him to doe it otherwise, then by ruinating both sensible and vnsensible things, thereby to preserue the memorie of so iust a vengeance. I see well (my good friends) & am very glad to know so good attention and deuotion in you, that you are sorrie (before your eyes) to see Fengon so murthered, and without a head, which heeretofore you acknowledged for your Commander: but I pray you remember, this body is not the body of a king, but of an execrable tyrant, and a parricide most detestable. Oh Danes , the spectacle was much more hydeous, when Horuendile your king was murthered by his brother. What should I say a brother? nay rather, by the most abhominable executioner that euer beheld the same. It was you that saw Horuendiles members massacred, and that with teares and lamentations accompanied him to the graue: his body disfigured, hurt in a thousand places, & misused in ten times as many fashions; and who doubteth (seeing experience hath taught you) that the Tyrant (in massacring your lawfull king) sought onely to infringe the auncient Liberties of the common people? and it was one hand onely, that murthering Horuendile , cruelly dispoyled him of life, and by the the same meanes vniustly bereaued you of your auncient liberties, & delighted more in oppression then to embrace the plesant coutenance of prosperous libertie, without aduenturing for the same? And what mad man is he, that delighteth more in the tyrrany of Fengon , then in the clemencie and renewed courtesie of Horuendile ? if it bee so, that by clemencie and affabilitie, the hardest and stoutest hearts are molified and made tractable, and that euill and hard vsage causeth subiects to be outragious and vnruly: why behold you not the debonair cariage of the first, to copare it wt the cruelties  & insolencies of the second, in euery respect as cruell & barbarous, as his brother was gentle, meeke and courteous. Remember, O you Danes remember, what loue and amitie Horuendile shewed vnto you, with what equitie and iustice he swayed the great affaires of this kingdome, and with what humanitie and courtisie he defended & cherished you, and then I am assured that the simplest man among you will both remember and acknowledge, that he had a most peaceable, iust & righteous king taken from him, to place in his throane a tyrant and murtherer of his brother: one that hath peruerted all right, abolished the auncient Lawes of our fathers, contaminated the memories of our ancestors, & by his wickednesse polluted the integritie of this kingdome, vpon the necke thereof hauing placed the troublesome yoak of heauie seruitude, abolishing that libertie wherein Horuendile vsed to maintaine you, and suffred you to liue at your ease, and should you now bee sorrie to see the ende of your mischiefes, & that this miserable wretch, pressed downe with the burthen of his offences, at this present payeth the vsury of the parricide committed vpon the body of his brother, & would not himselfe be the reuenger of the outrage done to me, who he sought to depriue of mine inheritance, taking from Denmark a lawfull successor, to plant a wicked stranger, & bring into captiuitie those that my father had infranchised, & deliuered out of misery & bondage? and what man is he that hauing any spacke of wisdom, would esteem a good deed to be an iniury, & account pleasures equal with wrongs & euident outrages? It were then great folly & temerity in Princes & valiant commanders in the wars, to expose theselues to perils & hazards of their liues, for the welfare of the comon people, if yt for a recompence they should reape hatred & indignation of the multitude, to what end should Hother haue punished Balder , if in steed of recompence, the Danes and Swethlanders had banished him to receiue and accept the successors of him that desired nought but his ruine and ouerthrowe? What is hee that hath so small feeling of reason & equitie, that would be grieued to see treason rewarded with the like, and that an euill act is punished with iust demerit, in the partie himselfe that was the occasion: who was euer sorowfull to behold the murtherer of innocents brought to his end: or what man weepeth to see a iust massacre done vpon a Tyrant, vsurper, villaine and bloody personage? I perceiue you are attentiue, & abashed for not knowing the author of your deliuerance, and sorry that you cannot tell to whom you should bee thankefull for such & so great a benefit as the destruction of a tyrant, and the ouerthrow of the place, that was the storehouse of his villanies, and the true receptacle of all the theeues and traytors in this kingdome: but beholde (here in your presence) him that brought so good an enterprise to effect. It is I (my good friends) it is I that confesse I haue taken vengeance, for the violence done vnto my Lord & father, and for the subiection and seruitude that I perceiued in this Countrey, whereof I am the iust and lawfull successor. It is I alone, that haue done this piece of worke, whereunto you ought to haue lent me your handes, and therein haue ayded and assisted me, I haue only accomplished that, which all of you might iustly haue effected, by good reason, with out falling into any point of treason or fellonie: it is true that I hope so much of your good willes, towards the deceased king Horuendile , & that the remembrances of his vertues is yet so fresh within your memories, that if I had required your aide herein, yon would not haue denied it, specially to your naturall Prince. But it liked mee best to doe it my selfe alone, thinking it a good thing to punish the wicked, without hazarding the liues of my friends and loyall subiects, not desiring to burthen other mes shoulders, with this weight, for that I made account to effect it well inough without exposing any man into danger, & by publishing the same should cleane haue ouerthrowne the deuice, which at this present I haue so happily brought to passe. I haue burnt the bodyes of the courtiers to ashes, being companions in the mischiefs and treasons of the tyrant, but I haue left Fengon whole, that you might punish his dead carkasse (seeing that when hee liued you durst not lay hands vpon him) to accomplish the full punishment and vengeance due vnto him, and so satisfie your choller vpon the bones of him, that filled his greedy hands and coffers with your riches, and shed the blood of your brethren and friends. Bee ioyfull then (my good friends) make ready the nose- gay for this vsurping King, burne his abhominable body, boyle his lasciuious members, and cast the ashes of him that hath beene hurtfull to all the world, into the ayre; driue from you the sparkes of pitie, to the end that neither siluer, nor christall cup, nor sacred tombe may be the restfull habitatio of the reliques & bones of so detestable a man: let not one trace of a parricide be seene, nor your countrey defiled with the presence of the least member of this tyrant without pity, that your neighbors may not smell the contagion, nor our land the polluted infection of a body codemned for his wickednes: I haue done my part, to present him to you in this sort, now it belongs to you to make an end of the worke, & put to the last hand of dutie, whereunto your seuerall functions call you, for in this sort you must honor abhominable princes: and such ought to be the funerall of a tyrant, parricide, and vsurper both of the bed & patrimony, that no way belonged vnto him, who hauing bereaued his countrey of liberty, it is fit that the land refuse to giue him a place for the eternal rest of his bones. O my good frieds seeing you know the wrong that hath bin done vnto mee, what my griefs are & in what misery I haue liued since the death of the king, my Lord & father, & seeing that you haue both known and tasted these things then, when as I could not conceiue the outrage that I felt: what neede I recite it vnto you? what benefit would it be to discouer it before them, that knowing it, would burst (as it were with despight) to heare of my hard chance, and curse Fortune for so much imbasing a royall prince, as to depriue him of his maiesty, althogh not any of you durst so much as shew one sight of sorrow or sadnes? You know how my father in law conspired my death, & sought by diuers meanes to take away my life, how I was forsaken of the Q. my mother, mocked of my friends, and dispised of mine own subiects, hetherto I haue liued laden with griefe, and wholy confounded in teares, my life still accompanied with fear and suspition, expecting the houre when the sharp sword would make an ende of my life and miserable anguishes, how many times counterfeiting ye mad man, haue I heard you pitty my distresse, & secretly lament to see me disinherited, and yet no man sought to reuenge the death of my father, nor to punish the treaso of my incestuous vncle, full of murthers & massacres? This charitie ministred comfort, and your affectionate complaints made me euidently see your good wills, that you had in memorie the calamity of your prince, & within your harts ingrauen the desire of vengeace for the death of him that deserued a long life: & what heart can bee so hard & so vntractable, or spirit so seuere, cruel and rigorous, that would not relent at the remembrance of my extremities, and take pitty of an Orphan child, so abandoned of the world? what eyes were so voyd of moysture, but would distill a field of tears, to see a poore Prince assaulted by his owne subiects, betrayed by his mother, pursued by his vncle, & so much oppressed, that his friends durst not shew the effects of their charitie and good affection? O (my good friends) shew pity to him who you haue nourished, and let your harts take some compassion vpon the memory of my misfortunes: I speak to you that are innocent of al treason, & neuer defiled your hands spirits nor desires with the blud of the greate & vertuous king Horuendile . Take pity vpo the queen somtime your soueraign lady, & my right honorable mother, forced by the tyrat and reioyce to see the end & extinguishing of the obiect of her dishonor, which constrained her to be lesse pitiful to her own blood so far as to imbrace the murtherer of her own dear spouse, charging her selfe with a double burthe of infamy & incest, together wt iniuring & disanulling of her house, & the ruine of her race. This hath bin ye occasion yt made me counterfet folly, & couer my intents vnder a vaile of meer madnes, which hath wisdom & pollicy therby to inclose the fruit of this vengeace which yt it hath attained to the ful point of efficacy & perfect accomplishment you your selues shall bee iudges, for touching this & other things concerning my profit, & ye managing of great affairs, I refer my self to your cousels, & therunto am fully determined to yeeld, as being those yt trample vnder your feet the murtherers of my father, & despise the ashes of him that hath polluted and violated the spouse of his brother, by him massacred, yt hath committed felony against his Lord, traiterously assailed the maiesty of his king & odiously thralled his contry vnder seruitude and bondage, & you his loyall subiects from who he bereauing your liberty, feared not to ad incest to parricide, detestable to al the world, to you also it belongeth by dewty & reason comonly to defend & protect Hamlet the minister, and executor of iust vengeace who being iealous of your honour & your reputation, hath hazarded himself, hoping you will serue him for fathers, defeders, & tutors, & regarding him in pity, restore him to his goods, & inheritaces, It is I yt haue take away the infamy of my contry, and extinguished the fire yt imbraced your fortunes, I haue washed the spots, yt defiled the reputation of the queen, ouerthrowing both the tirant & the tirany and beguiling the subtilties of the craftiest deceiuer in the world, and by that meanes brought his wickednes and impostures to an end; I was grieued at the iniurie committed both to my father, & my natiue country, and haue slaine him that vsed more rigorus comandements ouer you, then was either iust or conuenient, to be vsed vnto men, that haue commaunded the valiantest nations in the world. Seeing then he was such a one to you, it is reason, that you acknowledge the benefit & thinke wel of for the good I had done your posterity, & admiring my spirit & wisdome, chuse me your king, if you think me worthy of the place, you see I am the author of your preseruation, heire of my fathers kingdome, not straying in any point fro his vertuous action, no murtherer, violet parricide, nor man yt euer offended any of you but only the vitious, I am lawfull successor in the kingdo, & iust reuenger of a crime aboue al others most grieuous & punishable: it is to me, that you owe the benefit of your liberty receaued, and of the subuersion of that tiranny yt so much afflicted you: yt hath troden vnder feete the yoke of the tirant, and ouerwhelmed his throne, and taken ye scepter out of the hands, of him that abused a holy and iust authoritie, but it is you yt are to recompence those yt haue well deserued, you know what is the reward of so greate desert, & being in your hands to distribute the same, it is of you, that I demand the price of my vertue and the recompence of my victory. This oration of the yong prince so mooued the harts of the Danes , and wan the affections of the nobility, that some wept for pity other for ioy, to see the wisedome and gallant spirit of Hamlet , and hauing made an end of their sorrow, al with one consent proclaimed him king of Jutie and Chersonnese at this present the proper country of Denmarke , and hauing celebrated his coronation,   [   Hamlet king of one part of Denmark.   ] and receiued the homages and fidelities of his subiects, he went into England to fetch his wife, and reioyced with his father in law, touching his good fortune but it wanted little that the king of England had not accomplished that which Fengon with all his subtilties could neuer attaine. How Hamlet after his Coronation went into England , and how the king of England secretly would haue put him to death, and how he slew the King of England : and returned againe into Denmarke with two wiues, and what followed. recouer his kingdom, but when the king of England vnderstood of Fengons death, he was both abashed and confused in his minde, at that instant feeling himselfe assailed with two great passions, for that in times past, he and Fengon hauing bin companions together in armes, had giuen each other their faith  & promises, by oath, that if either of them chanced to bee slaine by any man whatsoeuer, hee that suruiued (taking the quarrel vpon him as his owne) should neuer cease till he were reuenged or at the leaste do his endeauour. This promise incited the barbarous king to massacre Hamlet , but the alliance, presenting it selfe before his eies, and beholding the one deade, although his friend, and the other aliue, and husband to his daughter, made him deface his desire of reuenge. But in the end the conscience of his oath and promise obtained the vpper hand, add secretly made him conclude the death of his sonne in law, which enterprise after that was cause of his own death and ouer runing of the whole coutry of England by the cruelty and despight conceiued by the King of Denmarke . I haue purposely omitted the discourse of that battaile, as not much pertinent to our matter, as also, not to trouble you with too tedious a discourse being content to shew you the end of this wise, & valiant king Hamlet , who reuenging himselfe vpon so many enemies, & discouering all the treasons practised against his life, in the end serued for a sport to fortune, & an example to all great personages, that trust ouermuch to the felicities of this world, yt are of small moment, & lesse cotinuance, The king of England perceiuing that hee could not easilie effect his desire vpon the king his son in lawe, as also not being not willing to break the laws & rights of Hospitality, determined to make a stranger the reuenger of his iniury, & so accomplish his oath made to Fengon without defiling his handes wt the blood of the husbad of his daughter, & polluting his house by the traiterous massacring of his friend. In reading of this history it seemeth Hamlet should resemble an other Hercules , sent into diuers places of the world, by Euristheus (solicited by Iuno ) where he knew any dangerous aduenture, thereby to ouerthrow & destroy him, or else Belleropho set to Ariobatus to put him to death, or (leauing prophane histories,) an other Vrias by King Dauid appointed to bee placed in the fore front of the battaile, and the man that should bee first slain by the Barbarians . For the King of Englands wife being dead not long before, (although he cared not for marrying an other woman) desired his sonne in lawe to make a voyage for him into Scotland , flatttering him in such sort, that he made him beleeue that his singuler wisdome caused him to preferre him to that ambassage, assuring himselfe that it were impossible that Hamlet the subtillest & wisest prince in the worlde should take any thing in the world in hand without effecting the same Now the queen of Scots beeing a maid and of a haughty courage, despised marriage with al me, as not esteeming any worthy to be her companion, in such manner that by reason of this arrogat opinion there neuer came any ma to desire her loue but she caused him to loose his life: but the Danish Kings fortune was so good that Hermetrude (for so was the queens name,) hearing that Hamlet was come thither to intreat at a marriage betweene her and the king of England , forgot all her pride, & dispoiling her selfe of her sterne nature, being as then determined to make him (being the greatest prince as the liuing) her husband, & depriue the English princesse of her spouse whome shee thought fit for no me but herself, & so this Amazon without loue disdaining Cupid , by her free wil submitted her haughtie mind to her concupiscece. The Dane arriuing in her court, desired she to see the old king of Englads letters & mocking at his fond appetites, whose blood as the was half congealed, cast her eies vpon the yong & plesant Adonis of the North, esteeming her selfe happy to haue such a pray fallen into her hands wherof she made her ful accout to haue the possession, & to conclude she yt neuer had been ouercome by the grace, courtesie, valor or riches of anie prince nor Lord whatsoeuer, was as then vanquished wt the onelie report of the subtilties of the Dane who knowing that he was already fianced to the daughter of the king of England , spake vnto him & said, I neuer looked for so great a blisse, neither from the Gods, nor yet from fortune, as to behold in my countries, the most compleate prince in the north, & he that hath made himselfe famous & renowned through all the nations of the world, aswell neighbours as stragers, for the only respect of his vertue wisdom & good fortune, seruing him much in the pursuite & effect of diuers thinges by him vndertake, & thinke my selfe much beholding to the king of England (although his malice seeketh neither my aduancement nor the good of you my Lord) to do me so much honor as to send me so excellent a man to intreate of a marriage (he being olde, & a mortal enemy to me and mine) with mee that am such a one as euery man seeth, is not desirous to couple with a man of so base quality as he, whom you haue said to be ye son of a slaue, but on the otherside I maruel yt the son of Horuendile , and grand-child to king Rotherick he that by his foolish wisedom, & fained madnesse surmounted the forces, & subtilties of Fengon , & obtained the kingdom of his aduersary, should so much imbase himselfe, (hauing otherwise bin very wise and wel aduised, in al his actions) touching his bedfellow, & hee that for his excellency and valor surpasseth humane capacity, should stoope so lowe as to take to wife, her that issuing from a seruile race, hath only the name of a king for her father, for that the basenes of her blood, will alwaies cause her to shewe what are the vertues & noble qualities of hir ancestors: and you my Lord said she, are you so ignorant as not to know that mariage should not bee measured by any foolish opinion, of an outward beautie, but rather by vertues and antiquitie of race, which maketh the wife to be honored for her prudence, and neuer degenerating from the integritie of his ancestors? exterior beawty also is nothing, where perfection of ye mind doth not accomplish, & adorn that which is outwardly seen to be in the bodie, and is lost by an accident, & occurrence of small moment: as also such toyes haue deceiued many men, & drawing the like inticing baits, haue cast the headlog into the gulf of their ruine, dishonor, and vtter ouerthrow, it was I to who this aduatage belonged being a queen, & such a one, as for nobility may compare my selfe with the greatest princes in Europe , being nothing inferiour vnto any of them neither for antiquitie of blood, nobilitie of parents, nor abundace of riches, & am not only a Queene, but such a one, as that receiuing whom I will for my companion in bed, can make him beare the title of a king, & with my body giue him possession of a great kingdome, & goodly prouince, think then my Lord how much I account of your alliace, who being accustomed with the sword to pursue such as durst imbolden theselues to win my loue, it is to you only to whom I make a present both of my kisses, imbracings scepter, & crown: what man is he if he be not made of stone, yt would refuse so pretious a pawn as Hermetrude with ye kingdome of Scotland ? accept sweete king, accepte this Queene, who wt so great loue & amitye, desireth your so great profit, & can giue you more contentment in one day then the princesse of England wold yeeld you pleasure during hir life, & although shee surpasse me in beawty, her bloud beeing base it is fitter for such a king as you are to chuse Hermetrude , lesse beautiful but noble & famous, rather then the English Lady with great beawtie, but issuing fro an vnknown race, without any title of honor: now think if the Dane hearing such forcible resons & vnderstading yt by her which he half doubted as also moued wt choller for the treason of his father in law, yt purposely sent him thether to loose his life, & being welcomed, kist, and playd withal by this queen, yong, & reasonable fair, if he were not easie enough to be conuerted, & like to forget the affection of his first wife, wt this to enioy the realme of Scotland , & so open the waie to become king of all greate Britaine , yt to conclude he marryed her & led her with him to the king of Englands , court which moued the king from that time forward much more to seek the meanes, to bereaue him of his life, & had surely done it, if his daughter, Hamlets other wife, more careful of him yt had reiected her the of her fathers welfare, had not discouered ye enterprse to Hamlet saying, I know wel my Lord, yt the aluremets & perswasions of a bold & altogether shameles woma, being more lasciuious the the chast imbracemtes of a lawful and modest wife, are of more force to intice and charm the sences of yong men: but for my part I cannot take this abuse, for satisfaction to leaue mee in this sorte, without all cause reason or precedent faulte once knowne in mee your loyall spouse, & take more pleasure in the aliace of her who one day will be the cause of your ruine, and ouerthrow, and although a iust cause of iealousye and reasonable motion of anger, dispence with mee at this time, to make no more account of you then you do of me, that am not worthy to be so scornfully reiected, yet matrimoniall charitie shal haue more force & vigour in my hart, then the disdaine which I haue iustly conceiued to see a concubine hold my place & a strange woma before my face inioy the pleasures of my husband. This iniury my Lord although great & offensiue which to reuege diuers Ladies of great renown haue in times past sought & procured the death of their husbands, cannot so much restrain my good wil, but that may not chuse but aduertise you what treason is deuised against you, beseeching you to stad vpon your guard for that my fathers onely seeking is to bereaue you of your life, which if it happen, I shall not long liue after you. Manie reasons induse me to loue and cherish you, and those of great consequence, but specially and aboue all the rest, I am and must bee carefull of you, when I feele your child stirring in my wombe for which respecte, without so much forgetting yourself, you ought to make more account of me then of your concubine: whome I will loue because you loue her, contenting my selfe that your sonne hateth her, in regard of the wrong she doth to his mother: for it is impossible, that any passion or trouble of the mind whatsoeuer, can quench those fierce passions of loue, that made me yours, neither that I shold forget your fauours past, when loyallie you sought the loue of the daughter of the king of England , neither is it in the power of that thiefe that hath stoln your heart, nor my fathers choller, to hinder me, fro seeking to preserue you from the cruelty of your dissembling friend (as heertofore by counterfetting the madman, you preuented the practises, & treasons of your vncle Fengon ) the complot being determined to be executed vpon you & yours, without this aduertisement, the Dane had surely been slain, & the Scots yt came with him, for the King of England inuiting his son in Law to a banquet wt the greatest curtesies yt a friend can vse to him whom he loued as himself, had the means to intrap him, and cause him dance a pittifull galliard, in that sort; to celebrate the marriage betweene him and his new lady. But Hamlet went thither with armor vnder his clothes, & his men in like sort, by which means, he and his escaped with little hurt, and so after that hapned the battaile before spoken of, wherein the king of England losing his life, his countrie was the third time sacked dy the Barbarians of the ilands,  & countrie of Denmark . How Hamblet being in Denmarke , was assailed by Wiglerus his vncle, and after betrayed by his last wife, called Hermetrude , and was slaine: after whose death she marryed his enemie Wiglerus . slaine him, laden with great treasures and accompanied with his two wiues, set forward to saile into Denmarke , but by the way hee had intelligence, that VViglere his vncle, and sonne to Rodericke , hauing taken the royall treasure from his sister Geruth (mother to Hamblet ) had also seazed vpon the kingdom: saying, that neither Horuendile , nor any of his helde it but by permission, and that it was in him (to whom the property belonged) to giue the charge therof to whom he would. But Hamblet not desirous to haue any quarrell with the sonne of him,    [  Hermetrude betrayeth Hamlet her husband. ] from whom his Predecessors had receiued their greatnes and aduancement, gaue such and so rich presents to Wiglere , that he being contented withdrew himselfe out of the countrey & territories of Geruths sonne. But within certaine time after, Wiglere desirous to keepe all the Countrey in subiection: intyced by the conquest of Scanie , and Sialandie , and also that Hermetrude (the wife of Hamlet , whom he loued more then himselfe) had secret intelligence with him and had promised him marriage, so he would take her out of the handes of him that held her, sent to defie Hamlet , and proclaimed open warre against him. Hamlet like a good and wise prince, louing especially the welfare of his subiects, sought by all meanes to auoyde that warre, but againe refusing it, he perceiued a great spot and blemish in his honor, and accepting the same, hee knewe it would bee the ende of his dayes: by the desire of preseruing his life on the one side,  & his honor on the other side pricking him forward; but at the last remembring, that neuer any danger whatsoeuer, had once shaken his vertues and constancy, chose rather the necessitie of his ruine, then to loose the immortall fame that valiant and honourable men obtained in the warres: and there is as much difference betweene a life without honour and an honourable death, as glory & renowne is more excellent then dishonour and euill report. But the thing that spoyled this vertuous Prince, was the ouer great trust & confidence hee had in his wife Hermetrude , and the vehement loue hee bare vnto her, not once repenting the wrong in that case done to his lawfull spouse, and for the which (paraduenture that misfortune had neuer hapned vnto him, and it would neuer haue bin thought, that she whom he loued aboue all things, would haue so villainously betrayed him, hee not once remembring his first wiues speeches, who prophesied vnto him, that the pleasures hee seemed to take in his other wife, would in the end be the cause of his ouerthrowe, as they had rauished him of the best part of his sences, & quenched in him the great prudence that made him admirable in all the countries in the ocean seas, and through all Germany , now the greatest grief, that this king (besotted on his wife) had, was the seperation of her whom he adored, and assuring himselfe of his ouerthrowe, was desirous, either that shee might beare him company at his death, or els to find her a husband that should loue her (he beeing dead) as well as euer hee did: but the disloyall queene, had already prouided her selfe of a marriage, to put her husband out of trouble and care for that: who perceiuing him to be sad for her sake, when shee should haue absented her selfe from him, she to blind him the more, and to incourage him to set forward to his owne destruction, promised to follow him whether soeuer he went, & to take the like fortune that befell to him, were it good or euil, and that so she would giue him cause to know, how much shee surpassed the English woman in her affection towardes him: saying, that woman is accursed that feareth to follow and accompany her husband to the death: so that to heare her speake, men would haue sayd that shee had been the wife of Mithridates , or Zenobia queene of Palmira shee made so greate a show of loue and constancy:   [ Hamlet slaine, ] But by the effect it was after easily perceiued, howe vaine the promise of this vnconstant and wauering Princesse was: and howe vncomparable the life of this Scottish Queene was to the vigor of her chastitie, being a mayd before she was marryed. For that Hamlet had no sooner entred into the field, but she found meanes to see Wiglere , and the battel begun, wherein the miserable Danish Prince was slaine: but Hermetrude presently yeelded her self with all her dead husbands treasons into the hand of the Tyrant: who more then content with that metamorphosis so much desired, gaue order, that presently the marriage (bought with the blood and treasor of the sonne of Horuendile ) should bee celebrated. Thus you see, that there is no promise or determination of a woman, but that a very small discommoditie of Fortune mollifieth and altereth the same, and which time doeth not peruert: so that the misfortunes subiect to a constant man, shake, and ouerthrowe the naturall slipperie loyaltie of the variable steppes of women, wholy without and any faithfull assurance of loue, or true vnfained constancy: for as a woman is ready to promise so is shee heauy and slowe to performe, and effect that which she hath promised, as she that is without end or limit in her desires, flattring her selfe in the diuersitie of her wanton delights, and taking pleasure in diuersitie and change of newe things, which as soone shee doth forget and growe weary off: and to conclude, such shee is in all her actions, she is rash, couetous, and vnthankefull, whatsoeuer good or seruice can bee done vnto her. But nowe I perceiue I erre in my discourse, vomiting such things vnworthy of this sects, but the vices of Hermetrude haue made mee say more then I meant to speake, as also the Authour, from whence I take this Hystorie, hath almost made mee hold his course. I finde so great a sweetnesse and liuelinesse in this kinde of Argument: and the rather because it seemeth so much the truer, considering the miserable successe of poore king Hamlet . Such was the ende of Hamlet , sonne to Horuendile , Prince of Iutie ; to whom if this Fortune had been equall with his inward and naturall giftes, I know not which of the auncient Grecians and Romans had beene able to haue compared with him for vertue and excellencie: but hard fortune following him in all his actions, and yet hee vanquishing the malice of his time, with the vigour of constancy, hath left vs a notable example of haughtie courage, worthy of a great Prince, arming himselfe with hope in things that were wholy without any colour or shewe thereof, and in all his honorable actions made himselfe worthy of perpetuall memorie, if one onely spotte had not blemished and darkened a good part of his prayses. For that the greatest victorie, that a man can obtaine is to make himselfe victorious, and Lord ouer his owne affections, and that restraineth the vnbridled dedesires of his concupiscence: for if a man be neuer so princely, valiant, and wise, if the desires and inticements of his flesh preuaile, and haue the vpper hand, hee will imbase his credite, and gasing after strange beauties become a foole, and (as it were) incensed, dote on the presence of women. This fault was in the great Hercules, Sampson , and the wisest man that euer liued vpon the earth following this traine, therein impaired his wit, and the most noble, wise, valiant and discreet personages of our time, following the same course haue left vs many notable examples of their worthy and notable vertues. But I beseech you that shall reade this Hystorie, not to resemble the Spider, that feedeth of the corruption that shee findeth in the flowers and fruites that are in the Gardens, whereas the Bee gathereth her hony, out of the best and fayrest flower shee can finde: for a man that is well brought vp should reade the liues of whoremongers, drunkards, incestuous, violent and bloody persons, not to follow their steps, and so to defile himselfe with such vncleannesse, but to shunne paliardize, abstain the superfluities and drunkennesse in banquets, and follow the modestie, courtesie, and continencie that recommendeth Hamlet , in this discourse, who while other made good cheare, continued sober, and where all men sought as much as they could, to gather together riches and treasure, hee simply accounting riches nothing comparable to honor, sought to gather a multitude of vertues, that might make him equall to those that by them were esteemed as Gods, hauing not as then receiued the lighte of the Gospell, that men might see among the Barbarians , and them that were farre from the knowledge of one onelye God, that nature was prouoked to follow that which is good and those forward to imbrace vertue for that there was neuer any nation how rude or barbarous soeuer that tooke not some pleasure to do that which seemed good, thereby to win praise, and commendations, which wee haue said to be the reward of vertue, and good life, I delight to speak of these strange histories, and of people that were vnchristned, that the vertue of the rude people maie giue more splendor, to our nation who seeing them so compleat, wise, prudent, and well aduised in their actions, might striue not only to follow (imitation being a small matter) but to surmount them as our religion surpasseth their superstition, and our age more purged subtill, and gallant, then the season wherin they liued and made their vertues knowne.
