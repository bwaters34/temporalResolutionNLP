 Guilt. Your palate it seems is more nice and delicate than the Romanes in Tully's time, who read with pleasure and delight De Fin: L. 1 tabellas Latinas ad verbum de Gr aecis expressas, and he instances in the writings of Ennius, Pacuvius, C aecilius, and others, which were but I ranslations of Euripides, Menander,  1 & Sophocles; nay even in Augustus his time when Learning flourish'd most amongst them, you will find even Virgil himself ever and anon Translating Homer and Theocritus, nay and borrowing Lines out of Ennius and Lucretius too, that writ in his own Language. And if you can like no English Authors but such as write ingenious things of their own, I fear you won't find many to read: for it you observe but our best Poets, ( who don't pretend to Translate, yet) their finest and most delicate Conceptions are none of their own. but meer Translations from the Greeks and Latines, as even themselves Confess in their Prefaces and other Critical Discourses. And you may remember some Eminent Devines in whose writings you have traced Hierocles and others for several Pages together; to say nothing of those of other Professions. And now I wou'd Fain know why it is not as commendable to Translate a whole Author, and own it to be his, as to Steal here and there a Fragment, and make his best Notions pass for ones own. Or, supposing such a dulness and barrenness of Thought and Fancy (as you talk of) has possest the minds of Men of late, why may not one as well bring to light some ingenious Pieces of the Antients, as lie idle, as you do, and write nothing ? and at least not to obstruct Learning, when one knows not how to advance it. For certainly Translations are the greatest obstructions of Learning immaginable: for to what purpose shou'd Men be at the expence of so much time and pains in studying Greek and Latine, when they may read the same Books in their Mother Tongue? now that nothing in the World has a greater tendency to its advancement. Those rich Treasures of Knowledge & Learning among the Ant ents are no longer now lock'd up in unintelligible Words and All Languages are Barbarous that we don't understand, á¼”![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) . 1\.

But Translations has in a great measure remov'd that Curse, and (in a Sense) once more made the whole Earth of ONE Language and of ONE Speech: For now Every Man may hear Plutarch and Tully, Homer and Virgil, Theoritus, Horace and Ovid, and innumerable others, speaking in his own Tongue the wonderful works of God and Nature, the admirable Productions of Wit and Fancy, and what ever else may yield a grateful Satisfaction to noble and ingenious Minds. Nay more than all this, he may bear GOD Himself speaking to him, by his Holy Prophets, by his blessed Apostles, and by his own SON, declaring the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and those important things that concern his Everlasting Peace and Happiness. but only to furnish me with another Argument against your beloved Translations. in whose praises you are so transported. You say Every Man may now read Plutarch and Tully, and the rest in his own Language, and is not this the way to make Learning common, cheap, and contemptible, when every ordinary Mechanick shall be as well acquainted with these Authors as he that has spent 10 or 12 Years in the Universities? The Wise Egyptians took other measures. They regarded their Learning as Sacred, and communicable to none but their Kings & Priests, and therefore wrapt it up in Symbols and Hieroglyphicks to conceal it from the HORAT. Profanum Vulgus. But we have put by the Curtain and exposed all to publick View. Those rich Treasures of Knowledge and Learning are now unlock'd indeed, and scattered abroad among the Rabble; and the mischief on't is, we do but cast Pearls before Swine who will trample them under their Feet, and turn again and rent us: for they have not Capacities to understand 'em so as to value them, but just so much only as to make 'em Conceited and despise all the World as illeterate and ignorant. Animals, not considering that many who understand not Greek and Latine are yet more truly wise than your Learned Criticks and Gramarians. Ceb.

A Man may be learned in the Languages and expert in all the Sciences, & yet be as great a Fool as others. And notwithstanding your charge of Conceitedness upon the Vulgar, it may with more Truth and Reason be retorted upon many Schollars. For as Lib. 1. Ess. 24. MONTAIGNE saies , If you do but observe 'em when they are newly come from the Universities, all that you will find they have got is, that their Latine and Greek has only made 'em greater and more conceited Coxcombs than when they went from home. But you are afraid Knowledge and Learning shou'd grow too Common, whereas I use to think that Bonum qu o communius eo melius; and I always took it for a Blessing promised (not a Curse threatned) That the Earth should be filled with Knowledge, as the Waters cover the Sea: Neither can I apprehend what disadvantage it is to the Sacred Scriptures, that whereas they were once Confin'd to the narrow limits of Judea, they are now dispersed over the Face of the whole Earth. And to think that the Commoness of Learning shou'd render it Contemptible, is very extravagant; fince 'tis the want of it only that makes any despise it. I see no reason therefore to debar the Vulgar of that Knowledge which perhaps they wou'd make better use of than we ourselves. Translation of useful Practical Authors, as of those Learned Pieces, which I'm sure the Vulgar have neither means nor leisure to understand, let their Capacities be what they will; and I believe my Sentiments are not unally'd to yours in this matter. But yet I have one Objection more against Translations in general, which is, That they always come so vastly short of the Original. For to say nothing of the abuse of Translations, when Men pervert and corrupt their Authors, either thro' ignorance or design, to serve an Opinion, or shew their Wit, or the like; but supposing men never so well qualified with Learning and Integrity, yet when they have done what they can, they will pr esent us but with a Shadow and Resemblance of the Original Piece, there will be \---nihil in Imagine vivum, Ovid. nothing of the Life and Spirit of the Author in their Translation: and for ought I know, the Title of Lucian's Ghost might have been as proper and suitable to your Translation, as to those Dialogues of the late Frenchman, which he writ only in Imitation of him; unless you have perform'd it better than any I have yet met with . Phil. You have at length said something to the purpose and [illeg.] this Objection to be unanswerable; for I have not the vanity to think I have equal'd much less excell'd those that have gone before me in attempts of this nature. But yet if I have but given the Sence of the Author, and rend'red it in some measure pleasing and delightful, I hope it may excite in some Persons a desire of understanding him better in his own Language; which was no small part of my design in this Undertaking. Perhaps you may think Translations are more likely to produce other effects, and that Men will less willingly give themselves the trouble of Studying Greek & Latine, when they may read the same Books in English: But I have known Some who wou'd never have taken the pains to read and understand some Greek Authors, if they had not been first charm'd with the Translation, and at the same time entertain'd a Belief that they must needs be much more Agreeable and Taking in the Original. more of that humour. In the mean time I'll take it home (if you please) and peruse it, and see how it looks in English. into your Hands, because I know you are not more Critical in discerning Faults, than able to Correct and amend 'em.
