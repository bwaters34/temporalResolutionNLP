 the conceaued Vtopia of the one, and the reuealed Sapientia Veterum of the other: Whereof the first (vnder a meere Idea of perfect State gouerment) containes an exact discouerie of the vanities and disorders of reall Countries: And the second (out of the foulds of Poeticall fables) laies open those deepe Philosophicall mysteries, which had beene so long lockt vp in the Casket of Antiquity; so that it is hard to iudge to whether of these two worthies, Policy and Morality is more behoulding. I make no question therefore but this obseruation (touching the parallel of their spirits) shal passe so currant to succeeding ages, that it will be said of the as in former times pronounced of Xenophon & Plato, Fuere aequales. And for this Booke that humbly present to your Highnes, which so eminently expresseth its owne perfection, in me it would seeme no lesse a vanity to giue it attributes of glory and praise, then if I should lend Spectacles to Lynx , or an Eye to Argus , knowing it needles to wast guilding on pure Gould, which is euer best valued by its owne true touch  & luster. But to descend to my selfe, that doe now lay before your Princely cesure the Translation of these excellent and iudicious discourses, so barely wrapt vp in my harsh English phrase, that were by the Author so richly attired in a sweet Latine stile: I must therein flie to the Sanctuary of your gracious acceptance. In which hope securing my doubts, doe with all reuerence kisse your Princely hands: Remaining euer readie to approue my selfe Your Highnesse most dutifull and most deuoted Seruant Arthur Gorges. Rich mine of Art: Minnion of Mercury; True Truch-man of the mind of Mystery Inuentions storehouse; Nymph of Helicon: Deepe Moralist of Times tradition: Vnto this Paragon of Brutus race Present thy service, and with cheerefull grace Say (if Pythagoras beleeu'd may bee) The soule of ancient Wisedome liues in thee The Antiquities of the first age (except those we find in sacred Writ) were buried in obliuion and silence: silence was succeeded by Poeticall fables; and Fables againe were followed by the Records we now enjoy. So that the mysteries and secrets of Antiquity were distinguished and separated from the Records and Euidences of succeeding times, by the vaile of fiction which interposed it selfe and came betweene those things which perished, and those which are extant. I suppose some are of opinion, that my purpose is to write toyes and trifles, and to vsurpe the same liberty in applying, that the Poets assumed in faining, which I might doe (I confesse) if I listed, and with more serious contemplations intermixe these things, to delight either my selfe in meditation, or others in reading. Neither am I ignorant how fickle and inconstant a thing fiction is, as being subiect to be drawen and wrested any way, and how great the commoditie of wit and discourse is, that is able to apply things well, yet so as neuer meant by the first Authors. But I remember that this liberty hath beene lately much abused; in that many to purchase the reuerence of Antiquitie to their owne inuentions and fancies, haue for the same intent laboured to wrest many poeticall Fables. Neither hath this old and common vanity bene vsed onely of late or now and then: for euen Crisippus long agoe did (as an Interpreter of dreames) ascribe the opinions of the Stoikes to the ancient Poets; and more sottishly doe the Chymicks appropriate the fancies & delights of Poets in the transformations of bodies, to the experiments of their furnace. All these things (I say) I haue sufficiently considered and weighed, and in them haue seene and noted the generall leuity and indulgence of mens wits about Allegories. And yet for all this I relinquish not my opinion. For first it may not be, that the folly and loosenesse of a few should altogither detract from the respect due to the Parables: for that were a conceit which might sauour of prophanenesse and presumption: for Religion it selfe doth somtimes delight in such vailes and shadowes: so that who so exempts them, seemes in a manner to interdict all commerce betweene things diuine and humane. But concerning humane wisedome, I doe indeed ingenuously and freely confesse, that I am enclined to imagine, that vnder some of the ancient fictions lay couched certaine mysteries and Allegories, euen from their first inuention. And I am perswaded (whether rauished with the reuerence of Antiquity, or because in some Fables I finde such singular proportion betweene the similitude and the thing signified; and such apt and cleare coherence in the very structure of them, and propriety of names wherewith the persons or actors in them are inscribed and intitled) that no man can constantly deny, but this sense was in the Authours intent and meaning when they first inuented them, and that they purposely shadowed it in this sort: For who can be so stupid & blind in the open light, as (when he heares how Fame, after the Gyants were destroyed, sprang vp as their yongest Sister) not to refer it to the murmers and seditious reports of both sides, which are wont to fly abroad for atime after the suppressing of insurrections? Or when he heares how the Gyant Typhon hauing cut out and brought away Iupiters nerues, which Mercurie stole from him, and restored againe to Iupiter; doth not presently perceiue how fitly it may be applyed to powerfull rebellions, which take from Princes their sinewes of money and authority, but so, that by affability of speech, and wise edicts (the minds of their subiects being in time priuily, and as it were by stealth reconciled) they recouer their strength againe? Or when he heares how (in that memorable expedition of the Gods against the Gyants) the braying of Silenus his Asse, conduced much to the profligation of the Gyants; doth not confidently imagine, that it was inuented to shew, how the greatest enterprises of Rebels are often-times dispersed with vainerumors and feares? Moreouer, to what iudgement can the conformitie and signification of Names seeme obscure? Seeing Metis the wife of Iupiter doth plainely signifie councell: Typhon, insurrection; Pan, vniuersality; Nemesis, reuenge, and the like. Neither let it trouble any man, if sometimes hee meete with Historicall narrations, or additions for ornaments sake, or confusion of times, or something transfered from one fable to another, to bring in a new Allegory: for it could be no otherwise, seeing they were the inuentions of men, which liued in diuers ages, and had also diuers ends: some being auncient, others neotericall: some hauing an eye to things naturall, others to morall. There is another Argument (and that no small one neither) to prooue that these Fables containe certaine hidden and inuolued meanings, seeing some of them are obserued to be so absurd and foolish in the very relation, that they shew, and as it were proclaime a parable afar off: for such tales as are probable, they may seeme to be inuented for delight, and in imitation of History. And as for such as no man would so much as imagin or relate, they seem to be sought out for other ends: For what kinde of fiction is that, wherein Iupiter is said to haue taken Metis to wife, and, perceiuing that she was with child, to haue deuoured her, whence himselfe conceiuing, brought forth Pallas armed out of his head? Truly I thinke there was neuer dreame (so different to the course of cogitation, and so full of monstrosity) euer hatcht in the braine of man. Aboue all things this preuailes most with me, and is of singular moment, that many of these Fables seeme not to be inuented of those by whom they are related and celebrated, as by Homer, Hesiod, and others: for if it were so, that they tooke beginning in that age, and from those Authours by whom they are deliuered and brought to our hands; My mind giues me there could be no great or high matter expected, or supposed to proceed from them in respect of these originals. But if with attention we consider the matter, it will appeare that they were deliuered and related as things formerly beleeued and receiued, and not as newly inuented and offered vnto vs. Besides, seeing they are diuersly related by Writers that liued neere about one and the selfe same time, we may easily perceiue that they were common things, deriued from precedent memorials: and that they became various by reason of the diuers ornaments bestowed on them by particular relations. And the consideration of this must needs encrease in vs a great opinion of them, as not to be accounted either the effects of the times or inuentions of the Poets, but as sacred reliques or abstracted ayres of better times, which by tradition from more ancient Nations fell into the Trumpets and Flutes of the Gr aecians. But if any doe obstinately contend, that Allegories are alwaies aduentitially, & as it were by constraint, neuer naturally and properly included in Fables, we will not be much troublesome, but suffer them to enioy that grauity of iudgment which I am sure they affect, although indeed it be but lumpish and almost leaden. And (if they be worthy to be taken notice of) we will begin afresh with them in some other fashion. There is found among men (and it goes for currant) a two-fold vse of Parables, and those (which is more to be admired) referred to contrary ends; conducing as well to the foulding vp and keeping of things vnder a vaile, as to the inlightning and laying open of obscurities. But omitting the former (rather then to vndergoe wrangling, and assuming ancient Fables as things vagrant and composed onely for delight) the latter must questionlesse still remaine, as not to be wrested fro vs by any violence of wit, neither can any (that is but meanely learned) hinder, but it must absolutely be receiued, as a thing graue and sober, free from all vanitie, and exceeding profitable and necessary to all sciences. This is it (I say) that leads the vnderstanding of man by an easie and gentle passage through all nouell and abstruse inuentions, which any way differ from common receiued opinions. Therefore in the first ages (when many humane inuentions and conclusions, which are now common and vulgar, were new and not generally knowen) all things were full of Fables, aenigmaes parables, and similies of all sortes: by which they sought to teach and lay open, not to hide and conceale knowledge, especially, seeing the vnder standings of men were in those times rude and impatient, and almost incapable of any subtilties, such things onely excepted, as were the obiects of sense: for as Hieroglyphicks preceded letters, soparables were more ancient then Arguments. And in these daies also, he that would illuminate mens minds anew in any old matter, and that not with disprofit and harshnesse, must absolutely take the same course, and vse the help of similies. Wherefore all that hath beene said, wee will thus conclude: The Wisedome of the Ancients, it was either much or happy; Much if these figures and tropes were inuented by studie and premeditation. Happy if they (intending nothing lesse) gaue matter and occasion to so many worthy Meditations. As concerning my labours (if there bee any thing in them which may do good) I will on neither part count them ill bestowed, my purpose being to illustrate either Antiquity, or things themselues. Neither am I ignorant that this very subiect hath beene attempted by others: But to speake as I thinke, and that freely without ostentation, the dignitie and efficacy of the thing is almost lost by these mens writings, though voluminous and full of paines, whilst not diuing into the depth of matters, but skilfull onely in certaine common places, haue applyed the sense of these Parables to certaine vulgar and generall things, not so much as glancing at their true vertue, genuine proprietie, and full depth. I (if I be not deceiued) shall be new in common things. Wherefore leauing such as are plaine and open, I will ayme at further and richer matters. I CASSANDRA, or Diuination. The Poets fable that Apollo being enamored of Cassandra , was by her many shifts  & cunning sleights still deluded in his desire; but yet fed on with hope vntill such time as shee had drawen from him the gift of prophesying; and hauing by such her dissimulation in the end, atteined to that which from the beginning shee sought after, at last flatly reiected his suite. Who finding himselfe so farre engaged in his promise, as that hee could not by any meanes reuoke againe his rash gift, and yet enflamed with an earnest desire of reuenge, highly disdayning to bee made the scorne of a craftie wench, annexed a penaltie to his promise, to wit, that shee should euer foretell the trueth, but neuer be beleeued: So were her diuinations alwayes faithfull, but at no time regarded, whereof shee still found the experience, yea euen in the ruine of her owne countrey, which shee had often forewarned them of, but they neither gaue credite nor eare to her words. This Fable seemes to intimate the vnprofitable liberty of vntimely admonitions and counselles. For they that are so ouerweened with the sharpnesse and dexteritie of their owne wit and capacitie, as that they disdaine to submit themselues to the documents of Apollo , the God of Harmonie, whereby to learne and obserue the method and measure of affaires, the grace and grauitie of discourse the differences between the more iudicious and more vulgar eares, and the due times when to speake and when to be silent; Bee they neuer so sensible and pregnant, and their iudgements neuer so profound and profitable, yet in all their endeuours either of perswasion or perforce, they auaile nothing, neither are they of any moment to aduantage or mannage matters, but do rather haste on the ruine of all those that they adhere or deuote themselues vnto. And then at last when calamitie hath made men feele the euent of neglect, then shall they too late be reuerenced as deep foreseing and faithfull prophets. Whereof a notable instance is eminently fet forth in Marcus Cato Vticesis , who as from a watchtower discouered afar of, and as an Oracle long foretold, the approching ruine of his Countrey, and the plotted tyrannie houering ouer the State, both in the first conspiracie, and as it was prosecuted in the ciuill contention between Cesar and Pompey , and did no good the while, but rather harmed the commonwealth, and hastned on his countreys bane, which M. Cicero wisely obserued, and writing to a familiar fried doth in these termes excellently describe, Cato optim e sentit, sed nocet interdum Reipublicae: loquitur enim tanquam in Republica Platonis, non tanquam in faece Romuli. Cato (saith he) iudgeth profoundly, but in the meane time damnifies the State, for he speakes as in the commonwealth of Plato , and not as in the dregs of Romulus. 2 Typhon , or a Rebell. Ivno being vexed (say the Poets) that Iupiter had begotten Pallas by himselfe without her, earnestly pressed all the other Gods and Goddesses that shee might also bring forth of herselfe alone without him; and hauing by violence and importunitie obteyned a graunt thereof, shee smote the earth, and forthwith sprang vp Typhon a huge and horrid monster: This strange birth shee committes to a Serpent (as a Foster father) to nourish it, who no sooner came to ripenes of yeeres, but hee prouokes Iupiter to battell. In the conflict the Gyant getting the vpper hand, takes Iupiter vppon his shoulders, caries him into a remote and obscure countrey, and (cutting out the sinewes of his hands and feet) brought them away, and so left him miserably mangled and maymed. But Mercury recouering these nerues from Typhon by stealth, restored them againe to Iupiter. Iupiter being againe by this meanes corroborated, assaultes the Monster afresh, and at the first strikes him with a thunderboult, from whose bloud serpents were ingendred. This Monster at length fainting and flying, Iupiter casts on him the mount Æ tna , and with the weight thereof crusht him. This Fable seemes to point at the variable fortune of Princes, and the rebellious insurrection of Traytors in a State. For Princes may well be said to be maried to their dominions, as Iupiter was to Iuno : but it happees now  & then, that being deboshed by the long custome of empyring & bending towards tyrany, they endeuour to draw all to themselues, and (contemning the counsell of their Nobles and Senatours hatch lawes in their owne braine, that is, dispose of things by their owne fancie and absolute power. The people (repyning at this) study how to create and set vp a cheese of their owne choise. This proiect by the secret instigation of the Peeres and Nobles, doth for the most part take his beginning; by whose conniuence the Commons being set on edge, there followes a kind of murmuring or discontent in the State, shadowed by the infancie of Typhon , which being nurst by the naturall prauitie and clownish malignity of the vulgar sort (vnto Princes as infestious as Serpents) is againe repaired by renewed strength, and at last breakes out into open Rebellion, which (because it brings infinite mischiefs vpon Prince and people) is represented by the monstrous deformity of Typhon : his hundred heads signifie their deuided powers; his fiery mouthes their inflamed intents; his serpentine circles their pestilent malice in besieging; his yron hands, their merciles slaughters; his Eagles tallents, their greedy rapynes; his plumed body, their continuall rumors, and scouts,  & feares and such like. And sometimes these rebellions grow so potent that Princes are inforc't (trasported as it were by the Rebels, and forsaking the chiefe Seates and Cities of the Kingdome) to contract their power, and (being depriued of the Sinewes of money & maiestie) betake theselues to some remote & obscure corner within their dominions: but in processe of time (if they beare their misfortunes with moderation) they may recouer their strength by the vertue and industry of Mercury , that is, they may (by becomming affable  & by reconcyling the minds and willes of their Subiects with graue edicts & gratious speech) excite an alacritie to graunt ayds and subsidies whereby to strengthen their authority anew. Neuertheles hauing learned to be wise and warie, they will refraine to try the chaunce of Fortune by warre and yet studdy how to suppresse the reputation of the Rebels by some famous action, which if it fall out answerable to their expectation, the Rebels finding themselues weakned, and fearing the successe of their broken proiects; betake themselues to some sleight and vaine brauadoes, like the hissing offerpents, and at length in despaire betake themselues to flight, and then when they beginne to breake, it is safe and timely for kings to pursue and oppresse them with the forces and weight of the kingdome, as it were with the mountaine Ætna. 3 The Cyclopes, or the Ministers of Terror. They say that the Cyclopes (for their fiercenes  & crueltie) were by Iupiter cast into hell, and there doomed to perpetuall imprisonment: but Tellus perswaded Iupiter that it would doe well, if being set at liberty, they were put to forge thunderboults, which being done accordingly, they became so painefull and industrious, as that day and night they continued hammering out in laborious diligence thunderboults and other instruments of terrour. In processe of time Iupiter hauing conceiued a displeasure against Æ sculapius the sonne of Apollo for restoring a dead man to life by physicke; and concealing his dislike (because there was no iust cause of anger, the deed being pious and famous) secretly incens't the Cyclopes against him, who without delay slew him with a thunderboult: In reuenge of which act; Apollo ( Iupiter not prohibiting it) shotte them to death with his arrowes. This Fable may be applyed to the proiects of Kings, who hauing cruell, bloudy, & exacting Officers, do first punish and displace them, afterwards by the counsell of Tellus , that is of some base and ignoble person, and by the preuayling respect of profitethey admit them into their places againe, that they may haue instruments in a readynes, if at any time there should need either seuerity of execution, or a cerbity of exaction. These seruile creatures being by nature cruell, and by their former fortune exasperated, and perceiuing well what is expected at their hands, doe shew themselues wonderfull officious in such kinde of imployments but being too rash and precipitate in seeking countenance and creeping into fauour, doe somtimes take occasion from the secret becknings and ambiguous commandes of their Prince to performe some hatefull execution. But Princes (abhorring the fact, and knowing well that they shall neuer want such kind of instruments) doe vtterly forsake them, turning them ouer to the friends  & allyes of the wronged to their accusations and reuenge, and to the generall hatred of the people, so that with great applause and prosperous wishes and exclamations towards the Prince, they are brought, rather too late then vndeseruedly, to a miserable end. 4 Narcissvs , or Selfe-Loue. They say that Narcissus was exceeding faire and beautifull but wonderfull proud and disdainfull; wherefore dispising all others in respect of himselfe, hee leades a solitary life in the woods and chases with a few followers, to whom hee alone was all in all, among the rest there followes him the Nymph Echo . During his course of life it fatally so chaunc't that hee came to a cleere fountaine, vpon the bancke whereof hee lay downe to repose himselfe in the heate of the day. And hauing espyed the shadowe of his owne face in the water, was so besotted and rauished with the contemplation and admiration thereof, that by no meanes possible he could bee drawen from beholding his image in this Glasse; insomuch that, by continuall gazing there-upon, hee pynde away to nothing, and was at last turned into a flower of his owne name, which appeares in the beginning of the Spring, and is sacred to the infernall powers, Pluto, Proserpina , and the Furies. This Fable seemes to shewe the dispositions and fortunes of those, who in respect either of their beautie or other gifts wherewith they are adorned and graced by nature without the helpe of industrie, are so farre besotted in themselues, as that they prooue the cause of their owne destruction. For it is the propertie of men infected with this humour not to come much abroad, or to be conuersantin ciuill affaires, especially seeing those that are in publike place must of necessitie encounter with many contempts and scornes, which may much deiect and trouble their minds, and therefore they leade for the most parte a solitarie, priuate and obscure life, attended on with a fewe followers, and those such as will adore and admire them, and like an Eccho flatter them in all their sayings, and applaude them in all their words. So that being by this custome seduced and pust vp, and as it were stupefied with the admiration of themselues, they are possessed with so strange a sloth  & idlenes, that they growe in a manner benumd & defectiue of all vigor & alacrity. Elegantly doth this flower appearing in the beginning of the spring, represent the likenes of these mens dispositions, who in their youth doe flourish and waxe famous, but being come to ripenes of yeeres they deceiue and frustrate the good hope that is conceiued of them. Neither is it impertinent that this flower is said to be consecrated to the infernall deities, because men of this disposition become vnprofitable to all humane things. For whatsoeuer produceth no fruit of it selfe, but passeth and vanisheth as if it neuer had bene (like the way of a ship in the sea) that the Auncients were wont to dedicate to the ghosts and powers belowe. 5 Styx , or Leagues. The Oath by which the Gods were wont to oblige themselues (when they meant to ratifie any thing so firmely as neuer to reuokeit) is a thing well knowne to the vulgar, as being mentioned almost in euery Fable, which was when they did not inuoke or call to witnes any celestiall maiestie or diuine power, but onely the Riuer Styx that with crooked and Meandry turnings incircleth the Palace of the infernall Dis . This was held as the onely solemne manner of their Sacrament, and besides it, not any other vowe to bee accounted firme  & inuiolable, and therefore the punishment to bee inflicted (if any did periure themselus) was that for certaine yeeres they should be put out of commons, and not to be admitted to the table of the Gods. This Fable seemes to point at the Leagues and Pacts of Princes, of which more truely the opportunely may be said, that bee they neuer so strongly confirmed with the solemnity and religion of an oath, yet are for the most part of no validitie: insomuch that they are made rather with an eye to reputation, and report and ceremonie; then to faith, security and effect. Moreouer adde to these the bonds of affinitie as the Sacraments of nature, and the mutuall deserts of each parte, and you shall obserue that with a great many all these things are plac't a degree vnder ambition and profite, and the licentious desire of domination: And so much the rather because it is an easie thing for Princes to defende and couer their vnlawfull desires and vnfaithfull vowes, with many outwardly seeming faire pretexts, especially seeing there is no vmper or moderator of matters concluded vpon, to whom a reason should bee tendered. Therefore there is one true and proper thing made choice of, for the confirmation of faith, and that no celestiall power neither, but is indeep Necessity (a great God to great Potentates) the perill also of State, and the Communication of profite. As for Necessitie it is elegantly represented by Styx that fatall and irremeable riuer, and this Godhead did Iphicrates the Athenean call to the confirmation of a League, who because hee alone is founde to speake plainely that which many hide couertly in their breasts, it would not bee amisse to relate his words. Hee obseruing howe the Lacedemonians had thought vpon and propounded diuers cautions, sanctions, confirmations, and bonds pertaining to Leagues, interposed thus; Vnum Lacedemony, nobis vobiscum vinculum, & securitatis ratio esse possit, si plane demonstretis, vos ea nobis concessisse, & inter manus posuisse, vt vobis facultas laedendi nos si maxime velletis minime suppetere possit. There is one thing (o Lacedemonians) that would lincke vs vnto you in the bond of amitie, and bee the occasion of peace and security, which is if you would plainely demonstrate, that you haue yeelded vp and put into our hands such things, as that, would you hurt vs neuer so faine, you should yet be disfurnished of meaes to doe it. If therefore the power of hurting bee taken away, or if by breach of league there followe the danger of the ruine or diminution of the State or tribute; then indeed the leagues may seeme to be ratified and established, and as it were confirmed by the Sacrament of the Stygian lake; seeing that it includes the feare of prohibition, and suspension from the table of the Gods, vnder which name the lawes and prerogatiues, the plentie and felicitie of a kingdome were signified by the Ancients. 6 Pan , or Nature. The Ancients haue exquisitely described Nature vnder the person of Pan , whose originall they leaue doubtfull, for some say that he was the sonne of Mercury : others attribute vnto him a farre different beginning, affirming him to be the common ofspring of Penelopes sutors, vpon a suspition, that euery one of them had to doe with her, which latter relation doubtlesse gaue occasion to some after wryters to intitle this ancient fable with the name of Penelope , a thing very frequent amongst them, when they apply old fictions to yong persons and names, and that many tymes absurdly and indiscreetly: as may be seene heere; for Pan being one of the ancient Gods was long before the tyme of Vlisses and Penelope . Besydes (for her matronall chastity) shee was held venerable by Antiquity. Neither may wee pretermit the third conceipt of his birth: for some say that hee was the sonne of Iupiter & Hybris , which signifies contumely or disdeine. But howsoeuer begotte, the Parc ae (they say) were his sisters. He is purtrayed by the Ancients in this guyse: on his head a paire of hornes that reach to heauen, his body rough and hairy, his beard long and shaggy, his shape biformed, aboue like a man, below like a beast, his feet like Goates hoofes, bearing these ensignes of his iurisdiction; to wit, in his left hand a Pipe of seauen reeds, and in his right a sheephooke, or a staffe crooked at the vpper end, and his mantle made of a Leopards skinne. His dignities and offices were these: hee was the God of Hunters, of Shepheards, and of all rurall inhabitants: cheefe president also of hils and mountaines, & next to Mercury the Embassadour of the Gods. Moreouer hee was accounted the leader and comaunder of the Nymphes , which were alwaies wont to dance the rounds and friske about him, hee was acosted by the Satyres and the olde Sileni . Hee had power also to strike men with terrors, and those especially vaine  & superstitious, which are tearmed Panicque feares. His acts were not many, for ought that can bee found in records, the cheefest was that hee challenged Cupid at wrestling, in which conflict hee had the foile. The tale goes too that hee caught the Giant Typhon in a net, and held him fast. Moreouer when Ceres (grumling and chasing that Proserpina was rauished) had hid her selfe away, and that all the Gods tooke pains (by dispersing themselues into euery corner) to find her out, it was onely his good hap (as hee was hunting) to light on her, and acquaint the rest where she was. He presumed also to put it to the tryall who was the better Musitian hee or Apollo , and by the iudgment of Midas was indeed preferred: But the wise iudge had a paire of Asses eares priuily chopt to his Nodle for his sentence. Of his louetrickes, there is nothing reported, or at l east not much, a thing to be wondred at, especially being among a troope of Gods so profusly amorous. This onely is said of him, that hee loued the Nymph Eccho (whom he tooke to wyfe) and one pretty wench more called Syrinx , towards whom Cupid (in an angry and reuengefull humor because so audaciously hee had challenged him at wrestling) inflamed his desire. Moreouer hee had no issue (which is a maruell also, seeing the Gods, especially those of the Malekind were very generatiue) onely hee was the reputed father of a litle Girle called Iambe , that with many prety tales was wont to make strangers merry: but some thinke hee did indeed beget her by his wife Iambe . This (if any bee) is a noble tale, as being laid out, and bigg bellied with the secrets and mysteries of nature. Pan (as his name imports) represents and lays open the All of things or Nature. Concerning his originall there are two onely opinions that goe for currant: for either hee came of Mercury that is, the word of God which the holy Scriptures without all controuersie affirme,  & such of the Philosophers as had any smacke of diuinity assented vnto: or els from the confused seedes of things. For they that would haue one simple beginning referre it vnto God: or if a materiate beginning, they would haue it various in power. So that wee may end the controuersie with this distribution that the world tooke beginning either from Mercury , or from the seeds of all things. Namque canebat vti magnum per inane coacta Semina, terrarumque, anim aeque, marisque fuissent, Et liquidi simul ignis: & his exordia primis Omnia, & ipse tener mundi concreuerit Orbis. For rich-vaind Orpheus sweetly did rehearse How that the seeds of fire, ayre, water, earth, Were all pact in the vast void vniuerse: And how from these as firstlings all had birth, And how the bodie of this Orbicque frame From tender infancy so bigg became. But as touching the third conceipt of Pans originall, it seemes that the Grecians (either by intercourse with the Egyptians or one way or other) had heard something of the Hebrew mysteries: for it points to the state of the world not considered in immediate creation, but after the fall of Adam , exposed and made subiect to death and corruption: for in that state it was (and remains to this day) the of spring of God and Sinne. And therefore all these three narrations, concerning the manner of Pans birth, may seeme to bee true, if it bee rightly distinguished betweene things and times. For this Pan or nature (which wee suspect, contemplate, and reuerence more then is fit) tooke beginning from the word of God by the meanes of confused matter, and the entrance of preuarication and corruption. The Destinies may well be thought the Sisters of Pan or Nature , because the beginnings, and continuances, and corruptions, and depressions, and dissolutions, and eminences, and labours, and felicities of things, and all the chances which can happen vnto any thing are linckt with the chaines of causes naturall. Hornes are attributed vnto him, because Hornes are broad at the roote and sharpe at the ends, the nature of all things being like a Pyramis sharpe at the Toppe. For indiuiduall or singular things being infinite are first collected into Species , which are many also; then from Species into generals , and from generals (by ascending) are contracted into things or notions more generall, so that at length Nature may seeme to be contracted into a vnity. Neither is it to be wondred at, that Pan toucheth heauen with his hornes, seeing the height of nature or vniuersall Ideas doe in some sort, pertaine to things diuine, and there is a ready and shorte passage from Metaphysicke to natur all Theologie. The body of Nature is elegantly and with deepe iudgement depainted hairy, representing the beames or operations of creatures: for beames are as it were the haires and bristles of Nature , and euery creature is either more or lesse beamie, which is most apparent in the facultie of seeing, and no lesse in euery vertue and operation that effectuals vpon a distant obiect: for whatsoeuer workes vp any thing afarre off; that may rightly bee saide to darte forth rayes or beames. Moreouer Pans beard is said to bee exceeding long, because the beames or influences of celestiall bodies doe operate and pierce farthest of all, and the Sunne when (his higher halfe is shadowed with a cloud) his beames breake out in the lower, and lookes as if he were bearded. Nature is also excellently set forth with a biformed body, with respect to the differences betweene superiour and inferiour creatures. For the one part by reason of their pulchritude,  & equabilitie of motio, & constancy, & dominion ouer the earth & earthly things, is worthily set out by the shape of man: and the other part in respect of their perturbations and vnconstant motions (and therefore needing to be moderated by the celestiall) may be well fitted with the figure of a brute beast. This description of his body perteines also to the participation of Species , for no naturall beeing seemes to be simple, but as it were participating and compounded of two. As for example; man hath somthing of a beast: a beast something of a plant: a plant something of a inanimate bodie, so that all naturall things are in very deed biformed, that is to say compounded of a Superiour, and inferiour Species. It is a wittie Allegorie that same of the feet of a Goate, by reason of the vpward tending motion of terrestriall bodies towards the ayer and heauen: For the Goate is a clyming creature, that loues to bee hanging about the rockes and sleep mountaines; And this is done also in a wonderfull manner, euen by those things which are destinated to this inferiour globe, as may manifestly appeare in cloudes and Meteors. The two Ensignes which Pan beares in his hands do point, the one at Harmony, the other at Empiry: for the Pipe consisting of seauen reedes doth euidently demonstrate the concent and harmony and discordant concord of all inferior creatures, which is caused by the motion of the seuen Planets: And that of the Shep-hooke may be excellently applied to the order of nature, which is partly right partly crooked: This staffe therefore or rodde is especially crooked in the vpper end, because all the workes of diuine prouidence in the world are done in a far fetcht and circular manner, so that one thing may seeme to be effected, and yet indeed a cleane cotrary brought to passe, as the selling of Ioseph into Egypt , and the like. Besides in all wise humane gouerment, they that sit at the helme doe more happily bring their purposes about, and insinuate more easily into the minds of the people, by pretexts and oblique courses, then by direct methods; so that all Scepters and Mases of authority ought in very deed to be crooked in the vpper end. Pans cloake or mantle is ingeniously fained to be the skin of a Leopard, because it is full of spottes: so the heauens are spotted with stars, the sea with rockes and Islands, the land with flowers, and euery particular creature also is for the most part garnished with diuers colours about the superficies, which is as it were a mantle vnto it. The office of Pan can bee by nothing so liuely conceaued and exprest, as by fayning him to bee the God of hunters, for euery naturall action, and so by consequence, motion and progression, is nothing els but a hunting. Arts and Sciences haue their workes, and humane counsels their ends which they earnestly hunt after. All naturall things haue either their food as a prey, or their pleasure as a recreation which they seeke for, and that in most expert and sagacious manner. Torua Le aena Lupum sequitur, Lupus ille Capellam: Florentem Cythisum sequitur lasciua Capella. The hungry Lionesse (with sharp desire) Pursues the Wolfe, the Wolfe the wanton Goate: The Goate againe doth greedily aspire To haue the trifol iuyce passe downe her throate. Pan is also saide to bee the God of the countrey Clownes, because men of this condition lead liues more agreeable vnto nature, then those that liue in the Cities and Courts of Princes, where nature by too much arte is corrupted: So as the saying of the Poet (though in the sense of loue) might be here verified: Pars minima est ipsa puella sui. The maid so trickt her selfe with arte, That of her selfe shee is least parte. Hee was held to be Lord President of the mountaines, because in high mountaines and hilles, Nature layes herselfe most open, and men most apt to viewe and contemplation. Whereas Pan is said to bee (next vnto Mercury ) the messenger of the Gods, there is in that a diuine Mystery coteined, for next to the word of God the image of the world proclaimes the power and wisedome diuine, as sings the sacred Poet. Psal. 19.1. C aeli enarrant gloriam Dei, atque opera manuum eius indicat firmamentum. The heauens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth the workes of his hands. The Nymphes , that is, the soules of liuing things take great delight in Pan : For these soules are the delights or minions of Nature , and the direction or conduct of these Nymphes is with great reason attributed vnto Pan , because the soules of all things liuing doe follow their naturall dispositions as their guides, and with infinite varietie euery one of them after his own fashion doth leape and friske and dance with incessant motion about her. The Satyres and Sileni also, to wit, youth and old age are some of Pans followers: for of all naturall things there is a liuely iocund and (as I may say) a dauncing age, and an age againe that is dull bibling and reeling. The cariages and dispositions of both which ages to some such as Democritus was (that would obserue them duely) might peraduenture seeme as ridiculous and deformed as the gambols of the Satyrs , or the gestures of the Sileni. Of those feares and terrours which Pan is said to be the Author, there may be this wise construction made, namely, That nature hath bredde in euery liuing thing a kinde of care and feare tending to the preseruation of its owne life and being, and to the repelling and shunning of all things hurtfull. And yet Nature knowes not how to keepe a meane, but alwaies intermixes vaine and emptie feares with such as are discreet and profitable; so that all things (if their insides might bee seene) would appeare full of Panicque frights: but men especially in hard and fearefull, and diuers times are wonderfully infatuated with superstition, which indeed is nothing els but a Panicque terrour. Concerning the audacity of Pan in challenging Cupid at wrestling, the meaning of it is, that Matter wants no inclination and desire to the relapsing and dissolution of the world into the old Cha os , if her malice and violence were not restrained and kept in order, by the prepotent vnitie and agreement of things signified by Cupid , or the God of loue; And therefore it was a happie turne for men and all things els, that in that conflict Pan was found too weake and ouercome. To the same effect may be interpreted his catching of Typhon in a net: for howsoeuer there may sometimes happen vast and vnwonted Tumors (as the name of Typhon imports) either in the sea or in the ayre, or in the earth, or els where, yet Nature doth intangle in an intricate toile, and curbe  & restraine, as it were, with a chaine of Adamant the excesses and insolences of these kind of bodies. But for as much as it was Pans good fortune to finde out Ceres as he was hunting, and thought little of it, which none of the other Gods could doe, though they did nothing els but seeke her, and that very seriously, it giues vs this true and graue admonition, That we expect not to receaue things necessary for life and manners from philosophicall abstractions, as from the greater Gods, albeit they applied themselues to no other studie, but from Pan , that is from discreet obseruation,  & experience, and the vniuersall knowledge of the things of this world, whereby (oftentimes euen by chance, and as it were going a hunting) such inuentions are lighted vpon. The quarrell he made with Apollo about Musicke , and the euent thereof conteines a wholsome instruction, which may serue to restraine: mens reasons and iudgements with the reines of sobriety from boasting and glorying in their gifts. For there seemes to be a twofold Harmonie, or Musicke; the one of diuine prouidence, and the other of humane reason. Now to the eares of morrals that is to humane iudgement, the administration of the world and the creatures therein, and the more secret iudgements of God, sound very hard and harsh; which folly albeit it bee well set out with Asses eares, yet notwithstanding these eares are secret, and doe not openly appeare, neither is it perceiued or noted as a deformity by the vulgar. Lastly, it is not to be wondred at, that there is nothing attributed vnto Pan concerning loues, but onely of his mariage with Eccho : For the World or Nature doth enioy it selfe, and in it selfe all things els. Now hee that loues would enioy something, but where there is inough there is no place left to desire. Therefore there can be no wanton loue in Pan or the World, nor desire to obteine any thing (seeing he is contented with himselfe) but onely speeches, which (if plaine) may bee intimated by the Nymph Eccho , or, if more quaint, by Syrinx . It is an excellent inuention, that Pan or the world is said to make choise of Eccho onely (aboue all other speeches or voices) for his wife: for that alone is true philosophy, which doth faithfully render the very words of the world, and is written no otherwise then the world doth dictate, it being nothing els but the image or reflection of it, not adding any thing of its owne, but onely iterates and resounds. It belongs also to the sufficiency or perfection of the World, that he begets no issue: for the World doth generate in respect of its parts, but in respect of the whole, how can it generate, seeing without it there is no body? Not with standing all this, the tale of that tatling Girle faltred vpon Pan may in very deed with great reason be added to the Fable: for by her are represented those vaine and idle paradoxes concerning the nature of things which haue bene frequent in all ages, and haue filled the world with nouelties, fruitles if you respect the matter, changlings if you respect the kind, sometimes creating pleasure, sometimes tediosnes with their ouermuch pratling. 7 . Persevs , or Warre. Perseus is said to haue beene emploied by Pallas for the destroying of Medusa , who was very infestious to the western parts of the world, and especially about the vtmost coasts of Hyberia . A monster so dire and horrid, that by her onely aspect shee turned men into stones. This Medusa alone of all the Gorgons was Mortall, the rest not subiect to death. Perseus therefore preparing himself for this noble enterprise had armes, and guifts bestowed on him by three of the Gods: Mercury gaue him wings annexed to his heeles, Pluto a helmet, Pallas a sheild and a looking Glasse. Notwithstanding (although hee were thus furnished) hee went not directly to Medusa , but first to the Gre ae which by the mother side were sisters to the Gorgons . These Gre ae from their birth were hoare-headed, resembling old women. They had but one onely eye, and one tooth among them all, both which shee that had occasion to goe abroad was wont to take with her, & at her returne to lay them downe againe. This eye and tooth they lent to Perseus : and so finding himselfe throughly furnished for the effecting of his designe hastens towards Medusa . Her hee found sleeping, and yet durst not present himselfe with his face towards her, least shee should awake, but turning his head aside beheld her in Pallases glasse, and (by this meanes directing his blowe) cut of her head, from whose blood gusshing out instatly came Pegasus the flying horse. Her head thus smit of, Perseus bestows on Pallas her sheild, which yet reteined his vertue, that whosoeuer looked vpon it should become as stupid as a stone or like one plannet- strucken. This Fable seemes to direct the preparation and order, that is to be vsed in making of Warre: for the more apt & considerat vndertaking whereof, three graue and wholsome precepts (sauouring of the wisedome of Pallas ) are to be obserued. First, that men doe not much trouble themselues about the conquest of neighbour nations, seeing that priuate possessions,  & Empires are inlarged by different meanes: for in the augmentation of priuate reuenues the vicinity of mens territories is to bee considered: but in the propogation of publike dominions, the occasion and facility of making Warre, and the fruit to bee expected ought to be in steed of vicinity. Certeinly the Romans what time their conquests towards the West scarce reacht beyond Liguria , did yet in the East bring all the Prouinces as far as the mountain Taurus within the compasse of their armes and commaund: and therefore Perseus , although he were borne and bred in the East, did not yet refuse to vndertake an expedition euen to the vttermost bounds of the West. Secondly, there must bee a care had that the motiues of Warre bee iust and honorable: for that begets an alacrity, aswel in the Souldiers that fight, as in the people that affoord pay: it draws on and procures aids, and brings manie other comodities besides. But there is no pretence to take vp armes more pious, then the suppressing of Tyrany , vnder which yoake the people loose there courage, and are cast downe without heart  & vigor, as in the sight of Medusa. Thirdly, it is wisely added; that seeing there were three Gorgons (by which Wars are represented) Perseus vndertooke her onely that was mortal, that is hee made choice of such a kind of War as was likely to bee effected and brought to a period, not pursuing vast and endles hopes. The furnishing of Perseus with necessaries was that which only aduanced his attempt  & drew fortune to bee of his side: For hee had speed from Mercury , concealing of his counsels from Orcus , and Prouidence from Pallas. Neither is it without an Allegory, and that ful of matter to, that those wings of celerity were fastned to Perseus his heeles, and not to his anckles, to his feet and not to his shoulders; because speed and celerity is required, not so much in the first preparationes for Warre, as in those things which second & yeeld ayd to the first: for there is no error in Warre more frequent, then that prosecutions and subsidiary forces doe faile to answer the alacrity of the first onsets. Now for that helmet which Pluto gaue him; powerful to make men inuisible, the moral is plaine: But that two fould guift of prouidence (to wit the sheild  & looking glasse) is ful of morality: for that kind of prouidece which like a sheild auoids the force of blows is not alone needfull, but that also by which the strength, and motions, and councels of the enemy are descried, as in the looking glasse of Pallas. But Perseus albeit he were sufficiently furnished with aid and courage, yet was hee to doe one thing of speciall importance before hee entred the lists with this Monster,  & that was to haue some intelligence with the Gre ae . These Gre ae are treasos which may be termed the Sisters of Warre, not descended of the same stocke, but farre vnlike in nobility of birth; for Warres are generall and heroicall, but Treasons are base and ignoble. Their description is elegant: for they are said to bee grayheaded, and like old women from their birth, by reason that Traitors are continually vext with cares and trepidations. But all their strength (before they breake out into open Rebellions) consists either in an eye or in a tooth; for euery faction alienated from any state contemplates and bites. Besides; this eye and tooth is as it were comon: for whatsoeuer they can learne and know is deliuered and caried from one to another by the hands of faction. And as concerning the tooth, they doe all bite alike, and sing the same song, so that heare one & you heare all. Perseus therefore was to deale with these Gre ae for the loue of their eye and tooth. Their eye to discouer, their tooth to sowe rumors and stirre vp enuy, and to molest and trouble the minds of men. These things therefore being thus disposed and prepared, he addresses himselfe to the action of Warre, and settes vpon Medusa as she slept: for a wise Captain will euer assault his enemy when hee is vnprepared and most secure: and then is there good vse of Pallas her Glasse: For most men, before it come to the push, can acutely prie into and discerne their enemies estate: but the best vse of this Glasse is in the very point of danger, that the manner of it may be so considered, as that the terrour may not discourage, which is signified by that looking into this glasse with the face turned from Medusa. The monsters head being cut off, there follow two effects: The first was the procreation and raising of Pegasus , by which may euidently be vnderstood Fame , that (flying through the world) proclaims victory: The second is the bearing of Medusas head in his sheild, to which there is no kind of defece for excellency comparable: for one famous and memorable Act prosperously effected  & brought to passe, doth restrein the motions and insolencies of enemies, and makes enuy her selfe silent and amazed. 8 Endymion , or a Fauorite. a strange and vnwonted manner bewrayed her affection: for he lying in a Caue framed by nature vnder the mountaine Latmus , shee oftentimes descended from her sphere to enioy his companie as he slept, and after shee had kissed him ascended vp againe. Yet notwithstanding this his idlenes and sleepie security did not any way impaire his estate or fortune; for Luna brought it so to passe that hee alone (of all the rest of the Shepheards) had his flocke in best plight, and most fruitfull. This Fable may haue reference to the nature and disposition of Princes: for they beeing full of doubts and prone to iealousie, doe not easily acquaint men of prying and curious eyes, and as it were of vigilant and wakefull dispositions, with the secret humours and manners of their life: but such rather as are of quiet and obseruant natures, suffering them to doe what they list without further scanning, making as if they were ignorant and perceiuing nothing, but of a stupid disposition and possest with sleepe, yeelding vnto them simple obedience, rather then slie complements: for it pleaseth Princes now and then to descend from their thrones of Maiestie (like Luna from the superiour orbe) and laying aside their Robes of dignity (which alwaies to bee cumbred with, would seeme a kinde of burthen) familiarly to conuerse with men of this condition, which they thinke may bee done without danger; a quality chiefly noted in Tiberius C aesar , who (of all others) was a Prince most seuere, yet such onely were gracious in his fauour, as being well acquainted with his disposition, did yet constantly dissemble as if they knew nothing. This was the custome also of Lewis the eleuenth king of France, a cautious and wily Prince. Neither is it without elegancy, that the caue of Endymion is mentioned in the Fable, because it is a thing vsuall with such as are the fauorites of Princes, to haue certaine pleasant retyring places whither to inuite them for recreation both of body and mind, and that without hurt or preiudice to their fortunes also. And indeed these kind of fauorites are men commonly well to passe: for Princes although peraduenture they promote them not euer to places of honour, yet doe they aduance them sufficiently by their favour and countenance: neither doe they affect them thus onely to serue their owne turne, but are wont to enrich them now and then with great dignities and bounties. 9\. The Sister of the Gyants , or Fame. warre vpon Iupiter , and the other Gods, and by the force of lightning they were resisted  & ouerthrowne. Whereat the Earth being excitated to wrath, in reuenge of her children brought forth Fame , the youngest Sister of the Gyants. Illam, terraparens ira irritata Deorum Extremam (vt perhibent) C aeo Enceladoque sororem, Progenuit. \--- Prouok't by wrothfull Gods the mother Earth Giues Fame the Gyants yongest sister birth. The meaning of the Fable seemes to bee thus, By the Earth is signified the nature of the vulgar, alwaies swolne and malignant, and still broaching new scandals against superiors, and hauing gotten fit oportunity, stirres vp rebels, and seditious persons, that with impious courage doe molest Princes, and endeuour to subuert their estates: but being supprest, the same naturall disposition of the people stil leaning to the viler sort, (being impatient of peace and tranquility) spread rumors, raise malitious slanders, repining whisperings, infamous libelles, and others of that kind, to the detraction of them that are in authority: So as rebellious actions, and seditious reports, differ nothing in kind and blood, but as it were in Sex onely; the one sort being Masculine, the other Feminine. 10\. Actaeon , and Penthevs , or a curious Man. The curiosity of Men, in prying into secrets, and coueting with an indiscreet desire to atteine the knowledge of things forbidden, is set forth by the Ancients in two examples: the one of Act aeon , the other of Pentheus. Act aeon hauing vnawares, and as it were by chance beheld Diana naked, was turned into a Stag, and deuoured by his owne Dogges. And Pentheus climing vp into a tree, with a desire to bee a spectator of the hidden sacrifices of Bacchus , was strucken with such a kind of frensie, as that whatsoeuer he look't vpon, he thought it alwaies double, supposing (among other things) he saw two Sunnes , and two Thebes ; insomuch that running towards Thebes , spying another Thebes , instantly turned back againe, and so kept stil running forward and backward with perpetuall vnrest. Eumenidum veluti demens videt agmina Pentheus, Et Solem geminum, & duplices se ostendere Thebas. Pentheus amaz'd doth troops of furies spie, And Sunne and Thebes seeme dooble to his eye. The first of the Fables pertains to the secrets of Princes : the second to diuine mysteries. For those that are neare about Princes, and come to the knowledge of more secretes then they would haue them, doe certainly incurre great hatred. And therefore (suspecting that they are shot at,  & opportunities watcht for their ouerthrow) doe lead their liues like Stagges fearefull and full of suspition. And it happens oftentimes that their Seruants and those of their houshould (to insinuate into the Princes fauor) doe accuse them to their destruction: for against whomsoeuer the Princes displeasure is knowne, looke how many seruants that man hath, and you shall find them for the most part so many traytors vnto him, that his end may proue to bee like Act aeons. The other is the misery of Pentheus : for they that by the height of knowledge in nature and philosophy, hauing climed, as it were, into a tree, doe with rash attempts (vnmindfull of their frailtie) pry into the secrets of diuine mysteries, and are iustly plagued with perpertuall inconstancy, and with wauering and perplexed conceits: for seeing the light of nature is one thing, and of grace another, it happens so to them as if they saw two Sunnes . And seeing the actions of life, and decrees of will doe depend of the vnderstanding, it follows that they doubt, and are inconstant no lesse in will then in opinion, and so in like manner they may bee said to see two Thebes : for by Thebes (seeing there was the habitation and refuge of Pentheus ) is meant the ende of actions. Hence it comes to passe that they knowe not whither they goe, but as distracted and vnresolued in the scope of their intentions, are in all things caried about with sudden passions of the mind. 11 Orphevs , or Philisophy. The tale of Orpheus , though common, had neuer the fortune to bee fitly applyed in euery point. It may seeme to represent the image of Philosophy: for the person of Orpheus (a man admirable and diuine, and so excellently skilled in all kinde of harmony, that with his sweet rauishing musicke he did as it were charme and allure all things to follow him) may cary a singular description of Philosophy: for the labours of Orpheus doe so far exceed the labors of Hercules , in dignity  & efficacy, as the works of wisdom, excell the works offortitude. Orpheus for the loue hee bare to his wife (snacht as it were from him by vntimely death) resolued to goe downe to Hell with his Harpe, to try if hee might obtaine her of the infernall powers. Neither were his hopes frustrated: for hauing appeased them with the melodious sound of his voice and touch, preuailed at length so farre, as that they granted him leaue to take her away with him, but on this condition that shee should follow him, and hee not to looke backe vpon her, till he came to the light of the vpper world, which he (impatient of, out of loue and care, and thinking that he was in a manner past all danger) neuerthelesse violated, insomuch that the couenant is broken, and shee forthwith tumbles backe againe headlong into hell. From that time Orpheus falling into a deepe melancholy became a contemner of women kind, and bequeathed himselfe to a solitary life in the deserts, where by the same melody of his voice and harpe, hee first drew all manner of wild beasts vnto him, who (forgetfull of their sauage fiercenes, and casting off the precipitate prouocations of lust and fury, not caring to satiate their voracity by hunting after prey) as at a Theater in fawning and reconciled amity one towards another, stand all at the gaze about him, and attentiuely lend their eares to his Musicke. Neither is this all: for so great was the power and alluring force of his harmony, that he drew the woods  & moued the very stones to come and place themselues in an orderly and decent fashion about him. These things succeeding happily and with great admiration for a time, at length certaine Thracian Women (possest with the spirit of Bacchus ) made such a horrid and strange noise with their Cornets, that the sound of Orpheus harp could no more be heard, insomuch as that Harmony, which was the bond of that order and society beeing dissolued, all dissorder began againe, and the beasts (returning to their wonted nature) pursued one another vnto death as before: neither did the trees or stones remaine any longer in their places: and Orpheus himselfe was by these femall Furies torne in pieces, and scattered all ouer the desart. For whose cruell death the riuer Helicon (sacred to the Muses) in horrible indignation, hid his head vnderground, and raised it againe in another place. The meaning of this Fable seemes to be thus. Orpheus musicke is of two sorts, the one appeasing the infernall powers, the other attracting beasts and trees. The first may bee fitly applyed to naturall philosophie, the second to morall or ciuill discipline. The most noble worke of naturall philosophy, is the restitution and renouation of things corruptible, the other (as a lesser degree of it) the preseruation of bodies in their estate, deteining them from dissolution and putrefaction. And if this gift may be in mortals, certenly it can be done by no other meanes then by the due and exquisite temper of nature, as by the melody and delicate touch of an instrument. But seeing it is of all things the most difficult, it is seldome or neuer attained vnto, and in all likely hood for no other reason, more then through curious diligence and vntimely impatience. And therefore Philosophy hardly able to produce so excellent an effect, in a pensiue humour (and not without cause) busies herselfe about humane obiects, and by perswasion and eloquence, insinuating the loue of vertue, equitie, and concord in the minds of men, draws multitudes of people to a society, makes them subiect to lawes, obedient to gouerment, and forgetfull of their vnbridled affections, whilst they giue eare to precepts, and submit themselues to discipline, whence followes the building of houses, erecting of townes; and planting of fields and orchards, with trees and the like, insomuch that it would not be amisse to say, that euen thereby stones, and woods were called together, and setled in order. And after serious tryall made and frustrated about the restoring of a body mortall; this care of ciuill affaires followes in his due place: Because by a plaine demonstration of the vneuitable necessity of death, mens minds are moued to seeke eternity by the fame and glory of their merits. It is wisely also said in the Fable, that Orpheus was auerse from the loue of women and mariage, because the delights of wedlocke and loue of children doe for the most part hinder men from enterprising great and noble designes for the publique good, holding posterity a sufficient step to immortalitie without actions. Besides euen the very workes of wisedome, (although amongst all humane things they doe most excell) doe neuerthelesse meete with their periods. For it happens that (after kingdomes and commonwealths haue flourished for a time) euen tumults, and seditions, and warres arise; in the midst of which hurly burlies: first, lawes are silent, men returne to the prauity of their natures, fields and townes are wasted and depopulated, and then, (if this fury continue) learning and philosophy must needs be dismembred, so that a few fragments onely, and in some places will bee found like the scattered boords of shipwracke, so as a barbarous age must follow; and the streames of Helicon being hid vnder the earth vntill (the viciffitude of things passing) they breake out againe and appeare in some other remote nation, though not perhaps in the same climate. 12\. Coelvm , or Beginnings. Wee haue it from the Poets by tradition, that Coelum was the ancientest of the Gods, and that his mebers of generation were cut off by his soone Saturne. Saturne had many children, but deuoured them as sonne as they were borne. Iupiter onely escapt, who being come to mans estate, thrust Saturne his father into hell, and so vsurped the kingdome. Moreouer he pared off his fathers genitals with the same faulchin that Saturne dismembred Coelum , and cast them into the Sea, from whence came Venus . Not long after this, Iupiter (being scarce setled and confirmed in this kingdome) was inuaded by two memorable warres. The first of the Titans , in the suppressing of which Sol (who alone of all the Titans fauouring Iupiters side) tooke exceeding great pains. The second was of the Gyants, whom Iupiter himselfe destroied with thunderboults, and so all warres being ended, hee raigned secure. This Fable seemes enigmatically to shew from whence all things tooke their beginning, not much differring from that opinion of philosophers, which Democritus afterwards laboured to mainteine, attributing eternity to the first Matter and not to the world. In which he comes somewhat neere the truth of diuine writ, telling vs of a huge deformed Masse, before the beginning of the six daies worke. The meaning of the Fable is this, By Coelum may be vnderstood that vast concauity, or vaulted compasse that comprehends all matter: and by Saturne may bee meant the matter it selfe, which takes from its Parent all power of generating: for the vniuersality or whole bulke of matter alwaies remaines the same, neither increasing or diminishing in respect of the quality of its nature: But by the diuers agitations and motions of it were first produced imperfect, & ill agreeing copositios of things, making, as it were certaine worlds for proofes or assaies, and so in processe of time a perfect fabricke or structure was framed, which should still reteine and keepe his forme. And therefore the gouerment of the first age was shaddowed by the kingdome of Saturne , who for the frequent dissolutions  & short continuances of things was aptly fained to deuoure his children. The succeeding gouerment was deciphered by the raigne of Iupiter , who confined those continuall mutations vnto Tartarus , a place signifying perturbation. This place seemes to bee all that middle space between the lower Superficies of Heauen and the center of the Earth: in which all perturbation and fragility and mortality or corruption are frequent. During the former generation of things in the time of Saturns raigne, Venus was not borne: for so long as in the vniuersality of Matter, discord was better  & more preualent then concord, it was necessary that there should bee a totall dissolution or mutation, and that in the whole fabricke. And by this kind of generation were creatures produced before Saturne was depriued of his genitalles. When this ceased, that other which is wrought by Venus , immediately came in, consisting in setled and preualent concord of things, so that Mutation should bee onely in respect of the parts, the vniuersall fabrick remaining whole and inuiolate. Saturne they say was deposed  & cast downe into Hell, but not destroyed and vtterly extinguisht, because there was an opinion that the world should relapse into the old Chaos & interregnum againe, which Lucretius praied might not happen in his time. Quod procul a nobis, flectat fortuna gubernans Et ratio potius quam res persuadeat ipsa. Oh guiding prouidence bee gratious, That this Doomes-day bee farre remou'd from vs. And graunt that by vs it may bee expected, Rather then on vs in our times effected. for afterward the world should subsist by its owne quantity and power. Yet from the beginning there was no rest: for in the celestiall Regions there first followed notable mutations, which by the power of the Sunne (predominating ouer superior bodies) were so quieted, that the state of the world should be conserued: and afterward (in inferior bodies) by the suppressing and dissipating of inundations, tempests, winds, and generall earthquakes, a more peacefull  & durable agreement and tranquility of things followed. But of this Fable it may conuertibly be said, that the Fable conteines philosophy, and philosophy againe the Fable: For weeknow by faith, that all these things are nothing els but the long-since ceasing and failing Oracles of Sence, seeing that both the Matter and Fabrick of the world are most truly referred to a Creator. 13\. Protevs , or Matter The Poets say that Proteus was Neptunes heard-man, a graue Syer, and so excellent a prophet, that hee might well bee termed thrice excellent: for hee knew not onely things to come; but euen things past as well as present, so that besides his skill in diuination, hee was the messenger and interpreter of all Antiquities and hidden mysteries. The place of his abode was a huge vast caue, where his custome was euery day at noone to count his flock of Sea-calues, and then to goe to sleep. Moreouer he that desired his aduice in any thing, could by no other meanes obteine it, but by catching him in Manacles, and holding him fast therewith; who neuerthelesse to bee at liberty would turne himselfe into all manner of formes and wonders of nature, sometimes into fire, somtimes into water, somtimes into the shape of beasts and the like, till at length he were restored to his owne forme againe. This Fable may seeme to vnfold the secrets of nature, and the properties of Matter . For vnder the person of Proteus , the first Matter (which next to God is the auncientest thing) may be represented: for Matter dwelles in the concauity of heauen as in a Caue. He is Neptunes bond-man, because the operations and dispensations of Matter are chiefly exercised in liquid bodies. His flocke or heard seemes to be nothing but the ordinary Species of sensible creatures, plants, and mettals: in which Matter seemes to diffuse and as it were spend it selfe, so that after the forming and perfecting of thesekinds, (hauing ended as it were her taske) shee seemes to sleepe and take her rest, not attempting the composition of any more Species . And this may be the Morall of Proteas his counting of his flocke, and of his sleeping. Now this is said to be done, not in the morning, nor in the euening, but at noone, to wit at such time as is most fit, and conuenient for the perfecting and bringing forth of Species out of Matter, duely prepared and predisposed, and in the middle, as it were, betweene their beginnings and declinations, which wee know sufficiently (out of the holy history) to be done about the time of the Creation: for then by the power of that diuine world ( Producat ) Matter at the Creators commaund did congregate itselfe (not by ambages or turnings, but instantly) to the production of its worke into act and the constitution of Species . And thus farre haue wee the Narration of Proteus (free, and vnrestrained) together with his flocke compleat: for the vniuersality of things with their ordinary structures and compositions of Species beares the face of matter not limited and constrained, and of the flocke also of materiall beings. Neuerthelesse, if any expert Minister of Nature shall encounter Matter by main force, vexing, and vrging her with intent and purpose to reduce her to nothing; shee contrariwise (seeing annihilation and absolute destruction cannot be effected but by the omnipotency of God) being thus caught in the straites of necessitie, doth change and turne her selfe into diuers strange formes and shapes of things, so that at length (by fetching a circuit, as it were) shee comes to a period, and (if the force continue) betakes her selfe to her former being. The reason of which constraint or binding will bee more facile and expedite, if Matter be laide hold on by Manacles, that is, by extremities. Nowe whereas it is fained that Proteus was a prophet, well skilled in three differences of times, it hath an excellent agreement with the nature of Matter: for it is necessary that he that will knowe the properties and proceedings of Matter, should comprehend in his vnderstanding the summe of all things, which haue bene, which are, or which shall be, although no knowledge can extend so farre as to singular and indiuiduall beings. 14 Memnon , or a youth too forward. The Poets say, that Memnon was the sonne of Aurora , who (adorned with beautifull armour, and animated with popular applause) came to the Troiane warre: where (in a rash boldnes, hasting vnto, and thirsting after glory) he enters into single combate with Achilles the valiantest of all the Grecians , by whose powerfull hand he was there slaine. But Iupiter pittying his destruction, sent birds to modulate certaine lamentable and dolefull notes at the Solemnization of his funerall obsequies. Whose statue also (the Sunne reflecting on it with his morning beames) did vsually (as is reported) send forth a mournfull sound. This Fable may be applied to the vnfortunate destinies of hopefull young men, who like the sonnes of Aurora (puft vp with the glittering shew of vanity and ostentation) attempt actions aboue their strength, and prouoke and presse the most valiant Heroes to combate with them, so that (meeting with their ouer-match) are vanquished and destroyed, whose vntimely death is oft accompanied with much pitty and commiseration. For among all the disasters that can happen to mortals, there is none so lamentable and so powrefull to moue compassion as the flower of vertue cropt with too sudden a mischance. Neither hath it beene often knowne that men in their greene yeares become so loathsome and odious, as that at their deathes either sorrow is stinted, or commiseration moderated: but that lamentation and mourning doe not onely flutter about their obsequies like those funerall birds; but this pittifull commiseration doth continue for a long space, and especially by occasions and new motions, and beginning of great matters, as it were by the morning raies of the Sunne , their passions and desires are renued. 15\. Tithonvs , or Satiety (desirous for euer to enioy his company) petitioned Iupiter that he might neuer dye, but (through womanish ouersight) forgetting to insert this clause in her petition, that he might not withall grow old and feeble, it followed that he was onely freed from the condition of mortality, but for old age, that came vpon him in a maruelous and miserable fashion, agreeable to the state of those who cannot die, yet euery day grow weaker and weaker with age. Insomuch that Iupiter (in commiseratio of this his misery) did at length metamorphose him into a Grashopper. This Fable seemes to bee an ingenuous Character or description of pleasure, which in the beginning,  & as it were in the morning seemes to be so pleasant and delightfull that men desire they might enjoy & monopolize it for euer vnto theselues, vnmindfull of that Satiety and loathing, which (like old age) will come vpon them before they bee aware. And so at last (when the vse of pleasure leaues men, the desire & affection not yet yeilding vnto death) it comes to passe that men please themselues onely by talking and commemorating those things which brought pleasure vnto them in the flower of their age, which may be obserued in libidinous persons, and also in men of military professions: the one delighting in beastly talke, the other boasting of their valorous deeds like Grashoppers, whose vigor consists onely in their voyce. 16\. Ivnos Svtor , or Basenesse. The Poets say, that Iupiter to enioy his lustfull delights tooke vpon him the shape of sundry creatures, as of a Bull, of an Eagle, of a Swane, and of a goulden shower: but being a Sutor to Iuno hee came in a forme most ignoble and Base, an obiect full of contempt and scorne, resembling indeed a miserable Cuckow, weather-beaten with raine  & tempest, nummed, quaking, and halfe dead with coulde. This Fable is wise and seemes to beetaken out of the bowels of morallity, the sence of it being this, That men boast not too much of themselues, thinking by ostentation of their owne worth to insinuate themselues into estimation and fauor with men, the successe of such intentions being for the most part measured by the nature and disposition of those to whom men sue for grace: Who if of themselues they bee indowed with no guifts and ornaments of nature, but are onely of haughtie and malignant spirits (intimated by the person of Iuno ) then are Sutors to know that it is good policy to omit all kind of apparance that may any way shew their owne least praise or worth: and that they much deceiue themselues in taking any other course. Neither is it inough to shew deformity in obsequiousnes, vnlesse they also appeare euen abiect and base in their very persons. 17\. Cvpid , or an Atome. That which the Poets say of Cupid or Loue cannot properly be attributed to one and the selfe same person; and yet the difference is such, that (by reiecting the confusion of persons) the similitude may be receaued. They say that Loue is the ancientest of all the Gods, and of all things els except Chaos , which they hould to bee a cotemporary with it. Now as touching Chaos , that by the ancients was neuer dignified with diuine honour, or with the title of a God. And as for Loue , they absolutly bring him in without a father, onely some are of opinion that hee came of an Egge which was laid by Nox , and that on Chaos hee begot the Gods and all things els. There are fower things attributed vnto him, perpetuall infancy, blindnes, nakednes, and an Archery. There was also another Loue which was the yongest of the Gods, and he, they say, was the Sonne of Venus . On this also they bestowe the attributes of the elder Loue , as in some sort well applie vnto him, This Fable tends and lookes to the Cradle of Nature, Loue seeming to bee the appetite or desire of the first matter, or (to speake more plaine) the naturall motion of the Atome , which is that ancient and onely power that formes and fashions all things out of Matter, of which there is no Parent, that is to say, no cause, seeing euery cause is as a parent to its effect. Of this power or vertue there can bee no cause in Nature (as for God , we alwaies except him) for nothing was before it, and therefore no efficient cause of it. Neither was there any thing better knowen to nature, and therefore neither Genus nor Forme . Wherefore whatsoeuer it is, Positiue it is, and but inexpressible. Moreouer, if the manner and proceeding of it, were to be conceiued, yet could it not bee by any cause, seeing that (next vnto God) it is the cause of causes, it selse onely without any cause. And perchance there is no likelyhood, that the manner of it may bee conteined or comprehended within the narrow compasse of humane search. Not without reason therefore is it fained to come of an Egge which was layed by Nox . Certenly the diuine Philosopher grants so much. Eccl. 3\. 11. Cuncta fecit tempestatibus suis pulchra, & mundum tradidit disputationibus eorum, ita tamen vt non inueniat homo opus quod operatus est Deus, a principio ad finem. That is, he hath made euery thing beautifull in their seasons, also he hath set the world in their meditations, yet cannot man find out the worke that God hath wrought, from the beginning euen to the end. For the principall law of Nature, or power of this desire, created (by God) in these parcels of things, for concurring and meeting together (from whose repetitions and multiplications, all variety of creatures proceeded and were composed) may dazzle the eies of mens vnderstandings, and comprehended it can hardly bee. The Greeke Philosophers are obserued to be very acute and diligent in searching out the materiall principles of things: but in the beginnings of motion (wherein consists all the efficacy of operation) they are negligent and weake, and in this that wee handle, they seeme to be altogether blind and stammering: for the opinion of the Peripatetickes concerning the appetite of Matter caused by Priuation, is in a manner nothing els but words, which rather sound then signifie any realey. And those that referre it vnto God, doe very well, but then they leape vp, they ascend not by degrees: for doubtles there is one chiese lawe subordinate to God, in which all naturall things concurre and meete, the same that in the fore-cited Scripture is demonstrated in these words. Opus, quod operatus est Deus a principin vsque ad finem, the worke that God hath wrought from the beginning euen to the ende. But Democritus which entred more deepely into the consideration of this point after he had conceaued an Atome with some small dimension and forme, he attributed vnto it one onely desire, or first motion simply or absolutely, and another comparatiuely or in respect: for hee thought that all things did properly tend to the center of the world, whereof those bodies which were more materiall descended with swifter motion, and those that had lesse matter did on the contrary tend vpward. But this meditation was very shallow conteyning lesse then was expedient: for neither the turning of the celestiall bodies in a round, nor shutting and opening of things may seeme to be reduced or applied to this beginning. And as for that opinion of Epicurus concerning the casuall declination and agitation of the Atome , it is but a meere toy, and a plaine euidence, that he was ignorant of that point. It is therefore more apparent (then wee could wish) that this Cupid or Loue remaines as yet clouded vnder the shades of Night . Now as concerning his attributes: Hee is elegantly described with perpetuall infancie or childhood, because compound bodies they seeme greater and more stricken in yeeres: Whereas the first seeds of things or Atoms , they are little and diminute, and alwaies in their infancie. Hee is also well fained to bee naked, because all compound bodies to a man rightly iudging, seeme to be apparelled and clothed, and nothing to be properly naked but the first particles of things. Concerning his blindnes, the Allegory is full of wisedome: for this Loue or Desire (whatsoeuer it be) seemes to haue but little prouidence, as directing his pace and motion by that which it perceaues neerest, not vnlike blind men that goe by feeling: More admirable then, must that chiefe diuine prouidence be, which (from things emptie and destitute of prouidence, and as it were blinde) by a constant and fatall law produceth so excellent an order and beautie of things. The last thing which is attributed vnto Loue is Archery , by which is meant, that his vertue is such, as that it works vpon a distant obiect: because that whatsoeuer operates afarre off, seems to shoot, as it were, an arrowe. Wherefore whosoeuer holds the being both of Atomes and Vacuity , must needs inferre, that the vertue of the Atome reacheth to a distant obiect: for if it were not so, there could bee no motion at all, by reason of the interposition of Vacuity , but all things would stand stone still, and remaine immoueable. Now as touching that other Cupid or Loue , he may well be termed the yongest of the Gods, because he could haue no beeing, before the constitution of Species : And in his description the Allegorie may bee applied and traduced to manners: Neuerthelesse he holds some kinde of conformitie with the Elder: For Venus doth generally stirre vp a desire of coniunction  & procreation, and Cupid her sonne doth apply this desire to some indiuiduall nature, so that the generall disposition comes from Venus , the more exact sympathy from Cupid , the one deriued from causes more neere, the other from beginnings more remote and fatall, and as it were from the elder Cupid , of whom euery exquisite sympathie doth depend. 18 Diomedes , or Zeale. Diomedes flourishing with great fame and glory in the Troian warres, and in high fauour with Pallas was by her instigated (beeing indeed for warder then he should haue bene) not to forbeare Venus a iote, if he encountred with her in fight, which very boldly hee performed, wounding her in the right arme. This presumptuous fact hee caried cleare for a while, and being honored and renowned for his many heroicke deeds; at last returned into his owne countrey, where finding himselfe hard besteed with domesticke troubles, fled into Italy , betaking himselfe to the protection of Forreiners, where in the beginning he was fortunate and royally entertained by King Daunus with sumptuous gifts, raising many statues in honour of him throughout his dominions. But vpon the very first calamity that hapned vnto this nation whereunto he was fled for succor: King Daunus enters into a conceipt with himselfe that he had entertained a wicked guest into his family, and a man odious to the Gods and an impugner of their Diuinity, that had dared with his sword to assault and wound that Goddesse, whom in their religion they held it sacrilege so much as to touch. Therfore, that he might expiat his countreyes guilt (nothing respecting the duties of hospitality, when the bonds of Religion tyed him with a more reuerend regarde) suddenly flew Diomedes , commanding withall, that his trophes  & statues should be abolished and destroyed. Neither was it safe to lament this miserable destinie; But euen his companions in armes, whilst they mourned at the funerall of their Captaine, and fild all the places with plaints and lamentations, were suddenly metamorphosed into birds like vnto Swannes, who when their death approacheth sing melodious and mournfull hymnes. This Fable hath a most rare and singular subiect: for in any of the poeticall records, wherein the Heroes are mentioned, wee find not that any one of them, besides Diomedes , did euer with his sword offer violence to any of the Deities . And indeed, the Fable seemes in him to represent the nature and fortune of man, who of himselfe, doth propound and make this as the end of all his actions, to worship some diuine power, or to follow some sect of Religion, though neuer so vaine and superstitious, and with force and armes to defend the same: For although those bloudy quarrels for religion were vnknowen to the Ancients, (the heathen Gods not hauing so much as a touch of that ielousie, which is an attribute of the true God) yet the wisedome of the ancient times seemes to be so copious and full, as that, what was not knowen by experience, was yet comprehended by meditation and fictions. They then that endeuour to reforme and conuince any sect of Religion, (though vaine, corrupt, and infamous, shadowed by the person of Venus ) not by the force of argument, and doctrine, and holinesse of life, and by the weight of examples and authoritie, but labour to extirpate and root it out by fire and sword, and tortures, are incouraged, it may be, thereunto by Pallas , that is by the acrity of Prudence and seuerity of iudgement, by whose vigour and efficacie, they see into the falsity and vanity of these errours. And by this their hatred of prauity, and good zeale to Religion, they purchase to themselues great glory, and by the vulgar (to whom nothing moderate can bee gratefull) are esteemed and honoured as the onely supporters of trueth and religion, when others seeme to bee luke-warme, and full of feare. Yet this glory and happines doth seldome endure to the end, seeing euery violent prosperity, if it preuent not alteration by an vntimely death, growes to be vnprosperous at last: For if it happen that by a change of gouerment this banished and depressed Sect gette strength, and so beare vp againe, then these zealous men so fierce in opposition before, are condemned, their very names are hatefull, and all their glory ends in obloquie. In that Diomedes is saide to bee murthered by his hoast, it giues vs to vnderstand that the difference of religion breeds deceit and treachery, euen among neerest acquaintance. Now in that lamentation and mourning was not tollerated but punished, it puts vs in mind, that let there be neuer so nefarious an acte done, yet there is someplace left for commiseration and pitty, that euen those that hate offences, should yet in humanity commiserate offenders, and pitty their distresse, it being the extremitie of euill when Mercy is not suffered to haue commerce with misery. Yea euen in the cause as well of religion as impietie, many men may be noted and obserued to haue bene compassionate. But on the contrary the complaints and moanes of Diomedes followers, that is, of men of the same sect and opinion are wont to bee shrill and loude, like Swannes, or the birds of Diomedes . In whom also that part of the allegory is excellent to signifie, that the last words of those that suffer death for religion like the songs of dying Swannes, doe wonderfully worke vpon the minds of men, and strike and remaine a long time in their senses and memories. 19\. Deadalvs , or Mechanique. Mechanicall wisedome and industry, and in it vnlawfull science peruerted towrong ends, is shadowed by the Ancients vnder the person of D aedalus , a man ingenious, but execrable. This D aedalus (for murthering his fellow seruant that emulated him) being bannished, was kindly interteined (during his exile) in many cities, and Princes Courts: for indeed he was the raiser and builder of many goodly structures, as well in honour of the Gods, as for the beautie and magnificence of cities, and other publick places: but for his works of mischeese he is most notorious. It is he which framed that engine which Pasiphae vsed to satisfie her lust in companying with a bull, so that by this his wretched industrie and pernicious deuice, that Monster Minotaur (the destruction of so many hopefull youthes) tooke his accursed and infamous beginning, and studying to couer and increase one mischeife with another, for the security  & preseruation of this Monster hee inuented and built a Labyrinth, a worke for intent and vse most nefarious and wicked, for skill and workmanship famous and excellent. Afterward that he might not bee noted onely for works of mischeefe, but be sought after as well for remedies, as for instruments of destruction; hee was the Author of that ingenious deuice concerning the clue of threed, by which the Labyrinth was made passable without any let. This D aedalus was persecuted by Minos with great seuerity, diligence and inquiry, but he always found the meanes to auoid and escape his tyranny. Lastly he taught his sonne Icarus to flie, but the nouice in ostentation of his art soaring too high, fell into the Sea, and was drowned. The Parable seemes to be thus: In the beginning of it may be noted that kind of enuie or emulation that lodgeth and wonderfully swaies and domineers amongst excellent artificers, there being no kinde of people more reciprocally tormented with bitter and deadly hatred then they. The bannishment also of Dedalus (a punishment inflicted on him against the rules of policy and prouidence) is worth the noting: for Artificers haue this prerogatiue to find enterteinment and welcome in all countries, so that exile to an excellent workman can hardly bee termed a punishment, wheareas other conditions and states of life can scarce liue out of their owne country. The admiration of artificers is propogated and increast in forrein and strange nations, seeing it is a naturall and inbred disposition of men to value their owne countrimen (in respect of Mechanicall works) lesse then strangers. Concerning the vse of Mechanicall arts, that which follows is plaine. The life of man is much beholding to them, seeing many things (conducing to the ornament of religion, to the grace of ciuill discipline, and to the beautifying of all humane kind) are extracted out of their treasuries: and yet notwithstanding from the same Megazine or storehouse are produced instruments both of lust and death, for (to omit the wiles of bandes) we well know how farre exquisit poisons, warlike engines, and such like mischeifs the effects of Mechanicall inuentions) doe exceed the Minotaur himselfe in malignity  & sauage cruelty. Moreouer, that of the Labyrinth is an excellent Allegory, whereby is shadowed the nature of Mechanicall sciences: for all such handicrafte works as are more ingenious and accurate, may bee compared to a Labyrinth in respect of subtilty and diuers intricate passages, and in other plaine resemblances, which by the eye of iudgement can hardly be guided and discerned, but onely by the line of experience. Neither is it impertinently added, that hee which inuented the intricate nooks of the Labyrinth, did also shew the comodity of the clue: for Mechanicall arts are of ambiguous vse, seruing as well for hurt as for remedy, and they haue in a manner power both to loose and bind themselues. Vnlawfull trades, and so by consequence arts themselues are often persecuted by Minos , that is by lawes, which doe condemne them and prohibit men to vse them. Neuerthelesse they are hid and retained euery where, finding lurking holes, and places of receipt, which was well obserued by Tacitus of the Mathematicians and figure flingers of his time in a thing not much vnlike; Genus (inquit) hominum quod in ciuitate nostra semper & retinebitur & vetabitur. There is a kind of men (saith hee) that will always abide in our Citie though always forbidde. And yet notwithstanding vnlawfull & curious arts of what kind soeuer, in tract of time, when they cannot performe what they promise, doe fall from the good opinion that was held of them (no otherwise then Icarus fell downe from the skies) they growe to be contemned and scorned, and so perish by too much ostentation. And, to say the truth, they are not so happily restreined by the raines of law, as bewraied by their owne vanitie. 20\. Ericthonivs , or Imposture. The Poets fable that Uulcan sollicited Minerua for her virginity, and impatient of deniall with an inflamed desire offered her violence, but in struggling his Seed fell vpon the ground, whereof came Ericthonius , whose body from the middle vpward was of a comely and apt proportion, but his thighes and legges like the taile of an Eele small and deformed. To which Monstrosity he being conscious, became the first inuentor of the vse of Chariots, whereby that part of his body which was well proportioned might be seene, and the other which was vgly and vncomly might bee hid. This strange and prodigious fiction may seeme to shew, that art which (for the greate vse it hath of fire) is shaddowed by Uulcan , although it labour by much striuing with corporeall substances to force Nature and to make her subiect to it (shee being for her industrious works rightly represented by Minerua ) yet seldome or neuer attaines the end it aimes at, but with much adoe  & great paines (wresting as it were with her) comes short of its purpose, and produceth certain imperfect birthes and lame works, faire to the eye, but weake and defectiue in vse with many Impostors (with-much subtilty and deceipt) set to view, and cary about, as it were, in triumph, as may for the most part be noted in Chymicall productions, and other Mechanicall subtilties & nouelties, especially when (rather prosecuting their intent, then reclining their errors) they rather striue to ouercome nature by force, then sue for her imbracements by due obsequiousnes and obseruance. 21\. Devcalion , or Restitution. The Poets say, that (the people of the old world being destroyd by a generall deluge) Deucalion and Pirrha were onely left aliue; who praying with feruent and zealous deuotion, that they might know by what meanes to repaire mankind: had answere from an Oracle that they should obteine what they desired, if taking the bones of their mother they cast them behind their backs, which at first struck them with great amazement and dispaire, seeing (all things being defaced by the flood) it would be an endles worke to find their mothers sepulcher, but at length they vnderstood that by bones the stones of the earth (seeing the earth was the mother of all things) were signified by the Oracle. This Fable seemes to reueale a secret of Nature, and to correct an error familiar to mens conceipts: for through want of knowledge, men thinke that things may take renouation and restauration from their putrefaction and dregs, no otherwise then the Phoenix from the ashes, which in no case can be admitted, seing such kind of materials, when they haue fulfilled their periods, are vnapt for the beginings of such things: wee must therefore looke back to more common principles. 22\. Nemesis , or the Vicissitude of things. Nemesis is said to be a Goddesse venerable vnto all, but to bee feared of none but potentates and fortunes fauorites. She is thought to be the Daughter of Oceanus and Nox . Shee is purtrayed with wings on her shoulders, and on her head a Coronet; bearing in her right hand a iauelin of Ash, and in her left a Pitcher with the similitudes of Æ thiopians engrauen on it: and lastly shee is described sitting on a Hart. The Parable may bee thus vnfolded. Her name Nemesis doth plainly signifie Reuenge or Retribution, her office and administration being (like a Tribune of the people) to hinder the constant  & perpetuall felicity of happy men, and to interpose her word, veto , I forbid the continuance of it, that is, not onely to chastice insolency, but to intermix prosperity (though harmles and in a meane) with the vicissitudes of aduersity, as if it were a custome, that noe mortall man should be admitted to the Table of the Gods but for sport. Truly when I read that Chapter, wherein Caius Plinius hath collected the misfortunes and miseries of Augustus C aesar , whom of all men I thought the most happy, who had also a kind of arte to vse and inioy his fortune, and in whose mind might be noted neither pride, nor lightnes, nor nicenes, nor disorder, nor melancholly (as that he had appointed a time to die of his owne accord) I then deemed this Goddesse to be great and powerfull, to whose altar so worthy a sacrifice as this was drawen. The Parents of this Goddesse were Oceanus and Nox , that is, the vicissitude of things, and diuine iudgement obscure and secret: for the alterations of things are aptly represented by the Sea, in respect of the continuall ebbing and flowing of it: and hidden prouidence is well set forth by the Night: for euen the nocturnall Nemesis (seeing humane iudgement differs much from diuine) was seriously obserued by the heathen. \--- Cadit & Ripheus instissimus vnus, Qui fuit ex Teucris, & seruantissimus equi, Dijs aliter visum \--- That day by Greekish force was Ripheus slaine, So iust and strict obseruer of the law, As Troy within her walles did not containe A better man: Yet God then good it saw. Shee is described with wings, because the changes of things are so sudden, as that they are seene, before foreseene: for in the Records of all ages, wee finde it for the most part true, that great potentates, and wise men haue perished by those misfortunes which they most contemned, as may be obserued in Marcus Cicero , who being admonished by Decius Brutus of Octauius Cesars hippocriticall friendshippe and hollow heartednes towards him, returnes this answere; Te autem, mi Brute, sicut debeo, amo, quod istud quicquid est nugarumme scire voluisti. I must euer acknowledge my selfe ( Deare Brutus ) beholding to thee, in loue, for that thou hast bene so carefull to acquaint mee with that which I esteeme but as a needles trifle to be doubted. Nemesis is also adorned with a Coronet, to shew the enuious and malignant disposition of the vulgar, for when fortunes fauourites and great potentates come to ruine, then doe the common people reioyce, setting as it were a crowne vpon the head of reuenge. The Iauelin in her right hand points at those, whom shee actually strikes and pierceth thorow. And before those, whom shee destroyes not in their calamitie and misfortune, shee euer presents that blacke and dismall spectacle in her left hand: for questionles to men sitting, as it were, vpon the pinnacle of prosperity, the thoughts of death & painfulnes of sicknes and misfortunes, perfidiousnes of friends, treachery of foes, change of state, and such like, seeme as ougly to the eye of their meditations, as those Ethiopians pictured in Nemesis her Pitcher. Virgill in describing the battell of Actium , speakes thus elegantly of Cleopatra. Regina in medijs patrio vocat agmina sistro, Nec dum, etiam, geminos a tergo respicit angues. The Queene amidst this hurly burly stands, And with her Countrey Timbrell calles her bands; Not spying yet where crawld behind her backe Two deadly Snakes with venom speckled blacke. But not long after, which way soeuer shee turned, troops of Ethiopians were still before her eies. Lastly, it is wisely added, that Nemesis rides vpon an Hart , because a Hart is a most liuely creature. And albeit it may be, that such as are cut off by death in their youth, preuent and shunne the power of Nemesis , yet doubtles such, whose prosperity and power continue long, are made subiect vnto her, and lye as it were troden vnder her feete. 23\. Achelovs , or Battell. contended for the mariage of Deianira , the matter drew them to combate, wherein Achelous tooke vpon him many diuers shapes, for so was it in his power to doe, and amongst others, transforming himselfe into the likenes of a furious wild Bull, assaults Hercules and prouokes him to fight. But Hercules for all this, sticking to his old humane forme, couragiously encounters him,  & so the combate goes roundly on. But this was the euent, that Hercules tore away one of the Buls hornes, wherewith he being mightily daunted and greeued, to ransome his horne againe, was contented to giue Hercules in exchange thereof, the Anealthean horne, or Cornu-Copia. This Fable hath relation vnto the expeditions of warre, for the preparations thereof on the defensiue parte (which exprest in the person of Achelous ) is very diuers and vncertaine. But the inuading party is most commonly of one sorte, and that very single, consisting of an armie by land, or perhaps of a Nauie by Sea. But for a King that in his owne Territorie expects an enemy, his occasions are infinite. He fortifies townes, he assembles men out of the countreyes and villages, hee raiseth Cittadels, hee builds and breakes downe bridges, hee disposeth garrisons, and placeth troopes of Soldiers on passages of riuers, on ports, on Mountaines, and ambushes in woods, and is busied with a multitude of other directions, insomuch that euery day he prescribeth new formes and orders, and then at last hauing accomodated all things compleat for defence, he then rightly represents the forme and manner of a fierce fighting Bull. On the other side, the inuader his greatest care is, the feare to bee distressed for victuals in an enemy Countrey. And therefore affects chiefly to hasten on battell: for if it should happen that after a fielde fought, he proue the victor, and as it were breake the horne of the Enemy, then certainly this follows that his enemy being strucken with terrour and abased in his reputation, presently bewraies his weaknes, and seeking to repaire his losse, retyres himselfe to some strong hold, abandoning to the Conqueror the spoile and sacke of his countrey and citties: which may well bee termed a type of the Amalthean horne. 24\. Dionysvs , or Passions. They say that Semele Iupiters Sweet-heart (hauing bound her Paramour by an irreuocable oath to grant her one request which shee would require) desired that he would accompany her in the same forme, wherein hee accompanied Iuno : which he granting (as not able to deny) it came to passe that the miserable wench was burnt with lightning. But the infant which she bare in her wombe, Iupiter the Father tooke out, and kept it in a gash which hee cut in his thigh, till the moneths were compleat that it should be borne. This burden made Iupiter somewhat to limpe, whereupon the child (because it was heauy and troublesome to its Father, while it lay in his thigh) was called Dionysus . Being borne, it was committed to Proserpina for some yeeres to be nurs't, and being growne vp, it had such a maiden face, as that a man could hardly iudge whether it were a boy or a girle. He was dead also, and buried for a time, but afterward reuiued. Being but a youth he inuented, and taught the planting and dressing of Vines, the making also and vse of wine, for which becomming famous and renowned, he subiugated the world, euen to the vttermost bounds of India . He rode in a Chariot drawen with Tygers . There danc't about him certaine deformed hobgoblins called Cobali, Acratus , and others yea euen the Muses also were some of his followers. Hee tooke to wife Ariadne , forsaken and left by Theseus . The tree sacred vnto him was the Iuie . He was held the inuentor and institutor of Sacrifices, and Ceremonies, and full of corruption and cruelty. Hee had power to strike men with fury or madnes; for it is reported, that at the celebration of his Orgies, two famous worthies, Pentheus and Orpheus were torne in pieces by certaine franticke women, the one because he got vpon a tree to behold their ceremonies in these sacrifices, the other for making melodie with his harpe. And for his gests, they are in a manner the same with Iupiters. There is such excellent morality coucht in this Fable, as that Morall philosophy affoords not better: for vnder the person of Bacehus is described the nature of affection, passion, or perturbation, the mother of which (though neuer so hurtful) is nothing els but the obiect of apparent good in the eies of Appetite. And it is alwaies conceiued in an vnlawfull desire rashly propounded and obteined, before well vnderstood and considered, and when it beginnes to growe, the Mother of it, which is the desire of apparent good by too much feruency is destroyed and perisheth: Neuerthelesse (whilst it is yet an imperfect Embrio ) it is nourished and preserued in the humane soule, (which is as it were a father vnto it, and represented by Iupiter ) but especially in the inferiour parte thereof, as in a thigh, where also it causeth so much trouble and vexation, as that good determinations and actions are much hindred and lamed thereby, and when it comes to be confirmed by consent and habite, and breakes out, as it were, into act, it remaines yet a while, with Proserpina as with a Nurse, that is, it seekes corners and secret places, and, as it were, caues vnder ground, vntill (the reines of shame and feare being laid aside in a pampered audaciousnes) it either takes the pretext of some vertue, or becomes altogether impudent and shameles. And it is most true, that euery vehement passion is of a doubtfull sexe, as being masculine in the first motion, but f aeminine in prosecution. It is an excellent fiction that of Bacchus his reuiuing: for passions doe somtimes seeme to be in a dead sleepe, and as it were vtterly extinct, but wee should not thinke them to be so indeed, no, though they lay, as it were, in their graue; for, let there be but matter and opportunitie offered, and you shall see them quickly to reuiue againe. The inuention of wine is wittily ascribed vnto him, euery affection being ingenious and skilfull in finding out that which brings nourishment vnto it; And indeed of all things knowen to men, Wine is most powerfull and efficacious to excite and kindle passions of what kind soeuer, as being in a manner, a common Nurse to them all. Againe his conquering of Nations, and vndertaking infinite expeditions is an elegant deuice; For desire neuer rests content with what it hath, but with an infinite and vnsatiable appetite still couets and gapes after more. His Chariot also is well said to be drawen by Tygers : for as soone as any affection shall from going afoot, be aduanc't to ride in a Chariot, and shall captiuate reason, and leade her in a triumph, it growes cruell, vntamed, and fierce, against whatsoeuer. withstands or opposeth it. It is worth the noting also, that those ridiculous hobgoblins are brought in, dancing about his Chariot: for euery passion doth cause, in the eies, face, and gesture, certaine vndecent, and ill-seeming, apish, and deformed motions, so that they who in any kind of passion, as in anger, arrogancy, or loue, seeme glorious and braue in their owne eies, do yet appeare to others misshapen and ridiculous. In that the Muses are saide to be of his company, it shewes that there is no affection almost which is not soothed by some Art, wherein the indulgence of wits doth derogate from the glory of the Muses, who (when they ought to bee the Mistresses of life) are made the waiting maids of affections. Againe, where Bacchus is saide to haue loued Ariadne that was reiected by Theseus ; it is an Allegory of speciall obseruation: for it is most certaine, that passions alwaies couet and desire that which experience forsakes, and they all knowe (who haue paide deare for seruing and obeying their lusts) that whether it be honour, or riches, or delight, or glory, or knowledge, or any thing els which they seeke after, yet are they but things cast off, and by diuers men in all ages, after experience had, vtterly reiected and loathed. Neither is it without a mysterie, that the Iuie was sacred to Bacchus : for the application holds, first, in that the Iuie remaines greene in winter. Secondly, in that it stickes too, embraceth, and ouertoppeth so many diuers bodies, as trees, walles, and edifices. Touching the first, euery passion doth by resistance, and reluctation, and as it were by an Antiparistasis (like the Iuie of the colde of winter) growe fresh and lusty. And as for the other euery predominate affection doth againe (like the Iuie ) embrace and limite all humane actions and determinations, adhering and cleauing fast vnto them. Neither is it a wonder, that superstitious rites, and ceremonies were attributed vnto Bacchus , seeing euery giddy headed humour keepes in a manner, Reuell-rout in false religions: or that the cause of madnes should bee ascribed vnto him, seeing euery affection is by nature a short fury, which (if it growe vehement, and become habituall) concludes madnes. Concerning the rending and dismembring of Pentheus and Orpheus , the parable is plaine, for euery preualent affection is outragious and seuere against curious inquiry, and wholsome and free admonition. Lastly, that confusion of Iupiter and Bacchus , their persons may be well transferred to a parable, seeing noble and famous acts, and remarkable and glorious merits, doe sometimes proceed from vertue, and well ordered reason, and magnanimitie, and sometimes from a secret affection, and hidden passion, which are so dignified with the celebritie of same and glory, that a man can hardly distinguish betweene the actes of Bacchus , and the gests of Iupiter. 25\. Atalanta , or Gaine. Atalanta who was reputed to excell in swiftnesse, would needs challenge Hippomanes at a match in running. The conditions of the Prize were these: That if Hippomanes wonne the race, he should espouse Atalanta ; If he were outrunne, that then hee should forfeit his life. And in the opinion of all, the victorie was thought assured of Atalantas side, beeing famous as shee was for her matchlesse and inconquerable speed, whereby shee had bene the bane of many. Hippomanes therefore bethinkes him how to deceiue her by a tricke, and in that regarde prouides three golden apples, or balles which he purposely caried about him. The race is begunne, and Atalanta gets a good start before him. Hee seeing himselfe thus cast behind, being mindfull of his deuice, throwes one of his golden balles before her, and yet not outright, but somewhat of the one side, both to make her linger, and also to draw her out of the right course: shee out of a womanish desire, (beeing thus enticed with the beautie of the golden apple) leauing her direct race, runnes aside, and stoops to catch the ball: Hippomanes the while holds on his course, getting thereby a great start, and leaues her behind him: But shee by her owne naturall swiftnes, recouers her lost time, and gets before him againe. But Hippomanes still continues his sleight, and both the second and third times casts out his balles, those enticing delayes; and so by craft and not by his actiuitie winnes the race and victorie. This Fable seemes allegorically to demonstrate a notable conflict betweene Art and Nature: for Art (signified by Atalanta ) in its worke (if it be not letted and hindred) is farre more swift then Nature, more speedie in pace; and sooner attaines the end it aimes at, which is manifest almost in euery effect: As you may see in fruit-trees, whereof those that growe of a kernell are long ere they beare, but such as are grafted on a stocke a great deale sooner. You may see it in Clay, which in the generation of stones, is long ere it become hard, but in the burning of Brickes, is very quickly effected. Also in morall passages you may obserue, that it is a long time ere (by the benefit of Nature) sorrowe can be asswaged and comfort attained, whereas Philosophy (which is, as it were, Art of liuing) taries not the leasure of time, but doth it instantly, and out of hand; And yet this prerogatiue and singular agility of Art is hindred by certaine golden apples, to the infinite preiudice of humane proceedings: for there is not any one Art or Science which constantly perseueres in a true and lawfull course, till it come to the proposed ende or marke: but euer and anone makes stops, after good beginnings, leaues the race, and turnes aside to profite and commoditie, like Atalanta. Declinat curs us, aurumg volubile tollit. Who doth her course forsake, The rolling gold to take. And therefore it is no wonder that Art hath not the power to conquer Nature, and by pact or lawe of conquest, to kill and destroy her: but on the contrary, it falles out, that Art becomes subiect to Nature, and yeelds the obedience, as of a wife to her husband. 26\. Promethevs , or the State of man. The Ancients deliuer, that Prometheus made a man of Clay, mixt with certaine parcels taken from diuers animales who studying to maintaine this his worke by Art (that he might not be accounted a founder onely, but a propagator of humane kinde) stole vp to heauen with a bundle of twigs, which hee kindling at the Chariot of the Sun, came downe againe, and communicated it with men: And yet they say, that (notwithstanding this excellent worke of his) he was requited with ingratitude, in a treacherous conspiracie: For they accused both him and his inuention to Iupiter , which was not so taken as was meet it should, for the information was pleasing to Iupiter and all the Gods. And therefore in a merry mood, graunted vnto men, not onely the vse of fire, but perpetuall youth also, a boone most acceptable and desireable. They being, as it were, ouerioyed, did foolishly lay this gift of the Gods vpon the backe of an asse, who being wonderfully opprest with thirst, and neere a fountaine, was tolde by a Serpent (which had the custody thereof) that hee should not drinke, vnlesse he would promise to giue him the burden that was on his backe. The silly Asse accepted the condition, and so the restauration of youth (sold for a draught of water) past from men to Serpents. But Prometheus full of malice, being reconciled vnto men, after they were frustrated of their gift, but in a chafe yet with Iupiter , feared not to vse deceit in Sacrifice: for hauing killed two Bulles, and in one of their hides wrapt vp the flesh and fat of them both, and in the other onely the bones, with a great shew of religious deuotion, gaue Iupiter his choise, who (detesting his fraude and hypocrisie, but taking an occasion of reuenge) chose that that was stuft with bones, and so turning to reuenge (when hee saw that the insolencie of Prometheus would not be repressed, but by laying some grieuous affliction vpon mankind, in the forming of which, hee so much bragged and boasted) commanded Vulcan , to frame a goodly beautifull woman, which beeing done, euery one of the Gods bestowed a gift on her; whereupon shee was called Pandora . To this woman they gaue in her hand, a goodly Box, full of all miseries and calamities, onely in the bottome of it, they put Hope : With this Box shee comes first to Prometheus , thinking to catch him, if peraduenture, he should accept it at her hands, and so open it: which he neuerthelesse, with good prouidence and foresight refused. Whereupon shee goes to Epimetheus (who, though brother to Prometheus , yet was of a much differing disposition) and offers this Box vnto him, who, without delay, tooke it, and rashly opened it, but when hee sawe that all kind of miseries came fluttering about his eares, being wise too late, with great speed and earnest indeauour, clapt on the couer, and so, with much adoe, retained Hope sitting alone in the bottome. At last Iupiter laying many and grieuous crimes to Prometheus his charge (as namely that he had stollen fire from heauen, that in contempt of his Maiestie, he sacrificed a bulles hide stuft with bones, that he scornfully reiected his gift, and besides all this that hee offered violence to Pallas ) cast him into chaines, and doomd him to perpetuall torment: and by Iupiters command, was brought to the mountaine Caueasus , and there bound fast to a pillar that he could not stirre; there came an Eagle also, that euery day sate tyring vpon his liuar, and wasted it, but as much as was eaten in the day, grew againe in the night, that matter for torment to worke vpon might neuer decay. But yet, they say, there was an end of this punishment: for Hercules crossing the Ocean in a Cup, which the Sun gaue him, came to Caucasus , and set Prometheus at libertie, by shooting the Eagle with an arrowe. Moreouer in some nations there were instituted in the honor of Prometheus , certaine games of Lampbearers, in which they that striued for the prize, were wont to carie torches lighted; which, who so suffered to goe out, yeelded the place and victory to those that followed, and so cast backe themselues, so that whosoeuer came first to the marke with his torch burning, got the prize. This Fable demonstrates and presseth many true and graue speculations, wherein some things haue bene heretofore well noted, others not so much as toucht. Prometheus doth cleerely and elegantly signifie Prouidence : For in the vniuersality of nature, the fabricque and constitution of Man onely was by the Ancients pict out and chosen, and attributed vnto Prouidence , as a peculiar worke. The reason of it seemes to bee, not onely in that the nature of man is capable of a minde and vnderstanding, which is the seate of Prouidence , and therefore it would seeme strange and incredible that the reason and minde should so proceed and flowe from dumbe and deafe principles, as that it should necessarily be concluded, the soule of man to be indued with prouidence, not without the example, intention, and stampe of a greater prouidence. But this also is chiefly propounded, that man is as it were, the center of the world, in respect of finall causes, so that if man were not in nature, all things would seeme to stray and wander without purpose, and like scattered branches (as they say) without inclination to their ende: for all things attend on man, and he makes vse of, and gathers fruit from all creatures: for the reuolutions and periods of Starres make both for the distinctions of times, and the distribution of the worlds site. Meteors also are referred to the Presages of tempests; and winds are ordained, as well for nauigation, as for turning of Milles, and other engines: and plants, and animals of what kind soeuer, are vsefull either for mens houses, and places of shelter, or for raiment, or food, or medicine, or for ease of labour, or in a word, for delight and solace, so that all things seeme to worke, not for themselues, but for man. Neither is it added without consideration, that certaine particles were taken from diuers liuing creatures,  & mixt & tempered with that clayie masse, because it is most true that of all things comprehended within the compasse of the vniuerse, Man is a thing most mixt and compounded, insomuch that hee was well termed by the Ancients, A little world: for although the Chymicques doe, with too much curiositie, take and wrest the elegancie of this word ( Microcosme ) to the letter, contending to finde in man all minerals, all vegetables and the rest, or any thing that holds proportion with them, yet this proposition remaines sound and whole, that the body of man, of all material beings, is found to bee most compounded, and most organicall, whereby it is indued and furnished with most admirable vertues and faculties. And as for simple bodies, their powers are not many, though certaine and violent, as existing without being weakned, diminished, or stented by mixture: for the multiplicitie and excellencie of operation haue their residence in mixture and composition, and yet neuerthelesse, man in his originals, seemes to be a thing vnarmed, and naked, and vnable to helpe it selfe, as needing the aide of many things; therefore Prometheus made haste to finde out fire, which suppeditates and yeelds comfort and helpe, in a manner, to all humane wants and necessities: so that if the soule be the forme of formes, and if the hand be the instrument of instruments; fire deserues well to be called the succour of succours, or the helpe of helpes, which infinite waies affoords ayde and assistance to all labours and mechanicall artes, and to the sciences themselues. The manner of stealing this fire is aptly described, euen from the nature of the thing: It was, as they say, by a bundle of twigs held to touch the Chariot of the Sunne: for twigs are vsed in giuing blowes or stripes, to signifie clearely, that fire is ingendred by the violent percussion, and mutuall collision of bodies, by which their materiall substances are attenuated, and set in motion, and prepared to receiue the heat or influence of the heauenly bodies, and so, in a clandestine manner, and as it were, by stealth, may be said to take and snatch fire from the Chariot of the Sunne. There followes next a remarkable part of the parable, That men in steed of gratulation, and thanksgiuing, were angry, and expostulated the matter with Prometheus , insomuch that they accused both him and his inuention vnto Iupiter , which was so acceptable vnto him, that hee augmented their former commodities with a new bountie. Seemes it not strange, that ingratitude towards the authour of a benefit (a vice that, in a manner, containes all other vices) should find such approbation and reward? No, it seemes to be otherwise: for the meaning of the Allegory is this, That mens outcries vpon the defects of nature and Arte, proceed from an excellent disposition of the minde, and turne to their good, whereas the silencing of them is hatefull to the Gods, and redounds not so much to their profit: For they that infinitly extoll humane nature, or the knowledge they possesse, breaking out into a prodigall admiration of that they haue and enioy, adoring also those sciences they professe, would haue them be accounted perfect; they doe first of all shewe little reuerence to the diuine nature, by equalizing, in a manner, their owne defects with Gods perfection; Againe, they are wonderfull iniurious to men, by imagining they haue attained the highest step of knowledge (resting themselues contented) seeke no further. On the contrary, such as bring nature and Art to the barre with accusations and billes of complaint against them, are indeed of more true and moderate iudgements: for they are euer in action, seeking alwaies to finde out new inuentions. Which makes mee much to wonder at the foolish and inconsiderate dispositions of some men, who (making themselues bondslaues to the arrogancy of a fewe) haue the philosophy of the Peripateticques (containing onely a portion of Gr aecian wisedome, and that but a small one neither) in so great esteeme, that they hold it, not onely an vnprofitable, but a suspicious, and almost hainous thing, to lay any imputation of imperfection vpon it. I approue rather of Empedocles his opinion, (who like a madman, and of Democritus his iudgement, who with great moderation complained how that all things were inuolued in a mist) that wee knew nothing, that wee discerned nothing, that trueth was drowned in the depthes of obscuritie, and that false things were wonderfully ioynd and intermixt with true (as for the new Academie that exceeded all measure) then of the confident and pronuntiatiue schoole of Aristotle . Let men therefore be admonished, that by acknowledging the imperfections of Nature and Arte, they are gratefull to the Gods, and shall therby obtaine new benefits and greater fauours at their bountifull hands, and the accusation of Prometheus their Authour and Master, (though bitter and vehement) will conduce more to their profit, then to be esfuse in the congratulation of his inuention: for in a word, the opinion of hauing inough, is to be accounted one of the greatest causes of hauing too little. Now as touching the kind of gift which men are said to haue receiued in reward of their accusation (to wit, an euer fading flower of youth) it is to shewe, that the Ancients seemed not to dispaire of attaining the skill by meanes and medicines, to put off old age, and to prolong life, but this to bee numbred rather among such things as (hauing bene once happily attained vnto) are now through mens negligence and carelesnes, vtterly perished and lost; then among such as haue bene alwaies denyed and neuer graunted: For they signifie and shewe, that by affoording the true vse of fire, and by a good and sterne accusation and conuiction of the errours of Arte, the diuine bounty is not wanting vnto men in the obtaining of such gifts, but men are wanting to themselues in laying this gift of the Gods vpon the backe of a silly and slowpaced asse, which may seeme to bee Experience, a stupid thing, and full of delay: from whose leasurely and snaile-like pace, proceeds that complaint of lifes breuity, and Artes length. And, to say the trueth, I am of this opinion, that those two faculties Dogmaticall and Empiricall , are not as yet well ioynd and coupled together, but as new gifts of the Gods imposed either vpon philosophicall abstractions, as vpon a flying bird, or vpon slowe and dull experience as vpon an asse. And yet, me thinkes, I would not entertaine an ill conceit of this asse, if it meet not for the accidents of trauaile and thirst: for I am perswaded, that who so constantly goes on, by the conduct of experience, as by a certaine rule and method, and not couets to meet with such experiments by the way, as conduce, either to gaine or ostentation (to obtaine which, he must be faine to lay down and sell this burden) may proue no vnfit porter to beare this new addition of diuine munificence. Now, in that this gift is said to passe from men to serpents, it may seeme to bee added to the Fable for ornaments sake in a manner, vnlesse it were inserted to shame men, that hauing the vse of that celestiall fire, and of so many arts, are not able to get vnto themselues such things as Nature it selfe bestowes vpon many other creatures. But that sudden reconciliation of men to Prometheus , after they were frustrated of their hopes, containes a profitable and wise note, she wing the leuity and temerity of men in new experiments: for if they haue not present successe answerable to their expectation, with too suddaine haste desist from that they beganne, and with precipitancy returning to their former experiments are reconciled to them againe. The state of man in respect of Arts, and such things as concerne the intellect, being now described, the parable passeth to Religion: For after the planting of Arts followes the setting of diuine principles, which hypocrisie hath ouerspread and polluted. By that twofold Sacrifice therefore is elegantly shadowed out, the persons of a true religious man and an hypocrite. In the one is contained fatnes, which (by reason of the inflamation and fumes thereof) is called the portion of God, by which his affection and zeale (tending to Gods glory, and ascending towards heauen) is signified. In him also are contained the bowels of charity, and in him is founde that good and wholsome flesh. Whereas in the other, there is nothing but dry and naked bones, which neuerthelesse doe stuffe vp the hide, and make it appeare like a faire and goodly sacrifice: By this may well be meant those externall and vainerites, and emptie Ceremonies by which men doe oppresse and fill vp the sincere worshippe of God, things composed rather for ostentation then any way conducing to true piety. Neither doe they hold it sufficiet to offer such mock-sacrifices vnto God, except they also lay them before him, as if he had chosen and bespoke them. Certainly the Prophet in the person of God, doth thus expostulate concerning this choise. Esa.58.5. Num tandem hoc est illud ieiunium, quod ELEGI , vt homo animam suam in diem vnum affligat, & caput instar iunceoe demittat? Is it such a fast that I haue chosen, that a man should afflict his soule for a day, and to bow downe his head like a Bull- rush? Hauing now toucht the state of Religion, the parable conuerts it selfe to the manners and conditions of humane life. And it is a common, but apt, interpretation, by Pandora to be meant pleasure  & voluptuousnes, which (when the ciuill life is pampered with too much Arte, and culture, and superfluitie) is ingendred, as it were, by the efficacy of fire, and therefore the worke of voluptuousnes is attributed vnto Vulcan , who also himselfe doth represent fire. From this doe infinite miseries, together with too late repentance, proceed and ouerslowe the minds, and bodies, and fortunes of men, and that not onely in respect of particular estates, but euen ouer kingdomes and common wealthes: for from this fountaine haue wars, and tumults, and tyrannies deriued their originall. But it would bee worth the labour, to consider how elegantly and proportionably this Fable doth deliniate two conditions, or (as I may say) two tables or examples of humane life, vnder the persons of Prometheus and Epimetheus : for they that are of Epimetheus his sect, are improuident, not foreseeing what may come to passe hereafter, esteeming that best which seemes most sweete for the present; whence it happens that they are ouertaken with many miseries, difficulties and calamities, and so leade their liues almost in perpetuall affliction, but yet notwithstanding they please their fancy, and out of ignorance of the passages of things, doe entertaine many vaine hopes in their mind, whereby they sometimes (as with sweet dreames) solace themselues, and sweeten the miseries of their life, But they that are Prometheus his schollers, are men endued with prudence, foreseeing things to come warily, shunning and auoyding many euils and misfortunes. But to these their good properties they haue this also annexed, that they depriue themselues, and defraud their Genius of many lawfull pleasures, and diuers recreations, and (which is worse) they vexe and torment themselues with cares and troubles and intestine feares: For beeing chained to the pillar of necessitie, they are afficted with innumerable cogitations (which because they are very swift, may bee fitly compared to an Eagle) and those griping, and, as it were, gnawing and deuouring the liuer, vnlesse sometimes, as it were by night, it may bee they get a little recreation and ease of mind, but so, as that they are againe suddenly assaulted with fresh anxieties and feares. Therefore this benefit happens to but a very few of either condition, that they should retaine the commodities of prouidence, and free themselues from the miseries of care and perturbation; neither indeed can any attaine vnto it, but by the assistance of Hercules , that is, fortitude, and constancie of minde, which is prepared for euery euent, and armed in all fortunes, foreseeing without feare, enjoying without loathing, and suffering without impatience. It is worth the noting also, that this vertue was not naturall to Prometheus , but aduentitiall,  & from the indulgence of another: for no in-bred and naturall fortitude is able to encounter with these miseries. Moreouer this vertue was receiued and brought vnto him from the remotest parte of the Ocean , and from the Sunne, that is, from wisedome as from the Sunne, and from the meditation of inconstancie, or of the waters of humane life, as from the sailing vpon the Ocean, which two, Virgill hath well conioyned in these verses. F aelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas; Quiq metus omnes, & inexorabile fatum. Subiecit pedibus, strepitumque Acheront is auari. Happie is hee that knowes the cause of things, And that with dauntlesse courage treads vpon All feare and Fates, relentlesse threatnings, And greedy throat of roaring Acheron. Moreouer, it is elegantly added for the consolation and confirmation of mens minds, that this noble Heroe crost the Ocean in a Cuppe or Panne, least peraduenture, they might too much feare that the straits and frailty of their nature will not be capable of this fortitude and constancie. Of which very thing Seneca well conceiued when he said, Magnum est habere simul fragilitatem hominis, & securitatem Dei. It is a great matter for humane frailty and diuine securitie to bee one and the selfe same time, in one and the selfe same Subject. But now we are to steppe backe a little to that, which by premeditation wee past ouer, lest a breach should be made in those things that were so linckt together. That therefore which I would touch here is that last crime imputed to Prometheus , about seeking to bereaue Minerua of her virginity: for questionlesse, it was this hainous offence that brought that punishment of deuouring his liuer vpon him; which is nothing els but to shewe, that when we are puft vp with much learning and science, they goe about oftentimes, to make euen diuine Oracles subiect to sense and reason, whence most certainly followes a continual distractio,  & restlesse griping of the mind; we must therefore with a sober and humble iudgement distinguish betweene humanitie and diuinitie, and betweene the Oracles of sense, and the my fteries of faith, vnlesse an hereticall religion, and a commentitious philosophy be pleasing vnto vs. Lastly, it remaines that wee say something of the games of Prometheus performed with burning torches, which againe hath reference to arts and sciences, as that fire, in whose memory and celebration, these games were instituted, and it containes in it a most wise admonition, that the perfection of sciences is to be expected from succession, not from the nimblenesse and promptnes of one onely authour: for they that are nimblest in course, and strongest in contention, yet happily haue not the lucke to keepe fire still in their torch; seeing it may be as well extinguished by running too fast, as by going too slowe, And this running and contending with lampes, seemes long since to be intermitted, seeing all sciences seeme euen now to flourish most in their first Authours, Aristotle, Galene, Euclid and Ptolomie , succession hauing neither effected, nor almost attempted any great matter. It were therefore to bee wished, that these games in honour of Prometheus or humane nature were again restored,  & that matters should receiue successe by combate and emulation, & not hang vpon any one mans sparkling and shaking torch. Men therefore are to bee admonished to rouse vp their spirits, & trie their strengths and turnes, and not referre all to the opinions and braines of a few. And thus haue I deliuered that which I thought good to obserue out of this so wel knowen and common Fable; and yet I will not denie but that there may bee some things in it, which haue an admirable consent with the mysteries of christian religion, and especially that sailing of Hercules in a Cuppe (to set Prometheus at libertie) seemes to represent an image of the diuine Word comming in flesh as in a fraile vessell to redeeme Man from the slauery of Hell . But I haue interdicted my penne all liberty in this kinde, lest I should vse strange fire at the altar of the Lord. 27\. Scylla and Icarvs , or the Middle-way. Mediocrity or the Middle-way is most commended in morall actions, in contemplatiue sciences not so celebrated, though no lesse profitable and commodious: But in political imployments to be vsed with great heed and iudgement. The Ancients by the way prescribed to Icarus , noted the mediocrity of manners: and by the way betweene Scylla and Charybdis (so famous for difficulty and danger) the mediocritie of intellectuall operations. Icarus being to crosse the sea by flight, was commanded by his Father that hee should flie neither too high nor too lowe; for his wings being ioynd with waxe, if he should mount too high, it was to be feared lest the waxe, would melt by the heat of the Sunne; and If too lowe, least the mistie vapours of the Sea would make it lesse tenacious: But he in a youthfull iollitie soaring too high, fell downe headlong and perished in the water. The parable is easie and vulgar: for the way of vertue lies in a direct path betweene excesse and defect. Neither is it a wonder that Icarus perished by Excesse, seeing that Excesse, for the most part, is the peculiar fault of youth, as Defect is of age, and yet of too euill and hurtfull waies, youth commonly makes choise of the better, defect being alwaies accounted worst: for whereas excesse containes some sparkes of magnanimitie,  & like a bird claimes kindred of the Heauens, defect onely like a base worme crawles vpon the earth. Excellently therefore foresaid Heraclitus, Lumen siccum, optima anima . A drie light is the best soule: for if the soule contract moisture from the earth it becomes degenerate altogether. Againe on the other side, there must be moderation vsed, that this light be subtilized by this laudable siccity, and not destroyed by too much feruency. And thus much euery man, for the most part, knowes. Now they that would saile betweene Scylla & Charybdis must be furnished, as well with the skill, as prosperous successe of nauigation: for if their shippes fall into Scylla they are split on the Rocks: if into Charybdis they are swallowed vp of a Gulfe. The morall of this parable (which we will but briefly touch, although it containe matter of infinite contemplation) seemes to be this, that in euery Art and Science, and so in their rules and Axiomes, there bee a meane obserued betweene the rocks of distinctions and the gulfes of vniuersalities, which two are famous for the wracke both of wittes and artes. 28\. Sphinx , or Science. They say that Sphinx was a monster of diuers formes, as hauing the face and voice of a virgine, the wings of a bird, and the talents of a Griphin. His abode was in a mountaine neere the Citie of Thebes , he kept also the high waies, and vsed to lie in ambush for travellers, and so to surprize them; to whom (being in his power) he propounded certaine darke and intricate riddles, which were thought to haue bene giuen and receiued of the Muses. Now if these miserable captiues were not able instantly to resolue and interprete them in the middest of their difficulties and doubts, shee would rend and teare them in pieces. The Countrey groaning a long time vnder this calamitie, the Thebanes at last propounded the kingdome as a reward vnto him that could interprete the riddles of Sphinx , there beeing no other way to destroy her. Whereupon Oedipus (a man of piercing and deepe iudgement, but maimed and lame by reason of holes bored in his feet) moued with the hope of so great a reward, accepted the condition, and determined to put it to the hazard, and so with an vndaunted and bolde spirit, presented himselfe before the monster, who asking him what creature that was, which after his birth went first vpon foure feet, next vpon two, then vpon three, and lastly vpon foure againe; answered forthwith that it was Man, which in his infancie immediatly after birth crawles vpon all foure, scarce ventring to creepe, and not long after stands vpright vpon two feet, then growing old he leanes vpon a staffe wherewith hee supports himself, so that hee may seeme to haue three feet, and at last in decreped yeeres, his strength failing him, he falles groueling againe vpon foure, and lyes bed-rid. Hauing therefore by this true answere gotten the victorie, hee instantly slew this Sphinx , and (laying her bodie vpon an asse) leades it, as it were, in triumph: and so (according to the condition) was created king of the Thebanes. This Fable containes in it no lesse wisedome then elegancie, and it seemes to point at Science, especially that which is ioyned with practise: for Science may not absurdly be termed a monster, as beeing by the ignorant and rude multitude alwaies held in admiration. It is diuers in shape and figure by reason of the infinite variety of subiects wherein it is conuersant. A maiden face and voice is attributed vnto it for its gratious countenance and volubilitie of tongue. Wings are added because Sciences and their inuentions, doe passe and flie from one to another, as it were in a moment, seeing that the communication of Science is as the kindling of one light at another. Elegantly also is it fained to haue sharpe and hooked talents, because the Axioms and arguments of Science doe so fasten vpon the mind and so strongly apprehend and hold it, as that it cannot stirre or euade, which is noted also by the diuine Philosopher. Eccl.12.11. Verba sapientum (saith he) sunt tanquam acules & veluti claui in altum defixi . The words of the wise are like goads, and like nailes driuen farre in. Moreouer, all Science seemes to be placed in steepe and high mountaines: as being thought to be a loftie and high thing, looking downe vpon ignorance with a scornefull eye. It may bee obserued and seene also a great way, and farre in compasse, as things set on the toppes of mountaines. Furthermore, Science may well be fained to besette the high waies, because which way so euer we turne in this progresse and pilgrimage of humane life, wee meete with some matter or occasion offered for contemplation. Sphinx is saide to haue receiued from the Muses diuers difficult questions and riddles, and to propound them vnto men, which remaining with the Muses are free (it may be) from sauage crueltys for so long as there is no other ende of studie and meditation, then to know; the vnderstanding is not rackt and imprisoned, but enioyes freedome and libertie, and euen in doubts and variety findes a kind of pleasure and delectation: but when once these. Æ nigmaes are deliuered by the Muses to Sphinx , that is, to practise, so that it bee sollicited and vrged by action, and election, and determination; then they beginne to be troublesome and raging; and vnlesse they be resolued and expedited, they doe wonderfully torment and vexe the minds of men, distracting, and in a manner rending them into sundry parts. Moreouer there is alwaies a twofold condition propounded with Sphinx her Æ nigmaes; To him that doth not expound them, distraction of minde, and to him that doth, a kingdome: for he that knowes that which he sought to knowe, hath attained the end he aimed at, and euery artificer also commands ouer his worke. Of Sphinx her riddles, there are generally two kinds; some concerning the nature of things, others touching the nature of Man. So also there are two kindes of Emperies, as rewards to those that resolue them: the one ouer nature, the other ouer men; for the proper and chiefe end of true naturall philosophy is to command and sway ouer naturall beeings; as bodies, medicines, mechanicall workes, and infinite other things; although the schoole (being content with such things as are offered, and pryding it selfe with speeches) doth neglect realties, and workes, treading them, as it were, vnder foote. But that Aenigma propounded to Oedipus (by meanes of which hee obtained the Thebane Empire) belonged to the nature of man: For whosoeuer doth throughly consider the nature of man, may be, in a manner, the contriuer of his owne fortune, and is borne to command, which is wel spoken of the Romane Arts. Turegere imperio populos, Romane memento: H ae tibi erunt artes. \--- Romane remember that with scepters awe Thy Realmes thou rule. These arts let be thy lawe. It was therefore very apposit, that Angustus C aesar (whether by premeditation or by chance) bare a Sphinx in his Signet: for hee (if euer any) was famous not onely in politicall gouernment, but in all the course of his life; he happily discouered many new Aenigmaes concerning the nature of Man, which if he had not done with dexteritie and promptnesse, he had oftentimes fallen into imminent danger and destruction. Moreouer it is added in the Fable, that the body of Sphinx when shee was ouercome was laide vpon an Asse: which indeed is an elegant fiction, seeing there is nothing so accute and abstruse, but (beeing well vnderstood and diuulged) may be apprehended by a slowe capacitie. Neither is it to be omitted, that Sphinx was ouercome by a Man lame in his feet: for when men are too swift of foot and too speedy of pace in hasting to Sphinx her Aenigmaes , it comes to passe that (shee getting the vpper hand) their wits and mindes are rather distracted by disputations, then that euer they come to command by workes and effects. 29\. Proserpina , or Spirit. Pluto they say, being made king of the infernall dominions (by that memorable diuision) was in despaire of euer attaining any one of the superiour Goddesses in mariage, especially if he should venter to court them either with words or with any amorous behauiour, so that of necessitie he was to lay some plot to get one of them by rapine, taking therefore the benefit of opportunitie, he caught vp Proserpina (the daughter of Ceres , a beautifull virgine) as shee was gathering Narcissus flowers in the meadowes of Sicily , and caried her away with him in his Coach to the Subterranean dominions, where shee was welcomed with such respect, as that shee was stiled the Lady of Dis . But Ceres her mother, when in no place shee could finde this her onely beloued daughter, in a sorrowfull humour and distracted beyond measure, went compassing the whole earth with a burning torch in her hand, to seeke and recouer this her lost child. But when shee saw that all was in vaine, supposing peraduenture that she was caried to Hell, shee importuned Iupiter with many teares and lamentations, that shee might be restored vnto her again,  & at length preuailed thus farre, That if she had tasted of nothing in Hell, shee should haue leaue to bring her from thence. Which condition was as good as a deniall to her petition, Proserpina hauing already eaten three graines of a Pome-granat . And yet for all this, Ceres gaue not ouer her suite, but fell to prayers and moanes afresh. Wherefore it was at last granted, that (the yeere being diuided) Proserpina should by alternate courses, remaine one sixe moneths with her husband, and other six moneths with her mother. Not long after this Theseus and Perithous in an ouer hardy aduenture attempted to fetch her from Plutos bed, who being wearie with trauell and sitting downe vpon a stone in Hell to rest themselues, had not the power to rise againe, but sate there for euer. Proserpina therefore remained Queene of Hell, in whose honour there was this great priuiledge granted, That although it were enacted that none that went downe to Hell should haue the power euer to returne from thence, yet was this singular exception annexed to this law, that if any presented Proserpina with a golden bough, it should bee lawfull for him to come and goe at his pleasure. Now there was but one onely such bough in a spacious and shady groue, which was not a plant neither of it selfe. but budded from a tree of another kinde, like a rope of Gumme, which beeing pluckt of another would instantly spring out. This Fable seemes to pertaine to nature, and to diue into that rich and plentifull efficacy and variety of subalternall creatures, from whom whatsoeuer wee haue is deriued, and to them doth againe returne. By Proserpina the Auncients meant that  aethereall spirite which (beeing separated from the vpper globe) is shut vp and detained vnder the earth (represented by Pluto ) which the Poet well expressed thus. Siue recens tellus, seductag nuper ab alto Aethere, cognati retinebat semina coeli. Whither the youngling Tellus (that of late Was from the high-read Aether seperate) Did yet containe her teeming wombe within The liuing seeds of Heauen, her neerest kin. This spirit is fained to be rapted by the Earth, because nothing can with-hold it when it hath time and leasure to escape. It is therefore caught and stayed by a sudden contraction, no other wise then if a man should goe about to mixe ayre with water, which can be done by no meanes, but by a speedy and rapid agitation, as may bee seene in froth, wherein the ayre is rapted by the water. Neither is it inelegantly added that Proserpina was rapte as shee was gathering Narcissus Flowers in the valleyes, because Narcissus hath his name from slownesse or stupiditie: for indeed then is this Spirit most prepared and fitted to be snatcht by terrestiall matter, when it beginnes to be coagulated, and becomes as it were slowe. Rightly is Proserpina honoured more then any of the other Gods bed-fellowes, in beeing styled the Lady of Dis , because this spirit doth rule and swaye all things in those lower Regions, Pluto abiding stupid and ignorant. This Spirit the power celestiall (shadowed by Ceres ) striues with infinite sedulity to recouer and get againe: for that brand or burning torch of Aether (which Ceres caried in her hand) doth doubtles signifie the Sunne, which enlightneth the whole circuit of the Earth, and would bee of greatest moment to recouer Proserpina , if possibly it might be. But Proserpina abides still, the reason of which is accuratly and excellently propounded in the condidions betweene Iupiter and Ceres : For first it is most certaine there are two waies to keepe Spirit in solid and terrestriall Matter; the one by constipation or obstruction, which is meere imprisonment and constraint; the other by administration of proportionable nutriment, which it receiues willingly and of its owne accord: for after that the included Spirit beginnes to feed and nourish it selfe, it makes no haste to be gone, but is, as it were, linckt to its Earth: And this is pointed at by Proserpina her eating of a Pome granat; which if shee had not done, shee had long since beene recouered by Ceres with her torch, compassing the Earth. Now as concerning that Spirit which is in Mettals and minerals, it is chiefly perchance restrained by the solidity of Masse: but that which is in Plants and Animals, inhabites a porous body, and hath open passage to bee gone in a manner as it lists, were it not that it willingly abides of its owne accord, by reason of the relish it finds in its entertainment. The second condition concerning the six moneths custome, it is no other then an elegant description of the diuision of the yeere, seeing this Spirit mixt with the Earth appeares aboue ground in vegetable bodies during the summer months, and in the winter sinkes downe againe. Now as concerning Theseus , and Perithous their attempt to bring Proserpina quite away; the meaning of it is, that it oftentimes comes to passe, that some more subtill spirits desc eding with diuers bodies to the Earth, nouer come to sucke of any subalternall Spirit, whereby to vnite it vnto them, and so to bring it away. But on the contrary are coagulated themselues and neuer rise more, that Proserpina should bee by that meanes augmented with inhabitants and dominion. All that wee can say concerning that sprig of gold is hardly able to defend vs from the violence of the Chymicks , if in this regarde they set vpon vs, seeing they promise by that their Elixar to effect golden mountaines, and the restoring of naturall bodies, as it were, from the portall of Hell. But concerning Chymistry, and those perpetuall sutors for that philosophicall Elixar , wee know certainly that their Theory is without grounds,  & we suspect that their practise also is without certaine reward. And therefore (omitting these) of this last part of the parable this is my opinion. I am induced to beleeue by many figures of the Ancients, that the conseruation and restauration of naturall bodies in some sorte was not esteemed by them as a thing impossible to bee attained, but as a thing obstruse and full of difficulties, and so they seeme to intimate in this place, when they report that this one onely sprigge was founde among infinite other trees in a huge and thicke wood, which they fained to bee of gold, because gold is the badge of perpetuity, and to be artificially as it were inserted, because this effect is to bee rather hoped for from Arte, then from any Medicine, or simple, or naturall meanes. 30\. Metis , or Counsell. The ancient Poets report that Iupiter tooke Metis to wise, whose name doth plainely signifie Counsell, and that shee by him concelued. Which when he found, not tarying the time of her deliuerance, deuoures both her, and that which shee went withall, by which meanes Iupiter himselfe became with child, and was deliuered of a wondrous birth; for out of his head or braine came forth Pallas armed. The sense of this Fable (which at first apprehension may seeme monstrous and absurd) containes in it a secret of state, to wit, with what pollicy Kings are wont to cary themselues towards their Counsellours, whereby they may not onely preserue their authoritie and Maiestie free and entire, but also that it may be the more extolled and dignified of the people: For Kings beeing as it were tyed and coupled in a Nuptiall bond to their Counsellours, doe truly conceiue that communicating with them about the affaires of greatest importance, doe yet detract nothing from their own Maiestie. But when any matter comes to bee censured or decreed (which is as a birth) there doe they confine and restraine the libertie of their Counsellours; lest that which is done should seeme to bee hatched by their wisedome and iudgement. So as at last Kings (except it be in such matters as are distastfull and maligned, which they alwaies will be sure to put off from themselues) doe assume the honour and praise of all matters that are ruminated in Counsell, and as it were, formed in the wombe, whereby the resolution and execution (which because it proceeds from power, and implyes a necessity, is elegantly shadowed vnder the figure of Pallas armed) shall seeme to proceede wholly from themselues. Neither sufficeth it that it is done by the authority of the king by his meer will and free applause, except withall, this be added and appropriated as to issue out of his owne head or braine, intimating, that out of his owne iudgement, wisedome and ordinance it was onely inuented and deriued. 31\. The Sirenes , or Pleasures. The Fable of the Sirenes seemes rightly to haue bene applied to the pernicious allurements of pleasure, but in a very vulgar and grosse manner. And therefore to mee it appeares, that the Wisedome of the Ancients haue with a further reach or insight straind deeper matter out of them, not vnlike to Grapes ill prest, from which though some liquor were drawen, yet the best was left behind. These Sirenes are said to be the daughters of Achelous , and Terpsichores one of the Muses. Who in their first beeing, were winged, but after rashly entring into contention with the Muses were by them vanquished, and depriued of their wings. Of whose pluckt out Feathers the Muses made themselues Coronets. So as euer since that time all the Muses haue attired them selues with plumed heads, except Terpsicheres onely that was mother to the Sirenes . The habitation of the Sirenes was in certaine pleasant Ilands, from whence as soone as out of their watch-tower they discouered any ships approching, with their sweet tunes they would first entice and stay them, and hauing them in their power would destroy them. Neither was their song plaine and single, but consisting of such variety of melodious tunes, so fitting and delighting the eares that heard them, as that it rauished and betrayed all passengers. And so great was the mischiefe they did, that these Iles of the Sirenes , euen as farre off as a man could ken them, appeared all ouer white with the bones of vnburied Carcases. For the remedying of this miserie, a double meanes was at last found out, the one by Vlisses , the other by Orpheus. Vlisses (to make experiment of his deuice) caused all the cares of his companie to bee stopt with waxe, and made himselfe to be bound to the maine Mast, with speciall commandement to his Mariners not to bee loosed, albeit himselfe should require them so to doe. But Orpheus neglecting and disdaining to be so bound, with a shrill and sweet voice singing the praises of the Gods to his Harpe, supprest the songs of the Sirenes , and so freed himselfe from their danger. This Fable hath relation to mens manners, and containes in it a manifest and most excellent Parable: For pleasures doe for the most part proceed out of the abundance and superfluitie of all things, and also out of the delights and Iouiall contentments of the minde; the which are wont suddenly, as it were, with winged entisements to rauish and rapt mortall men. But learning and education brings it so to passe, as that it restraines and bridles mans mind, making it so to consider the ends and euents of things, as that it clippes the wings of pleasure. And this was greatly to the honour and renowne of the Muses: for after that by some examples it was made manifest that by the power of philosophy vaine pleasures might growe contemptible; it presently grew to great esteeme, as a thing that could raise and eleuate the mind aloft that seemed to be base and fixed to the earth; and make the cogitations of men (which doe euer recide in the head) to be  aethereall, and as it were winged. But that the Mother of the Sirenes was left to her feet and without wings; that no doubt is no otherwise meant, then of light and superficiall learning, appropriated and defined onely to pleasures, as were those which Petronius deuoted himselfe vnto, after he had receiued his fatall sentence, and hauing his foot, as it were, vpon the threshold of death sought to giue himselfe all delightfull contentments, in so much as when he had caused consolatory letters to be sent him, hee would peruse none of them (as Tacitus reports) that should giue him courage and constancie, but onely reade fantasticall verses, such as these are. Viuamus, me a Lesbia, atque amemus, Rumoresque Senium Seueriorum, Omnes vnius astimemus Asfis. My Lesbia, let vs liue and loue; Though wayward Dottards vs reproue, Weigh their words light for our behoue. And this also; Iura Senes n orint, & quid sit fasque nefasque Inquirant tristes, legumque examina seruent. Let doting Grandsires know the lawe, And right and wrong obserue with awe: Let them in that stricte circle drawe. This kind of doctrine wold easily perswade to take these plumed Coronets from the Muses, & to restore the wings again to the Sirens . These Sirenes are saide to dwell in remote Iles, for that pleasures loue priuacie and retired places, shunning alwaies too much companie of people. The Sirenes songs are so vulgarly vnderstood together with the deceits and danger of them, as that they need no exposition. But that of the bones appearing like white cliffes, and descryed afarre off, hath more acutenesse in it: For thereby is signified, that albeit the examples of afflictions be manifest and eminent; yet doe they not sufficiently deterre vs from the wicked enticements of pleasures. As for the remainder of this parable, though it be not ouer mysticall, yet is it very graue and excellent: For in it are set out three remedies for this violent enticing mischiefe; to wit, two from Philosophy , and one from Religion. The first meanes to shunne these inordinate pleasures is, to withstand and resist them in their beginnings, and seriously to shunne all occasions that are offered to debaush  & entice the mind, which is signified in that stopping of the Eares; & that remedie is properly vsed by the meaner and baser sorte of people, as it were, Vlisses followers or Marriners; whereas more heroique and noble Spirits, may boldly conuerse euen in the midst of these seducing pleasures, if with a resolued constancie they stand vpon their guard, and fortefie their minds; And so take greater contentment in the triall and experience of this their approued vertue; learning rather throughly to vnderstand the follies and vanities of those pleasures by contemplation, then by submission. Which Salomon auouched of himselfe, when hee reckoning vp the multitude of those solaces and pleasures wherein he swamme, doth conclude with this Sentence; Sapientia quoque perseuer auit mecum. Wisedome also continued with mee. Therefore these Heroes, and Spirits of this excellent temper, euen in the midst of these enticing pleasures, can shew themselues constant
