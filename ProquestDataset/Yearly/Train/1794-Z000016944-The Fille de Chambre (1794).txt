I [s]miled, for I knew my good friend Puffendorf imagined worth and virtue entirely connected with birth, rank and fortune, and that the actions of an ob[s]cure individual, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of neither of the[s]e advantages, could not for a moment be worthy attention. There was [s]omething in my [s]mile that rather offended him, [s]o, without waiting for an an[s]wer, he thus proceeded: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-009.jpg) \- external link  - Page iv. ] "You are the [s]trange[s]t woman upon earth! You pretend to blend in your writings both in[s]truction and amu[s]ement; but, in the name of common [s]en[s]e, what in[s]truction can be drawn from the life of an Abigail? Why, the whole mu[s]t be a [s]eries of intrigue, low wit, and frivolity." "Then, Sir, you mu[s]t [s]uppo[s]e [s]he lives with people in very exalted [s]tations, and I write their memoirs, not her's." "No, Madam, no, I [s]uppo[s]e no [s]uch thing; for then your work might be worth reading. Per[s]ons of high birth are as different from their inferiors, in their [s]entiments and manners, as you can possibly imagine." "I grant it, Sir, yet I hope you will allow, that the inferior in fortune is often the [s]uperior in every other qualification." "Madam! Madam!" cried he, [s]triking the table in a pa[s][s]ion, "you are enough to drive a man mad." "Do not mi[s]take me," I replied, mildly; "I do not mean to in[s]inuate, that virtue, [s]en[s]e, or honour, are confined to any [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page v. ] particular [s]tation in life. I am fully sensible, that there are many exalted characters in this happy nation, who[s]e amiable conduct, more than their elevated rank, render them objects of univer[s]al adoration: but, at the [s]ame time, you mu[s]t give me leave to add, that the number is but very few, when compared to the arrogant, the trifling, and the profligate, who form [s]o large a part of our people of fashion Virtue will appear amiable, tho' habited in the garb of poverty: and a woman may be an intere[s]ting character, tho' placed in the humble[s]t walks of life, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ing no other recommendations than a feeling heart, and a [s]trong [s]en[s]e of her duties, both moral and religious. Such a character is my FILLE DE CHAMBRE, the true child of nature; and as [s]uch you mu[s]t not expect to read of wonderful discoveries, of titles, rank and wealth, being unexpectedly heaped upon her. The only claim [s]he will have upon your attention, [s]hall be her integrity and innocence." "It will never do," [s]aid he, "take my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page vi. ] word for it; you will never get five shillings for your manu[s]cript." "I [s]hall try it, however," [s]aid I, as he went [s]narling down [s]tairs; "nor [s]hall [s]plendor ever with me be a veil to cover guilt; vice and folly are fair game whereever they appear, and cannot be too much held up to ridicule and abhorrence; nor [s]hall meek-eyed virtue be [s]uffered to [s]ink to oblivion; wherever [s]he dwells [s]he [s]hall be greeted with [s]miles of approbation, while the veil of humility [s]hall be withdrawn from her heavenly countenance, that all may behold her tran[s]cendent beauties, and, with a degree of glorious enthusiasm, follow her faithful votaries."

"I hope there will, my child," [s]aid Mr. Littleton; "and if there is not we mu[s]t be content, for his Majesty, God ble[s]s him, cannot provide for all. I wi[s]h, my girl, it was in my power to convince him, that I am [s]till willing to fight for him, though the bread I eat from his bounty is but brown: but with this poor [s]tump," looking at all that remained of his right arm, "and this di[s]abled leg," [s]tretching it out as well as he could, "all my fighting days are over; I can only talk now, my child." "But you have fought bravely once," [s]aid Mrs. Littleton, while a beam of exultation darted from her eyes. "And after all," cried Rebecca, "it is hard to be di[s]tre[s][s]ed for fifteen pounds." It was a clear fro[s]ty evening, in the beginning of January, when, in a little cottage, on the [s]ea coa[s]t of Lincoln[s]hire, Mr. Littleton, an old [s]uperannuated lieutenant in the army, his wife, daughter, and two or three neighbours, were comfortably [s]eated round a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] cheerful fire, the brown jug was ju[s]t repleni[s]hed by the fair hands of Rebecca, and the [s]ong, the joke, and the tale went cheerfully round, when an unwelcome though not unexpected, vi[s]itor made his appearance, and threw a damp over their harmle[s]s mirth. This was no other than their landlord's [s]teward, who came to demand the rent, in paying which they had been, from various di[s]agreeable rea[s]ons, more backward than u[s]ual; it amounted to fifteen pounds, and the poor old man had no method whatever to rai[s]e the money. He had often made his di[s]tre[s][s]es known to people in power, who had once [s]tyled them[s]elves his friends, but never received any thing more than promises that [s]omething [s]hould be done; but hope had [s]o often deceived him, that he now cea[s]ed to li[s]ten to her flattering voice, and was [s]inking into de[s]pondency, when the lovely Rebecca cheered him with the [s]entence at the beginning of the chapter. Rebecca was the younge[s]t of [s]even children, and the only one who lived to years of maturity. She was at this time ju[s]t [s]ixteen, and had combined in her person all the beauty of a Venus, and the [s]implicity of a Grace. She po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a [s]triking figure, ju[s]t tall enough to be elegant. Her [s]hape was perfect [s]ymmetry, and her countenance one of tho[s]e which may [s]afely be pronounced more than beautiful; for, to the [s]ofte[s]t blue eyes, flaxen hair, and a complexion that out vied the lilies, was added [s]uch an inexpre[s][s]ible look of benevolence and candour, that it was impo[s][s]ible to [s]ee and not love her. She had been taught by her father to read and write her own language correctly, by her mother [s]ome little knowledge of the French, and by the vicar's lady, who was extremely fond of her, [s]he had learned to play, with a con[s]iderable degree of ta[s]te, on the lute; but being educated intirely in the family way, and never having pa[s]t the boundaries of her native village, except once or twice to a neighbouring fair, there was about her [s]uch an air of mode[s]t timidity, that, by the unob[s]erving, might be mi[s]taken for ru[s]tic bashfulness. Though con[s]idered by her young companions as the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] belle of the village, in her own opinion [s]he was ever the meane[s]t, the lea[s]t worthy notice of any. Brought up in the [s]tricte[s]t notions of the prote[s]tant religion, [s]uch univer[s]al charity pervaded her [s]oul, that [s]he never suspected the worth and integrity of her fellow creatures; but implicitly believed, that every one, who pro[s]e[s][s]ed to love or e[s]teem her, [s]poke the genuine feelings of their hearts. She harboured no ideas which fear or [s]hame prevented her revealing, for this rea[s]on, her actions, her sentiments, were often open to the malevolent misconstructions of tho[s]e, who, having art [s]ufficient to conceal the real impul[s]e of their natures, a[s][s]ume the [s]emblance of tho[s]e virtues, the reality of which is po[s][s]e[s][s]ed only by the genuine children of [s]implicity. In giving the character of Mr. Littleton, we require but few words; he was hone[s]t, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of valour, good [s]en[s]e, and a liberal education. Mrs. Littleton was twenty years younger than her hu[s]band, and was, when he married her, remarkably beautiful. She was the daughter of an exci[s]eman, and at a country boarding [s]chool had picked up a few [s]howy accompli[s]hments, but her mind had been totally neglected; her [s]entiments were therefore narrow and illiberal, and [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed that kind of worldly knowledge, which rendered her [s]u[s]picious of the integrity of every human being. The little knowledge Rebecca po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of mankind, [s]he had gleaned from a [s]mall, but not ill-furni[s]hed, circulating library, to which all the inhabitants of the village [s]ub[s]cribed. Her mind was highly tinctured with the romantic, but withal was enlightened with [s]uch a high [s]en[s]e of honour, virtue and piety, that it was almo[s]t impo[s][s]ible to lead her to a wrong action; yet there were times when the fortitude of Rebecca was vulnerable. She could [s]tand unmoved in a right cau[s]e again[s]t entreaty, per[s]ua[s]ion, and even the severest threats; but [s]he was not proof again[s]t the [s]ahft of ridicule. We have [s]aid that Mrs. Littleton had been hand[s]ome indeed, [s]he was [s]o [s]till, being at this period but forty [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] [s]even years old; for piercing black eyes, che[s]nut hair, and a florid complexion, gave her greatly the look of youth. This juvenile appearance of her mother was a great misfortune to Rebecca, for Mrs. Littleton was ever more plea[s]ed with being told [s]he looked like her elde[s]t [s]i[s]ter, than in being complimented with being the mother of [s]o lovely a young woman; indeed, [s]he con[s]idered every compliment paid to her daughter as derogating [s]omething from her own merit. She considered her more as a rival than a child, and was happy in every opportunity to ridicule the feelings of a heart, of who[s]e intri[s]ic worth [s]he had no idea. Rebecca could not [s]ometimes help feeling the unkindness of her mother; but whatever tho[s]e feelings were, [s]he [s]uffered in [s]ilence; no complaint ever e[s]caped her lips, but [s]he endeavoured, by the milde[s]t acquiescence in her every wi[s]h, to conciliate that affection which [s]he would have con[s]idered as her greate[s]t comfort. "It is hard, indeed, to be [s]o di[s]tre[s][s]ed for fifteen pounds," [s]aid Rebecca: "I wi[s]h I could hit on any plan by which my dear father might be relieved from this embarra[s][s]ment. I have a great mind, if you will give me leave, to go to-morrow morning to Lady Mary Worthy; I [s]aw her la[s]t week at the vicar's when [s]he a[s]ked me to come and [s]ee her, and [s]aid [s]he [s]hould be happy to render me any [s]ervice in her power." "And do you think [s]he really meant what [s]he [s]aid?" cried Mrs. Littleton. "To be [s]ure I do," replied Rebecca. "Then you are a fool, retorted the mother, "not to take it, as it was de[s]igned, a mere compliment, which [s]he paid in re[s]pect to Mrs. Alton, who, [s]he [s]aw, was rather partial to you." "Dear mamma" [s]aid Rebecca, in an accent of surprise, "how can you think [s]o? There was no nece[s][s]ity for her to a[s]k me, if [s]he had not wi[s]hed me to come, for, you know, I am greatly her inferior." "Don't talk [s]o [s]illy, child! do you [s]uppo[s]e I wi[s]h every body to come to my hou[s]e whom politene[s]s obliges me to a[s]k?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] "I can only [s]ay, mamma, that I would never a[s]k any per[s]on whom I [s]hould not be really glad to [s]ee when they came." "I think, my dear," [s]aid Mr. Littleton (though I have the greate[s]t re[s]pect imaginable for your opinion) "that it would not be ami[s]s for Rebecca to go to Lady Mary; when [s]he knows our [s]ituation [s]he may be prevailed with to reque[s]t her [s]on, Sir George, to wait till we can make up the [s]um: I will, in the mean time, write to my old friend, Lord Antrim, perhaps, he may get my [s]mall pen[s]ion enlarged, Mrs. Littleton remained [s]ilent, and it was agreed between Rebecca and her father, that the next morning [s]he [s]hould vi[s]it Audley Park. THE APPLICATION. At twelve o'clock, next morning, the lovely Rebecca, habited in a plain white jacket, a strawhat, and black tere[s]a, [s]at out for Audley Park. Lady Mary was alone in the library when [s]he arrived, and, on the [s]ervant's announcing her name, desired her to be immediately [s]hown up. "Now this is really kind," [s]aid [s]he, with the mo[s]t conde[s]cending [s]mile, advancing to the blu[s]hing Rebecca, and, taking her hand, led her to the [s]ofa on which [s]he had been [s]itting, and [s]eating her[s]elf by her [s]ide: "I flatter my[s]elf you are come to [s]pend the day with me." "Indeed, madam," replied Rebecca, "I was not [s]o pre[s]uming as to hope [s]uch an honour: I came to request--- to entreat"--- [s]he faltered---the tears [s]tarted in her eyes---Lady Mary interrupted her. "Speak out, my love; do not be alarmed, but re[s]t a[s][s]ured, I am ready to grant you any favour within the limits of my power." "You are very good, madam. I hope you will pardon the liberty I have taken; but my father, madam [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] \---his income is very [s]mall---we are a twelve-month in arrears in our rent---if you will kindly u[s]e your intere[s]t with Sir George in our behalf.--- "Surely, my dear, your agitation is unnece[s][s]ary. I dare [s]ay my [s]on has never thought of the rent." "No, madam, I do not [s]uppo[s]e he has, it is [s]o trifling; but Mr. Villars, his [s]teward, a[s]ked for it la[s]t night, and was very angry!" "Indeed! [s]aid her lady[s]hip; was he angry?" "I do not mean to complain of Mr. Villars, madam, for he has been very good to us, and often has waited a month or two for his money. You know, madam, he is only doing his duty when he demands it; for was he to be remi[s]s in collecting the rents, Sir George would certainly be offended with him." Lady Mary [s]miled at the eager manner in which Rebecca uttered this apology for Villars; but it was a [s]mile of the utmo[s]t [s]atisfaction, it convinced her of the goodne[s]s of her young vi[s]itor's heart. "I think," [s]aid [s]he, "if [s]ome friend could be found who would advance this [s]um for your father." "Alas! madam, how is it to be repaid, unle[s]s, indeed,"--- he[s]itating, blu[s]hing, and ri[s]ing from her [s]eat. "Unle[s]s what, my [s]weet girl?" "Your lady[s]hip would generou[s]ly lend me the money, and take me into your [s]ervice, that I might render my[s]elf u[s]eful till it is repaid; or, if you think me too pre[s]uming, madam, perhaps, you could recommend me to [s]ome family where there are children. I am not, it is true, accu[s]tomed to [s]ervitude, but I will exert my poor abilities cheerfully, and hope my willingne[s]s to oblige will, in [s]ome mea[s]ure compen[s]ate for my awkwardness." "You are too good, and too lovely," [s]aid Lady Mary, "for a [s]ervant; but you [s]hall, if you plea[s]e, come and live with me. I will [s]ettle this little difficulty of your father's and [s]hall think my[s]elf obliged if you will accept a trifle annually for your pocket expences. She then drew forth her pur[s]e, and pre[s]ented the delighted maid with a twenty pound bank note." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] Greatful beyond the power of expre[s][s]ion, Rebecca could only [s]ink on her knees, pre[s]s the hand of her benefactre[s]s to her lips, and, [s]miling through the tears that gu[s]hed from her eyes, looked tho[s]e thanks [s]he found it impo[s][s]ible to utter. "Go, go, you are a [s]imple girl I [s]ee," cried her lady[s]hip, rai[s]ing and pu[s]hing her gently from her. "Go, make your father happy, and, if you can obtain his a[s][s]ent to my propo[s]al, to-morrow I will come and fetch you home; but I mu[s]t have you mend that little heart of your's, it is but a very poor one to go through the world with." "It means well," replied Rebecca, trembling and confu[s]ed, rai[s]ing her timid eyes to the face of her benefactress. "Aye, aye, I am [s]ure of that, but it is too hone[s]t by half; be[s]ides, your intelligent countenance betrays its every emotion." "I hope, madam, it will never experience any, but may be revealed with impunity." "Ah! my dear," [s]aid Lady Mary, [s]haking her head, "you will, no doubt, one day find that it will be to your intere[s]t to di[s]gui[s]e its feelings as much as po[s][s]ible." Rebecca, then took her leave, and as [s]he returned home, could not help thinking that it was very [s]trange, and very incon[s]i[s]tent too, that [s]incerity [s]hould be deemed a virtue, and yet di[s]gui[s]e be thought nece[s][s]ary to tho[s]e who have much commerce with the world. SUSPICION. " Well , Mi[s]s, what [s]ucce[s]s?" cried Mrs. Littleton, as Rebecca entered the room: "I hope you are convinced I was right, in [s]uppo[s]ing your vanity incited you to hope without foundation." "Indeed, my dear mamma, for once you were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] mistaken: Lady Mary has received me kindly, and more than granted my reque[s]t." She then, with the mo[s]t bewitching [s]implicity, related her interview at the Park, while Mr. Littleton looked exultingly happy; but good mamma contracted her brow, and, drawing her[s]elf up, as was her cu[s]tom when any thing di[s]plea[s]ed her, [s]aid: "I hope, Mr. Littleton, you will not think of letting the girl go: Lady Mary certainly does not mean to take her entirely, and it will only be filling her head with idle notions, of which, heaven knows, [s]he has plenty already. Be[s]ides, what do we know of Lady Mary? It is true, [s]he came down here la[s]t year, and remained about three months; but who can tell any thing of her character and morals? She may lead the girl into all manner of folly." Now the ca[s]e was exactly this: the late Sir George Worthy had purcha[s]ed this e[s]tate but a few months before his death, and as Lady Mary was a woman of a very retired turn, the [s]hort time [s]he remained in the country [s]he vi[s]ited but few families, and tho[s]e without ceremony. Lady Mary was truly benevolent, but [s]he performed tho[s]e acts her[s]elf, and not unfrequently made the [s]ilence and [s]ecrecy of the per[s]ons benefitted, the only terms on which they were to hope a continuance of her favours. She in general re[s]ided at a [s]eat about twenty miles from London, to the end that [s]he might [s]trictly scrutinize the conduct of a daughter who was married to a young di[s][s]ipated nobleman, and who, though ble[s][s]ed with a mother, who[s]e example might have led her on to every laudable pur[s]uit, was [s]o entirely [s]wallowed up in the vortex of folly and di[s][s]ipation, that [s]he had not time to attend to the e[s][s]ential duties of a wife, mother, and mi[s]tre[s]s of a family. In the place where Lady Mary u[s]ually re[s]ided, [s]he was con[s]idered as a proud, un[s]ocial woman, by the midling kind of gentry; by her equals as an oddity, and by her dependants as [s]omething [s]uperiorly good, and was by them beloved, re[s]pected, nay, almo[s]t adored as an angel of benevolence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] But Mrs. Littleton [s]eldom gave people credit for virtues which [s]he had not the penetration to di[s]cover, though [s]he could ea[s]ily imagine them capable of practising deceit, inhumanity, or almo[s]t any vice that can di[s]grace human nature: [s]he therefore thus continued her di[s]cour[s]e to her hu[s]band. "People are not always what they [s]eem to be; this lady may make very fair promi[s]es, and when once the girl is in her power, treat her as a common [s]ervant. I beg Mr. Littleton, you will not let her go." "I am [s]orry my dear love," cried Mr. Littleton, "to differ from you in my opinion concerning Lady Mary's offer; I think our dear girl will be highly honoured in her friend[s]hip and protection. You know my dear if [s]he [s]hould find her[s]elf unhappy, [s]he has a home, however homely, where [s]he will be [s]ure of being received with tran[s]port. I am growing old; when I am gone all is gone; it would be [s]ome comfort to me to reflect in my la[s]t moments, that my dear Rebecca was not likely to feel the pangs of want. The [s]mall annuity I have purcha[s]ed for you will [s]upply the necessaries of life to one, but not to both of you. I am as unwilling as you can be to part with her; but it is necessary [s]he [s]hould be in [s]ome way of earning a [s]upport, and, I tru[s]t, [s]he has [s]en[s]e and fortitude [s]ufficient to with[s]tand every temptation to evil." "Oh! my father," cried Rebecca, taking his hand, "you may, indeed, depend on a child who[s]e heart your precepts have trained in the love of virtue. Methinks, [s]hould I ever be tempted to [s]tray in the paths of vice, your ble[s]t image will ri[s]e to my imagination; methinks I [s]hall hear your per[s]ua[s]ive voice [s]ay "Rebecca, wilt thou break thy father's heart?" Will it be po[s][s]ible, then, for me to proceed? Oh! no; the remembrance of you, like a tali[s]man, will [s]hield me from every danger." "Why, how the girl talks!" [s]aid Mrs. Littleton: "I declare [s]he learns the[s]e things out of the books [s]he is for ever reading; for 'tis not the language of the world; there is nobody hardly can under[s]tand her". "It is the language of the heart," replied the father. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] "Well, Sir, you are to act as you plea[s]e; but if any ill come of it, don't blame me; don't [s]ay I drove her from home." "My dear, you talk of things which never could enter my mind. I know you will always be happy to have your child with you, [s]trange if you were not, [s]o amiable as [s]he is! But as I [s]aid ju[s]t now, I am growing old, I cannot remain much longer with you, and, perhaps you may marry again." "Marry again! Mr. Littleton, you [s]urely are trying to vex me. Ah! my deare[s]t life, when I loo[s]e you I [s]hall loo[s]e all my happine[s]s; the re[s]t of my life will be a continued [s]cene of mourning; there is a degree of indelicacy in a woman marrying a [s]econd time: it is an in[s]ult to the memory of the fir[s]t hu[s]band, of which I could not have believed you thought me capable. It has hurt me more than I can expre[s]s," and [s]he bur[s]t into tears. "All this now is non[s]en[s]e," [s]aid the old man, taking hold of her hand; "for my part I [s]ee nothing in a woman's having two hu[s]bands; it is naturally to be expected when [s]he is left a lovely widow, in the prime of life, as you are now." "No indeed papa," [s]aid Rebecca, innocently, "there is nothing in it at all; it is as common as can be." "Hold your tongue, Mi[s]s; do not talk [s]o unfeelingly of the lo[s]s of your poor dear father." "God [s]end," cried Rebecca, fervently cla[s]ping her hands "that for this many, many years, I may not experience [s]o heavy an affliction as the lo[s]s of my revered parent: it would be a heavy [s]troke to us both, my dear mamma, but to me irreparable; for, though you might find another hu[s]band, where [s]hould poor Rebecca find another father?" She turned away, covered her face with her hand, and [s]obbed aloud. After much more altercation it was at length agreed, that Rebecca [s]hould accept Lady Mary's offer, and that Mr. Littleton [s]hould him[s]elf go to the Park that afternoon to thank her for her bounty, and to reque[s]t her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] kinde[s]t attention to the welfare and peace of his darling Rebecca. Lady Mary received him with great politene[s]s, and, after chatting [s]ome time with him, and a[s][s]uring him of her protection to his daughter, [s]he thus addre[s][s]ed him: "I feel my[s]elf much intere[s]ted in the happine[s]s of Rebecca, and for that rea[s]on, though I mean to make her my companion, I [s]hall not introduce her into company, or give her a ta[s]te for expen[s]ive plea[s]ures. When I have vi[s]itors, her meals will be [s]erved in her own apartment; when I am alone, which is the greate[s]t part of my time, [s]he will eat and [s]it with me, reading, working, or amu[s]ing her[s]elf as inclination [s]hall prompt. "I will confe[s]s I have an intere[s]ted motive for this conduct. I have a [s]on, Mr. Littleton, the la[s]t remaining branch of two noble families. I am [s]en[s]ible his heart is not invulnerable, and I am fully convinced that your daughter is the mo[s]t lovely woman I ever beheld; but all charming as [s]he is (pardon me, Sir, it is my duty in this point to be [s]incere) I [s]hould not choo[s]e to [s]ee her the wife of my [s]on, and I have too high a regard for her to expo[s]e her to trials to which her fortitude may be unequal. I do not [s]cruple to [s]ay it would hurt my pride to [s]ee her his wife; but it would wound my [s]en[s]ibility to [s]ee her his mi[s]tre[s]s. My hou[s]e at Twickenham is large; one part of it is [s]eldom visited by any body but my[s]elf; here I mean to order her an apartment, and whenever I expect Sir George I [s]hall reque[s]t her to keep within it: however, as he is a very gay young man, I do not [s]ee him very often, and when he does come he does not [s]tay with me above two or three hours; therefore, Mr. Littleton let Rebecca know this, if [s]he can bear [s]olitude [s]ometimes, and in general retirement, I [s]hall e[s]teem my[s]elf happy to have her with me. If [s]he di[s]likes the plan, do not fear to inform me. I remember I was once young myself, and [s]hall not be at all offended if I find youth and beauty unable to [s]ubmit implicitly to the caprices of age. One thing more I mu[s]t mention: I [s]hall constantly vi[s]it Audley Park once a year; Rebecca [s]hall always accompany me, and as we [s]hall be out of all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] danger at tho[s]e times, every amu[s]ement that I can procure [s]he may depend upon enjoying." Mr. Littleton was a man of [s]en[s]e: he was plea[s]ed with Lady Mary's frankne[s]s, and readily conceived, that the propo[s]ed retired [s]ituation of his child would be the only thing to [s]hield her from tho[s]e [s]nares and temptations to which a young woman is [s]ubject, who, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of beauty, wit, and [s]en[s]ibility, has neither rank or fortune to recommend her to the [s]erious attention of tho[s]e who might pretend to admire while, they lead the un[s]u[s]pecting innocent a victim to vice and seduction! He returned home, and maugre the ill-grounded [s]u[s]picions of his wife, the next day but one was fixed on for the lovely Rebecca to attend her patrone[s]s, and enter on an entire new cour[s]e of life. NOUVELLE SCENES. Lady Mary was not an early ri[s]er; Rebecca had been accu[s]tomed from earlie[s]t infancy to leave her bed at fix o'clock; [s]he had therefore aro[s]e at her u[s]ual hour, and finding her[s]elf likely to be alone till ten o'clock, went into the library, and [s]elected from among the many books there, Sir Charles Grandison for her morning amu[s]ement; the intere[s]ting pen of Richard[s]on had [s]o entirely charmed her attention, that [s]he thought not of time till Lady Mary made her appearance. "You have been reading, my love," [s]aid [s]he; "are you fond of Novels?" "I like the[s]e entertaining Hi[s]tories, madam; they always command my attention, and awaken my sensibility." "It is dangerous, Rebecca, to indulge that sensibility too much; be[s]ides, my dear, you mu[s]t not give [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] way to an exce[s]s of feeling, when the tale you read is only a fiction." "A fiction! madam; you [s]urpri[s]e me. I thought they had been the Hi[s]tories of per[s]ons who had really exi[s]ted." "Far from it, child; human nature can never ari[s]e to [s]uch a pitch of excellence as this Sir Charles Grandison is repre[s]ented to be; nor will you among your own [s]ex, be able to find a woman like Mi[s]s Byron: be[s]ides, if you accu[s]tom your[s]elf to think the[s]e high wrote [s]cenes real, you will find the actual occurrences of human life [s]o flat and in[s]ipid, that the very disappointment will render you di[s]gu[s]ted with the world." Rebecca li[s]tened with attention, but [s]till in her heart [s]he thought, [s]urely, the[s]e amiable characters, the[s]e intere[s]ting [s]cenes, are not all fiction. I [s]hall certainly at [s]ome future period, meet with men and women as amiable as the[s]e are repre[s]ented. She nourished this idea in [s]ilence, and dwelt on the delightful vision, till at la[s]t too fatally convinced, that to be perfect was not compatible with mortality. She wept over the errors of her fellow creatures, and lamented that rea[s]onable beings placed in a world abounding with every comfort, [s]hould ungratefully da[s]h the cup of felicity from their lips, and eagerly drink of that which was [s]trongly tinctured with gall. It is ea[s]ily in our own power to be happy, [s]aid [s]he; but to render ourselves really mi[s]erable, requires much art, contrivance and [s]olicitude; for, before we can be completely unhappy, we mu[s]t for[s]ake the commandments of our all-wife Creator; we mu[s]t di[s]tru[s]t his merciful Providence, and render our[s]elves totally unworthy his heavenly protection. But I am [s]peaking of her maturer reflexions, and forgetting that [s]he is but ju[s]t entered on the grand theatre of life.---And to return: The time was now nearly elap[s]ed which Lady Mary u[s]ually [s]pent in Lincoln[s]hire, which was two months before and one after Chri[s]tmas, at which period [s]he enlivened the hearts of all Sir George's tenants, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] made the [s]mile of tranquillity [s]it on the countenances of age, and [s]oftened the couch of pain and [s]ickne[s]s. And is not this the real incen[s]e to be offered at [s]o glorious a [s]ea[s]on? Will it not go up as a [s]weet smellling [s]acrifice before the Mo[s]t High? Oh! [s]urely it is the benevolent heart will ever be acceptable to him who[s]e heavenly benevolence led him to [s]uffer an ignominious death, that we might live for ever in glory unfading, in bli[s]s unchangeable. It was with infinite pain that Rebecca parted from her father; nor did he experience le[s]s angui[s]h. "God pre[s]erve you my child," [s]aid he embracing her, "remember the happine[s]s of your poor father depends on your well doing." "Good bye, Rebecca," [s]aid the mother; "God ble[s]s you, child, be careful, circum[s]pect, and wary; [s]u[s]pect every one of a de[s]ign on you till you are convinced of the contrary. You mu[s]t think all men knaves, and all women treacherous, and then you will avoid many troubles. Tru[s]t no one; keep your thoughts to your[s]elf if you are unhappy, bear your [s]orrows in [s]ilence, for no one will pity you if you tell them; the happy will only laugh at you, and the mi[s]erable have enough to do to feel for their own afflictions. If you are happy, be [s]ilent al[s]o; for if you boa[s]t of your felicity, [s]ome will ridicule the [s]ource from whence it follows, and others will, from envy, endeavour to interrupt that happine[s]s they cannot them[s]elves enjoy. Keep your thoughts to your[s]elf; have few acquaintances, fewer intimates, and no bo[s]om friends. Friendship is a pretty word, but there is no [s]uch thing as a true friend exi[s]ting in the world. Remember what I [s]ay; the world is full of deceit, and [s]ilence and suspicion are the only things to [s]ecure you from its effects." "But [s]u[s]picion is incompatible with Chri[s]tianity," [s]aid Rebecca; "we are taught to `judge not that we be not judged." Mrs. Littleton looked at her daughter with an air of [s]urpri[s]e, but remained [s]ilent. Lady Mary pre[s][s]ed her hand, and led her to the chai[s]e. Rebecca bowed to her parents, and before [s]he was from di[s]tance deprived [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] of the plea[s]ure of beholding them, the tears had effectually ob[s]cured them from her view. Their journey was plea[s]ant, and the novelty of the objects [s]he encountered, in a [s]hort time diverted her ideas, and before [s]he arrived at Twickenham [s]he was quite tranquil and happy; nay, [s]he was even more cheerful than Lady Mary had ever [s]een her before. It was late when they alighted; but the elegance of the hou[s]e, the extent of the gardens, and the ta[s]te in which they were laid out, was full and plea[s]urable amu[s]ement to Rebecca the next morning. Her own apartment commanded a view of the Thames and its delightful banks; [s]he thought [s]he [s]hould never be weary of [s]tanding at the window. "I will write my father an ample account of this charming place," [s]aid [s]he; but when [s]he had rambled over all the plea[s]ure grounds, alas! thought [s]he, it will be impo[s][s]ible to give him an adequate idea of its beauties. I mu[s]t even reque[s]t him to come next [s]ummer, and judge of it him[s]elf. For eight months, happine[s]s, pure, unallayed happiness, took up her abode in the bo[s]om of Rebecca. She read, [s]he worked, walked, or played on her lute alternately, as inclination led, and during that time [s]he had been confined to her apartment but twice, once when Lady O[s][s]iter vi[s]ited her mother, and once when Sir George was expected to dinner. WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED. Time now flew on the [s]ofte[s]t pinions with Rebecca; every ri[s]ing day brought increa[s]e to her happiness; the tenderne[s]s and affection of Lady Mary hourly increa[s]ed; [s]he had di[s]covered in her gentle companion great ta[s]te for mu[s]ic, and a dawning of genius for drawing. "The[s]e are talents," [s]aid her lady[s]hip, "that ever afford a fund of innocent amu[s]ement to the po[s][s]e[s][s]or, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] and it is certainly my duty, by cultivating them, to compen[s]ate, in [s]ome mea[s]ure, for the cheerful acquiescense Rebecca [s]hows to every de[s]ire of mine, particularly in [s]ubmitting, without repining, to a reclu[s]e life, which mo[s]t young per[s]ons, at her time of life, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of her beauty and vivacity, would think cruel in the extreme." Lady Mary had received an education befitting her rank, and had not neglected the means of improving a very elevated under[s]tanding, and a bright natural genius, by refu[s]ing attention to the ample means of cultivation which fortune held out; on the contrary [s]he made her[s]elf mi[s]tre[s]s of the fine arts, mu[s]ic and painting, and to the mo[s]t delicate and judicious choice of the works of fancy, [s]he added an exten[s]ive knowledge of hi[s]tory and natural philo[s]ophy. To her, therefore, the cultivation of [s]uch a mind as Rebecca's was a [s]ource of the mo[s]t refined plea[s]ure. She [s]aw its beauties daily expand under her attentive care, with the [s]ame delight as the lapidary di[s]covers the cru[s]t that envelopes the rough diamond give way to his labours, and the ine[s]timable jewel a[s][s]uming a degree of brilliancy that promi[s]es well to reward his indu[s]try. But, though the talents of Rebecca were thus ea[s]ily drawn forth, and the ru[s]ticity of her manners began to a[s][s]ume a more poli[s]hed air, it was impo[s][s]ible to alter the [s]implicity and purity of her mind. Whenever her generous patrone[s]s endeavoured to give her [s]ome idea of the manners of the world, [s]he manife[s]ted [s]uch a degree of [s]weet incredibility, when informed of vices of which [s]he had no idea, and was [s]o ready to frame excu[s]es for errors of which [s]he imagined few could be guilty, and none intentionally, that Lady Mary was at length assured that nothing but experience would convince the innocent maid, but that every bo[s]om was as free from guilt and treachery as her own. "My dear Rebecca," [s]aid [s]he to her one day, "I will no longer labour to inform you of the vices and follies of mankind, the total ignorance of which [s]eems to con[s]titute your chief felicity. Long, my [s]weet girl, may you retain that primitive [s]implicity of heart; it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] [s]hall be my care to leave you at my death an independence, to prevent your charming un[s]u[s]pecting nature from buying experience at [s]o dear a rate, as an intercourse with, or a dependence upon, the [s]miles of an unfeeling, misjudging world." Thus Lady Mary determined; but, alas! like too many others, [s]he deferred, adding this codicil to her will from day to day, till a [s]udden accident put it intirely out of her power. The autumn was now advancing, and Rebecca looked forward to the time when [s]he [s]hould revi[s]it her native village. "And how will my dear father be delighted," [s]aid [s]he, "to [s]ee and hear my improvements? To be [s]ure there is no harp[s]ichord in his cottage; but he will [s]urely come to the Park, and then I will [s]urpri[s]e him by playing [s]ome of his favourite airs: my mother too, I will reque[s]t Lady Mary to let me give her that piece of grey lu[s]tring [s]he [s]o kindly brought me from town la[s]t week. I will buy her al[s]o a new cloak and bonnet, [s]he will be the gaye[s]t of all our neighbours next winter;" then taking out her port folio, [s]he [s]elected of her be[s]t drawings, and, in imagination, arranged them round her father's little ru[s]tic parlour. Lady Mary was that morning gone to Wind[s]or on a vi[s]it to an old acquaintance, and Rebecca, having amu[s]ed her[s]elf in her own apartment [s]ome time, in the manner already mentioned, at length took up her lute, and opening a window which looked into a retired part of the garden, and into which darted the mild rays of a September's [s]un. She tuned her in[s]trument, and began [s]inging the following little [s]ong, which [s]he had learned but a few days before; it was of con[s]equence a favourite from its novelty more than from its real beauty. Aurora, lovely, blooming fair! Unbar'd the ea[s]tern [s]kies; While many a [s]oft pelucid tear Ran trickling from her eyes. Onward [s]he came with heart-felt-glee Leading the dancing hours; For tho' [s]he wept, [s]he [s]mil'd to [s]ee Her tears refre[s]h the flow'rs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] Phoebus, who long her charms admir'd, With bright refulgent ray, Came forth, and, as the maid retir'd, He ki[s]s'd her tears away. So youth advances, mild [s]erene, Our childi[s]h [s]orrows cea[s]e; While hopes, gay [s]un-[s]hine, guilds the [s]cene, And all is joy and peace. While Rebecca was [s]inging, [s]he had been [s]o intent on her mu[s]ic, that [s]he had not ob[s]erved any body enter the part of the garden to which her window looked; but on laying down her lute, and turning her eyes that way, [s]he perceived a young gentleman, in a riding dre[s]s, leaning again[s]t a tree, and gazing intently at her. The natural ro[s]es that played on her cheeks were heightened by this di[s]covery. She aro[s]e ha[s]tily, and was going to pull down the window, when the young gentleman advancing, with a look of the mo[s]t earne[s]t supplication: Stay one moment, angelic creature!" [s]aid he, tell me if what I now behold is reality or an il ? Art thou a [s]pirit of light, or the lovelie[s]t human being the earth bears?" "Sir!" replied Rebecca, with a voice and look of [s]urpri[s]e, "did you [s]peak to me?" and [s]he involuntarily [s]u[s]pended the hand that was rai[s]ed to [s]hut the window. "Oh! [s]peak again, thou faire[s]t of thy [s]ex," [s]aid he, "Tell me, art thou, indeed, a mortal?" "To be [s]ure I am," [s]aid Rebecca, [s]miling; "what el[s]e [s]hould I be?" "And do[s]t thou live here?" "Sometimes," replied Rebecca, with more re[s]erve, beginning to perceive the impropriety [s]he was guilty of in talking to a [s]tranger. "And cannot you either de[s]cend into the garden, or [s]uffer me to vi[s]it the apartment that contains [s]o much loveline[s]s?" "I can do neither," [s]aid Rebecca gravely, and [s]he again rai[s]ed her hand to draw down the [s]a[s]h. "Oh! [s]tay an in[s]tant," [s]aid he, "and tell me, all angel as thou art! Did thy heart ever vibrate with the [s]oft emotions of love?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] "Sure, [s]ure, it has! el[s]e I were ungrateful," [s]he replied, innocently.---"I love my parents; I love my lady: yes, heaven is my witne[s]s, how much, how fervently, I love her!" She laid her hand on her heart, and rai[s]ed her eyes, with a look of grateful affection: "Enchanting [s]implicity! but do you love no other?" "Heaven forbid! I love all mankind." "But no one in particular." "No." Her uplifted hand fell from the [s]a[s]h, and her eyes were ca[s]t, fir[s]t on the young gentleman, then on the ground. "Could you love me, [s]weete[s]t?" "Methinks not, for you are rudely inqui[s]itive." "But you will not hate me?" "Hate you, Sir! No; you never did me any harm, and if you had, I know it is my duty to forgive you, and pray for your happine[s]s." "Then you will not think of me with indifference?" "That would be impo[s][s]ible," [s]aid [s]he, in a softened accent as [s]he pulled down the window: but he heard not what [s]he [s]aid, and being no longer able to gaze on her beauties, or li[s]ten to her voice, he retired from the garden in a [s]tate of mind by no means enviable. DEBATE ON MATRIMONY. Sir George Worthy was a young man of violent pa[s][s]ions. At a very early age he had been made his own ma[s]ter, and, like mo[s]t young men of large independent fortune, from unlimited indulgence was led to believe, that the mo[s]t trifling occurrence which thwarted his inclination, was an in[s]upportable affliction; it was therefore a very great mortification to him [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] to be obliged to quit the garden in [s]uch a [s]tate of suspence, e[s]pecially as he did not know who the young lady was: however he re[s]olved to [s]tay at his mother's hou[s]e a few days (a favour which he had never deigned before [s]ince the death of his father) for he imagined this fair vi[s]itant would of cour[s]e make her appearance at dinner, and that after the fir[s]t formal introduction, he [s]hould have the [s]uperlative [s]atisfaction of enjoying her company in an unre[s]erved family way. When Lady Mary arrived, [s]he was much [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee her [s]on in the drawing-room; but as [s]he had not the remote[s]t idea of his having been arrived long, after the fir[s]t [s]alutations were pa[s]t, [s]he went to her own apartment, and di[s]patched Mrs. Harley, her woman, to inform Rebecca, that as [s]he had company, [s]he would order her dinner to be [s]ent up, and [s]hould not expect to [s]ee her in the dining parlour. Harley was not [s]atisfied with [s]imply delivering her me[s][s]age, but al[s]o delivered her own [s]entiments on the [s]ubject. "Heaven keep me from pride," [s]aid [s]he. "One mu[s]t be blind, indeed, not to perceive the cau[s]e of my lady's confining you in this manner: mercy on us, as if fle[s]h and blood without a title was not as good as fle[s]h and blood with one! Marry come up, and were I to be judge, I think you are to the full as good as Sir George, mayhap better. All is not gold that glitters. I warrant ye, if Sir George was once to [s]ee your [s]weet face, he would think a title well be[s]towed." "I do not under[s]tand you, my good Harley," [s]aid Rebecca, with a look of the utmo[s]t [s]implicity. "Oh! it is all very well, Mi[s]s; if you are [s]atisfied I am; only I [s]ay it is a [s]hame to [s]hut you up [s]o whenever Sir George comes." "Sir George!" cried Rebecca, eagerly; "is Sir George Worthy at Twickenham?" "Yes, Mi[s]s Becky, he is and that is the rea[s]on."--- "Hold, Harley; my lady's commands are [s]ufficient for me, without any rea[s]on alledged; but pray how long has Sir George been here?" "He arrived immediately on my lady's leaving [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] home, and amu[s]ed him[s]elf in the garden till a few moments before her return." "'Tis very well," [s]aid Rebecca: "Your mi[s]tre[s]s perhaps, may want you. Mrs. Harley, pray do not let me detain you." Harley muttered [s]omething about in[s]en[s]ible, and left the room. Lady Mary, having adju[s]ted her dre[s]s, repaired to the dining parlour, and [s]ent the butler to inform her [s]on that dinner was [s]erved. With a palpitating heart Sir George obeyed the [s]ummons; but how great was his [s]urpri[s]e and di[s]appointment, on entering the room, to [s]ee no per[s]on there but his mother, and the cloth laid but for two! His chagrin betrayed it[s]elf in his countenance. "Do we dine by our[s]elves madam?" [s]aid he somewhat confu[s]ed. "That is an odd que[s]tion, George," [s]aid her ladyship. "I thought you was acquainted with the recluse life I lead, and therefore could not expect to meet much company at my table." "Why that is true," [s]aid he, endeavouring at an air of indifference; "but I thought [s]ometimes a neighbour might drop in." He plainly perceived there was [s]omething of a mystery, and was too much a man of the world not to veil, as much as po[s][s]ible, the ardent de[s]ire he felt to penetrate it; he therefore partook of the repa[s]t provided for his mother, and when the cloth was removed, informed her he intended [s]pending a week or ten days with her, previous to her departure for Lincolu[s]hire. Lady Mary was rather [s]urpri[s]ed at this propo[s]al; but having long wi[s]hed for an opportunity to conver[s]e with her [s]on on a [s]ubject near her heart, namely, an union that had been for many years thought of between Lady Eleanor Harcourt, her brother's only child, and Sir George, for whom he had propo[s]ed to beg the title of Earl of Chatterton, in rever[s]ion, he being the only male branch remaining of the family: [s]he therefore [s]atisfied her[s]elf with [s]ending an affectionate note to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] Rebecca, briefly informing her of the cau[s]e that would occa[s]ion their [s]eparation for a few days, and a[s][s]uring her [s]he would vi[s]it her apartment the next morning, if opportunity offered. Rebecca [s]ighed as [s]he read the note; but [s]he flattered her[s]elf it was a [s]igh of plea[s]ure, for the happine[s]s her benefactre[s]s would enjoy in the company of her [s]on. In the cour[s]e of the evening Lady Mary introduced the [s]ubject neare[s]t her heart, and endeavoured to divine the real opinion Sir George entertained of his cou[s]in's per[s]on, merit and accompli[s]hments. He frankly acknowledged her a very amiable woman, a woman every way calculated to make the marriage [s]tate happy: "But," continued he, "pardon me, my dear madam, if I [s]ay, I do not think my[s]elf, by any means worthy the hand of [s]uch a woman. I am wild, and have [s]een [s]o much of elegant refined beauty, that it is no longer an object of admiration. I can look on my cou[s]in Eleanor, all lovely as [s]he is, without the lea[s]t emotion, except what proceeds from the affection I bear her as a near and worthy relation; but this is not the kind of affection nece[s][s]ary to form a happy marriage. My heart has ever been unmoved by real pa[s][s]ionate love, and I do verily believe, if ever it is en[s]nared, it will be by the pure charms of nature, unadulterated by art: I declare to you the enchanting naivet e of unaffected innocence would be to me a thousand times more captivating, than all the [s]plendid charms of an elegant accompli[s]hed woman of fa[s]hion." It is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe the a[s]toni[s]hment of Lady Mary upon this unexpected declaration of her [s]on; it kept her for [s]ome moments [s]ilent.---"It is well," [s]aid [s]he, mentally, "that I took tho[s]e precautions in regard to Rebecca; [s]he is exactly the woman to [s]uit his ta[s]te, and I [s]hould have experienced the mortification of [s]eeing my [s]on reject a title and [s]plendid fortune, and ally him[s]elf to ob[s]curity." "Perhaps, George," [s]aid [s]he, [s]miling, you have [s]omewhere met with a woman whom you think possesses tho[s]e captivating charms." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] "Oh! no," [s]aid he, carele[s]sly; but why [s]hould we talk on this [s]ubject now? Eleanor and my[s]elf are both young enough yet. Let her [s]ee a little more of the world; it is more than probable I may not be the man of her choice." "She will never have her father's con[s]ent to marry any other; nor do I think he would ever forgive a [s]tep of that nature; nor can I [s]ay, George, that I [s]hould ea[s]ily overlook your preferring any other woman to Eleanor." "Upon my [s]oul, my dear mother, this is a mo[s]t ridiculous idea! In the name of common [s]en[s]e, why are two per[s]ons, who experience nothing more than indifference towards each other, to be chained together, and [s]eal their own mi[s]ery, to gratify the inclinations of tho[s]e, who, though they have a right to our utmo[s]t re[s]pect and obedience, a[s][s]ume an undue authority when they endeavour to controul us in a point [s]o very delicate as the choice of a companion for life. I [s]ee you are offended, my dear mother; let me entreat you to pardon my [s]incerity. Believe me, your happine[s]s is the fir[s]t wi[s]h of my heart, and to promote it [s]hall be the whole [s]tudy of my life. It is to prevent you from future pain that I [s]peak thus, for, alas! what angui[s]h mu[s]t [s]eize the heart of a parent, who, having forced a beloved child into a loathed marriage, [s]ees him plunged in mi[s]ery, nay, perhaps, in guilt, from which [s]he has no power to extricate him: but let us not part in anger," continued he, ri[s]ing, and taking his mother's hand. "Be a[s][s]ured, [s]hould inclination ever prompt me to an union with Lady Eleanor, every tran[s]port I experience will be heightened by the thought that it increa[s]ed your felicity; but, [s]hould it not, let not your displeasure embitter the life of a [s]on who loves you with the true[s]t affection." He then ki[s][s]ed her cheek, and wi[s]hed her a good night. "He talks rea[s]onably," [s]aid Lady Mary, as he left the room; "but it would grieve me to [s]ee the family of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] Harcourt [s]ink to oblivion, when it is in his power to perpetuate both its name and title." FEMALE HEROISM. Sir George had previou[s]ly given his valet Le Brun an order to make inquiries obliquely concerning the fair reclu[s]e, whom he had [s]een at the window in the garden, and now retired with the eager expectation of hearing [s]omething of her. "Well, Le Brun," [s]aid he, "what news? Can you learn whether the fair [s]pirit of the garden haunts it continually, or only [s]ometimes?" "Oh, Mon[s]ieur," [s]aid Le Brun, "I did a[s]k Mademoiselle Harley. Oh! [s]he be one ver pret voman; [s]he never refu[s]e me any thing. She be von jolie petite fille." "Good Mon[s]ieur," [s]aid Sir George, "defer the account of your own [s]ucce[s]s till another opportunity, and inform me of what you have heard." "Dat be vat I vas intend, my Lor. Mademoi[s]elle Harley tell me dat my Lady, your moder, keep von ver charmante demoi[s]ell, to play, to read, to [s]ing to her ven [s]he be alone; but ven your onor, or any company, be com, my Lady do [s]hut her up." "And who does Harley [s]ay [s]he is?" "Oh! ma [s]oi; [s]he be de daughter of a pauvre old man, who vas one [s]oldier. He live in Lincoln[s]hire; de call her Mademoi[s]elle Rebecca---." "And does [s]he con[s]tantly occupy tho[s]e apartments in the [s]outh wing?" "Oue, Mon[s]ieur, oue, and [s]he valk every morning in de garden by de time de [s]un be up." This was enough for Sir George. He di[s]mi[s][s]ed Le Brun, and determined to ri[s]e by times him[s]elf, and join Rebecca in the garden. In the mean time Rebecca's thoughts were fully [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] employed in reflecting on the unexpected incident which had thrown her in the way of the very man whom it was her intere[s]t to wi[s]h to avoid. "It was unfortunate," [s]aid [s]he, "very unfortunate, that I [s]hould have opened the window at that time; if Lady Mary was to know I had [s]een and conver[s]ed with her [s]on, it would make her very unhappy, and yet how [s]hall I ever be able to face her after having, though involuntarily, tran[s]gre[s][s]ed the only re[s]triction [s]he thought fit to lay upon me? Will it not be be[s]t to watch the moment when [s]he retires to her apartment, to go to her, candidly confe[s]s the accidental rencounter, and endeavour to deprecate the anger I mu[s]t otherwi[s]e expect to encounter? Yes, it will certainly be right; my kind generous Lady Mary [s]hall never have occa[s]ion to accu[s]e me of want of [s]incerity." When [s]he had formed this re[s]olution, her thoughts again reverted to the elegant accompli[s]hed manner, and fine per[s]on of Sir George, again in idea [s]he recalled every [s]entence he had uttered, and innocently indulged the fa[s]cinating reflexion un[s]u[s]pecting of the consequence. The clock had ju[s]t [s]truck eleven when Rebecca heard the foot[s]tep of Lady Mary on the [s]tairs. She heard her enter her dre[s][s]ing room, and then, with palpitating heart, pre[s]ented her[s]elf at the door of the apartment, and, by a gentle tap, demanded admittance. Mrs. Harley opened the door; pale, trembling, her eyes ca[s]t on the ground, the agitated Rebecca entered, and courte[s]ying, in a manner in which the [s]oul [s]eemed to bow more than the body, attempted an apology for the untimely intru[s]ion. "Come in, my love," [s]aid Lady Mary, then looking at her face [s]he continued, "Are you not well, Rebecca, or has any thing alarmed you?" Your goodne[s]s, Madam, overpowers me," [s]aid Rebecca [s]eating her[s]elf; "my mind is not quite at ca[s]e, and, if you have a few moments to [s]pare, I [s]hould be glad to communicate [s]omething to you, without any witne[s]s to our conver[s]ation." "Harley," [s]aid her lady[s]hip, "I [s]hall not go to hed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] ju[s]t yet, and will ring when I want you. (Harley retired) "And now, my dear, what is this mighty secret?" taking Rebecca's hand. "I am come my deare[s]t Lady," [s]aid [s]he, ri[s]ing "to inform you, that I have, though unde[s]ignedly, broken your injunctions, and incurred your di[s]plea[s]ure: let me, therefore Madam, expiate my offence, by being banished from this delightful place, and from your truly valuable [s]ociety. Send me back, Madam, to my humble home; but, oh! I conjure you, do not deprive me of your friend[s]hip and good opinion, which I value infinitely more than any other earthly good." "You [s]urpri[s]e me my dear child! I am at a lo[s]s to comprehend your meaning. From the whole tenor of your conduct, [s]ince you have been here, I am convinced, that, if you have offended me, the fault was involuntary, indeed. Come, come, do not look [s]o grave: I [s]uppo[s]e this amazing [s]ault, when revealed, will be di[s]covered a very trifle. You have let my favourite canary out of its cage, or you have broke one of the large India jars." "Ah! my dear Lady, wor[s]e, infinitely wor[s]e, I have [s]een Sir George. Now, pray do not look angry; indeed, he is the fir[s]t and only per[s]on I have [s]een [s]ince my arrival here; nor did I [s]eek the interview." "Do not alarm your[s]elf thus, my love," [s]aid Lady Mary, obliging her to [s]it down again. "Come, compose your [s]pirits, and tell me [s]incerely how it happened, what pa[s][s]ed between you, and what you think of my [s]on?" "Oh! I think him," [s]aid Rebecca, the mo[s]t engaging young man I ever [s]aw; he has [s]uch a manly look, yet [s]uch a [s]oft air and voice." "Indeed!" [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, gravely, "and pray what might he [s]ay to you?" "Ah! Madam, it would be vanity in me to repeat all he [s]aid, he [s]poke [s]o many fine things." "It is well Rebecca, I [s]ee you [s]till retain that candour and [s]incerity for which I ever loved you. I am fully [s]atisfied that this interview was not [s]ought on your [s]ide, nor can I [s]uppo[s]e it was on his. You [s]eem to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] entertain a very favourable idea of Sir George, and I make no doubt but he does the [s]ame of you; but do not from this indulge any vain hopes that you can ever be any thing to each other. Young men of a certain rank in life, do not frequently match them[s]elves with their inferiors, yet they will leave no art une[s][s]ayed to awaken [s]en[s]ibility in the heart of every woman whom they affect to admire. Will you make me one promi[s]e, Rebecca, and, without re[s]erve, ever remember to keep it inviolate." "Dear Madam, do you, can you, doubt me? Speak your commands; I am [s]ure they will not be severe, and when I di[s]obey you, from that moment may peace and joy be [s]trangers to my bo[s]om." "Then promi[s]e me, my dear, that you will never, directly, nor indirectly, li[s]ten to any overtures of love which Sir George may make, or give him the lea[s]t encouragement; and while you keep the promi[s]e [s]acred, may every earthly happine[s]s [s]urround you; and [s]hould you ever feel inclined to break it, reflect it is the only thing which you can do to wound the peace of a woman who loves you as her own child." "Then hear me, Madam," [s]aid Rebecca, "while I [s]olemnly prote[s]t, that never, while I retain my [s]en[s]es, will I li[s]ten to any profe[s][s]ion of love whatever from your [s]on. The grateful affection I bear towards your Ladyship will prompt me to keep this vow inviolable, had I no other motive; but, my dear Lady, I have two powerful rea[s]ons for never infringing it. The fir[s]t, I tru[s]t you will believe, is an invincible repugnance inherent in my bo[s]om to every thing derogatory to the dignity and honour of my [s]ex, and which will urge me to treat with [s]corn every overture that tended to the injury of either:---And for the other, pardon me, Madam, I feel my inferiority, nay, feel it [s]o powerfully, that I will never meanly creep into a family who would think them[s]elves di[s]honoured by the alliance." "My dear good girl," [s]aid Lady Mary, embracing her, "I honour you for this [s]pirited reply. You would not di[s]honour any family; but I never was a friend to unequal matches; they are [s]eldom productive [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] of much felicity; be[s]ides, my [s]on is the de[s]tined husband of another." Rebecca heard her in [s]ilence, [s]ighed, and was preparing to leave the apartment. "Stay, my love," [s]aid Lady Mary, "though you have charmed me by the frankne[s]s and candour of your behaviour, I am not [s]atisfied, but that George will attempt to [s]ee you again; [s]hall I reque[s]t my dear girl will keep intirely in her apartment to-morrow, and avoid going to the windows, and in the evening a chai[s]e [s]hall be ordered to the back garden gate. My own man James [s]hall attend you, and you may proceed one [s]tage on your journey towards Lincoln[s]hire that night. James will take particular care of you, and [s]ee you [s]afe at your father's hou[s]e, where you can pay them a [s]hort vi[s]it till I join you, which will be in about three weeks time." She then put a heavy pur[s]e into her hand, bade her con[s]ider it as her own, and then wi[s]hed her a good night: but calling her back, as [s]he was about to leave the room, [s]he de[s]ired her to be careful what [s]he [s]aid to Harley, and in particular to avoid mentioning her intended journey. "Is it pride?" [s]aid Rebecca, as [s]he retired to re[s]t: "Or is it a tender wi[s]h for my felicity, that actuates Lady Mary? Surely it is the latter. Her liberality, her conde[s]cending affection, all tend to convince me it is my happine[s]s alone [s]he is [s]tudious to pre[s]erve: and never [s]hall it be [s]aid that Rebecca Littleton, like the ungrateful viper, [s]tung the friendly bo[s]om that warmed her into life; for, [s]urely, the cultivation of our mental faculties, the enlargement of our ideas, is a [s]econd, nay a better life than what we receive from nature, and this life I have received from my revered benefactre[s]s. What delightful [s]ources of plea[s]urable amu[s]ement has [s]he opened to my view! How inestimable the benefits I have received from her hand! Then her thoughts reverting to Sir George, [s]he continued, "Surely the [s]on of [s]uch a mother mu[s]t be all that is good and amiable, and it is not infringing my vow to love him as a brother. Ah! how happy will be the partner he [s]hall choo[s]e, nay, that he has cho[s]en; for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] did not his mother [s]ay his de[s]tiny was fixed? May their felicity be as la[s]ting as their lives! May every earthly ble[s][s]ing crown them! May heaven [s]hower down its bounties on their heads, that their joys may render completely happy the heart of my kind, my generous Lady Mary!" Then lifting up her [s]oul, in its nightly addre[s]s, to the Throne of Grace, [s]he blended the name of Sir George with that of his mother, and [s]unk into that peaceful kind of [s]lumber, which only innocence, like her's, can enjoy. MORTALITY. Small was the re[s]t Sir George enjoyed that night, and [s]oon as the morning peeped into his chamber he left his bed, and repaired to the part of the garden where Le Brun had informed him Rebecca usually walked; but vain was this early attention, vain the anxious expectation in which he waited, the goddess of his morning adoration did not make her appearance, nay, even [s]o [s]crupulous was [s]he of her Lady's injunctions, that [s]he kept the window [s]hutters clo[s]ed on the [s]ide next the garden, and only opened one that looked on a gra[s]s plot that faced Lady Mary's apartment. Till near nine o'clock Sir George walked in the hope of [s]eeing Rebecca; but finding tho[s]e hopes frustrated, he returned, highly di[s]appointed, to his apartment, and prepared to meet his mother at breakfa[s]t. "She has not been out, Le Brun," [s]aid he, as his valet was tying his hair: "I have walked three hours for nothing." "Oh! Mon[s]ieur vill have bon [s]tomache to his dejeunner." "Damn the breakfa[s]t," [s]aid Sir George, "What [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] could keep the lovely girl from walking as u[s]ual this morning?" "She be no awake yet," [s]aid Le Brun. "Mademoiselle Harley tell me [s]he no ring her bell yet." "Then Harley attends her?" "She vant ver lit attendance; [s]he be von amiable." "But Harley an[s]wers her bell?" "Oue, Mon[s]ieur, oue, no oder go to her chamber." Sir George [s]tarted from his [s]eat, wrote a few ha[s]ty lines, and bidding Le Brun give them to Harley with five guineas, de[s]ired they might be delivered into the hands of Rebecca. When Harley attended our heroine at breakfa[s]t, [s]he laid the letter on the table. "And what is this, Mrs. Harley?" [s]aid [s]he, taking it up. "A letter, Mi[s]s, which I was de[s]ired to deliver into your hands." "From whom does it come?" "A [s]weet rich gentleman, my dear young Lady, who, having once [s]een you, wi[s]hes again to enjoy that [s]atisfaction." "From Sir George Worthy?" Harley court[s]eyed a[s][s]ent. "Well then, my good Harley, take it to your Lady, de[s]ire her to read it, and dictate the an[s]wer [s]he would wi[s]h me to [s]end; or [s]tay, I will enclo[s]e it in a blank cover, and do you deliver it to the per[s]on who intru[s]ted it to your care." "Why, [s]urely," [s]aid Harley, "[s]urely, Mi[s]s Becky, you do not reflect on what you are doing! Sir George is a man of fortune, a hand[s]ome, agreeable man." "His beauty to me, Mrs. Harley, would be his lea[s]t recommendation: be[s]ides, I hope ever to make it an invariable rule of my conduct to receive no letters from men, without the [s]anction of tho[s]e who are better judges of what is proper than I can be: but, as it will be needle[s]s to trouble my Lady with this, give me that [s]heet of paper from the writing de[s]k." Harley gave her the paper; [s]he folded up the letter, [s]ealed it, and gave it to her. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] "But you have not directed it, Mi[s]s." "There is no nece[s][s]ity for directing it. Do you deliver it to the per[s]on who gave it to your care." "Ah! Mi[s]s, I think you will repent, for Le Brun tells me Sir George loves you to di[s]traction. He has been walking in the garden the[s]e three hours in hopes of meeting with you." "I am va[s]tly obliged to him," [s]aid Rebecca, smiling, while her cheeks a[s][s]umed a deeper glow, and her eyes a brighter lu[s]tre." "But you do not pity him, though his heart is almost breaking!" "I do pity him, Harley, indeed, I do; and if he were poorer, and I were richer---." "Ah! Mi[s]s, Love levels all di[s]tinctions. Sir George would think him[s]elf the per[s]on obliged. He told Le Brun you were the only woman he ever thought on with partiality." "Mrs. Harley," [s]aid Rebecca, opening a drawer of a [s]mall cabinet, "do me the favour to accept the[s]e few yards of lace; I never had an opportunity before of giving you [s]ome [s]mall token of my gratitude for your kind attention to me [s]ince I have been in this family. But, good Mrs. Harley, you mu[s]t never talk to me in this manner again. I beg you will not tell me any thing that Le Brun [s]ays; I have no de[s]ire---that is---it is not proper---I mu[s]t not li[s]ten to [s]uch discourse." Harley, [s]impering, withdrew, and the innocent Rebecca little imagined [s]he had betrayed a [s]ecret which [s]he ought to have guarded with the utmo[s]t care; nay, [s]he even did not think that her heart was the lea[s]t interested in Sir George's welfare, any otherwi[s]e than, as the [s]on of her benefactre[s]s, it was her duty to rejoice in his felicity. The remainder of the day Rebecca [s]pent in arranging her clothes, &c. for her journey; nor did [s]he forget, among her mu[s]ick, to put the new [s]ong, "It is certainly extremely pretty," and [s]he [s]ung it to her[s]elf all the day. Towards evening Lady Mary rang for Harley. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] "Harley," [s]aid [s]he, "I think you have a brother at Wind[s]or. I have ordered a chai[s]e for Mi[s]s Littleton to take a ride this evening, therefore, if you like, you may go with her. Be [s]at down at your brother's and [s]tay all night. I will call for you to-morrow as I take an airing." Harley, who little [s]u[s]pected the [s]cheme that was in agitation, readily embraced this opportunity of vi[s]iting her brother. She looked about for Le Brun, to inform him of her intended ab[s]ence; but Lady Mary had taken care to [s]end him out of the way. Her Lady[s]hip took a very affectionate leave of Rebecca, told her James had received every nece[s][s]ary order, and again thanked her for the integrity of heart [s]he had [s]o nobly [s]hown in having no concealments from her, and promi[s]ed her that her friend[s]hip, for her[s]elf and family, [s]hould be manife[s]ted, even after her death. She then returned to the drawing room, and kept Sir George engaged in conver[s]ation till [s]he imagined Rebecca was departed. Sir George, though mortified by the return of his letter unopened, yet conceived great hopes from the account Harley gave him of their conver[s]ation, and determined to watch carefully for an opportunity to [s]ee and per[s]onally plead his own cau[s]e to his fair en[s]laver; but he cautiou[s]ly concealed the[s]e thoughts from his mother, whom he was far from imagining was, at that very moment, counteracting all his [s]chemes. In the mean time Rebecca continued her journey, and by noon, on the [s]econd day of her departure, [s]he found her[s]elf drawing very near her father's cottage. "Ah!" [s]aid [s]he, "how [s]urpri[s]ed and delighted will the dear old gentleman be to [s]ee me arrive [s]o unexpectedly; nay, I think, even my mother will rejoice to [s]ee her child after [s]o long an ab[s]ence:" then, in idea, [s]he ran over all [s]he had to relate to them. "And how my father will applaud my conduct!" [s]aid [s]he, exultingly. "Surely there can be no plea[s]ure in this world equal to the applau[s]e of a parent whom we love, and whom it has ever been our [s]tudy to obey." The chai[s]e drew up to the door. She looked towards [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] the parlour window; no one appeared. "I am afraid they are not at home," [s]aid [s]he; but ca[s]ting her eyes up to the chamber, [s]he [s]aw the window curtains clo[s]e drawn. At that in[s]tant Ruth, their faithful [s]ervant, appeared at the door. "Oh! dear Mi[s]s," [s]aid Ruth, in a tone of [s]orrow, "I did not think you could have come [s]o [s]oon." "What is the matter?" cried Rebecca, [s]pringing from the chai[s]e, and [s]eizing the hand of Ruth, in breathle[s]s agitation. "Your poor father!" [s]aid the [s]ervant. "Oh, God! my father is dead!" "No, my dear Mi[s]s, not dead; but very---very ill." "Merciful heaven!" cried Rebecca, [s]inking on her knees, with upli[s]ted hands and [s]treaming eyes, "restore him to my prayers, or let me not live to know his lo[s]s." The tran[s]ition was [s]o great, from plea[s]ure to extreme [s]orrow, that [s]he could no longer [s]upport it, but fainted in the arms of Ruth. On her recovery [s]he found her mother by her [s]ide. She threw her arms round her neck, wept audibly on her bo[s]om, but could not [s]peak. "Ah! child, you may well cry," [s]aid Mrs. Littleton, "for your father is not expected to live one hour after another." "Then lead me to him, dear mother; lead me to him, that I may receive his ble[s][s]ing, and catch his la[s]t figh. Ah! he mu[s]t not die without a parting embrace to his Rebecca." Mrs. Littleton made no reply, but proceeded [s]lowly up the [s]tairs. Rebecca followed, and in a moment found her[s]elf by the bed-[s]ide of her almo[s]t expiring father. He put forth his hand; [s]he pre[s][s]ed it to her lips, and [s]unk in [s]peechle[s]s agony on her knees. "Do not lament thus, my dear child!" [s]aid he faintly: "Heaven's will be done. I tru[s]t you have found a protector in Lady Mary, and I [s]hall go satistisfied with that comfortable reflexion." "Protector! indeed," cried Mrs. Littleton, peevisnly; "heavy was the day when [s]he left her home for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] the protection of [s]trangers! I am [s]ure you have never been well [s]ince. This illne[s]s is all her fault. You have done nothing but pine and mope about, and if any thing happens it will all lay at her door; but [s]he was [s]o eager for[s]ooth to go, any where rather than home, [s]he was tired of the company of her old father and mother." "Do not, my dear love," [s]aid Mr. Littleton, "do not embitter my la[s]t moments by laying on the mind of this poor girl more than [s]he can bear. Behold her angui[s]h, and pity it. Do not attribute my illne[s]s to [s]o wrong a cau[s]e. My frame has long been decaying: I felt it my[s]elf, though I forbore to afflict your bo[s]om by mentioning my apprehen[s]ion." "Oh! my father," cried Rebecca; "I hope you will recover. I hope---." "Do not deceive your[s]elf, my dear; my di[s]order is a decay of nature, and a [s]low nervous fever, which the phy[s]ician informed me ye[s]terday it was impo[s][s]ible to remove. I then de[s]ired your mother to [s]end for you; but tell me, my child, how is it po[s][s]ible you can have arrived [s]o [s]oon?" "Alas!" replied Rebecca, "I did not know you were ill till I arrived at the door. I came by my Lady's de[s]ire to [s]pend a few weeks with you and my mother before [s]he comes into the country." "You have not offended her, Rebecca?" [s]aid the father. "No indeed," [s]aid [s]he, exultingly; "I am higher in her e[s]teem than ever." "Ah! [s]o [s]he may tell you," cried Mrs. Littleton; "but I will an[s]wer for it [s]he was tired of your company, or [s]he would never have [s]ent you away before her; [s]o there is an end of your fine hopes, Mi[s]s Becky." It was with the utmo[s]t unea[s]ine[s]s that Rebecca beheld her mother thus prejudiced again[s]t her. She endeavoured to recollect if any inadvertant expre[s][s]ion, in any of her letters, had given her cau[s]e of offence; and, in hopes to conciliate her good humour, [s]he, in the evening, opened her trunk, and pre[s]ented her mother with the [s]ilk before-mentioned. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] She received it [s]ullenly, and laying it down, without [s]carce deigning to look at it, [s]aid, "This is no time to think of fine clothes, child, though in my heart I believe your thoughts never run on any thing el[s]e but dre[s]s, and fa[s]hion, and non[s]en[s]e." The truth was, that if Rebecca had a foible it was a pa[s][s]ion for fa[s]hionable dre[s]s; but this was never carried to an extreme, and, though remarkably attentive to the decoration of her per[s]on, [s]he was never fine or tawdry. This ill-timed reproach of her mother's filled her eyes with tears, and [s]he retired to bed, but not to re[s]t, her father's illne[s]s, and the di[s]tance [s]he then was from her benefactre[s]s, were [s]uch painful reflexions, that [s]leep was a [s]tranger to her eyes till the morning began to dawn, when [s]he enjoyed a few hours of compo[s]ed [s]lumber. Mr. Littleton's di[s]order daily increa[s]ed. He found his end nearly approaching, and frequently recommended to his daughter to pre[s]erve, after his death, the [s]ame dutiful re[s]pect for her mother [s]he had ever manife[s]ted. To Mrs. Littleton he did not fail to recommend a tenderne[s]s of behaviour, that might tend to invite the confidence of Rebecca. "You are too har[s]h with the poor girl," he would [s]ay; "treat her kindly: I am [s]ure you will find her de[s]erving of it." "I know her better than you do," was the con[s]tant reply, "and I know [s]he is an artful, de[s]igning girl." Mr. Littleton could not believe any evil of his favourite, and died in her arms on the fifth day after her arrival, ble[s][s]ing her with his la[s]t breath. DISAPPOINTMENT. Sir George had not really determined in his own mind whether he would addre[s]s Rebecca on an honourable [s]core, or merely endeavour to gain her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] affections, and then act as he [s]hould find, from her manner and di[s]po[s]itiou, [s]he de[s]erved. That day and the next he waited patiently in the hope of [s]eeing her; but on the third, when Harley returned, (for Lady Mary did not bring her home till that time) how great was his [s]urpri[s]e and disappointment to hear that Rebecca had been [s]ent for into the country to a relation that was ill; for Mrs. Littleton's letter arriving the day following Rebecca's departure, it [s]erved as a [s]ufficient apology for her ab[s]ence, though indeed, Lady Mary did not think proper to enter into explanations with her woman, and rather mi[s]led her, by mentioning Bri[s]tol as the place where Rebecca's [s]ick friend was. Though Sir George had previou[s]ly informed his mother that he thought of accompanying her into Lincolnshire, he no [s]ooner heard that the object of his pur[s]uit had taken a different route than he determined to pur[s]ue her. "I have thought better of it," [s]aid he to her Ladyship; "I [s]hall not vi[s]it my tenants this year, for I have [s]everal engagements in town which I cannot well get off: be[s]ides, I had forgot that I had promi[s]ed a friend of mine to accompany him to Bath." "Ah! cried Lady Mary, exultingly to her[s]elf, "my good George, your journey will be in vain." In a few days Sir George left Twickenham, and immediately [s]et out with po[s]t hor[s]es for Bri[s]tol, where both him[s]elf and Le Brun were extremely diligent in their inquiries, though the reader may ea[s]ily imagine to how little effect: however, he [s]till continued, and nouri[s]hed the hope, that chance would, by [s]ome means or other, di[s]cover to him the re[s]idence of the fair Rebecca, for as he could not [s]uppo[s]e the [s]ituation of her friend very [s]plendid, he thought it needle[s]s to inquire for her among people of fa[s]hion; but he de[s]ired his valet to be very minute in examining every hou[s]e where they let lodgings. Three weeks had now elap[s]ed [s]ince Rebecca's departure, and Lady Mary was preparing to vi[s]it Lincolnshire, when, as [s]he was conver[s]ing with her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] daughter, Lady O[s][s]iter, one morning, [s]he was [s]uddenly [s]eized with a fainting fit, which was [s]ucceeded by several others, and left her [s]o weak and low, that the faculty called in thought her life in imminent danger. Alarmed at this intelligence, [s]he de[s]ired Harley to write immediately for Rebecca to return, and, calling for pen and ink, determined no longer to delay making the poor girl independent; but when [s]he took the pen and attempted to write, her faintne[s]s returned, and [s]he was totally unable to execute her purpo[s]e; but re[s]olved to do [s]omething for her, [s]he called Lady O[s][s]iter to her, and thus addre[s][s]ed her: "There is a young woman, of the name of Littleton, who has been with me [s]ome months, though now [s]he is in the country. She is of a [s]weet di[s]po[s]ition, and it was my intention to leave her at my death a thou[s]and pounds. I reque[s]t you, my child, to pay her this [s]um, as [s]oon as you conveniently can, after my decea[s]e, and al[s]o give her my watch, a [s]mall picture [s]et with pearls, and this ring, taking one from her finger. I hope [s]he will arrive time enough to be informed from my own mouth of my intentions in her favour; but [s]hould [s]he not, I tru[s]t, you will not be neglectful of the de[s]ire of a dying mother." It was with great difficulty, and many interruptions, that Lady Mary made known to her daughter this her reque[s]t. Lady O[s][s]iter promi[s]ed obedience; but, alas! Lady O[s][s]iter [s]eldom remembered her promi[s]e, however [s]acredly given. It was impo[s][s]ible to give Sir George notice of his mother's danger, for no one knew where he was. Lady Mary continued tolerably compo[s]ed all that night; but the next day her fits returned, and [s]he expired in the evening. When Rebecca received the news of her benefactre[s]s's illne[s]s [s]he flew to Audley Park. James was [s]till there. "Your Lady is very ill, James," [s]aid [s]he; "I mu[s]t [s]et off immediately for Twickenham." "And I will attend you, Mi[s]s," [s]aid James, eagerly. "Only [s]ay when you will like to [s]et off, and I will order the chai[s]e." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] "I will go the moment you can procure one," [s]aid [s]he. "I thought you would go with me, James, and, indeed, I [s]hould be afraid to take [s]uch a journey by my[s]elf; but do not order a hor[s]e, my good James; we [s]hall travel fa[s]ter if you ride in the chai[s]e with me. I could not bear to have you hurrying after me on hor[s]eback." James had lived with Lady Mary from the day of her marriage. He had [s]erved his mi[s]tre[s]s with the true[s]t fidelity, and the tears gu[s]hed from his aged eyes when he heard of her danger. When Mrs. Littleton [s]ound Rebecca was determined to obey Harley's [s]ummons, [s]he conceived it was a high, an unpardonable breach of filial duty, for her to think of leaving a mother in [s]o early a [s]tate of widowhood. "You give me a great proof of your affection, Mi[s]s," cried [s]he, [s]cornfully, "to leave me in [s]o much affliction, and fly po[s]t ha[s]te after [s]trangers: however, we [s]hall [s]ee who is mo[s]t worthy your attentions by and bye. I [s]uppo[s]e, when my Lady is tired of you again, you will be glad enough then to return to your mother." Though Rebecca was greatly hurt by the[s]e unju[s]t reproaches, it did not prevent her intended journey, and [s]he [s]et off that evening attended by James, and, indeed, in her own mind, firmly re[s]olved, that nothing but ab[s]olute nece[s][s]ity [s]hould ever oblige her again to vi[s]it Lincoln[s]hire, except it was in the company of Lady Mary. It was late in the evening when [s]he arrived at Twickenham. The [s]ad countenance of the dome[s]tic who opened the door, led her pre[s]aging heart to fear the wor[s]t. Harley met her in the hall, pre[s][s]ed her hand in [s]ilence, and proceeded to light her to her u[s]ual apartment. Rebecca hardly dared breathe as [s]he went up [s]tairs; as [s]he pa[s]t her Lady's dre[s][s]ing-room, [s]he [s]topped, looked earne[s]tly at Harley, and, laying her hand on her heart, cried: "Tell me the truth:" but her re[s]piration became [s]o difficult [s]he could not fini[s]h the [s]entence. "All is over," [s]aid Harley. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] "I feared [s]o," cried Rebecca; then turning into her own room, [s]he [s]unk on the bed in a [s]tate of [s]tupid in[s]en[s]ibility, from whence it was difficult to rou[s]e her. Harley u[s]ed her utmo[s]t endeavours, and at length [s]ucceeded. Rebecca rai[s]ed her cla[s]ped hands to heaven, exclaimed, "Thy will be done," and the [s]alutary drops of [s]orrow gu[s]hed in a torrent from her eyes! Harley was plea[s]ed to [s]ee them flow, and imagining to leave her to the free indulgence of them would be be[s]t, retired to inform Lady O[s][s]iter (who had not yet left Twickenham) that Rebecca was arrived. "I will [s]ee her in the morning," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, carele[s]sly. "Take her with you, Harley, to the hou[s]e-keeper's room." "She is in her own apartment, Madam. She never a[s][s]ociated with even the upper [s]ervants." "Oh! [s]he is quite the fine Lady I [s]uppo[s]e. How could you endure the creature's pride, Harley?" "I never di[s]covered that [s]he had any, Madam. She is the meeke[s]t being in exi[s]tence." "My mother u[s]ed to [s]ay [s]he was hand[s]ome," cried her Lady[s]hip, looking in the gla[s]s. "I believe every one thought her [s]o who looked at her. Sir George was greatly [s]truck with her, though he [s]aw her but once." "Well, [s]o much the better; I [s]uppo[s]e he will take the trouble of providing for her off my hands; eh, Harley, don't you think [s]o?" "Indeed, Madam, I have often thought Mi[s]s Littleton would one day be Lady Worthy." "Woman!" [s]aid Lady O[s][s]iter, turning ha[s]tily round, with a look of the utmo[s]t contempt, "how could [s]uch an idea enter your mind? Lady Worthy, indeed! No, I think George knows better than that; he may, perhaps, make her his mi[s]tre[s]s: but go, good woman, go, you have made me quite [s]ick by the horrid [s]ugge[s]tion." "Poor Rebecca," [s]aid Harley, [s]oftly, as [s]he left her imperious Lady: "Poor girl, you will [s]ee a [s]ad change I fear. You have lo[s]t your be[s]t friend, and [s]o we have all, indeed; for though my late dear Lady was proud [s]he never wanted humanity." TEARS OF SENSIBILITY AND SORROW A-LA-MODE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] When the mind of Rebecca became a little composed, Harley prevailed on her to take [s]ome refre[s]hment. She took a few mouthfuls of boiled chicken and drank a gla[s]s of wine, and then inquired in which room the remains of her revered benefactre[s]s lay. "In her own dre[s][s]ing-room as yet," [s]aid Harley; "but to-morrow [s]he will be removed." Rebecca [s]aid but little more, and Harley thinking the fatigue of her journey, and the agitation of her mind combined, might incline her to go early to re[s]t, removed the [s]upper table, and wi[s]hed her a good night. No [s]ooner was Rebecca alone than [s]he gave way to a fre[s]h bur[s]t of grief; the lo[s]s of her father was again renewed, the unkindne[s]s of her mother was remembered with double angui[s]h, and her own friendle[s]s [s]ituation [s]truck [s]o forcibly on her mind, that her [s]orrow became almo[s]t in[s]upportable. At length her tears [s]eemed exhau[s]ted; a kind of torpid calm [s]ucceeded, and [s]he formed the re[s]olution of vi[s]iting the chamber that contained the decea[s]ed Lady Mary. With ha[s]ty and unequal [s]tep [s]he reached the door of the apartment, opened it [s]oftly, and pau[s]ed for a moment to [s]ummon all her fortitude.---The attendants in the adjoining room heard her enter, and approached to con[s]ole her; but [s]he waved her hand in [s]ilence for them to retire, and they re[s]pected her too much to attempt an intru[s]ion on her grief, but left her to the free indulgence of it.---She placed the candle [s]he held in her hand on a table and approached the coffin, gazed, with reverential awe on that countenance, which had often beamed on her looks of the kinde[s]t benevolence. "Dear and only friend," [s]aid [s]he, "[s]ince thou art gone, where is there a heart remaining that feels one [s]park of affection for the poor Rebecea? Oh my more than mother, thy adopted child is now bere[s]t of every earthly comfort! Spirit of purity, look down from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] man[s]ions of felicity, and hear the vows I here repeat: never to infringe one command of your's while life warms my heart. While you lived it was my pride, my glory, to de[s]erve the affection with which you honoured me, and if [s]hall be [s]till my [s]tudy to pre[s]erve, to the late[s]t hour of my life, my integrity un[s]haken; though you can no longer be [s]en[s]ible of my re[s]pect and love, [s]acred [s]hall be your memory to my heart, that heart which, whil[s]t it retains your precepts, can never [s]tray from the path of rectitude, never be unworthy of the regard of all who love virtue."---Here her feelings overpowered her; her head [s]unk on her hand---her tears again bur[s]t forth--- her lips continued to move---but articulation was denied.--- At this in[s]tant the door opened, and Sir George entered. He [s]tarted involuntarily at beholding Rebecca. Her pen[s]ive attitude, her depre[s][s]ed countenance plainly depicted the [s]orrows of her heart; the afflicted maid had not heard his approach. He drew near, and laid his hand on one of her's. She rai[s]ed her timid eyes, looked at him mournfully, pointed to the coffin, and cried, emphatically: "She is gone for ever!" Sir George really loved and re[s]pected his mother; nor had he heard of her illne[s]s when the public prints announced her decea[s]e. Shocked beyond mea[s]ure, he in[s]tantly took po[s]t hor[s]es, and never [s]topped, even for nece[s][s]ary refre[s]hment, till he alighted at his mother's gate, [s]aint and fatigued. He a[s]ked if his [s]i[s]ter was there, and being informed [s]he was in the drawing-room, he went ha[s]tily up [s]tairs; but how was he di[s]gn[s]ted, upon entering the room, to [s]ee the unfeeling daughter of [s]o good a mother receive him with the greate[s]t [s]ang froid  . She aro[s]e, pre[s]ented her cheek, was glad to [s]ee him, [s]lightly mentioned the melancholy event, and [s]oon after a[s]ked him if he intended ordering a mourning coach, or only to put his [s]ervants in black? "I think," continued [s]he, "the mournings are much [s]horter than they u[s]ed to be, and nothing near [s]o deep: I am glad of it; for my own part I dete[s]t mourning, it makes one look [s]o dirty and di[s]mal." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] Ju[s]t then Lord O[s][s]iter entered, and propo[s]ed a game at cards, by way of whiling away the evening. "Ah! do join us, George," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip; "I have been moped to death this week pa[s]t." "I am not in a humour for amu[s]ement, [s]i[s]ter," [s]aid Sir George, coldly; "and [s]ince you have no feeling your[s]elf of the irreparable lo[s]s we have [s]u[s]tained, I [s]hall not trouble you with mine, but retire where I may indulge them uninterrupted." How great mu[s]t be the contra[s]t then between this unfeeling [s]i[s]ter and the affecting [s]en[s]ibility of Rebecca! He pre[s][s]ed her pa[s][s]ive hand in [s]ilence, mingled his tears with her's, and found his heart in[s]en[s]ibly relieved. "My poor mother," [s]aid he, after a pau[s]e of a few moments, "little did I think when we parted it was the la[s]t time!" "She is undoubtedly happy," [s]aid Rebecca, "in [s]ome mea[s]ure, forgetting her own [s]orrow, and wi[s]hing to convey con[s]olation into the bo[s]om of Sir George." "Oh! I know [s]he is," replied Sir George; "if the practice of every virtue can in[s]ure eternal felicity, [s]he is happy beyond what our weak imaginations can paint." Rebecca's tears [s]treamed afre[s]h.---"Ah! my dear mother," [s]aid he, "your loved remains are embalmed by the tears of grateful affection, though thy daughter, forgetful of thy worth, can amu[s]e her[s]elf with trifles, and neglect the tribute due to thy memory." "Ah!" [s]aid Rebecca, "I never can forget her--- never wi[s]h it; for the remembrance of her virtues will emulate me in the attempt to imitate them." She pre[s][s]ed her lips to tho[s]e of her clay cold benefactress, faintly and tremulou[s]ly pronounced the word "farewell!" and ru[s]hed ha[s]tily out of the apartment. The next morning, at twelve o'clock Harley summoned her to attend Lady O[s][s]iter. On entering the dre[s][s]ing room, [s]he found her Ladyship deeply engaged with her mantua-maker and milliner. She did not even notice the entrance of Rebecca; but thus continued her directions to the former of her trade[s]women: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] "Let them be made as elegant and as full as possible; but, at the [s]ame time, remember, I wi[s]h to pay every nece[s][s]ary re[s]pect to my dear mother. It was a very [s]udden thing. Mrs. Modily, you cannot think how it [s]hocked me; my nerves will not be [s]ettled again this fortnight, I dare [s]ay; then, a thing of this kind forces one to be mewed up, and [s]ee no company, [s]o I thought I might as well [s]tay where I was as go to town. But, as I was [s]aying, Modily, let my white bombazine be made very hand[s]ome, and full trimmed with crape: I do not mean to keep from vi[s]iting above a fortnight, and, I think, in a month or [s]ix weeks I may wear white mu[s]lin, with black crape ornaments, for undre[s]s." The accommodating mantua-maker agreed to all the Lady [s]aid, when, turning round to [s]peak to her milliner, Lady O[s][s]iter was [s]truck by the elegant per[s]on, and mode[s]t humble countenance of Rebecca. "Oh! I [s]uppo[s]e," [s]aid [s]he, carele[s]sly, "you are the young woman my poor mother mentioned in her la[s]t moments?" Rebecca court[s]eyed a[s][s]ent, but was unable to [s]peak. "Ah! [s]he was very good to you, I understandWell, don't make your[s]elf unea[s]y, I will be you friend in future." Rebecca attempted to expre[s]s her thanks; but her emotions were [s]o violent, [s]he was forced to continue [s]ilent. "I dare [s]ay, child," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, "you have [s]ome ta[s]te in dre[s]s; come, give me your opinion about the caps I have ordered. Here, La Blond, [s]how her tho[s]e caps: well now, what do you think, will the[s]e be deep enough? for, though I hate mourning, I would not be wanting in re[s]pect; one's friends are apt enough to [s]ay ill-natured things; one can't be too cautious in giving them occa[s]ion. Do you think I [s]hould go without powder? You look mon[s]trous well without powder; but then you have light hair, and your black dre[s]s, though [s]o very plain, is becoming. Who are you in mourning for, child?" Rebecca was [s]truck almo[s]t [s]peechle[s]s with astonishment. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] "Good heavens!" [s]aid [s]he, mentally, "can this be the daughter of Lady Worthy?" "Who are you in mourning for, child?" [s]aid Lady O[s][s]iter. "My father, Madam." "Oh! you have lo[s]t your father. Well, it can't be helped, old folks mu[s]t be expected to drop off. You mu[s]t not be low [s]pirited if you are with me: I hate low [s]pirited people, though [s]ince I lo[s]t my poor mother I have been low enough my[s]elf; but I endeavour to [s]hake it off as much as I can; it is of no manner of u[s]e to grieve; when folks are once dead, we can't recal them, though we fretted our[s]elves blind." "But we cannot always command our feelings, Madam," [s]aid Rebecca. "No, child, that is true. I am [s]ure I often wi[s]h my feelings were not [s]o delicate as they are; it is a great affliction to have too much [s]en[s]ibility. Pray what is your name, my dear?" "Rebecca." "Rebecca, that's a queer old fa[s]hion name. I remember when my mother u[s]ed to make me read the great Family Bible, I remember then reading about a Rebecca Somebody; but, Lord! child, 'tis a va[s]t vulgar name; I'd alter it if I was you; one never hears of [s]uch a name among people of any re[s]inement." "I am [s]orry it does not plea[s]e your Lady[s]hip," [s]aid Rebecca, almo[s]t [s]miling at her ab[s]urdity; "but as I was chri[s]tened by it I mu[s]t be [s]atisfied with it." "Well, then, Rebecca, but what is your other name?" "Littleton, Madam." "Ah, Lord! they are both three [s]yllables---that is [s]o tire[s]ome. Well, but, Rebecca (for I like the name be[s]t on account of its oddity) [s]hould you have any objection to enter into my [s]ervice?" "Far from it, Madam; I [s]hall cheerfully [s]erve any part of the family of my dear departed Lady?" "Ah! but I am not quite [s]o [s]entimental as my mother was: I [s]hall not want any body to work and read by me. I [s]hall want you to be u[s]eful; now for in[s]tance, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] to make up my morning caps, to trim my mu[s]lin dresses. Can you [s]peak French, child?" "Yes, Madam, and [s]hall be happy to render my[s]elf u[s]eful in any thing within the compa[s]s of my power. I do not wi[s]h to eat the bread of idlene[s]s." Rebecca [s]poke with a degree of [s]pirit that [s]urpri[s]ed Lady O[s][s]iter: however, [s]he unaba[s]hed, proceeded: "I have two little boys and a girl; I really have not time to attend them: now I could wi[s]h you to hear them read, give them [s]ome little knowledge of the French, and take care of Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter's clothes. Can you make frocks?" "I make no doubt but I can, if I try, and my utmost endeavours [s]hall not be wanting." "That is well. I under[s]tand my mother did not [s]uffer you to eat with the [s]ervants, [s]o you [s]hall have your meals in the nur[s]ery with the children. I [s]uppo[s]e, if my woman [s]hould happen to be ill, or out of the way, you would have no objection to dre[s]s or undre[s]s me. "I am afraid I [s]hould be awkward, Madam; but if you will pardon my want of experience, you [s]hall always find me ready to obey your commands." "And what wages do you expect?" "Whatever you plea[s]e." "What did my mother give you?" "I had no [s]ettled [s]alary." "Well, but I like to know what I am about; I'll give you [s]ixteen guineas a year." Rebecca agreed to the terms, and, retiring to her apartment, left Lady O[s][s]iter to fini[s]h her con[s]ultation with her milliner and mantua-maker---while [s]he took up her pen, and informed her mother that [s]he had entered into a new line of life, in which [s]he hoped to be enabled to do her duty, and gain the approbation of her Lady. THE MAN OF THE WORLD. During the time that intervened between the death of Lady Mary and her interment, Sir George, though he frequently thought of Rebecca, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] made no attempt to [s]ee her, but [s]atisfied him[s]elf with [s]ending every day to inquire after her health. "It is certainly a very improper time," [s]aid he, "to think of entertaining her on the [s]ubject of love. Her heart is at pre[s]ent over charged with [s]orrow; be[s]ides I [s]hould prove my[s]elf highly unworthy of her e[s]teem, could I, at this melancholy period, think [s]eriou[s]ly on any thing but the mournful cau[s]e of our meeting." The morning after the la[s]t [s]olemn ceremony was performed, Sir George, [s]itting at breakfa[s]t with his brother and [s]i[s]ter, mentioned that, in re[s]pect to his mother's memory, he [s]hould remain at Twickenham a couple of months, and [s]ee no company, but one or two [s]elect friends: he then invited Lord and Lady O[s][s]iter to remain with him during that period, and propo[s]ed [s]ending immediately for the children. "You'll pardon me, brother," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip; "I cannot think of remaining any longer in this melancholy place than till to-morrow, and I mu[s]t [s]ay you are much to blame, in re[s]olving to bury your[s]elf from the world: I am [s]ure it is a [s]tep which cannot be expected from [s]o young a man." "You are to act as you plea[s]e, [s]i[s]ter, and, I hope, you will permit me to do the [s]ame." "Oh! apropos , you know the young woman, Rebecca--- what's her name? I never can remember it. She that my mother kept with her as a kind of companion." "I have [s]een her," [s]aid Sir George, "and cannot [s]ay but I am [s]urpri[s]ed my mother made no mention of her in her will; but, I [s]uppo[s]e, [s]he de[s]ired you to make [s]ome provi[s]ion for her." "Yes, [s]he did mention her to me, and I have taken her into my protection." Here Lord O[s][s]iter, who had been carele[s]sly looking over the news-paper, laid it down. "So then," [s]aid he, with an air of curio[s]ity, "your Lady[s]hip has taken her as a companion; but, pray, if that is the ca[s]e, why is [s]he not at the breakfa[s]t table, to [s]ave you the trouble of making the tea?" "Oh! you labour under a va[s]t mi[s]take, my Lord; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] no humble toad-eater will ever make a part of my household. I a[s][s]ure you, I dete[s]t the whole cla[s]s of them; they are in general a [s]et of forward, impertinent creatures, made up of pride and idlene[s]s: I keep nobody about me but can render them[s]elves u[s]eful; and I know of no u[s]e your cringing companions are but to critici[s]e their Lady's actions, and contribute to their Lord's amu[s]ement." His Lord[s]hip looked di[s]appointed, and rea[s][s]umed the news-paper. Sir George was perfectly a[s]toni[s]hed at his [s]i[s]ter's illbred expre[s][s]ions; but willing to know in what manner Rebecca was provided for, [s]imply a[s]ked the que[s]tion. "Why, I have taken her into the nur[s]ery to teach the children to read." "I approve the plan va[s]tly," [s]aid Lord O[s][s]iter, again laying down the paper: "I think the children wanted a governe[s]s." "Not [s]o fa[s]t, my Lord: I have as great a di[s]like to governe[s][s]es as to companions. I hate the whole cla[s]s of your [s]econd-hand gentry. Rebecca will hear them read---dre[s]s and undre[s]s Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter---make her frocks--- and upon occa[s]ion, a[s][s]i[s]t my woman." Sir George felt his cheeks glow with indignation. "I think, [s]i[s]ter," [s]aid he, "con[s]idering the place [s]he held in our mother's e[s]teem, the [s]ituation you mean to give her is not paying that dear woman's memory a proper re[s]pect; be[s]ides, I do not think it probable, after having been treated as the companion of Lady Mary, Mi[s]s Littleton will feel her[s]elf [s]atisfied with being only the [s]ervant of her daughter." "Don't make your[s]elf unea[s]y about that, George; I have talked with her, and agreed about terms; however, if you choo[s]e to retain her here as hou[s]e-keeper extraordinary," attempting an arch look,--- "To cheer the [s]olitary days of mourning," added his Lord[s]hip. Sir George darted at them both a look of the utmo[s]t contempt. "Your inuendos," [s]aid he, "are as cruel as they are groundle[s]s: however, Lady O[s][s]iter, you will plea[s]e to know, that no per[s]on, who has been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] honoured by the friend[s]hip of my mother, [s]hall be treated with di[s]re[s]pect, when I have the power to prevent it. If Mi[s]s Littleton is not [s]atisfied with her [s]ituation, I [s]hall think it my duty to place her above it." "I will [s]end for her here, and you may a[s]k her," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip. "Aye, that is the be[s]t way," [s]aid Lord O[s][s]iter, ringing the bell; for from Sir George's evident agitation, he imagined there mu[s]t be [s]omething extraordinary about Rebecca, and earne[s]tly wi[s]hed to [s]ee her. "Tell Rebecca I want her," [s]aid the Lady to the [s]ervant who entered the room. "For heaven's [s]ake, Lady O[s][s]iter," [s]aid Sir George, "do not [s]hock the poor girl's feelings, by [s]ending for her here." "Oh! Lord, [s]he mu[s]t get the better of tho[s]e feelings you talk about, or [s]he will never be good for much; be[s]ides, it always diverts me to [s]ee her blu[s]h, and look like a fool." "Rebecca Littleton can never look like a fool, Madam," cried Sir George, with vehemence, "and [s]ince you per[s]i[s]t in [s]ending for her, you will excu[s]e me if I do not [s]tay to [s]ee Lady O[s][s]iter render her[s]elf ridiculous, by in[s]ulting a woman every way her [s]uperior, but in the paltry di[s]tinction of fortune." He then left the room, [s]hutting the door after him with violence, and in a few moments Rebecca entered. How great was the [s]urpri[s]e of Lord O[s][s]iter when he beheld the [s]trikingly beautiful figure that pre[s]ented itself to his view! Mode[s]ty had recalled to her cheeks the ro[s]y hue which grief had chaced from them. Her fine eyes were timidly rai[s]ed from the ground to her Lady's face, while, with a gentle inclination of the body, and a voice of [s]ofte[s]t harmony, [s]he reque[s]ted to know her commands. "Nothing particular, child; only I was montioning to my brother the [s]ituation I had offered you in my family, and he thinks you will not be [s]atisfied with it." "Indeed, Madam, I am greatly obliged to Sir George for his [s]olicitude, but mu[s]t reque[s]t your Ladyship to inform him that while I can be [s]o fortunate as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] to obtain your approbation, I [s]hall never be otherwi[s]e than happy, and [s]hall deem my[s]elf highly honoured by your protection as long as your Lady[s]hip [s]hall think fit to extend it towards me." "Perhaps you would like to tell him [s]o your[s]elf, child?" "By no means, Madam." "But you are quite [s]atisfied, Rebecca?" "Intirely [s]o, my Lady, and that [s]atisfaction will ever remain uninterrupted, while I am con[s]cious of performing my duty." "Well, that's all," cried her Lady[s]hip, in a half peevi[s]h accent. Rebecca court[s]eyed, and retired. "Well, and what do you think of her, my Lord," cried the Lady, turning to her hu[s]band; "why you [s]eem in amaze!" "I am perfectly [s]o, my dear (endeavouring to recollect him[s]elf;) but it is becau[s]e I can't, for my [s]oul, conceive what George can [s]ee in this girl to make [s]uch a fu[s]s about her." "Why, don't you think her hand[s]ome?" "No woman appears [s]o in my eyes when your Ladyship is by." "Oh! you're va[s]tly civil this morning; but, pray what fault have you to find with her per[s]on?" "Nay, nothing particular; but I think [s]he is altogether in[s]ipid." "She is very fair." "Yes, but I was never [s]truck with your very fair women; they have not half the expre[s][s]ion of your fine brunettes." Lady O[s][s]iter was a very dark woman, and could not help at that moment going to the gla[s]s to adju[s]t her handkerchief. "She has very fine eyes, my Lord." "Fine eyes, oh! ridiculous; you may as well admire the blue gla[s]s beads [s]tuck in the head of a wax doll. I don't [s]ee any thing about her even tolerably pretty but her neck and [s]houlders; they [s]eem [s]haped well enough." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] "This horrid mourning makes one look like a fright," cried the Lady, [s]till looking in the gla[s]s, "and they have made my gown [s]o abominably high, I declare I appear quite round [s]houldered; it [s]hall po[s]itively be altered before I wear it again." "Not if I might advi[s]e, my dear; for I declare I never [s]aw you look better than you do this morning; and, in my opinion, women inclined to em bon point have more dignity in their per[s]ons than the very slender; for in[s]tance, now your Rebecca; [s]he will always remind me of Death and Daphne." "Dear, my Lord, when have I [s]een you in [s]o agreeable a humour? I declare you are quite witty." "How can I be otherwi[s]e, my Lady, when I have [s]o good a [s]ubject for ridicule?" Her Lady[s]hip did not take the keenne[s]s of the sarcasm, and retired, to give [s]ome orders to her woman, perfectly [s]atisfied that Rebecca was infinitely inferior to her[s]elf in per[s]onal attractions; while her artful hu[s]band applauded him[s]elf for the part he had acted, which he naturally imagined would [s]ecure, within the reach of his power, a woman who[s]e charms had made [s]uch an impre[s][s]ion on his mind, that he was re[s]olved, if po[s][s]ible, to [s]acrifice her a victim to [s]eduction. THE WOMAN OF HONOUR. When Sir George left the parlour, he retired to his own apartment, and calling for pen and ink, addre[s][s]ed the following letter to Rebecca: - "With a heart fully [s]en[s]ible of the merit of the object I pre[s]ume to addre[s]s, how is it po[s][s]ible but I mu[s]t al[s]o be [s]en[s]ible of the fear of offending her? pardon me, dear young Lady, if almo[s]t unacquainted with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] thou[s]and little delicacies expected by your [s]ex from tho[s]e of ours, who venture to offer their friend[s]hip and a[s][s]i[s]tance to innocence and beauty; pardon me, I [s]ay, if my expre[s][s]ions are not [s]ufficiently denotive of my respect and e[s]teem, while I venture to a[s]k if the [s]ituation my [s]i[s]ter offers you is perfectly con[s]onant with your expectations and wi[s]hes; yet I ought to know the modesty, the humility of your mind, will lead you to tell me it is. "But, alas! I too well know the di[s]po[s]ition of Lady O[s][s]iter to imagine a heart, like your's, replete with [s]en[s]ibility, can enjoy any tolerable degree of tranquillity, when [s]ubject to her caprice and ill humour: I mu[s]t therefore entreat my lovely friend to accept not from me, but as a legacy from my mother (for I am [s]en[s]ible [s]he de[s]igned it, though the [s]udden [s]troke that deprived us of her prevented her putting her de[s]igns in execution) the enclo[s]ed two thou[s]and pounds, which will, at lea[s]t, place you above dependance on the weak and unworthy. "Permit me al[s]o to a[s][s]ure you, dear amiable Mi[s]s Littleton, that, in every future period of my life, I [s]hall be happy to convince you how much I am intere[s]ted in your welfare, and that nothing would give me more [s]incere plea[s]ure, than being allowed to devote my life and fortune to the promotion of your felicity. "I am, with every token of e[s]teem and re[s]pect, your friend, GEORGE WORTHY." Rebecca could not read this letter without emotion; yet did [s]he not he[s]itate what an[s]wer to return; the letter it[s]elf [s]he carefully locked up in her cabinet, but the bank-bills [s]he [s]ealed up in the following note: - "Rebecca Littleton returns her mo[s]t grateful acknowledgments to Sir George Worthy for the kind solicitude he evinces for her happine[s]s. She begs leave to return his noble pre[s]ent, which [s]he cannot think of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] accepting, as it would lay her under an obligation too oppre[s][s]ive to a [s]pirit which Sir George is mi[s]taken in thinking humble. Rebecca feels her[s]elf highly satisfied in the protection of Lady O[s][s]iter, and, though [s]he feels grateful for the offered friend[s]hip of the [s]on of her ever-lamented benefactre[s]s, [s]he mu[s]t beg leave to decline it, as the va[s]t di[s]tance fortune has placed between them renders it impo[s][s]ible to cultivate true friendship, which can only [s]ub[s]i[s]t between per[s]ons on an equality with each other. Rebecca wi[s]hes to be retained in the memory of Sir George only as the [s]ervant of his [s]i[s]ter, and, at the [s]ame time, a[s][s]ures him, the [s]on of Lady Mary Worthy will ever be retained in her mind with [s]ervent wi[s]hes for his happine[s]s." When [s]he had [s]ent away this note, [s]he again read over Sir George's letter; a tear, almo[s]t unknown to her[s]elf, fell on it as [s]he peru[s]ed with attention his offers of friend[s]hip: but [s]he [s]oon recollected her[s]elf, ha[s]tily bru[s]hed away the token of her weakne[s]s, and, returning the letter to her cabinet, began to prepare for her removal to town, whither Lady O[s][s]iter intended returning the next day. TRIAL OF THE HEART. " What a noble mind is here di[s]played!" [s]aid Sir George, as he read Rebecca's note. "How much does this woman's [s]entiments elevate her above the [s]tation in which Providence has placed her! I fear my letter was not dictated with [s]ufficient delicacy; her pride has taken the alarm, that laudible pride that is a woman's be[s]t [s]afeguard: but no matter, I will not write again, but wait till I can di[s]cover in what manner my [s]i[s]ter behaves to her. When [s]he has tried her new [s]ituation, [s]he may not find it [s]o ea[s]y as her little knowledge of the world at pre[s]ent leads her to imagine. When [s]he finds her[s]elf uncomfortable, then, perhaps, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] the offer of friend[s]hip from me will be more acceptable." In the evening Sir George, having no inclination to join the in[s]ipid chat of Lord and Lady O[s][s]iter, pleaded letters to write, and went to the library to look for a book that might afford him an hour's rational amusement. As he entered the room, he [s]aw Rebecca bu[s]ily employed in retouching a [s]mall drawing that lay before her, and he ob[s]erved, that [s]he frequently looked at a portrait of his mother that hung over the chimney." "I di[s]turb you, I fear, Mi[s]s Littleton." "By no means, Sir," cried Rebecca, ri[s]ing, vi[s]ibly embarra[s][s]ed; "I was ju[s]t going. Indeed, my being here is an intru[s]ion, I mu[s]t entreat you to pardon." "I [s]hall be extremely [s]orry if Mi[s]s Littleton considered her[s]elf as an intruder in any apartment in this hou[s]e. You were drawing; will you permit me to [s]ee your performance?" "You will [s]mile at my pre[s]umption, Sir; but I have been endeavouring to catch [s]ome faint re[s]emblance of my regretted Lady, that [s]hould any thing [s]eparate me from her daughter's [s]ervice, I might have it in my power [s]ometimes to gaze on her beloved features and weep." "You have been happy in pre[s]erving the likene[s]s; but, I think, I have a miniature of my mother, the mo[s]t [s]triking thing of the kind I ever [s]aw." He then drew from his pocket a [s]mall ca[s]e, which contained Lady Mary's picture, elegantly [s]et with brilliants, intermixed with pearls. It had been [s]et as a pre[s]ent for Lady O[s][s]iter; but as that Lady knew not of her brother's de[s]ign, he thought he might now di[s]po[s]e of it more to his own [s]atisfaction. "Will Mi[s]s Littleton honour me [s]o far," [s]aid he, taking it from the ca[s]e, "as to wear this picture for the [s]ake of her who[s]e re[s]emblance it bears?" "The picture of it[s]elf, Sir George, would be to me an invaluable treature; but its ornaments are [s]o [s]uperb and co[s]tly, you will pardon me if I decline the acceptance of it." "Why will you mortify me by this refu[s]al? You treat me very unkindly, Mi[s]s Littleton, [s]ince even my mother's picture is not acceptable from my hands!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] "Indeed, Sir, you are mi[s]taken, and, to convince you I am not ungrateful, was that picture devi[s]ted of its rich ornaments, I would accept it cheerfully, and wear it, not only for her [s]ake, but your own." "Charming, engaging woman! exclaimed he, catching her hand, "why are you thus irre[s]i[s]tibly lovely, and yet refu[s]e me the [s]atisfaction of placing you above the malice of fortune?" She blu[s]hed carnation deep, as [s]he attempted to withdraw her hand; but a [s]mile dimpled on her cheek, and her heart peeped forth from her tell-tale eyes. "You make me [s]mile," [s]aid [s]he, "to hear you talk of the malice of fortune. We, who are born in an humble [s]tation, cannot feel the want of luxuries which we never enjoyed. Happine[s]s is not always annexed to wealth, or mi[s]ery to poverty. We are all poor or rich by compari[s]on, and my [s]ituation, which to you is an object of compa[s][s]ion, would be to thou[s]ands the summit of felicity; but your conde[s]cen[s]ion makes me forget my[s]elf: I wi[s]h you a good night." "Stay one moment adorable Rebecca, cried Sir George, [s]topping her as [s]he was about to leave the room. "Hear me, I entreat you, with attention; by heavens, you [s]hall never go into the [s]ervice of Lady O[s][s]iter, nor into any [s]ervice. I am your [s]lave; my life, my forune, all are your's. I love you more than exi[s]tence it[s]elf. I mean not to offend your delicacy. My de[s]igns are of the mo[s]t honourable nature. Name your own time, I will wait with patience. Only [s]uffer me to tell my [s]i[s]ter, that the woman whom I a[s]pire to the honour of making my wife, mu[s]t henceforth be treated with that re[s]pect her worth and virtue demands." "Hold, hold, dear Sir George," cried Rebecca, pale and trembling, "I mu[s]t hear no more. You honour me, highly honour me by the[s]e profe[s][s]ions of regard; but you talk of impo[s][s]ibilities. The humble Rebecca Littleton, however [s]en[s]ible of your merits, can never be your wife; in[s]urmountable ob[s]tacles are placed between us." "If your bo[s]om, lovely Rebecca, glows with sensibility, every ob[s]tacle is ea[s]ily removed." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] "Do not interrupt me," [s]aid [s]he. "The ob[s]tacles I [s]peak of can never be removed; my vows are already pledged; they are regi[s]tered in heaven; 'tis [s]acrilege to li[s]ten to your declaration." Sir George dropped her hand, and, with a look of mingled horror and [s]urpri[s]e, cried, "Are you already married?" "No," replied [s]he, faintly, "not married." "Then you [s]port with my mi[s]ery, cruel, cruel girl!" "Alas!" [s]aid Rebecca, with a look of tenderne[s]s, "heaven knows I do not. I would give worlds, did I po[s][s]e[s]s them, to [s]ave you from one hour's angui[s]h; but, ah! Sir George, mine is a wayward fate; my bo[s]om is heavy laden with [s]orrow. Ah! do not increase that [s]orrow by letting me [s]ee you partake it." "Then," cried he, [s]tarting from his [s]eat, "then you do not hate me?" "Hate you, oh! no, that were impo[s][s]ible." "Then we may yet be happy," [s]aid he, catching her in his arms. Rebecca's heart had almo[s]t betrayed her; but [s]he was [s]en[s]ible this mu[s]t be the moment of victory. She pu[s]hed him from her, and a[s][s]uming an air of re[s]erve, "Sir George," [s]aid [s]he, "if you wi[s]h my happine[s]s, there is but one way by which you can promote it, that is, by never more [s]peaking to me on this [s]ubject; my fate is irrevocably fixed; cea[s]e then to di[s]turb my felicity by endeavouring to awaken my [s]en[s]ibility. You, Sir George, are de[s]igned by heaven to move in an exalted [s]tation. You have many duties to fulfil, which it will be almo[s]t criminal to neglect. For me, unknowing and unknown by the world, if I can but pa[s]s through life blamele[s]s, my utmo[s]t wi[s]h is gratified." "Will you then leave me? [s]aid he, "and leave me devoid of hope?" "No, Sir, I will endeavour to cheer your bo[s]om with the [s]ame hope that animates mine. I hope, sincerely, you will [s]oon meet a woman your equal, in birth, fortune, and merit, who will obliterate from your mind all traces of Rebecca; and may you, united by the mo[s]t [s]acred ties, enjoy in her [s]ociety every blessing that heaven can be[s]tow, or you de[s]ire."

"Ah!" cried Rebecca, forcing a [s]mile, "you talk wildly; we [s]hall hear you tell a different tale [s]hortly." "But will you not accept the picture as a token of my e[s]teem?" He held it towards her. She put his hand back, and [s]aid, in a tone of di[s]plea[s]ure, "I can accept no diamonds, Sir George, and, for heaven's [s]ake, detain me no longer here. I have acted very improperly in talking with you [s]o long; but I will take care this [s]hall be our la[s]t interview." She then court[s]eyed [s]lightly, and retired to her apartment, where con[s]cious rectitude alone alleviated the pangs of di[s]appointed love. "Yes," [s]aid [s]he, "I have done right; an union with Sir George would by no means [s]ecure me permanent felicity; he is young, volatile, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of violent pa[s][s]ions. Alas! when the novelty of my per[s]on was worn off, I might cea[s]e to charm, and how could I endure his neglect? be[s]ides, how ill could my heart bear that he [s]hould be [s]ubject to the [s]neers of his acquaintance on my account. Oh! my dear Lady Mary, you knew what was be[s]t for me, and never will I forget your injunctions." SERVITUDE. And pray, what do think of my Lady? [s]aid Mrs. Lappett to Rebecca, the evening of her arrival in Bedford-Square. Lappett was an experienced Abigail. She had lived with Lady O[s][s]iter from the time of her marriage, and not, without envy, beheld Rebecca introduced into the family, as [s]he feared [s]he might have a gown or two the le[s]s in a year, or, perhaps, Rebecca might [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] [s]upplant her intirely. This jealou[s]y made her re[s]olve to cultivate an intimacy with the un[s]u[s]pecting girl, and be the mo[s]t forward in [s]howing her civilities, that [s]he might win her confidence, draw from her her real opinion concerning her Lady, and then betray her. Lappett, when [s]he had any favourite point to gain, could a[s][s]ume a mo[s]t in[s]inuating manner. The words that fell from her tongue were [s]mooth, and plea[s]ant as the river's [s]urface unruffled by a breeze: but like that, when the whirlwind of pa[s][s]ion aro[s]e, di[s]played the mo[s]t frightful contra[s]t. "And what do you think of my Lady?" [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he was taking her tea in Rebecca's apartment. "I hardly know what to think yet," replied Rebecca. "I never judge very ha[s]tily. She appears extremely good natured." "Ah! my dear, you will know her better by and bye; there is a deal of difference between old [s]ervants and new ones." "I [s]hould be much obliged to you, Mrs. Lappett to give me [s]ome little idea of the be[s]t method to obtain her approbation." "Indeed, that is more than is in my power, child, for what plea[s]es to-day may di[s]plea[s]e to-morrow: I never give my[s]elf much trouble about it. How do you like the children?" "They are very fine boys; but I am mo[s]t plea[s]ed with Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter; [s]he [s]eems extremely mild and engaging." "Well, you are the fir[s]t per[s]on I ever heard [s]ay they liked her be[s]t. My lady can't bear her; [s]he [s]ays [s]he is [s]o [s]tupid---." "I think it is very wrong," [s]aid Rebecca, in the [s]implicity of her heart, "for mothers to make any di[s]tinction in their regard for their children; and I [s]hall con[s]ider my[s]elf doubly obliged to be kind and affectionate to Mi[s]s, if her mamma is unkind to her." "It [s]hows the goodne[s]s of your heart, my dear ma'am," [s]aid Lappett, beginning to [s]ee a little into the di[s]po[s]ition of our heroine. "But, pray, have you [s]een my Lord yet?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] "Yes, once at Twickenham." "Well, don't you think him a va[s]t hand[s]ome man?" "He is well enough," [s]aid Rebecca, carele[s]sly; "but Sir George Worthy is, in my opinion, a great deal hand[s]omer." "Lord O[s][s]iter is a man of gallantry, though, I a[s][s]ure you, I mu[s]t tell you, but it is between our[s]elves, he once made propo[s]als to me." "Indeed! Well, I think, you were right to refu[s]e him; di[s]proportionate marriages are [s]eldom happy." "Oh! Lord, my dear, it was not for marriage, I a[s][s]ure you; it was [s]ince I lived with my Lady." "Good heaven!" cried Rebecca, with a look of [s]urpri[s]e, "what [s]ince he has been married?" "Yes; but I would not have you mention it; he offered me three hundred a year." "And how could you remain in the family after [s]uch an affront, Mrs. Lappett?" "Why, I thought it was a pity to lo[s]e my place, [s]o I kept my gentleman at a proper di[s]tance, and he dropped the pur[s]uit: but come, ma'am, let us hurry the nur[s]ery maid to put Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter and the young gentlemen to bed, and then we will go down and take a game at cards in the hou[s]ekeeper's room." "You will excu[s]e me, Mrs. Lappett: I never played a game at cards in my life; be[s]ides, my Lady has given me [s]ome mu[s]lin to [s]pot, and I mu[s]t [s]et about it." "Lord! child, you'll have enough to do if you humour her by working of an evening." "It is my duty to do all that is in my power, and I had rather work than [s]it [s]till." "Well, then, bring down your work, you will be moped to death [s]itting here by your[s]elf." "Oh! dear, no, I [s]hall not: I am never lonely. I work very fa[s]t, and when I have done a good bit I can take up a book and read. I would rather not go down, if you will excu[s]e me." "Ju[s]t as you plea[s]e, ma'am," [s]aid Lappett; "we [s]hall be glad of your company, but if you prefer being alone ---." She court[s]eyed, ironically to[s][s]ed her head, and left [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] Rebecca to the enjoyment of her own reflexions, while [s]he entertained her fellow [s]ervants with the pride, conceit, and ignorance of the new comer. "I tried to get her down among[s]t us, that we might have a little fun with her," [s]aid [s]he, "for you would laugh to hear how fooli[s]hly [s]he talks. She will not [s]tay here long, take my word for it." At lea[s]t Mrs. Lappett had re[s]olved, in her own mind, to u[s]e every exertion to di[s]place Rebecca from a family where, [s]he was fearful, her beauty, innocence and worth, would attract the notice of one, who[s]e devoirs [s]he considered as entirely due to her[s]elf. For, to own the truth, Mrs. Lappett had not been quite [s]o deaf to the propo[s]als of her Lord as [s]he had represented to Rebecca, though [s]he rather made a mistake in [s]aying his Lord[s]hip had offered a [s]ettlement, that being a mea[s]ure earne[s]tly de[s]ired by her[s]elf, but which [s]he could find no means to bring Lord O[s][s]iter into: indeed, he had found her too ea[s]y a conque[s]ty to indulge a thought of putting him[s]elf to much expence or trouble on her account. The next morning, when Lady O[s][s]iter had breakfasted, [s]he went immediately to the nur[s]ery, a thing [s]he had not been known to do for many months before; but Rebecca was a novelty, and therefore demanded from her Lady [s]ome little attention; as Rebecca had been told that her Lady [s]eldom, if ever, came into the children's apartment, the vi[s]it was intirely unexpected, and Lady O[s][s]iter, found her bu[s]ily employed in arranging [s]ome pencils and crayons in a [s]mall, but elegant, drawing box, which had been given her by her late benefactre[s]s. She aro[s]e, and apologized for the confu[s]ion her drawings, &c. which had fallen on the floor, had made in the apartment; "had I known your Lady[s]hip intended this honour,"--- "Oh! never mind, child," cried the Lady, with a look of infinite good humour, which no woman knew better how to a[s][s]ume than Lady O[s][s]iter; "I did not come to di[s]turb you, but I thought I [s]hould like you to hear the children read." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] "Have they ever been taught their letters, Madam?" "Why, upon my word, I cannot tell: I believe Charles can tell them when he [s]ees them: I have tried him [s]ometimes by taking up the news-paper when he was in the room; but I do not believe Lucy or James know any thing about it; but call them in, and let us [s]ee what they can do." Rebecca, who had about two hours before [s]een them all neatly dre[s][s]ed, and given them their breakfa[s]t, opened the adjoining room to call them, when how great was her [s]urpri[s]e when [s]he [s]aw the elde[s]t boy, who was eight years old, with two or three colour-[s]hells before him, [s]everal bru[s]hes, and a ba[s]on of water, with which he had not been [s]atisfied to daub [s]everal [s]heets of paper, and his own clothes, but al[s]o his brother and [s]i[s]ter's hands, faces, and frocks! Infinitely chagrined that they [s]hould be [s]een by their mother in [s]uch a condition, [s]he turned mildly towards the nur[s]ery maid, and a[s]ked "how [s]he could be [s]o neglectful as not to mind what the children were doing?" "Mind them your[s]elf, ma'am," was the an[s]wer: "I thought you came here to help me, not to command me." "I [s]hall for the future mind them," [s]aid Rebecca, attempting to take the bru[s]hes from Ma[s]ter O[s][s]iter. "You [s]hall not have them," [s]creamed he: "I will paint when I plea[s]e; mamma [s]ays I [s]hall." Rebecca per[s]i[s]ted in removing from his reach the [s]hells and water, when [s]etting up a [s]cream like a bed-lamite, he threw one, which he had retained in his hand, full in her face! "What is the matter?" cried Lady O[s][s]iter, opening the door. "Come hither, Charles; what do they do to you, my love?" "She will not let me play. She has taken away my paints, and will not let me do any thing." "But [s]he [s]hall let you do as you plea[s]e," [s]aid the mother, ki[s][s]ing him, "[s]o do not cry." At that moment another [s]cream, from the inner apartment, vibrated in her Lady[s]hip's ears, and Ma[s]ter James and Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter came bellowing into the room, that "the new maid would wa[s]h their faces." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] "Heaven [s]ave me," [s]aid the Lady, "from often vi[s]iting the nur[s]ery! You are enough to drive one mad. I had hoped, indeed, that you, Rebecca, would have managed them better than to have had all this uproar; but I [s]ee [s]ervants are all alike; they have no more notion of the management of children than natural fools: why, I will an[s]wer for it, if I had time, I could make the[s]e children do ju[s]t as I plea[s]e, without any of this roaring. Do not you think, Charles, you would always mind me?" "Oh! yes, mamma; you never contradict me, but give me every thing I want." "Well, go, my dear, go to Rebecca and have your face wa[s]hed, and you [s]hall go out in the coach, and buy [s]ome more paints. Do, child, put James and Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter on clean frocks, and get your[s]elf ready to go out with them. I will hear them read another time; poor dears, they have been vexed enough this morning:" then taking her favourite's hand, to lead him out of the room, [s]he [s]topped, and picked up two or three of Rebecca's drawings.---"Here, my love," [s]aid [s]he, "a[s]k your maid to give you the[s]e pretty pictures." Rebecca was too meek to contradict, and he marched off with her two be[s]t performances in his hand. In about ten minutes a footman tapped at the door, to inform Rebecca that the chariot waited, and that [s]he mu[s]t go to her Lady's dre[s][s]ing-room for Ma[s]ter O[s][s]iter. Rebecca, who had been accu[s]tomed to peace and regularity, was di[s]tracted by the hurry and confu[s]ion [s]he had been thrown into; but flattering her[s]elf it would be better next day, [s]he made all the ha[s]te [s]he could, and repaired to the dre[s][s]ing-room, where, on a [s]ofa, be[s]ide his mamma, [s]at the delectable Ma[s]ter Ossiter, with a pair of gold-bowed [s]ci[s][s]ars, cutting the hou[s]es, trees, and figures, from her drawings, which her Lady[s]hip was amu[s]ing her[s]elf by placing in a kind of fanta[s]tic medley on the table before her. "See, Rebecca," cried [s]he, we have di[s]patched the[s]e pretty pictures, I dare [s]ay, a deal quicker than you made them." Rebecca [s]miled faintly; but [s]he felt a cold chill [s]trike [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] to her heart. "Alas! Lady Mary would not have done [s]o, [s]ighed [s]he, [s]oftly, as [s]he followed the children down [s]tairs, and a tear [s]tarted in her eye, which [s]he was unable to [s]uppre[s]s. "Drive to the toy-[s]hop," [s]aid Ma[s]ter O[s][s]iter, as the man [s]hut the chariot-door, "and [s]ee what mamma has given me," continued he, pulling half a guinea from his pocket, and [s]howing it to his brother and sister: "and I am to lay it out ju[s]t as I plea[s]e." As the chariot [s]topped at the [s]hop door, a poor man, pale and emaciated, with but one leg, took off his hat, bowed, but did not [s]peak. "Look at that poor man, my dear," [s]aid Rebecca; "he would be very thankful for a [s]mall part of your money; [s]uppo[s]e you was to give him a [s]hilling?" "What [s]hould I give him a [s]hilling for?" [s]aid the child. "Becau[s]e he is in great di[s]tre[s]s; [s]ee how pale he looks, and what a thin ragged coat he has on this cold day!" "Well, what is that to me?" "Suppo[s]e, Ma[s]ter O[s][s]iter, you were cold and hungry?" "That you know is impo[s][s]ible." "Impo[s][s]ible! Sir." "Yes, to be [s]ure; a'nt I a Lord's [s]on, and [s]hall not I be a Lord my[s]elf, if I live long enough? and, you know, Lords are never poor." "Then is it the more their duty to relieve tho[s]e that are." "Duty!" [s]aid he, [s]taring in her face; "mamma never gives any thing to poor folks; [s]he [s]ays they [s]hould be all [s]ent to pri[s]on, and made work." This dialogue had pa[s][s]ed in the [s]hop, and the miserable [s]ubject of it [s]till was at the door. Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter put her little hand in[s]tinctively into her pocket. "If I had any money; but mamma don't very often give me any." Then approaching Rebecca, in a kind of half whi[s]per, "If you, ma'am, will give the poor man half a crown, I will a[s]k my uncle for one to pay you with the fir[s]t time I [s]ee him." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] Rebecca gazed on the child as [s]he was [s]peaking, and [s]he fancied [s]he beheld her grandmother's benevolence play about her infant countenance.---She caught her in her arms, gave the de[s]ired half crown, and joy for a moment animated her bo[s]om, when [s]he beheld both the beggar and his little benefactre[s]s look equally happy. MODERN MANNERS. A Few days after this Lady O[s][s]iter [s]ent for Rebecca, in ha[s]te, to her dre[s][s]ing-room. "You [s]eem to have [s]ome ta[s]te for drawing child," [s]aid [s]he, "pray can you paint flowers." "A little, madam." "Well, now I want you to do [s]omething for me; I la[s]t night [s]aw the mo[s]t beautiful painted trimming, and I'll take you to a [s]hop this morning where you [s]hall [s]ee [s]ome like it; if you think you can do it, I [s]hall be va[s]tly plea[s]ed, for there is a ball next week." "But your lady[s]hip is in mourning," [s]aid Rebecca, blu[s]hing for her lady's folly. "Oh, la! well, I prote[s]t I forgot that, but now, I dare [s]ay you could fancy me [s]omething pretty in black and white; do try child: I [s]hall change my mourning in about a month, and I think you can do it in that time." "If I knew what would plea[s]e your Lady[s]hip." "Do it according to your own ta[s]te, Rebecca, and I am [s]ure it will be pretty." The good natured Rebecca was willing to plea[s]e to the utmo[s]t of her power, but, alas, that power was far from adequate to the many ta[s]ks impo[s]ed upon her. Mrs. Lappett was a great favourite, therefore often a[s]ked leave to go out, and then Rebecca was [s]ummoned to attend the toilette of her lady, and indeed her ta[s]te and judgment in the arrangement of female ornaments [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] was [s]o elegant, that Lady O[s][s]iter never appeared to greater advantage than when dre[s][s]ed by her hands. Then was a morning cap to be made, or a dre[s]s fre[s]h trimmed, they were all brought to Rebecca; and did her Lady[s]hip ever a[s]k for any thing that was not ready, the an[s]wer was, indeed, my Lady, I gave it to Rebecca, two or three days ago, but [s]he is [s]uch a fine lady, and [s]pends [s]o much time at her book and her music. In the mean time our fair heroine was [s]acrificing her health to the vain hope of obtaining the approbation of her lady, [s]he had not a moment for the mo[s]t trifling relaxation; obliged to ri[s]e early, on account of the children, for the very nur[s]ery maid impo[s]ed upon her good nature, and left her entirely to dre[s]s and undre[s]s them. Mrs. Lappett would, if in the lea[s]t indi[s]po[s]ed, retire to re[s]t, and leave Rebecca to [s]it up for her lady, who was addicted to the fa[s]hionable vice of gaming, and often was from home till four, five, nay [s]ometimes fix o'clock in the morning; and when [s]he had ill luck, would return in the mo[s]t diabolical humour, and vent that [s]pleen which politene[s]s obliged her to conceal in company, on her meek unoffending attendant; indeed to [s]uch height did [s]he often [s]uffer her pa[s][s]ion to ri[s]e, that Rebecca, on hearing the knocker announce her arrival, would fall into [s]uch a fit of trembling, that [s]he was [s]carcely able to [s]tand, while [s]he undre[s][s]ed her. But the reader mu[s]t not [s]uppo[s]e that, during this period, either Sir George or Lord O[s][s]iter had forgot her; the former had written her [s]everal letters, which [s]he returned unopened; for, [s]aid [s]he, con[s]cious as I am of my own weakne[s]s, why [s]hould I wilfully expo[s]e it to trials it may not be able to with[s]tand. At length, wearied out with her inflexible re[s]olution, he determined to take a trip to the continent, and endeavour to bani[s]h her from his thoughts; but before he went, he determined at lea[s]t to put it in her power to leave his [s]i[s]ter whenever her [s]ituation became painful, without being obliged to have recour[s]e to [s]ervitude again. And Mrs. Harley was the per[s]on he determined to employ on this occa[s]ion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] Lord O[s][s]iter had made frequent attempts to [s]ee and conver[s]e with Rebecca, but [s]he was [s]o much in the apartment with the children, or in her lady's dre[s][s]ing room, with Lappett, that he found it more difficult than he at fir[s]t imagined, and he was too cautious in his affairs of gallantry to u[s]e pen and paper. Lord and Lady O[s][s]iter were a very fa[s]hionable couple; they had married without affection, becau[s]e their friends thought they were exactly [s]uitable for each other in birth and fortune; his Lord[s]hip had always kept up a [s]how of politene[s]s towards his wife, [s]eldom contradicted her or complained of her expences, though in his heart he de[s]pi[s]ed her pride and affectation, and laughed at her ab[s]urdity. He knew her well enough, to be certain his honour was perfectly [s]afe in her keeping, not from a conviction of her principles being ju[s]t or her virtue impregnable, but he was fully [s]en[s]ible that [s]elf-love was her prevalent pa[s][s]ion, and though [s]he was distractedly fond of admiration, her heart was animated by none of tho[s]e [s]en[s]ibilities which, though they in general elevate the female mind, not unfrequently lay it open to the greate[s]t errors. One morning, as Rebecca was intently engaged in completing the trimming we have mentioned, Mrs. Harley unexpectedly entered the room. A faint gleam of plea[s]ure animated the countenance, and beamed from the eyes of Rebecca, as [s]he aro[s]e to receive this faithful [s]ervant of Lady Mary's. "Mrs. Harley," [s]aid [s]he, taking her cordially by the hand, "to what am I to attribute this unexpected plea[s]ure." Struck with her palid cheeks and altered air, Harley fir[s]t bru[s]hed off a [s]tarting tear and then di[s]clo[s]ed her errand--- "I come, my dear Mi[s]s, from my good young ma[s]ter---" "If to bring me a letter," [s]aid Rebecca, interrupting her, "I mu[s]t beg you to excu[s]e me---" "My dear child," [s]aid Harley, "don't fly out in this manner, but li[s]ten to me attentively; I have children of my own, Mi[s]s Littleton, and heaven forbid I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] [s]hould ever advi[s]e a young innocent creature to a wrong [s]tep; tru[s]t me, I am actuated only by friend[s]hip, when I entreat you to inform me what motives you have for thus ob[s]tinately refu[s]ing the offers of a man of rank and fortune, who loves you honourably and [s]incerely." "Do not a[s]k me, dear Harley; do not let us talk on this [s]ubject." "We will talk on no other then, for [s]ure I am there mu[s]t be [s]ome powerful rea[s]on for your conduct. Is your heart otherways engaged? Does want of fortune prevent your happine[s]s?" "Ah, no! no! my friend," cried Rebecca, her head falling on Harley's [s]houlder, and her eyes filling with tears; I am unhappy becau[s]e I am not insensible." "You talk in riddles, my dear; if you are not insensible---" "Oh, [s]top! [s]top! you mu[s]t [s]ay no more, unle[s]s you mean to break my heart; for, alas, Harley, the la[s]t time I [s]aw my dear departed Lady Mary, I promised her, [s]olemnly promi[s]ed her, by every hope of [s]elicity, never to li[s]ten to an overture of love from Sir George; and never, no never, while I retain the lea[s]t remembrance of what is pa[s]t, will I break a vow [s]o [s]olemnly given." "This family pride," [s]aid Harley, "was the only foible my lady had." "She had no foible," [s]aid Rebecca; "it was a wi[s]h to in[s]ure my felicity alone, prompted the reque[s]t." "Whatever was her motive, my dear Mi[s]s, promi[s]es when once made [s]hould be [s]acredly ob[s]erved; I will therefore [s]ay no more to you on the [s]ubject: Sir George, [s]ince [s]atisfied you will not accept his offers, is re[s]olved next Monday to leave England." Rebecca turned pale, and Harley continued. "He means to [s]pend the winter on the continent, but has de[s]ired you will accept his mother's picture, which he has had fre[s]h [s]et on purpo[s]e for you, and this trifle, laying a bank note for five hundred pounds on the table. Now I will have no qualms and [s]queami[s]h non[s]en[s]e, Mi[s]s Littleton; I am certain my lady meant [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] to have provided for you---more [s]hame for [s]ome folks that they forget her la[s]t commands; but we cannot always make people do as they ought. Now, you mu[s]t take this money, and con[s]ider it as her beque[s]t. I am [s]ure you will find it nece[s][s]ary very [s]oon to quit this family; your dear pale cheeks and heavy eyes tell me you [s]hould at this moment be in your bed, rather than at work." She then drew out the picture, which was only [s]et in plain gold. Rebecca took it, pre[s][s]ed it to her lips, and, tying the ribbon that was fixed to it round her neck, placed it as a [s]acred depo[s]it in her bo[s]om. She al[s]o took the bank note and put it in her pocket book, but [s]ecretly re[s]olved that nothing but the [s]ever[s]t nece[s][s]ity [s]hould tempt her to break into it. When Monday arrived, Rebecca could not avoid approaching the window at the [s]ound of every carriage that drew up to the door. "He will not [s]urely leave England," [s]aid [s]he, "without taking leave of his [s]i[s]ter." About two o'clock [s]he [s]aw his chariot draw up to the door, and, half concealing her[s]elf behind the window [s]hutter, gazed on him, and breathed a prayer for his felicity, as [s]he [s]aw him alight. In about half an hour [s]he was de[s]ired to bring Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter and Ma[s]ter James into the drawing-room. She took them to the door, opened it and put them in, but her feelings were too powerful to permit her to enter. "Ah, uncle," [s]aid Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter, running eagerly to Sir George, "I am glad you are come, I have been waiting for you this long, long time." "Well, my dear Lucy," [s]aid he, fondly taking her on his knee, "and what might make you wi[s]h to [s]ee me [s]o much." "Becau[s]e I love you dearly," [s]aid [s]he, throwing her little arms round his neck, "but that a'nt all." "No! what el[s]e was it then?" She lowered her voice, and, clapping her mouth clo[s]e to his ear, [s]aid, "I owe my maid half-a-crown, and I told her you would pay her." "Sir George was [s]urpri[s]ed. "And pray how does that happen?" [s]aid he. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] "Rebecca lent it me," [s]aid [s]he, [s]till lowering her voice, "to give a poor man." "Rebecca, what Rebecca?" [s]aid Sir George, a[s]toni[s]hed. "Why, Rebecca," replied the child; "my own maid Rebecca, that teaches me to read and [s]ay my prayers, and tells me if I am good I [s]hall go to heaven." "What [s]tuff is the child talking?" [s]aid Lady O[s][s]iter, catching the la[s]t word. Sir George was too much affected to [s]peak; he put a couple of guineas into Lucy's hand, and ha[s]tily ki[s][s]ing them all, hurried out of the hou[s]e; as he [s]eated him[s]elf in the chai[s]e, he ca[s]t his eyes towards the upper windows. Rebecca caught the glance; the impul[s]e was irre[s]i[s]tible; [s]he threw up the [s]a[s]h. Sir George ki[s][s]ed his hand, while his countenance betrayed the feelings of his [s]oul. Rebecca laid her's on her heart, then rai[s]ed them towards heaven, as [s]he would have [s]aid, "God ble[s]s you." "Drive on," [s]aid Sir George, and again bowing his head to hide his emotions from the [s]ervants, a moment conveyed him from her [s]ight. GALLANTRY, JEALOUSY, AND INTEGRITY. "I Do not think, my dear," [s]aid Lord O[s][s]iter, as he was taking his chocolate in his lady's dre[s][s]ing-room, one morning about a fortnight after Sir George's departure. "I do not think it will be in my power to join the intended party at Lady Rackett's to-night." "Some new engagement, my Lord," [s]aid her Ladyship, [s]miling affectedly. "Not a very agreeable one," he replied. "I am obliged to go into the City, on [s]ome infernal bu[s]ine[s]s with my banker: the[s]e monied men are the mo[s]t tire[s]ome animals in the creation. He [s]ays I have overdrawn him, and de[s]ires I will come and examine my accounts; it is a cur[s]ed [s]tupid affair, and I don't often concern my[s]elf about [s]uch things, but the fellow is [s]o pre[s][s]ing." "But perhaps you can get away in time to dre[s]s and join us, my Lord, before [s]upper." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] "I will, if po[s][s]ible, but I dare [s]ay the wretch will make me as [s]tupid as him[s]elf before I have done with his di[s]counts and intere[s]ts, [s]o I [s]hall be horrid bad company; therefore it is mo[s]t likely I [s]hall come home and go to bed." "To bed, my Lord," cried her Lady[s]hip, laughing; "why, [s]ure you are going to take pattern by the [s]ober cit." Though Lady O[s][s]iter pretended to de[s]ire her Lord's company, it was, in fact, the farthe[s]t thing from her wishes. She had for [s]ome time pa[s]t been admired and followed by the Duke of---; a conque[s]t [s]o brilliant and unexpected, was the highe[s]t gratification to this vain woman, and [s]he had heard with plea[s]ure her hu[s]band's intended appointment in the city, as [s]he was re[s]olved to [s]ee his Grace for half an hour at home, previous to their meeting at Lady Rackett's ball, where [s]he was engaged to dance with him. But Lord O[s][s]iter had frequently given her a few pretty plain hints in regard to her conduct with her noble admirer, and therefore, though [s]he had re[s]olved to [s]ee him, [s]he thought it would be be[s]t to do it privately, and Lappett being unfortunately gone to vi[s]it a [s]ick brother in the country, [s]he was obliged to make Rebecca her con[s]idante on the occa[s]ion, and immediately, on retiring from breakfast, [s]he [s]ummoned her to her dre[s][s]ing-room. "Rebecca, child," [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he entered, "I think I have not given you any thing [s]ince you have been with me, and you have done more than half of Lappett's bu[s]ine[s]s for her; there is that blue [s]atin gown and coat, you may take it, and as it is rather [s]oiled, here is [s]omething to pay for the dying and making up, pre[s]enting her with a couple of guineas. Do you know, child, (continued [s]he) I have taken the [s]trange[s]t whim in my head, and you mu[s]t lend me your a[s][s]i[s]tance. I think that trimming you made me extremely pretty, I dare [s]ay it will be greatly admired." "I am happy it plea[s]es you, Madam," [s]aid Rebecca: "but I thought you were [s]aying you would have it altered." "Oh, no, I was not [s]peaking of my dre[s]s then; I think nothing can be more elegant or better fancied, but you have a charming ta[s]te, that is certain. No, I was going to tell you of a [s]trange whim I had taken to play a trick with the old Duke of---; for, do you know Rebecca, the man makes downright love to me whenever he meets me, and the other day, when he was here, he left [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] behind him the[s]e [s]uperb bracelets. Now, I have a mind to mortify him, and as my Lord is going into the City, I will [s]end to the Duke to come here that I may have an opportunity to return his pre[s]ent and laugh at him." "Would it not be better to [s]end them to him," [s]aid Rebecca. "Oh, no, that will not do half [s]o well, for then, I [s]hould not have the [s]atisfaction of [s]eeing his chagrin, [s]o, Rebecca, you [s]hall take a note, which I will write, and [s]end it, unknown to any of the other [s]ervants, and when his grace comes he [s]hall come di[s]gui[s]ed, and pa[s]s for your brother, and you can bring him to my dre[s][s]ing-room." "Your Lady[s]hip will pardon me," [s]aid Rebecca, laying the two guineas on the table, "I am not fit to engage in [s]uch a [s]ervice; I would much rather decline it." "Decline it!" [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, reddening; "pray are you not my [s]ervant?" "Undoubtedly Madam." "And is it not your duty to obey my orders?" "When they are proper." "And pray are you to be the judge of what is proper or improper in my actions? "By no means; but your Lady[s]hip will allow me to judge of my own." "Oh, certainly Madam, if you are too [s]queami[s]h to enter into [s]o innocent a [s]cheme." "I make no doubt but your de[s]igns, Madam, are perfectly innocent, but where there is my[s]lery there is always room for [s]u[s]picion, and [s]hould my Lord di[s]cover it---" "But how can he, child, if you are di[s]creet." "I am determined to be [s]o, Madam, and hope you will pardon my temerity, if I humbly entreat you to drop this de[s]ign." "Prithee, good madam pert," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, [s]cornfully, "do not pretend to more delicacy and virtue than your betters. I have as high a regard for my honour as any woman can have, but I may indulge my[s]elf, I hope, in a little innocent gallantry for all that. Go; I [s]hell not want you till I dre[s]s." Rebecca retired, and for this once the pain her lady's anger gave her was more than counterbalanced by the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] reflexion that [s]he had acted right in rejecting the infamous [s]ervice [s]he would have employed her in. Contrary to her Lady's expectation, Rebecca had scarcely reached her own apartment when Lappett returned, and entered the dre[s][s]ing-room, to receive Lady O[s][s]iter's command. "Well, Lappett," [s]aid [s]he, "you are returned in very good time, for I have been [s]o gro[s]sly affronted by that little prude, Rebecca, that I can hardly contain my anger; do you know the impertinent creature had the audacity to refu[s]e getting me a note conveyed to the Duke of---; though I had conde[s]cended to inform her that my intentions were only to laugh at him. You know, Lappett, there is not a woman breathing would be more cautious than my[s]elf in doing any thing improper." "Dear, my Lady, I am [s]ure of that; nor is your Ladyship, by any means, obligated to enter into explanations with your [s]ervants, to [s]peak your command is always [s]ufficient cient to have them in[s]tantly obeyed." The ob[s]equious abigail took the note, conveyed it herself, and at eight o'clock in the evening his Grace was admitted to her Lady's dre[s][s]ing-room. Lady O[s][s]iter meant nothing le[s]s than to over-step the boundaries of di[s]cretion in this tete-a-tete . The Duke was to her an object of di[s]gu[s]t, but flattery was delightful to her ears, and pearls and diamonds were pretty ornaments in her opinion, ea[s]ily purcha[s]ed by a little conde[s]ension and [s]he flattered her[s]elf, that while [s]he remained virtuous in one great point, [s]he might indulge her[s]elf in every other imprudence, and de[s]y the cen[s]ures of the world. But it was the opinion of Rebecca, that every truly virtuous woman [s]hould carefully avoid even the appearance of indi[s]cretion, e[s]pecially tho[s]e who[s]e elevated [s]tations might render their examples infinitely pernicious to their inferiors: [s]he therefore felt her[s]elf greatly hurt by Lady Ossiter's want of prudence, and flattered her[s]elf the repul[s]e [s]he had met from her would prevent her making her de[s]igns known to any other [s]ervant, and [s]he readily imagined Mrs. Lappett would be as unwilling as her[s]elf to engage in the bu[s]ne[s]s; [s]o when informed [s]he was returned, Rebecca found her[s]elf [s]omewhat relieved, as [s]he knew [s]he [s]hould avoid the painful ta[s]k of dre[s][s]ing a woman whom [s]he feared [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-082A.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] The ob[s]equious abigail took the note, conveyed it herself, and at eight o'clock in the evening his Grace was admitted to her Lady's dre[s][s]ing-room.

While the Duke and her Lady[s]hip were together, the artful Lappett thought [s]he would ju[s]t [s]tep in and hear what Rebecca had to [s]ay on the [s]ubject, for, by her specious appearance of friend[s]hip, [s]he had [s]o won on the unsuspicious heart of our heroine, that [s]he never [s]crupled to communicate to her every thought as it aro[s]e, except tho[s]e which concerned Sir George, (and tho[s]e [s]he endeavoured to conceal, if po[s][s]ible, even from her[s]elf.) "So," cried Lappett, [s]itting down, "my Lady and you had a tiff to day, I find." "We did not quite agree," [s]aid Rebecca, [s]lightly, "but I dare [s]ay [s]he has forgot it by this time; I am [s]ure I do not wi[s]h to remember it." "I [s]uppose [s]he wanted you to get a letter conveyed to the Duke." "What then [s]he has told you her[s]elf, has [s]he?" "Oh, Yes, the moment I came in. I declare it is a pity my Lord is not acquainted with her conduct?" "It would be a cruel thing, Mrs. Lappett, to plant dissension between man and wife: be[s]ides, I dare [s]ay, my Lady, though imprudent, is not criminal." "To be [s]ure my Lady has [s]ome excu[s]e; my Lord is always after other women: he is [s]eldom at home, and I am  certain don't care a pin about his wife." "Perhaps if her Lady[s]hip was more attentive to increa[s]e his dome[s]tic comforts, he would nece[s][s]arily grow more attached to home, but while [s]he is [s]o extravagantly fond of di[s][s]ipation, and while the four honours have the power to keep her from home, night after night, can we be surprised if her hu[s]band [s]eeks abroad for that felicity he is [s]ure of not meeting in his own hou[s]e." "Why, to [s]ay truth, my Lady is a [s]ad rake." "And her children, Mrs. Lappett, [s]he pays but little attention to them, nor will [s]he [s]uffer any other per[s]on to do it. Can there be a more lovely or engaging child than Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter. I am [s]ure the little time I have to in[s]truct her is amply repaid by her docility and attention; as to Ma[s]ter O[s][s]iter and his brother James, they are [s]o humoured, e[s]pecially the former, that it requires greater powers than I am po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of to make them attend to any thing."

"Extremely [s]o," replied the artle[s]s Rebecca; "be[s]ides which, he is cruel, mi[s]chievous, and a great liar, and the[s]e things [s]hould be corrected in time, or he will be as despicable when a man, as he is now di[s]agreeable as a child." "His temper is very like his mother's." "I think there is [s]ome [s]imilitude between them, for indeed, Mrs. Lappett, I do not know how you acquire fortitude to [s]upport it, but my Lady is [s]ometimes [s]o passionate and capricious I am ready to die with vexation, and, though my heart be ready to bur[s]t, in her pre[s]ence I dare not [s]hed a tear, for if [s]ometimes, when I can no longer [s]uppre[s]s them, they will bur[s]t forth, [s]he reproaches me with childi[s]hne[s]s, pa[s][s]ion, and folly. Folly it is, I will own, to let the behaviour of [s]o unfeeling a woman wound my [s]en[s]ibility; but yet when I know that I do my duty to the utmo[s]t of my power, it is very hard to meet with nothing in return but taunts and unkindne[s]s." "So it is indeed, my dear, but you mu[s]t keep up your [s]pirits." "I do, Mrs. Lappett, as well as I can, but my Lady [s]ometimes a[s]ks me what I am fit for? and if [s]he had not taken me, who would? That my Lord often tells her, he wonders [s]he will keep [s]o awkward a creature about her. I am [s]en[s]ible I have many obligations to her Lady[s]hip's family, but can I help my inexperience, unacquainted as I am with [s]ervitude?" "No, to be [s]ure, you cannot: but my Lady will want me, and I [s]hall come in for my [s]hare, for I do a[s][s]ure you child, we get it all round in turn; but you will know how to bear the[s]e things better in time." Lappett returned to her Lady and not only repeated but exaggerated every thing which Rebecca, in the [s]implicity of her heart, had uttered.

"I [s]hall not keep her long, Lappett; I a[s][s]ure you, I am quite [s]ick of her airs and impertinence." The clock had [s]truck ten, the children were in bed, and Lady O[s][s]iter ju[s]t [s]tepped into her chair and gone towards [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] Cavendi[s]h-Square, the [s]ervants retired to the lower apartments, and [s]ilence [s]eemed to reign throughout the hou[s]e. Rebecca, wearied with the fatigue and vexation of the day, thought [s]he might this evening [s]afely indulge, in a relaxation, which [s]he had not enjoyed [s]ince her re[s]idence in Lady O[s][s]iter's family, which was to practice a few hours on the harp[s]icord. She took her mu[s]ic books and a candle, and went to a [s]mall parlour, in a retired part of the hou[s]e, where [s]tood a [s]ine toned in[s]trument, and where [s]he [s]at down and amu[s]ed her[s]elf, unthinking how time pa[s]t, and entirely inattentive to the foot[s]teps that pa[s][s]ed and repassed the door of the apartment. The mu[s]ic [s]oothed and compo[s]ed the perturbation of her [s]pirits. She played several little plaintive airs, and accompanied them with her voice; and among the re[s]t, the [s]ong [s]he was [s]igning when Sir George fir[s]t [s]aw her.

She pau[s]ed, and tears involuntarily [s]tole down her cheeks; her amusement was ended; [s]he ro[s]e from her [s]eat, and was [s]hutting the book, when [s]omebody laid hold of her, and repeating, \---as the maid retired, He ki[s]s'd her tears away. cla[s]ped her rudely in his arms and [s]natched a ki[s]s. Rebecca, too much terrified to [s]cream, could only endeavour to di[s]engage her[s]elf, and turning round, beheld Lord O[s][s]iter. "If I have alarmed you, my dear creature," [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, "I humbly entreat your pardon. But do not let me interrupt your amu[s]ement; come, [s]it down again, and let me hear that charming [s]ong you were [s]inging when I entered the room." "Your Lord[s]hip will pardon me, I had no intention of being heard by any one;---I have [s]ome orders to execute for my Lady." "Nay, nay, you do not get off [s]o ea[s]ily. Do you know, my lovely girl, I have been ab[s]olutely expiring from the fir[s]t moment I beheld you, for an opportunity to tell you how much I admire and adore you." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] "Surely your Lord[s]hip cannot [s]eriou[s]ly mean to in[s]ult me." "In[s]ult you, my angel, no, by heavens I would sacrifice the wretch who [s]hould dare to offend you:---No, my dear girl, I mean to offer you love and affluence in the room of dependence and poverty. I will place you in your proper [s]phere: [s]uch beauty and elegance were not formed for [s]ervitude. Come, li[s]ten to me, I will furni[s]h you a hou[s]e, keep you a chariot, and [s]ettle five hundred a year." "Gracious heaven," cried Rebecca, bur[s]ting into tears, "to what am I expo[s]ed." "P[s]haw, p[s]haw, this is all prudery and non[s]en[s]e; come, dry your tears and let us go to my jeweller's, and you [s]hall take your choice of whatever trinkets his [s]hop affords, I will not limit you as to the [s]um." Lord O[s][s]iter had but an indifferent opinion of female delicacy; he thought the word virtue very pretty in the mouth of a pretty woman, but as to the reality exi[s]ting in the heart, he thought no woman po[s][s]e[s][s]ed [s]o large a [s]hare but money, jewels, and flattery could lull it to [s]leep; how a[s]toni[s]hed was he then to find, upon taking a few liberties with Rebecca, [s]he [s]hrunk in[s]tinctively from him, [s]hrieked faintly, and, [s]taggering a few paces toward the door, fell lifele[s]s to the floor. Terrified, he caught her from the ground, and ringing the bell with violence, began to tear open her gown and handkerchief, in order to give her air. "My dear, my lovely girl," [s]aid he, "for heaven's [s]ake revive." Then placing her on a [s]ofa, he [s]eated him[s]elf be[s]ide her, and re[s]ted her head on his [s]houlder. At that moment who [s]hould appear at the door but Mrs. Lappett, all the fury of a jealous enraged woman fla[s]hing from her eyes. "My dear Lappett," [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, "I happened to come unexpectedly into the room where this poor girl was amu[s]ing her[s]elf, and [s]ee how it has frightened her; do get a little water." But Lappett was not to be deceived: [s]he had heard him utter words of tenderne[s]s, and was [s]ufficiently convinced Rebecca was her rival. "The creature is [s]o affected," [s]aid [s]he, "I declare there [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] is no bearing her, but I a[s][s]ure your Lord[s]hip I have something el[s]e to do than to wait on the dear lovely girl ." Rebecca was now recovering, and, rai[s]ing her head, [s]he caught hold of Lappett's gown, as [s]he turned to leave the room, and exclaimed, "Do not leave me, [s]tay, [s]ave me, take me from this place." "Indeed, Madam, I am in a hurry," cried Lappett, twitching her gown from the feeble gra[s]p of Rebecca, and flung out of the room, audibly [s]aying, "Her Lady [s]hould be informed what [s]ort of a per[s]on [s]he had in her family." Rebecca aro[s]e, di[s]engaged her[s]elf from his Lord[s]hip's arms, who no longer attempted to detain her, and with trembling [s]teps returned to her apartment. FASHIONABLE LEVITIES. " So , Madam, cried Lappett, as [s]he was a[s][s]i[s]ting her Lady to ri[s]e the next morning; "[s]o, Madam, though Mrs. Rebecca was [s]o delicate as to refu[s]e conveying a letter to his Grace, [s]he has no objection to private interviews with my Lord. Oh, I could have torn the creature's eyes out, an impertinent minx." "What are you talking of, Lappett," [s]aid her Ladyship, with the greate[s]t compo[s]ure, "I prote[s]t you [s]eem out of your [s]en[s]es." "I am, my Lady, almo[s]t, for when I reflect on [s]o kind, [s]o good a Lady as your[s]elf being treated in [s]uch a barbarous manner: why, Madam, after you were gone la[s]t night, I went up to [s]ee if Rebecca was doing the dre[s]s your Lady[s]hip [s]aid you would wear on Thur[s]day, and I could not find her; however, as I knew [s]he sometimes went to the library when you were not at home, and [s]taid and read for two or three hours, I [s]at down and began a little of it my[s]elf, but, after working till pa[s]t twelve o'clock, I thought it was very odd where [s]he could be, [s]o I went down the back [s]tairs, thinking perhaps I [s]hould find her in the hou[s]ekeeper's room, but as I pa[s]t the little mu[s]ic parlour, I heard the [s]ound of voice and opening the door, what does your Lady[s]hip think, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] I di[s]covered, I thought I [s]hould have [s]wooned away, for there [s]at Rebecca, fa[s]t locked in my Lord's arms, and her head leaned on his [s]houlders." "Very well," cried Lady O[s][s]iter, peevi[s]hly, the crimson of re[s]entment ru[s]hing over her face and neck, "why am I plagued with this long [s]tory: one would think you were jealous of the creature, by the pa[s][s]ion you are in." "I jealous, my Lady, does your Lady[s]hip think?"--- "Oh, no! I don't think about it; I [s]uppo[s]e my Lord is not wor[s]e than other men of his rank, and while he is not wanting in re[s]pect to me, I [s]hall not trouble my[s]elf about his amu[s]ements; to be [s]ure, it is rather mortifying to have a little in[s]ignificant hu[s][s]y preferred in one's own hou[s]e." "That is what I [s]ay, Madam." "You have no right to [s]ay or think about it; if I am [s]atisfied with my Lord's conduct, I de[s]ire I may hear none of your [s]lippant impertinence upon a [s]ubject that don't concern you." done, Ma'am, but I hope you'll di[s]charge---" "I certainly [s]hall di[s]charge every [s]ervant of mine, who[s]e conduct di[s]plea[s]es me, therefore, Lappett, read that impudent [s]crawl, and then let me know what wages are due to you." Lappett took the letter, and trembled as [s]he took it, for [s]he knew it to be one which [s]he had written to her [s]i[s]ter, and having intru[s]ted it to the hou[s]e maid to put it in the po[s]t, the girl's curio[s]ity led her to open it, but, being [s]urpri[s]ed by the entrance of her lady whil[s]t in the act of reading it, [s]he had, in her hurry to put it in her pocket, dropped it, and while the officious Lappett was contriving to introduce the Duke unperceived to her Lady, this unfortunate letter di[s]covered her criminal intercourse with her Lord. But though Lady O[s][s]iter had thus bridled her pa[s][s]ion while talking to her infamous confidante, [s]he no [s]ooner [s]aw the innocent Rebecca, than [s]he vented on her that torrent of abu[s]e fear had prevented her from pouring on the other. Artful infamous [s]trumpet, were her elegant expre[s][s]ions, to pretend to [s]uch re[s]inement of [s]entiment, and yet be guilty of [s]uch glaring faults. In vain Rebecca wept, and called on heaven to witne[s]s her innocence; even when kneeling, [s]he reque[s]ted not to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] be bereaved of her only refuge, an unblemi[s]hed character. The haughty Lady O[s][s]iter [s]purned her from her, and bid her in[s]tantly leave her hou[s]e, and get her bread without, for [s]he was well convinced [s]he did not de[s]erve one. Lord O[s][s]iter, prepared as he was to meet her anger, was unable to bear the illiberal abu[s]e with which [s]he loaded him; he therefore [s]atisfied him[s]elf with telling her, when [s]he practi[s]ed the duties of a wife, he would begin to [s]tudy tho[s]e of a hu[s]band; till then, [s]he had no right to complain, and left her to compo[s]e her [s]pirits, as [s]he could, while he inquired of his valet what he knew concerning Rebecca. He [s]oon learnt, by inquiries being made among the servants, that Rebecca was di[s]mi[s][s]ed, and that [s]he had taken a place in the Lincoln[s]hire [s]tage, in order to return to her mother. This was [s]ufficient intelligence for his Lord[s]hip, and he began to plan [s]chemes for getting her in his power. When Rebecca came to take leave of the children, her feelings were unde[s]cribable. Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter hung about her neck; even Charles and James begged her not to they would be good boys and never vex her by behaving ill again. She embraced them all tenderly, and with a heart almo[s]t broken, got into a hackney-coach, which took her to the inn from whence the [s]tage [s]et out. She a[s]ked to be [s]hown to an apartment, and ordered [s]ome trifle for her [s]upper, then [s]itting down by a little [s]olitary fire, began to reflect on her vexations, nor did [s]he con[s]ider it as the lea[s]t, that [s]he was obliged to return to her mother who had written to her but twice during her residence in London, and even tho[s]e letters were [s]hort and cold. The five hundred pounds Mrs. Harley had given her, [s]he did not con[s]ider as her own property, and be[s]ides that, [s]he was po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of but ten guineas in the world; to be [s]ure [s]he had a few valuable trinkets, pre[s]ents from Lady Mary, and a good [s]tock of clothes; but what was that, when [s]he wanted [s]upport it would [s]oon be gone. In the mid[s]t of the[s]e painful reflexions [s]he drew the picture of her benefactre[s]s from her bo[s]om, and contemplated it as her chief, her almo[s]t only comfort. But, examining it more minutely than [s]he had ever before done, [s]he thought [s]he di[s]covered [s]omething like a [s]pring on the edge of the setting, and pre[s][s]ing her finger on it, the back flew off and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] di[s]covered to her the portrait of Sir George, fixed behind that of his mother. Spite of her[s]elf [s]he could not help gazing on it with plea[s]ure, and when [s]he con[s]idered the delicacy with which he had managed to pre[s]ent it to her, he ro[s]e higher than ever in her e[s]teem. "Ah," [s]aid [s]he, "he certainly loves me, and is worthy my e[s]teem. Why are we not born for each other, for [s]ure I am, I could be content with Sir George, though in the humble[s]t [s]tation: more---far more happy than in an elevated [s]phere; for in the humbler walks of life the felicity we experience mu[s]t proceed from a mutual de[s]ire to plea[s]e, but in an exalted [s]tation we live not for our[s]elves but others, at lea[s]t if we have not fortitude to [s]corn and de[s]pi[s]e the [s]neers of the fa[s]hionable world." Rebecca could not help con[s]idering the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of this portrait, at this period, as an invaluable trea[s]ure, and in her own brea[s]t [s]olemnly vowed never to part from it. She indulged her[s]elf in gazing on it while [s]he [s]at up, and [s]he retired to bed, laid it on her pillow, and fell into a compo[s]ed [s]lumber, which la[s]ted till called at four o'clock to join the pa[s][s]engers in the coach. Refre[s]hed and comforted by the re[s]t [s]he had taken, Rebecca aro[s]e with alacrity to pur[s]ue her journey, and nothing material occurred till they had proceeded upwards of fifty miles from town, when the coach was overtaken by a po[s]t-chai[s]e and four, in which was a man, who [s]topped the coachman and a[s]ked if there was not a young per[s]on within [s]ide of the name of Littleton. "Yes," cried Rebecca, innocently looking out of the window, "my name is Littleton." "Ah, Ma'am," cried the man, "I am commanded to entreat you to return. Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter was la[s]t night taken extremely ill, and cries continually for you; my Lady therefore begs you will forget what is pa[s]t, and come and take your u[s]ual [s]tation in the family. She is convinced of your innocence, but if di[s]agreeable to your[s]elf, [s]he will only de[s]ire you to remain till Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter is better." Rebecca's heart, formed for the warme[s]t affection, beat high when [s]he heard of her little favourite's illne[s]s. The ill treatment [s]he had experienced from Lady O[s][s]iter was in[s]tantly forgot, and [s]he thought only of returning as quick as po[s][s]ible to attend the dear little girl. She [s]prang [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] ha[s]tily from the coach, and only taking with her a [s]mall portmanteau, containing a nece[s][s]ary change of linen, got into the chai[s]e, and though drawn as quick as four hor[s]es could carry her, [s]he thought every moment an hour, [s]o anxious was [s]he to arrive in Bedford-Square. SEDUCTION. It was very late when Rebecca entered London, and [s]he was not enough acquainted with the [s]treets to know whether [s]he was going right or wrong; therefore, when the chai[s]e [s]topped in a large [s]quare, [s]he jumped eagerly out and ran into the hou[s]e, without once con[s]idering whether [s]he knew the place; but when [s]he had got in the hall and the door was [s]hut, ju[s]t as [s]he was going to run up [s]tairs, the [s]tairca[s]e, which was different to the one [s]he had been u[s]ed to, [s]truck her, and turning ha[s]tily round to demand why [s]he was brought to a [s]trange place, [s]he the parlour door open, and in an in[s]tant Lord O[s][s]iter was at her feet. "Good God!" [s]aid [s]he, "where am I? why am I thus betrayed?" "You are not betrayed my adorable Mi[s]s Littleton," [s]aid he; "let me entreat you to be calm. Grieved to the [s]oul that Lady O[s][s]iter [s]hould have treated you [s]o unworthily, I made u[s]e of an innocent [s]tratagem to bring you back, that I might obtain your pardon, and convince you that I am ready to expiate, with my life, the offence [s]he has committed again[s]t you." "If that is all," cried Rebecca, [s]carcely able to re[s]pire, through terror, a[s][s]ure your[s]elf I have forgiven you, my Lord, and will pardon the deceit you have been guilty of, if you will [s]uffer me in[s]tantly to quit this hou[s]e, where every moment I remain fills me with angui[s]h and terror." "Why do you wi[s]h to quit this hou[s]e, my dear angel," [s]aid he, forcibly leading her into the parlour; "it is your own, every thing in it is your's; all the [s]ervants are ready to obey your commands." Then ringing the bell, he ordered all the [s]ervants to appear, and bid them con[s]ider [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] Rebecca as their mi[s]tre[s]s, and obey her, as they valued his future favour. "Ah, my friends," [s]aid Rebeca, "do not attend to what he [s]ays; I have no right to command you, I am only a [s]ervant, like your[s]elves, and [s]uch I wi[s]h to remain; only continue to me, ju[s]t heaven!" cried [s]he, fervently rai[s]ing her eyes and hands, "my innocence un[s]ullied, and my integrity of mind un[s]haken." "Be compo[s]ed my deare[s]t love," [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, di[s]mi[s][s]ing the [s]ervants, "no harm [s]hall happen to you while under my protection." "Oh!" cried [s]he, in an agony, "I [s]ee, unle[s]s [s]ome protecting angel hovers over me, I am threatened with the wor[s]t of dangers. Let me go, Sir! by what authority do you detain me here." "Whither would you go, my dear creature at this late hour; if you quit this hou[s]e no reputable door will open to receive you, and I am [s]ure, my [s]weet Rebecca would not enter a hou[s]e of infamy." "Alas! alas! my Lord, I fear I have done that already, though heaven knows how innocently. "My lovely girl, do but compo[s]e your agitated [s]pirits, and every thing will appear to you in a different light; let me [s]end your own woman to you, [s]he [s]hall wait on you to your own apartment, where I beg you will take [s]ome refreshment, and endeavour to repo[s]e your[s]elf; I [s]wear to you, Rebecca, I will not enter your chamber till you give me leave." "Merciful heaven!" cried Rebecca, "what will become of me?" Lord O[s][s]iter retired, and an elderly woman made her appearance with candles. Rebecca for a few moments [s]tood irre[s]olute; at length [s]he determined to go up [s]tairs with the woman, and by a pretended calmne[s]s, endeavoured to [s]ound her principles, and whether [s]he was entirely devoted to the intere[s]t of her Lord. When [s]he was in the apartment which the woman called her own, [s]he [s]at down on a [s]ofa, and calmly inquired who [s]lept in the adjoining apartment. "I do, Madam," was the an[s]wer. "Have you been long in this hou[s]e?" "I was only hired ye[s]terday, Madam; and my Lord's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] gentleman informed me the hou[s]e was taken for a young lady, a relation of his ma[s]ter's, who was expected from the country." "And when do you expect [s]he will arrive?" [s]aid Rebecca, with a[s][s]umed indifference. "Madam," cried the woman, [s]taring, "are you not the lady?" "No, indeed I am no relation of his Lord[s]hip's; I lived in his family, as a [s]ervant to dre[s]s, undre[s]s, and teach Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter to read." "But you are ju[s]t come from the country now, Madam?" "I was on my journey into the country, when I was fetched back again. I under[s]tood Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter was ill." "My Lord undoubtedly has a great regard for you, and means to give you in this hou[s]e a brilliant establishment. You can [s]urely have no objection to exchange servitude for affluence." "It is a de[s]irable change, certainly, if made on honourable terms." "Liberality, my dear Madam, is [s]ometimes an equivalent for honour." "Are the[s]e your real [s]entiments?" [s]aid Rebecca, with a [s]crutinizing look. "They are the [s]entiments of one half of the world---" "But had you a child, would you talk to her in this [s]train; would you wi[s]h her to barter all [s]he ought to hold dear in life, for the paltry con[s]ideration of [s]plendour?" She looked, as [s]he [s]poke, earne[s]tly in the woman's face: it was an entreating, [s]upplicating look, and the tears gu[s]hed from her eyes. "I had a daughter once," replied the attendant, (whom we [s]hall di[s]tingui[s]h by the name of Harris:) "[s]he was lovely as you are---[s]he was once as innocent; but innocence could not [s]hield her from the calumny of the world, and ill treatment depraved a heart formed for the love and practice of virtue." She pau[s]ed, her eyes filled, and Rebecca began to hope [s]he [s]hould find a friend that would a[s][s]i[s]t her in e[s]caping the artful [s]nare [s]pread by Lord O[s][s]iter, to entrap her innocence. Mrs. Harris, finding her remain [s]ilent, left the room, and in about ten minutes returned with a boiled chicken, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] which [s]he entreated Rebecca to take part of before [s]he retired to re[s]t. "I am totally unable to take any re[s]t," [s]aid Rebecca; "but where is my Lord?" "Gone home, and left his valet, in conjunction with my[s]elf, to wait your commands." "Or rather to be my jailers," [s]aid Rebecca;" "but come, Mrs. Harris, (for [s]he had inquired her name) come [s]it down, and if you will partake my [s]upper, I will endeavour to eat [s]ome. You were [s]peaking of your daughter, I [s]hould like to hear [s]omething more concerning her." "Ah, Madam, her [s]tory is but [s]hort, but it will melt your heart; indeed I do not know that I [s]hould tell it you at this time, but [s]omething whi[s]pers me, it will be right to give you [s]ome information concerning the villainy of men. Perhaps you have a mother, Mi[s]s." "I have," replied Rebecca, her thoughts in[s]tantly reverting to her dear native village. "Oh, may [s]he never experience the angui[s]h of heart I have felt, in [s]eeing her darling lo[s]t to every [s]en[s]e of [s]hame in this world, and to every hope of peace in the next. "My hu[s]band was a reputable trade[s]man; we po[s][s]e[s][s]ed not the luxuries of life, but we enjoyed its comforts, and were content. We had but one child; [s]he was the joy of our hearts, the prop on which we re[s]ted for happine[s]s. My hu[s]band had a [s]i[s]ter who had lived many years a hou[s]ekeeper with a nobleman: this [s]i[s]ter was godmother to my girl, who was chri[s]tened Jane, in compliment to her. When Jenny was thirteen, her aunt declared [s]he would give her a couple of years at a re[s]pectable boarding [s]chool, and then think about [s]etting her in [s]ome way of getting her bread. "I had forgot to tell you, Mi[s]s, that my hu[s]band and [s]elf lived upwards of twenty miles from London, and it was with great difficulty we brought our[s]elves to part with our darling; but confidering it would be for her intere[s]t to go with her aunt, we at length con[s]ented, and were satisfied with [s]eeing her at holliday time, and exulted not a little at the evident improvement di[s]cernable in her per[s]on and manners, whenever [s]he renewed her vi[s]it. The two years were pa[s]t, and Jenny, taken from [s]chool, was placed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] with an eminent milliner, in which bu[s]ine[s]s her aunt promised to [s]et her up when her apprentice[s]hip expired. "It happened one day, when [s]he had been to dine with her aunt, that going up the front [s]tairs, to fetch [s]omething from an upper apartment, [s]he was met by a young gentleman, who [s]topped, made room for her, and bowed as [s]he pa[s][s]ed him. The next day, as [s]he was at work in the [s]hop, the [s]ame gentleman came in and a[s]ked to look at [s]ome gloves; [s]he aro[s]e to [s]erve him. "Ble[s]s me, Mi[s]s," [s]aid he, "did I not [s]ee you ye[s]terday at Lord Melvin's?" She an[s]wered in the affirmative. "I was there," [s]aid he, carele[s]sly, "to receive her Lady[s]hip's order concerning the alteration of [s]ome furniture. I have the honour to do the mo[s]t of the upholstery bu[s]ine[s]s for them." "They then fell into chat. He wondered he had never [s]een her before, as he was [s]o well acquainted with her aunt, and begged leave [s]ometimes to call and inquire after her health. From this an intimacy took place, and Mr. Smith made propo[s]als of marriage, which were approved of by the aunt: he even mentioned buying her indentures of her mi[s]tre[s]s, that the union might be expedited. But in the mid[s]t of this Jenny could not help remarking, that Mr. Smith never a[s]ked her to his hou[s]e; but her aunt [s]aid it was his tenderne[s]s for her reputation that prevented him. And he began to hint that he had made [s]everal lucky hits in the lottery, and [s]hould leave off bu[s]ine[s]s, or at lea[s]t throw it into [s]uch a line, that a few hours attendance every day would be [s]ufficient, and the re[s]t might be performed by per[s]ons whom he would employ for that purpo[s]e. Things were in this [s]tate when we were wrote to, and the match, as repre[s]ented by her aunt, being every way beyond our expectations, we freely gave our con[s]ent; nay, [s]o delighted were we with the hope of her being [s]o well [s]ettled, that we made our neighbours partakers of our joys, and our daughter's good fortune was univer[s]ally talked of. One evening, as we were [s]itting in our little parlour, talking of our future pro[s]pects, among which was the hope of [s]eeing our dear girl and her hu[s]band, immediately after her marriage, we were [s]tartled by a loud rap at the door, and Mr. Harris having opened it, our poor Jenny ru[s]hed in, pale, breathle[s]s, and to all appearance [s]inking with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] fatigue. My love, you are welcome, [s]aid I, catching her in my arms; this is kind indeed to make us [s]o early a vi[s]it ---but where is your hu[s]band?" "Hu[s]band!" [s]aid [s]he, wildly; "I have no hu[s]band. Who told you I was married?" "Your aunt wrote us word, my dear, you were to have been married four days [s]ince." "She laid her hand upon her forehead, as though endeavouring to recollect [s]omething." "I believe it was [s]o," [s]aid [s]he, "but that aunt of mine is a [s]ad woman, for though I thought I was married, it was all a fal[s]ehood. And do you know, my dear mother, I am a poor undone creature; but do not [s]purn me from you---indeed I am not wilfully guilty." "Here [s]he pau[s]ed, and, [s]inking on her knees before us, her emotions became [s]o violent, that [s]he was unable to proceed, and we conveyed her to bed, in a [s]tate little [s]hort of ab[s]olute di[s]traction. For [s]everal days [s]he was unable to give us any account of what had befallen her. She was feveri[s]h, [s]ometimes delirous, and when any lucid intervals appeared, too weak and languid to be capable of [s]peaking more than two or three words at a time. When [s]he began to recover, [s]he gave us an account that almo[s]t broke our hearts; indeed her father never held up his head again, but drooped and pined till a con[s]umption put a period to his exi[s]tence." DELIVERANCE. " She told us, that at the time appointed her mi[s]tre[s]s gave up her indentures to Mr. Smith, and [s]he accompanied her aunt and lover to his hou[s]e, which was situated in a newly built [s]treet: was [s]mall, but commodious, and elegantly furni[s]hed; which [s]he attributed to his having been in that way of bu[s]ine[s]s. Here, it [s]eems, they were, as [s]he thought, married; Mr. Smith [s]aying, he had an objection to public weddings, and did not mind a little extra expence to have things conducted with delicacy and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] privacy. Two days after her marriage, her hu[s]band [s]aid he [s]hould be obliged to leave her for the night, having a little bu[s]ine[s]s to tran[s]act a few miles out of town, but he would be with her again by dinner the next day. After he was gone, feeling her[s]elf rather [s]olitary, [s]he put on her hat and cloak and went to her mi[s]tre[s]s's, where [s]he found [s]everal of her old companions preparing to go to the play. This being a diver[s]ion [s]he was fond of, but little per[s]ua[s]ion was nece[s][s]ary to get her to join the party; accordingly, attended by a genteel young man, they proceeded to Covent-Garden, and got a very excellent [s]eat in the two [s]hilling gallery. The fir[s]t act of the play was nearly fini[s]hed, when a little bu[s]tle in the [s]tage-box occa[s]ioning Jenny to look that way, [s]he [s]aw her hu[s]band enter, leading a very plain woman, [s]uperbly dre[s][s]ed, and take his [s]eat be[s]ide her on the front row. "Look, Lucy," [s]aid [s]he, to one of her companions, "would you not almo[s]t [s]wear that was Mr. Smith." "Why, it is Mr. Smith," returned the girl, innocently, "I am [s]ure it is him." "If," [s]aid the young man who was with them, "you mean the gentleman in the [s]tage box, with that ordinary woman, you are mi[s]taken in the name; that is Mr. Ponsonville, elde[s]t [s]on to the earl of Melvin." "But I am [s]ure you are mi[s]taken," cried Lucy, with vivacity. "You will give a lady leave to know her own hu[s]band, I hope, and Mrs. Smith here claims that gentleman as her property." "I am [s]orry for it," replied the young man, "for I am convinced that is Mr. Pon[s]onville, and that Lady beside him is his wife; my father has made his clothes ever [s]ince he was a boy." "Jenny, who had [s]at in [s]ilent agitation during this little dialogue, now ventured to a[s]k if he meant the [s]on of Lord Melvin, of Melvin Court." "The [s]ame," he replied. "A confu[s]ed idea now ru[s]hed into her mind, that [s]he had been vilely betrayed. She was [s]en[s]ible that the per[s]on [s]he [s]aw was the man [s]he called her hu[s]band; and if he was in reality Mr. Pon[s]onville, and the hu[s]band of another [s]he was utterly ruined. The[s]e reflexions prevented her having any enjoyment of the play, and at the end of it [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] reque[s]ted the young man to [s]ee her into a hackney-coach, as [s]he found her[s]elf not inclined to [s]ee the entertainment. She drove immediately to her aunt's, but the coachman was not able to draw up to the door, on account of [s]everal carriages. She got out at the corner of the [s]quare, and proceeded on foot to the hou[s]e, where [s]he arrived ju[s]t as an elegant chariot drew up. Curio[s]ity led her to go near, in order to [s]ee the gue[s]ts alight. The chariot door opened, and Mr. Pon[s]onville alighted, handing out the [s]ame lady [s]he had [s]een at the play. This was proof [s]ufficient; [s]he was too near then to be deceived---Pon[s]onville and Smith were the [s]ame. She [s]taggered a few [s]teps forward, faintly articulated his name, and [s]unk lifele[s]s on the pavement. "Mrs. Pon[s]onville, though plain in her per[s]on, possessed a humane heart: [s]he [s]aw her fall, and ordered the servants to rai[s]e her and carry her in, and giving orders for her to be taken care of, left her. Whatever Pon[s]onville's feelings were, he di[s]gui[s]ed them [s]o well, his lady did not in the lea[s]t [s]u[s]pect his intere[s]t in the fainting Jane. And, having informed Lady Melvin of what had happened, [s]he reque[s]ted that the orders [s]he had given might be enforced by her Lady[s]hip; and Harris was ordered to take particular care of the young woman. The [s]ervant [s]ummoned to receive the[s]e commands informed her Lady[s]hip that it was Mi[s]s Harris, who, they imagined, was coming to [s]ee her aunt, who had fainted, and that [s]he was now recovering and in the hou[s]ekeeper's room; the Ladies therefore imagining [s]he was in good hands, made no farther inquiry. "When Jenny recovered [s]he began lamenting her hard fate, and accu[s]ing her aunt of deceiving her; but that kind relation would not let her proceed." "What would the fool be at," [s]aid [s]he; "keep your own [s]ecret, and nobody that you need care for will be the wi[s]er; be[s]ides I have had your intere[s]t at heart and your fortune is made. Here (continued [s]he, going to a beaureau) here is a [s]ettlement of five hundred a year as long as you live." "Jenny caught the parchment from her, and tore it in pieces: "Thus peri[s]h, ([s]aid [s]he) every [s]ign of my dishonour--- what are riches without innocence."---"As you have lo[s]t the one, you might as well have kept the other," [s]aid her aunt. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] "Jenny left the hou[s]e without deigning a reply. The next morning early Pon[s]onville was with her. Hard was the [s]truggle between love and honour; for [s]he really loved her [s]educer with the mo[s]t enthu[s]ia[s]tic pa[s][s]ion. His [s]ighs, his tears were infectious; [s]he reque[s]ted till the next day to con[s]ider, but [s]he was well convinced to deliberate was to be lo[s]t, and be had no [s]ooner left her, than [s]he ordered a chai[s]e, and flew for protection to the arms of her parents. "But we [s]oon di[s]covered that the poor girl's misfortune would be made public. We were pitied by [s]ome, laughed at and ridiculed by others, and the finger of [s]corn was pointed at my unfortunate child whenever [s]he ventured abroad. We [s]old all our little po[s][s]e[s][s]ions, and repaired to London, where we thought to hide our [s]hame in ob[s]curity. Here my poor hu[s]band paid the debt of nature, and Jenny became the mother of a fine boy. As [s]he pa[s][s]ed for a widow, and was in the full bloom of beauty, it is not to be wondered that [s]he [s]hould be addre[s][s]ed on the [s]core of marriage by a young man who kept a per[s]umery and toy-[s]hop in the neighbourhood. Jenny's heart was [s]till too full of the idea of Pon[s]onville to [s]uffer any other attachment to grow on it; but poverty began to [s]tare us in the face: [s]he [s]aw on one [s]ide, a mother, a child pining with want, no protector, no friend to comfort and relieve them; on the other, a home, a protector, and a place of refuge for tho[s]e objects [s]o dear to her heart. She acceded to his propo[s]al and was married. Three years pa[s][s]ed on in tranquillity at lea[s]t, and my daughter was the mother of another boy and a girl, but I [s]aw [s]he was not de[s]tined to be happy: her hu[s]band was frequently moro[s]e and peevi[s]h, and [s]pent much of his time at clubs and public hou[s]es. But I knew they had a good bu[s]ine[s]s, and therefore did not dread her experiencing the evils of poverty. One day, as I was in the [s]hop, I [s]aw a chariot draw up, and immediately called Jenny to attend. She came ju[s]t as the gentleman de[s]cended and entered the [s]hop. "Good heaven!" exclaimed he. Jenny turned pale and leaned again[s]t the counter. The gentleman recollected him[s]elf---"Is not your name Harris?" [s]aid he, advancing. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] "No," [s]aid [s]he, [s]aintly, "it once was, but I am married." "Cur[s]ed fate!" cried he, vehemently. "I am at liberty, and have [s]ought you with unremitting diligence, to do you the ju[s]tice your virtue merits."---At that instant her elde[s]t boy ran into the [s]hop. Mother, [s]aid he, taking her hand. "And who[s]e is this cherub?" [s]aid he, taking the boy on his knee, for he had [s]eated him[s]elf. "Mine," replied Jenny.---"And what is your name, my [s]weet fellow?" to the child. "Pon[s]onville Smith," [s]aid the boy. "Pon[s]onville," cried he, vi[s]ibly agitated. "Ponsonville;--- and how old are you?" "Four years la[s]t Chri[s]tmas." "Jenny," cried he, taking hold of her hand. "Jenny, my love, how like a villain I have behaved to this boy and you." "He drew her towards him with one hand, while he embraced the child with the other. She [s]unk on a [s]eat be[s]ide him, her head [s]ell on his [s]houlder, and they both wept.---What a moment was this for the hu[s]band to enter,---he did enter. Jenny [s]tarted, a deep blu[s]t was [s]ucceeded by a deadly palene[s]s, and it was with difficulty we got her into the parlour. "Pon[s]onville, now Lord Melvin, made [s]ome trifling purcha[s]e, and went away. I [s]aw the [s]torm that lowered on her hu[s]band's brow; it bur[s]t forth in cruel invective, and, having traced Lord Melvin, and from [s]ome officious per[s]on learnt the whole [s]tory, he was not content with reproach only, but added even blows, and at length proceeded to that pitch of brutality as to turn my child and her unoffending offspring into the [s]treet. Lord Melvin called to inquire for his boy,---he heard the tidings, and never re[s]ted till he di[s]covered our place of retreat. Mi[s]erable indeed was the apartment where he found his Jenny. He offered her independence for herself, her mother, and children. I blu[s]h to add the remainder, but let no one boa[s]t their virtue till the cold hand of poverty has tried its [s]trength to the utmo[s]t. Jenny accepted his propo[s]als, and for [s]even years, affluence was her portion---but alas, not content; her heart bled, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] her angui[s]h was unde[s]cribable, but [s]he wore the [s]mile of conent on her face, and the misjudging world thought her happy. Alas! ([s]he would [s]ay) alas! my children, what does your mother [s]acrifice for you. But my Lord died [s]uddenly, and died inte[s]tate: there was [s]ome flaw found in the [s]ettlement made on Jenny, by his heir, and [s]he was again reduced to poverty. When the human mind has gone a few [s]teps in vice, how ea[s]y does it proceed: my Jenny had a[s][s]ociated with women who[s]e situation were like her own; by degrees her mind lo[s]t that [s]trong [s]en[s]e of rectitude which nature had implanted there, and [s]he yielded, without compunction, to the [s]olicitations of another lover. I will proceed no farther; [s]he is now gone, and in her la[s]t hours regretted the lo[s]s of that purity of heart which alone could have enabled her to meet that awful moment with compo[s]ure." The tears that [s]ell from Mrs. Harris's eyes encouraged Rebecca. She [s]lid from her [s]eat on her knees before her. "And can you, my dear Mrs. Harris," [s]aid [s]he, in a mo[s]t per[s]ua[s]ive tone of voice, "Can you, who have felt [s]o much for a child, behold a poor forlorn creature, who, unle[s]s you help her, mu[s]t be inevitably lo[s]t---plunged into that aby[s]s of guilt and mi[s]ery which mu[s]t [s]ink her beneath the regard of every virtuous per[s]on. Oh! rather [s]tretch forth thy hand and [s]ave her. I am innocent now, be thou my guardian angel, and deliver me from this dreadful place. I can work, Mrs. Harris,---I am not a[s]hamed to work, even in the meane[s]t capacity---I will be a[s]hamed of nothing but di[s]honour." Mrs. Harris rai[s]ed her, and [s]poke to her words of comfort. They [s]at together till the clock [s]truck four, and then, taking off their [s]hoes and putting out the light, they [s]tole [s]oftly down [s]tairs and out at the [s]treet door. Mrs. Harris knew where [s]he [s]hould find a [s]tand of nightcoaches, and proceeding there without mole[s]tation, they got into one, and drove to a decent looking hou[s]e in the Borough, the mi[s]tre[s]s of which readily admitted them, and Rebecca having offered up her thank[s]giving to the protector of innocence, retired to a homely but clean bed, and enjoyed [s]everal hours of uninterrupted repo[s]e. A NEW PLACE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] When Rebecca awoke [s]he found her[s]elf greatly refre[s]hed, and aro[s]e with a heart deeply impressed with gratitude to Mrs. Harris, who had thus unexpectedly delivered her from the wor[s]t of all evils. She went down [s]tairs, and as [s]he was taking her breakfast began to talk of what [s]he mu[s]t do in future. I had [s]ome intention of returning to my mother, ([s]aid [s]he) but I think now I had rather endeavour to get a place. I have but a tri[s]le in my pur[s]e, but by writing to Lincolnshire I can have my trunks returned, and I have [s]ome money in them, and I will beg your acceptance of part of it for the eminent [s]ervice you have rendered me; in the meantime I [s]hall be much obliged to you if you could recommend me to a place, if you heard of any thing which you thought would [s]uit me." Mrs. Harris and her friend gave our heroine a cordial invitation to remain with them till [s]he could hear from her mother, and promi[s]ed to inquire for a place which might [s]uit her abilities, as [s]he [s]eemed to wi[s]h to wait on a very young lady, or be companion to an elderly one, as [s]he was certain her con[s]titution would not [s]uffer her to engage with a woman of fa[s]hion, who kept a great deal of company and late hours, of which [s]he had experienced a [s]ufficient [s]pecimen in Lady O[s][s]iter. Rebecca addre[s][s]ed a letter to her mother, briefly informing her [s]he had left her Lady and was in que[s]t of another place. That [s]he had at fir[s]t intended to return home, and to that end had forwarded her trunk, which [s]he reque[s]ted might be [s]ent to town again by the fir[s]t conveyance. In about four days [s]he received the following an[s]wer. "DEAR CHILD, "I am [s]orry to find you have left Lady O[s][s]iter as I imagine you mu[s]t have gro[s]sly offended her Lady[s]hip [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] before [s]he could have parted with you, as you was [s]uch a favorite with her mother; however, Rebecca, you cho[s]e to leave your father's hou[s]e, and to conduct yourself by the advice of [s]trangers, you therefore know be[s]t child, what you are about; I [s]hall not take upon me to advi[s]e, where my advice will be di[s]regarded. As to coming into the country, I think it would be putting your[s]elf to a needle[s]s expence, as I know you would never be happy to [s]tay here: and [s]en[s]ible as I was of that, you cannot wonder I have cho[s]en a companion and protector for my[s]elf, and by uniting with the worthy Mr. Serle, have upon his daughter and family a claim to tho[s]e tenderne[s][s]es and attentions I in vain expected from my own child. Mr. Serle went to the inn and inquired for your trunk, but we can hear nothing of it; you mu[s]t therefore inquire for it at the inn from whence the coach [s]ets out in London. "As you always were, or pretended to be a little philo[s]opher, I have no doubt but you will get very well through the world; and you have youth and a good con[s]titution on your [s]ide. I [s]hall always be glad to hear of your welfare; above all things, Rebecca, be mode[s]t and virtuous, and mind your religious duties, as your poor father and I always taught you; and never forget that you have a mother who loves you, and to whom all your duty and re[s]pect is due. Mr. Serle and Mi[s]s Peggy de[s]ire me to give their be[s]t wi[s]hes to you, though they have no acquaintance with you. I am, dear child, Your affectionate mother, R. SERLE." Rebecca's [s]en[s]ations, on the receipt of this letter, are better imagined than de[s]cribed. Scarcely fix months had elap[s]ed [s]ince the death of her father, and her mother was married again---that mother, who, but a [s]hort time [s]ince, had declared, that to be [s]u[s]pected capable of admitting a [s]econd partner, was an in[s]ult that hurt her feelings exce[s][s]ively. Rebecca now felt that [s]he was in reality a poor solitary being, without a home, and almo[s]t without a friend; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] to be [s]ure Mrs. Harris had been very kind to her, but could [s]he expect that kindne[s]s to la[s]t when [s]he had lo[s]t the power of making her any recompen[s]e. However [s]he determined to make [s]ome inquiry concerning her trunk, and to that end reque[s]ted Mrs. Harris to accompany her; but all the tidings [s]he could learn was, that the coachman had left it in the country, and that he had [s]ince heard it had been taken away by a per[s]on who [s]aid he came from Mi[s]s Littleton her[s]elf, with orders to pay all nece[s][s]ary expences. "Was there any thing of much value in the trunk?" [s]aid Mrs. Harris. "Alas!" cried Rebecca, "there was the greate[s]t part of my clothes, and a five hundred pound bank note, which I had to keep for a per[s]on who is gone abroad." "Pray, child, what kind of a man is this father-in-law of your's?" "Indeed I can hardly tell you; he never vi[s]ited my father during his life, nor did I ever [s]ee him above twice, except at church; he has been a widower [s]ome years, and has one daughter; he is an attorney by profe[s][s]ion, but I believe he had never much practice." "Perhaps your mother's annuity was the object that invited this marriage." "It may be [s]o, but I can hardly think it, for at the utmo[s]t it is not more than forty pounds year. My mother has an agreeable per[s]on, and lively manner; I do not think it improbable but he may have married her for love." "I do not think it improbable but he has got your trunk." "Dear, Mrs. Harris, how can you [s]ugge[s]t [s]uch a thing; you quite [s]hock me." "Shock you or not, I think that is really the ca[s]e, and I would advi[s]e you to pur[s]ue legal methods to discover it." "No," cried Rebecca, re[s]olutely, "never; I cannot bring my[s]elf to [s]u[s]pect that my mother would unite her[s]elf to a man capable of [s]uch an action, and if that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] were really the ca[s]e, I hope I have too high a [s]en[s]e of [s]ilial re[s]pect to attempt expo[s]ing her to the malicious cen[s]ures of a world, who would not fail to involve her, however innocent, in her hu[s]band's guilt. My own interest [s]hall ever give way to her peace of mind, for [s]he was the cho[s]en companion, the bo[s]om friend of the be[s]t of fathers, and though [s]he [s]eems to have forgot that I am her child, I can never forget [s]he is my mother." "All this may be very clever, for what I know," [s]aid Mrs. Harris, "but I am [s]ure, in my opinion, it is very ridiculous. You will find, my poor [s]imple child, your [s]ix guineas will go but a little way towards buying you clothes fit for a decent place; however, we mu[s]t not meet troubles half way, it will be time enough when you have got a place, to think about preparing to go to it; but I have an acquaintance lives in this [s]treet, who perhaps may have it in her power to help you to [s]omething." They called on the per[s]on mentioned, who was lady's woman in an opulent merchant's family. Mrs. Harris mentioned Rebecca's intentions, and learnt that there was a country lady, then on a vi[s]it to this family, who had parted with her maid, and was in want of one to [s]upply her place. Rebecca thought [s]he could venture to take [s]uch a [s]ituation in a regular quiet family. She was introduced to the Lady, who, [s]truck with her lovely person and mode[s]t demeanour, conceived an in[s]tant prepossession in her favour, and engaged her, upon liberal terms, to enter her [s]ervice on that day week. Rebecca [s]elt extremely happy that [s]he [s]hould no longer be a burden upon the kind Mrs. Harris, and eagerly [s]et about preparing as well as the narrow [s]tate of her finances would allow, to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of her new place. Mrs. Barton (the name of Rebecca's mi[s]tre[s]s) was a plea[s]ing lively brunette, about twenty years old. She had married, when very young, contrary to the advice of her friends, a young man of [s]mall fortune and rather flightly character, but [s]he had twenty thou[s]and pounds at her own di[s]po[s]al, and her motto was, "All for love." Barton was really attached to her in the fir[s]t years of their marriage, but his temper was too ver[s]atile to belong [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] con[s]tant to any thing, he in time grew cool, and often played her fal[s]e, but [s]he was of [s]uch an even, cheerful, un[s]u[s]pecting temper, [s]o unaffectedly tender, [s]o attentive to his intere[s]t, and [s]tudious of his peace, that he found it impo[s][s]ible to treat her with unkindne[s]s, [s]o that there was always an appearance of much cordiality between them, for though [s]he could not [s]hut her eyes and ears upon his infidelities, [s]he wi[s]ely concluded it was prudent [s]ometimes to be wilfully deaf and blind, and that if good humour would not reclaim him, ill humour would certainly make him wor[s]e. With this couple Rebecca went into Shrop[s]hire, a few weeks after [s]he entered Mrs. Barton's [s]ervice. Their hou[s]e was a venerable gothic building, [s]ituated in the mid[s]t of a beautiful park, and had fallen to Mrs. Barton on the death of her godfather, from whom al[s]o [s]he inherited her independent fortune. Rebecca found herself much at her ea[s]e, Mrs. Barton was very kind to her, and finding [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed an intelligent mind, often made her the companion of her rambles about the grounds and adjacent country. Mr. Barton troubled his lady but little with his company, except at meals, and [s]ometimes not then: nay, he even went [s]o far as to [s]leep from home several nights in the week; and this being a liberty he had never before taken, without his wife being informed of the cau[s]e, [s]he felt her[s]elf really unca[s]y, and, though when he was pre[s]ent [s]he a[s][s]umed her u[s]ual cheerfulne[s]s, it was impo[s][s]ible to conquer her feelings, [s]o as not to let her chagrin and mortification appear to Rebecca, who [s]incerely pitied, and by every affiduity in her power, endeavoured to amu[s]e and entertain her. Mrs. Barton kept but little company; [s]he was fond of reading, drawing, mu[s]ic, and fancy works; in the[s]e [s]he discovered Rebecca's ta[s]te and knowledge, and many was the heavy hour [s]he beguiled in joining the labours of her lady, improving her judgment, and with the [s]weete[s]t diffidence and humility correcting her errors. In the mean time Lord O[s][s]iter provoked beyond mea[s]ure, that a [s]cheme he had imagined infallible, [s]hould have proved totally abortive, di[s]patched his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] faithful valet off to Lincoln[s]hire, in hopes to find the fair fugitive there, and get her once more into his power; but here he was again foiled; for though Rebecca had wrote to her mother, that [s]he had engaged with a Mrs. Barton, yet [s]he had not mentioned in what part of the country the family u[s]ually re[s]ided, [s]o that the faithful amba[s][s]ador returned to his di[s]appointed Lord without the lea[s]t conciliatory intelligence. SCHOOL FOR WIVES. The vi[s]its of Barton from home became now too long and too frequently repeated not to give his wife [s]erious cau[s]e for unea[s]ine[s]s; [s]he [s]ecretly re[s]olved to di[s]cover, if po[s][s]ible, to whom he devoted [s]o large a portion of his time. Now it [s]o happened, that about [s]even miles from Belle Park, on the [s]ide of a craggy hill, watered by an impetuous [s]tream, that ru[s]hed from the upper part of the declivity, [s]tood an old mill, and by the [s]ide of the mill [s]tood an old thatched cottage, within which lived an old couple, who had a very young and a very lovely grand daughter. Now, though this old man was the owner of the mill and cottage, and ground many a bu[s]hel of corn for his poor neighbours, of which he never failed to take his regular toll; yet it [s]o happened that he was but poor him[s]elf. The cottage, we have [s]aid, was old, [s]o that the chilling bla[s]ts of winter, and the scorching heats of [s]ummer found ea[s]y entrance through its [s]hattered frame; but Dolly, the blooming Dolly, was the pride of their hearts, and often as they [s]at smoaking their evening's pipe, they would gaze on her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] sparkling black eyes, ruddy complexion, and delicate [s]hape, and cry, "Ah, [s]urely that girl is born to be the comfort of our old age; [s]he is [s]o hand[s]ome, there is no doubt but [s]he will get a [s]quire for a hu[s]band, or, mayhap, the Lord of the Manor. Ah, ble[s]s the dear face of it, I [s]hall live to [s]ee her a great lady I warrant, and then it will [s]end [s]ome people to mend old grandad's cottage, and repair the crazy old mill." The[s]e were the waking dreams of doating age, for alas Dolly had reached her [s]eventeenth year and no [s]quire had yet made his appearance, to verify her grandmother's prophecy. However about this time one of Mr. Barton's footmen, a [s]mart lad, about nineteen years old, [s]aw this paragon of ru[s]tic beauty at a neighbouring fair, and, unfortunately for his ma[s]ter's hor[s]es, from that day whenever he was di[s]patched to the neighbouring town or villages, on me[s][s]ages, errands, or what not, he always found the old miller's cottage lay directly in the way between Belle Park and the place to which he was di[s]patched. One evening Mr. Barton having mounted his hor[s]e, and called Thomas to attend him in his intended excursion, being undetermined which way to go, a[s]ked the lad if he had di[s]covered lately any new ride, for, he [s]aid, I have gone the old track [s]o often I am weary of it. Thomas, full of the charms of Dolly, and eager to embrance the [s]malle[s]t opportunity of beholding them, or at lea[s]t the cottage that contained them, a[s]ked his master if he had ever rode by Gaffer Job[s]on's mill. 'Tis not above [s]even miles off, your honour, and is the [s]weete[s]t and romantice[s]t kind of a place, with trees and rocks and a river: then the mill is [s]o old, your honour, that it looks, for all the world, like the places we read about in [s]tory books. Barton [s]miled, and being directed by Thomas as to the road he was to take, cantered off, followed by the happy lover, exulting in the thought of [s]eeing his mistress, though it were but for a moment. But, perhaps, thought he, ma[s]ter may look at the place, and then I can [s]lip in for a minute, and ju[s]t [s]peak to Dolly. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] Alas poor Thomas thou art as blind as many other wi[s]e politicians, or thou would[s]t never have taken thy ma[s]ter to [s]ee the cottage and the mill. The [s]un was beginning to withdraw it[s]elf behind the hill tops, when Gaffer having lighted his pipe and Gammor [s]et by her wheel, had [s]eated them[s]elves on the [s]teps of their cottage, to talk over old times, and dream, as u[s]ual, of Dolly's good fortune. Dolly had ju[s]t tied on a clean coloured apron, [s]moothed back her luxuriant che[s]nut hair, and [s]eated beneath a tree not far di[s]tant from the door, was earne[s]tly contriving to di[s]po[s]e to the be[s]t advantage three yards of cherry-coloured ribbon which Thomas had given her, round a chip hat, in which [s]he thought to out[s]hine all her companions the next Sunday at church. Lifting her eyes from this very intere[s]ting employment, who [s]hould [s]he [s]ee but the identical Mr. Thomas and a fine young gentleman riding towards the mill. Up [s]he bounced. "See, [s]ee, grandad," [s]aid [s]he, eagerly, "[s]ee you fine gentleman and Mr. Thomas." She [s]poke loud, the evening was [s]erene; her voice vibrated on the ear of Barton; he turned his head, the old mill, the trees, and rocks were no longer intere[s]ting objects. "I will have a little chat with the old man," [s]aid he, guiding his hor[s]e that way, but his eyes were fixed on the lovely form of Dolly. He chatted with the old couple till it was nearly dark, and as he rode homeward could think only on the charms of their grand-daughter. The next evening he rode that way again, unattended, talked [s]omething about repairing the mill, and ki[s][s]ed Dolly at parting. Another and another interview [s]ucceeded. Thomas was con[s]tantly kept employed at home, and a few guineas, a new gown, and two or three glittering gewgaws had the power to bani[s]h him as entirely from Dolly's memory as though he had never held a place there. The [s]quire, as [s]he called him, occupied all her thought, and, awell-a-day for poor nature, the [s]quire triumphed over all the virtue Dolly ever po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. The old folks too wilfully [s]hut their eyes, and in li[s]tening to projected [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] repairs, and thinking of future pro[s]perity, forgot it was to be purcha[s]ed by the infamy of their grand-daughter. But Barton was by no means a liberal lover; he talked much but performed little, and though he [s]lept [s]everal nights in a week at Gaffer Job[s]on's, he was content to [s]leep on their homely mattra[s]s, nor once thought of providing another. Poor Thomas, mortified to the [s]oul, could not conceal his vexation, nor did he make a [s]ecret of the cau[s]e among his fellow [s]ervants. It was whi[s]pered from one to another, till at length it reached Mrs. Barton; not from Rebecca, for [s]he would not have told [s]uch a tale to a di[s]tre[s][s]ed wife, to obtain the highe[s]t con[s]ideration; [s]he would have feared the effect it would have had on her feelings, and agonized with the poor [s]ufferer in idea a thou[s]and times. But Mrs. Barton was a woman of spirit; [s]he felt her hu[s]band's neglect [s]everely, but [s]he would more [s]everely have felt the pity of her [s]ervants: [s]he took great care therefore not to appear to need it. "Do you know child," [s]aid [s]he to Rebecca, one day as [s]he was a[s][s]i[s]ting her to dre[s]s; "do you know, child, that this truant hu[s]band of mine is fallen in love with [s]ome chubby faced little chit in the neighbourhood, and prefers the company of her and her ignorant relations to my elegant [s]ociety, and their hard bed and coar[s]e [s]heets to his own made of down and covered with the fine[s]t holland: do you not think the man is turned fool?" She [s]aid this with [s]uch a [s]mile of good humour that Rebecca looked ar her with amazement, and he[s]itatingly replied, "he is certainly blind to his own happine[s]s, Madam." "Oh, no; I dare [s]ay the indulgence of the[s]e whims con[s]titutes what he calls happine[s]s, but I mu[s]t confe[s]s he [s]eems totally indifferent about mine, and as that is the ca[s]e, I [s]hall take what [s]teps I think proper to [s]ecure [s]ome for my[s]elf. Now I have a va[s]t de[s]ire to [s]ee this irre[s]i[s]table la[s]s of the mill, and as I know he dines at Mr. Thornhill's to day, this very afternoon I will pay her a vi[s]it and you [s]hall accompany me." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] Rebecca thought this an odd [s]tep, but [s]he had a very high opinion of Mrs. Barton's [s]en[s]e and prudence, and therefore prepared to attend her without intimating the lea[s]t di[s]approbation of the [s]cheme, which [s]he certainly would have ventured to do, had [s]he not been [s]atisfied that her lady had [s]ome very good rea[s]ons for her conduct. About four o'clock they [s]tepped into the chariot, and proceeded to the mill without any attendant. They left the carriage within a quarter of a mile of the cottage, and went thither on foot, pretended wearine[s]s, and a[s]ked leave to re[s]t and have a draught of water. "Would you like a little wine in your water, my Lady," [s]aid the old woman. "I [s]hould have hardly [s]uppo[s]ed," replied Mrs. Barton, "that your cottage afforded [s]uch a luxury." "Why, in good truth, we ne'er had [s]uch a thing before, and now Gaffer and I don't much care for drinking a'nt, we'd rather have a cup of yale; but the [s]quire that courts our Dolly [s]ent [s]ome that he may have a little now and then when he comes." "Your daughter is going to be married then." "'Tis my grand-daughter, my Lady," [s]aid the old woman, courte[s]ying. At that moment the back door opened and in bounced Dolly. She blu[s]hed, courte[s]yed awkwardly, and would have [s]poke but was at a lo[s]s what to [s]ay. Prepared as Mrs. Barton was to [s]ee [s]omething extremely lovely, the charms of this little ru[s]tic [s]urpa[s][s]ed her imagination. "What a lovely creature," [s]aid [s]he, [s]oftly, to Rebecca; "how could Barton be [s]o wantonly cruel as to contaminate the [s]oul which animates this beauteous form." The tears [s]tarted in her eyes as [s]he [s]poke, but bru[s]hed them away unperceived. "And [s]o my dear you are going to be married, I under[s]tand, and to a [s]quire. I have [s]ome idea he is a friend of mine. I believe he [s]pends much of his time here, but I think your accommodations are not very brilliant. You mu[s]t give me leave to [s]end you [s]ome better furniture, and to give orders to have your hou[s]e repaired; and [s]hould your lover inquire who it was ordered the[s]e things, tell him it was a lady who has a great regard for him, and lives at the old fa[s]hioned hou[s]e in the park. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] Manifold were the courte[s]ys and awkward acknowledgments poured forth by the grand-mother and Dolly, but Mrs. Barton imagined [s]he [s]aw in the countenance of the latter mingled [s]hame and regret. "If we could [s]ave this poor girl," [s]aid [s]he to Rebecca, when they were [s]eated again in the carriage; "if we could [s]ave her and teach her the value of the gem [s]he has uncon[s]ciou[s]ly thrown away, we might then lead her back to virtue, and, [s]pite of her errors, [s]he may yet become a valuable member of [s]ociety." The carriage drove to the neare[s]t town, when Mrs. Barton went to an uphol[s]terer's and ordered whatever [s]he thought nece[s][s]ary, to be taken immediately to the cottage; [s]he likewi[s]e engaged a carpenter to [s]end people the next day, to begin the repairs, and on returning home [s]he di[s]patched a large bundle of [s]heets, table linen, &c. by a poor labourer who knew nothing of the reports current in the family. Rebecca ea[s]ily [s]aw her Lady's de[s]ign, and almo[s]t trembled for the event, indeed Mrs. Barton her[s]elf could [s]carcely have been le[s]s agitated. That night Barton returned late, and having a large party to dine next day, it was impo[s][s]ible for him to vi[s]it his fair Dulcinea till the en[s]uing morning, and then, ju[s]t as he was going, a gentleman arrived from town and detained him till after dinner. "I [s]hall not be at home to-night, Bet[s]ey," [s]aid he, as he mounted his hor[s]e; "I have an engagement with two or three jovial fellows, and [s]hall not like to ride home late." Mrs. Barton [s]miled, I wi[s]h you a plea[s]ant evening," [s]aid [s]he, "and as I am [s]ure of your being out of the way I will [s]end for my gallant." "You threaten well Bet[s]ey, but I have too good an opinion of you to fear their execution." "Tea and [s]upper was [s]erved without Mrs. Barton being any the better for them; [s]he became violently agitated; Rebecca was [s]ummoned to attend her, but alas Rebecca could not comfort her. The clock had ju[s]t [s]truck eleven when the bell at the great gate was rung with violence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] "He is returned," [s]aid [s]he, "and a few minutes will now decide my fate. My good Rebecca leave me." Barton entered the room with the looks of a condemned criminal. "Bet[s]ey," [s]aid he, "where were you the day before ye[s]terday, and how did you employ your time?" "Not in a manner di[s]agreeable to you, I hope," [s]aid [s]he, mildly; "I had heard how partial you were to [s]leeping at the mill cottage, and I took a ride to [s]ee if you were well accommodated; but I found the bed intolerable, and the hou[s]e in [s]uch a mi[s]erable [s]late I thought you ran great ri[s]ques of getting cold, [s]o, being unwilling to lo[s]e you, I thought it was my duty, as a good wife, to provide you with better conveniences." "My dear Bet[s]ey how can you talk thus calm, when you know all my weakne[s]s---when you know how I have injured you?" "Barton," [s]aid [s]he, with a firm look and voice, "I am not now to learn that I am no longer beloved; but it was no rea[s]on becau[s]e you had grown weary of home, you [s]hould trifle away your life by [s]leeping in a place almo[s]t entirely open to nightly dews, and un[s]heltered even by curtains to your bed. But mark me, my dear Barton, that I love you, I tru[s]t you have had innumerable inconte[s]table proofs; but if I am no longer beloved, if my [s]ociety and endearments can no longer give you plea[s]ure, let us part; why [s]hould you deprive your[s]elf of the comforts and conveniences of life; let our fortune be divided; leave me to [s]olitude and quiet in this place, and take your favourite to the Elms. But I charge you, Barton delay not a day to make her a proper [s]ettlement, left you hereafter grow weary of her, and fall a victim to poverty and infamy: is a beauteous flower, pity it is [s]he was ever tran[s]planted into the garden of folly." "Bet[s]ey," [s]aid he, dropping on his knees before her, and taking both her hands, "Bet[s]ey, you are an angel, and I am totally unworthy your forgivene[s]s: I [s]ee my doom, I [s]ee my folly has bani[s]hed all the tenderne[s]s of your heart, and you wi[s]h to be [s]eparated from a wretch who has treated you [s]o unworthily." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] "You are mi[s]taken, Barton, if you think I wi[s]h to be [s]eparated from you, could I once more be the mi[s]tre[s]s of your affections; to live with you, to love you, to promote your happine[s]s would be the plea[s]ure of my life, but I cannot have a divided heart; if another is preferred, let me not, by con[s]tantly witne[s][s]ing your indifference toward my[s]elf, [s]uffer pains too acute to be borne without complaining." "Oh Bet[s]ey! deare[s]t girl, forgive me, and take my whole, my undivided heart; do with it what you plea[s]e, it never [s]hall again wander from you, its cho[s]en mistress." Mrs. Barton could no longer combat the impul[s]e of her throbbing heart, [s]he dropped her head on the forehead of her repentant hu[s]band, and tears of un[s]eigned joy ratified their reconciliation. "But what mu[s]t we do with poor Dolly," [s]aid [s]he, after a pau[s]e of a few moments. "I commit her to your care, my love," replied Barton, "[s]en[s]ible that you will do whatever is be[s]t for her future well doing,---for my part, I will never [s]ee her again." "Nay, Barton, keep your pa[s][s]ions under the guidance of rea[s]on, and you may [s]ee her without danger." THE VOYAGE. Mrs. Barton let no time elap[s]e in merely forming plans for Dolly. She took an opportunity to found Thomas's [s]entiments concerning her, and found the poor lad as deeply in love as ever; "And would you be willing to marry her, Thomas, provided the mill was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] repaired and [s]he had a few acres of ground well [s]tocked?" Thomas replied in the affirmative, and Dolly being found no ways unwilling to comply, a few weeks made them man and wife; Barton de[s]iring his Lady to [s]pare no expence nece[s][s]ary to make them quite comfortable, and literally kept his promi[s]e of never [s]eeing Dolly again. But though his re[s]olves, in regard to future constancy were [s]eriou[s]ly made, his heart was compo[s]ed of [s]uch inflammable matter, that he no [s]ooner began to contemplate the una[s][s]uming charms of Rebecca, which, from being much at home, he had now [s]ufficient lei[s]ure to do, than he found him[s]elf puzzled to keep his good resolutions; and being unaccu[s]tomed to combat his inclinations, he found this fir[s]t attempt at [s]elf-conque[s]t too painful to be per[s]evered in: and Mrs. Barton, with anguish of heart, [s]aw he was again relap[s]ing into indifference and incon[s]tancy. Rebecca too [s]aw, with evident di[s]plea[s]ure, the many opportunities he took of throwing him[s]elf in her way. It was [s]ometimes impo[s][s]ible to avoid li[s]tening to him on a [s]ubject which filled her with di[s]gu[s]t and [s]orrow. He offered her [s]everal valuable trinkets, which [s]he re[s]olutely refu[s]ed to accept; but at length his behaviour became [s]o unequivocal, that Rebecca determined to quit her amiable mi[s]tre[s]s, however unwilling to relinqui[s]h a situation in which [s]he had enjoyed [s]o much tranquillity. Mrs. Barton quickly di[s]covered the motives of our heroine's intention, and honoured her for them. "You are a truly amiable girl, Rebecca," [s]aid [s]he, "and I will not part with you till I can recommend you to [s]ome per[s]on who will be [s]en[s]ible of your value." The next morning Mrs. Barton informed her that, during a vi[s]it [s]he had made the preceding afternoon, [s]he had heard of a [s]ituation which [s]he thought might prove highly advantageous to her. "But perhaps," continued [s]he, "you would not like to leave England." "All places are alike to me," [s]aid Rebecca; "I have [s]o very few friends who intere[s]t them[s]elves at all in my welfare, that provided my mother gives her a[s][s]ent, I can [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] have no objection to quitting a place where every tie is broken that once rendered it mo[s]t dear to me." "Well then," [s]aid Mrs. Barton, "there is a young lady who has been in England for her education; [s]he is now about [s]ixteen years old, of an amiable temper, and highly accompli[s]hed. Her father, who re[s]ides in America, has [s]ent for her home, and her governe[s]s has been inquiring for a prudent well educated young per[s]on to accompany her. The terms offered are fifty guineas, and all expences paid, and [s]hould you not approve residing there, on your arrival, they will pay your pa[s][s]age back again. "Colonel Abthorpe is a man of large fortune; he has formerly [s]erved in the army, but at the conclu[s]ion of the war re[s]igned his commi[s][s]ion, and retired to America, his lady being a native of that place. Mi[s]s Abthorpe goes out in about fix weeks, and if you [s]hould like to accompany her, I have no doubt but you are the kind of per[s]on that will [s]uit her." Rebecca was plea[s]ed with the propo[s]al; [s]he waited on the lady with whom Mi[s]s Abthorpe had been educated, and was highly approved of, both by her and the young lady her[s]elf. She then wrote to her mother, and in a few po[s]ts received a letter dictated by her mother, but wrote by her [s]i[s]ter-in-law, and written in [s]uch cold [s]lighting terms that [s]he ea[s]ily [s]aw they would be glad to have her [s]o far from them, that there might be no danger of her coming home, in ca[s]e of [s]ickne[s]s or other contingencies; [s]he therefore took leave of the amiable Mrs. Barton, who could not part from her without tears, and who pre[s]ented her with [s]everal valuable memorials of her friend[s]hip. The day after Rebecca entered Mi[s]s Abthorpe's [s]ervice [s]he [s]et off for London, where [s]he was to join Mr. Seward's family, who were to embark on board the [s]ame [s]hip with her, and under who[s]e protection [s]he was to proceed to New-England. It was late in September when they arrived in town, and a variety of incidents detained them till the middle of October, [s]o that they had but an untoward pro[s]pect before them, when [s]o late in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] the [s]ea[s]on they embarked at Deal, on board a brig bound for Bo[s]ton. A fair wind pre[s]ently took them out of the channel, and they flattered them[s]elves with a pro[s]perous voyage; but the[s]e flattering appearances were [s]oon rever[s]ed, for the wind [s]uddenly changed, ri[s]ing almo[s]t to a hurricane, [s]o that it was impo[s][s]ible to pur[s]ue their intended cour[s]e or return to port, and they continued to[s][s]ing about in the Atlantic till the latter end of December, and then had not half made their pa[s][s]age, though their provi[s]ion was [s]o exhau[s]ted that they were obliged to live on a very [s]mall allowance of bread; water and [s]alt meat they had, and a few pea[s]e, but of the[s]e they were extremely careful. Poor Rebecca heartily wi[s]hed her[s]elf on [s]hore again, but [s]en[s]ible tho[s]e wi[s]hes were unavailing, [s]he confined them to her own bo[s]om, and exerted her[s]elf to [s]upport the [s]pirits of Mi[s]s Abthorpe, who, naturally delicate and unaccu[s]tomed to fatigue, was nearly exhau[s]ted with terror, con[s]inement and hunger. In a few weeks they were reduced almo[s]t to extremities; they had not even a candle to light the binnacle, which contains the compass, and the whole of their allowance now amounted to one bi[s]cuit and half a pint of water per day each person. Mr. Seward had on board the [s]hip with him, besides two fine boys, the one fourteen the other twelve years old, a charming little girl [s]carcely [s]even. Mrs. Seward had been dead [s]ome years, and the child was accompanied by her nur[s]e. The chief angui[s]h this faithful [s]ervant felt was in contemplating her little charge, and thinking how [s]he was to be pre[s]erved; indeed, to [s]uch a height did her affection ri[s]e, that [s]he voluntarily deprived her[s]elf of part of the very [s]mall portion of bread allotted her, that [s]he might lay it by again[s]t a time of more eminent nece[s][s]ity for this darling of her heart. It was a clear cold day, the wind blowing [s]trongly again[s]t them, when the ma[s]ter of the ve[s][s]el entered the cabin with a [s]mile. A [s]mile at that particular time was received by all as a good omen, for [s]eldom had [s]uch a thing been [s]een in their melancholy party. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] "There is a [s]hip bearing down towards us," [s]aid he. "I have made a [s]ignal of di[s]tre[s]s, and no doubt we [s]hall be relieved." Hope, [s]weet [s]olace of the wretched, played round the hearts of his auditors as he pronounced the[s]e words; and all who were able crawled upon the deck to watch, with eager eyes, the near approaches of the expected relief. The ve[s][s]el drew nigh, and the ma[s]ter enquired what was the matter. "We are in the utmo[s]t di[s]tre[s]s," [s]aid Mr. Seward, who took upon him to an[s]wer. "We have been ten weeks at [s]ea, our provi[s]ious are exhau[s]ted, and we are in danger of [s]tarving." "I am [s]orry for it," replied the ma[s]ter of the other ve[s][s]el; "but though we have a good wind now, we do not know how [s]oon it may change, and we may want our provi[s]ions our[s]elves." It was in vain to attempt a reply; the ve[s][s]el was again put before the wind, and in a few moments the intervening billows, which ro[s]e to a tremendous height, hid her from their view. Silent and [s]ad the di[s]heartened mariners and pa[s][s]engers left the deck. Mr. Seward took his little girl in his arms, his two boys hung on each [s]ide of him; he endeavored at a look of fortitude, but the gu[s]hing tears betrayed the angui[s]h of the paternal heart. Rebecca [s]eated her[s]elf on her bed, Mi[s]s Abthorpe looked up in her face for comfort, but [s]he had none to offer; [s]he [s]ighed and re[s]ted her head on Rebecca's [s]houlder. "What [s]hall we do," [s]aid [s]he, mournfully. "Tru[s]t in God," replied Rebecca, faintly, pre[s][s]ing her hand. Mi[s]s Abthorpe returned the pre[s][s]ure, and they joined in [s]ervently committing them[s]elves to the protecting care of him who could [s]ave to the uttermo[s]t. Ten days more pa[s][s]ed on in this dreadful manner, when another ve[s][s]el was di[s]covered, but, alas! Hope refu[s]ed to cheer their bo[s]oms with the fainte[s]t ray. "We mu[s]t make an attempt to move their compassion, however," [s]aid the ma[s]ter. Mr. Seward a[s][s]ented [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] to the propo[s]al, and they mounted the deck together; but Rebecca and her young lady [s]at pen[s]ive and [s]ilent; they hardly dared to hope, and the [s]weet comforts of religion forbade them to de[s]pair. The noi[s]e on the deck prevented their hearing what was [s]aid, or whether any an[s]wer was returned to their entreaties. In a few moments the noi[s]e increa[s]ed almost to tumult, a confu[s]ed [s]hout broke forth, which the poor li[s]tening females mi[s]took for a murmur of horror and di[s]appointment. "They have refu[s]ed us," cried Mi[s]s Abthorpe, endeavouring to ri[s]e from her bed. "I am afraid they have indeed," [s]aid Rebecca; but "do not you attempt to go on deck---[s]tay here and I will go and enquire." With tremulous and unequal [s]teps after repeated attempts, Rebecca reached the gangway. She was ju[s]t trying to mount the [s]teps, when her intent was fru[s]trated by a [s]udden motion of the [s]hip, and [s]he fell down. "Heaven pre[s]erve me!" [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he [s]lowly aro[s]e. "Heaven has pre[s]erved us all," [s]aid Mr. Seward, as he de[s]cended the [s]teps," for look, my good girl, what a dinner its bounty has [s]ent us." At that moment a [s]trange [s]ailor came down with a large wooden bowl, in which was a fine piece of boiled beef, [s]ome potatoes, and a pea[s]e pudding. "God ble[s]s your pretty hearts," [s]aid the [s]ailor, looking round at Rebecca, Mi[s]s Abthorpe, and the young Sewards, "come fall too and lay in a good cargo for according to the log your are light enough now.", "You have robbed your[s]elves, I fear," [s]aid Rebecca; "this was intended for your dinners." "That is neither here nor there," [s]aid he, putting a large quid of tobacco in his mouth; and [s]plit my top[s]ails if I would not rather rob my[s]elf any time than [s]ee a brother [s]ailor want a dinner. D --- e we [s]oon emptied the copper when we heard how clo[s]e hauled you were, and [s]et old [s]toke gally to work to cook more; we brought enough for all, and they have fallen too above board like a parcel of hungry [s]harks."

The freindly [s]ailors now departed, having taken an inventory of what was mo[s]t requi[s]ite for the releif of their brethern, and in about an hour and a half returned with their captain, and a [s]upply of bread, chee[s]e, meat, butter, and candles, al[s]o a [s]mall quantity of [s]pirituous liquors to refre[s]h the [s]ailors. "We mu[s]t give you a bill on the owners," [s]aid Mr. Seward, when he had taken an account of the [s]tores brought on board. "No," replied the generous captain, "I [s]hall take no bill. I expect no reward. I may one day be in the [s]ame [s]ituation, and have only done as I would be done by." [1] Exalted humanity, noble, di[s]intere[s]ted [s]ailor, may you ever experience from your fellow creatures the [s]ame benevolence that expands and elevates your own heart. May your days be many and your pro[s]perity equal to your de[s]erts. Having taken a grateful leave of their benefactor, they, with renovated [s]pirits, pur[s]ued their voyage, and the wind changing in the cour[s]e of a few days, drove them rapidly towards their de[s]ired haven, [s]o that on the twenty eighth of January, about two in the afternoon, they heard the joyful [s]ound of "Land a head." The port of Bo[s]ton is [s]ituated in [s]uch a manner, that, after having made land, [s]ix or [s]even hours good [s]ailing will take a ve[s][s]el into [s]afe harbour, [s]o that our weary [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] voyagers began to think of landing that evening, however late it might be when they arrived; but as the night came on, the wind increa[s]ed, accompanied by [s]now and [s]leet; the cold at the [s]ame time being inten[s]e, it fro[s]e as it fell, and in a very [s]hort period the ropes about the [s]hip were [s]o inca[s]ed with ice, that they became immoveable; the darkne[s]s increa[s]ed, and to add to their di[s]tre[s]s, they lo[s]t [s]ight of the light hou[s]e at the entrance of the harbour. Their [s]ituation was now imminently dangerous: driving before the wind, among a multitude of rocks and breakers, without the lea[s]t chance of avoiding them: to be [s]hipwrecked in the very [s]ight of home, was a painful trial indeed, yet this was what all expected, and for which all endeavoured to prepare them[s]elves with patient re[s]ignation. About ten o'clock all their fears were realized, and a [s]udden [s]hock convinced them they had [s]truck on [s]ome rocks. The en[s]uing [s]cene from that time till [s]even the next morning is better imagined than de[s]cribed, for till that time they had no pro[s]pect of relief, but continued beating on the rocks, the waves wa[s]hing over them, and expecting momentary di[s][s]olution. As the day-light advanced they di[s]covered the i[s]land from which the reef ran, to be inhabited [2] . Several mu[s]kets were immediately di[s]charged, and [s]ignals hung out, and about eight o'clock they di[s]covered people coming to their a[s][s]i[s]tance. It was impo[s][s]ible to bring a boat near the ve[s][s]el, but the tide beginning to leave her, the men waded into the water, and placed a ladder again[s]t her [s]ide, down which the fear of immediate death gave Mi[s]s Abthrope and Rebecca courage to de[s]cend; but what were the feelings of Mr. Seward, when he found the impo[s][s]ibility of his little daughter's going down, [s]o dangerous was it rendered by the ice that enveloped the [s]teps of the ladder, and from whence, if [s]he fell, [s]he mu[s]t have been da[s]hed to pieces or lo[s]t among the rocks; nor did he dare to venture to de[s]cend him[s]elf with her in his arms, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] le[s]t a fal[s]e [s]tep or [s]lip might de[s]troy them both. But there was no time for much deliberation, as it was absolutely nece[s][s]ary to leave the [s]hip before the tide returned. At length an old [s]ailor offered an expedient which was thought fea[s]eable; and the agitated parent fa[s]tened a [s]trong cord round the wai[s]t of his child, by which he lowered her down the [s]ide of the ve[s][s]el; the old [s]ailor caught her in his arms, and bore her exultingly to the [s]hore. A new world now opened on Rebecca, who, when [s]he was a little recovered, beheld with a[s]toni[s]hment how every object was bound in the frigid chains of winter. The harbour, which [s]he could [s]ee from the hou[s]e on the i[s]land, was one continued [s]heet of ice. The face of the country was entirely covered with [s]now, and from the appearance of all around [s]he could form no probable hope of getting to Colonel Abthorpe's till the genial influence of [s]pring [s]hould unbind their fetters; but in this [s]he was agreeably mi[s]taken, for the inhabitants of tho[s]e cold climates being accu[s]tomed to the weather, were quick in expedients to facilitate their conveyance from one place to another. The very next morning a boat was procured, and men being placed at the head, to break the ice as they proceeded. By two o'clock, on the thirtieth of January, our heroine found her[s]elf once more on terra firma, comfortably [s]eated before a large wood fire, in Colonel Abthorpe's parlour; for during their voyage Mi[s]s Abthurpe had conceived [s]uch an e[s]teem for her, that [s]he in[s]i[s]ted on her being con[s]idered as her friend and [s]i[s]ter, and her parents had too high a re[s]pect for their daughter, to wi[s]h to contradict [s]o laudable a de[s]ire. [1] This apo[s]trophe is the genuine emotion of gratitude, the author having in a [s]ituation [s]imilar to the one de[s]cribed here, experienced relief be[s]towed in the [s]ame di[s]intere[s]ted manner. [2] Lovel's I[s]land. ON THE OTHER SIDE THE ATLANTIC. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] On the left hand of the entrance of Bo[s]ton harbour is a beautiful little penin[s]ula, called N---; it con[s]i[s]ts of two gradually ri[s]ing hills, beautifully diversified with orchards, corn-fields and pa[s]ture land. In the valley is built a little village, con[s]i[s]ting of about fifty hou[s]es, the inhabitants of which could ju[s]t make [s]hift to decently [s]upport a mini[s]ter, who on a Sunday a[s]cended the pulpit in a ru[s]tic temple, [s]ituated by the [s]ide of a large piece of water, nearly in the middle of the village, and taught, to the utmo[s]t of his abilities, the true principles of chri[s]tianity. The neck of land which joins this penin[s]ula to the main is extremely narrow, and indeed is [s]ometimes almo[s]t overflown by the tide. On one [s]ide it forms a charmingly picture[s]que harbour, in which are a variety of [s]mall but delightfully fertile i[s]lands, and on the other it is wa[s]hed by the ocean, to which it lays open. In this enchanting village [s]tood Mr. Abthorpe's hou[s]e, in the mid[s]t of a neat and well cultivated garden; and here it was that, as the [s]pring advanced, our contemplative heroine beheld with rapture the rapid progre[s]s of the infant vegitation; for the earth [s]eemed hardly releafed from the fleecy garb of winter, before it bur[s]t forth in the full bloom of vernal pride. In this agreeable [s]ituation Rebecca remained nearly two years, enjoying as much felicity as [s]he could expect in the friend[s]hip of Mr. and Mrs. Abthorpe and the affection of their amiable daughter. It is true [s]he sometimes [s]ighed when [s]he thought of Sir George Worthy--- [s]ometimes gazed on his portrait and that of his mother's, till her eyes overflowing could no longer di[s]tingui[s]h them. But the[s]e were luxuries, too dangerous to be often indulged, they only [s]erved to enervate her mind, and render her incapable of enjoying the ble[s][s]ings placed within her reach, and led her to repine at the wife [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] difpensations of Providence; [s]he therefore exerted her natural good [s]en[s]e to keep the[s]e acute [s]en[s]ibilities within proper re[s]trictions, and by [s]triving to be happy in her pre[s]ent [s]ituation, in a great mea[s]ure rendered her[s]elf really [s]o. She had many admirers, and might have entered into matrimonial engagements greatly to her advantage, but [s]he re[s]olutely re[s]u[s]ed them all, [s]till maintaining towards each that invariable politene[s]s and frankne[s]s of demeanor, as at the [s]ame moment extinguished their tenderer hopes and yet conciliated their e[s]teem. In the cour[s]e of this time [s]he had received two letters from Mrs. Barton, and one from her mother; the former informed her, that her hu[s]band was entirely reclaimed, that [s]he was the happie[s]t woman in the creation, and that [s]he hoped [s]he [s]hould one day have Rebecca a witne[s]s to her felicity; the contents of the latter was not [s]o plea[s]ing; her mother complained of ill treatment from her daughter-in-law, and extravagance in her husband; at the [s]ame time [s]he informed her, [s]he had ju[s]t lain in of a boy, who [s]he hoped would be the comfort of her old age. "I wi[s]h to heaven he may," [s]aid Rebecca, then laying down the letter and reflecting how many leagues [s]he was from her only [s]urviving parent; that perhaps [s]he might be in heavy affliction, ill treated by tho[s]e on whom [s]he had placed the firme[s]t reliance, laughed at by the world, and not unlikely pinched by poverty. The gentle-hearted girl bur[s]t into tears; "Ah!" [s]aid [s]he, "why did I leave my native country; I [s]hould have remembered that my poor mother had no real friend but me, on whom [s]he could [s]afely rely for comfort in sickness or affliction; I [s]hould have remembered, that though [s]he had preferred the friend[s]hip of others to mine, it was [s]till my duty not to leave her expo[s]ed to misfortunes which my pre[s]ence and tender a[s][s]iduties might have alleviated." About this time the unhappy breach between Great Britain and her colonies aro[s]e to [s]uch a height, that it never could be healed, and war, in her mo[s]t frightful [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] [s]hape, began to [s]talk over this once happy land. Ere this, the inhabitants of New-England, by their hospitality and primitive [s]implicity of manners, revived in the mind of our heroine the golden age, [s]o celebrated by poets. Here were no locks or bolts required, for each one, content with his own cot, coveted not the possessions of his neighbour; here [s]hould a [s]tranger make his appearance in their little village, though unknown by all, every one was eager to [s]hew him the mo[s]t civility, inviting him to their hou[s]es, and treating him with every delicacy the [s]implicity of their manner of living afforded. The only hou[s]e of entertainment in this village, had [s]carcely cu[s]tom [s]ufficient to [s]upply its venerable mi[s]tre[s]s with the nece[s][s]aries of life; but [s]he had a garden, a cow, and a few acres of land; the produce of the[s]e were [s]ufficient to her wants and wi[s]hes, and [s]he would [s]it in her matted arm chair, in a room who[s]e only beauty was "the white-wa[s]hed wall, the nicely [s]anded floor," while the [s]mile of content played about her face, and while [s]he thankfully enjoyed the bounties of heaven, [s]he remembered not that any could be richer or happier than her[s]elf. But when fell di[s]cord [s]pread her [s]able pinions and [s]hook her curling [s]nakes, how [s]oon this bli[s]s[s]ul pro[s]pect was rever[s]ed; frighted at the horrid din of arms, hospitality fled her once favourite abode, mutual confidence was no more, and fraternal love gave place to jealou[s]y, diffen[s]ion, and blind party zeal. The [s]on rai[s]ed his unhallowed arm again[s]t his parent, brothers drenched their weapons in each other's blood, and all was horror and confu[s]ion. The terrified inhabitants of N--- left the village and took refuge in the more interior parts of the country, all but Colonel Abthorpe's family, who [s]till remained, though de[s]erted by all their [s]ervants; for the Colonel had too high a regard for his royal ma[s]ter to join the cau[s]e of his enemies, and it was impossible to join the Briti[s]h troops without relinqui[s]hing all his property; he therefore hoped the [s]torm would [s]oon pa[s]s over; that [s]ome method would be propo[s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] and accepted to conciliate matters, and in the mean time he wi[s]hed to remain neuter. It was a [s]till morning about the latter end of July, when Rebecca, being di[s]turbed by [s]ome little ru[s]tling at her window, rai[s]ed her head, and by the [s]aint dawn that ju[s]t glimmered from the ea[s]t, di[s]covered armed men placed round the hou[s]e. Alarmed, [s]he [s]tarted from her bed and awoke Mi[s]s Abthorpe; they threw a few clothes over them and flew to the Colonel's apartment. They were met by Mrs. Abthorpe, who caught her daughter in her arms, and, pointing to the room where they u[s]ually [s]lept, cried, "Look Sophia, your poor father." Mi[s]s Abthorpe looked and beheld two [s]oldiers with firelocks, who placed at the door of the apartment, held her father a pri[s]oner. "Ah, my dear mother," [s]aid [s]he, "who are the[s]e, and what are they going to do; [s]urely, [s]urely they will not murder us." "Don't frighten your[s]elf, Mi[s]s," [s]aid one of the officers, "we do not u[s]ually murder [s]uch pretty girls." "But my father," cried [s]he, eagerly, "what do you intend to do with him." "Set him at liberty again when our expedition is over." Rebecca now learnt that the[s]e were a part of the American army, who had come to N--- in whaleboats, with a de[s]ign of dragging their boats acro[s]s the beach before mentioned, and proceeding to the light hou[s]e at the entrance of the harbour, intending to de[s]troy it, in order to mi[s]lead the expected relief that was coming to Bo[s]ton which was at that time blockaded: they had before made an un[s]ucce[s]sful attempt to demoli[s]h this light-hou[s]e, and were now come re[s]olved not to leave their work unfini[s]hed; accordingly they proceeded as quiet as po[s][s]ible to the beach, almo[s]t carried their boats over, and arrived totally unexpected at the little i[s]land on which the light-hou[s]e [s]tood, and which was guarded by a party of marines. A [s]mart [s]kirmi[s]h en[s]ued, but the Americans were too numerous to be with[s]tood by [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] [s]mall a party; the whole of which they either killed or took pri[s]oners; and having completed their de[s]ign, returned to N---, victorious, though in the utmo[s]t con[s]ternation, for fear of being pur[s]ued by boats from the Lively frigate, and other [s]hips that lay in the harbour. Rebecca was [s]tanding at a window as they relanded, the tears [s]treaming down her pale face, and [s]o entirely ab[s]orbed in terror that [s]he was inattentive to the surrounding objects. From this [s]tate of torpor [s]he was arou[s]ed by a deep groan, and rai[s]ing her eyes, [s]aw two Americans entering the hou[s]e, bearing between them a wounded marine, whom they laid on the floor, and were preparing to depart, when Mrs. Abthorpe ru[s]hed out of the adjoining apartment. "What are you doing?" [s]aid [s]he, "you will not [s]urely leave him here." `D---n him," cried a wretch, "he is in our way; if he don't die quickly we will kill him." "Oh, do not kill me!" [s]aid the almo[s]t expiring soldier; "I am not fit to die." At this moment Major Tupper entered: Mrs. Abthorpe addre[s][s]ed him in a [s]upplicating accent; "We can procure the poor [s]oul no affi[s]tance," [s]aid [s]he; "he will peri[s]h for want of proper applications to [s]tanch the blood." "My dear madam," [s]aid the Major, "what can we do; we fear pur[s]uit, and mu[s]t retreat as fa[s]t as po[s][s]ible, and [s]hould we take him with us, in our hurry and confusion he will perhaps be precipitated into eternity. If we make a [s]afe retreat I will [s]end to morrow." He then departed, and Colonel Abthorpe being now at liberty, turned his thoughts toward the wounded [s]oldier. He had fainted, a mattre[s]s was laid on the ground, and as they all united in endeavouring to remove him upon it, the motion increa[s]ed the angui[s]h of his wounds, and recalled his languid [s]en[s]es. "Oh, Spare me! do not kill me!" [s]aid he looking round with a terrified a[s]pect. "Be comforted," [s]aid the colonel; "you are among friends, who will do all in their power to [s]ave your life." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] "God will reward you," [s]aid he, faintly. They now examined the wound, and found, from its depth and [s]ituation, that a few hours would terminate the exi[s]tence of the poor [s]ufferer: however they made long bandages of linen, and with pledgets dipped in spirits, endeavoured to [s]tanch the bleeding, but in vain. "I am very faint," [s]aid he. Rebecca knelt and [s]upported him in her arms, a[s][s]i[s]ted by the weeping Sophia. "Can I live, think you, Sir?" [s]aid he, looking wi[s]hfully in the Colonel's face. "I fear not," was the reply. "God's will be done," [s]aid he; but I have a long account to [s]ettle, and but a [s]hort time to do it in. Dear good Chri[s]tians, pray with me---pray for me. Alas, it is an awful thing to die, and with the weight of murder on my con[s]cience." Here he grew faint again and cea[s]ed to [s]peak. A cordial was admini[s]tered--- he revived. "You [s]ee before you, my kind friends," [s]aid he "a mo[s]t unhappy man, the victim of his own folly. My father is a clergyman in the North of England; I am his only child, and have received from him an education [s]uitable to the [s]tation in which he meant to have placed me, which was the church; but, alas, I de[s]pi[s]ed his precepts, and joined my[s]elf to a [s]et of the mo[s]t di[s][s]olute companions, with whom I ran into every [s]pecies of vice and debauchery. By repeated extravagance I involved my poor father, who, no longer able to [s]upply my exhorbitant demands, remon[s]trated again[s]t my way of life; but I was too much attached to vice to re[s]olve to quit it, and in a fit of de[s]peration, having lo[s]t more money than I could pay, I enli[s]ted into a regiment bound for this place. Ah, Sir, I have rea[s]on to think my conduct [s]hortened the period of my dear mother's exi[s]tence, and I have embittered the la[s]t hours of a father whom it was my duty to comfort and [s]upport. The[s]e are heavy clogs upon my departing [s]oul, but he who witnesseth the [s]incerity of my repentance, I tru[s]t will compassonate and pardon me." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] "No doubt of it," cried Rebecca, who[s]e heart was almo[s]t bur[s]ting as [s]he li[s]tened to the expiring penitent. He looked round, and fixing his eyes on Rebecca and Sophia, "Poor girls," [s]aid he, "you are but young, take the advice of a dying [s]inner, and trea[s]ure it in your memories: obey your parents, never for[s]ake them, and [s]hun vicious company, for had I done this it would have been well with me in this evil day." Rebecca's [s]u[s]ceptible heart [s]mote her, [s]he hid her face with her handkerchief, and [s]ighed deeply. "God for ever ble[s]s you, my friends," [s]aid he; "I am going, a few pangs more, and all will be over. Oh, may he who[s]e fatal aim took my life have it not remembered again[s]t him; may the Father of mercy forgive him as freely as I do." He then began to repeat the Lord's Prayer, but expired before he could fini[s]h it. "Peace to his repentant [s]pirit," [s]aid the Colonel, as he rai[s]ed his weeping daughter from her knees. "His poor father," [s]aid [s]he, "what would he feel, did he know this." "He felt more," replied the Colonel, when the misguided youth for[s]ook the paths of virtue, than he would, could he even behold him now. The heat at this [s]ea[s]on of the year is inten[s]e, and the Colonel knew the body of the unhappy [s]oldier mu[s]t that day be con[s]igned to the earth, yet how to make the grave, or how to convey the corp[s]e to it when made were difficulties which he could hardly think it po[s][s]ible to [s]urmount, but [s]ad nece[s][s]ity enforced the attempt; he fixed on a retired [s]pot, ju[s]t by the [s]ide of his garden, and began the melancholy ta[s]k. Rebecca and Sophia with their delicate hands endeavourd to a[s][s]i[s]t, and by evening they had completed it. The faint rays of the [s]etting [s]un ju[s]t tinged the summit of the highe[s]t hill; the [s]ky was [s]erene, and [s]carce a breeze was heard to move the leaves or ruffle the [s]mooth [s]urface of the water. Awfully [s]olemn was the [s]ilenet that reigned through this once cheerful village. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] As the Colonel [s]at pen[s]ively con[s]idering his [s]ituation, and thinking how in the decente[s]t manner po[s][s]ible he could render the la[s]t [s]ad duties to the decea[s]ed, he [s]aw a [s]mall fi[s]hing boat, with one man in it, drawing near the [s]hore; he ran ha[s]tily down, entreated him to land and a[s][s]i[s]t him in his mournful office. The body was carefully wrapped in a [s]heet---it was impo[s][s]ible to obtain a coffin. "We have no clergyman," [s]aid the Colonel, "but the prayers of innocence [s]hall con[s]ecrate his grave." He gave the prayer book to Sophia, [s]he opened it, and with her mother and Rebecca followed the body. She began the [s]ervice, but her voice faltered, the tears bur[s]t forth, [s]he [s]obbed, and could no longer articulate. The Colonel took it from her; he was a man of undaunted courage in the day of battle, but here even his heart [s]unk and his voice was tremulous; but he recalled his fortitude and fini[s]hed the [s]olemn rite in a becoming manner. "What a day has this been," [s]aid Sophia, as they were partaking a little refre[s]hment. "It has been a heavy day indeed my child," [s]aid Mrs. Abthorpe, "but how much heavier would it have been, had the poor departed been related to us by any ties of blood: had he been a father, a hu[s]band, or a brother. Think not of the evils we endure, my dear Sophia, but reflect how much more painful our [s]ituation might be than it is, and offer up your thanks to your Creator, that our afflictions do not exceed our [s]trength, and that in this [s]olitary place we enjoy health and serenity of mind." "Ah," [s]aid Rebecca, mentally, "I do not enjoy that [s]erenity, for my mother, in affliction, in want, and calling in vain upon her daughter for comfort, is ever pre[s]ent to my imagination." For [s]everal weeks the [s]olitude of Colonel Abthorpe was undi[s]turbed, and Autumn began to advance. He dreaded the approach of Winter, as he knew in that inclement [s]ea[s]on they would feel the want of many comforts they had been accu[s]tomed to enjoy; and [s]hut out [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] from all [s]ociety, how [s]hould they procure [s]u[s]tenance. The[s]e reflections made him extremely unhappy. He would gladly have gone to the Briti[s]h troops, but had no po[s][s]ible means of conveying him[s]elf and family to them, and his heart revolted from the thought of going to re[s]ide with the enemies of his [s]overeign; however they gave him not the choice, for the latter end of October they di[s]patched a party, con[s]i[s]ting of a captain, lieutenant, and fifty men, who [s]urrounded the hou[s]e of the defencele[s]s Colonel, making him[s]elf, his wife, daughter, and our heroine pri[s]oners, on pretence of his having held corre[s]pondence with the enemy. They were conveyed into the country, their hou[s]e torn to pieces, their furniture de[s]troyed, burnt, or divided among the soldiers, and all their property confi[s]cated. SUFFERING LOYALTY. Mrs . Abthorpe was a woman of delicate constitution. This [s]ad rever[s]e of fortune was more than [s]he could well [s]upport; a [s]low nervous fever preyed upon her frame; nor could the united efforts of her husband, Sophia and Rebecca, arou[s]e her from the [s]tate of torpor and inaction into which [s]he had fallen, cooped up in one [s]ingle room (for, though pri[s]oners, they had the liberty of walking about the place to which they been conveyed) obliged to perform the mo[s]t menial offices for them[s]elves, with [s]carcely the nece[s][s]aries, and none of the comforts of life, except what was [s]upplied from [s]ome few benevolent families who were friends to government. It may be ea[s]ily [s]uppo[s]ed Col. Abthorpe and his family acutely felt their painful [s]ituation, yet he endeavoured to [s]upp ort him[s]elf with a becoming fortitude. Rebecca and her young Lady, in the cour[s]e of a few [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] months, learned to manage their wheels, which they plied with diligence and dexterity, [s]ometimes spinning cotton, [s]ometimes wool or flax, ri[s]ing with the lark, and continuing their labours with unremitting industry, till the [s]hades of evening prevented their pursuing it. They would then, as the progre[s]s of the [s]pring invited them, wander out to a neighbouring wood, the borders of which were wa[s]hed by a narrow arm of the [s]ea; they would [s]it on its banks, watching the un[s]table element as it ebbed or flowed, and admiring the rich beauties of the [s]urrounding pro[s]pect. Their hearts were innocent. Youth, health and exerci[s]e, gave them a flow of [s]pirits, and often as they [s]at would they warble [s]ome innocent cheerful air, or in an evening hymn of thank[s]giving, lift up their [s]ouls to their Creator. But when the [s]ummer was pa[s]t, and winter in its dread array drew near, when the pinching bla[s]ts of December pierced bleakly through the crevices of their miserable habitation, and there was neither fire or necessary food to alleviate the horrors in[s]pired by the gloominess of the [s]ea[s]on, then it was their [s]pirits began to flag. Sophia would gaze ardently at her mother, on who[s]e pale countenance [s]ickne[s]s and [s]orrow [s]at triumphant, and while, with a faint [s]mile of tender affection, [s]he endeavoured to cheer her, the [s]tarting tear would di[s]cover the de[s]pondency of her own heart. It was a cold evening, the [s]now fell fa[s]t, a very [s]mal portion of fire glowed on the hearth, and the little light in their apartment proceeded from a [s]mall lamp that was placed on a deal table; be[s]ide which [s]at Colonel Abthorpe, his head re[s]ted on his hand, his eyes fixed in mournful contemplation on the altered face of his beloved wife, who, [s]eated oppo[s]ite to him was diligently employed in knitting, while Rebecca and Sophia were in hopes, by the produce of their labours to [s]mall, very [s]mall [s]hare of comforts they [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] "I have felt it colder," replied his Lady, endeavouring at a [s]mile; "be[s]ides the room is [s]mall, and a little fire warms it." "To be [s]ure," cried Sophia, "and then, while I am at work, I never think of the cold; but I am afraid of Rebecca; [s]he is more delicate than I am." "Your fears are needle[s]s, my love," replied our heroine. "I [s]hould not mind the inclemency of the season was your dear mother only comfortable." "We think our [s]ituation hard,' [s]aid Mrs. Abthorpe, "what then is the [s]ituation of the poor [s]oldiers engaged in the war?" "Poor fellows," [s]aid the Colonel, pa[s][s]ing his hand acro[s]s his forehead, to conceal the rheum that di[s]tilled from his eyes. At that moment the door of their apartment opened, and a [s]tranger entered without ceremony. The Colonel acro[s]s. Mrs. Abthorpe bowed her head in token of [s]alutation, and the young ladies [s]u[s]pended their work. The [s]tranger drew a chair. "You do not [s]eem to be comfortably [s]ituated, Colonel," [s]aid he, as he [s]eated him[s]elf, and ca[s]t his eyes round the room. "No," replied the Colonel, with a deep drawn [s]igh, "comfort and I have long been [s]trangers to each other." "Mrs. Abthorpe looks ill," [s]aid the [s]tranger; "has [s]he had any advice?" "The humanity of [s]ome friends, Sir, have procured her every medical a[s][s]i[s]tance; but, alas! in vain---the malady is [s]eated in her mind." "I was enquiring about you the other day," [s]aid the [s]tranger, "and was [s]orry to hear you were [s]o badly [s]upplied with the nece[s][s]aries of life. A plan has [s]ince [s]truck me by which you may be relieved from the[s]e distresses, and re[s]tored to the ea[s]e and affluence heretofore been accu[s]tomed to enjoy." This was at once calling forth ditors. Mrs. Abthorpe rai[s]ed face, Sophia and Rebecca Colonel li[s]tened in [s]ilence, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] "Our army is at pre[s]ent in want of experienced officers: You do not hold any commi[s][s]ion under the King of England?" "But I have eat his bread, Sir," [s]aid the colonel, ha[s]tily. Mrs. Abthorpe [s]ighed, and relap[s]ed into her accustomed pen[s]ive [s]tate. "If you would accept a commi[s][s]ion in our army," [s]aid the [s]tranger, "your property would be again restored, and ample compen[s]ation made for the lo[s][s]es you have [s]u[s]tained." The Colonel [s]hook his head, and made a rejecting motion with his hand. "You will be rai[s]ed to a rank [s]uperior to any you have held in the Briti[s]h army, and your name will be immortalized as one of the glorious [s]upporters of American liberty." The colonel frowned contemptuou[s]ly, and was going to [s]peak, but the [s]tranger interrupted him: "You will have the felicity of [s]eeing your amiable wife and lovely daughter enjoying again the comforts and elegancies of life. Plea[s]ure will once more inhabit their bo[s]oms, and enliven their features." The Colonel gazed tenderly on his wife and daughter, pau[s]ed, and [s]eemed irre[s]olute. Mrs. Abthorpe read his heart. "And what," [s]aid [s]he, addre[s][s]ing the [s]tranger, "are the elegancies of life, when the mind no longer retains its own approbation. It is true, Sir, the pre[s]ent change in our circum[s]tances has awakened [s]ome painful sensations; but it has not made us unhappy. I do not repine, for, though unfortunate, we are not de[s]picable; our integrity has ever been un[s]haken, and, I tru[s]t, will ever remain [s]o." "True my love," [s]aid the colonel, recollecting himself, "we will bear the pre[s]ent evils patiently, and hope for better days in future." "But I would have you weigh this matter maturely, Colonel," [s]aid the [s]tranger, "before you pretend to decide." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] "I have weighed it, Sir. You will pardon my abruptness, and am determined to reject every offer that would tend to draw me from the loyalty I owe the be[s]t of [s]overeigns; and allow me to [s]ay, I con[s]ider [s]uch offers as in[s]ults to my honour." "It is well, Sir," [s]aid the [s]tranger, ri[s]ing, "if your re[s]olution is taken, I will [s]ay no more on the [s]ubject; but you will plea[s]e to prepare your family for leaving this place to-morrow. You are to be conveyed twenty miles farther into the country." "Farther into the country, Sir!" [s]aid the Colonel, [s]tarting. "My wife is unable to bear the journey." Sophia turned deathly pale, and left the room with Rebecca. "Do not be unea[s]y, my dear Abthorpe," [s]aid the amiable wife; I make no doubt but he, who for his own wife purpo[s]es, [s]uffers us thus to be afflicted, will endue me with [s]trength of mind and body to bear it as becomes a Chri[s]tian." The [s]tranger walked acro[s]s the room. He was a man of feeling, and had very unwillingly undertaken his commi[s][s]ion. He was po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of every virtue that could alleviate the human heart. He had been taught to think the cau[s]e, in which he was engaged, was a right cau[s]e. He was young; his bo[s]om glowed with enthusiastic ardour. Can we blame him? for, though attached to the cau[s]e of his country, he was [s]till more [s]o to that of humanity." "I am [s]orry," [s]aid he; but a di[s]agreeable oppre[s][s]ion upon the lungs prevented his proceeding farther. The Colonel involuntarily took him by the hand: "And had you, my dear Sir been tempted to de[s]ert your country's cau[s]e? What [s]ays your heart? Would private intere[s]t have triumphed over the [s]pirit patrioti[s]m that now animates your bo[s]om?" "I have no wife and child," [s]aid he. The feelings of [s]en[s]ibility could no longer be re[s]trained, but ru[s]hed impetuous from his eyes and though he was a man of undoubted valour, he did not blu[s]h to indulge them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] "Let tho[s]e blu[s]h," [s]aid he, mentally, who, "cannot [s]ympathize with an afflicted fellow creature." "But [s]uppo[s]e," [s]aid Mrs. Abthorpe, laying her hand on his arm, for he had mechanically [s]topped be[s]ide her,--- "Suppo[s]e, Sir, you had a wife, who would feel more for your deviation from rectitude, than [s]he would to endure the harde[s]t pangs of poverty and sickness, and who would rather die than [s]ee you an apo[s]tate to the cau[s]e you had vowed for ever to e[s]pou[s]e." He turned abruptly from her; [s]omething that [s]poke within forbade him to an[s]wer.--- "And what have I done," [s]aid the Colonel, "that I mu[s]t leave a place where I have experienced [s]uch friendship, [s]uch di[s]intere[s]ted affection, from many of the inhabitants?" "You are too near the [s]ea coa[s]t," [s]aid the [s]tranger, and may hold corre[s]pondence with the enemy." He averted his eye from the Colonel's face, and pretended to con[s]ult his watch. "It is later than I thought," [s]aid he, endeavouring at indifference in his voice and manner. "At eight o'clock to-morrow I expect you will be removed. God ble[s]s you, my dear madam," respectfully taking Mrs. Abthorpe's hand. She [s]aw the feelings of his [s]oul depicted in his face, and forbore to encrea[s]e them by unnece[s][s]ary complaint. "The change of air may do me good, Sir," [s]aid [s]he with a [s]mile of complacency; "for it often happens that what we dread as an evil, in the end contributes to our advantage." He gazed on her with a look of reverence and wonder, bowed profoundly, and, unable to articulate another sentence, ha[s]tily left the room. THE REMOVAL. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] " And mu[s]t we leave this place, my dear father?" [s]aid Sophia, coming from a [s]mall adjoining apartment, whither [s]he had retired to indulge the tears [s]he was no longer able to re[s]train: "Mu[s]t we be separated from tho[s]e friends who[s]e generous attentions have lightened all our afflictions?" "We mu[s]t, Sophia" [s]aid her father, rather [s]ternly, "to-morrow morning." "Ah! me," [s]aid the weeping girl, turning to Rebecca, and re[s]ting her head on her [s]houlder. "Do not grieve thus, my dear Sophia," [s]aid our heroine; for though [s]eparated from your friends, you will [s]till live in their remembrance, and they in your's." "Yes," cried Sophia, with a look of grateful rapture, " ever while the vital tide nouri[s]hes my heart. Dear, worthy inhabitants of [3] Hingham, when I forget the friend[s]hip that alleviated my parent's [s]orrows, may that heart cea[s]e to beat." The next morning, ju[s]t as the grey dawn began to enliven the Ea[s]t, Mr. Abthorpe's family were called to begin their journey. An open chai[s]e, drawn by a miserable hor[s]e, was all the conveyance provided for Mrs. Abthorpe, Sophia and Rebecca; the Colonel him[s]elf was expected to walk. About nine o'clock in the morning they [s]et out, but the roads were [s]o full of [s]now, and the hor[s]e [s]o old and lame, that, though they had only a journey of twenty miles to make, they had not completed it at four o'clock in the afternoon. The darkne[s]s of night had begun to envelope every object, when the chai[s]e [s]topped at a hut that could [s]carcely be called habitable. Rebecca and Sophia a[s][s]i[s]ted Mrs. Abthorpe to alight; gloomy as was the outward appearance of their de[s]tined habitation, the in[s]ide [s]erved only to increa[s]e their horror; it con[s]i[s]ted of three rooms. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] The windows had once been glazed, but were now [s]ome parts open, and others mended with wood. One room was boarded, the others had only the ground for a floor. There were two chimnies, large and dreary, in which no trace of fire appeared; all was de[s]olate and gloomy! It was now quite dark, the Colonel was not yet arrived. Rebecca and Sophia felt round the damp [s]olitary rooms for [s]omething on which Mrs. Abthorpe might [s]it down, for [s]he was faint and weary from taking no refreshment during their tedious journey, and having been expo[s]ed to the inten[s]e cold [s]o many hours; but their [s]earch was vain, no [s]eat could be found: they took off their own loaks, and laid them on the floor: On the[s]e [s]he [s]unk weak and exhau[s]ted, and, in [s]pite of her accu[s]tomed fortitude, [s]uffering nature wrung from her a few complaints.---Rebecca and Sophia knelt be[s]ide and [s]upported her---the voice of comfort no longer i[s][s]ued from their lips---their [s]ighs re[s]pon[s]ive an[s]wered her's--- their tears mingled as they fell---but all remained silent. They heard foot[s]teps approach---the Colonel's well known voice [s]aluted their ears. "Dry your eyes, my dear girls," [s]aid Mrs. Abthorpe; "Let us not increa[s]e his [s]orrows, who[s]e every pang is doubled by our [s]ufferings." The Colonel entered, [s]ome one accompanied him for they could hear more than one foot[s]tep. "We [s]hall have a fire [s]oon," [s]aid the Colonel; "it is a very cold evening." "But I am well wrapped up, and do not feel it," [s]aid Mrs. Abthorpe. His heart thanked her though it refu[s]ed to believe her a[s][s]ertion. Ju[s]t then a third per[s]on entered, and threw down an armful of wood, when the per[s]on, who had accompanied the Colonel, produced a tinder box and [s]triking a light di[s]coverd to the a[s]toni[s]hed females the [s]ons of two of their be[s]t friends. Mr. Lane! Mr. Barker! involuntarily bur[s]t from all their lips; but the generous young men would not hear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] a word of prai[s]e or thanks; they [s]oon cheered the [s]olitary man[s]ion with a comfortable fire; in the mean time a [s]mall cart arrived with two beds, a few chairs, and [s]ome kitchen uten[s]ils. From a ba[s]ket in this cart the young men produced a couple of fowls, [s]ome butter, bread, and two bottles of wine, [s]o that in le[s]s than two hours, from their fir[s]t melancholy entrance, our di[s]tre[s][s]ed family were [s]eated in homely wi[s]e round an old wain[s]cot table, before a large fire, partaking a plentiful [s]upper, while their hearts expanded with gratitude to that good Providence who had rai[s]ed them up friends when lea[s]t expected. The next morning the young men exerted them[s]elves to repair the breaches in the windows, and to [s]top the large crevices in the doors of the hou[s]e, having to the utmo[s]t of their power, le[s][s]ened their troubles, and rendered them tolerably comfortable, they departed, leaving behind them [s]ome meat, bread, butter, chee[s]e, and a [s]mall parcel of tea and [s]ugar; but, as the la[s]t-named articles were at that time extremely [s]carce, they could not be [s]o liberal as their expanded hearts lead them to wi[s]n. Oh! with what rapture mu[s]t the parents of the[s]e young men have received them after [s]uch a journey, to which they had been incited by motives of the pure[s]t benevolence; but benevolence was their characteri[s]tics. [4] Ble[s]t [s]pirits of philanthropy, who[s]e hearts ere discord [s]hook her baleful wings, and [s]hed her influence over your happy plains, in a [s]tate of almo[s]t primeval innocence, [s]elt not a pang but for another's woe, and who[s]e fir[s]t plea[s]ure was to alleviate the [s]orrows of a suffering fellow creature! May the arrows of afflictions with which an unnatural war has [s]ince wounded you, be drawn forth by the hand of [s]ympathizing friend[s]hip [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] and the angui[s]h of them obliterated by the recollection of your own good deeds. But this is a theme which carries me from every other. I would reque[s]t pardon for digre[s][s]ing my subject, but I know tho[s]e only will blame me, who never felt the [s]weet emotions of unbounded gratitude. But to return.--- The habitation to which Colonel Abthorpe had been thus [s]uddenly removed, was [s]ituated on the [s]kirts of an exten[s]ive wood. The face of the country was rocky and dreary, to which unpromi[s]ing appearance the [s]now and ice not a little contributed. There was but one habitation within two miles of them, and that was occupied by people, if po[s][s]ible more wretched than themselves. In this di[s]mal [s]ituation, with no amu[s]ement but what [s]prang from them[s]elves, for they had not even the consolation of books, did the Colonel and his family pa[s]s four weari[s]ome months, during which time they had of ten no food but coar[s]e Indian bread and potatoes; nor any firing but what Sophia and Rebecca a[s][s]i[s]ted each other to bring in their delicate arms from the adjacent woods, for the Colonel him[s]elf was great part of that time con[s]ined to the hou[s]e with the gout; and in their daily excur[s]ions to procure this nece[s][s]ary appendage to the [s]upport of life in [s]o cold a climate, they had no covering to their [s]eet, which often bled from the intenseness of the cold, or from inci[s]ions made by the rugged path over which they were obliged to pa[s]s. It was the latter end of March, the ice was beginning to di[s][s]olve in the warmth of a mid day [s]un, when Rebecca, willing to enjoy a [s]hort [s]pace of uninterrupted reflection, [s]allied into the woods, unaccompanied by Mi[s]s Abthorpe. As [s]he gathered up [s]ome [s]cattered branches, and laid them together, her thoughts wandered to her native land. She retraced every event of her pa[s]t life; "And where now is Sir George?" [s]aid [s]he. "Could he behold me at this in[s]tant, how would his generous heart compa[s][s]ionate my misfortunes; but, alas! perhaps I am no more remembered by him, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] or he con[s]iders me as numbered with the dead; and am I not [s]o to him? Then, why [s]hould I wi[s]h him to retain me in his mind, when, by forgetting me, he may regain that felicity his generous [s]entiments in my favour had interrupted. No doubt, he is long [s]ince married to the Lady with whom his mother wi[s]hed him to unite. Ah! my beloved benefactre[s]s," continued [s]he, [s]itting down on a large [s]tone at the foot of a [s]preading pine, "dear Lady Mary, little did you think when I parted from you we were never more to meet! But that anguish of heart would from that hour be the unremitting portion of your Rebecca." She then drew forth the picture, which, through all her di[s]tre[s]s, [s]he had [s]till carefully pre[s]erved, and constantly carried about her in a [s]mall pur[s]e, in which [s]he had al[s]o depo[s]ited Sir George's letter, and tho[s]e [s]he had received from her mother. As [s]he opened this precious repo[s]itory, her mother's writing caught her eye. "My poor mother," [s]aid [s]he---"what waves, what in[s]urmountable waves, now roll between us! Shall I ever again behold you? Or is it my fate here, far distant from my native land, to end an exi[s]tence, which though [s]hort, has been marked by variety of [s]orrow?" Here painful remembrance over-powered her. She rested her cheek on her hand, and as [s]he held the picture in the other, alternately rai[s]ed her [s]treaming eyes to heaven, and then fixed them on the portrait of Sir George. She was arou[s]ed from this painful reverie by a deep drawn [s]igh, which [s]eemed to proceed from a per[s]on very near her, and, [s]tarting, [s]aw a venerable old man [s]tanding oppo[s]ite her, habited in a lieutenant's dirty uniform. She aro[s]e, and, tying her bundle of wood together, was preparing to lift it, when the old officer approached. "It is too heavy for you, child," [s]aid he; "give me leave to carry it." "I have not far to go, Sir," [s]aid Rebecca. "Perhaps you are going by the unfortunate Colonel [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] Abthorpe's habitation, or can direct me where to find it?" "I live in his family," [s]aid Rebecca, eagerly. "Do you know him, Sir?" "Alas! no, my dear child; but hearing he was a pri[s]oner at this place, and being my[s]elf in the [s]ame unhappy predicament, I am going to claim his [s]ociety, hoping that, as brothers in affliction, we may be enabled to comfort each other: But, [s]urely, I have [s]een you before, though where or when I can by no means recollect." "Your features too," [s]aid Rebecca, "[s]eem samiliar to me, yet I do not think we ever met before." They had now reached the hou[s]e, and depo[s]iting their burthen at the door, entered. "You will pardon me, Sir," [s]aid the old lieutenant, advancing to the Colonel, "if I, una[s]ked, intrude myself into your dwelling; but hearing there was an officer in this place, I could not re[s]i[s]t the defire I [s]elt to be known to him." "And by what name am I to know and thank you for this civility?" [s]aid the Colonel, placing a chair for his gue[s]t. "My name is Littleton." "Littleton!" cried Rebecca, [s]tepping eagerly forward. "Yes, George Littleton," [s]aid the Lieutenant. I have worne his Maje[s]ty's livery above twenty years. "My name is Littleton," [s]aid Rebecca. "And your father's name?" "Was William.--- "He is dead, then," [s]aid Mr. Littleton, with a difappointed look. Rebecca's tears confirmed the [s]u[s]picion. "And did you never hear him [s]peak of a brother?" "Yes, but as of one long [s]ince dead." "Alas! he thought me dead, but I am that brother; nor can I doubt but you are his child, you bear [s]o [s]trong a re[s]emblance to him. My dear girl," continued he, embracing her, "how my heart bleeds to meet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] you here, and [s]o badly [s]heltered from the inclemency of the [s]eafon. A few moments were now devoted to mutual gratulations and mutual condolence. When the fir[s]t tumult was a little [s]ub[s]ided, Rebecca wi[s]hed to be informed how it happened that her uncle had been [s]o long [s]uppo[s]ed dead by her father?" "Di[s]appointment and vexation," [s]aid the old gentleman, "drove me from my native country; the lo[s]s of a wife and child, whom I tenderly loved, di[s]gu[s]ted me with life, and I [s]hipped my[s]elf to the Ea[s]t-Indies, from whence I hoped never to return." [3] A village about twenty miles from Bo[s]ton. [4] The Author begs leave to add to the names already mentioned, tho[s]e of Gay, Levith, and Thaxter. It is a tribute of gratitude due to that exalted philanthropy, that evinced it[s]elf in a di[s]intere[s]ted friendship for a family, whole misfortunes were their chief recommendation and who had not the mo[s]t di[s]tant hope of being ever able to cancel their repeated obligations. AN OLD MAN'S TALE. " I AM [s]everal years younger than was your father, and was placed by an old uncle with a wealthy merchant, with whom he promi[s]ed to e[s]tabli[s]h me when I had [s]erved my clerk[s]hip with honour. "My ma[s]ter had an only child; [s]he was not what is u[s]ually called a beauty, but [s]he was in my eyes more. Her features were regular; the gentlene[s]s of her [s]pirit threw a [s]oftne[s]s over her countenance, which at once prepossessed every beholder in her favour. Added to the meek forgiving [s]pirit of a Chri[s]tian, [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed all the intripid fortitude and courage of a Roman matron. The innocence of her heart in[s]pired her with unaffected cheerfulness, and a mo[s]t engaging vivacity was tempered with a mode[s]t [s]implicity. Such was Ro[s]a Ben[s]on, when at the age of eighteen [s]he was [s]ent for from France, where [s]he had been educated, to take the care of her father's hou[s]e, her mother [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] having been taken [s]uddenly off by an appoplexy. I was ju[s]t two years older, and could not behold unmoved, the innumerable charms that were daily di[s]played by this engaging girl. She performed on the harp[s]ichord with great ta[s]te and execution, had a [s]oft melodious voice, and [s]ung with judgment. Her mind had been carefully cultivated, which rendered her a well informed rational companion. Mr. Ben[s]on generally [s]pent his evenings abroad, and I frequently pa[s]t many hours in uninterrupted conversation with the charming Ro[s]a. I will not pretend to delineate the various imperceptible degrees by which our hearts became attached to each other: Suffice it to [s]ay, we [s]elt the power of love mingled with the pure[s]t friend[s]hip; nor did we once reflect on the imprudence of indulging our [s]en[s]ibility till awakened from our dream of bli[s]s by Mr. Ben[s]on informing his daughter, that her hand was [s]olicited by an Earl, and that he had given him leave to addre[s]s her; at the [s]ame time he gave her to under[s]tand, he did not expect any oppo[s]ition to his will, and [s]lattered him[s]elf he [s]hould [s]oon behold her a Counte[s]s. When Mi[s]s Ben[s]on informed me of this unexpected [s]troke, I [s]elt as though annihilated: I threw my[s]elf at her feet, and entreated her not to make me the mo[s]t wretched of human beings by accepting my noble rival. She a[s][s]ured me [s]he had too high a [s]en[s]e of honour to give her hand to one man, while her heart was entirely devoted to another, but [s]till I was unhappy; nor did I cea[s]e [s]oliciting the dear girl till [s]he con[s]ented to be mine by the [s]tronge[s]t of all ties, and by a private marriage I [s]ecured to my[s]elf, as I then thought, the mo[s]t permanent felicity. Still the Earl continued his affiduities: but Ro[s]a found means to evade her father's earne[s]t wi[s]hes, and a more wealthy woman falling in his lord[s]hip's way, who had no objection to making the exchange of money for a title, [s]he was for that time delivered from farther importunity. About [s]ix months after our marriage, it became necessary for Mr. Ben[s]on to [s]end a per[s]on to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] West-Indies, with powers to [s]ettle [s]ome bu[s]ine[s]s with the merchants there: It was a lucrative employment. He mentioned to my uncle that I might, if I cho[s]e, undertake the voyage. My uncle acquie[s]ced. There was no alternative, and I was under the nece[s][s]ity of leaving my wife, whom I could by no means per[s]uade to accquaint her father with our marriage previous to my departure. During my ab[s]ence I was much [s]urprized at receiving no letters from my dear Ro[s]a; but as I was [s]en[s]ible there might be various cau[s]es for this apparent neglect, it only [s]erved to render me more attentive to my bu[s]ine[s]s, as I knew the [s]ooner it was fini[s]hed, the [s]ooner I [s]hould return to the wife of my choice, the freid of my bo[s]om. At length it was completed, and I returned to my native land, after being ab[s]ent from it about thirteen months. Eagerly did I count the minutes whil[s]t travelling from Deal to London; and when the chai[s]e [s]topped at Mr. Ben[s]on's door, my heart throbbed with [s]uch violence that I could hardly [s]peak. I alighted, and ran ha[s]tily up [s]tairs; but was much [s]urpri[s]ed, on entering the drawing-room, to [s]ee a [s]trange Lady there, young hand[s]ome, and elegantly dre[s][s]ed. Mr. Ben[s]on mention ed her as his wife. "And where is Mi[s]s Ro[s]a?" [s]aid I. "She is not at home," replied Mr. Ben[s]on, coolly; "but, come Littleton take your tea, and then we will go into the counting hou[s]e, and talk over bu[s]ine[s]s." Con[s]cious as I was of the near intere[s]t I took in every thing that concerned Ro[s]a, I forbore to mention her again, left the agitation of my mind [s]hould be betrayed by my countenance; I took my tea in [s]ilence, and then de[s]cended with my ma[s]ter to the counting-hou[s]e, where, in as conci[s]e a manner as po[s][s]ible, I gave him an account of the bu[s]ine[s]s I had been [s]ent upon, and delivered to him all the bills and other papers I had brought with me from Jamacia; this employed us till near one o'clock in the morning, and, [s]atigued as I was, I could not but be [s]urpri[s]ed that my hitherto indulgent ma[s]ter [s]hould have no thought of the long voyage and journey I had ju[s]t arrived from, and that I certainly required re[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] When we had entirely fini[s]shed, he thus addre[s][s]ed me: "I promi[s]ed you, Littleton, that this [s]hould be a lucrative bu[s]ine[s]s to you, there (opening his pocket book;) there are bills to the amount of two hundred pounds; and now, Sir, let me tell you, that you are a knave and a villain, a de[s]igning, deceitful, [s]coundrel, who, under the ma[s]k of honor and probity, have robbed me of my daughter, [s]tolen her affections, and encouraged her in di[s]obedience. It is to your arts I owe her refu[s]al of the Earl of---, and had [s]he not been your wi[s]e, [s]he would at this moment, have been a Dutche[s]s." I had [s]at as one petrified during this [s]peech; but on his again calling me by the opprobious names already mentioned, I rou[s]ed my[s]elf, and endeavoured to an[s]wer; but his pa[s][s]ion, like a torrent, bore down all before it, and I was obliged to be [s]ilent. At length he told me he had di[s]claimed his daughter, that he had [s]ent her from his hou[s]e, and would never give her a [s]ingle farthing, no not even to keep her from [s]tarving. "But go," continued he, "go to her, and may you both, with your brat, [s]tarve together." The mention of a child operated on my nerves like a [s]troke of electricity. "And where are they, Sir?" [s]aid I, [s]tarting from my [s]eat, "where are my Ro[s]a and her in[s]ant?" "Somewhere in the country," [s]aid he; "but I don't concern my[s]elf with them, nor do I ever wi[s]h to [s]ee you or her again. You have di[s]appointed me in my deare[s]t hopes and I will [s]eek con[s]olation in the company of an amiable woman, who may, perhaps, yet bring me children more dutiful than the ungrateful viper you have married." He then flung out of the room, and I too much irritated to remain in a hou[s]e where I had been [s]o ill treated, was preparing to leave it, when the door opened, and one of the hou[s]e maids entered, looking carefully round her. "I am glad you are come, Sir," [s]aid [s]he; "my poor young Lady will rejoice to [s]ee you." "Where is [s]he, Betty?" [s]aid I. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] "At Wind[s]or," replied the girl, "at my [s]i[s]ter's; but [s]he has never been well [s]ince ma[s]ter was born." I took a direction from the girl, and [s]et off immediately, as I could procure a chai[s]e. It was between five and [s]ix when I arrived at Windfor, and having ordered [s]ome breakfa[s]t, though I had no inclination to eat, I [s]ent for the woman with whom my love lodged, and finding her a di[s]creet [s]en[s]ible person, intru[s]ted her with a letter to be dilivered cautiously, to the dear creature, who I found was in a very alarming [s]tate. In about two hours I was [s]ummoned to the cottage that contained all my trea[s]ure; but, good heaven! how [s]hall I de[s]cribe my [s]en[s]ation at the [s]ight of my wife, [s]carcely the [s]hadow of her former [s]elf---pale---thin---her eyes [s]unk heavy---and devoid of lu[s]ter!" "George," [s]aid [s]he, putting her dear boy into my arms, "you are come home in time to receive this pledge of my love, and to clo[s]e my eyes; but I [s]hall die content, [s]en[s]ible that you will be a kind father to my child." I endeavourd to cheer her, and in[s]pire her with hopes which I could not rationally indulge my[s]elf. I procured the be[s]t medical advice, but all in vain; [s]he grew wor[s]e and wor[s]e, and expired in le[s]s than a fortnight after my arrival in England. Previous to her death [s]he informed me that another, [s]till more [s]plended, offer of marriage, [s]trenuou[s]ly urged by her father, had wrung from her the [s]ecret of our marriage, and that [s]he was immediately di[s]mi[s][s]ed from her father's hou[s]e in the mo[s]t di[s]graceful manner; that [s]he had wrote to my uncle, claiming his protection- if not on her own account, for the [s]ake of the unborn infant; but his ans[s]wer was, that as I cho[s]e to marry without con[s]ulting him, I might maintain my wife as I could for he would never more do any thing for me; and as to her he thought [s]he mu[s]t have behaved very ill, when her own father had di[s]carded her. From that time he entirely withdrew his favour, from me, and, though [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] I went to him [s]oon after the death of my wife, I was not permitted to [s]ee him. About this time your father, who was then an en[s]ign in a marching regiment, was ordered to Ireland. I had not [s]een him for [s]ome years, as he had been [s]tationed at Plymouth; but could not let him leave the kingdom without taking a per[s]onal leave: I therefore left my dear boy with the good woman where my Ro[s]a had lodged, and [s]at off for that place. I had not been with my brother above three days, before I received a letter from the nur[s]e, informing me that my boy had been carried off by a convul[s]ion fit the day after I left Wind[s]or. The world now appeared to me an univer[s]al blank. I con[s]idered my[s]elf as a mere cypher, without family, connexion or friends, and possessing but a [s]mall portion of wordly goods. I had formed an acquaintance with [s]everal officers belonging to one of his Maje[s]ty's [s]hips going to China; a de[s]ire of roving took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my mind. I had, when a boy, been fond of the [s]tudy of mathematics, and during my voyage to Jamaica, had contracted a fondne[s]s for a nautical life, I therefore reque[s]ted to be admitted on board the Triton, and was accepted. In this [s]hip I went to the Ea[s]t-Indies, fully re[s]olved never to vi[s]it England again. This re[s]olution I kept inviolate for many years, always, changing into [s]ome [s]hip [s]tationed in tho[s]e parts whenever the one I was in was remanded home. In his Maje[s]ty's [s]ervice I aro[s]e by degrees to the rank of lieutenant, and my ambition had led me to hope, during this war, I [s]hould have ri[s]en [s]till higher, for the [s]hip I was in, being ordered home, and I unable to obtain an exchange into one [s]tationed in India, I returned to England, and was [s]oon after [s]ent in a cutter with expre[s][s]es to the fleet at New-York, from whence I was di[s]patched to Bo[s]ton, where I unfortunately arrived after the evacuation of his Maje[s]ty's troops, and of con[s]equence fell into the hands of the enemy. I have been detained a pri[s]oner now near two years, frequently removed from one place to another, and every removal is [s]till for the wor[s]e; but I hear there [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] is now an exchange of pri[s]oners talked of, [s]o I hope to be included in the cartel. "But did you never write to my father?" [s]aid Rebecca. "Yes, frequently, during the fir[s]t year of my absence from Europe; but never receiving any an[s]wers, owing, as I imagined, to the un[s]ettled life a [s]oldier in general leads, I at length cea[s]ed to write. When I was la[s]t in England I enquired for him of [s]ome of our old friends, and learned that he was married, and had one child; but they could give no information where he was [s]ettled, as they had neither [s]een or heard from him for many years." Rebecca felt a gleam of comfort dilate her affectionate heart, at having thus unexpectedly found a relation: "I am not then entirely unconnected," [s]aid [s]he, mentally, at the [s]ame time laying her hand on that of her uncle, and looking at him with eyes [s]wimming in tears of filial tenderne[s]s, excited by the [s]trong re[s]emblance he bore to her father. "My dear girl," [s]aid he, "you have found an old uncle who will love you with all his heart, and defend you to the la[s]t hour of his exi[s]tence; but I am as poor, Rebecca, as when I fir[s]t put on his Maje[s]ty's livery. In all my long [s]ervicce I have not picked up above two hundred pounds prize-money, and, thinking I had no one to take it after me, I have [s]pent it as fa[s]t, or, perhaps, [s]ometimes fa[s]ter than I gained it. But my pay has been running [s]o long, we [s]hall be quite rich when I get home, and you [s]hall call me father, and make up to me the lo[s]s of my Ro[s]a and her boy." "I will be your daughter in every [s]en[s]e of the word," [s]aid Rebecca, affectionately ki[s][s]ing his hand. The conver[s]ation now took a more general turn: Colonel Abthorpe was delighted with the acqui[s]ition of a friend. They could not think of parting till evening, nor then without a mutual promi[s]e of maintaining a frequent intercour[s]e. WE COME HOME AGAIN. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] When Colonel Abthorpe retired to re[s]t, he revolved in his mind what Mr. Littleton had [s]aid concerning an exchange of pri[s]oners. His wife's declining health had long made him unea[s]y. He flattered him[s]elf was he once removed from captivity, and enabled to obtain [s]ub[s]i[s]tence for his family, her mind would be more at ea[s]e, and [s]he would of con[s]equence recover her health and [s]pirits. The[s]e reflections occupied him all night, and totally bani[s]hed [s]leep. At dawn of day he aro[s]e, and [s]at down to draw up a petition, praying to be, with his family, included in the intended exchange.---This petition he pre[s]ented to the [s]elect-men of the place, to be by them tran[s]mitted to the general court. The an[s]wer he received was a repetition of the offers of employment in the American army, enforced with promi[s]es of the mo[s]t beneficial and lucrative rewards for his [s]ervices. The[s]e he [s]trenuou[s]ly rejected, declaring a re[s]olution to die rather than for[s]ake the cau[s]e of loyalty. They found it was in vain to increa[s]e either their offers of affluence, or their ill treatment; he was alike unmoved by either, at lea[s]t he did not [s]uffer them to perceive the effect his mi[s]eries had on his mind. If he [s]ighed it was in [s]ecret, and he waited with an a[s][s]umed patience the end of his misfortunes, while the mo[s]t afflictive [s]en[s]ations corroded in his bo[s]om: But when he had almo[s]t bidden adieu to hope, when de[s]pair [s]eemed to have taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his mind, then was deliverence neare[s]t at hand, and he received a letter, informing him he was to be exchanged with his family by the very next cartel. They were accordingly removed to Bo[s]ton, and, in company with Mr. Littleton, put on board a [s]mall ve[s][s]el, bearing a flag of truce, in which they arrived, after a ten days pa[s][s]age, [s]afe at Hallifax. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] Here Mr. Littleton was immediately employed, and drew on his agent for money to provide him[s]elf and Rebecca with nece[s][s]aries; nor did he withhold part of his little [s]tore from Colonel Abthorpe, who was really in nece[s][s]itous circum[s]tances. Mrs. Abthorpe's malady had gained too much ground on her delicate con[s]titution ever to be repelled. She continued to decline, and, in a few weeks after their arrival in Nova-Scotia, [s]he [s]unk to eternal re[s]t! Rebecca exerted herself to comfort poor Sophia; but it was now become ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary for them to part. Colonel Abthorpe had not the means even of [s]upporting him[s]elf and daughter, much le[s]s an extra per[s]on: Be[s]ides, Rebecca was eager to revi[s]it England, and [s]ee her mother; he therefore furni[s]hed her with recommendatory letters to several Ladies in London. Her uncle provided her a passage, and gave her an order on his agent for the [s]mall remainder of all his worldly wealth. She took an affectionate leave of her dear Mi[s]s Abthorpe, and embarked for her native land. It [s]eemed as though the elements were as eager to convey our heroine in [s]afety home, as they had been perver[s]e and tardy in bearing her from thence; for on the twenty-eighth day from her leaving Halifax, at the clo[s]e of the evening, [s]he found her[s]elf [s]et down at the door of the Cro[s]s-Keys Inn, in Gracechurch [s]treet, London. She had landed with a widow lady and her maiden [s]i[s]ter (who came in the [s]hip with her) at Deal, and they had proceeded to town in a postchaise. She remained at the inn with them that night, and the next morning took a coach to [s]eek the benevolent friend of Mrs. Harris in the Borough. She was removed, but Mrs. Harris her[s]elf occupied the hou[s]e: Rebecca therefore, met a hearty welcome, and determined to take up her abode with her till [s]he could hear from her mother, to whom [s]he immediately wrote. Anxiou[s]ly did [s]he count the time till [s]he thought it po[s][s]ible to receive an an[s]wer. At length the welcome [s]ound of a po[s]tman's rap [s]aluted her ears. She almo[s]t flew to the door. The letter required double po[s]tage; [s]he paid it without he[s]itation, and ha[s]tily returned to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] the parlour to examine its contents; but as [s]he approached the candle, what were her feelings to di[s]cover it was her own letter returned, with the[s]e words written on the out[s]ide:--- "Removed to London two years ago!" "To London!" [s]aid Rebecca; "but what part of London? Good heavens! that I [s]hould be in the [s]ame place with my mother, and yet unable to find her! But, perhaps, I have no mother now," continued [s]he, mournfully:--- "She has been removed two years; alas! sorrow may have levelled her with the du[s]t long [s]ince." She then endeavoured to recollect [s]ome per[s]on in her native village, to whom [s]he could addre[s]s her[s]elf, in hopes of gaining information whether her mother had mentioned what part of the town [s]he intended to re[s]ide in. At length [s]he recollected the parents of Ruth, who had lived [s]everal years [s]ervant in the family, and was with them when her father died. To them [s]he immediately wrote, and, as early as [s]he could po[s][s]ibly expect, received the following an[s]wer: - - "This comes with father and mother's kind love to you, letting you know that we are all main glad to hear you are alive, and come home again to old England, for, certain [s]ure, we all thought you had been dead a long while ago; [s]o when father put on his [s]pectacles, and began to read your letter, I thought as how I [s]hould have [s]ounded for joy; for indeed, and for [s]arten, Mi[s]s Becky, I would walk a many long miles to [s]ee your [s]weet face. Oh! dear, if you was but as rich, and as happy as you are good, and as we all wi[s]h you.--- "As to your mother, we are deadly afraid [s]he has made but a poor hand of marrying again, for old Serl was but a [s]habby kind of body, though he pretended to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] be [s]o grand, and tried to make folks believe he was a gentleman. "To be [s]ure they did fla[s]h away about a month or two after they were married, and Peg Serl had a mortal fight of new cloaths, but for all [s]he never looked like a lady. Father [s]aid as how you looked more like one in a linen gown, and your nice curling hair without powder, than [s]he did in her [s]ilks and [s]attins, and her hair pla[s]tered up with grea[s]e and flour; but after all they did not hold out long. Serl did not u[s]e your poor fooli[s]h mother well; he kept an impudent hu[s][s]y almo[s]t under her no[s]e, and u[s]ed to be always a drinking and [s]otting, and [s]o the [s]inery all went away by littles and littles, and then they got [s]adly in debt, and at la[s]t went off to London, without letting any body know about it; but cou[s]in Dick was in London la[s]t Martinmas twelve months, and he [s]aid he [s]aw Mrs. Serl go into a hou[s]e in We[s]tmin[s]ter, but [s]he looked main [s]habby, and we never [s]ince heard nothing about her. "Father bid me tell you, that he read in the newspaper how that Sir George Worthy was married to a great Lady; but father [s]ays he could not have found a more better Lady than your own [s]weet [s]elf, be the other who [s]he may, and we all thought as how, when Lady Mary (ble[s]s her dear name)! took you to live with her, that we [s]hould one day [s]ee you come back to the village, Lady of the Manor; but it can't be helped, marrying and hanging they [s]ay goes by fate. Mother and father [s]end their kind love and duty to you, wi[s]hing you a good rich hu[s]band, and [s]oon; and [s]o no more at present from your's to [s]erve till death. RUTH RUSSETT." When Rebecca had fini[s]hed reading this letter her mind was in a [s]tate of anarchy, better imagined than de[s]cribed. She [s]at with the letter open on the table before her---her hands folded in each other---her eyes fixed on vacancy. "Well, what news, my dear," [s]aid Mrs. Harris, as [s]he came into the room, and, without particularly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] observing Rebecca, very lei[s]urely [s]tirred the fire as [s]he [s]poke to her." "He is married," replied Rebecca unconsciously.--- "Well, child, you knew that before, I thought." "No, indeed; this is the fir[s]t I ever heard of it." "Why, how you talk!" [s]aid Mrs. Harris, [s]taring at her; "to my certain knowledge [s]he wrote you word of it her[s]elf." "Who wrote me word of it?" "Why, your mother, child." "Oh! my mother," cried Rebecca, endeavouring to rally her [s]cattered thoughts; then, pau[s]ing for a moment, "my poor mother," continued [s]he, bur[s]ting into tears, I fear I [s]hall never [s]ee her more." There was a wildne[s]s in her looks, an incoherence in her manner, that alarmed the compa[s][s]ionate Mrs. Harris. She drew a chair, and [s]at down be[s]ide her, took both her hands in her's, pre[s][s]ed them tenderly, but remained [s]ilent. This was a conduct more congenial to the mind of Rebecca than the mo[s]t eloquent harangue could have been. She re[s]ted her head on the bo[s]om of her friend, gave a free vent to her tears, and, by degrees, regained a tolerable degree of compo[s]ure. VARIOUS SCENES. When Rebecca had repelled the violence of her fir[s]t emotions, on finding Sir George was really lo[s]t to her, her mother's unfortunate marriage, and its con[s]equences recurred to her mind, [s]he retired to bed, but not to re[s]t; [s]leep was a [s]tranger to her eyes, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] her thoughts were [s]o harra[s][s]ed, that in the morning her heavy eyes, pale lips, and burning hands, alarmed Mrs. Harris. "Come, come, child," [s]aid [s]he, gently [s]haking her, "I mu[s]t not [s]ee you in this way; you are far from well now, and if you go on fretting thus, I [s]hall have you quite laid up. You mu[s]t rou[s]e your[s]elf, my dear; it is very wrong to give way to [s]orrow for misfortunes that are irremediable.---Chance may, perhaps, di[s]cover in what part of the town your mother is; in the mean time you mu[s]t not neglect your own intere[s]t. You have never yet waited on any of the ladies to whom Colonel Abthorpe gave you letters. I will have you dre[s]s your[s]elf this very day, and go to [s]ome of them. Perhaps you may meet with a [s]ituation where, by your mind being con[s]tantly occupied, you will have no time to fret your[s]elf to death, which I fore[s]ee will be the ca[s]e if you are left to your[s]elf." "Indeed, Mrs. Harris, I have no cau[s]e to wi[s]h for life," [s]aid Rebecca, in a melancholy accent, "for, in the whole world, I have no friend but you and my poor uncle; him, perhaps, I [s]hall never [s]ee again, and you, I fear, will grow weary of [s]uch a child of [s]orrow." "Now you are very unkind, Rebecca, to [s]uppo[s]e me capable of neglecting you, or being wearied by your complaints! No, my child, I feel for you every thing that friend[s]hip and affection can feel for a beloved object; and it is becau[s]e I think it nece[s][s]ary to your health that you [s]hould be rou[s]ed from this [s]tate of inaction, that makes me willing to be deprived of your [s]ociety: Besides, my dear, your mother may be, nay, in all probability, is alive, and, at [s]ome future period, you may have it in your power to render her happy and comfortable in her latter hours by your tenderne[s]s and filial love: For her [s]ake, then, exert your natural good [s]en[s]e, and bear your afflictions with becoming re[s]ignation; it is an indi[s]pen[s]able duty you owe to her, to your[s]elf and to your Creator." "Oh! Mrs. Harris," cried Rebecca, "pardon my petulance; I [s]ee the friendly de[s]ign of your advice, and will exert my[s]elf to follow it." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] She now began to look over her letters, and determined to wait that morning on Lady Winterton and Mrs. Sackville, who lived both in a [s]treet near Cavendi[s]h [s]quare. She had two more letters, but they were to ladies in the city. Rebecca's dre[s]s was plain and neat in the extreme, yet there was a dignity in her per[s]on and manner that ever commanded re[s]pect: She, therefore, on knocking at Lord Winterton's door, was immediately u[s]hered into a parlour, and the [s]ervant took the letter to his Lady. The Lady was at her morning toilet. She ca[s]t her eyes ha[s]tily over the letter. "What kind of a per[s]on brought this, Thomas?" [s]aid [s]he to the man who waited ju[s]t without the door of the dre[s][s]ing room. "A very genteel young woman," replied the man. "Well, [s]hew her into the breakfa[s]t parlour, and tell her I [s]hall be with her pre[s]ently. Is my Lord up?" "Yes, my Lady, he is ju[s]t gone down." "Well, go, do as I bid you." The man departed, and Rebecca was de[s]ired to walk into a parlour, where in his night gown and [s]lippers, [s]at a per[s]onage, the exact counterpart of Lord Ogleby in the Clande[s]tine Marriage. Rebecca [s]tarted, and was going to retire. "Pray, Madam," [s]aid my Lord, ri[s]ing, "do not let me frighten you; my Lady will be here directly. Thomas, a chair for the young Lady." Rebecca blu[s]hed, court[s]eyed, and took her [s]eat. My Lord eyed her attentively. She felt her confusion increa[s]e. "She is a very fine girl," thought his Lord[s]hip; I wonder who the devil [s]he is." "The weather is very fine for the [s]ea[s]on, Madam," [s]aid he, thinking it was incumbent upon him to [s]ay [s]omething, though, in fact, it had rained ince[s][s]antly for a week. "The [s]un did break out for about an hour this morning;" [s]aid our heroine, half [s]miling; "but he [s]eems to have withdrawn him[s]elf again." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] "He was con[s]cious, Madam, that when your beauties were vi[s]ible to the admiring eyes of mortals, his fainter glories could not be mi[s][s]ed." "Heavens!" thought Rebecca, "what a ridiculous old man, with his bomba[s]tic compliment: However, I am glad he is old; perhaps his Lady may want a per[s]on to read to her, or by cheerful a[s][s]iduity, otherwi[s]e amu[s]e her. She had, in her own mind, pictured Lady Winterton as an elderly Lady, perhaps upwards of [s]ixty years old. In this family," thought [s]he, "[s]hould I be [s]o happy as to be placed, I [s]hall be free from the noi[s]e and impertinence [s]o frequently to be met with in the families of young people of quality. I dare [s]ay they do not keep much company; nay, perhaps, live in the country above half the year. I wi[s]h I may [s]uit her Ladyship; [s]he certainly wants [s]omebody, either for her[s]elf or [s]ome of her freinds, by her de[s]iring me to wait to [s]ee her." As Rebecca was indulging the[s]e reflections the door opened, and a Lady entered, in appearance not more than twenty, habited in a very modi[s]h undre[s]s. "Mi[s]s Littleton, I pre[s]ume," [s]aid [s]he, advancing--- Rebecca court[s]eyed. "Colonel Abthorpe," [s]aid the Lady, motioning for her to be again [s]eated, "has had a very di[s]agreeable time in America. I dare [s]ay you are happy to find your[s]elf in England again." "Sincerely [s]o, Madam." "This thought Rebecca, is undoubtedly a daughter." "The Colonel mentions," re[s]umed the Lady, "that you would wi[s]h to engage as companion to an elderly Lady, or as governe[s]s to [s]ome genteel family of children." "Either [s]ituation would [s]uit me, Madam," [s]aid Rebecca; and if Lady Winterton could recommend me---." "Lady Winterton wants a companion her[s]elf," [s]aid the Lady, [s]miling; "but, perhaps, her age will be an objection." "By no means, Madam; I [s]hould give the preference to an elderly Lady." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] The Lady laughed; Rebecca blu[s]hed, and feared [s]he had been guilty of [s]ome impropriety. "Why, my dear creature," [s]aid the Lady, "I am afraid, then, that you and I [s]hall never agree, though Colonel Abthorpe [s]eemed to think that you might prove an acqui[s]ition to me; but I am too young for you, [s]o mu[s]t po[s]itively turn you over to my Lord; he is more adapted to your ta[s]te." "Your Lady[s]hip mu[s]t pardon my ignorance," [s]aid the trembling, blu[s]hing Rebecca; "I really had no idea." "Hear her! hear her! my dear Lord; [s]he had no idea that your [s]enatorial wi[s]dom could have for wife [s]uch an incon[s]iderate rattle. I would bet a thou[s]and pounds [s]he took you for my papa." "Your Lady[s]hip is plea[s]ed to di[s]play your wit at the expence of good manners," [s]aid his Lord[s]hip. "Oh! I humbly crave pardon," cried [s]he with a mo[s]t bewitching [s]mile, "I meant no offence; you know I cannot help other people's mi[s]takes; for my own part I think you infinitely charming; then twi[s]ting one of his grey locks round her beautiful fingers, [s]he continued: "The [s]now on the hills, and the icicles pendant from the leafle[s]s trees in December, are in my eyes, to the full as beautiful as the variegated fields and full-blown hawthorn in May. I like every thing in its [s]ea[s]on, and am moreover a great admirer of natural curio[s]ities." "Impertinent!" [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, ri[s]ing angrily, and quitting the room. "Well, now he is gone," [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, drawing her chair near Rebecca, "let us have a little [s]erious talk. You cannot [s]uppo[s]e that inclination led me to give my hand to that ludicrous piece of antiquity: No, my dear girl, I married him to [s]erve a father, whom next to heaven, I love, and to get from the power of an ill-natured old maiden aunt, who had kept me at [s]chool for fear I [s]hould mar her fortune, and despoil her of all her lovers; for [s]he had thirty thou[s]and pounds independent fortune, and that gave her wizened face and [s]keleton figure ten thou[s]and charms; [s]he or her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] fortune had admirers innumerable. I was always with her at the holidays. My Lord [s]aw me at the play. Charmed with the idea of getting me married out of the way, [s]he made her will, bequeathing to me all her fortune, in ca[s]e [s]he died without i[s][s]ue. "This was buzzed about---her lovers all for[s]ook her--- and poor aunty died of a broken heart in the fifty ninth year of her age! My father had married this Lady's [s]i[s]ter. He was poor. She was the co-heire[s]s of a la ge fortune; but alas! [s]he knew not that if [s]he married without her guardians con[s]ent, the whole of her fortune went to her elde[s]t [s]i[s]ter. "Di[s]appointment and [s]orrow [s]oon put a period to her exi[s]tence. My father continued in poverty, but I was committed to the care of my wealthy aunt. "At that time I became acquainted with Lord Winterton, my father's circum[s]tances were dreadfully embarrassed. My aunt would not advance a [s]ingle guinea to keep him from a gaol. I knew this marriage would place him in affluence, and at the age of [s]ixteen, gave my hand, promi[s]ed to love and obey, before my heart knew what love was. I have been married now five years; my temper is naturally cheerful, and I am an enemy to thought; but I have that within me which convinces me I have a heart alive to every delicate sensation of di[s]intere[s]ted tenderne[s]s. "You may, perhaps, think it odd, that I am thus open to a [s]tranger; but Colonel Abthorpe, who was the intimate friend of my father, has given you a character as bade me to wi[s]h to make an intere[s]t in your heart, that I may [s]ay I have one bo[s]om in which I can repo[s]e my [s]orrows, one friend who will pity my frailties." Rebecca felt inclined to love this unfortunate young creature from the fir[s]t moment [s]he beheld her. A very few words [s]erved to [s]ettle every preliminary, and it was agreed that the very next day [s]he [s]hould repair to her new [s]ituation. As the time allowed her was [s]o very [s]hort, Rebecca thought [s]he would make u[s]e of the re[s]t of that day to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] deliver all the other letters; "for," [s]aid [s]he, "it is right that I [s]hould wait on the[s]e Ladies, though I am [s]ettled with Lady Winterton; they may at [s]ome future period be of [s]ervice to me." She accordingly repaired to Mrs. Sackville's. Being [s]hewn into the drawing-room, a tall, meagre figure pre[s]ented it[s]elf, who [s]carcely deigned an inclination of the head as [s]he took the letter, and, waving her hand, cried, "Sit down young woman." Having read the letter---"And [s]o you have been in America, child? cried the Lady, with the [s]ame [s]olemn a[s]pect. "Well, I dare [s]ay, they are all in fine confusion there; but let their di[s]tre[s]s be ever [s]o great, it is no more than they de[s]erve, a parcel of rebels ." "They may have been mi[s]led," cried Rebecca, an enthu[s]ia[s]tic ardour animating her expre[s][s]ive countenance; "but they are in general a brave, benevolent [s]et of people." "'Tis a pity, as you are [s]o partial, you had not remained among[s]t them." "I had no friends there, Madam, and wi[s]hed to return to my native country." "Nay, you have not many friends here," [s]aid the Lady, with a [s]arca[s]tic [s]mile, "according to the Colonel's account." Rebecca's eyes filled with tears.---Mrs. Sackville continued: "I do not know of any body at pre[s]ent who wants a young per[s]on of your de[s]cription." "You will pardon me, Madam," [s]aid Rebecca, for this intru[s]ion; "I did it merely in re[s]pect to the generous attention of Colonel Abthorpe, who furni[s]hed me with [s]everal letters; but I have been [s]o fortunate as to be engaged this very morning as companion to Lady Winterton." "'Tis very well," [s]aid Mrs. Sackville, to[s][s]ing her head: "Lady Winterton, I believe, wanted a convenient friend, and very po[s][s]ible you may [s]uit her purpo[s]e: However young woman, do not [s]ay you go into her family without knowing what kind of a woman [s]he is. I have a very great regard for Lady Winterton, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] [s]hould be very [s]orry to [s]ay any thing to her disadvantage; but all the world knows [s]he married Lord Winterton to hide an infamous intrigue with a low bred fellow whom nobody knows. I thank heaven I have been brought up to know the real value of virtue, and [s]hould be very [s]orry to [s]ee a decent looking body, like yourself, companion to a woman of no principle: However, you are to do as you plea[s]e; I have given you my opinion, and you mu[s]t take the con[s]equence of rejecting my advice." She then rang the bell, and Rebecca departed with no very high opinion of her good nature, whatever her other virtues might be. She then repaired into the city, and delivered the other two letters, but neither of the ladies were at home; [s]he therefore immediately proceeded to her lodgings, and informed Mrs. Harris of the [s]ucce[s]s of her excur[s]ion. Mrs. Harris advi[s]ed her not to be di[s]heartened at the account Mrs. Sackville had given of Lady Winterton; but [s]hould [s]he find her the unprincipled woman [s]he had been repre[s]ented, to leave her immediately. "Surely," [s]aid Rebecca, "[s]he cannot be abandoned to vice; if her countenance is the index of her mind." On the evening of this day our heroine received a friendly letter from Mrs. Barton, who gave her a pressing invitation to vi[s]it her, and make her hou[s]e her home: but Rebecca dete[s]ted a [s]tate of dependence--- [s]he therefore wrote a grateful return to this invitation, and acquainted her with her engagement with Lady Winterton. VARIETY STILL. When Rebecca began to feel her[s]elf [s]ettled in Wimpole-[s]treet, [s]he al[s]o began to find that [s]he had entered on an entire new life.---Lady Winterton was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] extremely gay, [s]aw a great deal of company, and lived in one continued round of dre[s][s]ing, vi[s]iting, and public amu[s]ements. It was in vain for our heroine to object to accompanying her; [s]he had taken a peculiar fancy to her [s]ociety, and was never happy without her. Lord Winterton loved gaiety, and an o[s]tentatious di[s]play of grandeur as well as his Lady: She was therefore never abridged in her plea[s]ures, were they ever [s]o extravagant, and the old Peer thought him[s]elf amply repaid for the mo[s]t [s]plendid entertainments, or elegant pre[s]ents, by the [s]miles and good humour of his Lady, who, in [s]pite of her caprice and [s]atyrical wit, he tenderly loved. One morning Rebecca had accompanied her Lady to an auction, where they had [s]carcely been [s]eated ten minutes before a very elegant young man approached them, and being introduced to her as a Mr. Savage, a particular friend of her Lady[s]hip's, attached him[s]elf to them the whole morning.---Rebecca did not ob[s]erve any thing uncommon in his attentions to Lady Winterton, but [s]he thought, as he handed her Lady[s]hip to her carriage, [s]he [s]aw him put a folded paper into her hand, which [s]he immediately conveyed into her pocket. As it drew towards evening the Lady [s]eemed va[s]tly unea[s]y, e[s]pecially when [s]he found her Lord meant to [s]pend his evening at home: however, after [s]he had taken her tea, [s]he ordered her chariot. "Am I not then to have the plea[s]ure of your company, Fanny?" [s]aid his Lord[s]hip. "I propo[s]ed supping at home, becau[s]e I heard you were di[s]engaged." "Oh! my Lord, I [s]hall be home again in about two hours. Mi[s]s Littleton and I are only going to call on a [s]ick friend of her's." Rebecca [s]tared. Lady Winterton gave her a supplicating look, and, [s]urpri[s]ed as [s]he was, [s]he remained silent. "If Mi[s]s, Littleton wi[s]hes to vi[s]it her friends," [s]aid my Lord, "the chariot is certainly at her [s]ervice; but, [s]urely, my dear Fanny, you are not obliged to accompany her." "Indeed but I am! and I am [s]en[s]ible the Lady will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] take it very unkind were I to neglect going. Don't you think [s]he would, Rebecca." "I think," [s]aid Rebecca, timidly, "we may both venture to defer our vi[s]it till the morning, as my lord is [s]o kind as to [s]pend the evening at home." "Ah! that is your good nature, my dear; you would rather offend your friend, than lead me to disoblige my hu[s]band; but [s]uppo[s]e we [s]ettle it this way: I will go and [s]ee how the lady is, and you [s]hall [s]tay and engage my Lord at piquet. I [s]hall ju[s]t call at my mantua-maker's in my way home, and be with you again before [s]upper." "Your Lady[s]hip will pardon me," [s]aid Rebecca, giving her a penetrating look: "If you are re[s]olved to go, you [s]hall not have to [s]ay I am remi[s]s in the duty I owe my friend. I am ready to attend you, Madam," ri[s]ing, and ringing for her cloak. "For heaven's [s]ake! Lady Winterton," [s]aid Rebecca, as the chariot drove from the door, "what is the meaning of all this? You have di[s]tre[s][s]ed me beyond mea[s]ure, by calling on me to a[s][s]ert a fal[s]hood." "Now you are angry with me, Rebecca," [s]aid the Lady, taking her hand; "but pray think no more about it: I could contrive no other means to get away from that inqui[s]itive old man, without telling him where I was going." "And [s]urely your Lady[s]hip does not wi[s]h to go any where that would be offen[s]ive to your hu[s]band." "Oh! my dear girl, you will never forgive me, you are [s]uch a prudent creature your[s]elf; but I am going to meet ---, though, believe me, it [s]hall be the la[s]t time. I am going to meet ---, and take a la[s]t farewell of Savage." "By your Lady[s]hip's promi[s]ing it [s]hall be the la[s]t time, I am led to think it is not the fir[s]t. I could have excu[s]ed your making me acce[s][s]ary to [s]uch an affair: However, I [s]hall take care not to be liable to be drawn in a [s]econd time." "Ah! Mi[s]s Littleton, you have no compa[s][s]ion for a [s]u[s]ceptible heart." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] "Yes, Lady Winterton, I have, an infinite deal; I feel for you [s]incerely, if when your per[s]on is united to one, your heart is in the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of another. Your feelings, Madam, are involuntary; your actions are by no means [s]o: I am [s]en[s]ible you may not be able to conquer the weakne[s]s of your heart; but you certainly may avoid throwing your[s]elf into [s]ituations which may lead to criminality." The chariot [s]topped---Lady Winterton alighted--- and Rebecca followed her [s]ilently into a parlour, where Savage was eagerly expecting her. The en[s]uing [s]cene, to which our heroine was a witness, though it awakened all her compa[s][s]ion for the lovers, who in years, [s]entiments and manner, [s]eemed [s]o [s]uitable to each other, it gave her but an indifferent opinion of her Lady's prudence. Savage, from his conversation, appeared a man of [s]trict honour; he did not [s]eem to entertain an idea to the injury of his mi[s]tre[s]s; but that unfortunate woman, hurried on by the violence of her pa[s][s]ion, made a thou[s]and di[s]coveries of her unbounded affections, which, with a man of le[s]s integrity, might have precipitated her into everla[s]ting infamy. The promi[s]e of returning to [s]upper was entirely forgot. Rebecca reminded her of the hour: [s]he heard her not, and the clock [s]truck twelve before [s]he could bring her[s]elf to leave her lover. During their ride home Rebecca [s]poke not a [s]yllable except one or two laconic an[s]wers to her Lady's questions. She followed her into the hall, and, taking a candle from a [s]ervant, wi[s]hed her a good night, and ran ha[s]tily up [s]tairs, leaving Lady Winterton to make her excu[s]es to her hu[s]band for her breach of promi[s]e. The next morning, as [s]he was ri[s]ing, one of the maids brought her the following note. "For heaven's [s]ake! my dear Rebecca, do not contradict whatever you may hear me [s]ay at breakfa[s]t, as you value the peace of F. WINTERTON." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] Rebecca threw the note into the fire, and went down [s]tairs. Her Lord and Lady were already in the parlour. "And how do find your[s]elf this morning, my dear?" [s]aid her Lady[s]hip: "I vow you quite frightened me la[s]t night." "Are you often taken in [s]uch a [s]trange manner?" [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, with a look of concern. "No, indeed, my Lord; I was taken quite by surprise la[s]t night, and found my[s]elf very painfully affected. I never was taken that way before, but I have felt a return of the di[s]order this morning." "Indeed!" cried her Lady[s]hip, vi[s]ibly alarmed. "Yes, Madam; but as change of air may be of service to me, and your Lady[s]hip [s]eems terrified on my account, I [s]hall beg leave to retire to a friend's I have [s]ome few miles from town. I [s]hall go directly after breakfa[s]t, and will [s]end to-morrow for my trunks." "You do not mean to leave us, I hope?" "Yes, Madam; I fee; it impo[s][s]ible for me to remain with you any longer." Lady Winterton bur[s]t into tears. "Nay, Mi[s]s Littleton," [s]aid his Lord[s]hip, "you mu[s]t not leave us; my poor Fanny will break her heart." It was to no purpo[s]e for the Lady to weep, or her hu[s]band entreat: Rebecca remained inexorable, till Lord Winterton leaving them, his Lady earne[s]tly entreated her to forgive what was pa[s]t, and [s]he would never [s]ee Savage again. "Do not leave me, Rebecca," [s]aid [s]he; "you are my guardian angel; without you I [s]hall be inevitably lo[s]t!" This argument prevailed, and Rebecca con[s]ented to [s]tay, in hopes of drawing her Lady from her unfortunate attachment. The winter was now entirely supplauted by the gay-robed [s]pring, and our heroine began to [s]igh for retirement, [s]ilver [s]treams, and [s]hady groves. Lady Winterton, to oblige her, propo[s]ed [s]pending a few weeks at Chi[s]wick, where they had an elegant [s]eat. It was a charming evening in the beginning of June; the ruddy [s]treaks of the parting [s]un-beams had given place to [s]ober grey; the moon with [s]ilver cre[s]cent [s]hed a feeble light, and the [s]tars, by imperceptible degrees, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] appeared in the blue expance of heaven, till all was one continued [s]cene of radiant glory. A nightingale perched on a thorn, was tuning her melancholy pipe, and the zephyrs pa[s][s]ed gently over a long canal, wa[s]ting on their wings the di[s]tant [s]ound of the tinkling [s]heep bell, and the ru[s]tic [s]hepherd's whi[s]tle. Rebecca had left her Lady in an alcove at the bottom of the garden, and wandered into the plea[s]ure ground. The beauty of the [s]urrounding [s]cene had given a [s]oft [s]erenity to her mind, and [s]he [s]at down to indulge reflections, which, if not ab[s]olutely plea[s]ant, were far from painful. She had not [s]at long before [s]he ob[s]erved two men gliding among the trees, and proceeding as it were towards the garden. At fir[s]t [s]he felt rather terri[s]ied, but the idea of Savage [s]triking her, [s]he ha[s]tened toward the place where [s]he had left her Lady. She had hardly got half way before [s]he felt her[s]elf [s]uddenly [s]eized by a person, who [s]oftly bid her not be alarmed, he only meant to prevent her di[s]turbing an agreeable tete a tete , to which a friend of his had been invited, and which he was determined [s]hould not be interrupted by her. Rebecca trembled exce[s][s]ively, for, by the voice, and what little [s]he could di[s]cern of his features, [s]he discovered the per[s]on who held her to be no other than Lord O[s][s]iter. "Whoever your friend is," [s]aid [s]he, "he can have no bu[s]ine[s]s here. Unhand me, Sir, or I will alarm the hou[s]e." "You mu[s]t cry pretty loud, then, my dear, for you are a good di[s]tance from it; but [s]tay, have I not [s]een your face before? Yes, by heavens!" At that moment, a loud [s]hriek from the alcove, and a cla[s]thing of [s]words, made him relinqui[s]h his hold, and run toward the place from whence the [s]ound proceeded. Rebecca followed as fa[s]t as her trembling limbs would permit; but what a [s]cene pre[s]ented it[s]elf to her view. Savage on his knees, [s]upporting the bleeding, and apparently lifele[s]s body of Lady Winterton, and O[s][s]iter [s]truggling to wre[s]t a [s]word from the hands of her Lord, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] who foamed with rage, and threatened in[s]tant death to the betrayer of his honour! "Infamous wretch!" [s]aid the enraged hu[s]band, when he beheld our heroine; "this is your doings, you contrived and winked at their meetings, and mo[s]t conveniently left your vile friend to entertain her lover, while you whiled away your time with that di[s]grace to nobility! Begone---leave my hou[s]e this night---thou pe[s]t to [s]ociety! I have long been informed of your [s]candalous proceedings, but would not believe till occular demonstration left me nothing to doubt." Terrified and di[s]tre[s][s]ed as Rebecca was, [s]he could not but wi[s]h to [s]tay to afford what relief was in her power to her Lady, but this was denied her. She had a[s][s]i[s]ted Savage to bathe her temples with hart[s]horn, and [s]aw her open her eyes, when the [s]ervants entered, took her in their arms, and bore her to the hou[s]e, where Rebecca was forbade to enter, and any [s]ervant who [s]hould dare to afford her [s]helter, threatened with in[s]tant di[s]mi[s][s]ion. "What now is to become of me!" [s]aid [s]he, [s]inking on the ground as the door was [s]hut again[s]t her: "What next will be the fate of the wretched Rebecca." "Love, affluence, and plea[s]ure," [s]aid Lord O[s][s]iter, endeavouring to rai[s]e her. "Say rather death and infamy, my Lord; my reputation is wounded---my peace of mind de[s]troyed. Oh! that my heart would break, and let me re[s]t forever!" "Re[s]t in my arms," [s]aid he, rudely embracing her. She [s]hrieked. "Forbear, my Lord," [s]aid Savage, approaching; "this lady has been the friend of my adored Fanny, and no one [s]hall in[s]ult her with impunity." "Your humble [s]ervant," cried O[s][s]iter; "I understand you, and have done, only give me leave to inform you, that this pretty imaculate piece of prudery, about four years [s]ince, was in a ready furni[s]hed hou[s]e of my providing, from whence [s]he thought fit to elope, and has, I make no doubt, [s]een a great deal of life [s]ince that period." Rebecca could hear no more---a [s]udden chillne[s]s ran [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] through her veins---[s]he re[s]pired with difficulty---her head grew giddy---and [s]he [s]unk into in[s]en[s]ibility. When [s]he recovered, recollection retained but faint traces of the pa[s]t [s]cenes; it [s]eemed like a di[s]turbed dream.--- "Where am I?" [s]aid [s]he.---Lord O[s][s]iter approached the bed-[s]ide---"You are in [s]afety, my angel," [s]aid he, "only compo[s]e your [s]pirits, and nothing [s]hall be omitted that can make you happy." She turned her head from him, wept, but could not an[s]wer. "You mu[s]t not di[s]turb her," [s]aid a medical gentleman, who had been called in. "Quiet and re[s]t is absolutely nece[s][s]ary to pre[s]erve her life." "Exert your utmo[s]t [s]kill, doctor," [s]aid O[s][s]iter, "to [s]ave her, and we will be guided entirely by your directions." "Then leave her to the care of the nur[s]e to-night, and do not attempt to [s]ee her before noon to-morrow." O[s][s]iter ki[s][s]ed her hand, bowed, and retired. Rebecca heard the door [s]hut: [s]he rai[s]ed her head to look at the doctor, and perceived, to her great joy, he was a grave, decent looking man. She made [s]ome excuse to [s]end the nur[s]e out of the room; then taking both the doctor's hands in her's, cried, "Oh! good Sir, if you have any compa[s][s]ion in your nature, [s]hew it now to a poor di[s]tre[s][s]ed orphan and [s]ave her." "My dear child," [s]aid he, "do not alarm your[s]elf, you are not in any immediate danger." "Oh! Sir, you mi[s]take me, it is not death I fear, it is di[s]honour. Alas! I know not where I am; but I fear I am entirely in the power of a man who will sacrifice me to his unhallowed pa[s][s]ion." "Then you did not come with him voluntarily?" "No! no! heaven knows I did not; I was in a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility." An intere[s]ting conver[s]ation now took place---the doctor was convinced of Rebecca's innocence, and bribing the nur[s]e to a[s][s]i[s]t, about twelve o'clock they helped the poor [s]ufferer to get on her clothes, [s]upported her down [s]tairs, and carried her in triumph to his own hou[s]e. RETROSPECTION AND NEW CHARACTERS. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] Though Lady Winterton had [s]olemnly promi[s]ed Rebecca to hold no farther corre[s]pondence with Savage, her love overpowered every good re[s]olution, and [s]he had [s]een him [s]everal times previous to their leaving London; for what man of gallantry can refu[s]e the request of a woman he tenderly loves, though rigid honour bids him fly her [s]ociety. Fanny, the lovely unfortunate Fanny, entreated another interview; it was impossible to avoid it, but each one was meant to be the la[s]t. Lord O[s][s]ter was by no means the bo[s]om friend of Savage, but he had, by accident, become ma[s]ter of this [s]ecret, and was therefore reque[s]ted to accompany him to Chi[s]wick, where he had enjoyed [s]everal interviews with Lady Winterton before the la[s]t fatal one. Lord Winterton's valet had ob[s]erved his Lady's evening walks, and made the important di[s]covery that [s]he had a lover. He informed his Lord, from that moment her [s]teps were watched, [s]he was di[s]covered in the alcove--- Savage at her feet---her cheek re[s]ted on his forehead--- her hand upon his [s]houlder, and tears were streaming from her eyes. "Turn, villain," [s]aid Lord Winterton, "and desend your[s]elf." Savage aro[s]e, and drew his [s]word; the frantic Lady threw her arms about him, and received her hu[s]band's [s]word in her own bo[s]om. She [s]ell, and O[s][s]iter at that moment entering, prevented the death of her lover, who would certainly have fallen a victim to the hu[s]band's rage, had not timely a[s][s]i[s]tance arrived. The gentle innocent Rebecca was involved in her Lady's crime; [s]he was [s]uppo[s]ed acce[s][s]ary to the interviews, and forbade to enter the hou[s]e, when [s]he fainted as was mentioned in the preceding chapter. O[s][s]iter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] represented her to Savage as a woman of a very light character, and he, unwilling to quit a place where he might hope to hear whether his Fanny [s]till lived, [s]uffered that de[s]igning nobleman to carry her to the chai[s]e which waited for them, and convey her to the neare[s]t inn. Here he ordered her to be put to bed, [s]ent for a doctor, and, having [s]trongly recommended her to his care, retired, after a [s]light [s]upper, to bed, rejoicing in an accident which had again put in his power a woman whom, though he had given up all thoughts of gaining, he could never entirely forget. How great then was his [s]urpri[s]e when, enquiring for her the next morning, he found doctor, nur[s]e and patient, all ab[s]conded. He repaired to the doctor's hou[s]e, but could not obtain admittance. He cur[s]ed the meddling fellow in his heart, vowed revenge again[s]t Rebecca, and [s]et off for London. In the regular cheerful family of Dr. Ryland our heroine [s]oon recovered her health, and in a great mea[s]ure her [s]pirits. She made enquiry concerning the fate of her Lady, and learned that, though [s]he had recovered from her wound, [s]he laboured under a very ill [s]tate of health, which, they feared, would terminate in a decline. Rebecca gave a [s]igh to her hard fate, and wished [s]he might conquer her pa[s][s]ion, and be prepared to meet that peace in another world [s]he had failed of finding in this. Dr. Ryland was a truly benevolent man, but he had a large family, and no great degree of practice, it was therefore a thing not to be expected that our heroine could remain with them long, and in the poor [s]ituation [s]he then was, without money or cloaths, [s]he could not think of returning to incumber Mrs. Harris. She had informed Mrs. Ryland that [s]he wi[s]hed to get a place in [s]ome genteel family, where [s]he could render her[s]elf useful without much hard labour; that Lady enquired among her friends, and learned that the Lady of a neighbouring ju[s]tice wanted a young per[s]on to get up her [s]mall linen, make her caps, bonnets, gowns, &c. and occa[s]ionally to take care of the family when the Lady [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] was out. Rebecca joyfully waited on Mrs. Penure; the kind Mrs. Ryland accompanied her, gave her [s]uch a character as [s]he de[s]erved, and had the plea[s]ure to find [s]he entirely [s]uited the Lady's plan. The [s]alary was [s]mall, but Rebecca had but few wants to [s]upply; to be neat was now all [s]he required, indeed it was all [s]he could henceforth expect. The doctor advanced a few guineas to provide her a change of clothes, for [s]he had [s]ent repeatedly, without effect, for her trunk from Lord Winterton's, and, in the cour[s]e of a week, from the time [s]he waited on the Lady, Rebecca became an inmate in the family of the wor[s]hipful Ju[s]tice Penure. Jacob Penure had, from a very low [s]tation in a reputable trade[s]man's family, rai[s]ed him[s]elf, by indefatigable indu[s]try, to the confidence of his ma[s]ter, and a [s]hare in the bu[s]ine[s]s, at the age of twenty-three. The fair Mi[s]s Abigail Prune, who had, in the younger part of her life, [s]erved [s]everal ladies in quality of waiting woman, but who now kept her brother's hou[s]e, ca[s]t on him the eyes of affection. Mi[s]s Abigail was to be [s]ure rather pa[s]t her prime, having [s]een forty [s]ea[s]ons revolve, and noted their various change, without the lea[s]t hope of ever changing her own maidenly condition to the more honourable one of wife. Mr. Jacob was a comely young man. She reviewed her own countenance in the gla[s]s; [s]he could not but perceive the traces made by the hand of time. She was above the middle [s]ize, extremely thin, and had a [s]hape, not "[s]mall by degrees, and beautifully le[s]s;" but [s]o exactly [s]traight, that it was impo[s][s]ible to perceive the lea[s]t difference between the bottom and the top, and in[s]tead of that roundne[s]s, which con[s]titutes elegance in the form of a woman, her wai[s]t was as perfectly flat as though [s]he had been pre[s][s]ed between two boards. Her arms were long; her hands large, hard and boney; her face was round, but it was that kind of roundne[s]s that expre[s][s]es in[s]ignificance. The [s]mall remains of teeth [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed might have been termed beautiful in [s]ome parts of the world, for they were of jetty hue, and from her hollow [s]ockets, over which could be di[s]cerned [s]carcely the trace of brows, twinkled two extremely [s]mall black eyes. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] The tip of her diminutive no[s]e was elevated. Her complexion might have rivalled the tints of the mo[s]t beautiful orange lilly. Such was the per[s]on of Mi[s]s Abigail. We will leave her accompli[s]hments and temper to [s]peak for them[s]elves. Mr. Jacob Penure knew his own intere[s]t too well to think of [s]lighting the maiden's advances. She had five hundred pounds in her own po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, the accumulated [s]avings of near twenty years [s]ervitude; be[s]ides, her brother had no children, and he had much money. Mr. Prune was far from di[s]plea[s]ed with his [s]i[s]ter's choice. Penure was an attentive, indu[s]trious young man; he made him equal partner with him[s]elf, and in about fifteen years they found them[s]elves in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of a very hand[s]ome fortune. About this time the old gentleman died. All his po[s][s]e[s][s]ions devolved to his [s]i[s]ter, and Penure re[s]olved, though [s]orely again[s]t his wife's opinion, to leave trade, and retire into the country. Here he was cho[s]en ju[s]tice of the peace, and by his integrity and gentlene[s]s in the execution of his office, gained the love of all who knew him. He was a humane friendly character, but he [s]tood in fear of his wife. The morning after Rebecca's arrival, the breakfa[s]t things removed, (for [s]he was to eat at their table,) Mrs. Penure de[s]ired our heroine to accompany her up [s]tairs. "I am mightily glad," [s]aid the lady, [s]itting down by a large old-fa[s]hioned ca[s]e of drawers, and taking an enormous bunch of keys from her pocket, "I am mightily glad to have met with a young per[s]on like you, who can make me up a few [s]mart things. I love to be genteel, and wear as good things as my neighbours; but really it is [s]o expen[s]ive to have any thing done at the milliners, and if one gets any journey-woman to come home, they always a[s]k for as much again [s]tuff as they want, and [s]teal half of it. Now I do hate to be cheated: I don't mind giving away a bit of ribband or gauze that is left, but it provokes me to have it taken away [s]lyly." During this harangue, [s]he had pulled from her drawers an immen[s]e quantity of yellow wa[s]hed gauze, old [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] mu[s]lin, and thread lace, that bore the [s]tronge[s]t marks of antiquity. She admired the cap our heroine had on, and wi[s]hed to have one made like it; but among the medley of trumpery [s]he had di[s]played, Rebecca could not [s]elect any thing fit for the purpo[s]e: be[s]ides, our heroine's head, though neat and plain, [s]till retained an air of fa[s]hion. Mrs. Penure's lank black hair was combed in the exacte[s]t manner over a roll, and drawn up as tight behind as po[s][s]ible; how then could the [s]ame cap [s]uit both?---However, an attempt mu[s]t be made. The Lady a[s][s]ured Rebecca, that her lace, mu[s]lin, &c. were very valuable, and in[s]i[s]ted on not only one but [s]everal caps being produced from tho[s]e materials; at the [s]ame time [s]he opened a cabinet, in which were arranged, rolled in the neate[s]t manner round cards, every ribband [s]he had ever had in her po[s][s]e[s][s]ion. "See, young woman," [s]aid [s]he, exultingly, "here are variety of ribbands, take your choice, let my caps be trimmed hand[s]omely, but don't wa[s]te any; I hate wa[s]te, [s]o, if you can avoid it, don't cut them." Rebecca could not [s]uppre[s]s a [s]mile at the [s]olemn manner in which this trea[s]ury of old-fa[s]hioned dirty, faded ribbands was committed to her charge. However, [s]he promi[s]ed to exert her abilities to plea[s]e, and was beginning to form a cap, but her mi[s]tre[s]s had not yet done with her. "I [s]uppo[s]e," [s]aid [s]he, "you will want linings and wire; be[s]ides, you will not be all day making two or three caps: I want a bonnet or two made, and my be[s]t cloak fre[s]h trimmed." "I am afraid I [s]hall not be able to do all in one day, Madam." "Well, you mu[s]t do as much as you can, child, don't be idle, I hate idle people. I hope you don't love reading." Rebecca he[s]itated; [s]he would not utter a fal[s]ehood. "I think it an agreeable amu[s]ement, but I will never neglect my bu[s]ine[s]s." "No, indeed, I hope not, reading is the ruination of all young people. I never read a book in my life but my Bible, and the Hou[s]e-keeper's A[s][s]i[s]tant. I was always [s]tudying to make the mo[s]t of my time and how to [s]ave or earn a penny." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] A fre[s]h cargo was now di[s]played to the wondering eyes of Rebecca, of old mode, yellow, white [s]ar[s]enet, skeleton wires, pa[s]te board and blond lace, out of which [s]he was de[s]ired to produce a [s]mart bonnet or two." "It is impo[s][s]ible, madam," [s]aid [s]he, "utterly impossible; the bonnets worn now are [s]o different from what were worn ten years [s]ince. You mu[s]t, indeed, Madam, afford your[s]elf new materials to make a genteel bonnet." Her arguments were vain; all [s]he could obtain was a yard of mode, and four yards of riband, while Mrs. Penure declared [s]he was leading her into extravagance, and that the bonnet mu[s]t la[s]t her [s]even years. It is impo[s][s]ible to give a direct idea of our heroine's [s]en[s]ations, when this mi[s]erable woman, out of oftentation, di[s]played to her the trea[s]ures of her wardrobe. Here were gowns, petticoats, nay, even [s]tockings and linen, which [s]he could no longer mend or wear, carefully laid by her! Her narrow [s]oul could not even expand it[s]elf to give to others what [s]he could no longer u[s]e her[s]elf the very wire that came out of her old caps was twisted, kept and put in a box devoted for that purpo[s]e; hats that bore the date of twenty years by their fa[s]hion; old [s]tays, [s]hoes and gloves, all were pre[s]erved, though scarcely worth acceptance by the poore[s]t per[s]on. Her hou[s]e-keeping was of a piece with the re[s]t; every thing was under lock and key; bread and [s]mall beer were the only things to which the [s]ervants had free access; her table, it is true, was well [s]upplied, but it was oftentation, not liberality, occa[s]ioned it. Her female vi[s]itors were [s]eldom a[s]ked to take more than one gla[s]s of wine after dinner, for when [s]he had taken half a gla[s]s her[s]elf [s]he would return the [s]topper to the decanter, and cry, "I never allow my[s]elf more," This was the [s]ignal, and the wine was immediately removed, when [s]he would [s]ay, "but perhaps, ma'am, you would have liked another gla[s]s?" It cannot be expected, in [s]uch a family, that our heroine could be happy; [s]he endeavoured to be content, but the effort was vain. Mr. Penure [s]aw [s]he was far superior to the [s]tation [s]he was in; he pitied her, but he could do no more, without incurring the anger of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] woman whom he had been accu[s]tomed to obey, and dreaded to offend. It happened one afternoon, when his Lady-wife was gone to pay a vi[s]it of ceremony (a thing not very customary with him) the ju[s]tice took his tea at home. Rebecca was [s]ummoned to the parlour to make it; but, alas! Rebecca could produce only a tea [s]poonful of black tea, and a very [s]mall quantity of [s]ugar. "Why, [s]ure, child, you are not allowanced in tea and [s]ugar?" [s]aid he, with a look of di[s]plea[s]ure. "There is plenty for me, Sir," [s]aid [s]he, affecting a [s]mile, and---. "By heavens!" [s]aid the ju[s]tice, [s]tamping with passion, "you [s]hall make no excu[s]e for her; confound the [s]tingy narrow-hearted---. "Hold, Sir, I be[s]eech you," cried Rebecca; "you quite terrify me!" "I am [s]orry for it, child," [s]aid he; "but to think my wife [s]hould dare treat you thus, you who are every way her [s]uperior, and who, if I mi[s]take not, was born to be [s]erved by others, not be a [s]ervant your[s]elf!" "You are mi[s]taken, Sir," [s]aid our heroine, her eyes falling as [s]he [s]poke: "Indeed you are mi[s]taken. I am a poor orphan, without friends or connexions, and have only to lament that my education has been [s]uperior to my fate. My birth was humble, and, I tru[s]t, my heart is humble; but my feelings are [s]ometimes more than I can well bear. The ju[s]tice rang the bell; he wi[s]hed to hide his emotions. "Get me [s]ome tea and [s]ugar," [s]aid he, giving half a guinea to a [s]ervant who entered. He then drew his chair toward our heroine, took one of her hands, and told her "he felt inclined to prove him[s]elf her friend, if [s]he would direct by what means to do it." "Be not alarmed, my lovely girl," [s]aid he, "though my eyes acknowledge you beautiful, my heart only feels for you as for a [s]i[s]ter, or a daughter. If you can venture to make me your friend, confide in me, and tru[s]t to my hone[s]t intention; I will [s]erve you to the utmo[s]t of my power." During tea Rebecca had di[s]clo[s]ed to her ma[s]ter the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] chief incidents of her life, veiling only tho[s]e which concerned Sir George. Time had pa[s][s]ed unob[s]erved. The ju[s]tice had drawn forth his pur[s]e, and putting ten guinias into the hands of Rebecca, entreated her to accept them as the gift of a father. She [s]trenuou[s]ly oppo[s]ed the liberal donation. He had taken her hand, and closing it with the money within it, held it while he was [s]peaking, when the door opened, and Mrs. Penure [s]tood before them. The ju[s]tice [s]tarted, and dropped Rebecca's hand. The money fell to the floor. The rage of Mrs. Penure inflamed her features, and [s]hot from her eyes; [s]he could not [s]peak, but [s]hrieking in a terrific manner flew at Rebecca, and would have made her feel the weight of her tremenduous hand, had not her hu[s]band [s]tepped between them. She recovered her [s]peech. "Profligate wretch," [s]aid [s]he "vile, ungenerous villain! is it thus my tenderne[s]s and conde[s]cen[s]ion, in taking you to my bed, is re-paid? Is my money to be [s]quandered on your painted Jezabels that you bring into my hou[s]e to di[s]honor me? Oh! my unfortunate lot! Mu[s]t I beggarred by an ungrateful wretch? Yes, I [s]ee all my property will be wa[s]ted, and I [s]hall go to the work-house." Here her tears broke out, and what with sobbing and [s]creaming [s]he became unintelligible. Rebecca would not [s]top to vindicate her[s]elf. She retired to her room in [s]ilence, and [s]oon after received a me[s][s]age from her mi[s]tre[s]s to leave the hou[s]e, who, at the [s]ame time, made her ill behaviour a plea for not paying her wages, though [s]he had been in the family above four months. As [s]he was going out at the gate to [s]eek the London coach, one of the [s]ervants put a folded paper in her hand. On opening it [s]he [s]aw not the ten guineas, but a ten pound note, with the[s]e words: "I know you have not been paid; accept this as a [s]mall return for your [s]ervices. God ble[s]s you, and make you happy. J. Penure ." OLD ACQUAINTANCE RENEWED. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] The coach [s]at Rebecca down in Piccadilly; it was quite dark. She thought it was be[s]t to go immediately to Mrs. Harris's, and determined to take a coach for that purpo[s]e. As [s]he [s]tood waiting for her trunk to be taken from the boot, two genteel young men pa[s][s]ed her, one of which turned round, and regarding her attentively, "it is her, by heavens!" [s]aid he, and flew towards her.---Rebecca turned [s]uddenly round, and discovered the features of Sir George Worthy. "My angelic Rebecca!" [s]aid he, folding her in his arms, regardle[s]s of the place where they [s]tood, "do I once more behold you? Do I indeed cla[s]p you to my brea[s]t, or is it an illu[s]ion?" "Sir George," [s]aid [s]he, [s]truggling to free her[s]elf from his embrace, "I rejoice to [s]ee you well; but I know not what I have done to de[s]erve this in[s]ult." "Who [s]hall dare in[s]ult you, my adorable girl? I have found you after [s]uch a long [s]eparation, when I thought you lo[s]t for ever, and we will never part again." "For heaven's [s]ake let me go Sir George. Why am I thus detained? Are you not married?" By this time a crowd had gathered round them. An old [s]ailor [s]eeing a woman in di[s]tre[s]s ru[s]hed forward, and [s]truck Sir George a blow that made him relinqui[s]h his hold. Rebecca [s]prang from him, and forgetful of her trunk, ran ha[s]tily down St. James's-[s]treet. When [s]he had reached the bottom [s]he [s]topped to recover her breath, and then proceeded [s]lowly down Pall-Mall. A poor mi[s]erable looking object, who[s]e emaciated frame was but thinly [s]heltered by a tattered mode cloak for gown [s]he had none, from nocturnal damps, supporing her feeble [s]teps by holding by the iron rails before [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] one of the hou[s]es, in a weak, tremulous voice entreated charity. Rebecca never turned a[s]ide from the [s]upplications of mi[s]ery. She [s]topped, and put her hand in her pocket. They [s]tood immediately under two large lamps. "Merciful heaven!" cried the poor mendicant, laying her cold hand on the one Rebecca had extended with relief, and gazing ardently at her---"Rebecca! my child! do you not know me?" Our heroine looked intently on the pale vi[s]age of the object before her; mi[s]ery and [s]ickne[s]s had [s]omewhat altered it, but [s]he [s]aw it was her mother. The feelings of a daughter ru[s]hed impetuou[s]ly over her heart. She [s]unk on her knees upon the pavement, and, cla[s]ping her parent in her arms, exclaimed, "Oh, my mother! my dear di[s]tre[s][s]ed mother!" and bur[s]t into an agony of tears. When the tumult of their feelings were [s]ub[s]ided, Rebecca thought of calling a coach, but where were they to drive? She could not think of taking her mother to Mrs. Harris's; they therefore drove to a [s]treet in Westminster, where Mrs. Serl had formerly lodged, and were fortunate enough to meet with an apartment empty. Here their mutual embraces and endearments were again renewed: Rebecca wept for joy at having found a parent who[s]e future life [s]he would endeavour to make happy, and Mrs. Serl [s]hed tears of contrition for having once treated [s]o unworthily [s]o good a daughter. She informed Rebecca that after they left Lincolnshire Serl commenced game[s]ter, [s]harper and [s]windler; that his daughter went on the town, and turned an abandoned profligate; and that, at la[s]t overwhelmed with poverty and di[s]grace, Serl him[s]elf had died in the FlectPrison, leaving her in the greate[s]t di[s]tre[s]s, having neither clothes, money, or friends. Her annuity had been long [s]ince [s]old, and [s]he mu[s]t have peri[s]hed, had [s]he not providentially met with her daughter. When Rebecca viewed her mother's tattered garments, and thought of getting her more comfortable clothing, her own trunk recurred to her memory. "I hope [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] it is not lo[s]t," [s]aid [s]he; "and it is lucky what little money I po[s][s]e[s]s is in my pocket." Her mother informed her that there was [s]ome decent apparel at a pawn broker's in the neighbourhood, and Rebecca, having received in[s]tructions in what manner to proceed, went out in order to get it; but what was her a[s]toni[s]hment, on opening the parcel when [s]he had brought it home, to [s]ee a gown made of a piece of India chints, which [s]he remembered to have had in her trunk when it was [s]ent into Lincoln[s]hire, with a mu[s]lin apron, and [s]everal other things, which [s]he equally knew to be her own. "Gracious heaven!" [s]aid [s]he, dropping the parcel from her hands, and fixing her eyes on her mother. "What is the matter, my dear?" [s]aid Mrs. Serl; "that was a gown given me by poor Serl; it had been bought for his fir[s]t wife." "It was mine," [s]aid Rebecca, in a firm voice. "If he told you it was his, he told a fal[s]hood; it was in the trunk which I lo[s]t four years ago." An explanation now took place, which convinced Mrs. Serl what a villain [s]he had cho[s]en to [s]ucceed the worthy Mr. Littleton; but our heroine would not [s]uffer her to make any painful retro[s]pects, or to accu[s]e her[s]elf. She poured the [s]weet balm of affectionate con[s]olation into the bo[s]om of her mother. She forgot her own forrows, and [s]eemed to have no with but to render her parent the like forgetful of every pa[s]t di[s]agreeable event. The next morning [s]he repaired to the hou[s]e where the [s]tage had [s]topped in Piccadilly to enquire for her trunk. "The old gentleman took it away with him," [s]aid one of the waiters, "and paid all expences;" for Rebecca, in her fright the preceding night, had not paid her fare to town. "What old gentleman?" [s]aid [s]he, [s]urpri[s]ed. "Why, the old gentleman who knocked the young man down that was [s]o rude to you. He read the directions on the trunk when it was taken from the boot, [s]wore he was your uncle, and in[s]i[s]ted on having it; as he offered to pay all expences the coachman did not refuse, and both he and the young man went off together [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] to [s]earch for you; but returned in about an hour, and left word, if you [s]hould call this morning, for me to tell you, you might hear of your trunk at number 46, Bedford-Square." "That is Lord O[s][s]iter's," [s]aid Rebecca, [s]carcely able to re[s]pire. "And, moreover," [s]aid the man, "the young gentleman told me, if I could find where you was gone, or could bring him to a [s]ight of you, he would give me ten guineas, and [s]o, [s]eeing as how you are here, we had better take a coach and go together." "No," [s]aid Rebecca, [s]truggling to [s]uppre[s]s her emotions, "No, I cannot go ju[s]t now; in the afternoon it will be more convenient. I will ju[s]t [s]tep back to my lodgings, and return to you again by two o'clock." The man was [s]atisfied. Rebecca tripped out of the hou[s]e, called a coach, and drove home. During her little ride her mind dwelt on the [s]ingularity of the circumstance. She had ju[s]t heard the man, who re[s]cued her from Sir George's in[s]ults, had gone away with him, had taken her trunk, and directed her to find it at Lord Ossiter's. It was an inexplicable riddle; he had called himself her uncle, but [s]he knew [s]he had but one uncle and he was abroad in the navy. She was certainly fortunate in e[s]caping a [s]nare, which [s]he had no doubt was laid to trepan her. Lord O[s][s]iter had, perhaps, represented her to Sir George as an abandoned creature, devoid of virtue or principal; and that gentleman, once [s]o esteemed, [s]o re[s]pected, was now con[s]idered as one, who, believing her lo[s]t to honour, would join his Lord[s]hip in any [s]tratagem to decoy her into his power. Full of the[s]e ideas, [s]he told her mother [s]he would immeadiately remove from the apartments [s]he then occupied, le[s]t [s]he [s]hould have been watched home, and Sir George might be directed where to find her. "Alas! my dear mother," [s]aid [s]he, "I am [s]en[s]ible of my own weakne[s]s. I hope I love virtue as well as woman ought; but I know I love Sir George, and though he is the hu[s]band of another; though rea[s]on, religon, honour, all plead again[s]t my pa[s][s]ion, [s]till, [s]till it is [s]o engraven on my heart, that to eradicate it, I feel [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] is totally impo[s][s]ible. Can I then an[s]wer for my own fortitude? I fear not: I might [s]ink under powerful temptations; let me then fulfil my duty, and avoid them." Her mother approved and [s]trengthened the[s]e resolutions, and, having but very few things to put together, in le[s]s than two hours they were in a new lodging near Millbank, Wettmin[s]ter. Here Rebecca [s]unk under the fatigue of body, and agitation of mind [s]he had undergone, and a fever en[s]ued, which brought her almo[s]t to the brink of the grave. The [s]trength of a good constitution [s]oon combated the violence of the di[s]order, and [s]he began to recover her [s]trength, when her mother was attacked with one more alarming; this was the smallpox, which, to a per[s]on of her years, was expected to be fatal. Ten pounds was all the worldly wealth Rebecca possessed when [s]he met her mother; but ten pounds in a hou[s]e of [s]ickne[s]s would la[s]t but a very [s]hort time; [s]he, therefore on examining the contents of her pur[s]e, when her mother [s]ickened, found it contained but fifteen shillings, and there was a doctor's bill to pay. It was al[s]o nece[s][s]ary his attendance [s]hould be continued to Mrs. Serl, who[s]e life was in imminent danger. During the fir[s]t ten days of her mother's illne[s]s Rebecca hardly left her bed[s]ide, denying her[s]elf almo[s]t the nece[s][s]aries of life, in order to lengthen out her little [s]tore; but on the fourteenth day [s]he was pronounced out of danger, and that good nur[s]ing, and nouri[s]hing food, was all that was nece[s][s]ary to her re[s]toration. "Alas!" [s]aid Rebecca, "I have no po[s][s]ible means of procuring tho[s]e nece[s][s]ary comforts." She was stooping, as [s]he [s]poke, to take [s]ome gruel from the fire, the pin of her handkercheif dropped out, and the picture of Lady Mary [s]wung forward again[s]t her hand. Rebecca gazed at it mournfully.---"True," [s]aid [s]he, "it is [s]et in gold, and might afford a temporary [s]upply; but, then, is it not the portrait of my adored benefactre[s]s? And does it not al[s]o contain the [s]emblance of the only man I ever did or ever can love? Duty [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] alas! what right have I to talk of love? Is he not already married? And were he not, have I not given a [s]olemn vow never to li[s]ten to his addre[s][s]es? Fooli[s]h, fooli[s]h, Rebecca! why do[s]t thou nouri[s]h a pa[s][s]ion that mu[s]t be forever hopele[s]s?" She was returning the picture to her bo[s]om, when it [s]truck her [s]he might, perhaps, get the minature carefully taken out, and di[s]po[s]e of the gold in which they were [s]et. "If [s]o," [s]aid [s]he, "I may comfort my mother, and yet pre[s]erve the re[s]pect due to the portrait of Lady Mary." THE BENEVOLENT LADY. Rebecca was [s]o plea[s]ed with the project of rai[s]ing a [s]upply of money from the gold, that [s]he told her mother [s]he would go out for half an hour and breathe the fre[s]h air, as [s]he found the confinement [s]he had [s]uffered rather impeded her returning [s]trength. When [s]he was out [s]he thought, by extending her walk, [s]he [s]hould feel her[s]elf refre[s]hed, [s]he therefore cro[s][s]ed the Park, and going out at Spring Gardens Gate, [s]topped at an eminent gold[s]mith's in Cock[s]pur-[s]treet, and reque[s]ted him to take the pictures carefully out, and purcha[s]e the [s]etting. The man had ju[s]t taken it in his hand, and was admiring the neatne[s]s of the workman[s]hip, and the curious contrivance of the [s]pring, when a chariot [s]topped at the door, and a beautiful young Lady immediately entered. The ma[s]ter of the [s]hop held the picture open in his hand while he received the Lady's orders concerning a pair of bracelets. The portrait caught her eye: "Ble[s]s me," [s]aid [s]he, "Pray who[s]e is that? it is [s]o like a person that I know."--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] "It belongs to that young woman, Madam; [s]he wi[s]hes to [s]ell the gold without the pictures." The Lady had not before ob[s]erved Rebecca; but now her pale, but beautiful intere[s]ting countenance [s]truck her. "It is a pity to have them un[s]et," [s]aid [s]he. Will you part with it altogether? I will give you twice the value of the gold." "I cannot, indeed, part with the portraits, Madam; the one is a much valued friend long [s]ince dead, and the other---." A pale vermillion cro[s][s]ed her cheek, and [s]he he[s]itated. "Aye, that other!" [s]aid the Lady; "I never [s]aw any thing more like than that is to a particular friend of mine; and even the features of the Lady [s]eem familiar to me." "Will you buy the gold, Sir?" [s]aid Rebecca. "No," cried the Lady, "he [s]hall not buy it. If you will not part with it altogether to me for twice its value, (I am certain you will pardon the remark) but one motive could lead you to wi[s]h to di[s]po[s]e of the setting." As [s]he was [s]peaking [s]he had taken [s]everal guineas from her pur[s]e, and wrapped them in paper. "You [s]hall call upon me, if you plea[s]e, to-morrow morning," continued [s]he, pre[s]enting our heroine with a card, under which [s]he [s]lipped into her hand the paper of money, and without waiting for an an[s]wer, [s]he tripped out of the [s]hop. Rebecca was motionle[s]s; nor did [s]he think of looking at the card till the ma[s]ter of the [s]hop returned from [s]eeing the Lady to her carriage. "I am glad you were [s]o lucky," [s]aid he, "as to excite the notice of that Lady; [s]he is an amiable woman, and may prove a valuable friend." "Lady Chatterton," [s]aid Rebecca, reading the card. "Yes," continued he, "[s]he was Lady Eleanor Harcourt, only daughter of the late Earl. She has been married about three years. A mo[s]t extraordinary circumstance happened about that time; [s]he had been from a child de[s]igned for her cou[s]in, Sir George---." Ju[s]t then a carriage drew up, [s]everal Ladies of fa[s]hion [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] demanded the jeweller's attention, and Rebecca, thinking her mother might want her attendance, left the [s]hop, not without wi[s]hing [s]he could have heard what Sir George the Lady was de[s]igned for, as that was a name [s]he never heard mentioned, but [s]he felt intere[s]ted, and found it impo[s][s]ible to [s]uppre[s]s the emotions of her heart. Rebecca was truly grateful for the unexpected bounty [s]he had received, and returned home fully re[s]olved to wait on the benevolent Lady, and return her tho[s]e thanks her a[s]toni[s]hment had prevented her expre[s][s]ing at the time: But on the morrow her mother was [s]o very ill it was impo[s][s]ible to leave her, and for [s]everal succeeding days it rained continually: However, at length a fine morning pre[s]ented, Mrs. Serl was greatly recovered, and Rebecca, dre[s][s]ing her[s]elf as neatly as the very limited [s]tate of her wardrobe would allow, proceeded to St. Alban's-[s]treet. On knocking at the door [s]he was informed, that Lady Chatterton was gone out for a morning ride; but that, if [s]he was the young woman her Lady[s]hip had met at the jeweller's, [s]he was de[s]ired to wait till the Lady returned. Rebecca was plea[s]ed with this little mark of attention, and was [s]hewn into a [s]mall parlour, where a child, of about eleven years old was practi[s]ing on the pianoforte. The child [s]topped on her entrance, and, [s]tarting from her [s]eat, advanced a few [s]teps towards Rebecca. "Do not let me interrupt you Mi[s]s," [s]aid our heroine. "Oh! but I am [s]ure I cannot play, ma'am," [s]aid the child: "Indeed I cannot; I had much rather look at you. And pray ma'am, do not think me rude if I a[s]k you if your name is not Rebecca Littleton?" "That is my name," [s]aid the a[s]toni[s]hed Rebecca. "I knew, I was [s]ure, it could be no other," [s]aid the child, throwing her arms round our heroine's neck; "but you have forgot me---you do not remember your little Lucy O[s][s]iter." "Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] "Yes, your own little girl that loveed you [s]o dearly, and almo[s]t broke her poor heart when you went away: But you [s]hall not go away again, Rebecca; my dear aunt will not let you go: I know the will not." "What aunt, my dear young Lady?" "Why aunt Eleanor: I live with aunt Eleanor now. Papa and mamma are gone to France, and brothers are both at [s]chool; [s]o uncle George.---Oh! dear Rebecca, I have got [s]uch a deal to tell you about uncle George.--- I am [s]ure aunt will be very glad to [s]ee you, uncle and [s]he are gone out together." "Good heaven!" thought Rebecca, "then I am in the very hou[s]e I mo[s]t wi[s]hed to avoid. No wonder her Lady[s]hip [s]aid [s]he knew the picture; but now is my only time for avoiding a painful interview with Sir George, who has, no doubt, though it did not [s]trike me before, [s]ucceeded to his uncle's title on his marriage with his cou[s]in. Honour, gratitude, all unite to urge me immediately to quit this place. Lady Chatterton has extended toward me the hand of benevolence; nor will I repay her by throwing my[s]elf in the way of her hu[s]band, who, from his behaviour when we met accidentally, has convinced me he [s]till retains an improper regard for me." "As my Lady is not at home, my dear Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter," [s]aid [s]he, "I will call again another time." "Well, then, let it be [s]oon, my own Rebecca; [s]ay you will come again to-morrow." Rebecca tenderly embraced the affectionate child, and having given her a kind of half promi[s]e to [s]ee her [s]oon again, ha[s]tily left the hou[s]e. "Every thing," [s]aid [s]he, "con[s]pires again[s]t me. I never find a friend but [s]ome cro[s]s accident prevents my reaping any benefit from their kindne[s]s: misfortunes [s]eem to be the only portion allotted for me in this world, and patience and re[s]ignation my only comforters. But I will nor complain; I have been unexpectedly relieved when almo[s]t in de[s]pair, when every earthly friend had apparently for[s]aken me; and, I tru[s]t, I [s]hall be supported by the [s]ame beneficient Power, as long as he thinks proper to lay the burthen of life upon me." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] As [s]he walked along, indulging the[s]e reflections, it [s]truck her that [s]he would go to her uncle's agent, and enquire when he had heard from him, and whether the old gentleman was [s]oon expected in England. But when [s]he got to the place where he u[s]ed to re[s]ide, [s]he found he was removed to a di[s]tant part of the town; nor could the people, who then occupied the hou[s]e, give her a proper direction to find him. "Now every [s]tay is gone," [s]aid Rebecca, as [s]he pur[s]ued her way homeward; "but, I thank God, I feel my health returning, and, I [s]hall be enabled to gain, by indu[s]try at lea[s]t, the nece[s][s]aries of life for my mother and [s]elf." Alas! poor Rebecca, [s]he little knew how [s]mall a portion of the world's wealth fell to the [s]hare of the humble, the indu[s]trious female, who by continued labour can [s]carcely gain [s]ufficient to [s]upply, with the coar[s]e[s]t food, the wants of nature, or to [s]hield with decent clothing her limbs from the inclemency of the weather. While the daughters of vice and folly are [s]urrounded with luxuries, the [s]uperfluous part of which would cheer the hearts of the children of mi[s]ery; but, Oh! heavenly reflection, the humble, virtuous female, has a [s]weet cordial comforter within that diffu[s]es a plea[s]ure over her [s]oul, which the thoughtle[s]s votary of folly can never experience. Ble[s]t [s]pirit of content that pre[s]ides over the innocent brea[s]t! How enviable are thy tran[s]ports! Thou can[s]t [s]weeten the coar[s]e [s]canty meal of poverty, and [s]hed quiet [s]lumbers on the pri[s]oner's eye! The accute[s]t pang the heart can feel where thou ha[s]t taken up thine abode, is when it beholds its fallen [s]i[s]ters purcha[s]ing the delu[s]ive plea[s]ures of wealth with the lo[s]s of all that can render them lovely or amiable. Rebecca was poor, but her heart was void of discontent. She enquired for employment, and was [s]o happy as to procure [s]ome; but the fruits of her almo[s]t ince[s][s]ant indu[s]try were very inadequate to the wants of her[s]elf and mother, who revived but very [s]lowly from the bed of [s]ickne[s]s. WE GO BACK TO THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] When Sir George Worthy left England, in order, if po[s][s]ible, to bani[s]h from his remembrance Rebecca Littleton, he had, previous to his departure, vi[s]ited his cou[s]in Eleanor, and informed her of the [s]tate of his heart. "I e[s]teem you, Eleanor," [s]aid he; "but I do not love you as a man ought to love a woman he takes for his wife. To be candid, my heart is in the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of another." "And to be equally candid, dear George," replied the lady, "mine is exactly in the [s]ame predicament; yet I do not know how we [s]hall avoid making each other wretched, for my father po[s]itively [s]wears I [s]hall have you or be a beggar, and my poor [s]wain has neither name or fortune to recommend him." "I mean to be ab[s]ent two years," [s]aid Sir George, "that will give you a [s]hort reprieve. I will write to you often, and if at any time I can be of [s]ervice to the man of your choice, do not he[s]itate to command me." In the Earl of Chatterton's family was a young man nearly of the [s]ame age with Eleanor; he was a foundling, and had been brought up and educated by his lord[s]hip in the [s]tyle of a gentleman, and when at a proper age presented with a commi[s][s]ion. Oakly, which was the name the Earl had given him from having found him one morning at the foot of an oak in his park, wrapped in a mantle, but without any other cloathing. Oakly was a youth of [s]trict honour, and his heart overflowed with gratitude to his benefactor, whom he con[s]idered in the light of a father; but in[s]pite of honour, gratitude, and innumerable re[s]olutions to the contrary, he loved Lady Eleanor, [s]ome how or other accidentally acquainted her with his pa[s][s]ion, and found himself beloved in return. Things were in this [s]ituation when Sir George left [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] England, and in this [s]ituation remained when a letter from Eleanor [s]ummoned him to return, when he had been [s]carcely ab[s]ent eighteen months. The Earl was ill, felt him[s]elf daily declining, and wi[s]hed to [s]ee his daughter married before he died. He obeyed the [s]ummons in ha[s]te. Oakly was almo[s]t di[s]tracted. "But what am I," [s]aid he, "that I [s]hould a[s]pire to the hand of my patron's daughter, an out ca[s]t, a foundling, without family or name, dependant on his bounty even for the bread I eat? No, I will not impede her union with a man every way her equal, who po[s][s]e[s][s]es honour and goodne[s]s of heart, and will do ju[s]tice to her virtues. I will leave England," [s]aid he. Unable to deliberate on a [s]ubject where inclination and rea[s]on were [s]o much at variance, he flew to the Earl, and [s]olicited an exchange into a regiment de[s]tined to America. "Let me gather laurels in the field of battle, my dear Sir," [s]aid he. The Earl loved him tenderly. He pre[s][s]ed to know the cau[s]e of this unexpected application, and refu[s]ed to exert his intere[s]t in Oakly's behalf till he was informed. "I love a woman of family and fortune," [s]aid he, "I have [s]ome rea[s]on to think I am not indifferent to her, and, knowing my own unfortunate [s]ituation, I wi[s]h to avoid doing a di[s]honourable action." "You will never act di[s]honourable, Oakly," [s]aid the Earl, "and this conduct is a proof of it. Who is the Lady?---inform me ---I will [s]peak to her friends in your favour, and give you a genteel fortune." "Oh! my generous benefactor," cried Oakly, "indeed it is impo[s][s]ible; her parents never will con[s]ent. I dare not name her." "Come, come, you are too diffident: I am [s]ure there is no family, of the lea[s]t di[s]cernment, but would think them[s]elves honoured by the alliance. Come, who is the paragon?" "You mu[s]t pardon me, Sir; I [s]hould entirely forfeit your friend[s]hip." "You will undoubtedly forfeit it by this unkind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] reserve. I am willing and able to [s]erve you, Oakly; but if, by your ob[s]tinacy, you put it out of my power ---." "Do not call it ob[s]tinacy. By heavens! Oakly, I love you as my own child; only tell me how to make you happy, and I will do it, though it co[s]t half I am po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of." "Ah! my dear Sir, I fear, when you know ---." "Know what?" cried the Earl, impatiently. "That I love Lady Eleanor." "Love Eleanor!" cried he, emphatically; then your [s]uit is indeed hopele[s]s." Oakly's heart [s]unk within him. "You are indeed a noble boy, though," [s]aid the Earl, "and from this moment I hold my[s]elf bound, by the mo[s]t [s]acred oath, never to [s]uffer you to know the want of a friend. Eleanor has, from her childhood, been de[s]igned for her cou[s]in George; indeed, my late [s]i[s]ter and my[s]elf entered into a [s]olemn engagement, that which ever outlived the other [s]hould [s]ee this union completed; that now is my ta[s]k. If it is ab[s]olately necessary to your peace to leave England, I will procure you the de[s]ired exchange; but I could wi[s]h, my dear Oakly, you would conquer your pa[s][s]ion, and remain with us." "That is not in my power, Sir;" he replied, "to be employed in actual [s]ervice is now the only wi[s]h I have to make." The Earl did not mention this conver[s]ation to either his daughter or Sir George, and Oakly carefully avoided an interview with Eleanor till he was really appointed to a company of foot that was expected to go for New-York in the cour[s]e of a few weeks. He then, having made the nece[s][s]ary preparations for joining his regiment, took a tender leave of her, a[s][s]uring her it was his hope to en[s]ure her felicity by bani[s]hing from her fight a wretch who had [s]tepped between her and her duty, and who would rather die than have it [s]aid he had ba[s]ely stolen the daughter of the man to whom he owed every enjoyment, nay, almo[s]t life it[s]elf. "'Tis all in vain," [s]aid Eleanor, "I can never love [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] Sir George; nor do I think even the commands of a father I love and revere can lead me to give him my hand." However, the preparations for the intended nuptials [s]till proceeded. Sir George beheld them with total indifference. He had u[s]ed every endeavour to di[s]cover Rebecca: he had, by various [s]tratagems, traced her to her embarkation with Mi[s]s Abthorpe for America, and was informed the ve[s][s]el in which they went was reported to have been lo[s]t, and all on board peri[s]hed. "Rebecca lo[s]t!" He remembered his mother's fir[s]t wi[s]h to [s]ee Lady Eleanor his wife. "She is an amiable woman," [s]aid he, "and though I cannot love again with the emhu[s]ia[s]tic ardour I experienced for Rebecca, I will, if [s]he voluntarily accepts my hand, exert my[s]elf to make her happy. She, like my[s]elf, has experienced di[s]appointment in her tendere[s]t hopes; we can at lea[s]t con[s]ole each other, and make up in friend[s]hip what we want in love." Oakly had taken leave of his friends at Windfor, and was on his journey for Port[s]mouth. Sir George was in town with the lawyers, and the Earl and Lady Eleanor at breakfa[s]t in the library, when a [s]ervant informed them that a clergyman reque[s]ted to [s]peak with them.---He was de[s]ired to walk up. "I am come, my Lord," [s]aid he, [s]eating him[s]elf with evident embarra[s][s]ment, "from a poor woman in this place, who, it is imagined, is at the point of death. From [s]omething [s]he has imparted to me, I imagine it is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary for your Lord[s]hip to pay her a visit, as [s]he has a circum[s]tance to relate which nearly concerns your family. She is likewife in di[s]tre[s][s]ed circumstances, and may, while [s]he lives, which will not be long, require your benevolent a[s][s]i[s]tance." The Earl never wanted to be twice told of an object of compa[s][s]ion.--- "We will go directly," [s]aid he, and ringing the bell, ordered the carriage. Lady Eleanor and the clergyman accompanied him. At a [s]mall cottage, on the extremity of the fore[s]t, the carriage [s]topped, and the clergyman led the way into an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] inner apartment, where, on a bed, expre[s][s]ive of poverty in the extreme, lay a poor emaciated figure, in the la[s]t [s]tage of a con[s]umption. "Here is the Earl and his daughter, Mrs. Watts," [s]aid he. "They are very good," replied [s]he, "to come and [s]ee [s]uch a wretch as I am. Oh! Sir, Oh! my Lady, you will never forgive me; but I cannot die in peace till I have informed you that, through mine and my [s]i[s]ter's wickedne[s]s, you have nouri[s]hed an impo[s]tor in your families, and that the real heir to the late Sir George Worthy's e[s]ta e is either totally lo[s]t, or may be a poor wanderer, de[s]titute of bread." The Earl and Eleanor [s]at in mute a[s]toni[s]hment, gazing at each other.---The clergyman exhorted the penitent to proceed. "My elde[s]t [s]i[s]ter," [s]aid [s]he, "was employed by the late Lady Worthy to wet-nur[s]e her [s]on, and was left at Twickenham with the child, while her Lady[s]hip made a [s]hort tour to Flanders. During her Lady's ab[s]ence my [s]i[s]ter came to Wind[s]or to me, bringing ma[s]ter with her. I at that time gave [s]uck to a [s]weet little boy exactly of the [s]ame age, who[s]e mother had died at my hou[s]e but a month before. My [s]i[s]ter entreated me to take care of ma[s]ter Worthy for a day, while [s]he went to town. I con[s]ented, and was proud of my charge. In the afternoon (he was a[s]leep in the cradle) I left a little girl to rock him, and [s]tepped about half a mile to purcha[s]e [s]omething for [s]upper again[s]t my [s]i[s]ter came home. I made what ha[s]te I could, but on my return, what was my terror, to [s]ee the cradle empty, and my girl at play in the [s]treet? However, I did not make any noi[s]e, or alarm the neighbourhood; but enquiring of the girl who had been there, [s]he [s]aid only two gyp[s]ey women begging. It immediately occurred to me, that the gold bells and coral, together with the co[s]tly lace cap and jam the child had on, had been the incitement to this theft. When my [s]i[s]ter returned [s]he was almo[s]t di[s]tracted---her character would be gone---[s]he [s]hould never dare face her Lady again! That evening we could think of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] nothing in order to deprecate the [s]trom we [s]hould expect on my Lady's return, till the diabolical thought pre[s]ented it[s]elf of [s]ub[s]tituting my little nur[s]ling, who[s]e features and complexion were nearly the [s]ame, in the room of ma[s]ter Worthy, quieting our con[s]ciences with the ides, that, as his mother was dead, and his father poor, and talked of going abroad, it would be doing a deed of charity, and that, if we [s]hould ever find the lo[s]t in[s]ant, we might then acknowledge the fraud. Accordingly my [s]i[s]ter returned to Twickenham with the child, the plan [s]ucceeded beyond our expectations, for we feared the penetration of the [s]ervants, and I wrote to the father of the boy that his child was dead." "And who is it then," cried the enraged Earl, "whom you have thus infamou[s]ly palmed upon the family for the [s]on of my [s]i[s]ter, and who was within a few days to have been married to my daughter?" "His father's name was George Littleton," [s]he replied, faintly, "and he was chri[s]tened after him." "And have you never heard any thing of my poor cou[s]in?" [s]aid Eleanor, tenderly. "Never, Madam; but [s]hould he ever be found, he has on his right arm, ju[s]t below the [s]houlder, the mark of a mulberry." "Saddle my hor[s]es---[s]end off all my [s]ervants," [s]aid the Earl, [s]tarting up; "he [s]hall not go to that d---d fighting place." "My dear father!" cried Eleanor. "Rejoice, rejoice, my girl, for upon my [s]oul the young dog had that mark on his arm when I found him [s]prawling under the oak." "And is he alive, then?" [s]aid the poor woman. "Thank God---then I [s]hall die content." Eleanor [s]elt intere[s]ted in the [s]ate of the poor creature, who had made this important di[s]covery. She promi[s]ed to befriend her while [s]he lived, and to take care of her daughter, a girl about fifteen years old. She then returned home with her father, who immediately dispatched a me[s][s]enger to bring his new-[s]ound nephew to town again.---While Eleanor retired to her apartment to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] reflect on the alteration a few hours had made, and how much it had brightened her future pro[s]pects. George Littleton, as we mu[s]t now call him, however con[s]cious of his innocence, felt greatly hurt at being [s]o long the u[s]urper of another's name and property; but the Earl would not [s]uffer him to dwell on that [s]ubject, and on his marriage with Lady Eleanor. Sir George presented his quandom rival with the writings of an e[s]tate, worth five hundred pounds a year, given to him and his heirs for ever; and [s]o fond were they of his [s]ociety, that it was but a [s]mall part of every year he [s]pent from them. The Earl did not long [s]urvive his daughter's marriage, and Sir George [s]ucceeded to the title of Earl of Chatterton, the Earl having begged the rever[s]ion of it for him [s]ome time previous to his death. Mr. Littleton had given up all hopes of ever again hearing of Rebecca.---He imagined her dead, but her image was [s]o deeply engraven on his heart, that he resolved never to enter into the married [s]tate. Sometimes he would think [s]he might, perhaps, have been his [s]i[s]ter, for he had never heard her father's Chri[s]tian name, but his heart recoiled from this [s]ugge[s]tion She was undoubtedly a relation, yet he had never heard Rebecca mention an uncle, but [s]he might have many; he had never made many enquiries concerning her family. One evening, when he was at a [s]opper-party with Lord O[s][s]iter, that nobleman addre[s][s]ed him with, "George, I [s]aw an old acquaintance of your's la[s]t night. Ah, now I think of it, [s]he may be a relation." "Who do you mean my Lord?" "Who! why who but that demure, primitive piece of affected innocence, Mrs. Rebecca Littleton." "You mu[s]t be mi[s]taken, my Lord: I have every rea[s]on to think [s]he has been dead [s]ome years." "And I have [s]ub[s]tantial rea[s]ons to think [s]he was alive la[s]t night, and in my arms." He then gave an account of the affair at Lord Winterton's, little to the honour of hour heroine. He al[s]o averred, that [s]he voluntarily accompanied him in a chai[s]e to a neighbouring town, where [s]he [s]pent the night at an inn, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] but left it in the morning with a per[s]on whom he imagined [s]he liked better. "Poor girl," [s]aid George, mentally, "heavy mu[s]t have been the trials that drove her to a life of infamy." From that time he frequented every place where he [s]uppo[s]ed it likely to meet with her. "I will [s]natch her from perdition," [s]aid he. "She [s]hall [s]hare my little portion, eat of my bread, and drink of my cup. I will [s]peak con[s]olation to a mind that was once as pure as angels, and cannot without infinite pain, be intimate with vice." About this time Lord O[s][s]iter's extravagance had [s]o envolved his e[s]tates, that it was nece[s][s]ary he [s]hould make a trip to the Continent in order to retrieve them. George undertook to [s]ettle all his debts, and put the e[s]tates under proper regulations, and to this purpo[s]e took up his re[s]idence in Bedford-Square. He had been dining out, where the champaigne flew bri[s]kly round, when he accidentally met our heroine ju[s]t de[s]cended from the [s]tage. The wine gave him a great [s]low of [s]pirits, which, added to the relation he had heard from Lord O[s][s]iter, accounts for the rude manner in which he acco[s]ted her. The blow he received from the old [s]ailor almo[s]t stunned him: However, he followed him into the hou[s]e, and in[s]i[s]ted on [s]atisfaction for the in[s]ult, as he termed it. The old man [s]wore it was a blow given in a right cau[s]e, and that he was ready to give him a dozen more if he was not already [s]atisfied. During this altercation the coachman came in with Rebecca's trunk, and a[s]ked where the young woman was to pay him his fare? "She is ran off," [s]aid a man who [s]aw the tran[s]action. "Well then," [s]ays the coachman, "I mu[s]t keep the trunk for what [s]he owes." As he [s]poke he re[s]ted one end of it on a chair near a table, on which [s]tood a candle. The old [s]ailor looked at the directions, rubbed his eyes, and looked again. "By all that's good," [s]aid he, "it is my own girl, my Rebecca?---Which way did [s]he go? Let me follow her. Stand out of my way." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] "Not till you have paid me," [s]aid the coachman, [s]urlily. The old man threw down five [s]hillings, and de[s]iring a waiter to take care of the trunk, ran out, followed by George; but, in[s]tead of turning into Pall-Mall, they went through the Palace into the Park, their [s]earch was therefore vain. As they returned [s]lowly together, George a[s]ked the old man "if he was any relation to Mi[s]s Littleton?" "Yes," [s]aid he, "I am all the relation [s]he has in the world, and a devili[s]h poor one too, for I have not above half a guinea at this pre[s]ent time in my pocket. I have not been in London above two hours, nor in England above eight and forty." "Is your name Littleton, Sir?" "So my mother told me: I [s]uppo[s]e [s]he knew." "Pardon me if I am trouble[s]ome; but had you ever a [s]on?" "Yes, but he died an infant." "You were informed he died at Wind[s]or?" The old man an[s]wered in the affirmative. "Ah! my dear Sir," [s]aid George, "you were deceived--- your [s]on [s]till lives---longs eagerly to embrace you---and divide with you the competence he enjoys." By this time they had returned to the public-hou[s]e. George called for a room, knelt before his father, and related to him all the reader is already acquainted with. What wonder if, in the delightful hurry of [s]pirits this di[s]covery occa[s]ioned, they did not think of the nece[s][s]ity of writing a note for Rebecca, in ca[s]e [s]he came to enquire for her trunk; but, [s]atisfied with leaving a verbal me[s][s]age, they repaired to Bedford-[s]quare, to enjoy the plea[s]ures of an uninterrupted conver[s]ation. DISAPPOINTMENT. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] The next morning Rebecca, [s]o dear to both their hearts, recurred to their imaginations; George beheld her in want, plunged in infamy, the horrors of which her [s]u[s]ceptible heart [s]everely felt, and from which [s]he could by no means extricate her[s]elf. "She may be in want," [s]aid his father; "but I'll be d---d if [s]he is infamous. I know the dear girl, George, and I'd [s]take my life upon her innocence. He then gave his [s]on an account of the manner in which he found her in America, of the re[s]pect and e[s]teem [s]he created wherever [s]he was known, and how much [s]he was beloved by Colonel Abthorpe's family. But let us go to the hou[s]e where the coach [s]topped," continued he; "[s]he will mo[s]t likely call there to get her trunk." They went out together, and entered the hou[s]e ju[s]t ten minutes after Rebecca had left it. Di[s]appointed and grieved, unable by any means to trace which way [s]he had gone, and fearing [s]he would be di[s]tre[s][s]ed by the lo[s]s of her trunk, which might contain all her wordly po[s][s]e[s][s]ions, they returned heavily home, and re[s]olved to adverti[s]e it. This they immediately did in [s]everal papers, in [s]uch a manner as it was impo[s][s]ible for Rebecca not to know it was her[s]elf that was meant, though only the initials of the name were u[s]ed; but Rebecca never [s]aw the papers, and the repeated adverti[s]ements were fruitle[s]s. George had introduced his father to Lord and Lady Chatterton; but, thought Rebecca had been once or twice mentioned before that Lady, he had always avoided entering into explanations, and Lady Chatterton did not know that [s]he was the woman George had [s]o long loved; for though, in the earlier part of their intimacy, he had frequently declared that his heart was engaged, he had never [s]aid to whom, or whether [s]he was above or beneath him in rank; but [s]imply [s]aid, he had no hope of being united to her. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] On the day Lady Chatterton had met Rebecca at the jeweller's, [s]he mentioned the circum[s]tance at dinner time. George and his father that day dined with them. "I wanted to buy it of her," [s]aid [s]he, "for one of the pictures was [s]o like George Littleton, and the other was a Lady, but I do not recollect who, though I think, I have [s]een the features before." "Good heavens!" [s]aid George, "I am certain it could only be Rebecca her[s]elf." "I wi[s]h it may," [s]aid the Lady;---"but I did not think of it at the time I [s]aw her: however, I have appointed her to come here to-morrow." "How did the poor girl look?" [s]aid old Mr. Littleton. "Very pale," replied the Lady, "and, I fear, is much di[s]tre[s][s]ed by the agitation [s]he di[s]covered in her countenance, and her vi[s]ible reluctance to part with the picture." "Oh! my poor lo[s]t Rebecca," [s]aid George, and, rising ha[s]tily from table, left the room, to give vent to tho[s]e emotions he could no longer [s]uppre[s]s. Rebecca, in di[s]tre[s]s, offering, with evident reluctance the gold that enveloped his portrait to [s]ale, convinced him he [s]till retained a tender place in her remembrance; once to have been beloved by Rebecca would have been his highe[s]t wi[s]h---now [s]he was contaminated---lo[s]t to virtue! And, though [s]till inexpre[s][s]ibly dear to his heart, [s]he could never be his wife; yet [s]he might be innocent. Lord O[s][s]iter was not a man of the [s]tricte[s]t veracity. He would have given worlds for an interview with her, and unable to wait the i[s][s]ue of the morning, when [s]he was expected in St. Alban's-[s]treet, he obtained from Lady Chatterton a direction to the jeweller, and ha[s]tened to Cockspur-street, in hopes to be able through him to trace out her place of abode; but the jeweller had never [s]een her before, and had hardly thought of her [s]ince. He could give him no information. Tho[s]e only who have felt the pangs of [s]u[s]pence can imagine the anxiety of Mr. Littleton and George during the night. The next morning they repaired early to St. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] Alban's-[s]treet, but the day pa[s][s]ed and no Rebecca appeared. Another and another morning came, and [s]till brought with them di[s]appointment. "She will never come,"---[s]aid George.---"The poor girl is con[s]cious of her unhappy [s]ituation, and [s]hame prevents her taking advantage of Lady Chatterton's offers of [s]ervice. Mr. Littleton began to be of the [s]ame opinion; but the benevolent Lady Chatterton never went out without leaving orders with her porter, that, [s]hould Rebecca call, [s]he might be de[s]ired to wait till her return. "I will my[s]elf," [s]aid [s]he, "have the plea[s]ure of pre[s]enting her to her uncle. She [s]hall not be ha[s]tily informed that he is in England, left it [s]hould overpower her [s]pirits, and if I find her worthy, I will give her to her amiable cou[s]in, and make her a fortune worth his acceptance." But unfortunately Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter's joy, the effu[s]ions of which was mingled with incoherent intelligence concerning her uncle's, marriage, prevented poor Rebecca from reaping any benefit from her Lady[s]hip's kind intentions in her behalf. George Littleton had accompanied Lord and Lady Chatterton in their morning ride. They returned together. Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter came running to them as they entered the parlour. "Oh! dear aunt, who do you think has been here--- the greate[s]t [s]tranger! I do not think you know her; but I told her I was [s]ure you would be glad to [s]ee her." "Why, who was it, my love?" [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, [s]eating her[s]elf. "Why, it was my own Rebecca Littleton; I knew her in a minute, though [s]he is [s]o pale and thin." "And where is [s]he?" [s]aid George, almo[s]t choaked with ri[s]ing emotions! "She could not wait any longer," replied the child; "but [s]aid [s]he would call again to-morrow" "Was ever any thing [s]o unfortunate!" [s]aid Lady Chatterton. George bit his lips, took ha[s]ty [s]trides backward and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] forward in the room, frequently [s]truck his forehead with his hand, but [s]aid not a word. In the afternoon the following letter was brought to Lady Chatterton: " Madam , "Agreeable to your Lady[s]hip's benevolent de[s]ire, I this morning waited on you in St. Alban's-[s]treet, an honor which the extreme illne[s]s of my mother had prevented my enjoying [s]o early as I could have wi[s]hed. While I was, in compliance with your commands, waiting your Lady[s]hip's return from airing, I di[s]covered that Lord Chatterton and Sir George Worthy are one and the [s]ame per[s]on; it therefore [s]truck me that your Lady[s]hip, having [s]een his portrait in my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, might entertain but an indifferent opinion of my character: It might al[s]o occasion unea[s]ine[s]s between my Lord and you, and interrupt that felicity which I [s]ervently wi[s]h may be as permanent and la[s]ting as your lives. I thought it my duty, therefore, to explain to your Lady[s]hip the means by which this portrait came into my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion. "I once, Madam, lived in the family of the late Lady Mary Worthy, more as an highly favoured companion than a [s]ervant. Indeed [s]he was to me a generous friend, a dear and re[s]pected benefactre[s]s, whom living I loved with the affection of a daughter, and whom dead I can never cea[s]e to lament. "Some months after her death, I received her portrait as a pre[s]ent from Sir George, by the hands of Mrs. Harley, her Lady[s]hip's hou[s]e-keeper, but did not know it contained the re[s]emblance of Sir George him[s]elf till [s]ome time after it had been in my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion; nor have I [s]een him [s]ince, till about two months ago, when I accidentally met him in the [s]treet, and even then we [s]carcely [s]poke to each other. "Permit me, Madam, to return my thanks for the unexpected bounty you [s]o delicately be[s]towed upon me; to thank you al[s]o for that benevolence of heart which led you [s]o far to intere[s]t your[s]elf in my behalf, as to with again to [s]ee me; to have enjoyed your friendly protection would have been a cordial to my depre[s][s]ed [s]oul; to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] deserve it, the [s]tudy of my life: but, alas, Madam, an insurmountable ob[s]tacle is placed between me and [s]o enviable a di[s]tinction. Since I was [s]o happy as to meet you, a circum[s]tance has occurred, which will prevent my again having the plea[s]ure of waiting on you: But permit me to offer up the mo[s]t ardent prayers for the continued happiness of your[s]elf and Lord. May peace and love ever dwell in your bo[s]oms, and pro[s]perity crown your days. Permit me al[s]o to add, that however incon[s]i[s]tent my conduct may appear, my heart will everflow with the mo[s]t grateful affection towards your Lady[s]hip, while it beats in the brea[s]t of, Madam, Your obliged humble [s]ervant, REBECCA LITTLETON." P. S. I mu[s]t entreat your Lady[s]hip to inform my dear Mi[s]s O[s][s]iter, how much I was gratified by her affectionate remembrance of me, and that I [s]hall ever pray for her happine[s]s. "I can't comprehend all this," [s]aid Lady Chatterton, giving the letter into George Littleton's hand. He ran his eye ha[s]tily over the contents. "But I can," [s]aid he: "I conceive it all; the dear girl has never heard of the di[s]covery of the real Sir George Worthy. She imagines me to be your hu[s]band, and the genero[s]ity of her [s]oul will not [s]uffer her to throw her[s]elf in the way of a man who once pro[s]e[s][s]ed to love her, and whom, from the whole tenor of her conduct, I have reason to think [s]he loves." "I would lay my life [s]he is a good girl," [s]aid Lady Chatterton; "indeed her countenance appeared the index of a mind replete with innocence and purity. I will in[s]tantly order the carriage, and go to her; nor will I return without her." "Dear, generous Lady Chatterton," [s]aid George, ringing the bell. "Where is the per[s]on who brought this letter?" [s]aid the Lady. "It was brought by a porter, Madam, and he did not [s]top a moment." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] The joy that had for a moment animated the features of George in[s]tantly vani[s]hed. He again caught up the letter, but there was no addre[s]s annexed to it. Ju[s]t then his father entered, and they lamented together, that now they were more than ever convinced of the worth of Rebecca [s]he had effectually [s]ecluded her[s]elf from them. "Overwhelmed with poverty too," [s]aid George, and attendant on a [s]ick mother, who may, perhaps, be peri[s]hing for want, not only of medical a[s][s]i[s]tance, but of the comforts and nece[s][s]aries on which exi[s]tence depends." "We will u[s]e every endeavour though to di[s]cover her retreat," [s]aid Lady Chatterton, wiping away the tears that [s]tole from her expre[s][s]ive eyes, "and when we have found her we will cha[s]e [s]orrow from her heart, and unite our endeavours to make her forget [s]he had ever been unhappy." LADY CHATTERTON'S BIRTH-DAY. After every probable method had been taken by Mr. Littleton, George and Lady Chatterton, to di[s]cover our heroine's retreat, all proving equally ineffectual, they were obliged to re[s]t [s]atisfied that no exertion of theirs had been wanting; and tru[s]t to chance for a di[s]covery, which their united efforts had been unable to make. Old Mr. Littleton began to be tired of living on [s]hore, and applied for employment; but as he annexed to the reque[s]t the condition of being promoted in the service, he fonnd but little attention was paid to it, and he only received repeated promi[s]es, that when opportunity offered he [s]hould be remembered. He [s]pent great part of his time with the Chatterton family, and as the [s]ummer approached it was propo[s]ed, that both him[s]elf and George [s]hould accompany them to their country [s]eat. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] Lady Chatterton's birth-day was on the 7th of June, and [s]he made a point of always celebrating it before [s]he left town, her hu[s]band regularly pre[s]enting her with two hundred pounds to be expended on the occa[s]ion. Mr. Clayton, his Lord[s]hip's chaplain, being caterer extraordinary, always provided the entertainment, in which her Lady[s]hip was [s]o very [s]elfi[s]h, as to allow no one to partake but her hu[s]band, this identical chaplain, and her[s]elf. Mr. Clayton was always extremely bu[s]y for [s]ome weeks previous to the day, the whole cities of London, We[s]tmin[s]ter, and their environs, being ran[s]acked for delicacies to [s]uit her Lady[s]hip's ta[s]te; for on this day [s]he was a real voluptuary, though all the re[s]t of her life was marked by temperance and moderation: But to [s]peak without a metaphor, Lady Chatterton was a woman of [s]o unfa[s]hionable a turn, that, rather than rai[s]e the envy of half the town, by giving a [s]plendid ball, [s]he cho[s]e to expend the money her hu[s]band gave her in relieving indigence, and rai[s]ing depre[s][s]ed merit. "There [s]hall be [s]ome cau[s]e for rejoicing on my birth-day," [s]aid [s]he, "for I will cheer the afflicted [s]pirit, and fulfil the duties incumbent on my [s]tation; we were created to be of [s]ervice to each other, and we have no reason to rejoice in our creation but as we fulfil the de[s]ign of him who gave us being." Mr. Clayton, therefore, carefully [s]earched for objects proper to excite her Lady[s]hip's compa[s][s]ion, and [s]hare her benevolence. The happy [s]ea[s]on now drew near, and Clayton took his u[s]al walks round the metropolis, while, with a laudable curio[s]ity, he made little errands into chandlers-[s]hops, green-[s]talls, and public hou[s]es, in order to learn the circum[s]tances of the people in every poor neighbourhood through which he pa[s][s]ed. It happened, as he was purcha[s]ing [s]ome barly-[s]ugar at a [s]hop of the former de[s]cription, he [s]aw two [s]u[s]picious looking men a[s]cend the [s]tairs, and immediately after heard a bu[s]tle in the appartment over the [s]hop. Pre[s]ently the men came down, accompanied by a genteel looking man in deep mourning. He had the air and manner of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] a gentleman; but his uncombed hair, and pale, unshaven face, be[s]poke a mind ill at ea[s]e. "Well, they have nabb'd him at la[s]t," [s]aid the mistress of the [s]hop, as the young man and his ungenteel companions left the hou[s]e together.--- "Would you believe it, Sir, that young man, not [s]ix months ago, was one of the gaye[s]t bucks about town. I remember him fla[s]hing away like a Lord, and I was told he vi[s]ited Lords and gentlefolks of great fortune. Indeed, they did [s]ay, there was a Lady of quality in love with him, but that was not much to his credit or advantage, for [s]he was a married woman, and once he had liked to have got him[s]elf killed by her hu[s]band." "But if he was [s]o gay," [s]aid Clayton, "how came he [s]o reduced as he now appears?" "Why, Sir, you mu[s]t know I can give you good information, for I once lived [s]ervant in the family, though now, thank God, I can hold up my head without [s]ervice, or without being beholding to any body, and that is more than every one can [s]ay." "Well, but about the young gentleman," [s]aid Clayton, rather impatiently. "Yes, as I was [s]aying, he was a gay [s]park, and Mi[s]s, his [s]i[s]ter, a very fine Lady. His father was a merchant, and kept a large hou[s]e in the city, and lived away at a very high rate; coach, [s]ervants, every thing like a Lord: Well, behold you, he died about [s]ix months ago, and left not a farthing behind him, [s]o away went coach, fine hou[s]e, furniture, plate and all, to pay his debts, and Madam, Mi[s]s, and her brother, forced to humble them[s]elves, [s]o they came to lodge with me. The young man got a trifling place in [s]ome office, and that is all they have to live on, which, I believe, in my con[s]cience, is little enough, for they run fine long bills with me. Why, Sir, they owes me above three guineas now; but, [s]eeing as how other people are taken mea[s]ures to get their own, I [s]hall make bold to a[s]k for mine. Charity begins at home, is an old proverb, and a very good one; don't you think [s]o, Sir? If [s]o be Mr. Savage can't pay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] his taylor, mayhap, when the bill gets a little higher, he might not be able to pay me." "True," [s]aid Clayton, coldly; "but could you briug me to a fight of Mrs. Savage, or her daughter?" "Lord! not I; they are [s]o proud, that if a body offers to [s]peak or introduce a friend, they are upon [s]tilts directly." "Well, but pray [s]tep up with a civil me[s][s]age from me; [s]ay I wi[s]h to [s]peak with them on particular business." "And who mu[s]t I tell them you are, Sir?" "My name is of no con[s]equence; only [s]ay a clergyman." The woman executed the commi[s][s]ion, and, [s]oon returning, de[s]ired Mr. Clayton to walk up. On entering a [s]mall ill-furni[s]hed apartment, he beheld two charmingly prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ing women, the elde[s]t of whom did not appear to be more than forty years old, and the younge[s]t [s]eventeen; they were dre[s][s]ed in mourning, plain but extremely becoming, and had much the air of women of fa[s]hion. He apologized for the [s]eeming rudene[s]s of a [s]tranger intruding him[s]elf into their apartments uninvited, mentioned that he had [s]een the tran[s]action of the arre[s]t, and thought it might be in his power to alleviate, if not entirely remove, their di[s]tre[s][s]es. The mother's eyes overflowed at the mention of her [s]on's impri[s]onment. Her daughter took her hand, pressed it to her lips, gave her a con[s]olatory look; but the [s]tarting drops of [s]ympathy that trembled in her eyes forbade her utterance. "Lady Chatterton will dry tho[s]e tears," [s]aid Clayton, mentally, "or I am deceived in her character.--- What a pity [s]o much [s]weetne[s]s [s]hould droop under the heavy hand of affliction!" Clayton was a young man---Mi[s]s Savage a charming woman. He drew from them, in the mo[s]t delicate manner, an account of their various embarra[s][s]ments in pecuniary matters, [s]aid he had known the late Mr. Savage, and once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] received a great obligation at his hands, which he was happy in having now the power to return, reque[s]ted they would con[s]ider him as their banker; "for, my dear Mi[s]s," [s]aid he to the daughter, "I owed your father a con[s]iderable [s]um of money." He then pre[s]ented them with the whole contents of his pur[s]e, as he [s]aid, in part of payment, and departed, promi[s]ing to [s]ee them again in a few days. His a[s][s]ertions, in regard to having known Mr. Savage, were not [s]trictly true; but it was a pious fraud, by which he prevailed on the di[s]tre[s][s]ed ladies to accept pecuniary a[s][s]i[s]tance, and, he humbly tru[s]ted, the de[s]ign would [s]anctify the act. Two days from this was Lady Chatterton's birth-day. "Come, Clayton," [s]aid [s]he, when [s]he had read the memorandums over of that day's intended route , "we will pay the fir[s]t vi[s]it to your pretty Savage." Clayton introduced her to the Ladies as a per[s]on courting their friend[s]hip, and de[s]irous of [s]erving them. From them [s]he learned that young Savage, when arre[s]ted, having not the lea[s]t hope of liberation, had in[s]i[s]ted on being immediately conveyed to pri[s]on. "Then we will go and find a key to open tho[s]e tremendous doors," [s]aid Lady Chatterton, "and I think," glancing her eyes over her memorandums, "I have [s]ome other bu[s]ine[s]s to tran[s]act there. My dear Ladies, I will [s]oon [s]end this beloved [s]on and brother to you, on condition you all dine with me to-day at five o'clock." She pre[s]ented her card and departed, leaving the ladies oppre[s][s]ed with delightful [s]en[s]ations that could only be expre[s][s]ed by tears. Lady Chatterton proceeded to the pri[s]on, and was introduced to young Savage, whom [s]he immediately congratulated on his liberty, "your di[s]agreeable bu[s]ine[s]s is all [s]ettled, Sir, [s]aid [s]he, "and I beg you will ha[s]ten home to your expecting mother and [s]i[s]ter." Savage gazed with a[s]toni[s]hment at Lady Chatterton, for habited as [s]he was in a plain robe of white mu[s]lin, a bonnet and a cloack of the [s]ame materials, and led by the hand of the meek, benevolent looking Clayton, he knew not whether [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] to con[s]ider her as an inhabibant of this nether globe, or a a cele[s]tial [s]pirit. "If what you [s]ay, Madam," cried he, "be really true, and I have no rea[s]on to doubt it, for your countenance is benevolence it[s]elf. Pardon my [s]eeming ingratitude, but I could have wi[s]hed the affair had not been [s]o [s]peedily concluded." "Strange, indeed!" [s]aid her lady[s]hip: Do you not wi[s]h for liberty?" "Mo[s]t ardently, Madam; but there is in this habitation of mi[s]ery an object more de[s]erving your charitable notice, an object [s]o pitiable, [s]o very intere[s]ting to the feelings of humanity, that I could, with [s]atisfaction have [s]een the liberality extended in my behalf transferred to her." "Thank heaven!" [s]aid her Lady[s]hip, "neither the means of comforting the afflicted, nor the will to u[s]e tho[s]e means, are denied me; neither my heart or pur[s]e are limitted. Come, Sir, lead on to the place where I may dry the tear of [s]orrow, and gladden the pri[s]oner's ear by the welcome [s]ound of liberty." Savage led the way to a mi[s]erable room, where, on a tru[s]s of [s]traw, for neither bed nor chair appeared in the apartment, laid an old woman, almo[s]t worn to a skeleton, who[s]e haggard looks and laboured breathing, seemed to portend approaching di[s][s]olution!---On the [s]ame [s]traw, [s]upporting the aged invalid's head in her lap, [s]at the almo[s]t [s]hadowy figure of a young creature, habited in a white bead gown, her hair hanging negligently over her face and [s]houlders, one hand held the burning forehead of the apparently dying woman, the other hung motionle[s]s by her [s]ide. Be[s]ide them [s]tood a pitcher of water, and a [s]mall brown loaf. "Heaven pre[s]erve us," [s]aid lady Chatterton, ga[s]ping for breath, "what a [s]cene is here!" The old woman rai[s]ed her languid eyes at the [s]ound of the voice, but the young one remained in the [s]ame po[s]ture, nor [s]eemed to heed that any one approached. Lady Chatterton drew near, took her hand, and, in a voice [s]oft as the mu[s]ic of the [s]pheres, bid her be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] comsorted. "Come, cheer up, my poor girl," [s]aid [s]he, "I will do all I can to [s]erve you." She turned her head, looked earne[s]tly at Lady Chartterton, a [s]aint glow ru[s]hed over her pale features, and as quickly di[s]appeared as [s]he exclaimed:---"Oh! I know you; you are an angel of benevolence," and [s]ainted. She was immediately carried into the air, and on cutting the lace of her [s]tays, Lady Chatterton di[s]covered a [s]mall [s]hagreen ca[s]e, hung pendant from her neck by a riband. A [s]udden irre[s]i[s]table impul[s]e led her to open it, when the portraits of George Littleton and Lady Mary [s]truck her fight. She looked again on the young woman, who was now ju[s]t recovering, and in[s]tantly in her reanimated countenance, recognized the features of Rebecca. The debt, for which her mother had been thrown into pri[s]on, was fifteen pounds, which was contracted with the apothecary during her's and Rebecca's illne[s]s. Lady Chatterton [s]oon contrived to have it di[s]charged, and poor Mrs. Serl being tenderly informed of her liberation, was carefully placed in the carriage, her daughter on one [s]ide, and her deliverer on the other, who [s]upported her as the coach moved [s]lowly toward St. Alban's-Street; nor ever did conqueror, in his triumphal car, feel more exulting [s]en[s]ations than did her Lady[s]hip when [s]he led the grateful, trembling Rebecca into her own hou[s]e, [s]aw her mother laid in a comfortable bed, and heard from a phy[s]ician, that tender attention and peace of mind, would be more efficacious towards her re[s]toration than medicine. He al[s]o ordered Rebecca to be immediately put to bed, and take [s]ome wine and water, with a few drops of laudanum in it, as the agitation of her [s]pirits, and [s]uddenchange of fortune, had occasioned a wildne[s]s in her looks, and an incoherence in her di[s]cour[s]e, that rather alarmed him. Lady Chatterton [s]aw the pre[s]cription admini[s]tered, and then de[s]cended to meet her gue[s]ts in the dining parlour, while the exhau[s]ted Rebecca [s]unk into a more peaceful [s]lumber than [s]he had enjoyed for many months. AS IT SHOULD BE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] The party a[s][s]embled in the dining parlour were Lord and Lady Chatterton, the Savages, Mr. Clayton, George Littleton and his father. It was a tender, difficult ta[s]k to inform the[s]e affectionate relations that Rebecca was found, yet it was a ta[s]k her Lady[s]hip's generous heart burned to execute. Gently and by degrees [s]he made the intere[s]ting di[s]covery; but when George knew that his Rebecca was really in the hou[s]e, it was impo[s][s]ible to prevent his flying to the apartment that contained her; Mr. Littleton followed. They entered the chamber with cautious [s]tep. George [s]oftly drew a[s]ide the curtain. She was in a profound [s]leep. He [s]tood gazing with a look of joy, mingled with tender pity, on her altered countenance. Mr. Littleton [s]unk on a chair by the bed[s]ide. "Oh! my poor suffering girl," [s]aid he, "how thou art changed!" His head fell on the pillow be[s]ide her, and tears ru[s]hed down his venerable countenance. Rebecca moved, the nur[s]e forced George from her bed-[s]ide. She opened her eyes; the power of recollection [s]eemed for a while [s]u[s]pended. She looked wildly round her. "Where is my mother?" [s]aid [s]he: "I will not be taken from her. If [s]he mu[s]t die in pri[s]on, I will die with her." She rai[s]ed her[s]elf in bed, and [s]aw her uncle. "Rebecca!" [s]aid he, in an accent of tenderne[s]s, "have you forgot me, my dear Rebecca." "Oh! no, my beloved uncle," [s]aid [s]he, her head dropping on his [s]houlder. "Oh! no. How long have you been in England?" Then pau[s]ing a moment: "But what have they done with my mother?" "She is [s]afe, my love; endeavour to recollect yourself: do you not know [s]he came with you to this hou[s]e? She is in bed in the next room." Rebecca put her hand to her forehead: "I am [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] striving to think," [s]aid [s]he; "but I cannot remember where I am, how I came here."---By degrees the power of recollection returned, and every circum[s]tance recurred to her memory:---"I am in the hou[s]e of Lord Chatterton," [s]aid [s]he. "I could have preferred any other." "But [s]uppo[s]e, my dear girl, Lord Chatterton [s]hould not be the per[s]on you think him? Suppo[s]e he [s]hould be a man whom you have never [s]een?" Rebecca li[s]tened in [s]ilence, and her uncle, in the mo[s]t cautious manner, informed her of his having found a [s]on, and that [s]on was the man [s]he had imagined married to Lady Eleanor Harcourt. The relation was wonderful. Rebecca could [s]carcely credit it, yet, if it was really true, if [s]he was [s]till beloved by the man who[s]e image was engraven on her heart, and, indeed, relea[s]ed from the vow [s]he had [s]o [s]olemnly given her decea[s]ed benefactre[s]s, the rapidity with which the[s]e reflections ru[s]hed through her brain, the violent emotions of her heart, almo[s]t overpowered her weak frame. She breathed with difficulty, her eyes grew dim, the attendant perceived the change, and, giving her a few drops in [s]ome water, recalled her fleeting [s]pirits. "And where is this new cou[s]in of mine?" [s]aid [s]he, with a faint [s]mile, when [s]he was a little recovered: "methinks I [s]hould like to [s]ee him." George's heart palpitated violently. He drew near the bed, dropped on one knee, and cried, "Oh! my Rebecca, behold me here!" A [s]mile of ineffable plea[s]ure beamed over the countenance of Rebecca while [s]he extended her hand toward her lover. He took it, and pre[s][s]ed it to his lips. The en[s]uing [s]cene can be ea[s]ily imagined by the feeling heart, and to tho[s]e devoid of [s]en[s]ibility, the de[s]cription would be in[s]ipid, we therefore pa[s]s it over in [s]ilence. Peace being now re[s]tored to the bo[s]om of Rebecca, her health, her vivacity and bloom, rapidly returned, her mother too, recovered a [s]ufficient degree of health, to enable her to participate in her daughter's happine[s]s. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] An early day was named for the union of George and Rebecca, previous to which Lord Chatterton procured the old lieutenant to be [s]uperannuated, and a hand[s]ome pen[s]ion was given him in return for his long and faithful [s]ervices; a lucrative po[s]t was al[s]o procured for George, but he reque[s]ted leave to transfer it to young Savage. "Pardon me, my Lord," [s]aid he, "but that young gentleman has no means of [s]upporting his amiable mother and [s]i[s]ter. For my own part, though in the early part of life accu[s]tomed to all the indulgencies of an affluent fortune, I have been long convinced, that abundance of riches cannot [s]ecure happine[s]s. Po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of my Rebecca, who[s]e humble [s]pirit will enjoy mo[s]t felicity in the quiet, undi[s]turbed walks of life, beholding my father po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]ufficient to make his [s]etting [s]un [s]erene and unclouded, what can I de[s]ire more? We will retire into Berk[s]hire, to the e[s]tate you [s]o generou[s]ly settled on my family, and if we can once a year boa[s]t of the honour of a vi[s]it from you and your amiable Lady, I [s]hall be the happie[s]t mortal breathing." His Lordship was plea[s]ed with George's frankne[s]s, and the place was given to Savage, who was equally capable of discharging the duties incumbent upon him with honour and integrity. Lady Chatterton had, with her Lord's approbation, ordered a [s]ettlement to be made on Rebecca of two thou[s]and pounds, which [s]um his Lord[s]hip [s]upplied and placed in the funds for her own particular u[s]e. The day after the union took place, Rebecca, George, Mr. Littleton, and Mrs. Serl, took an affectionate leave of their generous friends in St. Alban'sstreet, and departed for Berk[s]hire.---The beauty of the [s]ituation, the neat cottage-like appearance of the hou[s]e, and beautiful [s]implicity of the furniture, afforded Rebecca the mo[s]t plea[s]urable [s]en[s]ations. She was [s]oon vi[s]ited by the neighbouring gentry, among whom, what was her [s]urpri[s]e to [s]ee, Lady Winterton, who[s]e [s]able habilments told [s]he was emancipated from that wor[s]t of [s]lavery, wedlock, with the man [s]he could not love. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] She informed our heroine that her health was [s]o impaired by vexation, and the effects of the wound [s]he had received, that her life was thought in imminent danger. Change of air was pre[s]cribed, and her Lord had brought her down to a [s]mall e[s]tate of his in Berkshire; that [s]he had found benefit from the change, but from the time of their leaving town, her Lord's health had declined; he had been [s]ubject to an a[s]thmatic complaint, which increa[s]ed upon him, and had terminated his life about two months before Rebecca's arrival in the country. Lady Winterton was too delicate in her pre[s]ent circumstances to mention the name of Savage. She had been imprudent, but never guilty. Sickne[s]s had moderated the extreme vivacity of her di[s]po[s]ition, and taught her to reflect. She could not avoid wi[s]hing to hear of him, or learn the rea[s]on why, from the fatal evening when they met at Chi[s]wick, he had never attempted to write to or [s]ee her. She was entirely ignorant of his fate from that time, yet [s]he kept tho[s]e wi[s]hes carefully concealed. Rebecca applauded her conduct, and de[s]ired her husband to mention, when next he wrote to Savage, that Lady Winterton was their neighbour, and that [s]he was a widow. The effect this letter produced may be ea[s]ily imagined. Savage flew into Berk[s]hire on the wings of love, and the fair widow promi[s]ed, in due time, to give him her hand. Lord and Lady O[s][s]iter continued on the Continent, where, immer[s]ed in vice and di[s][s]ipation, his Lord[s]hip fell a victim to intemperance, and her Lady[s]hip became notorious for her gallantry; forgetful of the [s]acred name of mother, [s]he gave the reins to folly, and publicly defied the laws of virtue and honour. Though Rebecca, from the variegated [s]cenes through which [s]he had pa[s][s]ed, had purcha[s]ed a thorough knowledge of the world, yet had it not hardened her heart, or rendered her callous to the calls of mi[s]ery, her prudence in her family concerns enabled her ever to have a mor[s]el for the hungry, and a garment to throw over the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf327&image=327-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] de[s]titute orphan. When the poor [s]aw her they ble[s][s]ed her---infant lips [s]et forth her prai[s]es---and aged knees bent for her before the Throne of Grace. She cheered the declining years of her mother and uncle. They called down ble[s][s]ings on her head. Her hu[s]band adored her. Her [s]ervants loved and reverenced her. Her bo[s]om was the [s]eat of unfeigned piety. The [s]mile of content dimpled on her cheek, and her dwelling was the man[s]ion of peace. FINIS. For PRINTING by SUBSCRIPTION, AN ORIGINAL NOVEL, IN FOUR VOLUMES DUODECIMO.
