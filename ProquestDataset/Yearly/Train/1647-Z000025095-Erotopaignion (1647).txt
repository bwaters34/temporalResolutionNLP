 James Howell Esquire, Nestors Long aevity and both worlds Felicity. Honored Sir, the Articulate, and intelligible susurrations of your ever verdant vegitals, (to which former ages have nothing (in that kind) to assimulate, neither shall future times be able to parallel,) from these Apollinean Plants of yours, I have slifted here a twig, and there a sprig, and I have bestowed some time in binding them in a bundle, which with my selfe I humbly offer to your approved censure, it being the Apex of my ambition to have your honour'd selfe my justice in Eyre, I cannot say with Persius Nec scombros metuent mea carmina, nec thus for this confused trusse of twiggs (as I may say) though made of greene wood, yet is it far from meriting any longaevity, it deserves rather to kindle a sacrifice for Julian , yet your name being out in the rind, these twiggs may chance vegitate and flourish. And know I not that you can as well indulge, as censure my green Muse which hath scarce yet displayed her vernall blosomes, durst not from such a Nadir of minoritie elevate her flaggie pinion to the Zeneth of your perfection. Sir, when your rare parts of vertue induced me to kisse your hands, and make severall addresses to you, that my eye as well as my eare might be witnes of such magnified merits, you were pleased out of your high civilities to give me a favourable reception, and since to overvalue me so far, as to honour divers of my bold Epistles with noble answers, wherein sweetnes of love, & soundnes of learning seemed to contend for mastery. Now sir, being advised by the French Adage ( If vaul mieux se monstrer sans esperit, que d'entrer en la voyed 'ngratitude ) its better to play the foole, then be ungratefull, I am bold to present you with the first mayden fruits of my Muse as a gratefull recognition of your favours, which I shall still endeavour to implore, & make my selfe capable of a further addition, in which firme resolution, I entitle my selfe Sir Your most devoted, and most humble servitor. From my Chamber at Grayes Inne . 1 Aprill 1647. Bright ornaments of the British nation, ofspring had been but a tympany or some false conception, till finding it to retaine daily encrease, and degrees of growth, I was assertain'd it was a reall Embrion, and that it would at last retaine some shape, though never so homely. This spring was the Lucina , or midwife which brought it forth, and handed it out of the soft wombe of a greene braine, it now implores each of you to be its Eupheme or nurse, in the absence of that true and affectionate honourer of your amiable sex, his unworthy genitor, who by that time, that it bee in case to kisse your faire hands, will be traversing the world abroad. The literature and divination of the Sybills, Cassandra , and Eurycles , the chastity of Pero, Teuca , and Lucretia , the singular constancy of Penelope, Pillacides , and Iphias , the magnanimity of Penthisilia, Thelesis and Zenobia , the beauty of Helena, Ariadne , and Phyllis , with other innumerable eminent endouments which bounteous nature hath liberally in all ages reposited in your lovely sex, as in the Apothecke or magasine of perfection, makes this my Gynophilian or amorous infant long rather to be dandled upon your tender knees, then lie reclused in a dustie study. If you please to bestow part of that time which you spend in other divertisments to converse with this poore brat of my braine, it will paint out unto you though with a quavering pencell, and in course and caligenous colours the passions of your royall Amorists, with inducements to commiserate them, the event whereof (which may make them operative in this kind) will perhaps make you repent no more of reading them, then I of composing them. When you talke with your children you expect from them no congruence or quaint language, yet you are often pleased to heare them prattle, & are delighted with their lisping Ideoms. This makes me hope that you will dispence with the Lallation & Low dialect of this babe, whose tone is rude, yet his meaning is plaine dealing, which according to the proverbe is a jewell, and consequently most fit for Ladies. Thus wishing you all delights, & happinesse, endlesse like the rings you weare, & that the period of my paines may be the beginning of your pleasure, I remaine Your Ladyshyps in all observance Sure 'tis Arts Arcademy, and the Muses Mint: Where in Dame Nature Pupill is to Art; Bearing Minerva's Image in each part: The Court of Pallas and the Muses Throne; Where Ignoramus stands outlaw'd alone.

Hither may ancients come, and grieve to see Their learning all Epitomiz'd in thee. Thy language is of proper words and phrase, What it affects it easily brings to passe, Were chast Penelope surviving now, Her stubborne heart it would make soone to bow. Cupid directs thy heart, thy pen Apollo , Or else such lofty straines thou couldst not swallow. Had'st thou not been in love, sure thou coul'st ne're Have writ such sublime raptures as are here.

I hold the opinion of Pithagoras , This Muse cannot be lesse then Ovids was, Onely it suffered a transmigration Into a body of a newer fashion.

Wherefore farwell, goe on as th'ast begun To make thy name more glorious then the sun. Thus wishing the each man a happy guest Unto thy booke I take my leave and rest. Tui amicissimus Joh.

Me thinkes I saw upon the bifork't mount Ray-circuled Apollo set, and count His bay brow'd Sonnes I saw Jove's daughter too Minerva , in her right hand leading you, In'r left she held thy booke, she bow'd and broake, Her long continued silence, and thus spoke, "See Phaebus , here a new star risen be I'th Galaxia of sweet poesie, No Plbeian Poetaster, he is one That is the A'tlas of thy Lyrick throne, You'ue seene his face, take here his booke and finde Portraitur'd by his owne rare pen, his minde." He took't and red thy flowrie pastorall, Thy courtly masque, verse, prose, applauded all, He stood amaz'd (to say true) and did muse That one so young such fine things should produce. At last he tooke a Daphnian wreath and laid It on thy ever honour'd head and said, "Welcome deare sonne still may the Delphick lyre Be struck by thee, sonne welcome to our quire. thy Life beyound thy Life from shall extend, Fates have not power to make thy end, thy end. Thou shalt out-live thy selfe, and not be dead When dead this wreath shall bud about thy head, These strenuous lines, these smooth poetick layes Shall crowne thy Urne with ever-verdant bayes." This done, I wak't, and proud am growne to be A SMITH to Hammer out thy dignity. Is not growne feeble, it hath brought forth thee, Our ages ornament, t' ath brought forth thee, VVho art a Nestor in thy infancie.

Flaminius beholding her in this heart-attracting posture, he forthwith placed so in her all his future hopes of joy, and joyfull parts of his heart, as he left remaining in himselfe nothing but a maze of longing desire, in seeing he liked, in liking he loved, in loving he felt the effects incident to love; the torments which he sustained in her presence, the griefs which he indured in her absence, the pining thoughts in the day, the pinching dreames in the night, the dying life, the living death: his feare of losing her, his despaire of gaining her, shall be the subject of the subsequent History. But first let us glance upon him in his minority, discourse a while upon the course of his fortunes, before he was reputed a man, and insert his Legend. He was by birth an Italian, borne in the delicate and luxurious City of Naples , first the receptacle of Philosophy, now of Souldiery, Erected by sweet Siren , said to be By Phaleris built, stil'd once Parthenope ; Rich hort-yard of the dove-drawn Queen of Love, New field of th' Hydra slaying son of Jove . Fat soyle of liberall Ceres , crown'd with corne, Rare vineyard of the wine-wet god unshorne. Boast not because no Citie's like to thine, For sweetnesse, Empire, beauty, strength, corn, wine, Boast not thy rarities, thy bubling Fount, Labulla call'd, nor yet thy bifork't Mount Vesuvius , whence Sol's Steeds (with mains be curl'd) That circumdates in twice twelve hours the world, Doe first begin their race, as if it were Their master Phoebus private Bed-chamber. Brag not of thy obscure Chimerian dale, Ne're seen by Sol , nor by his Sister pale. Nor cause thou giv'st a grave to him whose verse, The conquests of victorious Kings reherse, Brag neither of the pleasant water'd Lake, Aquano term'd, so fatall to the Snake. Nor of Authentick Sibills domicil, Whose past predictions bald time fulfill. Insult not Parthenope because you have Lacus Avernus , and black Charons cave, And sootie Vulcans fier-spitting Court, Wherin he tempers armes to make Mars Sport. 'Tis this Parthenope , tis this that raise Especiall Trophies to thy lasting praise; Flaminius , whom fame affirmes to be Made in dame Natures prodigality; Flaminius , whose name live till times glasse run, For earths last dark Eclipse of no more Sun, Was borne in thee, at whose Nativity, A generall Turnament was held i'th Skie, The Stars did run a tilt, and Ph aebus bright, Danc't a Coranto with the Queen of night. The Rocks did Eccho forth his name, and none, Of their dull clifts, but did repeat that tone. Orpheus did string his harpe with nimble hand, To sound his praise,--- Silvanus did command Mirtles to dance, the pines their roots forgoe, The Holmes and branching Elmes did caper too, Sweet firre-trees friskt, and sublime Cedars ran. Joves tall Oake fed by gumms Assyrian, Joyn'd in a Galliard with that lofty tree, Whose courtly boughs the meed of valour be. And odor-breathing Zephyr this news bore On's way, unto a grove of Sycomore, Whilst there he told it in a flowrie gale Tres bow'd their tops, as thankfull for his tale. Each flowing streame in gentle murmuring tones, Whisperd these tidings to the pebble stones. Nor was Amphions sphear enchanting Lute, (Whose sound erected Theban structures) mute. Pan on his reed, on his pipe Mercurie , Carrold in Sonnets their festivity. With beamie eyes, and bright disheveld hairs, The Nymphs tript ore the Lawns,---thus chim'd the Sphears Naples rejoyce, a Prince is borne in thee Whose fame shall burgeon to Eternity. He had for his father Pompilius , a man of an affable nature, in warre as expert, as valiant, in peace as provident, as prudent, alwaies resolute to undertake, and ever fortunate to execute any designe conducing to the emolument of the weale-publique, which he was industrious to advance, both in buffe, and fur, by armes and art. He tooke to wife Capricia a Lady of an exquisite feature, and of so ripe a wit that the fragrancy of those redolent flowres of female eloquence which blossomed in all her discourses, turned all tongues into attentive eares whilst she was speaking. If she did deambulate, besides the making divers places happy by her steps, the very moving did adde an amiable life to her innate perfections. If she did set still, the conspiracie of her severall attractive graces combined together, to present one perfect figure of incomparable beauty to the ravished beholders. From this happy couple proceeded this miracle of art and nature Flaminius , in whom nature seemed to have planted the paradice of her perfection He was well stored with civill vertues for peace, and martiall valour for warre; passion was not exiled from him, but suppressed in him; and so subjected to right reason, as he was idoneous for prosperitie or adversitie: whereof the one did not make him insolent, nor the other dejected. He was one of the silken wits of his age, by nature a Phylomathy, so addicted to erudition and literature, that he used his cradle like a Library, making Bookes his nugaments. Apollo did so cooperate in his production as he lisp't meeter, and his first notes were Castalian layes, as if he had been borne in Tempe , or Pernassus , or had the sphear-borne harmonious sisters for his nurses. There was no vertue but he did depute it either fit for ornament, or use, no vice but he did condemne and contemn it as sordid. His exercises and refocillations from his infancy, and very nonage, were ingenious, manly, decent, and such as tended still to wit, valour, and activitie, which he used ad ruborem, non ad sudorem , his games did not make him pale with feare of loosing, nor hot with desire of gaining. He was a fit soyle for praise to dwell upon, and were it not as superfluous, as it is tedious, we might protract this tract, or register of his vertues in infinitum . But as Nicomachus left Tindarides unperfected, as Timomachus broke of Medea scarce halfe coloured, or as Appelles left Uenus her picture unfinished: so must we the definition of this exact modell of humane perfection unconsummated. Yet as that learned Geometrician who finding the length of Hercules foot upon the hill Olympus drew forth the portraiture of his large limb'd body therby: so may we guesse at Flaminius his Cardinal vertues, that have this superficiall demonstration of him. This Favourite of fortune, and Minion of the muses, after he had continued three long lusters of yeers, and some winters more, sub regimine matris , under his mothers tutele, he was admitted into the Illustrious Academy at Padua , that cristall spring of knowledge, that Nursery of wit. Here club-fisted Logick with all her Quiddities , and Qu ae, Ca, vel Hipps , nor Scotus with his h aeccities was able to dastardize or cow his spirits, but he made her who first appeard like a Gorgons head, to prove a meer Bugbeare. The tough Mathematicks, nor any other Academicall Sciences were able with their crabbednesse and intricacy to deterre him, but he waded through the middest of them, and arrived at an excellent perfection. He made facetious Poetry his banquetting stuffe, but utible Philosophy his solid and substantiall food, which he digested so well as in the strength of it he was able to fathom the glassy deep, measure huge bellied mountaines, and reach the twinckling Stars with a Jacobs Staffe. He feared not to hurt his tender hands with thornie schoole questions: about which he would daily dispute nor could the plotting pate of any nice opponent weave such an obscure Gordian knot, but he could easily untie it, as if he had had a window into its Authors brain, and beheld its subtle fouldings, so that learning (which is in a Prince like a glittering Diamond in gold) concur'd with Nobility to make him more resplendant. But to make up a Triumvirate to sound his praise, let us (adde as a Colleague in joynt Commission) to learning and nobilitie, experience which he thus obtained. He was prompted by his owne generous genius that peregrination, and forraigne travell, was a Lyceum , a profitable peripatetick School, then which nothing contributed more to the building up, and perfecting of a man, and he was doctrinated by his Tutors that there was no better meanes to fashion, and regulate a mans life by, then by proposing to him the diversitie of so many other mens lives. This advice he conceived conducing as well to his emolument, as amenity; wherefore in a splendid equipage, royally attended, by a loyall troop of domesticks, he made a journey over the Alpes, those uncouth excressences, those wens of Nature, into faire France , a Region wherein the hand of Art hath joyned with Nature to make it super-eminent. Here he resided in the Metropolitan City Paris , till Cynthia had 6. times repaired her wained hornes; then Paris the durty Theater of all Nations, being plagued with an almost generall infection, or invalitude, Flaminius with his cousin German, the Duke of Luynes , (the powerfull Favourite of the crown of France ,) retired to his Tusculanium at Poysey , a prety gentle place, scituated upon the River Sequana , some 15. miles distant from Paris , at the foot of the great Forrest of St. German ; wherein these two mighty Princes sent many dayes to follow their flying predecessors, whilst they followed the sharp tusked Bores, crafty Foxes, and timerous Hares, with all which kinds of Beasts, kind Nature (aspiring to recreate her darling Flaminius ) had plentifully stored that spacious Forrest. But to turne to our taske, the French King at this time had his residence at his standing house within a mile of Possy , whither this favourite the Duke of Luynes was summoned, so that Flaminius was for a time deprived of his society, which he made not only necessitudo , but necessitas , almost essentiall to his subsistance: in whose absence Saturne that leaden planet did cast his melancholy influence overall his intellectuals, yet he being willing to dissipate those black foggs of disconsolate pensivenesse, he rode attended by two of his Domesticks, Florian and Doristo , into the Forrest, where he suddenly heard such a plangerous and lamentable cry; as he was well assured it was the dolefull note of some object of pitty, wherfore making his eares his guide, he left not many trees behind him, before he discovered mounted upon a black Palfrey a Damsell of exquisite formosity, urged with sorrow making towards him: her light moulded Horse though quickned and vivified with the whip, equalled not the celerity of her timerous mind, she had her sad Oration inscribed in pale characters upon her tristfull countenance, her eyes were distained, and cheeks bedewed and irrigated with watering tears: the thwarting boughs of the spreading trees did loose her tresses, and spred her hair on her shoulders after the Funerall manner. Being come within his ken, she implored his aid in the rescuing of her Lady out of the hands of an injurious usurper, and this boon shee beg'd with as much vehemency of passion, as if her panting heart would have climed into her mouth, to take her trembling tongues office. Flaminius whose heart was the Throne of tender pitty, as well as of truculent prowesse, undertooke the quarrell, and followed the Damsell, who conducted him to that place were the Ladies Servants (which the strange Knight and his Complices had vanquished, and almost unliv'd) lay (besmeard in their congealed blood) calling upon Charon (with dying groanes) to afford them a speedy passage. Flaminius conceived it more necessary to resume the captiv'd Lady, then condole the conquered Servants, wherefore he left them and out- stript the slower winde in pursuit of that Knight, whom he at last saw leading away the unwilling Lady, for whose sake he saluted him with this challenge. It sufficeth not that thou hast subdued yonder Petitoes of Mars , and captived their Lady, fortune will not sell her at so under a rate, it remaineth that you vanquish me also before you injoy her, the wager of our contention, whose mercy i'le constraine you to abide, and in whose defence my sword (blushing at thy impieties) shall strike thy soule to Erebus , and compell thee to garter thy hose with thy gutts. The strange Knight coyned this proud reply to this unexpected defie; I conceive it no hard taske to chastise thy insolency, for I take thee for no other then a body animated by a Pythagorean Transmigration, with one of those cowardly soules which I even now sent to seeke new Lodgings. With that he turned his Horse to take his career, expecting nothing but the fall of Flaminius , but he fell short of his expectation, at the first encounter being sent to fetch an errand in the dust, but remounting his bit- champing coursier, they charged each other with much agility; so thick, as if every blow had striven to have been foremost, but the strange Knights Horse carvetting, received upon his head a forcible blow intended for his Master, the anguish whereof made him cast his burthen, to accompany his blood (which too too prodigally streamed out at his deep wounds) to the all receiving earth. Then Flaminius contemning advantages over an almost vanquished Antagonist, lighted also, and now these Champions entertained one another with fresh courage, till Flaminius let fall such a fortunate blow upon the unfortunate strange Knight, as parted his ill-tempered shield, and despising the weake and inconsiderable oppugnation of his already broken armour, it made a great breach into his heart-side, as if it would cut a passage for his unlawfull love to issue out at, and sent his whole body to strike the earth, falling, since he could offend his Antagonist no better, standing. Flaminius (after he perceived his pale enemie had acted his lives Epilogue) accompanied the Lady to her Castle, which stood in the same Forrest, and in the journey he desired her to beguile the times hast, and abbreviate the waies length with the relation of her precedent fortunes. To this request of his the Lady shaped this Reply. Royall Sir, your commandment doth not only give me will, but power to obey you, such influence hath your excellencie. I will lay the foundation of this subsequent sermocination with any one name, which is Iulia , eldest daughter to signior le Aroine , and his wife Isabella , who both during the time of my minoritie, (having performed the message for which they were sent into the world) returned againe to their Maker. First, my indulgent Father being too old to live, his decayed nature was conquered by triumphant death, and uselesse Physicke did yeeld to his manifold diseases, then my widdowed Genetrix striving to survive without him, and liking not, expir'd also. After this, I with my Orphan Sister Andronica , retir'd to our Castle, (towards which we now equitate) where we reape as much delectation in the rurall solentary groves and hewts of our owne, as the rest of the French Ladies doe in the populous streets of stately Paris , she that hath no looking-glasse to dresse her head by, will use a boule of water, she that wanteth a sleeke-stone to repumicate her linnen, will take a pibble. The Countrey-girle girdeth her selfe as strait in the waste with a course caddis, as the Madame of the Court with a silke riband; and we were as well content in our Rustick immorigerous roomes, as others in the magnificent structures of our Royall Soveraigne. But to proceed, there arrived at my Castle Phylispis a valiant and heroicall Knight, one out of the number of those, whom renowned Fame will ever celebrate: his errand was to prostrate his love-sicke-heart at my feet, in the highest degree of lowest duty; and the purity of the verity is, he had taken a full possession of the Fort, before he did aske for the keyes; the match was concluded, and agreed on before the capitulations were treated on; my ravished eyes did no sooner behold him, then my amorous heart did fancie him; (for he resembled Abdalmuralis , the grandfather of Mahumet , who was so amiable, that women were enamoured of him;) yet my modest tongue did a long time hold him in wavering suspence, neither suffering his feare to fall into despaire, nor his hope to hasten to assurance; though once to prove the reality of his unalterable affection, I charged him with whole vollyes of flatte denialls; though any man that had beene trained up in Cupids discipline, might easily perceive, I shot nothing but powder, to try his animosity, not bullets, to batter downe his breast-workes of hope already reared. To these hee framed this satisfactory reply, Madame , the poore Fisherman that was warned hee should not fish, would notwithstanding at his door make nets. And the old Vintner of Venice that was prohibited from selling Wine, did stil hang out an inviting Ivie-bush; and so will I die in faith to you, if I may not live in favour of you: My malevolent and inauspicious starres may impeach my injoyment of you, but if they should implore the assistance of Erynnis , and call into their ayd the three Acheronticall Haggs, Alecto, Megera , and Tysophone , they should never force me from your love, which is radicated so profoundly in my heart, that hee which plucks it out, pulls up at once that, and my soule together. Your gifts inspir'd by bounteous nature, and your vertues acquir'd by liberall education, have stampt for you such an indelible impression of love  & affection in my estimation, as no distance of place, length of time, or traverse of chance, shall be able to race out, or impaire, till death and sad despaire, make a sponge of my bleeding heart to wipe it out. For all this, I still made his condition like a taper almost burnt out, sometimes all obscured in blacke darke dispaire, and now and then a flash or two, an Ignis fatuus of comfort; but of so short continuance, 'twas as soon extinguished, as perceived, till at length, my kinder heart being willing to yeeld, I was content not to perswade it to hold out any longer, against the sweet blowes of love, but I promised him marriage, which is shortly to be consummated. Soone after him came this knight, who is by your valour, Ad Charontem sine naulo missus , and he also pretended a desire to match my matchlesse beauty, with matchlesse affection, him I denyed as fervently, as I did the other faintly. And now this Tripolis (for so he was nominated, whom you have vanquished) did attempt to atchive that ( Tarquin -like) by force of armes, which he could not effect by perswasion and argument, this made him devise all meanes, and waite for all occasions to surprise me. It fortuned, though late, yet at last, there was a match concluded on between Arcates , sonne and heire to the ancient Duke of Orleans , and Claritia my Mothers sisters daughter; to solemnization of these nuptialls, I with my damsels tooke our way, and now earths black babling daughter spred the pinions of swift wings, advanced her shrill trumpet, and fill'd the inquiring eares of Tripolis , with the relation of our journey; of which being certified, he diligently awaited for my returne, and had assuredly made me his captive, had not you been my rescuer; to whom I am indebted for my liberty (the joy of life) which I hold now the second time of you. Thus sir have you bound me to you in an energeticall chaine of gratitude. To attempt a requitall, would extreamely extenuate your transcendent courtesie, and derogate from the worth of your high favour: but for the other office of gratitude, retention, if you had a window into my memory, you might espie there safely stored up, and conservated, to preserve it from mouldring away in oblivion. By this time the setting Sunne with loose rayes was posting to his Westerne home, waiting onely to light Flaminius and Julia to the Castle, which was a place as strongly fortified, as rarely edified; it was erected of speckled free stone, adorned with marble shining pillars, and statues of the predecessors of Signior le Artine , it was invironed with large walks both greene and gravelly, with spreading trees on either side, bowred on the top, so that in Summer time the scorching Sunne could not offend any with intemperate heat, there were such delicate shaddowes, and in the Winter, the chilly and sharpe windes found no passe; the trees were so high and thick; round about these ran silver streames, whose sweet murmur, as they gently tumbled over their beds of pebble stone, did much adorne the pleasant solitarinesse of the place. Opposite to the front of this strong structure was a large parke, which for cheerefull risings of the ground, for groves, and rowsings for the Deere, and for chrystall Rivolets of cleere water might compare with any. In the Hall, cost and invention strove for mastery, so many Stories did so successively succeed one another, that the most curious spectators eye, (though his admiration might dwell in each peece) could find no cause of stay, untill hee had overlook'd them all; here he did recreate his active fancy, with this varietie of pleasing objects. Here might he perceive the ruddy bloud drawne out of Daphne's tender leggs, by the enjurious thornes, as she over-hastily fled from persuing Ph aebus , and her dishevell'd haire seemed to play with the warme breath of her following lover. There might he behold sorowfull Venus bemoaning the violent death of her boreslaine minion Adonis , and striving to wash away the clottered blood from his worried carkesse with her pearly teares, which dropt from her tender eyes like a continued chaine of pearle, gushing forth in such abundance, as if her rubie blood had changed its naturall course and colour, to run forth at the wide open sluces of her eyes. She kist his pale lipps, as if she would willingly have melted her sad heart to have restored them to fresh colour, and breath into him another soule fit for her love. Here might he espie Leander beating the swelling Helispontick waves with his weary limbs, swimming to his expecting Hero , whose painted torches seemed to burne as bright as those reall torches which by this time had inherited the set-Suns office. There might hee discrie the rude mouthes of Acteons dogs fill'd with white foame, greedy to dismember their brutified master, and delacerate his limbes instead of the innocent beast he persued. There griefe in the stead of gaine, paine in the roome of pleasure, seemed to bath its selfe in his sorrowfull eyes. By this time our Spectators appetites began to solicite them in behalfe of their stomacks, the colerick lookes knockt, the trumpets sounded to supper, and when the tables were with-drawne, the Ladyes servants for the better entertainment of Flaminius (being ambitious to exhibite all their forces to performe any thing that might conduce to his contentment) presented him with this pastorall. OR THE PASSIONATE LOVERS. A Pastorall Acted by the Lady Iulias Servants, for the entertainment of  Amor omnia vincit.   Fit Cygnus, Taurus, Satyrus, fit Jupiter aurum, Ob Ladam, Europen, Antiopen, Danaen.  Gripus, Hegio . Two Lovers. --- Venus. Cupid. Mira. Daris . Two young Shepherdesses. Tyndarus. Micon .

Prepos'd those various objects of delight To recreate your sent. Her's choyce perfumes Of unctious Narde, and Aromatick fumes. Our cost-neglecting cookes to please your tast Have drest choyce cates and veands of the best; And to delight your tooth we all conspire To adde what's corispond with that desire. Lastly this pastorall our wits prepare Even as second course to feed your eare. Expect no polish't lines, no sublime straines; But rurall Speech, such as is vs'd 'mongst Swaines. Observing it was Summer-time With fragrant flowers of each day Had made our mother Tellus gay, The new borne plumed minstrills fills The smiling heaven and ecchoing hills, With chirping musick, ev'ry grone Was made their quire.---Olympick Iove Commanded Aprels balmy shoures, To refresh the March bred flowers, And May perfection in each field To Aprels suckling babes to yield. The spring perfumed this brood, whose smell The Phenix nest might paralell. Now did approach the festivall Of god Silvanus nuptiall To his groue haunting Clarida , Then all the Faunes keept holyday. The nimble faries danc't, and all The dieties agresticall. Claius and kind Phisipile Vow'd loving Man and wife to be. So Clodin did to Colatine , So Serin to his Eglatine , So Cloris did to Coridon , And so delt sheapheards many a one. At length imploring love to be So propitious vnto me, To Mira the faire sheapheardesse In courteous wise, I did addresse My hand, my heart, my cap, my coyne, With all the good I could conjoyne, But she coy thing, refus'd to prove What gentle Hymen is, or loue. As pevish Daphne fled away From the illustrator of the day; Even so my sight coy Mira flies, My sighes she slights, my suit denies. When glorious Sol hath turn'd his back, And all the world is hung with black. Sleepe (natures soft-nurse) flyes my eyes, My mind's ore-cast as are the skies. When vailes are drawne, and dim fac'd night Have againe resign'd her right. To Phosphorus traine, when Titans head, Is washed from his Sea-greene bed, To shew his hoary locks, my griefe 'Gaine urge my tongue to beg reliefe To ease my minde, you Gods above, Or let me dye, or make her love. Propitious more betide the friend, good day, Joves spangled Canopie protect thee still; May he himselfe from's Saphire colour'd throne Descend to be thy guardian, good day. Wish me good day? it stands in idle stead, My Mira's coy, all my good dayes are dead. Cheare up sad Gripus , or the cause declare, Why thou art thus plung'd in a deepe fit of Unprofitable melancholy, what? Hast made a case of spissified teares For thy swoll'n eyes, which are to limbicks turn'd Through which a running pearly torrent flow That lay the dust thy stamping feet doth raise. What unexpected stratagem have thus Perplext thy minde, exil d thy judgement, and Condens'd thy understanding, and betray'd Thy spirits to disquiet passions. As frolick and as joviall I have knowne thee, As any of Paris followers, why then Dost terminate the sad Catastrophe And period of each sentence, with a sigh, A deepe, a farre-fetcht-sigh, such as would seeme The structures rafters for to cleave in sunder, But where such griefe I find, needs must I wonder. Cupid hath fixt a golden shaft in me, Which makes me love, but into Mira's breast Have shot a leaden, a hate-causing dart, To love, and not to be belov'd againe, Is misery counted by each rustick Swaine. Is love thy doloriferous disease? Quench, quench those smothring sparks, lest suffered They kindle, and increase into a flame, An inauspicious, and perpetuall flame. And like the glowing Amazonian cell, Scorch all that doe approch it nigh, and last Like fire-spitting Æ tna wast its selfe. Amour la fut jamais ou sans peur, ou sans pleurs, Love never was without both feares and teares. Let then the bucket of thy courage stout, Draw so much reason out of the noble well Of thy understanding, as soone will quench This childish, and unmanly agony. What sad disterous torches Hymens light At every nuptiall? what unfortuate hands Sincke in the circle of the wedding ring, Nought breed in bridal sheets, but pinching feares, Iarres, discontents, suspitions, jelousies, Which nought but parting death can terminate. If kinder Hymen prove propitious, And vexe thee not with these; a barren wombe, A curse as cruell, may annoy thee still, Or else abortive births thy joy may kill. Or if with setled hope her time she goes, And then invite Lucina to her throwes, Or by hood-winkt mischance, or open blame, Why may not Atropos for Lucina come. If that infest thee not, tis small delight To see a little wanton ride a cock-horse Upon a painted staffe, or heare him chatter, Like a taught Sterling, Parret, or hoarse pye. I'de rather fill a barne full then a bed; More profit tis to have a crooked plough Still going, then a tottering cradle rocke. But more then that, these I terme foolish men, (But foolish is the Amorists epithite, Ou peut a peine aymer ensemble estre sage, One scarse can be both wife, and love, together) That ere will trust their honour in a Barke, Made of so slight weake bulrush as woman, Apt every fleeting minute for to sincke it. And how canst thou expect fidelity, In the disloyall sex call'd feminine. Remember fiftie sisters, Belus daughters, Who all (save one) made of their husbands slaughters. And both th' Atrides had their envied lives Endanger'd by the falsehood of their wives. Euriphile (false Hag) her husband sould To Polinyces for a chaine of gould. And Queene Euridice conspired How to deliver to grim visag'd death Her regall Lord, and husband, to enthrone In his voyd roome her fancied Sonne in Law. The fierce Medea did delacerate Absyrtus tender members, to escape Her Fathers pursute, if we may rely On the report of sage Antiquity. Thou pleadst against thy selfe, Ile turn the point Of thy last daggar into thine owne breast. Thou sayst Medea tore in twaine her brother Absyrtus , tis confest, 'twas to discover Her ardent, and firme setled desire To follow Jason , ungratefull Jason , Who after that, left her and all her charmes, To clap another Lady in his armes. So have I seene a Horse-leach oft embrace, Cleave to and hang upon some bloud swoln face, Till its owne turne be serv'd, it holdeth fast, Untill his panch be full, then drop at last. But to our taske. Penelope liv'd chaste, Though twice five years her royall Lord was gone. Did not Æ neas flie, and leave his sword To let out over-credulous Dido's bloud. When as Hiero blam'd his wife, 'cause she, Never inform'd him of his stinking breath. I thought (quoth she) that all mens breaths smelt so. Arria when Petus was condem'd to dye, First stab'd her selfe, then giving him the steele, This wound (deare Petus grieves me not quoth she) But that which thou must give thy self grieves me. The Minians wives having obtained leave, To say valete to their dying Lords, Exchang'd their habits, and expos'd themselves (In their escaped Spouses roomes) unto The penalty of the offended Law. Dona the partner of her husbands woe, With him a long way (as his Page) did goe. When Conrad gave the Matrons leave to beare, From Weinsberg foe-girt town what best they lik't, Each tooke-up her owne husband on her backe. Cornelia Annia did prostrate lye, On her defunct Lords Sepulchre, and dye; For this cause annually a paire of Doves Are sacrific'd to their firme setled loves. And happy Phillacides loyall wife, From death redeem'd him with the losse of life. But many uncertaine waies hath Phillis gone. To find her runnagate Demophoon . Humanum est errare , I confesse, Both sexes then are faulty; but what else Doe thy deluded eyes discover in Thy Mira , that thy heart should fancy her. Ist for her skin-deep beauty (her chiefest pride) That's but times fading flowre, which as tis Most delicate, is as volatious. Its like unto the Colours Phidias drew, Which seemed most admirable to the view, But suddenly did vanish and impaire, At the weake puff of each aeriall breath. A wife is but a faire affliction. Symonides reputed her to be, The Shipwrack of a man, the tempest of A house, the troubler of quiet rest. A prison of life, a plague assiduall, A sumptuous conflict, a necessary evill, A horrible care, an ordinary battell, A dayly hinderance, the humane slavery, A faire Aspe, an inevitable paine, A pleasant damage, a domestick strife. If then coy Mira scorne with thee to dwell, On earth leave her to leade bruit Apes in hell. Quote not these Accherontick Anchorites. Those stollid moatheaten Foolosophers, That libell against Angels, those night-birds That doe defile even their owne nests, nay worse, That strangle sacrilegiously the fames Of their owne mothers; Those ungracious brats That impiously requite with Stygian Inke The Nectar which indugently they lent them. Heed not the hissing of that viperous brood Of Parricides to their own mothers names. A female is the second part of man, She is a male i'th the newest edition, A wife's the best of her Lords movable. For such a one fierce Champions have prov'd tame, The stoutest Souldiers trembled, and look wan, Ready to give their ghost up at a frowne, The oracles of wit and Philosophy; Have been loves fooles, and bent their litterature, But to expresse great loves Supremacie, And the extent of its Dominions. Nay under Venus sacred Ensignes march, Etheriall troopes of high mounted gods. Well, each man as he likes, but should the mad Disloyall Sycophant, whose spheare is woe, Attempt to shoot a raving shaft at me, In's many peeces I would make't recoile Upon his corps, as there be golden sands, In the Pactolian or Tagean shores. Cease, cease, good Hegio , to repine at love, Atlantas pace was staid by golden balls. And gods themselves are oft ensnar'd by love, For they have slipt beyond their skill in that, They have made beauty of a greater force Then they themselves are able to resist. For L aeda, Jove became a wandring Swan, And for Europia a loud lowing Bull, And for Antiopa a Satyre rude, And for bright Danae a storme of Ore. Did not Apollo leave his burnish't throne, Lay by his tresses? and in humane shape, Most humbly beg a boone at beauties gate? Did not Alcides for Jole's sake With huge oft draw the slender threed. He was tane captive by his captives looke, She tooke the Conquerour that had her tooke. Kind Paris for to steale his dainty peece, Travell'd as farre as betwixt Troy and Greece . And Perseus amongst the Negroes sought, And faire Andromade from Jnde brought. Cupid can make the Regall Lyon sport, In amorous dalliance with the frisking Kid. Venus can yoake the ravenous and fell kite, With milder Swans in the same Chariot; Immane rapacious Eagles she can linck And timorous silver-brested Doves together. When she commands all animalls lay by Their contrarieties, and antipathy. Exit. Enjoy, sir, your conceit, but for my part, I am invulnerable, thou blind Boy Shalt never take me captive, I am like Achilles dipt in Styx , nor doe I feare Thy boy-ships shafts, goe play with angry Bees And painted Butterflies, and at the Wasps nest, And when th'art stung, in thy mams lap goe rest. Do's slight thy quiver, and blaspheme thy bow, He sayes he's shot-proofe, scornes thy archery, Scoffes at thy skill. Ile penetrate his heart, Ile make him be an earnest Votary Unto a marble-hearted female Saint. Ile melt to amorous thoughts his soule of stone, Ile torture 'm in loves torrid, frigid Zone. Ile make him in the same flames freez, and fry, The world shall be inamour'd of his woe, Ile find a Shepherdesse in whom he'le joy, And this his darling I will soone infect With coynesse and with nicenesse, for her sake. His morning Orisons shall nothing be But numbers of innumerable sighs, Which he shall count by pearly teares, not beads. Ile make the cherries of her ruby lips The onely cordials for to sustain His loathed life, and those shall be like to Fugacia poma , which like Tantalus He alwaies shall desire, and alwaies misse. Ile make him view the place where she hath set, And thither he shall repaire, as if he thought, The place some soveraigne vertue did containe To ease him, and to cure his gnawing paine. Let him not wander far from home to seeke Deepe streames in which to wash his frisking flockes. Let such uncessant flouds flow from his eyes As may supply the want of rivolets, Let his pin'd cheekes and hollow countenance, Affight all wolves from his secure sheepe, Let him spend all his daies in pinching griefe, And melancholy discontents; and looke Like to a wither'd tree o're-growne with drosse. Let his illetable and pensive sighes, Scare all rapacious, and omenous Ravens From picking out the eyes of his young Lambs Bleating for nutriment unto their dammes. Innumerable such effects as these, Shall all be caus'd by this keen pointed dart. When as the long-tongu'd Lord of envious light, Whose presence make the day, whose absence night. Betray'd my mother, and the god of warre. Unto the sooty, black, club-footed dolt, As he was tempering of a thunder-bolt, For to revenge this wrong, I made him prove, The power of my golden shaft and love. And I will make this Hegio soone confesse, I am a god, and of the starry race. He shoots. Now lay thy hatred downe, thy spite decline, And prove a votarie at Daris shrine. Exeunt. Nor did fond Paracelsus teach my Sire To make a man without conjunction, What furious madnesse did possesse my brest To flout at love? and wrong the femal sex? And to requite in a sharpe Satyrs straine, The roundelayes, and charming lullabies, That my indulgent genetrix did warble? What are my braines grown dry, or my bloud cold? Or am I on a sudden waxen old? I thought, though Cupids aire-deviding shaft, Soone penetrated the well tempered Corslet: which the hot-halting god of fire, Made for his boysterous rivall, it should not find, Or make a way to vulnerate my mind. And therefore Venus I blaspem'd thy sonne, But now I sing a Palinodia . Alas I have beheld that lovely face That from her eyes shot Cupids into mine; T'abuse my sight, and worke upon my frailty, With their smooth oratory to undoe me, Among thy other trophies let me be, Kind Cupid Hertan Porrigo to thee. Me thinks soft love hath lately made a breach Into the batter'd bulworks of my breast, And there commandeth all my yeelding powers, Which now insulteth in their vassalage. One looke hath struck my soule into a feaver, Me thinks affection whispereth in my eare Faire Daris name, Daris the shepherdesse; An object beautified with the choice gifts Of liberall nature, and of vertue too, My wandring eye hath made my heart receive So good opinon of the forenam'd Nymph, And hourely it solliciteth my tongue, To trie my fortune, and to let it know, Whether its like in Daris love to rest In happy blisse, and blissefull happinesse; Which if deny'd, its suddenly prepared, To leave my skelliton unto grim death. But courage Hegio , let not cold despaire Chill thy greene, and wide-gaping wounds too fast; She is a woman, and she may be wonne, Venus Adonis lov'd, why may not she Prove love-sick too, and at length fancie me: Shall I be bashfull then, and so expire With griefe; fie, fie, what shall a womans eye Prevaile so farre o're me to cause me dye, And leave my name in the fooles Callender, And there be noted with a rubie letter, For a supereminent Festivall; No, I am loath to leave earth yet, Ile try If I may live, and find a remedie. Exit. Put'st Hesperus twinckling traine to flight, When as thou rowzest, and display Thy golden locks, and summon day; Thou who dost rest thy drowzie-head, In aged Thetis froathy bed: When as thy gilded Car of day, His glowing axle doth allay. Thou who in twice 6. Months fulfill Thy journall on th'Olympian hill, Illustrious Lord of light, in vaine Thou bragg'st with arrowes to have slaine Thy Python sterne, whose massie bones Were Iron barres, like congeal'd stones His knotty sinewes were, the boughes Wer's shady covers; his great troughes Deepe Rivolets, which he (well nigh) Caroused at one watering dry: His belching shot forth flames, his eye Shin'd like the dapled morning skie. Faire Venus thy young hoodwinkt sonne More glorious trophies oft have won, Thou that crown'st thy loves with bayes, Inventer of mellodious Layes. Thou left'st Pernassus bifork't hill, And Tempe thy faire domicill, At loves command, and all to be At Daphne's shrine a Votary. Thou that did'st by virtuall heat The happy plants, and herbes create, Couldst find no plant, or herbe to be A medicine for loves maladie. When thou commandst the birds to bring, In triumph to the world, the Spring, The new-clad earth hath quickly lost Her Snow-white roabes, no chilly frost Candies the grasse, no ycie creame Congeale the lake, or pearly streame; No snow lies sheltred in the shade, The earth is thaw'd and tender made: For all thy heat, thy love doth lowre, Nor had thy scalding rayes the power To thaw her Marble yce, and this T'was caus'd her Metamorphosis . Large limb'd Hercules trebly blest With fame, thou who in youth exprest Deedes of honour, thy cradle's crownd With brave achivements, which renown'd Thy name; thy valour was suppli'd With strength, thy haughty spirit defi'd An hoast of men, Heaven ne're conjoyn'd So strong a body, or so stout a mind. Brag not cause you slew and withstood Within the thick N aemaean wood A beast, the temper of whose heart Was like a nether Milstone; Dart, Nor threatning Sword, nor frightfull Speare, Could terrifie it with Panick feare: Like knotty wreaths of craggy brasse His sinewes were, a noise did passe From's mouth, which might strike deafe the eares Of mortals, and affright the Spheres, You wore his ruggid shaggie hide About your shoulder, and left side. The Hydra by thy hand was slaine, Whose heads lopt off sprouted againe. The mud was made his downie bed, The stones were pillowes for his head, His speckled jawes which hideous were, Thy brawny armes did boldly teare. Thy club made th' Erymanthean Boare. Lye weltring in his ruddy goare; His sharpened tusks shall spoile no more (As it was wont to doe before) Arcadia , which in antique dayes Did warble out her well-tun'd Layes, And sing loves on her oaten reed, Whilst her secure flocks did feed. The Centaure thou subdu'st by force, Halfe like a man, halfe like a horse. Swifter then wind you ran, or thought, On foot a running Stag you caught. Rapacious bird Stymphalide , Were made a prey to death by thee. Thou mighty Scavinger wert able To clense the foule Augean stable. You made a Bull to crosse the Maine, And graze on Neptunes liquid plaine. And Diomedes fell monster, Who made his captives provender To his proud pamper'd steeds, by thy Revengefull hand did justly dye. False Cacus thou didst crush to death, And 'twixt thy armes squeeze out his breath. Cease the adjuring world to tell Of thy forc't entrance into Hell. You swadled Charon with his oare, The triple-headed ban-dog roare, And yelle: you Pluto ere you're gone Confronted on his jeaty throne. Hesperides fruit, sweet and gay, By thee were stolen, and borne away. By Juno's labours you war'nt broke, And yet you yeelded to loves yoake. Thus Love made Hegio to espie Sweet Daris Phisiognomy, And prove close pris'ner to that eye, Whose frownes make him prepar'd to dye. Love wound her too, that we may all Keepe holyday at their Nuptiall. Exeunt. Of Passion, we both blest objects love. But through their nicitie, and coy disdaine, We're like Loves cursed abjects both to prove. Now, now we Symbolize in egritude, And Simpathize in Cupids malady. My drooping head, my deepe contracted brow, My bloudlesse cheeks, dead eyes, pale lips, faint tongue, Shall strive in each point thine to equalize. My heart even now resolv'd my hasty feet Should measure out the over tedious way To Daris (whose faire face a garden is, In which fresh beautie plants her choysest flowres But frozen Winter keeps his risidence. It h Domicil of'r Adamantine heart.) I thought each wearie step to be a mile, I thought each pace to be a measur'd league, Untill I heard her tender nibling Lambes Imploring with their bleating oratory, Some aliment of their indulgent dames. At length I spi'd upon a happy mount. My Daris , whom the Sunne did gently kisse, (Being then mounted in his mid-day heat.) Daris both singing sat, and knitting too. As if her nimble fingers sought to keep, True tune with her tongues Musicke.--- Thus shee sung.  That dry hath been, Hasting unto the Christall Springs, Where downe he flings His prostrate body, then he'le be With bended knee A Votary Vnto the flowing Dietie. But when his sweating face is drencht And thirst be quencht In her coole waves, then this his sweet With saucy feet He kicks, and from the slighted place Soone moves his pace, And court no more The silver Nymph so lov'd before. So Io was with foule scorne wasted, When once tasted By the injurious ravisher Great Jupiter , Who first with prayers did invade The credulous Maid; After the rape He plagu'd her with a brutish shape. Kind Mayden Goddesse by thy skill Protect, and still Let netts of passions finest thread Never thee spread, Nor snaring Poems proffer'd be T'intangle me. For they indure For their reward a Calenture. That fondly prove too kinde to cure Loves disease.---I'de rather sure That my fond Lover still should pine Then that his wanne cheek should assigne, A sempiternall blush to mine. Still chast Dian let me be thine. Ile vow allegiance at thy shrine, No Nuptiall bands shall me combine. Whilst thus she sung, the winds grew whist, the wild Incensed Beares, and Panthers proved mild, Amazed I a fixed tree did prove, But wonder blasted trees did dance, and move, Each bends his palsie tops to worship her, And turne obsequious Idolater, Her Lyrick ayres intic't the ravish't quire Of birds to come, which (being come) admire. The scaly fish to heare her voice did lay Upon the waters top, and frisk, and play. Ere while I fondly thought love could convay (Although he's deified) no other way, But through the gazing eyes, into the heart His love-infected, keene and fatall dart, But whilst I heard this smooth-tongu'd Syren sing On the harmonious aier-deviding wing Of her sweet voice, it plainely did appeare, That subtile love could enter at the eare. Long time I stood amaz'd, at length vow'd I To live by her propitious smiles, or dye By rigorous frownes shot from her awfull eye. I sad for nuptiall love, she strait deny'd, I plead affection, by she reply'd (Disdainfully) denialls, and left me An abject unto love and miserie. Even now anatomiz'd by groanes and sighs, Almost interr'd and buried in woe, To Mira's pastures I resolv'd to goe, The sheep and lamkins with rich fleeces loaden, Became my spokes-men, and with bleating noise Pleaded at Mira's barr for my admission. She mounted sate upon a happy hillock. Clad in the verdent plush of Madam Nature, In twisted braids of silver Lillies knittiug, The loose traine of her amber dropping haire. Phoebus my rivall prov'd, and wo'd my faire, He graz'd upon her corall lips, and bath'd Himselfe in balmy juice of fervent kisses. He seiz'd the rose-buds in the spicy beds Of her delicious cheekes, whilst thus shee sung.  Flame, and expire. Fond love doth faile With brittle beauty. Beautie's fraile Like Junes raine, or Decembers Sunne 'Tis quickly done. Or like to the Solsticiall flowre, It buds and withers in an houre. Caelia's locks so aptly twin'd, Each haire would bind Olympick Jove , In a strong twisted net of love, If to descend downe he assumes His Eagles plumes, These haires will change their hue, and grow Hoary and cold, as melting snow. Like to a comely field of Snow Now shewes her brow, Rutts shall betray Ere long, and wrinkles deep display, Times plough have furrowed her brow. An Ice shall flow Through ev'ry veine, she shall discry Pale Death displaid in her dimme eye. Each beame shot from her eye so gray Creates the day, That eye oft made By winkes, the noone-day Sunne a shade. Now it is youthfull Cupids nest, 'Tis at the best. For it will prove his grave, and be Ecclipsed in obscurity. Of flowres both the King and Queen In'r cheeks are seen By graces led Thither, and laid in nuptiall bed On whom sips like Nymphs doe wait In regall state. They blush and redder grow, by this That they themselves, themselves still kisse. No Lilly shall be found, or Rose In cheeke, chin, nose, When age growes on And beauties Summer time be done, As Swallowes seeke when Summers gone Some warmer Sunne. So will disloyall Lovers all Which now fond Celia servants call. Then shall I love a man that may Love for a day. But when I'me pin'd, And yellow spred, where red once shin'd, Leave me an abject for to be To misery. No, No, the worst of Stigian paines, Is itch of love, in age dry'd veines. This musick stupifi'd my ravisht eares, And wrought an emulation in the Spheares. The Eccho listned to her warbled tones, And told their Joyes for every word aloud. Whilst she did subtly charme my listning eare, Love emptied his quiver on my heart. Musick so thaw'd my Adamantine mind, That not an arrow did resistance find. Thus did my Tyrant celebrate the prize, Act, and present, the triumph of her eyes, So Nero once with harp in hand survai'd His burning Rome , and as it flam'd, he plai'd But to proceed, I begg'd great Iuno's blessing, T'attend my hopefull suite in the suppressing Loves common foes, disdaine, and nicetie. I made assault but never yet could board, Or scale the Adamantine heart of hers, I fly like a struck Hart before the hounds, With th'winged wantons Javelin in my wounds. Exit. As when my over daring eye behold The suns bright beames, I twinckle with my lids: Even so the rayes, the day creating rayes, The radient rayes, which Daris doe dart forth From th' Ebon arches of her heavenly browes (Whose winkes convert the highest mounted sun, The noon-day sun, unto a gloomy shade) Have blasted my weake eyes, and lately led Unto her royall person me a slave. My eyes are swollen up, as loath to see The glaring sun, so injurious to me, That bright coale which cleares all the world beside Hang like a fatall commet ore my head, Ere since he's so unkind in holding forth Enough of light to see this shining lasse Whose eyes will prove my parching burning glasse. Exit. Me, for what? For what? each busie Shepherdesse have fill'd Her lap with flowers, for to compose, and knit A nuptiall chaplet for your Bridall browes. The Bridegromes wanting still, No, tis Hegio , Psh, if your lovesick Gripus speed no better In's earnest suite, then Hegio's like to doe Hel'e never breake with you a Bridall cake, But why should I say if? 'tis sure enough Each Shepherd now is tuning of his pipe To warble your Epithalamians. Then let them turne them into Elegies And Epicediums for Gripus death. And let the Shepherdesses weaue a wreath Of Willowes to encircle Hegio's browes. Here comes our Parents. These faire maides, I hope, Are counselling each other to prove kinde, And pitty their distressed lovers. Lovers, Sir, what have we to doe with lovers, wee Have sworne alleageiance at Diana's shrine; If we should love, we breake the faith we owe To Virgin purenesse, and our vestall vow. Such are like plum-trees that doe crooked grow Ore standing pooles, they laden are, and rich With pleasant fruits; but nought but chattering Pyes, And Crowes, and Catterpillars feed upon them. O fie upon this single life, forgoe it, We read how Daphne for her peevish flight, Became a fruitlesse Bay-tree, Sirinx turn'd To a pale empty Reed, Anaxarite Was frozen into Marble, whereas those, Which married, or prov'd kind unto their friends, Were by a gracious influence transform'd Into the Olive, Pomegranet, Mulberie, Became Flowers, precious Stones, or eminent Starres. Imprudent girles, why should we women prove Sore tortures, and disturbances to men, If we be foule we're odious and loath'd. And such unkinde girles as these are, if faire, Are like rich vessels full of poysonous drugges, Or like blacke Serpents arm'd with golden scales. Cease to perswade, for Gripus name and death Have both one sound in my esteeme, that tongue Which warble forth the one, doe chant the other. That direfull sound, that most disasterous knell Attendeth Hegio's name, and ever will. Rare grace, and comely feature both are joynd In you, as if they both cospir'd to make Two parragons, which should excell each other. Shall common beauties then, and meaner faces Enjoy these joyes, which your selves deny Unto your selves, no let your gentle hearts Imbrace the sweets due to so faire deserts, Your lovely features were bestow'd on you By liberall nature for to be injoy'd; And 'twere a sinne where she have beene so free Of her best graces, to be nigardly. Wound not your selves through your poore lovers sides, Starve not your selves to make them pine away, Be kind unto your selves, if not to them. Vse time, the squabling Snake with age ore-worne Casts off her hide, and re-assumes a new. The towring Eagle change her aged plumes, The fading Rose (the glory of the Spring) Receive an annuall birth from the sharp briar, Be wise, and crop in time your beauties flowers, They ne're spring more, being faded once, like ours. Vse time, no lovers will croud to impart Their thriving sutes to your age deafned eares, Chuse constant lovers then whilst that you may, Such as love for a like-long-age, not dayes, Your beautie's fraile, and soone will bud, and wither, With beauty love will bloome, & blow together. Beauty and love are like the coupled twins Of wise Hipocrates , who both at once Received birth, and nutriment, and death. He ne're shall crop my youthfull beauties flower That i'le cease to love, when beauty 'gins to lower. Exeunt. Renew my suite, attempt a further triall, Intreat, conjure, I left no way untri'd I must not, no I would not be deni'd. This was my resolution, but she The obdurate portall of whose Marble heart Was lockt, and barr'd against the powerfull art Of oft repeated teares, or far fetcht sighs, Or deep, and heart-bred groanes, stood deaf, and dumbe She must not, no she would not be o're come. I never move her, but my hopelesse triall Alwayes reade Hieroglypicks of deniall. Still lets proceede, who knowes we may prevaile, Let not our best advis'd indeavours faile, To be employd, lets make a further triall, And fairly speed or find a foule deniall. Exeunt. Some love, and are no whit regarded, Some woe and speed, some woe and be Rejected for their loyaltie, This tyrant love compar'd may be To th' Macedonian dietie Whose lookes seem'd sometimes to disdaine This Champion, or that again, It would cast amorous glances forth Applauding to his mighty worth. No torture, no affliction Like to true loves passion, This made Sophocles wish his foe Might onely be tormented so. Exeunt. Finis Act. 2 d . Gall'd with loves tyranous torment, lo I ly, Inthrall'd, and bound in Cupids golden chaines, Perplext with wo, my feature all is blur'd And chang'd, and I am Metamorphosed. I am transformed too, O how hath passion Thrust all my thoughts, and senses out of fashion. My head of late was thatcht with yellow straw Now it is perriwig'd with Winters gray. My front as smooth as Ivory while ere Now beares deepe furrowes, made by sorrowes plough, In which the seeds of woe are scattered. My eyes are Ilands, they're girt round about With troubled Oceans, and tides of teares. I spend those teares whose store will ne're be spent, Yet shall I want teares, before cause of them. My Mira score not up my cares, and feares, Not keep a Catalogue of my sad teares. Quotidian feavers of reproch and scorue, Have chill'd the vigour of my wounded heart, Yet by the scorching raies of Daris eyes, It still is ignifi'd and glowes, and flames, O Daris let the showres of thy love Asswage the glowing fire of my passion. If I should put to Sea and boldly plough The glassie face of Neptune , love would be My Pylot. If perchance I walke abroad For recreation, my companion Is love, the fruitlesse love, of coy Mira . When the soft charmes of labour chasing sleepe Seize with their downy wings upon my eyes, When heavy Morpheus with his leaden keyes Close up my watchfull senses, love's my pillow. Me thinks the gentle gales of winds that move The trembling boughs, and through their palsie leaves, Breath musicke, whisper Mira's name to me. Me thinks the notes of all the chirping birds Are chang'd, and warble nought but Daris name. Me thinks that Eccho which doe alwaies speak In answer to my sighs, say Mica's coy. Tis true, Diana hath more Nimphs then one In store, but no fruit else will please my taste, But what Hesperides garden brought forth, No colour please my eye but that which was Stained by the fish Maurieticall , And none but Mira can my fancy move. O Mira that my heart were flint like thine, Or thine were soft, and plyable, like mine. The birds wander in the flowrie fields In the wild benefit of nature, live Happier then we; for they may choose their mates, And carroll their sweet pleasures to the Spring, Whilst I doe languish like a Plant in drought, And lay all pickled up in briny teares. Great Jove who setst upon thy Saphire throne, Spangled with Starrs, Remember, Venus sonne Transfixt his darts in thy celestiall breast, And learne to pitty slighted Lovers by The pangs you felt in that extremity. Sacred Apollo call to minde the time When thou wert beauty blasted, as I am, And if thy ayre dividing dart can't make Mira to love, let them make Gripus dye. And thou faire Paphian Queen (cause of my wo) Thy self didst once implore Adonis love, Prove you as kind, I'me tortur'd on thy rack, Ease my sad soule, or cause my heart-strings crack. Exeunt. What though with wrie-mouth'd scorn and squint-ey'd scoffes These Shepherds once did sleight and scorne thy bow, Yet don't extend thy punishments so farre, As they should fatall prove, son save their lives. Yeares heavy loaden wirh their months retire, Months end, their date of measur'd dayes being come, And dayes full hour'd to their periods tend, And howres chast with light-foot minutes end, Let their undaunted e'uls now find reliefe, Let rip'ned time now terminate their griefe. What pretty weather-cocks these women be, I've oft heard Willow-wearing Crites say, (Accusing Dilla of unconstancy) That Uenus was a Planet, no fixt Sarr, Nor did he deviate from truth in this, Twice in a minute she will wax, and wane. Of late made drunke with furious passion, With eyes converted into raging flames, With wrinckles on your sterne contracted brow, Wrinkles (by anger made) like Sepulchers, In which poore Hegio might have been interr'd; Urged with speedy haste, you summon'd me To give attendance, without slow delay, I shook my nimble pearle-imbroider'd wings, And cut the skie to execute your will, I had command to torture Hegio , To tosse him in loves blanquet, and to make him The most distrest of men, a scorned lover, Now you would surfet him with happinesse, Now you would throw his Mistris Julio's armes, You'd have her struck too, that she sick might be No more of coynesse or unconstancie. The Eagle scornes to stoop unto a Fly, The Regall Lyon doth refuse to prey On him that prostrate lies, and will you prove More cruell then these be? Then Poets pens Shall Satyrs drop, and paint out thy disgrace, Thy childehood, nakednesse, and hoodwinck't face, Prove kind, and ev'ry tongue shall carroll forth, And chant in amorous lines thy lasting praise. Cupid, he shoots. Yeild (gentle girles) to love, now each goe rest, Her amourous heart in her true lovers breast: Lanch forth sad soule into an Ocean Of teares, driven by the blustring gales of sighs, To find the Haven , and seeke safe barbour out, But stay a while, I thinke I'de neede provide Some other Pylot for to steere and guid Thy ballanc't bulk , besides sorrow, and griefe, For these I feare will strike, and split o'th sands , Wanting a Compas in their quavering hands. How ere th'art like to leake , and sinck i'th waves , Ith' raging Waves of sad despaire, if so Thy sailes and tacklings thou to flames maist turn Cast overboard thy hope, thy carkasse burne. My grief's a boundlesse Sea that knowes no Shore . O that I were a Basiliske that I Might venome Daris , or unvenom'd dye. To some tenebrious dungeon let us hie Where never day shall be acquainted with us, Where we'le remaine still in obscurity. Cursing our fates, and never more behold Sols radient and splendidious raies; and heare The melancholly Owle Nictimine , (The chiefest friend of solitarinesse) The sullen Dogs, the immitating Apes, Shall still converse with us, and such dumb things, To whom nature denies use to sound our names, Our grifes to blab, or fames to damnifie. Fie, We wish for death, we live without all hope, Hope. Hopes t'obtaine our loves their are none, One. 'Tis bootlesse to try againe, Try againe. Say, shall we then obtaine reciprocall love? Love. Shall we assuredly Upon a babling Eccho's voice rely? Alas, he fondly prates, shall we beleev't? Beleev't. We will; and as thy tale prove true, So will we credit Eccho's . Credit Eccho . Now as well is hotter, when the ground Weare Winters hoary mantle, then when as Earth decking Flora doth invest the grasse In Summers tapestry, and Junes parliament roabs By an Antiperistasin, or by The cirumambient ayres humidity, Which in a manner doe besiege it round, And make th'intrinsique heate unite, and so Concentre to resist th'invading foe: So let their coynesse set an edge on us, And cuspidat our animosities. Tune cede malis, sed contra audentior ito, Yeeld not to ev'les, but 'gainst them stoutlier goe. Exeunt. How happy am I in my bud of youth? The blossome of my nonage is not blowne, Nor doe the strength of nature (yet) beginne To uneffeminate my downy cheeke. I place no happinesse in womens smiles, Nor torture in their ill-becomming frowues, My heart is shot-free (yet) nor doth it lye in the faire casket of a Females eye, But haile Agroicus , what think'st of love. In good sooth, I know not how to devine it, or give an extract deminution of it, but as I deceive, its very nocent, and almost omninocent, where it gits the upper hand. Love and the botts have kill'd many an old horse, my Grandame told me that. And I have heard an old blancient boet say that Megander swum through Hell to his Hero , I thinke hee was a Goose to doe so; And yet my Zonne Tom did more the 'tother day, he leapt over a high wall, and waded through a deepe moate past his depth, to git to Margery . As I came up at the butt londs end, I met him in that case, but O, how did I bemire, and wonder, to see his new slop and all his cloathes bejeered with the mud of the pond he ran through. The old Boet I bominated before, said, That when folke fell in love, a blind naked boy, he called him Stupid , shot them, 'Twas he shot my Zonne Tom , by the Maskins I would give the best cow in my yard, to find out this raskall Stupid , and I would thrash him, as I did the Henne last Shrove-tuesday . Exeunt. Like as a guilty prisoner, upon whom Offended Justice lately past her doome, Drags his sad Irons from the loathed jaile, (Hopelesse to live) unto the cutted tree Where he stands muffled (but an inch from death) His last prayer said, and hearts confession made; At last (unlookt for) come a slow reprive. And gives the wretch some few daies more to live. Now he (lost in amazement) boldly rends Deaths muffler from his eyes, and scarcely knows (Being over-joy'd) whether he lives or dyes: Even so joy whose life is quit from death, And despaire, by Mira's propitious smiles, Now 'gins t'approach my Festivall, and rest, I've chast dull sorrow from my pensive brest. Thanks gentle Eccho for thy sweet direction, Thankes gentle Juno for thy kind protection, Daris is wonne, Hence loathed Melancholly, Avaunt, avaunt from hence thou Snake-hair'd Devill, Thou hollow-eyde monster full fraught with evill, Hence, to the Abysse below, thy way imbrace, For that's thy Mansion, thy proper place. The gulfe that wants a bottom, there mayst dwell, And preside o're the counsell of darke hell, Inthroan'd in Radamanthus seat maist raigne Among the Cacodemons , ne're againe Ascend to cast thy influence ore my braine. You that in this unfortunate age of love, This haplesse time of of Cupids tyranny, Have felt the worst that winged wag could doe Now banish sorrow, henceforth you shall be So happy as to thinke no wight is wretched, Or that there is a thing call'd miserie. What pleasures Poets faine of after death, In the Elizean arbusted groves, Shall spread themselves 'fore you, as if you were Tenants, or Farmers of those blessed shades, It shall be a perpetuall Spring, where you Inhabit, all disasterous dewes, and blasts Shall strangers to your happy pastures be. Come follow me, this my well-lighted flame Shall light you unto Ceres Tempell, where (Expecting you) they Nuptiall garlands weare, That hold your hearts chain'd in their golden haire Exeunt. Ring out yee Christall Spheares, Once blesse our listning eares, Let your sweet silver chime (Keeping harmonious time) Carroll forth your loud layes In the winged wantons praise. Mab thou Majestick Queene Of Fairies, be thou seene To keep this holyday, Whilst we dance and play, And frisk it as we goe O'th light fantastick toe. The Satyres and the Fawnes Shall nimbly crosse the Lawnes, O're tawny sands, and shelves, Trip it yee dapper Elves, Dance by the fountaine brim Nymphs deck't with Daisies trim, Come Lovers all in rowes, With your blith and jolly browes, With flowry chaplets crown'd, Come Lovers walke a round This Village, Venus say, Annually this day Her Sonnes triumphs shall be, Lovers expresse your glee. Exeunt cantantes. Our Lovers now find in their strict imbraces The true Elyzium , (the best of places,) Their joyes are full, they nothing want at all, But your acceptance of their Pastorall. FINIS. drowsie eyes any longer waking, who by this time, sollicited them to commend themselves to the elder Brother of death, but upon the approaching of the next Aurora , before the welkin had fully put aside the sable vizard of the night, before the stars were covered, and the earth discovered by the Sunne, Philispis (accompanied with a troope of Knights of such renown, and transcendent worth, as future times must out of duty owe them the debt of an honourable memory) came to celebrate his nuptials with the Lady Julia . Now every busie Virgin is preparing costly jewels to adorne the Bride. every willing hand is providing ornaments to deck her. Rare beauty and well becoming grace damaskt her rosie cheeks, her glorious eyes did spark and rutilate, and eject rayes, her pace was carelesse, her deportment neglected, seeming to discover an amorists passions. She was led by Flaminius to the Chappel of the Castle; Flora did weaue the violets into a purple rugg, to spread her paths with. Cardinall de Rechileu tied that Cordian knot which sempiternally conjoyned these Amorists. Having pay'd the duty they owed to their stomackes, for the greater magnificence of the solemnization a justing was held in the presence of Phylispis , and Julia , who now knew no other spheare besides joy to move in. The first that entred the lists was Flaminius , the first that encounter'd him was Mendorus , who though he was a Knight whose heroick deedes of chivalry, neither time can weare out of memory, neither death himselfe by any meanes disolve) was forced at the first meeting to make a pillow of his Palfries croop. The second that came against Flaminius , was Plitilius , in whose acts there is truth enough to make him famous, besides that which is fabulous, when these two sons of valour, (whose lightfooted steeds ran as if they had beene begotten by the winde, and ballassed with quick silver) met, breaking their knotty speares even to their gauntlets, they seemed to have dim'd the air with the dispersed splinters of their shivered lances, whilst they passed by each other, not without evident tokens of their approved prowesse encharacterized upon their raced gorgets, the next time Flaminius encountred him with so much force, as he inforced him to leave his saddle. Our Champion next Antagonist was Alsus , a man of a haughty courage, and of grand experience in Military affaires, he bore for his device upon his shield, fickle fortunes whirling wheele; but this angry goddesse placed him in the lower spokes, for he was soone sent with his heeles upward to company his fellowes. Flaminius still continued unhorsing his unabiding enemies, till the declining lamp of light did treble each shaddow, and Titans fierie chariot horses defatigated with their tedious race, were retired to drench themselves in their hospitable salt bath, for the refreshing of their sweating members; at which time he left the lists, having renowned Victory for his hand-maid, and the trophies of the day adorning his crest. We may better imagine, then describe the rest of the entertainment, onely thus much, when the chorus of their dreames were ready to step upon the theater of the imagination, the over-wearied creatures of the world inclining to repose, being now survayd by the Pale Lady of the night, the princely company there present attended Philispis and Julia to their Amphithalame, where one of the Actors of the precedent pastorall warbled worth this Epithalamium . Mirth and nuptiall joyes betide Th' happy Bridegrome and fair Bride, Sol have quencht his glowing beame In the coole Atlantick streame, Now their shines no tell-tale sun Hymens rites are to be done, Now Loves revells 'gin to keepe, What have you to doe with sleepe? You have sweeter sweets to prove, Lovely Venus wakes, and love, Goddesse of Nocturnall sport Alwaies keep thy jocond court In this loving couples armes (O that my praiers might prove charmes.) Goddesse of the marriage feast Here approach at our request Saturnia , whose car I saw A harnest teame of Peacoks draw Fercely through the fleeting skie, Wherein sate thy majestie, On thee did an Hoast attend Of bright goddesses, descend From that chariot, and blesse Julia's womb with fruitfulnesse, Make her, when 9 Moneths be run Mother of a lovely son, Let every yeer the Queene of love Her new fill'd cradle rock, and move. Mirth and Nuptiall joyes betide The happy Bridegroome, and fair Bride. This Song being ended, they tooke away their candle, and wish't them good night. Soone after the nimble houres had yoaked Pirocis, Æthon, Eous , and Phlegon , the fire-breathing Palfryes of Apollo , and their master Phoebus leaving the Sea-greene bed of his watry Lover, had with his golden Chariot made a swift passage through the ribs of the deepe, and saluted him at his Chamber window, Flaminius arose to take his leave of this glorious assembly, then he returned to Poyssy , and by degrees visited all France , past through the meridian of the slow pac't Spaine , and drunken Germany , with the most part of those united Provinces, which are pluckt out of the jawes of Neptune , and after three yeares space he returned home to Naples , whose happy returne we heartily congratulate in these times. Take the low lowing Bull, the sharp-tuskt Bore, (Besmeared with Adonis ruddy gore.)

Of the CYPRIAN ACADEMY. cloyster of a slender nut, no, neither could the minde of the most renowned, and most worthy to be most renowned Flaminius bee included or reclused in that small locall compasse which circumscribed his body, but it continually made its transcursians and progresses abroad, to finde out and enjoy knowledge (its most optable object) though under remote regions, he was willing once more to leave his indulgent parents (whose lives were bound up in his welfare) and his selfe-sufficient country (though wee esteeme it difficient without him) that he might ratifie his judgement, and enrich his head with variety of knowledge, and leave fame for a patrimony to his posterity.

Now the spreading sayles are hoysted up, now the Anchors are way'd, and the wind also the part of a dutifull and observant servingman, waiting just behind him, and filling the swelling caves with prosperous gales, the cloath swel'd and grew proud of Flaminius presence, and the sea danced to receive him, and the winde sweetly kist the waters whispering new joyes to inrich'd Thetis , who had now quite forgotten to bee colerick wisht she bore Flaminius , he soone left the lessened land behind him and gentle Neptune afforded him such a favorable transmarian voyage, as hee with more then ordinary celerity discovered Dover , where hee landed but not lazed, for hee no sooner left admiring at the laudable beauty of the Island, (which was then fluorishing, encoying a well setled and a happy peace under an unusurped Governement) but he repaired to the Metropolitan City, Albions imperiall chamber, Troy- novant.

In this City his eyes made his mind know what power heavenly beauty had to throw it downe to hellish agonies, he spied the beauteous Clorinda walking in a checkerd garden among those flowers which contended for beauty to recreate her, and were ambitious which should be fairest because just like to her, who was thrice fairer then the fairest, Flaminious steps could find no further ground, but here he cast anchor, and became inamoured amoured of Clorinda , A Lady every way as rarely accomplished with vertues becoming a woman, as he was with graces adorning a man, she was borne in the metropolitan of beauties dominion, in complection a pure sanguine, in condition a perfect Saint, either her exterior feature, or inferiour faculties did captivate all beholders, for vertue tooke as much paines to adorne the one, as nature did to compleate the other.  Ut Sol in Coelis; ut Lux in sole videtur: Uirtus in vultu sic habitare suo, Spectator quicunque venit, discedit amator Aut illum virtus, aut sua forma capit. As Sol in heaven, as light in Sol abide: So vertue in Clorinda doe reside, Who comes to view her ere he goes will love, Her vertue, or her beauty will him move. As the Tartarian plant Boxaneth grows up in the visible forme of a Lambe, and insensibly eats up all the grasse round about it, so did she by an intrinsique kind of magick subiugate all hearts to her eyes. There wanted nothing in this Angell, that nature might add for perfection, or fortune bestow for wealth, or that the Gods at any time confer upon mortalls, the greatest raritie that the world could shew was her beauty, though the least thing that might be encomionized in her was her beauty. Bien que le corps soit bean l'ame est encore plus belle , her faire body was but a fair Inne of a far fairer guest within, an excellent Cabinet of an incomperable jewell, the gifts of her minde did as far transcend the perfection of her face, as that did the beauty of the rest of the Ladyes of the court, among whom she shewed like a silver dove trooping with rowes, or like Cynthia among the lesser stars, or like the discoloured tulip among weeds or like Jo among the rest of Argus herd. In a word let the curious hand of art extract from all vertues and graces an Elixer, or perfect quintessence of perfection  & it will appear but the picture of her; for to fill this treatise with elogies of her, were to put Hercules shoe upon an Infants foot, to clap Bucephalus saddle upon a Spanish Ginnet or lay Atlas burthen upon a childs shoulders, or to emptie the sea into a pond. One looke of this Paragon of the terrestiall paradise struck Flaminius into a fever, and fyred him with her love, the exorbitant flames whereof he could neither suppresse, nor conceale.  \---Quis enim celaverit ignem Lumine qui semper proditur ipse suo. Who can the ardent fire of Love conceale? Which by its owne light doth it selfe reveale. To this end the Poets painted Minerva the Hieroglyphick of wisdome vailed, to signifie that wisdome may be covered, and reclused, but Cupid the character of affection they portraitured naked, to insinuate that Love is not to be over canopied, but these are the petulancies of Poets. To our taske, his passions cannot be written of mee with out flouds of teares, (which would wet the paper, and obliterate the relation) nor read of you without griefe: he observed the place of her recreation, where she would walke alone, and thether would he repaire, esteeming the place happy, yea, and holy too, which had contained so soveraigne a beauty, one night among the rest in a sad fit of Passion, (as if his soule had beene gone upon some errand, and left his corps in a paune till its returne,) hee gave way to his imaginations to ruminate upon that which permitted him not to sleep, and these, or such like were his meditations, Alas Flaminius , what magick, what pyromancie, what enchantment is inshrined in the ancles of Clorinda's eyes that have this influence upon the heart? why shouldst thou annihilate thy selfe,  & pine, and dy for beauty, a guilded nothing, a rose can shew more vermilion then a Ladyes cheeke, a Lilly boast a richer white then her hand, alas a wife is but a faire affliction, 'tis true the disease of love is impatient, the desire extreame, whose assaults the wise can neither oppugne by policie, or the valiant by prowesse; its the epidemicall egritude of mortalls, and the best mallady in the world when it infects two together, but herein consists thy infelicity in affecting a Lady whom thou art no more like to obtaine then the Wolfe to drinke up the Moon, or the Gyants to dismount Jupiter . Thinkest thou that thou art caught alone with the bait of her Atheriall beauty, can an old hee goat bee without a beard, a leud userer without full baggs, a Uenus without a temple, or a faire Lady without a Lover. Can the Albion court afford never a votary to thy Saint.  \------Quae ditissima forma Mille procis placuit------ Whose feature thousands doe invite To admire, and delight. Will the Partridge let the ripe eares of corne stand for the sparrow, will the cat let the crummes lie for the Mouse, or English Lords bequeath beauty to an Italian; no no, expire rather with a private scar then publique shame, if thy Lady never lov'd any she will not know how to affect thee, if any, shee will not leave them for thee. But courage Flaminius .  \------Timidi nunquam statuere tropheam.  covard aimant n'ent ou ny' aura beile amye. Faint heart never won faire Lady, will you then loose the day before you begin the battell, will you conclude your selfe conquered before the conflict, will you cast downe your shield before your sword breake, Mastifes fawne when they are fed, Tygers stoope when they bee tickled, Bucephalus wil prostrate himselfe to bee carried, and women yeild when they be courted, cast anchor here then Flaminius , what needst thou,  \------Per saxa per Ignes. By Scilla and Charybdis , sea, and land, By Rocks, and shelves, heapes of moving sands, Run to rifle the Easterne shore, when thou maist behold farre more precious diamonds in her eyes, why shouldst thou,  Per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum. By Marine toyles And Martiall broyles. Steere thy course to Tyre for purple when thou maist find fresher in her ruddy cheeke. To what end shouldst thou dig Peru for that Ore which thou shalt finde excell'd by her golden haire, why shouldst thou ransack the rocky Licilian Sea for Corall, when thon maist enjoy it on her ruby lips? why shouldst thou seeke for Ivory in Africa when thou maist finde it upon her hands? what needst thou toyle in India for gummes when shee can breath a more redolent Diapasma? or run to Arabia to heare the Phenix sing when her voyce makes a far more melodious Diapason? Flaminius had of his acquaintance Grisonus an Italian who became his spokesman to Diaphoro (his Ladyes Guardian) to obtaine for him admission in this manner. Diaphoro , the intimacy that hath been alwaies between us since the first taste of our acquaintance, have embouldened me in behalf of a noble Lord of my own country, to solicite your councell and assistance in a businesse of grand importance: his name is Flaminius of whose perso vertue her selfe is proud of so great patrimony,  & of so comely personage, that it is dubitable whether hee bee more indebted to nature for the lineaments of his person, or to Fortune for the encrease of his possessions, he is of a quick inventive and penetrating capacity, without spot of morosity, or colour, hee is aliquis in omnibus , fraught with all kinde of scientificall knowledge, if you aske what countryman he is? I may rather say, what country man is he not? he is Cives mundi , a Citizen of the world, having with the sun (his fellow traveller) survey'd most of habitable and hospitable regions,  & in his travells being arrived in this happy kingdome, and come to this magnificent City, that powerfull dietie Love, which have enkindled the hearts of mightyest monarches with the beautifull lineaments of rosie cheek't Ladies, at this time have manifested its soveraignety over him, who is taken in the snare of Clorinda's love, and fetered with the chaine of affection. The countlesse griefes which day and night he indures may be as perswasive orators to moove any pittifull nature to favour him, he doubts not of successe, had he but accesse, which if you shall please to procure him, you shall bind together with me to your self this noble Lord in the most corroborated limitts of truest affections . Diaphoro replyed, Sir, amongst the rest of the Encomions of your Lord, you might have remembred the soundnesse of judgement, which I perceive and applaud in his choyce of Clorinda , a Lady adorned with singular beauty and chastity, excelling in the one Uenus , in the other Uesta. Zeuxis , having before him fifty of the most eminent beauties of Sparta to include all their perfections in the simulachre of one amiable Venus , said that fifty more of more excellent beauty then those would not administer sufficient beauty to shaddow the goddesse of beauty by; in the like manner it fareth with me, who dispaire by art to shaddow Clorinda (to whom the rest of her sex serve but as foyles) or by imagination to comprehend her. I may say, and that without a sol aecisme that truth her selfe might be her Panegyrist and yet continue naked. If I doe any acceptable service to Flaminius that might conduce to his obtaining her, esteeme it but the shadow of what I desire to doe, in the meane time let me crave your society together with Flaminius at a slender meale at my house at night, not for the cates which you shall finde, but for your company which I fancy, what want in cost shall exceed in courtesie, and welcome shall be as great as your cheere little. Grisonus (after due thankes returned) departed from Diaphoro to certifie Flaminius his friendship, who now call'd upon Ph aebus to whip on his lazie teame, and precipitate headlong to the west: which done hee repaired to Diophoro's house, where we will cover with a vaile of silence the entertainement (which was royall) though Flaminius best dish was the beauty of Clorinda , and Clorinda's the personage of Flaminius , so that they were both caught in one net, and both strucke with the same dart,  & before Ph aebus was ten times brought abed, their soules were knitt in an intire union, and their hearts lodg'd in eithers brest, but O the Remora's, and obstacles that obvaricate a lovers progresse, O the tristfull casualties, the dolorous accidents, the sad contingencies that waite upon an amorist, for no sooner was loves sacred jubile proclaimed by these new lovers, but a corrivall must step in to eclipse their joyes. The glorious sun exhales the noysome vapours of the earth, and the shining jet drawes to it the contemptable straw, and the rare beauty of Clorinda , (that loadstone of love) attracted the heart of Uernar and layd it prostrate at her feet. To give a character of Uernar , he would have made a fit standard-bearer for that gigantick troop that bad Jove battell, and besieg'd the gods. He halfe in despaire because of Flaminius and halfe in hope because of Decia Diaphoro's Lady, (whom he inserted iu read letters, in the catalogue of his best friends) tooke his way to Chelsey to Diaphoro's house, where he found Clorinda sitting in a coole arbour thatcht with sucklings, and guarded by the enamoured chirping wood quire, which came thither to adore her (who could shew more graces then there be sands in the glasse of time,) She sat upon a banck of Lillies which grew pale to see themselves excell'd in whitenesse by her faire hand, the arbour was lined within with Roses, which blushed themselves into a fresher cornation to assimulate her cheekes, the pavement was of purple violets and other redolent flowres which could bost no sweetnesse, but what they derived from her, by the entrance of this arbour ran a silver streame which with its bubling oratory did court the shore to dam up the torrent, that it might stand still to behold Clorinda , but being deny'd, it went murmuring away. The Nymphs and freshwater Syrens danc't, and the aeriall spheares laid a side their melodious lutes to lissen whilsts Clorinda gave an aire to these more charming notes. First shall the Bee abhor the smell of Hybla's fragrant boure, And sease her thigh with balme to swell? Suckt from each spicy flower. First shall the chastest turtle dove Forget to bill, and fly From her owne mate, and emblem prove of loath'd inconstancy. First Pan shall make a loving league betwixt the wolfes, and sheep First shall the hen her broode bequeath unto the Kite to keepe. First shall the huge Leviathan abide i'th sea no more, But come to sport with active man upon the parched shore. First shall the Lyon weary be. of solitary woods, And skip into the frighted sea to wanton in the flouds. First North with South its place shall change Orient with West shake hand, First steadfast earth shall move, and range, and ayre fixed stand. First spangled heaven below shall ly and sable hell above, Ere unto my Flaminius I false or unconstant prove. First shall my ashes passe the fire and cloyster'd ly in urne, Ere my affections expire or loves flame cease to burne. Love with my body shall not end that ne're shall faile, or fade, But shall upon my soule attend into the Sacred shade . Her Song ended; Uernar stept to her and thus spoke, Divine Madam , (Divine I call you because like a diefied goddesse you monarchize over my affections) the rare Idea of your beauteous portraiture, and supereminent accomodations have so fired my heart, that nothing but your propitious aspect can save me from becomeing loves abject. Since every part of you is deck't with some particular ornament, your face with etheriall beauty, your head with celestiall wisdome, your eyes with awfull majesty, and lovely lenity, make also your heart the throne of tender pitty, being the most excellent rayment, of the most excellent part. The lustre of your resplendent eyes have kindled those fires which nothing but the showres of your mercie can mitigate, yon have wounded one, you onely can heale me, like Achilles his lance you have as well a medicinall as a vulnerating vertue, the knife can as well spread a plaister as make a wound, and you can as well happifie me with your love, as pine me for your good- liking. Let not Flaminius (whose life is a meere blanck wherein brave actions shall never be inscribed for the militant of posteritie) enjoy what I sue for, Let not that stragling stranger, who is enamoured of every new face he beholds, enjoy you the glory of women, of men the only admiration, shall that loathed Issue of his fathers loynes, that slander of his mothers heavy womb, that rage of honour possesse that which love sick-Albion Lords have sued for in vaine? Modestie made in Clorinda's blushing cheekes, a fresh bed of corall, whilst she heard Flaminius (the mirrour of magnanimity and true patron of prowesse, and chivallrie, thus reviled, and though these petulant expressions might well have sturd up anger, yet his deportment did rather breed disdaine in Clorinda , who thus replied. If you knew how much your discourse displeaseth me, and how little it is like to profit you, you would esteem your time as vainly lost in pursuing your taske, as I account it over long untill you end it, and those flames of affection which you pretend shall sooner burn your heart to a cole, then enkindle mine with a reciprocall ardour. Clorinda having given Uernar this bittter pill to swallow left him in dispaire, and repaired to Diaphoro , and Delia , as she walked the flowres did ambitiously croud themselves into love-nets to entangle her feet, and kisse them, and detaine them prisoners in their amorous stalkes, the Daffadillies wept when she removed and the Tulip call'd all it's bloud into it's cheekes to court her, stay, Being come to Diaphoro and Delia , she said, As I was shrouding my selfe in a coole arbour, from the soultry rayes of the scorching sun, Vernar (the truest hyerogliphick of insolence) intruded, distill'd his lovesick passions into my loathing eares, and so reviled heroick Flaminius , with contemptible provocations as would whet any cowards sword to carve out the reveng of his reputation, Nay had it been spoke of a disceased Hero, the inraged spirit in pitty of the ashes so prophaned, would nimbly lift up the sweating marble, and leap into the wronged dust, which being now new animated would become 'its owne revenger. Diaphoro and Delia answered, We grieve that Uernar should say any thing that should produce your displeasure, but doubtlesse if you would please to blesse his suit with your good liking, it would extreamly conduce to your friends contentment. Clorinda coyned this reply. The torrent of my affections ran in another chanel, Alexander would have no man ingrave him in precious stone but Pergotales , and I will have my picture imprinted in the heart of no man but Flaminius , the Peacock is a bird for none but Juno , The Dove for none but Uesta , none might weare Uenus in a table besides Alexander , nor Pallas in a ring but Ulysses , as there is but Ph aenix in the world, so there is but one tree in Arabia called Rasin that she will build in,  & as there is but one Clorinda to be heard of, so there is but one Flaminius that she will like of. And let the inconvenience of forced watches be demonstrated in this Tragedy which I have oft heard Flaminius relate, ( viz ,) There fled in France some hundred and odd yeares since one Captain Coucy as gallant a Gentleman as those times afforded, if fortune had been as intentive to augment his possessions, as nature was to compleat his person, he was tost in Cupids blanket, and became servant to a gentlewoman from whom he received a paritie of affection, which newes no sooner arrived at her Parents eares, But they (to crosse her former intention) hudled up a constrained marriage, betweene her and one Monsieur Faiel , one whose wealth was more grave and weighty then his wit, and who had rather a mine of gold, then a golden mind, though his purse did guild his infirmities, and his purse compounded for his folly. Captaine Coucy (having an army of passions, for his convoy in discontent quitted France , and became a Commander in the warrs of Hungary against the Turke, where he receivd his imnedicable wound not far remote from Buda , being convaied to his Asylum, hee lingered and strugled with death some few dayes, and not long before he expired, he calld to him one of his Ueteran soldiers , and servants, of whose fidelitie he had formerly received sufficient evidence, he told him he had a businesse of grand importance to impart unto him, which he conjured him punctually to performe, which was, that after his soule had left his pined body, he should cause his corps to be ript open, and then take his heart out of his brest, and recluse it in an earthen pot, to be bak't to powder, then to inclose the powder in a small box together with that bracelet of Madamoisella Failes . haire, which had a long time entwin'd his left wrist, and with them a note which he had written to her with his owne bloud, and after he had cloysterd his carkasse in the bowels of his mother earth, to repaire with all expedition to France, and present that box to Madamoisella Faiel's fair hand, This direction led the old Servant by the hand, who having fullfill'd the former command (this being the last importunitie that he had left to expresse his duty to his Master) his hasty feet devoured the way to Paris , where comming to doe his errand Faiel interrupted his passage, and questioned him because he was assuredly certified he was Coucy's man, and finding his faultering tongue to let fall some unadvised slips, he and his Servants ransackt him, and interrupted the box with the note which discoverd what was therein contained, he dismissed the bearer with threats, and menaces. And delivered the powder to his cooke, advising him to make a little well rellished dish of it, without wasting a dust of it, for it was a deare and precious relick, and and conjured him to serve it in himselfe after the last cours at Supper, which being done Faiel commanded all the waitors to absent themselves and enterd into a serious discourse with his wife, how ever fines their nuptialls he observed she did indulge too much melancholy, and least it should bring her into a consumption, he had composed that approved cordiall, there upon he importuned her to eate up the whole dish, and after much perswading to declare what it was, he tould her she had eaten Coucy's heart, and so drew forth the box; and presented her with the note, and the bracelet, she (lost in amazement) in a suddain exultation of joy, with a deep sigh sayd, This is a precious cordial indeed , and so lick't the dish, affirming It is so precious that it's pitty ever to put any meat upon it , from this her repast she went to her repose, and as soone as the morning began to draw dew from the fairest greenes to wash her face withall against the approach of her glistring lover, she was found dead in her bead. Worse successe attended the inauspicous forced match of Æ gyptus .50. Sonnes to Danaus Daughters, who all (but one) made their bridall beds stages, whereon they acted their husbands tragedies, what inference may be drawn from all this conference but the inconvenience and misery of compelled marriages, to prevent such sad events my owne choyce shall procure my good liking; the chariot of the Sun is for Ph aebus , not for Phaeton, Seianus his horse will thrive with none but his Master, nor will the Tolosonian gold in rich Cepio's coffers, none can sound Mercuries pipe but Orpheus , non can unfold the Sphinx his riddle but Oedipus , none but Laertes his ofspring can rob Pallas of her Troysaving Palladium, Uenus delights to heare none but Mercurie , and Clorinda , to love none but Flaminius . This her discourse was so full of rapture, that they only began to be sorry when she did end her speech, and wisht (in wonder) that she held it lesse vaine glory to talke much, then they did pennance to give audience to her dulciloquie. But let us returne to Uernar . Now mischiefe began to unmaske her selfe, and take a pride to grow terrible, for he (seeing himselfe slighted) turned his love into loathing, and the heate of his affection into the height of malice, he repayred to, Flaminius and said. Sir, Bombar interposed betwixt Clorinda and your selfe and have eclipsed her affection from shining upon you, alas, your Lady plays fast and loose with you, her love is like a Gypsies knot, in one gale she both hoyst sayled,  & waighed anchor, in one wind she sounded both an alarum, and a parly, pretending nothing more, intending nothing lesse, then to love you, her tongue is furnished with fauning affection, as a Haberdashers shop with new fashions, and her heart is stuft with fraud as an usurers closset with parchment bonds. As in Logick there be Aristotelis Periherminias as well as his intricate questions, in the realitie of numerus , as in Ethicks his magna moralia as well as his Nichomacha , as in musick there is a diatessaron, as well as a paralambanominion ; as in Geometry there be oblique fines as well as right: an Isoperimetris as well as a dedocathedron, an Isosieles as well as an ambligonium , as in Retorick there be Schemes , and tropes , as well as pronuntiation: as in Grammer be Hetreroclitans , as well as perfect nownes; as in physick be the colon as well a the Arteries: as in Geographie there is a Terra incognita periwig'd over with Ptolemies Delphuego , as well as the know parts of the temperate Zone ; so in women there be false intentions as wel as false conceptions, the herb Moly hath a flowre as whit as snow, and a roote as black as Inke, so hath Clorinda a faire tongue as false heart, tout ce qui luit n' est pas or , all is not gold that glistereth, thou knowest not what bitter poyson I'le in sweet words, aux mots, & non aux mots, il faut juger d' le' home , a good archer is judged of by his aime, not his arrow, and a true friend knowne by performances not protestations. Toute chair n' est pas venaison all flesh is not venison, nor every tale true, straight trees have crooked rootes, smooth baites sharp hookes,  & a honied tongue a heart of gall, the fairer the stone be in the toades head, the more pestilent is the poyson in her bowels, and your Ladies talke the more it is seasoned with fine phrases the lesse it savoureth of true meaning, there is nothing more smooth then glasse, yet nothing more brittle, nothing more faire then snow yet nothing lesse firme, nothing more beautifull then a woman yet nothing more fickle. Flaminius breaking his long kept silence said, I shall never take joy of this life, if I may not enjoy her, for whose sake I joy principally to have life, but to what end is this supposition? if other women be brickle as glasses, my Clorinda stands a rock of Parian marble, firme and sure, the crystall shall be tainted, the Emerlin spotted, and rude feet shall profane the galaxia, Leda's windes shall forsake their orbes, or Serpentarius disert his small fry of twinikling starrs, or Lucidelyra detest her selfe of her refulgent beauty, or Bootes cease to drive on Charles wain, ere I'le harbour dishonourable thoughts of Clorinda , A Titan though curtained with clouds yet in time dissipates the congealed vapours, and gets the victory, and dissolves those vailes into thinnisse,  & so to nothing; so shall Clorinda these aspersions. Should you faigne the Elephant to chuse the Mouse for her companion (which all men know she feares) should you forge the Lyon to be delighted with the crowing of a cock, or the load stone to embrace Theamides , or the Bee to build in the tree Alpina, when no man is ignorant but she, (either suspecting it to be venemous, or misliking it because it is so gorgious) allwayes shuns it, who would extoll you for a naturalist that affirme things so unnaturall, more absurd is it to accuse Clorinda to become Helena , whom she excells as well in beauty as in chastitie. Now Flaminius (usher'd by affection, and attended on by feare) departed from him, and directed his steps towards Chelsey , in the way he met Bombar, Diaphoro's , brother, whom he (misinformed) looked upon with narrow eyes, because he esteemed him ready to enjoy the perfection of his desires. But when Flaminius heard how Uernar reviled him, and accused falsly his constant Clorinda , with very anger at his insolence his eyes waxed bloud shot, and his forehead was furrowed with so fearefull a frowne as all the beholders trembled at the terrible aspect of his bunched brow, which notwithstanding was but the shaddow of his hearts impatience, choller choaked up the mouth of his voyces organ, so as he was unable for a time, to render any reply, but as soone as he had recollected himselfe he sent him this defie, Jmpious Uernar , Though thou hast practised villanie from thy cradle, and suck't more mischiefe then milke from thy hated dug,  & hitherto scaped scot- free, yet now retaine a mortall chalenge from my arme, which glories to oppugne so foule a cause, I shall expect you in Hide Parke , as soon as the cleere Aurora be risen out of the armes of Titan that I may see what complection thy heart beares, and that thy body may be offer'd up for a breakefast to the Crowes by Your irreconsileable Antagonist FLAMINIUS . Uernar accepted the challenge and sent this retort, More ( Impious Flaminius ,) not dreading thy menaces I doubt not to carve thy body into steakes, and distribute it to the plumed spectators of thy tragedy, for the world shall sooner want adventures, then he courage to undertake them, who stiles himselfe, Your utter enemie UERNA A little before the time of combate, a Lady call'd the sage Artimaga came to Flaminius prophesied his victory, and presented him with a strong armour, more gorgeous then the Uulcan framed armour of Æ neas fetcht from the Cyclops forge, by the Pampian goddesse Cytherea , when she sought for her sons safegard from the fury of Rutilian Turnus , fighting for a Kingdome and his love Lavinia , this armour Clorinda beautified with Locks of her golden haire, which was fastned to his crest, and obumbrated his Corslet dangling downe in small braides, tied up in Lovers knotts with silver ribands, the armour was of a sea-green colour with rocks, and sands of gold, his device upon his sheild was the jmages of the chast and constant Penelope , and his Lady Clorinda in silver, with their hands joyned, his impresse was. Est vunum velle duobus. Clorinda and Penelope The colum's are of constancie. The colour of his horse was milke white, but upon his brest and croop he was dapled with red staines, as when a white Tulip is streakt with red, or a few strawberies scatterd in a messe of creame, he was fiery and of a goodly proportioned greatnesse, his hasty hoofes scorned the earth, and he sent proud challenges in his loud dialect to his enemie. Now Clorinda, Diaphoro and Delia, Grisonus, Bombar, Artimaga, Florian, Doristo , and others ushered Flaminius into the feild with this Song. Armes and honours deck thy story To thy fames immortall glory, Adverse fortune ever fly the, No disasterous fate come nigh the, Prosper still in martiall courses Prosper still in arts and forces, Bright victory Attend the nigh, Whilst spreading fame Resound thy name And Blason forth Thy mighty worth. Just Astr aea whom Poets say From wicked earth is fled away, And in the bandrike hast thy seate To make the Zadiack compleat, Once more from thy bright throne descend Thy owne stout Champion to defend, Sheild him from harme Strengthen his arme, Kind Mars come downe And his head crowne With wreaths of palme, Then myrh, and balme Sweet insence, with the Cypresse tree, And Cassia shall flame to the, And Th' Magpie, and the Woolfe which be Devoted to thy dietie, Ride on truths champion, and goe Assured thy haughty foe, Shall fall like Sparrowes 'fore a halke Thou ore his spoyles shalt boldy walke, Bright victory Attend the nigh, Whilst spreading fame Resound thy name And Blazon forth Thy mighty worth. Flaminius waited not long before Uernar appeared gallantly mounted upon a bay browne coursier, full of black spots, his forehead marked with a white starr, to which in his whole body there was not any part answerable but the left foot behind, his armour was rich and gorgious of a skie colour full of starrs of gold, he bore in his sheild the effigies of Cassandra the propheticall daughter of Priamus in silver, with this word Mentiri non est meum , Its not my part to lye. Flaminius (who affected not warr, but in Case of necessity, alwayes peace, but with honourable conditions) before he would extort from Uernar a forced confession of injurie done to Clorinda , he went about first like a flexanimous Oratour to exhort him to it, Should you Sir Uernar accuse Helena of falcifying her conjugall trust, it had been but to tell over a tale that is already told, this accusation had been warrantable by tradition, but to charge Clorinda with inconstancy, nay to think such a thought of her (whose beauty bewrays her to be Uenus , but that she excells her in chastitie, and whose continence speakes her to be Diana , but that she staines her beauty,) were intollerable impudence, to speake such a word flat impiety, and to affirme it with oathes inexpiable injury. Or had Nullifidius whom no man will credit reported this it had not been worth my answering, or her regarding, but that you Uernar who weare sometimes of her intimate acquaintance (being Deli'as friend) Though as it is now evident a dissembling Sycophant , for you to relate this, others beleeve it, she stomaches it, and I'le revenge it, I had better take a blister of a nettle, then a prick of a rose, I am more willing that a Raven should pick out my eyes, then a Turtle pick at them, to dye of the food one affecteth not is better then to surfet of that one delighteth in, I am of Scipi'os mind who had rather that Hanibal should eat his heart with salt then L aelius grieve it with discurtisie, or of the same with L aelius who chose rather to be slaine of the Spaniards then suspected of Scipio , I had rather an enemy should beate me, then a friend belye me, rather that an Antagonist should slay me, then one of acquaintance slander me. Uernar replyed, We come not hither to debate, but to combate, not to prate but to praeleate, not to cavill but to duel; not to jest but to just , wherefore (having turned their horses) these champions met so furiously, That their shiver'd l ances flew upwards, as if they challenged the skie before they falled on earth, never was game of death better playd, never did fury display it selfe in greater bravery, never were Hector and Achilles better imitated or rather excell'd, never were swords guided by more skilfull hands, never were hands accommodated with more trusty swords, which like deep mouth'd Cannons battering downe by peece meale their armours, made many wide breaches for troopes of wounds to rush in at, Heer's the Trojan warrs in Epitome , heer's the battell of Lepanto acted in Monomachy , heer's Yorke and Lancaster fought over again in a Hippomachy , heer's the Pharsalian feild discrib'd in these lists, heer's the fight at Canna excelled in a duell. Now the barriers blood began to chace sweat from the full possession of their outsides, for their armours blushed that they had defended their masters no better, force against force, prowesse against prowesse were interchangibly encounter'd, as the fire the more its fed with fuell the more hungry its still to devoure; so the more they did strike the more unsatisfied they were with striking; they sharpned their sharpe swords with hope of victory, their thick blowes lighting upon their well tempered shields, made the ayre to Eccho the noyse whereof sounded as many waters in their feirce combates against some concave rock, by this time Uernar's body was scarified and broch't with so many wounds as his soule was in a doubt which way to get out at, but weakned with a prodigall effusion of bloud (which he sent to bespeake him a grave) he fell to the earth, and feeling the prevayling point of Flaminius sword at his wretched throate, he upon his knees confessed himselfe vanquished, and Clorinda flandered, in these words. Redoubted Flaminius as fire is to gunpowder, so is ambition to the heart of man, which if it be touched with selfe-Love mounteth aloft, and never bendeth downeward, till it be turned into ashes, I confesse my selfe to be a man whose eyes could not looke right upon any others happines, nor eares beare the burthen of any others praises, I knowing that each corner in the world rang of your praises, mine fits no mans mouth, this consideration breeds antipatheticall difference, and discontent brought forth emulation, emulatio desire of reveng, that engendred execution, of such desires, to further this designe I had a further designe, I considered that you were to be joyned in nuptiall bonds, to the incomparable Lady Clorinda , (whose beauty is so excellent, and her feature agreable in every lineament, her modestie so decent, and vertue apparent, that she may be rightly stil'd the Ph aenix for beauty, and most famous among Ladyes for bounty) and I betroathed to the deformed Melena , (who bare upon a foule carkasse a fair and rich wardrope, (which she may be rather said to carry, then enjoy,) whose beauty is borrowed more from art then nature, (it being now the common practice among such decayed, and superannuated faces, banquerouted by time, or accidents, to hide it from others eyes with art,, and from their owne with false glasses) by her perswasion ( O Proles nefanda, cerebri nefarij O horrid conceipt of a wicked braine) by her instigation I did calumninate, as sasly as subtly the vertuous and chast Clorinda . Flaminius who was as mercifull as magnanimous, as vertuous as valiant, as pittifull as powerfull, granted him his life, but Vernar whose uncontrouled spirit disdained a life of almes, with his ponyard soone put an end to his owne dayes, over whom our conquerour triumphed. Soone after this Victory Amenides , brother to Clorinda returned from travell, and now this Hero of a refined wit and rectified judgement, and Flaminius were linked together with a Gordian knot of friendship a fraturnall claime of fidelitie, which neither time by degresse could impaire, nor suspitions infrienge, such a love it was, as was betweene Daman and Pythias , and Bylades & Onestes, Tytus and Gysippus, Theseus and Pyrithous, Scipio and L aelius . But Les peines importunes ne sont volontiers loing de plus hautes tunes , troublesome paines be not (commonly) remote from the most perspicuous fortunes. As the lives of men, so their prosperity, run not upon a Helirri that still enlargeth, but on a circle, which aving at the meridian, they decline in obscurity, and fall under the center againe. Il n'est de jour si clair qui n'ait quelque nuage , the most glorious sun risings are subject to shaddowings, and droppings in, the freshest colours soonest fadeth, the fairest flowers soonest withereth, the clearest day quickly clouds, black and white bee both commonly in one border, the sweetest rose is not without its sharpe pricks, nor the fairest velvet without its list, nor the most fortunate life without crosses, the Bee beares honey in her thigh, but she carries a sting in her taile, the deceitfull Panther before the destruction of his eye- gazers, doth hide his head, and prepose his delectate skin to the enticement of other beasts, the night is blackest a little before day, the winds stillest before a storme, the sun bleakest, hottest, before a shower, the deformed Porpisces before the comming of some outragious tepmest are pleasantly sporting before the seame and so did Lubricious fortune give Flaminius the forementioned victory, inventing to plunge him the deeper into misery, this fickle dietie resembles the sunne, who by his heate scorcheth the grasse of Pelion , which even now by his beames was vanished, she is like the monster Hylima , in a moment she can ( Proteus like) change her selfe and grow variable, now shee tooke a pride to act both parts of her lubricity, and to crosse Flaminius joyfulnesse with this joylesse accident. Soone after that time of the day when the highest mounted sun make shortest shadowes, Flaminius for his wonted recreation accompanied Amenides and Clorinda into a pleasant grove, which (through her presence) appeared like the sole Paradice of Silvanus , who had there planted many fragrant arbours for the recreating of his beauteous Clorinda , or the silent grove of Calisto , wherein the enamoured Jupiter in likenesse of a wood Nymph did sport with her, as they were here ambulatory there rushed in one of Flaminius Fathers servants, al perboil'd in sweat, with visage pale as death, and this was his message to Flaminius, (viz. ) That his mother Capricia was lately arrested by a violent fit of sicknesse at the suit of death, and being ready to pay the debt she ow'd to nature, desired that he might close her eyes, these sad tydings made Flaminius prepare,  Jam revocare gradum, patriasque evadere ad oras. To check his progresse, leave Albion strand And steere his course unto his native land. By this time these sad lovers have said that ill faring word, farwell; they husbanded their imbraces, as children doe their sweet-meates as being loath to devour them too soone. Flaminius accompanied with (his inseperable companion) Amenides tooke shipping to Dover , the Sea received them with a smooth, and smiling face, and Neptune who had now learnt to fawne on Princes, blest them with a happy transfretation, Capricia soone after the sight of her sonne in an extasis of joy expired, and Pompilius (unwilling to survive so loving a wife, and willing because the journey was darke, and melancholy to bear her copany to the Elizian groves) his heart began proudly to beat up the alarums of death, and hee also became a prey to the leane-chapt Monster. Now the triumphs intended for Flaminius arivall are turned into funeralls, now all eyes are glazed with teares striving to deluge deeper then Ducalions , now the universal torrent of pearly drops hath washt away al mirth from that sad, and lamentable world which is muffled up in the mourning cloakes of griefe, and confusion. Now the Honourable Senators and worthies of the gowne, are assembled to condole the maine engine of state Pompilius , whose approved whighty constancie, and integrity as cleare as the noone day hath cognomiz'd him the Atlas of the common wealth, and made him a fit subject unto these predicates, a plant, and planet of justice, a constellation of the former which hath eternized him a perpetuall memory to posterity, and hath stampt so deepe an impression, in the hearts of the surviving as no age should obliterate, hee did easily triumph over smarting rancor, and having run and posted over all the stages of his life, hath edificated a memorable statue, and trophie of his worth in the breasts of all to whom no testification, or Epitaph can bee more precious. Now the courtly Ladies and grave Matrons are congregated to bewaile the falling of this Cyprian starre Capricia from their Zenith, whose losse even heaven might lament, did not heaven enjoy her. Now the valiant Souldiers that might have daunted death himselfe when they wore the colours of this their disceased Vice-Roy in the field, with their drummes covered, pikes and teares trayled in a mournefull posture, launces broken, insignia and instruments of war reversed proclaime their griefes, now all sorts, the creame and the scumme of the people, not to fill their eyes but to employ them, and to invest themselves in black for him whose purple they once adored, our muse shall beare part in this lamentation, and sadly weepe out this Elegie. Hence, hence fond mirth, hence vaine deluding joyes, Glee and alacritie, you be but toyes, Goe gilded elves, love idle braine possesse With fickle fancies, thick and numberlesse, Sorrow the subject of my song shall be. My harpe shll chant my hearts anxietie, Pompilius the great, (who did appeare Arts Zodiack, valours Zenith, vertus Spheare) And sweet Capricia , (which all hearts did move, In whom fresh beauty, charity, and love Did claime a being) these ore all lands admir'd That Sol's bright circle warmes, are both expir'd, Thus the Didimies or twins did, whom fate To one another did conglutinate, Nature at one time both did animate, Both lives at one time did evaporate. Bright Car of Day, which dost ditunally Flame in the forehead of the azure skie, Blush to behold this sad, and helplesse hap, And hide thy head in Thetis eazy lap; Let thy coruscant thy translucent light Not make a difference twixt this day and night, Let this black day be from all annalls cut Nor in the reckoning of the yeare be put, Let gloomy shades upon it ever passe For to delucitate how fatall 'twas. Rapacious Skeleton , leave death (that cares not For wit or beauty) monster fell, (that spares not Honours) can nothing thy nice pallate please, (Grim sir) but such Ambrosian cates as these, So delicate a dish may pamper thee But make ten thousand pine, and pensive be, Yet since thou hast caught this choyce Ambrosia (Sweeter then Joves) we will weepe teares which may Be Nectar too, our losse shall satiate thee, And with our sad teares mayst thou drunken be. Your envious fates (that holds the vitall sheares And set upon the nine infolded Spheares Whirling the Adamantine spindle round On which the brittle lives of men are wound,) Since this blest paire are fallen, let them have An earthquake (at the least) to ope their grave. They are magnificently interr'd in the chiefest Temple in Naples , and over them is ingraven this Epitaph. Here lies a blessed paire, alive one bed Containd them both, and one grave being dead. Here lies interr'd the twins of fate, One was the Atlas of the State, His head the throne of Art, Of Pietie, his heart. Minos in furre, A friend of right Mavors in war, A devill in fight. I'th others lovely face Fresh beauty dwelt, and grace, An Angell cloath'd in flesh, and sent into a claie tenement She was, --- Reader admire this, and wish Thy selfe a worme to tast so choyce a dish . Having given the parents the rights of buriall let us returne to the children, and speake some thing of their Daughter Dionella , although some may conceive it impertinent to the History, yet they may find it no more repugnant, then in one nosegay to set two flowers, or in one counterfait diverse colours, yet to expect all passages and circumstances of their lives, were to loose ons longing, you may as well seeke Pauls steeple in Hondius his Map of the world, for abridgments, of Histories are nets of a larger wash, which onely inclose great fishes, ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  , things worth mentioning, the smaller fry, matters of lesse consequence, escape them, passing over therefore, and omitting all impertinent tautologies  & ambages, we shall proceed to relate, how. Amenides Clorinda's brother, an honourable slip of the antient tree of English nobility, a pregnant proficient in all discipline of state, of a sweet aspect, and comely forme and feature, of whom it may be justly spoken without Hyperbolies of fiction, as it was of Cato Uticensis that he seemed to be borne to that only which hee undertooke, Uersatilis ingenij (as Plutarch hath it) but to speake much of him were the way to leave out something that might adde to his praise, and to forget much that would augment his honour, in a word therefore he became enamoured of Dionella Flaminius his sister, a Lady that did cast upon her beholders so sweet a looke, as was able to raise one into a Galliard, that lay in a dead palsie, and to doat on that sweet countenance, but in that looke there raigned so divine a countenance, as cut off all lascivious and vaine hopes, her face was Queen vertues palace, adorned with natures choysest tapesterie; thatcht with golden hair, the windowes of his gorgious Court, cast forth more glorious beames then those wherewith rash trayn'd Phaeton sing'd the world, the rubie portalls boast in incomparable sweetnesse, for the fruition whereof a man would even enthrall and inhell himselfe, upon the sanguine and Lillie walls of this Paphian structure interlaced, and kindly mixed with Alabaster  & Uermilion where more Theoremes were livly portraitured then in whole volumnes tedious pariphrase, as her superlative beauty won the praise from all women that stood in degree of comparison with her, so her vertue was as amiable in mens judgements, as her feature in their eye sight, but to speak more of her were to take her lesse, only thus much, all faire Ladyes might breake their flattering glasses and dresse themselves in her. But let us leave her with Amenides happy in their reciprocall affection, and turne to Flaminius who (when he had digested his griefe) longed to returne to Clorinda , (with whom hee had left his heart for a pawne till he came back,) to this end he tooke shipping for England attended by Florian and Doristo . At first the disembling sea smiled on them, but before they had sayled three leagues the sweet tongued Syrens began to sing, and the delighted Dolphins , and gamesome Porpises to daunce to their musicke, and all on a suddaine, a sable cloud curtain'd the refulgent Lord of Light, the Seas were made a darke stage for a miserable Tragedy to bee acted upon, now proud Æ olus began (in a loud base) to sing destruction, now Neptune did Court and kisse Iris , and the traiterous Sea sweld it selfe into mountaines more high and hideous then the Alpes, on which the afflicted shippe as upon a promentory or starry pointed Piramid was carryed to invade heaven, to seeke safty there, being denyed it upon the Sea, but was straight darted downe againe into a precipice of hellish darkenesse, as if it chose rather to ride upon gentle Phlegeton , then this now unnavigable Ocean, the Sea strove with the winde which should bee lowdest, and the welkin (now all inveloped in ugly darknesse) contended with the Maine which should bee more horrid, The distressed vessell, was like a foot-ball tossed by the rude feete of a rusticke crew, here only proceeded that little of safety which it had, it was equally assailed on every side. All this time Flaminius sat with setled countenance discovering nothing that argued feare, hee Augustus like encouraged the pale Pilot with that sentence, Flaminium & Flaminit fortunam vehis ; how can that Vessell suffer ship-wrack that carries Flaminius , and his Fortune? The subject of his Meditations was the object of his love, Clorinda , a brighter Nymph then she that received a being from (his now angry enemy) the Sea, Toto sonuerunt aequore nimbi , the idle Compasse, the broken Rudder, and split Anchor were uselesse, the flapping mainsayle and shivered Mast were cast over- boord, the Sea-men were distracted, some ply'd the Pump, some their (till then neglected) Prayer-books.  Nihil hic, nisi pontus, & aer. Now no objects presented themselves to these abjects, but the raging Sea, and gloomy aire, neither had they a perfect prospect of them, but when cloud- compelling Jove held out to them a Torch of Lightning, till at last kind Aurora became a Harbinger of that ensuing day, which shewed them light to land at Cyprus , a rich and flourishing soyle, placed under a smiling Heaven, and sacred to Venus , to whom wee direct this Meeter: Great Queen of change and mutability, As false as faire, fickle Deity, Were't not a sin, I'de doubt what Poets sing, And boldly swear from th'sea thou didst not spring, But from some silent grove, or bower of blisses, Where Turtle-billing Lovers hide their kisses; Thou wert begot in some Love-covering shade, And not of glassie Thetis crispt froth made, For then the bold imperious surges might Have been control'd by thee, then hadst thou right, To quiet the proud billowes, and to chain In its prefixed bounds, the gadding maine, Which now contemnes thy idle blast, and roare For all thy threats, and rages more and more: Now stubborn Triton mounted on a Whale, Refus'd to hark to thy neglected call, And at thy slight commands he stoutly scorne, To sound retreating with his bugle Horne, Or give the flouds a signall to retire, But joyn'd Æ olus to swell them higher; Revenge this Cytherea , else who shall Adore, or let one graine of Incense fall Upon thy Altars, sacred Nymph arise, The Rebell-rout of Sea-gods to chastise, But legally, let Mercury be sent, To summon a celestiall Parliament, Exclude the common crew, deny the rude Fierce Hydra which we call the multitude, To sit with thee in Councell, or debate, To redresse grievances ith' Lovers state; Admit no vulgar gods, for they will be Like Tinkers, mending one hole they'l make three: Dispatch thy ayre-dividing Messenger With sealed Writs, and summon to appeare, Hymen, Thalassius , and Raucina too, The sacred Nuptiall Deities which doe Tye hearts in knots, and mutually twists In holy chaines, the soules of Amorists. The Quiver-bearing Wag, whose potent Bow Nor sex, nor age evades, nor high, nor low, The Goddesses so debonaire, and free Aglaia, Thalia, Euphrosyne, Esteem'd by men for their heart-easing mirth, Whom thou (faire Cytherea ) at one birth Bore to the Ivie-crowned God of Wine, Egeria , at whose adored shrine The youthfull teeming females doe implore The Goddesse ayde, to these and divers more Direct thy summons, when they all Be congregated at great Joves White-Hall: (Divinest Queen of Love) perswade them still, To grant thy just demands, and passe this Bill, That whereas hoary Thetis did not chaine, (According as she ought) the boyling Maine. But traiterously did joyne with Dione And Malicerba to disturbe the Sea, When he (whose fame shall drop from many a pen, When Heralds shall want coates to sell to men, Whose Armes and Arts his glorious name shall raise, Alike to wreathes of Pallas Oakes and Bayes) Did furrow the great deep, and gently glide Over the bubling face of th'hasty tide, Bound for Clorindas armes (that happy port, That true Elizium , Queen pleasures Court) So that Clorinda (a bright Nymph to whom We grant priority, being overcome By her rare feature, alas she misses Those enthusiastick raptures, Lovers blisses; It's this day ordered by the joynt consent, Of the sublime Ætheriall Parliament, That Phoebus (whom terrestialls doe Adore, and yearly pay a tribute to) For ten nights next ensuing shall not rest His drowsie head in Rebell Thetis brest, But in Clorinda's lap should we assigne A longer date, the Sun would never shine, We should have short dayes, Sol would never rise From her lap, but to gaze upon her eyes, And whereas Boreas did let loose his breath, And Æ olus threat nothing under death, And set the waves at variance with the skie, And made among the Flouds a mutiny: Its further order'd that for ten dayes the Fairy paire of jarring brothers cloysterd be, In slender Bottles; its decreed they both With th'Marine Deities shall take this Oath. From this time forward solemnly we vow To wait on sacred Lovers, whilst they plough The vast Gulphes back; it plainely shall appeare We will retreat, as glad to see them there; We will concurre in one, both Sea and Wind, To make their speedly passage safe, and kind. I Sea will smooth my buncht brow, and invite Their blessed eyes, to see how I delight To bear their weight, and joyntly with them prove Zealous adorer of the Queene of Love. And I the Wind (to storme forgotten quite) Will whisper new joyes to rich Amphitrite, And in so mild a breath Ile tell my Tale, As it shall onely fill their swelling sayle. And I the Sea, will boyle officiously To bring them to their harbours, whilst sad I Lament their absence, and dissolve to teares, And rather drowne my selfe then them with feares. This done (kind Cytherea ) now release The Winds, and grant to the relenting Seas Once more the ancient immunitie, The Lamp of Lights nocturnall Bed to be: Those acts by which fierce Juno did conspire Alcides bane, augmented, and swell'd higher His venerable name, which now shall last Till Time want sand to run, or Fame a blast; So make this tempest raysed by the Seas To ruine thy Flaminius , encrease His firme emolument (faire Queene of Loves) We doe conjure thee, by thy silver Doves, To be his Guardian, let his lasting glory Fill all men smouthes, and make the world a story. Finis Libri secundi. OF THE CYPRIAN Academy . Flaminius in a weather-beaten Ship, or rather the Carkasse of the Ship, or rather some few bones of the Carkasse, was driven upon the coasts of the Isle Cyprus , at the foot of a cacuminous Clift, whose steep-downe chalkie sides reverberating and beating back the rayes of the resplendent Sunne, by the beames reflection seemed to gild the Ocean with a new Ph aebean glister. Flaminius (with his trustie servants) sat upon the Clift, beholding the perjured waters of the Changeling Sea, and uttering these complaints; Ah unkind Nature, Queene of dissimilitudes, and vicissitudes, when wilt thou be glutted with the miseries of mortals? How unfortunate is the fate of man, to be subjugated under the yoake of so belluine and inhumane a stepdame? Thy gifts are onely temporarie, there is no stable happinesse in this circle of flesh, nor is it in the opticks of these eyes to behold permanent felicitie: Apres un peu de joye ou seut mieux la tristesse , a pound of griefe followes an ounce of joy: as the tree and the rinde groweth and sprouteth together, the one not subsisting without the other; so with man is care and anxietie ingendred, which as an inseparable evill Angell follows him in all his actions, as the shadow doth the body: Lieur & mallieur se suyvent tour a tour , good and evill follow one another. What were the lives of those Hero's, Alexander and Darius , who strove together which should be Cock of the Worlds Dunghill, but one continued perplexitie? If to day Mars smiled on one of them, he feared the amphibologicall successe of to morrow; for, Cela qu'un jour nous don e, un autre jour nous l'oste , what one day gives us, another takes away from us; so that a man can make himselfe sure of nothing without the power of his action (that is not wholly in his hands) for, Multa cadunt inter poculum, & labra , Chance is a Dicer; its vaine to put more confidence in this life then in one wind at Sea, but 'tis wisdome to have tackling readie for all vicissitudes of Fortune. The Mulberry tree (as Herbalists observe) is long in begetting and keeping its buds, but (the cold season being past) it shootes them all in one night; and Fortune, which sometimes is long in dandling her favourites, (the edge of her lubricious affection being abated) she diverts from them her benignitie, and converts it to their miserie. But we will omit the rest of his complaints, desiring rather to relate matter then words. Flaminius arose, intending to direct his wearie steps to the Regall Citie Nicosia , almost n the heart of the Island, in the territorie of Lapathia: the way was pleasurable, and the earth clad in her best apparell, which made the Island appeare to be the field of Ceres , the garden of Bacchus , the prime pastorage of Pan , and the richest beautie of Silvian ; the Wheat over-topt his head, the Vines over- lookt the Trees, the rank grasse justled with his knees, and the high-sprong Woods did threaten to invade the Clouds. He had not travailed farre, before he was set upon by a pack of Robbers, a rout of crazed fortunes, whose crackt estates did gape to be soldered up by any wealthy bootie; but valour respects not numbers: wherefore Flaminius (who esteemed few swords in a just defence able to resist many unjust assailers) commanded his trusty Squires, Florian & Doristo , (who had rather sacrifice their lives at their masters feet, then seek (by flying) a dishonourable safetie) to assist him, who like an enraged Lyon sent some arme-lesse, others leg-lesse, more head-lesse, but many life-lesse, to take up their comfortlesse Lodgings under the black mantle of endlesse night. Florian lent such a terrible blow to one of their Chiefetaines, (who with open mouth threatned his destruction) as slicing off both his tongue and chaps, before he had ended his babling, gave a period to his oration. Doristo struck at another in the same posture, and made his soule in a streame of clottered bloud, to sayle out at his mouth. Those that survived of this Rabble (seeing themselves over-matcht every way, and frustrated of hopes to resist any way) desisted, and Flaminius persisted on in his journey; but before he could reach the Citie Nicosia , it did advesperate, and the silent night with her pitchie Chariot had coursed over the face of the element, and he was forced to take the earth for his pillow, the wide fields being to him in stead of a Chamber, and the windie skies being a roofe to his blasted Lodging, and having the cold and humid vapours of Nocturna to accompanie the unwisht-for Bed of his repose: but as soone as he espyed the beautious Aurora had with Vermillion blushing cheekes forsaken the Saffron Couch of her age-wearied Lover, he continued his travaile through a most pleasant Valley; on the right hand stood a ridge of mountaines, whereof one surmounted the rest, and had mounted upon his top a Pyramid of Brasse; on the left hand was the Sea, bordered with continued hills, beset with varietie of fruits; the Champaine betweene was full of flowrie hillocks, not much over-topping their ranker valleyes, which were with Groves of Olive and Orange trees dispersedly adorned. At the end of this Paradise he entred into a solitarie desart, whose ornaments were uncouth Rocks; some eaten with age, others blasted with lightning, others bruised with thunder: no comfortable beame of pleasure shined here, no chearefull Sunne or Moone illuminated this palace of death with gladsome rayes; it was filled with deepe ditches, and soundlesse pits, which were inhabited by hoarse Frogs and croaking Toads; it was paved with bloud-drawing Thornes: about the middle of this wildernesse was a melancholy Cave, the black Domicill of the daughters of death; Flaminius passing by it, heard comming from it these lamentations, couched in a Medley, both for Verses and Tunes. When Phaeton fell from Sols bright Throne, And fail'd in's enterprise, How did his sisters him bemoane, And fill the ayre with cryes? Proud Pelope Wife, bold Niobe , (Her off-spring being slaine) 'Gainst stormes approach, O how doth she In Marble still complaine? What sorrow Orpheus did sustaine, When through th'infernall shade Thou, thy Euridice to obtaine, With Musick passage made. What madnesse did corrode thy brest, wofull Andromache? When Hector (being laid to rest) Thy lucklesse eyes did see. Astianax flung from a Tower, (The hope of Troy , and thee) O cursed act of a curst houre, what sorrow might this be? What griefe Jocasta haddest thou, To see Eteocles Ingaged by a fatall vow, To slay Polynices? Sad Dedalus , how small's thy ease, That saw thy daring Boy Baptize the vast Icarion Seas, And leave thee void of joy? What should I speak how Progue griev'd For her Spouse, spouse breach, tell Should I, how sad Anthony liv'd After Acteon fell. All this black Troop of dismall woes enumerated here, Are pleasures if compar'd with those which horally I beare. Had I more tongues my griefe to tell, Then Romans (loath to yeeld) In one Rome -wasting Battell fell, In lucklesse Canna's Field. Yet should I want an Idiome, Or dialect, to say My griefe in an idoneous tone, My tongue, ah welladay. The Tongues of Muses are too faint In Helicon that keep T'expresse the cause of my complaint, Come Muses with me weep. But why should I perplex the Nine with my griefe, when tis known, They finde enough (Ah) without mine, To relament their owne. The ancient Helicon they've left, Since their Antiomers Was of his wisht for life bereft, They've made one of my teares. I oft and oft did them invoke, But none of them reply'd, Their Harmony (alas) is broke Since their M aecenas dy'd. Come and approach, and attend to my cryes, you Hags and Hobgoblins, Register up and keep a catalogue of my teares, These archt walkes of midnight Groves will I never abandon, And Silvans shadowes, And shades that Clarida loves, Where silver buskin'd triping Nymphs were never affrighted, By harsh blows of the rude Axe from their hallowed haunt. Here Death keepeth his Court, Here pitchy horror inhabits, This is griefes free-hold, Here will I chuse to abide, Come and aproach dapper Elves, Satyrs rough, and cloven-heel'd Fawnes, Not trickt and frounc't up As in the fresh flowry May, But civill suted Kerchift in Winter attire, Draw neer Ile teach you how To weepe teares in parts. Sol retrogade with your fire breathing steeds, And shut my eyes up in eternall night, My soule have lost its Sun, my body needs No radient light. Sinke toth' infernall shade, and let thy rayes, Illuminate their foggy hemisphere, Give to th' Antipodes that share of dayes, Which I doe hate here. Acquaint them not with my anxiety, For then thy guilt carr will prove tedious, They'l fall a grieving too, and implore thee To returne to us. Kind Phoebus grant me what I postulate, But if you slight, and churlishly deny't, My teares my optick sence shall adumbrate, And so make a night. Larke Nor Thrush In no bush Shall tell his tale, Nor sweet Nightingale That on the bloomy spray, Carrols praises of fresh May, Come and inhabit this dim dale, Cuckow ever telling of one tale, Raven and Nyctimine , that love the darke. Come Steele-digesting Bird, come and draw neere You brood-devouring Kite, greedy Want, That under-mines, fierce Cormorant: Come Falcon, and Vulture too, With the predictious Crow, Jay that ever talke, Griping Goshawke, Keep companie With mee, Here. Antiomers, Apollo in the head, Mars in the hand, a Saint ith' heart, a man Who was the Magazine, or Vatican Oth' lib'rall Sciences, alas is dead. Earth-decking Flora , beauteous Lasse that use To purple the fresh ground with vernal Flowers That suck in the Nectarian honied showers, Thou that wear'st Flowrets of a thousand hues, Thou that the smooth shorne fields enamelest, And annuall wrapst the even shaven Plaine, In a mellifluous Rug of Flowers, daigne Propitiously to come at my request. Come bring with thee the well-attir'd Woodbine, The Lovers Pansie freakt with shining Jet, The tufted Crowtoe, glowing Violet, Ruddy Narcissus , and pale Gessamine. Bring the Faire Primrose (that forsaken dyes) The Daffadillies with cups fill'd with teares, All Amaranth's brood that Embroidery weares, To strew her Lawreat Hearse where my Love lyes. The Melody being ended, Flaminius desiring as well to satisfie his sight as his hearing, stept to the Cave, where he beheld the Querimonious Lady, in a garment of blacke Velvet, embroydered with silver, her haire was gathered up under a small cap, covered with feathers, and set thicke with Diamonds, which glittering about her head dazeled his sight, but it was little in respect of that lightning which came from her face. She was ravished with the rare feature of Flaminius , who doubtlesse had been as much taken with hers, had hee not been gained by another, but his soule was so fill'd with the most excellent perfection of Clorinda , that there was no place left for any other impression. After some Discourse, the Ladies offers and his desires became convertible, shee requested that which he most desired, which was to accompany her to the Court, and hee requested that which she was most ambitious to performe, which was, to informe him of the cause of her querulous Soliloquie, which she did in these words. Gentle Sir , though I am assidually used to complaints, yet were my heart contracted into tongue, I should bee deficient in declaring the unspeakablenesse of my ineffable griefe, and though I despaire to bring you any pastime, yet to passe the time, bee pleased to heare this Tragedy. There arrived at this Iland, Antiomers sonne to the Emperour of Germany , Knight, who was in peace sweet and humble, in War sterne and haughty, the East could not boast more pearles then he could vertues, the gentlenesse of his countenance, and the fircenesse of his courage seemed to be two contraries in the same subject, his heart was uncapable of feare in any danger, but tractable and easie in conversation; in a word Antiomers , a man under whose name is comprehended all Warlike vertue; loved no women but mee, that loved not any man but him; he never spake but of me, he never made any relation which he esteemed good, if I were not the subject thereof; nor did I thinke any time lost, but what I spent out of his company. It so fortuned that Silenus , brother to Lycidus , the young King of Cicilie , proclaimed a generall challenge against all Knights that should deny his Lady Adrias (daughter to the Great Turke) to bee the Paragon of the terrestiall Paradise; Fame proud to promulge this defie to all the world, graspt it betweene her teeth, and shaked it about, so that it came to Antiomers eares, who soon left Cyprus , and went to Cicilie , resolved to make him repent his brags, or to bury my honour with his owne body. I shall omit the circumstances of his Journey, and returne to Silenus , who hearing of Antiomers his approach entred the Field in an Armour of a Cornation colour all beset with Croslets of gold in a Field Azure, he bore upon his Shield the Picture of Adrias in silver, with the Seven Starres round about her, under her was engraven this Saphick.  Adrias splendet velut inter ignes, Luna minores.  As Cynthia among nights Fry, So Adrias shines resplendently. Antiomers had on a French Armour of an Ashie colour, which hid the sparkes of a lively fire, spotted with Flower-de-luces of Silver and Gold, his device was a Heart ty'd to a pillar in the middle of a Faggot kindled by me, my portraicture was all beset with Flowers, and just under my Simulachrie was inscribed in Greeke Characters these words, ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) sfgr; ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) [illeg.]  ( the best of Flowers ) his Feather was Gree-de-lieu and white, his Caparisons Gris-de-lieu, embroidered with Gold, set thicke with sparks of Diamonds. These two Champions in their careere darkned the ayre with the dust they raised, and struck the earth into an Ague with their Horses battering hoofes, Antiomers in the middle of his course met his Enemy like a Whirlewind, and fell upon him like a Tempest, they both sent the splinters of their Launces to digge Graves in the dust for their blood, which forthwith fill'd them, for there were many salliports cut in their Armours for their lives to issue out at; and death to enter in at. Silenus words and blowes were delivered so together, that it was  aenigmaticall whither enterprizing or prevailing went first, his energeticall strokes seemed as thunder, to his words lightning; but hee found no barren ground for this seed, for Antiomers (abhorring sterility) yeelded him his own with increase, which because he did not expect, hee was perplexed by it, and in this respect, though reason and amazement bee seldome joyned, yet here they were not dissentaneous, for the most reasonable spectators had good reason to be amazed at the unreasonable ferocity of the combatants, who both overwearied with fighting, fell prostrate to the earth, where Antiomers thus commun'd with himselfe. Can my courage faint remembring my Lady, or can any thing dismay me being in her favour, no the honour of her name (which I honour) hath call'd me to the Field, and her beauty is so perfect, as nothing shall be able to force me to flye. And now these Champions carried more by strength of affection then of body, by the cruelty of the second charge they wiped away the astonishmenr of the first, till at last they were both carried out of the Field, with more appearance of death then hope of life. As soon as I heard of the event of the fight, I went to visit him, he no sooner cast his dim eyes upon me, but his colour freshly revived in the pale cinders of his thin cheekes, and the old vermilian tincture began to plead a new possession of his severall mansions, but at length I saw the vermilian non-suited, and him pale and dead (though even in that condition lovely, as if death had taken that shape to make me enamoured of him) alive he surprised and suppressed envy with vertue, and dead honours accompanied him to the grave.  \------Quis talia fando. Explicet, aut possit lachrimis aequare dolorem; What tongues can chant my griefe, what blubbering Eyes, With weeping can my sorrow equalize. O cursed be the hand that kill'd, that kill'd him, cursed be his heart that had the heart to doe it, o yee just gods let most direfull, and haplesse happs, happen to that hatefull wretch that made me wretched by his death, o kind death lend my cheekes his palenesse, which boast more of these trickling drops of teares, then the Pactolian sand hills doe of their most gorgious glistering pearles left there, and forsaken by the ebbing billowes of the bubling waters, My teares shall raine upon his grave to make the gentle earth beare some Adonean, or rather Antiomerean flowre, which shall beare his name and memory. She would have uttered more circumstancies of the Tragedy, but she was forced to make their womb their tomb, and to bury them before she brought them forth, those other things which she intended should have had birth in her mouth dyed there, for her words were washt away by her teares which came dropping downe, like rayne in sun-shine, and hang upon her cheekes and lips, like drops upon cherries, which the dropping tree bedeweth, her swell'd eyes became her fortune, and made her teares comely. By this time they were come to the Court, where Arbella Daughter to Romulus King of Cyprus , (for so was the prementioned Lady nominated) brought him to the King, whose Sister Capricia (mentioned in the former part of this history) was wife to Pompilius viceroy of Naples, and Mother to Flaminius , so that the King quickly so dispersed the rayes of his grace upon his Nephew Flaminius , as he thought his court deficient, without this pregnant proficient of State, but let it be sufficient for the present that we have brought Flaminius to the court, and into the Kings favour, let us now returne to Clorinda , (disconsolate Clorinda ,) whom we have too long forgotten. In this time of Flaminius absence, and consequently of her infelicity (for how could she choose but languish in the absence of her best Physitian ) no carefull art, or art of carefullnesse was imployd in her adorning her selfe, she left all to neglected chance, which yet could no more impair her perfections, then a dye cast any way could loose its squarenesse. Still her love did burne lik a vestall fire, which with Flaminius memory, richer then all spices dispersed fragrant odours, round about her Love-fick soule, and did refresh it, when 'twas in the dumpes, and stuck fast in the quagmire of melancholy. She was seldom out of the company of Delia , whose presence would have diverted much griefe, had it been curable by company, yet she set as cheerefull a countenance upon it, as the sadnesse of her heart would permit, after he had been absent from her some considerable time, not having oportunity personally to kisse her hands; he sent this letter as his paper deputy to doe it for him. Sweet Princesse of my life. Some three monthes since I left the artificiall sea of teares (wept out of my dewy eyes, for the discease of my defunct parents,) and lanched out into the naturall sea bound for thy armes, (that haven of happinesse, that port of pleasure) but I was unhappily diverted by a disasterous tempest which for twelve dayes tost me too and fro upon the inraged Ocean, and then cast me upon the Isle of Cyprus , a Land enobled for its celebrated excellencies,) here I am in favour with the King, and in credit at the court, but the thorne amongst these Roses, is thy absence, my greatest evill, is the want of my most beloved good, thy honoured selfe, the life of my hopes, and the hope of my life, which I keep only for thy service, nor can I loose it better then for thy love, and if I should sorrow for the losse thereof, it would be rather in respect of thee then my selfe, and out of griefe I should have to see my end, before I have testified the begining of my service to thee. But my faire one, I (who live onely to dye for thee) I (who entertaine my selfe onely with Imaginations, and live onely with hopes of thy love) conjure thee by the radient lights of thy eyes, (the onely suns by whose rajes I am animated) that thou dost not pine thy selfe (whilst I remaine in this darknesse, wherein I enwrap my selfe, during thy absence,) for so thou mayst cut off thy owne time, but not abate (but augment) my troubles, rather manifest a princely magnanimity of mind, in conquering this griefe by the valour of thy patience, and continue to love still. Madam. Thy Immutable Uotary, and constant Servitour. Flaminius. Cyprus. Clorinda . having oft honoured this letter with most affectionate kisses, dispatcht the messenger, (which was Florian ) with this answer. My Lord, to overvalue me so far, as to love me without any merits that might induce you to it, yet I were ungratefully sordid, and sordidly ungratefull, if I should not teach my pen (which is guided by my heart) to affirme that the least scruple of your love is not lost, but highly prized, and returned to you in like measure, beleive it Sir I am more torne and pursued by feares, of and for you, then Act aeon was by his doggs, I see not but through your eyes, I live not but by your love, which is in eternall characters ingraven upon the Amethist of my heart, and though the starrs condemne us to this seperation, yet your name and representation shall be alwayes the dearest jewells of the life, of Your Clorinda. England. Having delivered this letter to Flaminius let us looke upon Arbella , who made her heart rasam tabulam: a white paper, longing to have Flaminius writ his love upon it, to this end she studied with great art to tie all those graces together, wherewith she accustomed to have her admirable beauty accompanied, for the glory she apprehended in captiving such a courage made her desire to seem faire, she would be seldome out of his company, hoping that if he were not taken with the inevitable strookes of her face, he should be constrained to yeild by her charming speech, and because she would move every stone, and leave no means unatempted, when she knew Flaminius (who was much delighted with the airey whistlings, and inarticulate susurrations of vegitables) to be walking in a tufted grove, adjoyning to the City, thether she repaired, and placing her selfe within a leavy labyrinth in the navil of this obscure inmost bowre, fitting upon a mossie couch of grassie turfs she utterd these words. Faire silver shafted Lad goe burne thy frivolous bow, and in imitation of Hercules in these waving woods erect thy pillars and write Nil plus vltra , my conquest is ended, what shall Flaminius remaine alwayes as free, as invincible? can it be that so much valour can be altogether unaccompanied with love? Flaminius (willing to convince her of her errour, in thinking him altogether without love, tooke a seat in an adjoyning arbour,  & made this protestation of his love to Clorinda . Loadstone of love, life of beauty, picture of formositie, flowre of comlinesse, Clorinda , believe that my affection is so perfect as it cannot be increased or diminished, since the first birth of it, but if it be capiable of augmentation, thy late letter was as bellows to kindle a new fire in my soule, which shall never be extinguished by averse starrs, or adverse fortune, know (sweet Mistris of my love, and life) and believe that it is the royall prerogative of a lover to be metamorphosed into the essence of the party loved, and so it fareth with me, whose heart is as faithfull to you as the needle to the north. First, shall fertile soyles render nothing but thornes to Coridon , (as a reward for his good seede,) or rivers (the emblems of gratitude) forget to repay their flouds to Neptune , or a trustie grayhound transforme himself to a pilfering Tygar, or vertue become vice, and beauty a blemish, before any goddess be made governesse of the cittadell of my heart besides thy selfe. Arbella seing her hopes frustrated returned to her fathers Court, where she found Lycidus King of Sicilie her beauty shined so bright that the amarous King was too weake to resist it, for although her minde was possessed with sorrow, & her body clad with mourning, & corrupuit ocutos fletu , and she loboured to hide her feature, and dim the lusture of her face, yet could not the excellent perfection wherewith she was inriched be defaced. Neither Lycidus Rhetorick, nor his friends perswasions could procure for him Arbella's good likeing, therefore he out of the atrocity of his spirit, seeing his love rewarded with loathing, returned home and raised an army to make at once a conquest, both of Arbella , and her fathers Kingdome, when he had almost covered the Sea with his potent Armado , and made a bridg of ships over the miditerranian Ocean, Lemuroc (a man of an arrogant mind, a fit hing for mischeife to turne upon, one that like the fellow that burnt the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, would get himselfe a name, though it were for doing mischeife, who was left by Lycidus in Cyprus under pretence to negociate the match, did patch the Lions skin with the Foxes taile, and thus he acted his part for his Masters advantage, he congregated, and seduced the rout, and scumd the mud and froth of the people, the fittest soyles for this grand incendiary to sow his seeds of rebellion, with this Gallemaufery of Plebeians (who having nothing to lose, no not the oppulency of a good disposition) were easily ingaged in his tumult) he marched to the regall palace in Nicosia , the Walls, Turrets, and Battlements were white marble, the windows of carved silverworke, enamelled with Indian pearle, glazed with Christall glasse. Lemuroc mounted upon a high scaffold made this insinuating Oration to his rebellious followers, among whom were some popular and discontented Lords. My Lords, Kings favour, that it is lockt up from you, you are of the Court but not of the Councel, hee is growne so excessive in the appetite of the Kings favour, and so excessive in the limitation of the Soveraigne aspect, that he alienates his Majesties grace from you, he hath intrinsicated the occult disposition of Romulus , and conformed his owne so exquisitely thereunto, that there is but one velle betweene them both. From hence ariseth that intire confidence, that Romulus who is jealous of all men else, is confident of him, nor doth hee hide any clandestine negotiation from him; and to say true he makes himselfe but like a Cipher to make this Figure the more in number. Ere-while you were honoured in the sight of your Prince, enjoy'd his delights, you were crusht with honour as with burdens, you required nothing but you obtained it, so that all men admired and desired your estates: but now a sable cloud hath obscured all these faire beames in one day, your Prince frownes, your glory departs like a dreame, and you the Atlasses who carried such heapes and mountaines of honours upon your shoulders, have your Exits with reproach. All eyes are attracted to, and fixed on this new light of Flaminius , all hearts are pinn'd upon his sleeve, all neckes buckled under his girdle; from his hand only you receive your most importunate dispatches, you hold your selves graced by his injunctions, if he daigne not to disdaine your Petitions, you are highly honoured; If he please to breake silence in your behalfe, you are greatly obliged, you diligently waite at his dores, and endure the churlishnesse of his Porters, and bribe them to be the first that may obtaine accesse to this adored Idoll, you all labour to faine the choisest amplifyings to encomionize him, and the greatest submission to flatter him, his strength makes you all weake, his soarings makes you flag your wings, and flye close to the earth, his golden feathers are of such vastnesse, that they spread like failes, and so becalme you all, that you want aire, and Sea-roome to raise your plumes, and taste the pleasures of your owne Elements. Hee is the Harpy which hath all eares lockt to his sound, you are but as Fidles unstrung; he among you that hath Flaminius for his Protector, neede not bend all his nerves to acquire dignities; he that hath him for his foe languisheth under disgrace, and misery. None can obtaine any elevation without his ben e placet , neither can any without his leave preserve himselfe with innocence and vertue. You may say of Flaminius as Tiberius Subjects did of Seianus, ut quisque Seiano intimus ita ad C aesaris amicitiam validus: contra incensus esset metu ac sordibus conflictebantur . Hee hath even chang'd the nature of your Prince, and made him Saturnine and supercilious, who was once as debonaire and infastidious as Augustus of whom it was said, Augustus civile rebatur misceri voluptatibus vulgi , hee was a Prince, yet seemed a Citizen, and disdained not to beare a part in popular recreations. Will you run with so much patience to the infringing of your liberties, and throw your selfe headlong into the gulfe of servitude. Remove the cause of these grievances, and the effect will cease, take Flaminius from about the King, and the day of his benignity will daun upon you. Or if a quiet and peaceable Prince, and a prosperous Republiqne bee your summa bona , adh aere to my Royall Lord and Master Lycidus , and hope by his assistance to attaine the Apex of felicity, the top of your desires. Flaminius having assembled a troop of loyall Courtiers with them, went to appease the multitude, nothing fearing forreigne incursions, if hee could prevent home-bred insurrections, he therefore (who fought as if hee had beene suckled by Bellona , and never singerd ought but a Lance, and who spoke as if hee had beene foster'd by Minerva , and never handled any thing but a pen; hee who shared as much of Mercury in his tongue, as Mars in his hand) began thus,  O scelus, o veterum proles vesana Gigantum. What? are Romulus his Subjects become Authors of a ryot, and actors of their owne tragedy? What, have you combined Phoenix-like to let out your owne life blood? What, will you imitate the Viper, and teare, and dilacerate the entralls of your owne great parent your Countrey? and are Plitus, Xanverde, Turpill and others of the gowne that should be participes curarum , companions in care to your Royall Soveraigne; you that should be co-props of the State, you that should beare part of the burthen with yonr Prince, are you confederated against him? you are advanced to as high a pitch of Supremacy as subjection will permit, or Soveraignty endure, and yet will you still aspire, till you expire? Are you so transported with a desire to raign, that all your potency seemes villinage so long as you must acknowledge any Superiour? were there a resurrection of your Ancestors, they would blush at your insolence, and runne to kisse their graves that have hidden them from beholding such Rebellion, were your Fathers now to dye againe, they would every one bequeath as a legacie to his sonne that grave and laudable precept,  Nec tibi regnandi veniat tam dira Cupido. But looke before you leape, consider the Person you conspire against, is the Majesty of Romulus , who by coelestiall institution is the terrestiall Deity, its Romulus the Father of your Countrey, the fountain of honour, a man beyond all commendation, of a grave spirit, of a constant and well-setled judgement, so that if all the rancour and malice in the world were contracted into one eye, it should never detract from him, he is a professed Guardian to the Muses and their refined fancies, hee is accute in witt, grave in censure, mature in judgement, and in all the liberall Sciences so frequent, and beyond compare perfect, that they rather appeare innate to him, then acquired by education. The Arts Court him to be called their Oracle, as if hee only had beene borne to uncloud whatsoever is included in their spacious Orbs, he holds a Dormant Councel-table in his own Princely breast, the whole current of his dispensations speake him a patterne to the admiration and imitation of posterity. He is the prop, the Atlas on which the safety of you all leane, he is the hinge on which the whole State turnes; in a word, he is the Pelops for wisedome, the Minos for good government. Remember Amour & Royalte ne veulent point o' esgall , Love and Lordship suffer no fellowship. Forget not that Soveraigne authority is so delicate and tender, that it will take hurt with the least rude handling. Nor doe enterprizes against Princes prosper, remember that Seianus that contrived the death of Drusus, Litia that consented to it, Endemus that compounded the drug, and Ligdus the Ganimed that presented it, all perished miserably, and so let those furies all of them perish that undertake against the lives and prosperity of their Princes. But will you that have seene many yeares of Sunshine dayes, and beene the happiest Nation upon the surface of the Universe, as if felicity had been calculated onely for your Meridian; will you make your Island the seate of warre, and stage of woe, and banish prosperity from your confines? doe you long to see your Babes brought forth for the sword to glut upon? to see the bodies of your Ancients made pavements to walke upon, your Matrons become a prey, and prize to every ravisher, your Priests and Sacrificers slaine at the gates of your Temples,  Quae tantum insanas voluit, dementia gentes? And you Mushromes, you lesser starres, that come not within any Constellation, will you joyne with them that quo rure, quaque injuria invade your Countrey, you should rather joyne hand in hand to shoulder them out, who will use you but as instruments to ruine one another: you doe but shoote arrowes against the Sun which will retrograde, and fall upon your owne heads: but if you be resolved to contribute to your owne destruction, I dispaire not to find some who are not such fickle and desultory temporizers as will concur in this rebellion against their King, but will never doe that which most of his Subjects doe, flatter him, but who will doe that which few of his Subjects do, love and honour him, and let these joyn with me in this acclamation, Vivat Rex, Vivat Romulus, Vivat Rex Romulus, in Eternum vivat . Whilst thus he spake, conticu ere omnes intentaq; tenebant . Flaminius had such action in his speech, and grace in his action, as he raised attention with no less admiration then silence. For his Oration carried smoothnesse and concinuity enough with it to make many revolt from Lemuroc , only some few ambitious Lords, whether out of instigation, or as it hath beene conjectured out of emulation, and jealousie to bee eclipsed and over-shadowed by the fame and splendor of Flaminius , swaid their Tennants and domesticke retenews, and fled to Lycidus (who by this time was intrenched in the plaine of Mamrash some five miles from Nicosia ) under whose ensigne wee will resigne them, and assigne our stile to the perfecting of our former designs. Flaminius dispatched a Messenger to Amenides (whom hee desired might joyne with him in his atchievements, and partake of his glory) who soon left Dionella , of whom hee tooke leave with teares in his eyes, she also contributing hers unto their griefe, hee went accompanied with the same sorrow which hee left behind, and in ten dayes space arrived at Cyprus , with 1000. valiant Neopolitans , whose spangled plumes of divers coloured feathers obumbrating their steely crests, and their gilded helmets, shewed in semblance like Mars his burganets overshadowed with the golden tressalines of his faire paphian paramoure; If unknown Chor aebus with his troops of undaunted Ueterans were in Troyes extreamity, welcome to the distressed Priamus , or the resolved bands of Achilles with his fierce Mirmidons acceptable to the Grecians in the time of intestine skirmishes; how joyful then was Romulus at the arrivall of Amenides in this time of disaster, wherein hee more needed his Heroicke actions, then either Priam or the Grecian Heroes did their profered succouring aiders. By this time the Governours of the several Provinces (having fortisied their Cities) repaired with their bands to Nicosia , where there was a general muster of Romulus his souldiers wch amounted to the number of 40000. the day of battel between the two Armies was appointed on the morrow, and the Plains whereon it was to be fought were the prementioned Plaines of Mamrash . As soone as the Coelestiall Waggoner had forsaken the watry lap of Thetis , and issuing out at the latticed portalls of the Eastern Ocean had swiftly followed the flying darknesse (which with sable wings had tane her speedy flight to the Westerne India) the thundring drumms and shrill trumpets proclaimed the battles approach. Romulus his Army was thus ordered; against the approch of his reproachfull enemies; the first Squadron was conducted by Yeslin Governour of the Province of Salamina , the second was given in charge to Amenides , the third was led by Flaminius , the fourth by Romulus the King, the last by Pruteus . This Army garnished with their discoloured plumes, raised such a lustre by the rayes of the earths illustrator, as heaven it selfe seemed to blush at the gorgeousnesse of the inriched earth, whose duskie face was so admirably garnished with such a glorious Army. Lycidus also divided his Army which consisted of 60000. men into divers squadrons, allowing to each squadron 10000. men, the first was carried on by Lemuroc , the second followed Turpill , the third Xanverde , the fourth was under Lycidus owne conduct, the fifth had his Brother Silenus for its Leader, the last was commanded by Plitus . The signall of the battell being given, the two bodies engaged; and the earth loath to behold such cruelty, hidde its face under a bloody mantle. Now the noise of the Souldiers (wch was no lesse then the mad Sacrifices of Bacchus in Thebes and Phrygia , were wont to bee the neighing of horses, the clashing of the Armes, the groanes of the dying and wounded men, the obstrepency of the Canons and sounding granadoes drowned one another, and concurrd to make a discord, which at once both fed  & frighted death. Now Charon sweated with plying his Ores, now Cerberus feared to admit so many of Romulus rebellious Subjects, because hee doubted (they were so inured to insurrections) that they would mutiny against Pluto . Now Radaman thus trembled to give censure against so many souldiers, lest they (disliking their doome) should make another riot, and breake the peace. But because I would not- have the battle ended before I have described the manner of it, I will leave roaving at Generalls, and particularize some of the most eminent Combitants. Flaminius (having valour for his leader, and fortune for his Auxiliar) delt downe right blowes (and them oft redoubled) upon his unabiding adversaries, his blood-bedabled sword guided by his ruthlesse hand cleft where it strucke, it cut out more worke for the Sexton then the Surgeon, it made no wounds but mortall ones, it left every one on whome it had discharged its fury either dying or dead. Here his frantick arme cleave horse and man insunader at one blow, there it makes an Orphan, here widdow, and so he remained pressing, and oppressing his enemies till being ringd about with the distracted and amazed multitude his steed was slaine by Turpil but Flaminius so executed his vigorous rage upon him, as he made the Traitor to late repent his but lately offerd injury, for burying his blade in his cursed stomach he made him (belching out his life together with his blood, bid a sorrowful farewell, to his more then sorrowfull souldiers, and he soon mounted himselfe on a fiery coursier, whose masters head he paid for his horse hire. Undanted Romulus also, who chose rather to trust to his body a castle of bones, then one of stones, no sooner delt blowes, then these gave wounds, and those wounds, death, till at length his force decreasing, he was dismounted yet defended himselfe on foot till at last he espied, Flaminius coming, and then (whereas before he expected a noble death) he hoped for a glorious victory, for who can feare that hath Flaminius by him, whose very presence might apall his proudest foe, but how many he slew, (not stranger for number, then for the manner,) how he sent them to their deserved deaths, were a subject delectable to mee to write, and to all to read, but I should be over tedious to discourse of every particular. Plitus advanced himselfe against Amenides , whose actions speak him higher then our Epithites, but the burnt child dreads the fire, the baited Beare will beware of the stake, the singed gnat dare not again flutter about the flame of the candle, the fish Sphyrana once intangled will shun the net, the dogs of Æ gypt once terrified by the Crocadile wil seldom after lap at the banks of Nilus , and Pusillanimous Plitus having received two wounds sought by the swiftnesse of his horse a dishonourable safety, Lemuroc took his place and incountered Amenides , and it fared with him as with the young wrestler that came to the Olympick games, who having had a foyle thought scorn to retreat till he received a fall, or him that being prickt in the finger by a bramble, thrust in his whole hand among the thorns for madnesse, for having diverse wounds and not liking them, he left not, till he took that which was immedicable,  & Amenides continued purpling the grasse with blood and inriching the ground with pale carkasses. Pruteus ran against Lycidus , and bearing him quite over his saddle, he made him take a new  & more uneasy seat upon the croop of his palfrey, Yeslin and Silenus were so forward in the careere, as the very earth seemed scarcely to bend under their horses hoofes, with such exceeding celeritie they passed to the encounter, but  o the impartiality of the fates, o the atrocity of chance, The well accomplished Socrates and just Phocian were executed like Traitors, whilst Rebell C aesar was advanced, the cruell Severus lived prosperously and was adored, whilest the excellent Severus was miserably murthered, Sylla and Marius dyed in their beds, Pompy and Cicero slaine, when they would have thought exile a happinesse, and Yeslin, Loyall Yeslin , fell by the flesh-devouring hand of Silenus , but his bloud being scattered like seed upon the ground, brought rich encrease to Romulus , for his death gave desire to the most pittifull, and power of revenge to the most cowardly, and now between both armies began a most bitter bickring, but Lycidus his army being not able any longer to continue the conflict were inforced to flie, feare added spurs to their hast, Flaminius and Amenides added fury to valour, and desperateneffe to fury, and pursued them with their Squadrons, and prosecuted the pursuit as far as Ceratina erected by Cyprus (now called Cerines ) whose perfidious governour Dromus surrendred it to Lycidus, Flaminius and Amenides , sat downe before this City, where we will leave them and looke over the plaines of Mamrash . Here stood a head strong steed wanting nothing but a proud rider to guide him, there another drags his Lim-lopt Master up and downe the feild, the plaines which were never before overfloud, are now drowned in bloud, here lies a headlesse body, there a Limme newly discinded from that miserable trunk that lyes yet groaning, here lies a gasping head cropt from its shoulders, there lye huge heapes of half dead bodies, whereof some curse fate, others blaspheme their misdisposed starrs, one pitties his poore widdow, another commiserated his Lucklesse Orphans, and curse the night wherein the children were borne, because he must dye and leave them unhappy, here lies a throng of livelesse carcases, whose eyes are dam'd up with bloud-congealed dust, there grovells the Son whose hopes were all his aged Fathers pleasure, there were slaine in this battell (as is evident by the bills given in of the dead) of Romulus party 500. whereof one was the honourable Lord Yeslin . Of Lycidus souldiers there fell 11000 and upward, among whom were Turpil and Xanverde of the nobilitie. Report carying the fame of these wars tied unto his wings, brought it to Clorinda , wherupon (education having given her more languages, then nature tongues) shee drew her thoughts into these lines, adorned them with Roman attire, wrapt them in paper,  & dispatcht them to Flaminius .  Pax tibi tuta venit (comptos redimita capillos) Nunc fulgent violae, Lilia flava, rosae. Massica pampinei florescunt dona Liaei Nunc vocat ad dalces tibia grata choros. Pace virente, casas habitat securus Amyntas Neve citat tutum hunc tristis ad arma tuba. At cum trita patent furibundi limina belli, Turnus & armiferas aptat ad arma manus, Aspicis undantes effuso sanguine campos Si venit in terras martia turba tuas. Exurit passim segites, magalia, villas, Martiaq; artifici fulmina nube ruunt. Pace repertus amor, Mars spirat naribus ignem, Hic terram tumulis sarcinat, illa viris. Magnificis Pacem quis te non laudibus ornat, Ipsa Ceres, te nox induit, Ipsa Uenus. Clorinda.  Arbella loath any longer to see her Fathers Kingdome sustaine the miseries of war for her sake) fled secretly from the Court in a disguise, and apparralled her selfe in a tawney armor, having for her device an Anstridge holding a horse shoe in his mouth, with this word Sic nutriuntur Fortes , she repaired to the camp and sent this defie to Lycidus . Redoubted Lycidus it's both repugnant to your honour and honesty, to seeke to conquer that with Mars his lance, which can be subdued onely by Cupids shaft I meane Arbellas heart, appeare therefore in the field forthwith armed at all points to prove by what right you seeke the daughters love by the distruction of her Fathers Kingdome, be not inquisitive of my name but let it suffice you to know that I am Arbellas friend and consequently your enemy. The stranger had no sooner veiwed the advantages of the ground, but Lycidus forthwith issued out of the Abby (which was by this time straightned for want of Provision) with an armour of a sea green colour whereon was the Simulachres of Priamus and Hecuba hanging their heads in their bosomes, and with their naked hands upholding a deaths head, whereon was written this composure, Nostr ae spes tanta salutis , The stranger faild in his careere, and was sent to write his foyle with his helmet upon the dust, Lycidus (as rich in courtisie as courage) counting conquest by advantages rather stolen then accheived, left his sturdy steed to fight on foot, but Lycidus perceiving the stranger discovered more anger then either skill or strength, holding him farre unworthy of his hate, pittied his weaknesse, and said, Sir Knight, I conceive you fitter to masque with Uenus then march with Mars , to hold a distaffe with Hercules , then a lance with Hanibal , or to handle a Lute in a Ladyes chamber, then a spear in Bellona's Camp, contest therefore no more, but husband your strength, employ it against your enemie, for my part I am your friend and will spend my life to serve you for Arbellas sake, whose friend you professe your selfe, the stranger replyed al the service I desire of you, is; that I have no service for you, but abused courtesie, in Lycidus begat wrath who united all his force,  & cleft the perfidious Helmet of the stranger which struck him to the ground, he the thrust his glittering sword into his left side & having unloosed his helmet (intending to crop him shorter by the head) espyed golden tramells of faire haire, falling downe upon her shoulders, which witnessed that it was the beautious Arbella , whose corall lips trembled as if they were kissing death, the Lillie and rose which were before united in her cheekes now broake their league, and commenced warr, the Lillie got the victory, and remained master of the feild, and put the rose to flight, in her forehead where the wound was made a fresh torrent of rubie blood (whose least drop might have ransomed Cupid , were he taken prisoner) strove to over flow its owne fairenesse, here the rose tooke sanctuary being expulsed from her cheekes, in a word here was an Island of perfect white invironed with a red sea, in whose deadly streame death came sayling, and arived at the port made in her front, and soon chaced the soule, though not the beauty from her lovely body. Now Lycidus (ashamed of his unluckie victory broke his sword, threw downe his gauntlet, and in three dayes shipt his whole army to returne to Sicilie , he bequeathed his kingdome to his brother Silenus , and spent the residue of his discontented life, in the Monastery of mount Serat , where he became a Capouchin , His majestie out of the height of benignity passed a bill of indempnity,  & pardoned his subjects, & as a legg broke well set is stronger then before, and as a bow cract and wel mended sounder then ever, so his peoples hearts were in the most corroborated chaines of love and obedience chained him by this singular example of clemecie for Le pardonner n'est moindre vertu aux grauds quand 'lissont offencez, que le vengeance vice aux petits quand ils sont injuriez , to forgive is no lesse vertue in Princes, when they are offended, then revenge is a vice in the common sort, when they are wronged, but to proceed, because his maiesty would not have the griefe for Arbella's , death make a full conquest of his great minde, he admitted of this pastorall Eclogue . The Kings magistie being seated, and the roome fill'd with spectators of quality, Flaminius and Amenides , enter'd in a rurall disguise, intending to summon their senses, to attend their pastimes, to shew their alacritie, for the new established peace, and celebrate their Ladies excellencies, under the pastorall names of Julietta , & Floretta , calling themselves Archus , and Plaindor, Archus (which was Flaminius) disguised began thus . Come swaine assume thy slighted pipe, and play Upon thy oaten reed a rounde-lay, Come warble amorous anthems, call to be Partakers in thy mirth the Nap aeae , That haunt arousted groves, those rurall powers That live jnshrin'd in oaken curled bowres, Among the sapplins tall, whose shady roof Are ringletts knitt of branching elm, star proofe, Call Naiades from their obscure sluse By which his Alpheus met his Arethuse , Call mountaine Orcades for to comply To further with us this solemnity, Call the thrice three sweet Aganipian Nymphs That steeps the fancy in Helitonian lymphs Of eloquence, and straines heroicall To help us tune our dulcid madrigall. Avaunt thou Styx borne sadnesse, I'le take care Thou shalt be mist no more, the shaddow's are I'th deep of night, when Morpheus Leaden key Locks mortalls under a black canopie, Rejoyce, and Joc aean sing to me Now Janus folding gates close boulted be, Sicilian tyrants are returned home Mars is appeased with a hecatombe. The tempest's ore, the Cyprian ocean's calme, Our victors browes are crown'd with wreaths of palme. For Monuments we've hung up brused armes, To pleasuers we've converted stern alarms And dreadfull marches to delightfull greetings, And harnest squadrons into merry meetings. Grim Visag'd war hath smooth'd his brow, in stead Of mounting of a fiery barbed steed. To fright pale foes, now all in a qualme He capes in a Ladyes Amphithalme . Bends all his nerves, and every meanes he'l prove To the lacivious pleasing of his love. No more the fruitfull name of Cuirassier Shall scare our swaines, or fleet Harquebusier. We shall dispute no more what Cavallrie Or ammunition meane, or Infantrie The Pouldron and Vambrace, the casque the sheare The flankes both right and left, the front, the reere Are Exotick words whose very sound Shall be no more heard in Cyprian ground. Nor ranck, nor file, lesse when we go a maying All in a row, or when we be a playng At Course a Parke, or telling of a tale To the Ranck't Lasses at a Whitson ale. I ne're shall see a sword, but such as grow Upon a flitch of Bacon, never know An other pike but such as daily glides Along the softly whistling riv'lets sides And by Meanders rushie frienged bank, Where growes the willow greene, and Osier dank I neere shall Loricate, or imbrace armes But such as are Floretta's voyce of harmes. No shield but that of sinowie brawn we'le beare Turne thou thy blade to knives great warrier To subdue Geese, and Capons, and carouse Healths in thy close hilt in a frolick bouse. To Tabers change thy drum, to kitts thy fife Let Bagpipes and shrill Harpsicons be rife, Come change thy trumpet and Bellona's flute To the loud Cimballs, Violl, Harpe and Lute, Whilst in this piping time, these Halcion dayes We doe contest who best their Loves can praise. Hark Plaindor then how I anatomize My Julietta, and her encomionize. Were all the goddesses compos'd in one They would come short of her perfection. Gray headed morne blush to see her more bright Then th'eye of Moone, or her excelled Light. The dangling Tramells of her curious haire Then fine faire flax, are far more small and faire. Those golden threds in an even order set Entangle hearts, like fishes in a net. Her front is the perfection of delight The downe of Uenus doves is not so white. What covert charmes, what latent magick lies Within the circles of her speaking eyes. Beames shot from heaven like to a fiery dart Transfixt my soule, and scorcht my ravisht heart When peerlesse beauty did her cheekes compose Th'ingredients were the Lillie, and fresh rose. They are like a plum which blush (the sole cause is) 'Cause Ph aebus now and then doth steale a kisse. Her straight nose, dimpled chin, incirled eares A snowy sute, or Ivory mantle weares. The porphier portalls of her honour'd words A relish most mellifluous affords. From these Jemms clad in rubie livery I cul fresh balme to heale loves malady Her teeth like orient pearle or ivory be Or like the new borne blossomes on a tree. Her thrice celestiall voyce which blesse our eares Proclames its consanguinitie with th'spheres. Her neck more comely then the polish't towre Whose walles Jove skal'd in a Tagean showre Her armes in hue heavens milkie zone surpasse Or white Æ quoreall Neptunes fomie face. Her lovely armes are like prest curds, there stand Ledas pale Swan immewr'd in either hand. Now Muse returne into the milkie way Where Cupid (in a sweat) abathing lay About this beautious dale on either hand Loves Alpes and Uenus Pireney mountaines stand, With Azure curles each is inammel'd round And with a soft red Porphier berrie crownd. These are two Apples tane from Paradise The graces use to sport in wanton wise Under their shades Pomena's ripe fruit fall From lofty trees mov'd by no wind at all. To doe them homage, Cupid sucks from hence His sunshine dayes and love his influence. Greece borne and banisht love seeking to find A domicil where he might sit inshrin'd Parching himselfe in Juliettas eyes Intended in her heart to signorize But finding that too cold for's resience He tooke his flight to my close heart from thence, Where with some firebrands, which himselfe did lay He sing'd his wings and must for ever stay. Her brest a feild of Lillies whiter shewing Then those Alcinons in thy Garden growing. Faire Erycina's Ida next to that Or Athos stand, or Cupids Ararat. Beneath this lies loves mediterranean The gulfe of Venice leading to th'Ile of Man . To praise the Coloums of this structure, this Adored bulke, this amorous edifice Were a fit theame for the elaborate lines Of ever honour'd Maro, whose worth shines Bright in the lampe of poesie, and raise As many trumps as men to chant his prayse. In softnesse they the silke wormes web surpasse Woven in leavy shop, on Loomes of grasse. In whitenes Albian clifts, in smoothnes the Repumicated glasse of Normandy . Her round small feet beneath her roab doe run Now out, now in, as if they feard the sun. Floretta has for Dioni aea power To make each place she comes in Cupids bowre. Nature did summon every grace to meet. At the composure of a saint so sweet; And with more beauties they did her invest Then Cabalinean Poets have exprest I'th comely Aspect of the Paphian Queene Or more then in Corinnas face was seene. My Love a quarrie is, or Cabinet Where beautious nature her choyce gemmes hath set. Her amber locks shine like the Topace bright, Or golden Carbuncle , or Chrysolite Her eyes at each glance rutilate and sparke Like Diamonds in murke, tenebrous darke: Her faire infolded eares, high front, nose, chin Resemble the hate-spot Emerlin . Argent and Gules in her cheekes kindly mix As in the particolour'd Jasponix . The orifice, or ports of her words are In colour Corall, in worth Cinoper . Her pearle like teeth are an even placed row Of occidentall Margarites which grow In her fresh Rubie gumms, her round soft brests Where Cydias pigions fanbricate their nests Are Alabaster circumstructures, one Loves Ossa is, the other Pelion . Warme azure vaines (by prudent Natures skill) Inamell and inviron either hill, Streames of dissolved Jazul , circling founts Of liquid Turkise in these lovely mounts Make many pretty Islands, which appeare Some Ovall, some in figure of a Spheare. Her hands those gemms of love Antimonie Her digits nayles Arabian Oynx be. She's a chast Emerauld , and that this list Might perfect be, her hearts's an Amethist . Not stubborne and obdurate, but a heart Soone penetrated with loves wanton dart. Nor can the buckets of our rustick quire Quench this Asbeston flaming with Loves fire. The harmonie of lovelinesse and grace Combineth in the magique of her face.
