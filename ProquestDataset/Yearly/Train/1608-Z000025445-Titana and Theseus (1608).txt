 I hope your Worship will excuse my slender skill, and except of my willing minde, and when you haue giuen them a fauourable view, with Minerua vnder your golden Target couer a deformed Owle, so hoping for more then yet I haue deserued, I rest: wishing you the happie successe of harts content, where I leaue you to the Heauens disposing. Your Worships most dutifull and euer bounden W. Bettie. In Greece , there dwelt a mightie King, called Aegeus , who had raigned fiftie yeares; fortunate, and successiue in all his warlike affaires: that through the puissance of his force to his foes, and bountifull curtisie, to his friends; he was feared in hate, and imbraced in loue. This Aegeus had one onely Sonne, whose name was Theseus , who was by birth Royall, learned by educatien, by Nature valorous, and by Uertues famous: in so much that it was hard to iudge whether his Ualour, Fortune, or Uertue, wonne the greatest praise. This young Prince, being so richly adorned with the rare feats, and accomplishments of Chiualrie, that he did not only enioy his Fathers loue, but also wonne his Subiects harts: at that instant, there liued Meleagar , King of Acchaia , not farre distant from the Court of Aegeus , who had a Daughter a faire young Uirgin, whose name was Titana , her vertuous dispositions were such, as might iustly challenge more loue, then the world could yeeld her: for her beautie was such, as it tainted Venus cheekes, her vertue shaddowed Dianaes Altars, her learning stayned sacred Pallas ,  & her loyaltie was such as it quite surpast Penelope : how can the world then extoll these excellent gifts of Nature, to the high spheere of their deserts, being so exquisitly limitted, and so louingly applauded by their Subiects reports, but by committing them, to those glittring creatures, enclosed within the spangled skies, where weele leaue them to the Heauens disposing, and turne to Meleagar her father: who in his youth had beene brought vp with Aegeus , and was his Schoole-fellow; so as they had beene Schoole-fellowes in their youth, they remained louing Neighbours in their age, maintaining course, and recourse, too and fro each others Courts, vpholding golden amitie, with the pillars of Brotherly loue, which did not only reioyce the Acchaians , but also augment the Grecians loue, with such inordinate, and extreame passions, that euery yeare, vpon the Kings Coronation day, the people throughout all Greece , and Acchaia , held a generall feast, for the space of fortie daies, with Iusts, and Turnies, with Running, Wrestling, Leaping, and Dauncing, with Bonfires, ringing of Bells, and such like pleasant pastimes: not onely to honour their two Kings, but also to shew their inward ioy, by their outward actions: as well to shewe their Kings, their royall deserts, as their loyaltie, being Subiects. When this solemne Triumph was quite ended, the people returned vnto their former labour, and wonted course of life, where weele leaue them,  & turne to Theseus : who though but young in yeares, yet old in experience, though valorous with Hercules , yet not too venturous with Phaeton ; though vpheld with the wings of Fortune, yet not rash in flying with Icarus , but keeping lower bownds with Dedalus ; hee feared not the Thunderbolts of Ioue , nor yet the raging waues of Neptune : (well to be briefe:) Theseus , who had euer since he was able to harbour, or conceiue one amorous thought, markt the excellencie of Titanaes behauiour, and the exquisitie of her beautie, perswaded himselfe that she was matchlesse on earth: in so much, that at last he fell into passionate affections with Titana ; and burst out his passions in these tearmes, being alone in a garden, sitting vnder an Orenge Tree: Ah Theseus thou that art a Kings sonne, and art applauded by the Greekes , to be the only champion of this climat, and wilt thou liue a slaue to Venus , confind and bard of libertie? no, no, cast of these foolish affections; for Theseus , surely thou dost not loue, these are but instant conceits, sweetned with hony, or fire made with straw, they are not Amors of perfection. Ah Theseus , flatter not thy selfe, thy heart doth feele the deadly wound of Cupids Darte: Oh, that blinde boy hath pierst it cleane through, like an Indian pearle: yet be chearfull Theseus , what needst thou feare, thou knowest the salue to cure thy amorous corosiue; Titana , is a Kings Daughter, and she is by birth Royall, learned by education, faire by Nature, by vertues famous, and by possessions rich: why then what needst thou feare, cast off these dispayring follies, and put on assuring fancies, for Cupid neuer throwes his Dart, but Venus seekes the wound: why then Theseus , art thou a Prince, and a valiant Souldier, and will liue thus perplexed with foolish loue, or a wound giuen by a Boy, expell such capitall follies, as would include thee with ignominious conceits? when he had thus sufficiently explained his passions,  & searcht the deepenesse of his still bleeding wound, he takes his farwell of the Orenge Tree, that shaddowed him from the beames of Phoebus , & returnes to his chamber, where weele leaue him ruminating on his loue, and turne to Titana : Who all this while, euen from her infancie, had noted the princely gesture of Theseus , & seeing his face so perfectly featurde, and viewing each lim, the portrature of his body so well limmitted, that she greatly commended Dame Natures art, and excellencie in shaddowing such perfection vnder her Fortunes lot; perswading her selfe, that none but Theseus should reape the heruest of her affection: being thus perplexed with inordinate passions, and possest with amorous affection, it wrote like a purgation with her, in so much that at last she brake her passions in these tearmes. Ah Titana , (thou art in loue) (I) with whom? with Theseus , (with Theseus ,) he is a Kings sonne, why so art thou a Kings Daughter; he is famous by birth; thou art vertuous, and faire by Nature; hee is a Prince; why thou art a Princesse: thou euery way art equiuolent with him: (why thou) if thou louest Theseus, Theseus cannot chuse but loue Titana : Ah Titana , thou fond foole, sigh, sob, and lament thee of thy follies, art thou so fond to thinke that Theseus being a valiant warrier, the Grecians champion, and heire apparant to that inuincible King Aegeus ; will looke on thee: no, thou art not an obiect, fitting for his expectiue eye, though thy vertuous qualities, be opposite to his vallorous accomplishmets, yet he cannot loue Titana : why? Titana is beautifull, vertuous, and rich, I,  & after her Fathers decease heire to the Crowne of rich Acchaia : why then Titana , suppresse these franticke passions, and incline to louely affections, for doe thou but smile, he cannot chuse but loue: well when shee had thus at large, playd, and displayd her passionate affection, she returnes to her chamber, to be melancholy, where weele leaue her. Theseus , who had receiued such a deadly woond, thought it long vntill he had some remedie for it, starts him vp, from the imbracements of his restlesse bed, and walkes towards the Court of Meleager : euen at his approach within the Court gates, the clocke struck eight: quoth Theseus , it is too earely daies to seeke to speake with Titana yet; Ile goe walke a course or too about the Garden till the clocke strikes againe, and that I thinke will be about the time of Titanaes rising he immediately turnes on the backe side of the Court, to enter into the Garden, but when he came hee found the doore fast lockt: yet Fortune willing to fauour his presence, would not suffer him to returne, but caused him to knocke, the which hee did, and immediatly it was opened by a Groome of Titanaes chamber: quoth Theseus , where is your Lady and mistris, stirring yet? quoth the Groome, and shall please your Highnes, she sits alone at the further end of the Garden, areading; with that Theseus cast vp his eye, and espied his louely Paramour: walking in the Garden vnseene of Titana , he stepte into a greene Arbour, which stoode directly opposite against her, and not farre distant from her, where he first viewed each limmit, or proportrature of her bodie: and then beganne he to breake his passions: ah Theseus: (ecce) see how her crimson lips, stands like two Pilgrimes, to adorne those vermillian cheekes of hers, which like as the Addamant drawes the steele so they drawe thee to loue: Nay behold her christall eies how like to vnestimable Diamonds, they glitter and giue light to the out-chanted Cinthia : now last of all, see how farre her twined lockes doth surpasse the Arabian gold, in golden beautie: when he has thus breathed out his passions in these passionate tearmes; hee stands a while commenting in this dull perplexitie, yet at last beginnes to prosecute his passions with these tearmes. Theseus , thou seest her excellencie, perfection, and beautie, why then make a mixture with those, and thy intire loue, and drinke them as a phisicke potion, either to cure, or kill, and so shalt thou be sure to be eased by death, else cured to life, for in loue there is life in hate there is death but Titanaes face, resembles an Adamants vertue, to draw loue by affection, and not kill Loue with reiecting, and more it is impossible, that she should couer a flintie heart, with a smiling face, for I know the virtue of Venus mollifies the heart of Titana : why then Theseus what needst thou feare, shew thy selfe as valiant a Prince to Titana , as thou hast done in former time to Mars , and returned victor of the field, when thou wast beset with millions of foes, and will thou now feare the repulse of a woman, and bring thy loue too? no thou shalt seale the walls and lay batterie to the fairest: and with that hee stepls out of the Arbour with a modest behauiour, and full resolution, takes her by the hand, and withall dimples his cheekes, with a louelie smile as loue giues louers direction: (and thus beginnes), Faire Titana , euer since I could conceiue one Amorous thought, or cast a wanton eye on beauties perfection, I haue remained imburthened with the essence of your beautie, and wounded with the vicerous sore of your loue: therefore, faire Lady reiect me not with disdaine, because I approach with curtesie: and as our two aged Fathers liues in peacefull amitie, so let vs combine a monumentall vnitie, it will not onely be a comfort to them, but also an eternall ioy to vs: Titana resting, and meditating a while, at last bepaints her cheekes with a maiden blush, and thus replies. Prince Theseus , this is very strange to me, that such inordinate passions of loue, should so farre ouerflow her shores on the sudden, being no storme nor spring to be the causer: therefore Theseus , surely this is not loue, these are but fained axions to trie simplicitie: inluring baits, to catch loud folly in wanton snares: for Demophoon was faire by nature, but prooued false to Phillis: Aeneas was a braue man, but as false as Almider : yet were their protested vows greater then common hearts can conceiue: Therefore Theseus suppresse thy passions, and leaue to loue Titana , for she cannot loue thee againe, she is like the starre Artophilax , that is beautious to the eye, but fit for no vse, euen so is Titana , iust opposite against Nature: well still she keepes him at the staffes length, and sits her still on the greene bancke where he found her; shadowing her yeelding passions with denying frownes. Theseus , who all this while had markte, and viewed each limmit of her body, and the feature of her face, thought it very strange, that Nature should indow so faire a face, with so hard a heart, such comely limmits with such peruerse conditions: at last thus beganne to prosecute his cause againe in these tearmes. Faire Titana , bee not proude of beauties pointing, for it is but a Summers flower, the Winter fades it, and those which disdaine in youth, are despised in age: therefore faire Lady, make not a Goddesse of beautie, but yeeld me loue, for loue, and let not the destinies cause me to dispaire, now in the verdencie of my blooming youth. Titana sitting still on ye banck, (as it were) not regarding him, thus beginnes. Theseus I commend thine exceeding wit, but in this case, I pittie thy distresse, and for the extremitie of loue thou bearest to me, I vow thee recompence; but with contract I dare not promise, therefore good Theseus , suppresse those passions, which now thy minds perplexed with. Theseus standing a while, commenting in this dull perplexitie, scarcely dared vouchsafe to giue an answere, or demaund a remedie, yet saide hee, opportunities neglected are signes of follies, therefore he beganne againe in these tearmes. Titana , the fatall doubts of cruell death, is not so feared of me, but I dare extend my life with fortunes fate, to enioy thy loue: why than faire Lady, sith I am so wounded with your loue, yeeld to my request, which is within the bounds of modestie desired: If I were lasciuious, demaunding vnchast desires, to vse thee as a Concubine, then mightest thou iustly be peruerse & say me nay: or were I a Begger, or a base borne vassell, of no desert, or reputation vile, then would I hold it wisdome: or came I like a Scithian Shepheard, with my sheepcrooke on my neck: But comming like a Grecian Prince, with my Scepter in my hand, demanding loue with a chast deuotion, mee-thinks you should not be so peruerse, to denie so kind a demaund. Quoth Titana , good Theseus be not so tedious, for to be short in tearmes, I will not grant thee loue; for loue is the only thing I hate, therefore trouble me no more with such friuolous speeches, if you please to accompany mee, as in former time you haue done, you shall be ye welcommest man in Greece : but if you replie with such like speeches as loue, I rather desire your absence, then your presence. Theseus hearing her still in that froward denying vaine, quite expeld hope, and included dispaire: and thus beganne he, which scarcely found beginning. Oh wicked and dispairing wretch: forlorne, and of Titana forsaken, worse then the seruilst slaue in Achaia , more base then the slimie earth vnderneath thy feete: more in bondage, then Tunissian gally slaues, more vacant on earth, then Indians in Arabia , and more wretched then Progne in her transformation: why how canst thou thus metamorphosed being a Kings sonne? (oh with loue) with loue, of that ingratefull Titana , for had I not loued Titana , she had not caused my vntimely death, but measuring my aduerse fortune, with thy peruerse obstinacie, Ile end my life: and with that he vnsheaths his fatall Engine and sayd thus: Faire Lady, as like ye Camelian , I haue liued by the Ayrie essence of thy loue: so like faithfull Theseus by thy hate ile die: Hee sets the point of his sword to his brest. Titana seeing him so desperate, lightly skipt from off the bancke whereon she sate, and suddenly takes him by the hand which held his sword, and thus beganne. Theseus , art thou a Prince, and a Kings sonne, a warrior, and Grecians Champion: and wilt at a wenches frowne ruine thy body, and bring thy aged Fathers gray haires, with griefe vnto his graue, and lay his carefull head, on a restlesse pillow? remember this, thou art heire apparant vnto thy Fathers Crowne, and Kingdome; and by thy well liuing, thy Fathers daies are prolonged on earth, but by thy ill dying, with griefe they are soone ended: why then know this braue Theseus , wenches will most denie, the thing they most desire; & seeme most peruerse, where most they loue; and prooue most constant, where they seeme most wauering (and so will I, my loue) although I fained a frowne, yet detested I to hate, and though my tongue sayd no, my heart protested I. Therefore sweete Theseus , impute me not peruerse, for the heauens knowes, I shame to expresse, how proude I haue beene of Theseus loue, yet would I not say Theseus I loue thee: because then thou mights repute me immodest, being a Lady, but the Gods doth know, I haue honoured Theseus with a zealous deuotion, and I loued Theseus with as dutifull affection, as Titana could performe, or Theseus desire: therefore sweete loue, thinke not I yeeld with vrgent prayers, but with the force of loue. Theseus noting her behauiour, and hearing such vnexpected tearmes, and sugred alurements of Titana , which made such pleasing harmony in his halfe dead eares, was halfe rauished, & wholy reuiued to his former sences: sheathed his fatall blade againe, imbracing her in his armes, layd battery to her skarlet lips, with many a sugred kisse he giues assault and winnes the Fort: In briefe, they suddenly combind, and fully accomplisht a monumentall contract, so that after many louely imbracings, and pleasing wanton toyes, (as loue hath many) they parted for ye time, so fraught with inordinate ioy, that it is impossible for the capacitie of man to looke so high as their ioy did raise rebounds. Fortune now enuying their good acts, turnes her Wheele, and as she had dimpled her cheekes, so now she wrinckled her forhead, and vreeled the destinies, for in Acchaia there dwelt Oenie , which euery yeere did sacrifice the firstlings of his store: the which he first assigned of his corne, and fruits to Ceres : to Bacchus the first pressing of his wine: and vnto Pallas Olliffe- oyle, and thus honouring the Gods of graine, and fruite, hee offered franckinsence, but at Dianaes Altars none was offered, hee ouer-slipt them, the which Diana tooke in high disdaine,  & sayd, he shall not skape vnpunnished, though he past mine Altars vnworshipped, nor vaunt of his escape vnreuenged, if I be a Goddesse ile plague him and his fruits, and with that away she flies: and on the next morne she sent a huge ouer-grown Boare to Oenies ground, such as the like had neuer yet beene seene. This greedy Boare deuoured his Corne, and grasse, and rent his Uines vnto the ground: and not so sufficed but beganne to ouer-runne, and deuoure the Countrie of Acchaia ? in so much that the husbandman had laboured in vaine, he ouer-runne their Lambs, shepe, and Heards of Kie, nay men, woomen, and children went daily in danger, of this orped swines dreadfull Tuskes. Insomuch, that the people of Achaia preferred supplications to Aegeus, Meleagar , and Theseus , and many other Kings Dukes, Lords, and Knights, to desire their ayde to conquer this mercilesse Hogge: the which they all were very willing and affable, but Theseus : yet he saide I, although he could haue wisht it no: for the reason that mooued him rather to haue stayed at home, then haue gone was this: he was newly returned from his loue Titana , and they had both agreed to make their Fathers acquainted with their loues on the next day following, which was the day appointed; that this Princely knot should meete and accompany each other, to the face, of the Achaians foe: Theseus very much discontent with this newes, could haue fained himselfe sicke, and staide at home, but his heart was so enobled with valour, that it would suffer excuse to take no place: hee seeing no remedie, but goe he must, being that renowned King Meleagar , with his royall troopes of valiant Knights, accompanied with his Father Aegeus were come, he like Iason , when he ventured for Medea , or Hercules for Deianita , or like Turnus , before he went to his bloudie fight, armed and Enobled himselfe with valour: which done, hee accompanied this Princely knot of noble Knights, euen to the very brincke of his owne aduerse Fortune, where weele leaue him vnreeling the destinies, and turne to Meleagar the causer of his griefe: who being vpholden with the wings of Fortune, reaped the plentuous Haruest, of a renowned encounter, by the winning a famous victorie. Meleagar with the rest of valiant Knights, threw his luckie Durke against this orped twine, who being more potent with Fortunes sauour then impotent with Dianaes frowne, gaue this Boore his deadly wound: this being done, though old in yeares, yet young in conceit, for with pride meerely, of his fortunate stroake, he presently fell into amorous seakes, with Atalant, Schoenies Daughter of Tegea : and suddenly stepping to the Swine, said thus: Oh Lady Atalant , receiue thou this my fee: And of my glorie, vouch thou safe partaker for to bee. And with that gaue her the herd of the swine. This Ladie for the giuers sake was as glad in heart, as for the gift, and receiued it very thankfully: but the rest repinds that she such honour had, and armes displayd, that all the field might easily see, and heare, their murmuring discontent: Plexippus , and Toxey cried: Dame, lay downe this geare, doe we take the toyle, and thou the honour of our Game? no, nor let that faire smooth face of thine beguile thee, least he that being doated in thy loue, and giuing thee our fee, be ouerfarre to rescue thee: and with that word they tooke the gift away from her, and right of gift from him. Quoth Meleagar , with a sterne and fierce looking countenance, you Thesties race, learne this from me, and doe not other folkes dispoyle of honour giuen, for Princes gifts are free, of none to be reiected: and Princes wils are lawes, of none to be vsurped. Therefore Plexippus , what difference is betwixt your threats and deedes, ile with this weapon trie: & with that he suddenly strikes him through the brest with his Boore speare. Toxey seeing his brother slaine, stood doubting what way to take, desiring to reuenge his Brothers bloud, yet fearing to be murthered as his Brother was before, stood amazedly commenting: Meleagar , to dispatch his doubtfull muzes, drew his fatall sword and slew him for company of his Brother Plexippus , whose bloud was hardly cold as yet. This bloudie prospect, bred such a mutinie amongst them, that their arms displayd on both sides, in so much that the two houses, Meleagar and Aegeus , fell to a ciuill discension, and much bloud was spilt on both sides: and not onely these two houses of Meleagar , and Aegeus , but almost all Greece, Achaia , and Calidon was in an vproare, for each tooke armes against other, and being renowned and famous Princes, friends tooke parts, and they beganne to bandie, and ouer-runne each others Dominions. This disagreement betweene the Parents, although it was a heart breaking to these two louers, Titana , and Theseus , yet did it not at all disparage their affection, but the greater the mutinie, the deeper was the impression of their mindes, and by this meanes their libertie was confinde, and meeting places quite debard, yet loue bring a priuie searcher of secrets, found a time and opportunitie, which gaue them place, time, and leaue to parle, to play and display each others mindes: when these two louers came together, they were in feare, and danger to be espied, which caused them one while, to sighe, sobbe, lament, and grieue; another while, kisse, smile, laugh, and ioy: and thus they spent the time as pleasantly as distressed louers could doe, yet they sware to each other, yt their Fathers dissention should neuer seperate their loues, nor aduerse Fortune should diminish their affections, but would remaine ioyfull vnto death, in despite of the hatefull destinies: hauing thus recounted each others loues to their hearts content, yet seeing they could not enioy the full fruition of their loues in Greece , nor Acchaia . Theseus determined assoone as time and opportunitie gaue him leaue, to prouide a masse of mony, and Iewells for the easier cariage: and so transport themselues into Spaine , to Tunis : and there to liue a contented life, not knowne, but as a Grecian Knight, vntill he heard of some vnited peace betwixt their Fathers, else by succession to enioy their Kingdomes: Titana hearing his determinate course, commended highly his wittie deuice, (and sayd thus) Faire loue, if thy father Aegeus should take me within his presincke it were death, or at least perpetuall imprisonment, and againe on the other side, if my father Meleagar , should take thee in his Dominions, it were the like danger for thee to come into. But if my Father should heare of this contract, his fury would be such, that ye tortorous death were to easie for vs both, first you for presumption, then I for simplicitie, and to we shall bite both on the destinies bridle. Therefore sweete Theseus , make hast with all expedition,  & prouide all things fitting for our Uoyage, for delay breeds danger, and false Fortune despite. Theseus being fraught with boundlesse ioy and prickt forward with loues desire, did protest vnto her assoone as opportunitie gaue him leaue, he would prouide such necessaries as were fitting for their Uoyage, so resting vpon this resolution, and night beginning to listen to their complement: after many imbracings, payed and repayed kisses they parted. Theseus hauing taken the leaue of his best beloued Titana , returnes him backe againe to his fathers Court: which being there arriued, cald vnto him, an ancient Seruant of his fathers, whose name was Iunia : this Iunia being a faithfull Seruant, and Theseus approoued friend, he thought him not lesse then fitting to imploy about this his secret presence. Theseus deposing confident trust in him, declared the whole volume of his minde vnto him, from the beginning to the end: Iunia , hearing him so fully bent, and determinately resolued on this imparfet course: beganne to diswade, or diuert him to the contrarie, aleadging diuers instant inconueniences: Theseus bring so determinate in his pretence beganne to reiect Iunia for his folly in diswading him, and told him he did not call nor disclose his minde vnto him, to aske his aduise, or to be intercepted by him, but the cause he had him there present, was this, he did depose trust vnto him, and impose this secret busines on him to prouide a small barke, or Pinnis to transport them into Spaine , with monies and certaine Iewells and such like commodities for the easier cariage: which if he could prouide and make readie against such a time hee would reward him royally for his paines. Iunia hearing this, that there was no perswasion would take effect, or instant examples to the contrarie diuert him, and withall respecting the Princes bountifull promise beganne to yeeld vnto him, I and in the end promised him to prouide all things readie for their Uoyage within the space of fortie daies at the furthest. Theseus hearing this direct answere and promise of Iunia , was exceedingly fraught with ioy, in so much, that to shew his bountie, and binde him vnto his promise, he sent him away very richly rewarded, where weele leaue him prouiding for the Uoyage, and turne to Meleagar . Fortune, who had alreadie layde her traine, so destinated, that it vtterly brake the vnited bands of these two Louers fathers combinde League, and almost to the separating of their loue, with heart-breaking: yet not so content, intending as she had giuen them a slender checke, so now she should giue them a cruell blow; and to bring her presence to be managed with perfection, she layd her plot in this wise. Meleagar , walking priuately in his Garden, commenting on his Daughter Titana , brake out his passions in these tearmes; Meleagar ; thou hast but one onely Daughter, and she is now about the yeeres of 23, and she is a Prince so richly deckt, and adorned with the gifts of Nature, so fraught with beautie, and vertuous qualities, that she is not onely a comfort to thee, but also a ioy to thy poore Commons: why then, place all thy ioy in her perfection, and sith she is now marriageable, prouide her a husband that is equiuolent with her: when he had thus passioned a while, he sate him downe vnder a Poomsitherne Tree, to meditate on whom be might bestow his Daughter Titana : till at last, he called to minde great Ambrosa , king of Portugal , who in former time had bin brought vp together for the space of seauen yeares in Schoole: and knowing this Ambrosa to haue a Sonne, whose name was Pirismus , who was faire by Nature, royall by birth, by vertues famous, and by possessions rich: presently sends Embassadors to the King of Portugall , to intreate a marriage between his Daughter Titana , and his Sonne Pirismus, Ambrosa hearing this, was exceedingly fraught with ioy and told the Embassadoro, it was his decree before they came, to haue sent to their King Meleagar , concerning the same matter, but sith they were so happily come, he told them his name was ready, and his Sonne Pirismus should along with them to Calidon , and if God did permit him, he would be there with them, within fortie dayes The Embassadors hauing receiued their answere, and the Prince boorded his Fleere, the Mariners hoisted their maine sailes, weighed ancors, and hailed into the deepe. Fortune fauouring Theseus destinie, opens the windows of Aeolus , and giues them a full winde, which in a short space arriued them on the shores of Acchaia : being so fortunately arriued, they instantly retired to the Court with the young Prince Pirismus , and made report to Meleagar of Ambrosaes answere, and how he had sent his Sonne as a pledge in the meane while. When Meleagar heard that was Ambrosaes Sonne, he seemed very angrie they did not send him word of their comming, that he might haue receiued him in a more prince like manner, but seeing it was now too late, to recall what was past, he saluted him very submissiuely, and told him he was very sorie he knew not of his comming, for if he had, he would haue met him by ye way. Well after these, and such like words, Meleagar takes him about the middle, and leads him into his priuie Chamber, causing the Nobles to attend them, where as Titana sate a sowing. Quoth Meleagar , young Prince Pirismus , behold, there sits mine onely Daughter Titana , my chiefest ioy, and the originall cause of your Uoyage hither, and if you please to acquaint your selfe with her you may Quoth Pirismus , my noble Liege, with your leaue else not. Quoth Meleagar , young prince you haue our leaue, to vse your pleasure. Quoth Pirismus with a low obeysance, thanks my noble Liege, and with that steps vnto Titana , takes her by the hand, and thus beginnes: Faire Lady, if a Pilgrime Prince, may vouchsafe so bold to be, as to preferre a rough vnpollisht touch, vnto those soft lips of yours, without offence, my desire is accomplisht, other wise my sute is cold. Titana seeing him a stranger, and hearing such inordinate tearmes proceede from him, was halfe in a misdoubt that her father had brought him, to be a suter in a cause that was already ouerthrowne, and dammages recouered, yet hoping the best, though fearing the worst, with a low curtesie, she thus replies, noble Knight, as your request is small, it is the easier granted; againe, if I should by deniall refuse it, you might iustly appeach me foolish: with that he giues her a kisse, which she very thankfully receiued, and accompanied him vnto her father, the which did greatly reioyce the King, her father: by this time there was a table furnished with such cates, and dainties, as could at so small a warning be prouided. Meleagar sitting downe, caused Pirismus to sit on the same side which he sate on, and Titana to sit on the other side, right opposite against him, because they should take a ful view of each other, the which Pirismus did, in so much that her perfection dinted so deepe an impression in his heart, that none but Titana could satisfie, the Amor of Pirismus eye: when he was thus solemnly, and sumptuously feasted, and royally entertained; and so entertained, that if Ambrosa had beene there himselfe in person, hauing so small warning, they could not receiue him with more triumphant royaltie. After they had thus sufficiently past the day in sumptuous feasts, and bauquets? the King gaue commaund he should be attended on to his lodging,  & all his Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, and their followers appointed their lodgings, and attended also: which being done and all departed, Meleagar calls for Titana , and thus brake his minde vnto her. Titana , my gray-haires sounds an alarum, and calls me to my graue: therefore actions measured by time, are seldome bitten with repentance; thou art young, and I am old, my white haires are fading blossomes, and thy fresh coulors blooming flowers, mine preparing to die, and thine repairing to liue: (therefore Titana ) I take care, and tell thee as a father, hoping thou wilt giue eare, and obey as a Childe. The chiefe thing I haue taken care for, and desired, hath beene to see thee happily married before I die, or thou grow old. Titana , hearing her fathers counsaile, and marking well his words, beganne to feele which way the winde sate, and at last perswaded her selfe in her opinion, as this, that her father had chosen this young Prince Pirismus to be her spouse; fearing to displease her father, yet swearing and vowing not to forsake Theseus , made him this answere. May it please your Grace, to giue me leaue to speake? Quoth Meleagar , we giue you free leaue. Quoth Titana , Sir, there is no greater bonde then dutie, nor no stricter law then Nature: for often disobedient youth, are despised in age, and Parents wills are lawes; therefore, rather then by deniall, I should be appeached of disobedience, ile rest content to loue, although it bee the onely thing I hate: If it may please your Highnes to appoint whom I shall loue. Meleagar hearing this vnexpected answere of his Daughter, and seeing how light she accounted of loue, beganne to bee very hot and chollericke, and with a frowning countenance, made her this hastie answere. What Titana , canst thou not loue? why, doth the cinnicall passion of proue desires, ouercome thee with franticke frowardnesse, or peeuish peruersenesse? or doest thou thinke thy selfe a young Phoenix , that there is none to equall thee? Ah Titana , take heed, least high Pride, bring low pouertie; and young disobedience, aged repentance: the Tree Alpia wasteth not with fire, but withereth with deaw, and that which loue nourisheth not, hate perisheth. Well, yeeld Titana to thy Fathers perswasions, which may preuent all after perills; thou seest I am olde, and full of gray haires, daily walking on the brincke of my graue, ready to fall in euery houre, and thou heire apparant to my Crowne, after my discease, shalt succeede my Kingdome, in more triumphant Throne, then ere thy father Meleager did in his youngest yeares: knowing this, thou being young in yeares, and scarce gouernesse of thine owne dispositions, it would be a greater trouble, & a heauier burthen, to be so ouer-prest with the charge of a whole Kingdome, to gouerne and looke too: thereforeto helpe and ease thee of thy burthen, and increase thee with ioy, I haue chosen thee a husband heere, the Prince Pirismus , thou sawst heere erewhile, he is a Prince, faire by nature, royall by birth, by vertues famous, and by possessions rich: therefore if thou like Pirismus , thou breedst my content, and in louing him, thou shalt haue my loue, otherwise an euerlasting hate. Titana standing a while, called to mind that Theseus did purpose to take his Uoyage to Tunis very shortly, where shee determined to arriue with him, and therefore she thought it was as good for her to say she loued him, and keepe her fathers good will, as say she could not loue him, and haue his ill will: and againe, she thought this, if she should be peruerse and say him nay, it might be a meanes in her fathers anger, to make him suspect, and misdoubt some other matters, and so looke more nearer vnto her, and so be a hinderance to her departure with Theseus : therefore shee determined to yeeld with words vnto her Fathers desire, and thus bespake him, with a low courtesie: Father, I obey your commaund, as a child, hoping to enioy your loue as a Father: and if Pirismus can loue Titana, Titana well loue Pirismus ; but pray father thinke not, but that I yeeld with loue, and not with your perswasions: and please you to appoynt the nupttall day, I will be readie to accomplish what you please to impose on me. Quoth Meleagar , now hast thou woone my heart, and shalt enioy my loue, Ile make thee rich by possessions, and happy by marriage, Ile indow thee with wealth, and Pirismus with loue; I ioy to see thee toward, and hate to see thee peruerse: now shall my gray-haires enioy a rest, which long hath beene disturbed with care; so after these, and many other such like speeches, he appointed her the nuptuall day, which should be at Ambrosaes comming: Titana being mindfull of her true loue Theseus , was sorely troubled in minde, because her father had appointed the time within so short a space, she was fearefull that Theseus could not prouide all things for their Uoyage so soone, yet hearing it out with a good countenance, shee lookt pleasantly in the sight of her father, and determined, if things were not readie soone inough, she would faine some excuse, to prerogue the time: well for that time, they departed, and betooke them to their rest: on the morrow morning, Meleagar was stirring very earely, and calls to him, his chiefe Admirall, and commaunds him to prouide a Fleete of his chiefest Ships, and furnish them with men and Ordinance, and all things else fitting to receiue a Prince; he being no lesse then willing to fulfill the Kings ioyfull determination, very speedily prepared all things fitting for their Uoyage tooke his Embassage of the King, and suddenly boarded the Naute, hoysted mayne sailes, weyghed anchors, and away they cut through the deepe, where weele leaue them to the fauour of the winde, and the Seas. Meleagar , hauing sent his Embassadors for the King of Portugall , calls his Nobles, and chiefe Officers together, and told them that the tenth day of that present moneth should be the Nuptiall day: and bad them proclaime a feast, Iusts, and Turnies, and inuite all their neighbour Princes, with the chiefe of his owne Dominions; and that it was Meleagars command and will, the Court gates should stand open, and receiue all commers for the space of twentie daies; as well for the royall entertainment of Ambrosa , as for honour of his Countrie: his Nobles being no lesse then willing to further his pretence, very diligently according to the Kings commande, prepared all things in a readines: where weele leaue them attending Ambrosaes comming, and turne to Titana : who in the sight her new loue Pirismus , seemed no lesse then fraught with the wanton feaks of loue, to leade that toyish foole into a purblind paradice, where in the end shee meant to leaue him champing of Cupids bridle: and in her fathers sight, she seemed so abundant in her loue, that she almost made his gray-haires begins afresh so bud, and bloome foorth youthfull blossoms againe, in so much that it is impossible to conceiue the inward ioy, that he receiued by their outward toying; and though shee forcst her selfe to be ioyous and pleasant to her fathers, and Pirismus presence, yet was she forcst to balefull melancholly, and hatefull griefe in their absence: well, it happened that in few dayes after, there came newes to Meleagars Court, that Ambrosa was come within two dayes sailing of Calidon , and by contraries winds forcst to cast anchor, and lie there for the winds returne. Meleagar hearing this newes, caused a Fleete of his best ships to be made readie; which being done, he himselfe, and Pirismus with others, boarded the Fleete, and Titana should haue gone too, but the Seas vnwilling to crosse her submisse Loue, with aduerse hate, caused a tempestious storme to rise, in so much that the very sight of Neptunes frownes cast her into a dispairing feare, the which her father seeing, caused her to returne to the Court againe, and they tooke their Uoyage towards Ambrosa , where weele leaue them to their fortune, and turne to Titana againe. Who being so long absented from her loue Theseus , and so often presented with her hated Pirismus , like a true Louer discontented, desired to walke and sit alone to meditate; on the back side of her fathers Pallace, there was a very large Garden which had diuers doores to enter in at; this Garden was the place, where Theseus did vse to meete her, which place she held most conuenient, and fit for her to passion out her griefes: when the after noone came, she walked all alone into the Garden, vnto the wonted place where Theseus was woont full often to imbrace her, with many louely kisses, hoping that the Gods seeing her distresse, would relieue her want,  & as they had beene witnesses to her vowes, so she hopt they would be fauourers to her presence: and thus walkt she a while commenting in these dull perplexities, till at last, her passions were so vrget with her, she could no longer suppresse them, but sate her downe on a greene banck, and burst out her passions in these tearmes. Ah Titana , thou infortunate wretch, art thou a Kings Daughter, and liue thus a slaue to Cupid ? better were thou a country wench, to enioy their louely pleasure; then a courtly mistrisse, thus wrapt in froward miserie: now must thou see the destinies plague thee, for thy disobedience. Ah sigh Titana , draw drie those two christall fountains, from whence these pearled streames descends, to ouerflowe these tender cheekes of thine: loue Pirismus , and in louing him thou louest thy selfe. Ah no, I dare not; Pirismus no: its Theseus , and none but Theseus shall haue my true loue: Ah foole that thou art, to fix so fondly; thou knowest Theseus is a Grecian , and Greekes thy fathers foes: then sticke to thy fathers election, and loue Pirismus , for in louing him thou shalt enioy the worlds content. Ah no, I haue made my solemne vowes to Theseus , and will keepe them, tis not worldly content alone that I desire, but Theseus loue, the patron of my meditating thoughts, the Couch of my wearie ioyntures rest, and the Crowne of my eartheriall glory. When shee had thus breathed foorth her solitarie passions, from the grey morne, to the red euen, Zephir beganne to draw the melancholly curtaines of portendous night, which caused Titana to depart, which hauing taken her leaue of the Orenge, and Lemmon Trees, which onely did accompany her all that day, returnes to her chamber againe, where she immurs her selfe in contemplation. It hapned that in two dayes after, her father, Ambrosa, Pirismus , and all their followers arriued on Calidon shores: and Pagents, Drums, and Trumpets were prouided, with sweet perfumes, and Frankinsence, the streets were sweetned for their passage, which greatly pleased Ambrosa : so that they suddenly arriued at Meleagars Court, where they were most sumptuously entertained with banquets and feasting, which being done, Meleagar willing to make knowne by outward shewes, how he was possest with inward ioyes: leapt from his chaire of state, and fetcht his Daughter Titana , leading her into Ambrosaes presence by the middle: Titana seeing her supposed siere, fained on him a smile, and withall to grace the dimples of her cheekes, she giues them a comly and modest blush, and with a low and reuerent courtesie, she did obeysence to King Ambrosa , the which he seeing, suddenly stept to her, tooke her in his armes, and louingly imbrast her, with many curtious, and royall speeches, Pirismus who had all this while markt her behauiour, blest his Fortune, and thankt the Gods for his good accesse: when he had so done, hee thought himselfe to haue most right to her, tooke her aside to the further side of the Roome where he sported his blind folly, and catcht at shaddowes, yet to his hearts content, and both their Fathers increased ioy: but alas to poore Titanaes heart breaking, though she fained a smyle in her fathers presence, yet was she forst to weepe in his absence: Meleagar was so fraught with ioy, that he thought euery day a yeare that his Daughter went vnmarried, yet past he sixe daies more in keeping Ambrosa company, and shewing him the pastimes and pleasures that hee chiefely tooke delight in: in the meane time he called to him his chiefe Officers, and Nobles & demaunds if all things were readie for the Nuptiall; the which they all answered, I. When Meleagar heard that, he was very ioyfull, and presently makes Ambrosa, Pirismus , and Titana acquainted with his pretence (which was this) that on the seueth day following, being the sixteene day of the moneth, he did purpose to accomplish the marriage betwixt Pirismus and Titana , the which they all seemed to be very ioyfull & glad of, saue onely Titana , yet she seemed no lesse then ioyfull in the sight of her Father, but in her chamber she passioned whole riuers of teares from her christall eies, where weele leaue her to the fauour of the Gods, and turne to Theseus ; Who all this while, hath beene very busie, and laborious in his carefull affaires, and hauing accomplisht his busines, finisht his purpose, and layd the ship ready in the Hauen, is very desirous to speake with his loue Titana , but his father being present, he could find no opportunitie fitting to make an escape foorth, which bredde hatefull melancholly, in so much that he immued vp himselfe in his chamber, to solicit sadnesse, fortune smiling at his folly, dandled him once again on her indulgent knee: It hapned at that instant a Noble man of Aegeas Court, riding through a Forrest, that was some eight myles distant from Athens , espyed a wilet Boare, and knowing the King loued the sport of hunting, as well as the one halfe of his Kingdome, came riding post to the King and made report of his busines: the King hearing him, caused sudden preparation to be made, he hauing a very faire Pallas standing in the midst of that Forrest determined to go thither to bed that night, the which preparation being made, and all things readie, he calls for Theseus , but he had heard some inkling of his fathers hunting prograce, and how he was vpon going, famed himselfe sicke, and tooke phisicke: when word was brought to the King that Theseus could not goe, he demaunded the occasion, they answered he was not well, hee tooke phisicke. The King hearing that newes and loth to delay time, and so loose his sport, called his Nobles about him, where they mounted their Steedes, and rode towards the Forrest, where weele leaue them to their sport, and turne to Titana ; Who now hath little hope to enioy Theseus loue, for the sixe dayes are almost expired, and the seuenth is the nuptiall day appointed, which was the next day following, yet being the last day of her hope, she went one morning to walke in the Garden to seeke her Theseus bearing a sharpe Engine in her hand, determining with herselfe, that as she had made her vowes to Theseus , none should enioy her loue but Theseus : and where she did protest those vowes to Theseus , there she meant to sacrifice her blood to the Gods for Theseus sake, where weele leaue her. Theseus hearing his father was gone, puts on a disguised sute of apparell, and secretly conueyes himselfe foorth at the Court-gates by Iuniaes meanes, determining neuer to come in againe, sends Iunia to the Hauen, where the ship lay, and caused him to attend his comming there; which done, hee walkes towards the Court of Meleagar , which was at that time neare adioyning to the Citie of Athens: hee beeing arriued at the Court, suddenly makes meanes to enter the garden: which beeing entred, he walkts to the farther side, where he was woont to meete his Loue Titana : hee was no sooner approacht, but hee espied her where shee sate, leaning her head on her hand, as though shee had bene a sleepe: hee no lesse then glad to see her, began to step hastily to her, but euen as he was ready to touch her, hee perceiued that she was weeping and lamenting very grieuously to her selfe: breathing out her passions in these tearmes; Ah infortunate Titana , and therefore infortunate wretch, borne vnder the destinies displeasure, and therefore crost with Fortunes frowns, bound to Theseus by loue, therefore pincht with care by fate: yet Theseus , Ah sweet Theseus , my dearer farre, then my selfe is to my selfe, and none shall deflower mee of his virgins Rose, except this fatall Engine; sith protestations, vowes, and bonds are made, and sealed with the waxe of Loues sweete lips, t'is Theseus , and none but Theseus shall enioy my Loue. Theseus , seeing her in that dull perplexitie, and so metamorphosed, stood astonished at the sight, and had not the power to goe backward nor forward, hee was driuen so such an exigent: faine he would goe backe to lose the sight of so grieuous a prospect, and fayner goe to her, to knowe the cause, and seeke redresse, yet could hee doe neither, but stood still in a dull extasie, halfe dead with griefe: till at the last shee remoou'd her head, and lookt vp after a mournfull fashion, as Phillis lookt for Demophoon ; and casting aside her blubbered eyes, shee espyed her Theseus : shee rose off the banke whereon she sat making her complaintes: threwe away her Fatall engine, tooke him about the necke and kist him, smiled, and thus bespake him; Ah Theseus , arte thou come to prosecute my weale or woe? (Quoth Theseus ) thy weale I hope, with harts content sweet Loue: but I pray thee sweet-hart, what's the occasion of these thy preambling passions, thus sob'd with sourcing teares: Oh said Titana sinister Fortune, hath cast mee into aduerse perplexities: for since thou departedst from these sweete imbracements of mine, Fortune hath frowned on our pretence (quoth Theseus , how sweete Loue?) Titana fained to smyle, yet forced to weepe, thus began: Oh Theseus , my Father sent Ambassadours to Ambrosa King of Portugall , to intreate a marriage betweene his Sonne Pirismus , and thy loue Titana ; his father being as willing to yeeld, as my father to demand: presently sends ouer his son Pirismus , as a pledge of his promise, by the returne of my fathers Embassadors, and now is come himself to accomplish the match: when my father heard the returne of his Embassage, and saw Pirismus , he called me to him, where he opened the whole volum of his pretence, perswading me of the Princes intire loue, his rare accomplishments, and how happie I was to enioy the loue of so rich a friend, with many such capitall perswasions; in so much that in the end, I did reply this obstinate answere: I could not loue, it was the onely thing that I did hate: with such like words, that at last he fell from kind perswasions, and fell into thundring threats, and in such franticke manner, that I durst no longer withstand him, but gaue consent, and promised to be readie whensoeuer he pleased to appoint the time the which he was very ioyfull to heare, and appointed the Nuptiall to bee the sixteenth day of this moneth, which is this next day following: yet good Theseus account not my behauiour light, though I haue promised loue to two men at once: but know this deere loue, it is but one is stedfastly to abide, the other but falsely to delude: for if I should haue stoode obstinate, and peruerse denying him; then should I haue had his perpetuall hate, and in hauing his hate, like poore Ioue with Argus shauld still be watcht and lookt after, that I the harder should finde opportunitie to depart with thee to Tunis: therefore to auoide suspition, I made him a fained promise, but still braue Theseus resting at thy commaund, and obeying as thy hand-maide ile liue and die with thee; and with that takes him about the necke, and doth so pay and repay him with kisses, that shee halfe smothers him. Theseus heard her politicke answere, hearing her wittie reply, and seeing her loue so constant; much commended her wit, but more pittied her griefe, desired her to patience, and wishing her not to be so passionate, promised her that euery feare that she had for him spent, should from him returns tenne thousand ioyes againe: and quoth Theseus I haue prouided a ship, and all things necessarie for our passage, which lies readie in the hauen, and if you are readie and willing, nowe there is a fit gale of winde to transport vs from the Grecian shores to Tunis . Quoth Titana , my deere loue, it is the onely thing I desire, through fire and water to follow thee sweete Theseus . Quoth Theseus , faire Titana , this night about the houre of twelue, I will come and meete thee heere, for then I hold it the best time to depart without suspition of any, therfore sweete heart make no delaies, nether for Iewells, or rich aray, least that we permitting this opportunitie, may stay long for the like againe, for I haue all things needfull already prouided. Titana hearing this ioyfull tidings, was exceedingly fraught with boundlesse ioy, thinking that euery houre before night came would prooue a yeere, in so much that the time being appointed, and tearefull to be espied in their priuate parley, after many louely enterchanges, and sweete eclipsed lips, they parted, where weele leaue them a while ruminating on their ensuing fortunes, and turne to Pirismus . Who now is prouiding Roabs for the Nuptiall, which I doubt will prooue his funerall, yet loue being so vrgent with him, it casts a mist before the eies of his folly, in so much, that he thinkes euery smile that Titana lends him, is a promise of perfection: but alasse poore foole, that such infancie should rest in such experienced yeeres: but tis not to be maruelled at, for Cupid doth greater miracles then this some times, for hee forceth the bond slaue to loue, and blinds his eies with folly: he makes the yong old, and the old become yong againe; hee cleares the ageds eies, and makes the youthfull dim: therefore blame I not Pirismus , nor yet commend him, but as hee deserues, so let fortune attribute her fauours vnto him, where weele leaue him a spectator to his aduerse hopes, and turne to Titana : Who being mindfull of her promise to Theseus , assoone as the Court was quiet, and euery man betooke him to his rest, Titana very carefully had respect that none might see, nor heare her, stayed till the deade time of the night, which was much about the houre that Theseus had appointed her to come: she hearing no noise, nor seeing no light throughout all the Court, hauing a doore that opened into the Garden, she secretly vnlocks it, and away she goes to the wonted place, where she finds Theseus attending her comming, and without any great circumstance tooke her by the arme, and led her foorth at a backe gate that Titana had giuen him the key on before, where his man Iunia stayed his comming with his Gelding: he suddenly mounted on his horse backe, tooke Titana vp behind him, and rode to the hauen where the ship lay, which was about a mile distant from that place; he no sooner came there, but the Marriners were readie with their Cock-boate to receiue them aboard: where being coucht together in a Cabbin, they past away the time in recounting their old loues, till their man Iunia came: he had no sooner boarded the ship, but the Marriners hoisting their mainsailes, weighed anchors & hailed into the deepe, where weele leaue them to ye fauour of the winde and the Seas, and returne to Meleagar , and the Bridegrome Pirismus . The morne being come, and Phoebus saluted the day with his glorious Beames: Pirismus starts him from the imbracements of his bed, to rouse Titana from her nightly couch; he being entred her chamber, and saw she was stirring before him and forsaken her chamber, he thus beganne: What hungry fiend, or croaking night worme, durst bee so bold as to disturbe my Titana from her rest, till I Pirismus gaue her the Bon Iour . What lowing Beast, or bleating Lamb-kin, durst attempt my loue Titanes vnrest, before that I bestowed the mornings Salutation on her. What Sithian sheepheard durst be so bold, with his hoopes and cries, to fright my Titana from her natiue sleepe, before I enterchanged a kisse with her, to imbrace this Nuptiall morne? What Indian Rauens, and Grecian Larkes, what Canarie-Finch, or siluer Swanes durst with their harmoniall tunes intice my loue from foorth her bed before I came? But yet me thinkes, I feele no hate proceede from fourth their chirping blasts, therefore surely thou dost misconceiue them: for thy loue is gone to recreate her selfe in the Garden this fresh morne: and is espied by these louing creatures; and to adorne her, and her Nuptiall, they all accord, striking the sweete relaces of their consorted tunes, to giue the heauens an Eccho of their ioy, and thy Titana the harmonie of so happie a day. When he had thus passioned a while, he was returning foorth of her chamber againe, euen as he was parting, comes Meleagar , calling hastily for his Daughter Titana , and meeting Pirismus , asked him for Titana , who answered, she was not in her chamber: Meleagar returning againe enquired, and sent about the Court & Garden to seeke her, but no newes could be heard of her, in so much that in the end Meleagar beganne to feare some ill was betide her, and that she had beene walking late, and so was taken by some of Aegeus men and kept prisoner: well this conceit tooke such effect, that he sends Embassadors to Aegeus Court, to demaund the question if Titana were taken prisoner by any of his Souldiers, who had an answere no: returning againe, told Meleagar their answere: they had no sooner deliuered their message, but their comes a post from Aegeus Court, to demaund if they had not taken Theseus prisoner, the which had his answere deliliuered him, in the same manner, no: which done, he returnes againe. Meleagar , who thought to haue feasted, and made a triumphant Nuptiall; nowe cast off his sumptuous Roabs, and put on mourning weeds, and in steed of delicious feasting, imbraceth mournfull fasting: Pirismus , who fed on the beautie of Titana , as the Camelian feeds on the aire, was franticke, at this sudden extasie. Ambrosa from his aged eies shed many teares, to see Meleagar so grieued, and his Sonne so impatient: the guests that were inuited, at this sudden change were cast into dumps, and dull perplexities, in so much that you might haue past through the Court, too and fro, and hardly haue heard a word spoken, but haue seene many a weeping eie, which held for the space of foure daies; the fift day he caused proclamation to be made, that whosoeuer could but bring tidings where Titana is, or what is become of her, he would bestow a liuing on him worth a hundred pound a yeare, induring his life: this being proclaimed, at that time, there was a Sailer that should haue gone in the ship with them, but hee had some hindrance, hee being foorth of the ship when Theseus and Titana boarded it, he staide some thing long, and Theseus and his loue, thought it seuen yeere till they were put from the shore, least fortune should chance to bewray their pretence, he would stay no longer, but commanded them to put off and lanch into the deepe: so that this Sailer was left behind, and hearing this great promise of the King, determined to goe instantly, and informe the King of his departure: but you must note this, hee did it more for the benefit of the liuing, then to certifie the King: hee being arriued at the Court, made meanes to come to the speech of the King, hee being in presence, did his dutie, and as farre as hee could hee vnfoulded the matter, in euery point: the King hearing how it was, and that she was gone with Theseus , beganne to be in an exceeding great rage, in so much that the Sayler wisht himselfe fourth of his presence, though he neuer had his gift: yet the King being a noble Prince, bestowed his promise on him, and sent him away a ioyfull man. Meleagar , though he heard tidings of his Daughter, yet could it no whit perswade him to patience, but rather kindled the hot fire of warre against Aegeus for a reuenge, because he had but one only daughter, and she to be carried away by an enemies sonne. Aegeus missing his sonne Theseus , and hearing that he was gone with Meleagars daughter Titana , besware a bloudie reuenge on Meleagar : and thus the two fathers fell into bloudy passions, in so much that all Achaia Calidon , and Greece were vp in armes against each other, where weele them a while, and turne to Pirismus . Who hearing of the ingratefull departure of Titana , presently betakes him to his chamber, where he sate ruminating on her, and her departure with Theseus , in so much that hee perswaded himselfe neuer to returne to Portugall againe sith Titana had deceiued him: well, he being as it were halfe franticke, grew carelesse what became of himselfe, and in this discontented humour sitting alone in his chamber, thus breathed out his passions: Titanaes loue, did lend thee life, Titanaes hate, will cause thy death: Titanaes parting, hath sharpt the knife, That now must stop thy vitall breath. Titana farwell, for loue I die, As here these lines, will testifie. When he had thus passioned a while, he drawes his fatall Engine, and stabs himselfe: when Meleagar and Ambrosa were sitting at dinner, Pirismus was called for, but he could not be found, in the end they lookt in his chamber, where they found him most grieuously murdered: news was presently carried to the Kings table, who hearing of this pittious tidings, caused him to be brought into the presence, and sent for Doctors, and Surgions, but all in vaine, for he was quite gone, and past all recouery: they seeing no helpe, caused preparation for the funerall, which all things being in a readinesse, those neighbour Princes which were inuited to the Nuptiall, were now intreated to his funerall: these solemne obsequies, and funerall being ended, euery man tooke his leaue, and departed: but Ambrosa stayed, till the beginning of the next moneth, and when the time came, he departed towards Portugall , with a heauier heart then he came towards Greece : withall, when he had taken his leaue of Meleagar , he boarded the Fleete, weighed anchors, and away they cut through the deepe, where weele leaue him and turne to Titana , and Theseus . Whom fortune beginnes to sport her selfe, in their aduersities, for as she had smiled on them a while, and giuen them a full winde fitting to transport them to the hauen of their desire: so now she meant to frowne on them, and giue them a Calme; when as they lay thus becalmed, fortune who loues to sport her selfe in the variable accidents of loue, brought it thus to passe: certaine Gallies that were Robbers vnder the french King, espied this Grecian ship, and thinking to haue some rich prize, made out, and gaue onset, commanding them to yeeld: the Grecians being calme could not make away from them yet although too weake, Theseus stoutly denied to bee boarded, and fought it out to the vtmost: yet in the end they boarded the ship, and bestowed Titana and Theseus vnder the hatches amongst the Saylers and then rifled the ship of all their rich Iewells: which done, they tooke the Saylers and caried them into the Gallies, and chained them fast, and made Galli-slaues of them, when they had so done, they tooke Theseus into one of the Gallies, but the chiefe commanded that they should offer no rigor at all vnto him, for hee saw by his behauiour, that he was of good birth and parentage, which made him the more fauourable vnto him. Theseus desired of the generall that he would entertaine or suffer Titana to come into the Gallie to him, and fare as he fared, they both desired, and intreated, but it could not be granted, which caused poore Titanaes eies all blubbered with teares, and almost dead for feare, and griefe, but all would not preuaile: the chiefe generall sent halfe a dousen shakerags with the ship and her to Rome , where they stript her out of her Princely robes, and put her into beggers Ragges, and when they came to the shore, they gaue her three duckets and turned her off there in a strang Countrie, that she neither knew their Language, nor had she any friends there: but sith her fortune was so alotted vnto her, for her owne part she tooke it very patiently, but when she called to minde her Theseus she wept bitterly, but sith there was no remedie, she meant to passe, and spend her life in Pilgrimage, where weele leaue her trauelling towards Italie , and turne to Theseus : Whose chiefe soliciter is carefull griefe, for his poore loue Titana , and is forcst to liue as a rouing Pirate on the seas: it hapned about sixe moneths after they chancst to meete with some Merchants of Venice , on whom these Pirates gaue onset, these Merchants being well prouided, breathed destance on them, at which these Pirates tooke great disdaine and discharged vpon them, the Merchants seeing that, beganne to play vpon them, Peece, after Peece, so long that in the end, they ouercame them, and tooke two of their Gallies: in which two, Theseus and Iunia were Prisoners in: fortune fauouring Theseus for Titanaes sake, beare her Target of defence before him, that he escapt with life, but Iunia was slaine, when the Merchants had thus rifled the Gallies, being neere the coast of Bohemia , sent the Gallie-slaues, and others that were Prisoners in the Gallies, to the shores side, and set them a land to shift for themselues then had Theseus but halfe a Ducket to buy him meate  & drinke, and his cloathes were but simple Ragges God knowes, yet glad he was that he was so happily landed, but yet poore Titana , the very thought of her, strake him halfe dead, hee determined neuer to returne vnlesse he met with his loue Titana , but would spend his life in Pilgrimage till death claimed his right: where weele leaue him trauelling into Germanie , and turne to Meleagar . Who is in the field with with troupes of Souldiers, waging warre against Egeus : but his mother enuying him, for killing her two Brothers, Plexipus , and Toxie , had sworne on him to be reuenged, yet studied she a long time, and knew not how to be cruell inough in her reuenge, till in the end, shee called to minde a brand that the destinies put in the fire, when she lay in child-bed of Meleagar : which brand was of this mercilesse force, and power, by the destinies charmes, that when this brand was in the fire burnt, Meleagar should consume and burne to ashes, for the destinies spunne his fatall threed at his birth day, and did put this brand in the fire, to take him the first day of his birth: but Althoea , to preuent it, tooke it foorth againe, and layd it vp very charitie, till now she meant to make vse of it, as thus. Meleagar , being in the field against Aegeus , in fierce and cruell battell, and hauing giuen an ouerthrow to Aegeus , there was great reioycing, and Bonfires made throughout al Calidon , with ringing Bells, and such like. Thesties Daughter seeing so much woode layde on the fire for Meleagar , and to shew her the loue they beare to the King her Sonne: shee thought whilst the fire was burning to bestow one sticke on him, to shew the hate she bare to him, although she died for company with him herselfe, she cared not, so she might bee reuenged on him: after this bethought her selfe, she stepts to a chest where she safely had layd this brand, and takes it foorth, and with a zeale to mischiefe, stretcht out her fatall arme, and threw it in the fire, which being done, she thus began: Behold yee triple Goddesses Of wrecke, yee Helbounds three: Behold you all this furious fact, And sacrifice of me. I wrecke and doe against all right, With death, must death be payde: On mischiefe, mischiefe must be heapt, On course, must course be layde. Confounded let this wicked house, With heaped sorrowes be: Shall Come ioy his happie Sonne, In honour for the fee: And Thesties morne bereft of his, Nay better yet it were, That each with other company, In mourning you should beare: Now brothers ghosts and soules new dead, I wish no more, but you To feele the solemne obsequies, Which I prepare as now. This sayd. She turnd away her face, And with a trembling hand; Did cast amid the fire, This death-full burning brand. of his mothers crueltie, but following his vrgent occasions, with very attentiue care, it hapned not long after as hee was walking alone to recreate himselfe, vpon the sudden he felt an extreame paine in his belly, it waxt more and more, insomuch, that he did plainly perceiue that his bowells burnt with flames of secret fire, but yet denied he to die, but bare it out with a Princely courage, for it grieued him to die so cowardly without shedding his bloud: yet death being so predominate, and potent ouer him, hee beganne to yeeld, and with sighing sobs, called on his aged father, which with age lay bedred seuen yeares before, and then with griefe departed; then called he on his brother, and his sisters, and lastly on his mather, by this time his paine increased so extreame with the fire, that hee fell therewith againe, and at that selfe-same instant quite extinguisht were they both: and as his body burnt to ashes, the glowing coales his spirit from him drew? Then drooped stately Calidon , both young and old did mourne, the Lords and Commons did lament, and married wiues their hairs like frantickes rent from off their heads, for griefe of King Meleagars death: The folke of Calidon not so sufficed, gathers the ashes of his consumed body, and entombs them vp, and makes a solemne Funerall; nay the blackest dismall day that ere was knowne in Calidon , or Acchaia , and on his Tombe, engraues an Epitaph to this effect. Heere lies the famous King of Calidon , Which for his fame the worlds mirror woone, That Achaian land can say, thoug he be gonne, Foule fall the Author, of this mothers doome: Who passeth by, and chance these lines to read, Curse them that causd Meleagar lie heere dead. Hauing this done, euery man returnes againe to his abiding place. Aegeus hearing that Meleagar was dead, prouided a great boast of men, and marcheth towards Calidon , and ouer-runnes their Camps, and puts their Souldiers to the sword, so that in a short space he gets the chiefe part of Calidon , and still inuades further into the Countrie, and much bloud hath beene spilt, and a great deale more is like to be, but the winter being come, they haue left the field and lie now in Garison till the next spring, where weele leaue them, and turne to Titana . Who now hath spent full foure yeares in Pilgrimage, from Countrie, to Countrie, in very poore manner, and now it was her fortune to come into Germanie , and as she was trauelling vp into the Countrie, she chanst to come to Fuesen , where being late, she purpost to lie there all that night, yet knowing not how to get a lodging, for she had no money, sate downe and wept vitterly: as she thus sate washing her tender cheekes, with salt brinie teares, the high Constable of Fuesen was passing by, and saw a young Maide sit lamenting, and wringing her hands in such grieuous manner, pittied her, and demaunded of her what she was, and of whence; she answered she was a Gentlemans Daughter of Athens: he demanded what she made so farre from home then, and how she came there? the which she answered, that there was a young Gentleman of the same Citie that was in loue with her, and she with him, but their Parents would not giue consent, wherevpon we determined to transport our selues into Spaine , where we both haue friends, and there to enioy the fruition of our loues, as we were passing from Greece to Spaine , we met with Pirats that rifled and robbed vs of all we had, set me on land in France , and carried my loue away, I know not whither: and these, all these, griefes am I possest withall. The high Constable pittied her very much, asked her if she could write, and reade, she answered I, he demaunded if she could sow, she sayd I: quoth the high Constable, wilt thou be content to dwell with me,  & teach my children for a yeare or two, or longer as thou shalt thinke good; Titana being wearie of trauelling, and was a shamed to goe begge, thought she could not doe better then to serue him, till she had gotten mony and cloathes to her back, answered him she was very wel content, if it pleased him to except of her seruice; the which he answered very willingly with all his heart, so be caused her to follow him home, where he instantly stripts her out of ragges, and put her on good apparell, which done, she settles herselfe very closely to her needle, and teacheth his children, that in short time, she grew famous for her womanship, ciuill, modest, and Gentlewoman like behauiour, in so much that she might haue had diuers wealthy and rich marriages, onely vpon the good report that was spred abroade of her, but still she refused all, and would except of none, yet all this time she neuer made it knowne, that she was a Kings Daughter, but kept it close, neuer meaning to reueale it, but still following her businesse, with carefull diligence, where weele leaue her, and turne to Theseus : Who bring in very poore estate, is entertained by the Lands-graue of Heston : and seruing him for space these three yeeres, greatly grew in credite with him, in so much that hee would doe nothing without the aduice of his man Pirigrino , (for so he fained his name to be) the Lands-graue taking such an extraordinarie liking vnto him, (as truely to say the trueth, he deserued the loue of all: (neuer had any Iusts,  & Turnies, but his Pirigrino should be one, I, and still did put them to the foile, whatsoeuer they were that waged against him, in so much, that in few yeares he beganne to be admired of all; not onely for his rare feats at Armes, but also for his Gentlemanlike accomplishments, ciuill, and modest behauiour: that in the end, the Lands- graue beganne to misdoubt that hee came of some Noble desent, and by some discontent parted with his Countrie, and went as a Pilgrime so seeke his fortune: well, it hapned not long after, he tooke an occasion to walke after supper, in a Garden that stoode on the backe side of his Pallace, which meaning to demaunde of his man, what Countriman he was, and of what Parentage; calls for his Pirigrino , and charged him to tell him the trueth of a question hee meant to aske him. Pirigrino maruelling at this sudden charge, answered thus: My dread Soueraigne, as neere as I can I will certifie you with the truth, (quoth the Graue ) but this then, tell of what Parentage thou commest on, and what was the occasion of thy comming into this Countrie? for thou toldst me thou wast a Greecian borne: (Quoth Pirigrino ) my Soueraigne Lord truly so I am, and my father was a poore Gentleman, and the occasion that I came hither was this: there was a Gentlewoman dwelling in Athens whom I deerely loued, and so did she me, I being a younger brother, and had but small meanes to maintaine her, her friends being rich, would not giue consent at all; we hauing but little hope to enioy the fruition of our loues in Greece , prouided a little Barke to transport our selues into Spaine , which being done, as we were passing the Otion, there came certaine Pirates that were rouing on the Sea, and tooke vs, and robbed vs of all that we had; this done, they sent my loue away, towards the coast of France , and clapt me into a Gally, where I was forest to mannange an Ower, till I was releast by a Venetian Merchant, who landed me on the coast of Bohemia , and I purposing to spend my life in Pilgrimage, wandring vp and downe, it was my fortune to come hither, where I fortunatly hapned into your seruice; he thus ending his speech wept very bitterly. The Lans-graue being very sorry to see him weeps and lament so bitterly, demaunded the occasion of his passions, who answered the losse of his loue. Quoth the Lands-graue , come leaue off this womanish weeping, and remaine with me, and thou shalt neuer want for any thing so long as I am able to giue thee: well after these and such like words, they departed to their rest. At that instant, there was attendant in the house of Alphonsus the Lands-graue , a young Gentlewoman whose name was Impio , this Gentlewoman came of very good Parentage, she wishly viewing, and noting the excellencie of Pirigrinos face, presently falls in loue with him, but hauing but small acquaintance, could not tell how to vnfolde her minde vnto him, but this she past the time, for the space of halfe a yeere, and could find no time nor place fitting for to disclose her loue: till at last shee watcht him when hee went to walke in the Garden a lone, and lightly skips after him, he espiing her comming after him, returnes againe and met, giuing her the time of the day, and she the like to him againe, so that in the end there past and repast many questions betweene them: in so much that at last my young Gentlewoman mistrisse Impio , grew so impudent with loue, that she could bridle her passionate affection no longer, but desired him to sit downe on a greene banke that was by them, for she told him that she had good newes to tell him, he being no lesse then willing to heare good newe, according to her desire he sate downe, where suddenly she sate downe by him, where she declares the whole volume of her minde vnto him. Pirigrino hearing her so passionate in her termes, wondred much at these sudden accidents, or what should be the occasion that should prouoke her to such inordinate feakes, which in his conceit ouerflowed the bounds of modestie, yet would he not seeme to resist her for her folly, but mildly perswaded her to be content and pacifie herselfe with patience, for he was already prouided, yet did he humbly thanke her for her good will, but grant her marriage he could not: yet she would not be so answered, but began to prosecute it fresh againe, and like Venus , when she woed Adonis , stroue with him for a kisse, in so much that he ashamed of her folly, flung away from her; Impio seeing him gone, meant not to let him goe so, but on the next morning, she goes to his chamber, and in the like manner begins againe. Pirigrino seeing her, and hearing her in her old tune would not stay, but flings from her in an angrie fume; yet she would not giue him ouer nor let him rest, but still would bee troubling and molesting him, in so much, that in the end, hee told her of her imodestie very sharply, and told her, that if she came any more troubling him with the like matter againe, he would declare her name to his Lord Alphonsus. Impio hearing this hastie checke, and rebuke of Pirigrino whom she loued so deerely, turned now her loue to hate, and as in former time she had sought meanes to get his loue, so now ten times more busie she was, to seeke meanes to destroy his life: Pirigrino who fortune had turned her wheele so often with frowns and smiles, meant once more, to cast him two aduerse perplexities,  & for the better conueyance of it, she brought it thus to passe. At that instant there lay in Fuesen one of the Emperors of Germanie , whom had to Daughter a very faire, and proper young Gentlewoman: this Uirgin being knowne to the Duke of Broonsweeke , and he hauing but one onely Son thought it a good match for him, being resolued in this opinion, very speedily sends Embassadors to this Emperour, to entreate a marriage betweene his Sonne, and his Daughter; the which the Emperor, being very willing, told them withall his heart, and bad them, pray him to come and accomplish it assoone as he could, for his busines would be so vrgent with him shortly, that he should hardly attend their comming else, they receiued their answere, and hasted backe to the Duke their Maister, where they made report of their Embassage, when the Duke heard such ioyfull tidings, with all expedition, he caused preparation for the Nuptiall, which being all finisht, and all things readie, they tooke their Iournie to the Emperours Court, being then in Fuesen . The Emperour hearing they were comming; inuited diuers of the chiefe of Germanie , to the Nuptiall: whereof Alphonsus , the Lands-graue of Heston amongst the rest was one: well, within few daies after the Duke of Broonsweeke arriued at the Emperors Court in Fuesen , this Nuptiall day being past, and their royaltie ended, euerie man taking his leaue of the Emperor departed, onely the Duke of Broonsweeke , the Lands-graue of Heston , and their followers. It hapned in a short time after, Pirigrino being chiefe attendant on Alphonsus ; and Impio on his faire Lady: fortune beganne to turne her wheele and raise an aduerse fate, on poore submissiue Pirigrino , in this manner: this wicked lust sulphering Impio , whose heart was fraught with burning hate, had long studied how she might bring him to disgrace, or take his life from him, because he did reiect her, for her folly: in so much that in the end, she agreed thus; for to inuite him to her chamber to Dinner, where if she could obtaine loue at his hands, it was as much as she desired, otherwise she meant to crie out, and say he would rauish her, and so by that meanes bee reuenged on him: she being profoundly grounded on this hellish pretence, thought it long eare she were acting it: yet she considered this, that if she should doe so, hauing no witnes of it, it was but her I, and his no: and she saw that he was so in fauour, that he should be beleeued before her, therefore to bring her matter the better to passe, shee hires a young man, and giues him fiftie crownes to come and sweare against him: when she was thus prouided of a witnesse, she inuites Pirigrino to come the next day to Dinner. He thinking no hurt nor imagined not the mischiefe she pretended to him, very courteously thanked her, and sayd he would make bold to trouble her: with this answere she returned, and called this young man to her, and tolde him where he should stand to heare her, when she called him; and what he should say: well, this being done, on ye next day according to promise, Pirigrino came to dinner, where they sate all alone, and were very merry all the Dinner time, when they had sufficiently alayd the hunger of there stomackes she tooke away the table her selfe, and had none to attend her at all, which made Pirigrino muse much thereat, when she had thus taken away, and set things in order, she came to Pirigrino , and beganne her wonted tune againe, and againe, but still he denied her; yet would she take it for no answere, but still importuned him for loue, in so much that hee beganne to bee very angrie with her, and beganne to goe foorth of her chamber: she seeing no hope to obtaine loue of him, she sware she would haue his life: she steps to him againe, and thus be sete him Thou faire faced Pirigrino , canst thou denie a Wench that comes of gentle bloud, no vassall nor runnagate, but bred and borne in gentillitie: therefore reade in the margent of my browes and thou shalt see that thy birth is not equiuolent with mine; thou knewest how my Lord & Maister entertained thee but the other day, as a Pilgrime that meant to spend his life in Pilgrimage, and wilt then reiect me that am a Gentlewoman of good account? no, no, Pirigrino ; remember thy selfe what thou wert when thou camst hither, and yeelde Impio loue. Pirigrino bearing her so insatiable in this vaine attempt, began to wrest away from her, whereupon she cried out, helpe, helpe; he will rauish me: with that steps in the young man that she had appointed to beare false witnesse against him, and cries out for helpe too; which suddenly came running in diuers of the Court, and layd hands on him, and newes was carried to the Lands-graue , and the Emperour, of Pirigrinoes fact: Alphonsus very sorrie to heare this tidings, yet would not seeke to excuse him, but suffered him to goe to prison, where he lay for the space of sixe daies, the seuenth, according to the order of their Law, he was had in examination; & for the loue Alphonsus bare him, he would heare the triall of the matter himselfe, that he should haue no wrong: but when he heard how euidently the matter was prooued against him, by this yong fellowes meanes, that came in, and sware directly against him, he was very sorry, and faine would haue spoake for him, but that it was a fact that was so heinous, & not be forgiuen, there Lawes were so strickt against it, when he had thus considered with himselfe, the greatnesse of the offence & the seuernesse of their Law, he held his tongue and suffered the Law, to passe on him, which ouerthrew him, and the sentence of death was pronounst against him, that the next market day, their should be in the midst of the market place, a stake erected; vnto which stake, he must be bound fast with Iron-chaines, and so done, fire kindled about him, and so burne to death: the Law hauing thus past on him, and the sentence of death pronounst against him, they carried him backe to prison, vntill the next market day, in the meane while they made ready the stake and set it in the midst of the market, and when the day came, according to there order they brought him to the place of execution, where was gathered together, two or three hundred to see him executed; hee was so beloued that there was many a weeping eie for him, and cried out to the Shrieffes, saying it was great pittie so braue a man should die for so small an offence, yet they could not doe withall, but caused him to be tied to the stake, which done, they layde straw and faggets about him, and were kindling the fire about him; yet did he smile and laugh on the people, and prayed them to pray for him, the which they did all very hartily, he prouided himselfe to die: euen as the fire was kindling, there came riding by a Knight of Athens by chance, as he was trauelling into France , espying a multitude of people gathered togither, turnes his horse head and rides to the place to see the occasion, when he came neere to the place, and seeing a man bound fast to the stake, beganne to looke very ernestly on him, in so much that in the end, he beganne to perswade himselfe that it was Theseus : thrusts in amongst the people  & thus spake, (Prince Theseus) Theseus suddenly lookt vp marueiling who was that which knew his name so perfectly, looking on this Knight called him to minde, and answered Horatio . Quoth the the Knight Horatio , for so was his name: my Noble Leige, what make you heere thus bound with chaines so neere your death Quoth Theseus I haue beene falsely accused, & now condemned to die. Horatio intreated the Shrieffes to hold backe the fire a little, whilest he went to the Emperor, to certifie him what he was, for he is a Kings Son, & falsely accused. The Shrieffes although they were to haue done the execution by an houre, yet for the loue they bore to him, they puld backe the fire: Horatio gallept to the Emperor & tolde him in few words that hee knew not what, to put a kings Sonne to death vpon a false accusation, with such, and such like words, he roughly bespake ye Emperor, without all feare or reuerence: in so much, that the Emperor sent some of his chiefs attendants with his priuie Signet to fetch him againe, to beare the matter more plainely prooued: the whilst they went to fetch him. Horatio declared what hee was and the occasion of his departure from his owne Country Quoth Alphonsus he tolde me that was the occasion of his departure, but he told me he was a Gentleman, and a youngar brother by this time, the Emperors men came to the place of execution, where they declared his will and shewed the Shrieffes, the Emperors Signet for a signe and token they should bring him to the Emperors Court: when they saw the Signet, they knew it was the Emperors will hee should be brought, then they caused him to be vntied, which when the people heard it, there was such casting vp of hats, hooting & reioycing, as though Heauen and Earth would haue gone together: when he came to the Court hee was examined againe of this matter, the which hee vtterly denied, whereupon the fellow was called againe, that came in against him, and demanded if this man were guiltie or no; he answered I. The Emperor would not beleeue him so, but would make a farther triall of it, sends presently for a Racke, to racke him, till he tolde ye truth: assoone as the Racke came, the very feare, & sight of the Rack, made him fall on his knees & confesse all telling how Impio did hire him to decit & gaue him fiftie Crownes. The Emperor and the Lansgraue hearing this, sends for Impio , who hearing yt her knauery was come out, gets her into her chamber, where she suddenly strangles her selfe with a Towell: she being found there dead in this manner they were all very sorry, and desired Theseus to pardon their hastie & rash Iudgement, the which he freely pardoned: this being past ye Emperor, & the Landsgraue intended to accompany Theseus into Greece ,  & command a Fleete of ships to bee prepared for this Uoyage this news being bruted about, that Pirigrino was a Kings Sonne & of Greece : in so much, that in ye end it came to Titanaes eare who was halfe perswaded yt it was her Theseus , well yet she could not be quiet in minde till she saw him: the next day she made an excuse to goe foorth,  & goes to the Emperors Court & as was entring the court gates she met Theseus, yet not knowing
