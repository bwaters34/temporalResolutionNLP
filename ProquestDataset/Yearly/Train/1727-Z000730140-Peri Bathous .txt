 administer great Occasion of Surprize; the one, that all Dignities and Honours should be bestow'd upon the exceeding few meager Inhabitants of the Top of the Mountain; the other, that our own Nation should have arriv'd to that Pitch of Greatness it now possesses, without any regular System of Laws . As to the first, it is with great Pleasure I have observ'd of late the gradual Decay of Delicacy and Refinement among Mankind, who are become too reasonable to require that we should labour with infinite Pains to come up to the Taste of those Mountaineers, when they without any, may condescend to ours. But as we have now an unquestionable Majority on our side, I doubt not but we shall shortly be able to level the High-landers , and procure a farther Vent for our own Product, which is already so much relish'd, encourag'd, and rewarded, by the Nobility and Gentry of Great Britain. Rules of our Art into regular Institutes, from the Example and Practice of the deep Genius's of our Nation; imitating herein my Predecessors, the Master of Alexander , and the Secretary of the renown'd Zenobia : And in this my Undertaking I am the more animated, as I expect more Success than has attended even those great Criticks, since their Laws (tho' they might be good) have ever been slackly executed, and their Precepts (however strict) obey'd only by Fits, and by a very small Number. of the upper Parnassus ; who taking advantage of the rising Ground, are perpetually throwing down Rubbish, Dirt, and Stones upon us, never suffering us to live in Peace: These Men, while they enjoy the Chrystal Stream of Helicon , envy us our common Water, which (thank our Stars) tho it is somewhat muddy, flows in much greater abundance. Nor is this the greatest injustice we have to complain of; for tho' it is evident that we never made the least Attempt or Inrode into their Territories, but lived contented in our Native Fens; they have often, not only committed Petty Larcenys upon our Borders, but driven the Country, and carried off at once whole Cart- loads of our Manufacture ; to reclaim, some of which stolen Goods is part of the Design of this Treatise. have sometimes descended towards us; and doubtless might now and then have arrived at the Bathos itself, had it not been for that mistaken Opinion they all entertained, that the Rules of the Antients were equally necessary to the Moderns , than which there cannot be a more grievous Error, as will be amply proved in the following Discourse. own Genius to attempt upon new Models , it is wonderful to observe, how nearly they have approach'd Us in those particular Pieces; tho' in all their others they differ'd toto coelo from us. That the Bathos, or Profund, is the natural Taste of Man, and in particular, of the present Age. Man; 'till perverted by Custom or Example he is taught, or rather compell'd, to relish the Sublime . Accordingly, we see the unprejudiced Minds of Children delight only in such Productions, and in such Images, as our true modern Writers set before them. I have observ'd how fast the general Taste is returning to this first Simplicity and Innocence; and if the Intent of all Poetry be to divert and instruct, certainly that Kind which diverts and instructs the greatest Number, is to be preferr'd. Let us look round among the Admirers of Poetry, we shall find those who have a Taste of the Sublime to be very few, but the Profund strikes universally, and is adapted to every Capacity. 'Tis a fruitless Undertaking to write for Men of a nice and foppish Gusto , whom, after all, it is almost impossible to please; and 'tis still more Chimerical to write for Posterity , of whose Taste we cannot make any Judgment, and whose Applause we can never enjoy. It must be confess'd, our wiser Authors have a present End, Et prodesse volunt, & delectare Poetae. Their true Design is Profit or Gain ; in order to acquire which, 'tis necessary to procure Applause, by administring Pleasure to the Reader: From whence it follows demonstrably, that their Productions must be suited to the present Taste ; and I cannot but congratulate our Age on this peculiar Felicity, that tho' we have made indeed great Progress in all other Branches of Luxury, we are not yet debauch'd with any high relish in Poetry, but are in this one Taste, less nice than our Ancestors. If an Art is to be estimated by its Success, I appeal to Experience, whether there have not been, in proportion to their Number, as many starving good Poets, as bad ones? from me to exclude any great Genius 's of Rank or Fortune from diverting themselves this way. They ought to be praised no less than those Princes, who pass their vacant Hours in some ingenious Mechanical or Manual Art: And to such as these, it would be Ingratitude not to own, that our Art has been often infinitely indebted. The Necessity of the Bathos, Physically consider'd. Farthermore, it were great Cruelty and Injustice, if all such Authors as cannot write in the other Way, were prohibited from writing at all. Against this, I draw an Argument from what seems to me an undoubted Physical Maxim, That Poetry is a natural or morbid Secretion from the Brain . As I would not suddenly stop a Cold in the Head, or dry up my Neighbour's Issue, I would as little hinder him from necessary Writing. It may be affirm'd with great truth, that there is hardly any human Creature past Childhood, but at one time or other has had some Poetical Evacuation, and no question was much the better for it in his Health; so true is the Saying, Nasoimur Poet ae : Therefore is the Desire of Writing properly term'd Pruritus , the Titillation of the Generative Faculty of the Brain ; and the Person is said to conceive ; Now such as conceive must bring forth . I have known a Man thoughtful, melancholy, and raving for divers days, but forthwith grow wonderfully easy, lightsome and cheerful, upon a Discharge of the peccant Humour, in exceeding purulent Metre. Nor can I question, but abundance of untimely Deaths are occasion'd by want of this laudable Vent of unruly Passions; yea, perhaps, in poor Wretches, (which is very lamentable) for meer Want of Pen, Ink, and Paper! From hence it follows, that a Suppression of the very worst Poetry is of dangerous consequence to the State: We find by Experience, that the same Humours which vent themselves in Summer in Ballads and Sonnets , are condens'd by the Winter's Cold into Pamphlets and Speeches for and against the Ministry : Nay I know not, but many times a Piece of Poetry may be the most innocent Composition of a Minister himself. It is therefore manifest that Mediocrity ought to be allow'd, yea indulg'd, to the good Subjects of England . Nor can I conceive how the World has swallow'd the contrary as a Maxim, upon the single Authority of that Horace? 2 Why should the Golden Mean , and Quintessence of all Virtues, be deem'd so offensive only in this Art? Or Coolness or Mediocrity be so amiable a Quality in a Man, and so detestable in a Poet? Spirits , who are born with a Vivacit e de pesanteur , or (as an English Author calls it) an Alacrity of sinking ; and who by Strength of Nature alone can excell. All I mean is to evince the Necessity of Rules to these lesser Genius's, as well as the Usefulness of them to the Greater. That there is an Art of the Bathos, or Profund. there not an Architecture of Vaults and Cellars, as well as of lofty Domes and Pyramids? Is there not as much Skill and Labour in making of Dykes , as in raising of Mounts? Is there not an Art of Diving as well as of Flying? And will any sober Practitioner affirm, That a diving Engine is not of singular Use in making him long-winded, assisting his Sight, and furnishing him with other ingenious means of keeping under Water? distinguish'd in the true Profund , as in the true Sublime . And the very same thing (as it appears from Longinus ) had been imagin'd of that, as now of this; namely, that it was entirely the Gift of Nature. I grant, that to excel in the Bathos a Genius is requisite; yet the Rules of Art must be allow'd so far useful, as to add Weight, or as I may say, hang on Lead, to facilitate and enforce our Descent, to guide us to the most advantageous Declivities, and habituate our Imagination to a Depth of thinking. Many there are that can fall, but few can arrive at the Felicity of falling gracefully; much more for a Man who is amongst the lowest of the Creation at the very bottom of the Atmosphere, to descend beneath himself , is not so easy a Task unless he calls in Art to his Assistance. It is with the Bathos as with small Beer, which is indeed vapid and insipid, if left at large and let abroad; but being by our Rules confin'd, and well stopt, nothing grows so frothy, pert and bouncing. Profund of Nature is Gold, Pearls, precious Stones, and the Treasures of the Deep, which are inestimable as unknown. But all that lies between these, as Corn, Flowers, Fruits, Animals, and Things for the meer Use of Man, are of mean price, and so common as not to be greatly esteem'd by the Curious: It being certain, that any thing, of which we know the true Use, cannot be Invaluable: Which affords a Solution, why common Sense hath either been totally despis'd, or held in small Repute, by the greatest modern Criticks and Authors. Of the true Genius for the Profund, and by what it is constituted. this our Art, That whoever would excell therein must studiously avoid, detest, and turn his Head from all the Ideas, Ways, and Workings of that pestilent Foe to Wit and Destroyer of fine Figures, which is known by the Name of Common Sense . His Business must be to contract the true Gout de travers ; and to acquire a most happy, uncommon, unaccountable Way of Thinking. spoil'd by an Imitation of Nature, or Uniformity of Design. He is to mingle Bits of the most various, or discordant kinds, Landscape, History, Portraits, Animals, and connect them with a great deal of Flourishing , by Heads or Tails , as it shall please his Imagination, and contribute to his principal End, which is to glare by strong Oppositions of Colours, and surprize by Contrariety of Images. 3 Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni. His Design ought to be like a Labyrinth, out of which no body can get you clear but himself. And since the great Art of all Poetry is to mix Truth and Fiction, in order to join the Credible with the Surprizing; our Author shall produce the Credible , by painting Nature in her lowest Simplicity ; and the Surprizing , by contradicting Common Opinion . In the very Manners he will affect the Marvellous; he will draw Achilles with the Patience of Job ; a Prince talking like a Jack-pudding; a Maid of Honour selling Bargains ; a Footman speaking like a Philosopher; and a fine Gentleman like a Scholar. Whoever is conversant in modern Plays , may make a most noble Collection of this kind, and at the same time, form a compleat Body of Modern Ethicks and Morality. long been weary of natural Things. How much the contrary is form'd to please, is evident from the universal Applause daily given to the admirable Entertainments of Harlequins and Magicians on our Stage. When an Audience behold a Coach turn'd into a Wheel-barrow, a Conjurer into an Old Woman, or a Man's Head where his Heels should be; how are they struck with Transport and Delight? Which can only be imputed to this Cause, that each Object is chang'd into That which hath been suggested to them by their own low Ideas before. way of thinking to such a degree, as to be able, on the appearance of any Object, to furnish his Imagination with Ideas infinitely below it.

You shall hear a zealous Protestant Deacon invoke a Saint, and modestly beseech her only to change the Course of Providence and Destiny, for the sake of three or four weighty Lines. Look down, blest Saint, with Pity then look down, Shed on this Land thy kinder Influence, And guide us through the Mists of Providence ,  8 In which we stray .--- Neither will he, if a goodly Simile come in his way, scruple to affirm himself an Eye-witness of things never yet beheld by Man, or never in Existence; as thus, 9 Thus have I seen, in Araby the blest, A Phoenix couch'd upon her Fun'ral Nest. prompted by this laudable Zeal, is not able to lessen; hear how the most Sublime of all Beings is represented in the following Images. 10 Sometimes the Lord of Nature in the Air, Spreads forth his Clouds, his sable Canvass, where His Pencil, dipt in heavenly Colour bright, Paints his fair Rain-bow, charming to the Sight. 11 Th ' Almighty Chymist does his Work prepare, Pours down his Waters on the thirsty Plain, Digests his Lightning, and distills his Rain. 12 Me in his griping Arms th' Eternal took, And with such mighty Force my Body shook, That the strong Grasp my Members sorely bruis'd, Broke all my Bones, and all my Sinews loos'd.

Of the several Kinds of Genius's in the Profund, and the Marks and Characters of each. convinc'd of the Truth of our Assertion, that the Bathos is an Art ; and that the Genius of no Mortal whatever, following the meer Ideas of Nature, and unassisted with an habitual, nay laborious Peculiarity of thinking, could arrive at Images so wonderfully low and unaccountable. The great Author, from whose Treasury we have drawn all these Instances (the Father of the Bathos , and indeed the Homer of it) has like that immortal Greek , confin'd his Labours to the greater Poetry, and thereby left room for others to acquire a due share of Praise in inferiour kinds. Many Painters who could never hit a Nose or an Eye, have with Felicity copied a Small-Pox, or been admirable at a Toad or a Red-Herring. And seldom are we without Genius 's for Still Life , which they can work up and stiffen with incredible Accuracy. him! he pours forth five or six Epick Poems with greater Facility, than five or six Pages can be produc'd by an elaborate and servile Copyer after Nature or the Ancients. It is affirm'd by Quintilian , that the same Genius which made Germanicus so great a General, would with equal Application have made him an excellent Heroic Poet. In like manner, reasoning from the Affinity there appears between Arts and Sciences, I doubt not but an active Catcher of Butterflies, a careful and fanciful Pattern- drawer, an industrious Collector of Shells, a laborious and tuneful Bagpiper, or a diligent Breeder of tame Rabbits, might severally excel in their respective parts of the Bathos. Classes, and (the better to give their Pictures to the Reader) under the Names of Animals of some sort or other; whereby he will be enabled, at the first sight of such as shall daily come forth, to know to what Kind to refer, and with what Authors to compare them. 1\.

Of the Profund, when it consists in the Thought. proceed, and the Manner of forming his Thoughts by familiarizing his Mind to the lowest Objects; to which it may be added, that vulgar Conversation will greatly contribute. There is no Question but the Garret or the Printer's Boy may often be discern'd in the Compositions made in such Scenes, and Company; and much of Mr. Curl himself has been insensibly infused into the Works of his learned Writers. himself in the Science; and in like sort should our Author accustom and exercise his Imagination upon the Dregs of Nature. many fathoms beyond Mediocrity. For, certain it is, (tho' some lukewarm Heads imagine they may be safe by temporizing between the Extreams) that where there is a Triticalness or Mediocrity in the Thought , it can never be sunk into the genuine and perfect Bathos , by the most elaborate low Expression : It can, at most, be only carefully obscured, or metaphorically debased. But 'tis the Thought alone that strikes, and gives the whole that Spirit, which we admire and stare at. For instance, in that ingenious Piece on a Lady's drinking the Bath -Waters. 21 She drinks! She drinks! Behold the matchless Dame! To her 'tis Water, but to us 'tis Flame: Thus Fire is Water, Water Fire, by turns, And the same Stream at once both cools and burns. 'Tis the Turn of Thought alone, and the Variety of Imagination, that charm and surprize us. And when the same Lady goes into the Bath, the Thought (as in justness it ought) goes still deeper. 22 Venus beheld her, 'midst her Crowd of Slaves, And thought Herself just risen from the Waves. not knowing herself from the Lady? of which the Poet, Hears his own Feet, and thinks they sound like more; And fears the hind Feet will o'ertake the fore. So astonishing as these are, they yield to the following, which is Profundity itself, None but Himself can be his Parallel.  23 unless it may seem borrow'd from the Thought of that Master of a Show in Smithfield , who writ in large Letters, over the Picture of his Elephant, This is the greatest Elephant in the World, except Himself. beautiful Infant, So fair thou art, that if great Cupid be A Child, as Poets say, sure thou art He. Fair Venus would mistake thee for her own, Did not thy Eyes proclaim thee not her Son. There all the Lightnings of thy Mother's shine, And with a fatal Brightness kill in thine. him, then she would not mistake him; next his Eyes are his Mother's; and lastly they are not his Mother's, but his own. Criticks, Thus Phoebus thro' the Zodiack takes his way, And amid Monsters rises into Day. Wand of Circe , turns all into Monsters at a Stroke. A great Genius takes things in the Lump, without stopping at minute Considerations: In vain might the Ram, the Bull, the Goat, the Lion, the Crab, the Scorpion, the Fishes, all stand in his way, as mere natural Animals: much more might it be pleaded that a pair of Scales, an old Man, and two innocent Children, were no Monsters: There were only the Centaur and the Maid that could be esteem'd out of Nature. But what of that? with a Boldness peculiar to these daring Genius's, what he found not Monsters, he made so. Of the Profund consisting in the Circumstances, and of Amplification and Periphrase in general. chusing and separating such Circumstances in a Description as illustrate or elevate the Subject. astonishing or peculiar. But those that are far-fetch'd, or unexpected, or hardly compatible, will surprize prodigiously. These therefore we must principally hunt out; but above all, preserve a laudable Prolixity ; presenting the Whole and every Side at once of the Image to view. For Choice and Distinction are not only a Curb to the Spirit, and limit the Descriptive Faculty, but also lessen the Book, which is frequently of the worst consequence of all to our Author. some Poets would have soften'd, or past over) hear how it is spread out by the Great Genius.

He even teaches us how to hold, and to make, a Cudgel! Periphrase is another great Aid to Prolixity ; being a diffus'd circumlocutory Manner of expressing a known Idea, which should be so misteriously couch'd, as to give the Reader the Pleasure of guessing what it is that the Author can possibly mean; and a Surprize when he finds it. A waving Sea of Heads was round me spread, And still fresh Streams the gazing Deluge fed. 28 be a gazing Deluge of Heads. You come at last to find it means a great Crowd.

As Virgil is said to have read Ennius , out of his Dunghil to draw Gold; so may our Author read Shakespear, Milton , and Dryden , for the contrary End, to bury their Gold in his own Dunghil. A true Genius, when he finds any thing lofty or shining in them, will have the Skill to bring it down, take off the Gloss, or quite discharge the Colour, by some ingenious Circumstance, or Periphrase, some Addition, or Diminution, or by some of those Figures the use of which we shall shew in our next Chapter. not our Father of the Bathos reduc'd it in every Page? Is there a Passage in all Virgil more painted up and labour'd than the Description of Æ tna in the Third Æ neid. \--- Horrificis juxta tonat Ætna ruinis, Interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem, Turbine fumantem piceo,--- & candente favilla, Attollitque globos flammarum, & sidera lambit. Interdum scopulos avulsaque viscera montis Erigit eructans, liquefactaque saxa sub auras Cum gemitu glomerat, fundo que ex aestuat imo. (I beg Pardon of the gentle English Reader, and such of our Writers as understand not Latin ) But lo! how this is taken down by our British Poet, by the single happy Thought of throwing the Mountain into a Fit of the Cholic. Æ tna, and all the burning Mountains, find Their kindled Stores with inbred Storms of Wind Blown up to Rage, and roaring out, complain, As torn with inward Gripes, and torturing Pain: Lab'ring, they cast their dreadful Vomit round, 33 And with their melted Bowels, spread the Ground. 34 but Empedocles , to fathom the Profund , threw himself into Æ tna : And who but would imagine our excellent Modern had also been there, from this Description? the Thoughts of others; The Second consists in copying the Imperfections, or Blemishes of celebrated Authors. I have seen a Play professedly writ in the Stile of Shakespear , wherein the greatest Resemblance lay in one single Line, And so good Morrow t'ye, good Master Lieutenant. And sundry Poems in Imitation of Milton , where with the utmost Exactness, and not so much as one Exception, nevertheless was constantly nathless , embroider'd was broider'd , Hermits were Eremites , disdain'd was 'sdeign'd , shady umbrageous , Enterprize Emprize , Pagan Paynim , Pinions Pennons , sweet dulcet , Orchards Orchats , Bridge-work Pontifical ; nay, her was hir , and their was thir thro' the whole Poem. And in very Deed, there is no other Way by which the true modern Poet could read to any purpose the Works of such Men as Milton and Shakespear. produce Tranquillity of Mind , (and sure it is a better Design to promote Sleep than Madness) we have little to say on this Subject. Nor will the short Bounds of this Discourse allow us to treat at large of the Emollients and Opiats of Poesy , of the Cool , and the Manner of producing it, or of the Methods us'd by our Authors in managing the Passions . I shall but transiently remark, that nothing contributes so much to the Cool , as the Use of Wit in expressing Passion: The true Genius rarely fails of Points, Conceits , and proper Similies on such Occasions: This we may term the Pathetic epigrammatical , in which even Puns are made use of with good Success. Hereby our best Authors have avoided throwing themselves or their Readers into any indecent Transports. Antagonist in the Polemic way, the true Students in the Low have constantly taken their Methods from Low -Life, where they observ'd, that to move Anger , use is made of scolding and railing ; to move Love , of Bawdry ; to beget Favour and Friendship, of gross Flattery ; and to produce Fear , by calumniating an Adversary with Crimes obnoxious to the State . As for Shame , it is silly Passion, of which as our Authors are incapable themselves, so they would not produce it in others. Of Tropes and Figures: and first of the variegating, confusing, and reversing Figures. Authors the Study of the Abuse of Speech . They ought to lay it down as a Principle, to say nothing in the usual way, but (if possible) in the direct contrary. Therefore the Figures must be so turn'd, as to manifest that intricate and wonderful Cast of Head , which distinguishes all Writers of this Genius; or (as I may say) to refer exactly the Mold in which they were form'd, in all its Inequalities, Cavities, Obliquities , odd Crannies , and Distortions. we shall content ourselves to range the Principal which most powerfully contribute to the Bathos , under three Classes. I. The Variegating, Confusing, or Reversing Tropes and Figures. II. The Magnifying, and III. The Diminishing. Tenderness to our Countrymen and fellow Writers, many of whom, however exquisite, are wholly ignorant of those Languages, we have also explain'd them in our Mother Tongue. as the A Master of this will say, Mow the Beard, Shave the Grass, Pin the Plank, Nail my Sleeve. From whence results the same kind of Pleasure to the Mind, as doth to the Eye when we behold Harlequin trimming himself with a Hatchet, hewing down a Tree with a Rasor, making his Tea in a Cauldron, and brewing his Ale in a Tea-pot, to the incredible Satisfaction of the British Spectator. Another Source of the Bathos is the Inversion of Causes for Effects, of Inventors for Inventions,  &c. Lac'd in her 35 Cosins new appear'd the Bride, A 36 Bubble-boy and 37 Tompion at her Side, And with an Air divine her 38 Colmar ply'd. And oh! she cries, what Slaves I round me see? Here a bright Redcoat, there a smart 39 Toupee. Which consists, in the Use of a Part for the Whole ; you may call a young Woman sometimes Pretty- face and Pigs- eyes , and sometimes Snotty- nose and Draggle- tail . Or of Accidents for Persons ; as a Lawyer is call'd Split-cause , a Taylor Prick-louse ,  &c. Or of things belonging to a Man, for the Man himself; as a Sword -Man, a Gown -man, a T-m-T-d-man ; a White-Staff , a Turn-key, &c. An excellent Figure for the Ignorant, as, What shall I say? when one has nothing to say; or I can no more , when one really can no more: Expressions which the gentle Reader is so good, as never to take in earnest. The first Rule is to draw it from the lowest things, which is a certain way to sink the highest; as when you speak of the Thunder of Heaven, say, The Lords above are angry and talk big.  40 Tho' he (as said) may Riches gorge, the Spoil Painful in massy Vomit shall recoil.  41 Soon shall he perish with a swift Decay, Like his own Ordure, cast with Scorn away. it down , and pursue it as far as it can go. If you get the Scent of a State Negotiation, follow it in this manner. The Stones and all the Elements with thee Shall ratify a strict Confederacy;  42 Wild Beasts their savage Temper shall forget, And for a firm Alliance with thee treat; The finay Tyrant of the spacious Seas Shall send a scaly Embassy for Peace: His plighted Faith the Crocodile shall keep, And seeing thee, for joy sincerely weep. not to omit one Circumstance usual in proclaiming and levying War. 43 Envoys and Agents, who by my Command Reside in Palestina's Land, To whom Commissions I have given, To manage there the Interests of Heaven. Ye holy Heralds who proclaim Or War or Peace, in mine your Master's Name .--- Ye Pioneers of Heaven, prepare a Road, Make it plain, direct and broad ;--- For I in person will my People head; \--- For the divine Deliverer Will on his March in Majesty appear, And needs the Aid of no Confederate Pow'r. which raises so many Images, as to give you no Image at all. But its principal Beauty is when it gives an Idea just opposite to what it seem'd meant to describe. Thus an ingenious Artist painting the Spring , talks of a Snow of Blossoms, and thereby raises an unexpected Picture of Winter . Of this Sort is the following: The gaping Clouds pour Lakes of Sulphur down ,  44 Whose livid flashes sickning Sunbeams drown. gaping, pouring, sickning, drowning! all in two Lines. Thy Head shall rise, tho' buried in the Dust, 45 And 'midst the Clouds his glittering Turrets thrust. Qu aere , what are the glittering Turrets of a Man's Head? Upon the Shore, as frequent as the Sand,  46 To meet the Prince, the glad Dimetians stand. Qu aere , where these Dimetians stood? and of what Size they were? Destruction's Empire shall no longer last,  47 And Desolation lye for ever waste. Whereby Contraries and Oppositions are ballanc'd in such a way, as to cause a Reader to remain suspended between them, to his exceeding Delight and Recreation. Such are these, on a Lady who made herself appear out of size, by hiding a young Princess under her Cloaths. 48 While the kind Nymph changing her faultless Shape Becomes unhandsome, handsomely to scape. On the Maids of Honour in Mourning: 49 Sadly they charm, and dismally they please. \------ His Eyes so bright 50 Let in the Object; and let out the Light. 51 The Gods look pale to see us look so red. 52 \------ The Fairies and their Queen In Mantles blue came tripping o'er the Green. 53 All Nature felt a reverential Shock, The Sea stood still to see the Mountains rock. The Figures continued: Of the Magnifying and diminishing Figures. Object without clouding it at the same time; His Thought will appear in a true Mist , and very unlike what it is in Nature. It must always be remember'd that Darkness is an essential Quality of the Profund , or if there chance to be a Glimmering, it must be as Milton expresses it, No Light, but rather Darkness visible. The chief Figure of this sort is, The Hyperbole , or Impossible , He roar'd so loud, and look'd so wondrous grim ,  54 His very Shadow durst not follow him. The silver Whiteness that adorns thy Neck, Sullies the Plate, and makes the Napkin black. 55 \--- Th' obscureness of her Birth Cannot eclipse the Lustre of her Eyes, Which make her all one Light. Up to the Stars the sprawling Mastives fly, 56 And add new Monsters to the frighted Sky. 57 Behold a Scene of Misery and Woe!

To the same Class of the Magnifying may be referr'd the following, which are so excellently Modern, that we have yet no Name for them. In describing a Country Prospect I'd call them Mountains, but can't call them so ,  58 For fear to wrong them with a Name too low; While the fair Vales beneath so humbly lie, That even humble seems a Term too high. III. The third Class remains, of the Diminishing Figures: And first, The which nothing creates greater Surprize. Under the Tropicks is our Language spoke ,  59 And Part of Flanders hath received our Yoke. And thou Dalhoussy the great God of War,  60 Lieutenant Colonel to the Earl of Mar. Nor Death, nor Hell it self can keep them out ,  61 \--- Nor fortify'd Redoubt. gentle Reader is in Expectation of some great Image, he either finds it surprizingly Imperfect , or is presented with something very low , or quite ridiculous . A Surprize resembling that of a curious Person in a Cabinet of antique Statues, who beholds on the Pedestal the Names of Homer , or Cato ; but looking up, finds Homer without a Head, and nothing to be seen of Cato but his privy Member. Such are these Lines on a Leviathan at Sea. 62 His Motion works, and beats the oozy Mud, And with its Slime incorporates the Flood, 'Till all th' encumber'd, thick, fermenting Stream Does one vast Pot of boiling Ointment seem Where'er he swims, he leaves along the Lake Such frothy Furrows, such a foamy Track, That all the Waters of the Deep appear Hoary--- with Age, or grey with sudden Fear. 63 Now the resisted Flames and fiery Store, By Winds assaulted, in wide Forges roar, And raging Seas flow down of melted Oar. Sometimes they hear long Iron Bars remov'd, And to and fro huge Heaps of Cynders shov'd. Is also a Species of the Diminishing ; By this a Spear flying in the Air is compar'd to a Boy whistling as he goes on an Errand. The mighty Stuffa threw a massy Spear, Which, with its Errand pleas'd, sung thro' the Air .  64 A Man raging with Grief to a Mastiff Dog. I cannot stifle this gigantic Woe, Nor on my raging Grief a Muzzle throw. 65 And Clouds big with Water to a Woman in great Necessity. Distended with the Waters in 'em pent, The Clouds hang deep in Air, but hang unrent. Child. I shall take my Examples from the greatest Master in this way. Hear how he fondles, like a meer Stammerer.

Then the Neck so white and round, (Little Neck with Brilliants bound. ) And thy Gentleness of Mind, (Gentle from a gentle kind )  &c. Happy thrice, and thrice agen, Happiest he of happy Men ,  &c. With the rest of those excellent Lullabies of his Composition. 67 Teach me to grieve with bleating Moan, my Sheep. Hear how a Babe would reason on his Nurse's Death; 68 That ever she could dye!

Sometimes the wrong Case;  79 And who more fit to sooth the God than thee, instead of thou : And rather than say, Thetis saw Achilles weep, she heard him weep. Words ; secondly, in the sober and orderly way of ranging them. Many of our Poets are naturally bless'd with this Talent, insomuch that they are in the Circumstance of that honest Citizen, who had made Prose all his Life without knowing it. Let Verses run in this manner, just to be a Vehicle to the Words. (I take them from my last cited Author, who tho' otherwise by no means of our Rank, seem'd once in his Life to have a mind to be simple.) If not, a Prize I will my self decree, 80 From him, or him, or else perhaps from thee. \------ full of Days was he; 81 Two Ages past, he liv'd the third to see.

I leave the Arts of Poetry and Verse 85 To them that practice them with more success : Of greater Truths I now prepare to tell, And so at once, dear Friend and Muse, farewel. Sometimes a single Word will familiarize a poetical Idea; as where a Ship set on fire owes all the Spirit of the Bathos to one choice Word that ends the Line. And his scorch'd Ribs the hot Contagion fry'd.  86 And in that Description of a World in Ruins. Should the whole Frame of Nature round him break ,  87 He unconcern'd would hear the mighty Crack.

If you describe the Garment of an Angel, say  90 that his Linnen was finely spun , and bleach'd on the happy Plains . Call  91 an Army of Angels, Angelic Cuir assiers , and if you have Occasion to mention a Number of Misfortunes, stile them 92 Fresh Troops of Pains, and regimented Woes. the Figur'd we have already treated, and the Proper is what our Authors have nothing to do with. Of Stiles we shall mention only the Principal, which owe to the Moderns either their chief Improvement , or entire Invention. Than which none is more proper to the Bathos , as Flowers which are the Lowest of Vegetables are the most Gaudy , and do many times grow in great Plenty at the bottom of Ponds and Ditches. A fine Writer in this kind presents you with the following Posie: The Groves appear all drest with Wreaths of 93 Flowers, And from their Leaves drop aromatic Showers, Whose fragrant Heads in mystic Twines above, Exchang'd their Sweets, and mix'd with thousand Kisses, As if the willing Branches strove To beautify and shade the Grove .--- (Which indeed most Branches do) But this is still excell'd by our Laureat. Branches in Branches twin'd compose the Grove ,  94 And shoot and spread, and blossom into Love. The trembling Palms their mutual Vows repeat, And bending Poplars bending Poplars meet. The distant Platanes seems to press more nigh, And to the sighing Alders, Alders sigh. 95 His Robe of State is form'd of Light refin'd, An endless Train of Lustre spreads behind. His Throne's of bright compacted Glory made' With Pearl celestial, and with Gems inlaid: Whence Floods of Joy, and Seas of Splendor flow, On all th' Angelic gazing Throng below. This does in as peculiar a manner become the low in Wit, as a Pert Air does the low in Stature. Mr. Thomas Brown , the Author of the London Spy , and all the Spies and Trips in general, are herein to be diligently study'd: In Verse, Mr. Cibber's Prologues. employ'd in Modernizing and Adapting to the Taste of the Times the Works of the Antients. This we rightly phrase Doing them into English , and making them English ; two Expressions of great Propriety, the one denoting our Neglect of the Manner how , the other the Force and Compulsion with which, it is brought about. It is by Virtue of this Stile that Tacitus talks like a Coffee-House Politician, Josephus like the British Gazeteer, Tully is as short and smart as Seneca or Mr. Asgill, Marcus Aurelius is excellent at Snipsnap , and honest Thomas a Kempis as Prim and Polite as any Preacher at Court. Which is fine by being new , and has this Happiness attending it, that it is as durable and extensive as the Poem itself. Take some Examples of it, in the Description of the Sun in a Mourning Coach upon the Death of Q. Mary. See Phoebus now, as once for Phaeton, Has mask'd his Face; and put deep Mourning on; 96 Dark Clouds his sable Chariot do surround, And the dull Steeds stalk o'er the melancholy Round. While rich Burgundian Wine, and bright 97 Champaign, Chase from their Minds the Terrors of the Main.

Thither the Waves file off, and make their way, To form the mighty Body of the Sea; Where they incamp, and in their Station stand, Entrench'd in Works of Rock, and Lines of Sand. 99 Yon' Armies are the Cards which both must play; At least come off a Saver if you may : Throw boldly at the Sum the Gods have set; These on your Side will all their Fortunes bet. All perfectly agreeable to the present Customs and best Fashions of this our Metropolis. greatly advanc'd and honour'd of late by the practise of Persons of the first Quality , and by the encouragement of the Ladies not unsuccessfully introduc'd even into the Drawing-Room . Indeed its incredible Progress and Conquests may be compar'd to those of the great Sesostris , and are every where known by the same Marks , the Images of the Genital Parts of Men or Women. It consists wholly of Metaphors drawn from two most fruitful Sources or Springs, the very Bathos of the human Body, that is to say --- and ------ Hiatus Magnus lachrymabilis . --- ------ ------.

The Finical , which consists of the most curious, affected, mincing Metaphors, and partakes of the last mentioned. As this, of a Brook dry'd by the Sun.

Lastly , I shall place the Cumbrous , which moves heavily under a Load of Metaphors, and draws after it a long Train of Words. mix'd with the Former. For as the first is the proper Engine to depress what is High, so is the second to raise what is Base and Low to a ridiculous Visibility: When both these can be done at once, then is the Bathos in Perfection; as when a Man is set with his Head downward, and his Breech upright, his Degradation is compleat: One End of him is as high as ever, only that End is the wrong one. Will not every true Lover of the Profund be delighted to behold the most vulgar and low Actions of Life exalted in this Manner?

A Project for the Advancement of the Bathos. discover'd the hidden Sources of the Bathos , or as I may say broke open the Abysses of this Great Deep . And having now establish'd the good and wholesome Laws , what remains but that all true Moderns with their utmost Might do proceed to put the same in execution? In order whereto, I think I shall in the second place highly deserve of my Country, by proposing such a Scheme , as may facilitate this great End. seems nothing wanting but Unanimity among our selves. It is therefore humbly offer'd, that all and every individual of the Bathos do enter into a firm Association , and incorporate into one Regular Body , whereof every Member, even the meanest, will some way contribute to the Support of the whole; in like manner as the weakest Reeds when join'd in one Bundle, become infrangible. To which end our Art ought to be put upon the same foot with other Arts of this Age. The vast Improvement of modern Manufactures ariseth from their being divided into several Branches, and parcel'd out to several Trades: For instance, in Clock-making , one Artist makes the Balance; another the Spring, another the Crown-Wheels, a fourth the Case, and the principal Workman puts all together; To this OEconomy we owe the Perfection of our modern Watches; and doubtless we also might that of our modern Poetry and Rhetoric, were the several Parts branched out in the like manner. have each a strong Disposition to the Formation of some particular Trope or Figure. Aristotle faith, that the Hyperbole is an Ornament of Speech fit for young Men of Quality ; accordingly we find in those Gentlemen a wonderful Propensity toward it, which is marvellously improv'd by travelling. Soldiers also and Seamen are very happy in the same Figure. The Periphrasis or Circumlocution is the peculiar Talent of Country Farmers , the Proverb and Apologue of old Men at their Clubs, the Ellipsis or Speech by half-words of Ministers and Politicians , the Aposiopesis of Courtiers , the Littole or Diminution of Ladies, Whisperers and Backbiters ; and the Anadyplosis of Common Cryers and Hawkers , who by redoubling the same Words, persuade People to buy their Oysters, green Hastings, or new Ballads. Epithets may be found in great plenty at Billinsgate, Sarcasm and Irony learn'd upon the Water , and the Epiphonema or Exclamation frequently from the Beargarden , and as frequently from the Hear him of the House of Commons. Figure, would doubtless attain to Perfection; and when each became incorporated and sworn into the Society, (as hath been propos'd;) a Poet or Orator would have no more to do, but to send to the particular Traders in each Kind; to the Metaphorist for his Allegories , to the Simile-maker for his Comparisons , to the Ironist for his Sarcasmes to the Apothegmatist for his Sentences, &c. whereby a Dedication or Speech would be compos'd in a Moment, the superior Artist having nothing to do but to put together all the Materials. at the publick Expence, a Rhetorical Chest of Drawers , consisting of three Stories, the highest for the Deliberative , the middle for the Demonstrative , and the lowest for the Judicial . These shall be divided into Loci or Places , being Repositories for Matter and Argument in the several Kinds of Oration or Writing; and every Drawer shall again be sub- divided into Cells, resembling those of Cabinets for Rarities. The Apartment for Peace or War , and that of the Liberty of the Press , may in a very few Days be fill'd with several Arguments perfectly new ; and the Vituperative Partition will as easily be replenish'd with a most choice Collection, entirely of the Growth and Manufacture of the present Age. Every Composer will soon be taught the Use of this Cabinet, and how to manage all the Registers of it, which will be drawn out much in the Manner of those of an Organ. or Valiant Officer , of unquestion'd Loyalty and Affection to every present Establishment in Church and State , which will sufficiently guard against any Mischief which might otherwise be apprehended from it.

How to make Dedications, Panegyricks or Satyrs, and of the Colours of Honourable and Dishonourable. this single Consideration, that nothing is of equal consequence to the Success of our Works, as Speed and Dispatch . Great pity it is, that solid Brains are not, like other solid Bodies, constantly endow'd with a Velocity in sinking, proportion'd to their Heaviness : For it is with the Flowers of the Bathos as with those of Nature, which if the careful Gardener brings not hastily to the Market in the Morning , must unprofitably perish and wither before Night . And of all our Productions none is so short-liv'd as the Dedication and Panegyric , which are often but the Praise of a Day , and become by the next, utterly useless, improper, indecent and false. This is the more to be lamented, inasmuch as they are the very two Sorts whereon in a manner depends that Gain or Profit , which must still be remember'd to be the whole end of our Writers and Speakers. composing them; after which we will teach a short Way to Epick Poetry . And these being confessedly the Works of most Importance and Difficulty, it is presum'd we may leave the rest to each Author's own Learning or Practice. Custom or Title ; The Publick are better Judges of what is honourable, than private Men. The Virtues of great Men, like those of Plants, are inherent in them whether they are exerted or not; and the more strongly inherent the less they are exerted; as a Man is the more rich the less he spends. virtuous by their Posts ; liberal and generous upon the Publick Money , provident upon Parliamentary Supplies , just by paying Publick Interest , couragious and magnimous by the Fleets and Armies , magnificent upon the Publick Expenses , and prudent by Publick Success . They have by their Office , a Right to a share of the Publick Stock of Virtues; besides they are by Prescription immemorial invested in all the celebrated Virtues of their Predecessors in the same Stations , especially those of their own Ancestors. As to what are commonly call'd the Colours of Honourable and Dishonourable , they are various in different Countries: In this they are Blue, Green and Red : But for as much as the Dirty we owe to the Publick doth often require that we should put some things in a strong Light, and throw a Shade over others; I shall explain the Method of turning a vicious Man into a Hero. consists in converting Vices into their bordering Virtues. A man who is a Spendthrift and will not pay a just Debt, may have his Injustice transform'd into Liberality, Cowardice may be metamorphos'd into Prudence; Intemperance into good Nature and good Fellowship, Corruption into Patriotism, and Lewdness into Tenderness and Facility. endu'd with any Virtue, the more need he has to have it plentifully bestow'd, especially those good Qualities of which the World generally believes he hath none at all: For who will thank a Man for giving him that which he has? ever to remark, that whose loseth his Place, or becomes out of Favour with the Government, hath forfeited his Share of Publick Praise and Honour . Therefore the truly publick-spirited Writer ought in Duty to strip him whom the Government has stripp'd: Which is the real poetical Justice of this Age. For a full Collection of Topics and Epithets to be used in the Praise and Dispraise of Ministerial and Unministerial Persons, I refer to our Rhetorical Cabinet ; concluding with an earnest Exhortation to all my Brethren, to observe the Precepts here laid down; the Neglect of which hath cost some of them their Ears in a Pillory. A Receipt to make an Epic Poem. capable of. They have already laid down many mechanical Rules for Compositions of this Sort, but at the same time they cut off almost all Undertakers from the Possibility of ever performing them; for the first Qualification they unanimously require in a Poet, is a Genius . I shall here endeavour (for the Benefit of my Countrymen) to make it manifest, that Epick Poems may be made without a Genius , nay without Learning or much Reading. This must necessarily be of great Use to all those who confess they never Read , and of whom the World is convinc'd they never Learn . What Moliere observes of making a Dinner, that any Man can do it with Money , and if a profess'd Cook cannot do it without he has his Art for nothing; the same may be said of making a Poem, 'tis easily brought about by him that has a Genius, but the Skill lies in doing it without one. In pursuance of this End, I shall present the Reader with a plain and certain Recipe , by which any Author in the Bathos may be qualified for this grand Performance. Geffry of Monmouth or Don Belianis of Greece ) those Parts of Story which afford most Scope for long Descriptions : Put these Pieces together, and throw all the Adventures you fancy into one Tale . Then take a Hero. whom you may chuse for the Sound of his Name, and put him into the midst of these Adventures: There let him work , for twelve Books; at the end of which you may take him out, ready prepared to conquer or to marry ; it being necessary that the Conclusion of an Epick Poem be fortunate. no way involve your Hero; or any unfortunate Accident that was too good to be thrown away; and it will be of Use, apply'd to any other Person; who may be lost and evaporate in the Course of the Work, without the least Damage to the Composition. sure you strain them sufficiently. most celebrated Heroes of Antiquity; if they will not be reduced to a Consistency , lay 'em all on a Heap upon him. But be sure they are Qualities which your Patron would be thought to have; and to prevent any Mistake which the World may be subject to, select from the Alphabet those Capital Letters that compose his Name, and set them at the Head of a Dedication before your Poem. However, do not absolutely observe the exact Quantity of these Virtues, it not being determin'd whether or no it be necessary for the Hero of a Poem to be an honest Man . For the Under-Characters , gather them from Homer and Virgil , and change the Names as occasion serves. into two equal Parts, and keep Jupiter in the middle. Let Juno put him in a Ferment, and Venus mollify him. Remember on all occasions to make use of Volatile Mercury . If you have need of Devils, draw them out of Milton's Paradise , and extract your Spirits from Tasso . The Use of these Machines is evident; for since no Epick Poem can possibly subsist without them, the wisest way is to reserve them for your greatest Necessities. When you cannot extricate your Hero by any human means, or your self by your own Wit, seek Relief from Heaven, and the Gods will do your business very readily. This is according to the direct Prescription of Horace in his Art of Poetry. Nec Deus intersit, nist dignus vindice Nodus Inciderit .--- That is to say, A Poet should never call upon the Gods for their Assistance, but when he is in great Perplexity. them together in one Verse: Add to these of Rain, Lightning and of Thunder (the loudest you can) quantum sufficit . Mix your Clouds and Billows well together 'till they foam, and thicken your Description here and there with a Quicksand. Brew your Tempest well in your Head, before you set it a blowing.

A Project for the Advancement of the Stage. so great and so lucrative a Part of Poetry. But this Province is so well taken care of, by the present Managers of the Theatre, that it is perfectly needless to suggest to them any other Methods than they have already practis'd for the Advancement of the Bathos. and humble Thanks to the Most August Mr. B-t-n B-th , the Most Serene Mr. W-ll-m W-lks , and the Most Undaunted Mr. C-ll-y C-bb-r ; of whom, let it be known when the People of this Age shall be Ancestors , and to all the Succession of our Successors , that to this present day they continue to Out-do even their own Out-doings : And when the inevitable Hand of sweeping Time shall have brush'd off all the Works of To day , may this Testimony of a Co-temporary Critick to their Fame, be extended as far as To-morrow! added, it is that more ample and comprehensive Scheme which Mr. D-nn-s and Mr. Gildon , (the two greatest Criticks and Reformers then living) made publick in the Year 1720. in a Project sign'd with their Names, and dated the 2d of February . I cannot better conclude than by presenting the Reader with the Substance of it. 1\. It is propos'd that the two Theatres be incorporated intoone Company; that the Royal Academy of Musick be added to them as an Orchestra ; and that Mr. Figg with his Prize-fighters, and Violante with the Rope-dancers, be admitted in Partnership. 2\. That a spacious Building be erected at the Publick Expence, capable of containing at least ten thousand Spectators, which is become absolutely necessary by the great addition of Children and Nurses to the Audience, since the new Entertainments. That there be a Stage as large as the Athenian , which was near ninety thousand Geometrical Paces square, and separate Divisions for the two Houses of Parliament , my Lords the Judges , the honourable the Directors of the Academy , and the Court of Aldermen , who shall all have their Places frank. 3\. If Westminster Hall be not allotted to this Service, (which by reason of its Proximity to the two Chambers of Parliament above mention'd, seems not altogether improper;) it is left to the Wisdom of the Nation whether Somerset House may not be demolish'd, and a Theatre built upon that Scite, which lies convenient to receive Spectators from the County of Surrey , who may be wasted thither by Water- Carriage, esteem'd by all Projectors the cheapest whatsoever. To this may be added, that the River Thames may in the readiest manner convey those eminent Personages from Courts beyond the Seas, who may be drawn either by Curiosity to behold some of our most celebrated Pieces, or by Affection to see their Countrymen the Harlequins and Eunuchs; Of which convenient notice may be given for two or three Months before, in the Publick Prints. 4\. That the Theatre abovesaid be environ'd with a fair Quadrangle of Buildings, fitted for the Accommodation of decay'd Criticks and Poets ; out of whom Six of the most Aged (their Age to be computed from the Year wherein their first Work was publish'd) shall be elected to manage the Affairs of the Society, provided nevertheless that the Laureat for the time being, may be always one. The Head or President over all, (to prevent Disputes, but too frequent among the Learned) shall be the oldest Poet and Critick to be found in the whole Island. 5\. The Male-Players are to be lodg'd in the Garrets of the said Quadrangle, and to attend the Persons of the Poets , dwelling under them, by brushing their Apparel, drawing on their Shoes, and the like. The Actresses are to make their Beds, and wash their Linnen. 6\. A large Room shall be set apart for a Library , to consist of all the modern Dramatick Poems, and all the Criticisms extant. In the midst of this Room shall be a round Table for the Council of Six to fit and deliberate on the Merits of Plays . The Majority shall determine the Dispute; and if it should happen that three and three should be of each Side, the President shall have a casting Voice , unless where the Contention may run so high as to require a Decision by Single Combat. 7\. It may be convenient to place the Council of Six in some conspicuous Situation in the Theatre, where after the manner usually practised by Composers in Musick, they may give Signs (before settled and agreed upon) of Dislike or Approbation. In consequence of these Signs the whole Audience shall be requir'd to clap or hiss , that the Town may learn certainly when and how far they ought to be pleas'd. 8\. It is submitted whether it would not be proper to distinguish the Council of Six by some particular Habit or Gown of an honourable Shape and Colour, to which might be added a square Cap and a white Wand. 9\. That to prevent unmarried Actresses making away with their Infants, a competent Provision be allow'd for the Nurture of them, who shall for that reason be deem'd the Children of the Society ; and that they may be educated according to the Genius of their Parents, the said Actresses shall declare upon Oath (as far as their Memory will allow) the true Names and Qualities of their several Fathers. A private Gentleman's Son shall at the Publick Expence be brought up a Page to attend the Council of Six . A more ample Provision shall be made for the Son of a Poet ; and a greater still for the Son of a Critick. 10\. If it be discover'd that any Actress is got with Child, during the Interludes of any Play, wherein she hath a part, it shall be reckon'd a neglect of her Business, and she shall forfeit accordingly. If any Actor for the future shall commit Murder , except upon the Stage, he shall be left to the Laws of the Land; the like is to be understood of Robbery and Theft . In all other Cases, particularly in those of Debt , it is propos'd that this, like the other Courts of Whitehall and St. James 's, may be held a Place of Priviledge And whereas it has been found, that an Obligation to satisfy paultry Creditors has been a discouragement to Men of Letters , if any Person of Quality or others shall send for any Poet or Critick of this Society to any remote Quarter of the Town, the said Poet or Critick shall freely pass and repass without being liable to an Arrest. 11\. The fore-mention'd Scheme in its several Regulations may be supported by Profits arising from every third Night throughout the Year. And as it would be hard to suppose that so many Persons could live without any Food (tho' from the former Course of their Lives, a very little will be sufficient) the Masters of Calculation will, we believe, agree, that out of those Profits, the said Persons might be subsisted in a sober and decent manner. We will venture to affirm farther, that not only the proper Magazines of Thunder and Lightning, but Paint, Diet-Drinks, Spitting-Pots , and all other Necessaries of Life , may in like manner fairly be provided for. 12\. If some of the Articles may at first view seem liable to Objections, particularly those that give so vast a Power to the Council of Six (which is indeed larger than any intrusted to the Great Officers of State) this may be obviated, by swearing those Six Persons of his Majesty's Privy Council, and obliging them to pass every thing of Moment previously at that most honourable Board.
