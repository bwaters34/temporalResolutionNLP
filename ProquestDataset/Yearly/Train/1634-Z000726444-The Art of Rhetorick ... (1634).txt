 he cannot be perfect. Indeed it is very rare to finde a man skilfull in Rhetorick, who is not so in Logick and Grammar; yet I have read some sermon- books stuft with Tropes and Figures, which doubtlesse with a good deliverie would please, yet were very barren of solid matter. Now because these arts commonly met in a professed Oratour, those that formerly wrote Rhetoricks, 3 put in the Topicks of Logick and Figures of 4 Grammar, as essentiall parts of Rhetorick. Therefore must the learner, in any pleasing passages of words, diligently consider to which of these severall arts every vertue in them is to be ascribed. For whose help herein, if this work take, I will annex in future editions an Appendix of all grammaticall figures. Again, I say not, the parts of Rhetorick are Elocution and Pronunciation; for both these are but utterance, and neither implie the gesture: as for that their common acceptation is equivalent with the terms I give, this were tolerable in case of necessity, not where more significant may be had. Secondly, I presume, I need not excuse giving of English names, having put the known names in the Margent, and used them in my Comment: as for changing those names, good reason. For 5 Tropes and Figures were distinguished by names that had no difference, as Metonymia and Metaphora are both Translation, which is a name generall enough for all the Tropes: neither can I think it but preposterous, to speak of affections of Tropes before the Tropes themselves; which perhaps they did, that the examples wherein affections were, might be more fully apprehended, though I suppose so much at once would rather puzzle the learner. Thirdly, I thought it strange, that Rhetoricians should be fain to define Metonymia and Synechdoche, as Plato did a man, by couching the 6 particulars: nor yet doth their definition of a Metonymie directly teach Elliptick Substitution, nor of the other comprehend the putting of one kinde for an other; yet indeed I found it very difficult to distinguish them. The truth is, that these two are but one Trope; and but for avoiding censure of singularitie, I would have made them one, as I have annexed them in regard of their affinitie. Fourthly, whereas I have made Metonymie twofold, Perfect and Elliptick, I say boldly, that nothing in all Rhetorick doth more puzzle scholars, then not being made acquainted with this difference of Metonymicall examples, how that in some, a borrowed word supplying the place of a proper, we do no more but change again, that is, cast away the borrowed word and assume the proper, and they are resolved: But now again some examples will not suffer a change of the tropicall word for another, but must be resolved by an addition of some word, containing the Cause, Effect, Subject, or Adjunct in a generall term. Instance in this speech , That rock was Christ : They say truely, In the word Christ is a Metonymie of the Subject for the Adjunct. Well, then say I, Resolve this Trope, put out the word Christ , and render the Adjunct, for which it is put , That rock was--- what? If they say , Christ is put for the signe, then I should say , That rock was the signe. But this resolution you see is defective: therefore I must lay both together, the generall term Signe and example , The Pope spurns Emperours Kingdomes off their heads, I need not fetch in the generall term to resolve it by spurns the Signe of their compleat , Spurns Emperours Crovvns off their heads. Fifthly, I averre that I have truely referred Pronominations to Metaphors, for they all carry the force of comparison. Instance, I call an Arch-traitour, a Judas : Now say Rhetoricians, This is by a Synechdoche: for here is Judas, a particular word, put for the generall , Traitour. How unlawfull this predication is, and how insufficient the resolution, any scholar will discern; For Judas by a Synechdoche cannot signifie an Arch- traitour, but simply a Traitour. Now make it a Metaphor, and I have the full meaning. But I will give a more usefull answer: I say therefore, that if this be a Synechdoche, we need no Metaphor; for I can, by as fair a semblance as this, reduce every Metaphor to a Synechdoche or Metonymie. Instance, Luk. 23.43 . To day shalt thou be with me in paradise 7 Shall I say this is a Synechdoche, one place of felicitie being put for another? Yet why may not I as well as Butler, call this speech , They for another. Again, Psal.34.I . The young LIONS lack. Shall I say, is the subject, and fiercenesse and rapine the qualities of a Lion. Yet why not as well as Keckerman calls this speech , Every  8 day is an Holy-day to the idle man, a Metonymie? Because Holy-day is put, sayes he, for a time of leisure and sport, which are appurtenances to an holy-day. Now undoubtedly all these are Metaphors, though Butlers may be catachresticall. But it would save much labour, and prevent a deal of errour, no more but to observe when the words bear the force of comparison; 9 for all such are Metaphors. Rhetoricians have been deceived by a relation Metaphoricall instead of reall. For instance, They Prick up their eares : Let us Break their bonds asunder . In these examples, would Rhetoricians say, are Metonymies of the Adjunct. For , Pricking up the eares is a signe of Hearkening; Bonds , an Adjunct to Authoritie : But say I , Pricking up the eares, is a signe of hearkening in beasts. So God hath no cords , but comparatively; therefore these are Metaphors. Sixthly, I say also, that those examples which I have referred to an Ironie in the latter end of the chapter, are truely referred. And either an Ironie must be made so large (as it well may) to comprehend them, or we must invent another Trope. Synechdoches they cannot be (though some make them so) for they have no relation. Seventhly, I averre also, that Hyperbole and Tapinosis are as flatly different as the names I give them, although the 10 Neotericks make them one. But saith Keckerman , Some Rhetoricians call Tapinosis Hyperbole in defect, but it is better to distinguish them. What? when I call a Meer fool a shallow fellovv ; a vvickednes , an errour ; when I say that is Warm , that shrewdly Burns , & c. do I hyperbolize? do I overreach, and speak beyond my compasse? Moreover, they were too short in not observing that these Affections were often found without being in other Tropes: and so where they found speeches that were meerly hyperbolicall or tapinosicall, they would referre them to some Trope, though without reason. For this speech , I made my bed to svvimme , Dietericus takes for a Metaphor: but I pray you where is the comparison? For put case his bed were born up with waters, it were a plain speech; which being impossible, what is it else, but a notable Hyperbole? Eighthly, I dare professe, that whatsoever Rhetoricall excellencie is or can be in words, is comprised in the Tropes and Figures which I have set down. I have deliberatively read the most eloquent books, besides divers Rhetoricks; yet all the commendablenesse of words I could pick out, would not yeeld a new Figure. How all 11 their examples come within compasse of my Figures, will easily appeare. But some examples I have, which they never paralel'd, and some things their Rhetoricks touch not. It had been easie to have made my book confused and intricate with prolixitie, to have shewed much reading and little wit, and needlesly to have wearied and perplext my reader. If it be objected, that specially in those figures of Repetition, Variation, Allusion, there are various examples, which might have had severall names: I answer, if every phrase, whereunto I could have given a proper term to expresse the form thereof, should have been a Figure, I should have runne in infinitum.  12 And doubtlesse the copious varietie of words (especially in the Greek tongue) hath begotten that difference among authours that sought to open the arts, which being read by the unskilfull, they took them for so many severall Figures, as they found names, and the species of them for distinct Figures: the confusednesse whereof was by the diligence of the studious amended by degrees. And why should not we contract and refine late writers, as they did the former? I have given generall terms whereto all kinde of pleasing speech may be reduced, so that I know no reader, wheresoever he meets with whole heaps of Figures together, shall finde any thing but the spice or composition of what I have mentioned. Ninthly, whereas Rhetoricians give divers rules about delivery, for the turning of the eye, carriage of the hand, setting of the countenance, framing of the voice, &c. I dare say, they are needlesse, insufficient, absurd: for this varies according to a multitude of circumstances, person, subject, place; and these particulars are also various. Onely I have mentioned the Emphasis; and truely, if mine observation fail me not, look what facultie a man hath in giving a gracefull Emphasis, in like degree he hath the gift of the whole delivery. Lastly, I expose my Treatise to the view and censure of the learned, as I have been bold in some things to censure other mens. Whoso will, may examine the matter; and whoso can, may undertake the patronage: although I have imputed faultinesse to theirs, I do not warrant there can be none in mine own. I have spared to mention the worst I found, and think it might be judged pride and envy in me to reckon up the contradictions, curiosities, coincidencies, impertinencies, which are among them. I arrogate nothing to my self in detecting or amending them. I hold it a duty of this age and nation, to 13 leave arts more refined to posteritie, having so abundant helps. For what I have altered, I think I could pick my apologie out of severall authors, whom I found to be hammering upon those very matters, though (not finding a way out) they were fain to come again into the common rode. Indeed I had, besides the advice of my learned friends, the joynt assistance of my brother; and that candle, which we have lighted, we set up to others. Sure I am (Reader) that this facil art hath been found by good wits so imperfectly discovered, that some things were very intricate, some things very frivolous. How difficultly and defectively young scholars have apprehended the notions of this art, all schools have complained. That from the ignorance of Rhetorick (besides many other inconveniences) grosse misconstructions of Scripture have sprung, experience testifies. 14 I was opposed with that place in Daniel , Break off thy sinnes by righteousnesse, and thine Iniquities by shewing mercy unto the poore. I answered, that in the word iniquities was a Synechdoche, the generall word Iniquitie being put for Oppression, one kinde of iniquitie, whereby I cleared the place from seeming to confirm the Popish doctrine of making satisfaction for our sinnes by our works, for which purpose that place was alledged; and shewed, that it did import no more then that speech of Isaiah , Cease to do evil, learn to do well. I will not multiplie examples. Reader, this Tract having been proved and approved, as a sufficient mean to instruct any indifferent wit, that will bestow pains in serious meditation and conference with a scholar in the knowledge of the art, I am bold to commend to thy use, if thou shalt need it; and commit unto thy love, if thou shalt esteem it. Farewell. If thou sayest I have made my gates too big, know I did it that my book might have the better passage. But now I shut them up, resting thine in the hope and endeavour of better services, whereby to work upon mens affections. It hath two parts, Adornation and Action. Adornation consisteth in the sweetnesse of the phrase, and is seen in Tropes and Figures. A b Trope is an affecting kinde of speech, altering the native signification of a  c word. In a Trope are to be considered, 1. The Kindes , 2. The Affections. There be foure kindes of Tropes : 1\. Substitution,   3\. Comparation, ------ 2\. Comprehension,   4\. Simulation. a) That is to say, It is the Art of trimming, decking, garnishing the Oration, with fine, wittie, pithie, moving, pleasing words, clauses, and sentences in the passages and style of speech. b) This word Trope, is as much as to say, a borrowed speech, so that when any word leaves his native, that is, his proper signification, and assumes a borrowed, we say it is Tropicall: Although some speeches are grown so common, that they are taken to be proper; as , Correct me, O Lord, for Chastise me, O Lord, the Effect for the Cause: but so usuall, that few perhaps would note it. c) See Note 6. 15 Substitution is a borrowed speech, by an accidentall  a relation. It is either Perfect or Elliptick. b Perfect Svbstitution is, when the word wherein the Trope lies, is cast away in the  c Resolution. And it is fourefold. 1\. First, of the Cause. 2\. Of the Effect . 3. Of the Subject. 4\. Of the Adjunct or Accident. Substitution of the Cause , is two wayes: 1. First, when the  d Efficient cause is put for the effect. Gen. 4.7.  16 a Sinne lieth at the doore. Ezra 4\. 7. The writing was in the Syrian a tongue.  1\. Tim. 6\. 6. Godlinesse is 17 a gain . So when the Author,  e Principall, or Famous in a thing is used for that which is wrought or brought in by him, or named from him. Act. 21.21. They are informed that thou teachest to forsake e Moses. Psal. 14.7.  18 a Jacob shall rejoyce, and a Israel shall be glad 2\. Secondly, when the Materiall Cause is used for the Effect. Psal. 105.8. He was laid in [illeg]  19 iron. a) Relation is, when a thing in any respect hath reference to another. An accidentall Relation I call that, which continues onely while they are Tropes, or otherwise they are not necessarily considered together; as , Sinne is put for horrour  & punishment, Tongue for language, Gain for gainfull, Moses for the Law, Jacob and Israel for the Israelites, Iron for fetters. Now, there may be sinne, where there is no horrour or punishment considered . Gain may be considered abstractively, that is, by it self, and not in a subject: as there may be vertue, justice, though there were none just; so there may be a tongue without language, as in beasts : Jacob might have been, though no Israelites after him ; Moses, though no Law; Iron, though no fetters. But in Synechdoches there is a true Relation 20 considered, whether they be Tropes or no: the Genus must have his Species, and the whole his parts, and contrarily. These do subsist one in another. In a word, Substitution is from things that have but an affinitie; Comprehension from things that have a consanguinitie. b) Note from this example, that in some Note I. Metonymicall Relations, the Cause and Effect, Subject and Adjunct may perhaps be hard to conceive: for unlesse to scholars, it is not so readie 21 to be apprehended, that gain is the cause of gainfull, though indeed it is: for what makes gainfull but gain? c) The resolving of a Trope is the changing of it to a plain speech: for instance , The writing was in the Syrian language. This now you see is made a plain speech, by putting away the borrowed word tongue, and resuming language, which was meant by tongue. This I call a Perfect Resolution, because I come directly to my word again. d) The Efficient Cause is, whereby a thing is made or done; & the Material Cause, whereof. 22 e) Note that it is one thing when the Principall is considered as the Cause, another as the Subject, another as a Part. Instance , Israel fought with Amalek. If here by Amalek and Israel I mean their succeeding race, themselves 23 being dead, it is a Metonymie of the Cause: but if I mean by them their armies, themselves being at home, it is a Metonymie of the Subject. If I mean by them the Israelites and Amalekites, led by them into the field, themselves being partners in the battell, it is the Part for the Whole. Substitution of the Effect is, when the Effect is used for the Cause. 2. King. 4.10.  24 ? Death is in the pot. Joh. 11.25. I am the 25 resurrection. Substitution of the  b Subject is, when the Subject is used for the Adjunct. Eph. 4\. 22. Cast off the old c man  . Thus the place, or seat, and container, are used for the placed, or contained thing. Psal. 78\. 87. Their d heart was not right, Gen.  6\. 11. The e 26 earth was corrupt before God. I. Cor. II. 26. As oft as you drink this f 27 cup, ye shew the Lords death. a) Death is put for poyson, which is the effect of poyson. b) The Subject is that thing, whereunto something is said to appertain or belong: and the said appurtenance is called the Adjunct or Accident. c) Man is put for nature. d) Heart, for the affections there seated. e) for people. f) for wine. g) I think good here to 28 note, that it will perhaps be difficult sometimes to hit upon a term whereby to resolve a Trope perfectly: for indeed when I first considered of this example, I could resolve it with addition thus , I am the cause or causer of the resurrection; but the term Raiser I could not think on a good while. And at first view I thought these Ellistick also, Exod , 21. 21. Eph. 5.16. Substitution of the Adjunct is, when the Accident is used for the Subject. I Tim 4.16. Neglect not the gift given by the hands of the a 29 presbyterie. Gal. 6.14. God forbid that I should glorie save in the b crosse of Christ  . Thus the Adjunct of time is put for the subject measured by it. Job. 32.7. I said c dayes should speak, and the c multitude of yeares should shew wisdome  . So the signe or f circumstance is used for the thing betokened. Rom. 13.4. He beareth not the d sword in vain  . So also the qualitie is put for the subject. Ecclus. 10.6.  30 g Follie is set in great dignitie. 31 a) First let me note, that in some examples it skills not, which you call the Subject, which the Adjunct: for instance , Let their table be a snare, that is , Let their meat be a snare. Table may be either the Subject or Adjunct. And let 32 me note further from the first example set down, that some Tropes may be variously resolved, according to mens severall judgements. As some may think Presbyterie, here being put for Presbyters, to be the Effect for the Cause; for what makes the Presbyterie, but the Presbyters? though I rather take it to be an Adjunct to Presbyters. b) Crosse, for sufferings, c) Dayes and multitude of yeares, for the aged. Whence note, that the borrowed speech lieth sometimes in 33 more then in one single word. For there is a single word, which Logicians call Vox incomplexa, as Peter, an horse, vertue, gentle,  &c. And there is a double word called Vox complexa, as Peter the Apostle, an horse all white, despised vertue, gentle in behaviour. These you see runne into one, and do of divers single ones make up double ones; so that having said, A Trope is alwayes in one word, I mean not that it must alwayes be in one single word, but sometimes in a double word, which, upon the matter is but one word; as here the double word multitude of yeares, is in purpose no more then the single word Dayes. And as the words of the Trope are sometimes complexive; so also are the words of the Resolution, as in Proverbs, or otherwise . d) Note hence, that a choice word may best befit 34 a Trope, where in the Resolution the same word cannot serve: as Sword is put for Authoritie, being a signe thereof; yet we cannot say, He beareth not the Authoritie, but he hath not the Authoritie in vain: so that in Resolutions sometimes there must be alterations in some joynt words of the clause, which yet agree well to the Trope . e) By signe is meant any token, or resemblance, as the ornament, habit, title, ceremonie, &c. f) See the tenth note. g) That is, the Fool. a Elliptick  Substitution is, when the Cause and Effect, or Subject and Adjunct do meet in the Resolution. This is also, First in the Cause. Heb. II, 39. They received not the 35 b promises. 2\. In the Effect . Gen. 25.23.  c Two 36 nations are in thy wombe. Thus when an Epithet implies a Cause. Psal. 100\. 1. Make a 37 d joyfull noyse. 3\. In the Subject. I. Cor. 10.4. That rock was 38 Christ . And so when that is spoken of the Subject, which is intended of the Adjunct. Deut. 32.10. He found him in the e howling wildernesse. Also when the Subject is put for the Subject so qualified. I. Cor. 16.13. Quit your selves like 39 f men . So when an Epithet implies the signe. I. Sam. 14.2. Put on 40 g mourning apparell. 4\. In the Adjunct. Deut. 9.21. And I took your 41 h sinne, the calf that you had made, and stampt it to powder, &c. Thus when that is spoken of the Adjunct which is intentionally referred to the Subject. Mal. 2.15. She is the i wife of thy 42 i covenant, and the wife of thy i youth. Deut  . 33.2. From his right hand went a k fiery law. a) Ellipsis is as much as to say , a leaving out: I call therefore those Ellipticall Substitutions, wherein some word is left out, and in the Resolution therefore must be added again. It is true, that the defect of words in the language is the cause of some Ellipticall Substitutions: as if there were any word promiseds, the first example would be perfect. It is true also, that a man may resolve some perfect examples Elliptically, if he please; as , Death is in the pot; that is , the cause of death is in the pot: but Ellipticall examples are such, as must of necessity be resolved with addition, so that in the Resolution both the Substituting and the Substituted word are mentioned together, as in the examples following. b) Promises, for 43 fruits of the 44 promises: for they did receive the promises; but the fruits or accomplishment of them was in the time of the Gospel. c) Two nations, for the 45 fathers of two  46 nations. d) joyfull, for 47 joyfull-making  48 . An Epithet is any Adjective joyned to a word to expresse his signification. So here joyfull signifies making joyfull, and so implies the Cause in the word making: for noyse it self cannot be said to be joyfull. e) Howling is here attributed to the wildernesse, and meant of the wilde beasts, which are an Adjunct to the wildernesse: as if you should say, Subject.     Adjunct. Wildernesse of howling beasts. f) Men, for Adjunct.     Subject. valiant men. So we say, Will you come to supper Adjunct.     Subject. with those hands? meaning those soul hands. Adjunct.     Subject. g) Mourning, for signe of mourning. Subject.     Adjunct. h) Sinne, for the subject of your sinne. For it cannot here (though otherwise it might) be resolved perfectly thus, I took your calf,  &c. because of the subsequent clause.i) Here wife is attributed to covenant and youth, which are but accidents to the person: as if he should say, the Subject.     Adjunct.     Adjunct. wife of thee by thy covenant in thy youth, k) Fiery is here given to the law, which is intended of the Subjective place of deliverie; as if he Adjunct.     Subject. should say, The law from fiery Sinai, So you see that Ellipticall Substitutions are but a kinde of half Substitutions, one word being put for more, not one word for another, as in perfect Substitutions. Adjunct.     Subject. 49 1) For signe of Christ. 50 fold. I. Of the Genus. 2\. Of the Species. 3\. Of the Whole . 4. Of the Part. Comprehension of the Genus is, when the  a generall word comprehends the particular. Psal. 72.8. He shall have dominion from the 51 river to the ends of the earth. Comprehension of the Species is, when the particular word implies the generall. Matt . 23. 24. They devoure b widows houses. Isa.  2\. 13. The day of the Lord shall be upon every [illeg.] cedar of Lebanon, and every b oak of Basan. a) A Generall word is that which comprehends 52 singular words under it: as a Beast comprehends an Horse, a Cow, a Lion, &c. A Stone comprehends an Adamant, a Flint, a Peble, &c. So River here, which comprehends Thames, Trent, Tyber, &c. is put for Euphrates. b) They did not onely devoure widows houses, but any sort of poore people; and not onely houses, but any kinde of goods. The Prophet meaneth every Cedar, and every Oak, though he addeth a seeming limitation: & commonly when to a generall 53 word a limitation is added, it makes it particular. If I say , The disciple, for John, it is a Synechdoche of the Genus; but if I say , The beloved disciple, for John, it is a Particular, and no Trope. Note, that sometimes in English, though I cannot directly finde it so in Latine, one particular word is put for another: as Matt. 5\. 33. Whosoever putteth away his wife, except it be for fornication, & c. where fornication, being one manner of Incontinency, is put for another , viz. Adultery. For the married by uncleannesse are guilty of adultery properly, not fornication. So also one part is put sometimes for another. Psal. 16.11. Thou wilt not leave my  54 soul in hell; where soul is put for bodie. Note also, that Rhetoricians make such speeches belong to this Trope, as we finde 2. King. 5.27. He went out of his presence a leper as white as snow. He might (say they) have said, As white as wooll, milk, chalk, & c. so that by snow is meant any white thing. But I rather think this is no Trope, because he is not tied to mean any other thing; nor need I seek any such Resolution of the word to understand his meaning. Acts. 2.2. It filled the whole a house where they were sitting. Thus the plurall number for the singular, Mart. 27\. 14. The same Things also the b theeves cast in his teeth. Comprehension of the part is, when the part implies the whole . And this is five wayes. 1\. When a piece or member is put for the whole bulk or body. Ephes. 4.9. He descended into the lower parts of the c earth. 2\. When a set number is put for an uncertain. Levit. 26.8  d Five of you shall chase an d hundred. Rev.  12.5. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed d twelve thousand. 3\. The singular number for the plurall. Num. 24.22. The e Kenite shall be wasted. 4\. One circumstance for another or more. Deut. 28.30. Thou shalt marrie a wife, and another man shall 55 f lie with her. I. Sam. 24.3. Saul went in to g cover his feet. 5\. One or few of a companie, band, sect, &c. for many, or all. Exod. 17.13. h Josuah discomfited Amalek. a) House is put for chamber. b) Theeves for thief. See Luk. 23.39. c) Earth for world. d) He means, A few of you shall chase many; and by twelve thousand, S. John understands a great number. This may also be referred to a Synechdoche of the Genus; one number being put for another of the like kinde. Much ado there is about the reference of these Synechdoches, whereas indeed it is more triviall then deserving a controversie, there being little excellencie in them, unlesse when they are Hyperbolicall. Some of them need not to be reckoned for Tropes, for like reason that I gave of others in the last note of the last section: as , Twentie good turns will not win the ungratefull; for I may mean just twentie. e) Kenite, for Kenites. f) Not onely lie with her, but defile her: for both these circumstances are intended by that one. g) The action of covering the feet is not intended it self, but expresseth another circumstance , viz. doing the 56 office of Nature. Note, that if that circumstance which is put for another, be a naturall, that is, a necessarie circumstance, which alwayes accompanies the action it intends, then it belongeth to this Trope: but if it be but an accidentall circumstance, with which, or without which the action useth to be done; then is that circumstance an Adjunct, not a Part, and belongeth not to a Synecdoche, which is by a naturall Relation, but to a Metonymie, which is by an accidentall Relation, as I have said: Instance , Prov. 17.18. A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh suretie. Here by striking of hands is meant , gives his word. This circumstance is accidentall, and therefore an Adjunct unto promising: for without it a covenant may be made. h) Josuah is put for himself and his 57 armie. Note, that sometimes those that are but a part by Relation, are put for all; as , Gen.20. 7. God healed Abimelech: the plague that was removed was barrennesse, so that the women onely could be healed; he was of their number by relation meerly. So the Lawyers speak in the cause of their Client, as if it were their own, though meer relation make them a part. And if this seem rather an accidentall relation then a naturall, you may referre it to a Metonymie of the Adjunct, as some Rhetoricians do. Note also 58 that there is an Ellipticall Resolution in many Synechdoches: as, Paul puts the palace indefinitely for Neroes palace. Note again, that 59 there are Synechdoches in Epithets, when that is attributed to the whole, which is intended of the part, or contrariwise: as , What naked and curled gallants are these? that is , What gallants are these with curled hair and naked breasts? So , I opened your letter with doubtful hands. the force of a  a comparison. Jer. 5.8. Every man a 61 neighed after his neighbours wife . Hereto appertain all  b Anthropopathies. Gen.6.6. It b  62 repented the Lord that he had made man, and it b grieved him at the b heart . All Pronominations either from the Person, Nation, or Place. Matth. 17. 12. c Elias is come alreadie. Ezek. 16. 3. Thy father was an c Amorite, and thy mother an c Hittite. Rev. 18. 2. c Babylon is fallen  . Parabolicall and Proverbiall speeches, and all of g like nature. Mark 4.3. The e  63 sower went out to e sow. Ezek. 18.2. d The  64 fathers have eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge. a) A Metaphor is nothing but a comparison drawn into a word. His comparison is drawn from horses, which neigh for lust. b) Anthropopathies are speeches attributing to God according to the manner of men, as properly God hath no heart, neither can be said to repent or grieve; but these things being said of men, God is expressed to us by them. c) Pronominations are proper names that are borrowed, as John Baptist hath the name of Elias for the likenesse of their gifts, being such an one as Elias was. So Israel is said to have the originall from the Amorite and Hittite, from the similitude of their conditions with these nations. So Rome  65 takes the name of Babylon, from the paritie of their manners. d) The fathers have sinned, and the children are punished. e) A preacher went out to preach, &c. g) By such like speeches, I mean any that have a comparative exposition; as mysticall speeches. S. John calls Warre the red horse, Famine the pale horse, Death the black horse. So types, emblemes, riddles, fables, when we use them comparatively. Note that 66 sometimes a speech is borrowed, though but supposed of the thing from whence it is taken: as Psal. 78. 25. Man did eat Angels food. Angels have no food, but as supposing they had, of the daintinesse it was so called. of one thing a man insinuates another, or else derides. I. King. 22. 15. a 68 Go & prosper. I. King.28.27. Either he is a  69 talkking, or he is a pursuing, etc. /job. 9. 25. Whether he be a sinner or no, b  70 I cannot tell; but this I know, he hath opened mine eyes. I. Cor. 3. 4. c Who is Paul? who is Apollos  ? a) As under colour of saying , Go and prosper, the Prophet means the contrary , Go and perish. And that was but a pretended speech of Eliah: for he meant not as he spake, but spake in mockage. b) The simulation which lies in this speech, is apparent from the 31 verse: for the blinde man contendeth to prove, that Christ could not be a sinner: and the speech is like unto this , I know not whether this iron be hot, but I am sure it hath burnt my fingers. So there are Ironies in contradictions , O holy idolatrie! O prodigious vertue! He blushes like a black dog. He quakes like an oven. c) The simulation that lies in this speech is this, that whereas the Apostle, to avoid exception, nameth himself and Apollos, his intent was (as appeareth chap.4.vers.5.) under colour of those names to touch those Ministers whom the Corinthians did too much applaud, and to whom they did ascribe above what was meet: for Paul and Apollos were not magnified amongst them, but rather despised: under colour of these names doth the Apostle tax the preachers they extolled. So that there are Ironies in a Person, as in a Metaphor, when I call an hypocrite a Nathanael, a coward an Hector: or by an Inversion, as , How chance you beat your master to day? Or by Insinuation, as , I am so proud, none of my neighbours may speak to me: or by insinuative Interrogation, as , Was I e're burnt i'th' hand? or by Negation, as , I never took money to forswear my self, meaning it still to him or of him we speak: or by 71 Preterition, as  , I will not tell you how drunk you were yesterday, how you swaggered and staggered, and the boyes flockt about you,  &c. when yet I do tell him thus. So in these speeches , Perhaps you may finde him from the Alehouse. So , He is the wisest man in the town, when all the rest are out; when I mean, He is the veriest fool in the town. So , They were alive, They were rich; when my purpose is not to say what they were, but thereby to insinuate what they are now. So when I say , If I had said so, I had lied; when I intend that he lies in saying so. resolution. These Affections are five: 1\. Abuse. 2. Duplication. 3. Continuation. 4. Superlocution. 5. Sublocution. --- Abuse is when a Trope is very farre fetcht.  72 Heb. 12. 1. Seeing we are compassed with a a 73 cloud of witnesses. Exod. 13.19. Thou shalt not seethe the kid in his a mothers milk. Duplication is, when there is a pluralitie of  74 Tropes in one word. Matth.21.10. All the b 75 citie was moved. Mal. 4.2. The Sunne of righteousnesse shall arise with healing under his c wings. d Continuation is, when Comparation is continued.  76 Matt. 3.10, Every d  77 tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be hewen down, and cast into the fire. 78 Superlocution is, when a Trope is stretcht beyond moderation. By way of amplification, Psal. 119.136. e  79 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, &c. Or by way of extenuation restriction. I. Sam.24.14. After whom doth the king pursue? After a e  80 dog? After a e flea? Sublocution is, when a word speaks below the intention. Matth. 25.24. Lord, I knew thee an f hard man. 81 Note that these two latter Affections are found without Tropes. 2\. Sam. 2.18. Azahel was light of foot as a 82 g wilde roe. Isa.49.2, have laboured in g  83 vain, I have spent my time for g nought. Jude 14. Behold, the Lord h cometh . So also in Sublocution , I. Cor. 10.5. But with many of them God was not i  84 well pleased. Hos. 4.4. This people are i as they that strive with the priest . This Sublocution either in a Trope, or out of a Trope, is when we mean a thing by way of eminencie. Mal. 2.14. She is thy k  85 companion. a) Which you may understand by resolving the severall examples following: for there is found in them not onely the borrowing of the word, but that joyned with a further Rhetorical vertue: as a cloud of witnesses is not onely to be considered as a Metaphor, but as an unusuall, strange, and streined Metaphor, not obvious and congruous. The like is to be said of mother, which is very abusively given to a dumbe creature; yet these abusive speeches skilfully drawn, do adorn much. b) City is first put for Jerusalem, by a Synechdoche of the Genus: and then Jerusalem for the Jerusolomites, by a Metonymie of the Subject. c) Wings is put for beams, a Catachresticall Metaphor; & beams for merits, another Metaphor. d) Rhetoricians teach that Tropes of any one kinde coming together make an Allegorie; yet again they give this rule, that the term of the same comparison may not be changed: as to say, These plants may become corner-stones one day. Now I say, if it spoil an Allegorie, onely to change a piece of it, how can words of no dependance at all make an Allegorie? Therefore an Allegorie is, when Metaphors are continued, or else heaped together in the same comparison; as here tree, that is man; fruit, that is works; hewen down, that is , condemned; cast into the fire, that is , thrown into hell. All these are in one comparison. And in the 12\. of Eccles. From the second verse unto the fifth, there are divers Metaphors, but all upon the same subject, to wit, the description of old age: yet if any will contend, that the prosecuting of particular Metonymies, and will not say of Metonymies or Tropes in generall (as Rhetoricians have affirmed) do also make an Allegorie, I will not altogether gainsay them: for it is indeed comely to continue still Metonymies also of the same kinde: as in this example, it is more pleasing to say , The scepter as well as the sheep-hook must go to the grave, then to leave out one of the Adjuncts, and say , The scepter as well as the shepherd must go to the grave. But I leave it to the judgement of the reader. e) Rivers is a Metaphor; so dog, and flea. f) And Hyperbole and Tapinosis are directly contrary: for that is when we do overspeak, and is ever discerned by a limitation, or restraining, whereby to resolve it in such like words , Nay not so; as , Nay not rivers, though abundance of tears : Nay not a dog, or a flea, though a mean person. But a Tapinosis is an underspeaking, when we mince, or forbear to speak to the full; and is discerned by an assenting, or an enforcing to resolve it by, in such like words , With a witnesse, At least, I may well say: thus here by hard he means a rigorous and austere man, as Luke expresseth it , chap. 19. 21. Therefore well might he say hard. And as there is Amplification, and Extenuation in an Hyperbole; so there is in Tapinosis: as this , A living of an hundred pounds per annum is worth thanks, is Extenuation: But this , This Cure is not worth above an hundred pounds, is Amplification. g) For there is many times this Affection of over or under speaking, when otherwise the words are all plain : As swift as a wilde Roe; there is none of the words borrowed, onely there is an over- reaching in them: he was very swift, but so swift he could not be. So, not altogether in vain, though for little good. h) Here also is an over-reaching speaking in the present time. i) Here is onely an under-speaking. He might well say , Not well pleased; for he was highly provoked. So he might well say , They were like those that contended with the priest; for they were very those. k) The wife is the companion indeed, for she is the mans chief, principall, and nearest companion. A a Figure  is an affecting kinde of speech without consideration had of any borrowed sense. A Figure is two-fold: Relative and Independent. The b Relative figures are six. 1\. Repetition. 2. Variation. 3. Gradation. 4. Correction. 5. Allusion. 6. Composition. --- Repetition is the recitation of somewhat in the sentence, sometimes by Continuation, Judg. 5. 12. Awake, Awake Deborah, Awake, Awake . By Transition, Hose, 2.21. I will heare the c heavens, and the heavens shall heare the earth, and the earth shall heare the corn, &c  . By Amplification, Psal. 145. 18. The Lord is nigh to c all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth  . By Connexion, Isa.3. 24. c In stead of sweet smell, there shall be a stink; In stead of a girdle, a rent; In stead of well-set hair, baldnesse; In stead of a stomacher, a girdle of sackcloth, and burning in stead of beauty. Variation is a pleasant fruitfulnesse of words, added onely for varieties sake. Psal. 14.7. d  86 Jacob shall rejoyce, and I srael shall be glad. Isa. 1.4. A sinfull nation, a people laden with iniquitie, a seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters . And verse 17.  g Relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherlesse, plead for the widow. 87 Gradation is, when the immediate succeeding clauses transcend each other in signification. 1\. John 1. 1. That which we h  88 have heard, and that which we have seen, and our hands have handled of the word of life. Judg. 5. 30. To Siserah, h a prey of divers colours of needle- work, of divers colours of needle-work on both sides. Correction is the reenforcement of the  89 clause last uttered, by the subsequent. Gal.3. 4. Have ye suffered so many things in vain? i if it be yet in vain. Allusion is a delightfull harping upon words. 1\. Tim. 6.6. k But godlinesse is great gain. Matt. 8.22. Let the k dead bury the dead. 2. Tim. 4.2.  ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) .  2\.

As k poore, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. 1 Tim.3.16. God was k manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, beleeved on in the world, received up into glory. Composition is a smooth linking together of select words and clauses. Psal.3. 24. In stead of sweet smell, there shall be a stink; in stead of a girdle, a rent; in stead of well-set hair, baldnesse; in stead of a stomacher, a girdle of sackcloth; and l burning, in stead of beauty. a) The learner must carefully distinguish between a Trope and a Figure; though in our common speech we confound the Terms, and the difference between them is this, that a Trope cannot be without a borrowed sense; but a Figure may be, whether the words are borrowed or proper. Rhetoricians indeed gave this difference, that a Trope was in a word, and a Figure in a clause or sentence; but observe all the examples, and this will be found false. b) These five first I call Relative figures, because in every one of them there is a reference of words which makes the elegancie. The other Independent, because no part of the clause brings in another; but the whole clause is joyntly & independently considered. c) These examples of Repetition, though they be of severall sorts, need no explanation. d) This you see is the very same thing, but spoken in divers terms. f) Here he also expresseth the same purpose with varietie of words. g) One of these terms Relieve, judge, or plead for, would have served the severall clauses; but to varie terms is farre more pleasing, for using the same words breeds satietie. h) Here is a climbing of the speech; To see is more then to heare, and to handle is more then to see. A work of divers colours is somewhat ; of needle, that is more ; on both sides, that is yet more. i) Here the latter clause is so inferred, that it recalls the former, and causes it to take a deeper impression. But indeed Revocation is more powerfull, when there is a direct Revocation; as thus , We are  90 now redeemed, justified, sanctified, glorified in him. Redeemed, justified, sanctified, glorified? What things are these? And Mr. Smiths personation of Nebuchadnezzar hath in it a prettie Revocation : Did I call it great Babel? I will call it great Babel: Did I say, I built it? I will say, I built it: Did I adde, For the honour of my Majestie? Let it go, For the honour of my Majestie. Note that some speeches 91 have a spice of Gradation and Correction together. Rom. 8.34. It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again. Yea, and in some speeches, two, three, foure, or more Figures may be compact together: the same speech may carrie both an Exclamation, Diversion, Reservation, Allusion in it, or the like. This thou canst not choose but note in the examples throughout, and wheree're thou readest. k) Allusion is a very large and wittie figure. Sometimes we allude to what is forespoken: as in the first example the Apostle alludes unto the speech verse 5. So we allude in the mentioning of anothers words, or of our own that are known words; as if one should beginne a speech thus , If I had not ploughed with your heifer, & c. alluding to Samsons words: so in the inversion of a clause, as, The poore have ever lived hardly, but now they hardly live. Sometimes we allude unto the sense, when the word hath a double construction, as in the second example. So in these, The Rhemists 92 can no more abide that proposition converted, then themselves; The ash is an embleme of unprofitable prelacie, which bears nothing but Keyes. We are all saints by calling, and some of 93 us but by calling. Physicians live by other mens pains. Sometimes we allude unto the sound, as in the third and fourth examples: yea if it be but the keeping of the letter, as thus, There is a difference betwixt the sinnes of weaknesse, and the sinnes of wilfulness. Labour not to please the eare, but pierce the heart. Sometimes we allude to sense and sound both; as, Those things we should most set-by, we most set by. Sometimes we allude in the choice of words, that have a pretty correspondence, answering and suiting with one another, as in the fifth example; and so thus, Go and seek thine entertaiment, where thou hast lost thine honestie. How much better were it to 94 be with the sheep of Jethro, then with the wolves of Israel! If he had said, with the tigers or bears of Israel, it had been all one for his meaning, but had been nothing so neat. Sometimes we allude to the pace or measure of words, as in the last example; The clauses are all of alike size, which makes them runne very pleasantly. Sometimes we have allusions both of the sound, sense, and pace together. l) There are 3 vertues in this Figure; the one intimated in the word smooth, that is, such a collocation and well-ordered disposition of the word, as doth avoid harshnesse, and pleaseth the eare with an harmonious consonancie of syllables, as in the example is plain: For if the last clause had kept the form of the precedent thus , And in stead of beautie, burning, it would have sounded more unpleasantly, but that transposition of the words gives a grace unto them. The other vertue intimated in the word select, is a judicious choice of words, sometimes of a monosyllable, dissyllable, or more syllables, sometimes being more full or fit in regard of more consonants or vowels for the place and use intended, although otherwise of equall signification. So that this composure of words is like some frame of joyned ware, the joynts and parts whereof are so truely proportioned and fitted, that the whole coupleth sightly together, without gaping or unevennesse. Now 95 true it is, that to teach election of words, when to use long words, when short, where to choose a word that begins with a vowel, where with a consonant, which to make the precedent, which the subsequent, I say, though for this end sundry rules might be given, as also in all other Figures and Tropes, so that the multitude of rules would have sweld a volume too big: yet because little but the Theorie of Rhetorick can be learned by Art, and the Practick is the gift of Nature, I have thought it a fruitlesse, yea an hopelesse attempt (as is discoursed in Tullie de Oratore) to teach the practise of Rhetorick. For ever when it is not naturall but affected in us, to draw and compose Tropes and Figures, we fall so farre short of the goodlinesse of Oratorie, as a forced action from a naturall delivery. So that herein onely Discretion, Observation, and Exercise must be our guides. And the notions of Rhetorick (as hath been proved and approved) are herein fully discovered, that the ingenuous consulting with any scholar, may attain the exact understanding of them. 2\. Diversion. 3. Reservation. 4. Exclamation. 5. Personation. 6. Insinuation. --- 96 a Description is a  a complementall dilatation of speech, which is two wayes. 1. By a Circumstance, 2. By a Circumlocution. Eccles  . 10.20. A bird a of the  97 aire shall carry the voice, and a that which hath  98 wings shall tell the matter. 99 Diversion is, when abruptly breaking off the matter in hand, we speak of another. Gen. 100 49.18. b I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord, 101 Reservation is an abrupt breaking off, withholding part of our minde. 1. King. 21.7.  102 c Dost thou now govern the kingdome of Israesl ---Arise, &c. Exclamation is a speech expressing some  103 conceived passion or affection of anger, joy, desire, admiration, doubt, scorn, insultation, objurgation,  &c. Psal. 42. 2. d When shall I come and appeare before God! Rom. 12.33. O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdome and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgements, and his wayes past finding out! Personation is, when we feigne a person  104 e speaking or hearing; or a thing, as a person. Psal. 16.10. f Thou  105 wilt not leave my soul in hell, &c. 2. Sam. 1.25. g O  106 Jonathan thou wast slain, &c. Jud. 9.8. h The trees said unto the Olive, Do thou reigne over us; but the Olive tree said, &c. 1. King. 13.2. i O Altar, Altar, &c. Insinuation is a subtil winding into the Affections to beget good liking, attention, or consent. By  k Compellation, k Occupation, k Appeal, k Anticipation, &c. Rom.  12.1. I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God. 1 .Tim. 2.7. I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not. 1\. Cor. 11.13. Judge in your selves, is 107 it comely, &c. Acts 26.29. I know that thou beleevest. a) Description here I take larger then Periphrasis, for that indeed is but Circumscription; and by Complementall dilation, I mean fine spreadings and fillings of speech, either by Circumstance, which is an addition of words in the setting forth of a thing, not expedient for the matter, but for ornament; as in the former of these clauses it had been sufficient, and all one for the matter, to have said simply , A bird shall carry,  &c. that addition of the aire is but a neat Complement, or filling of speech: and these circumstances are many times comprehended in an Epithet; as if he had said , A flying bird shall, &c. Flying is but a superfluous circumstance to the matter, yet it adorns much. So in these speeches, Blessed shall Jael be among women in the tent. David vows to kill all Nabals house, to the dog that lies at his doore. Or by Circumlocution, which is a phrase of speech: a fowl is in this wise described , that which hath wings. So that description of dying, by David , I go the way of all the earth; and that of Solomon , Man goeth to his long home, are very fine Periphrases. b ) Jacob was foretelling what should befall the severall tribes: in the midst of his prophesie, he suddenly breaks off into this ejaculation, which depends not upon the precedent matter. 108 Note here also that there is an elegant Diversion in the person. Psal. 34. 12. What man is he that desireth life ? Keep thy tongue from evil: he should have said , Let him keep his tongue from evil: but he turneth to the second person; for the more personall any application is, the more forcible it is. c) Betwixt Israel and Arise, to make the sense perfect, there wants some such words as these , And canst not get a vineyard? and those words are much more forcible by the reservation of these. For it is not every Eclipsis that makes a Reservation, as some idlely teach. In play-books, where these Figures are much used, they are noted thus \--- d) This Figure is plain enough, and is commonly noted with this (!) Note that of the nature 109 of an Exclamation is a pithie sentence in the close to winde up the passage, which Rhetoricians call Epiphonema: as , Psal. 49. 20. where the Prophet having discoursed of the licentious folly of self-admiring worldlings, shuts up thus , Man being in honour, and understanding not, is like the beasts that perish. e) Any way speaking, whether objecting, answering, or communing. f) This David speaks not of himself, but personating Christ. See Act. 13.35. g) Here David speaks, as if it were to Jonathans face. h) Here Jothan brings in the trees speaking, as if they were men. i) Here the Prophet speaks to the altar, as if it were a person, and heard him. k) Compellation is loving, sweet, and beseeming language, as you see in the first example . Occupation is not (as many teach) the bringing in of an objection, for that is rather a personation; (as , O but we are not book-learned: Thus the Preacher objects many times, personating ignorant cavillers) but it is when we slily forestall prejudicate thoughts, as in the second example the Apostle prevents by that protestation, the scruple of misdoubting his calling. 110 The other examples be plain. Now lastly you must note, that happily there may be some examples added to most of the Figures, that will be 111 found somewhat after another manner, even as there is some difference betwixt the examples given. For instance; To Repetition I might adde a repetition in manner of the burden of a song, as in the 136 psalme. To Correction I could adde correction by way of counterfeit mistake, as thus, These Jebusites, Jesuites I would say. To Allusion I might adde allusion by a purposed mistake, as Summers said to King Henry, Your Frauditours, Conveyers, and Deceivers, and such officers, get all your money; for Auditours, Purveyers, and Receivers. To Insinuation I might adde insinuation by concession, apologie, simulation, &c. And so of other examples and other figures; all which are so plain and so easie to be apprehended, that doubtlesse the distinguishing of them into so many species would rather obscure them, and puzzle the learner, then be any help to the understanding thereof. Action is a part of Rhetorick exercised in the gesture and utterance. Gesture is the comely carriage of the bodie; whereof nothing is needfull to be spoken. Utterance is the sweet framing of the voice; of which we will note onely that which we call a Emphasis , which is the elevation of some word or words in the sentence, wherein the chief force lies. Psal. 76.7. [illeg.] Thou, Thou art worthy to be praised. a) As in every word some syllable is pronounced more acutely; so in every clause some word is uttered with more vehemencie then the rest, as the first 2 words in this clause must be. Now when we put many Emphases together, the sentence is very moving. Rom. 8. 38. Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, & c. all these must be pronounced Emphatically. FINIS.
