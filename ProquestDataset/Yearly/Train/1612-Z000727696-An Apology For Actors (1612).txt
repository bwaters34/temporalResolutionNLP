 Ovt of my busiest houres, I haue spared myselfe so much time as to touch some particulars concerning vs, to approue our Antiquity, ancient Dignity, and the true vse of our quality. That it hath beene ancient, we haue deriued it from more then two thousand yeeres agoe, successiuely to this age. That it hath beene esteemed by the best and greatest: to omit all the noble Patrons of the former world, I need alledge no more than the Royall and Princely seruices, in which we now liue. That the vse thereof is authentique, I haue done my endeauour to instance by History, and approue by authority. To excuse my ignorance in affecting no florish of Eloquence, to set a glosse vpon my Treatise, I haue nothing to say for my selfe but this  : A good face needs no painting,  & a good cause no abetting. Some ouer-curious haue too liberally taxed vs: and hee (in my thoughts) is held worthy reproofe, whose ignorance cannot answere for it selfe: I hold it more honest for the guiltlesse to excuse, then the enuious to exclaime. And we may as freely (out of our plainnesse) answere, as they (out of their peruersnesse obiect) instancing my selfe by famous Scalliger, learned Doctor Gager, Doctor Gentiles, and others, whose opinions and approued arguments on our part, I haue in my briefe discourse altogether omitted; because I am loath to bee taxed in borrowing from others: and besides, their workes being extant to the world, offer themselues freely to euery mans perusall. I am profest aduersary to none, I rather couet reconcilement, then opposition, nor proceedes this my labour from any enuy in me, but rather to shew them wherein they erre. So wishing you iudiciall Audiences, honest Poets, and true gatherers, I commit you all to the fulnesse of your best wishes. Yours euer, T. H. countenance to bolster it selfe by his owne strength; and therefore haue charitably reached it my hand to support it against any succeeding Aduersary. I could willingly haue committed this worke to some more able then my selfe: for the weaker the Combatant, hee needeth the stronger Armes. But in extremities, I hold it better to weare rusty Armour, then to goe naked; yet if these weake habilliments of warre, can but buckler it from part of the rude buffets of our Aduersaries, I shall hold my paines sufficiently guerdoned. My pen hath seldome appeared in Presse till now, I haue beene euer too iealous of mine owne weaknesse, willingly to thrust into the Presse: nor had I at this time, but that a kinde of necessity enioyned me to so sudden a businesse. I will neither shew my selfe ouer-presumtuous, in skorning thy fauour, nor too importunate a beggar, by too seruilly intreating it. What thou art content to bestow vpon my pains, I am content to accept: if good thoughts, they are all I desire: if good words, they are more then I deserue: if bad opinion, I am sorry I haue incur'd it: if euil language, I know not how I haue merited it: if any thing, I am pleased: if nothing, I am satisfied, contenting my selfe with this: I haue done no more then (had I beene called to account) shewed what I could say in the defence of my owne quality.

Cease your detracting tongues contest no more, Leaue off for shame to wound the Actors fame, Seeke rather their wrong'd credit to restore, Your enuy and detractions, quite disclaime: You that haue term'd their sports lasciuious, vile, Wishing good Princes would them all exile; See here this question to the full disputed: Heywood , hath you, and all your proofes confuted. Wouldst see an Emperour and his Counsell graue, A noble Souldier acted to the life, A Romane Tyrant how he doth behaue Himselfe: at home, abroad, in peace, in strife? Wouldst see what's loue, what's hate, what's foule exeesse, Or wouldst a Traytor in his kind expresse: Our Stagerites can (by the Poets pen) Appeare to you to bee the selfe fame men. What though a sort for spight, or want of wit, Hate what the best allow, the most forbeare, What exercise can you desire more fit, Then stately stratagemes to see and heare. What profit many may attaine by playes, To the most critticke eye this booke displaies,  2 Braue men, braue acts, being brauely acted too, Makes, as men see things done, desire to do. And did it nothing but in pleasing sort, Keepe gallants from mispending of their time, It might suffice: yet here is nobler sport, Acts well contriu'd, good Profe, and stately rime. To call to Church, Campanus bels did make, Playes, dice, and drinke inuite men to forsake: Their vse being good then vse the Actors well, Since ours all other Nations farre excell. I Cannot, though you write in your owne cause, Say you deale partially; but must confesse, (What most men wil) you merit due applause; So worthily your worke becomes the Presse, And well our Actors, may approue your paines, For you giue them authority to play; Euen whilst the hottest plague of enuy raignes, Nor for this warrant shall they dearly pay. What a full state of Poets, haue you cited, To iudge your cause? and to our equall veiw Faire Monumentall Theaters recited: Whose ruines had bene ruin'd but for you. Such men who can in tune, both raile and sing; Shall veiwing this, either confesse 'tis good, Or let their ignorance condemne the Spring, Because 'tis merry and renewes our bloud. Be therefore your owne iudgement your defence, Which shall approue you better then my praise, Whilst I in right of sacred Innocence, Durst ore each guilded Tombe this knowne truth raise. "Who dead would not be acted by their will, "It seemes such men haue acted their liues ill. Thou that do'st raile at me for seeing a play, How wouldst thou haue me spend my idle houres? Wouldst haue me in a Tauerne drinke all day? Melt in the Sunnes heate? or walke out in showers? Gape at the Lottery from morne till euen, To heare whose mottoes blankes haue, and who prises! To hazzard all at dice (chance six or seuen?) To card? or bowle? My humour this dispises. But thou wilt answer: None of these I need, Yet my tir'd spirits must haue recreation. What shall I doe that may retirement breed? Or how refresh my selfe? and in what fashion? To drabbe, to game, to drinke, all these I hate: Many enormous things depend on these, My faculties truely to recreate With modest mirth, and my selfe best to please Giue me a play; that no distaste can breed, Proue thou a Spider, and from flowers sucke gall, Il'e like a Bee, take hony from a weed: For I was neuer Puritannicall. I loue no publicke soothers, priuate scorners, That raile, gainst letchery, yet loue a harlot. When I drinke, 'tis in sight, and not in corners: I am no open Saint, and secret varlet. Still when I come to playes, I loue to sit, That all may see me in a publike place: Euen in the stages front, and not to git Into a nooke, and hood-winke there my face. " This is the difference, such would haue men deeme , " Them what they are not: I am what I seeme. Rich. Perkins. Let others taske things honest: and to please Some that pretend more strictnesse then the rest, Exclaime on playes: know I am none of these That in-ly loue what out-ly I detest. Of all the modest pastimes I can finde, To content me, of playes I make best vse, As most agreeing with a generous minde. There see I vertues crowne and sinnes abuse. Two houres well spent, and all their pastimes done, Whats good I follow, and whats bad I shun. Christopher. Beeston. Haue I not knowne a man that to be hyr'd, Would not for any treasure see a play, Reele from a Tauerne? Shall this be admir'd? When as another but the tother day, That held to weare a surplesse most vnmeet, Yet after stood at Pauls-crosse in a sheet. Robert Pallant. Of thee, and thy Apology for playes, I will not much speake in contempt or praise: Yet in these following lines Il'e shew my minde, Of Playes, and such as haue 'gainst Playes repin'd. A Play's a briefe Epitome of time, Where man my see his vertue or his crime Layd open, either to their vices shame, Or to their vertues memorable fame. A Play's a true transparant Christall mirror, To shew good minds their mirth, the bad their terror: Where stabbing, drabbing, dicing, drinking, swearing Are all proclaim'd vnto the sight and hearing, In vgly shapes of Heauen-abhorrid sinne, Where men may see the mire they wallow in. And well I know it makes the Diuell rage, To see his seruants flouted on a stage. A Whore, a Thiese, a Pander, or a Bawd, A Broker, or a slaue that liues by fraud: An Vsurer, whose soule is in his chest, Vntill in hell it comes to restlesse rest. A Fly-blowne gull, that faine would be a Gallant, A Raggamuffin that hath spent his Tallant: A selfe-wife foole, that sees his wits out-stript, Or any vice that feeles it selfe but nipt, Either in Tragedy, or Comedy, In Morall, Pastorall, or History: But straight the poyson of their enuious tongues, Breakes out in vollyes of Calumnious wronges. And then a Tinker, or a Dray-man sweares, I would the house were fir'd about their eares. Thus when a play nips Sathan by the nose, Streight all his vassails are the Actors foes. But feare not man, let enuy swell and burst, Proceed, and bid the Diuell do his worst. For Playes are good or bad, as they are vs'd, And best inuentions often are abus'd. Yours euer , The world's a Theater, the earth a Stage,  3 Which God, and nature doth with Actors fill, Kings haue their entrance in due equipage, And some there parts play well and others ill. The best no better are (in this Theater,) Where euery humor's fitted in his kinde, This a true subiects acts, and that a Traytor, The first applauded, and the last confin'd This plaies an honest man, and that a knaue A gentle person this, and he a clowne One man is ragged, and another braue. All men haue parts, and each man acts his owne. She a chaste Lady acteth all her life, A wanton Curtezan another playes. This, couets marriage loue, that, nuptial strife, Both in continuall action spend their dayes. Some Citizens, some Soldiers, borne to aduenter, Sheepheards and Sea-men; then our play's begun, When we are borne, and to the world first enter, And all finde Exits when their parts are done. If then the world a Theater present, As by the roundnesse it appeares most fit, Built with starre-galleries of hye ascent, In which Iehoue doth as spectator sit. And chiefe determiner to applaud the best, And their indeuours crowne with more then merit. But by their euill actions doomes the rest, To end disgrac't whilst others praise inherit. 4 He that denyes then Theaters should be, He may as well deny a world to me. Thomas Heywood. Actors, and first touching their Antiquity who in the fatnes and ranknes of a peacable Common-wealth, grow vp like vnsauery tusts of grasse, which though outwardly greene and fresh to the eye, yet are they both vnpleasant  & vnprofitable, beeing too sower for food, and too ranke for fodder: These men like the antient Germans, affecting no fashion but their owne, would draw other nations to bee slouens like them-selues, and vndertaking to purifie and reforme the sacred bodies of the Church and Common- weale (In the trew vse of both which they are altogether Ignorat,) would but like artlesse Phisitions, for experiment sake, rather minister pils to poyson the whole body then cordials to preserue any or the least part. Amongst many other thinges tollerated in this peaceable and florishing State, it hath pleased the high and mighty Princes of this Land to limit the vse of certaine publicke Theaters, which since many of these ouer-curious heads haue lauishy and violently slandered, I hold it not a misle to lay open some few Antiquities to approue the true vse of them, with arguments (not of the least moment) which according to the weaknes of my spirit and infancy of my iudgment I will (by gods grace) commit to the eyes of all fauorable and iudiciall readers, as well to satisfie the requests of some of our well qualified fauorers, as to stop the enuious acclamations of those who chalenge to them-selues a priuiledge Inuectiue, and against all free estates a railing liberty: Loath am I (I protest) being the youngest and weakest of the Nest wherin I was hatcht, to soare this pitch before others of the same brood more fledge, and of better winge then my selfe: but though they whome more especially this taske concernes, both for their ability in writing and sufficiency in Iudgement (as their workes generally witnesse to the world:) are content to ouer-slip so necessary a subiect, and haue left it as to mee the most vnworthy: I thought it better to stammer out my mind, then not to speake at all; to scrible downe a marke in the stead of writing a name, and to stumble on the way, rather then to stand still and not to proceede on so necessary a Iourney. Nox erat, & somnus lassos submisit ocellos. It was about that time of the night when darknes had already ouerspread the world, and a husht and generall sylence possest the face of the earth, and mens bodyes tyred with the businesse of the day, betaking themselues to their best repose, their neuer-sleeping soules labored in vncoth dreames and visions, when suddenly appeared' to me the tragicke Muse Melpomene \--- animosa Tragedia. \--- & mouit pictis imixa Cothurnis Densum Cesarie, terque quaterque Caput : Her heyre rudely disheueled, her chaplet withered, her visage with teares stayned, her brow furrowed, her eyes deiected, nay her whole complexion quite faded and altered: and perusing her habit, I might behold the colour of her fresh roabe all Crimson, breathed, and with the inuenomed iuice of some prophane spilt inke in euery place stained: nay more, her busken of all the wonted Iewels and ornaments, vtterly despoyled; about which in manner of a garter I might behold these letters written in a playne and large Character. Behold my Tragicke Buskin rent and torne , Which Kings and Emperors in their tymes haue worne. This I no sooner had perus'd, but suddenly I might perceaue the inraged Muse, cast vp her skornfull head, her eyebals sparklefire,  & a suddain flash of disdaine, intermixt with rage, purple her cheeke. When pacing with a maiesticke gate & rowsing vp her fresh spirits with a liuely and queint action, shee began in these or the like words. Grande sonant tragici, tragicos decet Ira Cothurnos. Am I Melpomene the buskend Muse, That held in awe the tyrants of the world, And playde their liues in publicke Theaters, Making them feare to sinne, since fearelesse I Prepar'd to wryte their liues in Crimson Inke, And act their shames in eye of all the world? Haue not I whipt Uice with a scourge of steele, Vnmaskt sterne Murther; sham'd lasciuious Lust. Pluct off the visar from grimme Treasons face, And made the Sunne point at their vgly sinnes? Hath not this powerfull hand tam'd fiery Rage, Kild poysonous Enuy with her owne keene darts, Choak't vp the Couetous mouth with moulten gold, Burst the vast wombe of eating Gluttony, And drownd the Drunkards gall in iuice of grapes? I haue showed Pryde his picture on a stage, Layde ope the vgly shapes his steele-glasse hid, And made him passe thence meekely: In those daies When Emperours with their presence grac't my sceanes, And thought none worthy to present themselues Saue Emperours: to delight Embassadours. Then did this garland florish, then my Roabe Was of the deepest Crimson, the best dye : Cura Ducum suerant olim regumque poetae. Premiaque Antiqui magna tulere Chori Who lodge then in the bosome of great Kings. Saue he that had a graue Cothurnate Muse. A stately verse in an Iambick stile Became a Kesars mouth. Oh these were times Fit for you Bards to vent your golden Rymes. Then did I tread on Arras, Cloth of Tissue, Hung round the fore-front of my stage: the pillers That did support the Roofe of my large frame Double apparreld in pure Ophir gold: Whilst the round Circle of my spacious orbe Was throng'd with Princes, Dukes and Senators. Nunc Hederae sine Honore iacent. But now's the Iron age, and black-mouth'd Curres , Barke at the vertues of the former world. Such with their breath haue blasted my fresh roabe, Pluckt at my flowry Chaplet, towsd my tresses. Nay some whom for their basenesse hist and skorn'd The Stage, as loathsome, hath long-since spued out, Haue watcht their time to cast inuenom'd Inke To stayne my garments with: Oh Seneca Thou tragicke Poet, hadst thou liu'd to see This outrage done to sad Melpomene, With such sharpe lynes thou wouldst reuenge my blot , As Armed Ouid against Ibis wrot. With that in rage shee left the place, and I my dreame, for at the instant I awaked, when hauing perused this vision ouer and ouer againe in my remembrance, I suddenly be-thought mee, How many antient Poets, Tragicke and Comicke, dying many ages agoe liue still amongst vs in their works, as amongst the Greekes, Euripides: Menander-Sophocles, Eupolis, Eschilus, Aristophanes, Appollodorus, Anaxandrides, Nichomachus, Alexis, Tereus and others, so among the Latins: Attilius, Actius, Melithus, Plautus, Terens ,  & others whome fore breuity sake I omit. Hos Ediscit & hos arcto stipata Theatro Spectat Roma potens habet hos, numer at que Poetas. These potens Rome acquires and holdeth deare. And in their round Theaters flocks to heare : These or any of these had they liued in the afternoone of the world, as they dyed euen in the morning, I assure my selfe wold haue left more memorable tropheys of that learned Muse, whome in their golden numbers they so richly adorned. And amongst our moderne poets who haue bene industrious in many an elaborate and ingenious poem, euen they whose pennes haue had the greatest trafficke with the Stage, haue bene in the excuse of these Muses most forgetfull. But leauing these, left I make too large a head to a small body, and so mishape my subiect, I will begin with the antiquity of Acting Comedies, Tragedies, and Hystories, And first in the golden world. In the first of the Olimpiads , amongst many other actiue exercises in which Hercules euer trimph'd as victor, there was in his nonage presented vnto him by his Tutor in the fashion of a History, acted by the choyse of the nobility of Greece, the worthy and memorable acts of his father Iupiter . Which being personated with liuely and well-spirited action, wrought such impression in his noble thoughts, that in meere emulation of his fathers valor (not at the behest of his Stepdame Iuno ) he perform'd his twelue labours: Him valiant Theseus followed, and Achilles, Theseus . Which bred in them such hawty and magnanimous attempts, that euery succeeding age hath recorded their worths, vnto fresh admiration. Aristotle that Prince of Philosophers, whose bookes carry such credit, euen in these our vniuersities, that to say Ipse dixit is a sufficient Axioma , hee hauing the tuition of young Alexander , caused the destruction of Troy to be acted before his pupill, in which the valor of Achilles was so naturally exprest, that it imprest the hart of Alexander , in so much that all his succeeding actions were meerly shaped after that patterne, and it may be imagined had Achilles neuer liued, Alexander had neuer conquered the whole world. The like assertion may be made of that euer-renowned Roman Iulius C aesar . Who after the like representation of Alexander in the Temple of Hercules standing in Gades was neuer in any peace of thoughts, till by his memorable exployts, hee had purchas'd to himselfe the name of Alexander : as Alexander till hee thought himselfe of desert to be called Achilles: Achilles Theseus, Theseus till he had sufficiently Imitated the acts of Hercules , and Hercules till hee held himselfe worthy to bee called the son of Iupiter . Why should not the liues of these worthyes, presented in these our dayes, effect the like wonders in the Princes of our times, which can no way bee so exquisitly demonstrated, nor so liuely portrayed as by action: Oratory is a kind of a speaking picture, therefore may some say, is it not sufficient to discourse to the eares of princes the fame of these conquerors: Painting likewise, is a dumbe oratory, therefore may we not as well by some curious Pigmalion , drawe their conquests to worke the like loue in Princes towards these Worthyes by shewing them their pictures drawne to the life, as it wrought on the poore painter to bee inamored of his owne shadow ¿ I answer this. Non magis expressi vultus per ahenia signa Quam per vatis opus, mores animique virorum Clarorum apparent.--- The visage is no better cut in brasse, Nor can the Caruer so expresse the face As doth the Poets penne whose arts surpasse, To giue mens liues and vertues their due grace. A Description is only a shadow receiued by the care but not perceiued by the eye: so liuely portrature is meerely a forme seene by the eye, but can neither shew action, passion, motion, or any other gesture, to mooue the spirits of the beholder to admiration: but to see a souldier shap'd like a souldier, walke, speake, act like a souldier: to see a Hector all besmered in blood, trampling vpon the bulkes of Kinges. A Troylus returning from the field in the sight of his father Priam , as if man and horse euen from the steeds rough fetlockes to the plume in the champions helmet had bene together plunged into a purple Ocean: To see a Pompey ride in triumph, then a C aesar conquer that Pompey : labouring Hanniball aliue, hewing his passage through the Alpes. To see as I haue seene, Hercules in his owne shape hunting the Boare, knocking downe the Bull, taming the Hart, fighting with Hydra, murdering Gerion , slaughtring Diomed , wounding the Stimphalides , killing the Centaurs, pashing the Lion, squeezing the Dragon, dragging Cerberus in Chaynes, and lastly, on his high Pyramides writing Nilvltra , Oh these were sights to make an Alexander. To turne to our domesticke hystories, what English blood seeing the person of any bold English man presented and doth not hugge his fame, and hunnye at his valor, pursuing him in his enterprise with his best wishes, and as beeing wrapt in contemplation, offers to him in his hart all prosperous performance, as if the Personater were the man Personated, so bewitching a thing is liuely and well spirited action, that it hath power to new mold the harts of the spectators and fashion them to the shape of any noble and notable attempt. What coward to see his contryman valiant would not bee ashamed of his owne cowardise? What English Prince should hee behold the true portrature of that amous King Edward the third, foraging France, taking so great a King captiue in his owne country, quartering the English Lyons with the French Flower- delyce, and would not bee suddenly Inflam'd with so royall a spectacle, being made apt and fit for the like atchieuement. So of Henry the fift: but not to be tedious in any thing. Ouid in one of his poems holds this opinion, that Romulus was the first that broght plaies into Italy, which he thus sets downe. Primus sollicitos fecisti Romule Ludos.  5 Cum iurit viduos rapta sabina viros Tunc neque marmoreo pendebant vela Theatro, &c. Which wee English thus. Thou noble Romulus first playes contriues , To get thy widdowed souldiers Sabine wyues. In those dayes from the marble house did waue No saile, no silken flagge, or ensigne braue. Then was the Tragicke stage not painted red, Or any mixed staines on pillers spred. Then did the Sceane want art, th'vnready stage Was made of grasse and earth in that rude age: About the which were thicke-leau'd branches placed, Nor did the Audients hold themselues disgraced Of turfe and heathy sods to make their seates, Fram'd in degrees of earth, and mossy peates. Thus plac'd in order, euery Roman pry'd Into her face that sate next by his side; And closing with her, seuerally gan moue, The innocent Sabine women to their loue: And whil'st the piper Thuscus rudely plaid , And by thrice stamping with his foote had made A signe vnto the rest, there was a shout, Whose shrill report pierst all the aire about. Now at a signe of rape giuen from the King, Round through the house the lusty Romans fling, Leauing no corner of the same vnsought, Till euery one a frighted virgin caught. Looke as the trembling Doue the Eagle flyes, Or a yong Lambe when he the Woolfe espyes; So ran the poore girles, filling th'aire with skreekes, Emptying of all the colour their pale cheekes. One feare possest them all, but not one looke, This teares her haire, she; hath her wits forsooke. Some sadly sit, some on their mothers call, Some chase, some flye, some stay, but frighted all. Thus were the rauish'd Sabines blushing led (Becomming shame) vnto each Romans bed. If any striu'd against it, streight her man Would take her on his knee (whom feare made wan) And say; Why weep'st thou sweet? what ailes my deere? Dry vp these drops, these clowds of sorrow cleere. Il'e be to thee, if thou thy griefe wilt smother, Such as thy father was vnto thy mother. Full well could Romulus his Souldiers please , To giue them such faire mistresses as these. If such rich wages thou wilt giue to me, Great Romulus, thy souldier I will be. Romulus hauing erected the walles of Rome , and leading vnder him a warlike Nation, being in continuall warre with the Sabines , after the choyce selecting of a place, fit for so famous a Citty, and not knowing how to people the same, his traine wholly consisting of Souldiers, who without the company of women (they not hauing any in their Army) could not multiply; but so were likely that their immortall fames should dye issulesse with their mortall bodies. Thus therefore Romulus deuised; After a parle and attonement made with the neighbour Nations, hee built a Theater, plaine, according to the time; yet large, fit for the entertainement of so great an Assembly, and these were they whose famous issue peopled the Cittie of Rome , which in after ages grew to such height, that not Troy , founded by Dardanus, Carthage layed by Dido, Tyrus built by Agenor, Memphis made by Ogdous, Thebes seated by Cadmus , nor Babylon reared by Semiramis , were any way equall to this situation grounded by Romulus : to which all the discouered kingdomes of the earth after became tributaries. And in the noone-tide of their glory, and height of all their honor, they edified Theaters, and Amphi- theaters: for in their flourishing Common-weale, their publike Comedians and Tragedians most florished, insomuch that the Tragicke and Comicke Poets, were all generally admired of the people, and particularly euery man of his priuate Mecenas. In the reigne of Augustus Christ was borne, and as well  6 in his dayes as before his birth, these solemnities were held in the greatest estimation. In Iulius C aesars time, predecessor  7 to Augustus , the famous hony-tong'd Orator Cicero florished; who, amongst many other his eloquent Orations, writ certaine yet extant, for the Comedian Roscius (pro Roscio Com aedo ) of whom we shall speake more large hereafter. These continued in their honour till the reigne of Tiberius C aesar , and vnder Tiberius Christ was crucified. To this end do I vse this assertion, because in the full and perfect time our Sauiour soiurned on the earth, euen in those happy and peacefull dayes the spacious Theaters were in the greatest opinion amongst the Romans; yet, neither Christ himselfe, nor any of his sanctified Apostles, in any of their Sermons, Acts, or Documents, so much as named them, or vpon any abusiue occasion, touched them. Therefore hence (me thinkes) a very probable and important argument may be grounded, that since they, in their diuine wisdomes, knew all the sinnes abounding in the world before that time, taxt and reproued all the abuses reigning in that time, and foresaw all the actions and inconueniences (to the Church preiudiciall) in the time to come; Since they (I say) in all their holy doctrines, bookes, and principles of Diuinity, were content to passe them ouer, as things tollerated, and indifferent, why should any nice and ouer- scrupulous heads, since they cannot ground their curiousnesse either vpon the old or new Testament, take vpon them to correct, controule, and carpe at that, against which they cannot finde any text in the sacred Scriptures? In the time of Nero C aesar , the Apostle Paul was persecuted and suffered, Nero was then Emperour, Paul writ his Epistle to the Romans, and at the same time did the Theaters most florish amongst the Romans; yet where can we quote any place in his Epistles, which forbids the Church of God, then resident in Rome , to absent themselues from any such assemblies. To speake my opinion with all indifferency, God hath not enioyned vs to weare all our apparrell solely to defend the cold. Some garments we weare for warmth, others for ornament. So did the children of Israel hang eare-rings in their eares, nor was it by the law forbidden them. That purity is not look't for at our hands, being mortall and humane, that is required of the Angels, being celestiall and diuine. God made vs of earth, men; knowes our natures, dispositions and imperfections, and therefore hath limited vs a time to reioyce, as hee hath enioyned vs a time to mourne for our transgressios. And I hold them more scrupulous than well aduised, that goe about to take from vs the vse of all moderate recreations. Why hath God ordained for man, varietie of meates, dainties and delicates, if not to taste thereon? why doth the world yeeld choyce of honest pastimes, if not decently to vse them? Was not the Hare made to be hunted? the Stagge to be chaced; and so of all other beasts of game in their seuerall kindes? since God hath prouided vs of these pastimes, why may wee not vse them to his glory? Now if you aske me why were not the Theaters as gorgeously built in all other Cities of Italy as Rome ? And why are not Play-houses maintained as well in other Cities of England , as London ? my answere is: It is not meet euery meane Esquire should carry the part belonging to one of the Nobility, or for a Noble-man to vsurpe the estate of a Prince. Rome was a Metropolis , a place whither all the nations knowne vnder the Sunne, resorted: so is London , and being to receiue all Estates, all Princes, all Nations, therefore to affoord them all choyce of pastimes, sports, and recreations: yet were there Theaters in all the greatest Cities of the world, as we will more largely particularize hereafter. I neuer yet could read any History of any Common-weale, which did not thriue & prosper whilst these publike solemnities were held in adoration. Oh but (say some) Marcus Aurelius banisht all such triuiall exercises beyond the confines of Italy . Indeed this Emperour was a Philosopher of the sect of Diogenes , a Cinicke, and whether the hand of Diogenes would become a scepter, or a root better, I leaue to your iudgments. This Aurclius was a great  & sharpe reprouer, who because the Matrons and Ladies of Rome , in scorne of his person made a play of him; in his time, interdicted the vse of their Theaters. So, because his wife Faustine plaid false with him, he generally exclaimed against all women: because himselfe could not touch an Instrument, he banisht all the Musitians in Rome , and being a meere coward, put all the Gladiators and sword-players into exile. And lest his owne suspected life should be againe acted by the Comedians, as it before had beene by the noble Matrons, he profest himselfe aduersary to all of that quality, so seuere a reformation of the weale publike hee vsed, restraining the Citizens of their free liberties, which till his daies was not seene in Rome ; but what profited this the weale publicke? do but peruse the ancient Roman Chronicles,  & you shall vndoubtedly finde, that from the time of this precise Emperour, that stately City, whose lofty buildings crowned seuen high hils at once, and ouer-peered them all, streight way began to hang the head, by degrees the forreigne kingdomes reuolted, and the homage done them by strange Nations, was in a little space quite abrogated: for they gouerned all the world, some vnder Consuls, some vnder Pro-consuls, Presidents and Pretors, they diuided their dominions and countryes into principalities, some into Prouinces, some into Toparchyes. Some into Tetrarchyes, some into Tribes, others into Ethnarchyes: but now their homage ceast, Marcus Aurelius ended their mirth, which presaged that shortly after should begin their sorrow, he banisht their liberty,  & immediatly followed their bondage. For Rome , which till then kept all the Nations of the world in subiectiue awe, was in a little space awd euen by the basest nations of the world. To leaue Italy , and looke backe into Greece , the Sages and Princes of Grecia , who for the refinednesse of their language, were in such reputation through the world, that all other tongues were esteemed barbarous; These that were the first vnderstanders, trained vp their youthfull Nobility to bee Actors, debarring the base Mechanickes so worthy imployment: for none but the yong Heroes were admitted that practise, so to embolden them in the deliuery of any forraine Embassy. These wise men of Greece (o called by the Oracle) could by their industry, finde out no neerer or directer course to plant humanity and manners in the hearts of the multitude then to instruct them by moralized mysteries, what vices to auoyd, what vertues to embrace; what enormityes to abandon, what ordinances to obserue: whose liues (being for some speciall endowments in former times honoured) they should admire and follow: whose vicious actions (personated in some licentious liuer) they should despise  & shunne: which borne out as well by the wisedome of the Poet, as supported by the worth of the Actors, wrought such impression in the hearts of the plebe, that in short space they excelled in ciuility and gouernement, insomuch that from them all the neighbour Nations drew their patternes of Humanity, as well in the establishing of their lawes, as the reformation of their manners. These Magi and Gymnosophist ae , that liu'd (as I may say) in the childhood and infancy of the world, before it knew how to speake perfectly, thought euen in those dayes, that Action was the neerest way to plant vnderstanding in the hearts of the ignorant. Yea (but say some) you ought not to confound the habits of either sex, as to let your boyes weare the attires of virgins, &c. To which I answere: The Scriptures are not alwayes to be expounded meerely, according to the letter: (for in such estate stands our mayne Sacramentall Controuersie) but they ought exactly to bee conferred with the purpose they handle. To do as the Sodomites did, vse preposterous lusts in preposterous habits, is in that text flatly and seuerely forbidden: nor can I imagine any man, that hath in him any taste or relish of Christianity, to be guilty of so abhorred a sinne. Besides, it is not probable, that Playes were meant in that text, because we read not of any Playes knowne in that time that Deuteronomie was writ, among the Children of Israel, nor do I hold it lawfull to beguile the eyes of the world in confounding the shapes of either sex, as to keepe any youth in the habit of a virgin, or any virgin in the shape of a lad, to shroud them from the eyes of their fathers, tutors, or protectors or to any other sinister intent whatsoeuer. But to see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knowes not what their intents be? who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing, they are but to represent such a Lady, at such a time appoynted? Do not the Vniuersities, the fountaines and well springs of all good Arts, Learning and Documents, admit the like in their Colledges? and they (I assure my selfe) are not ignorant of their true vse. In the time of my residence in Cambridge , I haue seene Tragedyes, Comedyes, Historyes, Pastorals and Shewes, publickly acted, in which Graduates of good place and reputation, haue bene specially parted: this is held necessary for the emboldening of their Iunior schollers, to arme them with audacity, against they come to bee imployed in any publicke exercise, as in the reading of the Dialecticke, Rhetoricke, Ethicke, Mathematicke, the Physicke, or Metaphysicke Lectures, It teacheth audacity to the bashfull Grammarian, beeing newly admitted into the priuate Colledge, and after matriculated and entred as a member of the Vniuersity, and makes him a bold Sophister, to argue pro et contra , to compose his Sillogismes, Cathegoricke, or Hypotheticke (simple or compound) to reason and frame a sufficient argument to proue his questions, or to defend any axioma , to distinguish of any Dilemma,  & be able to moderate in any Argumentation whatsoeuer. To come to Rhetoricke, it not onely emboldens a scholler to speake, but instructs him to speake well, and with iudgement, to obserue his comma's, colons, & full poynts, his parentheses, his breathing spaces, and distinctions, to keepe a decorum in his countenance, neither to frowne when he should smile, nor to make vnseemely and disguised faces in the deliuery of his words, not to stare with his cies, draw awry his mouth, confoud his voice in the hollow of his throat, or teare his words hastily betwixt his teeth, neither to buffet his deske like a mad-man, nor stand in his place like a liuelesse Image, demurely plodding, & without any smooth & formal motio. It instructs him to fit his phrases to his action, and his action to his phrase, and his pronuntiation to them both. Tully in his booke ad Caium Herennium , requires fiue things in an Orator, Inuention, Disposition, Eloquution Memory , and Pronuntiation , yet all are imperfect without the sixt, which is Action : for be his inuention neuer so fluent and exquisite, his disposition and order neuer so composed and formall, his eloquence, and elaborate phrases neuer so materiall and pithy, his memory neuer so firme  & retentiue his pronuntiation neuer so musicall and plausiue, yet without a comely and elegant gesture, a gratious and a bewitching kinde of action, a naturall and a familiar motion of the head, the hand, the body, and a moderate and fit countenance sutable to all the rest, I hold all the rest as nothing. A deliuery & sweet actio is the glosse & beauty of any discourse that belongs to a scholler. And this is the action behoouefull in any that professe this quality, not to vse any impudent or forced motion in any part of the body, no rough, or other violent gesture, nor on the contrary, to stand like a stiffe starcht man, but to qualifie euery thing according to the nature of the person personated: for in oueracting trickes, and toyling too much in the anticke habit of humors, men of the ripest desert, greatest opinions, and best reputations, may breake into the most violent absurdities. I take not vpon me to teach, but to aduise: for it becomes my Iuniority rather to be pupild my selfe, then to instruct others. To proceed, and to looke into those men that professe themselues aduersaries to this quality they are none of the grauest, and most ancient Doctors of the Academy, but onely a sort of finde-faults, such as interest their prodigall tongues in all mens affaires without respect. These I haue heard as liberally in their superficiall censures, taxe the exercises performed in their Colledges, as these acted on our publicke stages, not looking into the true  & direct vse of either, but ambitiously preferring their owne presumptuous humors, before the profound and authenticall iudgements of all the learned Doctors of the Vniuersitie. Thus you see, that touching the antiquity of Actors and Acting, they haue not beene new lately begot by any vpstart inuention, but I haue deriued them from the first Olimpiads, and I shall continue the vse of them euen till this present age. And so much touching their antiquity. Pars superest a aepti: pars est exhausta laboris. The end of the first Booke. their ancient Dignitie. Cicero , the as famous Orator, amongst many other matters debated, It pleased the Emperour to aske his opinion of the Histriones, the players of Rome , pretending some cauell against them, as men whose imployment in the Common- weale was vnnecessary: to whom Cicero answered thus: Content thee C aesar , there bee many heads busied & bewitched with these pastimes now in Rome , which otherwise would be inquisitiue after thee and thy greatnesse. Which answere, how sufficiently the Emperour approued, may bee coniectured by the many guifts bestowed, and priuiledges and Charters after granted to men of that quality. Such was likewise the opinion of a great statesman of this land, about the time that certaine bookes were called in question. Doubtlesse there be many men of that temper, who were they not carried away, and weaned from their owne corrupt and bad disposition, and by accidentall meanes remoued and altered from their dangerous and sullen intendments, would be found apt and prone to many notorious and trayterous practises. Kings  & Monarches are by God placed and inthroaned supra nos , aboue vs,  & we are to regard them as the Sun from whom we receiue the light to liue vnder, whose beauty & brightnesse we may onely admire, not meddle with: Ne ludamus cum Dys , they that shoot at the starres ouer their heads, their arrowes fall directly downe and wound themselues. But this allusion may bee better referred to the vse of action promised in our third Treatise. Then to their Dignity, which next and immediatly (by Gods grace) cur purpose is to handle. The word Tragedy , is deriued from the Greeke word ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , Caper a goat, because the goat being a beast most iniurious to the vines, was sacrificed to Bacchus : Heer upon Diodorus writes, that Tragedies had their first names from the oblations due to Bacchus ; or else of ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif)  , a kinde of painting, which the Tragedians of the old time vsed to stayne their faces with. By the censure of Horace, Thespis was the first Tragicke writer. 8 Ignotum Tragice genus invenisse Camen ae Dicitur, & plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis. The unknowne Tragicke Muse Thespis first sought , And her high Po ems in her Chariot brought. This Thespis was an Athenian Poet, borne in Thespina , a free towne in B aetiae by Helicon , of him the nine Muses were called Thespiades . But by the censure of Quintilian, Æschiles was before him, but after them Sophocles and Euripides 9 clothed their Tragedies in better ornament. Liuius Andronicus was the first that writ any Roman Tragedy, in which kinde of po esie Accius, Pacuvius, Seneca , and Ouidius excelled. 10 Sceptra tamen sumpsi cur aq; Tragedia nostra, Creuit, at huic operi quamlibet aptus eram. The sceptred Tragedy then proou'd our wit, And to that worke we found vs apt and fit. Againe, in his fift Booke de tristibus Eleg. 8\. Carmen quod vestro salt ari nostra Theatro Versibus & plaudiscribis (amice) meis. Deere friend thou writ'st our Muse is' mongst you song, And in your Theaters with plaudies rong. Likewise in his Epistle to Augustus , writ from the ponticke Island, whither he was banisht. Et didimus tragicis scriptum regale Cothurnis , Qu aeq; grauis debet verba Cothurnus habet. With royall stile speakes our Cothurnate Muse, A buskind phrase in buskin'd playes we vse. The word Comedy is deriued from the Greeke word ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  a street, and ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif)  , Cantus , a song, a street song, as signifying there was euer mirth in those streets where Comedies most florisht. H aec paces habuere bonae ventiq; secundi. In this kinde Aristophanes , Eupolis , Cratinus were famous after them Menander and Philemon : succeeding them Cicilius , Neuius, Plautus and Terentius. Musaq; Turani tragicis innixa Cothurnis Et tua cum socco, Musa, Melisse leuis. Turanus tragicke buskin grac'd the Play, Melissa'es Comicke shooe made lighter way. The ancient Histriographers write, that among the  11 Greekes there were diuers places of exercises, appointed for Poets, some at the graue of Theseus , others at Helicon , where they in Comedies and Tragedies contended for seueral prises, where Sophocles was aiudged victor ouer Æ schilus : There were others in the Citty of Elis , where Menander was foyled by Philomene . In the same kinde Hesiod is sayd to haue triumpht ouer Homer . So Corrinna for her excellencies in these inuentions, (called Musealyrica ) excelled Pindarus the Theban Poet, for which she was fiue times crowned with garlands. The first publicke Theater was by Dionysius built in Athens ,  12 it was fashioned in the manner of a semi-circle, or halfe-moone, whose galleries  & degrees were reared from the ground, their staires high, in the midst of which did arise the stage, beside, such a conuenient distance from the earth, that the audience assembled might easily behold the whole proiect without impediment. From this the Romanes had their first patterne, which at the first not being roof't, but lying open to all weathers, Quintus Catulus was the first that caused the out-side to bee couered with linnen cloth, and the in-side to bee hung round with Curtens of silke. But when Marcus Scaurus was Æ dilis , hee repaired it, and supported it round with pillers of Marble. Caius Curio , at the solemne obsequies of his father, erected a famous Theater of Timber, in so strange a forme, that on two seuerall stages, two sundry playes might bee acted at once, and yet the one bee no hinderance or impediment to the other; and when hee so pleased the whole frame was artificially composed to meet in the middest, which made an Amphi-theater. Pompey the great, after his victories against Methridates , King of Pontus , saw in the Citty Mitelene a Theater of another forme, and after his triumphes and returne to Rome , he raised one after the same patterne, of free stone, of that vastnesse and receit, that within his spaciousnesse it was able at once to receiue fourescore thousand people, euery one to sit, see and heare. In emulation of this sumptuous and gorgious building Iulius C aesar , successor to Pompeyes greatnesse, exceeded him in his famous Architecture, hee raised an Amphitheater, Campo Martio , in the field of Mars , which as farre excelled Pompeyes , as Pompeyes did exceed Caius Curioes, Curioes that of Marcus Scaurus, Scaurus that of Quintus Catulus , or Catulus that which was first made in Athens by Dionysius : for the Basses, Columnes, Pillars, and Pyramides were all of hewed Marble, the couerings of the stage, which wee call the heauens (where vpon any occasion their Gods descended) were Geometrically supported by a Giant-like Atlas , whom the Po ets for his Astrology, feigne to beare heauen on his shoulders, in which an artificiall Sunne and Moone of extraordinary aspect and brightnesse had their diurnall, and nocturnall motions; so had the starres their then true and coelestiall course; so had the spheares, which in their continuall motion made a most sweet and rauishing harmony: Here were the Elements and planets in their degrees, the sky of the Moone , the sky of Mercury, Venus, Sol, Mars, Iupiter and Saturne ; the starres, both fixed and wandering: and aboue all these, the first mouer, or primum mobile , there were the 12 signes; the lines Equinoctiall and Zodiacal, the Meridian circle, or Zenith, the Orizon circle, or Emisphere, the Zones torrid  & frozen, the poles articke & antarticke, with all other tropickes, orbs, lines, circles, the Solstitium & all other motions of the stars, signes, & planets. In briefe, in that little compasse were comprehended the perfect modell of the firmament, the whole frame of the heauens, with all grounds of Astronomicall coniecture. From the roofe grew a loouer, or turret, of an exceedding altitude, from which an ensigne of silke waued continually, Pendebant vela Theatro . But lest I waste too much of that compendiousnesse I haue promised in my discourse, in idle descriptions, I leaue you to iudge the proportion of the body by the making of this one limbe, euery piller, seat, foot-post, staire, gallery,  & whatsoeuer else belongs to the furnishing of such a place, being in cost, substance, forme, and artificiall workmanship, most sutable. The floore, stage, roofe, out-side, & in-side, as costly as the Pantheon or Capitols . In the principall galleries were special remote, selected  & chosen seats for the Emperour, patres conscripti , Dictators, Consuls, Pretors, Tribunes, Triumviri, Decemviri, Ediles, Curules, and other Noble Officers among the Senators: all other roomes were free for the plebe, or multitude. To this purpose I introduce these famous Edifices, as wondring at their cost  & state, thus intimating, that if the quality of Acting, were (as some propose) altogether vnworthy, why for the speciall practise, and memorable imployment of the same, were founded so many rare and admirable monuments: and by whom were they erected? but by the greatest princes of their times, and the most famous and worthiest of them all, builded by him that was the greatest Prince of the world, Iulius C aesar , at what time in his hand he grip't the vniuersal Empire of the earth. So of Augustus C aesar . Inspice ludorum sumptus Auguste tuorum Empta tibi magno--- Behold Augustus the great pompe and state Of these thy Playes payd deere for, at hye rate. H aec tu pectasti spectandaq; sepe dedisti. And could any inferiour quality bee more worthily esteemed or noblier graced, then to haue Princes of such magnificence and state to bestow on them places of such port and countenance, had they been neuer well regarded, they had been neuer to sufficiently prouided for, nor would such worthy princes haue striued who should (by their greatest expence and prouision) haue done them the amplest dignity, had they not with incredible fauour regarded the quality. I will not trauerse this too farre, least I incurre some suspition of selfe- loue, I rather leaue it to the fauourable consideration of the wise, though to the peruersnesse of the ignorant, who had they any taste either of Poesie, Phylosophy, or Historicall Antiquity, would rather stand mated at their owne impudent ignorance, then against such noble, and notable examples stand in publicke defiance. I read of a Theater built in the midst of the riuer Tyber , standing on pillers and arches, the foundation wrought vnder water like London-bridge, the Nobles and Ladyes in their Barges and Gondelayes, landed at the very stayres of the galleryes. After these they composed others, but differing in forme from the Theater, or Amphi-theater, and euery such was called Circus ., the frame Globe-like,  & merely round. Circus in hanc exit clamataq; palma Theatris. And the yeare from the first building of Rome , fiue hundred threesscore and seuen, what time Spurius Posthumus Albinus , and Quintus Martisus Philippus , were Consuls, Nero made one, and the noble Flaminius another; but the greatest was founded by Tarquinius Priscus , and was called Circus maximus : In this the Gladiators practised, the widenesse and spaciousnesse was such, that in it they fought at Barriers, and many times ran at tilt. Dion records eighteene Elephants slaine at once in one Theater. More particularly to suruey the rarer Monuments of Rome , neere to the Pantheon (the Temple of the Roman Gods) at the discent from the hil Capitolinus , lies the great Forum , by which is scituate the great Amphi-theater of Tytus , first erected by Vespatian , but after (almost ruined by fire) by the Roman Tytus rarely re edified. It is called Colliseus , also a Cauea , which signifies a scaffold, also Arena a place of combate, by Siluianus 13 and Prudentius  , which name Tertullian, Pliny, Ouid, Firmicus , and Apuleins likewise giue it. It had the title of Circus, Caula and Stadium , by Suetonius, Capitolinus and Arcadius. Cassianus affirmes these Theaters consecrated to Diana Taurica, Tertullian , to Mars and Diana, Martiall to Iupiter Latiaris , and to Stigian Pluto , whose opinion Minutius ,  & Prudentius approue. The first structures were by the Tribune 14 Curio , which Dio, lib. 37\. affirmes. Vitruvius lib. 5. faith, Multa Theatra, Rome structa quotanais . Of Iulius C aesars Amphi-theater Campo Martio, Dio Cassius records, which Augustus. 15 after patronizied, as Victor remembers of them, whose charge Statilius Taurus assisted, of whom Dio speaketh thus ![](/images/inline/Ogk.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/naugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  & c. vrbis , DCCXXV.  16 Pub.

Eutropius and Cassiodorus , attribute this place soly to Titus , but Aurelius Victor giues him onely the honour of the perfecting a place so exquisitely begun: this after was repaired by Marcus Anthonius Pius , by whose cost sayth Capitolinus , the Temple of Hadrianus was repaired, and the great Theater re edified, which Heliogabalus , by the testimony of Lampridius , patronized, and after the Senate of Rome , tooke to their protection, vnder the Gordians. Touching Theaters without Rome, Lypsius records Theatra circa Romans, extructa passim , euen in Ierusalem, Herodes magnificus & illustris rex non vno loco Iudeae Amphi-theatra edificauit, exstruxit in ipso vrbe sacra, ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif)   (as Iosephus saith) ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/naugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . Herod a magnificent and illustrious King, not in one place of Iudea , erected Amphitheaters, but euen in the holy Citty hee built one of greatest receit. Also in Greece, Asia, Affricke, Spaine, France : nor is there any prouince in which their ancient structures do not yet remaine, or their perishing ruines are not still remembred. In Italy , ad Lyrim campani ae Fluvium iuxta Minturaes , remaines part of an ample Amphi-theater. At Puteolis , a City by the sea-side in Campania , 8 miles from Naples , one. At Capua , a magnificent one of sollid Marble. At Alba in Italy , one. At Ocriculum in Vmbria one. At Verona , one most beautifull. At Florens , one whose compasse yet remaines. At Athens in Greece , one of Marble. At Pola in Istria , by the Hadriaticke sea, one described by Sebastian Serlius. At Hyspalis in Spaine , one built without the walles of the Citty In Turamace at Vesuna one of squared stone, the length 30. perches, or poles, the bredth 20. At Arelate one. At Burdegall one. At Nemaus one, remembred by Euseb. in Ecclesiastica Historia. At Lygeris one. Another among the Heluetians. The Veronesse Theatrum Marmoreum , erected before the time of Augustus , as Torellus Serayna in his description of Verona , records: but Cyrnicus Anconitanus reports it built in the nine and thirtieth yeare of Octauian, Carolus Sigonius referres it to the reigne of Maximinian , who faith, Maximinian 20 built Theaters in Mediolanum Aquilea , and Brixium. The like Cornelius Tacitus 2\. Hist. remembers in Placentia , but the descriptio of the Verona Theater Leuinus Kersmakerus sets downe. This the great King Francis auno 1539 gaue to certaine Actors, who thirty dayes space together, represented in the same the Acts of the Apostles, nor was is lawfull by the Edict of the King for any man to remoue any stone within thirty poles of his scituation, lest they should endanger the foundation of the Theater. The like haue been in Venice, Millan, Padua . In Paris there are diuers now in vse by the French Kings Comedians, as the Burgonian , and others. Others in Massilia , in Treuers , in Magontia , in Agripina , and infinite Cities of Greece, Thebes, Carthage, Delphos, Creet, Paphos, Epyrus , also in the Citie Tydena , so at Ciuil in Spaine , and at Madrill , with others. At the entertainement of the Cardinall Alphonsus , and  21 the Infant of Spaine into the Low-countryes, they were presented at Antwerpe , with sundry pageants and playes: the King of Denmarke , father to him that now reigneth, entertained into his seruice, a company of English Comedians , commended vnto him by the honourable the Earle of Leicester : the Duke of Brounswicke , and the Landsgraue of Hessen retaine in their Courts certaine of ours, of the same quality. But among the Romans they were in highest reputation: for in comparison of their playes, they neuer regarded any of their solemnities, there ludifunebres , there Floralia, Cerealia , Fugalia, Bachinalia or Lupercalia. 22 And amongst vs, one of our best English Chroniclers records, that when Edward the fourth would shew himselfe in publicke state to the view of the people, hee repaired to his Palace at S. Iohnes , where he accustomed to see the Citty Actors. And since then, that house by the Princes free gift, hath belonged to the office of the Reuels, where our Court playes haue beene in late daies yearely rehersed, perfected, and corrected before they come to the publike view of the Prince and the Nobility. Ouid speaking of the Tragicke Muse, thus writes. Venit & ingenti violenta trage dia passu , Fronte com ae torua palla iacebat humi L aeua manus sceptrum late regale tenebat, Lydius apta pedum vincta cothurnus habet. Then came the Tragicke Muse with a proud pace, Measuring her flow strides with maiesticke grace. Her long traine sweepes the earth, and she doth stand, With buskin'd legge, rough brow, and sceptred hand. Well knew the poet what estimation she was in with Augustus whe he describes her holding in her left hand a scepter. Now to recite some famous Actors that liued in the preceding  23 ages: the first Comedias were Cincius & Faliseus , the first Tragedians were Minutius ,  & Prothonius. Elius Donatus in his preface to Terence his Andrea , saith that in that Comedy Lucius Attilius, Latinus Prenestinus , and Lucius Ambiuius Turpio were Actors: this Comedy was dedicated to Cibil ,  & such were called ludi Megalenses , acted in the yeare that M. Fuluius was Edilis,  & Quintus Minutius Valerius ,  & M. Glabrio were Curules, which were Cousellers  & chiefe officers in Rome , so called because they customably sate in chayres of Iuory. The songs that were sung in this Comedy were set by Flaccus , the sonne of Clodius. Terence his Eunuchus or  24 second Comedy was acted in the yeare L. Posthumus , and L. Cornelius were Edil. Curules, Marcus Valerius ,  & Caius 25 Fannius  Consuls. The yeare from the building of Rome 291\.  26 in his Adelphi one Protinus acted,  & was highly applauded, in his Hecyra Iulius Seruius. Cicero commends one Rupilius 27 a rare Tragedian: I read of another called Arossus , another  28 called Theocrines , who purchased him a great applause  29 in the playes called Terentini . There were other playes in  30 Rome , called Actia and Pythia , made in the honour of Apollo , for killing the Dragon Python . In those one Æ sopus 31 bare the praise, a man generally esteemed, who left behind him much substance, which Clodius his sonne after possest. Qu ae grauis Æsopus, quae doctus Rossius egit. Labericus was in excellent Poet, and a rare Actor, who  32 writ a booke of the gesture  & action to be vsed by the Tragedians and Comedians in performance of euery part in his natiue humor. Plautus himself was so inamored of the Actors in his dayes, that hee published many excellent and exquisite Comedies, yet extant. Aristotle commends one  33 Theodoretes to be the best Tragedian in his time. This in the presence of Alexander personated Achilles , which so delighted the Emperour, that hee bestowed on him a pension of quinque mille Drachm ae , fiue thousand Drachmaes, and euery thousand Drachmaes are twenty nine pounds, three shillings, foure pence sterling. Rossius , whom the eloquent Orator,  & excellent statesman of Rome, Marcus Cicero , for his elegant pronuntiatio  & formall gesture called his iewell, had from the common Tresury of the Roman Exchequer, a daily pention allowed him of so many Sestertij as in our coine amount to 16 pound  & a marke, or thereabouts, which yearely did arise to any noble mans reuenues. So great was the fame of this Roscius , and so good his estimation, that learned Cato made a question whether Cicero could write better then Roscius could speake and act, or Roscius speake and act better then Cicero write. Many times when they had any important orations, to be with an audible and loud voyce deliuered to the people, they imployed the tongue and memory of this excellent Actor, to whom for his worth, the Senate granted such large exhibition. \--- qu ae peruincere voces , Eualuere sonum referunt quem nostra Theatra, Gorganum mugire putes nemus aut mare Thuscum, Tanto cum strepitu ludi spectaetur & artes. What voyce can be compared with the sound, Our Theaters from their deepe concaues send, For their reuerberate murmures seeme to drownd The Gorgan wood when the proud windes contend. Or when rough stormes the Thuscan billowes raise, With such loud ioy they ring our Arts and Playes. To omit all the Doctors, Zawnyes, Pantaloones, Harlakeenes, in which the French , but especially the Italians , haue beene excellent, and according to the occasion offered to do some right to our English Actors, as Knell, Bentley, Mils, Wilson, Crosse, Lanam , and others: these, since I neuer saw them, as being before my time, I cannot (as an eye-witnesse of their desert) giue them that applause, which no doubt, they worthily merit, yet by the report of many iuditial auditors, their performance of many parts haue been so absolute, that it were a kinde of sinne to drowne their worths in Lethe, and not commit their (almost forgotten) names to eternity. Heere I must needs remember Tarleton , in his time gratious with the Queene his soueraigne, and in the peoples generall applause, whom succeeded VVil. Kemp , as wel in the fauour of her Maiesty, as in the opinion  & good thoughts of the generall audience. Gabriel, Singer, Pope, Phillips, Sly , all the right I can do them, is but this, that though they be dead, their deserts yet liue in the remembrance of many. Among so many dead let me not forget one yet aliue in his time the most worthy famous, Maister Edward Allen . To omit these, as also such as for diuers imperfections, may be thought insufficient for the quality. Actors should be men pick'd out personable, according to the parts they present, they should be rather schollers, that though they canot speake well, know how to speake, or else to haue that volubility that they can speake well, though they vnderstand not what,  & so both imperfections may by instructius be helped & amended but where a good tongue & a good conceit both faile, there can neuer be good actor. I also could wish, that such as are codemned for their licentiousnesse, might by a generall consent bee quite excluded our society: for as we are men that stand in the broad eye of the world, so should our manners, gestures, and behauiours, fauour of such gouernment and modesty, to deserue the good thoughts and reports of all men, and to abide the sharpest censures euen of those that are the greatest opposites to the quality. Many amongst vs, I know, to be of substance, of gouernment, of sober liues, and temperate carriages, house-keepers, and contributary to all duties enioyned them, equally with them that are rank't with the most bountifull; and if amongst so many of sort, there be any few degenerate from the rest in that good demeanor, which is both requisite & expected at their hands, let me entreat you not to censure hardly of all for the misdeeds of some, but rather to excuse vs, as Ouid doth the generality of women. Parcite paucarum diffundere crimer in omnes , Spectetur meritis qu aeq; puellae suis. For some offenders (that perhaps are few) Spare in your thoughts to censure all the crew, Since euery breast containes a sundry spirit, Let euery one be censur' das they merit. Others there are of whom should you aske my opinion, I must refer you to this, Consule Theatrum . Here I might take fit opportunity to reckon vp all our English writers,  & compare them with the Greeke, French, Italian ,  & Latine Poets, not only in their Pastorall, Historicall, Elegeicall ,  & Heroicall Poems, but in their Tragicall ,  & Comical subiects, but it was my chance to happen on the like learnedly done by an approued good scholler, in a booke called Wits Comon-wealth , to which treatise I wholy referre you, returning to our present subiect. Inlius C aesar himselfe for his pleasure became an Actor, being in shape, state, voyce, judgement, and all other occurrents, exterior and interior excellent. Amongst many other parts acted by him in person, it is recorded of him, that with generall applause in his owne Theater he played Hercules Furens , and amongst many other arguments of his compleatnesse, excellence, and extraordinary care in his action, it is thus reported of him: Being in the depth of a passion, one of his seruants (as his part then fell out) presenting Lychas , who before had from Deianeira brought him the poysoned shirt, dipt in the bloud of the Centaure Nessus : he in the middest of his torture and fury, finding this Lychas hid in a remote corner (appoynted him to creep into of purpose) although he was, as our Tragedians vse, but seemingly to kill him by some false imagined wound, yet was C aesar so extremely carryed away with the violence of his practised fury, and by the perfect shape of the madnesse of Hercules , to which he had fashioned all his actiue spirits, that he flew him dead at his foot,  & after swoong him terq; quaterq ; (as the Poet sayes) about his head. It was the manner of their Emperours, in those dayes, in their publicke Tragedies to choose out the fittest amongst such, as for capital offences were condemned to dye, and imploy them in such parts as were to be kil'd in the Tragedy, who of themselues would make suit rather so to dye with resolution, and by the hands of such princely Actors , then otherwise to suffer a shamefull  & most detectable end. And these were Tragedies naturally performed. And such Caius Caligula, Claudius Nero, Vitellius, Dom tianus, Comodus ,  & other Emperours of Rome , vpon their festiuals and holy daies of greatest consecration vsed to act. Therefore M. Kid in the Spanish Tragedy, vpon occasion presenting it selfe, thus writes, Why Nero thought it no disparagement , And Kings and Emperours haue tane delight , To make experience of their wits in playes. These exercises, as traditions haue beene since (though in better manner) continued through all ages, amongst all the noblest Nations of the earth. But I haue promised to be altogether compendious, presuming that what before is discourst, may for the practise of playes, their Antiquity , and Dignity be altogether sufficient. I omit the shewes and ceremonies euen in these times generally vsed amongst the Catholikes, in which by the Churchmen  & most religious, diuers pageants, as of the Natiuity, Passion, and Ascention, with other Historicall places of the Bible, are at diuers times & seasons of the yeare vsually celebrated; sed hae preter me . In the yeare of the world 4207. of Christ 246. Origin writ certaine godly Epistles to Philip , then Emperour of Rome , who was the first Christian Emperour, and in his life I reade, that in the fourth yeare of his reigne, which was the 1000. yeare after the building of Rome , he solemnized that yeare, as a Iubilee with sumptuous pageants and playes. Homer , the most excellent of all Poets, composed his Illiads in the shape of a Tragedy, his Odisseas like a Comedy. Virgil in the first of his Æ neiads , in his description of Didoes Carthage . \--- bic alta Theatris Fundamenta locant alyiminanesq, Columnas, Rupibus excidunt scenis decora alta futuris. Which proues, that in those dayes immediatly after the ruine of Troy , when Carthage had her first foundation, they built Theaters with stately columnes of stone, as in his description may appeare. I haue sufficiently discourst of the first Theaters, and in whose times they were erected, euen till the reigne of lulius C aesar , the first Emperour, and how they continued in their glory from him till the reigne of Marcus Aurelius the 23 Emperour, and from him euen to these times. Now to proue they were in as high estimation at Lacedemon , and Athens two the most famous Citties of Greece. Cicero in his booke Cato maior, seu de senectute. Cum Athenis ludis quidam grandis natu in Theatrum venisset, &c . An ancient Citizen comming into one of the Athenian Theaters to see the pastimes there solemnized (which shewes that the most antient and graue frequented them) by reason of the throng, no man gaue him place or reuerence: but the fame Citizen being imploy'd in an Embassy to Lacedemon , and coming like a priuate man into the Theater, the generall multitude arose at once, and with great ceremonious reuerence gaue his age place. This Cicero alledges to proue the reuerence due to age, and this I may fitly introduce to the approbation of my present subiect. Moreouer, this great Statesman of Rome , at whose exile twenty thousand of the chiefest Roman Citizens wore mourning apparrel, oftentimes commends Plautus , calling him Plautus noster , and Atticorum antiqua Comedia , where he proceeds further to extoll Æ sopus , for personating Aiax , and the famous Actor Rupilius , in Epigonus, Med aea, Menalip, Clytemnestra and Antiopa , proceeding in the same place with this worthy  & graue sentence, Ergo Histrio hoc videbit in scena, quod non videbit sapiens in vita? shall a Tragedian see that in his Scene which a wise man cannot see in the course of his life? So in another of his workes, amongst many instructions to his sonne Marcus , he applauds Turpio Ambinius for his action, Statius, Neuius , and Plautus for their writing. Ouid in Augustu[illeg.] Luminibusq; tuis totus quibus vtitur orbis, Scenica vidisti l[illeg.]sus adulteria. Those eyes with which you all the world suruay, See in your Theaters our Actors play. Augustus C aesar , because he would haue some memory of his loue to those places of pastime, reared in Rome two stately Obelisci, or Pyramides, one in lulius C aesars Temple in the field of Mars , another in the great Theater, called Circus Maximus , built by Flaminius : these were in height an hundred cubits a peece, in bredth foure cubits, they were first raised by King Pheron in the Temple of the Sunne, and after remoued to Rome by Augustus : the occasion of their first composure was this: Pheron for some great crime, committed by him in his youth against the Gods, was by them strooke blinde, and so continued the space of ten yeares: but after by a reuelation in the Citty Bucis , it was told, that if he washt his eyes in the water of a woman that was chaste, and neuer adulterately touch't with any saue her husband, he should againe recouer his sight: the King first tride his wife, then many other of the most graue and best reputed matrons, but continued still in despaire, till at length hee met with one vertuous Lady, by whose chastity his sight was restored; whom (hauing first commanded his Queens and the rest to be consumed with fire) he after married. Pheron in memory of this, builded his two Pyramides, after remoued to Rome by Avgvstvs . Sanctaq; maiestas & erat venerabile nomen, Vatibus \--- The end of the second Booke. the true vse of their quality. diuinis , from diuine sacrifices, they differ thus: In Comedies, turbulent a prima, tranquilla vltima , In Tragedyes, tranquilla prima, turbulenta ultima , Comedies begin in trouble, and end in peace; Tragedies begin in calmes, and end in tempest. Of Comedies there be three kindes, mouing Comedies, called Motori ae , standing Comedies, called Statari ae , or mixt betwixt both, called Mist ae : they are distributed into foure parts, the Prologue , that is, the preface; the Protasis , that is, the proposition, which includes the first Act, and presents the Actors; the Epitasis , which is the businesse and body of the Comedy; the last the Catastrophe , and conclusion: the deffinition of the Comedy, according to the Latins : a dicourse consisting of diuers institutions, comprehending ciuill and domesticke things, in which is taught, what in our liues and manners is to be followed, what to bee auoyded, the Greekes define it thus: ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sb.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/naugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ngr; ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . Cicero faith, a Comedy is the imitation of life, the glasse of custome, and the image of truth, in Athens they had their first originall. The ancient Comedians vsed to attire their actors thus: the old men in white, as the most ancient of all, the yong men in party- coloured garments, to note their diuersity of thoughts, their slaues and seruants in thin and bare vesture, either to note their pouerty, or that they might run the more lighter about their affaires: their Parrasites wore robes that were turned in, and intricately wrapped about them; the fortunate in white, the discontented in decayed vesture, or garments, growne out of fashion; the rich in purple, the poore in crimson, souldiers wore purple jackets, hand-maids the habits of strange virgins, bawds, pide coates, and Curtezans, garments of the colour of mud, to denote their couetousnesse: the stages were hung with rich Arras, which was first brought from King Attalus into Rome : his state-hangings were so costly, that from him all Tapestries, and rich Arras were called Attalia . This being a thing ancient as I haue proued it, next of dignity, as many arguments haue confirmed it, and now euen in these dayes by the best, without exception, fauourably tollerated, why should I yeeld my censure, grounded on such firme and establisht sufficiency, to any Tower, founded on sand, any castle built in the aire, or any triuiall vpstart, and meere imaginary opinion. Oderunt Hilarem tristes tristemq; iocosi. I hope there is no man of so vnsensible a spirit, that can inueigh against the true and direct vse of this quality: Oh but say they, the Romanes in their time, and some in these dayes haue abused it, and therefore we volly out our exclamations against the vse. Oh shallow! Because such a man had his house burnt, we shall quite condemne the vse of fire, because one man quast poyson, we must so beare to drinke, because some haue beene shipwrak't, no man shall hereafter trafficke by sea. Then I may as well argue thus: he cut his finger, therefore must I weare no knife, yond man fell from his horse, therefore must I trauell a foot; that man surfeited, therefore dare not I eate. What can appeare more absurd then such a grosse and sencelesse assertion? I could turne this vnpoynted weapon against his breast that aimes it at mine, and reason thus: Roscius had a large pension allowed him by the Senate of Rome , why should not an Actor of the like desert, haue the like allowance now! or this, the most famous City and Nation in the world held playes in great admiration: Ergo , but it is a rule in Logicke, Exparticularibus [illeg.] fit . These are not the Basses we must build vpon, nor the columnes that must support our architecture. Et [illeg.], & cautus, precingit[illeg.]r enseviator. Ille sedi[illeg.]sid[illeg.]s, me sibiportat opem. Both theeues and true-men, weapons weare alike. Th'one to defend, the other comes to strike. Let vs vse fire to warme vs, not to scortch vs, to make ready our necessaries, not to burne our houses: let vs drinke to quench our thirst, not to surfet; and eate to satisfie nature, not to gormondize. \--- Comediarecta si mente legatur , Constabit nulli posse nocere--- Playes are in vse as they are vnderstood, Spectators eyes may make them bad or good. Shall we condemne a generallity for any one particular misconstruction? giue me then leaue to argue thus: Amongst Kings haue there not beene some tyrants? yet the office of a King is the image of the Maiesty of God. Amongst true subiects haue there not crept in some false traitors? euen amongst the twelue there was one ludas , but shall we for his fault, censure worse of the eleuen? God forbid: art thou Prince or Peasant? art thou of the Nobility, or Commonalty? Art thou merchant or Souldier? of the Citty or Country? Art thou Preacher or Auditor? Art thou Tutor or Pupill? There haue beene of thy function bad and good, prophane and holy. I induce these instances to confirme this common argument, that the vse of any generall thing is not for any one particular abuse to be condemned: for if that assertion stood sirme, wee should run into many notable inconueniences. Quilocus est templis angustior banc quoq vitet , An culpans siqua est ingeniosasuam , To proceed to the matter: First playing is an ornament to the Citty, which strangers of all Nations repairing hither, report of in their Countries, beholding them here with some admiration: for what variety of entertainment can there be in any Citty of Christendome, more then in London ? But some will say this dish might be very well spared out of the banquet: to him I answere, Diogenes , that vsed too feede on rootes, cannot relish a March- pane. Secondly, our English tongue, which hath ben the most harsh, vneuen, and broken language of the world, part Dutch , part Irish, Saxon, Scotch, Welsh , and indeed a gallimaffry of many, but perfect in none, is now by this secondary meanes of playing, continually refined, euery writer striuing in himselfe to adde a new florish vnto it; so that in processe, from the most rude and vnpolisht tongue, it is growne to a most perfect and composed language, and many excellent workes, and elaborate Poems writ in the same, that many Nations grow inamored of our tongue (before despised.) Neither Saphicke, Ionicke, Iambicke, Phaleuticke, Adonicke, Gliconicke, Hexamiter, Tetramitrer, Pentamiter Asclepediacke, Choriambicke, nor any other measured verse vsed amongst the Greekes, Latins, Italians. French, Dutch , or Spanish writers, but may be exprest in English , be it in blanke verse, or meeter, in Distichon, or Hexastichon, or in what forme or feet, or what number you can desire. Thus you see to what excellency our refined English is brought, that in these daies we are ashamed of that Euphony & eloquence which within these 60 yeares, the best tongues in the land were proud to pronounce. Thirdly, playes haue made the ignorant more apprehensiue taught the vnlearned the knowledge of many famous histories, instructed such as caanot reade in the discouery of all our English Chronicles:  & what man haue you now of that weake capacity, that cannot discourse of any notable thing recorded euen from William the Conquerour , nay from the landing of Brute , vntill this day, beeing possest of their true vse, For, or because Playes are writ with this ayme, and carryed with this methode, to teach the subiects obedience to their King, to shew the people the vntimely ends of such as haue moued tumults, commotions, and insurrections, to present the with the flourishing estate of such as liue in obedience, exhorting  34 them to allegeance, dehorting them from all trayterous and fellonious stratagems. Omne genus scripti grauitate Tragedia vincit. If we present a Tragedy, we include the fatall and abortiue ends of such as commit notorious murders, which is  35 aggrauated and acted with all the Art that may be, to terrifie men from the like abhorred practises. If wee present a forreigne History, the subiect is so intended, that in the liues of Romans, Grecians , or others, either the vertues of our Country-men are extolled, or their vices reproued, as thus, by the example of C aesar to stir souldiers to valour, & magnanimity: by the fall of Pompey , that no man trust in his owne strength: we present Alexander , killing his friend in his rage, to reproue rashnesse: Mydas , choked with his gold, to taxe couetousnesse: Nero against tyranny: Sardanapalus , against luxury: Nynus , against ambition, with infinite others, by sundry instances, either animating men to  36 noble attempts, or attaching the consciences of the spectators, finding themselues toucht in presenting the vices of others. If a morall, it is to perswade men to humanity and good life, to instruct them in ciuility and good manners,  37 shewing them the fruits of honesty, and the end of villany. Versibus exponi Tragicisres Comica non vult. Againe, Horace, Arte Po etica. Et nostri proavi Plautinos & numeros et Laudauvere sales \--- If a Comedy, it is pleasantly contriued with merry accidents, and intermixt with apt and witty iests, to present before the Prince at certain times of solemnity, or else merily fitted to the stage. And what is then the subject of this harmelesse mirth? either in the shape of a Clowne, to shew others their slouenly and vnhansome behauiour, that they may reforme that simplicity in themselues, which others make their sport, lest they happen to become the like subiect of generall scorne to an auditory, else it intreates of loue, deriding foolish inamorates, who spend their ages, their spirits, nay themselues, in the seruile and ridiculous imployments of their Mistresses: and these are mingled with sportfull accidents, to recreate such as of themselues are wholly deuoted to Melancholly, which corrupts the bloud: or to refresh such weary spirits as are tired with labour, or study, to moderate the cares and heauinesse of the minde, that they may returne to their trades and faculties with more zeale and earnestnesse, after some small soft and pleasant retirement. Sometimes they discourse of Pantaloones, Vsurers that haue vnthrifty sonnes, which both the fathers and sonnes may behold to their instructions sometimes of Curtesans, to diuulge their subtelties and snares, in which yong men may be intangled, shewing them the meanes to auoyd them. If we present a Pastorall, we shew  38 the harmelesse loue of Sheepheards diuersly moralized, distinguishing betwixt the craft of the Citty, and the innocency of the sheep-coat. Briefly, there is neither Tragedy, History, Comedy, Morrall or Pastorall, from which an infinite vse cannot be gathered. I speake not in the defence of any lasciuious shewes, scurrelous ieasts, or scandalous inuectiues: If there be any such, I banish them quite from my patronage; yet Horace, Sermon 1\. Satyr 4\. thus writes. Eupol is at q Cratinus Aristophanesq; Poetae , Atque aly quorum Comadia prisca virorum est: Si quis erat dignus describi, quod malus, aut fur, Quod Maechus foret, aut sicarius, aut alioqui, Famosus, multa cum libertate not abunt. Eupolis, Cratinus, Aristophanes , and other Comike Poets in the time of Horace , with large scope, and vnbridled liberty boldly and plainly scourged all such abuses as in their ages were generally practised, to the staining and blemishing of a faire and beautifull Common- weale. Likewise, a learned Gentleman in his Apology for Poetry, speakes thus: Tragedies well handled be a most worthy kinde of Poesie. Comedies make men see and shame at their faults, and proceeding further amongst other Vniuersity- playes, he remembers the Tragedy of Richard the third, acted in Saint Iohns in Cambridge , so essentially, that had the tyrant Phaleris beheld his bloudy proceedings, it had mollified his heart, and made him relent at sight of his inhumane massacres. Further, he commends of Comedies, the Cambridge Pedantius , and the Oxford Bellum Grammaticale ; and leauing them passes on to our publicke playes, speaking liberally in their praise, and what commendable vse may bee gathered of them. If you peruse Margarita Po etica , you may see what excellent vses and sentences he hath gathered out of Terence his Andrea, Euenuchus , and the rest. Likewise out of Plautus his Amphitrio, Asinaria , and moreouer, Ex comediys Philodoxis, Carolis Acretini: Defalsa Hip[illeg.] erita & tristi Mere[illeg.]ry, Ronsy versellensis: Ex Comaedia Philanira Vgolinip parmensis , all reuerend schollers, and Comicke Poets, reade elce the 4 Tragedies, Philunica, Petrus, Aman, Katherina, Claudy R[illeg.]iletti Beluensis : But I should tire my selfe to reckon the names of all French, Roman, German, Spanish, Italian , and English Poets, being in number infinite, and their labours extant to approue their worthinesse. Is thy minde Noble? and wouldst thou be further stir'd vp to magnanimity? Behold, vpon the stage thou maist see Hercules, Achilles, Alexander, C aesar, Alcibiades, Lysander, Sertorius, Haniball, Antigonus, Phillip of Macedon, Methridates of 'Pontus, Pyrrbus of Epire, Agesilaus , among the Lacedemonians, Ep[illeg.]min[illeg.]dus amongst the Thehans: Sceuola alone entring the armed tents of Por[illeg.]: Horatius Chocles alone withstanding the whole army of the Hetrurians[illeg.] Leomides of Sparta , choosing a Lyon to leade a band of Deere, rather then one Deere to conduct an army of Lyons, with infinite others in their owne persons qualities,  & shapes, animating thee with courage, deterring thee fro cowardise. Hast thou of thy Country well deserued? and art thou of thy labour euill requited? to associate thee thou mayest see the valiant Roman Marcellus pursue Hannibal at Nola , conquering Syracusa , vanquishing the Gauls , all Padua , and presently (for his reward) banisht his Country into Greece . There thou mayest see Scipio Affricanus , now triumphing for the conquest of all Affrica , and immediatly exil'd the confines of Romania . Art thou inclined to lust? behold the falles of the Tarquins , in the rape of Lucrecea : the gucrdon of luxury in the death of Sardanapalus: Appius destroyed in the rauishing of Virginia , and the destruction of Troy in the lust of Helena . Art thou proud? our Scene presents thee with the fall of Phaeton, Narcissus pining in the loue of his shadow, ambitious Hamon , now calling himselfe a God, and by and by thrust headlong among the Diuels. We present men with the vglinesse of their vices, to make them the more to abhorre them, as the Persians vse, who aboue all sinnes, loathing drunkennesse, accustomed in their solemne feasts, to make their seruants and captiues extremely ouercome with wine, and then call their children to view their nasty and lothsome behauiour, making them hate that sin in themselues, which shewed so grosse and abhominable in others. The like vse may be gathered of the drunkards so naturally imitated in our playes, to the applause of the Actor, content of the auditory, and reprouing of the vice. Art thou couetous? go no further then Plautus his Comedy called Exclia , Dumsallax servus, durns pater, improba lena Vixerit, & meretrix[illeg.] landa, Menandros erit. While the's false servant, or obdurate sire, Sly band, smooth whore, Menandros wee'l admire. To end in a word, Art thou addicted to prodigallity? enuy? cruelty? periury? flattery? or rage? our Scenes affoord thee store of men to shape your liues by, who be frugall, louing, gentle, trusty, without soothing, and in all things temperate. Wouldst thou be honourable? iust, friendly, moderate, deuout, mercifull, and louing concord? thou mayest see many of their fates and ruines, who haue beene dishonourable, iniust, false, gluttenous, sacrilegious, bloudy-minded, and brochers of dissention. Women likewise that are chaste, are by vs extolled, and encouraged in their vertues, being instanced by Diana, Belphebe, Matilda, Lucrece and the Countesse of Salisbury . The vnchaste are by vs shewed their errors, in the persons of Phrin e, Lais, Thais, Flora : and amongst vs. Rosamond , and Mistresse Shore . What can sooner print modesty in the soules of the wanton, then by discouering vnto them the monstrousnsse of their sin? It followes that we proue these exercises to haue beene the discouerers of many notorious murders, long concealed from the eyes of the world. To omit all farre-fetcht instances, we wil proue it by a domestike, and home-borne truth, 39 which within these few yeares happened. At Lin in Norfolke , the then Earle of Sussex players acting the old History of Fryer Francis ,  & presenting a woman, who insatiately doting on a young gentleman, had (the more securely to enjoy his affection) mischieuously and seceretly murdered her husband, whose ghost haunted her, and at diuers times in her most solitary and priuate contemplations, in most horrid and fearefull shapes, appeared, and stood before her. As this was acted, a townes-woman (till then of good estimation and report) finding her conscience (at this presenment) extremely troubled, suddenly skritched and cryd out Oh my husband, my husband! I see the ghost of my husband fiercely threatning and menacing me. At which shrill and vexpected out-cry, the people about her, moou'd to a strange amazement, inquired the reason of her clamour, when presently vn-urged, she told them that seuen yeares ago, she, to be possest of such a Gentleman (meaning him) had poysoned her husband, whose fearefull image personated it selfe in the shape of that ghost: whereupon the murdresse was apprehended, before the Iustices further examined, & by her voluntary confession after condemned. That this is true, as well by the report of the Actors as the records of the Towne, there are many eye-witnesses of this accident yet liuing, vocally to confirme it. As strange an accident happened to a company of the  40 same quality some 12 yeares ago or not so much, who playing late in the night at a place called Perin in Cornwall , certaine Spaniards were landed the same night vnsuspected, and vndiscouered, with intent to take in the towne, spoyle and burne it, when suddenly, euen vpon their entrance, the players (ignorant as the townes-men of any such attempt) presenting a battle on the stage with their drum and trumpets strooke vp alowd alarme: which the enemy hearing, and fearing they were discouered, amazedly retired, made some few idle shot in a brauado, and so in a hurly-burly fled disorderly to their boats. At the report of this tumult, the townes-men were immediatly armed, and pursued them to the sea, praying God for their happy deliuerance from so great a danger, who by his prouidence made these strangers the instrument and secondary meanes of their escape from such imminent mischife, and the tyranny of so remorceless an enemy. Another of the like wonder happened at Amsterdam in  41 Holland , a company of our English Comedians (well knowne) trauelling those Countryes, as they were before the Burgers and other the chiefe inhabitants, acting the last part of the 4 sons of Aymon , towards the last act of the history, where penitent Renaldo , like a common labourer, liued in disguise, vowing as his iast pennance, to labour  & carry burdens to the structure of a goodly Church there to be erected: whose diligence the labourers enuying, since by-reason of his stature and strength, hee did vsually perfect more worke in a day, then a dozen of the best, (hee working for his conscience, they for their lucres.) Whereupon by reason his industry had so much disparaged their liuing, conspired amongst themselues to kill him, waiting some opportunity to finde him asleepe, which they might casily doe, since the forest labourers are the soundest sleepers, and industry is the best preparatiue to rest. Hauing spy'd their opportunity, they draue a naile into his temples, of which would immediatly he dyed. As the Actors handled this, the audience might on a sodaine vnderstand an out-cry, and loud shrike in a remote gallery, and pressing about the place, they might perceiue a woman of great grauity, strangely amazed, who with a distracted & troubled braine oft sighed out these words: Oh my husband, my husband! The play, without further interruption proceeded; the woman was to her owne house conducted, without any apparant suspition, euery one coniecturing as their fancies led them. In this agony she some few dayes languished, and on a time, as certaine of her well disposed neighbours came to comfort her, one amongst the rest being Church-warden, to him the Sexton posts, to tell him of a strange thing happening him in the ripping vp of a graue: see here (quoth he) what I haue found, and shewes them a faire skull, with a great nayle pierst quite through the braine-pan, but we cannot coniecture to whom it should belong, nor how long it hath laine in the earth, the graue being confused, and the flesh consumed. At the report of this accident, the woman, out of the trouble of her afflicted conscience, discouered a former murder. For 12 yeares ago, by driuing that nayle into that skull, being the head of her husband, she had trecherously slain him. This being publickly confest, she was arraigned, condemned, adiudged, and burned. But I draw my subiect to greater length then I purposed: these therefore out of other infinites, I haue collected, both for their familiarnesse and latenesse of memory. Thus our Antiquity we haue brought from the Grecians in the time of Hercules : from the Macedonians in the age of Alexander : from the Romans long before Iulius C aesar , and since him, through the reigns of 23 Emperours succeeding, euen to Marcus Aurelius : after him they were supported by the Mantuans, Venetians, Valencians, Neopolitans , the Florentines , and others: since, by the German Princes, the Pulsgraue , the Landsgraue , the Dukes of Saxony , of Brounswicke ,  &c. The Cardinall at Bruxels , hath at this time in pay, a  42 company of our English Comedians. The French King allowes certaine companies in Paris, Orleans , besides other Cities: so doth the King of Spaine , in Ciuill, Madrill , and other prouinces. But in no Country they are of that eminence that ours are: so our most royall, and euer renouned soueraigne, hath licenced vs in London: so did his predecessor, the thrice vertuous virgin, Queene Elizabeth , and before her, her sister, Queene Mary, Edward the sixth, and their father, Henry the eighth: and before these in the tenth yeare of the reigne of Edward the fourth, Anno 1490\. Iohn Stowe , an ancient and graue Chronicler, records (amongst other varieties tending to the like effect) that a play was acted at a place called Skinners well, fast by Clerken-well, which continued eight dayes, and was of matter from Adam and Eue , (the first creation of the world.) The spectators were no worse then the Royalty of England . And amongst other commendable exercises in this place, the Company of the Skinners of London held certaine yearely solemne playes. In place wherof, now in these latter daies, the wrastling, and such other pastimes haue been kept, and  43 is still held about Bartholmew-tide . Also in the yeare 1390. the 14 yeare of the reigne of Richard the second the 18. of Iuly, were the like Enterludes recorded of at the same place, which continued 3 dayes together, the King and Queene, and Nobility being there present. Moreouer, to this day, in diuers places of England , there be townes that hold the priuiledge of their Faires, and other Charters by yearely stage-playes, as at Manningtree in Suffolke, Kendall in the North ,  & others. To let these passe, as things familiarly knowne to all men. Now to speake of some abuse lately crept into the quality, as an inueighing against the State, the Court, the Law, the Citty, and their gouernements, with the particularizing of priuate mens humors (yet aliue) Noble-men, & others. I know it distastes many; neither do I any way approue it, nor dare I by any meanes excuse it. The liberty which some arrogate to themselues, committing their bitternesse, and liberall inuectiues against all estates, to the mouthes of Children, supposing their iuniority to be a priuiledge for any rayling be it neuer so violent, I could aduise all such, to curbe and limit this presumed liberty within the bands of discretion and gouernment. But wise and iuditial Censurers, before whom such complaints shall at any time hereafter come, wil not (I hope) impute these abuses to any transgression in vs, who haue euer been carefull and prouident to shun the like. I surcease to prosecute this any further, lest my good meaning be (by some) misconstrued: and fearing likewise, lest with tediousnesse I tire the patience of the fauourable Reader, heere (though abruptly) I conclude my third and last Treatise. [illeg.] opes, mihi parvulares est. negligence of the Printer, as the misquotations, mistaking of sillables, misplacing halfe lines, coining of strage and neuer heard of words. These being without number, when I would haue taken a particular account of the Errata , the Printer answered me, hee would not publish his owne disworkemanship, but rather let his owne fault lye vpon the necke of the Author: and being fearefull that others of his quality, had beene of the same nature, and condition, and finding you on the contrary, so carefull, and industrious, so serious and laborious to doe the Author all the rights of the presse, I could not choose but gratulate your honest indeauours with this short remembrance. Here likewise, I must necessarily insert a manifest iniury done me in that worke, by taking the two Epistles of Paris to Helen , and Helen to Paris , and printing them in a lesse volume, vnder the name of another, which may put the world in opinion I might steale them from him; and hee to doe himselfe right, hath since published them in his owne name: but as I must acknowledge my lines not worthy his patronage, vnder whom he hath publisht them, so the Author I know much offended with M. Iaggard (that altogether vnknowne to him) presumed to make so bold with his name. These, and the like dishonesties I know you to bee cleere of; and I could wish but to bee the happy Author of so worthy a worke as I could willingly commit to your care and workmanship. Yours euer
