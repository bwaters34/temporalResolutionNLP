But if loue and gratitude be lawdable effects, in what forme soeuer they appeare, then haue not I broken any condition of decorum , in consecrating this worke to your illustrious honour. It bare the badge of an honorable Patron in the originall: and I could make it doe no lesse in the translation. And for mine election, the worlds generall decay of the esteeme of learning, in those breasts that haue best meanes to support it, and the farre-spread fame of your glory, by that Phoenix-bounty that hath left all the land to build her nest in your bosome, these motiues haue more then induced mee to approache so neere, that bright lustre your Honour lights the world with, as to beare one part in the Hymnes of your prayses, by this dutifull dedication. And (good my Lord) herein bee you my seauen-fold shield against the shott of all those blistered mouthes, whose most felicitie is to mis- interprete most maliciouslie: Or doe but giue mee foote-holde, and then let mee alone to beate all their disgraces about their owne eares, and the whole worlds, in a true Satyrick furie; in an Ariostoes Swanne, that shall snatch their names from times all-wasting skirt, and beare them vp, to euer-lasting recorde in the Temple of Infamie. But for my dutie to your sacred vertues, let this expresse mee: I will bee that Bolognian dogge, whose faith purchased him this Epitaph: that hee did alwayes  Latrai a ladri, & a gli amanti tacqui, &c.  Barke lowd at theeues, and make them euer faile: But whe friends came, lay down, & wagd his taile. Such am I: consecrated to your Lordships seruice: and vnder the protection of this mine owne zeale, aduenture to present you with A discouerie and no discouerie, of a world and no world, both knowne and vnknowne, by a traueller that neuer trauelled.

I was already fully acquainted with all the rarities of mine owne Nation: and falling into a discourse of the profit of trauell with two Aliens of my neare acquaintance ( Peter Beroaldus , a Frenchman, and Adrian Cornelius Droge , a Dutchman) wherein wee had many delightfull passages about comparisons of languages, conditions, and cities; at last, In troth (quoth Beroaldus ) I know not as yet what trauell meanes, if hee that leaues his natiue soyle to passe but into a neighbour countrie, or ouer a neighbour riuer (admit it bee the Rhine, or the Tweed) deserue this name (as vulgar opinion seemes to allow) whereas hee neuer changes eyther skie, ayre, or soyle: I see not (if this bee true) any profit or worth in the world, contained in trauell. My parents  & friends at Montauban , haue written very often for my returne, as though I were farre from them: whereas I (beleeue mee) haue imagined my selfe all this whole two yeares at home: for how little a way is it from Mount-auban to Paris , from Paris to Callis , from Callis to Douer ? Truely when I thinke of the land, it seemes about an elle: in the Mappe a finger-breadth: in the forme of the heauens, iust nothing. Nor see I any reason why that France should bee held my natiue soyle more then all Europe : for if you stand vpon diuersity of language, how many languages (I pray yee) haue yee in Europe quite different from the French ? If the conditions of the nations mooue yee, view not Europe , but view the whole world, and euery Prouince thereof, leaning to the qualities of those that adioyne vpon it. as the Polipus turnes into the colour of euery stone shee comes neere! O Beroaldus (quoth I againe) but we do enuie at the licence you haue to contemne trauell: wee (wretches) that like Tortoyses, are bound to our owne houses, whilest you haue taken suruey of all the worlds singularities, and now that you are filled with their knowledge, you set them at nought thus. Might I but view the Snowie Alpes , or the shady Pyrenes , oh how much should I thinke my selfe beholding to mine eyes at my resting time, when all that I had seene should turne to my benefit, and store mine vnderstanding with a fresh fraught of knowledge! Ah how much (quoth Beroaldus ) doth absence promise him that would bee present, and how vaine are the hopes that attend on ignorance! friend, when I was at home, vnexperienced, I thought as you do; but triall hath now taught me to see mine owne simplicity. A trauell of so small toyle yeelds easie satisfaction: and in this, your expectation shall exceede your experience in all those nouelties. Forreine parts are so like ours, that you cannot thinke them strange to yee, though you neuer saw them before. And what is there in all the knowne world, which mapps, and authors cannot instruct a man in, as perfectly as his owne eyes? your England is described by Cambden : what vnderstanding man is there, that cannot, out of him, make as perfect a description of any cittie, riuer, monument, or wonder in all your Ile, as well as if hee had viewed it in person himselfe? What part of Europe is there that affoords more to a strangers eye then is related by one pen-man or other? The seuerall conditions of the people are all described already: as farre as eyther pen, or experience can set downe: but neither can giue any vniuersall knowledge. The French are commonly called rash, the Spaniard proud; the Dutch drunken; the English the busi-bands; the Italians effeminate; the Swethen timoroas, the Bohemians inhumaine; the Irish barbarous and superstitious: but is any man so sottish, as to thinke that France hath no staid man at all in it; Spaine , no meacock; or Germanie none that liues soberly? They are fooles (beleeue it) that will tie mens manners so firme vnto the starres, that they will leaue nothing to a mans owne power, nothing to the parents natures, nothing to nurture and education. View this Pernassus here, whereon we liue: Suppose here were a Colledge of Italians, Spanish, French, Danes, Dutch and Polacques ? doe you thinke to finde more varietie of dispositions in this company of Students, then you may doe amongst your owne English ? Turne yee therefore which way yee will, I cannot see how this halfe a foote trauell can benefit vs any waye, excepting that wee may reape some annimation to learning by the sight of such great Schollers, as Whitaker, Raynolds, Bellarmine, Beza, Iunius, Lipsius , and such like as those vvere. Indeede I holde, that your Drake and your Candish were trauellers, as also Sebastian Delcano , the Portughesse , because their voyages put girdles about the whole world: Nay I will allow Chrystopher Colono that name also, for his discouerie of the West Indies, Francesco Piccaro , and Almagro for Peru, Hernando Magellano for the Moluccaes , and Sir Hugh Willoughbye for his Northren discoueries: together with all such as eyther haue first found out vnknowne regions, or haue brought them to order. And truly (I will tell you two plaine) my minde doth prompt me with some noble enterprise of this kinde, such as the world might gaze at, and all posterity record with admiration. With that hee blusht, and held his peace, as if he had blabd some bold secret. Yea Beroaldus (quoth Drogius to him) & dare you not speake it out? doe you imagine to torture our mindes with setting them on worke vpon doubtfull inquiries, or is your modest secret (hetherto so closely suppressed) afraide to aduenture vpon so many eares at once? Nay speake what ere it bee, wee haue cleere browes (looke you) open eares, and faithfull hearts: nor can your vnknowne enterprise come to light eyther vvith more securitie, or fitter occasion. Well Drogius well, (quoth Beroaldus ) you take my silence in no good sence, but mixe it with your coniectures, that though great matters neuer goe but (like as Princes doe with their numerous traines) with a great preamble of ambiguous tearmes; yet that I should not doe so, but vent a pondrous conceite, a birth that my braine hath trauelld a yeare with, all naked, without any praemonitions. In truth I resolued at the first to let you know it: marry not with-out some graduall proceedings, and materiall preparations, without which, I know well how fond the vvisest proiect doth commonly seeme: but now I see my selfe chayned to a head-long discouerie mauger my beard, vnlesse I should giue you iust cause to call my loue to you both, in question. Wherefore you shall know it: sooner (I assure you) then I did intend, but with no lesse willingnesse: Onely imagine you, that you haue already heard mine intended premonition. It hath euer offended mee to looke vpon the Geographicall mapps, and finde this: Terra Australis, nondum Cognita . The vnknowne Southerne Continent. What good spirit but would greeue at this? If they know it for a Continent, and for a Southerne Continent, why then doe they call it vnknowne? But if it bee vnknowne; why doe all the Geographers describe it after one forme and site? Idle men that they are, that can say, this it is, and yet wee know it not: How long shall wee continue to bee ignorant in that vvhich vvee professe to haue knowledeg of? Certe si nemo vnquam \---vv---Fragilem truci Commisisset Pelago ratem If none had euer beeen So bold as to expose the slender barke vnto the Oceans teene Then vvee might haue had some excuse for our obstinate (wee may euen as vvell confesse it) and notorious idlenesse: But seeing all is opened now; seeing there is not a ship-boy but knows all the vvindes, creekes, shelfes and harbours of the whole world; flie vpon this slouth of ours, this more then female feare, this vaine carelesnesse, that vvittingly and willingly robbes vs of another world. What colour haue vve for it? vvhat feare vve? shadowes, or our selues? there is heauen, there is earth in that continent, & there is men, perhaps more ciuill then wee are. Who euer expected such wit, such gouernment in China ? such arts, such practise of all cunning? wee thought learning had dwelt in our corner of the world: they laugh at vs for it, and well may: auouching that they of al the earth, are two-ey'd men, the Europians the one eyd, and all the world else, starke blind. But admit there be no men in this climate: it is a shame for a wise man either to feare or complaine of solitarinesse. These thoughts haue fired my brest full often: and whilest others neglect them, haue kindled a bold attempt in mee, beyond the rest. I see the land lye vnknowne; no man dreames of it; I will assay to discouer it. Your enterprise Beroaldus (quoth I) is great, and almost more then mortall power can execute. How euer it succeede, I applaude your generous spirit, as like your owne: but as you said, great matters, as they require many praemonitions, so doe they more premeditations. Haue you therefore cast your full account of the dangers, labours, hopes, expences, and all other such accidents as must attend this your attempt? There is heauen you say: there may bee so, and yet you bee kept from the sight of it by perpetuall darkenesse. There is earth; but you may bee driuen out of that by beasts and serpents: There are men: but perhaps you had rather want their company, when you know them, then haue it. If one of you Patagonian Giants should catch your and eate you quite vp, where are you then my fine discouerer? It is good thinking of those thing, but it is dangerous trying. O sir (saith Beroaldus againe) you know not that the Cape of good hope lies ouer against this land. We must hope, and wee must dare. Those bug-beares of dangers at fit to fright babies: but they anymate bolder spirits. If we should sticke at them, wee should neuer looke out at our owne dores. That was the cause America lay so long vnknowne, and had done still (for ought I see) but that GOD sent a Doue from Heauen, which plucking of an Oliue branch from this Continent, taught vs by that, that there was yet more land, and lesse sea then wee dreamed of: O how sacred shall his name be held with all posterity! His statue shalbe aduanced, for vs al to gaze vpon whilst earth keepes her foundation. It is as great a glory (thinke I) to bee called The new worlds discouerer , as her conqueror . And why may not wee haue that successe, and the like glory? I am the more excited to this, by that ancient, and famous prophecy of Seneca , which remayneth vnto vs to fulfill. 1 \------ Venient annis Secula seris, quando Oceanus Vnicula rerum laxet, & ingens Pateat Tellus. \---When certaine years are spent Hereafter; shall the spumy Ocean shew His secret store, and ope to mortals view \---A larger continent. What can be spoken more plaine, to point out this discouery? Here did Drogius replie: What Man? beware how you raise so great a building on so weake a foundation. Your Doue hath fulfilled your Poets coniectures, all of them, alreadie. The summe of yeares is now runne: America is that large continent. Dreame you of any other either age, or discouery? I know the generality of your opinion (quoth Beroaldus ) but I doubt of the truth, for Prophecies are alwaies de futuro : and what if I prooue the countrie America to be knowne to former ages? If I doe, Senecaes wordes are no presage, but an intimation of a thing done. Now I am fully perswaded that some part of these west Indies was that Ophir , where Salomons and Hirams nauy had their gold. For whereas there are fiue seuerall opinionists touching this, viz. 1. Rabanus, Maurus and Nicholaus de Lyra , affirming that Ophir was in the East-Indies. 2. Volateranus , and Ortelius , auoutching it to bee an Island in the Ethiopian Ocean, from an apocryphall relation of one Lewis Venetus; 3. Gaspar Varerius , who affirmed all that was contayned in Pegu, Malaca , and Sumatra , to be whilom called by this name. 4\. Francis Vatablus whom Colonus also (as P. Martyr saith) did follow: who said that Hispaniola was Ophir. 5. William Postellus, Goropius Becanus , and Arias Montanus , all which auoutch directly that Ophir was this continent in which Peru lieth. Of these the two last, and likeliest, make for vs, I care not which you take. The first two, Varerius hath ouerthrowne, horse & foote: to ad more were too superfluous. Sufficeth only that I proue him erroneous, in putting Pegu, Sumatra & Malaca for Ophir . And first, holy writ saith plaine, that those two nauies were two years out, in each of their voiages to Ophir : but ye space of 10. months, or 12. at the most, will serue to passe and returne from the red sea to Sumatra : how then can this proposition of time agree with his opinion? what can Varerius say to this: that nauigation was not exact then, as the Portugalls haue made it since, and therefore in such a vast roome for ignorance, the nauies might spend the more in a wrong course. Well sir, but how came Salomon to the knowledge of this farre distant land? From God you say, I beleeue yee. So then, hee that taught him that there was such a land, and that there was gold in such a land, and aduised him to send thither, would not hee (thinke you) shew him the right way thether? Againe, the time of their being out is alwaies set downe but one: at the end of which they euermore returned, neither staying longer, nor comming sooner: which proues the distance of the place, and not the error of the sailers. Lastly, but transpose one letter, and they are all one. Let mee therefore hold you for incredulous obstinates if you confesse not that America was knowne long before Senecaes time. You are victor Beroaldus , quoth I, and may now lawfully triumph: But admit that it was knowne to Salomon , and his nauigators; doth it follow therefore that it was discouered to the whole world besides, and such as had no commerce at all with the Iewes ? or might not the memory of it bee vtterly extinct before the later times of the Romaines ? Which if it were, your opinion and Senecaes presage are both ouerthrowne. Nay nay, quoth Beroaldus , I am not so easily disheartened with shadowes of reason. This fit doubt of yours, giues mee the stronger foote- hold. History is not silent in this discouery, but preserues the memory of it euen vnto the last posterities of the Romans . For you know that from Salomon to the building of Carthage was little lesse then 150. yeares. But the Carthaginians (as Aristotle witnesseth, nor can I beleeue that they did this in their Citties infancie) after a tedious nauigation did finde an Island beyond the Gades , (which can bee none but this) situate in the Atlantike sea; wherevpon they made a law (which is a true signe that neither did they people it, nor the rest of the world, as then, commonly knew it) that none should euer saile thether againe; fearing least the wealthy and pleasant soile should allure the Citizens to leaue Carthage and go dwell there. Now the Grecians hauing this knowledge of it from Carthage , how should it bee euer kept from Rome ? But sirs, kicke against the truth as long as you list, or yeeld to it as I doe: I am most firmely perswaded that Senecaes large continent is yet vndiscouered, and staies to yeeld vs this glorie, if we dare venter on it. For my selfe; I am comming (my world) after so many vowes, and delaies, now I come at last, all fraight with hope and confidence, either to vnmaske thee to Europe , or to lay my bones in thee. And you (my friends and fellowes) if there bee any true vertue, or loue of glory in your breasts, goe and share with mee in my fortunes in this great enterprise. Shame goe with those frozen bosomes that affect nothing but security and inglorious estate; that like no sepulcher but of the nations earth where they first breathed: We shall thirst, we shall be sicke, wee shall perish , O base hearing! vnseemely for a Philosopher once to think vpo! And shaming the thoughts of trauellers, of such as seeke out a new world, and scorne this olde one. There wanteth nothing but a good will. If yee bee men take that will vnto yee, arme your selues against weake opinatiuenesse, and let vs vndertake that iourney which may be perhaps, delightfull, and cannot but proue glorious vnto vs howsoeuer it may seeme laborious. If not, lusk at home with vigour without honor: I will finde some that shall beare mee company in this famous enterprise, whose after renowne you may perhaps enuy too late. Here he stopt his speech, and beheld vs with an eye somewhat disturbed. His pithy speech (whereof I cannot rehearse the tenth part) mooued vs much, and so did our desires of nouelty and glorie: briefely, wee assented, and resolued all to assay this great discouerie, and embarked our selues in a ship called The Fancie , taking our leaues of all our friends and acquaintance. After three daies wee arriued on the Belgique shores, and at the weekes end in Aquitane : but Drogius staied behinde at Delfe , and Beroaldus left mee here and departed vnto Monutauban , against both their wills: exposing mee to the derision of all mine acquaintance, after their great expectation of this our discouerie vnlesse I would proceede, and aduenture vpon all those vnknowne perills alone. Yet this vnexpected departure of theirs did not ouer-come my resolution, but I would needes forwards, and hauing (after two yeares) passed the Canaries , the coasts of Affrica , and Monomotapa : At last I arriued at that promontory of Tenter-belly , which is called Il Cabo Negro . would haue thee to be,) who since this new Discouery of the South Indies , vpon some ouer-sight of mine owne, in not giuing sufficient intimation of the grounds whence I had the first light of the said Discouery , as also of the manner wherein I haue proceeded vpon the said grounds haue out-runne their owne iudgments: in descanting farre otherwise of this worke, then a fauourable censure would euer haue held it to deserue, and being either lead with too much zeale to the well deseruing vertues of that Reuerend man that long agoe laid the first proiect of this Discouery , or with (it may be a true) obseruation of some imperfection in mee that now of late haue raised this new building vpon that old foundation: haue taken occasion both to thinke him lesse worthy of their good conceites, and also to proclaime me a iust deseruer of the seuerest and most exemplary censures. Which wrong done vnto him (whome I must euer reuerence) hath bound mee to make an ingenuous acknowledgement of mine owne forgetfulnesse in the first edition of this present worke, rather then to sit still and see his reputation exposed to the misconstructions to which my negligence is ( & in some iudgements, iustly) imagined to haue giuen the first and originall cause. But let this protestation be (if it may be) sufficient to remooue the weight of sinister imputations from his grauity, and lay them vpon mine owne youthfulnesse, that I dare engage my life, there is no man in the whole world, who hath either conuersed with himselfe in person, or his workes in print, that euer will surmise this present copy to haue had any testimony of his acknowledgement, or approbation to bee any way befitting his place, or (which is more) his profession. Wherefore to giue a full answere vnto that grosse misprision of theirs, who imagine the worke it selfe to haue beene of his writing and publishing in the forme wherein it now passeth; whereby they take occasion to taxe him of diuers (in their iudgement) immodest, light, scurrilous, and ridiculous passages therein. I doe here absolutely auerre, and giue notice to all that shall hereafter take view hereof, This worke was neuer his, he neuer saw it, neuer dreamed of any such matter, vntill hee met it in the hand of another man. There was indeed a little booke some 8. or 9. yeares agoe that came from Franckford , which some few (I know not vpon what illumination more then ordinary) affirmed to haue passed the file of his muse, which if it be true, it can be no way in the world either preiudiciall to his learning, (seeing it hath all perfection fitting an absolute poeme) nor to his grauity or profession, seeing it was a birth of his youth; wherein neuerthelesse I will avow that hee hath towred aboue the capacities (at least aboue the imitation) of all those ouer-weening iudgements that dare any way presume to traduce his originall. In iust defence of which worthy worke, I cast defiance in the teeth of all that malice or traduce him, that it is neither any way scurrilous, immodest, light, nor ridiculous: and I will giue the proudest Critique that liues, as many yeares as hee and his fellowes haue bin fooles, either to parallell it, or to pick any the least touch out of it, which cannot bee defended euen till his wittes that shall oppose, be drawne as dry as euer Dutchman left cup. But as touching this present pile of English , it is mine, it hath no further alliace to his, then chalke hath to cheese, for as these haue no cohaerence in their nearest proprieties (which translations should neuer want) but onely in their generall kind of essence as they are both corporeall substances; no more doth this worke any way resemble his in fashion, stile, or discourse, but onely in the inuention and proiect. As for the passages in it, which some pretend to bee scurrilous or immodest, there may perhaps bee some indeed that carry not that pondrous respect in them which an ancient iudgement, or retired grauity may seeme to require: I grant it, what would yee haue more? they are flashes of youth: semel insaniuimus omnes ; And I pray yee (that censure mee so ruthlesly) which of you all is there, but one time or other in the forenoone of your daies, hath had his vagaries in the world, and hath flowne out sometimes as well as I? Oh but, not in print, saies some seuerer Critique ! Alas yet had Ouid his Amores, Seneca his Lusus in Claudium , and others as graue as hee, their exorbitances now and then as vnguirt as others! But that these weakenesses (for so I confesse they are) in mee, should be made as staines to the reputation of another, of one whose learning, life, and workes now extant may serue as purging fires whereat all those that hence haue taken occasion to wrong him thus, might long agoe haue lighted their ignorance were it neuer so immense; that my lightnesses should bee reputed as births of his worthines! Oh that my pen (whereby since I haue ignorantly iniur'd him, I doe thus willingly and freely cleare him) could but make them see what an vniust construction they haue made of an ignorant (and I protest vtterly vnwilling) offence! But since mine owne vnwarinesse gaue first occasion of those vnkinde, and more then foolish callumniations which ignorance draweth from mine error, to staine his goodnesse with; all the satisfaction I can giue him, is to shew my selfe willing to make a faire way againe for his deserts, in the bosomes of such as hence take their occasio of dislike, by proclaiming this truth to all that shall read it, that this present Discouery of the South-Indies is none of his, but had this forme giuen it, without his knowledge, by one who will euer acknowledge his worth & grauity to haue beene vtterly ignorant of any vnfit phrase whatsoeuer included in the whole booke. Hee whom my contrition, and this satisfaction ( COLLATERALLY ) cannot content, is without mercy, and I assure my selfe will dye without merit, if hee bee not quickly shipt away for this new Continent , with letters of commendation to all our friends in Cockscombaya . As for you (gentlemen and frinds) whose iudgements haue giuen gracious acceptance to this our Imaginary world , I will euer endeuor to further your contentments with the best inuentions that the labours of a yong scholler can produce. You, (right Iouiall spirits) and none but you, are they to whom I consecrate these my trauels, since none but you can discerne the sence which they include. Onely in one thing I must intreate your fauorable Censures, and that is, in my allusions here and there vnto the names of some cities of fame and respect, both of our owne, and others: assuring you (as your true examination of the particulars may assure you better) that I had no intent to intimate any collation or reference of the state or maners of those I describe, vnto theirs to which I allude.

In latitude it lieth full sixtie degrees, and in longitude seuenty foure fro Cabo de bona Speranza , and is situate almost directly opposite vnto the Southerne frontiers of Affrica . Such Cosmographers as write hereof, diuide it generally into two Prouinces, Eat- allia (called otherwise in the naturall idiome of the inhabitants Gluttonia ) and Drink-allia , or (in the same language) Quaffonia : the former, situate in the same longitude and latitude (God saue the sample) with our England and the later, with the two Germanies . Both haue one Prince, both one lawe: and a little reformation would make them concurre both in Prince, lawe, habite and manners. which beareth this forme: [ ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif)  ] It is (d) [   (d) And so are most of you Belly gods , the inhabitants thereof.   ] as broad as long, and resembleth the figure of the old Ã† gypt , being full of high skie towring hills, and yet so fertile, that the very Birds (that flock thether from all places to feed) if they stay but one three moneths at the mangery this soile affords them, are so ladened with the luggage of their owne fatned bodies, that they cannot possibly get wing so high as to ouer- toppe one of the meaner mountaines, but become sworne inhabitants of this fatte countrie all their liues after.

This Canton (were it not for a greater instinct of naturall inclination) is in too hotte a climate for any true Eatall to inhabit: for the vttermost corner of it, (which some Geographers name the South cape ,) lieth vnder the same latitude with the most Southerne point of Castile , and is about two and fortie degrees distant from the Ã† quinoctiall . The inhabitants be of a swartie tawnie, and most of them haue their skins all riuelled and withred, and for their conditions, they affect deliciousnesse rather then excesse. Vpon the foresayd point of this Canton which wee named the Swarty cape , (as the whole countrie is wondrously ouer-clowded with smoke, partly because the soile is very Fennish, and partly because of the neerenesse of Terra del fuego , the land of Fire, which lieth as all the discouerers thereof doe with one voyce affirme, immediatly vpon the right hand thereof) standeth the citty Kitchin , the buildings of which towne are generally very lofty, and yet as generally smoakie and euill sented: I imagine that Cochin in the East Indies , was a colony sent at first from this citie. In the midst of this cittie standeth a goodly temple, dedicated to (b)    [  (b) Of him here- after chap. 11. ] God All-Panch , a vaste and spacious building, wherein there are a thousand altars, burning with continuall Incence (excepting from Shrouetide vnto Easter-euen ) vnto the foresaid Deitie. In the midst of this temple is a tower erected, of incredible altitude, no worke made with mans hand euer came neere it, the Pyramides of Memphis are but mole-hils to it: the inhabitants called it Chymney-turret , and from the height thereof the whole region round about it haue the vsuall signall of warre giuen them; for whereas wee vse to giue notice of such ensuing dangers by fyring a tarre-barrell on the toppe of a beacon, they on the contrary side haue their information from the ceasing of the smoake, for when-so-euer that eternall fume ceaseth to ascend in caliginous clouds, it is a sure warning that the foe approacheth: and this inuasion is most comonly attempted by the inhabitants of the Starueling Iles , (otherwise called Hunger-landers ,) for these are the most formidable enemies that the Eat-alls haue, or can be annoied by. Neare vnto the sayd City Kitchin , are certaine villages that are all within the liberties thereof: and first, there is Cole-house , a large towne truely, and all consisting (a strange forme of building) of caues vnder the ground: then is there Ashe-ton , and that stands vpon the toppe of Cole- house , on a most droughty and barren soile. Tonges-worth , another little village and this Ashe-ton , are both in one parish, and so is Fyer-pan and (c)    [  (c) Otherwise called warming-pan. ] Ayre-bumme , two goodly sweet farmes: On the left hand you haue three others, (d)    [  (d) Three villages where spits, kettles and sponnes were first inuented. ] Spit- stead, Kettle-dorp , and Spoones-by , all pretty townes, and maruellous well peopled.

The Citty of Marchpaine is the chiefe towne of note in this Canton , beeing built after a stately manner with turrets, and obeliskes all guilt ouer, but indeede it is but of a slender kinde of fortification, and lieth verie open to the enemies cannon, a little aboue this City are certaine mines, called the Sugar-hills , whence they digge a certain oare in collour whitish, in touch hard,  & in tast sweete, a substance (a)   [  (a) Galen knew it not. ] vnknown of old, & since hauing bin counterfetted by arte, and drawne by Alchymy (b)   [ (b) Plin. lib. 1 chap. 8.   ] out of the Arabian and Indian Reedes. This City hath very few inhabitants of any yeares that haue any teeth left: but all from 18. to the graue are the naturall heires of stinking breaths. Next vnto this, lieth another little corporation called Drugges-burge , and here they haue a law, that none must bee made free of the City but Apothecaries, Grocers and Boxe-makers. The Shee-landresses vse much traffique vnto this place, but more vnto Letcheri- tania , where they vse to make exchange by bartering christaline glasses, for vnguents and Pomanders. Now for these Drugges-burgers , the very heauens seeme to conspire with the places fitnes, to increase their trading: for at certaine times of the yeare, you shall haue the whole countrie couered quite ouer with Aromaticall trochisches, comfits and confections, that fall from the aire in as great aboundance (c)    [  (c) That is alwaies in the Greeke Calends: neuer but then. ] (at those times when they do fal) as euer fel showre of Haile: Now I hold this to be nothing really, but that same hony-dew which we shall finde now and then vpon the leaues of the Oke in a kindly spring: the onely difference is in the solidity, for where as ours falleth in small dewy droppes, theirs is congealed by the cold of the ayres midle region, and so falleth in round balls, that rebound in their fall through this their accidetall induration. spacious plaine, the inhabitants named it Pewter-platteria , and wee for breuity sake, entred it in our mappe vnder the name of Platters-plaine : it lieth in the very heart of Eat-allia , and the first City that we met within this tract was (a)    [   (a) Built in the same fashion that Cambalu is, if you were euer there.   ] Victuallu , through the midst of which there passeth a riuer called (b)    [   (b) From this riuer only the Eat-alls haue all their water wherewith they do dresse their meate.   ] Sauce , whose water is some-what tart in the taste.

And surely (let Seneca say what hee please) it might very well be that this famous Gurmod hauing bestowed a great deale of lost labour in seeking bigger Crabbes on the African shores then the French afforded, turned his course vnto this country, (or els was forced hither by tempest) and so here layd his bones, vpon some deadly surfet. Let the Colledge of Critiques be iudge. I do here purposely omit the fruitfull plaines of Goblet the great, and Fat-land Forrest : togither with the goodly citty (c)    [   (c) Like vnto Cartagena in Spaine , but far better seated.   ] Sausagiena : oh there's a towne rarely seated, onely it stands a little too neere the salt- water: I ouer passe that stinking (d)    [  (d)(e) Two ports where our Hollanders haue much traffique. ] Cheese-mongeria also, and (e)    [ (d)(e) Two ports where our Hollanders haue much traffique. ] Butterkin the fennie, the last towne of all Eat-allia , and situate vpon the very borders of Quaffonia , these I passe ouer slightly, onely because I would faine bee at the metropolitane City of the whole region, for that very place alone, in structure of houses, manners of inhabitants, and formality of discipline, is worth all the rest to one that wayeth it well. so that one may easily discerne that the (a)    [   (a) And reason good the land is called Eat-allia .   ] Cities haue eaten vp all the boroughs. Neither are their Citties so aboundant in nuber as they are in ritches and inhabitants, but of them all, the prime and mother Cittie is that famous Flesh-pasty-nople . Their old records doe report, that in former ages there were two ritch and potent Citties, Fleshton , and Py-nople , betweene whome (as is vsuall amongst great men, and great places, in so much that the (b)    [  (b) Cambridge and Oxford. ] two best vniuersities of the worlde, both of them my mothers, and one of them my nurse also, and both sisters, yet can scarely for-beare this froward contention) there was long and vehement altercation about the soueraignity. Py-nople stood vpon hie antiquitie: and assuredly in old Saturnes time, the world afforded not hir parallell. But Flesh-ton counterpoised the others continuance, with hir owne glorie, pleasant situation and powerfulnesse: well, a Parliament was called, and finally, the whole house with one consent gaue the supremacy vnto Flesh-ton . Such is the vilenesse of this depriued age, that though it bee gray headed with decay, yet wil it prefer proud and vnripe (or rather to soone ripe nouelty) an hundred degrees before pure simple antiquity. (c)    [   (c) This was Py-nople the plaine: but Oysterpynople , and Potatopy-nople are Cities in Letcheritania , that flourish vntill this day: beeing both founded by Hercules , vpon his copulation with 50. women vpon one night.

Now grew Fleshton into more and more lustre, and both to adde a magnificence to the name, as also to past the foile of Py- nople vpon the fore-head of all posterity, it left the last syllable of the old name, and assumed the two last of Py-nople for it, ioyning them, togither with the cement wherof the ancient walls were made (called in their language, Payste ) and so was thence-forth called Flesh-pasti-nople . Touching the forme of it, it is rather vast in compasse then comely in buildings: and hath a ditch (or rather a riueret) of spring water running almost through euery streete, in which water, you shall see a thousand seuerall impayled Fish-ponds, wherein also they keepe Swannes, Duckes, Diue- dappers, Herons, Teales, and all water foules whatsoeuer, (as they do now at Auspurg , vpon instruction from hence) and this current is called (e)    [ (c) If a pasty haue no grauy in it, it is not worth a doite. ] Grauy-ditch . It's double walled about, with the bones that remained of their carniuall reuellings, and these bones were most artificially disposed each in his due place, the great bones standing vnderneath as pillers to the whole worke; the mid-most were next in order aboue them, and the smallest were ranked in the highest place, and all very well fastned togither with morter made of the whites of egges; in good sadnesse, most artificially, and with full iudgement. Their houses with-in, were neither too stately nor too lofty, they needed no (f)  2 Augustus to forbid the building aboue 70 foote high, nor any (g)  3 Iuuenal , or (h)  4 Seneca to complaine of their stories vpon stories. No (faith) they kept a very good course for that. They loue no ascents by staires vp to their dores, for two causes; partly because it is toilesome to climbe vp them when their bellies are bum-basted, and partly because it is dangerous to come downe them when their braines are throughly moistned, (as they must bee most commonly vpon a great forfeiture): Insteed of lead, tile,  & slates, their houses are all rooft with beasts shoulder-bones, very cunningly knit together I assure yea: Their City consisteth not of any saue such as haue one dependance or other vpon the good fellowes rack and manger. The husbandmen, Carpenters, Millers and Butchers haue each their habitations assigned the in the suburbes: who notwithstanding if they can bring their bellies vnto a certaine set size, are presently carried to Gurmonds hall , and there made free of the Wide- throates , or Large-weasands : but no stranger can haue his freedome at first, vnlesse he be either a Cooke a Baker, or an Inkeeper; the city is gouerned by a set number of graue Senators peculiarly enstiled Alder-guts , who are not elected (as our European Burgomaisters are) for their wisdome, their wealth, or their horse-taile beards; but by the circumference of their naturall tankards (their pauches) which at a sollemn set feast are euery yeare measured once: and the more that each mans rotundity of corpulence is found to bee enlarged; vnto the higher place is hee presently aduanced: so that I haue seene some come sneaking out of the fagge end of the suburbes, who had held their (i)    [   (i) A diminutiue of shops you shall find the word in Antony Mundaies discourse of the reformation of Redfaces .   ] Shoppikins in the verges of the Cities Podex, God knowes how many winters, iustle not withstanding at length, into an honorable place in the Citty, and at last come to be a principal Syre of this famous Common-weale. But now you shall heare: If either sicknesse, (as it often falleth out) or age, doe chance to make these Alder-guts cast their Colloppes afterward, they are immediately put on the Bench and loose both greace, and grace at one clap: this is hard now, but it's true as hard as it is I can tel yee that. The Streets (which I admired in a City otherwise so regardlesse of curiosity) are al paued with faire large marble stones: because (as I imagine) otherwise the inequality of pebbles lay the neuer so euen, would haue bin a troble to the Gourmonds & other citizens in making them lift their feete too high, wheras now they are both eased of that encombrance, and their Coaches haue lesse occasion to shake their distended Guts: for they neuer go abroad on foot, nor on hors-back, nor in Litters, but are caried about the streetes in great foure-wheeled Coatches, that they may haue the quieter means to sit and spaule when they are caried home from Wheeleing-in . The Geometricall proportion of the city is Circular, and hath foure gates at which there doe sit daily (course by course) 4 Alderguts selected, and properly instiled of that office Superuisors of the Paunshery : and these are (like the Guales guard in a town of garrison) to examine al: Ingredients , and Egredients : the fatter, to see that they go not out fasting (which their long and graue experience in the extension and contraction of gutts makes them able most exactly to discouer, and where they finde the person defectiue, his Mulct is to eate two suppers) and the first, to see that they come not in emptie- handed: for not to go out fulbellied and not to come in ful-handed, is an heinous contempt of the citties right health-ful gouernment. Euery month, they are bound by their law, (and would bee so, were there no such law) to celebrate a sollemne feast, where euery Aldergut of the whole society must present himself, all excuses and delaies set apart whatsoeuer, to consult (after dinner, for before it is vnlawful for any one to giue his voice) about the publique good. The place where they meet is Gourmonds hall : Euery one knoweth his seate,  & hath his Iourdan or chamber-pot standing by him in a little coffer made for the purpose. Wel, being met,  & hauing turned their wine into water, and their oysters into shells, euery one takes his chaire and to dinner they go. Their daintiest dishes, are euermore the first sacrifices vnto their stomakes, for they hold it fit that the best meat meeteth fittest with the best appetite. Now they may not in any case haue their Boares, Sheepe, Goates, lambs &c. serued vp in parcels & ioynts, as we of Europe vse, but they must haue all whole (the old Romanes taught them that) you shal see the waiters come sweating with an whole Hogge, or an whole Calfe vpon a great pewter Engine, you would blesse yee to behold it. Hee that riseth before six houres bee fully runne, runs his head vnder a rigorous fine and al this while they eate  & drinke, by little and little only (for that cause that made (k)   [   (k) In Ethic his name was Philoxenus .   ] Aristotles Parasite wish himselfe the necke of a crane) to take the more delight in the delicacies. But for the breaking vp of the feast, they haue this order. They haue a dore in their hall, large enough for the greatest Gut- monger that liues, and take him fasting: At this dore, the Alder-guts enter when they come to the feast, which beeing ended, he that offers to passe the same way hee came, and cannot get his belly through, is let-forth another waie: but hee that passeth as easily as he came in is staid by an officer appointed for that purpose, called The Serieant of the Mawe , and brought back againe (will hee nill hee) where hee must settle him to a renewed Rouse , vntill his belly bee able to kisse both the cheekes of the dore at once, and then he is dismissed (I cannot bee fully perswaded but the creeping through (l)    [   (l) Which was whilom to be seene in Beuer castle .   ] Saint Wilfrids needle was a deuise brought by some ancient Pilgrim from this more ancient Alder-guts custome).

Nay marke but whether these men haue a care of the Citties credite. They haue a common hospitall (and that, I may tel you, a large one) wherein al such as haue got the dropsie, the goute, the cough of the lungs, or any such malady by too much gour-mandizing, are maintained of the publike charge, But al such as haue lost their teeth by age, or by eating their broth too hot, are forth with prouided for very conueniently & sent away (n)   [   (n) Iles in the Atlantike sea like our Orades , where they that haue the fewest teeth are held in highest respect, and hee that hath none, is made a Clarissimo of Suppington , the chiefe citty of the whole teritorie.   ] into Spoone-meat Ilands : there are many belonging to this city that liue in forme of slaues, and those are appointed to till the fields, and sow the gardens. Euery ritch Gurmond keepes diuers of these labourers, who notwithstanding when the guts are at sufficient growth, haue their freedome giuen them gratis . If any of the nobility chance to die of a surfet (as there doth assuredly, more, then of any other death) his Statue is presently forged of most select  & delicate dishes, and so he is laid forth for his slaues and (o)   [  (o) His hang bits. ] his pendentes per , to tire vpon: nor is it lawfull for them to bee so idle as to refuse immeditate execution of this honorable ordinance. The whole sort of al these citizens are generally of an vnmeasurable grosenesse (and seemed to mee when I sawe them walke iust like so many tunnes, mouing each vpon two pottle pots): nor is that man worthy of any (the meanest) salutation in the world, that is not (p) [   (p) Like him whose Epitaph this was: Here lyes sir Iohn of Red-crosse streets: he was beard toth' belly, and belly toth' fooie .   ] all cheekes to the belly, and all belly to the knees: and such shapes doe the women of this cittie walke in also: (The Germaine Frowes doe prittily well in imitation of these Fusty-lugs , but the Barbarians come very neere them). The yong women may not mary till such time as before a bench of Matrons, they make a publicke demonstration to their husbands that shall bee, that their dugges and chinnes may meete without any forcing of either. They go for the most part all naked, onely their Alder-guts may weare gownes; mary those must be onely the skinnes of such beasts as they are able to deuoure alone at one sitting. Yet there is no free-man of the towne but weares a large knife, and a spoone as big as a ladle bound to his right arme. Before, vpon the breasts, each one weareth a poke of hayre-cloth to saue the gobbets that chance to fall besides, and to wipe their mouths with all, but those they vse so long in this greasie imployment, that whether their shining exceed their blacknesse, or their blacknesse their shining; he had need be well sighted that should iudge. They are naturally dull of wit, and slow of apprehension, and yet notwithstanding most perfect in all the arts they respect.

But the noble Swine, oh they prize that beast aboue all that euer nature produced: but whether it be because of their sympathy of natures, being both fatally consecrated to the table, or by reason that the swine will feede on the coursest meate and yet be soonest fedde, this I leaue to a more iudicious Censor to determine. What man is he now would thinke, that in this inundation of profusenesse their should be any dry hillock left for Parsimony to inhabit? yet (sooth) there is many haue an vnfit dwelling among such Gulp-thrifts : Certainly I haue obserued an exceeding care they haue in the reseruing of the smallest bit-bone, and fragment that remaines after their banquetings; wherevpon they neither keepe dogge, catte, hawke, nor any creature whatsoeuer that will eate flesh: Nay which is more, in the fatting of their Pidgeons, and Capons, they will take them and make them vn-gorge the corne that they haue already halfe disgested, and giue it for meate vnto the others. The Venetians haue learnt this pretty trick of them already, and (t)    [  (t) So can our Poulters here in London, yea and worse, as some report, the deuill con them thanke for it. ] can doe it very neatly. Now as for the men themselues, if any one keepe any victuals by him vntill they stinke, hee is forth-with condemned of high treason, and spitted vpon a stake. Onely two reseruations this lawe agreeeth vnto, the first is, they may keepe their Venison vntill it bee all hoarie, and mouldie quite ouer, and the second is, they may lay vp (foh, nasty!) their cheese where they thinke good, so long, vntill it be ready to creepe quite away with Maggots, and then they take these wormes (the very putrifaction of a most putride meate) and scraping a little sugar on them, crash them vppe with spoones as if they were Almond-comfites. Out vpon them; I wonder our Low Dutch would be such logger-heads as to follow them in this filthy fashion. This region aboundeth with riuers whose course is (most of them) vncertaine, because of the aboundance of ordure that stops them, some-times heere, and sometimes there, but generally (take this for an infallible rule) (u)   [ (u) At Christmas and at Shrouetide all the lakes-farmers termes. ] at the beginning of Ianuary, and the ending, or about the ending of February, they are sure all of them to ouer-flow the bankes, and (if the breatches bee not stopt in time) to do much harme in the pastures adioyning.

The Thriuingers also, the ancient inhabitants of this land, haue made many attempts to regaine their lost possession, but (as fortune lightly leaneth to the wrong side) haue beene continually beaten backe by the Eat-allians good successe.

It hath a large territorie vnder command,  & is situate in ye farthest confines of Pewter-Platteria , towards Fooliana . There is not a towne either of more antiquity, or worthy more admiration in all Eat-allia then this is: The Citizens liue in farre more happy estate then euer Monke did: for they haue all things they can desire, in aboundance. For first the towne is so strongly situate, that it is vtterly impregnable, and may iustly mock at all the enemies enterprises, being built vpon a rock (b)    [   (b) 'Tis no lesse, beleeue it: if you will not, go and see your selfe, and trust your owne eyes.

There is but one way vp to the towne, and that is not by mounting the rock by degrees, and windings, as wee see in other forts of this situation, but the townes-men let downe a roape and a basket, like the bucket of a Well, and so hale vp the passengers. They liue all vpon certaine birds naturally bred amongst them, I neuer saw any of them else-where, the inhabitants call them (c)    [   (c) We haue store of them here in England ,  & most of your beds in court are stuffed with their fethers.

They serue the cities vse with three sorts of meates, flesh, egges, and fish; flesh, from their owne carcasses, egges from their nests, where they lay them in great aboundance, and fish which they bring for the feeding of their young ones, in huge excesse: and besides, the sticks of their nests finde the citizens perpetuall firing. What, would yee more? and more yee shall haue. Their fethers serue the citizens for stopping of their beds, yea and some to spare also, for transportation. The grounds within the walls bring forth both whole vintages of delicate grapes, and whole haruests of the purest wheate. Nor is there any other thing whatsoeuer that the Idle-berghers esteeme, but they enioy it within themselues. The people do liue an vncurious life, and in Apuleius his sence (who called a fatte Lambe, an vncurious one) selues are truly vncurious.

That none eate alone, nor violate the lawes of the table by any priuate suppers: but that euery Citizen do eate either in the streetes or in an open window, vpon paine of eating his next meale with his heeles vpward. 4\. That whosoeuer forbeareth to sleepe or eate foure houres together, do satisfie the state by eating two suppers. 5\. Yet if the mouth bee full, it shall bee sufficient to giue an answer by holding vp the finger. 6\.

They haue a good deuotion vnto God Trine , because he eateth vp althings before him, and shewes himselfe herein a true Eat-all . They haue built a goodly temple vnto him, in which I saw the picture of Saturne eating vp his children, passing artificially portrayed. On Shroue-tuesday , they offer sacrifice vnto the Genius of the place, whom they hold for their chiefe Deitie, and almost for their onely deity: Euery yeare once doth this power appeare vnto them in forme of a monstrous Fowle, most huge and most rauenous, (the inhabitants call him RVC) and accepts the offrings of his seruants, and they for their parts are not behinde hand with him, but present him with whole Hecatombes of raw- flesh, thus ordered. In Pewter-platter-ia (of which you heard before) there is a large plaine, lying towards the South, circled in with mountaines on each side. Vnto this plain do al the inhabitats flock at a certain day appointed, bringing with them an ocean of victuals, Elephants, Rhinocerots, Camells (all which they feed for this purpose, for other-wise they would neuer keepe such vnprofitable creatures) Oxen of the largest size, Boares, Sheepe, Goates, togither with a whole army of Birds, all with the feathers pluckt off: all these they put as it were into this large cage; which being done, they get them vp on the mountaines sides, as if they tooke their seates in a play-house, and with bended knees doe there expect the comming of this great Deity, old Ruc of Rucs hall. At length sir, you shall see him come a farre off, with a noise, able to deafe the whole nation three hundred miles about, with a great crooked bill as bigge (a)    [  (a) Almost, not fully so big: it wants some 359. degrees, 59. min. 60. seconds. ] (almost) as halfe the Equinoctiall circle, with a paire of tallants, like two broade spred Okes, with two eyes in his head like two townes that were on fire, and such an inundation of Harpies, Rauens, Vultures, and Haukes, about him,! O strange! stupendious sight, for man to see! with a cry, able to procure an earth-quake they approach the plaine, and by and by, their wings eclipse the Sunne, and bring a midnight ouer the whole valley, they are so huge a multitude. Three times they flagge abont the plaine, while the people powre out their very bladders in teares, and all that is in their bellies in hearty praiers vnto this route of religious birdes. By this time, Generall R V C, the leader of this starued regiment hath spied his pray, for hee out of all that Folio Catalogue of Carcasses, must choose what pleases his tooth first, supose hee take some fiue Elephants, or halfe a score oxen, he is to be first serued, and then euery one to his sharke, tagge and ragge: there yee should see one fly away with a Calfe here another with a Lambe, there one with a Boare and here another with a Swanne, euery one fitting his luggage to his strength, and thus with a reuerent and religious applause of all the lookers on, (b)    [   (b) Into the forrests of Theuegen , whereof read the 4, books. chap. 4.   ] they depart euery one with his cariage, and leaues the rest behind them: all which (and that is an huge deale of meate) the people are bound in conscience to get ready and eate vp ere they goe, whereby their bellies are so ouer-stuffed, that they loath flesh almost forty daies after, during which space they liue all vpon fish (but that is costly drest with sirrups and sauces) and with the dainties of Banquet-ois : both to refresh themselues with the delicacy thereof, as also to returne to flesh againe which the sharper appetite, hauing thus long forborne it. Sure as death the Pope had his Lent sent him out of this country, vpon the granting them some odde indulgence, or vpon dispensing with them for Ember weekes. the very same day that a new Duke was elected, according to the custome of the country. There is a Stately Palace standeth vpon a narrow ledge of land lying iust betweene Eat-allia and Drink-allia , which also ioyneth them both together: This pallace was built (as their most ancient Chroniclers auouch) by a Giant called (in the sayd Chronicles) All-Paunch : who was of an incredible height of body; not like him whose picture the Schollers of Cambridge goe to see at Hogmagog hills: but rather like him that ought the two aple-teeth which were digged out of a Well in Cambridge that were little lesse then a mans head, (yet was not the tooth that was found on the shore of Vtina any way comparable to these) Plinyes (a)    [  (a) Who was 7. cubites high. Plin lib. 7. chap. 16. ] Orestes , or (b)    [  (b) Who was 16. cubites in height. ] Plutarches Orion were but dwarfes in respect of this same great All-Paunch . Suppose rather that you saw Ant aeus that was three-score cubites heigh, or him whose carcasse beeing digged vp at Drepano , was, (as Boccace affirmeth the Symetrians to haue gathered by his thigh bone) two hundred cubites in length, this later I thinke might bee brother to him wee speake off. This All-Paunch was the first that conquered this countrie from the Thriuingois , draue them all out of the land, brought in a new people, and gaue them new lawes: and his soule they imagine (as Pythagoras his opinion affirmed) to bee entred into that huge bird RVC, in which shape (as I said) they do yearly adore him. The silly people haue this fellow in as great reuerence as the Turkes haue Mahomet . Hee lyeth buried in the midst of the Palaces Base Court: Where for a sacred memorial of him, there is a Statue erected, farre higher then Lisippus his brazen colossus, neare vnto which his tombe is, vpon which I discerned some markes of letters, but antiquity had so eaten them out, as Ouid saith.  Old time that razeth all and spareth none, And age that eateth through the hardest stone had so defaced the inscription, that I could scarcely make any good sence of it. The fragments stood in this manner. Now I imagine it should conteine these words; Iudge I pray the Gentle reader, and if thou canst restore the fragments to their true contents better then I haue done here, thou maist doe the Antiquaries much pleasure herein: I thinke it is thus. I ALL-PAVNCH, DVKE OF TENTER-BELLYE, LY HERE ENTOMBED. DYING A LORD, A VICTOR, A PRINCE, A DEITY. LET NONE GO BY ME FASTING, NOR NAME ME HVNGRY, NOR SALVTE MEE SOBER.

This tombe is to bee seene in the pallace of the Duke, who hath his regalitie according to this first Dukes institution, not by succession, but by election, for there are foure chiefe linages, or families in the land: The Treble-chins , the Bacon-choppes , the Wool-sacks , and the Nimble-iawes : any one of these foure houses may stand for the Dukedome, and vpon desert obtaine it. This now is the order of the election: there is a yearely tilting ordained (not any tilting with speares, but a tilting of barrells) whervnto euery one comes armed with his teeth, all new sharpened, and to it they goe, where hee that vnhorseth most meate, and lifteth most measures of wine out of their pewter-saddles, is not onely honoured with a crowne of clustered vines, but furthermore is made Lord high Steward of the Land , the Dukes next inferior: which done, and the tournament ended, each one ariseth (if hee can) and laying his hand on the sacred tombe of dead Duke All-Paunche , taketh an othe by the deities of Bacchus, Saturne , and the reuerend All-Paunch to performe his duety in this election without any partiall dealing whatsoeuer. Then they depart vnto the Theater which is prepared for that daies vse (not too high for feare of beeing tired ere they got vp staires) and there they take their places to behold this future election. Then first commeth forth the new chosen Lord high Steward, and he bringeth in his hand a golden girdle, all enchased with Pearles, Diamonds, Rubies &c. and this they call The holie belt of State : and vpon it, I espied these words, set in perfect Rubies; NOTHING, IF NOT BEYOND. Now first, the last yeares Duke puts it on, and taketh the exact measure of his owne Souse-tub, and then al the rest of the Nobility doe so after him, and hee that can set it on the tenters (without stretching of his bellie, or holding of his breath) so stiffe, that it neede bee letten out one hole more; Hee is the man that with great acclamations is proclamed High Duke of Tenter-belly . And then presently commeth his Cup-bearer, and vpon his knees presents him with a siluer tankard of some dozen quartes, and intreates his Grace to drinke a health vnto the people. Hee takes it, and lifting vppe the Lidde, beginnes an oration to the people befitting occasion, or if hee bee no good oratour, yet hee giues them as kinde a congratulation as hee can. Truely I was verie attentiue to it (b)   [  (b) Yet know that the fattest Geese haue the smallest wind-pipes. ] but they doe all speake so in the throate, that I could neither like the sound nor learne the sence, vntill mine interpretour told mee how it was: and thus it was indeede. After hee had yeelded thankes (quoth hee) to Bacchus , (c)    [  (c) The Goddesse of all shambles and flesh-markets whatsoeuer. ] Carnea , and all those fauourable deities, especiallie to his owne Great Mawe , the giuer of such high honours, and had giuen gramercie to his eyes, that had be held him the best man in all Tenter-bellie (d)    [  (d) The honester they, to stick so truely to him. ] erre they fell out, hee turned his speach vnto the people, and in most excellent and Rhetoricall good tearmes, tooke a fresh oathe by Saint All-Paunche ,    [ The Dukes Oration to the people after his election. ] that hee would be a Bulwarke to our liberties, a drudge to our businesses, a terrour to our enemies, a childe to our aduises, a follower of our counsells, a preseruer of our studies, a father to our desires, an enlarger of our Weasands, and an increaser of our measures: finally, he would preserue vs as wee were now, and make vs as wee would bee. And then hee denounced himselfe a professed foe to Hunger, Abstinence, Diet, Naughty Ale and Meagernesse of wine, beere , and bodie , and swore once more (to assure vs) that while hee bare that roiall belt, none should either fast vnpunished, or bee drunke vnrewarded. Goe on my good subiects (quoth he) I adiure you by the sacred weight of your well distended wombes, goe on, bee yee all and alwaies free and frolicke! O the royalty of reuells! O honorable helter skelters! Let neuer this goodlie formed Goblet of wine (quoth hee, and tooke vppe his pot of twelue quartes) goe Iouiallie through mee, (and then hee set it to his mouth, stole it off euery droppe saue a little remainder which hee was by custome to set vpon his thumbes naile and licke it off, as hee did, and then proceeded) vnlesse I doe from the bottome of mine heart, will and wishe you continuallie dronken heads, full bellies, and fatte fortunes. Then hauing made an end, the audience made all ring with their applause, they gaue it him so fully and so faithfully: Longe liue Bounsingut, Wool-sack, C aesar, Emperor of Tenter-belly, long liue he, long reigne hee, long grow hee ; this they rattled yee vppe, at least a dozen times ouer. Then were the armes of the Dukedome giuen him, which was the Rampant Estridge , swallowing of an Iron horshooe: the word Digest, and Do best . For his sword and scepter, the Lord High-Steward presented him with a great knife, and a pretty golden Tunne, and in deliuering them (according to custome) pronounced these words, Vse and enioye them . But then for the Coronation dinner and supper! Oh mercifull Heauens! what Castles of platters and chargers, what mountaines of flesh and banquetry, what deluges of Wine Ale and Vsquebath did I see there! I will neuer stand vpon perticulars: onely this I cannot ommit, the streetes that night were strowed so thicke with drunken carcasses that I thinke in conscience there was neuer more memories left in the field, of the greatest massacre that euer this moderne age was witnesse of. There are diuers Cities besides in this dominion, as Swallow-all, Hogges-den, Tickle-Chere , and (e)    [   (e) Lickingoa is a colony, sent from Goa in in the East-Indies, saith Pantagruel in his Merda Geographica . lib. 7 chap. 39.

It lieth vnder three and thirty degrees of longitude, and foure and fifty of latitude, beeing on the North, directly opposite vnto Cabo Bianco , and on the South, vnto Filtching-Fennes . It is a stonie, swartie, barren, Grass- lesse, sandie soyle: there are some trees in it, but they haue neuer an inch of barke left, nor blossome, nor budde: nay the plentie of all places, the weede, cannot finde in his heart to make any (the smallest) residence in these quarters. The Lands naturall barrennesse affordes no distinction either of Summer or Winter, whether it bee because the inhabitants snappe vppe there herbes as soone as euer they peepe out of the Ground, or that it bee the effect of Ceres curse, (who sayling about the world to seeke her Daughter, made ship-wracke on the craggie shore of this Ile, and therevpon, they say, layde her malediction vpon it) it lies not in mee to resolue you. There is none that dwells in this soile willinglie, but all the inhabitants are Exiles: and their hew is naturallie betweene a pale and a swartie, their skinnes crumpled like halfe burnt partchment, and puckered like the hide of an Elephant: The Sunne did neuer see more meager creatures, you would sweare they were Anatomies couered with fresh skinne, or els one of Athenodorus his apparitions, they looke so ghastly. You shall haue one laying a plotte how to intrappe the flies: another, contriuing a conspiracie against the wormes; nay there bee they that sitte shauing of the Earthes (GOD knowes already neere shorne) beard, to discouer the rootes of the vngrowne grasse: nay they will lye in ambushes one for another (like so many (a)    [   (a) Otherwise (although vnproperly) called Cannibals .   ] Bald-Cannyes in a dead vacation of butcherie) yet notwithstanding they haue a good excuse for this out of Aristotle , for you know that the greater number of strangers arriuing, the greater scarcity of Belly-timber must needs ensue. By this meanes no stranger escapes them vnlesse he bee either too strong for their assaults, or too leane for their stomacks. They are (most of them) Blacksmiths, notwithstanding that the Eate-alls banish all their Philosophers and Phisitians hither, and so doe the Spaniards all their slaues that haue serued out their time.

Not any else could I espie, Indeed I durst not make any long aboade in so leane a land, it was no wisdome, was it thinke yee? Thus farre of Eat-allia , and the adiacent Iles; now come we to Drink-allia , and so good night. The Conditions of the Inhabitants. I durst not for mine eares offer to go into any Cittie of the whole Prouince, vntill it was darke night, that all the citizens were wrapt in wine and warme clothes, and then (you know) how was it possible to discouer any thing? you may perhaps say, what should you feare? faith Ile tell yee: harke in your eare! I feared the Burgomaisters bountie: for their fashion is, as soone as any one settes foote in at the Cittie gate, to giue him, by my troth I wotte neere how many lifts of Wine for his welcome; oh they receiue him in pompe; and all of the common purse of the Cittie: now so many stoopes must hee pull of, or else hee is held an vngratefull, vnmannerly fellow, and which is worse, a direct foe to the common good of the Cittie. Now I feared both this honour and this danger, and now I hope you are answered. To our purpose. This Prouince is some-what larger then Eat-allia , and what that hath in wealth, this hath in intemperancie. It is as broad or rather broader then both the Germanies : nor is there any nation vnder the cope of heauen so fortunate, nor so aboundant in the delicate iuice of the grape, as this is. The peculiar wines of all our kingdomes of Europe , the Germaines Rhenish, the Frenchmans White and Claret, the Spaniards Xeres, Malaga, and the Canaries, tush, they haue them all here in excesse. The temperature of their bodies are somewhat different from the Eat- alls , for these delight in the qualities of heate and drought, whereas the Drink-alls especially affect heate and moisture: so that the bordering neighbours doe ieastingly call the Eat-alls, Blackmen , and Kitchin-Tenter- bellyes , but the Drink-alls they name Read-men , and Cellerian-Tenter- bellyes . But their bodies and their wittes hold both one key in difference: for the Drink-alls as they are more ingenious then the Eat-alls , so are they much more lasciuious: In their young yeares they are generally very quick witted, but being come to a more grauer age (especally old age) they grow so forgetfull, that you shall not haue one amongst twenty that can remember his owne name. Counties: the countie of Wine-cester , the county of Vsque-bathe , and the countie of Hoppe-Sack , or Strong-biera . The first of these, Wine-shire , is parted from Eat-allia , vpon the westerne verge thereof by the riuer Piss-on , a salt current that ebbes and flowes. This riuer runnes round about the Dukes Palace, and as for the saltnesse, the Philosophers of this countrie say it hath it not from the sea, but from an ayrie humor that often-times falls vpon it. The first towne that I came vnto in this region, was called Vine-spring , and was in forme of a fiue-angled trencher: it lay downe as farre as Vine-prophils , and so some of it became part of the suburbes of Clusterbeg , a pretty fine Cittie, walled about with stones of the colour of bricke, but some-what deeper of dye. This Cittie stands in the bottome of Pressing-dale , (a valley so called) through the which runnes a delicate riuer called Iuice , which passeth along by three or foure pretty citties, (seated vpon the bankes thereof, most iudiciously, and to the founders eternall commendations) their names as I remember were Tankards-bridge , that was the first, then Tunning-trie , then Broachingford ,  & lastly, Carousi-kanikin. Tunning-try I remember was fotified with a wall of wood, and Broaching-ford had neuer but one gate open at once, and that when it was shut, was made fast with nothing but the end of a faggot-stick. There is not in all the world any one riuer comparable to this that runs through these cities; Donaw, Thames, Volga, Seyne , or Sir Walter Rawleys riuer of Guiana , put them all in, they are but kennells to this: for besides the pleasing Meanders that hee makes in his wanton course, the water is so sweete and delicate, that neither the best Europes wine, nor the Turkes delicious (a)    [  (a) A drinke made of honey and water. ] Zerbeth can possibly goe beyond it. This worthy sonne of the Ocean , hath one peculiar fish belongeth vnto it, called a Tappe , and this fish will some-times lye by the shore, and spoute a huge deale of the water aloft, (mary the remaining of it in his belly hath made it some-what more pleasing to the taste then it was before) and this the inhabitants watch for in boates, and when they get it, make great store of it. This riuer (as I told you) passeth through Tuning-try : masse I had fotgotten one towne, it goeth from thence to Celleridge , ere it come to Broaching-ford , and so by Broaching-ford passeth directly vnto Carousi-kannikin , the prime Cittie of the whole Prouince. also of the fashions and conditions of the Drink-alls . haue a little light of it from the Germaine tongue, but as for the citie, it is built vpon an hill, and carieth the forme of a Tankard, from what quarter soeuer you behold it. It is of ancient renowne, and one of the best seated ports for traffique in all the whole land. On the East part it is strongly fortified with Barricadoes, and Bulwarkes built all of Barrels, and the roofes of the houses are most of one and the same manner, tiled with the boords of broken Caskes. In the entrance of the gate, from morning vntill night there is placed a double canon of Pewter, (for their lawe commandeth this to bee duly obserued) the citizens call it the Flaggon of Hospitalitie , and round about it, are these words engrauen, (a)    [   (a) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) á¼„ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  such an inscription is vpon the Dolphin in Cambridge.   ] Aut bibe, aut abi : Drinke or bee gone . Hee that ariueth, must either lift it all of, or else he is caried before the Magistrate, to render accompt of his contumacie. The armes of the Citie are aduanced ouer the Gate, and they are the three horse-leaches vpon three naked feete, in a bloudy field; the word, Pl aenae, quiescimus . Being full, we rest . Here by a fortunate chance, did I meete with another stranger, a Letcheri-tanian borne, who was bound for the Citie as well as I, his name he told me was (b)    [  (b) An Italian word expressing the noise that the wine maketh in running from the tap. ] Cinciglion . He (being acquainted with their fashions) brought mee secretly by night into the towne, and shewed mee such things as I should neuer haue discouered of my selfe. Their buildings are not much vnlike the Eat-alls , but that the fronts of their houses are so wholy hidde with spreading Vines, that had I not seene the signes hang out on euery side, I would haue sworne I had beene in a Vineyard and not in a Cittie: in sadnesse it was a pleasant spectacle. In the Market place are all the measures hung vp in chaines, sealed with the Dukes stampe on their tops, and by them, hangeth a table of the lawes of the land, which you shall haue truely set downe hereafter. The inhabitants go all naked, but for a wreath of Vines about their foreheads. But their skins are all carued with figures, and painted after the maner of the ancient Picts , and Brittons . One hath himselfe drawne into the forme of a Centaure , another of a (c)    [  (c) A beast that is halfe like a Goate, and halfe like a Stag. ] Tragelaphus , a third of a Pidgeon (a terrible drinking byrd) and you shall haue some painted so perfectly like a flaggon, that if hee set but his hands on his sides you would sweare it were a liuing flaggon. I did see one also so directly in the shape of a Whale, that when hee vomited, no man in the world but would haue taken him for a liue Whale, spewing vp the Ocean . I had a great affection to see the maner of their publike feasts, and yet not bee seene by the citizens. So mine hoste at last agreed to performe my request, and satisfy my longing, mary hee gaue mee, withall, certaine cautions of danger, that might ensue if I were discouered, and likewise informed me in some necessary points of behauiour: so hauing mine instructions about me; I and mine honest hoste, my leader, got vs into the Townes hall, in the euening, vnspyed of any. By and by come the feasters, and take their places, iust as the Eat-alls doe (as you haue heard) onely they had more drinke and lesse meate. Euery one had his purueyance at either elbowe, a pisse-pott for his vrine on one side, and a bowle for his vomite on the other. At first, they begin a sacrifice to Bacchus , their Generall God : not as the Romanes did of old, with powring a little wine vpon the ground; no, no, farre more religiously, and with more stately ceremonies. At the vpper end of the table stands a statue of Bacchus , holding in his right hand a monstrous great Goblett of such weight, that (as Virgill sayde once) the left hand is now and then faine to helpe her sister. Into this Goblet or standing Cup, the maister of the ceremonies in the name of the whole company, powres an hoggs-head of wine, (it holds no lesse I can assure yee) which passing in pipes as if it were in veines vnto his mouth, and his t'other thing both at once, makes a pretty shew as hee both pissed wine and spewed it, all in one moment. And this is the houre-glasse proportioning the continuance of the feast, for when he leaueth powring out, they must all leaue powring in, and that vpon paine of sacriledge. Then sir comes me vp a seruice of shooing- hornes (do yee see) of all sorts, salt-cakes, red-herrings, Anchoues,  & Gammons of Bacon ( Westphalia may goe pipe in an Iuie leafe, if it seeke to equall these) and aboundance of such pullers on. (d)    [   (d) Here is no vse of the old Romane caution, vsed in their meetings, Drinke three potts, or fiue, but neuer foure .   ] 8 And then begins the full potts to goe round about the table, and the empty against the walles, so that you cannot possibly tel whether they are sooner filled to be emptied, or emptied to be filled; but (as Plautus saith of one) the drinke is sure to go, be it out of Can, (e)    [   (e) A Quoniam is a glasse as well knowne in Drink-allia as Chaucers old Queynt is in Letcheri-tania . ] Quoniam , or Iourdan. Now when one of them will drinke to another, he first challengeth him with a solemne (f)    [  (f) The reliques of some tauerne catch. ] ceremoniall song. and then they ioyne hands fast together, and giuing a sound shake or two, the challenger aduanceth his moistened weapon, and blowes it drye: hee may puffe a little, or talke a few gentle words among hands, but the pott is disrobed of his liquor, ere it bee seuered from his gripe: and then the tother answereth him at his owne weapon. The second course is not very dainty, but howsoeuer, they moysten it well with redoubled rouses. Then comes the fruite with the third course, and that in truth is very rarely furnished, which being almost finished, and the cloth being now thrust vpon an heape, the maister of the ceremonies cryeth Healths , three times with a lowd voyce. I imagined that this had beene a summons to the breaking vp of the companie and was a going hence; when mine hoast pulled mee by the sleeue, why how now yee sleepie spectator (quoth hee) and the feast is scarcely begun? stay and see the conclusion of it I pray yee: doe yee not see how fast God Bacchus his houre-glasse runnes? So I satte downe againe and stayed. Then steps mee out one of the company, and taking of his wreath, downe vpon his knees he goes, (I thought hee had beene going to his prayers) and presently calls for a quart pott. An health (quoth hee) vnto Great Bousing-gut, Woolsack, Arch-duke of Tenbelly , and presently the potte stops his mouth: he drinkes, he puffes, he belches, hee talkes, vntill within a while hee had gulpd downe as many quartes as his name had letters and when he had done, hee falls a spewing, till all cryed twang againe, and dyes (as Horace said) [   Maro tingit pauimentum superbo .   ] The pauement where he stood, With proud Lyaean bloud. Well, they all follow in order from the highest to the lowest, each one with the same pott, execution, & eiection: proouing him-selfe hereby a faithfull citizen, and (which is more) a strenuous Empty-can . This past, vpstarts another, with this catch, A health to you and vs, this day, and health to all Drink- allia, seasoning his song with many a goodly belche, and so downe vpon his mary-bones,  & vp with the pott hand-smooth, the deuill a bone finds hee in the drinke. After him they must all follow, wo be to him that hangs an arse. This showre ouer-blowen, out steps a third, and hee aduanceth a quarte of plumpe Ly aeus to the health of all the Quagmirists (which is the generall name of the Nobility) of the most famous and eternall Citie of Carousi- kanikin ; briefly, after him they goe, and thus euery man in order brings in his foundation of a new Round. Now euery man hauing his share, they must each one in his order (poxe on't, that madded mee) goe play the (g)    [   (g) Of one of these might Horace haue truly said, Aut insanit homo, aut versus facit , the man is mad, or else he maketh verses   ] Poet, out of the inspiration of Bacchus onely (the Muses may go hang for any roome they haue here)  & herein according to the old maner that Plutarch speaketh of, euery one sings his song,  & insteed of his Harpe, he had a knife and a quart pot, and truly they plaid fine musick on it. One, in his song commended his mistresse, another, the goodnesse of the wine, a third related all the passages betwixt him and his wife at home, so that it made mee remember that old saying of Laberius:  Ebriulati mentem hilarem accipiunt. When wines effect the braine doth binde, Then mirth doth caper in the minde. An other rimed all in Satyre against one that was not at this drinking: and euery one (mee thought) kept (h)   [   (h) He was a drunken Poet and dyed of a surfet.

But in the meane time, while these songs were a singing, it was a world to see their seuerall behauiours, euery man had his humor to himselfe: you should see one, for very pure loue, weeping in his fellowes bosome, and another sitte a kissing of his companion, one setting his mouth on the racke with laughter (wise were the man that could tell at what,) another downe vpon all foure in deuotion to Bacchus , a third swaggering  & swearing godts hundred thousand tufels , because the bowle of wine was brought him no sooner; a fourth arguing of religion and matter of state:  & here in a corner you should haue a fift sit nodding and slauering, it would doe a blind-mans heart good to see him. But now at the beginning of the feast, because they are generally so slippery of memory that they quickly forget what they haue to doe, they haue a publike Notary, whom they call (i)   [   (i) The wind-pipe office there, is farre greater then the Pipe office here in England .   ] Clarke of the wind-pipe , and he registers euery perticular carouse, and so files them vp for common records: what each man hath drunke, and vnto whom; which done after supper hee readeth them to the company (if any man be awake to heare them) Pottle-gulp . vnto Swolne-gut .---iii.

If any one haue failed in the taking of his liquour, hee must forth-with make present satisfaction, (if hee bee able) otherwise, at the next meeting hee is sure to pay sound interest for his forbearance. Well the roll being read, and the houre-glasse runne all out: Mary quoth I to mine host but how will they get home now? that maruell I at most. Oh well inough sir (quoth hee) feare ye not. Do yee not see those ropes there in the court, that are fastned vnto them Iron rings? These, their seruants (who may not touch a droppe of wine till the feast bee done) beeing so sober as to know euery one his owne rope, doe take hold of, and the other end of it beeing fastned to their maisters dore, so draw themselues and their Maisters both in one cart, directly home, for these ropes are as good vnto them as a thred in a labyrinth. Masse you say true (quoth I) but what if one should come in the meane-time and tie the ropes further end to a wrong dore? Why doe you thinke (quoth hee smiling) that any one wakes this night? Yet I haue known it done,  & the cart go to a wrong house and the man to another mans wife; who perhaps beeing as drunke as hee, neuer discouers the matter vntill next day at noone; and then, that which they ignorantly committed, they doe wittingly laugh at: for it is a principle here, that a drunken man can neuer offend , for it is the effects of Bacchus , that hee is but instrument vnto, and nothing else. But I remembred that place of Lucian Bacchus neuer biddes them drinke more then they neede .    [  In Dialog. ] that ancient embleme of the order of their Knights, the Golden Tunne ; Hee that can drinke this vessell thrice off and goe his waies without indenting, for this good seruice is presently knighted by the great Duke himselfe,  & hath a chaine of extraordinary value bestowed vpon him besides. These knights haue a large Charter, and are allowed many goodly priuiledges; they haue absolute commaund in al Tauernes, & at al Tables. They may furnish so many soldiours in pewter- coates out of any mans celler in the towne, Gratis ; and besides they haue full authority to set what limmets they please vnto euery mans pot-licking. These hardy men haue great conflicts at euery sollemne meeting (as the (a) in Rome) their weapons are full charged cuppes, and hee that carrieth most of them away cleere, is conquerour, and leads the rest about the towne (if they can goe) in triumph. And this is their triall of the victory. If hee can put his finger iust into the flame of the candle without playing hit-I-misse I, let him spew whole fish-ponds, hee is held a sober man. Now gentle Reader will I present thee with the lawes both of Carousi-kanikin , and of all Drink-allia : read and if thou wilt not laugh, choose. Tenter-belly, and the whole States both of Eat -allia and Drink- allia . 1.  That all promises, othes, bills, bonds, indentures or any other conueyances whatsoeuer, made, or caused to bee made in the after-noone, bee vtterly voide and of none effect. 2\. That no man of what state or degree soeuer hee bee, haue his cuppes priuate vnto himselfe, vpon paine of drinking two daies, after in a fire- shouell? 3\. That if any one cast away any snuff, but meere froath, he be forthwith enioyned to goe downe vpon his knes and lick vp the otherwise perrishing liquor. 4\. That euery one pledge his challenger in the same cup, and on the same fashion, vpon paine of beeing debarred from drinke two daies after. 5\. That the Pottes in banquets bee either alwaies full, or empty: the waiter that presents a pot halfe filled, and the person that takes it shalbe both guiltie of breach of good fellowship. 6\. That hee that beeing sober shall strike him that is drunk, be immediate disabled for euer giuing testimony in any cause whatsoeuer: but the drunken man striking the sober shalbe acquitted. 7\. That he that being sober shall robbe him that is drunke, bee forbidden wine for euer: and if he kill him, he shalbe put to death by thirst. 8\. That hee that shall speake euill of the Duke of Tenter-belly , as in saying, God send him a dry health, or so, bee held guilty of high treason. 9\. That hee whome either nature or sicknesse hath made abstinent; bee banished the land. 10\. That hee that goeth from any publique meeting, without staggering, bee accompted a malefactor in the highest degree. 11\. That all that stay three daies in the Cittie, doe offer sacrifice vnto Bacchus . 12\. That the calling of a Citizen theefe or whore-maister, beare no action, that to call him abstayner, shalbe lyable to the lawe. 13\. That hee that mixeth water with his wine, bee sent to suppe amongst the dogs. 14\. That hee that sweareth by Bacchus , and keepeth not his word, bee vtterly disabled from making any will, and bearing any witnesse. 15\. That hee that striketh with a pot, and either spilleth the wine, or breaketh the pot, bee enioyned to touch neither pot nor wine for foure and twenty houres after.

They are very good Painters, when drinke and age hath made their hands to quiuer, that you would thinke verylie (as Lucian saith) that hee were sober that did it, when indeed hee is as foxt as forty beggers . They haue also some Poets amongst them, whom their principall neuer crowneth with lawrell (because that tree is a foe vnto the vine) but all with iuye: these Poets are the very off- scum of the basest rascally rabble, I am as much greeued that they should beare that so sacred a name, as Antigenides in Apuleius was, that horne- blowers should be called Cornetiers. They are the veriest Lacklatines , and the most Vn- alphabeticall raggabashes that euer bred lowse: they cannot make two rimes in their mothers tongue in two houres, and yet these shake-ragges liue by other mens trenshers, filling all the tauernes in the town with Epithalamiums , Elegies, and Epitaphes, your eares would blister to heare them, these are they that haue the managing of maskes, and the disposing of Pageants and haue the same sway ouer the vses of balets that the knights of the tunne haue ouer the barrells. They had but one good Poet (as it is said) in an whole age, and hee was starued to death for telling truth out of season. They goe often to warre, in assistance of the Eat-alls ; but they neuer goe armed, not so much as with an Irish steel-coate, a shurt on their backes; their lances are sapplins of Elmes, sharpned and dried at the ends in the fire, but yet notwithstanding (for stand well they cannot) it is admirable to behold both their valour in fight and their fortune in conquest. Indeede they haue a law that none must goe sober to the field, so that the wine maketh them as bold and valiant as Lyons, and you know full well, Audaces Fortuna iuuat , fortune helpes the forward. Bacchus. one of the Quagmyrists , whose house was of some height, beeing loose in the breech, intending to goe thether whether neither Pope nor Emperour can send an Embassador, and being truely tapp-shackled, mistooke the window for the dore, so stepping rashly on, downe hee came with the wrong end forward, and in plaine English, broake his neck. His funeralls were very ritchly set forth: I can tell, for I was at them. Euery man was died, all ouer with black, and for that day ware a cypresse wreath, in steed of his vines. The body was not layd in a coffin, nor vpon an hearse, as we vse, but being put into a caske halfe full of wine was so borne to the graue, and when hee came there, it was to lie rather in a cesterne of sacke, then in a graue of earth, and to bee drowned rather then buried. For whereas the Romanes vsed to cast balls of frankincence vpon the pile wherein the bodie was burnt, they did not so here, but each one powred his kanne of wine into the graue, and bidding thrise Adieu most sweete and corpulent countriman , put finger in their eye, wept some quart of Rheume and to it they went, hand in hand to the Tauerne. This Quagmirist it seemes was well esteemed amongst them, for hee had a statue erected him in Bacchus his court, and vnder it these two verses in faire Romane letters.  Although he tooke his window for his dore His valiat death shal make his honor more. And vpon his graue they set vp a pritty obeliske, and a brazen flaggon on the top of it, with these verses carued round about it. (a)   [  (a) Three such Epitaphes in Lattine are to be seene at Siena, two in San Domingo, and one in S. Spirito. ]  By wine I liu'd, and wine me kild, men say: For being sober, I could nere see day. Gone is my flesh, yet thirst lies in the bone: Giue me one rouse my freind, and get thee gone. Farewell fellow tosse-pots.  Now had I staid too daies in this towne, without euer beeing demanded what I was, but then mine host came and told mee, my friend quoth hee, you haue had a faire reign; if you stay one day longer, you must perforce do sacrifice vnto god Bacchus : I may not conceale you further vnlesse you would haue mee forsworne. No, quoth I? what custome is that I pray you that you are so strictly bound vnto? Tell mee the course, and Ile either performe it and staie longer, or els Ile get mee presently gone, and ridde vs both from future danger. Well sir (saies hee) saw yee not the statue of Bacchus yesterdaie in Gulpers Court , and the huge goblet hee holdeth, wherein they powred the wine that runnes out at two passages? yes that I did. Well then, you must set your mouth to one of them (choose you which) and suck vntill yee bee able to stand no longer, but fall flat to the ground, and so must you lie vnder the spout, wallo-wing in the wine, vntill all bee runne out vpon you. How like you this? Faith not altogither so delightfull (quoth I) but I pray tell mee, was there euer any strangers that offered this sacrifice? All, all, (quoth hee) not a man nor a mans taile escapes it, but to it hee must, maugre his beard; some will come spiritfullie to it, but others are faine to bee haled to their teate, like a Beare to the stake. Well sir (quoth I) but Ile be iogging hence: Onelie I would intreate yee to informe mee which country in this tract is next in dignitie vnto this of yours and worthiest of trauell. So faith hee told mee: Hot-waters quoth hee) is the best, some call it Liguour-ardente , it is vnder the gouernment of Sir Limbeck Stillitorye , a knight of the noble familie of the King-Cuppes : and so ledde mee forth, shewed mee the way, as plaine as Dunstable roade, and then curteouslie gaue mee the Bascio los manos , and I thankt him heartily for his Valienado , and parted. Borachio. Froath , behinde mee, vntill I came at (a)    [  (a) If Bucklersbury stood alone it were very like this towne. Sure as death there is some affinity betweene them ] Spewers-burie , the filthiest towne that euer I saw since my mother cradeled my head. Well I staid not long there (I had not neede) but on I passed vntill I came to Coepers-nor-ton , a pretty well seated village, but not a droppe of water was to bee got in it for loue nor money: the reason is (as I heard afterward) least they should mixe it with the wine and so prooue euill common-wealths men. Onelie this I must tell the reader: by the way, for I promise yee it put mee often to a shrewd putther, I was as much troubled with pottes and flaggons in my iourney, as the traueller that hath farre to goe, is with the Spanish and Italian Crosses: I could neuer goe three miles to an end, but I should finde a bouncing tankard: kenneld vnder an arch, and drinke I must needes, no gain-saying the lawes of the Lands holie hospitality: at last I ouertooke a traueller, in an old tatterd Cassocke of haire-cloath, bare-foote and bare-head. I demaunded whether hee went so fast. Sir (quoth hee) I haue vndertaken a long Pilgrimage vnto Saint Borachio of Bottles-brooke . I wondered at this new name, and this as yet vndiscouered Pilgrimage, so I questioned him at large of the country, of this townes situation, and discipline, and finally of the vertues of this Borachio. Bottles-brooke sir (quoth hee) is seated in the confines of Hot-watria , and Letcheritania , and is of great fame through out both the soiles. Besides diuers other ancient monuments in the towne there is a temple of Bacchus Fiery-face , they call it the Chappell Ardent , where a ritch and rare statue of his is erected, not like a grown man as else-where it is, but of an informed birth, iust as his father tooke him from the burning womb of Semele , so is it, hauing beene long ago so cut, out of the hard Rocke of Rubies. The top of this temple is al set with Carbunickles  & golden sparks, most ritch to behold, & from the embowed arch there drops they say, a kinde of hot fuming liquour (as the (b) of Mar del zur ) and is receiued into a Borachio that standes placed accordinglie, whose vertue is such, that if one drinke a large draught of it with good deuotion, he shall neuer in all his life after be either drunke before noone, or a thirst before midnight: both which helpes may doe mee much good, for I am a man so employed in my countrie, that I can neuer lye in my bed vntill mid-night for thirst, nor neuer rise in the morning but before noone I am drunke and fast a sleepe againe. Therefore haue I gone this three dayes without drinking at all, (saue that I dranke one dish of water this morning) because I would merite the more of this holy Saint Borachio when I come there; nor dares any man importune mee to drinke, or any in my company as long as I weare this weede. Bir-lady sir you must thinke I was not meanly glad of so good a priuiledge, and therefore I intreated both his company and patronage. Well, wee went chatting on, vntill I obseruing the soile altered, asked him where we were now. This country (quoth he) euer since wee came ouer the Lake Metheglin , is called the (c)    [  (c) Our ordinary passe to Ireland is through Wales. ] Countie of Vsquebath , being the first shire of Hott-watria : It is not so well husbanded, but it is farre more fertile then our country of Winecester , exceeding both in fatnesse of soile and purenesse of ayre. So when I heard the name I vnderstood presently both ye originall and the definition thereof. Vsquebathia , because they drinke there Vsque ad ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , euen to the bottome: there are other deriuations thereof, but those I leaue vnto the six wits to censure of. The people of this nation are generally fulsome and slouenly, and of a continuall fearce and terrible aspect (vnlesse they be drunke) yet they vsed mee very kindly for my religious pilgrims sake (as they are very much giuen to superstition) who lodged with me the first night in the common hospitall of an obscure little cittie (I forgot the name) yet we lay very quietly, for wee found all the towne dead drunke at our comming, and left them so at our parting, much other matter past vs, but I leaue it as vnworthy of regarde. At length through many craggie, fennie, woody passages, wee ariued at a famous port towne, called Puerto d' Aqua forte . Now quoth I (being as weary as a dog) whether goe we now? is not this Bottlesbroke ? O Lord no quoth he: but cheere vp your selfe, we haue not a foote of ground more to passe vntill we bee there, all the rest of our iourney lyes by water: which when we haue passed, we shall coast a little by the pleasant shores of Hott- watria , and presently we are at Bottlesbroke : (this country is like Denmarke parted into two by the sea,  & that was the cause of our crossing the water. Well, to ship we went, and away: By this time imagine vs in the midst of the sea: well, my heart is cold yet to thinke but what a danger wee escaped there: for looke yee sir, our Mariners were all drunke to a haire, not a man could guide himselfe, if hee might haue a kingdome. One was a sleepe at the sterne: another going about to row, had Palinures destinie, and fell ouer-boord, who two more seeking to hale vp again, had not we two held the, had both falne after. A third falls into choller,  & laieth a fourth ouer the pate for not helping his fellow: he strikes againe, & to it they go, fight Beare fight dogge: and all the rest diuided themselues on two sides. Now flew the pondrous oares about their eares, and clubbs and pumpe-staues, all their armes appeares, the water was quiet, and euery one vsed his oare in the aire. But indeed they are easily knockt downe, whose ham-strings Bacchus hath already cut in two. Flat they lay, all but a couple of conquerors, who being too late weary of the massacre, fell vpon vs two, laying all the blame vpon vs. But wee two, scorning to bee put downe by two walking tankards, got vp a couple of cudgels, and gaue them their due, disarmed them, bound them fast to the Mast, and plaide the sailers our selues. But our boat (sympathizing belike with hir ancient maisters the drunkards) did so welter from side to side, that had not Ã† olus sent vs a strong gale, and forced the boate on against hir will, wee had laide our bones in the bottome of those seas, for ought that I saw, and my religious fellow had neuer seene Saint Borachio . As we sailed on, I descried a farre of, on the left hand, a certaine high Iland couered with snow, and asking him how he called it, It is (quoth he) the Frozen Iland , where Bacchus liued for feare of his step-dames wrath, when hee was young: and the inhabitants vsing him churlishly, and at length chasing him by force from thence, his father being offended, laid a plague of perpetuall snow and darknesse vpon them. But whence is that smoake I see a farre of? That smoake comes out of Mount Denis ,    [   Dionysius is Denis , and Bacchus both.   ] wherein the soules of such as either liued too soberly, or killed themselues desperately, are purified by fire; and there they burne, vntill some of their liuing friends go in Pilgrimage to Chappell Ardent for a bottle of S  t . Borachios water,  & powring that vpon their tombe, they are freed. I smiled at this, and thought, now surely I haue found the originall of Purgatorie; let Abbat Odilo , and his Monkes of Corunna tell mee neuer so many tales of mount Ã† tna , and many good morrows: 'tis here or 'tis no where. Well, at length we came a shore, and found it a pretty sweete towne in truth (to giue it the due) marry it was both paued with bottles, and roofed with letherne bougets. I doe not remember I saw any attificer in all the towne but letherne Iack-makers, and taylors for Bottle-cases; so that now I saw what vtterance the Eat-alls had for their hides. The reason is, the men of this towne and country, vse no pure wine, as the other Drink-alls doe, but certaine distilled waters mixt with the strongest grape they can get, which are so forcibly hott, that the brittle glasse cannot hold them, and therefore they are driuen to fortifie their bottles with letherne Ierkins, riuetted together with pitch and rosen. The citizens are fiery of face, and cholericke of condition, enuious, suspicious, paralitique, and of a staggering manner of pace in their going: but that which is most terrible of all, they drinke and they breath nothing but meere flames. As much cold water, or scarr-gut, as one of vs will drinke, so much fire will one of them take: that a man would verily imagine when hee saw them, that they were so many fire-drakes, or Saint Georges dragons. I was in danger of water before, but now I feared nothing but that I should be stifled with fire. So that I left my companion in his orisons vnto Bacchus (I loued him well, but I loued my selfe better) the very next morning I got me out of this Vulcans shop, for so it was, and a very Cyclops forge, rather then a Citie of Bacchus . Now being vpon my way, I began to resolue with my selfe to passe by the verges of Lecheritania back againe, and so to see some-what of the fashions of the (a)    [   (a) Otherwise called Strong-bieros .   ] Hop-sackers , the third countie of Drink-allia , but iust as I was plodding on with this thought in my head, rushes mee forth an Ambush of armed Sheelandresses (you heard of Shee- landt before) besette mee, tooke mee, and carryed mee prisoner (the more vnfortunate I) a long and toylesome iourney, euen to the chiefe cittie of the land, called Gossipingoa . I would not haue the reader take any vnkindnesse at my hands for omitting ye rest of Drink-allia , for as my Pilgrim told me, it is the basest part of the land, this countie of Hop-sack ; and but that it is more beast-like, different in nothing from the others which you heard described before.

On the North side it boundeth vpon Letcheritania (a nation that is a great enemy to it) on the South, vpon Thriuingois : on the East, vpon the two Fooliana's , the Fickle and the Fatte. The soile thereof is very fruitfull, but (b)    [ (b) Twere pitty it should be otherwise, being so shrewdly wiued. ] badly husbanded: It is diuided into many Prouinces, both large and ritch, yet all of seuerall conditions, habites and languages. The principall of them are these; Tattlingen Scoldonna, Blubberick, Gigglot-angir the high and the lowe, Cockatrixia, Shrewesbourg , and Blackswanslack , otherwise called Modesciana . Not farre from these is also an Iland called Ile Hermaphrodite , or more properly, Double-sex . Many of these Prouinces did I passe through, sore against my will Ile bee sworne. But to speake the truth, Tattlingen is the best country of all the rest,  & hath many faire cities in it, as Pratlingople, Tales-borne ,  & Lyps-wagg , through the last of which there runneth a great riuer called Slauer , which some-times will ouer-flow the bankes, and drowne all the lower part of the country, which they call Chinn-dale , but the countrimen haue now deuised very strong rampires of bones and bend lether, to keepe it from breaking out any more, but when they lift to let it out a little now  & then for scouring of the channell. But of all the citties of Tattlingen , or of all Shee-landt, Gossipingoa is the principall. Thether was I brought, and deteined a great deale longer then stood with my good liking: I will (for passing away a little time vntill the Capon bee enough, we haue nothing else to do) discourse the whole progresse of their dealing with mee here, and then Ile goe on with the conditions of this new nation. Lecheritania , they brought mee away to their chiefe city,  & so to the court, told a bell, and presently all the inhabitants came flocking thether in a trice, & began to prie more narrowly vpon mee who stood bound sure enough (god wot) for offering them any false measure. At length, one of the rout, (their Captainesse it seemed shee was) gaue a signe to the rest to be silent (as she had need) and then bespake the company thus. What, or of whence this fellow is, I doe not know, onely wee tooke him in the confines of yonder damned country Letcheritania , and seeing they haue offered vs so much iniury, I hold it very fitte now (if it bee not too late) to begin to take reuenge of them, and first with this prisoner. Now she hauing made an end I got leaue (with much a doe for noise) to speake,  & so declared my nation, and the cause of my wandring as well as I could, and told her Womanship that for my part I had not any acquaintance at all in Letcheritania , I was one that wished her Madam-hood and all hir sex all the good I could, and that it would derogate much from her nature, clemencie, and from the honor of her iust gouernment to condemne an Innocent pilgrim, and one that had not offended, without hearing of his cause. Well these good words I can tel yee wrought so prettily well, that the poore yong wenshes began many of them to weepe: yet the old countesses were not so much ouer-swaied by mine oration, but that I must to prison to a great house in the market place called Cold and comfortlesse , vntill my country and cause of trauell were truely manifested vnto the Shee-counsell . Well to warde I went, and but that my countries name (the (a)    [   (a) It is a prouerb in France that England is the paradice of woman, the purgatory of seruants, and the Hell of horses.   ] true Paradice of women) pleaded for mee, I had neuer come home aliue, for all the Lecheritanians that they take, they either faire hange vp, or els put them vnto most slauish offices in this prison. Herein plaging them for their iniuryes offered; for that Nation, although it bee most lasciuious, yet it runeth a madding eirher after whore, or els in bestiality, either neglecting their wiues vtterly, or els keeping them continuall prisoners through mad-braind ielousie. O how many noble captaines did I see here wearing out their liues in spinning, carding woll and knitting? faith at length, for my countries sake, I had my liberty, but not without an oth for I was brought to Iunos Altar , and there laying my hand on the same, tooke a sollemn oth to obserue all these conditions following. That I should neuer goe about to iniure this noble sexe by word nor deed. That I should neuer interrupt a woman in her tale. That wher-soeuer I liued, I should leaue the rule of the house to my wife. That I should neuer more come in Letcheritania , for it is the common phrase here, Many go thether good men, but come away againe euill husbands . That I should neuer aime at more then the loue of one. That I should neuer bewray my wiues secrets. That I should neuer deny my wife any womans ornaments. That I should continually giue women the prick and praise for beauty, wit and eloquence, and defend it against all men. This oth I (b)   [  (b) I beleeue yee sir with a little aequiuocation. ] willingly tooke, & would haue taken one ten times stricter, rather then haue staied there. So therefore you see my tongue is tyed by mine oth, not to tell all the fine Conundrums that I saw among these mad wenches. Somewhat I may say, but no harme, no more I would in truth, if I had not beene sworne at all. superiority, and auoyding obedience. They haue no lawes at all, but do euery thing by the numbers of voices. But the giuing vp of their voices struck me into a wonder, being vnacquainted therewith for they set vp a crie all together, none giues eare, but each one yells as if shee were horne mad. Is not this able to abash a good mans spirit. They hold a continuall parliament about their more weighty affaires of state, so that Erasmus were he aliue now, turning sutors. Now this continuance is necessary because of their lawes vncertainty: for the decrees of this day, may bee all disanulled to morrow, but the same day they cannot, least their law-giuers should seeme vnconstant in their edicts. Euery ones voice is alike in worth, the whole citty thorow, but not euery ones dignity, for they haue a set number of chosen women, they call them Grauesses ,  & these haue the authority of most honor in each particular citie: But they are not borne to this dignity, but elected either for their beauty, or their eloquence, for by these two are all elections ordered. They had once a custome to elect these Grauesses by voices, but afterwards, euery one giuing her voice onely for her selfe, it bred a confusion,  & so made them abolish that maner of election: and then they made a decree yt only those should haue the sway in this enuious contention, who would professe themselues neither faire nor eloquent. But this brought all to such a passe that in the whole multitude of them, you should not find one that would be Electresse , the elder sort holding that they had the eloquence, and the yonger standing as firme in it that they had the beauty. At length they all agree to passe ouer these places of Electresses vnto twelue of the most aged matrons of Old Mumpington (a ruinous village hard by) and so they did, giuing them the glorious title of (c)    [  (c) The chiefe of whom when as I was there were these, The Dutchesse of Cackletout.

And besides this honorable stile, the hony of age, wealth and abundance, comes continually vpon the; for the ambitious young wenshes will so bribe and ply them with giftes, to haue their voices at the day of election, that I hold there is not a court either more corrupt in giuing voices, or more wealthy in giuen ritches. In stead of scepters and swordes, the Grauesses haue fannes and glasses borne before them: huge Christall glasses, and still as they passe through the streetes, they pranke vp their attires by the sayd glasses, and set all their gew-gawes in order as they go along. will needes weare their husbands breeches, or els such as their husbands iealousie will needs either banish or make prisoners, those runne flocking from all parts hether. Now all such as are their husbands maisters, and are therevpon banished for their vniust clayme vnto soueraignty: these are assigned to inhabite the frontiers of Shee-landt especially in the countries of Shrewes-bourg , and there they are all put in garrison. But as for those that are voluntarie exiles, they are generally of meeke and vnmanly spirits, and these are seated in the heart of the Land, to become Votaresses to Peace and to Beautie , and yet you need neuer dreame that this weale-publike (how euer weakely founded) should go to ruine for want of perticuler members: and Ile tell you why: there are so many voluntaries, (especially free women) come to this campe, that the feare is that rather here will want roome for new inhabitants, then otherwise. Truely I am in a great perplexity least my country women should haue any vnderstanding of this state: For if they haue, wee may goe snicup for any female that will bide amongst vs, but all will away, wee should not haue one big belly left to lay the foundation for a future age by, and therefore I pray you sir (whosoeuer you be) as you loue the preseruation of our linage and the generall multiplication of mankinde, bee silent in this so important a secret: for it lies vs all vpon to keepe it vndiscouered from our giddie females, vnlesse wee can find a better meanes of generation. passe-port, and so from thence I tooke my way towards Giglot-tangire , a country lying vpon the South part of Womandecoia , towardes Letcheritania ; The Land of it selfe in this part, is the worlds paradise: I was not many leagues from Loues-den , the first towne of this County, when I entred into an ayre as delicatly sented, as if all the perfumers in England (doe yee see) had lately plaied their prizes there for eternal soueraignty: the whole country round about is so stuft with Apothecaries, and (a)    [  (a) The states Magnificoes. ] Pomandrificoes . The rest I omit. The women of this wapentake are generally tall, gracefully adorned, and (were it not that they practise the art of Cheeke-oyling ouer much) very beautifully. They weare nothing on their faces, nor on their breasts: as for the rest of their habite, it is faire in shew, light in weight, and easie to mount, as is the aire. But their naked parts are so crusted ouer with ouer-grosse painting, (as they vse in Muscouia ) that you would verily imagine, you saw some statue on a Westminster tombe, rather then a liuing creature, such a cart loade of false colours ensconce their fairest beauties. The women of (b)    [   (b) The Sepulchre of Modesty is in this towne. ] Shames-graue , (for so they call the shire towne of Gigglot-tangire ) haue their houses made all of Muscouia glasse, as transparent as ayre: And it is labour lost to seeke any of them at home, vnlesse you make your inquest immediately vpon their dressing time, or some what before: But lay your plot to seeke them at a Play-house, or in a Tauerne, or so, and it stands vpon a good foundation: for there you are sure to finde your femall, either a laughing, a singing, (c)    [  (c) Dauncing is here taken in the largest sence, including both the moderne, as galiard, pauan Iig &c. and the ancient, called the beginning of the worldwide Rab. Apodemat. 17. chap. 3. ] a dancing, or vpon some such employment in state. You neuer saw spider contriue a more artificiall net for a flie, then these women do for the Lecheritanians (how euer their countries deadly enemies) yet some of these men serue their desires as voluntaries, for prouant, and preferment. Others, they lay their ambushes for, and fetch them in first by loose allurements, then by praiers, and then by pence, and if none of these meanes will worke, they compell them to serue their wanton desires by force. And when they haue done so, iust as you see stallion horses kept for breede, so are they stowed into custody, dieted with Eringo's, Potatoes, Cullises, and other dishes of lusts deuising, vntill Venus send her second summons. This I no sooner heard, but I hated, and no sooner hated it, but I auoided it as neither daring presume of my learning, nor policy, but that I knew my selfe neither for proper young man, nor very fine Gentleman (none dispraised) I otherwise durst not haue hazarded mine honesty vpon so slight foundations. But you may see; It is sometimes good to want a good face: and those things with many a man doth oftentimes blame nature most for, may at one time or other stand him in more stead then her greatest benefits in ordinary estimations. Hermose , and Cape Beach , lies Double-sex Ile, much like vnto our Ile of Man on the coast of Lancashire . In this Ile nature hath so orderly disposed all things to one forme, that I could finde no one plant in all the soile but was of a double kinde; no tree, but beare two kinde of fruites or one fruite of two seuerall kindes  & names: there was your Peare-apple , your Cherry-damsen , your Date-alimond , your Chestnut-fylberd , and a thousand of these conclusions of nature. Yea in so much that the very inhabitants of the whole Iland wore all their habits as Indices of a coaptation of both sexes in one. Those that bare the most man about them, wore spurres, bootes and britches from the heeles to the hanshes: and bodies, rebatoes and periwigges from the crupper to the crowne: and for those that were the better sharers in woman kind, they weare doublets to the rumpe, and skirts to the remainder. Nay their very names bare notes of their perticipations of either side: There was Mary Philip, Peter-alice, Iane-andrew , and George-audry , and many more that I remember not. All of their owne nation that haue not shewn themselues perfect both in begetting,  & bringing forth, are made slaues to the rest: & when they take any that are but simply of one sexe, Lord what a coile they keepe about the, shewing them as prodigies & monsters, as wee doe those that are borne double-headed, or other such deformed birthes. Their onely glory which they esteeme most, is that in their conceite they haue the perfection of nature amongst them alone, of all the world besides them. For seeing nature (say they) hath bestowed two hands, two feete, two eyes, two eares and two nosthrills to euery meaner perfect bodie, why should not the most excellent creature of all be perfect in two sexes also? And againe: the ancient sacrificers to Cybele , and the Pathiques of old Rome were faine to vse forced meanes for that which wee haue giuen vs by nature. Thus are they wont to protect their deformities: and truely you may obserue in them all, besides their shapes,    [   (a) The Mule is held both to conceiue and to beget, in Syria, Arist , and some hold the like of the Hare .   ] both a mans wit, and a womans craft. They haue no Cattle in this countrie but Mules nor any wild beasts but Hares . They liue most vpon shelfish, for that is their best and most ordinary sustenance. most westerne angle of the same, I light (iust as my staffe fell) into the Country of Shrewes-bourg , the onely garrison of this feminine gouernment, and the onely defence it hath against forreigne incursions. Now the country fearing no foe but the Leteheritanians (for the Thriuingois are a quiet nation and neuer will offer to molest them, and the Foolianders cannot though they would) doe therefore place their fortes and townes of garrison vpon the Easterne frontiers of Letcheritania . Here was I truely guld; for espying persons in the habites of men, masse thought I, this is good, I am now gotten out of Womendecoia : but when all came to all, I was flat cousned with a borrowed shape: for in this countrie women weare britches, and long beards, and the men goe with their chinnes all naked, in kirtles and peticoates; spinning and carding wooll, whilest their wiues discharge the maine affaires of the state. In this tract is an ancient and ample towne seated, generally called Pepuzia , and I do not thinke but (a)    [   (a) Arist. de h aeres. ] Pepuzian Heretiques were of this originall, who held that women should be both Princes and Priestes as well as men: The Barbarians in (b)  9 Aristotles time neuer vsed their women halfe so imperiously as the men are vsed here: I had great compassion vpon their slauery: Yes verely had I: The poore snakes dare not so much as wipe their mouthes vnlesse their wiues bidde them: not so much as (sauing your presence) goe pisse, nor passe a word with their best friend, but they must first come to their wiues with a writ of Qu aeso Magistra , good Mistresse giue me leaue to goe &c. I obserued this custome to bee more strictly looked vnto vpon one certaine daie whilest I was there, then at other times by far: and the reason was, because that while some of the better spirited husbands disdayning to bee chained in this vnmanly subiection by their wiues, had laid a plot amongst themselues to rise on a set night (as it might bee this night) in open armes vpon the sudden against wiues, and so shake off this infamous and disgracefull seruitude. This plotte had come to verie good effect had not misfortune crossed it: for one cowardly fellow of their confederacy, beeing threatned by his wife to bee soundly cudgelled for some other priuate escape that hee had made; to procure himselfe a pardon, went and reuealed all the whole plat-forme of the conspiracie, iust the euening before the night appointed. The women sitte at meate and the men attend, the women sleepe and the men watch; so doe they scold and fight, whilest the men are faine to beare off with eares, head and shoulders. Happy may they call that daie whereon they are not lambeaked before night. I imagined my selfe amongst the Turkish slaues, but that these distinction of habites assured mee this was a more base kinde of captiuity. Ah what a beastly sight was it to see a distaffe and a spindle in a mans hand, and a sword and buckler in a womans. Yet I concealed my dislike as well as I could, desiring but to see without suffering. If any woman vse her husband somewhat gentlier then ordinarie (as some of them bee tender hearted) shee is presently informed against, cited to appeare before the Court Parliament of Shrewes-bourg , and there endited of high treason against the state. Her next neighbours giue euidence against her with such noise  & furie, that it is strange to see how farre they are ouer-borne with impatience. If she be but conuicted by the smallest euidence that is, shee is condemned to this punishment. Shee must first change attires with her husband, and then shaue off all her haire, aud so beeing ledde through the market place must stand for one whole daie vpon the pillorie, as an obiect vnto all the fleering scoffes of the beholders, nor shall the man escape scot- free, for beeing so audacious, as to take the fauours offred by his wife without a modest refusall: but when the woman comes home (be shee all couered with durt, graines, rotten-egges, &c.) she may not put off her vesture vntill shee bring a cudgell into the Court, all died with the fresh bloud of her husbands broken pate. He that out-liueth his wife, must either marry his maide and bee sworne to her seruice as hee was to his former wiues, or els hee must become slaue to the next neighbours wife. For no man may bee the ruler of his owne house, in this country: when the wife goeth forth, either to warres, consultations, or for pleasure, she leaueth her keyes, & therewithal her gouernment vnto her maide, or her daughter: Either of which if the husband but once mutter against, his shoulders are sure to pay for it soundly at his wiues returne, vnlesse hee can either begge or buy the silence of the deputie gouernesse. They (a)   [   (a) Iust court fashion in England  ] neuer lie with their husbands but when prouander prickes them: For that (they hold) would procure too much familiarity, notwithstanding if the husband arise not out of his cabbin in the entry before the wife bee warme in her bedde, and comming vppe staires bare-foote, knock thrise gentlie at her Chamber dore, and offer her his seruice in a soft voice hee is sure to haue on the ribbes the next day. The women of this tract obserue a fashion directly contrary vnto ours, for they (b)   [  (b) That there may bee lesse hold taken by their assailants, and more by themselues. ] clip their haire and let their nailes grow long. There are also certaine amongst them that are Proffesitrixes of the Noble Science , and keepe free schooles, wherein the rest are taught al the wards offensiue and defensiue, both of heeles, nailes and teeth: as also the most exact and iudiciall method of clawing off the skinne of mens faces, pulling out eyes, byting of armes, wringing of eares, and tearing of beards: These lectures they are instructed in both by precept and practise. Now you would thinke it incredible if I should tell you of the neatenesse of their houses, yet the men are all their drudges to wash, wipe, scoure and sweepe all that is done: yea and dresse all the meate besides: so that I imagine that it is but mans esteeme of the vndecencie of such businesses, (not any of his vnablenesse to discharge them) that maketh him eschue such employments. There is no foule spot to bee found in any house here, sauing on the mens clothes, but those are so filthie that they are true notes how they neglect themselues as much as the women neglect them; Notwithstanding goe but abroad into the fieldes (which are the womens charge to see to) and there you shall finde all most beastlie: The verie walls of the Citties are halfe downe and that which standeth is so disgracefullie framed, that the verie stones seeme to begge to bee at mans dispose, and to abhorre the ordering of womankinde. I know gentle Reader thou maruelest much how I gotte safelie away from such a daungerous place, and from so mischieuous a forme of gouernment. Faith Ile tell thee truely, mine age, my habite, and good aduise were my patrons in all this perrilous aduenture. My habite was manlike, my face womanlike (for I had yet no beard) and besides I met a many of my owne countrimen (a strange chance in a region so vnknowne) whom I knew by sight as well as the begger knowes his dish: verily I did, and these (like true friends at need) gaue me such good directions, that (  10 as Ã† neas did by Sybilla ) I following their aduises got at length (though with much toile and daunger) through all the dirty fennes of (c)    [  (c) Where the women will fal a weeping vpon any wager, euen when they list. ] Blubber-ick , ouer the Mushrumpallian Mountaines, and so finally into the confines of Fooliana . But now you may come vpon me with another question, and aske me why I trauelled not in that part when the Modestinians , the women of Black Swan- mark had their habitation. Truely I hold my selfe infortunate in that one thing alone, that I could not come to see their state as well as the rest, seeing that my minde presageth vnto me, that it excelleth all the fore-named. There is such a people my friend I tell thee plaine: but the region wherein they inhabit I could neuer come to discouer, onely the name I brought from their ancient chronicles of the other states, and that as I sayd is (d)    [   (d) A chaste and modest woman, is Rara auis in terris, nigroque simillima cigno, Iuuenal .   ] Black-Swan-marke . Indeed there are some of them that liue as Anchoresses, and Hermitesses in the craggie deserts of some other parts of Shee-landt , but their habitations are generally vnknowne, and almost inaccessible: these notwithstanding are the monestaries, whether (as it is reported) the fairest, chasest, and most zealous of the Shee-landresses doe voluntarily retire themselues: hee that will take the paines to search those vast deserts, may questionlesse meete with some of those holy Votaresses: I light by chance of one or two of them, whose variety of vertues, beauties and behauiours haue left mee in an extasie vntill this very houre: but our young trauellers being too idle to enter vpon so hard an inquest, that is the cause why they haue no other colour to couer their slouthfulnesse by, but by vniustly alledging the smalnesse of the number of honest women. Finis lib. 2. The Discouerie of Fooliana . ] vast and ill-husbanded region that euer mine eyes beheld, and yet withall, the most populous. If a man should but goe into the Burse of any towne of traffique in this whole nation, he would sweare (as one did once of Paris ) that the whole world came to trade thether. I am not ignorant of the number of the people that are imagined to be in all Europe , take it therefore as from the Historiographers, and not from mee. Italy is said to conteine 9000000, more or lesse: Spaine , a number somewhat lesser; England , 3000000; the Low Countries as manie; both the Germanies , 15000000; France as many; Sicilia 130000: Wee know also what they (that vse to amplifie vpon all things) say of the number of the inhabitants of China , that they do amount vnto 70000000. That countrie paralelld with the whole country of Fooliana , is rather an vnhabitable desert the a peopled nation: it lieth iust vnder the Antarctike pole, as the (b)    [   (b) Mercator in his Atlas Geograph , affirmes as much.   ] Pigmey-land lieth vnder the Articke : and hence doe I gather (as any man else may) that the extremity of cold in both these opposed regions, is cause both of the Pigmees littlenesse, and the Foolianders blockishnesse: nature so well gracing hir selfe by effecting the defect of body in one place, and counterpeysing it with as great a defect of witte in another. To confirme this, doe we not see that such as inhabite the temperate Zones are generally perfect both in body  & mind: But let this be remooued vnto the cloisters of the Philosophers, I must proceed with my purpose. Fooliana , on the South butteth vpon Tenter-belly , on the East vpon Shee-landt , and the farthest corner of Thriuingois , and finally on the West, vpon Theeueswijck . namely there is Fooliana the fickle , in the Easterne frontires: Fooliana the craggie , iust vnder the Pole: Fooliana the fatte , towards the South- west, Fooliana the fond , betweene both: and Fooliana the deuoute , towards the West. Now the inhabitants of all these fiue, are generally tall of body (for all the vehemencie of the cold climate wherein they liue) their haire a pale flaxen, their heads (a)    [   As Homer saith of Thersites , ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/xgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) .  .   ] like sugar-loues; their lipps bigg like a Moores , and their eares thick and spacious. But their conditions do not keepe all one forme: some things they haue generally in them all, and they are these: what euer stranger arriue amongst them (vnlesse he light in Fooliana the craggie ) they presently entertaine him with all the pleasures that their towne-house,  & table can by any means affoord: Come wee to any of them all, with a dust- licking congee ,  & some three or foure vostra Signioria's , Spaniard like, and either commend his good face, his new coate, his fine hand, his faire house, or season but his affections with an admiring applause, and this your obsequiousnesse shall purchase you an hoste whose curtesie will imagine nothing too deare for you; good words  & faire promises are all the moneys that this nation vseth; yet they haue great store of gold, which they barter away for feathers, bells, timbrells, and garlands, happy hee that hath the best store of such commodities to vtter at these Ports. The inhabitants are of a hard constitution, going bare-brested, & thin attired in the depth of winter, to take ayre the better: marry in the heate of summer, they were rugge gownes, and cloakes aboue that, to keep out heare the better: yet they haue some Philosophotericall professors amongst them, that will go almost naked in midst of winter, in contempt of the colde, and their reason is this, that seeing all creatures besides man can bee content with haire and hide onely, why should not man that is made maister to them all, make shift to breake through all the battalions of colde, being armed onely with his shirt of nature, his skin? I promise you, a strong  & sensible argument. You shall neuer take any of them solitary, for they doe continually talke and contend in argument with them-selues when they are alone and in game: you shall haue them fall terribly out sometimes with themselues onely; one word prouoking him to teares, & another immediatly procuring laughter, & the person being all this while single by himselfe. They haue also certaine sects of people, generally called Fool-osophers amongst them, and these haue the same credit there, that the Bonzoes haue in China . I haue well neere forgotten their seuerall orders: some of them run vpo my tongues end, and I thinke (I am not sure) that there was one sort called Browne-backs , and another called (b)    [   (b) Cluniacenses. ] Clunches : besides (as I remember) there are the (c)    [   (c) The Trinitarians with square caps.   ] Quadricornes , the Barly-faces , the Greene-geese , the societies of Saint Patch del Culo , Saint Gynny come home at noone ,  & many more that are far fro my remembrance all these giue their own allowances vnto others, and begge for scraps themselues, wandring through ye verges of Fooliana ,  & where they finde a stone with any picture vpon it, (be it what it will) downe they go vpon all foure, with curtsies, and cringes, 'tis more the strange to obserue them: gold is ready change with them for led, prouided it haue a taile of parchmet at the end of it. Tapers and noone day meete ordinarily at euery dinner time amongst them. To eate flesh is altogether vnlawfull for them; but for fish, take your gorge full gratis , and neuer breake statute for it, Ile bee your warrant: It is a sinne inpardonable (d)    [   (d) The tale of the Franciscan and the Dominican is common.   ] for some of them to touch gold or siluer with their bare hands: as it is also their generall custome scarcely to salute any man, yet may they neither omitte crosse, nor carued statue without a religious duck: They whip them-selues cruelly; the (e)   [   (e) Who were solemnly scourged at the altar of Diana Plut. in Apoph.  ] Spartans boyes scourging was but a flye blowing vnto this of theirs: first because no man but themselues will vndergoe sore lashes, and secondly because in the obedient times, they had a tradition giuen them yt calues bloud was a pleasing sacrifice to their gods nosthrils. Their crownes are shauen, eyther to put the world in minde that all men are borne bald, or, for auoyding heate of the head, or else, least the haire growing betwixt heauen and the braine, should bee any hindrance to the minde in her celestiall meditation. Onely two things (in my simple iudgement) they are iustly to be accounted too wittie in: first in that they bring the people into such a fooles paradice, that they fetch all the fruits of other mens labours into their platters, whilest themselues sitte at ease in their cells: and secondly, in that they can so cunningly auoide the bearing of their crosses at home, by getting grasse for their stallions abroad, and by keeping their foles at other mens mangers. There is witte in this beleeue me. If any of these monasticall men be sick, the couent neuer ceaseth weeping till he either goe for vp, or take a longer day: Phisick hee must haue none: yet when they are in their pangs of death, their foolosophers anoint them with oyle: They measure not ones wisdome by his silence (for so may one of Iohn of Paules Church-yeards blocks, prooue wiser then he himselfe) but by the choise composition and deliuerance of good  & gracefull termes: Hee is held a wise man, that speaketh not much vnto little purpose, not he that speaketh little vnto none at all. They neuer come on horse-back, nor a shipp-board, but hold it fondnesse to hazard their liues either on a stumbling iade, or in a weltring barge: they suck vntill their beards come: nor do they euer bury their dead, holding it a slauish part for a man to tumble his parent, wife, brother or so, into an hole, because that life is out of them, & to make a feast of them vnto the wormes, because of the lack of a little breath, & therfore they (f)   [   (f) As the Indians of Brasilia, Peru , and other places did when these parts were first discouered.   ] 11 hang them vp in the aire, in their best attire, & euery yeare keepe a solemne obite in honor of their departed ghosts, iust in the place where they are hung vp, and this forme of buriall is most ancient, as may bee gathered out of many monuments yet extant in Fooliana the deuoute . The women of this nation are the principall gouernesses also of the state, but their dominions more tolerable in that their witts cannot informe them of the true state of Soueraignty. But what they haue (as I was told) grew first vpon this:  12 The Shrewes-burgesses whilom ouer-run all the whole region of Fooliana , which not-with-standing by reason of the barrennesse of the soile, they would not possesse, but left the inhabitants in possessio: prouided, they held it no longer then they did homage for it vnto them; paying them an Asse laden with gold, for their yearly tribute. This rent was paied a long time, vntill at last the Foolianders brake out vpon these conditions, that as for the gold, they did not respect it, so that the Shrews-burgesses would demand it when it was due: but for them to force a louing creature, and one of their naturall towne-borne country-broode, with stroakes and battes, to beare this burden out of their land against his proper will and pleasure, this was a condition very hard, nay to their iudgments intollerable; besides that their quiet hereby stood in doubt; for one asse (you know) being heauier then another, if gold and asse and all, weighed more or lesse this yeare then they did the yeare before, the Shrews-burgesses might alledge that they had not their due: especially (which is a maine reason of this breach) seeing that the poore creature, though seeming neuer so able to beare out his burden at first, yet after a few dayes iourneys hath beene forced to lay him downe vnder his loade. This message incensed the Shrewesburgesses much, where-vpon to armes they go,  & entring Fooliana , came without any resistance vnto Blocksford , otherwise called Duns-ton , the chiefe citie of the land: alarum was giuen: out comes all the Block- fordians hurling vpon an heape without armes or order. The foe was fairely ranged, and gaue the charge: downe falls a citizen or two, which the rest beholding, fell all vpon their knees in submission, with prayers for mercy, and protestations of innocencie: The weapons were held, and by and by one of the grauest Foolianders bespake them in this maner.    [   The Foolianders oration vnto the Shrewes-burgesses .   ] Ah what a violent inundation of cruelty hath ouerflowne your good hearts, you right valiant Shrewes-burgesses ? that for one poore Asse you should kill thus many proper men, and pritty schollers: especially (and oh let this especiall reason rule yee) seeing that one quick asse, or one asse being quick (do ye vnderstand me) would haue bin more seruiceable to your estate then a thousand (a thousand said I? may then fiue and forty) men being dead, as naile in dore? take, (mistake me not, I bid you take) take euery one his asse, and his burden of gold, we had rather liue without them then to die for them: you shall all haue asses (asses are not so scant in this country of ours) once more I say, you shall haue asses, Gods plenty:  o then put vp your shining things, & spare the liues of a many weaponlesse men: I know (& to your honor be it spoken) I do vnderstand that your valour scornes to stand in defence against a weaponlesse wretch: O spare vs then I do beseech you, & free vs from that present feare! Wel, the conqueresses are moued by this patheticall oration, & consented to giue them their pardons, mary vpon this condition, that the women of Fooliana should euermore in domestique employments, haue preheminence before the men. The vanquished gaue their humble consents, and wee thanke yee too, for it was a noisome toile to them to bee euer-more in the taile of a slow-back, egging him on to performance whether hee would or no. great , and next vnto Shee-landt . Expect not here (gentle reader) any exact description hereof: how I found it, and how I left it, I know thou shalt know as well as I: but if you chance to go thether your selfe (as many a fine Gentleman I can tell yee, and men of good worship haue done within this few yeares) and finde not the state as I describe it vnto you, blame not any defect in me: for their formes of gouernment are so dayly altered, that one may describe yee the shape of Proteus , or the colour of the Cham aelion , or tell what wether it will bee to morrow, sooner then giue you any true notice of their discipline. The Portugales may brag of their trauels and discoueries, let them do so, but I durst venter a large wager, that if it could be tried, the ancient (a)    [  (a) It is naturall to the French-man to be a wethercocks ape, and to an English man (pardon me you few of firmer spirits) to bee his ape. ] French-men did first discouer this country, there are as yet so many monuments remaining that shew it, both in the names of the townes, their most ancient lawes, and their chiefe coines. Their grounds neuer cary any one certaine forme two yeares together: that which is pasture this yeare, shall bee arrable the next: that which was all high mountaines this yeare, shall be all carried away to fill vp dales withall, the next. Nay they turne the very course of their riuers also, so that sometimes, as Virgil saith.  (b)    [  (b) Virgil. ] Plaustra boues ducunt qua remis acta carina est. The plough now teares that vp, yt whilom was A way for nothing but for boates to passe: So do the inhabitants shut out their swelling riuers on one side, & they themselues (raging at their forced stops) carue themselues a new course out on the other sides. They haue great store of magnificent cities, but they change their fashion euery other day at the farthest: The chiefe of which, at my first comming thether, was called (c)   [   (c) Which is in Italians' Butter flye.   ] Farfellia , but ere I went away, it was decreed by the whole body of the counsell, that it should thence-forth bee called Butterflieux the whole frame of this city goeth all vpon wheeles,  & may be drawne like a cart, whether the councels pleasures is to haue it. It is recorded to haue altered the situation a hundred times since the foundation, & thirty times it hath quite lost the former shape.

The riuers are all so frozen ouer with the extreame colde, that if any towne be wearie of the old place it may passe the waters vnto a new one. Euery moneth the forme of the city changeth, for euery house is separable from the next vnto it: so that as soone as euer they finde any the least fault with the old neighbors away goes house and household and all, to seat themselues in a new street. The armes where-with this cities scutchion was whilom charged, was a Snaile with her shell on her back, on a chiefe argent: the words, Mea mecum , I cary mine owne about mee : but now it is the Butterflie desplaied, in a field vert and floured: the word, Vbilibet : Where I list . Sect. 1. seeing that these light things kept the little birds warme enough, why (say they) should we desire now beeing farre more able to beare out could then those poore and tender creatures are? Now when they would seeme to haue new- coates, then they change the places of their fethers: so that that which in the morning wore on their heads, commeth before night to wipe the dust from their heeles, and so the rest, that which kept the knee warme but now, by and by getteth vp aboue halfe a yard higher. They do marry wiues, and loue them pestilently well for a while; keping them selues truly loyall to their espousalls, vntill they either take some occasion of dislike in their old bedfellow, or chance to behold another that is fairer then she: and then, farewell wife, and welcome with all mine heart husband sayth shee; for the wife is commonly as willing to make exchange, as the man is:    [  (a) Iust as our Citizens vse a man as long as hee hath cash, you haue him, brow and bosome, but that fayling, my maister is not within sir. ] (assure your selues that shee taketh the first dislike, if her husbands Cocke-shippe bee, any way declyning). They vse a stranger for the first daie as if hee were their owne brother, (though they neuer saw him before): marry the next daie they will passe you by, and forget that euer they knew yee. They seldome or neuer proferre anything which they doe not call backe againe at the next breath they take, before the promise bee confirmed: Nor doe they euer promise, but they afterwards forsweare it, vntill it bee performed: nor doe they euer performe any thing which they doe not afterwards, (though all to late) repent and bee sorie for. They will not sell you any thing to day, but if you dislike it, they will giue you double the price you paid for it to morrow. They make their lawes new euery yeare once: for it is not fit (thus they defend it) seeing all mans life is mutable, that the rules of life should not bee mutable also as well as the effects: besides, mans second cogitations being generally more perfect, it were a strange slauery to bee tied so to a first decree, that although the after-wit dislike it neuer so, may not be altered.

Some foure miles from Giggumbobbia , there is a plaine where there were certaine old coines digged vp whilest I was there, I care not much if I shew you the formes of some of them. One was a square peece, hauing a Ianus head with two faces on the one side, and the semblance of a globe-like stone vpon a smooth table on the other, and in darke rust-eaten letters, this about it. FBR. VAR. DVC. the forme was this. There was another that was round, hauing on one side one in a gowne, seeming to bee of a middle age, leaning his right hand vpon the head of a little prettie dogge, and holding in the left hand, a booke; and on the other side was a Cham aeleon enameled in all her altering colours, and ouer her, these wordes, Const. Lips. This figure, as I remember it bare. The third was larger, and of more value it seemed; bearing the figure of an egge: hauing on one side a leane face with a long nose, and a wreath of lawrell about the fore-head: on the other, a (c)   [   (c) Polipus is a disease in the nose, called Noli me-tangere aswell as a many footed fish. ] Polypus (a many-footed fish called a Pour-countrell , vpon a stone, passing well cut verely: the word was Pour-Bon .

Yet are there two Colledges in the towne: one of the (a)    [  (a) Philosophers that held themselues discussers and exact inquirers of all things. Gell. lib. 11. chap. 5. ] Skeptikes , who deny that their is any trust to bee giuen to the sence: and they are such absolute suspenders, that they dare not for their eares decree any thing positiuely, no not this, that they ought to hold al things in suspence. Steale away any one of their purses, cloakes or victualls (b)    [   (b) In Diog. L aert.

Speake to him or touch him, hee heares, sees, and feeles you, yet he dare not assure himselfe that any one thing of this is true. The other Colledge consisteth wholie of Gew-gawiasters , who giue them selues wholy to the inuention of nouelties, in games, buildings, garments, and gouernments. Hee that can deuise a new game or a new fashion, according to his inuention hath a place of dignity assigned him by the Duke. He that first deuised to blow out bubbles of sope and spettle forth of the walnut shell, is of as great renowne amongst them, as euer was the first Printer, or Gun-founder amongst vs of Europe : these Gew-gawiasters , are in great esteeme in Court, yea and amongst the meaner sort also, in so much that many of them will not put on a tatter, nor once moue, without their directions. Nay these I can tell yee are schollers indeed: they haue deuised a new language wherein they kept the misteries of their knowledge, onely to themselues: it is called the (b)   [   (b) So do the Paracelsists call their balderdashe.   ] Supermonicall tongue.

Ouer the portch are these words enchased in Corall. 14 Merentum locus est: procul hinc discedite laeti:  This is the place where sorrow dwels and care: Fly far, far hence, all you that mirthfull are. The people of this nation are generally al haire-be growne, leane, slouenly, swarty complexioned, rough headded, sternely visaged, and heauy eyed, fixing their lookes as in amazement, and seldome mouing their ey-bals: their optike organs stand far into their heads, making them looke like so many hollow-eyed sculls. Here it is in vaine to looke either for citty or village: they dwell euery man in a place far from other, as Hares choose their seates: and professe a kinde of life most truly Heremiticall : partly because they are of too suspicious and fearefull a nature to dwell in companie;  & partly because the Duke hath expressly forbidden all men to build any one house within the sight of another, or within the distance of thus many miles from any habitation whatso-euer. They seldome or neuer stirre forth a dores, partly for the continuall darkenesse that couereth all this climate, and partly for their owne, and their Princes pleasures: and when they doe goe abroad they doe very seldome salute any one they meet, for this is one statute in their lawes: Let no man stirre abroad, but vpon necessity, nor salute any man hee meetes but vpon (a)    [  (a) This the Carthusians obserue very duly, and deuoutly. ] Thursdaies .

Faith in imagining  & framing fictions to themselues of things neuer done, nor neuer likely to bee done: in beleeuing these their fictions, and in following these beleefes: This is the reason why they abhorre company, and hate to bee interrupted in their ayrie castle-buildings. You shall haue one of them directly perswaded that hee is dead, and lying all along vnder the stoole, like a dead carcasse. If any one come to question him, hee flieth in his face with most violent furie, supposing him some Necromancer, that hath called his soule backe againe from the dead, by his magicall enchantments, and from that time forwards, (b)   [   (b) So did one Pasander in a melancholy fit.

Another is of opinion that he is become a Mole, and lieth in a caue vnder ground, hunting for wormes, and turning vp the earth with a pike vpon his nose prouided iust for the purpose: if any one follow him, and giue him but a little pricke, hee presently beleeueth himselfe taken by the Mole-catcher, and with miserable cries prepares himselfe to bee hung vp on the hedge. A third holds himself to be Atlas , the worlds supporter; and so standeth immoueably still, now and then fetching a sigh or two sometimes lifting vp his shoulder, and sometimes shrinking it downe-wards: now when hee hath swet a little with this excessiue toile, if any one come and thrust him from his station, he presently falls flatte downe on his face with roares and cries, expecting euery moment when the skies should fall vpon him, and railing at the wickednesse of man, that had so little respect of his owne preseruation, and the safety of the whole world. Another auowes himselfe to bee Meg aera , one of the furies, & affrighteth the passengers with terrible gestures: shaking his haire (which he thinkes is nothing but snakes) hissing, and running at them that come by him, with open mouth: if hee catch a whelpe or a catte, o how hee will torture it: and imagining it the soule of some sinner, taketh great pleasure in the cries of the poore beast (as it is said Aiax in his madnesse did by the Rammes). Another beleeues his nose to be grown of such a size, (as Cyngar did in (c) [   (c) The inuentor of the Macaronicall tongue, hee wrote of the gests of Balius, Cyngar, Fracasso, Vinnazzo, Seraffus, &c. all in Strambottologicall verse.  ] Cocaius ) he gets him a great many thongs, to bind it vp at his back for the more conuenient cariage.

On the side of the highest mountaines of all the Nose-autems is Cholly-melans caue . It hath a narrow entrance, and is almost frozen vp with Ice, but it is as it seemeth by the sound, of a large compasse within. All the sides of the entry are hung with huge Ice-hickles, which shewing like teeth, do make the place seeme like the picture of Hels-mouth. In this caue they say the soules of melancholike persons are plagued with continuall and extreame cold: whosoeuer offers to looke in (as few will that wise are) is presently struck downe sencelesse, where his body lieth a good while dead, expecting the returne of his tormented spirit: but hee that layes his eare to the ground a little without the hole, oh what howling, sighing, ratling of chaines, and falling of Ice-sickles shall hee seeme to heare? Or hee that sleepeth vpon any part of this mount (which I more hardily then warily aduentured) good God what Chim aera's, Centaures , and thousands of such amazefull apparitions shall hee (to his horror) behold in his dreames! a brood of hasty, furious, haire-braind, mad people:    [  The natural token of choller. ] low of stature, pale-faced, read headed, ferret eyed, trembling lipped, & vnequally (though ordinarily hastie) paced. These are all vnder the gouernment of Duke Swash-buckliero , the model  & Embleme of all tyrranny. The reader will admire, and hold it incredible, that he should vse his subiects as he doth. The famous Russian tyrant was a mercifull Prince in respect of this man: there was neuer C aesar , neuer Cannibal so bloud- thirsty as he is. Here now the ingenious searchers of nature may make a great doubt, how a nation so exorbitantly cold, should produce such extraordinarily fiery constitutions, the bodies of others generally following the nature of the clime wherein they are borne. O sir, content your selfe whosoeuer yee be (if not, yee may choose, I will neuer intreate yee) wee Philosophers know well inough, that where the heat is kept in by the stronger Antiperistasis , that is, where it is the stronglier bound in by encircling cold, there it breaketh out into a more violent operation. Doth not Affrica , that burnt region, produce serpents of the coldest nature of all others?    [ Mercurial. var. lection. Georg. Agric. lib. de Subterean.  ] are there not flies bred in ye furnaces of Cyprus , whose cold do quite extinguish the heat of the fire? hath not the thunder and lightning their first originall in the midle region of the ayre? and is not the whole earth often-times shaken by a fire, hatched in the depth of her owne cold bowels? wel, Philosophy is on my side, and I dare therefore be bold to say what I doe say. On with our description. This Dukedome is diuided into foure weapentakes; Sallow-hew, Grene-chekes, Blew brow , and (a)    [   (a) As much to say Fiery-front.

If hee meete any man that will not giue him the wall; catzo del diablo , slaue, drawe, or prepare thy selfe to kisse my pumpe, for the resarciation of mine honour. They neuer make any iourney forth, but they eyther bring blowes home, or leaue some behinde them: If one chance to kill his enemy, hee feedes vpon him immediatly, for they eate raw flesh altogether, and drinke warme bloud, and this is the best esteemed fare. They haue no lawes, but all goes by might and maine. Hee that is wronged, either reuengeth his owne wrong, or else hee may go home, sitte him downe, and so turne ouer the leafe  & sing: All the rules they follow is but one and that is this, Conquer and possesse . If you haue any minde to reuenge a wrong, to regaine what was your owne, or to take from another, you may call him to the field at any time, and he must come, or loose his estate. If any come to interrupt yee, and so begin a sedition all that remaine vnslaine, are forth-with forfaited to furnish the Dukes shambles, which crafty lawe doth both suppresse conspiracies, that were otherwise very likely to bee daily practised vpon the state, and also furnisheth the Dukes table in farre greater aboundance, and at farre lesse charges. The chiefe seate of the Duke is called (c)    [   (c) Built iust after the forme of Tangir in Africa .   ] Fierce-fooliangir , a great citie, but it is built onely of wood-worke, the Duke would not haue it otherwise, that hee might the better (vpon iust cause giuen) set it on fire, and so burne cittie and cittizens when his pleasure is. It is inhabited with none but Tinkers, Black-smiths,  & Butchers, in whose shops you shall as commonly see legges of men hang vp, as here with vs you shall finde pestels of Porke, or leggs of Veale. Through this citty runs the riuer Furieuse , with a course like a torrent, which in winter they say will be exceeding hotte (aboue your fountaines in frost) and giueth vp vnwholesome fumes. Hard by it stands the Dukes Pallace, on the top of an exceeding high hill, called Mount Scalpe , and it is reported how it is growne to this height onely by the multitude of dead mens heads that haue beene throwne on an heape continually in this place. The Dukes Pallace is built of brick, very strong, yet liueth hee in a continuall suspect of his subiects loyaltie, and had rather trust his owne Iron gates, then their glassie obedience Hee hath a guard of 10000. (d)    [ (d) Eps, ware, Things , and Welsh Dauie , were whilom of his gard, as I was credibly enformed by such as knew.   ] Hacksters , who are ministers both to his furie and gluttony. If any stranger come heere, that knoweth not how all goeth, he is presently seazed vpon,  & his head presented to the Duke for picking meat at supper, which hee holdeth more delicate, and hunteth more after, then euer did Vitellius after the (e)    [   (e) Sueton in Vitelio .   ] Phoenicopters tongues, or Lampreyes intrailes. Hee likens a Negro to a Thrush, and a white man to a Quaile; but such as dye onely to doe his gutts seruice, are farre better vsed then the rest, for they (as (f)    [   (f) Diod. si. cul.  ] Olympias offered Euridice ) haue their choice what way they will dye, whether being hangd or beheaded. The most famous mount in all this Pallace, is the Inquisition chappell, they call it Saint Shambles : dedicated vnto the powers infernall, whose statues stand all therein, in horrible figures, wrought all with Ieatt and Corall, and these doe they offer their orisons vnto. Here might you behold all the sorts of deaths and tortures possibly to bee deuised: Wheeles, Iibbets, Hatchets, Halters, Swords, Clubbes, and rusty Pistols, so old, that I dare passe my worde for the Chinians , they will confesse that they had their first Gunnes from hence. A thousand Altars are in this Chappell, fuming with continuall sacrifices to the Deuill, and the Duke , offering the soule to appease the furie of the first, and the body to satiate the couetousnesse of the later; and for the bloud, they haue a certaine Arte to keepe that from congelation, and so caske it vp like Aligant , for the Dukes owne weasand. Through the middest of this chappell runneth a channell called Nastie , and downe that, they scowre all the filth of the bloudstained pauement. These men doe neuer goe, but runne altogether, and generally you shall not misse to take them all on a sweat. But there are two strange things, and worthy obseruation in this countrie, the first is, you shall not finde one man in this whole region, but hee is either lame in body, or deformed in face: which the more scarres that it beares, the more beauty it is held to adde vnto the bearer: and the second is, that a man of three score yeares old, is here held for a miracle. For it is more then extraordinary for any of them to attaine to the middle age of man, they are flesht so young. Neere to the heart of the countrie is a fenne called Full-gall , as large and as famous as euer was the ancient Meotis , now called (d)    [   (g) Ortel. or Mar della Tana: Bellonius saith the Italians , call it Mar Bianco , in Scythia it is called Carpatue , as Tzetzi saith.   ] Mar delle Sabacche : The water of it is of a deepe yellow to the eye, and most bitter to the taste: it ouerfloweth the bounds very often (but at no sett times) and some-times drownes the most part of Cholerikoye : that which it doth drowne, the sulphurous nature of the water doth burne, as Phaetons ill- guided waggon did the whole world: and at these times do all the inhabitants bottle vp this water, imagining that being drunke it annimateth their spirits vnto the most dangerous attempts. But here I would not haue my reader too credulous, for I haue this but by hearesay, by my faith sir I durst not goe to see if it were true or no, I rememberd that French-mans saying too wel, Il faut menager la vie . This part of Fooliana was too dangerous a region for me to trauell: I staid at mine ease in Blockes-ford , and held it better to take this relation vpon credence; then to confirme it with mine owne experience. the rest: the inhabitants of it affirme themselues to haue been created in this country, before any other part of the world was peopled: so that is held the (a)    [  (a) Had not our first parents beene fooles, it had not beene so: but now it is ] mother of all nations, as Blocks-ford is of citties. It lieth in the very middest of all the rest, as the nauell of this goodly body. On the South it hath Fooliana the craggy : on the East, the Fickle : on the West, the Deuoute: and on the North, the Fatt . The south part of it is called Cocks-combaya , peopled with slouthfull  & flegmatique inhabitants; but the northern part therof is possessed by more industrious and actiue spirits. Had I not beheld the strange behauiours of this stupid sort of people with mine eyes, I should neuer haue beleeued that nature had bestowed so diuine a gift as reason vpon such brutish creatures. For all those that border vpon Fooliana the craggie , goe directly like beasts vpon all foure, nor doe they know (silly things) any other way of going. There is no house in all this part of the country: because the inhabitants neither can build any them-selues, nor dare aduenture to come into any that are built by others, least they should fall vpon their heads. There are euery yeare great multitudes of them starued, and stormed to death, in that they can neither make ready their meate, nor frame themselues apparell, nor beds: nay they can scarcely speake true sence: not a man of them that knowes his owne father, nor his owne sonne, nor wife: nor how to returne the same way he came: nor how to distinguish a Beare from a Sheepe, or a Lion from a whelpe. Nay you haue of them that canot tel whether they should put their meate in at their mouth, at the nosthrils, at their eares, or at some other more vnseasonable hold. finally, to be briefe, imagine but that you saw a Cumane Asse in an humaine shape, and such an one is a true Cockscombayan . sexes in England here, Essex, Middlesex & Sussex .   ] the Northerne part of Fooliana the fond, is some-what better furnished with wit, and worthier of a trauellers presence and obseruation. The people hold themselues wonderful wise, and professe the search of natures most abstruse effects: neuer leauing till they haue drawne one reason or other, from the very depth of inuestigation. They haue but one eye a peece: They are not borne so, but the parents at the childs birth plucks out the other, as being of no vse in nature, in that when the one eye is shut, the other hath a more strong facultie to discerne. Part of this nation go all naked, to auoid the labour of putting on  & off: part of them haue houses, but with out either dores or walls, yt the fresh aire may haue the freer accesse: part of them build nests like birds in the highest trees, both to bee nearer heauen, and for their bodies exercise in climing vp to them; euery particular man of them hath both his peculiar opinion and profession. Ambition & desire of glory draweth diuerse of them into most strange & incredible actions: you shall haue some going vp & down the streets on their heads & hands; & others flying about with wings made of wax & fethers, you would verily imagine that (b)   [   (b) The two winged brethren sonnes vnto Boreas : they ridd Phineus of the Harpyes.   ] Zetus and Calain were come againe from the dead, if you but beheld how boldly these fellowes dare trust their wings with their necks. Others, like your Italian Mount-bankes , draw the people together to see ye effects of some rare vnguento , distilled water, or some strange engine: others, out of the basest of mettals, by a secret art (and that by S  t . Patrike a gainfull one too) can draw the purest gold. But in faith it is worth the laughing at, to see the toylesome follie of these extractors: they are guld, and guld and terrible guld yet can they not finde in their hearts to giue ouer. A sort of them of late (as I was informed) would needes to the Oracle, to know the euent of that weighty businesse they had in hand. The Oracle presently gaue the this answere (c)    [   (c) Libauius sets downe this rime of Alchimy Alchymia est ars sine arte Cuius scire est parscum parte, medium est strenue mentiri.

Pho, home come they as if they had gotten their God in a boxe: and forward they goe with their circulations, their sublimations, their coniunctions, their fermentations, till all this head-lesse action ended in putrefaction, vntill reputation and reuenues were both dead and rotten.

Sect. 3\. of good antiquity, and well contriued: but it affordes no rarityes, and therefore I leaue it and passe on to Bable-dock , a corporation most worthely famous for the wisedome of the Aldermen. These men a little before my arriuall, held a sitting vpon this occasion. They skie was verie cloudy, and raine was generallie feared on all sides: the Maior calls a bensh, and fell to consultation, how to dispell the feared shower. The first mans aduise was to ring out all the bells of the towne: another aduised them to burne stinking sauour in the open streetes (as the Italian women doe to driue away tempests): At length, the grauest Foolianders opinion was demanded, who arising, told them in plaine tearmes, their policy was vn-auaylable, and that the onelie quirke to fetch ouer this peremptoric storme, was to suffer all the moisture to fall that those bigge faced cloudes contained, and by that meanes (and by no other) the tempest would bee so braue (seeming to haue no resistance) that as Hanniball did at Capua , it would ruine it selfe or euer it were aware: was this an idle plotte? no beleeue it: the whole bensh liked it and allowed it. Twitlecome twattes , wisdome is not sworne to sitte in Europe onlie. [   The Author had this description from an experienced Geographer, or Fooliander .   ] The very Venus , the eye, the lustre of all Citties terrestriall, is here seated: Ciuitas Angelorum ? Why tis a verie Peticoate Lane , a Pease-market hill to it: The name of it is Blocks-foorde : for site, it standeth partlie vpon a plashie plaine, and part vpon a little mountaine: both of them lying in the descent, Northward: farre from any wood, or any riuer. The vpper part of the towne serues the lower with snow water, and the lower doth the like for the vpper with spring water, mary that is of Iohn a Cragges standing. There are in the whole circumference of the walles iust sixeteene gates, wherein (according to the intent of the founders) it exceedes all citties of the world, by foure. The geometricall forme therof is neither circular, nor ouall, but of a meane proportion betweene a Cylinder,   [  Spell the meaning. ] and a renuersed Pyramide, iust like vnto the portraiture of a mans body. What now? are your vnderstandings vn-aquainted with such a geometrical draught as this? why then you are but Scioccoes ,  & neuer saw Belgia in the forme of a Lyon, Italy of a leg, Morea , of a plaine tree leafe, Spaine , of an Oxe-hide, the West Indies , of a fishes lunges, nor all Europe in the shape of an Empresse. Hee that hath seene these, and shal but view this towne (as he cannot lightly choose) must needs avow directly, that he beholds the lineaments either of some Colossus , laid all along, or else of Prometheus , as hee lieth bound vpon mount (a)    [   (a) So doth Theuet call Caucasus .   ] Adazar . The market place is on the hills toppe: for that it is the head of the citty, and so administers life and sence to the residue. But (honest Reader) if thou consider but the toyle that the poore porters endure by both horse and foote, whilest they lugge vppe all necessaries, euen hogs-heads of beare and wine against the steepe descent of the hil: Vpon mine honest word know not whether I should bidde thee laugh or lie downe: thou woldest sweare thou wert in hell, and saw an hundred Sisiphi at once, rowling so many restlesse stones. And when they are gotten halfe vp the hill (nay by Saint Loye sir, perhaps almost to the top) with halfe an hogs-head of sweate vpon their quarters: then (beshrew that then, may they say) down comes another barrel, which hauing ye vpper ground, holds it selfe the better man, and laies all the poore mens labour in the durt, and that not without endaungering themselues. On this mountaines toppe, the Magnificoes , and the whole Signioria of the Cittie haue their habitations, to the end that the whole towne may lie as a fitter obiect to their prospect: this, as I sayd, resembleth the head of the towne: down from thence you descend a narrow which resembles the neck of this head, and this is inhabited onely with Serieants, Beadles, Deputy-constables, and (b)    [  (b) Hangmen, and other executioners. ] Derick-iastroes . From the lower end of this street, do two other extend themselues on either side, expressing the armes and hands in mans bodie, and these are peopled (but slenderly God hee knowes) with handicrafts men, but not ouer many handicraftes maisters. The bulke of this fabrike lies in a broader streete, and here you haue all your Innes, Alehouses, Tauernes and Hosterians whatsoeuer, and these haue houses downe to the very loynes, where (as mine author affirmes, but I was neuer so farre in the towne) they keepe the Burdello .

The Magnificoes build their houses of a statelie forme, and a loftie: to bee thereby the nearer to the skie, and the more eleuate from this vnrefined garbe of terrestrial conuersation.

Euery one gaue vp his opinion, according to that which seemed to him most commodious. One would aduise them to cut a conuenient hauen through the mountaines (though it were some fiue hundred miles from the sea, a matter of small charge you know) for shippes to traffique to the towne by: he wanted no store of examples from other cities, whose glory stoode wholy vpon the ritches they reaped by the sea. A second presently rises, and clearing his fore-head from surrowes, confutes all that euer the former had affirmed, shewing withall, how dangerous a thing it was to repose any confidence in such an inconstant and vnsatiate element: nor wanted hee examples at full, of citties that lay buried in the seas deuouring wombe. Well, vp rises a third: and hee would haue the rarest conduites made that euer were deuised, and bring the water vp in pipes from the valley to the hills toppe; a thing as possible, as could be thought vpon, seeing that euery man seeth the water in fountaines to bubble vp voluntarily, and striue vpwards of the owne accord, and wanting meanes to containe it to ouerflow the whole plaine about it: and againe, when the water runnes downe the kennell, doe yee plainely, that one part driues another forward? as plaine as day. Well, for all that, this will not fadge with the fancies of the bensh. Speake another: one doth so: and his speech tends to the raysing of an high mountaine about the cittie, for these subsequent vses. First that the whole world might not haue notice of the actions of the Blocks-fordians , especially of the Grandunsonioes . Second, that the cittie therby might be more augmented and fortified. Third that there might be better auoidance of cold, by the warme seating of the Citty within so high a mount: and for the mount it selfe, those that dwelt below should digge it out of the valley, and lay it togither. And then should there be a- bridge built from that vnto the next mount, by which the citty should bee furnished with necessaries. But then steps vp another, and smiling, asked how it were possible that a valley should bring forth a mountaine, but to allow a possibility of that, to suffer a bridge to be built were meere indiscretion: for if a carriage, or a traueller should stumble or loose foote-hold thereon, there were no way in the world for you but death, yea and that (which is worse) with the breaking of a legge or an arme: no, as for my small experience in state affaires (quoth hee) I would rather aduise thus (graue Grandunsonians ) to enterprise a matter which to effect is not laborious, and yet being effected, shall prooue most glorious: so that beeing propounded, I know that the well- willers of the state cannot choose but approue it: and thus it is. Euery man according to his ability and the size of his house, shall erect a spire vpon the toppe thereof, and vpon the toppe, of that, shall aduance a Cock (vulgarlie tearmed a weather-cocke) of brasse, or siluer, with a combe of gould, or Gold-smiths worke: and this shall bee mooueable, to follow and expresse the changes of the winde: Now in euery spire I would haue a clocke to strike hourelie: which beeing once fully performed, O what pathetique spirit can expresse the reduplicate delight shall from hence redound both to the eye and the eare: to see such a bright fulgor of loftie spires, and to heare such a sweete clangor of harmonious bells. He had not shut his mouth, before the whole house opens, in acclamation to his proiect, so grauely, and statesman-like propounded: And so they rose, to see it performed according to the intent of such a ponderous aduise: So that hee that shall in his trauell hereafter, arriue at this Cittie, shall finde it in farre more gorgeous estate then it was my happe to behold it in, let him assure him selfe of that, for I sawe some of the broaches raysed ere I departed.

The inhabitants are the only spenders vnder the moone: they do nothing in the word, but inuent how to spend with the best garbe: Some vpon dogges, some vpon haukes, or kites for a need: some vpon a paire of Iuorye Cubes , or a bunsh of speckled past-boards, and thus flie their patrimonies: and when all is gone but the cloathes, farewell they also, the dise or the brokers are their ordinary cope-men; alas poore Gentlemen, what's a man but his pleasure? But whether this Marquisate belong to Fooliana the Fond or the Fatte , that I cannot resolue yee in, whosoeuer ought it of yore, at this day I am sure it is not in the hands of the olde maisters; It may bee there haue beene some Lawiers, or some Vsurers in this Country in times past, but now farewell they. When these new inhabitants haue cast all their whole estate ouer-boord, then they doe either retire vnto other mens tables; or else are maintained at the publike charge.

Those of this countrie that haue any sonnes, assigne them their full patrimonie ere nature allow them any bearde: and in case they die before this time, they leaue all their estate vnto their wiues to dispose as they list afterwards, without any respect of progenie: But if they haue the fortune to burie their wiues, then doe they lauish out more vpon their funeralls, then would serue for a dowrie vnto the fowlest of their daughters. called (a)    [  (a) Or flatteritania ] Clawback-ourt , peopled with the strangest monsters that euer man beheld: They beare euery one, (b)    [  (b) none hood. ] two faces, and speake with two tongues: carrying the shapes of (c)   [  (c) To sooth, and to back-bite. ] Apes vpon their formost partes, and all behinde of Dogges: so that they seeme to bee a confused composition of Man, Ape, and Dogge. That there are such monsters, let reuerend Munster serue as a testimonie, who describeth certaine Indian people that are partly thus formed. This Nation, it seemes, is borne to seruitude: the greatest part of them doe make themselues voluntarie slaues vnto the Magnificoes of Fooliana the fatte , which borders vpon their countrie. And albeit they bee so sottish, that of their owne heads they can enterprise nothing praise-worthie: Yet can they imitate, and counterfeite any action they see done before them, the world has not the like, for forging such exact resemblances. They neuer weare attire, neuer speake word, neuer doe deed, but they see or heare the like before they goe about it. Whilest, I was there, they halted all vpod one legge; and went spitting and spawling all the daie longe, because that Signior Tickle-eare , their gouernor, of late had hurt his foote, and with all, was troubled with an olde pockie Catarrhe.

They acknowledge no God but the man whom they make choise to serue, and him they obserue with more prayers, sacrifices and adorations then any Idol would exact. Now all this they do with one of their mouthes onely: marry there is not a word comes out of this mouth, but the other, (their dogges mouth) doth forth-with secretly retract, and disclaime. And thus much for their conditions. The first Cittie in this Region, is called (d)   [  (d) In English it is Praise-all. ] Tutto-lodante of faire and sight affecting structure: but so slightlye built, that there is no hope it should continue: it is much enriched by the trafficke which it hath by the meanes of the riuer of Fiction , and againe, verye much endamaged by the same riuer, through often and seuerall inundations. Neere vnto this towne standeth a village, called Tongue-walke , the inhabitants whereof are neuer well but when they are talking. This village stands at the foote of a mountaine that rises along as farre as Tickling- streete , another famous borough, where the townes-men keepe themselues continually employed in chasing of laughters. Close vnto this, lyeth that pleasant valley called Soothing-dale , at the farther end whereof there is a Marish, called Scoffe-stowe Fenne , which reacheth downe along as farre as Shame-stead , a towne of infamous note: whether they vse to bannish all their Wizards, and all those whome they call (c)    [  (c) Bashfull modestie is a foe to flattery ] Bashfull-apians . of this Southerne continent, exceeds them all: and were it as wealthy as it maketh shew of, I make a great question whether the whole Northren worlde could finde a countrey to parallell it: but indeede the people thereof doe generallye faigne to haue what they haue not, and to amplifie by their braues that which they haue indeed. There is a double ledge of Mountaines extended some sixtie Germaine miles in length on either side, betweene which lieth a plaine, full as iong, and this is Fooliana the fatte : through which, the riuer of Sound , a goodly current, hath his course, almost encircling the whole plaine. The reader may soone conceiue what a goodly ranke of Cities are seated on the Mountaines sides, hauing the prospect ouer such a fertile plaine, so delicately watred and diuided into such a many cantons, all fraught with fatte pastures, and spacious champians. The neatnesse of the Cities in this tracte, excells their number; yet are they but of a slender manner of building,  & though their outward formes promise all decorum , yet when you are within you shall not finde ouer-much good order. At the mouth of the passage through the Rhodomantadian Mountaines standeth the Citie Hydalgo , otherwise called (a)    [   (a) Like Madrit in Spaine .   ] Braggadrill : proudly built, but beggerly stated: and neare vnto this, is Back-bitembourg , a towne that may be mother to the dirty streetes of Paris . By this towne is a Rock of incredible height, (and of as incredible note) called Break-neck cliffe : not much different from the Peakes crag in England . It is as broad at the top as at the bottome: and yet so steepe, that it beareth the forme rather of a towre built by mans hand, then any meere worke of nature. And this Rocke is as famous for a place of execution here, as euer the Tarpeian cliffe was in Rome . On the other side of this famous hill, hath the Cittie of Bawdesden hir seate: this towne hath beene oftener on fire then euer was olde Rome : partly through the negligence of the Citizens, and partly through the aptnesse to take fire, that is in the Bitumen , which they vse in their buildings in steed of Lime. Adioyning vnto this is another Cittie called Punkes-nest , built all of Flint, and the hardest Cement that can be deuised. And then a little further in, towards the frontires of Idle-bergh , lie those large mountaines, commonly called Hollyday-Hills , where the people keepe continuall reuells, and sitt in Iudgement vpon such as obserue any working-dayes: two citties there are vpon these hills, Gamesware and Merry-cum-twang : and on the East side of these two, the riuer of Sound falls into the riuer of Idle , making three or foure Ilands, Skip- free Iles the Inhabitants called them where the peoples continuall exercise is in dancing vnto the sound of musicall instruments. Sect. 2\. Gentleman borne: and most of them are able to shew a pedegree of ten thousand yeares long before euer the world was created. You shall haue them shew yee large galleries all drawne with their lineall and colaterall descents, and yet when all comes to all, their neighbours are able to prooue, that they had Coblers, carters, or coster-mongers to their Grand-fathers. Nor is there any of their more select Gentilitie, but hath his countrie Farmes, three or foure, leased ont vnto his Viliacoes , his retainers, and those are commonly Clawback-courtiers . The (a)    [   (a) Quasi senza lode , vnworthy of praise.   ] Sennaladij , their best sort of Gentlemen, doe content them-selues with the poorest fare that euer attended a fasting day: yet some of them perhaps at the yeares end, will make a feast, which for excesse of preparation, and multitude of guests, will giue an end to the bidders whole reuenues: but all the yeare after hee will so defraude his barking stomacke, that many of them (I assure you it is true,) doe destroye themselues through meere hunger. Others of them lett the guttes grone neuer so lowde, neuer respect the belly, but clappe all they can scrape vppon the backe: yet will they neyther acknowledge nor confesse their defect of belly-timber, but quite contrary, wheresoeuer you meete them about dinner time, you shall haue them go brushing of their beards, and picking of their teeth, as if they were newly come from the death of an whole deluge of seuerall dishes. There is none of them hath so much either money or land, as his cloake and sword would purchase: nor any of them that keepes not aboue an hundred (b)    [   (b) Mange-guadagnos : so the Italians cal their seruants   ] Munch-gaines , (for so they call their seruants) yet haue they nothing in the world but they pay interest for it (no man will lend them a quatrine vpon their credites) in so much that I haue knowne diuerse of them hire their apparrell at the Brokeria , onely for foure and twenty houres. Nay I knew one of them build his horse a stable fitter for a Kings horse then his: adorning it with farre-fetched Marble, nay and enchasing the walls and pillers with Iuory, and he himselfe meane while satte warming of his heeles in a poore little, straw- thatched cottage. They giue themselues (c)    [   (c) As he did who demanding lodging at a meane Inne, and being asked what hee was: Our name quoth he is Hernando Gonzales Ribadencira de Toledo .

Estridge fethers are deare with them, as Rushian furres are with vs. Some of them vse to hang siluer bells at their heeles, by the noyse whereof they may attract the peoples eyes vppon their gracefull carriage as they passe the streetes. Those few of them that cannot deny their births to be base, are neuerthelesse of as haughtie spirits as the rest. I remember I read this distich ouer one of their dores.  Misero quello, chi di persona vile, Nasce di cor magnanimo e gentile! O wretched he, that hauing had his birth From a braue spirit, basely affecteth earth! One thing I maruelled at aboue all the rest, as I lawfully might: There are few of this nation that liue by meate, or by drinke, but altogether vpon the fume of a certaine herbe; which they take in smoake at their mouths, and giue it out at their noses, resembling the fumes of so many Brewers chimneys. I know not certainly whether they had this from the Indians , or the Indians from them. It is reported, that one Rollo Warallador , an vngodly fellow of this country (though one of good place) was taught the inuention of this wicked vapour by an Indian deuill: yet some affirme that the Indians of the Torrid Zone inuented the same to make themselues black within disliking vtterly to haue their inner parts of one colour, and their outward of another. But this I am sure of once, that though it fill the nostrils, it empties the coffers, or that many good patrimonies haue by this meanes gone in snuffe out of their owners noses: that smoakt so long in fume, till all the fatte was in the fire, and all the fire out of the Kitchin. In all the Cities, especially in Baudesden and Punkes-nest , euery other house keepes sale Trugges or Ganymedes , all which pay a yearly stipend for the licence they haue to trade. It is very lawfull to deale with these vpon any conditions you can make with them; it is no shame for a man to salute his Cockatrice , (I and to do more too, to kisse her) in the very market place, yea euen before his wife; nay you shall haue some of them will make their wiues obserue their humors with all seruiceable attendance. Sect. 3\. rare and stupendious a monument, as is the Paradise of Fooliana the fatte : a worke worthy all admiration, it is worthy both the toile  & the cost of all trauellers, but once to behold it. You shall a farre of, behold a shining mountaine, all of pure gold (for so it is, or so it seemes, and thats as good) framed (as it is reported) in old time by arte Chymicall : yet if any one come to trie the goodnesse of the mettall by instrument, it falles all into dust; if by fire it ascends all in smoake. On the top of this mountaine there standeth a castle all of Christall; not wrought by any arte of humane power, say the inhabitants: but the Goddesse (a)    [   (a) Fortuna fauet fatuis , is not so old as true. ] Fortune , being (vpon some distast giuen vnto the court of the gods) banished from heauen, set vp her rest here, and built this as a second, and terrestriall heauen. And from hence shee spreads her goodnesse through the world: here shee sitts giuing all aboundance that the most credulous seruant she hath, can possibly expect: nay be his expectation constant, he cannot choose but obtaine it. Hether doe men and women flock, from all the nations of the earth, but especially from Fooliana the Deuoute : there is not one (almost) high or lowe, in the whole world, but hath seene this mount and ascended it. Men talke of Our Lady of Loretto, Saint Iames of Compostella, our Lady of Walsingham, Hall , and Sichem , they are desert and desolate places in respect of this: here the pilgrims lye prostrate in the valley, in deuoute expectation of the Goddesses call, as thick as euer haile-stones lay in high wayes after a frostie storme: nor may any man liuing approach the ascent of the hill, vntill such time as the priests of the castle do hang out the white banner,  & that is a signe that the Goddesse is pleased they shall ascend: and then they crie all with one voice, making the skies rebound againe, (b)   [   (b) The Italians crie to, vnuailing of the picture of our Lady of Loretto .   ] Madona Scoperta , and then run that run may, one ouer another, euery one crying out of the straightnesse of the passage vp. Nor will the worst man there giue place to the best, so that some-times you shall haue them scold one with another, like so many inhabitants of Ram-Alley : and some-times to it by th'eares, with dry blowes, euery one in the company thrusting on him that is before him,  & flouting them that are behind. Heere did I see certaine of them that durst not venter vpon the crowd, growne euen hoarie with expectation, and yet had not meanes to get vp the hill. But what doe they that get vp? faith, desire to haue, called them together, & hope hold, them together, each one praying that it would bee the Goddesses pleasure to grant him his desires. You shall haue one praying for the attainment of his way-ward loue: another, only that it would please Fortune to send him a wife that were no shrew: a third for honors,  & a fourth for ritches, euery man as hee likes and there yee shall haue twenty praying for vnckles deaths, & as many for the burial of thus many church men, that he may passe from reuersion to possession of this or that fatte benefice. There sat one king-like fellow at the gate & he (they said) sued for the next monarchy: & by him sat a crue of ill faced wenches, & their suite was for beauty: there was an old wife also, with as many oake trees in her mouth as teeth, & she expected to be restored to her youth againe & a many more sutors (you must thinke) then I could take note of. Now the signe of admission being giuen (as I said) vp the hill go all that can go, not on their feete (for that were sacriledge) but vpo hands and knees, & with great reuerece I warrant ye. Being gotten to the midway, one of the priest intertains them courteously & inquires euery particular mans name and country, which when he heareth, he proclaimeth it with as lowd a voice as euer had (a)   [   (a) A fellow in Homer that had a voice a lowd as fiftie mens.   ] Stentor , partly to giue notice vnto his fellowes, and the Goddesse her selfe, what guests were arriued,  & partly by this means inquiring ye deity of them, to know ere they come any neerer, whether they come with the faith and purity which is required: for if you come guilty of any heauy crimes, shee hangs out her red banner, in signe that you must be remoued into the cloisters, where he must be kept til he be able to salute her with a purer soule and passe the residue of the iourney with a lighter purse. But if the goddesse like you at first, the Priest giues you a leaden token, & so lets you passe: mary withall hee speakes these 3. words in your eare ere you passe; Beleeue, Expect and Hope : and so God buoy. On go you as cheerfull as a Pie, vntill you come at an Iron threshold, a little below the steps that ascend to the Castle gate: vpon which Iron this distich is written: [   Sannazer.  ] Fortunam si auide vorare pergas, Illam vt male concoquis necesse est. Who swalloweth Fortune ere he chew it, Through, ill disgestion needs must rew it. The Castle gates are kept by a rigorous porter: yet money will make him do any thing: the entrie is so narrow, that it seemes to be rather an hole then a gate: but after you are crept once in, then shal you see an house more like an heauenly habitation then an earthly. All pearle & gold, whose lustre dazels the eie to looke vpon it, and whose external view promiseth no lesse then the height of happinesse, I omit to speake of the forme of the temple, the priests habits, orders & offiees: these, for breuitles sake, I wittingly ouer-passe. At length when you haue viewd all (for you must needs bestow a little time to gaze vpon this pile of admiration) comes another of the Flamines to you, and taking you by the hand (hauing first blind-folded you with a linne cloth) he leads you through a hudred turnings, indeed whether hee lists, but as fond me beleeue, into the temple of this good Goddesse, whom mortall eyes must not behold, and therefore are you muffled. Well, now you must coutch, and kisse the sacred pauement: and lie so without once moouing, vntill the Goddesse call you by your name, and, then aske boldly what you list: doe but effect what she commands without delay, or distrust, and were your request neuer so hard, it should bee fulfilled. Well, but what end of all this ceremonies obseruation, say you? By my troth a ridiculous one, able to mooue the gentlest spleene aliue. They are all singularlie, and ingeniously non-icatcht, men and women, rarely fetcht ouer, and with arts Quintessence: and yet for all that, this art is so secret, that though no man passe this triall, that is not made an Asse, yet euery one had rather blame his owne slothfulnesse or incredulity, then once glance at any imperfection in the power of the Goddesse. Well, hauing propounded your petition, (suppose it bee honour) the Goddesse assents to it, most gratiouslie, commanding the suppliant, first after some houres, to take the holie potion, whereby his spirit may bee the better adopted vnto the ensuing felicity: and then, to lay him downe againe vntill shee called him the second time: which if hee doe but duelie obserue, hee shall assuredly be crowned with his full wishes, to continue enstalled in happinesse for euer: and to haue euer the same cause to bee gratefull vnto the Goddesse for her heauenly beneficence. It passeth; the suppliant taketh the cuppe and drinkes it off: praysing to his owne thoughts the drinkes delicious taste, beeing vtterlie ignorant that it is onelie a potion made of poppie, opium , lettuce, and other such procurers of sleepe: but the effect is the triall; hee has not beene an houre after hee hath taken it, but downe lies hee in a sleepe, yee may turne the house out at the windowe, (if yee can) and neuer awake him: and then is hee haled vppe and downe the pallace like a dead carcasse by the buriers, and when they haue laught at him till they bee a wearie, they lay him in a ritch bedde, in a Chamber like a Kings, all seeled with Iuory, and arched with golden pillers, all the Tables spread with couerings, the Arras of Campania , and the Tapistrie of Alexandria are but sacke-cloath to them. And about the doore standes a companie of attendants, each in his gold-chaine at least, and all courtier-like accoutred, expecting when this (b)    [  (b) The Minion of the Moone. he slept 40. years together ere euer hee awaked. ] Endymion iunior will awake, (which is commonlie some three daies after,) who lifting vppe his head, beeholdes all the roome with amazement, (as hee well may) and seeing all this faire companie of shining attendance, is wholie transformed with wonders: Whilest they in the meanetime approach all in order with a ceremonious reuerence to salute the awaked King: Health and happie daies to thy Sacred Maiestie, great King. King thinks hee? masse this is braue. What apparell will it please your Maiestie to weare to day? your sute of Golds-miths worke, your suite of tissue embrodered with Rubies, your cloth of gold doublet with the Carbuncle buttons or your Pearle poudred cassock? tissues, Rubies, Carbuncles, cassockes? Heyda! my man's an Endymion indeede now, and will not change states with the man in the moone, he, for al his fulgid throne he sittes in. Well, ritch cloathes are brought him indeede, euery man helps this braue King, and as one saies.  Dant digitis geamas, daat longe monilia collo: His hads with sparkling gems they deck And hang ritch chaines about his neck. Set a diademe vpon his head adorned with Pearles of incredible greatnesse and lustree. All this goes well still, thinkes hee to himselfe (c)   [  (c) 'Tis time poore king, for thou hast eaten no meate this three daies. ] Get dinner readie. So sayd, so done: dinner was prepared, and serued vp, all in state, such raritie of seruices, such braue attendants such mirth and such melodie! Pho, nineteene muses cannot giue a man words to describe it. And thus they spend the whole daie as time, yee know, will passe. Still my fine King thinkes all his owne, still. Well, night comes, vp with supper, and vp supper comes, with as ritch, nay ritcher purueyance & attendance then waited on the dinner: and for a conclusion to the feast, my maiesticall King has the tother draught giuen him of the holy potion, which presently locks vppe his sences in sleepe as profound as the former: And then my poore twelue-houres King, beeing as Virgill saies  Iam simul expletus dapibus, vinoque, sepultus, Gorgd with good cheere and wrapt in sleepy wine. Is caried out at a posterne, stript out of his tissues, his Rubies, and al his Gold-smiths worke, and re-invested in his old cloathes, (made somewhat more sluttish then they were before) and so laid out in the high way, for passengers to gaze vpon: where when hee awakes, hee falls into as great amazement as before; and remembring how glorious a blisse hee was enthroned in but yesterdaie, and finding himselfe now vtterlie depriued of all, (d)   [   (d) Heu quo decidimus .   ] hee falles a lamenting most extreamelie, miserablie deploring, and bitterlie cursing either his owne sloath, that would not giue eare (as shee had charged him) to the Goddesses second call: or his grosse ingratitude, who being placed in so high a felicity, neglected to pay the good goddesse her due tribute of thankefulnesse. So away goes hee weeping and wayling with this word continually in his mouth, Fuimus, Troes! I was whilome a braue man, And exhorting all men to take example by him, neuer to bee negligent, neuer thankelesse, but to proceede with heed, and confidence, and obey what the goddesse enioyned, and then they could not faile of felicity. Such had I once (saith hee) but now, by mine owne onelie follie, I haue lost it all, euery part and parcell of my former greatnesse. Now euerie one that heareth him, thinkes this; I hope to take better heede then so; and they hood- winck themselues ere euer they come there. Fond , lieth Fooliana the Deuout , a region fertile enough of it selfe, but through the inhabitants negligence, altogither vncultured. For whereas it is diuided into two Prouinces, Trust-fablia , and Sectaryuoa , (the former beeing farre the larger of the two) yet is it so wholie giuen ouer to a sort of rotten Ceremonies, that the Inhabitants thereof are all of this opinion, that one cannot doe God better seruice then in the vtter neglect of themselues. There are good store of pretty Hamblets in this prouince; there is Fragment , surnamed the mouldy, wonders-field , and within a little of them, Crepe-ham high crosse, Cringing-beck ; and kissing-all-vp . The borders of this nation are verie deserts to speake of, and haue scarcelie any inhabitants: some of the villages (for some villages there are, but very few) as Lentestow right-maw, Pilgrimes Inne , and Scourge-nock ; are left almost vtterly desolate, but that they are once a yeare (at a set day) visited by some Venetians , otherwise their thresholds are worne by none but their owne countrimen. And here I may not ommit one memorable worke, erected vpon mount Bagnacauallo ; it is a goodly, well contriued spittle, both for largenesse, and full furniture: it beareth the name of the Hospitall of incurable Foolianders , and was built at the publike charge of the whole countrie, and therevpon is maintained. The Proctor of it, at my beeing there, was one (a) [   (a) Thus was hee borne that wrote the Hospitall of incurable fooles . ] Garzoni , an Italian , a man of good prouidence and discretion, and truelie hee hath desposed the almesmen in passing good methode and in decent order. Hether haue diuers colonies beene sent out of all parts of Fooliana . But for a truth the number of the monasteries in this country, doe very nere exceed the number of the villages: besides, which, there is nothing but scuruy sheddes, worse then any Westphalian Inne: nor is there any freeholder left in all this countrie: the Cloisters haue got vp all the lands euery straw- bredth, to make the deities the better cheere. Foure sorts of buildings did I obserue in this soile: Temples, Monasteries, Hospitalls and Cottages: for all those that are not professed cloysterers, are either slaues or beggers. They are all of one religion, mary they cannot tell of what: but professe ignorance, and neglect inquiry, it is inough for them to follow their fore- fathers, and to hold the places whilom belonging to Saints, that is all they care for. In their pace they make continuall crosses; one thigh comming thwart another at euery step, and so makes the forme of a crosse at euery foote of ground they passe: And so likewise do they cary their armes, folded in cross-like manner, as if they were all in loues Melancholie. They haue goodly Temples, yet downe vpon their knees will they go in the plaine fieldes, if they spy but any antique face vpon a stone, or an old logge, or so: and then their beades (which they beare vpon strings) must needes rattle some two and fiftie times ouer. There is more Gods belongs to this country, then there is men. Varroes nuber of the Romane gods was but halfe an vnite in respect of those. They make them of stone, wood and lome: and some of them augment their deities number, with adoration of horses, hogges, and hounds. Euery daie giues life vnto a new deity: and sometimes yee shall reckon two hundred, made in one Temple vpon one day. And here wee finde the olde Egiptian custome receiued, that men, whilest they liue, are naught set by, but dying, they are entombed in honorable sepulture. 800. pounds haue I seene bestowed at one funerall, and none of the greatest mans neither. In this land will I lay my bones, and I doe here by will and testament, charge mine heires to see me here entombed: and pray that all those that doe either condemne or commend this my description, beyond the desert, bee sent as mourners to accompany my corps to the graue, as likewise all such that shall hereafter bee guilty of immitation thereof. But let vs forward with it. At those obiects, besides the tapers, incenses, bells, and bables that attend the body, as beneficiall vnto the soule; there are two select persons bound by the law to attend the bodie all the way with two blacke silke fannes, to driue away the flies from it, be it in winter when the flies are all dead, and the carcasse not a fart the sweeter, all's one for that, law is law, and must bee allowed. These Foolianders neuer touch any thing, bee it Water, Oyle, salt, Waxe, or Iron, vnlesse it bee first exorcised, and the diuell driuen out of euery corner of it. They hallow guilt roses, with great sollemnity, as they doe also in baptizing of their bells, and ensignes. But here is the rarest miracle that euer nature saw or man heard of. In Wonders-field there is not a stone, but can heare, weepe, laugh, mooue, cure diseases, sweate bloud, and do al that euer was done by the Semones , the D aemones , or al the black guard whatsoeuer. Sect. 2\. much variety, but little delight: Euery village, euery house has his peculiar fashion, quite different from the rest. Nor did I euer see, in all my trauells such a multitude of vnruined monuments, as I saw here. Here was Saturnietta ,  & the seauen Piramides (somewhat ruined) which the citizens of this state built (a)    [   (a) This was the Saturnians opinion.   ] in memory of the 7.

The people choose as many Burguemaisters as they thinke good of: and these must rule, but neither for their yeare; nor their liues, but euen while the people please: If any man of them giue any proofe of somewhat more sound iudgement then the rest, hee is presently put out of office, and banished by Ostracisme. But all these Prouinces do acknowledge one Grand superior,  & doe fealty to one chiefe Prince, whose name when I was in those parts, was Ill-Buffonio Ottimo Massimo . His palace is in Fooliana the Fatte , neere vnto the Deuout , and beares the (a) is as it were a compound of an Emperour and a Priest, wearing a crowne vpon a miter, or a miter in a crowne. There is euer borne before him a key and a sword, the ancient emblemes of Ritches  & Power. His Key sheweth that all the Foolianders coffers are at his command: his sword, that hee may at his owne pleasure both take from others, and defend his owne. All that come into his presence must kisse his foote, by an ancient custome, begun at first by certaine Kings (long agoe) that were troubled with sores and apostemes on their hands. Hee is not borne but chosen to this dignity, yet not before hee bee very olde, least the people should bee a weary of him (as they are wondrous prone to innouation) ere he were a weary of life. Before Saint Sapa's chappell are two seates of Porphiry, wherein hee that is to bee elected must passe a triall of his Rems and his Res , ere he bee installed. Hee seldome rides but vpon mens shoulders, to shew that men in respect of him are but as beasts in respect of men. He sittes alway, and goeth abroad alwayes vnder a canopy: tush, these are things that others may do also as well as he: let vs here some of his singularities, beyond all others you shall. He neuer askes peny tribute of any subiect he hath, but what they giue willingly, he takes thankfully and spends freely. He decrees nothing against the consent of the meanest counsellor in his state. He makes no lawes, nor keepes any: nor doth he promulgate any decree of continuance, but once within two yeares it is quite out of vse. He vseth his seruants, (yea euen his slaues) with much familiaritie, and when hee list can lift them vp aboue the best man in his court. Hee allowes his Parasites to doe euen what themselues thinke good, to breake lawes, to counterfeit coines, or to disperse money stamped with their owne names and faces. I might haue learnt much more matter in this court worthy obseruation, but that I do not loue of all things in the world, to tarry in court longer then needs must: No, I was neuer good courtier, nor (I hope) euer shall be. Finis lib. 3. The description of Theeue-ingen . Of the situation thereof. and Ingenium in Latine.   ] is bounded on the West with the straite of Magellanus , and on the East, with Fooliana the deuout & part of Tenter- belly . It is a soile so vtterly voide of fertility (excepting one little country) that Pluto might rather seeme to haue stolne Ceres daughter fro hence then from Sicily . Nor shepheard, nor husbandman shall yee finde here, would yee seeke your heart out: yet is it not strange that this barren country should neuer-the-lesse haue such aboundance of all necessaries, naye and superfluities also, that it may challenge all the world in a prize of wealth, and (as farre as their naturall fiercenesse permitteth) of delicacy too? Take it from me (quoth Hieremy Ratcliffe ) they may; there is no rariety, nor excellent thing of worth in all the world, but they will haue it, by hooke or by crooke, and if they once get it, yee shall sooner get a fart from a dead man, then fetch it back out of their clouches. The Easterne part is enritched by the spoiles of the two Fooliana's , the Fatte , and the Deuout : the Westerne, by the treasures of India , together with the Spaniards, Caricks and (b)    [   (b) As the Spaniard called one of their great Caricks, which sir Francis Drake tooke.

Assambeg of Alexandria, Barbarossa , Captaine Warde , and Yagup Hemskerk ; tush these were all meere Adalantadoes of Herring-boates, in respect of the Piraticall spirits this climate affords: I say it and I will stand vnto it. The whole countrie is deuided into two Signiories: (c)    [   (c) As there are two species of this trade theeuery and cousinage   ] Robbers-waldt and Liegerdemaine : the first of which butts vpon Fooliana and an angle of Tenter-belly : the latter lyeth more West, and (against all custome of the other Theeuingers, the wandring Robberswalders) keepes it selfe in the owne bounds: but both of them are barbarous and vtterly inhospitable. vsually called Filtching-fennes , wherein there are more Ilands, or full as many, as is in the riuer Rawley of Guiana , made by the turnings of the water. The whole region is so woody and mountainous; that it seemes rather a desart then a place inhabited: and (as Strabo saith of a cittie in the world) is to be held fitter for rebellion then habitation. Their (a)    [ (a) Of this language there is an excellent exact discouerie made in Thomas Deckers Bellman , but in his Lanthorne and Candle-light , he hath outstript all the world for variety of knowledge in Canting.   ] language is very crabbed, I could not possibly learne it; onely I obserued some Welsh words, taught them as it seemes by some ancient trauellers of our Westerne Brittons. This Signiorie is indifferent well peopled, but vnder no forme of rule: each man holds himselfe borne onely for himselfe, and so liueth obeying and respecting himselfe onely. What he can bereaue another of (by any violence whatsoeuer) is forth-with his owne, as good and lawfull prize: and the more powerfull he growes, the more he is feared, and is attended by the more vndersharkers that are his followers: they liue all in certaine families, all which giue due obedience to the father of the houshold and euery one forbeares his own bloud, and robs where he can besides, freely & without controll Both the Fooliana's had by these sharkers bin long since eaten vp, but that the inhabitants are faine to pay yearely a great sum of money, for their protection all the yeare after. This ransome (for a kind of ransome it is) is paid by the principals of Fooliana , vnto the chiefe housholders of Robberswaldt . In bodily shape they are like vnto vs, sauing that all but the Ilanders, haue clawes vpo their hands insteed of nailes: and this is not onely naturall vnto all the Robberswalders , but euen to the Liegerdumanists also. Vpon the mountaines of this soile there breedeth a kinde of people called the Sbanditi , and these are especiall keepers of Booty-forrest (a frith so called) which is of that breadth, that that same High Dutch Hercynian Sherewood , put Schwarrzwaldt, Doenwaldt, Steigerwaldt, Westerwaldt, Bekemerwaldt , waldt quoth you? nay put all the waldts, welts and gards in Europe to it: I tell yee, let one word suffice, they all make but a dayes iourney for an Irish Lowse, (bee shee neuer so speedie) if you measure it with this. No, I will bee as good as my word, and iustifie, that if Hercynia keepe ten thousand theeues (as lightlie it doth alwayes,) Booty-forrest shall keepe a thousand thousand: Baw waw! Hercynia ? why 'tis a blanket for a Catte, a petty Cock-pitte, nay a very Tobacco-boxe in respect of Booty-forrest . In this country, you shall not find any man of state but he keeps a fort: yes verily, all garrison soldiars: neither are their fortresses any way beautifull, but they are most iudiciously contriued, both for defence and purueyance: and here, they that liue within keepe all that they purloyne without (and that is no small prize) maugre the beard of haughtie Zulzemin . No, they are no Shitilecocks! what they haue theile hold, they are in place,  & what's a mans place if hee make no vse of it? Now in the meane while the poore commonalty vntrusse their states and their Port- manuels vnder trees, and lay their noddles close to the stumpe of some ancient Oke; Sic fuit ab initio (quoth the Gentleman to the Chandlers sonne) so did your fore-fathers (my maisters) be you neuer so top-heauie now, and so do these honest lads, these true Tartarians , that neuer keepe one mansion eight and forty houres. But alas! would this were all: but I must needes goe on. These plaine seeming Villiacoes delight in nothing but to lye in waite to make prize of poore passengers, and when they catch them, they strippe them starke naked: they will not leaue them a tatter to serue for a curtaine to the worlds propagatour ; yet will they not murther, as the damned, soulelesse, fiend-bred, hell-borne Italian theeues do,  & those durty, gut-swolne, toad-sprung Germaines , (they haue no cause indeed, for their fact is not lyable to the lawe) but him that they vnhuske, they doe presently binde, and carry in state vnto their Dukes court, vnto whom hee must sweare perpetuall obedience and loyaltie: which if hee breake either in running his countrie, or in omitting to practise Pourloynerie once or twise in a moneth, hee is forthwith condemned to commence at (b)    [  (b) Tiborne was built for him, as some say. ] Doctor Stories cappe: trusted he shall be no more, but once trust vp for all: this law maketh them maruailous mighty: and againe, the Legerdumanists of late enacted this decree, That no yonger brother shall haue any share in the fathers land , and this law hath added a great multitude of voluntaries vnto Robbers-waldt , as cannot but appeare to the politique, and him that can ponder it. The deuout Foolianders (as I said before) loue crosses: well they cannot loue them so much as these hate them. So that though their tribute assure them quiet at home, yet if they bee ouer-taken in Robberswaldt , farewell Fooliander , vp they goe as round as a Iuglers boxe: and the onely cause is, they vse to mock the Robberswalders , by making Iybbets at them with their fingers. The maine housholders are continually at dissention and ciuill warres amongst themselues, about iniurious booties, forced from one another: and by my faith sir, the whole world fares the better by it: for should these rogish improouers once lay their heads together against our world, we might put vp our pipes, the case is be-shitt, and go cast our capps at the Moone, for any state that we should holde long: O sir, vnderstand me, the case is plaine, we were sure of ruine I grant ye that: and so were all that could not stand in defence against them: but the wiser sort of them-selues preuent that, by nousling priuate dissentions at home. It is a great commendation of towardnesse in their children (as (c)   [ (c) De bello Gallico, lib. 6.  ] C aesar said of the Germaines ) to bee cunning filtchers, in their young yeares: for this arte they teach them euen from their infancies, in precepts which they call Hermeticall : ye shall haue the little theeuelings, euen while they suck their mothers brests, to steale needles  & pence from out of their purses: but if they either ouer- shoote themselues, & be taken in the maner, by being either too slowe handed, or too boisterous, vp goes their bums incontinent: Now as they grow to yeares, so must they augment their practise, by stealing of Geese, Ducks, or any such like prouant: nor doth any day passe them wherein they do not increase their stock by one lift or other. If their plot chance to haue any dangerous induction about it, then do they content themselues with (d)   [  (d) As the Welch man stole Rushes, onely to keep his hand in vse. ] stealing a clod from your neighbors land, or a stake from his hedge, least their hands should grow out of vse: this is the ordinary practise of ye borderers of Liegerdumaine : betweene it  & Robberswaldt lieth a large heath called (e) Lyers-buy plaine , of which you shall heare more here-after, when we haue passed the maritimall coasts of Robberswaldt . straite, on the bankes of Theeuingen , and in the Iles of Filtching-fennes . Now they know that no ship that passeth the straite can possibly returne back, the current is so swift, and therefore they stoppe the passage with chaines and shallops, and so make prize of all that should passe: whereby they that goe this voyage, doe seldome or neuer returne, more by reason of the multitude of these Pyrates, then ye strength of the opposed streame. Europe affoords not any sea-man that knowes his bayes, creekes, tides, shelfes, rockes and channells better then these doe generally: besides that they swim as nimbly and as perfectly as the fishes themselues doe. Their chiefe hauen is called (a)    [   (a) Not Dunkirke . ] Kirk-dun , a towne of no great strength, nor compasse: but fraught with as hardie Pirates as Christendome affordes and with as great store of stolne ritches. It is situate in that angle of Robberswaldt that lyeth iust vpon the head of Filtching-fennes , ouer-against a part of Tenter-belly . The shores here abouts, as it is reported, are all ledged with Rocks of the Loade- stone, which drawe the ships vnto these coasts, that are an incredible distance off and heere they hold them. But the Kirk-duners that sayle out into the maine, and fetch in the merchants, they gette the cash. And strange it is to see how many purchases their bolde valour hath borne from strengths some-times trebbling theirs: some ascribe this vnto the Magicall Ensignes they haue from Fooliana , let the reader choose whether hee will beleeue them or no. The Citties armes, is the vulture, that feedes as shee flyes: the word, Fruor nec quiesco : Ritch and yet restlesse : Mantled, Geules; doubled, ermines. A little within the mouth of the riuer Filtching , is there another towne, called Port van Berghen , the Queene and Lady of all those Iles and waters: it taketh tribute of all vessells that passe that way whatsoeuer, they cannot passe ere they paye: and besides, it layeth out great hookes with loade-stones vpon them, where-with it angleth for shipps, iust as wee doe for Pikes, Troutes, and other fishes: and where it once seazeth, there keepeth it sure hold. In these fens, and in this broade riuer, filled all with Iles, you (b) [   (b) No more then the Egiptian Pyrates had in Heliodorus. lib. 1. ] shall not finde one cottage, nor one boate: partly in that the people doe choose rather to make themselues and their families nests in Reeds (which growe heere in a farre larger size then those of India ,) and partly because they are commixt with the Foolianders (lying one so neere another) whereof there is none but had rather swim then sayle: so that they are so perfect in that arte, that like to the Crocodiles , they liue as much in the water as in the land, and mooue as swiftly as the swifted whirry. And of these doe the Nauigators stand more in feare, then of the other Pyrates, by much: for these come suddenly vpon them, and many of them clap to them to the ship at once, stay her as fast as if a Remora stuck to her keele: and then they tumble her with the bottome vpwards and sinke her, or traile her to a rock, and there wrack her. question whether any man (that were wise) would expose himselfe to such a barbarous nations curtesie: well sir I preuented all that. Vnderstand, that the Foolianders (the deuout I meane) and these people hold a Iubylee both together, euery fiftie yeare: during the which yeare, they are at peace with all the world,  & all men are free from feare of the rankest theefe that breathes. At these times doe men come hether from all parts of this continent: yet at their comming they do giue such gifts to the inhabitants, that this one yeares peace is more profitable vnto them, then foure yeares filching. Now it was my chance to light here vpon this very yeare: and so I and my fellow trauellers had the better meanes to take an exact view of the country. Onely we were in some feare of the Harpies , as we trauelled: our gold got no peace at their hands. They are (by my troth I know not what; either fowles or diuels)  & haue kept here (by report) euer since Zethes & Calais chased them out of Europe : they build their nests with strong beames, laying them a thwart ouer the forked armes of huge growne trees: they are faced like owles, backt  & bodied like Estridges, fethered like Porcupines, beakt and pounced like Eagles. Truely they made me remember the birds that (as (a)   [   (a) Aristot. lib. de mirabi. lib.  ] one writeth) do keepe in the Diomed aean Iles, which would fawne vpon vpon the Greekes , and flie at the faces of all men besides: Iust so did the Harpyes vse vs that were stangers; they would not touch an inhabitant, but were as familiar with them as tame Pidgeons; but when any of vs came neere them, they would flie vpon vs like fiends: nor can any man passe Booty Forest , but they teare him all to peeces, vnlesse hee haue a (b)    [   (b) So doe the Turkes cal the from Cayro to Ormus, and the other ports of their traffique.   ] Carauan , of Robberswalders for his conuoie. purlogne, and Baggs-death, two Citties. verges of Robberswaldt and Legerdumayne : beeing (a)    [   (a) As the way by the crosse was in Camden.

I am far mistaken if I saw not here some olde monuments of Pliny , and Herodotus , in this very dale. Mercurius Gallobelgicus , has built himselfe a delicate house in the country: and there is a certaine (c)    [   (c) If he doe meane Baronius hee is not farre amisse, many suppose.   ] Cardinall (an Historian) that hath layd the foundations of a mighty and spacious castle in these quarters. For euer since Spaine got the conquest of those Indies that ioyne vpon this land, the Liegerdumanians haue giuen leaue to the Iesuites (those busy-bauds, that must scald their lips in the whole worlds pottage) to visite, and to inhabite this land, which the Robberswalders irruptions had otherwise vtterly dispeopled. Here are many Astrology schooles, whose professors are more in fauour with the Liegerdumanians , then any other artists whatsoeuer, excepting poets  & lawiers. In this very place, did I (better confesse here then in a worse place) set vp a schoole my selfe, and read the lecture of spying maruells in the heauens vrinall as methodically as any Star-gazer a' the all: I had my Ptolomy , my Guido Bonatus , my Bencorat , my Zahel , my Messahalach , my Albohali , my Hali Aben Razehell , al at an inch: and by their prescriptions wrote (d)    [   (d) Right for this is but a discouery of Mundus altered et idem .   ] an infallible prognostication of these present times. These Liegerdumaynians are far more sociable (at least more circumspect  & secret in their villanies) then the Robberswalders ; for that which these doe in publike, the Leigerdumaynians doe very closely: liuing vnder a law,  & a Prince also, called (as I heard) by the name of Tiberio di Golde-gripi: who keepeth state in Free-purloine , a delicate citty in the very inmost edge of Lyers-burie plaine: they neuer stir abroad on the day time, but effect all their businesse in the night: they hate the sunne and loue the moone, both with ye extreamest of affection.

Tonguestreete is the Rendeuous of all the lawiers, and Cause- mongers: Pawnes-brooke , of the vsurers, brokers, and taylers. And surely there is no nation vnder heauen so stored with lawiers as this is: who (as (f)    [   (f) In P aenulo. ] Plautus saith of one) if they wante meanes of contention, play the seed-men, and sow them themselues. Our Westminster , lay all the Innes of Court, and Chancery to it, is but a very Katherines hall, to the vtter Temple of this streete: and yet, though their number do daily increase, it is held notwithstanding by the best politicians of the land, that they cannot continue. For when they haue lickt vp all the whole country (as they haue almost done already) they must needs lacke clyents, and so for want of emploiment goe to law one with another,  & by that meanes disperse their euill gotten goods amongst the comunalty againe, to leaue their posterity the means of more gainefull trading. The lawiers men are all suted in (g)   [  (g) As the vniuersity show makers do vsually sute their parasites. ] party coloured liueries; to signifie that their maisters are ready to take fees on either side.

But here is a strange worke of nature: their skinnes doe naturally attract gold and siluer, with as powrefull a strength, as the loadestone draweth steele, and holds it as fast: a thing that was neuer seene elsewhere, and therefore the worthier of record. Pawnes-brooke is peopled with all sorts of artificers: Yet they open no shops: but euery one attends the passengers at his owne dore with what lack yee Gentlemen ,  & then if he get a chapman, hee leads him in, and shewes him his wares in priuate.

When they are tript, they are punished with al seuerity: but they haue this preuention for that: they can change their shapes, voices, trades & habits, vpo an instant, so cunningly, that he doth but wash an Ethiop that seeketh for him to day that couzend him yesterday.

I found also many of Virgils vpon another stone, which the inhabitants said he had hought of by ye knees out of Homer and Hesiod . Here were also some of Petrarchs , nimd from another (d)    [   (d) Dante , or messier Cino , or Senuecio , or some of those times.   ] Tuscane Poet: and many other such like monuments. On the South part, lieth (e)    [  (e) It is inhabited with none but Pursuiuants, and Benefice-barterers. ] Rapineux , a plaine all full of rubbish and ruines, which shew that there hath beene many cities there: but they were all pulled down long ago, to build those two magnificent piles, Penny-patron , and Chaffer-kirke : so that you shall see in this country, many old Churches turned into stables, streetes into pastures, and steeples into priuies. Besides this, the riuer Fraude doth continually teare away one peece or other from this part of the country, and laieth it either on the marshes of Lurtch-wit , or (f)    [   (f) Otherwise called, Neuer-enough .   ] Stille-more . pictured in Munster and Maundeuill , with heads like hogges. They go alwaies vpon their hands and knees, least they should otherwise misse any thing as they passe along the streetes, that were worth the taking vp. Their voice is a kinde of grunting, nor haue they other speach. None may dwell amongst them, but (a)    [   (a) Couetice is called the old mans euill. ] old folkes. Their youth they doe spend in Booty-forrest (if they be valiant) or else in Bags-death Schooles: the inhabitants are all husbandmen, marchants, and mettall-mongers. They do eat earth (as (b)    [   (b) Gesner de Quadruped.  ] the Wolfe doth when hee is to go to fight) almost continually: yet some there are that eate nothing at all; but liue vpon the sight onely of gold and siluer. They neuer sleepe but with their eyes open; herein onely (c)   [   (c) Idem ibid.  ] resembling the Lyon. They serue a God whom they call Quadagno , with al superstitious reuerece: they neuer goe to their rest but when they haue seene him: nor doe they eate but in his presence. Touching the citties of this Prouince, there is Swine borow , a filthy towne, a very stincking heape: but then is there Gatherington (d)    [ (d) Ritcher then Amsterdam for all that it is called the Low-countries store-house.   ] Hoord sterdam , and Lockadolid , all handsomly built things, marry I could not come to view them within: by reason that euery particular citizen in all these places hath a priuate key for the gates, to lock at his going in  & out, so that by this meanes they preuent all strangers accesse. The residue of this nation liue more like swine then men, in the Ilands of Hoggs-bourg and the Scrapiglias . These men, townes, and manners, did I behold, admire, and laugh at: and after 30. yeares trauell, growing weary of wandring, I returned into my natiue country.
