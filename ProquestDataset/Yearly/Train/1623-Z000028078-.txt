 and reuerence their interiour qualities, and ornaments, Pietie, Fidelitie, Generosity , (three Daughters of Heauen , embleming and personating the three Heauenly Graces on Earth, Faith, Hope, Charitie ) who transport and conuey our Memories as farre as the limmits of Time , and a degree beyond it, and (on the wings of Truth ) mount our Fames from Earth to Heauen , from Enuie to Glory , and from Mortality to Eternity . Not but that I euery way respect and honour that blood which is Noble , but that I yet more deerely honour, and deepely affect those Vertues which haue a secret, and (as I may iustly say) a sacred power in them to enoble Nobility , both which transcendant Priuileges , finding hand in hand cheerefully to march, and realy to sympathize in your Ho. (sith vpon the resplendant lustre of your actions, Enuie is not capeable to insinuate a blemish, nor Detraction of power to introduce or inforce a disparagement) was the sole preuayling motiue of this my Zeale and Ambition . And when I consider that the Moralitie, Ends and Punishments of these foule and crying sinnes of Murther, which my two former Bookes (of this Nature ) haue already related and divulged to the world, haue not onely beene approoued but applauded of our most Excellent , and Sacred King (as onely ayming at Gods glorie, and our owne reformation and preseruation) I rather hope then dispaire, that this Third (wherein the iust reuenge of God , the Great and Supreame King of kings , is no lesse apparant and conspicuous) will be accepted and receiued of your Ho. Againe, it fights against Murther, which not onely seekes to slay Humanitie , but therein to murther Religion , which is the Life , and Soule thereof. It denounceth warre against Nature and Grace , against the Diuine Ordinances of Heauen , and the Coactiue and penall Lawes of Earth , whereby they are established and maintained; as being the Cymment and Sinewes , the Veines and Arteries of Monarchies and Commonweales ; as also against the Maiesty of God , and the crownes and dignities of Soueraigne Kings and Princes, his Royall Deputies and Vice-gerents heere on earth, sith thereby hee loseth soules and these subiects; yea, so generall and so prodigious a progression, doth this scarlet sinne of premeditated and wil-full murther, make in the vniuersall World, and with so bloodie a deluge  & inundation, it not onely washes but (as it were) drownes the face of the Christian , that wee haue now farre truer cause to crie out, and iuster reason to exclaime, then did Quintus Catulus (so many centuries of yeares since) O with whom, or where shall wee liue in safety; sith in Warres wee kill those who are armed, and in Peace, who are vnarmed ; Yea, your Ho . who (with a happie constancie, and constant happinesse) is still a professed Champion for Charitie against Enuie , and a Tutularie Protector for Vertue against Vice , (whiles diuers great ones of the World, make it not onely their practise, but their glorie to performe the contrary) will, I hope, runne ouer these mournefull Histories , (and the seuerall accidents they relate) with your eye of pittie, and spirit of compassion; and therein with a Religious ioy, and pious insultation, not onely admire the Prouidence , but applaud, and magnifie the Iustice of God , in so timely cutting off these Monsters of Nature , and bloody butchers of Mankinde, with these their condigne punishments and deserued deaths; In which Hope and Confidence, this Booke is no more mine, but your Honours , and no lesse is hee, who collected and penned it; and that my Name may futurely oblige mee to make this present promise of my penne reall; Whiles many others (in a vertuous emulation) contend to deserue the Honour of your Fauour , and striue to purchase the felicitie of your Commands , none shall doe it, with more Integretie and lesse Vanity, then Your Honours truely deuoted THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE Against the crying and execrable Sinne of Murther. History XI.  De Salez killeth Vaumartin in a Duell; La Hay causeth Michaelle to poyson La Frange, De Salez loues La Hay , and because his father Argentier will not consent that hee marry her, stifleth him in his bedd, and then takes her to his wife; shee turnes Strumpet, and cuts his throat; as hee is dying, hee accuseth her of this bloody fact, and himselfe for murthering his father Argentier: so his dead body is hang'd to the gallowes, then burnt; La Hay confesseth this murther, and likewise that shee caused Michaelle to poyson La Frange : shee hath her right hand cut off, and is then burnt aliue; Michaelle is broken on the wheele, and his dead body throwen into the Riuer.  make vs esteem Enuy to be no Vice , and Murther a Vertue ; yet if wee will erect the eyes of our Faith , and so looke from ourselues to our soules, from Earth to Heauen, and from Sathan to God; we shall then assuredly find that hating our Christian Brother, wee hate Christ who made vs Brothers: and murthering him, that we maliciously and presumptuously attempt to recrucifie Christ , by whom we must, without whom we cannot be saued. But if we will turne Atheists, and beleeue there is a Heauen, but no God; or Deuils,  & say there is a God , but no Heauen, then that vncharitable Tenent of Enuy may be held lawfull, and this bloody position of Murther, practised, because priuiledged, else not. Wherefore let vs who are Christians , resend this deuillish doctrine, and doctrine of Deuils, to Hell from whence it first came, and to the deuill himselfe who first broached and inuented it: sith wee cannot professe it, without making our selues Agents , nor perpetrate it, without becomming his very limbs and members, in regard they will infallibly prooue the wofull forerunners of our misery, and the wretched Heraulds of our perdition: as the bloody Actors of this ensuing mournefull History will make good, and instance to vs in themselues when the seuere Iudgements, and punishments of God befell them so suddenly, as it was too late for them either to reuoke, or bewaile the enormitie of these their foule and infernall crimes. Parliament of France ) is the place wherin we shal vnderstand, there was lately committed  & perpetrated, a tragical History , which hath many mournfull and bloody dependances; the which to branch forth, and depaint in their naked colours, we must vnderstand, that therein liued a Councellour of that famous Court (being a rich Gentleman well descended) tearmed Monsieur de Argentier , whose wife being deceased, left him father onely to one hopefull sonne, of the age of two and twentie yeares, tearmed Monsieur de Salez , who being wholly addicted to the Warres (from which martiall Profession it was impossible for his old father to diuert and withdraw him) he procured him an Ensignes place vnder Monsieur de Roquelaure , whom he serued in the Adriaticke Sea, vnder the Noble and Generous Venetians , who then stood rather iealous, then fearefull of the power and greatnesse of Spaine ; but the Chymera of that warre (after the terme of three or foure yeares) being vanished and blowen away, and consequently betwixt those two mighty Estates , a new Peace contracted and concluded, (although the old had not been actually broken and delacerated) home returnes Monsieur de Roquelaure , for Gascogny , and with him De Salez for Languedoc and Tholouse , where he is receiued of his father with much content and ioy, not that hee was contented to see his sonne professe these Militarie courses (which onely affords the smoake of Honour, and not the solidity of profit) but rather that hee exceedingly reioyced to see him returne therfrom; and from whence, if he cannot hope that his requests will solely diuert him, yet he is resolued and assured that his Commands both will and shall. To which end, (as any humour is soonest subiect to be expelled and defaced by its contrary) so the old Councellor , hauing as much Iudgement and Prouidence in his head, as his sonne hath Vanity in his thoughts, and Rashnes in his resolutions, doth both request, and command him to leaue the War for Peace, Armes for Loue, the Camp for the Citie, and his Captaine for a Wife, and so no longer to march and fight vnder the Banners of Mars and Bellona , but vnder the Standarts of Venus and Hymeneus ; to which effect, he proffers him the choyce of many rich and faire yong Gentlewomen of the Countrey to his wife; but especially (and with farre more earnestnes then any other) to an exceeding rich match in the Citie, which was a yong Gentlewoman tearmed La Frange , being the onely child of Monsieur de Clugny , one of the most famous and richest Presidents of that Court , young of yeares, as being but sixteene, or seuenteene, but withall deformed both in fauour and body, for she was of a browne and sowre complexion, and not onely a Dwarfe in stature, but also exceedingly crooke-back'd, and yet beyond measure very amorous, and desirous of a Husband: onely the endowments of her minde most richly recompenced, and made satisfaction for the defects of her body: for she had an actiue and nimble wit, a sweet and sugred tongue, a rich Memory , and a powerfull and happy Iudgement , and was indeed an excellent Dauncer, and Singer, and withall a most perfect and exquisite Musician: But as yet De Salez warlike and generous resolution could not bee so soone made flexible, to embrace the motion of a wife, and so he returnes his deniall instead of his consent: but his wise old father Argentier , being therefore the more curious of his sonne De Salez his prosperity and welfare, because he apparantly saw he no way regarded, but euery way neglected it himselfe; (his sonnes exorbitant resolution notwithstanding) although hee knew that Madamoyselle La Frange had many noble Suitors , who sought her in mariage: yet relying vpon his ancient acquaintance and familiaritie with the President de Clugny , as also that that daughter of his, and this his Sonne were of both parties their onely children. He taking time at aduantage, breakes with him about this match: whereunto De Clugny hearkens rather with delight then distast: for if there were any disparitie in the dignitie of their Offices, he well knowes, that Argentiers blood and wealth did at least equallize, if not exceed his; or if hee conceited any scruple in his thoughts, which impugned or imposed it, it was onely because De Salez was a Souldier , and not a Lawyer , and consequently delighted to vse his sword before his Pen, and to weare and preferre a Scarlet cloke before a Blacke. But then againe, these repugnant and auerse reasons were as soone buried, as borne, and defaced, as conceiued and ingrauen in him; when hee considered that he himselfe in his adolescency was of the same humour and inclination, and therefore that Experience had made him a President to himselfe, that Time was both the reformer and refiner of manners, and that (in all well borne and well bred spirits) the Precepts of a father, and the sweet conuersation and counsell of a wife, had power to metamorphose the conditions of a young husband; whereupon the old fathers often meet and consult hereon, and so being fully agreed on all conditions, they likewise appoynt a solemne meeting for their children, but the effect and issue of this their enteruiew, will not corespond and answer their desires. La Frange (as we haue formerly sayd) being deformed and crook-backt, was no way agreeable but displeasing to De Salez , but he being a tall, and neat timbred Gentleman , of a faire and feminine complexion, she instantly most tenderly affected, and dearly loued him. In a word, I must request the curiositie of the Reader briefly to be informed and aduertised, that as shee beheld him with the eyes of Loue and Desire , so did he her with those of contempt and disdaine , shee building castles of content in the aire of her thoughts and hopes, that Heauen would make him her husband; and hee rasing both her and her memory out of that of his contemplations, vowing that Earth should neuer make her his wife. Thus though the Parents haue already shut vp the Contract, yet their children shall neuer liue to celebrate the Nuptials , for we shal see diuersity of tragicall accidents which are prouiding, and almost ready to oppose and impugne it. Parents think to be the causes, but God will still bee the Authour of Mariages: for if his sacred and diuine Maiesty make them not first in Heauen , they shall neuer see them solemnized nor consummated on Earth . And heere, to make an orderly progression in this History , the Reader must likewise vnderstand, that of all other of La Franges Suitors, none sought her with so much importunity and impatiency, as the Baron of Vaumartin , (whose chiefest house and lands lay betwixt Aigue-mortes and Narbone ) a Nobleman of some thirtie yeares old, who (like many others of his stampe and ranke) had spent the greatest part of his youth and meanes in Paris , in laciuiously debaushing and reuelling with the Parisian Ladies and Dames: so that the vanitie of his pleasures and expenses making his lands fly away piece-meale, and the deuasting and fall of his trees and woods, making the rest of his Mannors shake, (an example and president for all other debaushed Gallants to obserue and beware of) he leaues Paris with curses, and his bitter-sweet sinnes with repentance; and so (to repayre his errours, and to redeeme his lost time, and decayed Estate) he comes home to Languedoc , where hearing in Tholouse of the President de Clugny's great wealth, which he must solely leaue to his onely childe and daughter La Frange , who was now marriageable, he resolues to set all his other businesse and designes apart, and so to lay siege and seeke her of her father  & selfe in marriage. Now to take the better direction, and obseruation of this History , we must likewise vnderstand, that this Baron of Vaumartin was of a swart complexion, a dwarfe of stature, and euery way as crook-backt as La Frange , which the more flattered him in his hopes, and egged him on in his pursute, hoping indeed (though with as much Vanitie as Ignorance ) that this their corporall resemblance would the sooner induce and draw her to affect him: but his Arithmatique , or rather his Iudgement will deceiue him: for it is conformitie of Humors and Inclinations , and not of faces and bodies, which breedes and inflames a sympathy in affections. But he is resolute in his research, and so better louing the fathers wealth, then the daughters Beautie , he wel assisted and followed (with a traine and equipage worthy of his birth, and her merits) first seekes the daughter of her father, then her selfe of her selfe. As for the old President de Clugny , hee hath heard of his debaushed pranks and ryots in Paris ,  & therefore vowes that his wealth gotten with wisedome, and purchased with prouideence, study and care in his Age , shall neuer pay for the obsceane pleasures, and vitious prodigalities of his Youth: and so with many verball complements (resoluing that he shall neuer triumph in the conquest of his daughter) he in generall tearmes puts him off. As for La Frange her selfe, the sweetnesse of De Salez complexion, and personage, is so deeply imprinted in her heart, and thoughts, that it is impossible for Vaumartin to find any admittance or entrance; for shee speaks of none but de Salez , thinks of none but of de Salez , nor wisheth her selfe with any but with de Salez . Againe, she wonders at Vaumartins simplicitie, in seeking her for his wife: for if she hate deformitie in her selfe, how is it either likely or possible, that shee can loue it in her husband? No, no; though de Salez will not loue La Frange , yet La Frange must and will loue de Salez , and none but him; and therfore fith de Salez his sweete feature is a pearle in her eye, needs must Vaumartin be an eye-sore to her; yea, and if modesty will permit mee to speake or write an immodest truth, her heart doth so burne and flame in loue to de Salez , that both day and night, shee many times with sighes, sometimes with teares, wisheth her selfe eyther impayled in his armes, or he encloystred in hers. Now by this time Vaumartin hath full notice and aduertisement of her affection deuoted to none but to de Salez , as also of his sleighting and disdaining her: Whereupon encouraged by this, and dishartened by that, he leaues no cost, care, or curiositie (eyther in gifts, dauncing, musicke, or bankets vnattempted) to crowne his wants, rather then his desires and pleasures, with this though deformed, yet rich heire La Frange: so leauing him to his vaine sute in courting her, speake we a little of de Salez , that sith he will not affect La Frange , wee may yet obserue and discouer, which way he intends to shape the course of his affections and resolutions. For albeit he had formerly addicted himselfe and resolutions to be a professed Souldier, yet Peace calling him home now to Pleasure , and that to effeminacy (a fatall and dangerous vice , which (in the iniquity of these our times and depraued manners) not only most insensibly creepes into common Souldiers and Commanders, but also into all Armies, and into many Estates and kingdoms , still to the disparagement of their glory, and sometime to the price of their ruine, and perill of their subuersion) he began to let his Colours hang dustie, and his Pike and Partizan rustie by the walls, and to frequent the company of Ladies, which the old Counsellor his father obserues with ioy, hoping that in the end, hee shall draw him to affect and marry La Frange: but these hopes of his will prooue vaine, and this his ioy will soone bee exchanged into sorrow, and metamorphosed into affliction and misery: for that his sonne is partly resolued to marry, tis true, but as true it is, that he is fully resolued neuer to loue, much lesse to marry La Frange . Now wee must vnderstand, that in Tholouse there dwelt a Marchant of Silkes (or as we in England say, a Silk-man) tearmed Monsieur de Soulange , rather reputed rich of others, then knowen so of himselfe, and yet being an old Widdower, to the end the sooner to get him a new wife, hee puts a good face on his estate, and maintaines himselfe, family, and house, with great pompe and expences, hauing no sonne, but three fayre daughters, all marriageable; and yet (out of ambition & in emulation of the Gentry ) seuerally knowen and styled by their titles, not by their names, as Mesdamoyselles de Marsy, La pre Verte , and La Hay , all famous for their beauties, and indeed for the purenesse and excellency thereof iustly reputed and held the prime Birds of the citie, and yet the yongest of them La Hay was the Phenix of all the three: for shee was so sweetly fayre, and fayrely sweet of complexion, as shee drew all eyes to doe homage to hers: so as it was almost impossible for any man to looke on her without louing her, or to gaze on her, without desiring her; for her body was so straight and slender, and the roses of her cheekes so deliciously gracing the lillies, and the lillies the roses, that the greatest Gallant eyther of the Citie or Country, held himselfe not only happy, but honoured with the felicity of her presence and company. But in one word, to giue these three sisters their true characters, de Marsy , and La Pre- verte , were far more vertuous then La Hay , though La Hay were farre fayrer then they: for as Religion and Piety was their chiefest delight and exercise, as more desirous to embellish their soules then their bodies; so wanton pleasure and vaine laciuiousnesse was hers, as rather delighting to please and adorne her body then her soule, they being more vertuous then fayre, shee more fayre then vertuous, different inclinations and resolutions; these as happy and blessed, as hers wretched and impious; their actions might haue been a President, yea a Pilot to haue conducted her fame as well to the Temple of Honor , as to the harbour of immortall glory, and of glorious immortality: but she vowes she wil proue a presidet to her self,  & her pleasure shalbe a Pilot to her will, although she misse the Temple of Honour , to find out that of beastly concupiscence, and the harbor of immortall glory, to suffer shipwrack vpon the shelues of inglorious infamy, and the rocks of infamous perdition. To this Monsieur de Soulanges house, the beauties of his three daughters, but especially that of La Hay , and (withall) her pleasing and tractable affabilitie, envites many young Gentlemen and the eminentst Citizens, who there passe their time in courting and conuersing, in dauncing, singing, and the like, whereunto the Youth of Fraunce more then any other people of the world, are most licenciously addicted; and as things are best discerned and distinguished by their contraries, so the vertues of De Marsy , and La Preverte were made more apparant by La Hayes vices; and her lust and whoredomes was more palpably notorious in their chastitie. O that so sweet a creature should be subiect to so foule a sin; and that Beauty the best gift, (and as I may say the gold) of Nature , should be thus vilified  & polluted with the beastly pleasures of carnall concupiscence, and obsceane sensuality! for, Ay me, I write it with as much griefe to my selfe, as shame to her, she was too prodigall of her fauours: for shee imparted them liberally vnto some for loue, but vnto most for money, not caring to whom shee prostituted her body, so they filled her purse, thereby to support her pride and maintaine the excesse and vanity of her brauery, and yet she was so subtill and cautious therein, that although shee were a professed Courtisan , she would neuerthelesse publikely seeme a pure and vnspotted Virgin ; and the better to fortifie her fame, and to make the reputation of her Chastitie passe currant with the world, shee would swear all those to conceale her fauors, on whomsoeuer she imparted and bestowed them: but if this lasciuious subtiltie of hers haue power to bleare the eyes of the world, how can this her beastly sinne of fornication be vnseene of God , when the windowes, walles, and beames of her chamber, yea, her very bed whereon she hath acted her whoredomes, shall one day giue in Euidence , and serue as witnesses against her; yea, and be petitioners on earth that God will requite and reward them with Vengeance and confession from Heauen. Now, among the rest of those deboshed Gentlemen , who deuoted their laciuious seruice, and sacrificed their fond affections to La Hays beautie; in comes our De Salez to inroule himsefe one: who, feasting and surfeiting his eyes, on the delicacies of her fresh and sweet complexion; leaues his owne fathers house, to frequent hers, yea his desires are so lustfully inflam'd with her beautie, as with his best art and policie, he lies close siege to her chastitie; and with many gifts, requests and oathes, seekes to endeere her to his desires and pleasure: But see the subtiltie of this laciuious young Courtisan , for knowing de Salez deepely in loue with her, and to bee the onely child of his father, and he one of the richest Councellors of Tholouse ; she conceiues a plot in her head, to goe a fishing to make him her husband; and so beares her selfe wonderfull modest and coye, casting a cloake and vaile of chastitie ore her vnchast desires and actions, as if she were now a virgin, yea a Saint to him; though heretofore she had many times played the Strumpet with others: but her deniall doth rather inflame, then quench the fire of his lust, so as making many assaults, to raze downe the defences of her refusall, that he may enter and take possession of her heart and fauour: his best Art and Oratory prooues vaine; for she outwardly retires her affection, thereby the better, inwardly to aduance and finish her purposes: so this repulse of hers makes him hang his head, and become pensiue and melancholie; the true signes and symptomes of a foolish and fantasticall louer as in effect we shall shortly see de Salez will prooue himselfe: for the coulder she is in affection to him, the hotter is he in lust with her, forgetting the warres, yea, his discretion, himselfe, and all to crowne his desires in inioying her: the which she well obseruing begins to triumph in her good fortune, as thinking him already fairely come to the hooke, and so hopes that if the line of his folly and her good fortune and wit hold, she will soone make him her husband, and her selfe his wife: For hauing formerly met with many knaues in others, she now begins to rest confident either to find, or make a foole of him; thereby to serue as a vayle to oueruayle her whoredomes: He pleads hard to her for loue, She replies it is impossible to find loue in lust, he vowes he will die her seruant, she sweares she will neuer liue his strumpet: He protesteth that she shall share of his estate, She tells him plainely that she had rather liue a poore wife, then die a rich Courtesan ; Hee replies that he adores her beautie, She answeres, that she knowes no other, but that he onely seekes to prophane and defile it: And here with more facilitie to make him swallow, either a Gull, a Gudgin, or both; she by stealth permits him to cull some kisses, aswell from the cherries of her lippes, as the roses of her cheeks: and in the Interim like an hypocriticall and desembling queane, reads him many lectures on the purenesse of Chastitie , and the foulenesse of Lust , on the blessednesse of Mariage , and the wretched estate of Fornication: Prophane and impious giglet, whose speeches are perfumed with Vertue , and yet her actions stincke, and are poluted and infected with Vice: desembling Syreen , who casts foorth bitter sweet inchanting tunes and charms to please the sence, and yet purposely to poyson the soule, pilles of worme-wood candid in sugar, honny to the pallate, but gall to the stomacke: A fatall rocke whereon many inconsiderate and deboshed young Gentlemen haue vnfortunately suffered shipwracke, a wretched Gulph and Laborinth which containes all varietie of endlesse miseries and calamities, whereunto whosoeuer enters with pleasure, is sure to retire with teares, curses, and repentance; A plague sent vs from heauen in our age, for a iust guerdon and recompense of the sinnes and folly of our youth. And into this intricate Laborinth and bottomlesse Gulph of miserie and calamitie, is our rash and lustfull yong Gallant , cheerefully entering and steering his course, without either the Starre of hope, or Compasse of felicitie and safetie, bearing out toppe and toppe Gallant, yea (as I may say) with all the sayles of his folly bearing; and with the flagge Ensigne and Pendants of his obsc aene and laciuious desires, playing and dalying in the Aire of La Hayes fatall and infectious beautie; which hath so solely surprised his iudgement, captiuated his thoughts, and eclipsed his descretion, as in her abscence and presence he extolls aswell her Vertues as her beautie to the Skies: vowing that shee is so faire a Nymph , and so pure a Virgine , as she deserues rather to be his wife, then his Strumpet, or rather not his strumpet but his wife: And so two moneths being past since he first frequented her, and sought to seduce and obtaine her to his laciuious desires; and seeing (desembling queane as she is) that therein she bore her selfe infinitely chast and modest, and that it was impossible for him to obserue or remarke any other inclination or testimonie, either in her word or carriage, his wits are so besotted and intangled in the fetters of her beautie, that he preferres her sweet feature and complexion, a thousand times before La Franges , deformed; and vowes that he had rather die La Hayes slaue, then euer liue to be La Franges husband: But this folly of his in the end shall cost him deare, and so lead him to another, farre more vnnaturall, and as I may iustly say, damnable: But we must proceed orderly in this History, and do therefore reserue that part till anon. By this time the slie subtiltie, and seeming chast behauiour of La Hay , hath acted wonders in De Salez heart, so as she now hopes confidently, and shortly to play her prise in surprising him, for he is extreamely amorous besotted, and as I may say, drunke with the loue of her selfe and beautie: so on a Sunday, as shee returned from Vespres , he repaires to her fathers house to see her, who he finds in her chamber alone, waiting and attending him: hauing purposely dighted her selfe in a rich new Gowne and Petticote, and trimmed and adorned her selfe in her gayest  & most curious attire, thereby with more ease and facilitie to draw him to her lure: So as her beautie being both seconded, and graced by her apparell, she so rauished his heart, and delighted his sences, as he cannot refraine from kissing her; but this hony of her lippes, will in the end proue poyson to his heart: And heere againe he layes close siege to her chastitie, but still she giues him the repulse and refusall, as if she were a Diana , and no Venus He vowes he doth affect, and will euer honour her; And she, that if he honour her, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) will still affect him: In the the way of Loue , quoth he, I am wholly yours; and quoth she, in that Honour I will not be mine owne but yours: I will quoth hee in all affection both liue and die your seruant; and replies she, In all chastity, I will liue to die your handmaid: He affirmes, he cannot be more hers in heart, then he is; nor I quoth she, lesse yours in lust, then I am: It is quoth he my Loue which makes me report so much; and quoth she it is my Feare which makes me affirme no lesse: Why, quoth he, should my loue procure your Feare , My feare, quoth she, is wholly ingendred and deriued from your lust, but not from your Loue : I pray expresse your selfe, quoth he; she replies, my blushes may, but my tongue dares not: Quoth he, did your affection equalize mine: La Hay would accept of De Salez , and not refuse him, Nay quoth she, did De Salez know how infinite mine exceeds his, he would not refuse La Hay , but accept of her: Why quoth he, de Salez desires none but La Hay , Nor quoth she, La Hay any in the world but de Salez: Whereupon de Salez being prouoked with his owne lust, and animated and encouraged by her sweet speeches, he very ioyfully (yet falsly) flattering himselfe with the conquest of her fauour and consent, shuts the doore, and like a most laciuious and disolute Gentleman , takes her in his armes, and striues to conuey her to the bed, resoluing there to inrich himselfe with more then kisses, yea, to reape the fruit of his beastly pleasures and obsceane and brutish desires; but his hopes shall deceiue him: For although La Hay be a Courtisan in heart, yet she will not be som tongue, especially now, where to get her selfe a rich husband, it behooues her to play her prise in Chastity , as if she were as vertuous, as faire, and as chast as louely; Wherefore exclayming, and storming at this his laciuious attempt and enterprise, leuelled at the defloration and shipwracke of her Honour , she with a violent power, and an enraged violence, vnskrewes her selfe forth his armes, and with a world of hypocriticall sighes and teares, flies to his Ponyard, which he had throwne on the table, and vnsheathing it, vowes that she will be a second Lucretia , and that if she cannot kill him before he haue defiled and defloured her, yet that she will assuredly murther her selfe after; because she is fully resolued, that her chastitie shall outliue her, not she her chastitie; A religious and Honourable resolution of hers, if it had proceeded from a chast and sanctified heart, but alas, nothing lesse; for she speakes it out of subtiltie, not out of Vertue , out of Policie , no way out of Pietie: de Salez by this time hauing wholly lost his iudgement in the sweet and roseat garden of her delicious complexion; vowes that he is now as deepely in loue with her chastity, as formerly with her beauty. When seeking to appease her Chellor , and to pacifie her Indignation , as also to giue truce to his owne thoughts, and content to his desires; he sweares he is so farre from intending her any dishonour, as he is resolued to doe her all the honour of the world: Yea so farre, as if she please, he is ready to accept her for his wife, protesting, that of all the maydens of the world, he is desirous to be husband to none but her selfe, and that the fault shall be hers, if he make not his words deeds. La Hay hauing her thoughts tickled with delight, to heare the pleasant melody of these his sugred speeches, doth thereat presently bury her sighes, and drie vp her teares: when throwing away the ponyard, and making him a most respectfull courtsie, and gratefull reuerence, shee with extended armes runnes to him, and hangs about his necke, vowing that she loues no man in the world but himselfe; and in consenting to be her husband, she wil till death yeeld, not only to be his faithfull wife in attending his pleasures, but his obseruant handmaid, to receiue and obey his commaunds: and so they interchangeably greet each other with thanks  & kisses. But yet shee knowing that his father Argentier was both rich and eminent, and her owne poore and of a farre inferiour ranke, shee is so politike and subtill in the managing of this her affection, as she is resolued to make sure worke, and to doe nothing by halfes: so as knowing that words are but wind, and what de Salez promiseth her now, he may either forget or deny to morrow, she intends to catch at opportunities forelocke, and so with a sweet and ingenious insinuation, drawes him to giue her a Diamond Ring in token of marriage, and she in exchange returnes him a small gold bracelet, which shee wore vpon her arme next her heart. And yet againe considering, that his father would very difficultly (or neuer) be drawen to consent to this match, she can giue no true content to her desires, nor satisfaction to her feare, before shee haue vnited and linked him to her, in a more stricter and firmer bond of assurance; when not onely feasting, but as it were surfetting him with varietie of kisses, shee bethinks her selfe of a policy , as worthy of her wit for attempting, as of his folly for performing: for directing him her speech (which shee accompanied with many amorous, yet dissembling smiles) she told him she would futurely exceed him in constancy, and now outbraue him in affection; when taking pen and paper, she writes him a faire promise, and firme assurance of her selfe vnto him (in the manner of a Contract) and to make it the more powerfull and authenticall, subscribes her name and signe to it, and betwixt sighs and blushing, she deliuers it him; no way doubting, but rather assuring her selfe, that he would require her with the like curtesie and obligation, as indeed the euent answereth her desires and wishes: For de Salez hauing now no power left him to see by his owne eyes, I meane, by those of his iudgement, but only by these of his intemperat passion, and passionat affection, he is so far from descrying (much lesse from suspecting) her policy, as very simply and sottishly he attributes it to the feruency of her affection, the which he interprets and entertaines, I know not whether with more ioy, or delectation; and so vowing not to dye her debtor for Courtesie , he very rashly, and inconsideratly writes another to the same effect, and flyes so farre from wit or discretion, as to shew himselfe her superiour in affection, as well as in sex, he purposely cuts his finger, and so firmes his name thereunto with his owne blood, and then with a million of kisses deliuers it her, vowing that her pleasure shall be his law in the accomplishing therof: only he prayes her for a time to be secret and silent heerein, for that he feares he shall hardly draw his Father to consent hereunto, the which she very courteously graunts him: and so he triumphing in her beauty, and she in his wealth, he in her youth, and she in his simplicity, they for that time part, not doubting but they shall shortly reape the fruits of their matrimoniall desires and wishes; for till then, she sweares (though with an equiuocating reseruation to forsweare her selfe) she will liue a most pure and vnspotted Virgin, and that as the least of her affection and courtesie towards him, shall be smiles, so the most shall be kisses. But this (affection or rather folly) of De Salez in contracting himselfe to La Hay , is not so secretly borne, but as her former vnchastitie was a generall argument of talke to the whole citie of Tholouse: so now this of her subtilty and good fortune, is that of its vniuersall pratling and admiration, occasioned and redoubled by the opposite considerations of Argentiers knowen wealth, and de Soulanges supposed pouerty; and againe of de Salez supposed chastity, and of de la Hayes notoriously knowen whoredoms. And as Fame is still so tatling a goddesse, that euents and accidents of this nature can hardly be concealed, and difficultie suppressed and smoothered: so by this time contrary to the expectations and hopes of our two young Louers, the old Councellor Argentier hath notice of this vnlooked- for newes, and of this vnwished for familiaritie betwixt his sonne, and that strumpet La Hay , when considering the great opposition betwixt de Clugny's Nobilitie and wealth, and de Soulanges meane extraction and pouertie; as also by a true and vncontroleable Antithises , comparing the foule and enormious vices of La Hay with the sweet and resplendant vertues of La Frange ; he (as much disdayning that match, as desiring this for his sonne, very hastily sends for him into the Arbor, where purposely attending him, he with lightning in his lookes, and thunder in his speeches, layes before him the simplicity, and the sottishnesse of his resolution, in preferring La Hay before La Frange , a strumpet before a virgin, and a Pedlers brat, before a rich gentlemans only daughter and heyre, shewes him the infamy of the first, and the glory of the last match; there his vnavoydable misery, here his assured happinesse; in the first his vtter ruine and shipwracke, and in the last, his infallible prosperity and felicity: and so intermixing threats with teares, with a passionate paternall affection, he endeauoreth to perswade him to leaue La Hay , and to marry La Frange ; or if not, hee vowes and sweares wholly to disinherit him, and from thenceforth neuer repute or esteeme him for his sonne. But de Salez his foolish vanity, and vaine affection in himselfe towards his new contracted Loue La Hay , is so great, and consequently his filiall obedience to his father so small, as notwithstanding this his wholesome aduise and counsell, he is still resolute and constant to preferre La Hay before La Frange , the beauty of the one, before the deformity of the other, his owne content before his fathers, and Soulanges estate and byrth before the great wealth and noble extraction of De Clugny: but this rashnes, indiscretion, and ingratitude of his will cost him deare. Now if Argentier haue perfect intelligence and curious notice of his sonns familiarity with that faire yet lewd Courtezan La Hay , no lesse hath la Frange , who poore soule is so deeply enamoured of de Salez , as the very first newes  & conceyt, that another should enioy him, and not her selfe, for very griefe and sorrow, shee seemes to drowne her selfe in the deluge of her teares. His father is chollerick therat, she mournfull; he incensed, she afflicted, he inraged, and she perplexed and tormented; his passions & anger proceeds from suspition, that he shall so soone find a daughter in law in la Hay ; her sighes and teares from feare, that she shall so soone loose her Loue, though not her Louer, his sonne de Salez . Againe, the argument of his choller, is la Hayes vnchastitie and pouertie, and the cause of her disconsolation, de Salez his wealth and vertues: likewise she sees that Argentier hath no reason to hope, that his sonne will marry her selfe, such is her deformitie; and againe, that he hath all the reasons of the world, as well to doubt, as feare, that hee will wed la Hay , such is her beauty: But sith de Salez will beare no more respect to his father, nor affection to la Frange , leaue we therfore his father Argentiers passions, and la Franges perplexities, to bee appeased and qualified by Time , or rather by God , the Authour and giuer of Time , who out of his all-seeing prouidence and sacred pleasure, onely knowes in Heauen, how best to dispose and manage the actions of earth; and so come wee to other vnexpected occurrents and euents, which like so many enteriecting, and interuening poynts, are contained within the circumference of this History . I haue so long insisted on the affections of de Salez and la Hay , as but to the iudicious and temperat Reader it would seeme to appeare, that the Baron of Vaumartin hath wholly forgotten to remember his to his Lady La Frange: But to put that doubt out of question, and this question out of doubt, we shal see him returne too too soone, to act a part not so religious and honourable, as bloody, vpon the Theatre of this History: For by this time both his creditors  & his debts are growen so clamorous, and his reputation & lands so neere forfeited, for want of disingaging, as to secure the one, and prouide for the other, he knowes no other inuention nor meanes, but to gaine La Frange to his wife: when, as it were, prouoked and precipitated on by the necessity of this exigent, his thoughts leaue heauen to fly to hell, and consequently fly from God to Sathan, to consult how either by the bye, or the mayne hee may obtaine her; yea, though with the perill and hazard of his owne life, to cut off theirs, who seeke therein to preuent his desires and designes. In which hellish ratiocynation, he as deuoyd of Reason , as that is exempt either of Grace or Pietie , thus reasoneth with himselfe: De Clugny hates me, for seeking to marry his daughter, and that time may remedy for me; but which is worst of all, shee loues De Salez , and seekes and desires to marry him, and this I must remedy in time, if I euer expect to obtaine or enioy her; and so resolues to make him away: but is as yet irresolute how to perpetrate, and in what manner to finish so execrable a businesse. But this is not onely the voyce of his malice, but the sentence of his reuenge, that De Salez must die: wretched Vaumartin , vnworthy to beare the name of a man, much lesse of a Baron , but least of all of a Christian , in that because De Salez hates La Frange ,  & she loues him, that therfore thou wilt not loue but hate him; or because shee loues him, and not thy selfe, that therefore thou wilt kill him, that she may loue thee. See, see, rash and inconsiderate Nobleman , how treacherously the Deuill hath hood-wink'd, yea inueigled thy iudgment,  & besotted thy senses, to kill one that loues thee, to kill I say, a Gentleman who hath not offended thee, but is euery way thy friend, no way thine enemy: or if thou thinke it wisdome, that couetousnesse must redeeme thy former prodigality, alas, alas , canst thou yet be so cruell, to thinke it eyther lawfull or religious, that future murther should either occasion or authorize it: But the Deuill hath so farre preuayled with his impious resolutions, that againe he resolues, De Salez must dye: and yet thou thinkest poyson as vnworthy of him, as he is worthy of thy sword; so had thy last resolution been answerable to thy first, assure thy selfe thou hadst made thy selfe more happy, and not so miserable: for as poysoning was the inuention of the deuill, and is practised by none but his agents; so this dishonourable poynt of honour to fight Duels, was neuer instituted by God , nor professed by those who really professe his Gospell: yea, it is not onely truly to dishonour God , in seeking falsly to preserue our owne Honour and reputation, but wee assuredly stab at the Maiestie of the Creator , in seeking to deface man his creature; and to vse but a word, as it is repugnant both to Nature and Grace , so though it begin in the heat of passion and pleasure, it many times terminates in Repentance, but still in true Infamy and misery. But Vaumartins faith being so strong with Sathan , and so weake with his Sauiour , he will not take a law from Religion to giue to his Enuy , but rather takes one from his Enuy to giue to his Religion ; and so very prophanely and rashly by his Lackey La Rose , sends De Salez this Challenge:  Franges affection to thee, and hatred to my selfe: wherefore hold it not strange, that I now command my pen to inuite thee and thy sword to meete mee to morrow on horse-backe without Seconds, 'twixt fiue and sixe in the morning, behind the Iacobins garden. Loue and Valour thou knowest, are neuer capable of much expostulation; as desirous rather to be tryed in action, then seene in words. Could that sweete Lady , (who will not bee mine, because thou art hers) haue affected me more, or thee lesse, wee mought haue prooued as true friends, as now our reputations coniure vs eyther to liue or dye, Honourable Enemies. Vavmartin.  De Salez hauing receiued and read this Challenge, doth not a little wonder at the Baron of Vaumartins strange passion and resolution, in sending it him, especially, sith hee knowes that the motiues and grounds of his malice were so vniust and friuolous: so, how to answere him, as yet he knowes not; for as his Generositie one way inuites him to fight, so his discretion another way perswades him from it: But considering the poore esteeme he makes either of the Lady La Frange , or her affection, thinking it folly to fight without cause, and to hazard his life without reason, hee calls for pen and paper, and as a wise, yet valiant Gentleman, by his owne Lackey, returnes the Baron of Vaumartin this answer:  mee: for to write thee the truth, the grounds and foundations thereof are vniust, false, or both: for bring but the eyes of thy Iudgment, and not of thy passion, to bee Iudge and Vmpier betwixt vs; and thou shalt both see and finde, that I not onely disclaime the Lady La Franges affection, but her selfe; sith I appertaine to another, and shee shall neuer to mee. I heere shew thee my loue through this true Prospectiue of my heart, which if it will not satisfie thy malice, then know that my weake Valour is neither capable nor desirous of further expostulation, then that my Sword is as willing to bring thee deedes, as thy Pen was to send mee words: for either single, or with Second, either on foot or horseback, I will still be ready to giue reason to those, who will nor relish, nor receiue any but their owne: and in this resolution of mine, I know I shall either liue with Reputation , or dye with Honour . De Salez.  Vaumartin hauing receiued and perused this letter of refusall from De Salez , hee out of the heat of his passion, and height of his folly, reputes it rather to cowardise, then discretion in him; and so his courage and reuenge the more insulting and inflam'd thereat, hee bending his browes (as if Contempt and Enuy sate wreath'd in the furrowes therof) ver speedily againe returnes him his Lackey, with this rash answer:  affection to the Lady la Frange , is to deny the light of the Sunne in his brightest and hottest Meridian ; neither are the grounds or foundations of my Challenge eyther uniust or false, as thou in thy false Prospectiue endeauourest to make mee see or beleeue: for being ignorant who is thy Mistris , I know thou resoluest to make no Lady of the world thy wife but La Frange , so as I cannot rightly define whether thy proceeding with me be more subtill or malicious, or to what end thou shouldest attempt the one, or practise the other towards me, unlesse out of a premeditated resolution and purpose, thereby to make thy glory the more apparent and conspicuous in my shame : Wherfore sith thy friendship is false to me, I must, nay I will see if thy valour will prooue true to thy selfe, and whether the effects of thy Sword be as great in substance, as the vanity of thy Pen depaynts them, in shew and ostentation: So my Challenge is still my Resolution, and the performance thereof must bee thine, except thou resolue to liue with as much Infamy, as the conclusion of thy Letter promiseth thou art ready to dye with reputation and Honour . Vavmartin.  De Salez hauing receiued and runne ouer this Letter, and seeing that Vaumartin was still wilfull and resolute to fight, thinks that he should degenerat from himselfe, his Blood, and Profession, if he did not now accept and answere this his Challenge: wherefore calling for Vaumartins Lackey, he rounds him thus in his eare, Tell thy Master, that if I liue, I will not fayle to breake fast with him timely in the morning, according to his expectation . Thus we see these two inconsiderate Gentlemen agreed, their match concluded,  & nothing but the night to hinder them from fighting, as if their glory consisted in their shame, and as if Nature had neuer taught them how to preserue their liues, nor Grace , their soules. So the Morne peeping forth through the windows of Heauen , as soone as the Sunne with his glistering beames began to salute the woods and mountaines, our two resolute Champions brauely mounted with each his Chirurgeon , are in the field at the assignd Rendeuous, and first comes Vaumartin , and then immediately De Salez , whe their Chirurgeons performing the dutie and office of Seconds, being some hundred paces distant, they giue spurres to their Steeds, and so drawing their swords, swiftly part, like two flashes of lightning each towards other. At their first meeting, de Salez giues Vaumartin the first hurt in the right shoulder, and hee de Salez another in requitall, in the right side of the neck: whe being both good Caualiers , ( & well neere as equal in yeres as courages) they turne short, and then fall to it againe with brauery and resolution, when againe Vaumartin runs de Salez through his left arme of a deepe and wide wound, and he onely sleightly cuts his shirt vpon his ribbes, giuing him onely a raze or scarre, but as yet both free from any danger of death, so they mutually consent to breath: but their ambitions and courages of both sides, are so exasperated and inflamed, as although they are all bloody, yet this will not suffice: so they fall to it again, and in this close de Salez his horse stumbles with him; whereat Vaumartin (though a dwarfe in stature, yet not in Valour and Policy) taking the aduantage of this accident, giues him first a licke ore his pate, and then rnnnes him at the short ribbes: but de Salez rayning vp his horse, prooued fauourable to him; for by that meanes Vaumartins sword met and glaunced on a rib, without doing him any farther hurt. De Salez seeing the redoubling of his wounds, beginnes to redouble his courage, and disdaining thus to bee outbraued and beaten by a Pygmey , he lyes home at Vaumartin , and at their very next close, runnes him thorow the body, of a deepe and mortall wound, a little aboue his nauell: whereat his sword presently falles out of his hand to the ground, and hee immediately likewise from his horse starke dead, without hauing the grace or happinesse, either to call on, or to name God . O what pitie, what misery is it, that a Christian should dye like a beast, hauing neither power to pray, nor felicitie to repent. Thus we see the Challenger kill'd, and he who would haue murthered a stranger, murthered himselfe by a stranger: a Lesson to teach others to beware, by the Tragicall and mournfull end of this rash Nobleman. De Salez seeing Vaumartin dead, praiseth God for his victory; and so leauing his breathlesse corps to his sorrowfull Chirurgion , he gallops away to the next Village, where hee causeth his wounds to bee dressed, and from thence prouides for his safetie. All Tholouse rings and resounds of this dissasterous and Tragicall accident: De Clugny is glad, that De Salez hath escaped death, yet sorrowfull that Vaumartin is kill'd, in respect hee feares hee vndertooke this quarrell for his daughter La Franges sake: who hearing that De Salez wounds are no way mortall, infinitely reioyceth, and triumpheth thereat, flattering her selfe (though with this false hope) that he affected her farre more dearer then he made shew of, or else that he would neuer haue fought with Vaumartin for her sake, nor haue kill'd him but for his owne. And thus, though humanitie made her grieue for Vaumartins death, yet that griefe of hers was as suddenly conuerted into ioy, when she saw he receiued it by the hand of De Salez , whom shee respected and affected more dearer then all the Gentlemen of the world. Now, as for his father Argentier the life of his sonne likewise wiped off the remembrance of Vaumartins death, and yet it grieued him inwardly, that hee to whome hee gaue life, should giue death to another: and farre the more, in that this vnfortunate accident must now enforce him to beg pardon from that graue Court of Parliament , for this murther perpetrated by his sonne, sith he had formerly so often pleaded for iustice against others, for the like crime and offence; But all these ioyes of Argentier, De Clugny , and his daughter La Frange , are nothing to those of La Hay for the life and victory of her deare De Salez: leaping as it were for meere content and pleasure, that shee should shortly see, and enioy him for her husband, and that God hath both reserued, and preserued him to crowne her with the sweetnesse of this desired felicitie. Thus while La Frange and La Hay triumph and congratulate the returne of De Salez , so Argentier publikely, and De Clugny priuately, imploy there chiefest power, friends and authoritie, to procure his pardon first from the King, then from the Parliament , whereof they are two famous members. Which at last, (by the meanes and fauour of the Duke of Ventadour ) they obtaine: So this murther of his, is remitted in Earth, but I feare me, will not be forgotten in Heauen ; for though men be inconstant in their decrees, yet God will be firme and vpright, aswell in the distribution, as execution of his iudgements. Men as they are men may erre, but as they are Christians they should not; but God (either to please or displease them) neither can nor will. De Salez no sooner hath escaped this danger, but forgetting his former follies, and his fathers aduise  & house, he againe, in a manner voluntarily imprisoneth himself with his mistris La Hay in hers; wherat as his father stormes, so De Clugny , and La Frange bite the lip: hoping that this good office in procuring him his pardon would more strictly haue vnited him to her selfe, and consequently sequestred him from La Hay ; but nothing lesse, for he sings his old tune, and will rather run the hazard of his fathers displeasure, then leaue La Hay to take La Frange: whereat his father Argentier reneweth his choller, and reuiues his indignation against him, as desiring nothing so much in this life, as to see him married to La Frange , but he shall neuer liue to see it; for there are too many disasterous accidents preparing to crosse and preuent it: Whiles these things happen in Tholouse , there betides an vnexpected and vnwished businesse, which must call away Argentier to Paris: For the Lords of the Priuie Councell of France , hauing receiued some informations and grieuances against the body of the Court of Parliament of Tholouse ; commaund them speedily to send vp some Deputies to answere such matters as shall be obiected against them: whereupon, the grauitie and wisedome of that Court, in obedience to their superiours, elect two Presidents and foure Counsellours to vndertake that iourney and businesse among whom De Clugny is chosen for one of the Presidents , and Argentier for one of the Counsellours: as indeed their integritie and profound Wisedome and Experience had made them eminent in that Court. As for de Clugny at his importunate request (made to the Court) he was dispenced with, from that iourney; by alleadging that his age and sickenesse made him altogether vnfit to vndertake it: but all the euasions and excuses, which Argentier could make, could not exempt him, but he must needs see Paris . But first, before his departure he had a long and serious conference with de Clugny , how to effect the so long desired match of his sonne and daughter, the finishing whereof was referred till his returne from Paris , which sweet newes infinitely reioyced and delighted the young Ladie La Frange , and the immediate night before he was to take Coach, hee calls his sonne de Salez to him, and with a perswasiue and powerfull speech, requested him in his absence to loue La Frange , which he in plaine tearmes protested and vowed to his father, he could not, then hee coniures him, neuer to mary La Hay , which likewise he would not grant; and to conclude, sith his father could not preuaile in the two former, he commanded him vpon his blessing, that he would neuer marry any wife whatsoeuer without his consent, the which indeed de Salez could not denie, but faithfully promised his father; yea, and bound it with an oath, yet still hoping, that it was as possible for him to draw his father to consent he should marry La Hay , as it was as impossible for his father euer to perswade him to marry La Frange: and so that night the father takes leaue of the sonne, and he the next morning of his father, wishing him a prosperous iourney, and a speedy returne: who suspecting, and fearing, that in his absence, contrary to his requests and prayers, his Sonne would only abandone La Frange , to frequent La Hay ; he being ariued to the Citie of Tours , thought himselfe bound in Nature , aswell for his owne content, as his sonnes tranquilitie and prosperitie; againe, to signifie him his mind in some few lines of aduise and counsell, and to send it him by the ordinary Carrier of Tholouse ; which was then in that Citie, bound thither from Paris: his letter spake thus.  that I now send thee these few ensuing lines, for thy Youth cannot see that which my Age knows, how many miseries are subiect, to wait & attend on Vice , and how many blessings on Vertue ; if La Frange be not faire, yet she is comely, not contemptible: but sith her defects of Nature are so richly recompensed with the Ornaments of Fortune , and the excellencies of Grace ; why should thy affection preferre La Hay before her, who hath nothing but a painted face to oueruaile the deformitie of her other vices? If thou wilt leaue a Saint to marry a strumpet, then take La Hay , and forsake La Frange ; but if thou [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) forsake a strumpet to take a Saint , then marry La Frange and leaue La Hay , for look what difference there is betweene their births, thou shalt find ten times more betweene the chastitie of the one, and the leuitie of the other: If thou espouse the first, thou shalt find Content and Honour ; if the second shame and repentance: for I know not whether La Frange will bring thee more happinesse, or La Hay misery. This letter shall serue as a witnesse betwixt God , my selfe, and thee; that if thou performe me not thy promise and oath, I will denie thee my blessing, and depriue thee of my lands. Argentier.  De Salez hauing receiued this his fathers letter in Tholouse , exceedingly grieues to see him disgrace his mistresse, by the scandalous name of a strumpet, which he knowes she is not, and therefore will neuer beleeue it; yea, he vowes, that if it were any other in the world, who had offered him that intollerable affront, he would reuenge it, though with the price and perill of his life; La Hay perceiues this discontent and alteration of mirth in him, but from what point of the Compasse this wind proceeds, she neither knowes, nor as yet can conceiue: but withall, determineth to make the discouery thereof her greatest Ambition , and not her least Care ; which she now well knowes it behooues her to doe, sith she finds De Salez lesse free, and more reserued and pensiue in her speeches then accostomed: But when in vaine she had hereunto vsed many smiles and fetches, loe heere falls out an vnlook't for accident, which bewrayes her the very pith and quintescence of the Misterie: For on a time, when he lay slumbering on the table, shee as accustomed, diuing into his pockets for sweet meats, or rather for gold (of both which, he many times went well furnished) she finds his fathers (aforesaid) letter, which she knew by the direction; and so flying into another chamber, and bolting the doore after her, she there reads it both with griefe and choller; when stunge to the quicke, and bitten to the heart and gall, to see her reputation and Honour thus traduced and scandalized by the father of her pretended husband; she with teares and interiected sighes and grones, flies backe to De Salez , and holding the letter in her hand, like a desembling and impious strumpet as she was, there shewes it him, takes Heauen and Earth to beare witnesse of her innocency, and of the irreparable and extreame wrong his father hath offered her, in seeking to ecclips the Glory of her chastitie, which she sweares she will beare pure and vnspotted, not onely to his bed, but to her owne graue. But Alas, alas , these are the effects and passions of dissimulation, not of truth, of her prophanenesse, not of her pietie, which time will make apparant to De Salez ; though now her beautie and teares be so predominate with his iudgement and folly, as he cannot, because he will not see it: So being still as constant in his sottishnesse, as she in her hypocrisie; he giues her many sweet kisses, and with a Catalogue of sugred words, seekes to appease and comfort her, whom he hath farre more reason to execrate and curse. But for her part, her heart is not so afflicted, for resembling her selfe, still her wits are her owne, and so remembring the conclusion of the letter, and fearing that De Salez his promise and oath to his father, might infringe and contradict his to her, she tels him, that her loue is so feruent and infinite towards him, as she can giue no intermission, nor truce to her teares, before he reueale her his oath and promise, which his fathers letter informed her he had formerly made him. De Salez seeing himselfe put to so strict an exigent and push, doth both blush for shame, and againe looke pale for anger, when for a small time, irresolute how to beare himselfe in a matter of this different Nature , wherin he must either violate his obedience to his father, or infringe his fidelity and honour to his mistris; he at last (consenting with folly, not with discretion, and with Vanitie , not with Iudgement ) doth so adore her beauty, and commiserate her teares, as he sottishly reueales her his oath, giuen his father ( Verbatim as we haue formerly vnderstood it) adding withall, that she hath farre more reason to reioyce, then grieue hereat; That a little time shall cancell his said late promise and oath to his father, and confirme his former to her: For sweet La Hay (quoth he) come what come will, two moneths shall neuer passe, ere I marry thee, when sealing his speeches with many kisses, our hypocriticall afflicted Gentlewoman is presently againe come to her selfe, and in all outward appearance, her discontents are remoued, her choller pacified, her teares exhaled, and her sighes euaporated and blowen away. But all this is false, like her selfe, and trecherous like her beautie; For this letter of Argentier to his sonne, and his promise and oath to his father, hath acted such wonders in her heart, and imprinted such extrauagancies in her thoughts, as she cannot easily remoue or supplant it, nor difficulty forget or deface it, whatsoeuer she speake or make shew of to the contrary, for thus she reasoneth with her selfe: That her whoredomes are already reuealed to Argentier , and for any thing she knowes, may likewise be discouered to his sonne, how closely soeuer she either act or conceale them. That La Franges descent, wealth, and vertues, will in the end ouerprise and weigh downe her meane extraction, pouerty and beauty; and in the end, that the wisedome of the father, will infallibly triumph ore the folly of the sonne, except her policy interpose, and her vigilency preuent it; which to preuent and effect, she sees no other obstacle to her content, nor barre to her preferment, but only La Frange: for, quoth she, if La Frange shine in the firmament of De Salez affection, La Hay must set; or if La Hay will shine, La Frange must set: againe, if she fall not, I cannot stand, and if she stand, I must needs fall; and as the skie is not capable of two sunnes, so both of vs cannot shine in the Horison of his heart and thoughts at once: except thus, that La Hay may liue to see La Frange his wife, and her selfe his strumpet, when burning with false zeale to De Salez , and true inueterate malice to La Frange , she forgetting God, swaps a bargaine with the diuell, that La Frange must first goe to her graue, ere La Hay come to his bed, and so resolues to sacrifice her as a Victime to her malice and ielousie, and to send her out of this world in an vntimely and bloody Coffin; Hellish Aphorismes , Infernall Positions , odious to Earth , and execrable to Heauen . For wretched & impious strumpet, wilt thou needs not onely gallop, but flie to hell, and so redouble thy crimes purposely to redouble thy tormets, as first of whoredome, then of murther: Wretched, yea thrice wretched woman, how darest thou see earth, or thinke of heauen; when thy acted crimes are so odious, and thy pretended ones so monstrous, as thou deseruest to be shut foorth of the one, and spewed out of the other: For alas , consider what this poore Gentlewoman hath done to thee, that thou shouldest doe this to her; She beares the image of God , and wilt thou therefore beare that of the diuell to destroy her: Ah me, where is thy religion, thy conscience, thy soule; that thou wilt thus hellishly imbathe thy hands in her blood, and embrue thy heart in her murther; If it be not that her vertues cry fie on thy Vices , thou hast no reason in Nature , and lesse in Grace , to attempt a deed so Tragicall, an act so inhumane and execrable: But rest assured, that if thou proceed and finish this infernall and bloody stratageme of thine, although thou chance goe vnpunished of men; yet the Lord (in his due time) will finde thee out, and both seuerely scourge, and sharpely reuenge and chastice thee. The effects of malice, and reuenge in men, are finite; in women infinite, theirs may haue bounds and ends, but these none, or at least, seldome and difficultly: for hauing once conceiued these two monsters in their fantasies and braines, they long til they are deliuered and disburthened of them; and so to bring their abortiue issue to perfection, they (for the most part) are sharpe and seuere in their designes, and sudden and malicious in their executions, hating all delayes, so it bee not to doe euill: So this our bloodie and vitious Strumpet La Hay , is resolute to aduaunce, and not to retyre in this diabolicall businesse of hers. Of all kind of violent deaths, shee thinks none either so sure  & secret as poyson; whether she consider the manner, or the matter: If the Deuill himselfe had not inuented this vnparaleld cruelty, his agents and members had neuer knowen how to haue administred and practised it. But hauing resolued on the drug and ingrediens, she now bethinkes her selfe of some hellish Empericke or Factor of Hell, to apply and giue it her, and her inueterate and implacable hatred making her curious in the research and inquiry thereof: shee is at last aduertised, that there is an old Italian Empericke in Mompellier , tearmed S. Bernardo Michaele , who is his Arts master in that infernall profession, when wholly concealing this mysterie and businesse from De Salez , shee by a second meanes, (with promise of store of gold) sends away for Michaele from Mompellier: who in hope thereof, packs vp his drugges and trinkets, and within three dayes arriues at Tholouse ; where she thinkes no where so fit and secret as the Church to consult and resolue on this bloody busines, the houre is eight the next morn, and the place the Cordeliers (or Gray Friers ) Church, appoynted and agreed on betwixt them, where they both meet. But shee (the better to disguise her selfe, and to bleare the eyes of the world) wraps her selfe about in a great furred cloake, and muffles her selfe vp with a large coyfe of veluet, and a rich taffata scarfe ouer it, as if she were some graue and reuerend old Matron: so being brought to each others presence, they being both on their knees, he to his Book, and shee to her Beads, shee proposeth him the poysoning of La Frange , daughter to the President de Clugny , for the which shee promiseth to giue him three hundred crownes of the Sunne to performe it; wherof he shall now haue one in hand, and the other two when he hath dispatched her. Michaele like a limbe of the Deuill, being deeply in loue, and allured with this gold, vndertakes it; when swearing secrecy, and withall to performe it within ten dayes, she giues him the hundred crownes tyed vp in her handkercher, and so for that time they part. Good God , what prophane Christians , what monsters of Nature , and Deuils incarnate by profession are these, thus to pollute and defile the Church ordain'd for prayer, with the price and sale of innocent blood, a most prodigious and hellish impietie, since there is no sinne so odious or execrable to God , as that which is masked with pietie, and oueruay led with the cloke of sanctitie? And what a damnable yong strumpet, and old villaine are they, in so holy a place to treate and conclude so hellish a businesse? But beware, for the sword and arrow of Gods iust reuenge, and reuenging Iustice, threatens yee with no lesse, then vtter confusion and destruction. La Hay infinitely glad of this agreement, returnes from the Church, and Michaele as glad of her gold, (being informed of La Franges deformity, and to lose no time) trips away towards President de Clugny his house, taking that for a fit occasion to assay to make his daughter become his Patient, and he her Empericke: who fleeringly insinuating, and skrewing himselfe into his knowledge and acquaintance, (in which profession the Emperickes and Mountebanks of Italy , come no way short, but rather exceed all other Nations of the world) he proffers him his best seruice and skill, to redresse and reforme the body of the young Lady his daughter, adding withall (thereby to adde the more beliefe and credit to his speeches) that he is so farre from dispayring or doubting, as he is very confident thereof: and in the phrases and mysteries of his profession, giues him in outward appearance many inward and plausible reasons to induce him to beleeue it. The good old President who preferring the cure of his daughter before any other earthly respect; hauing heard of Michaeles fame: begins to relish his reasons, and yet not ignorant that the Mountbanckes and Charletans of Italy , are Cousin Germanes to the Alcumists of France , who promise to make gold of drosse, and yet only bring forth drosse for gold, he holds it fit to take a consultation of the learnedst Physicians , and expert Chirurgions of the City, whereunto Michaele willingly consents, so they sit, being sixe in number, Michaele deliuers them his reasons to redresse the deformity of this young Ladies body (the President her father being present) whose reasons are heard, and controuerted of all sides betwixt them, the conclusion is, foure are of opinion that this cure is repugnant to the grounds of Physicke , and the principles of Chirurgery , and therfore impossible to be effected: the other two are of a contrary iudgement, and held it feasable, and that many times God blesseth the Art and labours of a man, not onely beyond expectation, but also beyond hope and reason: so De Clugny seeing that these two with Michaele were three against foure, he in respect of the tender care and affection he bore his daughter, resolues to employ him, and giues him an hundred double Pistollets in hand to attempt it, with promise of as much more when hee hath performed it; whereof this miscreant and hellish Empericke Michaele being exceedingly glad, he betakes himselfe to his businesse, visits the young Lady, who promiseth him to redouble her fathers summe, if he make her body straight: when to reduce his impious contemplation, into infernall action, he outwardly applieth playsters and feare-clothes to her body, and inwardly administreth her pills and potions; and (O griefe to write it) therein infuseth deadly poyson, which hee knowes at the end of ten dayes will assuredly make a diuorce betweene her body and soule; and so send that to the death of this world, and this to the life of that to come: So this sweete and innocent Lady (wishing good to her selfe, and hurt to none in the world) first finds a giddinesse  & swimming in her head; and within some six dayes after (in which time the poyson had dispersed it selfe throughout all the veynes and pores of her body) many sharpe gripes, and bitter throwes and convulsions, whereat her father grieues, and shee weepes; onely that gracelesse villaine her Empericke , bids them bee of good comfort, and that the more paine and griefe she suffered, the better and speedyer hope there was of her cure; but yet inwardly in his deuillish heart, knowes that the poyson effectually operated and wrought with her as hee desired and expected, and that by these infallible signes and symptomes, his patient drew neere towards the period of her end. Wherevpon he repaires secretly to La Hay , and bids her prouide the rest of his mony; for that La Frange could not possibly liue two dayes to an end, whereat she tryumphing and reioycing with much alacrity, againe promiseth it him: and indeed the hellish Art of this execrable Empericke doth not now deceiue him, though in the end the malice of the deuill his Doctor will: For iust as the tenth day was expired, this harmelesse sweet young Lady dyes, to the incomparable and vnspeakable griefe of the good old President her father; for that she was the staffe of his age, and the chiefe and onely comfort of his life, who disconsolatly and mournfully seemed to drown himselfe in his teares hereat, cursing the houre that he first saw this accursed Empericke Michaele , who had robbed him of his onely ioy and delight, of his deare and sweete daughter La Frange . But this murdrous Michaele hauing learnt of the deuill to feare no colours, meanes not to step a foot from Tholouse , and so sends priuately for La Hay , of whom he craues the performance of her promise, for that (quoth he) hee had performed his. Why (quoth La Hay ) is that crookbackt dwarfe La Frange dead? She is gone (quoth Michaele ) to her eternall rest: when La Hay not able to retaine her selfe for excesse of ioy, runs to him, giues him the other hundred crownes, together with many kisses, which take (quoth she) as a pledge of my continuall good wil towards thee, when again swearing secresie, they both take leaue each of other, and part. The newes of La Franges death, ratleth and resoundeth ouer all Tholouse , her kinsefolkes grieue at it, her friends lament it, and all who eyther know her, or her fame, bewayle it, onely De Salez , and execrable La Hay excepted, who knowing her to haue beene the onely stop and hinderance of their mariage, they are so rauished with ioy heereat, as they seeme to contest and enuy each other, who shall first bring the newes hereof each to other: yea, the excesse of De Salez his ioy is as boundlesse, as that of La Hayes delight, so that he seemes to flye to her to her fathers house, where shee with out-spread armes receiues and entertaines him; and there they mutually congratulate each other for this her death, he affirming, and she bleeuing, that La Frange being gone to heauen, it shall not bee long ere the Church make them man and wife on earth. In the meane time, hee being wholly ignorant of her poysoning, and yet the olde President her father, and the rest of her friends suspecting it, they cause her body to be opened: and although they finde no direct poyson, yet remarking a little kind of yellow tincture on her heart and liuer, as also some shew thereof through her frozen veines: They cause Michaele to be apprehended and imprisoned, and so procure a Decree from the Parliament to haue him rack'd: At the newes wherof, La Hay is extreamely tormented and perplexed, as well foreseeing and knowing, that her life lay at the mercy of his tongue: wherfore to fortifie his secrecie, and therby to secure her owne feare  & danger, she by a confident friend of his, sends him a hundred French crownes more, and promiseth him to giue him a rich Diamond worth as much againe; who (as before) being extreamely couetous, and the Deuill (resembling himselfe) still harping to him on that string which most delights him, his heart is so deuillishly obdurated, and his fortitude so armed and prepared, as his patience and constancy not onely endures, but outbraues the crueltie of his torments; and so he is acquitted of this his pretended crime: but he hath not as yet made his peace with God. And now is De Salez resolued to make a Iourney to Paris , to draw his fathers consent that he may marry La Hay , but the wisedome of the father shall anticipate the folly of the Sonne , for he hauing heard in Paris of La Franges death, and still fearing, that because of his frequent familiarity with that strumpet La Hay , he will in the end marry her. He in Paris buyes a Captaines place for him in the Regiment of the Kings Guard, and likewise dealt with a very rich Counsellour of that Court of Parliament , named Monsieur de Brianson , that his sonne may marry his eldest daughter: Madamoyselle de Plessis , a very sweet and faire young Gentlewoman ; and the old folkes are already agreed on all conditions, onely it rests, that the yong, sees and loue; To which end Argentier writes away with all speed to Tholouse for his sonne De Salez to come vp to him, who before he had receiued his fathers letter, (as we haue formerly vnderstood) was ready to vndertake that Iourney: La Hay infinitely fearefull and ielous to lose her pray, with Crocodile teares in her eyes, and Hyena aspects in her lookes, informes De Salez , that she feareth that his father hath prouided a wife for him in Paris , but he vowes and sweares to her, that neither his father, nor the whole world, shall make him marry any other then herselfe, and so after many embraces and kisses, he takes horse and leaues Tholouse . Being arriued at Paris , his father very ioyfully bids him welcome, and referres to conferre with him till the next morning; but such is De Salez rashnesse and folly, as hee hath no sooner supped in company of his father, but he prayes to speake with him. When the seruants voyding the chamber, he earnestly and humbly beseeching him, that sith La Frange is dead, he will now be pleased that he may marry La Hay , whom, quoth he, I onely affect and loue before all the maides of the world: His father exceedingly incensed hereat, vowes that he had rather see him fairely buried in his graue, and that of all the females of the world, he shall not marry La Hay: and so for that night they betake themselues to their beds, the father grieues with his sonnes folly, the sonnes with his fathers auersnesse: The next morne Argentier calles for his sonne. When the doores shut, he bids him shut his eyes to his foolish familiarity with La Hay ,, and now to open them to the preferment, he hath purchased him, and so relates him how he hath procured him the honour of a Captaines place, in the Regiments of the Kings Guard, as also a very faire young Gentlewoman for his wife, tearmed Madamoyselle de Plessis , the eldest daughter of Monsieur de Brianson , one of the richest Counsellours of Paris: But De Salez hauing his eyes and thoughts wholly fixed on La Hay , with a discontented looke, returnes his father this peruerse and disobedient replie. That he will not accept of the Captaines place, nor once see De Plessis , but that he is constantly resolued, either to wed La Hay , or his graue, whereat his father is so extreamely incensed, as with much passion and choller, he commands him henceforth, not to dare so much as to name him La Hay , swearing by his Sauiour ; that for his obstinacy and disobedience, hee will disinherite him, as indeed he might, hauing himselfe purchased three parts of his lands and reuenewes, through his care and industry in his profession, and so much discontent and choller, leaues in his Coleagues of Tholouse , who are already wayting and attending his comming. De Salez is all on fire at this his fathers bitter resolution against him, and stormes and fumes, not onely beyond the bonds of reason, religion, and humanity; but also beyond himselfe. For fith La Hay is his sole delight  & ioy, & that his father hath vowed he shall neuer mary her; his affectio to her, makes him resolue to dispatch his father: yea, his head conceiues such murtherous thoughts, & his heart atracts, & assumes such degenerate and diuelish blood against him, that like an execrable wretch, and a hellish sonne, disdayning to take Counsell from God , and therefore taking it from the diuell his bloody Tutor and Abettor , he vowes he will foorthwith rid his hands of his father, and that he will therefore send him into another world, because he would giue him no content in this. Oh wretched monster of Nature , Limbe of the diuell, nay a very diuell thy selfe, thus to resolue to take his life from him that gaue thee thine; Foule staine of mankind, bloody Paracydious miscreant, can no respect either of thy naturall and filliall obedience to thy kind and deere father, or of his white haires, and venerable old age, restraine thee? or no consideration of thy conscience or thy soule, of heauen or hell deterre thee from this bloody, inhumane, and damnable designe of thine, in laying violent hands on him? O me, where are thy thoughts, where thy senses; where thy heart, thy soule, to act so execrable and infernall a Tragidie , on him without whom thou hadst not been: on thy father, whom by the laws of Heauen and Earth , thou oughtest both to loue, honour, reuerence and obey. But De Salez being resolute in this inhumane rage,  & implacable malice & furie, watcheth how he may take time at aduantage, to effect and finish this his bloody businesse, and on a night after supper, hearing his old father complaine that he found himselfe not well, and commanding his Clarke De Buissie , very earely in the next morning to carry his water to Doctor Salepin , a famous Physician , whose chamber was farre off, in the place Maubert , he himselfe lying in Grennelles street: De Salez thinkes this a fit opportunity to dispatch his father, the which, O a thousand griefes and pitties to speake off, he accordingly performeth. For the morne appearing, his father hauing sent away his Clarke with his water, and betaking himselfe to sleepe till his returne. His watchfull and murtherous sonne, hauing purposely made himselfe ready; and through the key hole and cranies of his chamber doore, espying his father sleeping, he intends that this shall be his last sleepe: When softly stealing into his chamber, he (incouraged and animated by the diuell) and approaching his bed, as exempt of feare as grace, without any more delay or circumstance, stifles his father betwixt two pillowes; when leauing him breathlesse in his bed, his face exposed to the ayre, and the doore shut, goes downe, giues the master of the house, the good morrow, and so trips away as fast as he can, to the signe of the swan within Saint Honnoryes Gate; and from thence rides away to Saint Clow , (two leagues distant from Paris ) to see Gondyes gardens, fountaines, and house wherein that execrable and damnable Iacabine Frier, Iaques Clement murthered Henry the third king of France , but with an intent to returne to his fathers lodging immediatly after dinner, and to plead ignorance of the fact, and withall if occasion serue to stand vpon his innocency, and iustification, as indeed he did. Now his fathers Clarke De Buissye , returning in the morning from Doctor Salepin , entering his masters chamber, finds him starke dead; and almost cold in his bed: whereat he makes many bitter outcries and grieuous exclamations: the man of the house hereat ascends the chamber, infinitely laments, grieues at this sorrowfull accident and spectacle; Vowes to De Buissye that he saw none who so euer in his house, much lesse in his masters chamber, and that his sonne Mounsieur de Salez departed assoone as he himselfe: they search his body, and find it no way wounded, so they beleeue and resolue that some pangue hath carried him away; Yet they hold it rather wisedome then folly to acquaint the Lieutenant Cryminall therewith; fearing least he might after suspect either violence or poyson: So he comes, conferres with his sonne De Salez , with his Clarke De Buissye , and with the man of the house, he visites the dead body, findes onely his head somewhat swollen, which his Physicions affirme, may be his striuing and struggling with death. When the Lieutenant out of his zeale and integritie to Iustice; hauing informed himselfe of Doctor Salepin , of De Buissyes being with him, as also from Saint Clou of his sonne De Salez , being there timely in the morning, and withall, that his Trunkes were all safe, and nothing wanting; they banish all suspition, aud without farther enquiry, or doubt, commend the dead corps to the graue: Whose funerall with exteriour shew of extreame griefe and sorrowe De Salez performes in Paris , with all Decency and Decorum , answerable in all respects to his fathers ranke and qualitie. But we shall shortly see this maske of his diuellish hypocrisie puld off, and this inhumane paracide of his, both shamefully, and sharpely reuenged, by the iust iudgement and finger of God: The manner is thus: This harmeles and innocent old father Argentier , is no sooner laid in his vntimely graue, but his bloody and execrable sonne De Salez , within eight dayes after, leaues Paris , and returnes to Tholouse , where already this sorrowfull newes is dispersed and diuulged, being for his vertues and integritie of life, generally bewayled of the whole Citie, onely gracelesse and impudent La Hay triumphs hereat, and her very heart and thoughts daunce for ioy heereof: she welcomes home her De Salez , with a world of sweet and sugred kisses; who as glad of her presence, returnes her them with a plentifull and prodigall interest; but his lustfull loue to her is so feruent, and his folly in himselfe so peruerse and obstinate; as he hath scarce the patience, much lesse the respect and modesty to weare blackes for his father sixe weekes, but casts them off; takes on gaudie, and scarlet apparell, and very solemnely marries La Hay: Whereby in respect of the inequallity of their descents and meanes: but especially, of her whorish conditions; he makes himselfe the laughter and May-game of all Tholouse . But good God , what a prodigious and hellish match is this, sith man and wife, and both are murtherers; O execrable and miserable wretches, O bloody and impious miscreants, for sure if this marriage of yours proue happy, I may boldly and truely say, there will neuer any proue vnfortunate and miserable: For Alas, alas , what doe those impious and damnable crimes of theirs deserue and portend; but misery, ruine, and confusion of all sides? neither shall the curiositie of our enquiry carry vs farre, before we see it surprise and befall them. For before they had been fully married three moneths, De Salez reaping his desires, and feasting himselfe with the pleasures of her youth; he directly, contrary to his hopes  & expectation, is enforced to see & know, that which before he wold haue thought neuer to haue known or seen: for thinking his wife to haue been a modest & chast Diana , he now sees she is a deboshed Layis: yea, his misery is so great, as he needs no spectacle to see, that she dayly makes him a Knight of the forked order; and almost euery houre, despight of his care and ielousie, claps a cuckowes feather in his hat: which to preuent and remedie, he first administreth requests and perswasions, and then complaines to her father; But these are too weake reasons and too gentle motiues, to preuaile with so insatiable a strumpet; so as he is constrained to adde threats to his requests, and in the end blowes to his threats. But as it is impossible for the Leopard to change his skin, and the  Æthiopian his hew, so De Salez sees it labour lost to thinke to reclayme his wife from her beastly sinne of adultery, wherein (notwithstanding all that possible he can doe) she takes such a delight and habite, as by this time she is growne so extreamely impudent, as when her husband is at home, she is abroad ranging; and he is no sooner abroad, but she is instantly at home reuelling with her ruffians: Yea, she is growen to that hight of obscenity, as she contemns and sleights her husband; that whither he be abroad or at home, she will play the whore before his face with open doores: which although it be too late for him to remedy, yet it bites him to the heart,  & grieues him to the gall: & now it is that he a thousand times thinkes of his fathers aduise and councell in forsaking her; and as often wisheth he had followed it. Now it is that his vnnaturall murthering of his father, thunders foorth horror, terror, and repentance to his foule and guilty conscience; and now it is that he wisheth from his heart and soule, that he had beene blind when he first saw her, and fairely laid in his graue before he first lay with her in bed. But these his complaints and griefes, bring him onely vexation and misery insteed of comfort; for now he vtterly dispaires, and sees no hope of his wiues reformation: Whereupon he resolues to diuorce himselfe from her, & to that end takes counsell thereon: but it is not so secretly managed by him, but the strumpet his wife hath present notice and inckling thereof, whereupon seeing her husband exceeding rich, both in-lands, coyne, plate, and other rich houshold-stuffe, she vowes not to quite her great ioynter share and interest heereof thus. But before he had inrolled his suite in the Spirituall Court, or any way vented his owne shame, and his wiues infamy in publicke, she like a true Courtisan, and debaushed strumpet as she was, vowes to preuent him that would preuent her, and to send him to his death that would seeke to diuorce her; and in respect of his ielousie and malice, that as shee had formerly poisoned La Frange for her husbands sake, so shee would now murther him for her owne. But miserable and execrable wretch, Oh to what a monstrous height and huge summe will all those thy beastly sinnes, and bloody enormities arise and amount vnto? But Lust, Malice , and Reuenge like three infernall furies, so possesse and preoccupate her senses, as shee will not retyre, till shee hath sent her husband into another world in a bloody winding-sheet. To which end, watching the time when most of her seruants were gone abroad to gather in the Vintage, shee softly opening her husbands chamber doore, steales in, and finding him soundly sleeping, approcheth his bed, when drawing foorth a rasor from her sleeue, which shee had purposely prouided, shee with an implacable and damnable malice steps to him, and cuts his throat, speaking onely these words to her selfe: Loe heere the reward of thy Ielousie ; when throwing the knife, and her outward Taffata Gowne into the house of office, she leauing him weltring in his blood, very secretly conueyes her selfe through the Gallery to the Garden, where her wayting Gentlewoman attends her, and so hyes away to the Church, thinking with a wretched impiety to cloake this her second murther, as her former, vnder the vaile of religion and piety: but her hopes, and the Deuill that gaue them her, will now deceiue her. De Salez , her husband striuing and strugling for life against the pangs of death: feare and haste (contrary to her intent and minde) had so made his murtherous wifes hand shake and tremble, as shee did not so fully cut his throat boale, but hee could yet both crie and groane, which he did very mournfully, and which indeed was soone ouer-heard by a man and a maydseruant of his, who only remained in the house, who hearing their masters voyce, and hastily running vp, at these his pitifull and lamentable out-cryes; stepping to his assistance, they heare him (with his best power) vtter these fearefull speeches, That Strumpet my wife hath kill'd mee: O that shee-Deuill my wife hath murthered me . Whereat they cry out at the windows to the neighbours for helpe, alledging that their master is murthered. The neighbours assemble,  & heare him report so much: so they send away for his Confessor, and the Lieutenant Criminall , to both whom he againe confesseth, That it is the Strumpet his wife who hath murthered him: And then raysing himselfe vp in his bed (with as much strength as his dying wound would permit him) he taking them both by the hands, with infinit sighes and teares reueales to them, that he it was, who at the seducing of the Deuill, had stifled his father Argentier to death in Paris , that he did it onely to marry this whoore his murtherous wife La Hay ; that the killing of his father, yea the very remembrance thereof infinitely grieues his heart and soule, and for the which he infinitely repenteth himselfe, and beseecheth the Lord of mercy, in mercy to forgiue it him; and likewise prayed all that were present to pray vnto God for him: and these were his last wordes, for now his fleeting and fading breath would permit him to say no more. All that were present, are amazed at this lamentable confession of his, to see that hee should murther his father, and his execrable wife, well neere himselfe; so they all glorified God for the detection and discouery hereof: But the Lieutenant Criminell , and the Councellors his Associates step to the window, and consult to haue him hanged, whiles hee is yet liuing, for the murthering of his father. But De Salez saues them that labour: for there and then he sinkes into his bed, and dyes away before them: so they instantly search the house and Citie for this wretched Murtheresse La Hay , whom impious and bloody strumpet they at last finde in the Domincan Friers Church at a Sermon, from whence with much obloquy and indignitie they drag her to prison, where they charge her with the murther of her husband De Salez , which the Deuill as yet will not permit her to confesse; but being adiudged by them to the Racke, she at the very first torment confesseth it. Vpon which seuerall murthers, the Criminell Iudges of the Tournelles proceed to sentence: so first they adiudge the dead body of De Salez for so inhumanly murdring his father Argentier , to be half a day hangd by the heeles to the common gallows, and then to be burnt to ashes, which is accordingly executed: then they adiudge his wife La Hay , for murthering him, the next day to be strangled, then burnt: so that night some Diuines deale with her in prison about the state of her soule, whom they finde infinitely obdurated through the vanitie of her youth, and the temptations of the Deuill; but they worke effectually with her, and so at last (by the mercies of God) drawe her to contrition and repentance, when willing her not to charge her soule with the concealing of any other crime; and shewing her the dangers thereof, shee very freely, yet sorrowfully, confesseth; how shee it was, that for three hundred crownes had caused the Empericke Michaele to poyson La Frange , for the which shee told them she was now exceedingly repentant and sorrowfull: Whereof the Diuines (sith it was not deliuered them vnder the seale of Confession) aduertising the Iudges, they all wonder at Gods prouidence, to see how all these murthers are discouered and burst foorth, one in the necke of the other; so they alter her sentence, and for these her double murthers, they condemne her to haue her right hand cut off, and then to be burnt aliue: and so they make curious inquiry and research to apprehend this old bloody varlet Michaele . In the meane time, that very afternoone, this miserable and murtherous Curtesan La Hay , though to the griefe of her sorrowfull father and sisters, yet to the ioy of all Tholouse , is brought and fastned to her stake, where her hand being first strucke off, she with many sighes and teares deliuereth these few words: That her crimes were so foule and odious, as shee was ashamed to looke either God or man in the face; That she was very sorrowfull for causing La Frange to be poysoned, as also for murthering of her husband De Salez , whose wealth she onely affirmed she loued, but not himselfe, the which she wholly attributed to the lust and vanitie of her youth, to her neglect of prayer and forsaking of God; which made the Deuill so strong with her, and shee with the Deuill: and which was the sole cause and ground of this her miserable ruine and destruction; she with teares and prayers besought the Lord to be good vnto her soule; and (lifting vp her eyes and hands to Heauen) likewise beseech the whole assembly to pray heartily vnto God for her: when recommending her soule into the hands of her Redeemer, the fire being alighted, her body was soone consumed to ashes, whose lamentable, yet iust end and punishment, caused a number of spectators to weepe, as yet pitying her youth and beautie, as much as they detested the enormitie of her crimes. And now for this deuillish and murtherous Empericke Michaele , although as soone as he heard of La Hayes imprisonment, he (to saue himselfe) left Tholouse , and fled towards Castres , disguised in a Friers habit, with his beard shauen: yet by the care of the Court of Parliament , or rather by the immediat finger and prouidence of God, he is found out, and brought back to Tholouse , where for poysoning of La Frange , (the which he now without the Racke confesseth) he is adiudged to be broken on the Wheele, there to remaine till he be dead, and then his body to be thrown into the Riuer of Garrone: the which the same day is accordingly executed and performed, to the infinite ioy of all the spectators: but as he liued an Atheist , so he desperatly died a Deuill, without any shew at all, either of contrition or repentance; onely he vomited forth this wretched speech, That because the world had so much to say to him, he would say nothing to the world, but bade the Executioner dispatch him. Now by the sight of this mournefull and bloody History , the Christian Reader may obserue and see how Gods reuenge doth still triumph against murther, and how he in his due time and prouidence doth assuredly still detect and punish it. It is a History which may serue to deterre and forwarne all yong Gentlemen , not to frequent the companies of whores and strumpets; and all sonnes not to transgresse the will of their parents, much lesse not dare to lay violent hands on them. It is a glasse wherin yong Gentlewomen & Wiues may at life see, what bitter fruits and sharpe ends euer attend on Whordome and Murther: It is a liuely Example for all kind of Empericks and Drugsters whatsoeuer, to consider how seuerely God doth infallibly reuenge and punish the poysoning of his Saints and children . In a word, it is a Lesson and Caueat for all people, and for all degrees of people, but especially of Christians , (who professe the Gospell of Christ ) not onely to detest these foule sinnes of Reuenge and Murther in others, but to hate and abhorre them in their selues: which that all may endeauour to practise and performe, graunt good God , who indeed art the onely giuer of all goodnesse. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE Against the crying and execrable Sinne of Murther. History XII.  Albemare causeth Pedro and Leonardo to murther Baretano , and he after marrieth Clara , whom Baretano first sought to marry: He causeth his man Valerio to poyson Pedro in prison, and by a letter which Leonardo sent him, Clara perceiues that her husband Albemare had hired and caused Pedro and Leonardo to murther her first loue Baretano ; which letter she reueales to the Iudge, so he is hanged, and likewise Valerio and Leonardo for these their bloody crimes.  lift vp our eyes to that of Heauen , when our thoughts are so rebellious to conspire, and our hearts and resolutions so cruell, to embrue our hands in the innocent blood of our harmelesse and Christian brethren: Thoughts they are, which in seeming to please our senses, poyson our soules, (and doe therefore truely poyson our soules, because they so falsly please our senses,) Resolutions they are, which we cannot conceiue or attempt with more inhumanity, then finish with misery. Sith in thinking to send them to their vntimely graues, we assuredly send our selues to our owne miserable and infamous ends; whereof in this ensuing History , we shall find many wofull Presidents , and mournefull examples, in diuers vnfortunate and wretched persons, who were borne to happinesse, not to infamy; to prosperity, not to misery. If they had had so much Grace to secure their liues, as Vanitie , and Impietie to ruine them; It is a History purposely produced,  & penned, for our detestation, not for our imitation: Sith it is a poynt of (true and happie) wisdome in all men to beware by other mens harmes; Read it then with a full intent to profit thy selfe thereby, and so thou mayest boldly, and safely rest assured, that the sight of their sinnes and punishments, will proue the reformation of thine owne. populous, and rich Citie of Milan (the Capitall of that Dutchie) the place where the Scene of this mournefull  & Tragicall History is layen where perpetrated: The which to refetch from 'its first spring and Orginall , thereby the more truely to informe our curiositie, and instruct our knowledge: We must then vnderstand, that long since the Duke of Feria succeeded the Count De Fuentes , as Vice-roy of that potent and flourishing Dutchie, for King Philip the third of Spaine his master: There was natiue and resident in that Citie an ancient Nobleman , tearmed Seigneor Leonardo Capello , who in his younger yeares had married a Spanish Lady, and brought her from Spaine to Milan ) tearmed Dona Maria de Castiana: He exceeding rich and noble, and she as noble and faire; he by his fathers side allied to Cardinall Charles Barromeo (since Sainted by Pope Paul V. ) shee by her mother to the present Duke of Albucurque , hee infinitely honoured for his extraction and wealth: she no lesse beloued and respected for her beautie and vertues: and although there are but few mariages contracted betweene the Millaneses and Spaniards , and those very seldome proue succesful and prosperous, in respect of the antipathy, which (for the most part) is hereditary betwixt the commands of the Spanyards , and the subiection of the Millaneses: yet it seemed that this of Capello and Castiana was first instituted in heauen, ere consummated on earth; for so sweetly did their yeres humours and affections conioyne and sympathize, as although they were two persons, yet I may truly affirme and say, they had but one heart, affection and desire, which was mutually to please, and reciprocally to affect and loue each other. And as Marriages cannot be reputed truly happy and fortunate, if they be not blessed and crowned with the blessings of children, (which indeed is not onely the sweetest life of humane content, but also the best and sweetest content of our humane life) so they had not been long maried, ere God honoured them and their nuptiall bed, with a beautifull and delicate and young daughter, tearmed Dona Clara , the onely childe of their loynes, and heyre of their lands and vertues, being indeed the true picture of themselues, and the ioyfull pledge and seale of their intire and inuiolable affections; who hauing ouerpast her Infancy, and obtayned the eighteenth yeare of her age, she was so exquisitely adorned with beautie, and so excellently endued and enriched with vertues ; as distinctly for eyther, or ioyntly for both, she was, and was truely reputed, the Paragon of Nature , the pride of Beautie , the wonder of Millan , the glory of her Sex , and the Phenix of her Time . And because the puritie and perfection of her beautie deserues to be seene through this dimme Perspectiue, and the dignitie of her vertues knowen of the Reader in this my impolished relation. For the first, shee was of stature indifferently tall, but exceeding streight and slender: her haire either of a deepe Chessnut colour, or rather of a light black, but to which most adhering and inclining, fancy mought, but curiositie could dificultly distinguish; Her complexion and tincture, rather of an amorous and louely browne, then of a Roseat and Lillie die; but yet so sweetly pure,  & purely sweet: (and withall rather fat then leane) that no earthly obiect could more delight and please the eye, or rauish the sense. And for her eyes, those two relucent lamps and starres of loue, they were so blacke and piercing, that they had a secret and imperious influence, to drawe all other eyes to gaze and doe homage to hers; as if all were bound to loue her, and she so modest, as if purposely framed to loue none but her selfe: Neither did her Front, Lippes, Necke or Pappes any way detract, but euery way [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) to adde to the perfection of her other excellencies of Nature: For the first seemed to be the Promontory of the Graces , the second, the Residence of delight and pleasure; The third the Pyramides of State and Maiestie ; And the fourth the Hills and Valley of loue. But leaue we the dainties of her body, now to speake of the rarities and excellencies of her mind, which I cannot rightly define, whether the curiositie and care of her parents in her education, or her owne ingenious and apt inclination to Vertue and Honour , were more predominant in her: for in either, or rather in both, shee was so exquisite and excellent, that in Languages, Singing, Musicke, Dancing, Wisdome, Temperance , and Modestie , she was so fully compleat and rare, that to giue her her due, and no more, shee could not be paraleld by any yong Lady of Lombardy , or Italy , nor equalliz'd but by her selfe. Thus if her noble extraction, and fathers wealth made her surmount others, and her delicious sweet beauty  & vertues excell her selfe, no maruell if those Adamants , and these excellencies draw diuers of the best Caualiers and chiefest Gallants both of Milan and Lombardy , to affect and seeke her in marriage; and indeed although shee be sought by diuers of them with much respect and honour, answerable in all regard to her ranke and quality; yet neither her parents, or selfe are so much importuned by any, as by Signior Giouani Albemare , a young noble Gentleman of the citie, who was adorned and fortified with these humane priuiledges, to bee well descended, rich, and of some twenty fiue yeares olde; a match in the eye and censure of the world, yea, and in al outward appearance correspondent and equiualent; if his generous perfections and vertues had paralleld hers, or if the candeur and sinceritie of her affection had not iustly transported her thoughts and heart from him, because she had formerly fixed and setled them on another Gentleman , younger of yeares then Albemare , but in all other respects, as well of Nature , as Fortune , euery way his superiour, named Signior Alphonsus Baretano , a young Gentleman of one of the noblest families of Millan , of some eighteene yeares old, whose father was lately deceased, and had left him sole heire to many rich lands and possessions; but (withall) exceedingly intangled in Law, and ingaged in many debts and morgages, whereinto the vanitie and prodigalitie of his youth had deeply precipitated and ingulphed him: which consequently reflecting and falling on his sonne, we shall see will proue a hinderance to his marriage, and an obstacle to his content and preferment. But to obserue some order and decorum in the conduction and dilation of this History, wee must briefly be informed, that as of all the Beauties of Lombardy, Albemare onely chiefly affected and loued Clara ; so of all the Caualiers of the world, Clara affected and loued no other but Baretano: for as conformitie of yeares, manners, and inclinations, breed a sympathie in affections; so they in their tender youth often frequented one the others company, sometimes at the Dauncing, and Musick Masters, but many times at Weddings, Feastes; and noble assemblies: being well neere as equall in age, as in complexion and stature. Againe, the vicinitie of their residence added much to the combining and inflaming of their affections: for they were opposite in nothing but in their mansion houses, from whose galleries and windowes many times publikely, but more often by stealth, their eyes could not refraine to tilt at each other, with the inuisible launces of loue and affection, which bred such a habit, and that habit so powerful a second Nature , that it was now become impossible for them not to gaze each on other: so as if the innocency of their purilitie, made them delight in each others fight and company with desire; so now their more riper yeares inforce them to desire it with delectation: for when as yet they were so yong, as they knew not the instinct and influence of Nature (which cannot bee taught by a more powerfull or ingenious Tutrix then her selfe) yet they neuer met but kissed, nor kissed, but as if their heart and thoughts checke their lippes for taking such short farwels each of other: But now when their years had proclamed them both very capable to march vnder the Standard of Hymen aeus: This Venus & that Adonis , for so her fresh beauty,  & his flourishing youth (with as much right as fame in Milan ,) generally entituled them: They felt some pleasure wanting, which as yet they could not find; and therefore no maruaile, if they desired to find that which they wanted: So as burning in affection each to other, Clara hearing spoken of a husband, infinitely wished that Baretano were hers; and when he heard of a wife, he ardently longed, and feruently desired that Clara were his: Neither can I rightly say, whether he were more affectionate in her constancy to her; or shee constant and resolute in her affection to him: so that as heretofore they hardly knew the way to kisse, now time (running on in her swift careere) had taught them to desire to marry: and that whereas formerly Baretano onely tearmed Clara his sweet Mayd, and she him her deare Friend: Now loue had suggested and giuen them new desires, and therefore new Epithites: for sometimes as well in earnest as in iest, he could not refraine to tearme her his sweet wife, nor she him her deare husband; and herein their tongues were onely but the outward Hearaulds of their inward hearts, as their hearts were of their more secret and retired desires. And as feruent loue, and true discretion, very seldome concurre and meet; so although affection made them rich in inuenting new inuentions to meet and kisse: yet they were so poore, or rather so blind in discretion, as they could not beare their affections in secresie and silence: but by this time they are bewrayed to their Parents, and diuulged to their acquaintance: but if any grieue and storme at this vnexpected newes, it is first Albemare , then Capello and Castiana , betwixt whom there was a secret promise, and verball contract, that he and no other should marry their daughter. Thus we see that Albemare & Baretano are become Competitors and Riualls in their affections, for either of them affect Clara as the mistris of their thoughts, and both adore her as the Queene Regent of their desires. But as they sympathize in their hopes to purchace her for their wife: So they differ in the meanes and progresse of their resolutions, how to obtaine her. For whiles Baretano sues the daughter before her Parents, so doth Albemare the Parents before their daughter: but what effects and ends, these beginnings will produce, ye shall shortly see, and they themselues very soone both feele and find. Capello and Castiana (as we haue formerly said) with much affliction and griefe, vnderstanding of their daughters affection to Baretano , and reciprocally of his to her, they (with much impatience and passion) relate it to Albemare , whose affection to Clara , hath made him so subtile towards them, as although his heart knowes this newes, yet he makes his tongue denie the knowledge thereof; when protesting of his intire and feruent affection to her: and that he must either wed her or his graue: they consult on their important businesse, how they may Dethronize Baretano , and set and inthronize Albemare in the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) chance and choyce of Clara's affection: As for Capello and Castiana , they so highly affect Albemares great and free estate, and so disdainefully hate the intricate incombrances of Baretano's , as they vow, there resolutions shall Sayle by the compasse of his desires; and he in exchange, that his affections and desires shall still steere their course by that of their resolutions: So from the matter of their agreement, they proceed to the manner how to effect it; To which end her father and mother single their daughter apart, and in mild and faire tearmes demand her, what hath past betwixt her and Baretano , and whether she be so simple and inconsiderate to take so poore a Gentleman for her husband, whose estate is so weake and small, as it cannot well maintaine himselfe, much lesse her; Clara already prepared and armed by her affection to receiue these, or the like speeches from her Parents, hauing twice or thrice metamorphosed the Lillies of her cheekes into Roses, very temperately and modestly returnes them this discreet and respectiue answere. That as she must needs affirme she is confident of Baretano's affection to her, so she must as truely denie, that as yet he had euer motioned her for marriage; which if he had, considering that his birth, meanes, and vertues were such as euery way deserued not only her equall but her superiour, she is enforced to reueale them, that she loues him so tenderly and deerely, as if her will and pleasure be not contradicted by theirs, it will be not onely her ioy but her felicity, to accept and take him for her husband, before all others of the world. But this modest answer of hers, they hold too peremptory for a child to giue, and Parents to receiue; as if it sauoured more of irrigular zeale to Baretano , then of due respect and obedience to themselues, yet the sooner to diuert her from her owne desires and resolutions to make her flexible to theirs, they as yet hold it fit, rather to continue mild then imperious towards her, and so by deprauing the deserts and debasing the merits of Baretano , to seeke to extoll and magnifie those of Albemare , as if the first were onely a foyle, and the second a rich Diamond , worthy of her affection and wearing: and indeed so exquisite and excellent a Caualeir , they depaint him to her in the richest frame and pompe of all his prayses, aswell of the endowments of mind, as of those of Fortune , that they leaue no insinuating Oratory vnessayed, nor perswasiue attempt vnattempted, to make her shake hands with Baretano , and consequently to extend her armes  & heart to receiue & retaine Albemare: But although she were yong in yeares and experience; yet loue in this fragrant and flourishing spring of her youth, had so refined her iudgement, and indoctrinated and prompted her tongue, that her thoughts commanded  & marshalled by her heart, and both by her desires and affection to Baretano , she confusedly intermixing, and interrupting her words with many far fetched broken sighes, againe returnes her Parents this reply. If your age will not, yet my youth or rather my heart informes me, that Baretano as far exceeds Albemare in the priuiledges of the mind and body, as Albemare doth him in those of Fortune , but that my resolutions and answeres, may answere and correspond with my obedience, although I loue Baretano , yet I will neuer hate, rather honour Albemare ; but to make him my husband, or my selfe his wife, if Earth haue, I hope Heauen hath not decreed it: And I humbly beseech yee, that this may rest your Resolution, as I assuredly thinke it shall and will remaine mine. Capello and Castiana (like discreet parents) seeing their daughter Clara wholly wedded (in a manner) to the singularitie of her owne will, they yet conceiue it to bee farre more requisite to reuert her reasons by faire meanes, then refute and refell them by force, sith loue and discretion hath still reference to that, and this relation still to choller, many times to repentance: wherupon minding her of the blessings which infallibly attend filiall obedience; and the miseries and curses which indiuidually wayt on contempt and disobedience, hoping that time will effect that which Importunitie cannot, they as then leaue her to her thoughts, and shee them to their care; caring for nothing so much, nay, I may wel say, for nothing else, then to see her affection diuorced from Baretano , and contracted and wedded to Albemare ; who hauing curious correspondence and intelligence with them, he is euer and anon acertained, not onely what hath, but what doeth passe betwixt them and their daughter; and withall, is aduised by them, to delay no time, but to frequent and haunt her as her Ghost and shaddow; yea, and no more to conceale his affection and suite from her, but to acquaint all Millan therewith, sith it was no disparagement, but rather an equall honour for him to match with Clara , and Clara with him. Which concluded betwixt Capello and Castiana, Albemare is so farre from reiecting this aduise and counsell, as hee embraceth it with much ioy and delectation, and vowes (though with the perill of his life) to perseuere and pursue her in mariage: To which end, authorized as well by his owne affection, as their authoritie, Clara is neither abroad nor at home, but hee meets her, giues away all time from himselfe, to giue himselfe to her: so as it seemes to the eye of the world, that Capello's house is now become his, and that his daughter Clara likewise shortly shall be: yea, hee addes such curiositie to his care, and such care to his affection in courting her, as shee cannot be eyther at Masse , or Vespres , but he is either with her, or neere her; and when in solemne pompe or zeale shee visits the Domo (or Cathedrall Church) of that Citie, and in it the Shrine of the new Saint Charles , then he wayts and attends on her at the Porch stayres, sometimes with his Coach, but many times (as the custome of Millan is) on his Foot- cloth, and prauncing Barbarie Horse, to conduct her home: yea, and not to fayle in any Complement of an accomplished Louer, besides the harmony of his own insinuation and solicitation, he greets her with rich presents, and salutes her with all varietie of melodious Musicke, and mellifluous Voyces: but all this notwithstanding, although hee euery way vse his best art and industry, and her father and mother their best skill to make her flexible to his desires, and their pleasure; yet shee as hauing her thoughts wholly bent and fixed on her deare  & sweet Baretano , lookes haggard and auerse on Albemare , giuing him such generall answers, and cold entertainement, as hee seeth hee hath farre more reason to despaire then hope to obtaine her. Whereupon doubting of her affection, hee hath againe recourse to her parents loue; who to confirme and seale it him, seeing faire meanes will not preuaile with their daughter, they resolue to vse force, and so to adde threats to their requests, and choller to their perswasions, to make her abandon Baretano , and embrace Albemare . But if the first preuaile not with her, the second cannot; for shee now tells them plainly, that shee neither can nor will affect any man for her husband but Baretano ; and yet she is so farre from any determinate resolution to marry him, as shee affirmes, that their will shall be her law, and their pleasure her resolution. Whiles thus Albemare in the way of mariage seeks our fayre and sweet Clara publikely, no lesse doth Baretano priuately; and although with lesse vanitie and ostentation, yet he hopes with far more fortunacy  & successe; as grounding his hopes vpon these reasons: That in heart and soule Clara is onely his, as both in soule and heart he is hers: so he entertaines her many times with his Letters, and yet not to shew himselfe a nouice in discretion, or a coward in affection, he making her content his commands, as shee did his desires her felicitie; hee in remote Churches and Chappels, (for whose number Millan exceeds Rome ) hath both the happinesse and honour priuatly to meet her: where if they violate the sanctitie of the place, in conferring and cherishing their affections, yet they sanctifie their affections, in desiring that some Church or Chappell might inuest and crowne them with the religious honour, and holy dignitie of Mariage. For hauing ieasted of Loue heretofore, now like true Louers, they hencefoorth resolue to loue, not in iest, but in earnest; and as of their two hearts, they haue already made one, so now they meane and intend to dispose of their bodies, thereby to make one of two: And this is their sole desire, and this and onely this, is their chiefest delight, and most pleasing'st desires and wishes. But as it is the nature of Loue, for Louers to desire to see none but themselues, and yet are seene of many: so this their familiaritie and frequent meeting is againe reported to her father and mother, whereat they murmure with griefe, and grieue with discontent and affliction: and now not to substract, but to adde to their vexation, it is resolued betweene our two young amorous Turtle Doues, Baretano , and his faire Clara , that he should publikely motion them for her in mariage; which hee in wonderfull faire tearmes, and orderly Decorum , (as well by his friends as himselfe) performeth. When contrary to his wishes, but not his expectation, they giue him so cold entertainment, and his suite such poore and sharpe acceptance, as they (in affection and zeale to Albemare ) not onely deny him their daughter, but their house: an answer so inciuill, and therefore so iniust, as might giue a testimony of some way of their care, yet no way of their discretion to themselues, or affection to their daughter. And heere I must confesse, that I can difficultly define, whether this resolution and answer of Capello and Castiana , more delighted Albemare , discontented Baretano , or afflicted Clara: who although in the entrance of their Loues, their hopes seem'd to be nipt, and their desires crost by the frowns of their parents, yet they loue each other so tenderly  & dearly, as these discontents notwithstanding, they will not retire, but are resolute to aduance in the progresse of this their chast and feruent affections, and although their commands endeuour to giue a law to her obedience, in not permitting her to be frequented of Baretano ; yet her obedience is so inforced to take a more stronger of her affection, as despight her Parents malice and ielousie towards them, when they are sweetly sleeping in their beds, then is their daughter Clara waking with Baretano , and he with her; oftentimes walking and talking in the Arbours, and many times kissing  & billing in the close galleries of the garden; which they cannot conceale or beare so closely, but her father & mother haue exact notice & intelligence therof by some of their trusty seruants, who they had purposely appointed as Sentinells to espie  & discouer their meetings. Whereupon (as much in hatred to Baretano as in affection to Albemare ) knowing that if the cause be once remoued, the effect is subiect soone to follow and ensue; they very suddenly and priuately send away their daughter from Millan to Modena by Coach, there to be mewed and pent vp with the Lady Emelia her Aunt, and besides her waiting Gentlewoman Adriana , none to accompany and conduct her, but onely Albemare , hoping that a small time, his presence and importunate solitations would deface the memory of Baretano , to ingraue his owne in the heart and thoughts of his sweet Clara . Who poore soule, seeing her selfe exiled and banished from the societie of her Baretano's sight and company, wherein vnder heauen she chiefly and onely delighted; she hereat, doth as it were drowne her selfe in the Ocean of her teares; storming aswell at the cruelty of her parents, as at her owne affliction and misfortune; and no lesse doth her Baretano for the absence of his sweet Saint and deare Lady Clara: for as their affections, so their afflictions are equall; now mourning as much at each others absence, as formerly they reioyced and triumphed in their presence. But although the ielousie of Capello and Castiana were very carefull to watch and obserue Baretano in Milan , and the zeale and affection of Albemares safety to guard, and sweetly to attend on Clara in Modena: Yet as fire suppressed, flames foorth with more violence, and riuers stopped, ouerflow with more impetuositie; so despight of the ones vigilancy, and the others ielousie, though Baretano cannot be so happy and blessed to ride ouer to Modena to see and salute his Clara ; yet loue, which is the refiner of inuentions and wit, and the polisher of iudgement, cannot yet detaine him from visiting her with his letters, the which in respect of the hard accesse and difficult passage to her, he is inforced to send her by subtill meanes, and secret messengers; and the better to ouershadow the curiosity of his Arts, and the Art of his affection herein, he among many others, makes vse of a Fryer and a Hermite, for the conueyance of two letters to Modena , to his Lady: which (as fit agents for such amourous imployments) they (with more cunning and fidelity, then zeale and Religion ) safely deliuered her, and likewise returned him her answeres thereof. And because the feruency of their affections and constancies each to other, are more liuely depaynted and represented in these two, then in any other of their letters; therefore I thought my selfe in a manner bound, here to insert them, to the end to giue the better spirit and Grace to their History , and the fuller satisfaction and content to the curiositie of the Reader: That which Baretano sent Clara vpon her departure from Millan to Modena by the Fryer, spake thus:  miserable before I know what belongs to happinesse: For if euer I found any content, or Heauen vpon Earth, it was onely in thy sweet presence; which thy sudden absence and vnexpected exile, hath now made, at least, my Purgatory, if not my Hell. Faire Clara iudge of thy Baretano by thy selfe, what a matchlesse griefe it is to my heart, and a heart-killing terrour to my thoughts, to see thee made captiue to my riuall, and that the Fates and thy Parents seeme to bee so propitious to his desires, and so inexorable and cruell to mine: That I must liue alone in Millan without thee, and he alone in Modena with thee: which makes that, I know not, whether I more enuie his ioy, or lament and pitty mine owne sorrowes and afflictions. But if I haue any sense or shaddow of comfort in this my calamitie, it onely consists in this, that as thou carriedst away my heart with thee; so thou wilt vouchsafe to returne me thine in thy letter by a reciprocall requitall and exchange. For if thou neither bring me thy selfe, nor send me that; I may be sought in Millan , but found no where but in heauen: were I priuiledged by thy consent, much more authorized by thy command; I would speedily rather flie then poast to thee: for Fayre and Deere Clara , as thou art my sole Ioy and Soueraigne felicitie, so whiles I breath this ayre of life, thy will shall be my lawe, thy commaund my Compasse, and thy pleasure my resolution. Baretano.  Her answere returned by the Frier to Baretano at Millan , was to this effect.  share of misery, in being depriued of each others presence. Thou tearmest mine absence either thy purgatory, or thy hell,  & my afflictions & torments for thine are so great, and withall so infinite, as I haue all the equitie and reason of the world to repute them not only one, but both: Thou art mistaken in the point of my thraldome, for whiles Albemare vowes himselfe my captiue, I disdayne to be his, and both vow and triumph to be onely Baretanos ; I know not whether I haue brought thy heart with me to Modena , but sure I am, I left mine with thee in Millan: If my Parents seeme now pleasing and propitious to him, I am yet so farre from dispaire, as I confidently hope the Fates will not prooue cruell or inexorable to thee, and in thee to my selfe: but rather that a little time will change their resolutions and decrees, Sith they cannot our affections and constancy. If Clara be thy sole ioy and Soueraigne felicity, no lesse is Baretano hers: And albeit, I could wish either thou heere with my selfe in Modena , or I there with thee in Millan . Yet such is my Aunt Emeliars care, and Albemares ielousie ouer me, that wert thou in this Citie, thou couldest difficultly see me, but impossibly speake with me; wherefore refraine a whiles, and let thy Iourney hither to me be ended ere began; yet with this prouiso and condition, that the cause thereof, thy affection to me, be began neuer to be ended: and thinke that my stay and exile heere shalbe as short, as either my best Art in my selfe can inuent, or truest zeale to thee suggest. In which Interim let vs solace our selues, and visit each other by the Ambassadours of our hearts, I meane our letters: And this resolue my deare Baretano , that during our absence wiles thou doest feast on my Idaea , I will not faile to surfeit on thine. Clara.  Baretano's other letter sent Clara to Modena by the Pilgrime , was couched and penned in these tearmes.  against my desires and wishes, I had long since left Millan to haue seene Modena ,  & in it thy self my sweet & decre Lady ; but I speake it to my present comfort, and future consolation and ioy, that it is excesse not want of affection which infuseth this prouident care & carefull prouidence to thy resolutions, to the end that thy returne make vs as ioyfull as thy departure sorrowfull, and consequently that the last proue as sweet vnto our hearts and thoughts, as the first was bitter: And yet beleeue me deere Clara , that my affection is so intire and feruent to thee, because I know thine is reciprocally so to my selfe: that I deeme it not onely capable to make difficult things easie, but which is more, impossiblities possible: For, for thy sake what would I not attempt? and to enioy thy sight and presence what would I leaue vnperformed? But if thou wilt not permit me to come to thee to Modena , nor yet speedily resolue to returne to me to Millan: Sorrow will then preuent my Ioy , and Dispaire my Hope; For if thou hasten not thy arriuall and our interuiew, sickenesse will be my death; wert thou as kind as faire, or as affectionate as I am feruent in affection, thou wilt then rather suffer me to liue with thee, then to die for thee: for in this rest confident, that if thou denie me that request, I cannot Nature this tribute, my affection this homage, or thy beautie this sacrifice. Baretano.  And Clara her answere hereunto returned to Milan to Baretano , by the foresaid Pilgrime was traced in these words:  Emelia , & my suitor Albemare , haue now reduced me to so strict a Sequestration (or rather captiuitie) as onely my thoughts, hardly my pen, hath the freedome and power to signifie thee so much. But as calmes ensue tempests, and sun-shine showers, so I beseech thee to brooke it with as much patience, as I doe with griefe; and not onely hope, but resolue, that violence is neuer permanent, and all extreames subiect to reuolution and change. Wherefore my deare Baretano , consider and thinke with thy selfe, that my stay from Millan , and thy prohibition from Modena , hath this two-fold excuse, that is in my will, but not as yet in my power to performe; and this will rather hinder, then any way aduance the accomplishing of our desires; Sith a little time may effect that with my parents, which I feare importunity wil neuer; neither can thy heart so much long for my sight, or wish for my presence, as my soule doth for thine: Sith to giue thee but one word for all, thy selfe, and onely thy selfe, art both the life of my ioy, and the ioy of my life. A thousand times a day I wish Modena were Millan , and againe, as often that Albemare were metamorphosed into Baretano . Therefore, I am so farre from preuenting thy ioy, as though at the price of my death, I am ready to sacrifice my life for the preseruation of thine; as also for the banishing of thy dispayre: Write me not then of thy sickenesse, least thou as soone heare of my death, and I know not what request to denie thee, sith I haue already granted and giuen thee my selfe, which is all that either I can giue, or thou desire; cherish thy selfe for my sake, and I will thy remembrance for mine. Clara.  By these louing Letters of these our Louers, the Reader may obserue and remark, what a firme league, and strict and constant friendship there was contracted and setled betwixt them, and what a hell their absence was each to others thoughts and contemplations: In the meane time, whiles Baretano entertaines Clara with Letters, Albemare doth with wordes, wherein he vseth his best Rhetoricke and Oratory, to draw her to his desires; and withall, to listen and espy out, if there passe any passages of Letters, or other correspondency betwixt them. Which although Clara her affection to Baretano vow, and her discretion to her selfe resolue to conceale and obscure from Albemare , yet loe here falles out a sinister and vnexpected accident, which will discouer and bewray it; yea, and of all sides, and to all parties produce griefe, sorrow, choller, and repentance, which in effect (briefly) is thus: Clara had reason in her former Letter sent by the Pilgrim , to tearme this her sequestration in Modena a captiuitie, sith the bounds of her aunt Emilias two small Gardens, and the walles of her little Parke, were the limits wherein her liberty was confined, and her selfe as it were, immured: for farther she was not permitted to goe, except to the Church with her aunt in her Coach, but still accompanied by Albemare , who left no minutes nor occasions, as well to see her, as to bee seene of her. Now to giue some truce (though not peace) to her discontents, and thereby somewhat to calme the impetuositie of those tempests, which loue had stirred vp in her heart and thoughts for the absence of her Baretano , shee neuer better accompanied then when alone, sometime past away the irksomnesse of her time in walking in the Gardens, but many times in the Parke close shut, followed only by her wayting Gentlewoman Adriana: for in respect of her aunts vnkindnesse, and Albemares ielousie, she would neither accept of her familiaritie, nor of his company. Now to the neerest end of the Parke, not farre distant from the second Garden, was a curious walk, ranked about with many rowes of Sycamore trees, and at the farther end thereof a close ore-shadowed Bower; yea, so closely vayled, that the rayes of the Sunne could neither peepe in, to scorch the purenesse of her beautie, or to contend with the piercing lustre and resplendancy of her eyes: and to this Bower, in a fayre and cleare day, Clara (about three of the clocke after dinner) repaires, hauing in her hand to delude the time, the old amourous Historie of Hero and Leander , which was very lately illustrated, and newly reprinted in Millan , and wherein indeed for the conformitie of their loues with her owne, she tooke a singular delight to reade: but that which gaue sweeter musicke to her thoughts, and felicitie to her heart, and mind, were her Baretano's two Letters, (which we haue formerly seene) and which as then she had purposely brought with her to suruey and peruse; yea, she reades them ore againe  & againe; and to write the truth, more oftner then there are words, or I thinke sillables therein contained: but when she descends to his name, shee cannot refraine from kissing it; yea, and such is her tender loue to Baretano , as she bedewes it with her teares; a thousand times she wished her selfe with him, or he with her, and bitterly blames the crueltie of her parents, for separating their bodies, sith shee not onely hoped, but assured her selfe, that God had conioyned, and vnited their hearts. But whiles shee in the middest of these passionate extasies seemes to be rapt vp into the heauen of ioy, at the perusall of these Letters of Baretano ; and then againe to be plunged into the hell of sorrow, at the consideration and remembrance of his absence, shee heares a voyce, which she thinkes is not farre off from her, when looking foorth the Bower, and deeming it to be that of her wayting-Gentlewoman, whom she saw somewhat neere her gathering of Strawberries, and wilde Lillies, shee within a slight shot from her, perceiues it to be her Louer , (but not her loue,) Albemare , who knowing her there in the Bower, and for want of other talke, speaking to the Eccho, she guessed by his course, (wherein she was not deceiued) that he had an intent to salute and speake with her; which to preuent, because it wholly displeased her, to be cumbred with the company of so vnwelcomed a guest as himselfe, she hastily folds vp her letters in her handkercher, and clapping them (at least as she thought) into the pocket of of her gowne, takes her [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) bookes in her hand, and calling Adriana , trips away backe towards the garden, by the other side of the Parke, purposely to eschew and auoid him, as indeed she did. Albemare grieues to see Clara's coynesse and cruelty toward him, although she were departed foorth the Parke from him, yet his affection is so feruent to her, as he will needs ascend the Bower, esteeming it not onely a kind of content, but a blessing to his thoughts; sith he cannot be where she is, yet to be where she hath beene: when thinking to mount the stayres of the bower, he vnexpected at the foot thereof, finds the two letters whereof we haue formerly spoken, which it seemes slipt foorth of Clara's handkercher, as she was putting it into her pocket: Albemare taking vp the letters, and seeing them directed to his sweet Clara , he betwixt the extreames of loue and ioy, kisseth them againe and againe for her sake: when sitting downe in the Bower, he betakes himselfe to read and peruse them, verily expecting and hoping to gather and draw some thing from them which might tend to aduance the processe of his affection towards her: But when he had read the first, he was so extreamely perplexed and afflicted, as he had hardly the patience to peruse the second, and yet at length hastily and passionatly running it ouer, and seeing by all the circumstances thereof, that it was in vaine for him any longer to hope for Clara , sith shee was Baretano's , and Baretano hers, he like one Lunaticke, stampes with his foot, throwes awas his hat, teares his haire for very griefe and choller, now thinking to teare the letters, and then to offer violence to himselfe: But when the fumes and flames of this his folly were ouerblowen, and that he had againe recalled his wits to take place in the proper seat of his iudgement and discretion; then taking vp his hat, and pulling it downe his eares, he leaues the Bower and Parke, and so going into the house, shewes them to the Lady Emelia her Aunt, who prayes him not to dispaire, but that Baretano's letters notwithstanding, he himselfe shall shortly marry her Niece Clara ; only she prayes him for the two letters, because she affirmes, she will to morrow send them to Millan to her father and mother. Wherein he saith, he will take aduise of his pillow; when fasting out his supper, he betakes himselfe to his bed, to see whether he can sleepe away those his passions and vexations. And by this time Clara going to locke vp these two aforesaid letters in her trunke, she finds her handkercher, but misseth her letters; whereat blushing for shame, and then againe looking pale for sorrow, griefe and anger, she speedily sends away Adriana to the Bower, to looke them, who returnes without them, and then she knowes for certaine that Albemare hath found them: whereupon for meere griefe and anger, feigning her selfe sick, she withdrawes her selfe to her chamber, and there presently betakes her selfe to her bed. I may well say that Clara & Albemare betake themselues to their beds; but I am sure not to their rest: For griefe and loue so violently acte their seuerall parts in their hearts and thoughts, as sigh they doe, but sleepe they cannot: Yea their passions and sorrowes are as different as their desires; for as Albemare now grieues that he hath found these letters, so doth Clara that shee hath lost them; and as he vowes not to restore her them, so she neither dares, and yet disdayneth to demand them of him: Yea againe, which is more, as their sorrowes are different, so are their pretended consolations, at least if I may properly and truely tearme them consolations: For as Clara , although shee haue lost her Baretano's letters, doth yet reioyce that she still retaines the writer and Authour thereof ingrauen and caractered in her heart: so doth Albemare , that now fully knowing Baretano to be his riuall, and who by all probability is like to beare his mistris from him, he hath (as he iniustly conceiues, a iust reason to be reuenged, and a true occasion to fight with him: but as Clara's comfort and consolation herein proceeds from true affection, so doth the vanitie and impiety of this resolution of Albemares from hellish malice, and deuillish indignation: yea, although the night doth or should bring counsell, yet as Clara passeth it ouer onely with sighes, so doth Albemare with [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) fumes and reuenge against Baretano , vowing that he will in the morne towards Millan , and there trie his fortune, either to kill him or to bee killed of him, in a Duell ; to which end he is no sooner ready, but he acquaints the Lady Emelia with his intended iourney, but not with his resolution to fight with Baretano , and the same he doth to the Empresse of his thoughts, and Queene of his desires) Clara , demaunding her if she please to command him any seruice for Millan ; who both blushing and paling hereat, her affection to Baretano , hauing now made her expert in the subtilties of loue, she well knowes what wind driues Albemare to Millan : and therefore guided by discretion, and not by passion, she returnes him this answer: That hauing neither reason nor desire to command him, she only prayes him to remember her humble duety to her Father and mother, and so wisheth his iourney prosperous: which answere of hers (being indeed no other then Albemare expected) he yet aduanceth to kisse her at parting, which her ciuility though not her affection granted him; not so much as once dreaming or suspecting that he conceiued the least thought or intent to fight with her sweet Baretano , and so he takes horse, hauing onely one seruant with him. Albemare being arriued at Saint Remie , a small Towne within fifteene miles of Millan , he resolues to dine there, which he doth: and to auoid the heate of the day, then betakes himselfe to sleepe an howre or two; being awaked, he commands his man to make ready his horse, and seeing the Hoast of the house in his chamber, enquires of him if there were any Gentlemen in the house riding for Millan , who as soone returnes him this vnlook'd for, and vnexpected answere; that there was a braue Gentleman in his house named Signior Baretano , who was to ride thither some two houres hence. Albemare no sooner heares the name of Baretano , but his very heart blood flasheth vp in his face, when demaunding him againe what manner of Gentleman he was, he told him he was a tall slender yong Gentleman, with neuer a haire on his face, and out of this window quoth he, you may now see him walking in the garden; when Albemare looking foorth, sees indeed that it was his very riuall Baretano , when enquiring further of the Hoast what followers he had with him, hee told him that then he had none, but sometimes when he came thither, either to take the ayre, or breath his horse, he was attended by two or three, and so the Hoast leaues him, not once suspecting of any difference betweene them. Albemare seeing his enemy (because his riuall) brought to him, whom he formerly resolued to seeke and find out, assumes a base and a bloody resolution to set vpon him in the high way disguised, and there to venter his owne life, to depriue him of his: which to effect he will haue no eye witnesses of this his ignoble and trecherous business; and therefore purposely sends away his man to Millan before him, and so slipping into the towne, prouides himselfe of a maske or visard; then takes his horse, and rather like a theefe then a Gentleman, lurkes behind a Groue (some three miles from Saint Remy ) attending Baretano's comming, who poore harmelesse young Gentleman, harbouring and breathing no other thoughts and wishes then charitie to all the world, and pure and feruent affection to his faire and deare Clara , likewise takes his horse, and drawes homeward toward Millan , when being arriued to the place where Albemare secretly lay in ambush for him, he furiously and suddenly rusheth foorth, and with his Rapier drawen in his hand, runnes Baretano into his right arme, who feeling the wound almost as soone as he saw his enemy who gaue it him, he is at first as it were amazed hereat; when thinking him by his maske to be a Bandetti , who were then very busie in Lombardy , but especially in that Dutchie of Millan , he told him that all the coyne he had, which was some ten double Pistols in gold, and two Duckats in siluer, were at his seruice, but to fight in his defence he would not: Not quoth he, that he was any way a Coward, but that he affirmed he was lately affianced and ingaged to a young Lady: so that he perfecty knew that her affection was so deare and tender towards him, as either the losse or preseruation of his life would be that of hers: Albemare galled and touch't to the quicke with this his heart killing answere to him, is wholly inflamed with choller against him, when rushing towards him, he deliuers him these words: Villaine it is not thy gold but thy life which I seeke, and then strayning himselfe to runne Baretano thorow, loe the string of his Maske breakes, where Baretano apparently sees it is his Riuall Albemare: whereat such is his tender affection to his sweete and fayre Clara , that hee who before turned crauen, and would not fight for his owne sake, is now cheerefully resolued not onely to fight, but if occasion require, to dye for hers: and so returning the villaine to Albemares throat, hee instantly drawes, and ioynes with him: and if Albemare be resolute in fighting, no lesse valiant and couragious is Baretano ; for the remembrance of his Clara's sweet Idea, and fresh delicious beautie, infuseth such life to his valour, and such generositie, and animositie to his courage, as he deales his blowes roundly, and his thrusts freely, making Albemare know, that his Rapier is of an excellent temper, and yet his heart of a better: And Albemare seeing hee must buy his victory dearer then hee expected, and disdaining to be out-braued and beaten by a boy, pluckes vp his best spirits and courage to him, and so likewise behaues himselfe manfully and valiantly: in such sort, that within lesse then a quarter of an houre, Baretano hath giuen him fiue wounds, and he Baretano three, when the Count of Martingue passing that way in his Coach towards Millan , and seeing two Gentlemen so busily fighting, he cryes out to his Coach-man, to gallop away with all celeritie, and so parts them; when seeing them full of blood, sweat, and dust, hauing his Chyrurgion still in his traine with him, he out of an honourable courtesie and charitie, intreats and accompanies them to the next house, where he causeth their wounds to bee drest and bound vp; when by their apparell seeing them to be Millaneses , is desirous to know their quarrell, and profers his best assistance to reconcile and make them friends: but their hearts are so great, and their malice so implacable, as they both thanke the Count for his noble courtesie, but beseech him to pardon them, in obscuring their names and quartell; and yet he is so noble and generous, as he will not so leaue them, but seeing them shrewdly wounded (though not he thinks mortally) he for their greater ease and safetie, causeth two of his Gentlemen to mount their horses, and takes them both vp into his Coach with him, and so brings them within the Gates of Millan , where after they had seuerally rendred him many thankes for his Courtesie and Honour , hee commends them both to their good Fortunes, and so leaues them. Baretano and Albemare being thus arriued at Millan , they conceale their fighting, and so keepe their chambers, till they haue secured their wounds; when Albemare visits Capello and his Lady Castiana ,  & reports to them the health & dutie of their daughter, as also her auersnesse towards him, and withall shewes her Baretano's two Letters to her, wherby it is apparant, that she is so wholly his, as he himselfe is sure neuer to obtaine or enioy her. Her father and mother at the first seeme to hang their heads at this newes, and the perusall of the Letters; but at last bid him not despaire, but be couragious, for he and onely hee shall be their sonne in law. But Albemare considering that for the tearme of at least sixe moneths, he Camelion -like had onely been fed with the ayre of these their vaine promises, and that he perfectly knew that Clara onely intended to marry Baretano , and none but him, his loue to her was so tender and feruent, as hee cannot conceiue the shadow of any hope how to obtaine her for his wife in this world, before hee haue sent Baretano into another, when being constant in his resolution thereof to himselfe, because hee was resolute in his constancy and affection to Clara: no reason, no Religion, not his Conscience, not his Soule, can diuert him from this bloody designe, from this murtherous and therefore damnable proiect: Feeding therefore on Malice, and boyling with Reuenge towards Baretano , he not as a Gentleman, but rather degenerating from the vertue and honour of that honourable degree and qualitie, bethinkes himselfe either by pistoll or poyson how hee may treacherously dispatch him: whereon ruminating and pondering (as malice and reuenge may perchance slumber, but difficultly sleep) the Deuill who is neuer absent in such hellish stratagems and occasions, giues him meanes (though by a contrary course) how to dispatch him: For on a day descending the stayres of the Domo , hee sees Pedro , and Leonardo , (two Souldiers, or rather Braues of the Castle of Pauia ) passe by him, with whom hee had been formerly acquainted, but so poorely apparelled, as weighing their bloody humours by their necessity, he (in fauour of money) thinkes them very fit Agents and Instruments , to murther and make away Baretano , to which end, to play the Practique part as wel as the Theorique ,  & so to reduce this his bloudy con-contemplation into action, hee sends his man Valerio after them, and prayes them to repaire to him in the Cloysters of Borromeos Palace, for that he hath a businesse to impart them of great importance for their profits. Valerio ouertakes them, deliuers them his masters pleasure; who netled with this word Profit, they repayre to the Rendeuous , and meet Albemare ; when hauing refreshed their acquaintance, and hee sworne them to secrecy, he as a wretched and perfidious Gentleman, acquaints them with his desire, some ten dayes hence to haue them murther Seignior Baretano in the street by night, and to giue it out, that it was done by some Spanyards of the Viceroyes Guard, and that he will giue them an hundred Duckatons in hand, and leaue them as much more with his man Valerio , which they shal receiue of him, when they haue dispatcht him; and for his owne part, some foure or fiue dayes hence he will away for Modena , to cast the better varnish and colour that hee was innocent thereof, and had no finger at all in the businesse. Pedro and Leonardo , seeing that Albemare proffered them gold, which they so much wanted and desired; like two limbes of the Deuill, and as a couple of hellish Blood-hounds, not only promise, but swear to him punctually, in al respects to performe his desires,  & so they touch their first hundred Duckatons, which being the pledg & price of innocet blood, it wil assuredly cost them deare, and draw downe vengeance, ruine & confusion on their heads from heauen, when they least think or dreame thereof. Albemare hauing setled this his bloody and mournfull businesse with Pedro and Leonardo , he is againe solicited by Capello , and Castiana , to returne to their daughter in Modena: wherunto he willingly consenteth; when armed with their Letters to her, wherin they charge her on their commands  & blessing, to dispose her selfe to affect & marry him, he within foure dayes departeth. But hauing secretly reuealed his fight with Baretano to some of Capello his chiefest and most confident seruants, they yet loue and honour their young Lady Clara so well in her absence, as they send her the true relation and intelligence thereof, which is at Modena a little before Albemare , the which being vnknowne to him, he is no sooner arriued there, but hee salutes first the Aunt Emilia , then her Neece and his Mistris, Clara: to whom hauing deliuered her Parents Letters, she stepping aside to the window, reades them; and so returning to him againe, shee giue him this sharpe and bitter welcome: My father and mother commaund mee to loue thee; but how can I, sith vpon the high way, thou basely and treacherously attemptedst to kill my deare Baretano, whom I loue a thousand times dearer then the whole world? when with teares in her eyes, and choller in her lookes, shee very suddenly and passionately flings from him, whereat Emilia wondreth, and hee both stormes and grieues; and so they betake themselues to their chambers, where Albemare throwing himselfe on his bed, sayth thus to himselfe: Vnkind and cruell Clara , if thou take my fighting with Baretano thus tenderly, how wilt thou brooke the newes of his death? On the other side, Clara grieues as much at her Baretano's wounds, as shee reioyceth at his saftie and recouery; yea, so tender is her affection to him, as she a thousand times wishes, that the blood hee lost, had streamed from her owne heart. Againe, knowing his wounds free from danger, shee cannot but smile, and delight to see his deare and true affection to her, in remembring that he would not fight for his owne sake, and yet was ready, yea and valiantly hazarded to loose his life for hers; and in these amorous conceits  & comtemplations shee pensiuely driues away the time, admiring and wondring that all this while shee heares not from her Baretano: But alas, alas! shee shall heare too too soone of him, though indeed neuer more from him: for these execrable wreches, Pedro and Leonardo , some foure dayes after Albemares departure to Modena , they according to their promise and oath giuen him, like two most bloody and butcherly villaines, cruelly assault and murther this harmelesse and innocent young Gentleman Baretano , in the streets of Millan by night, with no lesse then seuen seuerall wounds, whereof foure were cleane thorow his body; and so giues it out (as it was formerly concluded) that hee was murthered by some Spaniards of the Viceroyes Guard: when the same night they repaire to Valerio , acquaint him therewith, receiue their other hundred Duckatons, and so prouide for their safetie in the citie: but that bloody money, and this cruell murther, will in the end cost him dearer, then either they imagine, or dreame of. Whiles Millan ratleth with the newes of Baretano's bloody and vntimely end, as his owne friends infinitly lament and grieue, so Capello and his wife Castiana cannot refraine from reioycing thereat, as now assuring themselues that Albemare shall shortly bee their sonne in law: and for Valerio , hee with all possible speed writes away thereof to Modena , to his Master, who entertaines this newes with infinite ioy and delectation, and presently acquaints the Lady Emilia therewith; whereat she reioyceth, and he triumphes: but they both resolue to conceale it from Clara , because they knew shee will euen dissolue and melt into teares therat. But foure dayes after are not fully expired, but her father  & mother aduertise their daughter Clara , their sister Emilia , and Albemare thereof, by a Gentleman, a seruant of theirs, whom they purposely send to Modena , to bring backe Clara , and Albemare to Millan . But it is for none but Louers, to conceiue or iudge, with what extreame excesse of griefe and immoderate sorrow our poore Clara vnderstands this heart-piercing newes of her Baretano's mournfull and sorrowful death: for shee is no sooner aduertised thereof, but shee throwes off her attyre, teares her hayre, and twice following falles to the ground in a swound, so as Emilia, Albemare, Adriana , and her fathers Gentleman can hardly refetch and keepe life in her: but being come againe to her senses and selfe, and faintly opening her cloudy eyes to the beames of the Sunne, who enamoured of her beautie (as well in pitie as loue) came to comfort and reuiue her: shee wringing her hands, then crossing her armes, and lastly, looking vp towards Heauen , betwixt sighing and speaking, breathes forth these mournfull, passionate, and affectionate speeches: O my Baretano , my sweet and deare Baretano , and shall thy wretched Clara liue thou being dead? when the violence of her affection and sorrow making her forget her selfe, and her God, she secretly vnsheathes her knife, and then and there would haue stabbed her selfe to death, had not Albemare and her Aunt Emilia speedily stept to her assistance, and preuented her, by wresting it from her; when conducting her to the Garden, to take the ayre, shee prayes Albemare to leaue her, and in his absence often againe repeating the name of her deare Baretano , she a thousand times wisheth that her life had ransomed his, vowing that although she were a woman, yet if she knew his murtherers, shee would flie to their eyes, and teare out their hearts, in meere reuenge of his inhumane and cruell death: when her sorrowes are so infinite, and her griefe so vnsupportable, as shee cannot long remain in one place, but withdrawes her selfe from the garden to her chamber, whither her Aunt Emilia carefully accompanies her, lies with her that night to comfort her, who poore afflicted young Lady, neyther can nor will be comforted: so as the next morning, had not her Aunt powerfully preuented and stopped her, shee had then vndoubtedly entred the Nunnery of her owne name, Saint Clara , and in that retyred and obscure life there ended her dayes in Modena ; resoluing in true affection and zeale to her dead Baretano , neuer thenceforth either to see her parents, or Millan: but being diuerted and comforted by some Diuines, and many Ladies of that Citie, shee brooking her sorrowes as patiently as she may, (with much solicitation) after ten dayes, permits her selfe to be conueyed home to Millan , where although shee were very cheerefully receiued,  & ioyfully entertained of her father and mother, yet she likewise went neere to haue there mewed her selfe vp a spirituall sister in the Nunnery of the Annunciation ; but that againe she was preuented: whereat grieuing, she yet takes on mourning attire, and vowes to weare it a whole yeare for his sake: when to make her selfe (as shee was) both a true Louer, and a true mourner to the memory of her dead Baretano , shee oftentimes steales into Saint Euphemias Church, where hee was buried, and there bedewes his tombe with her teares, liuing so pensiuely, and disconsolately, that although she liue in the world, yet it seemes she neither is, nor long will be of the world. But as women are but women, and as Time is a soueraigne remedy for all diseases and sorrowes; so about some ten moneths after, the incessant importunitie of her father and mother, and the continuall tender respect and obseruant courtesie of Albemare towards her, make her somewhat neglect and forget the memory of Baretano , and now to looke on him with a more pleasing and fauourable eye then before. But here (againe) a consideration makes her affection dye towards Albemare , almost as soone as it beginnes to liue: For why (quoth shee) should shee affect or loue him, who at Saint Remy gaue her Baretano three seuerall wounds? But then Loue againe steps in, and thus pleads with her for Albemare: That he receiued fiue wounds, and gaue Baretano but three, which made him lose far more blood then Baretano: and yet that this attempt of his was onely occasioned through his affection to her, and onely for her sake, as louing her dearer then his owne life, which againe gaue her thoughts such satisfaction, as weighed downe and vanquished, as well by the power and prayers of her parents, as also by the endlesse sighes, letters, and presents of Albemare , the yeare is no sooner expired, and her mourning weeds and attire done away, but to their owne hearts content, and the vnspeakable ioy of their parents, they in Millan (with great pompe and brauery) are very solemnly maried. But this mariage of theirs shall not prooue so prosperous as they expect and hope: For God in his all-seeing Prouidence , hath decreed to disturbe the tranquilitie, and serenitie thereof, and to make them feele the sharpe and bitter showers of affliction and misery, which briefly doth thus surprise and befall them. Albemare and Clara , haue hardly been married together a yeare and quarter, but his hote loue begins to waxe cold and frozen to her; yea, although she affected him truely and tenderly, yet hee continually neglecting her, and no longer delighting in the sweetnesse of her youth, and the freshnesse of her beautie, his lustfull eyes and thoughts carry his lasciuious selfe abroad among Courtezans , when they should be fixed on her, and resident at home with his chast and faire Lady: so as his infidelitie proouing her griefe and torments, and his vanitie and ingratitude; her vnspeakeable affliction, and vexation; shee with infinite sighs and teares, repents her matching him,  & a thousand times wisheth she had been so happy and blessed to haue dyed Baretano's Martyr, and not so vnfortunate and accursed to liue to see her selfe Albemares wife: and yet were there any hope of his reformation, shee could then prefixe bounds to her calamities and sorrowes: But seeing that his vices grew with his age, and that euery day he became more vitious and vnkind to her then other, her hopes are now turned into despaire, her mirth into mourning; yea, her inward discontents so apparantly bewray themselues in her outward sorrowfull complexion and countenance, that the Roses of her cheekes are metamorphosed into Lillies, and her heart so wholly taken vp with anguish, and surprized with sorrow, as she wisheth that her bed were her graue, and her selfe in Heauen with God ; because shee could find no comfort heere on Earth with her husband: But beyond her expectation, God is prouiding to redresse her griefe, and to remedy her afflictions by a very strange and vnlooked for accident. The Prouidence and Iustice of God , doth now againe refetch bloody Pedro , to act another part vpon the Stage and Theatre of this History: For hauing spent that money lewdly, which he before got damnably of Albemare , his wants are so great, and his necessitie so vrgent, as hauing played the murtherer before, he makes no conscience nor scruple now to play the thiefe: and so by night breakes into a Iewellers shop, named Signior Fiamata , dwelling in the great place before the Domo , and there carries away from him, a small Trunke or Casket, wherein were some vncut Saphyrs and Emeralds , with some Venice Christall pendants for Ladies to weare in their eares, and other rich commodities: but Fiamata lying ouer his shop, and hearing it, and locking his doore to him for feare of hauing his throat cut, giues the out-cry and alarum footh the window, which ringing in the streets, make some of the neighbours, and also the watch approach and assemble; where finding Pedro running with a Casket vnder his arme, he is presently hem'd in, apprehended and imprisoned, and the Casket tooke from him, and againe restored to Fiamata ; when knowing that he shal die for this robbery, as a iust punishment  & iudgement of God, now sent him for formerly murthering of Baretano , he hauing no other hope to escape death but by the means of Albemare , he sends earely the next morning for his man Valerio , to come to the prison to him, whom he bids to tel his master Albemare from him, that being sure to be condemned for this robberie of his, if he procure him not his pardon, he will not charge his soule any longer with the murther of Baretano , but will on the ladder reueale how it was hee who hired himselfe and Leonardo to performe it; Valerio reporting this to his master, it affrights his thoughts, and terrifies his conscience and courage, to see himselfe reduced to this misery, that no lesse then his life must now stand to the mercy of this wretched varlet Pedro's tongue. But knowing it impossible to obtaine a pardon for him, and therefore high time to prouide for his owne safety, by stopping of Pedro's mouth; he resolues to heaue Ossa vpon Pellion , or to adde murther to murther, and now to poyson him in prison, whom he had formerly caused to murther Baretano in the street, to the end he might tell no tales on the ladder, thinking it no ingratitude or sinne, but rather a iust reward and recompense for his former bloody seruice; so to feed Pedro with false hopes thereby to charme his tongue to silence, and to lull his malice asleepe, he speedily returnes Valerio to prison to him, who bids him feare nothing, for that his master hath vowed to get him his pardon, as he shall more effectually heare fro him that night: whereat Pedro reioyceth and triumpheth, telling Valerio that his master Albemare is the most generous and brauest Caualier of Lombardy . But to nip his ioyes in their vntimely blossomes, and to disturbe the harmony of his false content; that very day as soone as hee hath dined, hee is tryed and arraigned before his Iudges; and being apparantly conuicted and found guilty of this robbery, he is by them adiudged to be hanged the next morne, at a gibbet purposely to be errected before Fiamata's house, where he committed his delict and crime: which iust sentence not onely makes his ioy strike saile to sorrow, but also his pride and hopes let fall the Peacocks plumes to humilitie and feare: But his onely trust and comfort, yea, his last hope  & refuge is in Albemare , who hearing him to be condemned, to be executed the next morning: he is enforced to play his bloody prise that night, and so in the euening sends Valerio to prison to him with a Capon, and two Fiascoes (or bottles) of wine, for him to make merry, informing him that he hath obtained his pardon, and that it is written, and wants nothing but the Viceroyes signe to it, which he shall haue to morrow at breake of day. But the wine of one of the bottles was intermixed with strong and deadly poyson, which was so cunningly tempered, as it carried no distatefull, but a pleasing relish to the pallate: Valerio like an execrable villaine, prouing as true a seruant to his master, as a rebellious and false one to his God, he punctually performes this fearefull and mournefull businesse; and hauing made Pedro twice drunke, first with his good newes, and then with his poysoned wine, hee takes leaue of him that night, and committing him to his rest, promiseth to be with him very early in the morning with his pardon. When this miserable and beastly prophane wretch, neuer thinking of his danger, or death; of God, or his soule; of heauen, or hell, betakes himselfe to his bed, where the poyson spreading ore his vitall parts, soone bereaue him of his breath, sending his soule from this life and world to another. Now the next morning very early as the Gaoler came to his chamber, to bid him prepare to his execution, he finds him dead and cold in his bed; and thus was the miserable end of this bloody and inhumane murtherer (and theefe) Pedro : who yet for example sake was one whole day hang'd by the heeles in his shirt, at his appointed place of execution; because his Iudges deemed that he had cruelly poysoned and made away himselfe. And now doth Albemare againe reioyce and triumph to see he hath auoyded that dangerous shelfe and rocke, whereon he was very likely to haue suffred shipwracke, yea, and now hee thinkes himselfe so absolutely safe and secure; as hee holds it impossible that either his murthering of Baretano , or his poysoning of Pedro can any way reflect on him, or hencefoorth produce him any further stormes or tempests: but his hopes and ioyes will deceiue him, for God who is the infallible reuenger of innocent blood, will not so leaue him, but ere long, when he least thinkes or dreames thereof, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) not onely in his prouidence detect these his foule crimes, but in his iustice seuerly punish them, and the Readers curiositie shall not goe farre to see it; for as to a guiltie conscience, it is the pleasure of the Lord, that one misery befall him in the necke and nicke of the other, so Albemare is no sooner freed of Pedro in Millan , but behold, hee is afresh intangled and assaulted with Leonardo (his other hired murtherer) in Pauia: who hauing their prodigally rioted away his hundred Duckatons, and also run himselfe farre in debt; his Creditors ioyne together, and so clap him prisoner, where hauing no other hope for his freedome and libertie, but to relie on Albemare , he writes him a letter to Millan , wherein he acquaints him with his pouerty and misery, and prayes him (for the obtayuing of his liberty) either to lend or giue him fifty Duckatons: Albemare receiues this letter, but forgetting his former seruice, as also thinking it onely a fetch of Leonardo to fetch him ouer for so many Duckatons, as God would haue it, he very inconsiderately burnes this his letter, and answereth it with silence: but he shall repent it, when it will be too late, and out of his power to remedy this his ingratitude and indescretion. Leonardo hauing at least fifteene dayes expected an answere from Albemare , and receiuing none, he is extreamely incensed and inraged to see himselfe thus sleighted and forgotten of him, when exasperated by his misery, and animated by his extream pouerty and indigence, in that he is now enforced to sell away his apparell, and so to vncloth his backe, thereby to feed his belly, he intends no more to request and pray him, but now resolues to touch him to the quicke, the which he doth in these few lines which he sends him to Millan by a messenger of purpose.  fifty Ducatons, to free me from this my miserable imprisonment, I make no doubt but this my second will, for being a Souldier, I giue thee to vnderstand, that I hold it farre more generous to hange then starue; sith as a halter is onely the beginning of my friends sorrowes: so it will likewise be the end of all mine owne miseries: yea, if thou speedily furnish and accomplish not my request, although it cost me my life, I will no longer conceale how thou diddest hire Pedro and my selfe for two hundred Duckatons to giue Signior Baretano his death, which at thy request wee performed: Thinke then how neere my secresie concernes thy life, sith when I suffer death, I know thou hast but a short and poore time left thee to suruiue mee: Therefore thanke thy selfe, if thy ingratitude turne my affection into contempt, and that into reuenge and malice. Leonardo.  Now although Leonardo meane not as hee write, yet this his messenger comming to Millan , and not finding Albemare at his house, hee knowes not (and is resolute) what to doe, either to stay his comming in, or to deliuer his Letter to some of his seruants: But wayting at his doore till late in the euening, and hearing no newes of him, he giues it to Valerio , and (without telling him from whom, or whence it came) prayes him safely to deliuer it to his Master, and that hee will repaire thither the next morning for an answer. Valerio claps the Letter into his pocket, awayting his masters comming: but hee is so bad a husband to himselfe, and so disloyall, and vnkinde a one to his chaste and faire wife, as hee was out all night with his Courtisans, which good and vertuous Lady, euen pierceth her heart with griefe and sorrow. Now Valerio seeing his Master absent, his comming incertaine, and himselfe inforced to goe fooorth about his affaires, he placeth the Letter vpon a Cupboard neere his masters study, that it might be apparant to his eye when he came in, and so departs. But here the mercy and prouidence of God inuites the Christian Reader, to admire and wonder at the strange discouery and detection of this Letter: for as Albemare (more for sport then charitie) kept a man-foole of some fortie yeres old in his house, who indeed was so naturally peeuish, as not Millan , hardly Italy , could match him for simplicitie. It so chanced, that this harmelesse foole gate into the roome after Valerio , and saw him put vp this Letter on the cupboard: Now, as Children and Fooles may in some sort be tearmed cousin germaine to Apes, so as soone as Valerio was departed, this foole (no doubt ledde wholly by the direction and finger of God , rather then by his owne proper ignorance and simplicitie) gets into the chamber, and taking a stoole to ascend the Cupboard, he brings away the Letter, which both in the hall and yard he tosses and dandles in his hand, as if this newe found play gaue delight and content to his extrauagant and simple thoughts: when, behold our sweet and vertuous Clara comming from Saint Ambrose Church, where she had been to here Vespres , and seeing a faire letter fast sealed in the fooles hand, shee enquires of him from whence hee had it? who singing and hopping, and still playing with the Letter, shee could get no other answere from him, but That it was his Letter, and that God had sent it him, that God had sent it him: which speeches of his, he often redoubled. When Clara weighing his wordes, and considering out of whose mouth they came, her heart instantly began to grow, and her colour to rise, as if God and her soule prompted her, that shee had some interest in that letter: wherupon snatching it from the foole, whom she left crying in the Hall for the losse therof: she seeing it directed to her Husband, goes to the parlor, attended by Adriana ,  & there sitting down in a chaire, & breaking vp the seales therof, she begins to read it; but when she draws towards the conclusion thereof, and finds that it was her husband Albemare's who had caused her deare Louer and Friend Baretano to be murthered: then not able to containe her selfe for sorrow, she throwes her selfe on the floore, and weepes and sighes so mournfully, as the most obduratest and flintiest heart could not choose but relent into pitie to see her: for sometimes shee lookt vp to heauen, and then againe deiecting her eyes to earth, now wringing her hands, and then crossing her armes, in such disconsolate and afflicted manner, as Adriana could not likewise refraine from teares to behold her: when after a deepe and profound silence, shee bandying and euaporating many volleys of far fetched sighes into the ayre, shee commaunding Adriana forth, the doore shut, with the two extremities of passion and sorrow, she alone vtters these mournfull speeches to her selfe: And shall Clara liue to vnderstand, that her Baretano was murthered for her sake, and by her vnfortunate husband Albemare? and shall she any more lye in bedde with him, who so inhumanely hath layen him in his vntimely and bloody graue? And Clara, Clara , wilt thou prooue so vngratefull to his memory, and to the tender affection he bore thee, as not to lament, not to seeke to reuenge this his disasterous and cruell end? when againe, her teares interrupting her words, and her sighes her teares; shee entring into a further consultation with her thoughts and Conscience, her heart and her soule at last continues her speech in this manner: O, but vnfortunate and wretched Clara , what speakest thou of reuenge? for consider with thy selfe, yea forget not to consider, Baretano was but thy friend, Albemare is thy husband; the first loued thee in hope to marry thee, but thou art maried to the second, and therefore thou must loue him; and although his ingratitude and infidelitie towards thee, make him vnworthy of thy affection; yet ye two are but one flesh, and therefore consider, that malice is a bad aduocate, and reuenge a worse Iudge: But here againe remembring what a foule and odious crime murther was in the sight of the Lord, that the discouery thereof infinitely tended to his glory and honour, and that the poore Foole was doubtlesse inspired from heauen, to affirme that God sent the letter: she knowes that her bonds of conscience to her Sauiour , must exceed and giue a law to those of her dutie towards her husband; and therfore preferring Heauen before Earth, and God before her Husband, shee immediately calles for her Coach, and goes directly to Baretano's Vnckle, Seignior Giouan de Montefiore , and with sighes and teares shewes him the letter, who formerly, though in vaine, had most curiously and exactly hunted to discouer the murtherers of his Nephew. Montefiore first reads the letter with teares, then with ioy; and then turning towards the Lady Clara , he commends her zeale and Christian fortitude towards God , in shewing her how much the discouery of this murther tended to his glory; and so presently sends away for the President Criminell ; who immediatly repayring thither, hee acquaints him therewith, shewes him the Letter, and prayes him to examin the Lady Clara thereon; which with much modesty and equitie he doth, and then returnes with her to her house, and there likewise examineth the Foole where hee had the Letter: who out of his inciuilitie and simplicitie, takes the President by the hand, and bringing him to the Cupboard, tells him, Here God sent the Letter, and here I found him: when Valerio being present, and imagining by his Ladies heauy and sorrowfull countenance, that this Letter had perhaps brought her into some affliction and danger, he looking on the direction of the Letter; as also on the Seale, he reueales both to the President , and his Lady , that he receiued that Letter from one whom hee knew not, and that he left it purposely on the Cupboard for his Master against his comming. The President being fully satisfied herein, admires at Gods prouidence, reueiled in the simplicity of this poore harmlesse foole; in bringing this Letter, which brought the murther of Baretano to light (when knowing that God doth many times raise vp the foolish and weake to confound the wise  & mightie things of the world) he presently grants out a Commission to apprehend Albemare ; who being then found in bed with Marina , one of the most famous Beauties, and reputed Courtezans of Millan: Hee both astonished, and amazed, by the iust iudgement of God, is drawen from his beastly pleasures and adulteries to prison: where being charged to haue hyred Pedro and Leonardo to haue murthered Baretano , he stoutly denyes it. But Leonardo's letter being read him, and he thereon adiudged to the Racke, his Soule and Conscience ringing him many thundring peales of terrour, hee there at large confesseth it: when for this foule and bloody fact of his, hee the same afternoone is condemned to be hanged the next morning, at the common place of Execution, which administreth matter of talke, and admiration throughout all Millan ; when Sericants are likewise sent away to Pauia , to bring Leonardo to Mallan , who not so much as once dreamt or thought that euer this his letter would haue produced him this danger and misery. And now Albemare aduertised of the manner how this Letter of Leonardo was brought to light, (without looking vp to Heauen from whence this vengeance iustly befell him for his sinnes) he curseth the crueltie of his wife, the simplicitie of the foole, but most bitterly exclaymeth against the remissenesse and carelesnesse of his seruant Valerio , in not retayning and keeping that letter, which is the only cause of his death: yea, hee is so farre transported with choller against him, as although he haue but a few houres to liue, yet he vowes he wil assuredly cry quittance with him ere he die. Now the charitie of his Iudges send him Diuines that night in prison, to prepare and cleare his conscience, and to confirme and fortifie his soule against the morne, in his last conflict with the world, and her flight and transmigration to heauen; who powerfully and religiously admonishing him, that if hee haue committed any other notorious offence or crime, he should now doe well to reueale it: He likewise there and then confesseth, how he had caused his man Valerio to poyson Pedro with wine in prison, the very night before he was executed: whereupon this bloody and execrable wretch (according to his hellish deserts) is likewise apprehended and imprisoned. And now Gods mercy and iustice brings this vnfortunate (because irreligious) Gentleman Albemare to receiue condigne punishment for those his two horrible murthers, which he had caused to bee committed on the persons of Baretano and Pedro , who ascending the ladder in presence of a world of spectators, who flocked from all parts of the Citie to see him take his last farewell of the world: The sight and remembrance of his foule crimes, hauing now made him not onely sorrowfull, but repentant, he briefly deliuered these few words: He confessed, that he had hired Pedro and Leonardo to kill Baretano in the street, and seduced his seruant Valerio to poyson Pedro in prison; wherof with much griefe and contrition hee heartily repented himselfe, and besought the Lord to forgiue it him: he likewise besought Leonardo and Valerio to forgiue him, in respect hee knew he was the cause of their deaths; because hee was sure they should not long suruiue him. He likewise forgaue his Foole, as being assured, that it was not he in the Letter, but God in him that had reuealed the Letter for his iust punishment and confusion. And lastly, he with many teares forgaue his wife and Lady Clara , whom he affirmed from his heart, was by farre too vertuous for so dissolute and vild an husband as himselfe. He blamed himselfe, for neglecting to loue her; and cursed his Queanes and Courtezans, as being the chief cause of all his miseries, when requesting all that were present to pray for his soule, he was turned off. But his Iudges seeing that he had added murther to murther, they held it Iustice to adde punishment to his punishment; and so he is no sooner cut downe, but they cause his body to be burnt, and his ashes to bee throwen into the ayre, which is accordingly performed. Now, because the Lord in his Iustice, will punish aswell the Agents as the Authors of murther; whiles Albemare is acting the last Seane and Catastrophie of his Tragidy: His wretched hireling Leonardo and his execrable seruant Valerio , are likewise arraigned, found guilty, and condemned to be hang'd for their senerall murthers of Baretano and Pedro ; and so the very same afternoone, they are brought to their Executioners, where Leonardo his former life and profession hauing made him know better how to sinne, then repent; hee out of a souldier-like brauery, (or rather vanity) thinkes rather to terrifie death, then that death should terrifie him; hee begging pardon for his sinnes in generall of God and the world, and then bidding the hangman doe his office, hee takes his last adiew of the world. When immediately Valerio ascends the ladder, who hauing repentance in his heart, and griefe and sorrow in his lookes; as neere as could be obserued and gathered, spake these words: That being poore both in friends and meanes, the onely hope of preferment vnder his master, made him at his request to poyson Pedro in prison; That many times since he hath heartily grieued for it, and now from his very soule repents himselfe of it, and beseeching the Lord to forgiue it him, That he was as guilty of this murther, as innocent of Baretano's ; yea, or of the knowledge thereof, before his master was imprisoned for the same, and that as this was his first Capitall crime, so sith he must now die, he reioyced it was his last, and so praying all seruants to beware by his miserable example not to be seduced to commit murther, either by their masters, or the deuil; and beseeching all that were present to pray for his foule, he resigning and commending it into the hands of his Redeemer, was likewise turned off. And these were the miserable (yet deserued) ends of these bloody murtherers; and thus did Gods iustice and reuenge, triumphe ouer their crimes, and themselues, by heaping and rayning downe confusion on their heads from heauen, when the deuill (fasly) made them beleeue they sate secure; yea, when they least dreamt thereof on earth: Oh that the sight and remembrance of their punishments may restraine and deterre vs from conspiring and committing the like crimes! so shall wee liue fortunate, and die happie; whereas they died miserably, because they liued impiously and prophanely. And heere fully to conclude and shut vp this History, and therein as I thinke to giue some satisfaction to the curiosity of the Reader, who may perchance desire to know what became after of the fayre and vertuous Clara . Why her sorrowes were so infinite, and their quality and Nature so sorrowfull, as being weary of the world, and as it were weighed downe with the incessant vanities, crosses and afflictions thereof: she (notwithstanding the power and perswasions of her parents) assumes her former resolution, to retire and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) sequester her selfe from conuersing with the world, and so enters into the Nunnery of the Annuntiation (so famous in Millan ) where for ought I know, or can since vnderstand to the contrary: she yet liues a pensiue and solitarie sister. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE Against the crying and execrable Sinne of Murther. History XIII.  La Vasselay poysoneth her Wayting-mayd Gratiana , because shee is ielous that her husband De Merson is dishonest with her; whereupon hee liues from her: In reuenge whereof, she causeth his man La Villete to murther him in a Wood, and then marries him in requitall. The sayd La Villete a yeare after riding through the same wood, his Horse falles with him, and almost kills him; when he confesseth the murther of his master De Merson , and accuseth his wife La Vasselay to bee the cause thereof: So for these their bloody crimes, he is hanged, and she burnt aliue.  vnder that glorious and sanctified Title , we seeke to prophane and deface the glory of Christ , in cruelly murthering our brethren his members; effects, not of Zeale , but of Rage; not of Pietie , but of Madnesse, inuented by the Deuill, and perpetrated by none but by his Agents, lamentable effects; yea, I say, bloody and infernall crimes, which still ruine those who contriue and confound those who finish them: For let vs but looke from Earth to Heauen , from Sathan to God , from Nature to Grace , and from our Hearts to our Soules, and we shall assuredly find it very difficult for vs to define, whether Charitie be a sweeter Vertue , or Malice a fouler Vice ; whether that be more secure, or this pernitious, fatall, and dangerous; whether that bee a more apparant testimony of God's sauing Grace towards vs, or this of our owne ineuitable perdition, and reprobation. And as it is an odious sinne, and displeasing sacrifice in the sight of God , for a stranger to kill another: O then how much more execrable and diabolicall must it be, for a Gentlewoman to poyson her Wayting-mayd, and for a seruant to pistoll his master to death, at the instigation of the fame Gentlewoman his wife: for murthers, no lesse ingrateful and cruell, doth this subsequent History report and relate: wherin we shall see, that God in the Triumphs of his reuenging Iustice , and out of his sacred and secret prouidence, hath in all poynts made their punishments as sharpe and seuere as their crimes were bloody, and deplorable: May wee then reade it to Gods glory, and our owne consolation, which we shall assuredly performe, if wee hate the like crimes in others, and detest them in ourselues. of the Prouince of Maine in France , in the very latter yeares that the Marshall of Boys-Daulphin was Gouernor thereof, vnder the present King Lewes XIII . his master) there dwelt a Gentlewoman (aged of threescore and three yeares) tearmed La Vasselay , being well descended, and left very rich, (as well in lands, as mooueables) by her late deceased husband; Monsier Froyset , who was slaine in the behalfe of the Queene Mother, in the defence of Pont de Scy , assaulted and taken by the King her sonne. Now although this olde widdow La Vasselay (in respect of her Age ) was farre more fit to seek God in the Church , then a new Husband in her bed; yet she is weary of a single life, although it be not fully six moneths since shee had buried her second husband; (for the Reader must vnderstand, she had formerly buried her first, at least fiue and twentie yeares before, and is now againe resolued to take a third) and albeit shee knew that the ciuilitie of the widdows in France , was such, that they seldome marry, but almost neuer within the tearme of a whole yeare; yet her conceit and fancie thinks it not onely lawfull, but fit to breake this too austere custome; and therefore she peremptorily resolues to liue a wife, and not to dye a widdow. But this resolution of hers, were she either in the Summer or the Autumne of her yeares, had been as excusable and praise- worthy, as now it sauoured of vndecency and inconstancy, sith shee was in the Winter thereof: For Age , despight of her Youth , and youthfull desires, had throwen snow on her head, and new dyed the colour of her haire from black to white; yea, she was so farre from retayning any signes or reliques of an indifferent beautie, as the furrowes of her face could not iustly shew any ruines or [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) demolutions therof; and yet (forsooth) she will marry againe. Now her Birth and wealth, rather then her Vertues and personage, inuite many old widdowers, and some rich Gentlemen and Counsellors of the famous Presidiall Court of that Citie to seeke her in marriage; and indeed, both for lands and money, none her inferiours, but all at least her equals, and some her betters: But in vaine, for the vanitie of her thought, suggest her, that either she is too young for them, or they too old for her; and therefore she will haue none of them: yea, her lust seemes so youthfully to giue a law to her age, and the lye to her yeares, as she casts off her mourning attire, deckes her selfe vp in gay apparell, powders her hayre, paynts her face, with a resolution (forsooth) to haue no old Dotard , but a young Gallant to her husband, as if therein she wholly placed, not only her content, but her felicitie: But we many times see such irrigular desires, and such incontinent designes, met with vnexpected misery, and vnthought of repentance. Now during the time, that the vaine carriage  & deportment of this old Gentlewoman & widdow La Vasselay , made her selfe the laughture, and by- word of all Mans ; home comes a young Gentleman of this Countrey of Maine , tearmed Monsieur de Merson , from his trauell in Italy , whose Father dwelt betwixt La Vall , and Grauelle , tearmed Monsieur de Manfrelle , being a Gentleman well descended and rich, and to whom De Merson was second sonne, who in a yeares abscence in Italie , being purposely sent thither by his father to inrich his experience and capacitie (which is the true essence and glory of a traueller, thereby to be the more capable to ferue his Prince and Countrey , as also to be a comfort to his age  & a second prop to his house and lynage) hee had made such poore and vnprofitable vse of his trauels, as forgetting the obtayning of the Language and all generous exercises, perfections and quallities (so requisite and gracefull in Gentlemen) he delighted in nothing so much; nay, in nothing else, but to passe his time with Courtisans and strumpets, especially in Venice, Rome , and Naples ; where for his sakes, and their laciuious pleasures he built vp the greatest part of his Residence; where he so prodigally spent and exceeded his Fathers exhibition; as he returnes into France , not loden with Vertues and Experience , but with Vices and Debts ; being otherwise ignorant in all things which hee should know, and knowing nothing but that wherein he should be ignorant. Onely to the end he might therby set the better counterfeit tincture on himselfe, and false lustre on his Endowments and Profficiency , he superficicially brought away, or rather borowed some Italian phrases, and complements, which hee thought would not only passe currant with the Gentlemen and Ladies of France , but also draw them into admiration, aswell of himselfe as them: When immediatly vpon his arriuall, that he might the better see and make himselfe seene of the world, he flaunts it out in braue apparrell, both in L'avall, Angiers , and Mans ; Yea, there is scarce any great feast or marriage in all those parts: but if he be not enuited, yet he purposely enuites himselfe thereat, thereby to make himselfe the more conspicuous and apparant to the eyes of the world, especiall of the Ladies and Gentlewomen , in whose acquaintance and fauour, he not only endeauours to initiate, but striues to ingraft himselfe: But his olde Father Manfrelle iudiciously obseruing the vaine behauiour, and light deportment and carriage of this his sonne, he exceedingly grieues thereat, because he had well hoped, that his trauels would haue returned him, as capable and discreet, as now he finds him ignorant, and which is worse, deboshd; sith he well knew that either of these two vices was enough sufficient and powerfull, not only to ruine his reputation, but his fortunes. Againe, to adde more sorrowes to his griefe, and more discontent to his sorrowes for the vanitie and leuity of this his sonne, euery weeke, nay almost euery day, brings him in new bils of his debts; a third falling in vpon the necke of the first and second, and a fourth on the third: which being greater then his estate, or at least his pleasure would permit him to pay; he takes his sonne De Merson aside,  & very sharply checkes him for his old and new prodigalities: vowes that he will neither sell or morgage his lands to discharge his foolish debts; and therefore bids him looke to satisfie them, for that hee is resolued not to see, much lesse, not to speake with any of his Creditors, how great, or small soeuer the summes be he owes them. This cooling card of Manfrelles makes his sonne De Merson , not onely bite his lippes for sorrow, but hange his head for anger and vexation, yea, his folly doth so ecclipse and oueruaile his iudgement herein, as in stead of making good vse hereof, he takes a contrary resolution, and so resolues to embrace and follow the worst: for whereas hee should haue made his pride and prodigality strike saile, and now rather seeke to reintegrate himselfe into his Fathers fauour, then any way futurely attempt to incense or exasperate him against him; he onely taking counsell of his Youth, Passions , and Choller , (which as false and treacherous guides most commonly lead vs to misery and repentance:) againe precipitates and ingulphes himselfe afresh in new debts, both with his Vsurer, Mercer , and Taylor: and no longer able to digest his Fathers checkes and frownes: he very inconsiderately and rashly packes vp his bagage, leaues his house, rides to Mans ,  & there resolus to passe his time that winter: partly hoping that his Father will discharge his debts in his abscence: but more especially to becom acquainted with the beauties of that City, therby to obtain some rich yong heire, or old widow for his wife, whose estate and wealth might support his pride, and maintaine his excessiue prodigalitie & voluptuousnesse: and indeed although the two former of these his hopes deceiue him; yet he shall shortly finde and see, that the third and last will not. Liuing thus in Mans , the brauery of his apparell and equipage, the freenesse of his expences, his comely talke, personage, blacke beard, and sanguin complexion makes him assoone acquainted and affected, as knowen of many Ladies and Gentlewomen, and far the more, because they know his father De Manfrelle , to be a very antient and rich Gentleman of that Countrey of Maine , and although he is not his heire, yet in regard he is his second sonne, as also a Traueller, he was the more honoured and respected of all those he frequented: so that the very fame and name of Monsier de Merson began to be already diuulged and knowen in the Citie; yea, and because he was a great Balladine , or Dancer , there was no solemn assembly, either publique or priuate, but still De Merson made one; and there was not a reputed beauty, or supposed courteous Lady in Mans , or thereabouts, but such was his vanity, as he soone wrought and insinuated himselfe into her acquaintance and familiaritie, the which he made not onely his delight, but his glory. And although that in a small time, the wiser sort of the Gentlemen and Ladies of the City found his wit and experience to come infinitely short of his braue apparell; yet the more illiterate and ignorant of them, (who esteeme all men by their lustre, not by their braue worth) as preferring gay apparell and the comelinesse of the body before the exquisite indowments, and perfections of the mind; they hold him in so high a repute and esteeme, as they thinke him to be the most absolute Gallant , not onely of Mans , but of all the Countrey of Maine ; so easie it is to captiuate the conceits and iudgements of those who only build their iudgements in their conceits, and not their conceits in iudgement. And of this ranke and number was our old widdow La Vasselay , who hauing many times heard of De Mersons fame, and comely personage, and seene him once at a sermon, and twice at two seuerall Nuptiall feasts, where his skill and agilitie proued him to be one of the prime dauncers, shee is so farre in loue with him, as in her thoughts and heart, she wisheth she had giuen halfe her estate and dowrie, conditionally that she were his wife, and he her husband: yea, she is so rauished with the comelinesse of his feature, and the sweetnesse of his complexion and countenance; as all the world is not halfe so deare to her as De Merson , nor any man whatsoeuer by many thousand degrees, so dilitious to her eye,  & pleasing to her heart & soule as himselfe. And although she be in the frozen Zone of her age, yet her intemperate lust maks her desires so youthfully intemperate, as forgetting reason and modestie, (that the best vertue of our soule, and this the chiefest ornament of our body) shee a thousand times wisheth, that either De Merson were impalled in her armes, or shee incloystered in his. But doting (yea I may well neere truely say) dying old Gentlewoman, is this a time for thee to think of a young Husband , when one of thy old feet is as it were in thy graue? or being in thy Clymactericall yeare of threescore  & three, art thou yet so fraughted with leuity, & exempt of continency, as thou wilt needs seek to marry one of fiue and twentie? Foolish La Vasselay , if it bee not now time, yea high time for thee to sacrifice thy desires to continency, when will it be, if euer be? Didst thou resolue to wed a husband neere of thine owne age, and so to end the remainder of thy dayes with him, in chast and holy wedlocke, that resolution of thine were as excusable, as this in desiring so young a one, is worthy, not onely of blame, but of reprehension, and I may say of pitie. Consider, consider with thy selfe, what a preposterous attempt and enterprise is this of thine, that when thou shouldest finish thy dayes in deuotion and prayer, thou then delightest to begin them in concupiscence, and lust. O La Vasselay , mocke at those rebellious and treacherous pleasures of the flesh, which seeme to mocke at thee, yea, to betray thee: and if there bee yet any sparke of thy youth, which lies burning vnder the embers of thy age, why if thy chaste thoughts cannot, yet let modesty, or at least pietie extinguish them. God hath already giuen thee two husbands; is it not now therefore time, yea, more then time, for thee to prepare to giue thy selfe to God . Hitherto the chastitie of thy youth hath made thee happy; and wilt thou now permit, that the lust of thine age make thee vnfortunate, or peraduenture miserable; and that the puritie and candeur of that be distained and polluted by the foulenesse and obscenitie of this. Alas, alas , incontinent and inconsiderate Gentlewoman , of a graue Matron, become not a youthfull Gigglet; or if thou wilt not suffer the eyes of thy body, at least [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) permit not those of thy soule to looke from thy painted cheekes, to thy snow- white haire, who can informe and tell thee, that thou art far fitter for Heauen then earth, sith those pleasures are transitory, and these eternall, for God , then a husband, sith he onely can make thee blessed, whereas (in reward of thy lasciuious lust) this peraduenture may bee reserued to make thee both vnfortunate and wretched. But the vanitie of this old Gentlewomans thoughts and desires, doe so violently fix and terminate, on the youth and beautie of young, and (as she immodestly tearmes him) faire De Merson , as the onely consideration of her delight and pleasure, weighes downe all other respects: so that neither Reason nor Modesty, aduise nor perswasion, can preuaile with her resolution, to diuert her affection from him; but loue him shee doth, and (which is repugnant as well to the instinct of Nature, as to the influence of modestie, and rules of ciuilitie) seeke him for her husband she will: yea, she is already become so sottish in her affection, and so lasciuiously feruent in her desires towards him, that her heart thinkes of him by day, her soule by night; that admires him as the very life of her felicitie, and thus adores him, as the onely content and glory of her life: shee will not see the greatnesse of her owne estate and wealth, nor consider the smallnesse of his meanes and hopes, in that hee is not an heire, but a second brother; she will not enquire after his debts and vices, to know what those may be, what these are; she will not thinke what a preposterous disparitie there is betwixt the fire of his youth, and the ice of her age; nor what a world of discontents and afflictions are incident to proceed thereof: shee will not consider, that in endowing him with all her wealth, that she therby impouerisheth many, as well of her owne kindred, as of those of her two former husbands, to whom in the right of Nature it more iustly and properly belongs: and to conclude and shut vp this poynt, shee will not imagine or dreame, to how many laughters, and scandalls of the world shee exposeth her selfe, who will not onely call her discretion, but her modestie in question, for matching with so young a Gentleman as De Merson , to whom for age, shee may not onely well bee mother, but, (which is more) grandmother: But contrariwise, this foolish old Gentlewoman , hauing sent her witts a wooll-gathering on his sweet and comely personage; his youth and her affection, like two impetuous torrents, and furious inundations, beare downe all other respects and considerations before them: yea, they so submerge her reason, and quite drowne her discretion, as shee hath no eyes vnshut to see the one, nor eares vnstopped to heare the other: so that if shee desire any thing in the world, it is (as formerly is obserued) that shee liue to see De Merson her husband, and her selfe his wife: which to effect and accomplish, she knowes no better nor fitter Agent to imploy herein, then one Monsieur de Pruneau , an ancient Councellour of the Presidiall Court of that Citie, who was the onely Councellor both to her last husband, and her selfe, and of whose discretion, integritie and fidelitie, she had all the reasons of the world to rest confident and assured. Now although the Wisdome and Experience of De Pruneau suggested him what an extreame inequalitie there was betwixt De Mersons youth, and La Vasselays age, which he could not more pertinently paralell and compare, then to Winter and Summer, the Spring and the Haruest: and therfore how many afflictions and miseries were subiect to attend and wait on such preposterous mariages, whereof he had formerly seene diuers lamentable examples, and wofull instances as well of men as women, who had suffered shipwrack vpon that Sylla & this Charybdis , he like an honest man, and indeed a truer friend to her, then she was to her selfe, produceth some of the former alledged reasons to her consideration, thereby to diuert the streame of her ill grounded affection from De Merson , and (in generall tearmes) to conuey and conduct it to some elder personage, whose yeares (and therefore their dispositions and affections) might the better agree and sympathize. But when he sees that her loue to De Merson was so firmly and immoueably setled, as that it not onely appeared to him, to be her griefe, but her torment to be any way crossed or contradicted therein: then he changeth his language, and because she will not hearken to his aduise, he therfore giues way to her resolution, promising her his vtmost power, and best endeauors speedily to effect and compasse her desires; when taking leaue each of other, at last La Vasselay remembring she had forgotten something, calles him againe, and prayes him, that if De Merson be inquifitiue to know her direct age, that he substract away at least ten yeares thereof: so that whereas she is sixtie three, to affirme that shee is very little aboue fiftie: whereunto she her selfe blushing, De Pruneau not able likewise to refraine from smiling, promiseth her to be very mindfull thereof. To which end, he (with the first conueniency finds out De Merson , acquaints him how much hee is obliged to Madamoyselle La Vasselay , for her affection to him, layes before him the Nobilitie of her discent and blood, the greatnesse of her Estate and meanes, as also the excellency of her vertues; that fiftie yeares is the most of her age, and that she is not by farre so old, as pleasing and louely; that shee affects him aboue all the men of the world, yea, and desires no man of the world for her husband but himselfe; and that when he pleaseth, she desires the honour of his company to her house, with many other intimations, and insinuations conducing that way. De Merson hauing formerly vnderstood of La Vasselays rich Estate and Dowry , as also of the truth of her age; he likes the first well, and although he distast, yet he will dissemble the second: he thanks De Pruneau for his paines, and La Vasselay for her loue towards him; promiseth to requite the first, and if her wealth and vertues correspond with his relation to deserue the second; alleaging further, that although there be a great inequalitie in their age, yet sith hee is no heire but a second brother, that it is rather likely then impossible, for it to be a match betwixt them; and in the meane time, to requite part of her affection, he promiseth to Sup with her the night following at her house, where he onely desires his company and assistance, that they may the more effectually and secretly consult of this businesse, which he hopes will so much import as well her good and his content, as her content and his good: and so for that time they part. De Pruneau hauing receiued this pleasing and discreet answere from De Merson , he returnes with the relation, and repetition thereof to La Vasselay , vowes that his exteriour feature is no way answerable, but comes farre short of his interior Vertues and discretion; and that by all which, hee eyther can collect from his speeches, or gather from his deportment and behauiour, he is in his conceit the most accomplished Gentleman , not onely of Maine , but of France ; and so bids her prepare her Supper, and her selfe to entertaine him the next night. Which answere of De Mersons , and relation of De Pruneau , is so pleasing to her heart and thoughts, as her age seemes to bee already rauished with ioy at the conceyt of his Youth: when thinking euery minute a moneth, and euery houre a yeare, before shee be made happy, and her house blessed with his presence, shee leaues no cost vnspared, or vnspent, to make his Entertainement answerable to his welcome: whereof whiles shee is not onely carefull, but curious in prouiding, let vs cursorily speake a word or two how De Merson entertaines and digesteth this vnexpected motion and affection of La Vasselay . He laughes in his sleeue to see her youthfull affections so flourishing in this Atumne , nay, in this Winter of her age, as to desire and seeke so young a Gentleman as himselfe for her husband, but he vnderstands she is exceeding rich, and therefore resolues that this vertue is capable to ouervalue and ransome that defect and error of hers. He sees that his father will not pay his debts, and that he of himselfe cannot; that they growing more clamorous, will shortly become scandalous: which will not onely directly preuent, but infallibly ruine his fortunes. He considereth how displeasing her age will be to his youth, as also that there is no hell comparable to that of a discontented bed, and then againe, his debosht and lustfull thoughts, suggest him this remediy: That Mans hath [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) beautie enough for him to recreate himselfe, and to passe his time with; and that although she haue him sometimes in her bed, yet he may haue younger lasses and Ladies in his armes, both when, and where he pleaseth: He considereth that rich widdowes are not so soone found, as sought, nor so soone obtained as found; and that if he refuse La Vasselay this day, he may not onely repent it to morrow, but perchance all the dayes of his life; and although his will may, his power shall not be able to repaire or redresse this error of his, all his life after: He is not ignorant that Gentlewomen of her age and wealth, are subiect to be as soone lost as won in a humor: and therefore then lost, because not then won. Againe that the elder she is, the sooner she will die, and he then is at liberty to marry as young a Virgin as he pleaseth, and that her wealth would then proue a true proppe, and sweet comfort to his age. And to conclude and finish this consultation of his, she is without children to molest and trouble him, and therefore to be desired, she is vertuous, discreet, and of an excellent fame and reputation, and therefore deserues to bee accepted and not refused. Vpon the grounds of which reasons and considerations, he makes good his promise to De Pruneau , and comes the next night both to visite,  & suppe with La Vasselay ; who hauing purposely deckt her selfe vp in her youthfull and gayest apparell; receiues him, withall demonstrations of affection and ioy. At his first arriuall he affords her two or three kisses, whereat she infinitely both reioyceth and triumpheth: and in a word, he finds that his welcome not onely exceeds his deserts, but his expectation; and beleeue me it was woorth the obseruation, to see how superficially his youth looked on her age, and how artificially and lustfully her age gazed on his youth. Now, by this time supper is serued in, wherein her affection was againe discouered him in the curiosity and bounty thereof. Where De Pruneau to giue life to their mirth, tells them both, that he hopes this their first meeting and enteruiew will produce effects answerable to both their contents and desires; Whereat De Merson cannot refraine from blushing, nor La Vasselay from smiling: They are all very pleasant and iocond at table, and she to giue the better edge and relish to his affection, striues to seeme farre younger then indeed she is, and then he knowes her to be; yea, she doth so cunningly entermixe and dispierce youthfull speeches amidst her aged grauity, as if she were not old, or at least, newly made young. Now whiles she feasted her eyes on his fresh countenance and faire complexion, he sends his abroad to looke on her plate, rich hangings, and houshold stuffe, wherwith he saw her house was richly and plentifully furnished: Supper ended, and the cloth taken away, they are no sooner fallen from their Viands, but they fall to their talke. De Merson kindly and familiarly taking his new old Mistris in his Armes , as if he had already giuen her a place in his heart and affections: which makes her beyond her selfe, both merry and ioyfull. I will not trouble the Reader with the repetition of what speeches and complements here past betwixt them: because in this, and my future Histories I will follow the same Methode of breuity which I haue proposed and obserued in my former. Let then his inquisitiue curiositie vnderstand, that they parted very louingly and affectionately this first time: and De Merson although he were a deboshed Gentleman , yet he is not so simple to omit, but rather so well aduise to prie into the true depth, and naked truth of her estate; and the rather, for that he hath knowen many Gentlemen who haue been fetc'd ouer, and gull'd in this nature, and in marrying one widow haue match't themselues to two theeues, and credulously thinking her rich, haue in the end found her a very begger: Whereupon he takes three dayes respite to resolue, and so with some kisses and many thankes for her affection, and her kind entertainment and great cheere, he for that night takes his leaue of her, whose fayre carriage and discreet resolution in temporizing, La Vasselay applauds, and De Pruneau approues: So De Merson hauing spent the first and second day in surueying the writings of her Dowry, the Leases of her lands and houses, and the Bonds and Bils of debts due to her, with all her ready Money, Plate, and other moueables: he finds her estate to answere his expectation and her report, and that she is really worth in land, six thousand Francks yerely, and her moueables worth at least eighteene thousand more, he the third day publiquely contracts himselfe to her; and hauing aduertised his father thereof, who likes the wealth better then the widdow, within eight dayes after priuately marries her, which administreth cause of speech and wonder in and about Mans: some blaming her of indiscretion and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) lenity, to match so young a Gentleman , others taxing him of folly to marry so old a widdow; some extolling and applauding his iudgement, in enriching himselfe with so great an Estate: which would not onely deface his debts, secure his youth and age from the stormes of want, and the tempests of necessity, but also in the one and the other maintaine him richly, prosperously, and gallantly. And others againe beleeuing and presaging, that this their great inequality and disparity of yeares, would either of the one side or other, or both, produce many discontents,  & afflictions, instead of hoped-for ioyes and prosperities. Thus euery one speakes differently of this preposterous match, according as their passions and fancies dictate them: but which of all these opinions and iudgements speakes truest, we shall not goe farre to vnderstand and know. We haue seene the cousummation of this marriage, Youth wedded to Age; May to December , and young De Merson to old La Vasselay ; in which contract & nuptials, either of them are so vaine, and both so irreligious, as caring wholly for the pleasures of their bodies, they haue not therein so much as once thought of their soules, or of heauen: Yea, God is not so much as once nominated or remembred of them. All the ends of marriages are onely two; Gods glory , and the propagation of children; and because they cannot hope for the second, must they therfore needs be so impious, as to forget the first. Aye me , if his youth had attained no more Grace, could her age retaine no more goodnesse; or how can they flatter themselues with any hope, that this marriage of theirs can possible prosper, when onely her ayme and end therein is lust, and his wealth. If a building can subsist and flourish, which hath a rotten and reeling foundation, then this match of theirs may prosper, otherwise cannot: for what more rotte the the beastly pleasures of her lustfull, and yet decayed age,  & what more reeling and fickle, then the constant inconstancy of his laciuious youth, which make my thoughts iustly feare, and my heart truely presage and apprehend: that repentance, not pleasure; affliction, not ioy; misery, not prosperity, is at the heeles to attend and follow these their Nuptials: As marke we the sequell and it will briefly informe vs how. De Merson hath not beene married two whole moneths to La Vasselay , but hee begins to repent himselfe that euer hee matched her, for he now sees, though before he would not, that it is impossible for youth to fedge and sympathise with her age, he sees that she hath a decrepit, sickly and decayed body, and that she is neuer free of the Cough and Rheume, as also of an Issue in her left arme, which is not only displeasing, but loathsome to him. Yea, when shee hath taken off her ruffe and head attire, and dighted her selfe in her night habilements, then he vowes he is afraid of her Lambe-skin furred cap and wast-coate; and takes her withered face for a Vizard , or a Commet , which yeelds no delight but terror to his eyes: swearing that he serues onely for a bed-pan to heat her frozen body, which of it selfe is farre colder then a Marble Statue: Yea, he is so farre out of loue with her, because, to write the truth, he neuer truely loued her, that her sight is a plague to him, her presence by day a Purgatory, and her company by night a very Hell. But deboshed and dissolute Gentleman , these vitious and impious conceits of thine, come immediatly from Hell and Sathan , and are no way infused in thy thoughts by Heauen , much lesse inspired in thy heart by God: Consider, consider with thy selfe, that if La Vasselay be old, yet she is now thy wife, and that whatsoeuer De Praneau or her selfe informed thee of fiftie yeares: Yet thou knowest she could not be lesse then sixtie three, and more she is not. In which regard marriage (the holy Institution of Heauen ) hauing now made you of two, one; if thou wilt not loue her age, at least thou sholdest reuerence it; or if thou canst not affect her, thou shouldest not hate her. Hath she imperfections, what woman in the world liues without them? or is she pestered with diseases, who can be either exempted from them, or preuent them? Thou hast vowed in the Temple of the Lord, and in the presence of him and his people, not onely to loue, but to honour her: and is thy inconstancy and impiety already such, as forgetting that promise and vowe of thine, thou dost now not onely dishonour, but despise and contemne her; and that thou onely madest that vow purposely to breake it: O De Merson , if thou art not capable of Counsel, yet do but beleeue the truth, and thou wilt find, that if thou wilt not loue her, because she is too old to be thy wife; yet thou shouldest respect and regard her, because she is old enough to be thy Grandmother: for as it is inciuility not to reuerence Age ; so it is impietie to disdaine and maligne it: and if in any man towards a meere stranger, how much more a husband to his owne wife? And because it is easier to espy our wiues imperfections, then to finde out, or reforme our owne; if thy wife La Vasselay bee guiltie of any fault towards thee, it is because shee loues thee too well, and affects thee too dearely. We haue seene De Mersons distaste of his wife, La Vasselay: Let vs now see how shee likes, or rather why she so soone dislikes him: for he beares himselfe so strangely, and withall, so vnkindly towards her, as her desires of his youth comes farre short both of her expectation and hopes: for if hee lye with her one night, he wanteth sixe from her; is still abroad, and seldome or neuer at home with her; yea, hee is of such a gadding humour, and ranging disposition, as his thoughts and delights are transported elsewhere, not at home; with other young Dames of Mans , not with her selfe: and the vanitie of his pleasures doe so farre surprize and captiuate him, that he is already become so vitious, as he makes day his night, and night his day, liuing rather like a voluptuous Epicure , then a temperate or Ciuill Christian: Neither, quoth shee, is it Iealousie, but truth which makes her prie so narrowly into his lewd and lasciuious actions, wherein the further shee wades, the more cause shee finds both of griefe and vexation, which makes her wish, that shee had beene blind when shee first saw him; and eyther he or her selfe in Heauen , when they so vnfortunately marryed each other here vpon Earth . How now fond and foolish olde Gentlewoman , are thy ioyes so soone conuerted into sorrowes, and thy tryumphes into teares? why, thou hast iust cause to thanke none but thy selfe, for these thy crosses and afflictions; sith thy lustfull and lasciuious desires were not onely the author, but the procurer of them: for hadst thou been more modest, and lesse wanton, thou mightest haue apparantly seene, and prouidently foreseene, that De Mersons youth was too young for thy age, because thy age was too old for his youth; so that hadst thou beene then but halfe so stayed and wise, as now thou art sorrowfull: thou needest not now grieue for that which thou canst not redresse, nor repent for that which is out of thy power to remedy. But rash  & inconsiderate woman, how comes this to passe, that thou art ready to entertaine Ielousie, when death stands ready to entertaine thee? Could all the course of thy former youth be so happy, not to be acquainted with this vice, and doth now thy frozen age thinke it a vertue to admit and embrace it? Ay mee, I grieue to see thy folly, and lament to vnderstand thy madnesse in this kind: for what is Ielousie, but the rage of our thoughts, and braines, the disturber of our peace and tranquilitie, the enemy of our peace and happinesse, the traytour of our iudgement and vnderstanding, the plague of our life, the poyson of our hearts, and the very bane and Canker of our soules? Ielousie, why, it is the daughter of frenzie, and the mother of madnesse; it is a vice purposely sent from hell, to make those wretched on earth, who may liue fortunate and happy, and yet will not; yea, it is a vice which I know not whether it be more easie to admit, or difficult to expell, being admitted. But La Vasselay , expell it thou must, at least, if thou thinke to liue fortunate, and not to die miserable. Wert thou as young as aged, thy Ielousie might haue some colour and excuse in meeting with the censures of the world; whereas now not deseruing the one, it cannot receiue the other. And as those women are both wise and happy, who winke at the youthfull escapes of their husbands: so thy Ielousie makes thee both meritorious, and guiltie of thy afflictions, because thou wilt bee so foolish to espy, and so malicious to remember these of thine. Is De Merson giuen and addicted to other women? why pardon him, because he is a young man: and as he is thy husband, and thou his wife, beleeue that he is euery way more worthy of thy prayers, then of thine enuie. Thus we see vpon what fatall and ominous termes these late maried couple now stand; De Mersons youth scorning and spurning at his wife La Vasselay's age, and wholly addicting himselfe to others; and her age growen infinitely iealous of his youth: so that for any thing I see or know to the contrary, these different vices haue already taken such deepe and dangerous root in them, as they threaten not only the shipwracke of their content, but of their fortunes, if not of their liues. Now for vs to find out the particular obiect of La Vasselayes ielousie, as her foolish curiositie hath already the generall cause: we must know, that she hath a very proper young Gentlewoman who attends her, of some eighteen yeares of age, tearmed Gratiana , of a middle stature, somewhat enclining to fatnesse, hauing a fresh sanguine complexion, and bright flaxen haire, she being indeed euery way exceeding louely and faire; and with this Gratiana , she feares her Husband is more familiar then either modesty or chastity can permit; and yet shee hath onely two poore reasons for this, her credulity  & ielousie, and God knowes they are poore and weake ones indeed: The first is, that shee thinks her owne withered face serues onely but as a foyle, to make Gratiana's fresh beautie seeme the more precious and amiable in his eyes. The second is, that she once saw him kisse her in her presence in the garden, when she brought him a handkercher, which his Page had forgotten to giue him. Ridiculous grounds, and triuiall reasons, for her to build her feare, or erect her ielousie on, or to inuent and rayse so foule a scandall and callumny: and yet not to suppresse, but to report the whole truth, De Merson was lasciuiously in loue with Gratiana , had often attempted her deflouration, but could neuer obtain her consent thereunto: for she was as chaste as faire, and impregnable, either to bee seduced by his gifts and presents, or to be vanquished and wonne by his treacherous promises, protestations, and oathes: for she told him plainly and peremptorily, when she saw him begin to grow importunate, and impudent in this his folly, That although shee were but a poore Gentlemans daughter, yet shee thanked God , that her parents had so vertuously train'd her vp in the Schoole of Honour , that she would rather dye, then liue to be a strumpet to any Gentleman or Prince of the world: which chaste answere, and generous resolution of hers, did then so quench the flames of his lasciuious and inordinate affection to her, as thencefoorth hee exchanged his lust into loue towards her, and vowed, that he would both respect  & honour her as his sister. Now although they both kept the passage of this businesse secret from his wife her Mistris, yet notwithstanding, as it is the nature of Ielousie, not to hearken to any reason, nor approue of any beliefe but of her owne: therefore shee is confident, that he lyes with Gratiana more oftner then with her selfe; which she vowes she cannot digest, and will no longer tolerate. To which end, (with a most malicious, and strange kind of treachery) she makes faire weather with Gratiana ; and (thinking to coole her hote courage, and to allay the heat of her luxurious blood) looking one day stedfastly in her face, she tells her that shee hath need to be let blood, to preuent a Feuer: whereunto, although chaste and innocent Gratiana was neuer formerly let blood, she notwithstanding willingly consents thereunto; which to effect, La Vasselay (like a base mistris, and a treacherous stepdame) sends for an Apothecary , named Rennee , giues him a watch-word in his eare, to draw at least sixteene ounces of blood from Gratiana , for that she was strongly entred into a burning Feuer: But he being as honest, as shee was treacherous and cruell, told her, that the drawing of so great a quantitie of blood from her, might not only impaire her health, but indanger her life. But she replies, it was so ordered by a Doctor: whereupon he opens her right arme veyne; and as he had neere drawen so much from this poore harmelesse young Gentlewoman , shee faints twice in a chayre betwixt their armes, and all the cold water they threw in her face, could very hardly refetch her, and keepe life in her: this old hard-hearted hagge, still notwithstanding crying out, that it was not blood enough; hauing no other reason for this her treachery and crueltie, but that indeed she thought it not enough, or sufficient to quench the vnquenchable thirst and flame of her ielousie: of which this is the first effect towards this innocent young Gentlewoman, but we shall not goe farre to see a second. Gratiana is so farre from dreaming of her mistris ielousie towards her master, and her selfe; or from once thinking of this her trecherous letting her blood, as she thanks her, for her affection and care of her health: and now the very next day after De Merson dyning at home with his old wife, (which he had not done in many dayes before) and seeing Gratiana looke so white and pale, demaunds her if she bee not well, and then questioneth his wife what ayles her Gentlewoman to looke so ill, which she seemes to put off with a feigned excuse: but withall (as if this care of her husband towards Gratiana , were a true conformation of their dishonesty, and her ielousie) she retaynes the memory thereof deepely in her heart and thoughts: yea, it is so frequent, and fixed in her imaginations, as she cannot, she will not any longer suffer or indure this affection of her husband to Gratiana ; nor that Gratiana's youth shal wrong La Vasselay's age in the rites and duties of marriage. Wherfore casting sad aspects on him, and malignant lookes on her, she to please, and giue satisfaction to her ielousie (which cannot be pleased or satisfied with any thing but reuenge) resolues to make her know what it is, for a wayting maid to offend and wrong her mistris in this kind: when not to deminish, but rather to augment and redouble her former cruelty towards her. Her husband riding one day abroad in company of diuers other Gentlemen of the Citie, to hunt Wolues which abound in those vast and spacious woods of Mayne: she vnder pretence of some other businesse, calls Gratiana alone into her inner chamber, when bolting the doore after her, she with meager and pale enuy in her lookes, and implackable fury and choller in her speeches, chargeth her of dishonesty with her husband; calling her whore, strumpet, and baggage: affirming that the time and houre is now come for her to be reuenged of her. Poore Gratiana both amazed and affrighted at this sudden  & furious (both vnexpected & vndefiled allarum of her Mistris , seeing her honor,  & (as she thinks & fears) her life called in question; she after a world of sighs and teares, tearmes her accusers deuils and witches, vowes by her part of heauen, and vpon the perill of her owne soule, that she is innocent of that crime whereof she accused her, and that neither in deed or thought, she was euer dishonest, or vnchast with any man of the world, much lesse with her Master: But this will not satisfie incensed La Vasselay , neither are these speeches or teares of Gratiana of power to passe current with her ielousie; but reputing them false and counterfeit, she calles in her chamber mayd, and Cooke-mayd, whom she had purposely led there, and bids them vnstrippe Gratiana naked to her wast, and to bind her hand and foot to the bedde post; which with much repyning and pitie, they are at last inforced to doe. When commaunding them forth the chamber, and bolting the doore after them, she not like a woman, but rather as a fury of hell, flies to poore innocent Gratiana , and with a great burchen rod, doth not only raze but [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) crucifie her armes, backe and shoulders: when harmelesse soule, she (though in vayne) hauing no other defensiue weapons but her tongue, and her innocency, cries aloud to heauen and earth for succour. But this old hagge as full of malice as Ielousie, hath no compassion of her cries, nor pitty of her sighes: yea, neither the sight of her teares, or blood, (which trickling downe her cheekes and shoulders, doe both bedew, and ingrayne her smocke) are of power to appease her fury and enuy, vntill hauing spent three rods, and tyred and wearied both her armes, she in the heat of her choller, and the height of her reuenge; deliuers her these bitter and scoffing words. Mynion, this, this is the way, yea the onely way to coole the heate of thy courage, and to quench the fire of thy lust ; When calling in her two mayds, she commaunds them to vnbind Gratiana , and to helpe on her clothes. When triumphing in her cruelty, she furiously departs and leaues them; who cannot refrayne from teares, to see how seuerely and cruelly their Mistris hath handled this her poore Gentlewoman . Gratiana the better to remedy these her insupportable and cruell wrongs, holds it discretion to desemble them, and so prouiding her selfe secretly of a horse and man, she the next night steales away; rides to La Ferte , and from thence to her father at Nogent le Retrou , where he was superintendant of the Prince of Condes house and Castle in that Town;  & where the Princesse Dowager his mother built vp the greatest part of her sorrowfull residence, whiles he was detayned prisoner in the Castle of Boys de Vincennes neere Paris: La Vasselay grieues at this her sudden, and vnexpected departure, the which she feares her husband De Merson , and her Father Monsieur De Bremay will take in ill part; wherein she is no way deceiued, for the one grieues, and the other stormes thereat: yea, when De Merson (through flattery and threats) had drawen from the Chamber- mayd and Cooke-maid, the truth of his wiues cruell whipping of Gratiana , as also the cause thereof, her ielousie: He iustly incensed and inraged, flies to this his sottish and cruell wife, tells her, that ielousie comes from the diuell, whose part he affirms she hath acted, in acting this her cruelty vpon innocent Gratiana , then whom there liues not a chaster maid in the world, That although she were poore, yet, that she was aswell descended as her selfe. In which regard, if she did not speedily right and redeeme her wrongs, and seeke meanes to pacifie and recall her, that he would foorthwith leaue her, yea, and vtterly forsake her. Which cooling card of his to his wife, makes her looke on her former erronius cruelty towards Gratiana , rather with outward griefe, then inward repentance. But seeing that her ielousie must now stoope and strike sayle, to her husbands Choller , and that to enioy his company, she must not be exempted and depriued of hers: she contrary to her desires and will, (which still retaines the fumes and flames of ielousie, as that doth of reuenge) is inforced to make a vertue of necessity, and so to beare vp with the time, feigning her selfe repentant and sorrowfull for what shee had formerly done to Gratiana: shee to reclayme her, buyes her so much wrought blacke Taffety for a Gowne, and so much Crimson Damaske for a Petticote, and with a bracelet of pearle which she accustomed to weare vpon her right arme; she sends it to Nogent to her by La Vilette , a Gentleman of her husbands, and accompanieth it with a letter to her father, Monsieur de Bremay , which contained these words.  Iudgement , I find that I haue wronged thy daughter Gratiana , whereat I grieue, with contrition, and sorrow with repentance, sith my husbands vowes and oathes haue fully cleared her Honour and Chastity , which my foolish incredulity and feare, rashly attempted, both to ecclips and disparage: In which regard, praying her to forgiue, and thy selfe to forget that wrong; I earnestly desire her speedie returne by this bearer, and yee both shall see, that I neuer formerly hated her so much, as henceforth I will both loue and honour her: I haue now sent her some small tokens of my affection; and ere long she shall find greater effects and testimonies thereof; for knowing her to be as chast as fayre; In this De Bremay I request thee to rest confident, that as she is now thy daughter by Nature , so she shall be hencefoorth mine by adoption. La Vasselay.  De Bremay hauing receiued this letter, and his daughter Gratiana these kind tokens from her Mistris La Vasselay : his choller, and her griefe and sorrow is soone defaced and blowen away: so he well satisfied, and she contented and pleased, he sends her back from Nogent to Mans by La Villette , by whom hee writes this ensuing letter to his Mistris La Vasselay in answere of hers.  vndeserued cruelty to my daughter Gratiana did griefe, and indignation. And had she beene guilty of that crime, whereof thy feare made thee iealous, I would for euer haue renounced her for my daughter, and depriued her of my sight: for as her Vertues are her best wealth, and her Honour her chiefest reuenew: so if shee had fayled in these, or faltered in this, I should then haue ioyned with thee to hate her, as I doe now to loue her: But her Teares and Oathes haue cleered her innocency, and in hers, thy husbands. In which regard, relying vpon her owne merits, and thy professed kindnesse; she forgetting, and I forgiuing things past, I now returne her thee by thy seruant La Villette ; hoping that if thou wilt not affect her as thy adopted Daughter , yet that thou wilt tender her as thy obedient and obseruant handmaid. De Bremay.  Gratiana's hopes, and her fathers credulity of La Vasselay's future affection towards her, as also her gifts and promises, so far preuayle with them, as she is now returned to her, from Nogent to Mans ; But I feare she had done farre better to haue still remained with her father; for she might consider, and he know, what little safety, and apparant danger, there is to relie vpon the fauour of an incensed ielousie: La Vasselay (in all outward shew) receiues and welcomes Gratiana with many expressions of loue, and demonstrations of ioy, thereby to please her husband; who indeed likes so well of her returne, as he likes his wife the better for procuring it. And now to the eye of the world, and according to humane conceit and sense, all three parties are reconciled and satisfied, as if La Vasselay's ielousie had neuer heretofore offended her husband, nor her cruelty wronged Gratiana: or as if he had neuer knowne the one, nor she felt the other. But we shall not goe farre to see this calme oretaken with a tempest, and this Sunne-shine surprised with a dismall and disasterous showre. For three moneths were not fully expired, since Gratiana's returne to Mans , but La Vasselay's old iealousie of her, and her husband De Merson , which seemed to bee suppressed and extinguished, doth now flash and flame foorth anew with more violence and impetuositie; yea, hee cannot looke on Gratiana , much lesse speake to her, but presently this old iealous Beldame in her heart and thoughts, proclaimes them guiltie of Adultery: whereat shee indiscreetly suffers her selfe to be so farre transported with Indignation and Euny , as she vowes she will no longer tolerate or digest it. And now it is, that like a fury of hell she first assumes damnable and execrable resolutions, not onely against the Innocency, but against the life of innocent and harmlesse Gratiana ; who poore soule is the nearer her danger, in respect she holds her selfe farthest from it: yea, this iealous old Hagg, this Fury, nay, this she-Deuill La Vasselay , hath not only consulted, but determined and concluded with her bloody thoughts, that she will speedily send Gratiana into another world; because her youth shall no longer abuse and wrong her age in this. When forgetting her selfe, her soule, and her God, thereby purposely to please her senses, her Ielousie, and her Tutor the Deuill, she vowes, that no respect of reason or Religion, no consideration of Heauen or Hell, shall be capable to diuert her from dispatching her: yea, and as if she not onely reioyced, but gloried in this her pernitious and bloody designe, she thinkes euery houre a yeare before shee hath perform'd it: To which end, prouiding her selfe of strong poyson, and watching, and catching at the very first opportunitie, as soone as euer Gratiana found her selfe not well, she vnder a colour of much affection and care to her, makes her some White broath, wherein infusing and intermixing the aforesaid poyson, she (gracelessely and cruelly) giues it her, the which within sixe dayes fainting and languishing, makes a perpetuall diuorce and separation betwixt her soule and her body, leauing this to descend to earth, and that to ascend to heauen, to draw downe vengeance on this hellish and execrable La Vasselay , for so inhumanly and cruelly murthering this her harmelesse and innocent wayting Gentlewoman Gratiana . De Merson vnderstanding of Gratiana's death, almost as soone as of her sicknesse, he very sorrowfully bites the lip therat: for considering this accident in its true nature, his thoughts suggest him,  & his heart and soule prompts him, that his wife La Vasselay had vndoubtedly occasioned her death, & so metamorphosed her ielousie into murther; yea, & notwithstanding the faire and sorrowfull shew which she puts thereon to the contrary, yet the premises considered, he is very confident in this his beliefe and feare: when grieuing at the crueltie of this disaster, and abhorring the authour of so monstrous and bloody a fact; the very sight of this his old wretched wife is odious, and the remembrance of this her cruell crime, detestable and execrable vnto him. Againe, when he considereth Gratiana's beautie and chastitie, and that she was sent to her vntimely graue for his sake, this doth not onely redouble his sorrowes, but infinitely augment and increase his afflictions: so that beginning to feare his wiues enuy, as much as he hated her iealousie, in that it was not onely possible, but likely, that it might also futurely extend, and reflect on him, as well as it already had on harmelesse and innocent Gratiana , hee assumes a resolution to leaue and forsake her, the which wee shall shortly see him put in execution; when the better to curbe and vexe her, he secretly packes vp all her Bills, Bonds, Leases, and Conueyances, as also all her Money, Plate, Iewels, and richest Housholdstuffe; and so giuing out a prohibition to all the Tennants, not to dare to pay her any rent, he allowing her only a bare maintenance, very suddenly (when shee least expected or dreamt thereof) takes horse, and rides home to his fathers, where hee resolues to make the greatest part of his residence; and all the teares and prayers of his wife, are not of power to reclaime or retaine him. La Vasselay seeing the vnkindnesse of her Husband De Merson , in making her a widdow, almost as soone as a wife; as also his ingratitude, in depriuing her of the vse and fruition of her owne estate  & meanes, and leauing her so poore an allowance, as could scarse warrant her a competent maintenance, shee is almost ready to die for meere griefe and sorrow thereof, but how to remedy it, she knowes not: And now she rerepents her folly and indiscretion, in matching her aged selfe to so young a man as De Merson: now she doth not onely accuse, but condemne her owne iealousie, which drew her to this foule fact of murthering her harmelesse, and as she now beleeues, her innocent Wayting-maid Gratiana ; for the which, this ingratefull departure, and hard vsage of her husband, is but the least, and as she tearmes it, but the fore- runner of greater punishments, which God hath ordained and reserued for her: yea, it is not onely a griefe to her thoughts, but a vexation to her heart and soule, to see her selfe made the mocking stocke and laughter of all Mans , and Maine , who rather excuse her husbands youth, then any way pitie or commiserate her age; and to see that the friends of her prosperitie turne their backs and faces to her, in her affliction and pouertie: and if shee haue any hope yet left, to assist and comfort her in these her calamities, it is by endeauoring to reconcile and reclaime her husband to her by Letters: when taking pen and paper, shee within a moneth of his departure, sends him these few lines:  repented my crueltie to my mayd Gratiana , what haue I commited or done, that should deserue this thy ingratefull, and as I may truely say, Heart-killing departure? for hauing made a most exact Scruteny in my thoughts and soule; either of them informe me, and both assure mee, that the freenesse and feruency of my affection towards thee, deserued not so cruell, but a farre more courteous requitall. If my Age bee any way displeasing to thy youth, yet depriue me not of the felicitie of thy sight and presence, wherein I not onely delight, but glory. And although I can bee content that thou surfet with my wealth, yet make mee not so miserable, as to starue both in and for thy presence. If any haue giuen thee any sinister or false impressions, either of my selfe or actions; why if thy affection to mee will not deface them, at least let thy pitie: Yea, returne my sweet and deare Husband , and what errors or faults soeuer thou sayest I haue committed, I will not onely redeeme them with kisses, but with teares. La Vasselay.  De Merson hauing receiued this his wiues Letter, it works such poore effects in his affection, as he doth rather reioyce then commisserate her estate and sorrowes; yea, he so slights her and her remembrance, as once hee had thought to haue answered her letter with silence; but at last he (some eight dayes after) returnes her this answer:  constant to thy Ielousie ; and if the Scrutiny of thy thoughts and soule bee as true as thou pretendest, yet I feare that this Ielousie of thine, is not the greatest, but the least of thy crimes. Thou writest me, that I giue a cruell requitall to thy affection, but pray God , thou haue not giuen a more sharpe and inhumane one to Gratiana's seruice and Chastitie : Neither is it thy Age , but thy Imperfections and Vices , which are both displeasing and odious to my youth: for I could brook that with as much patience, as I can digest these with impossibilities. If thou want meanes, I will grant thee more; but for my presence, I haue many reasons to deny thee. I know none but thy selfe, which hath giuen me any impressions of thy actions; and if those were false, they would proue thy true happines, as now they doe thy misery, which my affection doth pitie, though cannot redresse. It is but in vaine for thee, either to expect or hope for my returne; and sith thy faults and errors are best knowen to thy selfe, let thy repentance redeeme them towards God : for neither thy kisses nor teares, can or shall to me. De Merson.  This Letter of De Merson to his wife La Vasselay , is so farre from comforting, as it doth most extreamely afflict her: And although his discontents be such, as she sees it almost impossible to reconcile and reclaime him: yet being exceedingly perplexed, and grieued with this her solitary and discontented life, shee yet hopes that a second Letter may obtaine that of him, which her first could not: when sixe moneths time being now slipt away since his departure, shee faigning her selfe sicke, writes vnto him againe to this effect:  Sicknesse threatens my life to bee neere her period: So among a world of discontents, let mee yet beare this one Content to my graue, that I may once more see thee, whom so tenderly I both desire, and long to see: and if I cannot bee so happie as to liue, at the least make mee so fortunate, as to dye in thine Armes: which I knowe not whether it be a greater Charitie for thee to graunt, or a Crueltie to denie mee this request of mine: For my Deare De Merson , if thou wilt not bee pleased to bee my Husband, yet bee not offended to remember that I am thy Wife; and withall, that as I desire thy returne, so that I haue not deserued thy departure: But if thou wilt still bee inexorable to my requests, these Lines of mine, which I write thee rather with Teares then Inke, shall beare witnesse betwixt thy selfe and mee, of my Kindnesse, of thy Crueltie, and how my Life sought thy Affection, though my Death could neither finde, nor obtaine it. La Vasselay.  De Merson reades this Letter with laughter; yea, hee is so insensible of her Lines, Requests, and Teares, as if another had sent him newes of her Death, as shee her selfe did of her Sicknesse, it had beene farre more pleasing, and better welcome to him. But thinking how to gall her to the quicke, to the end hee might hencefoorth saue her the labour to write him any more Letters, and himselfe to receiue and peruse them, hee returnes her this sharpe and bitter answer:  Sorrowes; and if thy life draw neere her period, they cannot bee farre from theirs. My sight is a poore content for thee to beare to thy graue, sith as a Christian , thou shouldest delight to see none but thy Sauiour , nor bee Ambitious to liue in any armes but his: and if thou hold not this to be Charitie, I know others cannot repute it Crueltie. That I am thy Husband I graunt, and that thou art my Wife , I not denie: But yet I feare thy heart knowes, though thy Pen affirme the contrary, that I haue farre more reason for my departure, then thou to desire my returne. And if thou wilt yet knowe more, if the Inke wherewith thou writest thy Letter bee Teares, pray God thou diddest not bedeawe Gratiana's Winding-sheete and Coffin, both with her Teares, and Blood: for haddest thou not beene cruell, yea, inhumane to her, I would neuer haue beene vnkinde to thee: And to conclude, liue as happy, as I feare her death will make thee dye miserable: De Merson.  The receit and perusall of this Letter, doth not only grieue but afflict and torment La Vasselay: for the very remembrance of De Merson his suspition and apprehension, that she had a hand in the death of Gratiana , doth as it were pierce her heart, as well with feare as sorrow: for as her pouertie lay before at his mercy, so now she knowes doth her life; and that fith he will not loue her, hee may chance so maligne and hate her, as to reueale it. Whereupon to secure her feare, and to warrant the safetie of her life, she soone exchangeth her loue into hatred, and her affection and ielousie, into enuy towards him; yea, her inraged and incensed thoughts, engenger and imprint such bloody designes of reuenge in her heart, as abandoning the feare and grace of God , she impiously concludes a match with the Deuill, to dispatch and murther him; and from which bloody and damnable designe, no regard of God , or her Soule , nor respect of Heauen or Hell , can or shall diuert her: when ouerpassing a small parcell of time, wherein she ruminated and pondered, how shee should send him from this life to another: at last her malicious curiositie makes her thoughts fall on La Villette , being his Gentleman, who still followed him, as holding him a fit Agent to attempt, and instrument to finish this bloody busines, which so much imported her content and safetie; grounding her reasons vpon the greatnes of his heart and mind, and the weaknesse of his purse  & meanes; as if pouertie were a sufficient cause and priuiledge to commit so treacherous and bloody a fact: When knowing him to bee then in Mans , receiuing vp his Masters Rents, she sends for him; to whom (the dore bolted) she tells him she is to request his secrecy in a businesse which infinitely tends to his good. He promiseth it her: but she will haue him sweare thereunto, which he doth: when with sighs and teares, making a bitter inuectiue, and recapitulation of her Husband, his masters vndeserued indignitie and crueltie towards her; she then and there makes a proposition to him, to murther him for her; and that she will giue him a thousand crownes to effect it. La Villette seeing the greatnesse of the danger, in that of the crime, seemes not onely discontented, but amazed hereat: for although he loue gold well, yet hee will not purchase it at so deare a rate, and base and damnable a price, as that of his masters blood: when seeing shee could not preuaile, she againe puts him in mind of his oath to secrecy; which he againe vowes neuer to infringe or violate: and withall, like a good Seruant , seekes to disswade and diuert her from such bloody thoughts and attempts. Had La Villette remained in the puritie and candeur of this his Religious and Christian Resolution, not to imbrue or distaine his hands in the innocent blood of his Master, it would haue made him as happy, as wee shall shortly see him miserable, in attempting and executing the contrary: for as a propension and resolution to Vertue , breedes not onely Honour , but safetie; so the contrary effects thereof, produce not onely shame, but misery. To foresee sinne, is a pious wisdome; but to preuent and eschew it, is alwayes a most wise and blessed pietie. And whereas Time should rather decrease then encrease; and rather root out, then plant Malice in our thoughts, and Enuy in our Resolutions; yet directly contrary, that of La Vassetay to her husband De Merson , doth not dye, but liue, will not fade but flourish: for a moneth or two more being runne out, and expired, and La Vilette againe in Mans , her malice to her husband is so inueterate and implacable, as she againe sends for him to her house, where (in great secresie and intended affection) shee tels him, that if he will murther his master, she within sixe moneths will marry him in requitall, and not onely liue his faithfull wife, but die his obedient and constant handmaid. Now although her first proffer of a thousand crowns could not procure of La Villette , these her sugred speeches, which she intermixeth with kisses, and the consideration of so many thousands, which her estate not onely promiseth, but assureth, doth; so as forgetting his former vertue, to remember his future vice, he (like a damnable villaine) sweares to her to effect it: which wretched Verball contract, they interchangeably seale with oathes and kisses, which (if they had had any feare of God, or care of their saluations) they should haue detested with horror, and abhorred with detestation: neither will his malice (or the Deuill the Author thereof) giue him leaue to protract or defer it: for hauing resolued to murther him as he rides abroad; his master on a time being inuited to a generall hunting, by the Baron of Saint Susanna (sonne and heire to Monsieur de Varennes ) at his said Towne of Susanna , as he came riding homewards towards his Fathers house of Manfrelle , he in the midst of a great wood, neere vnto the small village of Saint Georges , riding behind his master, dischargeth his Pistoll, loaden with a brace of bullets thorow his reynes, which makes him instantly fall off dead from his horse to the ground. When this hellish seruant La Villette , seeing his master deuoyd of breath, and groueling and weltring in his blood, he hauing acted the part of a sinnefull Deuill, in committing this cruell murther, now resolues to assume, and represent that of a subtill Hypocrite in concealing it: when determining to report that they were both assaulted, and his master slaine by theeues; he to make all his actions conduce and looke that way, chargeth his Pistoll againe with another brace of bullets, and shoots thorow his owne hat, giues himselfe a cut ore his left hand, and then breakes his Rapier, takes his owne Pistoll, and his Masters Rapier, and throwes it into a Pond close adioyning; takes likewise his masters purse and watch foorth his pocket, and hides it secretly: and then the more cunningly and knauishly to bleare and deceiue the eyes of the world, thereby to make this his Hypocrisie passe the currenter, he hauing purposely prouided himsele of two small cords; with the one he binds both his owne feet, and with the other (by a pritty sleight) slips therein his armes behind his backe, and then setting himselfe against a tree, he very pittifully weepes, groanes, and cries out vpon the theeues and murtherers of his Master De Merson when three Gentlemen of Brittaine, trauelling that way towards Paris , repaire to his assistance, whom they find out by his cries: to whom he relates that fiue theeues had assaulted his Master and himselfe, that hee fought in the defence as long as his sword held; that his master was kild with a Pistoll, then rob'd, and himselfe shot thorow, and wounded, and bound as they saw. When these three Brittish Gentlemen , grieuing at this mournefull accident, and bloody spectacle, they instantly cut the cords wherewith he was bound, and so hauing conueyed the dead corps to the next Cottage, they runne vp and downe the wood to find out these theeues and murtherers, but in vaine: so La Villette hauing thanked these Gentlemen for their affection and charity towards his dead master, and liuing selfe: He with a wonderfull exteriour shew of sorrow, takes care for the speedy and decent transporting home of his breathlesse Master to Manfrelle: where his mournfull Father receiues, and buries him with infinite griefe, lamentation, and teares. In the meane time, this murtherous La Villette giues priuate intelligence therof to the bloody La Vasselay , who although she inwardly receiue this newes with extreme content  & ioy, to see her selfe freed of so vnkind and ingratefull a husband; yet publiquely to the eye of the world (thereby the better to delude and deceiue the world, she contrariwise takes on blackes, seeming to be exceedingly mournefull, pensiue, and sorrowfull thereat: but God will shortly discouer the falshood of these her teares; and in the triumphs of his reuenge, pull off the maske of this her desembling and treacherous Hypocrisie: For as Mans, Lauall, Angiers , and all the adiacent Townes and Countrey, grieues at this lamentable murther of De Merson: so they as much admire and wonder to see his old widdow La Vasselay so shortly married  & espoused to his Gentleman La Villette , whose Nuptials are celebrated and consummated farre within the tearme of sixe moneths after. For the curious wits of these Citties  & countreys, considering what a preposterous course and resolution this was for her to mary her husbands man, and withall, so soone; as also that there was none other present but himselfe, when his Master De Merson was murthered, it is vmbragious; and leaues a spice of feare, and sting of suspition in their heads; that there was more in the wind then was yet knowne, and therfore knowing no more, they deferre the detection thereof, to the prouidence and pleasure of God , who best, yea, who onely knowes in Heauen , how to conduct and mannage the actions here below on Earth: and now indeed the very time is come, that the Lord will no longer permit these their cruell and bloody murthers to be concealed, but will bring them foorth to receiue condigne punishment: and for want of other euidence, and witnesses, they themselues shall be witnesses against themselues. And although La Vasselay's poysoning of Gratiana , and La Villette pistolling of his master De Merson , were cunningly contriued, and secretly perpretrated; yet wee shall see the last of these bloody murthers occasion the discouery and detection of the first, and both of them most seuerely and sharply punished for these their bloody crimes and horrible offences. The manner is thus . These two execrable wretches, La Villette , and La Vasselay haue not liued married aboue some seuen or eight monethes, but he being deepely in Lawe with Monsieur De Manfrelle , his Predecessors father, for the detention of some lands and writings, hee takes an occasion to ride home to his house of Manfrelle to him, to conferre of the differences, and by the way falls into the company of some Marchants of Lauall ,  & Vittry , who were returning from the Faire of Chartres: when ryding together for the space of almost a whole dayes iourney, the secret prouidence,  & sacred pleasure of God had so ordayned, that La Villettes horse who bore him quietly and safely before, on a Sunday, first goes back- wards in despight of his spur or swich, and then standing an end on his two hind legges, falles quite backe with him, and almost breakes the bulke and truncke of his body: when hauing hardly the power to speake, his breath fayling him, and he seeing no way but death for him, and the hideous image thereof apparantly before his eyes, the Spirit of God doth so operate with his sinnefull soule, as he there confesseth how his wicked wife La Vasselay had caused him to murther his master De Merson , whom he shot to death with his Pistoll; that she first seduced him with a thousand Crownes to performe it, which he refused; but then her consent to marry him, made him not onely attempt, but finish that bloody businesse, whereof now from his very heart and soule he repented himselfe, and beseeched the Lord to forgiue it him. But heere before the Readers curiositie carry him further, let me in the name and feare of God, both request and coniure him, to stand amazed, and wonder with me, at his sacred prouidence, and inscrutable wisedome and iudgement, which most miraculously concurres and shines in this accedent, and especially in three essentiall and most apparent circumstances thereof: For it was on the very same horse, the same day twelue month,  & in the very same wood, & place, where this execrable wretch La Villette formerly murthered his master De Merson: Famous, and notorious circumstances, which deserue to be obserued, and remarked of all the children of God, yea,  & to be imprinted and ingrauen in their hearts and memories, thereby to deter vs from the like crimes of murther. Now these honest Merchants of Lauall , and Vittry (as much in charity to La Villettes life, as in execration of that confessed murther of his Master De Merson ) conuey him to an Inne in Saint Georges , when expecting euery minute, that he would dye in their hands, they send away poast to aduertise the Presidiall Court of Mans heereof, (within whose Iurisdiction Saint Georges was) who speedily command La Villette to be brought thither to them aliue or dead: But God reserued him from that naturall, to a more infamous death, and made him liue till he came thither; where againe he confesseth this his foule murther of his master De Merson , and likewise accuseth La Vasselay to be the sole instigator thereof, as wee haue formerly heard and vnderstood. Whereupon hee is no sooner examined, but this bloody old Hagge is likewise imprisoned: who with many asseuerations and teares, denies, and retorts this foule crime from her selfe to him. But her Iudges are too wise to beleeue the weaknesse and inualiditie of this her foolish iustification: So whiles they are consulting on her, De Bremay hauing notice of all these accidents, but especially of La Vasselay's imprisonment; he (stil apprehending and fearing, that shee vndoubtedly was the death of his daughter Gratiana ) takes Poast from Nogent , to Mans , where he accuseth her thereof to the Cryminell Iudges of that Presidiall Court: who vpon these her double accusations, adiudge her to the Racke, when at the very first torment thereof, she at last (preferring the life of her soule, before that of her body) confesseth her selfe to be the Actor of her first crime of Murther , and the Authour of the second: when, and whereupon the Iudges (resembling themselues) in detestation, and for expiation of these her foule crimes, condemne him to be hangd, and shee to bee burnt aliue; which the next day, at the common place of execution (neere the Halles ) in Mans , is accordingly executed, in the presence, and to the content of a world of people of that citie, who as much abhorre the enormitie of these their bloody crimes, as they reioyce and glorifie God, for this their (not so seuere, as deserued) punishments. As for La Villette hee (like an impious Christian ) said little else, but that which he had formerly spoken and deliuered in the wood, at the receiuing of his fall; onely he said, That he had well hoped, that his great wealth which hee had with La Vasselay , would haue sheltred and preserued him from this infamous death for murthering her Husband, and his Master, De Merson . But as for this bloody Beldame, and wretched old Fury, La Vasselay , she was content to grieue at Gratiana's death, though not to lament or pitie that of her Husband De Mersons: yea, and although she seemed to blame her Ielousie towards her; yet her age was so wretchedly instructed in pietie, as she could not find in her heart, either to make an Apologie , or any way to seeme repentant for her inhumane crueltie towards him: For as she demanded pardon of De Bremay for poysoning his daughter; so she spake not a word tending that way, to Manfrelle , for causing his sonne to be pistoll'd; only in particular tearmes, she requested God to forgiue the vanitie of her youth; and in generall ones, the world to forget the offences and crimes of her age: And so coniuring all olde Widdowes and Wiues, to beware by her mournefull and execrable example; her flames and prayers made expiation for the offence of her body, and her soule mounted and fled to Heauen , to craue remission and pardon of God , who was the only Creator of the one, and Redeemer of the other. And such were the deplorable, yet deserued ends of this bloody and wretched couple, La Vasselay and La Villette , for so cruelly murthering harmelesse Gratiana , and innocent De Merson : And thus did Gods all-seeing, and sacred Iustice, iustly triumph ore these their crying and execrable crimes. O that their examples may engender and propagate our reformation; and that the reading of this their lamentable History may teach vs, not onely how to meditate thereon, but also how to amend thereby. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE Against the crying and execrable Sinne of Murther. History XIV.  Fidelia and C aelestina cause Carpi and Monteleone , with their two Laquayes, Lorenzo and Anselmo , to murther their Father Captaine Benevente , which they performe. Monteleone and his Laquay Anselmo are drowned, Fidelia hangs her selfe, Lorenzo is hanged for a robery, and on the gallowes confesseth the murthering of Benevente, Carpi hath his right hand, then his head cut off; Caelestina is beheaded and her body burnt.  purity and sanctity of our selues; how can wee neglect those, or not regard this, except we resolue to see our selues miserable in this life, and our soules wretched in that to come: and as charity is the cyment of our other vertues, so enuy (her opposite) is the subuersion of this our charity; from whence flowes rage, reuenge, and many times murther, (her frequent (and almost) her inseparable companions:) but of all degrees of malice and enuy, can there be any so inhumane and diabolicall, as for two gracelesse daughters to plot the death of their owne father; and to seduce and obtaine their two louers to act and performe it: whereof in this ensuing History, we shall see a most barbarous and bloody President, as also their condigne punishments afflicted on them for the same. In the reading whereof, O that we may haue the grace by the sight of these their fearefull crimes and punishments, to reforme and preuent our owne; that we may looke on their cruelty with charity, on their rage with reason, on their errors with compassion, on their desperation with pitty, and on their inhumanity with pietie; that the meditation and contemplation thereof, may terrifie our choller: quench both the fire of our lust, and the flames of our reuenge; so shall our faiths be fortified, our passions reformed, our affections purified,  & our actions eternally both blessed and sanctified: to which end, I haue written and diuulged it. So Christian Reader, if thou make this thy end in perusing it, thou wilt then not faile to receiue comfort thereby: and therefore faile not to giue God the Glory.

In the Cittie of Otranto , within the Prouince of Apulia , there dwelt an ancient rich and valiant Gentleman , (nobly descended) tearmed Captaine Benevente , who by his deceased Lady Sophia Elianora , (Niece to the Duke of Piombino ) had left him two daughters and a sonne, he tearmed Signior Richardo Alcasero , they two, the Ladies Fidelia and C aelestiana , names indeed, which they will no way deserue; but from whom they will solely dissent and derogate, through their hellish vices, and inhumane dispositions to blood and murther: we may grace our names, but our names cannot grace vs. Alcasero liues not at home with his father, but for the most part at Naples , as a chiefe Gentleman retayning to the Viceroy: where he profiteth so well in riding and tilting (a noble vertue and exercise, (beyond all other Italians ) naturall and hereditary to the Neopolitanes ,) that he purchased the name of a bold and braue Caualier, but for Fidelia and C aelestina , the clockes of their youth hauing stroke twentie, and eighteene, the Captaine their father, (thinking it dangerous to haue Ladies of their yeares and descent farre from him) keepes them at home, that his care may prouide them good husbands, and his eye preuent them from matching with others. It is as great a blessing in children to haue louing Parents, as for them to haue obedient children: and had their obedience answered his affection, and their duety his prouidence: we had not seene the Theatre of this their History so be sprinkled, and gored with such great effusion of blood. This Captaine Benevente their father, (for his blood, wealth and generosity) was beloued and honoured of all the Nobility of Apulia , and for his many seruices, both by sea and land, was held in so great esteeme in Otranto ; that his house was an Academie , where all the Gallants both of Citie and Countrey resorted to backe great Horses, to runne at the Ring, and to practise other such Courtly and Martiall Exercises, whereunto this old Captaine , as well in his age, as youth, was exceedingly addicted: so as the beauty of his two daughters, Fidelia ,  & C aelestina could not be long, either vnseene, or vnadmired: for they grew so perfectly fayre, of so sweet complexions and proper statures, that they were iustly reputed and held to bee the Paragons of Beautie , not onely of Apulia , but of Italy: so as beautie being the Gold and Diamonds of Nature ; this of theirs (so sweet in its influence, and so excellent and delicious in that sweetnesse) drew all mens eyes to loue them, many mens hearts to adore them: so had they beene as rich in Vertue, as in Beautie, they had liued more fortunate, and neither their friendes nor enemies should haue liued to haue seene them dye so miserably; for now that proues their ruine, which might haue been their glory. They are both of them sought in marriage, by many Barons and Caualiers , as well at home as abroad; but the Captaine their father will not giue eare, nor hearken to any, nor once permit that such motion be moued him: They are so immodest, as they grieue hereat, and are extreamely sorrowfull, to see that a few yeares past away, makes their Beauties rather fade then flourish: where Vertue graceth not Beautie , as well as Beautie, Vertue , it is often a presage and forerunner of a fortune as fatall, as miserable. But as their thoughts were too impatient and immodest, to giue way to such incontinent and irregular conceits; so on the other side, the Captaine their father, was too seuere, and withall too vnkind, I may say, cruell, to hinder them from Marriage , sith their beautie and age had long since made them both meritorious and capable of it: It was in them immodestie; in him, vnkindnesse, to propose such ends to their desires and resolutions: for as hee hath authoritie to exact obedience from them; so haue they likewise reason to expect fatherly affection, and care from him. But hee is more affected and addicted to his wealth and couetousnesse, then inclined to regard his daughters content; and therefore is fully resolued, not as yet to marry them, which is a resolution better left then imbraced, and infringed then kept of him; sith it may bring foorth effects contrary both to his hopes and desires. It is commonly dangerous for Parents , to content themselues with their childrens discontents: for where Nature is crossed, it many times degenerates, and prooues vnnaturall, as the Cataracts of Nylus make it submerge and wash Egypt with her inundation: But Fidelia , and C aelestina , will make triall of one inuention and conclusion more before they will giue way to their distaste, or strike saile to their choller and reuenge. They see their father is resolute, and seuere in nipping their hopes, and crossing their desires of mariage; and yet they hope, that although they cannot preuaile with him, that their brother Alcasero may: to which end, the sooner to obtaine and crowne their desires with content, they consult together, and so by a confident friend of theirs, send him this Letter to Naples:  refuge or recourse, but to thy selfe, and thy affection, in requesting thee powerfully to solicite him heerein, that hee may not preferre his golde before our content, and consequently his hopes before our despaire: neither could our hearts or thoughts perswade vs, either to imploy or acquaint any other but thy selfe with these our desires, which Modesty would haue suppressed, but that Truth contradicted and opposed it: for his seueritie and crueltie is such towards vs, that although wee are sought in marriage by diuers Caualiers our Superiours, yet hee will not permit vs to bee seene, much lesse to bee wedded of any. Ioyne then thy power to our wishes and prayers, and thy affection to the procuring of our contents; and we then doubt not, but to bee as happy in a Brother , as otherwise wee feare, wee shall see our selues vnfortunate, yea, miserable in a Father : and as thou canst not forget our discent and Blood; so we zealously pray and beseech thee, to remember, if not our Beautie, our Youth. Fidelia. C aelestina.  Their Brother receiues this their Letter: he is too braue, generous, and courteous, to be vnkind to any, especially to young Ladies, and most especially to his sisters, whose content he makes and reputes his owne. He comes to Otranto , deales effectually with the Captaine his father herein, who giues him this answere: That he hath prouided the Baron of Carpi for Fidelia , and the Knight Bartholomeo Monte-leone for C aelestina ; and that within fifteene dayes they are to come to Otranto to see them: which newes doth exceedingly reioyce first himself, then his sisters: but their ioy shall not last long, but be buried as soone as borne. Within the prefixed time these two Noble men come, but they are hatefull, and not pleasing to Fidelia , and C aelestina ; for the Barron of Carpi is crook-backt, and squint-eyed, and Monte-leone is lame of one leg. These Ladies valewe their beauty at too high a rate, to bestow it on such deformed husbands: and although Venus accepteth of Vulcan , yet they will haue none of these; because they deeme no hell to that of a discontented bed: heretofore they wished for Sutors, and now they wish they were well ridd of these; and so sacrificing to their owne contents, they set vp this resolution in their hearts  & soules, that they will rather dye maydens, then liue to see themselues wiues to such husbands. Their father receiues Carpi & Monteleone courteously, and entertaines them nobly, according to their ranke and merits: he tells his daughters plainely, that they shall marry these, and none others. Thus the Barke of these their resolutions, are surprisd and beaten with two contrary winds: he will bee obeyed of his daughters, and they will be commanded of their father in all things, but not in this of their Marriage. It is neuer good for parents, to force the affections of their children in their marriages, sith it is a busines which not onely liues, but dyes with them; but withall, their owne wills must neither bee their law, nor their guide: for their Parents haue, (or at least should haue) more experience and iudgement then they, to see who are, and who are not fit matches for them: But where authority opposeth affection, or affection, reason, there such marriages are still vshered on with discontent, and wayted and attended on with misery. Likewise, there is a great respect and consideration to be obserued by Parents, in the inclinations and natures of their children: for some will be perswaded, or reproued with a word, wheras others will become more headstrong and rebellious with menaces and threats. Had this Captaine attempted and practised the first, and not the second toward these two Ladies his daughters, peraduenture they had neuer leapt from reason to rage, from obedience to contempt, nor from hope to dispaire; yea, I dare presume to averre with truth and safety, that we should haue seene them all as happie, as I now feare we shall see them miserable. But to proceed with their History, they are pressed by the Captaine their father, and importuned by the two noble men their Sutors, to finish and confirme these contracts. But Fidelea and C aelestina with a true semblance of distaste, and yet a false shew of curtesie, giue the deniall to their father in particular tearmes, and to them in generall: He stormes at their disobedience, and they impute this excuse of theirs, to modestie, rather then vnkindnesse: They flatter themselues with this hope, that sith they are fayre, they must be courteous, and cannot be cruell; or if the contrary, that the Captaine their father will so manage his daughters affections, as all things shall sort to their desires and expectations; but they shall come too short of their hopes: for they are neither reserued for the Ladies, nor the Ladies for them: but whiles thus they are busie in aduancing the processe of their affections, Fidelia and C aelestina attempt a contrary enterprise: for they with teares and prayers, request their brother Alcasero , importunately to solicite their Father in their behalfe: that he will not enforce them to marry those whom they cannot affect, much lesse obey: which like a noble and deare brother hee performes with much zeale and perswasion: but hee cannot preuaile with him, nor bring them any other answere, then that they must and shall marry them, and onely them. Had this resolution of their father beene more curteous, and lesse rigorous towards his daughters, this History of theirs, had not deserued so much pitty and compassion, nor would haue drawen so many sighes from the hearers, or teares from the Readers: for now seeing their father cruelly resolued to offer violence to their affections, they begin to hate him, because he wil not better loue them. And here (O here) they enter into deuillish machinations, and hellish conspiracies against him: for as he plots their discontents, so doe they his destruction. Fidelia and C aelestina see their blood, and cause one, and therefore so they pretend shall be their fortunes: they would reueale their intents and designes each to other; but the fact is so foule and vnnaturall, as for a whiles they cannot, but they need no other Oratory then their owne sullen and discontented lookes, for either of them may read a whole Lecture of griefe and choller in each others eyes, till at length tyred with the importunity of their father, and the impaciency of Carpi , and Monteleone: Fidelea as the more audacious of the two, first breakes it to her sister C aelestina , in this manner. That she had rather die, then be compelled to marry one whom she cannot affect: that the Baron of Carpi is not for her, nor she for him; and that sith her father is resolute in this match, (although she be his daughter) shee had rather see him laid in his graue, then her selfe in Carpi's bedde. There needs not many reasons, to perswade that which we desire, For C aelestina tells her sister plainely, that she (in all points) ioynes and concurres in opinion with her, adding withall, that the sooner their father is dispatched, the better; because she knowes they shall neuer receiue any content on Earth , till he be in Heauen: and so they conclude he shall die. But alas , what hellish  & deuilish daughters are these, to seeke the death of their father, of whom they haue receiued their liues? who euer read of a Parracide more inhumanely cruell, or impiously bloody? so if euer murther went vnreuenged, this will not; for wee shall see the Authors and Actors thereof most seuerely punished for the same. Men and women may bee secret in their sinnes, but God will be iust in his decrees, and sacred in his iudgements: what a religious resolution had it beene in them, to haue retired, and not aduanced in this their damnable attempt; but they are too prophane, to haue so much pitty, and too outragious to hearken to this religious reason: yea, they are too impious to hearken to Grace , and too reuengefull and Bloody minded, to giue eare either to Reason, Duetie , or Religion . So now like two incensed and implacable furies, they consult how and in what manner they may free themselues of their father: Fidelia proposeth diuers degrees and seuerall sorts of murthers, but C aelestina likes none of them; in some she finds too much danger, in others too little assurance; and therefore as young as she is, she inuents a plot, as strange as subtil, and as malitious & diabolical as strange: she informes her, that to be rid of her father, there cannot be a securer course then to ingage the Baron of Carpi , and the Knight of Monteleone to murther him: Fidelia wonders hereat, saying, it will be impossible for them to be drawen to performe it, sith they both know and see, that the Captaine their father loues them so well, as will or nill, they must be their husbands. But C aelestina's reuengefull plot is further fetcht, and more cunningly spunne: for she hath not begun it, to leaue it raw and vnfinished; but is so confident in her deuillish industry, as she affirmes shee will perfect and make it good. Fidelia demaunds how. C aelestina answereth, That they both must make a feigned and flattering shew, to change their distaste, and now to affect Carpi , and Monte-leone , whom before they could not: that hauing in this manner drawen them to their lure, when they attempt to vrge Marriage, they shall both agree to informe them, that it is impossible for them to obtaine it, whiles the Captaine their father liues, sith albeit in outward appearance hee make a faire shew to make them their husbands, yet that he meanes and intends nothing lesse; for that he hath giuen them expresse charge and command (at any hand) not to loue or affect them; which is the maine and sole cause, that hath so long withheld them from making sooner demonstrations of their affections towards them: and this (quoth shee) will occasion and prouoke them to attempt it; adding, that by this meanes, they may giue two strokes with one stone, and so not onely be rid of our father, but likewise of Carpi and Monte-leone , who peraduenture may be apprehended, and executed for the fact; and for our safegard and security, we will powerfully coniure and sweare them to secrecie. There is no webb finer then that of the Spider, nor treachery subtiller then that of a woman, especially if shee contemne Charity for Reuenge, her Soule for her Body, God for Sathan , and consequently Heauen for Hell: how else could this young Lady lodge so reuengeful a heart in so sweet a body? or shroud such bloody conceits and inuentions vnder so faire and so beautifull a complexion? But the Panther , though his skinne be faire, yet his breath is infectious: and we many times see, that the foulest Snake lurkes vnder the greenest and beautifullest leaues. Fidelia giues an attentiue eare to this her sisters bloody Stratagem and designe: shee finds it sure, and the probabilities thereof apparant and easie, and therefore approues of it. So these two beautifull, yet bloody sisters vow, without delay, to set it on foot, and in practise. It is the nature of Reuenge , to looke forwards, seldome backwards: but did we measure the beginning by the end, as well as the end by the beginning, our affections would sauour of far more Religion, and of farre lesse impietie, and wee should then reioyce in that which wee must now repent, but cannot remedy. They take time at aduantage, and pertinently acquaint Carpi and Monte-leone with it. The passions of affection prooue often more powerfull then those of Reason, they suffer themselues to bee vanquished and ledd away by the pure beautie and sweet Oratory of these two discontented and treacherous Ladies, without considering what poyson lurkes vnder their speeches, and danger vnder their tongues: They commit a grosse and maine errour, in relying more on the daughters youth, then the fathers grauitie; on their verball, then his reall affection; and so they ingage themselues to the daughters, in a very short time to free them of the Captaine their father. It was a base vice in Gentlemen of their ranke, to violate the Lawes of Hospitalitie, in so high a degree, as to kill him, who loued them so dearely, and entertained them so courteously; and it is strange, that both their humours were so strangely vitious, as to concurre and sympathize in the attempt of this execrable murther: But what cannot vice performe, or Ladies procure of their Louers, at least if they loue Beautie better then Vertue, and Pleasure, then Pietie? Captaine Benevente is many times accustomed after dinner to ride to his Vineyard, and now and then to Alpiata , a neighbour village, where he is familiarly (if not too familiarly) acquainted with a Tennants wife of his, whom he loued in her youth, and cannot forsake in her middle age: perseuerance in vice neuer makes a good end: a single sinne is distastfull; but the redoubling thereof, is both hatefull and odious to God. Carpi and Monte- leone take their two Laquaies, Lorenzo and Anselmo with them, assoone as they know the Captaine to be abroad, onely accompanied with his confident Gentleman Fiamento ; and disguising themselues, they watch him at the corner of a wood, where of necessitie hee must passe. The euent answereth their bloody expectations and desires: they see Benevente and Fiamento approching, riding a soft trot; when like so many Fiends and Deuils, they all foure rush forth the thickets, and (without any other forme) with their Swords and Pistols, (after some resistance) kill them dead to the ground: but this is not the end of their hellish malice and enuy; neither is the vnsatiable thirst of their reuenge yet quenched: for they take these two murthered bodies (who are a fresh reeking and weltring in their blood) and carry them to a neighbour hill, and so throw them down into a deepe quarry full of thicke bushes and brambles, whereas they thought no mortall eye should euer haue seene them more,  & then and there they consult vpon their flight. Carpi resolues to take poast for Naples , and there for a time to shroud himselfe among the multitude of the Nobilitie and Coaches , which grace and adorne that Citie: And Monte-leone resolues to hye towards Brundusium , with intent, that if these murthers were reuealed, and himselfe detected and accused, he would there embarque himselfe either for Venice , or Malta: but he hath not as yet made his peace and reckoning with God. Leaue wee Carpi , and his Laquay poasting for Naples , and let vs see what accident will speedily befall Monte-leone . It is impossible for murther to goe long vnpunished; Monte-leone and his Laquay Anselmo shal ere they ride farre, see this position verified in themselues: He is prouided of two faire Gennets, one for himselfe, the other for his Laquay, and hauing taken his leaue of Carpi , away he goes for Brundusium ; but he hath not ridden past twelue miles, before his owne horse fell downe dead vnder him, which doth something afflict and amaze him; but this is but the least part of his misery, and but the very beginning of his misfortune; he is enforced to make a vertue of necessitie, so he rides his Laquayes horse, and he followes him on foot. It is impossible for a guiltie conscience to be secured from feare: he rides narrow lanes, and by-wayes, but at last neere the village Blanquettelle he meets with a swift Ford, which is passable for horse, but not for foot: Here Monte-leone is constrained to take vp his Laquay Anselmo behind him, which hee doth; but being in the midst thereof, the horse stumbles, and falls with both of them vnder him; which is done so suddenly, that Monte- leone had no time to cast off his Laquay, and so they are both drowned, and haue neither the Grace nor power to breath, or speake a word more. Gods iudgements are secret and inscrutable: had they had time to repent, they had onely lost their liues; whereas now it is rather to be feared, then wished, they likewise runne the hazard of their soules. But as it is a vertue to thinke and censure charitably of the dead; so it must needs be a vice to doe the contrary. Heretofore they thirsted for blood, and (loe) now they haue their fill of water. All Elements are the seruants of God , but these two of fire and water, are the most terrible, the most impetuous. We haue but one way to come into the world, but diuers to go out of it: This is a testimony of our weaknesse, and of Gods power. By this time Captaine Benevente , and his man Fiamento are found wanting, and no newes to be had them: his house rings,  & resounds with sorrow, all his seruants & friends mourn and lament for his absence, and his two accursed daughters, they seeme to be all in teares heereat: but wee shall shortly see this their hypocrisie and dissimulation both detected and reuenged. They lay all the Country to purchase newes of their father, and speedily by poast aduertise their brother Alcasero hereof at Naples , who amazed hereat, comes away with all possible speed and expedition: His two sisters and himselfe wonderfully mourne and lament for the absence of their father; and now seeing fiue dayes past, and no newes of him, they begin to suspect and feare, that he is made away and murthered; and because Fiamento was alone with him, they suspect him of the fact, which they are the sooner induced to beleeue, in regard hee is fled, and not to bee found: but they shall soone see the contrary; and that as hee was a faithfull seruant to their father his master, during his life, so hee was a true companion to him in his death. And although Alcasero his sonne vse all possible zeale and industry to find out his father, yet sith Earth cannot, now Heauen will reueale the newes, and sight of him. For as some neigbouring Gentlemen (his kinsfolkes and friends) are hunting of a Stagge neere Alpiata , they pursue him on horsebacke some fiue or sixe houres; and at last being tyred, he runnes for refuge and shelter, thorow the bushes and bryers, into the same olde Quarry, where the dead bodies of Captaine Benevente , and his man Fiamento were throwen. The Gentlemen Hunters descend from their horses, and with their swordes drawen, enter purposely to kill the Stagge, which they performe; when casting aside their eyes, they see two dead mens bodies, one neere the other, whose leggs, hands, and faces the Crowes had pitifully mangled and defaced. They are amazed at this mournefull and vnlooked for spectacle; when approaching to discerne them, they by their clothes find, and know them to be Captain Benevente , and his Gentleman Fiamento . They are astonished  & amazed hereat; and so one of them rides backe poast to Otranto , to acquaint Alcasero his sonne hereof, who melting into teares, returnes with him neere to Alpiata , where to his vnspeakeable griefe, hee sees the dead bodyes both of his father and Fiamento , which before all the Hunters he caused to be searched, and finds that his father (with a Pistoll bullet) was shot thorow the head in two places, and runne thorow the body with a Rapier in three; and that Fiamento had fiue deepe wounds with a Rapier, and once shot thorowe the head. Alcasero , and the whole company grieue and lament at this sorrowfull newes; they know well that Fiamento did not set vpon the Captaine his father, and that neither of them had Pistolls: and though they might imagine it done by theeues, yet they were quickly cleared of that ielousie and suspition, because they finde rich Rings on his masters fingers, and store of gold in his pockets: So they referring the discouery of this bloody and damnable murther to Time , and to God , the Author and giuer of Time, Alcasero causeth the dead bodies, first of his father, then of Fiamento to be layd in a Coach, which he had purposely caused to be brought thither; and so accompanied with all the Gentlemen, returnes with it to Otranto , where all the whole Citie lament and bewayle his tragicall disaster: and because these dead corpes of theirs haue receiued wrong, in being so long aboue ground, Alcasero that night giues them their due burialls, interring Fiamento decently, and his father honourably, according as the necessity and strictnesse of the time would permit him. It is now Alcasero's curiositie and care, to seeke out the murtherers of his Father ; and for his sisters, they are so irreligious and wretched, as they think to mock God, and delude the world with their immoderate, yet counterfeit mourning; but it proceeds not from their hearts, much lesse from their soules. The morrow after their Fathers buriall, they are all three informed, that Monte-leone and his Laquay Anselmo , are drownd, as they past the Riuer Blanquettelle ; wherat he wonders, and his two sisters reioyce and tryumph, especially C aelestina , who now sees her selfe freed, not onely of the Captaine her father whom she hated, but also of the Knight Monte-leone her Sutor, whom shee could not loue: Shee is so impious and gracelesse, as she doth reioyce, but will neither repent nor pitie at these accidents; yea, she so sleightly and triuially passeth ouer the remembrance of her fathers vntimely and bloody death, as if murther were no sinne, or that God had ordained no punishment for it: Shee weares her mourning attire and weeds, more for shew then sorrow: for her father was no sooner layd in his graue, but she builds many Castles of pleasure in the aire of her extrauagant  & ambitious thoughts, vowing that ere long, shee will haue a Gallant of her owne choosing to her husband: but shee may come too short of her hopes, and perchance finde a halter for her necke, before a wedding Ring for her finger. As for her brother Alcasero , his thoughts are roauing and roaming another way: for he finds it strange, that the Barron of Carpi comes not to condole with him for his father, and to continue his sute and affection to his sister Fidelia , whereat hee both admires and wonders, and not onely takes it in ill part, but also begins to suspect, and to cast many doubts and iealousies thereon; and what the issue thereof will bee, or what effects it will produce, we shall shortly see. But a moneth or two being blowen away, Carpi hearing no suspition or talke of him, and thinking all things in a readinesse for him to bee assured, and contracted to his Lady and Mistris Fidelia , hee takes a newe Laquay, and apparrelling him in a contrary Liuery, sends him secretly to Otranto , with this Letter to her:  condole with thee for the death of thy Father, which what they are, none can better imagine then thy selfe: when thy sorrowes are ouerblowen, I will come to thee, in hope to bee as ioyfull in thy presence, as thy absence makes me miserable. I haue giuen thee so true and so reall a proofe of my affection, as thou shouldest offer mee palpable iniustice, and to thy selfe extreame iniury to doubt thereof. For what greater testimony canst thou futurely expect, then to beleeue I will euer prefer thy loue before mine owne life: if thy constancy answer mine, Heauen may, but Earth cannot crosse our desires. I pray signifie mee how thy brother stands affected to our affections; thy answeres shall haue many kisses, and I will euer both honour and blesse the hand that writ it. Carpi.  The Laquay comes to Otranto , and findes out Fidelia , to whom (with much care and secrecie) he deliuers his Masters Letter, and commends, and requesteth an answere. Fidelia receiues the one, and promiseth the other: but shee is perplexed and troubled in mind. Heere her thoughts make a stand, and consult whether shee shall open this Letter, or no. Her Conscience hath heretofore yeelded to the death of her Father; and now Religion beginnes to work vpon the life of her Conscience, which indeed is that of her Soule. Had shee perseuered in this course of pietie, her repentance might haue pleaded for her disobedience, and her contrition redeemed her crime; but shee forsakes the Helme that might haue steered her to the Port of happinesse, and safetie; and so fills the sayles of her resolutions with the winde of despayre, which threaten no lesse then to split the Barke of her life on the rocks of her destruction and death. Shee now beginnes to hate company, which before she loued, and to loue solitarinesse, which before shee hated; yea, the liuing picture of her dead Father, doth so haunt her thoughts, and frequent her imaginations, that wheresoeuer shee is, it is present with her. Remorse, as a Vulture gnawes at her heart and conscience; yea, though nothing do feare her, yet she feares all things. Shee sees no man running behinde her, but she thinks he purposely followes her to drag her to prison: shee is afraid of her owne shaddow, and thinkes, that not onely euery tower, but euery house will fall vpon her: she will not come into any Boat, nor passe by any Riuer, Brook, or well, for feare of drowning. This dispaire of hers causeth her to be cold in her Religion, and frozen in her Prayers, which should bee both the preseruatiue, and Antidote of the soule: her speeches for the most part, are confused and distracted, and her looks sullen, fearfull, and gastly (the proper signes and symptomes of despaire.) Carpi's Laquay hauing stayed two dayes in Otranto for his answer, holds it his dutie to importune Fidelia to bee dispatched, the which that night she promiseth him; and now in a sad and melancholly humour she breaks off Carpi's Letter, and peruseth it; which not onely renewes, but reuiues the remembrance of her fathers death; whereat she enters into so strange and so implacable a passion, as shee once had thought to haue throwen his Letter into the fire, and her selfe after. Now shee is resolued to write backe to Carpi , and then presently shee changeth her resolution, and vowes shee will answere him with silence. But the Deuill is as subtill as malicious; and so shee calles for Pen and Inke, and out of the dregs of discontent, and the gall of despayre, writes and returnes him this answere:  addicted to mourning,  & not to mariage. I pray trouble not thy selfe to leaue Naples , to come to condole with mee in Otranto: for the best comfort that I can receiue, is that it is impossible for me to receiue any: I neuer doubted of thy affection, nor will giue thee any iust cause to suspect, much lesse to feare mine. If this will not suffice, rest assured I haue resolued, that either my graue, or thy selfe shall be my Husband. How my Brother stands affected to thee, is a thing difficult for mee to vnderstand or know, sith I am onely his Sister , not his Secretary ; but in all outward appearance, I thinke hee neither loues thee for my sake, nor my selfe for thine. Liue thou as happy, as I feare I shall dye miserable. Fidelia.  What a fearefull Letter is this, either for Fidelia to send, or Carpi to receiue: but her distempered and distracted spirits can affoord no other; and therefore she dispatcheth away the Laquay with this. And now (as if her thoughts transported her to hell) shee cannot be alone, for the Deuill is still with her: hee appeares to her in the shape of an Angell of Light, and proffers her mountaines of Wealth , and worldes of Honour , if shee will fall downe and adore him. To rebell against God is a sinne; but to perseuere in our rebellion, is not onely a contempt, but a treason in the highest degree against God. The best of Gods people are commonly tempted; but those are and prooue the worst, who are ouercome with temptation. Fortitude is a principall and soueraigne vertue in Christians ; and if we vanquish the Deuill, it is good for vs that he assaulted vs, sith those Victories (as well spirituall as temporall) are euer most glorious and honourable, which are atchieued with greatest danger. Had Fidelia followed the current of this counsell, and the streame of this aduise, shee had neuer been so weake with God , nor so vnfaithfull to her selfe, as to destroy her selfe: but forsaking God , and contemning prayer, which is the true way to the truest felicitie, what can shee hope for but dispaire, or expect but destruction? Her brother Alcasero , and many of her kinsfolkes, neighbours, and friends (with their best zeale, and possible power) endeauour to perswade and comfort her; they exhort her to reade religious Bookes, and continually to pray: Shee hearkeneth to both these counsells, but neither can, or will not follow either: Her sleepes are but broken slumbers, and her slumbers but distracted dreames; and euer and anon it seemes (to the eyes of her mind and body) that the Captaine her father, doth both speake to her, and follow her. In a word, she is weary both of this world, and of her life; yea, dispaire, or rather the Deuill hath reduced her to this extreame misery, and miserable extremitie, that she is ready to kisse that hand that would kill her, or that Death which would giue her death. Shee neuer sees a knife in the hands of another, but shee wisheth it in her owne heart: her Conscience doth so terribly accuse her, and her thoughts giue in such bloody euidence against her Conscience and selfe, for occasioning her fathers murther, that she resolues she must dye, and therefore disdaines to liue. And now comes her sister C aelestina to her, to perswade and conferre with her; but shee will prooue but a miserable Comforter. Fidelia sees her with hatred and detestation; and when shee beginns to speake, very peremptorily and mournfully cuts of her speeches thus: Ah sister, I would wee had slept when we plotted our fathers death; for in seeking his ruine, wee shall assuredly finde out our owne: Prouide you for your safetie, for I am past hope of mine; and so get you out of my sight . I know not whether the beginning of this her speech sauoured more of Heauen , then the end thereof doth of Hell: for sure if wee passe hope, wee come too short of saluation; and if wee forsake that, this infallibly will forsake vs. This poore, or rather this miserable Gentlewoman , hauing alwayes her murthered Father before her eyes (which incessantly haunts her as a ghost, and yet she is inforced to follow it as her shaddow) is powerfully allured and prouoked by the instigation of the Deuill , in what manner, or at what rate soeuer to dispatch her selfe, being so wretchedly instructed in faith and pietie, as shee addes and beleeues, that the end of her life will prooue not onely the end of her afflictions, but the beginning of her ioyes. But, O poore Fidelia , with a thousand pities and teares, I both pitie and grieue, to see thee beleeue so infernall an Aduocate: for what ioyes either will hee, or can he giue thee? Why, nothing but bondage, for libertie; torments, for pleasures; and tortures for delights: or if thou wilt haue me shew thee, whereat his flattering oratory, or sugred insinuation tendeth, it is onely to haue thee destroy thy body in earth, that (as a triumph and Trophee to the inlargement of his obscure kingdome) hee may drag thy body and soule to hell fire. But Fidelia is as constant in her sinne, as impious in her resolution; and so (all delayes set apart) shee seekes the meanes to destroy her selfe: shee procures poyson, and takes it; but the effect  & operation thereof answers not her desires. I know not whether she be more impatient to liue, then willing to die. We neuer want inuention, sildome meanes to doe euill: A little penknife of hers, shall in her conceit performe that which poyson could not: she seekes it, and now remembers it is with her paire of kniues in the pocket of her best gowne: she flies to her Wardrope, and so to her pocket, but finds not her kniues, onely she finds her Naples silke girdle in stead thereof. The Deuills instruments are neuer farre to seeke; shee thinkes it as good to strangle her throat, as to cut it: And heere comes her mournfull and deplorable Tragedy , she returnes swiftly to her chamber, bolts the doore, and so (which I grieue and tremble to relate) fastens it to the teaster of her bed, and there hangs her selfe; and as it is faithfully reported; at that very instant, and for the space of an houre, it thundred and lightned so cruelly, as if Heauen and Earth were drawing to an end, that not onely the chamber where shee hung, but the whole house shaked thereat. The thunder being past, and the skies cleared, dinner is serued on the Table, and Alcasero , and C aelestina ready to sit, they call for their sister Fidelia , but shee is not to bee found. One goes to her chamber, and returnes, that her key is without side, and the doore bolted within, and yet she answers not. They both flie from the table to her chamber, and call and knocke, but no answere. Alcasero commaunds his men to breake open the doore, which they doe, and there sees his sister Fidelea hanging to the bed stead starke dead. They crie out as affrighted and amazed at this mournefull and pittifull spectacle, and with all speed take her downe. But she is breathlesse, though not cold; and they see all her face and body, which was wont to bee as white as snow, now to be coale blacke, and to stinke infinitely. These are the wofull effects, and lamentable fruites both of Despayre and Murther ; O, may Christians of all rankes, and of both sexes, take heed by Fidelia's mournefull and miserable example, and withall remember that murther will still be reuenged and punished, especially that which is perpetrated by Children towards their Parents ; a sin odious both to God and man, sith it not onely opposeth Nature, but Grace; Earth, but Heauen. No sooner (with griefe, and mourning) hath Alcasero buried this his natural, yet vnnaturall sister Fidelia , but as his other sister C aelestina weeps for her death, so she againe reioyceth that her sister hath no way reuealed the great businesse, which so much concernes her, I meane the murther of the Captaine her father. But Time will detect and reuenge both it and her. And that wee may not seeme extrauagant in the narration and vnfolding of this Historie , flie wee from Otranto to Naples , and leaue wee the fatall and wofull Tragedy of Fidelia , to speake a little of the Baron of Carpi her Louer, who hath yet a great part to act vpon the Theatre of this History . He hath no sooner receiued Fidelia's Letter by his Laquay, but he much wonders and grieues at the contents thereof: hee sees her cold in her affection towards him,  & hote in despaire to her selfe; and thinks, that as it is in her power to reioyce him with her affection, so it may be in his to comfort her with his presence: but her request and his Conscience informe him, that it is yet too soone to leaue Naples , to see Otranto ; and yet that he may not faile in the complement and dutie of a Louer, hee resolues to visit her by Letter, though not in person, and so writes her these few Lines:  comfort my selfe to see her: But sith I must bee so vnfortunate, as in one Letter to receiue two different sorrowes, my refusall, and thy despaire: what remedy (or Antidote ) can I more aptly administer, then Patience to the first, and Prayer to the second. If thou weigh matters aright, I haue more occasion of sorrowe then thy selfe, and yet I am so farre from despayring, as I hope Time will giue thee consolation, and mee Content . Endeauour to loue thy selfe, and not to hate mee: so shalt thou drawe felicitie out of affliction, and I securitie out of danger. I hope thy Brother will not follow thy fathers steppes, his affection to thee shall bee mine to himselfe: Let thy second Letter giue mee but halfe as much ioy, as thy first did griefe, and I shall then tryumph at my good fortune, as much as I now lament and pitie thine, and in that mine owne. Carpi.  Hee sends this Letter of his to Otranto , by his Laquay Fiesco who carried his first, but he must go into another world, if hee meane to deliuer it to Fidelia: He comes to Otranto , and repayres to Captaine Benevente's house: whereas hee is walking in the second Court. Alcasero being very solitary and pensiue at a window, leaning his head on his hand, and deepely and seriously thinking what two fatall disasters were befallen his house, as the losse of his Father and sister, he by chance espies this Laquay Fiesco ; at whose sight his heart beats, and his blood very suddenly flasheth vp in his face: he exceedingly wonders hereat, and attributing euery extraordinary motion in himselfe a step or degree to the discouery of his fathers murther, whereon his thoughts were alwayes fixed, and could neuer be withdrawen: he sends a Gentleman of his named Plantinus , to enquire whose Laquay it was, and what was his businesse. Plantinus descends, and examineth him; but hee is close, and will reueale nothing. He entreats him to enter, and taste the Wine, the which hee doth; when ingaging, and leauing him in the Celler, he trips vp to his Master, and acquaints him with his answere, adding withall, that some fifteene dayes since, he saw him heere before. Alcasero commands this Laquay to be brought before him; he examines him, but he will not discouer himselfe: he threatens him with the whip, and imprisonment, but he cannot preuaile. It is a vertue in a Seruant, to conceale his masters secrets. Alcasero is angry at his silence, and fidelitie, yet commends him: he bethinks himselfe of another course  & subtiltie, as well knowing, that faire words may obtaine that which threats cannot; he prayes him to dine with his seruants, and enioyneth Plantinus to bring him to him in the Garden after dinner, the which he doth: Alcasero takes him apart, and tells him, that some fifteen dayes past, he saw him here. Fiesco answereth him with silence. Alcasero finds much perturbation in his heart, and distraction in his lookes and speeches: hee thinkes this boy can reueale something which he ought to know, and therefore thinkes to surprise him with a siluer hooke; hee profers him twenty Duckets , and layes it downe before him, to discouer himselfe and his businesse. Golde is, but ought not bee a powerfull bayt to indiscretion and pouertie. It is a poynt of small wisdome in Noblemen , to commit secrets of importance to those who haue too much folly, and too little iudgment to conceale them. The sight of this gold doth not onely dasle Fiesco's eyes, but ecclipse his fidelity; so he holds it no sinne towards God, nor treachery towards his master, to reueale it; but takes it, and informes him, that he is the Baron of Carpi his Laquay, who sent him from Naples thither, with a letter from him to the Lady Fidelia his sister. Alcasero growes pale heereat, and is very curious and hastie to see the Letter. Fiesco deliuers it him, who steps aside, and reades it: whereon he plucks his hat downe his forehead, and so making three or foure paces, reads it ore againe. He is perplexed to know as much as he sees, and grieued, not to see and find as much as he desireth to know: hee now confirmes his former suspition of Carpi , and beleeues that hee is a chiefe Actor, or Agent in his fathers Tragedy . But hee knowes it wisdome to vse silence in the discouery of a crime of this nature; and therefore calles Fiesco to him, bids him stay that night, and to speake with him in the morning before he depart. Alcasero withdrawes himselfe from the Garden to his Closet, and there againe peruseth this Letter of Carpi's: he finds it full of suspition, and ambiguities, and perceiues it hath a relation to former Letters; yea, there is a mysterie in this Letter, the which hee must vnlocke and find out, ere he be satisfied: for although Carpi be squint-eyed, yet hee feares hee hath looked too right on his father. Hee flyes to Fidelia's Closet, Trunke, and Casket, and finds a former Letter of Carpi's to her, and the copie of one of hers to him; and the perusall of these two Letters are so far from diminishing his suspition, as it doth augment and encrease it: for now hee verily beleeues, that Carpi and his sister Fidelia , haue ioyntly had a great hand in his fathers murther. But all this while hee doth not once so much as suspect or imagine, that his other sister C aelestina hath played any part in this Tragedy : but Time is the daughter of Truth , as Truth is that of Heauen . In the morne, he calles for Fiesco , to whom he giues this farewell: Tell the Baron of Carpi thy Master, that my sister Fidelia is in another world, and not in this, and that shortly I resolue to see him at Naples, and that in the interim, I will reserue his Letter. Fiesco departs, but knowes, he hath so highly betrayed and wronged his Master, as he dares not see him, and so shewes him a faire paire of heeles. Such Laquayes farre better deserue a halter, then a Liuery. Carpi wonders at his Laquayes long stay: In which meane time Alcasero comes to Naples , where hee is yet irresolute, whether to accuse Carpi by the order and course of Law, or to fight with him: but hee resolues to doe both; and that if the Law will not right him for the murther of his father, his sword shall. He goes to the Criminell Iudges , and with much passion and sorrow, accuseth the Barron of Carpi for murthering of the Captaine Benevente his father; and for proofe hereof, produceth his two Letters to his sister Fidelia , and the copie of one of hers to him. Whereupon the Iudges graunt power to apprehend Carpi , so hee is taken and constituted prisoner: and now hee hath leasure to thinke of the basenesse and foulenesse of his fact. But he is so farre from deiecting himselfe to sorrow, or addicting himselfe to repentance, as he puts a brazen face on his lookes and speeches, and so peremptorily intends and resolues to deny all. Had he had more grace, or lesse impietie, he would haue made better vse of this his imprisonment, and haue shewen himselfe, at least humble, if not sorrowfull, for his offence and crime. But he holds it wisdome, in greatest dangers to shew most courage and resolution, and so makes himselfe fit to grapple and encounter with all accidents and occurrences whatsoeuer. Men may palliate their sinnes, but God will finde them out, and display them in their naked colours. Alcasero is an importunate solicitor to the Iudges to draw and hasten on Carpi his arraignment: But they (resembling themselues) proceed therin modestly and grauely: they consult, and consider the three Letters: they find coniecturall circumstances enow to accuse, but no sollid proofe to condemne him: they hold, that their opinions ought not to be swayed with the winde of euery presumption, and that it is not fit so triuially to set the life of a man at six and seauen. Besides, as they approoue of Alcasero his affection to his father, so they dislike of his impetuositie and vehemency towards Carpi . They all resolue to lay the Sword of Iustice , in the ballance of Equitie , and then ordaine that Carpi shall be rackt, to see whether they can draw more light from his tongue, then from his pen. But hee indures these his tortures and torments with wonderfull constancy, and still denyes all. Had his cause been more religious and humane, and not so bloody, this fortitude and courage of his, had been as praise-worthy, as now it is odious and execrable. The Court by sentence (pronounced in open Senate ) acquit and cleare Carpi of this murther: whereat Alcasero exceedingly repines and murmures. It is not enough that Carpi hath now escaped this danger; for Alcasero remaines still constant in his conceit, that he is the murtherer of his father, and therefore vowes and resolues to fight with him: Hee lets passe some sixe weekes time, till hee bee sound of his limbs, and then resolues to send him a challenge. Had Carpi been innocent, it had been more honorable and requisit, that he had challenged Alcasero , then Alcasero him: but his cause being vniust, and his Conscience fearefull, he dares not runne the hazard, to be desirous or ambitious to fight with Alcasero: the which if hee had attempted, Alcasero will anticipate and preuent him; who making Plantinus his Second, he out of the ashes of his sorrow, and the fire of his reuenge, sends him to Carpi with this Billet of Defiance:  Conscience cannot, and my Rapyer will not. I should bee a Monster of Nature , not to seeke reuenge for his death, of whom I haue receyued my life. Could I giue peace to my thoughts, or vnthinke thee the cause of my disaster, I would not seeke to bereaue thee of thy life, with the hazard of mine owne. But finding this not onely difficult, but impossible, pardon mee if I request thee to meet mee single, at eight of the clocke after Supper, at the West end of the Common Vineyard, where I will attend thee with a couple of Rapiers, the choyce whereof shall bee thine, and the refusall mine: or if thou wilt make vse of a Second, he shall not depart without meeting one to exchange a thrust or two with him. Alcasero.  Whiles the Barron of Carpi is triumphing to see how he hath bleared the eyes of his Iudges, and so freed himselfe from the feares and danger of death, behold, Plantinus findes him out, and deliuers him Alcasero his Challenge. He takes it, and with a variable countenance reades it, whereat he finds a reluctation and combate, not onely in his thoughts, but his Conscience, whether hee should accept, or refuse it. His Honour bids him doe the first; but his Conscience wills him to performe the second: it were better to bee borne a Clowne, then a Coward. Besides, if hee should refuse to fight with Alcasero , he vpon the matter makes himselfe guiltie of the Captaine his fathers death. Hee knowes he hath an vniust cause in hand, but he preferres his Honour before his Life , when setting a good face vpon his resolution, hee addresseth himselfe to Plantinus thus: Sir, I presume you know this businesse: for I take you to be Alcasero's Second. Hee hath (replyed Plantinus ) done me the honour to make choyce of me, in stead of a more worthy. Well (quoth the Barron of Carpi ) tell thy master from me, That although I haue not deserued his malice, yet that I accept his Challenge, and will performe it, onely I must fight single, because I am at present vnprouided of a Second. Plantinus (as full of Valour as Fidelitie) prayes him, that hee may not see his hopes and desires frustrated, but that hee may inioy part of the feast. But Carpi giues him this answere, which hee bids him take for his last resolution: That he will hazard himselfe, but not his friend. So Plantinus returnes with ioy to his Master, and discontent to himselfe: when nothing proouing of power, to quench the fire of these two Gentlemens courage and reuenge, they meete at the time and place appoynted. Carpi fights with passion and vehemency; Alcasero with iudgement and discretion. Carpi lookes red and fiery with choller; and Alcasero , pale and gastly, not for feare of his cause, but for the remembrance of his sorrowes: and to conclude and shut vp this combate in the issue thereof, Iustice is not now pleased to shewe the effects of her power and influence; nor God that of his Iustice, onely it is reserued for another time,  & for a more shamefull manner: so Carpi hath the best of the day, for hee is onely hurt in his right hand, and scarred ouer both his lippes, as if the prouidence and pleasure of God had ordained, that that hand which committed the murther, and that mouth which denyed it, should be purposely punished, and no part else. As for Alcasero , he had fiue seuerall wounds, whereof one being thorow the body, made Carpi beleeue it was mortall, and the rather, for that hee fell therewith speechlesse to the ground: so leauing him groueling  & weltring in his blood, he departs, resting very confident, that hee was at his very last gaspe of life, and poynt of death. But Carpi his Chirurgeon (being more humane and charitable then his master) leapes ouer the next hedge, and comes to his assistance: He leanes him against a banke, bindes vp his wounds, and wraps him in his cloake, and so runnes to a Litter, which he saw neere him, and prayes the Lady that was in it, that she would vouchsafe to take in Don Alcasero , who was there extremely and dangerously wounded: and this did Carpi his Chirurgeon performe, in the absence of Alcasero's owne Chirurgeon , who out of some distaste or forgetfulnesse, came not at the houre and place assigned according to his promise. It was the Lady Marguerita Esperia , who out of her noble and charitable zeale to wounded Alcasero , presently descended her Litter, commanding her seruants to lay him in softly, and to conuey him to his lodging, and shee her selfe is pleased to stay in the fields till her seruants returne it her. It was a courtesie , and a charitie worthy of so Honourable a Lady as her selfe: and in regard whereof, I hold it fit, to giue her remembrance and name a place in this History. All Naples , yea the whole Kingdome rings of this Combate; the Barron of Carpi and Alcasero are (ioyntly) highly commended and extolled for the same; the last for his affection and zeale to his dead father; the first, for giuing Alcasero his life, when it was in his power and pleasure to haue taken it from him. But God will not permit Alcasero to dye of these wounds, but will rather haue him liue to see Carpi die before him, though in a farre more ignoble and shamefull manner. As soone as Alcasero's wounds are cured, and hee prettie well recouered, he leaues Naples , and returnes to Otranto , where his sister C aelestina did as much shake and tremble, at the imprisonment of the Baron of Carpi , as shee now reioyces at his libertie; especially, sith shee is assured, that he hath no way accused her, nor vsed her name for the death and murther of her father, which indeed makes her farre more pleasant and merry then before, and within sixe moneths after marries with Seignior Alonso Loudouici , whom shee euer from her youth had loued and affected, and with whom shee liues in great pleasure, state, and pompe; and no lesse doth her brother Alcasero , who for the courtesie which Dona Margarita Esperia shewed him, when hee was so dangerously wounded, in requitall thereof doth now marry the faire Beatina , her onely daughter, with whom he liues in the highest content and felicitie, as any Gentleman of Italy , or of the whole world, can either desire or wish. But this Sunne-shine of Carpi's prosperitie, and C aelestina's happinesse and glory shall not last long: for there is a storme breaking foorth, which threatneth no lesse then the vtter ruine, as well of their fortunes as liues. Where men cannot, God will both detect and punish murthers; yea, by such secret meanes and instruments, as we least suspect or imagine. They are infallible Maximes , that wee are neuer lesse secured, then when wee thinke our selues secure; nor neerer danger, then when we esteeme our selues farthest from it. And if any bee so incredulous, or as I may say, so irreligious, as not to beleeue it, haue they but a little patience, and they shall instantly see it verified and made good in the Barron of Carpi , and the Lady C aelestina , who thinking themselues now safe and free from all aduerse fortunes, and fatall accidents whatsoeuer, and enioying all those contents and pleasures, which their hearts could either desire, or wish to enioy, or which the world could prostitute or present them, they in a moment shall bee bereaued of their delights and glory, and enforced to end their dayes on a base scaffold with much shame, infamy, and misery. The manner is thus: God many times beyond our hopes, and expectations, doth square out the rule of his Iustice according to that of his will: all men are to bee accountable to him for their actions, but he to none for his decrees and resolutions: it is in him to order, in vs to obey; yea, many times hee repriues vs, but yet with no intent to pardon vs. Curiosity in matters of Faith and Religion, prooues not onely folly, but impietie: for as we are men, we must looke vp to God , but as we are Christians , wee must not looke beyond him. Hee oftentimes makes great offenders accuse themselues for want of others to accuse them; and when he pleaseth, hee will punish one sinne by another, the which we shal now see verified in Lorenzo the Baron of Carpi his Laquay; that wretched and bloody Lorenzo , who as wee haue formerly heard, assisted this his master to murther Captaine Beneuente and Fiamento , neere Alpiata ; who euer since being countenanced and authorized by his Masters fauour, in respect of this his foule fact, wherein his bloody and murtherous hand was deeply and ioyntly embrewed with him, hee from that time becomes so debaush'd and dissolute in his Seruice, as he spends all that possible hee can procure or get; yea, and runnes likewise extreamely in debt, not onely with all his friends, but also with all those whom he knowes will trust him: so as his wants being extreamely vrgent, and enforced to see himselfe reduced to a miserable indigence and pouertie. Hee being one day sent by the Baron his Master to the Senate house, with a Letter to his Councellor, hee there in the throng and crowd of people, cut a purse from a Gentlewomans side, wherin was some fiue and twentie Ducketons in gold, was taken with the maner, and apprehended, and imprisoned for the fact, and the next morne his Processe was made, he found guiltie, and condemned to be hanged: So he is dealt withall by a couple of Fryers in prison, who prepare his soule for Heauen: He sees the foulenesse of his former life, and repents it. The Baron of Carpi his Master, no sooner vnderstands this newes, but hee shakes and trembles, fearing least this his Laquay should reueale the murther of the Captaine and his man: whereupon hee resolueth to flye; but considering againe, that if his Laquay accuse him not, his very flight will proclaime and make him guiltie: hee stayes, and as hee thinkes, resolues of a better course: Hee goes to the prison, and deales with his Laquay to be secret in the businesse he wots of; protesting and promising him, that in consideration thereof, hee will inrich his mother, and brothers. Lorenzo tels him, that he need not feare: for as he hath liued, so he will die his faithfull seruant: But wee shall see him haue more grace, then to keepe so gracelesse a promise. Carpi flattering himselfe with the fidelitie and affection of his Laquay, resolues to stay in the Citie: but he shall shortly repent his confidence. He was formerly betrayed by Fiesco , which mee thinkes should haue made him more cautious and wise, and not so simple to entrust and repose his life on the incertaine mercy of Lorenzo's tongue: but Gods reuenge drawes neere him, and consequently he neere his end; for hee neither can nor shall auoyd the iudgement of Heauen . Lorenzo on the gallowes, will not charge his soule with this foule  & execrable sin of murther: but Grace now operating with his soule, as much as formerly Sathan did with his heart, he confesseth, that he and the Barron of Carpi his Master, together with the Knight Monte-leone , and his Laquay Anselmo murthered the Captaine Benevente , and his man Fiamento , and threw them into the Quarry, the which hee takes to his death is true: and so vsing some Christian-like speeches of repentance and sorrow, he is hanged. Lorenzo is no sooner turned ouer, but the Criminall Iudges , aduertised of his speeches deliuered at his death, they command the Baron of Carpi his lodging to bee beleagred, where he is found in his Study, and so apprehended, & committed prisoner, where feare makes him looke pale; so as the Peacockes plumes both of his pride & courage strike saile. He is againe put to the Rack, and now the second time he reueales this foule and bloody murther, and in euery poynt acknowledgeth LorenZoes accusation of him to bee true: So he is condemned, first to haue his right hand cut off, and then his head, notwithstanding that many great friends of his sue to the Viceroy for his pardon. The night before hee was to dye the next morne, one of his Iudges was sent to him to prison, to perswade him to discouer all his complices in that murther, besides Monte-leone and his Laquay Anselmo ; yea, there are likewise some Diuines present, who with many religious exhortations perswade him to it: So Grace preuailes with Nature, and Righteousnes with Impiety and sinne in him; that he is now no longer himselfe, for contrition and repentance hath reformed him: he will rather disrespect C aelestina , then displease God: wherupon he affirmes, that she and her deceased sister Fidelia , drew him and Monte-leone to murther their father, and his man Fiamento ; and that if it had not bin for their allurements and requests, they had neuer attempted either the beginning or end of so bloody a businesse: and thus making himselfe ready for Heauen , and grieuing at nothing on Earth , but at the remembrance of his foule fact, hee in the sight of many thousand people, doth now lose his head. This Tragedy is no sooner acted and finished in Naples , but the Iudges of this Citie send away poast to those of Otranto , to seize on the Lady C aelestina (who in the absence of her husband for the most part liued there:) A Lady whom I could pity for her youth and beautie, did not the foulenesse of her fact so foulely disparage and blemish it. Shee is that instant at a Noblemans house, at the solemnity of his daughters marriage, where shee is apprehended, imprisoned, and accused to be the author  & plotter of the Captain her fathers death; neither can her teares or prayers exempt her from this affliction and misery. She was once of opinion to deny it, but vnderstanding that the Baron of Carpi and his Laquay LorenZo were already executed for the same in Naples , she with a world of teares freely confesseth it, and confirmes as much as Carpi affirmed: wherupon in expiation of this her inhumane Paracide , she is condemned to haue her head cut off, her body burnt, and her ashes throwen into the ayre: for a milder death, and a lesse punishment the Lord will not (out of his Iustice) inflict vpon her, for this her horrible crime, and barbarous cruelty committed on the person of her owne father, or at least seducing and occasioning it to bee committed on him; and it is not in her husbands possible power to exempt or free her hereof. Being sent backe that night to prison, she passeth it ouer (or in very truth the greatest part therof) in prayer, still grieuing for her sinnes,  & mourning for this her bloody offence and crime; and the next morne being brought to her execution, when shee ascended the scaffold, she was very humble, sorrowfull, and repentant, and with many showers of teares requested her brother Alcasero and all her kinsfolkes to forgiue her, for occasioning and consenting to her fathers death, and generally all the world to pray for her; when her sighs and teares so sorrowfully interrupted, and silenced her tongue, as she recommending her soule into the hands of her Redeemer , whom shee had so heynously offended, shee with great humilitie and contrition, kneeling on her knees, and lifting vp her eyes and hands towards heauen, the Executioner with his sword, made a double diuorce betwixt her head and her body, her body and her soule; and then the fire (as if incensed at so fiery a spirit) consumed her to ashes, and her ashes were thrown into the ayre, to teach her, and all the world by her example, that so inhumane and bloody a daughter, deserued not either to tread on the face of this Earth, or to breathe this ayre of life. Shee was lamented of all who either knew or saw her, not that shee should die, but that shee should first deserue, then suffer so shamefull  & wretched a death: and yet shee was farre happier then her sister Fidelia , for shee despaired, and this confidently hoped for remission and saluation. Thus albeit this wretched and execrable yong Gentlewoman liued impiously, yet she dyed Christianly: wherfore let vs thinke on that with detestation, and on this with charity. And here we see how seuerely the murther of Captaine Benevente was by Gods iust reuenge punished, not onely in his two daughters, who plotted it, but also in the two Noblemen and their two Laquayes, who acted it. Such attempts and crimes deserue such ends and punshments, and infallibly find them. The only way therefore for Christians to auoid the one, and contemne the other, is with sanctified hearts, and vnpolluted hands still to pray vnto God for his Grace , continually to affect praier , and incessantly to practise pietie in our thoughts, and godlines in our resolutions and actions, the which if we be carefull and conscionable to performe, God will then shroud vs vnder the wings of his fauor, and so preserue and protect vs with his mercy and prouidence, as we shall haue no cause to feare either Hell , or Sathan . THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE Against the crying and execrable Sinne of Murther. History XV.  Maurice like a bloody villaine, and damnable sonne, throwes his Mother Christina into a Well, and drownes her: the same hand and arme of his wherewith he did it, rots away from his body; and being discrased of his wits in Prison, he there confesseth this foule and inhumane murther, for the which he is hanged.  and mercifull to vs, as he would make vs more happie; but when with high and presumptuous hands we violate the Lawes of Nature and Grace , of Earth and Heauen , in murthering through Enuie those, whom through Dutie and affection wee are bound to obey, honour, cherish and preserue: then it is no maruell, because we first forsooke God, that he after abandoneth vs to our selues, and sins, and to the fruits thereof, Calamity, Misery, Infamy and Perdition; and that we may see humane cruelty to be iustly met with and punished by Gods vpright and diuine Iustice, Loe heere in this insuing History we shall see a wretched sonne kill his harmelesse and deere mother. A very fearefull and lamentable Parracyde , a most cruell and execrable fact, for the which we shall see him rewarded with condeigne punishment, and with a sharpe and infamous death; although not halfe so deplorable as deserued. It is a bitter and bloody History , the relation and remembrance wherof in the most barbarous and flinty hearts is capeable, not only to ingender compassion, but compunction: yea, not onely contrition, but teares, at least if wee haue any place left in vs for Pitty , or roome for Pietie ; the which if we haue, doubtlesse the end of our reading will not onely blesse, but crowne the beginning, and the beginning the end thereof. the Lake of Geneua , (because it payes its full tribute, and make its chiefest Rendezvous before that City, whereof it inuironeth at least one third part.) There stands a prettie small and strong towne, distant a little dayes iourney from it, termed Morges , which properly belongs to the iurisdiction of Berne , one of the chiefest Cantons of that warlike people and Country of Swisserland , wherein of verie late yeares, and recent memory, there dwelt a rich and honest Burger or Burgemaster (for of Gentrie those parts and people are not, because they will not be capeable) named Martin Halsenorse , who by his wife Christina Snuytsaren , had one onely child, a sonne named Maurice Halsenorfe , now of some foureteene yeare old; whose father although he were by profession a souldier, and inrolled a Lieunant, to one of those Auxilary Bands of that Country which are in pay to the French King ; yet neuerthelesse his chiefest ambition and care was, to make this sonne of his a scholler, because the Ignorance and illiterature of his owne age, made him to repent it in himselfe, and therefore to prouide a remedy thereof in his sonnes youth, sith he now knew and sawe, that a man without learning, was either as a body without a soule, or a soule without knowledge and reason, which are her chiefest vertue, and most sacred Ornaments and Excellencies: So he brings him vp to their owne Grammar Schoole in Morges , where in some three or foure yeares his affection and care to studie, makes him so good a Proficient , as he becomes not onely skilfull, but perfect therein, and almost as capeable to teach his Schoole-master, as hee was to instruct him: yea, and to adde the better Grace , to the Grace of that Art , he was of so milde and so moddest a carriage, and the blossomes of his youth, were so sweetly watred with the Heauenly dew of Vertue and Piety , as if his manners and himselfe were wholy composed thereof; so that for Learning and Goodnesse , hee was, and was iustly reputed, not onely the Mirrour , but the Phoenix of all the youth of Morges ; and as hee esteemed himselfe happy in his Parents, so they reciprocally hold themselues, not onely happie, but blessed in this their sonne; but because the inherent coruption of our Nature, and the peruersnesse and multiplicity of our sinnes are such, as they cannot promise vs any true ioy, much lesse assured and permanent felicity: so the Sunne-shine of this their Temporary content, equally deuided in thirds betwixt the Father, Mother and Sonne, will shortly receiue a great ecclipse, and a fatall disaster, which will be to them by so much the more bitter, and mournefull, fith both the cause and effects thereof, were of each of them vnthought of, of them all vnexpected. For God in his sacred decree and prouidence, seeing Martin Halsenorfe the Father, his strength arriued to its full Meridian and hight, and his dayes to their full number and periode: Hee, as he sate at dinner iocund and merry with his wife and sonne, is sodainely taken with a deadly swoone, which presently depriues his body of this life, and sends his soule to enioy the sweet felicity and sacred ioy and immortality of the life to come: A Document which may teach vs not to rely vpon the rotten priuiledges and strength of youth, but so to prepare our liues, that death at all places, and in all times, may still finde vs armed and ready to encounter it. A Document which may teach vs with the erected eyes, as well of our faith, as body, so to looke from Earth to Heauen , that our soules be not onely ready, but willing to forsake this stinking Tabernacle and prison of our mortality, to flie and be admitted into Heauen , that Heauenly Ierusalem , and celestiall City, where they may enioy the blessed Communion of the Saints , and the greatest blessings of al ioyes,  & the most soueraigne ioy of all blessings, then to see our Creator and Sauiour, God the Father, and Christ Iesus his Sonne face to face, wherin indeed all the ioyes and blessings of our soules, are comprised and included: The death of Halsenorfe the father, is not only the Argument , but the cause of his widdow Christina's griefe, of his sonne Maurice's sorrow, of her teares and grones of his sighes  & afflictions; yea, and not to derogate from the Truth, I may steppe a degree farther and say, that this his death is a fatall herauld, and mournefull harbinger which portends and prepares both of them, many disasterous calamities, and wofull miseries, the which in a manner are almost ready to surprise and befall them. This sorrowfull widdow being thus depriued of her deere Husband, who was both her comfort and her ioy, her stay and her Protector, her Head and her glory; although he left her a good Estate, sufficient enough to warrant her against the feare of pouerty, and to secure himselfe against the apprehension of worldly Indigence; and wherewithall to maintaine both her selfe and her sonne, with somewhat more then an indifferent competency: yet shee saw her friends forsake her, and her Husbands familiar acquaintance abandone her, as if their friendship died with him, and that their remembrance of him was wholy raked vp, and buried in the dust of his graue. A most ingratefull disease and iniquity of our time, rather to be pittied then cured, and reprooued, then reformed, so fading and inconstant are the vnfriendly friendships of the world, who for the most part are grounded on profit, not on Honor, on auarice, not on Vertue, on their owne gold, not on the want of their Christian neighbours and bretheren: But enough of this, and againe to our History . Now if Christina (for onely by that name I will hencefoorth intitle her) haue any comfort or consolation left her, to sweeten the bitternesse of her Husbands death, it is onely to see him suruiue and liue in her sonne Maurice , in whose vertues and yeares, her hopes likewise begin againe to bud foorth and flourish; when remembring what an earnest care and desire her husband had to see him a Scholler, as shee inherites his goods, so shee will assume and inherite that resolution of his: and although she loue her sonnes fight, and affect his presence tenderly and dearly, yet she can giue no peace to her thoughts, nor take any truce of her resolutions, till she send him from Morges to the Vniuersitie of Losanna , some three leagues distant thence, there to perfect his Studies and learning, the seedes whereof already so hopefully blossomed foorth, and fructified in him. To which end, her deepest affection and care hauing hearkened out one Deodatus Varesius , a Bachelor of Diuinitie of that Vniuersitie , whom Fame (though indeed most falsely) had informed her to be an expert Scholler , and an excellent Christian , shee agrees with him; when allowing her sonne an honest exhibition, and furnishing him with Bookes, a Gowne, and all other necessaries, she sends him away to Losanna , charging him at his departure to bee carefull of his Learning, carriage, and actions; and aboue all, to make pietie and godlinesse in his life and conuersation, the Regent of all his studies, when with teares of naturall affection, they take leaue each of other. Maurice being arriued at Losanna , findes out his Tutor Varesius , who receiues and welcomes this his Pupill courteously and kindly: but alas , the hopes of Christina the mother, are extreamely deceiued in the vertues of Varesius ; because his Vices will instantly deceiue both the merites and expectation of her Sonne , or rather change nature and qualities in him, and thereby shortly make him as vicious in Losanna , as formerly hee was vertuous in Morges: for I write with griese and pitie, that to define the truth aright, it was difficult to say, whether he were more learned, or deboshed, a more perfect Scholler, or prophane Christian : for albeit the dignitie of his Batchelorship of Theologie , did hide many of his dissolute prankes, and obsceane imperfections, yet his exhorbitant deportment and industry could not so clossely oueruaile and obscure them, but his intemperate affection to drinking, and beastly inclination to drunkennesse, began now to become obuious and apparant to the eyes and Heads of his Colledge , yea to the whole Vniuersitie: A most pernitious and swinish Vice , indeede too too much incident and subiect to these people the Swisses ; but if it had been immured and confined within these Rockes and Mountaines of Germany , it had prooued not only a happinesse, but a blessing to the other Westerne part of the Christian world, where it spreads its infection like an vncontrouleable and incurable Gangreene , yea like a most contagious and fatall pestilence: so as in Varesius there was nothing more incongruous and different, then his Doctrine and his life, his profession and conuersation, his Theorie , and his Practice , his knowledge and his will. But if the head-springs and fountaines bee corrupted with this vice and drunkennesse, no maruell if the Riuers and Streames of Common-weales bee infected and poysoned therewith; yea, if it bee not debarred, but haue admittance and residence in the Schooles and Classes of Vniuersities , from which Nurses and Gardens of the Muses, both the Church and Estate fetch their chiefest Ornaments and Members: how can we expect to see it rooted out from the more illiterate Commons, whose grosse ignorance makes them farre more capable to learne Vice , then Vertue ; or rather Vice , and not Vertue ; sith there is no shorter nor truer Art to learne it, then of their Art Masters , because the example and president of ill doing in our Teachers and Superiors, doth not onely plant, but ingraffe and root it; not onely priuiledge, but as it were, authorise it in vs, still with a fatall impetuositie, with a dangerous violence, and pernitious euent and issue: for if remedies be not to be found in learned Phisicions , it is then in vaine to seeke them in the rude and vnlearned people; and if the Preceptor himselfe bee not sanctified, it is rather to bee feared then doubted, that his Disciple will not. This (yea this) is a most mournefull and fatall rocke, whereon diuers vertuous and religious Parents, haue euen wept themselues to death, to see their children suffer shipwracke: yea, this beastly and brutish sinne of Drunkennesse, is still the Deuils Vsher and Pander to all other sinnes; and therefore how cautious and carefull ought the Heads of Schooles & Vniuersities be, to expell and root it out from themselues, and to hate  & detest it in others, sith in the remisse winking thereat, I may (with as much truth as saftie) affirm, that toleration, is confirmation; & conniuency, cruelty; as we shall not go far to see it made good, and verified in this ensuing mournful History; the which in exacting Inke from my Pen, doth likewise command blood from my heart, and teares from mine eyes, to anatomize and vnfold it. Difficultly hath Maurice been three moneths in Losanna with Varesius , but his vertues are ecclipsed and drowned in vice; yea, he not onely thinks, but holds it a vertue, to make himselfe culpable and guiltie of this his Tutors Vice of Drunkennesse , wherein within lesse then three moneths, hee prooues so expert, or indeed so execrable a Scholler in this beastly Art, as both day and night, he makes it not onely his practise, but his delight;  & not onely his delight, but his glory. Hee who before was so temperate in his drinke and conuersation in Morges , as for the most part he wholly dranke water, not wine; now hee is is so viciously metamorphosed in Losanna , as contrariwise, he onely drinkes wine, and no water; yea, and which is lamentable to remember, and deplorable to obserue in this young Scholler , he drinks (or to write truer, deuoures it) so excessiuely, as his Cups are become his Bookes; his carrowsing, his learning; the Tauerne, his Studie; and Drunkennesse the only Art he professeth: which filthy and infectious disease, spreading from the Preceptor to the Pupill , from old Varesius to young Maurice , hath so surprised the one, and seiz'd on the other, as it threatens the disparagement of the first his reputation, and the shipwracke of the seconds fortunes, and it may be of his life. Now Varesius , who will not bee ashamed to pitie this beastly Vice in himselfe, doth yet pitie it with shame to behold it in his Scholler Maurice , and yet hath neither the Grace to reforme it in himselfe, nor the will or power to reprooue it in him; but instead of stopping and preuenting, doth in all things giue way to the current and torrent of this swinish sinne, which ineuitably drawes after it these threefold diseases and miseries: The poyson of our bodies, the consumption of our purses, and the moath and Canker of our reputations; or if you will these three not farre different from the three former: The bane of our wits, the enemy of our health and life, and the consumer of our Estates and friends: And within the compasse of one whole yeare, to all those diseases and miseries doth the drunkennesse of our deboshed young Scholler Maurice subiect and reduce him; so as it being the nature of sinne (not checked and vanquished with repentance) rather to grow then wither, to flourish then fade or decay with our age: the longer Maurice liued in Losanna , the deeper roote this beastly vice of Drunkennesse tooke in him,  & he the deerer affection to it; so as that competent exhibition which his mother yearely allowed him, became [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) incomputable with this his excessiue podigality and intemperancy: Yea, his extreame superfluity in this kinde, was without intermission so frequent, as three quarters of his yeares pension could not discharge one of his expences and debts, so strong a habit (conuerted now to a second Nature) had this bewitching beastly sinne of drunkennesse exacted and gotten of him, as if this were his felicity, and that hee onely triumphed to become a slaue to this his slauish appetite and swynish profession, which to support and maintaine, hee not onely feeds, but surfets his mother with variety of subtill and insinuating letters, thereby to draw diuers summes of monies from her, as indeed hee doth; some vnder pretext of his necessitie to buy new bookes, which hee affirmed he wanted; others vnder pretence of his weakenesse and siknesse, and such like colourable excuses: which vnthriftie prodigality of his, doth as fast emptie her purse and store, as her industrious frugality can possibly fill them, whereof hauing all the reasons of the world to become sencible; shee at last making her iudgement consult with her affection, beginnes now to feare, that her sonne was become lesse vertuous, and more deboshed then she hoped of, and that these his letters and petitions for money, were but onely trickes to deceiue the hopes, and betray the confidence she reposed in his vertuous carriage, and godly inclination; whereof being in fine informed and certified, from such Students and Burghers of Losanna , whom shee had set as Sentenells , to haue Argus , yea Lynceus eyes ouer his actions and deportments, she at last with few thanks to his Tutor Varesius , many complaints and exclamations to her sonne, and inexpressable griefe and sorrow to her selfe, calles and commands him home from Losanna to Morges , where with much bitternesse and secrecy, shee taxeth and rates him for his drunkennesse and prodigalitie, in that he had vainely spent in one yeare, more then either his father and her selfe could collect or gather vp in many. But see the lewd subtiltie, and wretched deceitfulnesse of this dissolute sonne towards this his deare and tender mother: for then and there seasoning his speeches with vertue, and his behauiour with obedience and pietie, he modestly seemes not onely to tax her credulitie, conceiued against the candeur and integritie of his actions; but also with a kind of Tacite choller, to maligne and traduce those who iniustly and falsly had cast so foule an aspersion on his vertues and innocency; and the better to make those his speeches, and this his Apologie and Iustification passe current with his mother, his discretion now prescribes so fayre a Law to his Vanitie , and his reason to his intemperate and irregular desires, as to the eye of the world, and to her more curious and obseruant iudgement, hee seemes to be the very picture and Statue of Vertue , although God and his foule soule and Conscience well knowes, that he is the true, essentiall, and reall Image of Vice: and the better to cloke and oueruaile this his dissimulation from the eyes of God and his mother, although he continue to take his Cuppes by night, yet in Morges , and especially in his mothers house and sight, he casts them off by day; and the better, and more firmely to reintegrate himselfe into her approbation and fauour, hee mornings and euenings is seene at his prayers, and spends the greatest part of his time in hearing and frequenting of Sermons , the which affoords such sweet content to her conceits and thoughts, as shee repents herselfe of her vnkindnesse towards him, and not onely acquits him of his drunkennesse, prodigalitie, and dissolutenesse, but also accuseth his accusers, who shee now as much condemnes for Enuy and Malice towards her Sonne , as shee highly (and as she thinks iustly) applauds him for his religious pietie towards God . But sith Hypocrisie is worse then Prophanenesse, as making vs rather Deuils then Saints; or indeed not Saints, but Deuils; and that no sacrifice is so odious, nor obiect so hatefull to God , as he who denies and dissembleth it in his lookes, and yet professeth and practiseth it in his heart and soule: so we shall see to our griefe, and this wretched Hypocrite finde to his misery, that thinking to deceiue God , he shall in the end deceiue himselfe; and in attempting to betray his mother through his false Vertue , his true Vice will at last betray him, and make him as miserable, as hee flattereth himselfe it will make him fortunate. Now the better to root and confirme this opinion of his temperancy in his mothers conceits and mind, and so the more secretly to oueruaile his excessiue affection and addiction to Drunkennesse , he vnder the pretence of some necessary and profitable occasions, gets leaue of her, somtimes to ride ouer to Berne, Soleure, Fribourg; Apensall , and other capitall townes of the Cantons , where he falls afresh to his cups, and there continually both day & night swils his braines, and stuffes vp his belly with wine, as if hee tooke no other delight or glory, but to drowne his wit and learning with his money, and his health with both; and yet againe when he returnes to Morges , he makes such fayre weather with his mother, and casts so temperate a cloake and colour on his speeches and actions, as if it were impossible for him to drinke more then would suffice Nature , or to desire more then would meerely quench his thirst. And thus by his Hipocriticall policy, hauing againe wrought himselfe into his mothers good opinion and fauour, as also some store of money out of her purse and coffers; he with a feigned shew of Humilitie and discretion, takes leaue of her, and to perfect his studies and Learning, returnes againe to Losanna ; where he is no sooner arriued, but vpon his new returne, he finds out his olde carrowsing companions, who like so many pestilent Vipers, and contagious Moaths and Caterpillars, are viciously, and therefore fatally resolued, not onely to eate out the bottome of his purse, but also the heart of his happinesse; and as I may iustly tearme it, to deuoure the very soule of his felicitie: and with these tippling brats of Bacchus , doth our lewd and debaushed Scholler, Maurice , continually drinke-drunke, not onely forgetting his learning, but himselfe; and which is worse, his God , hauing neither the power to remember to repent, or grace to pray; nor to remember any thing, except his cups; so beastly is he inclined, so swinishly and viciously is he affected and addicted; and what doth this either prognosticate, presage, or promise to produce in him, but ineuitable affliction, misery, and ruine of all sides? As the shortest Errours are best: so those Vices which haue longest perseruerance and predominance in vs, proue still the most pernicious and dangerous: It is nothing to crush a Serpent in the Egge; but if we permit it to grow to a Serpent, it may then crush vs: a plant may be remooued with ease; but an old tree difficultly: To fall from sinne to repentance, is as great a happinesse, as it is a misery to fall from repentance to sinne: and indeed to vse but one word for the affirmation and confirmation of this truth, there can no greater misery befall vs, then to thinke our selues happy, when (through our sinnes) wee are miserable. Heere in Losanna, Maurice esteemes this his beastly sinne of drunkennesse to bee a Vertue , not a Vice in him; yea, in paying for all shots and reckonings in Tauernes, he sottishly and foolishly thinks it the shortest and truest way to bee beloued and honoured, (though indeed to be contemned) of all; and therefore without feare or wit, yea without the least spark of Grace , or shaddow of consideration, his stomacke (like the Deuils spunge,) and his vnsatiable throate (like a bottomlesse gulfe) so deuoures his wine, and his wine his money, as that which should be the Argument of his glory, he makes the cause of his shame; and his money which should fortifie his reputation, he conuerts and turnes to ruine it. But as pouertie (in a iust reuenge of our Vanitie ) reioyceth to looke on vs, because wee first disdained, either to looke on, or regard it; so hee hauing spent the fragrant Summer of his folly and prodigality, in wasting the moneyes his mother gaue him, in wine; now the depriuation thereof makes him feele the frosty Winter of that want, which hee can better remember, then remedy, rather repent, then redresse. The Fellowes and Studients of his Colledge, looke on him and his Drunkennesse, some with the eyes of pittie, others with those of ioy, according as their friendship, or malice, their Charity or Enuy either conduct their passions, or transport, and steere their resolutions and inclynations. And for his Tutor Varesius , how can he possible seeke or reclayme this his Puppill from Vice to Vertue , when he is so wretchedly disolute, as by the publike vote and voyce of the Vniuersitie , hee himselfe is already wholy and soly relapsed from Vertue to Vice . In which respect, this vitious young Studient Maurice , hauing neither Vertue nor Tutor , money nor credit, discretion nor friend, to secure him from the shelues of Indigence, or the rockes of Pouerty and Misery, whereon hee is rashly and wilfully rushing; he like a true deboshed Scholler, or indeed as a Master of Art, in the Art of deboshednesse, first sels away his bookes, then his gowne and cloathes, and next his bed, being desirous to want any thing but wine; and confidently (though vainely and foolishly) assured, that if he haue wine enough, that then hee wants nothing. A miserable consideration and condition, a wretched Estate and resolution, onely tending and conducing to direfull misery, and to deplorable pouerty and desolation. But to replenish his purse, to repayre his credit, and apparell, and to continue his cuppes  & drunkennesse, he hath no other hopes or refuge, then againe to cast himselfe on the affection and courtesie of his mother whom hee re-visits with seuerall Letters, which are onely so many humble insinuating petitions, againe to draw and wrest moneyes from her. But he is deceiued in his hopes, and expectation, or at least they destinctly and seuerally, and his mother ioyntly with them, conspire to deceiue him. For I write it with griefe, because (by an vncontroulable relation of the truth) shee dictates it to my pen with teares; that as well by all those of Morges , who came from Losanna , as by all those of Losanna who came to Morges , she is most certainly  & sorrowfully aduertised of her sonnes deboshed and disolute life, of his neglect of Learning, and too frequent affecting and following of drunkennesse, of the sale of his cloathes, bed and bookes; of the erreparable losse, both of his time, moneyes and reputation; and withall, how the dregs and fumes of wine, hath metamorphised his countenance, and not Graced, but filthily disgraced it with many fiery Rubies and flaming Carbunkles; as also how it hath stuffed and bombasted vp his belly and body; as if the dropsie and he contended who should first seize each on other, and therefore shee being (with a mournefull vnwillingnesse) enforced, not onely to take notice, but sorrowfully to rest assured and confident of these disasterous premises, the infallible predictions & Symptomes of her Sonnes vtter ruine and subuersion: Shee peremptorily and absolutely refuseth his requests, answereth his Letters with many sharpe complaints and bitter exclamations against his foule sinne of Drunkennesse, which threatnes no lesse then the ruine, both of his Reputation, Friends, Learning, Fortune and Life, if not of his Soule. Maurice , seeing himselfe wholy abandoned of his Mother, he knowes not how to liue, nor yet how to prouide the meanes to maintaine life, which not only surpriseth his thoughts, but amazeth and appaleth his cogitations with feare; yea, he takes this discourtesie of hers so neere at heart, and withall is so extreamely impatient, to see himselfe forsaken of her, whom hee knowes the Lawes of Nature hath commanded to affect and cherish: as forgetting himselfe to be her Sonne, and she his Mother; yea forgetting himselfe to be a man, and which is more a Christian , his wants and Vices so farre transports him beyond the bounds of Reason and Religion , of Nature and Grace , as hee impiously and execrably degenerates from them all and secretly vowes to his heart and soule, or to say truer, to the deuill: (who inchanteth the one, and infecteth and intoxicateth the other) that hee will speedily send her into another world in a bloody Coffin, if shee will not releeue his wants and maintaine him as her Sonne in this. So Alas here it is, that he first giues way to the deuill to take posession of his thoughts and heart, and here it is, that he first assumes bad blood, and suggests bloody designes, against the safety and life of his deere and innocent Mother. When like a miserable wretch, and a wretched and impious villaine, his thoughts and studies (like so many lynes running to their centre) are now in continuall action and motion, how to finish and bring this deplorable Tragicall businesse to an end: yea, the better to feed this his insatiable bloody appetite, and to quench the quenchlesse thirst of his Matracidious reuenge, he forgets all other proiects and affaires, to follow and hasten on this; which (to giue one word for all) takes vp both his study and his time in Losanna , casting away his bookes, which would seeme to diuert him from it, as if hee courted Pluto , not Apollo; Proserpina , not Pallas; Errynnis , not Vrania ; the Furies , not the Muses: and as afflictions seldome come alone, but many times (as the waues of the sea) fall one in the necke of another; so to make him rather aduance then retire, in the execution of this his vnnaturall and damnable attempt, his excessiue and frequent drunkennesse, makes him so notoriously apparrant to the Heads of the Vniuersity in generall, and of his owne Colledge in particular, that they giue him his Conge , and (without lending any eare to his Apologie or Iustification) expell him thence. So that being now destitute of all friends and meanes, hee is enforced to see himselfe reduced to this point of misery, that hee must either begge or starue, which to preuent (because hee as much disdaines the first, as he is resolued to prouide a remedy for the second) he leaues Losanna (where his Vices and debts haue made the stones too hot for him) and on foote, goes home to his Mother to Morges , hoping that his presence may preuayle more with her then his absence; and his tongue make that easie, which his pen (in his Letters) found not only difficult but impossible. Being arriued at Morges , his louing  & indulgent Mother, receiues him with teares, not of ioy, but of grief, for his Drunkennesse hath so deformed his face, and body; as at the first sight shee dificultly knew him to be her Sonne, and although hee take paines to conceale that beastly Vice of his, and so to playster, and varnish it ouer with a feigned shew of repentance and reformation; yet shee sees to her affliction, and obserues to her misery, that hee loues his Cups better then his life, and that as soone as shee once turnes her backe from him, hee falls close to them; and so tippleth and carrouseth from Morning to Night. Three dayes are scarce past, before hee makes two requests to her, the one for new cloathes, the other for money; when, to the end that her wisdome might shine in her affection as well as her affection in her wisdome, shee cheerefully grants him the first, but peremptorily dennies him the second, because shee well knowes it would be so much cast away on him, sith he would instantly cast it away on wine, and to write the truth, the grant of his apparell doth not so much content him, as the refusall of her money doth both afflict and inflame him; He is all in choller hereat, and the fumes of Reuenge doe so implacably take vp and seize on his thoughts, and they on it; as now without the feare of God, or care of his soule, hee like a damnable villaine, and an execrable Sonne, swaps a bargaine with the Deuill, to destroy and make away his Mother: Hellish resolutions and infernall conceits, which will not onely strangle those who embrace, but confound those who follow them: His impiety made him formerly assume this bloody fact, and now his necessity of want of money (in that hee cannot as it were drowne himselfe in the excesse of Drunkennesse) enforceth him to a resolution to finish it. His faith is so weake towards God, and so strong with the deuill, as he will not retire with Grace, but aduance with impiety, to see as well the end as the beginning of this bloody businesse: Hee consults hereon with his delight, not with his reason; with his will, not with his Conscience; with his heart, not with his Soule. Hee sees hee hath no money, and knowes, or at least beleeues, that his Mother hath enough, and therfore concludes, that if she were once dead, it were impossible, that his life should want any. So these two wretched Councellors, Couetousnesse and Drunkennesse , (or rather Couetousnesse to maintaine his Drunkennesse) like two infernall fiends and furies, haule him on head-long to perpetrate this bloody and mournefull murther of his deere and tender Mother, the end whereof, will bring him as much true misery and infamy, as the beginning doth flatter and promise him false content and happinesse; his youth hath no regard to her age, and lesse to her Life, neither will hee vouchsafe to remember that hee first receiued his of her: yea, all the blood which flowes in his heart, and streames in his veines and body, cannot any way haue the power to prompe him, that it is deriued and descended from hers. And if Morges will not diuert him, Losanna should; if his yeares cannot instruct him, yet his bookes might; and if Nature preuailed not with his heart, yet mee thinkes Grace should with his Conscience, to represent him the foulenesse of this attempt, and the vnnaturall cruelty thereof, in resoluing to imbrew his diabolicall hands in her innocent blood; or if the influence of these earthly considerations could not allay the heate of his malice, or quench the fire of his reuenge towards her, yet mee thinkes looking from prophanenesse to piety, from Earth to Heauen; from the time present, to the future; from the corruption of his Body, to the immortality of his Soule; from Sinne to Righteousnesse, from Reuenge to Religion, and consequently from satan to God, hee should hate this bloody designe and proiect of his as much as now he loues it, and seeke the preseruation of his Mother, with as much obedience and affection, as now he contriues and pursues her vntimely end with impiety and detestation. But his Vices will still triumph ouer his Vertues; and therefore it is rather to be feared then doubted, that they will in the end [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) worke him too miserable, euer to see himselfe so happy. Miserable Maurice therefore, (as the shame of his time, the disgrace of his sexe, and a prodigious monster of Nature ) hauing hellishly resolued on the matter, now with a deuilish fortitude and hellish assurance passeth on to the maner of her Tragedy. He wil not giue eare to God, who seekes to diuert him from it, but will hearken to the deuill, who vseth his best Oratory to perswade and intice him to it. But as the deuil is malicious in his subtilty, so should we be both wise and cautious in our credulity; for if wee beleeue him, he will betray vs; but if wee beleeue God, we shall then betray him: he is impatient of delayes, yea, his malice is so bloody, and his reuenge so cruell, as hee thinkes euery houre a yeare, till hee hath sent her from Earth to Heauen: He proposeth vnto himselfe diuers wayes to murther her, and the deuill who is neuer absent but present in such hellish occasions, makes him as well industrious as vndictiue, and implacable, in the contriuing and finishing thereof. Now he thinkes to cut her throate as shee is in bed: Then to poyson her at table, either in her meate or drinke. Then againe hee is of opinion to hire some to kill her as shee is walking in her vineyards; or else to cause two Watermen to drowne her, as shee is taking the ayre in a boate on the Lake, which twice or thrice weekely she is accustomed to doe; but yet still he is irresolute, either which, or which not to resolue on, till at last after a weekes dilatory protaction, hauing with a fatall and infernall ratiotination banded and rebanded these seuerall bloody proiects in his braynes and contemplations, hee reiecteth them all, as more fuller of difficulty and apparant danger, then of warrantable safety, when considering that there was a deepe Well in the outter yard, adioyning to the Garden, he holds it fittest for his purpose to drowne her therein, whereon the deuill and he strikes hands, and set vp their rest and periode. Whiles thus this gracious mother Christina endeauors with her best care and prayers, to diuert her gracelesse sonne Maurice from this his intemperate, and beastly sinne of Drunkennesse , he (as if hee were no part of her, but rather a limbe of the Deuill) with a monstrous and inhumane ingratitude, sets his inuentions and braines on the tenter hookes, to espy out the occasion and time to dispatch her. When burning with a flaming desire; to quench the insatiable thirst of his reuenge in her blood: he (taking time and opportunity at aduantage) seeing all his mothers people abroad to gather in the Vintage, the well open, and shee with a Prayer booke in her hand, walking in the Garden next adioyning, the Deuill infuseth such courage to his heart, his heart such crueltie and inhumanitie to his soule, and his soule to his resolutions, that all things seemed then to conspire to see an end to this his so long desired and affected businesse of murthering and dispatching his mother, he taking on him the part of a mad man, whom it seemed sorrow had suddenly afflicted, and griefe distracted, hee with his hat in his hand, hastily and furiously rusheth into the Garden to his mother, and cries out to her, that there is one of the neighbours children fallen into the well, which he espyed from his chamber window: whereunto (harmelesse good woman) she adding beliefe to his false and perfidious speeches, and being (beyond her selfe) afflicted and amazed with this sodaine and sorrowfull newes, shee throwes away her Booke, and hand in hand with him, (her sighes interrupting her words, and her teares her sighes) she (as if pittie added wings to her feet) trips away to the well, both to see this mournfull spectacle, and chiefly to know, if it any way lay in her possible care to assist, or power to preserue the said child from death: when bringing her to the well, hee better like a fury, then a man, and rather resembling a meere Deuill, then a sonne, fasteneth his left hand on the well- post, and as she lookes into the profunditie thereof, hee with his right hand tips and throwes her in; and so without any more doing, claps downe the couer thereof; when reioycing in his heart that he had sent her to death, because he sees and knowes it now, not in the power of the whole world to saue her life. He (the better to oueruaile this his impious villany, and to obscure this his barbarous and bloody fact) ascends her chamber, breakes open her cupboards, trunks, and chests, takes away most of her money, and siluer plate, which hee priuately hides away for his owne behoofe and vse, and so scattereth a few pieces of money, and some of her clothes and apparell in the floore, thereby subtilly to insinuate and intimate to the world; that it were theeues who had robbed and drowned his mother; when stealing a horse out of the stable, he with much secrecy gets him out of the backe doore, which hee leaues open, and from thence rides away to his mothers people in the Vineyards; to whom he relates he hath been all that morne abroad to take the ayre, and is now come to passe the remainder of the day with them, and to be merry: to which end (in his mothers name) he sends for wine from the skirts of the town; and so (as well men as mayds) they carrowse and frolike it till towards night, and then they all returne home, where they find both doores open, his mother their Mistris wanting, and no creature whatsoeuer in the house, whereat they much admire and wonder. So the seruants and himselfe seeke and call her in the Orchards and Gardens, but in vaine, for they find no newes of her; when the mayds one way, and he and the men-seruants another way, seek her as well in the roomes and chambers, as in the streets and neighbors houses, where shee is accustomed to frequent, but to no purpose; for they can neither see nor heare of her; till at length the maydens rushing into her bed-chamber, they find her Cupboard, Chests, and Trunks broken open, and some of her money and apparell strewed heere and there on the floore; whereat amazed, they lamentably cry out at windowes, that theeues haue been there, and robbed their Mistris her Chests and Trunks: which Maurice , and the men-seruants of the house ouer-hearing, they ascend, and admire at the sight thereof; neither doth his outward feares, or their inward apprehensions, stop or stay at the meere losse of the goods, but they ioyntly apprehend, and feare the absence of his mother, and their Mistris Christina , and are already become iealous and vmbragious of her safetie, and very fearefull, that the theeues haue offered her some violence and crueltie. Whereupon late at night, hearing no newes of her, her sonne (because chiefly interested in this disastrous accident) goes and acquaints the Baylife of Morges , and the rest of the Cryminall Officers therewith, who of all sides enquire for her, and make a secret and curious search in the towne, to find out the theeues; and in the meane time (together with Maurice and the seruants) leaue not a roome nor place of the house vnsought for her: but their diligence prooues vaine, for they can purchase no newes of her, much lesse of the theeues. They remaine in the house all night, and they all with sorrowfull and watchfull eyes, euery minute of an houre, expect her, or newes of her. Eight of the clocke the next day strikes, but as yet shee is not so much as seene or heard of: So they againe, in presence of the Bayliffe , reuisite and search all places and corners both in the House, Gardens, Orchyards, and Yards; but still to no effect or purpose: when behold, the sacred and secret prouidence of God, in reuealing her to be drowned in the well, not onely beyond the expectation, but also beyond the beliefe of all that were present: for as they are in the middest of their doubts and feares, yea in the very depth of their research and perquisition; loe, one of the seruant Mayds, named Hester , who was neerest in the fauour, and dearest in the affection of her Mistris , hauing that very instant morning taken a nap of an houres sleepe; or thereabouts in a chayre, starts suddenly out of her sleepe and rest, trips to them, and sayes, shee then and there dreamt, that her Mistris Christina , was cast into the well, and drowned; the which shee affirmed with many words, and more sighes, out-cries, and teares; which peircing into the eares and thoughts of the Bayliffe and Seruants, and into the very heart and Conscience of this our execrable Maurice , they looke pale with griefe and amazement, and hee straineth the highest key of his Art and policy to keepe his cheekes from blushing for shame thereat,  & the better to hood winke their eyes & iudgments, from the least spark or shaddow of this his guiltinesse herein; he with many showers of hypocriticall teares, prayes the Bayliffe that vpon Hesters dreame, and report the Well may be searched, adding withall, that it was more probable then impossible; that those theeues who robbed his Mothers house, might likewise bee so deuillishly malicious to murther her and throw her into the Well: which the Bayliffe seriously considering, as first the maides dreame, then the Sonnes request and teares, hee instantly in presence of all those of the house, as also of many of the next neighbours whom he had purposely assembled: Caused the Well to be searched and sounded, where the hooke taking hould of her clothes, they instantly bring vp the dead body of his Mother and their Mistresse Christina: the skull of whose head was lamentably broken, and her braines pittifully dashed out with her fall. All are amazed, her Seruants greeue, and her hellish Sonne Maurice weepes and cries more then all the rest at this mournfull spectacle. The Bayliffe carefully and punctually againe examine Hester , if God in her dreame reuealed her not, the manner how, and the persons who had thus throwne her Mistresse into the Well; Shee answereth negatiuely according to the truth, that shee had already deliuered as much as shee knew of that mournefull businesse. When Maurice to shew his forwardnesse and zeale, for the detection and finding out of his Mothers murtherers, hee pretends that he suspects Hester to be accessary, and to haue a hand herein. But the Bayliffe and common Councell of Morges , hauing neither passion nor partiality to dazle and inueagle the eyes of their iudgement, finding no reason or ground of probability to accuse her, or which might tend or conduce that way; They free her without farther questioning her, and so (as it hath beene formerly remembred) they all concurring in opinion that the theeues who robbed her, had vndoubtedly throwne her into the Well: They giue leaue to Maurice to bury his breathlesse mother, which he doth with the greatest pompe  & decency, requisite as well to her ranke and quality, as to his affection and dutie; and the better to fanne off the least dust or smoake of suspition, which might any way fall vpon the lustre of his Innocency, he at her Funerall, (to the eye of the world) sheds many riuolets of teares. But alas what is this, to this his foule and execrable sinne of murthering his mother; for although it bleere the eyes, and inueigle the iudgements of the Bayliffe and his associates, the Cryminell Iudges of Morges , yet God the Great and Soueraigne Iudge of Heauen and Earth , will not bee thus deluded, cannot be thus diceiued herein. No, no, for albeit hee be mercifull, yet His deuine Maiesty is too Iust, to let crimes of this hellish nature goe either vndetected or vnpunished. Wee haue seene this execrable Sonne so bloody hearted and handed, as with a deuillish rage, and inhumane and infernall furie, to drowne his own deere & tender Mother; & with as much cruelty as ingratitude, to throw her from the world into a Well, who with many bitter gripes & torments (to the hazzard and perill of her life) threw him from her wombe into the world: and the prouidence and Iustice of God will not lead the curiosity of the Reader farre, before wee see this miserable miscreant ouertaken, with the impetuous stormes of Gods reuenge, and the fiery gusts and tempests of his iust indignation for the same, notwithstanding that his subtill malice, and malicious subtilty, haue so cunningly contriued, and so secretly acted and compacted it with the deuill, that no earthly person or sublunary eye, can any way accuse, much lesse conuict him thereof; as marke the sequell, and it will briefly and truly informe thee how. As soone as he hath buryed his Mother, his blacke mourning apparell, doth in his heart  & actions work such poore and weake effects of repentance and sorrow for her vntimely death, as where diuers others lament and grieue, he contrariwise reioyceth and triumpheth thereat, and by her decease being now become Lord and Master of all, he like a gracelesse villaine falls againe to his old carowsing companions, and veine of drunkennesse; wherein hee takes such singular delight and glory, as hee makes it not onely his pastime and exercise by day, but his practise and recreation by night; And as the Lord hath infinite meanes and wayes to scourge and reuenge the enormity of our delicts and crimes, so wee shall shortly see for our instruction, and obserue for our reformation, that this vngoldly and beastly Vice of drunkennesse of his, which is his most secret bosome and darling Sinne, will in the end prooue a rauenous Vulture to deuour, and a fatall Serpent to eate out the bowels, first of his wealth and prosperity, and then of his life; for it not onely takes vp his time but his studie, in so much as I may as truely auerre to my griefe, as affirme to his shame, that he leueleth at nothing more then to make it his felicity, which swinish excesse and intemperancy (as a punishment inseperably incident and infalibly heriditary to that sinne) doth within three monethes make him sell away all his Lands; yea, and the greatest part of his plate, and houshold- stuffe, So his drunkennesse first, but then chiefly Gods Iustice and reuenge pursuing his foule and inhumane crime of drowning his Mother, makes him of being left rich by her, within a very short time become very extreame poore and miserable; So as hee runnes deepely into debts, yea, his debts are by this time become so exceedingly vrgent and clamorous, as contrary to his hopes and feares, when he least dreames thereof; hee is imprisoned by his Mercer and Draper, for the blackes of his Mothers Funerall', to both whom hee is indebted the some of three hundred crownes, which is farre more then either his purse can discharge, or his credit and Estate now satisfies. When abandoned of all his friends, his meanes spent and consumed, and nothing left him to exercise his patience in prison, but Dispaire; nor to comfort him, but the terrours of his bloody and guilty Conscience: Hee is clapt into a stinking Vault or Dungeon, where (in horror and detestation of his bloody cryme) the Glorious Lampe of Heauen, the Sunne, disdaines to send his radiant and glittering beames to comfort him; so as he who before was accustomed to fare deliciously, and as it were to swill and drowne himselfe in the best, and most curious wines, now hee must content himselfe onely with course bread and water; and yet his misery is so extreame, & that extremity of his so miserable, as he hath hardly enough to maintaine & sustaine life: But wee shall see that this first affliction of his, will instantly be followed and ouertaken by a second. Whitsonday being ariued, hee petitioneth his Goalor (for that day) to haue the liberty of the yarde, and the freedome of the ayre, which is granted him, when at night, descending the stayres, againe to be pent vp in his obscure Dungeon, his foote slips, and he receiues a fearefull fall, whereof the bone of his right Arme is broken in two peeces; and hauing no Chirurgion to looke to it, it putrifies and rots, so as for the preseruing of his life, hee within fifteene dayes is enforced to haue it cut off, a little below the shoulder: and this was the very same Hand and Arme which threw his Mother into the Well. A singular act of Gods reuenging Iustice, and Iust reuenge shewen herein. Oh that it may bee deepely imprinted in our hearts, and ingrauen in our soules, that the Reader hereof, of what sexe or quality soeuer, may as it were stand amazed, at the consideration of Maurice his impious sinne towards God , and of Gods due and true reuenge and requitall thereof, in his iust Iudgement and affliction towards him. But this is not enough for Maurice to suffer, nor for God to inflict on him for this his bloody and inhumane Crime, in murthering his Mother: nor to say the truth, it is but the Prologue , to the deplorable, yet deserued punishment, which is immediatly ready to surprise and befall him. For to the end, that the truth may informe our curiositie, and our curiositie vs, of the Catastrophe of this Tragedy; we must vnderstand, that it was the pleasure and prouidence of God, that the breaking and cutting away of Maurice his Arme, proued the breake-necke of his patience, and the cutting away of his content and iudgement. The deuill caused him most inhumanly to drowne his Mother, the which he might haue refused to perpetrate, but would not; and now God in expiation thereof, sends him Rage for Reason, Dispaire for Comfort, and Madnesse for Sobriety, the which hee would flie and eschew, but cannot. Hee hath committed this execrable crime beyond the rules and Lawes of Nature ; and therefore God hath ordained, that hee should feele many degrees of punishments, and this is not onely the Law, but the rule of Grace . Of all degrees of afflictions, Madnesse is the most to bee pittied, and the worst to be cured; sith it makes a man goe farre beyond Reason; and therefore to come farre too short of himselfe, it is held of some to be a sicknesse of the Liuer, of others, an ouerfuming of the blood, and of others a debility of the braine: But in this our execrable wretched Maurice , it was the infectious Malady of his soule, which God sent purposely into his braines, to bee reuenged of his heart, for so inhumanly drowing his Mother: For although his Diuine Maiesty, hath infinite more wayes to punish murther, then man hath to commit it; yet that he might make the detection of this of wretched Maurice , as strange as the complotting and finishing thereof was cruelly inhumane, and inhumanely cruell; he purposely sends it him; for although since his imprisonment, hunger had so taken downe his stomacke, and quelled his courage, as his former volubility of speech, was now reduced to a kinde of sorrowfull and pensiue silence; yet as soone as his braines and senses, were possessed and captiuated with this prodigious Lunacy,  & outragious phrensie, then his fits were so violent, and that violence so implacable; as his speeches were so many fearefull outcries and howlings, and his words so many vncouth and vnheard of rauings. So that whosoeuer either heard or saw him, hee might iustly conceiue and affirme, that hee had thunder in his tongue and lightning in his eyes: For his crime made this his affliction and phrensie of his, so miserable, so impetuous, as he spake non-sense perfectly, and looked rather like a Furie then a Man; yea, his foule Conscience and poluted soule, rung him so many Panicke feares, and terrors of Dispaire, as hee was affrayd of all things, and angry with himselfe, because he could be no more affraid of himselfe; So as that Dungeon which could imprison his body, was not capeable to containe his thoughts, much lesse to immure his feares;  & in this miserable plight & perplexity: he remained for the space of ten dayes and nights, without any intermission, or hope of remedy, which infinitly disturbed his fellow prisoners, and chiefly his Goalor, whose [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80023001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC6B66&area=prose&forward=textsFT) yeares had neuer beene accustomed to heare such discordant tunes, much lesse to bee taken vp with such distastfull and fearefull melody. He acquaints the Common Councell of the towne hereof,  & importunatlie solicits them, that they will remooue his distracted prisoner Maurice , to some more fitter and more conuenient place. Who remembring what Maurice had beene, and now considering  & seeing what he is; They who heretofore would not be so charitable to releeue his pouertie, are yet now so religiously compassionate, as they pittie his Madnesse; So they command him from a Dungeon, to a Chamber, from his palate of straw to a fetherbed, from his bread and water, to wholesome meates and broths; but all this will not suffice; and to shew themselues, not onely good men, but good Christians, they to restore him to his wits and senses, make yet a farther progression in Charity. They cause him to be conferred with, by many good Diuines, who are not onely eloquent, but powerfull to perswade him to pray often, and to practise other Christian duties & offices; but his cries are so outragious, and his rauings so extrauagant, as hee is as vncapeable to relish their reasons, as they are to vnderstand his rage: When the very immediate Finger, & Prouidence of God makes them yet so sensible of his vnparalell'd misery, as they are resolued to remooue him from his Prison to an Hospitall, thereby to take the benefit of the ayre in the Gardens, Walkes and Fields; hoping that they might preuaile with him, to recall his wits, and re-establish his senses in their proper seats of Vnderstanding , and stations of Iudgement . When heere, (oh heere) I coniure thee Christian Reader to stand amazed and wonder with me, at the sacred and secret Iustice of the Lord , expressed and demonstrated in this Accident; For as his Vnder-Gaolor (by the Magistrates Command) takes him by the hand, with an intent to conduct him foorth from the Prison to an Hospitall; His bloudy Crime (like so many Bloud-hounds) pursuing his guiltie Conscience and Soule; his thoughts so inform'd his knowledge, and his knowledge so confirmes his beliefe, that the drowning of his Mother is detected; and that they now drawe him from his Prison to the place of Execution to suffer death for the same. Which apprehention and feare, God putting into his conceits and heart, in despite of his madnesse; he wanting an accuser. Loe, heere hee himselfe both accuseth and condemneth himselfe for the same; for the very Image of that conceite redoubliug his feare, as his feare did his phrensie and madnesse. He in the middest of those fitts, and the height of that Agony and Anxietie, Cries out with a loud voice, I haue drowned my Mother in the Well, I haue drowned my Mother in the Well, God will haue mee to Confesse it before he suffer you to hang mee; I speake it on earth, and by my part of Heauen, What I now Confesse is true . Which words no sooner escaped his tongue, but he instantly returnes againe to his outcryes of Phrensie and madnesse. His Gaolers, and the rest are amazed at these fearefull speeches, and bloudy Confession of his; which notwithstanding that they attribute to madnesse, yet they leade him to the Hospitall, He still rauing and crying as he passeth the streets: But Oh! Let vs heere farther admire with wonder, and wonder with admiration, at the prouidence and mercy of God here againe miraculously made apparent and manifested in this execrable wretch Maurice , for hee who outragiously cried in his prison and licentiously raued in the street, is no sooner entered into the Hospitall, but the pleasure of God had so ordained it, as his Madnesse fully falls from him, and hee absolutely recouereth againe his wits and senses, in such firme and settled manner, as if hee had neuer formerly beene touched or afflicted therewith. His Gaolors make report to the Magistrates, first of his confession of drowning his Mother, and then of his sudden and miraculous recouering of his perfect memory, iudgement and senses; as soone as he set foote within the Hospitall: Whereupon they as much astonished at the one, as wondering at the other; doe instantly repaire thither to him, and there araigne and accuse him, for that inhumane and bloody fact of his, whereof his owne Euidence and Confession hath now made him guilty. But they take him for another, or at least, hee will not be the same man: Hee denies this horrible and bloody crime of his, with many oathes and asseuerations; which they maintaine and affirme he hath confessed, sayes, That they either heard a Dreame or saw a Vision, whereof hee neither dreamt nor thought of; and that he was ready to lose all the blood and life of his body to finde out, and to be reuenged of the murtherers of his Mother. But the Magistrates are deafe to his Apologie , and considering the violence of his Madnesse by its sudden abandoning him, as also his free and vninforced confession of drowning his Mother; they conceiue that Gods prouidence and Iustice doth strongly operate in the detection of this foule and inhumane murther; and therefore contemning his requests and oathes (in the vindication of his Innocency) they cause him to be refetched from the Hospitall, to the Prison, and there adiudge him to the Racke, when although his heart and soule be terrified and affrighted with his apprehension and accusation; Yet the deuill is so strong with him, as he cannot yet finde in his heart to relent, much lesse to repent this foule and inhumane crime of his; but considering that hee acted it so secretly, as all the world could not produce a witnesse against himselfe, except himselfe; he vowes hee will be so impious and prophane in his fortitude and courage, as to disdaine these his torments; and to looke on them and his Tormentor with an eye, rather of contempt then feare: But God will be as propitious and indulgent to him, as hee is rebellious and refractory to God; for heere wee shall see both his Conscience and resolutions taught another rule, and prescribed a contrary Law; yea, heere wee shall behold and obserue in him, that now Righteousnesse shall triumph over Sinne, Grace over Nature , his Soule over his Body, Heauen over Hell , and GOD over Satan ; for at the very first sight of the Racke, the sight  & remembrance of his bloody crime, makes him shake and tremble extreamely, when his soule being illuminated, by the resplendant Sunne beames of Gods mercy, and the foggie mists of Hell and Satan, expelled and banished thence, hee falls to the ground on his knees, first beates his breast, and then errecting his eyes and hands towards Heauen; hee (with a whole deluge of teares) againe confesseth, that hee had drowned his Mother in the Well, from and for the which hee humbly craueth remission, both from Earth and Heauen. And although there bee no doubt, but God will forgiue his soule for this his soule murther; Yet the Magistrates of Morges , who haue Grauity in their lookes, Religion in their hearts  & speeches, & Iustice in their actions, will not pardon his body; so in detestation of this his feafull crime, and inhumane parracide, they in the morning condemne him, that very after-noone to be hanged. At the pronouncing of which sentence, as hee hath reason to aprooue the equity of their Iustice in condemning him to die, so he cannot refraine from grieuing at the strictnesse of the time, which they allot him for his preparation to death. But as soone as we forsake the deuill, we make our peace with God . All Morges and Losanna rings of this mournefull and Tragicall newes, and in detestation of this mournefull, inhumane and bloody crime of our execrable Maurice , they flocke from all parts and streetes to the place of execution, to see him expiate it by his death, and so to take his last farewell of his life. The Diuines, who are giuen him for fortifying and assisting his soule, in this her flight  & transmigration from Earth to Heauen, haue religiously preuailed with him, so as they make him see the foulenesse of his crime, in the sharpenesse of his contrition and repentance for the same; yea, hee is become so humble and withall so sorrowfull, for this his bloody and degenerate offence, as I know not whether hee thinke thereof with more griefe, or remember it with detestation & repentance. At his ascending the Ladder, most of his Spectators cannot refraine from weeping, and the very sight of their teares prooues the Argument of his; as his remembrance of murthering his Mother was the cause. He tells them hee greeues at his very soule, for the foulenesse of his fact, in giuing his Mother her death, of whom he had receiued his life. He affirmes, that Drunkennesse was not onely the roote, but the cause of this his beggery and misery, of his crime and punishment, and of his deboshed life and deserued death, from which with a world of sighes and teares; hee seekes and endeuours to diuert all those who affect and practise that beastly Vice. He declares, that his Mother was too vertuous so soone to goe out of the world, and himselfe too vitious (and withall too cruell) any longer to liue in it; that the sinnes of his life, had deserued this his shamefull death; and although hee could not preuent the last, yet, that hee heartily and sorrowfully repented the first. Hee prayed God to be mercifull to his soule, and then besought the world to pray vnto God for that mercy; when speaking a few words to himselfe, and sealing them with many teares, and farre fetched sighes; he lastly bids the world farewell, when enuiting the Executioner to doe his Office, he is turned ouer. And such was the vitious life, and deserued death of this Execrable Sonne and bloody Villaine Maurice: wherein I must confesse, that although his end were shamefull and sharpe; yet, it was by farre too too milde for the foulenesse of his crime, in so cruelly murthering his deere Mother Christina , whom the Lawes, both of Nature and Grace commanded him to preserue and cherish: Yea, let all Sonnes and Daughters of all ages and ranckes, whatsoeuer looke on this bloody and disasterous example of his, with feare; and feare to commit the like by the sight of his punishment. It is a History worthy, both of our meditation and detestation, whether we cast our eyes on his drunkennesse, or fixe our thoughts and hearts on his murther: Those who loue and feare God, are happy in their liues, and fortunate in their deaths; but those who will neither feare nor loue him, very seldome prooue fortunate in the one, neuer happy in the other; and to the rest of our sinnes, if we once consent and giue way to adde that scarlet, and crying one of Murther; that blood which we vntimely send to the Earth, will in Gods due time draw downe vengeance on our Heads from Heauen; Charitie is the marke of a Christian , and the shedding of Innocent blood, either that of an Infidell , an Athiest , or a Deuill . O therefore let vs affect and striue to hate it in others, and so shall wee the better know how to detest and abhorre it in our selues, which that wee may all know to our comforts, and remember to our consolations, direct vs O Lord our God, and so we shall be directed.
