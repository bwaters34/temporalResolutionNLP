Not with[s]tanding the fairy [s]cene of imagination with re[s]pect to the advancement of Teague, in which the Captain had [s]uffered him[s]elf to be engaged; yet [s]ometimes he would begin to doubt with regard to the reality of the pro[s]pects, and to que[s]tion whether, after all, it was probable that the executive of the United States would think him adequate to the di[s]charge of judicial or mini[s]terial functions, and appoint him accordingly. Ruminating one day on this [s]ubject, a [s]ervant pre[s]ented a billet: It was from the President of the United States, expre[s][s]ing a desire to [s]ee the Captain, and to conver[s]e with him relative to the appointment of the young man in his [s]ervice, of the name of Teague O'Regan, to [s]ome office in the government. Nothing could be more opportune: for the Captain at that moment, weary [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-499.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] weary of his charge, and di[s]pairing of success, was ju[s]t about to re inqui[s]h all further pro[s]ecution of his object, and to remand Teague to his boot-cleaning and hor[s]e currying as formerly. It may ea[s]ily be [s]uppo[s]ed that he lo[s]t no time in having his coat and hat bru[s]hed, and [s]etting out to wait on his excellency. Pre[s]enting him[s]elf, he was a[s]ked to fit down; and the conver[s]ation opening on the [s]ubject of Teague, and his qualifications for office. The Captain not willing to be the means of deception in the introduction of his valet, thought proper to deal candidly with his excellency, and to give him an exact account of the education and hi[s]tory of the bog-trotter; that if, on a full view of his character, he [s]hould think proper to appoint him, the re[s]pon[s]ibility might lie with him[s]elf. For to be candid, faid the Captain, I [s]hould doubt the expediency of appointing him, in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, to any of the higher offices of government. Such as Secretary of State, or even that of Secretary at War; though, I pre[s]ume, requiring le[s]s talents than the former: The bu[s]ine[s]s of a [s]oldier lying more in the heart than the head. As to Secretary of the Trea[s]ury, [s]hould bar that altogether; as it might be un[s]afe [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-500.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] un[s]afe all at once to tru[s]t him with too much money, until he had given greater proofs of fidelity in this particular, than tho[s]e of his nation and rank are u[s]ually found to po[s][s]e[s]s. The diplomatic line might [s]uit him be[s]t, were it not that the [s]ending him off the continent will put him out of the way of that [s]uperintendence which for [s]ome time I my[s]elf am willing to take of him, until he [s]hall have acquired habits of diligence, and principles of integrity in bu[s]ine[s]s. The Pre[s]ident [s]miled, doubtle[s]s at the idea of the Sans Cullotte (for [s]uch I figuratively call him, becau[s]e he had now got on breeches,) being at all in the way of appointment to [s]uch tru[s]ts; for a thought of the kind had never come into his mind. He was thinking of an office of much le[s]s dignity, and which came nearer to the capacity and grade of ordinary education. It was that of an exci[s]e officer. Having mentioned this, the Captain approved of it, and thanked his excellency, and took his leave. Teague having received his commi[s][s]ion, was elated beyond mea[s]ure, and impatient to fet out to his di[s]trict, in order to enter on the functions of his office. The Captain having purcha[s]ed him a hor[s]e, for he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-501.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] refu[s]ed to bog-trot any longer, the revenue officer took leave of his old ma[s]ter, who had previou[s]ly given him much good advice with regard to duty in office, and promi[s]ed to follow him, as [s]oon as he could provide him[s]elf with another [s]ervant, that he might be on the [s]pot to give him countenance, and a[s][s]i[s]t him occa[s]ionally, with [s]uch farther le[s][s]ons of prudence and morality, as his experience in life might enable him to give, and which it could not be unbecoming in one of his age, however dignified by office, to receive. BOOK [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-502.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] TEAGUE having thus departed, it became the Captain to look out for another [s]ervant; and deliberating on this subject, Mr. M`Donald the Scotch gentleman, of whom we have before [s]poken, happening to enter, the Captain explained to him the circum[s]tance, and made enquiries with regard to his knowledge of any one that cho[s]e to be employed in this way, and might be fit for the [s]ervice. Said Mr. M`Donald, I ken a lad right weel of the name o' Duncan Fergu[s]on, frae about Perth in Scotland, that is tru[s]ty and vera fit to wait upon a gentleman, except it be that he may gie ye o'er muckle trouble about religion, having had a vera [s]trict education i' the pre[s]bytery; gin ye can put up wie that, I fal warrant him hone[s]t, and vera [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-503.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] vera faithful to his ma[s]ter, and that he take guid care of your hor[s]e. He is about thirty years of age, and has been a guid deal in [s]ervice, and knows what it is to wait on guid hou[s]es, in his ain kintra; I dina ken how he may [s]uit all places in the[s]e parts; but wie a man of your judgment, I think he may do vera weel. The Captain thanked him for the information; and having conceived a good opinion of Mr. M`Donald's integrity and [s]en[s]e, he was willing to take the young man upon the recommendation he had given. Accordingly he being [s]ent for by Mr. M`Donald, the North Briton came, and pre[s]ented him[s]elf to the Captain. The wages of his [s]ervice being agreed upon, he entered on his functions the [s]ame day; and in a [s]hort time the Captain having paid his bills in the city, [s]et out with Duncan on the [s]ame rout with Teague. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-504.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] DUNCAN in like manner with Teague had to walk on foot, for the Captain could not afford to purcha[s]e another hor[s]e, more e[s]pecially as he had considerably exhau[s]ted his finances, by the late equipment of Teague. But even could he have made it convenient to have increa[s]ed his cavalry, the expences of travelling would have been increa[s]ed, which he could not al[s]o well afford; or which it would not have been within the limits of a discreet economy to have incurred. For travelling [s]lowly, the [s]ervant could without wearine[s]s equal the pace of his ma[s]ter on hor[s]e-back. Be[s]ides, it gave diver[s]ity, and had more the air of ancient cu[s]tom, than being both mounted. It was in this manner, the Gauls who fought with Cae[s]ar equipped their dragoons, as we learn from the Commentaries; and al[s]o the Numidian hor[s]e under Jugurtha, as we learn from salu[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-505.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] Salu[s]t, had each a foot-man by his [s]ide, who [s]ometimes a[s][s]i[s]ted him[s]elf by the mane of the quardruped in running; but was at all times con[s]idered as attached to the rider, and ready to [s]ub[s]erve him in battle. The Scotchman, moreover, had but a light luggage to carry; being nothing more than a couple of [s]hirts, a pair of [s]tockings, a Kilmarnock cap, a Confe[s][s]ion of Faith, Satan's invi[s]ible kingdom di[s]covered, and Crook[s]hank's hi[s]tory of the Covenanters. It was upon the topic of religion that the conver[s]ation fir[s]t turned, Duncan a[s]king the Captain of what denomination he was. I am denominated Captain, [s]aid he; but my name is John Farrago, though I have had other epithets occa[s]ionally given me by the people among[s]t whom I have happened to [s]ojourn, e[s]pecially [s]ince my la[s]t [s]etting out on my travels, after the manner of the antient chevaliers. I have been called the modern Don Quixotte, on account of the eccentricity of my rambles, or the singularity which they conceive them[s]elves to di[s]cover in my conver[s]ation and manner. I have been called the Knight of the [s]ingle Hor[s]e, having but one my[s]elf, and none for my attendant; in this particular unlike my predece[s][s]ors, who[s]e [s]quires were mounted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-506.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] mounted as well as them[s]elves. In [s]ome places I have taken my de[s]ignation from the Iri[s]h valet that I had, and of whom you have heard me [s]peak, of the name of Teague, and have been called the Owner of the red-headed Bog-trotter; as it is probable I may now be de[s]igned occa[s]ionally by the appellation of the Ma[s]ter of the raw Scotchman, by tho[s]e who may be able by your dialect to di[s]lingui[s]h your origin. But all the[s]e things I look upon as incon[s]iderable. It is of little, or perhaps of no con[s]equence to me, what my [s]tile is among[s]t men; provided it contains nothing in it that may impeach my moral character, and may [s]eem to have been drawn from [s]ome bad quality or vicious habit of the intellect. They may call me Don Quixotte, or Hudibras, or the Knight of the Blue Beard, or the Long No[s]e, or what they plea[s]e. It is all the fame to me; and gives no affront, unle[s]s containing a reflection on my under[s]tanding or integrity. Captain, [s]aid Duncan, it canna be, but ye ken right weel what I mean. It is na the denomination o' your temporal capacity, that I wad be at; but of your religion, and to what per[s]wa[s]ion ye belong; er [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-507.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] whether o' the Covenant, or of the Seceders, or the high kirk o' Scotland. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, I am not [s]uch an adept in faith, as to be acquainted with the[s]e nice di[s]tinctions. I have [s]ome knowledge of the Chri[s]tian religion in general, but not of tho[s]e more minute [s]ubdivi[s]ions of which it is probable you [s]peak. For I have under[s]tood that Chri[s]tianity is the national religion in Scotland, and I pre[s]ume what you call Covenanters, and Seceders, are [s]ections from the general e[s]tabli[s]hment, and [s]ubordinate to the wor[s]hip of the kingdom. It has not come in my way, nor have I much ambition to be more particularly acquainted. There is a degree of information on mo[s]t [s]ubjects which it becomes a gentleman to have; but the going beyond this may favour of pednatry, and argue the having [s]pent more time in trifles, than be[s]peaks [s]trength of mind and elevated talents. Ju[s]t as we re[s]pect the naturali[s]t who amu[s]es us with the philo[s]ophy of great objects; but [s]mile at him who[s]e life is occupied in catching butterflies, or gathering petrified [s]hell-fi[s]h. Or to give a [s]imile that conveys my meaning better; [s]kill in language, either to write or [s]peak, is a noble attainment; but this con[s]i[s]ts more in a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-508.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] a ju[s]t ta[s]te of the leading beauties, than in the critici[s]ms of a mere grammarian, which [s]hew the mind to have been wholly or chiefly taken up with the[s]e: To u[s]e the words of the poet, Word-catchers that live on [s]yllables. Commas and points they [s]et exactly right, And 'twere a fin, to rob them of their might. The mo[s]t liberal [s]tudies may be pur[s]ued to an illiberal exce[s]s; as for in[s]tance in mu[s]ic, where it mu[s]t be con[s]idered as an elegant accompli[s]hment to have [s]ome talents; yet not to have made [s]uch proficiency in the execution, as to induce a [s]u[s]picion of attention to this art, to the neglect of others. I have taken care to acquire a general knowledge of the [s]urface of this earth, from the maps; yet have not made my[s]elf ma[s]ter of the [s]ituation of every [s]lough, or bog that may be found in your country, or exact bearing of hill or mountain there. In the [s]ame manner, I may know that you are Chri[s]tians in that i[s]land, but nothing more. What, man! [s]aid Duncan, ha' ye never heard o' the Solemn League and Covenanr. I have heard, [s]aid the Captain, of many Leagues and Covenants. In the time of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-509.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] of Henry IV. in France there was what was called the League. The family of Gui[s]e was at the head of this, and oppo[s]ed to the Prote[s]tants. It is probably a branch of this that has come over into Scotland, and kept up the name, after having been broken by that heroic Prince, and afterwards taken away altogether, by his conversion to the mother church, and peaceable po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the kingdom. By that, ye wad make out the Covenanters to be a relict of Popery, [s]aid Duncan. I ken ye right weel, Captain; ye canna be [s]ae ignorant as not to know that the Covenanters are the very rever[s]e o' Popery. Did ye never read Crook[s]hanks? Did ye never hear o' the per[s]ecution. I have heard of the ten per[s]ecution under the Roman Emperors, [s]aid the Captain. Under ten Deevils, faid Duncan. I am [s]peaking o' the per[s]ecutions in Scotland; when the mini[s]ters were hanged at Ayr. The Captain [s]aw that his valet was beginning to be warm on the [s]core of religion; and that it would be difficult to continue the conver[s]ation in any [s]hape without giving him offence. He was therefore disposed to addre[s]s his pride, and plea[s]e him by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-510.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] by an acknowledgement of ignorance; at the [s]ame time propo[s]ing a readine[s]s to be in[s]tructed in the peculiar tenets of the faith of the Covenanters. Duncan, [s]aid he, you are under a mistake as to the opportunities of education in this country. It is not as in Scotland, where the Chri[s]tian religion has been planted above a thou[s]and years, and the reformed church e[s]tabli[s]hed a century or two; where clergymen are numerous, and religious books plenty. Ay, [s]aid Duncan, where ye have preaching amai[s]t every day of the week, and twice on the Sabbath. Ye canna [s]et your face any way, but ye hae a kirk before you. Catechizing o' the children begins amai[s]t as [s]oon as they are born; and examining the grown people, in vi[s]its at the hou[s]e; wie a [s]trict di[s]cipline, that calls to the [s]e[s][s]ion for things that scandalize the morals. Ye [s]al find many guid bukes there publi[s]hed by the Er[s]kines, and the Gilli[s]es. Did ye e'er read Peden's Prophe[s]ies? I have read nothing of this kind, [s]aid the Captain; for I was observing to you, that in America we have not the[s]e opportunities. For my own part, I have lived a good deal in the rout of clerical functionaries, where they have pa[s][s]ed and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-511.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] and repa[s][s]ed, and have heard their sermons, and conver[s]ed with them; and though they may have been di[s]tingui[s]hed among[s]t them[s]elves as orthodox or heterodox; or under [s]everal names, or by various particulars of doctrine; yet the differences appeared to me [s]o minute, that I never thought it worth while to trace them; and they made them[s]elves acceptable to me, le[s]s or more, by the greater harmony of voice, or elegance of language, or ge[s]ture; or by the ju[s]tn[s]es of their observations on the obligations of morality amongst men, and the good con[s]equences to [s]ociety and to the individual.---Have ye read Willi[s]on on the Catechi[s]m, or Halyburton, or Bo[s]ton's Fourfo d State, or Durham on the Revelation? [s]aid Duncan. Nothing of all the[s]e, [s]aid the Captain. Said Duncan, I ha' got the Confe[s][s]ion of Faith in my wallet here; I wad lend it to you to get a piece of it by heart, if ye wad promise to take guid care o' the buke. My memory is not good, [s]aid the Captain, especially in that artificial exerci[s]e of it, which con[s]i[s]ts in committing ab[s]tract ideas. What touches my affections, I remember without trouble, and [s]entiments which are obvious and natural; and I [s]hould think the early mind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-512.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] mind would be better occupied in reading [s]ome in[s]tructive fables, than in committing the[s]e dogmas of divinity, that are untelligible to any but theologi[s]ts them[s]elves; nay not even by them incontrovertibly; for otherwi[s]e how [s]hould they differ [s]o much in their illu[s]trations of them. However, I have no inclination to be led into a debate with you, Duncan, on a [s]ubject where you are [s]o much my [s]uperior. But you will excu[s]e me in committing the Confession of Faith to memory; at my age it is painful to apply to a thing as to a ta[s]k. Duncan acknowledged the truth of this, and was di[s]po[s]ed to excu[s]e him; but recommended him to read the [s]ermons of the reverend John Dick, and Saunders M`Alpin. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-513.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] Having travelled this day without any remarkable occurence, and puting up at an inn in the evening, Duncan had taken care of the hor[s]e, in having him well rubbed down, and having [s]een his oats given him, and the rack well filled with hay. A gentlemen had al[s]o that evening put up at the inn, and who[s]e [s]ervant had been engaged at the [s]ame time with Duncan, in taking care of his re[s]pective ma[s]ter's hor[s]e. This valet, whether from reading Thomas Paine's Age of Rea[s]on, which had been publi[s]hed about this time, or to the sceptical conver[s]ation of [s]ome one in his way, was far from being orthodox in his notions of religion; or rather was [s]ceptical with regard to religion altogether; and had not been accu[s]tomed to the [s]tricte[s]t propriety in the choice of his expre[s][s]ions; which became apparent, in a [s]hort time, from his u[s]e of [s]uppletives that are common with pro- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-514.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] profane men, when they would enforce what they have a[s][s]erted; or when prompted by pa[s][s]ion, they are carried beyond the bounds of decorum, in imprecations on them[s]elves or the incidental cau[s]e of their injury. Whether the hor[s]e had not maintained a proper po[s]ition in currying him, or that the valet thought he did not, is uncertain; but [s]o it was, that in the cour[s]e of his labour he broke out into occa[s]ional [s]allies of ill humour; or perhaps, from mere habit, and without any cau[s]e at all, he began to damn the [s]oul of the bea[s]t. Duncan could not avoid taking notice of it, and reprimanding him for his profanity. The other gave him no other thanks than to damn his [s]oul al[s]o; which language began to rai[s]e the blood of Duncan; but he repressed his re[s]entment for the pre[s]ent, and was [s]ilent until they both came to [s]it down to [s]upper in the kitchen of the public hou[s]e, the gentlemen above having already [s]upped; when Roderick, for that was the name of the valet, began to eat, not having fir[s]t [s]aid grace. At this Duncan lo[s]ing all patience, broke out upon him. Sirrah, [s]aid he, I could make an excu[s]e for your damning the [s]oul o' your bea[s]t; becau[s]e I dinna believe he has a [s]oul, and in that cafe [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-515.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] ca[s]e ye were doing nothing mare than making u[s]e o' a bad expre[s][s]ion; but ha' ye na mare decency, than to fall to your meat without a[s]king a ble[s][s]ing on what is [s]et before you; more than your hor[s]e i' the stable, when he falls to his oats? what could ye expect frae a dumb bea[s]t? but with ane o' the [s]hape o' a Chri[s]tian creature, it favours o' infidelity. Ha' ye na [s]en[s]e o' religion? Did ye never [s]ee the Confe[s][s]ion o' Faith; or the Larger or Shorter Catechism? Are ye na afraid, the devil will get power o'er you, and make ye hang your[s]el. Hang the devil, [s]aid Roderick. I am not afraid of the devil; I could kick him, and cuff him, and play hell with him. Guid deliver us! what bla[s]phemy, [s]aid Duncan; I am afraid young man, ye may get a trial o't, you'l [s]ee then wha o' ye will be uppermo[s]t. I'll lay my lug for it, ye dinna [s]tand him twa [s]hakes, for a [s]ae [s]tout as ye are. Ye had better [s]eek the Lord, and be out o' the reach o' Satan. I never [s]aw any greater devil than myself, [s]aid Roderick; nor do I believe there is any, I wi[s]h I [s]aw this Satan of yours; I would take a knock with him; I would bite, and gouge him, and,--- This he [s]aid jumping to his feet, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-516.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] stretching out his hands towards Duncan, and grinning at the [s]ame time. Duncan could [s]u[s]tain it no longer, but making his e[s]cape from the kitchen, ran to the chamber where the Captain was with the gentlemen, taking a gla[s]s after [s]upper: Exclaiming with great vehemence, he gave them to under[s]tand that the muckle deel him[s]el was in the hou[s]e below [s]tairs. I did na ju[s]t [s]ee his horns, and his cloven foot, [s]aid he; but I ken him right weel by his way o' talking, when he was i' the [s]table wie the gentleman's hor[s]e, rubbing him down, he cur[s]ed, and [s]wear'd like a devil; and when he came to [s]ipper, he could na bide the ble[s][s]ing, but when I [s]pake o' grace, he brake out into profane language; and at la[s]t fairly acknowledged that he was the deel him[s]el. Guid guide us, that we [s]hould hae the devil among us! I wad na be a[s]toni[s]hed if he has the kitchen aff in a flame o' fire, before we gae to bed yet. I hae Satan's invi[s]ible kingdom di[s]covered wi' me, in my bags. It gies great account o' the[s]ethings. The like happened at Drumalawrig ance before; and the guid folk had a great deal o' wark to get the muckle thief out o' their [s]ight again. The Captain and gentleman were at a lo[s]s to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-517.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] to under[s]tand this rhap[s]ody; and could only in general collect from it, that he conceived him[s]elf to have [s]een the devil. Where is this devil? [s]aid the Captain. Can ye [s]hew him to us, Duncan? I can [s]oon do that, [s]aid Duncan. I left him i' the kitchen at his meat; but I trow he does na eat muckle. It is a' a pretence, to pa[s]s for one o' us. But gin ye [s]ing a p[s]alm, or pronounce a ver[s]e o' the Bible, or gae about prayer, I [s]all warrant ye [s]all [s]oon [s]ee him in his proper figure, wi' his horns and his cloven foot girnning at ye, ju[s]t as he had come out o' hell about an hour ago. Let us [s]ee him, Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, and examine into the[s]e circumstances. The Captain and the gentleman had [s]uppo[s]ed that [s]ome wag, among[s]t the servants of the public hou[s]e, had been attempting to amu[s]e him[s]elf with the credulity of Duncan, having di[s]covered him to be of a [s]uper[s]titious ca[s]t of mind; and that with [s]ome kind of vizor to the face, and uncouth dre[s]s to the per[s]on, he had assumed a frightful form, and impo[s]ed upon him the idea of a demon. Under this impression they went forward, Duncan with fear and trembling, lurking behind, and ing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-518.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] eyeing carefully the [s]cene as they approached. Entering the kitchen, Duncan started, and exclaimed, The Lord deliver us! there he is, eating at his meat, as if he was a creature above ground, though ye may all [s]ee that he has the phy[s]iognomy of Belzebub. Of whom do you [s]peak, [s]aid the Captain? of that muckle chiel there, [s]aid Duncan, i' the blue jacket, and the lang breeks;---(it was a pair of overalls);--- that Satan-luking fallow, continued he, wha puts the bread in his mouth, and [s]its wi' his back[s]ide on a [s]tool, as if he were ane o' our[s]els; and had na been i' the bottomle[s]s pit the[s]e twelve months. But gin ye [s]peak till him, I [s]all warrant ye [s]al [s]oon hear him talk the dialect of hell, and cur[s]e and [s]wear like a fiend, and girn like the deel him[s]el; and [s]hew his cloven foot very [s]oon, tak my word for't. Why that is my [s]ervant, [s]aid the gentleman. Ay, ay, [s]aid Duncan, I dinna doubt that; he may hae pa[s][s]ed him[s]el for your [s]ervant. But that does na hinder him to be the de'el. Dinna ye hear what the apostle [s]ays, "he can transform him[s]elf into an angel o' light." It canna be a great trouble then to take the [s]hape o' a waiting man, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-519.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] man, and [s]it before a pair o' [s]addle bags. If ye read Satan's invi[s]ible kingdom discovered, which I hae in my portmantles, ye [s]al find that the devil can make him[s]elf a mini[s]ter, and gae into the pulpit, and conduct him[s]elf very weel, aye'till it comes to the prayer, and then off he gaes thro' the window, or takes the gavel o' the hou[s]e wie him. It happened once at Linlithgo, that he tuke the [s]hape o' a guid auld man, the reverend doctor Bunnetin, and undertook to preach the action [s]ermon at a [s]acrament; but gaed awa in a flight o' fire, ju[s]t as he came to gie out the text. Ah, [s]irrah, [s]aid he, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf to Roderick, are ye there yet? ye think because the folk here in America dinna ken ye, no ha'ing Satan's invi[s]ible world discovered among their printed bukes, that for that rea[s]on, I wad na ken ye. I ken ye weel enough, auld Reeky. Gae back, to Scotland, and take the [s]hape o' muckle dogs there, whare there are guid foks that dinna [s]ear ye; and no come o'er the burn till America, where the go[s]pel is na yet planted, and there is na need for ye. What have you been doing to this man, [s]aid the gentleman to Roderick, that he has conceived you to be the devil. No. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-520.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] Nothing more [s]aid the valet, than that when we [s]at down to eat he in[s]i[s]ted on [s]aying prayers fir[s]t, and talked like a fool about religion. I was hungry, and did not like to wait for prayers. He talked about the deel. I told him I was the devil my[s]elf. He took me to be in earne[s]t, I [s]uppo[s]e; that is all. Aye, and ye are the deel, [s]aid Duncan. Put out your foot here, and let us [s]ee if it hae a cloven place i' the middle o't, or be like a chri[s]tian's foot; or try if ye can [s]tand till I [s]ay the Lord's prayer; though I wad na wi[s]h to [s]ay it, as I dinna ken but ye wad take the man's hou[s]e wi' ye, and leave the Captain, and this gentleman without a chamber to gae to bed in. P[s]haDuncan, [s]aid the Captain; how can [s]uch ideas come into your brain? I [s]ee nothing, but the gentleman's [s]ervant. It is the prejudice of your education, to [s]uppo[s]e that the devil can take the [s]hape of men, or tangible substance; at lea[s]t that he can eat food, and conver[s]e with a human voice, You will come by and bye to have a better [s]en[s]e of things. In the mean time we mu[s]t excu[s]e your revereis, as you are but a late emigrant. This valet may be indi[s]creet, or as you would [s]ay, profane, in his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-521.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] expressions; a thing of which I will venture to [s]ay this gentleman, who[s]e waiting man he is, does by no means approve. Nevertheless, I cannot think he is Apolyon, or Belzebub, or Satan, or the great arch devil of the infernal regions I do not even believe that he is one of your inferior devils, that has a[s][s]umed the [s]hape and function of a valet, and has [s]at down here to eat his [s]upper in the kitchen. I am not one one of tho[s]e, [s]aid the gentleman, that approve of profane language, or the undervaluing the religious ceremonies of a con[s]cientious, though weak man; but it would appear to me that this is but an affair of humour on the part of my valet, who by the by is but hired with me as a waiting man, and I have no controul over him, farther than to di[s]mi[s]s him for improper conduct. He is a merry fellow; but I have always found him faithful, and of good temper; [s]o that I will venture to [s]ay, that if Duncan, for that I under[s]tand is the name of this North Briton, will take [s]upper, and go to bed with him, he will receive no injury whatever. I wad na take the whole town o' Perth, to [s]it down wie him, [s]aid Duncan; nor a' the kingdom of Scotland to [s]leep wie him ae [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-522.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] ae night. I [s]hould expect nothing el[s]e but to be i' the lake o' brim[s]tane before the morning. I will be damn'd [s]aid Roderick, if I do you any damage. I am no devil more than your[s]elf. It was to get quit of your long prayers before victuals, that led me to talk as I have done. Do you hear him, [s]aid Duncan? would any body but the deel, acknowledge himself willing to be dam'd, or talk about it in [s]ae light a manner. He confirms by ae breath, what he denies by the other. He is the deel, as [s]ure as ever Mitchel Scot was in Scotland, or if he is na the deel; he is as bad as the deel, and it gaes again[s]t the grain wi' me to hae ony communication wi' him. Let him gae to hell for me by himself. He [s]al not hae my company. I wad na tru[s]t but that he wad hae an hundred witches here about the hou[s]e, before the morning, and put every one o' us on a broom[s]tick to ride along wi' him, taking the taps aff the trees, and dinging floon hou[s]es, as he gaes along; the auld woman turning them[s]elves into cats, as they like, or taking the [s]hapes o' hares, or [s]oomin o'er rivers in their egg-[s]hells. The Captain finding that it was in vain to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-523.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] to attempt by direct means to overcome the force of prejudice, changed his language, and affected to [s]uppo[s]e that the valet might be the devil, and propo[s]ed to examine the extremity of both limbs, to [s]ee whether he had a cloven foot. The valet, [s]ummitting to the je[s]t, agreed to be examined. His boots and [s]tockings therefore being stripped off, his feet were examined, and no sissure appeared more than in a common foot. Now, [s]aid the Captain, if he can [s]tand the recital of a prayer, will you not acknowledge that he may be a human person. Ay, if 'twere a mini[s]ter, [s]aid Duncan; but I dinna ken, if the prayer o' a layman, can affect him much. But it does na matter muckle, whether he is the devil or not; he is amai[s]t as bad as the devil, as you may di[s]tingui[s]h by his conver[s]ation, and I dinna care to ha muckle more to do wie him. That is, devil or no devil, [s]aid the Captain, you will neither eat nor [s]leep with him. Ju[s]t the [s]hort and the lang o' it, [s]aid Duncan. I will take a bit o' bread and beef in my hand, and creep into [s]ome nuke by my[s]el, if it [s]hould be i' the [s]table with the hor[s]es, rather than wie this wicked crea [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-524.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] creature, that if he is not Satan, has a great re[s]emblance o' him. With this the Captain and the gentlemen, left them to them[s]elves, and returned to the chamber. IN the morning it appeared that Duncan had [s]at up the greater part of the night, with a candle burning by him in the kitchen, until near day-light; when overcome with [s]leep he had reclined upon a bench, until the gentleman and his valet had departed, and the Captain had got up, which was about an hour after sunrise. Having breakfa[s]ted, which was about 9 o'clock, they [s]et out upon their travels, conver[s]ing as they went along upon [s]ubjects that occurred. The fir[s]t topic was a compari[s]on of Scotland with this country; in what particulars each had the advantage of the other. Duncan gave a decided preference in all things to the trans-Atlantic region; and found nothing on this con [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-525.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] continent that could encounter the smallest competition. I [s]hould pre[s]ume, [s]aid the Captain, we have more timber in this country than in yours. You may have more, but not half [s]ae guid, [s]aid Duncan. Our fir, is far better than the oak that ye find here. I will allow you the advantage in one particular, [s]aid the Captain; you are more clo[s]ely [s]ettled, and the [s]oil of cour[s]e mu[s]t be under a more general cultivation. Aye, but that is nathing, [s]aid Duncan; it is [s]ettled wi' a better [s]tock o' people; and we hae dukes and lairds amang us; no as it is here, where ye may gae a day's journey, and no hear of a piper at a great hou[s]e, or [s]ee a castle; but a' the folks, and their habitations, luking ju[s]t for a' the warld like our cotters in Scotland. But, [s]aid the Captain, what do you think of the works of nature here, the [s]un and moon for instance? The [s]un is a very guid [s]un, [s]aid Duncan; but he has o'er muckle heat in the middle of the day. I wad like him better if he wad draw in a little of it at this [s]ea[s]on, and let it out i' the winter, when we [s]al hae more need o' it. But as to the moon, Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, you have [s]een it [s]ince you came in; do you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-526.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] you think it is as large as the moon in Scotland? I dinna ken, quoth Duncan, but it is amai[s]t as large; but it changes far aftener, and it is no [s]ae lang at the full as it is in our kintry. But what think you of the [s]tars, Duncan; you have taken notice of them, I pre[s]ume, in this hemisphere. The [s]tars dinna differ muckle frae the [s]tars at hame, quoth Duncan; [s]ave that there are not [s]ae many o' them. Wi' us, the firmament is a' clad wi' them, like bra[s]s buttons; they light it up ju[s]t like candles. But here they luke blaite, and hae a watery appearance in the night, as if they had got the fever and ague o' the climate, and were [s]ickly, and had na [s]trength to put forth their fire. I tell you, captain, there is nothing here equal to what it is in Scotland. How could you expect it; this is but a young kintra. It will be a lang time before it comes to [s]ik perfection as wi' us; and I dinna ken if it ever does. How comes it to pa[s]s, Duncan, [s]aid the Captain that the devil chu[s]es the women of your country, in preference to any other, to make witches of? For it would [s]eem to be the ca[s]e; as I have heard more of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-527.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] of Scotch witches, than of Engli[s]h or American. I can gie ye a good rea[s]on for that, [s]aid Duncan. The deel kens weel enough where to find out the be[s]t materials. The Engli[s]h women are no worth making witches of; they could do him little guid when he had them. Ane Scotch witch is worth a dozen Engli[s]h, or American. They can loup farther, and [s]ink a [s]hip in half the time. The Captain having made this experiment of the national partiality of Duncan, was [s]atisfied; and turned the conver[s]ation to another [s]ubject. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-528.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] I Shall not [s]top to record the minute incidents that took place in the cour[s]e of this day's travel; or that of the two following days; or relate the particulars of the conver[s]ation of the Captain with Duncan, or of Duncan with any other per[s]on. What I have related, was chiefly with a view to give [s]ome idea of the new valet's character and manners. I think it was the fourth day after leaving the city, that the Captain ca[s]ting up his eyes at a place where there was a considerable length of [s]traightroad before him, [s]aw a per[s]on trudging on foot, who by his make and gait, appeared to him to resemthe new revenue officer, the quondam bogtrotter. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, if that man was not on foot, that is before us, I [s]hould take him for Teague O'Regan, the waiting man that was in my [s]ervice, and who gave place to you; having obtained a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-529.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] a commi[s][s]ion in the revenue, and become an exci[s]e officer. But as I had equipped him with a hor[s]e, it is not probable that he could be without one already, and have taken to his trotters, after being advanced to be a limb of the government. It would be a degradation to the dignity of office. I dinna think, quoth Duncan, there is muckle dignity in the office. What is he but a gauger? that is of na more e[s]timation in our kintra than a hangman. There is na ane that can live in an hone[s]t way without it, will take the commi[s][s]ion. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, it is not [s]o in this country, where the government is a republic; and all taxes being laid by people, the collection of every [s]pecies is a [s]acred duty, and equally honourable. Honour! quoth Duncan. Do you talk of honour in a gauger? If that be the way of thinking in this kintra, I wi[s]h it were back in Scotland. Every thing [s]eems to be or[s]a ver[s]a here; the wrang [s]ide uppermost. I am but a [s]imple waiting man to a gentlemen like your[s]el, and I wad na take the office o' gauger upon me, for a' Philadelphia, which is amai[s]t as big as Perth. By this time they were within a [s]mall dif [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-530.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] di[s]tance of the traveller, whom the Captain reconnoitering more perfectly, discovered ab[s]olutely to be Teague. The revenue officer, turning round, he recognized the Captain, and acco[s]ted him: "By my [s]houl, and there he is, his honour himself; the Captain, and a new [s]harvant that he has trotting on foot, as I my[s]elf u[s]ed to do." And as you [s]eem to do yet, Teague, [s]aid the Captain. What is become of the hor[s]e I furni[s]hed you? Has he been [s]tolen, or has he [s]trayed away from [s]ome pa[s]ture in the cour[s]e of your progre[s]s? By my [s]houl, [s]aid the officer, neither the one nor the oder of de[s]e happened; but I met wid a good affer on de road, and I took it. I [s]waped him for a watch dat I have in my pocket here. Ble[s]s de [s]weet little [s]houl of it: It tells de hour of de day, and what time of de clock it is, [s]lapeing or waking; and in de night time you have but ju[s]t to look at the face of it, and de [s]weet pretty figures dat are dare, and you will know how long it is before the morning come. Not like de dumb bea[s]t, that could not an[s]wer you a word in the night nor in the day; but hold his tongue like a [s]hape, and [s]ay nothing; while dis little watch, as de call it, can [s]peak like a Chri[s]tian creature, and keep [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-531.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] keep company along de road like a living per[s]on. It was for dat rea[s]on dat I took it from a country man dat I met wid la[s]t night at the tavern; and am now going on by my[s]elf, and have no hor[s]e to take care of, and plague me on de road, and give me falls over his tail, and over his mane, up hill and down hill, [s]o dat I almo[s]t broke my neck, and thought it [s]afe[s]t to ride upon my foot. Dat is truth, ma[s]ter Captain. But who is dis [s]on of a whore dat you have wid you trotting in my place? Does he take good care of your creature at night, and clean your boots. I would be after bidding him [s]mell dis cudgel here dat I walk wid, if he neglect a good ma[s]ter, as your honour is. The blood of Duncan was up at the idea of being cudgelled by an exci[s]e officer; and [s]tepping up to Teague he lifted a cudgel on his part. "Ye cudgel me, [s]irrah! [s]aid the Caledonian. If it was na for his honour's pre[s]ence, I wad lay this rung on your hurdies; or gie ye a rap upon the crown; to talk [s]ik language to your betters. I [s]hould make ye ken what it is to rai[s]e the blood of a Scotchman. You ca' your[s]elf a revenue officer. But what is that but a guager? which is the next to a hang [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-532.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] hangman in our kintra. Captain, will ye [s]tand by and [s]ee fair play, till I gie him his paikes for his impertinence. My lug for it, I [s]al make this rung rattle about the bones o' his head to [s]ome tune. With that Duncan was making his advance, having rai[s]ed his cudgel, and puting him[s]elf in the attitude of a per[s]on accustomed to the back [s]word; which Teague on the other hand ob[s]erving, acco[s]ted him with [s]ofter words; not di[s]po[s]ed to ri[s]k an engagement with an unknown adversary. Love your [s]houl, [s]aid he, if I was after affronting you more than his honour my ma[s]ter; burn me, if I don't love you, ju[s]t becau[s]e you are my ma[s]ter's [s]harvant, and takes care of his ba[s]te. I was only jokeing. It is ju[s]t the way I would [s]pake to my own dear cou[s]in Dermot, if he were here; for in Ireland we always [s]pake backwards. Put up your [s]tick, dear honey, I am [s]ure the Captain knows that I was always good-natured, and not given to quarrels; though I could fight a good [s]tick too upon a pinch; but it never came into my head to wrangle with my ma[s]ter's [s]harvant, e[s]pecially [s]uch a tight good looking fellow as your[s]helf, dat has a good [s]helalah in your hand [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-533.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] hand, and is fitter to beat than to be beaten, by [s]haint Patrick. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, you have heard the explanation of the ha[s]ty words the revenue officer at fir[s]t u[s]ed; and it would [s]eem to me, that, con[s]i[s]tently with the reputation of courage, and good breeding both, you ought to be [s]atisfied. I dinna ken, quoth Duncan; it was a vera great provocation to talk o' cudgeling; and it may be the cu[s]tom o' a friendly [s]alutation in Ireland, but no in our kintra. While I ha a drop o' the blood o' St. Andrew in me, I wad na gae up to [s]ik civilities. Said the Captain, as far as I can have under[s]tood, St. Patrick and St. Andrew were cou[s]ins, and you his de[s]cendants or di[s]ciples ought to be on terms of amity. St. Andrew a cou[s]in to St. Patrick! [s]aid Duncan. I canna acknowledge that, Captain. St. Andrew was a guid Protestant, and a Covenanter, but St. Patrick was a Papi[s]t, o' the kirk o' Rome; and did na keep the [s]econd commandment, but wor[s]hipped graven images, and pictures o' [s]aints; and tuke the [s]acrament wie a wafer. I [s]hall never gie up that, Captain, that St. Patrick was o' kin to St. Andrew. They [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-534.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] They might be i' the mini[s]try at the [s]ame time; but there is a great difference in their doctrine. Did ye e'er ready any o' the works o' John Knox, Captain? Dinna ye ken, that the church of Rome is the whore o' Babylon? If ye had lived in the time o' the per[s]ecution, ye wad na hae compared a Scotch [s]aint wie a Iri[s]h prie[s]t. Said the Captain, I have no particular acquaintance with the di[s]tingui[s]hing renets of the two Evangeli[s]ts; nor do I know any thing of them, [s]ave ju[s]t to have understood that the one had planted Chri[s]tianity in Scotland and the other in Ireland. But this is not a point [s]o material to us individually, as that we cultivate peace, and have no difference. I mu[s]t therefore enjoin it on you, Duncan, that you drop your [s]tick, and keep the peace towards the revenue officer on the high way, that he may not be delayed in going forward to enter on the functions of his office. Said Duncan, Since your honour [s]ays the word, I [s]hall lay down my [s]tick; for I ken the law better than to [s]tand out again[s]t the civil authority. But Teague, [s]aid the Captain, how can you di[s]tingui[s]h the figures of your watch, [s]o as to tell the hours of the day; you that do [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-535.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] do not under[s]tand figures? By my [s]houl, [s]aid Teague, and I never tought of dat. Will not the figures [s]pake for dem[s]elves, when I look at dem. I am [s]ure, I [s]aw the [s]on of a whore dat I got her from, look at her, and tell the hour o' de day, like a pracher at his books; and I am [s]ure and certain, dat [s]uch an ill-luking teef as he was, could neither read nor write. But by my [s]houl, if dat is de way, dat I have to read de marks my[s]elf, I will [s]wap her back for a hor[s]e or a cow, on de road; or for [s]omething el[s]e, dat will pla[s]e your honour better; [s]o dere is no harm done, pla[s]e your honour, while we are in a chri[s]tian country, and can meet wad good paple to [s]pake to, and take a watch or a colt off our hands, when we mane to part wid it, pla[s]e your honour. Such was the conver[s]ation at the fir[s]t interview of the Captain's family, to u[s]e a military [s]tile; and may be con[s]idered as a [s]ample of that which took place in the [s]equel of this day's travel, as they proceeded together until noon; when they came to dine at a public hou[s]e, and umbrage was taken by Duncan, becau[s]e the Captain had permitted Teague to [s]it at table with him[s]elf; which he did in re[s]pect to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-536.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] to the office which he held, and in order to [s]upport its dignity. Captain, [s]aid Duncan, coming to the hall door, and looking in, d'ye permit an exci[s]e officer to [s]it at the table wie your honour. For [s]ik profanation I never heard o' in a' my born days; if it were in Scotland, it wad cau[s]e a [s]ight to the whole neighbourhood. Does your honour ken that he is an exci[s]e officer? Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, it is a principle of good citizen[s]hip, e[s]pecially in a republican government, to pay re[s]pect to the laws, and maintain the honour of its officers. It is for this rea[s]on, that I make it a point to honour one who was lately my bog-trotter; not that I discern in him any remarkable improvement in talents or manners; but [s]imply because the government has di[s]covered something; and has [s]een fit to give him a commission in the revenue. Who knows but it may be your own fortune, at no di[s]tant day to obtain an office, and will you not think it rea[s]onable then, that it [s]hould be forgotten that you were once in the capacity of a waiting man; and that you [s]hould receive the re[s]pect and the precedence due to your new dignity? it is not with us as in monarchies, where the advance is dual [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-537.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] gradual in mo[s]t ca[s]es; though even there, an individual through the favour of the prince, or of the queen, or of a lady or gentleman of the court, may have a sudden promotion: but in a free [s]tate, what hinders that the lowe[s]t of the people [s]hould be taken up, and made magi[s]trates, or put into commi[s][s]ions in the revenue? I mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t, Duncan, that you retire to the kitchen, and take your dinner, and make no di[s]turbance in the hou[s]e at this time; you will come to under[s]tand better the nature of offices in the[s]e commonwealths in due time. Duncan retired; but in soliloquy expre[s][s]ing his chagrin, at the [s]trange rever[s]ion of affairs in America, from what they were in Scotland; and his mortification at finding him[s]elf in the [s]ervice of a ma[s]ter, that could degrade him[s]elf by dining with an exci[s]e officer. Teague, on the other hand, though he was [s]ilent in the hearing of Duncan, broke out as [s]oon as he had [s]hut the door; Captain, [s]aid he, pla[s]e your honour, where did you pick up dat teef-luking [s]on o'd a whore, dat has no more manners, dan a [s]hape-[s]tealer in Ireland; or a merchant dat [s]ells yarn at a fair. By [s]aint Patrick, if your honour had given me leave in de road [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-538.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] road, I would have knocked his teet down his troat; and if your honour will excu[s]e de table, I will go out and take him by de troat, and make him talk to him[s]elf like a frog in de wet [s]wamps; de [s]on of a whore, to [s]pake to your honour wid a brogue upon his tongue, in [s]uch words as defe. By the brogue, Teague meant the Scottish dialect, which Duncan u[s]ed. Teague, [s]aid the Captain, the prejudices of education mu[s]t be tolerated, until time and experience of the world, has le[s][s]ened or removed them. He is an honest fellow, and I have more confidence in him, than I ever had in you, though his talents have not appeared equal; at lea[s]t if I am to judge from the e[s]timate made of you, by the[s]e who have a better right to judge than I have. However, I am unwilling to have any di[s]turbance between you, and therefore, mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t that you leave him to the reprimands which I myself have occa[s]ionally given him, and [s]hall continue to give him, until he attains a better knowledge of the nature of things in this new hemi[s]phere, [s]o different from tho[s]e to which he has been accu[s]tomed. This put an end to any altercation tween [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-539.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] between the two, the revenue officer and the waiting man, for the remaining part of that day, as they trudged together, until they came to the inn at night, and having [s]upped, were about to go to bed. It was what in [s]ome places is called an Ordinary; that is, an indifferent tavern, of but mean accommodations. The hou[s]e was [s]mall, and there was but two beds for the reception of [s]trangers; one of the[s]e [s]o indifferent, as to appear fit only for the servant of a gentleman, who might happen to travel the road, though large enough to contain two, or three per[s]ons. What it wanted in quality of neatne[s]s, and perhaps cleanline[s]s, was made up in dimen[s]ions. This bed therefore [s]eemed naturally to invite the reception of two of the company. Teague, [s]aid the Captain, when about to go to bed, I think Duncan and you, being the younger men, may pig in together in that large bed, and leave the other to me who am an older man, and am apt to tumble and to[s]s a little, from wearine[s]s in my ride; and may perhaps di[s]turb you in your [s]leep. Guid deliver me, [s]aid Duncan, frae [s]ik a profanation o' the name o' Ferguson, as to [s]leep wi' an exci[s]e officer. I am [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-540.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] am na o' a great family, but I am come o' a guid family; and it [s]hall never be [s]aid that I came to America to di[s]grace my lineage, by [s]ik contact as that. Gae to bed wi' an exci[s]e officer! I wad [s]ooner gae to bed out o' doors; or i' the [s]table amang the hor[s]es. The revenue officer was affronted at this; and gave way to his indignation. The devil burn me, [s]aid he, if I will be after [s]lapeing wid you, you [s]on of a whore, you teef luking vagabon; wid de itch upon your back; I am [s]ure all your country has de itch; and keep [s]cratching and [s]cratching, as if de ware in hell, and could get brim[s]tone for noting; you [s]on o'd a whore. The youke! [s]aid Duncan. Do you impeach me wi' the youke? You impatche your[s]elf, [s]aid the revenue officer. Did not I [s]ee you [s]cratching as you came along de road; and do you tink, you teef, dat I with to get de leprosy, or de [s]curvy, and have to [s]leep in a bag o' brim[s]tone two or tree weeks, before I be fit to travel wid his honour the Captain again? The deel damn me, [s]aid Duncan, if I can bear that. What, [s]wear, Duncan? [s]aid the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-541.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] Captain, or cur[s]e rather; you that are a Covenanter, and have religious books in your wallet, the Confe[s][s]ion of Faith and the Catechi[s]ms! How can I help it, man, [s]aid Duncan. The deel rive his [s]aul, but I man be at him. Duncan had by this time [s]eized his walking [s]taff, and put him[s]elf in an attitude to attack his adver[s]ary, who on the other hand had, in[s]tinctively, en[s]conced him[s]elf behind the Captain, and oppo[s]ed him as a rampart to the fury of the Scot. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, you are in the wrong on this occa[s]ion, you gave the asfront, and ought to excu[s]e the revenue officer for what he has [s]aid, which, by the bye, was not ju[s]tifiable, on any other ground but that of provocation. For national reflections are at all times reprehensible. But in order to compo[s]e this matter, and that we may have no further disturbance, I will take the large, though more humble bed my [s]elf, and [s]leep with the exci[s]e officer, for the reputation of the government who has thought proper to appoint him to this tru[s]t. The deel take me if ye [s]hall do that, Captain, [s]aid Duncan; I wad rather take the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-542.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] the [s]tain upon my[s]el, than let my liege be di[s]graced; for it wad come a' to the [s]ame thing in the end, that I had been the waiting man o' ane that had been the bed fellow o'a gauger. O! guid keep us, how that would found in Scotland. What wad my relation Willy Fergu[s]on, that is profe[s][s]or i' the high college o' E'nburgh, [s]ay to that? But rather than your honour [s]hou'd take the [s]tain upon you, I [s]al put up wie it for a night; though if the landlady has a pickle [s]trae, and a blanket, I wad rather lie by the fire [s]ide, than contaminate my[s]el, beding wi' [s]ik a bog-trotting loon as he is, that wad gae into [s]ik an office for the [s]ake o' filthy lucre, and to make a living; when there are many honest means to get a [s]upport other ways. The landlady gave it to be under[s]tood that [s]he could furni[s]h him with a bag of [s]traw and a blanket. This adju[s]ted the difficulty, and [s]aved the delicacy of the Scotchman, and embarrassment of the Captain, in keeping peace between the bog-trotters; as in reality they both were, though the one had obtained a commi[s][s]ion, and the other remained a private per[s]on. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-543.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] IN the cour[s]e of the three following days, during which the Captain and the two bog trotters, journeyed together, a great deal of ill will [s]hewed it[s]elf between the under[s]trappers. By the bye, I a[s]k pardon, before I go farther, of the government, for thus confounding the revenue officer with the pre[s]ent waiting man; but I aver, that it is not owing to any di[s]re[s]pect of the government, though it may have that appearance; but is to be re[s]olved simply into the force of habit which I acquired in de[s]ignating O'Regan in the early part of this narrative, before he was advanced to office; and [s]ince that, to the impre[s][s]ion made upon my mind, occa[s]ionally by his conduct, which has not intirely corresponded with the dignity of the commi[s][s]ion. When in[s]tances occur of this nature, I fall involuntarily into the u[s]e of the former epithet, which reflection, doubtle[s]s, would teach [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-544.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] teach me to di[s]card. This is my apology; and if it [s]hould be attributed to any [s]ecret grudge, or di[s]like of public mea[s]ures, or per[s]ons at the head of our affairs, it will be a great inju[s]tice. But, as I was saying, in the cour[s]e of the following days, much bickering took place between the Hibernian and the Scotchman; or as I might otherwi[s]e expre[s]s my[s]elf, between the [s]on of St. Andrew, and St. Patrick. The Scot thought the Hibernian defective in grace and manners; both becau[s]e he did not a[s]k a ble[s][s]ing to his food, and becau[s]e he took the liberty to eat with the Captain, and to conver[s]e with him as on equal terms. Indeed it was the only fault he found with the Captain him[s]elf, that he did not [s]ay grace to meat, and that he admitted the gauger to this enjoyment of equality. He did not enter fully into the nece[s][s]ary policy of ob[s]erving the forms of re[s]pect to officers of government, merely for the [s]ake of the authority, and as a compliment to the laws them[s]elves. Nor was his knowledge of the human mind, and the modes of acting, [s]ufficient to inform him, that the [s]aying grace at victuals is a matter of form, more than of faith; and that for this rea[s]on, [s]ome chri[s]tian fects [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-545.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] [s]ects, particularly the people called Quakers, omit it altogether. The Hibernian would [s]ometimes beat off, to u[s]e a nautical phra[s]e, and di[s]arm his adver[s]ary by expre[s][s]ions of benevolence, as "Love your [s]houl," &c.; [s]ometimes he would prepare for battle, and be di[s]po[s]ed to defend him[s]elf; on which occa[s]ions it behoved the Captain to interfere, and break off the conte[s]t. The Captain, at length, weary of this trouble, thought of the expedient of dismissing the revenue officer a day or two a head, in order that he might be apart from the other bog trotter. This being done, with exhortation that he would go lorward [s]peedily, and open an office in the di[s]trict, the Captain propofed to remain a day at the public hou[s]e where he then was, in order to give the revenue officer the advantage of the [s]tart I have mentioned. In the mean time, hearing of a cave in the neighbourhood, which was thought to be a great curio[s]ity, he took the opportunity of vi[s]iting it. The guide led them to it, I mean the Captain and his waiting man, in about an hour's walk from the public hou[s]e. It was on the bank of a [s]mall river; the mouth of the cave opening to the bank [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-546.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] bank. A [s]mall [s]tream i[s][s]ued from the cave, and fell into the river, with a fall of a few feet over a rock, rendered [s]mooth by the current of the water. Above this, was a [s]hade of [s]preading beech, with thick foliage, and beneath, towards the [s]trand of the river, was a gradual de[s]cent with wa[s]hed pebbles, and a clear filtrating [s]and. Hard by the fall of this water, and on the [s]trand of the river, the attention of the Captain was attached by certain rude [s]culptures, ob[s]ervable on a flat rock; and al[s]o by others on a perpendicular one, that compo[s]ed a part of the bank. There was the figure of the tarapin, the bear, the turkey, &c. It was a [s]ubject of reflection with the Captain, whether the[s]e impre[s][s]ions had been made by the animals them[s]elves, while the rock had been in a pla[s]tic [s]tate, and before it had hardened from clay into [s]tone; or whether it was the work of the [s]avages, before the Europeans had possession of the country. He lamented that he had not a philo[s]opher at hand, to determine this. On the bank above, and toward the mouth of the cave, were a number of petrefactions to be found; the water that ran here, appearing hence to have a petrifying quality. The Captain deri [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-547.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] considering the[s]e, was thinking with him[s]elf how good a [s]chool this would have been for Teague, had he been admitted a member of the Philo[s]ophical Society, as had been propo[s]ed at an early period. The mouth of the cave, was of a height and width to receive a man walking upright, and without con[s]traint on his entrance; after a pa[s][s]age of a few yards, lined with the [s]olid rocks, it opened into an apartment of about eighteen feet cube. The oozing from above formed the [s]talactites, and would probably in the cour[s]e of a century or two, fill up this chamber altogether, unle[s]s by digging above, the cour[s]e of the water could be diverted from the roof, and carried off by a conduit on a [s]olid part of the mountain. The floor of the chamber had been rai[s]ed by the pretrifaction of the water; as appeared from the inequality of [s]urface, formed by the stalactites, and from the te[s]timony of the guide, who remembered the time, not more than fifteen years ago, when the descent to this apartment, was a [s]tep of at lea[s]t a foot from the level of the entrance. Pa[s][s]ing on a few yards more, they descended a [s]tep, and came to a [s]econd apratment, of a greater extent, and of not less [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-548.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] than an hundred feet to the level vault. Here was a va[s]t bed of human [s]keletons petrified, but di[s]tingui[s]hable by their forms. No doubt it had been a repo[s]itory of [s]avage chiefs, who[s]e bodies, converted into [s]tone by the virtue of this water, were pre[s]erved more durably than the mummies of Egypt. The dimen[s]ions of [s]ome of the [s]keletons be[s]poke them giants; that of one mea[s]ured eight feet, wanting an inch. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, I doubt much whether there have been larger giants in Scotland. Aye have there, half as large again, [s]aid Duncan; from the [s]tones that are put up in [s]ome ca[s]tles, there mu[s]t have been men at lea[s]t eighteen or twenty feet in height. What can have become of this breed? [s]aid the Captain. They have fought wi' ane another, 'til they are a' dead, [s]aid Duncan. This was the easiest way of accounting for the lo[s]s. There was an a[s]cent of a [s]tep or two to the next apartment, which was of an oval form, the conjugate diameter of which was about thirty feet, and the tran[s]ver[s]e twenty five. There were the bows and arrows, all petrified, that the[s]e warriors had u[s]ed in life. The water de[s]cended not in drops, but through the fine pores of the rock [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-549.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] rock in a gentle dew, and with an impression of extreme cold, [s]o as to endanger life, and probably convert the human body into [s]tone in a very [s]hort [s]pace of time. The guide thought it not advi[s]able to remain long, and Duncan was anxious to return; the forms of the dead in the chamber behind him leading him to apprehend, that [s]ome of their [s]hades might come after them, to enquire the occa[s]ion of their vi[s]it. Regaining the entrance of the cave, and emerging into light, I mean the light of day, for they had entered with torches, they left the place, and returned to the tavern. The day following, they paid another visit to the cave, and ob[s]erved in the chamber of bows and arrows, a pool of limpid water, into which looking, they discovered arrow heads, and hatchets of [s]tone innumerable. They took out, and brought away [s]ome of them. The[s]e had no doubt been fir[s]t formed in wood, and then put in this water to petrify, and become fit for u[s]e. Thus we ea[s]ily account for the formation of [s]uch implements; whereas the idea of being formed out of a [s]tone, in the fir[s]t in[s]tance, by the dint of human labour, and with no other in[s]truments than [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-550.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] than [s]tone it[s]elf, involves great difficulty. This di[s]covery, the Captain, I pre[s]ume, lo[s]t no time in communicating to the Philosophical Society, as will in due time appear, from a publication of their transactions. Near the entrance, and on the right, was the pa[s][s]age to what is called the petrified grove. This, on their return they entered, and in about thirty [s]teps, found them[s]elves in a [s]pacious [s]quare, which appeared to have been once the [s]urface of the earth: For here was trees in their natural po[s]ition, with wa[s]ps ne[s]ts on them, all petrified; and buffaloes standing under, in their proper form, but as hard as adament. A bleak wind, with a petrifying dew, had arre[s]ted them in life, and fixed them to the [s]pot; while the mountain in a [s]eries of ages, had grown over them. That which [s]truck the Captain mo[s]t, was an Indian man reduced to [s]tone, with a bundle of peltry on his back. If the virtuo[s]i of Italy, could have acce[s]s to this vault, there would be danger of them robbing it of [s]ome of the[s]e figures, in order to compare with the [s]tatues that have been made by hands. When this cave [s]hall have gained due celebrity, there is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-551.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] is no qe[s]tion, but that attempts of this nature will be made. I [s]ubmit therefore, whether it would not be advi[s]eable for the connoi[s][s]eurs of America, to apply to the legi[s]lature of the [s]tate, where the cave is, to prevent [s]uch exportation. The Captain leaving this place, took nothing with him but the [s]kin of a wild cat, which hung upon a [s]tone peg in the [s]ide of the grotto, and which he broke off, by giving it a [s]udden jerk as he turned round. Duncan took a petrified turtle, which he thought re[s]embled a highland bonnet, and [s]aid he would [s]crape it out, and [s]end it for a curio[s]ity to Perth. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-552.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] Containing Ob[s]ervations. It may be ob[s]erved, that as I advance in my book, I make fewer chapters, by way of commentary, and occupy my[s]elf chiefly with the narrative. It is the characteristic of old age, and may be decorous towards the conclu[s]ion of the work. Nevertheless, I [s]hall arre[s]t my[s]elf here a little, to reflect on one particular of the discoveries of the Captain; the [s]culpture on the rocks, which appeared to be the labour of the aborigne[s]s of this country. I have not [s]een the[s]e [s]culptures, for I have not had an opportunity of vi[s]ting this cave; but I have [s]een [s]imiliar [s]culptures, in abundance, on the we[s]t of the Allegany mountains. I recollect at an early period to have heard it [s]aid, that Ferdinando Soto, had been on the Ohio waters, and as high as the mouth of the great Kenaway; and to have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-553.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] have heard it given as a proof of this, that in a particular place near the mouth of that river, the imperial eagle was to be [s]een engraven on a rock; the eagle which was the en[s]ign of the Spani[s]h monarchy, under Charles V, al[s]o emperor of Germany, and the [s]ucce[s][s]or of the Cae[s]ars. It was added, on the [s]ame ground, that the ve[s]tiges of fortifications di[s]coverable in this country, were the remains of Spani[s]h works, and encamping grounds, under Soto. I had under[s]tood, that the great Franklin had adopted this hypothe[s]is with regard to the[s]e forts, from the [s]culpture of the eagle. In the winter of the year 1787, I had the happine[s]s to conver[s]e with that [s]age, and among[s]t a number of que[s]tions, which I had the curio[s]ity, and perhaps impertinence, to a[s]k, I put this, with regard to the Kenaway [s]culpture, and the theory of the ve[s]tiges of forts in the we[s]tern country. I found his ideas to be as I had been informed, and have [s]tated. I was then in Philadelphia. In the fall of this year, having returned to the we[s]tern country, a [s]urveyor who had been engaged in [s]urveying lands on the Kenaway, being in my office on [s]ome bu[s]ine[s]s, it occurred to me to interrogate him [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-554.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] him on the [s]ubject of the [s]culpture. He had [s]een the engraving, of what was thought to be the eagle, but called it a Turkey; which word no [s]ooner [s]trnck my ear, than all the hypothe[s]is of the holy Roman eagle, and Ferdinando Soto, fell to the ground. It is a turkey, thought I, which the fancy of the virtuo[s]o and antiquarian, has converted into the king of birds. Conver[s]ing, with the [s]urveyor, he gave me an account more minutely of this, and other figures cut upon the rock, viz. the turkey with its wings [s]pread, as if ju[s]t alighting; the deer with his branching horns; and the [s]avage him[s]elf, with a large head and long limbs, rudely cut. He added, that he had heard from a hunter whom he well knew, that there was a rock with [s]imilar engravings on Cheat river, a [s]mall di[s]tance above where it falls into the Monongahela; and promi[s]ed to bring this hunter to give me a de[s]cription. About a month afterwards, the surveyor brought the hunter to me, who appeared to have been ob[s]ervant, and to be intelligent. He had [s]een the rocks near the mouth of Cheat river. The following is the memorandum that I took from him: The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-555.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] "The turkey appears to have alighted at the lower part of the rock, and ran up to the top. You [s]ee the track, which it leaves; the [s]tretched back, and the body thrown forward, as between flying and running. There is the figure of a man, with a large head, and horns, and a thin [s]keleton-like body. There are deer tracks well cut. This rock [s]tands on a bend of the river; and the figures on the lower end, which projects mo[s]t, are defaced by the water, which ri[s]es to this height in the time of floods. There is a hor[s]e track. This is the only thing that I think remarkable, if it is a hor[s]e track; for, as I do not know that there were any hor[s]es here, before the European [s]ettlements, it would argue that this engraving had been done [s]ince, and by the natives who have come from the Che[s]apeek, and had [s]een hor[s]es. The [s]ettlement made by Captain Smith at the mouth of James river, Virginia, was I believe the earlie[s]t made, contiguous to this country." This hunter gave me to under[s]tand, that he had [s]een a rock, [s]culptured in like manner on the Kenaway, about eighty miles from its mouth; that is nearly in a line [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-556.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] line directly we[s]t from the rocks on Cheat river. Having been led into the way of enquiring on this [s]ubject, I have found that the[s]e engravings are very common throughout the whole we[s]tern country; that they are di[s]cernible all along the Ohio, at low water e[s]pecially, when the horizontal rocks are left bare; that they are found on the margins of the [s]maller [s]treams al[s]o. I had heard of one of the[s]e on the Monongehela, about forty miles above Pittsburgh, and in the [s]ummer of 1793, crossing the country near that place, I [s]pent a part of a day, in going out of my cour[s]e to ob[s]erve it. The [s]culptures were of the [s]ame kind, and an[s]wer the de[s]cription before given of tho[s]e el[s]ewhere. The figures on this are, a bear rudely or rather clum[s]ily cut; a hawk flying with a [s]nake in its beak; the moon and the [s]even [s]tars; a racoon; a human arm, and human feet, well done; a buck with branching horns; the turkey; and a number others. I want no other proof that the[s]e [s]culptures were by the natives, than the form of the feet, which are unque[s]tionably Indian. The narrowne[s]s, and [s]mallne[s]s of the heel evinces it. It might al[s]o be induced as a pre [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-557.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] pre[s]umption, that there are the ve[s]tiges of a [s]ortification, [s]uch as has been mentioned, ju[s]t above on the hill. For it is reasonable to [s]uppo[s]e, that the[s]e works of lei[s]ure and ta[s]te, were mo[s]t likely to be pur[s]ued in the neighbourhood of [s]uch a work. But what has been at all times conclu[s]ive to me, that the[s]e engravings are the works of the natives, is, the circumstance that no alphabetic mark of any language, or Roman or Arabic numeral, is found among[s]t any of the[s]e. For it is well known, that it is a thing which would occur to any European, who [s]hould amu[s]e him[s]elf in this manner, to impre[s]s the initials at lea[s]t of his name, and the digits of the year. I had put this que[s]tion to the [s]urveyor and hunter, of whom I have made mention, with regard to letters and numeral marks, and found that none had been ob[s]erved by them, on the rocks which they had [s]een. On that ground, independent of all others, I made the deduction I have [s]tated. I con[s]ider the[s]e [s]culptures, as the [s]ir[s]t rude e[s][s]eys of the fine art of engraving; and to have been the work of [s]avages of ta[s]te, di[s]tingui[s]hed from the common ma[s]s, by a talent to imitate in wood or [s]tone, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-558.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] the forms of things in nature, and a capacity of receiving plea[s]ure from [s]uch an application of the mental powers. Whil[s]t a chief of genius, was waiting for the assembling of other chiefs, to hold a council; or while the warrior was waiting at a certain point for others, that were to meet him, he may have amu[s]ed him[s]elf in this manner; or it may have been the means to cheat wearine[s]s, and [s]olace the intellectual faculty, when there was no counselling in the nation, or wars to carry on. Happy [s]avage, that could thus amu[s]e him[s]elf, and exerci[s]e his fir[s]t preeminence over animals we call Bea[s]ts. They can hunt, and devour living things for food; but where do you find a wolf, or a fi[s]hing hawk, that has any idea of the[s]e ab[s]tract plea[s]ures, that feed the imagination? Why is it that I am proud, and value my[s]elf amongst my own [s]pecies? It is becau[s]e I think I po[s][s]e[s]s, in [s]ome degree, the distinguishing characteri[s]tic of a man, a ta[s]te for the fine arts: a ta[s]te and characteri[s]tic too little valued in America, where a system of finance, has introduced the love of unequal wealth; de[s]troyed the [s]pirit of common indu[s]try; and planted that of lot [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-559.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] lottery in the human heart; making the ma[s]s of the people gamblers; and under the idea of [s]peculation, [s]throuded engrossing and monopoly every where. It would [s]eem, that the [s]culptures of which I [s]peak, are the works of more ancient [s]avages, than the[s]e which have lately occupied this country; the[s]e tribes not being in the habit of making any [s]uch them[s]elves, and the figures evincing an old date, being in mo[s]t places, in [s]ome degree e[s][s]aced, by the water of the river, or the rain wa[s]hing the rocks, on which they are engraven. They would [s]eem to have been a more improved race, who had given way to barbarians of the north, who had over run the country. It is generally under[s]tood, by the tradition of the pre[s]ent Indians, and the early French writers, Charlevoix and others, that about the beginning of the pre[s]ent century, the Six Nations conquered this country, and expelled the former owners; and the word Ohio, is [s]aid to mean Bloody, and was the name given it from the blood [s]hed upon its waters at that time. The [s]ortifications of which we [s]peak, mu[s]t have al[s]o been works of defence, of that or an earlier period. From the trees grow [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-560.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] growing upon the mound, or parapet of the[s]e, they mu[s]t be [s]ome of them many hundred years old. It will [s]trike the reflection, how was it po[s][s]ible for the human mind to remain [s]o long in [s]o low a [s]tage of improvement, as was the ca[s]fe with the[s]e, the aborigines of this country. Perhaps the more puzzling que[s]tion would be, whence the [s]pring that could have [s]u[s][s]icient energy to rou[s]e from it. I [s]hall leave this to philo[s]ophy, thought, and hi[s]torical deduction. Enough has been [s]aid at pre[s]ent. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-561.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] ON the third day renewing their journey, the conver[s]ation between the Captain and his [s]ervant turned on the character, and hi[s]tory of the pre[s]ent revenue officer, the late Teague O'Regan. The Captain gave Duncan a relation of what had happened; in the ca[s]e of the attempt to draw him off to the Philo[s]ophical Society, to induce him to preach, and even to take a [s]eat in the legi[s]lature of the United States; that had it not been for a certain Traddle, a weaver, whom they had been fortunate enough to [s]ub[s]titute for him, the people would mo[s]t undoubtedly have elected Teague, and [s]ent him to Congre[s]s. Guid deliver us! [s]aid Duncan; do they make Parliament men o' weavers i' this kintra? In Scotland, it maun be a duke, or a laird, that can hae a [s]eat there. This is a republic, Duncan, [s]aid the cap [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-562.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] Captain; and the rights of man are understood, and exerci[s]ed by the people. And if he could be i' the Congre[s]s, why did ye let him be a gauger? [s]aid Duncan. This is all the prejudice of education, Duncan, [s]aid the Captain. An appointment in the revenue, under the executive of the United States, ought not to have di[s]grace attached to it in the popular opinion; for it is a nece[s][s]ary, and ought to be held a [s]acred, duty. I dinna ken how it is, [s]aid Duncan; but I [s]ee they hae every thing tail foremo[s]t in this kintry, to what they hae in Scotland: a gauger a gentleman; and weavers in the legi[s]lature. Ju[s]t at this in[s]tant, was heard by the way [s]ide, the jingling of a loom, in a [s]mall cabbin with a window towards the road. It [s]truck Duncan to expo[s]tulate with this weaver, and to know why it was that he al[s]o did not attain a [s]eat in [s]ome public body. Advancing to the orifice, as it might be called, he applied his mouth, and be[s]poke him, as he [s]at upon his loom, thus: Traddle, [s]aid he, giving him the [s]ame name that the Captain had given the other; why is it that ye [s]it here, treading the[s]e twa [s]tecks, and playing wi' your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-563.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] your elbows, as ye throw the thread, when there is one o' your occupation, not far off, that is now a member of the hou[s]e o' lords, or commons, in America; and is gane to the Congre[s]s o' the United States? canna ye get your[s]el elected; or it is because ye dinna offer, that ye are left behind in this manner. Ye [s]hud be striving man, while guid po[s]ts are gaeing, and no be [s]itting there wi' your back[s]ide on a beam. Dinna your neibours gie ya a vote. Ye [s]hud get a chapin o' whiskey, man, and drink 'till them, and gar them vote, or, ye [s]houd gae out and talk politics, and mak [s]peeches. Such was the addre[s]s of Duncan, meaning nothing more than to amu[s]e him[s]elf, with the idea of a manufacturer obtaining a [s]eat in the legi[s]lature, and making laws in[s]tead of warping webs. But in the mean time, the wife of the mechanic, who had overheard the conver[s]ation, and was incen[s]ed at an attempt to take her hu[s]band from his bu[s]ine[s]s, [s]eizing a pot [s]tick and running out, and turning the corner of the hou[s]e, laid a blow upon the po[s]teriors of the orator; accompanying her force with reproachful words to this effect: will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-564.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] Will you never let the man alone, [s]aid [s]he, to mind his bu[s]ine[s]s, but be putting the[s]e notions in his head. He has been once con[s]table, and twice member of assembly; and what has he got by it, but to leave his cu[s]tomers at home, complaining of their work not done? It is but little good that has been got of him the[s]e three years, but going to elections, and meetings, and talking politics; and after all, what does he know of the[s]e matters? ju[s]t about as much as my brown cow. A [s]et of lounging louts, coming here and taking up his time with idle non[s]en[s]e of what laws [s]hould be made, and urging him to be elected; and William Rabb's wife waiting for her coverlet this three months, and Andrew Nangle for his [s]hirt cloth. It is enough to put a woman in a pa[s][s]ion that has the temper of a [s]aint, to have her man's head turned [s]o from his own affairs, by idle vagabonds that come the way in this manner. At this, [s]he made another effort, and [s]pringing forward, was about to impre[s]s a [s]econd blow; when Duncan retreating, and li[s]ting up his [s]tick in his turn acco[s]ted her in the[s]e words: "Gin ye were a man, as ye are a muckle witch, I [s]houd be for taking ye wi' this rung acro[s]s your hurdies. it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-565.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] Is it any affront to have it evened to your man Traddle, to gae to the [s]enate, and to get a po[s]t i' the government, and no be knotting threads here, wi' his [s]huttle, like a trade[s]man o' Pai[s]ly? Ye vile carlin, ye maun be a witch, or a war[s]e body, to take a [s]tick in your hand, like a driver o' [s]tots, and come pelmel, upon a man ahint his back, when he is na [s]peaking till ye. Foul fa' me, but if it were na a [s]hame to battle wi' ane o' your [s]ex, I wad break your back with a lunder, before ye knew what ye were about. To keep this honest man here, [s]hut up like a pri[s]oner under ground, in a dungeon, drawing a reed till him, in[s]tead o' throwing out his arms like a Latin [s]cholar, or a collegian, making his oration to his hearers? Are ye chained there, (turning his [s]peech to Traddle,) that ye [s]tay [s]ae contentedly your[s]el, man, and dinna break out, and e[s]cape [s]rae the fangs o' this witch." This witch! [s]aid [s]he, (apprehending danger from a [s]econd addre[s]s to the weaver,) this witch! I [s]hall witch you to [s]ome purpo[s]e, you vagabond. With this [s]he made a ha[s]ty [s]tep, and was nearly on the back of the Caledonian, with her pot-[s]tick, having made a [s]troke at him, which be eva [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-566.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] evaded, by taking to his heels, and retreating [s]peedily. The Captain in the mean time had rode on, and left them to compleat their dialogue. Duncan had affected the wag on the late occa[s]ion with the manufacturer and his wife, and had like to have [s]uffered [s]ome alloy of pain from the blows which were inflictted, or were meditated. But at the public hou[s]e, in a village, a little way ahead this day, where they halted about noon, a circum[s]tance happened which changed his view a little, and disposed him to [s]adne[s]s, rather than to play the wag with his neighbours on the road. While the Captain had reclined, and was a[s]leep on a [s]ofa, a con[s]table had apprehended Duncan with a warrant; commanding this officer to take the pri[s]oner before a ju[s]tice of the peace, by whom it had been i[s][s]ued. Duncan had taken for granted, that it was the weaver's wife who had made complaint, and [s]ent after him, on account of the threats he had made to cha[s]- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-567.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] cha[s]ti[s]e her. The bu[s]tle in apprehending him, had made a noi[s]e in the porch, and awakened the Captain. Duncan, [s]aid he, what is the matter? Lord deliver me, [s]aid he, if I ken. They [s]ay I am a pri[s]oner. The bai[s]iff here has ta'en me wi' a warrant. It maun be that witch the weaver's wife, that has made a complaint, ju[s]t becau[s]e I was je[s]ting a wee, about her hu[s]band gaeing to the legi[s]lature; and [s]he did na take it weel, but amai[s]t brake my back wi' her' [s]purtle; and now [s]he has ga'en awa and [s]worn belike that I [s]trak her; for this is the way o' the[s]e witches, that they turn [s]tates evidence, and [s]wear for them[s]elves against hone[s]t people. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, this is what comes of your meddling with politics. You mu[s]t undertake to [s]ay for[s]ooth, who is qualified to be a repre[s]entative of the United States; you mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t upon an industrious mechanic to relinqui[s]h his occupation; and this not from any opinion of his fitne[s]s for [s]uch appointment, or any principle of love for the public good; but merely for your pa[s]time, and in ridicule of a republican government in this country. For though there have been instances of chu[s]ing weavers for the legi[s]lature, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-568.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] and coblers, and coopers, why make a burle[s]que of this? Have not the people a right to make [s]uch a choice? yet becau[s]e the[s]e things are not common in Scotland, it mu[s]t be the [s]ubject of a laugh here. Had you been [s]erious, there could have been no fault found; but the in[s]ult lies in your making a je[s]t of it, which was evident from your manner, in turning a[s]ide from the highway to addre[s]s a weaver through the windos of a cellar; and in an abrupt manner, to introduce an expo[s]tulation with him on the [s]ubject of election. No wonder that the termagant his wife, who did not reli[s]h the propo[s]ition, even in a [s]erious point of view, was offended, and di[s]po[s]ed to inflict blows; and, on the resistance made on your part, and threats probably thrown out, has applied to a justice of the peace, and obtained a warrant to commit you to the cu[s]tody of the law. What can they make o' it? [s]aid Duncan. I do not know, [s]aid the Captain, what offence it may be in law, but certainly it was a great indecorum to amu[s]e your[s]elf, not at the expence of a mechanic, but indirectly at the whole body politic of the union; not that I think it unbecoming to [s]end [s]uch as Traddle to deliberative blies; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-569.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] assemblies; but that you [s]eemed to think it [s]o; becau[s]e it is a thing not known in North-Britain, where ari[s]tocratic principles prevail. You might have meant this as pleasantry; but it may be con[s]trued a reflection upon a republican government, and to de[s]troy the rights of man, in the fir[s]t germ and principles of their exi[s]tence. They canna make high trea[s]on o't [s]aid Duncan. I do not know, [s]aid the Captain, what a [s]trict judge might make it, I [s]hould think it could not be made a hanging matter. However let us [s]ee the warrant, and enquire what the ju[s]tice of the peace has made of it. I [s]hall not [s]hew the warrant to any man, [s]aid the con[s]table, but to his wor[s]hip, justice Underchin, to whom I mu[s]t carry the pri[s]oner immediately. So come along; come along; the ju[s]tice will [s]hew you the warrant. There being no help for it, Duncan was obliged to go along, the Captain accompanying him. Being brought before the ju[s]tice, Ah, have ye nabbed him? [s]aid his wor[s]hip: I am glad ye have got him; a great ra[s]cal. There is no que[s]tion, [s]aid the Captain, [s]tep [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-571.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] [s]tepping forward, and addre[s][s]ing the justice, but the young man has acted with con[s]iderable imprudence; but ignorance of the world, and e[s]pecially of the laws and cu[s]toms of America, has been the principal cau[s]e of his intru[s]ion. Though he has not been long in my [s]ervice, yet I am disposed to [s]peak with [s]ome confidence of his civility in general. But, may it plea[s]e your wor[s]hip, in what [s]hape have you brought the charge. Is it an a[s][s]ault and battery, or what? I make it ba[s]tardy, [s]aid the ju[s]tice; what el[s]e would I make it? Ba[s]tardy! [s]aid the Captain. It might be fornication, or adultery; but how can it be ba[s]tardy in [s]o [s]hort a time? It cannot be a rape, that your wor[s]hip means. There was no rape, or fornication, or adultery in the ca[s]e, I will engage that. And how can there be ba[s]tardy? [s]ome very hot words pa[s][s]ed between him and the woman, and [s]trokes might have been given; but there was certainly no di[s]po[s]ition, as far as I could [s]ee, to beget ba[s]tards; nor was there time for it. They were not in [s]uch a very loving humour, when I left them; nor did he [s]tay behind me above twenty minutes on the road. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-572.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] The ju[s]tice was a little [s]warthy man, of a corpulent habit, [s]eated in an elbow chair, with pen, ink, and paper on a [s]tand by him. He threw him[s]elf back, as he [s]poke; leaned his head alternately on the right and left [s]houlder, and bridled his lips, as the phra[s]e is, di[s]covering in the affectation of his manner, great pride of office, and apparent [s]atisfaction in having caught a criminal. Endeavouring to be witty at the embarra[s]lsment of the pre[s]ent culprit, and the expre[s][s]ions of the Captain, why Mr. [s]aid he, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf, to this la[s]t, though I do not know who you are, that are [s]o willing to a[s][s]i[s]t me in the examination of this vagrant, yet I will observe to you, that I make no doubt that [s]ome hot, or at lea[s]t warm words, have pa[s][s]ed between them; and [s]trokes as you call it, might have been given; but as to the time of twenty minutes, or a larger period, it is of no con[s]ideration in the law; provided the woman [s]wears, as this one has done, that [s]he is with child by him. Nor will his ignorance of the cu[s]toms of America, excu[s]e him; we mu[s]t commit him, or bind him over, if he can find security, to appear at the [s]e[s][s]ions, to take his trial for the fornication. Wi' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-573.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] Wi' bairn! [s]aid Duncan. She might ju[s]t as well have ta'en an oath, that I was wi' bairn to her. Was na her man I raddle, [s]itting on his loom looking at us a' the time. O the fal[s]e jade! I get her wi' bairn! I wad get a witch wi' bairn as [s]oon. It is extraordinary, [s]aid the Captain, that [s]he could be certain of her pregnancy in [s]o [s]hort a time? So [s]hort a time! [s]aid the ju[s]tice, do you call [s]ix months a [s]hort time? It is not [s]ix hours, [s]aid the Captain, nor the half of it, [s]ince the fracas happened. Guid guide us! [s]aid Duncan, who was [s]tanding on the back ground, making his [s]oliloquy; Guid guide us, that I [s]hould come to America, to be tri'd for getting a woman wi' bairn. What will Mr. Dougal, our mini[s]ter think o' this? after ha'ing the Confe[s][s]ion of Faith wi' me, and [s]ae mony guid bukes. Standing on the [s]tool, is bad enough; but nathing to the way they hae i' this kintra, o' taking a man wi' a bum, and bringing him before a magistrate; ju[s]t the [s]ame thing as he ware a [s]heep-[s]tealer. O' the ba[s]e jade, to [s]wear a bairn upon me; what will my ain folks [s]ay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-574.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] [s]ay, when they hear o' it in Scotland? It will be a [s]tain upon a' my kin to the third generation. It was the deel him[s]elf put it in my head, to [s]tand taking wi' a fool weaver about his election. I wi[s]h I ware in Perth again, and out o' a' this trouble. Six hours! [s]aid the ju[s]tice, an[s]wering to the Captain. Is it not [s]ix months, Sampson, referring to the con[s]table, [s]ince this pedlar left this [s]ettlement? Pedlar! [s]aid the Captain; he never was a pedlar; nor is it [s]ix months, [s]ince he left Scotland. He was recommended to me by a gentleman whom I knew very well, Mr. M`Donald, as a lad ju[s]t come over. So that it is impossible he could have been here [s]ix months ago. I am no [s]ax months frae Perth, [s]aid Duncan. Is not your name, Ryburn, [s]aid the ju[s]tice, and are you not that Scotch pedlar, that was in this [s]ettlement two or three months? Can there be any mi[s]take? referring to the con[s]table; is not this Niel Ryburn, for whom the warrant calls? It is the very man, [s]aid the con[s]table. I knew him by his dialect the moment I [s]aw him in the porch at the public hou[s]e, talking with the ho[s]tler. He has the [s]ame brogue upon his tongue, and [s]ays Guid guide us, ju[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-575.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] ju[s]t in the [s]ame manner: only at that time he u[s]ed to [s]ay al[s]o, By my fa'th, and by my [s]a'l, more than he does at pre[s]ent. He has become religious [s]ince, or pretends to be [s]o, in order to deceive your wor[s]ship. But at that time, he had not much religion about him, and had no guid bukes as he calls them in his pocket; but could damn his [s]a'l, and [s]wear like a devil. Niel Ryburn! [s]aid the Captain, that is not the name of my valet. It is that of Duncan Fergu[s]on. But pray who is the woman that he is [s]aid to have got with child? The weaver's wife is the only one that he has had a conver[s]ation with to my knowledge; and as I [s]aid before, they were not much in the way of making love when I left them. A weaver's wife! [s]aid the ju[s]tice; no, Mr. M`Radin, or whatever el[s]e they may call you; it is no weaver's wife; it is Kate Maybone, that has made oath again[s]t him. He had carnal knowledge of her about [s]ix months ago, when he was in this settlement pedling, and got her with child. I perceive [s]aid the Captain, we are all at cro[s]s purpo[s]es, and under a mi[s]take in this bu[s]ine[s]s. This North Briton--- Stop, [s]aid the ju[s]tice, if you are to give your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-576.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] your te[s]timony, Mr. with the cocked hat, [s]peaking to the Captain; we [s]hall take it by your[s]elf; and not let the pedlar hear it, to enable him to frame his [s]tory to the fame purpo[s]e. Accordingly Duncan being withdrawn, in the cu[s]tody of the con[s]table, the Captain was examined, and related the particulars on oath of all that he knew respecting the pri[s]oner; and now being ordered to withdraw, the pri[s]oner was called in and interrogated. His [s]tory was to the [s]ame effect with that of the Captain, and would [s]eem to di[s]tingui[s]h him from his countrymen named in the warrant; but his Scotti[s]h dialect founded the pre[s]umption of identity [s]o [s]trongly, that it was difficult, if not impossible, to get over it. I [s]ee, [s]aid the ju[s]tice, that they have framed their [s]tories by collu[s]ion. They are a couple of ingenious ra[s]cals; though the one of them, the pedlar, affects great simplicity; and the other vouches for him that he is ignorant. I believe I mu[s]t commit them both; the one for ba[s]tardy, and the other for hor[s]e-[s]tealing. For the circumstance of having but one hor[s]e between them, is extremely [s]u[s]picious, and renders it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-577.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] it probable that they mu[s]t have [s]tolen that one. The [s]tory which they tell, of having come in company with a revenue officer, whom they have [s]ent a head on foot, is ab[s]urd, e[s]pecially when you add what the one who is called Captain tells, of this officer having been once his [s]ervant, or pa[s][s]ed for [s]uch, under the name of Teague O'Regan, and bog-trotting as he calls it, in the manner that this Duncan, which he pretends is the name, does now; and yet even then being likely to be taken from him to preach, to go to Congre[s]s, and the Lord knows what: It is impo[s][s]ible; it mu[s]t be a fal[s]ehood; and the probability is, that this fellow, this Captain, is the head of a gang of hor[s]e-thieves; and this Scotch pedlar, and the Iri[s]h revenue officer, are understrappers, with him, in the trade. Ths being [s]ignified to the Captain who was now called in, he addre[s][s]ed the justice to the following effect: Mr. Ju[s]tice, [s]aid he, what I have related to you upon oath, however improbable it may appear, is the fact; and as to your [s]urmi[s]es of hor[s]e [s]tealing, they are groundle[s]s; and you may commit, if you think proper; but you [s]hall an[s]wer for the con[s]equences. It is no [s]mall matter to deprive a citizen of his li- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-578.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] liberty, and I am not [s]o much unknown to the government, as not to obtain redress again[s]t an ignoramus like you, who di[s]grace the commi[s][s]ion by your [s]tupidity, as many of the [s]ame office do. The utmost of your power is to commit; but it may come in my turn to impeach, for your abu[s]e of power. What proof, or pre[s]umption have you, that I have [s]tolen hor[s]es? Is it that of having a [s]ervant on foot, rather than having one mounted? If I had [s]tolen one hor[s]e, could I not as well have [s]tolen two? The pre[s]umption is the rever[s]e of what your wor[s]hip [s]tates. As to the North Briton, who is charged with ba[s]tardy, by the name of Niel Ryburn, with a certain Kate Maybone, where is the woman? cannot [s]he be brought face to face with the man, and confronted? Let her then [s]ay if this is Niel Ryburn; and that this [s]imple lad is the per[s]on who begot a child with her, [s]ix or eight months ago. I am per[s]uaded he was on the ea[s]t of the Atlantic at that time, and if [s]he could become pregnant by him, [s]he mu[s]t have been on that [s]ide al[s]o. Let this matter be examined. From the [s]edate and firm manner with which the Captain had expre[s][s]ed him[s]elf, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-579.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] the ju[s]tice began to be apprehen[s]ive of having been mi[s]taken, and was intimidated. He was willing therefore to [s]end for the woman who had made the oath. Being in the village, [s]he was in a [s]hort time brought before his wor[s]hip, by the constable who had been di[s]patched for that purpose. Kate, [s]aid the magi[s]trate, is not this the Scotch pedler, the father of your child, and again[s]t whom you have made oath? The father of my child! [s]aid Kate; does your wor[s]hip think, I would let [s]uch a [s]ervant looking [s]on of a bitch as that, get me with child? does your wor[s]hip mean to affront me, by having him taken up in the place of the moving merchant, Mr. Ryburn? no, no; he is not the father of my child. I never [s]aw the clum[s]y looking dunce in my life before. Duncan was well plea[s]ed to be relieved from the charge of ba[s]tardy; but at the [s]ame time a little hurt, at the undervaluing of the witne[s]s. Young lady, [s]aid he, I wi[s]h you muckle joy o' your big belly, but I dinna envy the pedlar o' his guid luck o' ha'eing you wi' bairn. If I was to [s]tand i' the [s]tool, it [s]hould be for anither [s]ort of luking la[s][s]ie; and no [s]ik a brazen fac'd ane as ye are. Kate [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-580.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] Kate was about to make reply; but the ju[s]tice not thinking it comported with the dignity of office, to [s]uffer an altercation in his pre[s]ence, and being chagrined at not finding this to be the real culprit, relea[s]ed the arre[s]t, with ill humour, de[s]iring Captain, pri[s]oner, Kate, and con[s]table, to be gone about their bu[s]ine[s]s. CHAP. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-581.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] THE [s]econd day after this, in the afternoon of the day, as the Captain and his man Duncan were advancing on their journey, they perceived a per[s]on a head, coming towards them, with a long [s]louching walk, as if in con[s]iderable ha[s]te, and a [s]tick in his hand. If that man had not his face the wrong way, [s]aid the Captain, I [s]hould take him for the revenue officer, Teague O'Regan; he has a good deal of his appearance, both in his per[s]on and his gait. But he cannot have mistaken his direction [s]o much as to be coming this way, in[s]tead of going to his di[s]trict. I dinna ken, [s]aid Duncan; the[s]e Iri[s]h ay put the wrang end o' their [s]peech foremost; and why not put the wrang end o' their cour[s]e now and then. As they were debating, the per[s]on approached, and it was di[s]covered to be Teague. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-582.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] He had advanced to a pa[s]s of the mountain, where he was met and oppo[s]ed by two men, of an athletic per[s]onal appearance, who forbade him, at his peril, to proceed farther. They were armed with clubs, and pre[s]ented a very choleric countenance. The revenue officer had thought it not advi[s]able to encounter them, being two to one, and propo[s]ed rather to fall back, and join him[s]elf to the Captain and the Scotchman, who might [s]upport him in his march. The[s]e two men were of the name of Valentine and Or[s]on; [s]o called either from the fiercene[s]s of their nature, or from their [s]uperior [s]trength, re[s]embling the two champions of that name, of whom we read in books of romance. They had been born and bred in the[s]e mountains. Valentine had the advantage of [s]ome education with a Wel[s]h [s]chool-ma[s]ter, who pa[s][s]ed his native language upon the young man for Latin; [s]o that conceiving him[s]elf to have acquired the rudiments of this tongue, and therefore qualified to enter on the [s]tudy of [s]ome one of the learned professions, he had deliberated whether he [s]hould plead law, preach, or be a physician; but happening one day to [s]ee a ber [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-583.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] member of Congre[s]s riding along, with a boy behind him, carrying a portmanteau, he had taken it into his head to be a member him[s]elf, and had canva[s][s]ed frequently for that delegation; but had been disappointed; one per[s]on and another coming forward, and taking off the votes. He had made up his mind for [s]ome time pa[s]t to make an experiment of per[s]onal force, to intimidate competitors. For this purpo[s]e, he had taken to his a[s][s]i[s]tance another young man of the name of Or[s]on, whom he found in the neighbourhood, and with whom [s]allying out as a kind of [s]quire, or armour-bearer, he could knock down any fellow that had the impudence to [s]et up against him in the di[s]trict. Or[s]on had not actually been [s]uckled by a bear, like his name [s]ake in romance; but he was a rough, [s]tout man, and well qualified to bear a part in this mode of canva[s][s]ing. The rumour had prevailed by [s]ome means, that Teague was coming forward to [s]tand a trial in that di[s]trict; whether propagated by [s]ome wag, who pa[s][s]ed him on the road, and was di[s]po[s]ed to amu[s]e him[s]elf with the apprehen[s]ions of the two ru[s]tics; or to [s]ome mi[s]take on the parr of tra- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-584.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] travellers, who had come through the village in the neighbourhood. The Captain, however, and the revenue officer him[s]elf, had re[s]olved their menace into a di[s]like of the exci[s]e law, and a wi[s]h to intimidate, or prevent by force, the opening an in[s]pection office in that di[s]trict. Under the[s]e impre[s][s]ions, advancing to the pa[s]s, they were met by the young men, who made a [s]hew of battle; though on their part, not a little di[s]concerted at [s]eeing Teague return with a reinforcement, and with the advantage of cavalry. The Captain placed him[s]elf in the center, on hor[s]e-back, and a little in advance of the two wings on foot, Duncan and Teague. The North Briton, preserved a compo[s]ed manner, and [s]hewed a [s]teady countenance. The Hibernian, on the other hand, willing by an appearance of great rage, and much valour, to supercede the nece[s][s]ity of battle, or blood-[s]hed, [s]tood with his right foot before the left, flouri[s]hing his cudgel, and grinning like an angry per[s]on, who was impatient for the on[s]et. As is the manner of heroic men, the Captain thought proper, before the commencement of ho[s]tilities, to acco[s]t the adverse [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-585.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] ver[s]e combatants, to [s]ee whether it might not be in his power to remove, or at lea[s]t allay their prejudices again[s]t the obnoxious law, and induce them to [s]uffer the officer to pa[s]s. Accordingly he addre[s][s]ed them in the following words: Gentlemen, [s]aid he, the law may be exceptionable on general principles, or locally unequal in its operation to you in this di[s]trict. Neverthele[s]s, it is the law, and has received the [s]anction of the public voice, made known through the constitutional organ, the repre[s]entatives of the people. It is the great principle of a republican government, that the will of the majority [s]hall govern. The general will has made this a law, and it behoves individual minds to [s]ubmit. I wad na fleech and prig wi' them, [s]aid Duncan, [s]tepping forward, and flouri[s]hing his cudgel. I wad na hae many words about it. But ju[s]t [s]ee at ance whether they will dare to [s]tap the high road. Gin they per[s]i[s]t, I can tak ane o' them, and ye and Teague, can tak the ither, and my lug for it, I [s]al gie the ane that fa's to my lot, a weel payed [s]kin, I warrant him. Sae dinna ye tak up time fairlying about the matter; but gae on, and try our rungs o'er the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-586.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] the hurdies o' them. I [s]al gar this [s]tick crack o'er the riggin o' the loons, in a wie while. Teague, in the mean time, was on the back ground, endeavouring to look [s]our, making wry mouths, and grinning occasionally: all this with a view to [s]upport the threats of the North Briton. Duncan, [s]aid the Captain, for he had not attended to Teague, put up your cudgel. Policy oftentimes avails more than force. The law in que[s]tion may beodious, and great allowance ought to be made for the prejudices of the people. By [s]o[s]t mea[s]ures, and mild words, prejudices may be overcome. The[s]e appear to be but young men; and ra[s]hne[s]s is a concomitant of early life. By expostulation we may probably have the good fortune to be able to pa[s]s on, without being under the nece[s][s]ity to attempt battery, or [s]hed blood. The two young men were not to be intimidated by a [s]hew of cudgels, or grinning, and wry mouths; but [s]till conceiving that the object of the Captain was to force an election in favour of his precusor, the Hibernian, and not understanding the [s]cope of his harrangue, but supposing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-587.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] [s]ing him to [s]peak of the law of election where the votes of the majority, that is, the greater number of votes, con[s]titutes the repre[s]entative, they were as much disposed to u[s]e force as at fir[s]t; and, advancing, appeared ready to [s]u[s]tain the [s]hock. An affray mu[s]t have en[s]ued; for the Captain having taken every po[s][s]ible measure to avoid blows, was now re[s]olute to force the pa[s]s, even at the ri[s]k of battle. But ju[s]t at this in[s]tant, a grave man coming from the village, who had known the character, and had been frequently a witness of the conduct of the young men, addressed them: "Young men, [s]aid he, will you be eternally running into errors of this kind. Have you interrogated the[s]e gentlemen, and under[s]tood from themselves whether any of them are candidates, and mean to di[s]turb you by [s]etting up for Congre[s]s in this di[s]trict? It is po[s][s]ibly the humour of [s]ome wag coming up the road, and knowing your di[s]po[s]ition, that has created the [s]urmi[s]e." The fact was, that [s]ome wag who had pa[s][s]ed Teague on the road, and who had known the apprehen[s]ions of Valentine, had given ri[s]e to the report. For he thought to amu[s]e him[s]elf by it, knowing the gancies [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-588.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] extravagancies into which it would of cour[s]e throw the two young men. For the whole country, not long before that time, had heard in what manner they had mi[s]taken individuals for public candidates. On one occasion they had fought with a ma[s]on and his barrow-man, and abu[s]ed them considerably. On another occa[s]ion, they had knocked down a potter with a bag of earthen-ware, and broke [s]everal of his ve[s][s]els. For this rea[s]on, the grave man, of whom I [s]poke, who had got a hint by [s]ome means of what they were about, had traced the young men, and coming up at the critical moment, addre[s][s]ed them as I have before [s]aid, exhorting them to make enquiry fir[s]t, whether their apprehensions were well or ill founded; and not to take it for granted that either of the[s]e per[s]onages, were competitors for Congress, before the fact had been ascertained, and their preten[s]ions con[s]idered by an amicable expo[s]tulation. Candidates for Congre[s]s! [s]aid the Captain; what could have put that into the young mens heads? is it true, this bogtrotter, who is now an exci[s]e officer, was on the point once of being a candidate, or at lea[s]t of being elected, a tive [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-589.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] representative of the union; but having e[s]caped that, though with [s]ome difficulty, he is now in the executive department; and has received an appointment to the collection of the revenue of a di[s]trict beyond this, to which he is now on his way; and is far from having any thoughts of an election of any kind whatever. The two young men, at this, were relieved from their fears, and their minds [s]eemed dilated with unu[s]ual joy. Stepping forward, they [s]hook hands with Teague, and invited him to drink with them; but the Captain apologized, alledging the necessity on the part of O'Regan, to pre[s]s forward as [s]peedily as po[s][s]ible, and to be on the [s]pot where the functions of his duty called him. This apology [s]eeming to suffice, they all three made obei[s]ance to the young men, and to the grave looking man; and pa[s][s]ed on. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-590.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] Containing Reflections. It may be thought prepo[s]terous in the[s]e young men to attempt force in the matter of an election. That depends on their po[s][s]e[s][s]ing any other faculty by which they could [s]ucceed. Have not all animals recour[s]e to the[s]e means of providing for them[s]elves, which nature has given them? The [s]quirrel climbs a tree, while the wolf runs through the brake. The cat lies in wait, and watches for her prey; while the greyhound pur[s]ues with open mouth, and [s]eizes the hare or the fox. Valentine would not [s]eem to have possessed the advantage of mental recommendations; he could not have it in his power to allure and per[s]uade. Why not therefore act by compul[s]ion, and u[s]e force? But why not make application of this force upon the voters them[s]elves, and knock down either before or after an election, all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-591.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] all tho[s]e who had been ob[s]tinate, in withholding their [s]uffrages? It is probable that experiment had been made of this, and that it had been found ineffectual. What then remained, but to repel the intru[s]ion of competitors. It was more convenient, as there were fewer of the[s]e; at lea[s]t it rarely happens, that there are as many candidates as voters. It [s]eems more natural, as beginning at the [s]ource, and repre[s][s]ing the preten[s]ions of the canva[s][s]ing individuals, who are u[s]ually the fir[s]t movers in the bu[s]ine[s]s. It is of the nature of a [s]ummary proceeding, and avoids delay, to break the head of a competitor, and induce him by fear, if not by mode[s]ty, to de[s]i[s]t. It may be queried, what re[s]pectability in the capacity of legi[s]lators can [s]uch persons have, after having been elected, without the requi[s]ite information on [s]tate affairs, or talent of eloquence, to make a figure in a public body? That is no bu[s]ine[s]s of mine. It belongs to the[s]e that [s]et up for [s]uch appointment, to con[s]ider this. It may be [s]aid, however, that it is not nece[s][s]ary that all [s]hould make a figure in the [s]ame way. In the exhibition of a circus, you will be as much diverted with the clown who mounts [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-592.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] mounts a hor[s]e clum[s]ily, or who attempting to tumble, falls on his back[s]ide, as with the greate[s]t activity [s]hewn by the ma[s]ter. In mu[s]ic, ba[s]s is u[s]eful; nay, may be thought to be nece[s][s]ary, to mix with the treble. An illetirate and ignorant member of a deliberative a[s][s]embly, forms an agreeable contra[s]t with the intelligent; ju[s]t as in gardening, we are plea[s]ed with a wild cop[s]e after a parterre. It may be thought a ve[s]ania, or [s]pecies of madne[s]s, to entertain [s]uch an inordinate pa[s][s]ion for the legi[s]lature. Not at all; it was not a madne[s]s properly [s]o called, by which I mean, a phy[s]ical derangement of the intellect. The cau[s]e was merely moral; and the derangement only [s]uch as exi[s]ts in all ca[s]es, where the mind is not well regulated by education, and where the pa[s][s]ions are [s]trong and intemperate. This young man Valentine had conceived, at an early period, the idea of becoming a legi[s]lator; and as has been [s]aid, from [s]eeing [s]ome member of Congress pa[s]s the road, with a [s]ervant and portmanteau al[s]o; not at all comprehending the nece[s][s]ity, or at lea[s]t u[s]efulne[s]s, of a knowledge of the geography of the world in commercial que[s]tions; or of hi[s]tory in pol- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-593.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] political: he had been accu[s]tomed at home to run a foot race with a wood-ranger; to lift a piece of timber at a hou[s]e building, or log-rolling; or to wre[s]tle at Corni[s]h-hug with the young men of the village; and had imagined that the [s]ame degree of [s]trength and dexterity, which had given him a superiority, or at lea[s]t made him re[s]pectable in the[s]e, would rai[s]e him to reputation in the efforts of the human mind. Why need we wonder at an uneducated young man judging [s]o prepo[s]terou[s]ly on great [s]ubjects. It is not to be pre[s]umed that he ever had an opportunity of reading Cudworth's Intellectual Sy[s]tem, or any other writer on " the eternal fitne[s]s of things ." This belongs to the [s]chools; I mean the higher academies, where metaphy[s]ics, and the co-relate [s]cience of logic, is taught. I am aware that malevolent per[s]ons, judging from their feelings, will alledge that in the caricature I have given of the mountain candidate, I have had [s]ome prototype in view, and hence intended a [s]atire upon individuals It will not be a fair deduction; unle[s]s it is re[s]trained [s]imply to this, that [s]omething like it has occurred in the cour[s]e of my ob[s]ervation, which has given ri[s]e to my idea of the picture. Now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-594.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] Now that I am upon the [s]ubject of elections for deliberative a[s][s]emblies, I will make a few general ob[s]ervations, without meaning to give offence to any one. There are but two characters that can be re[s]pectable as repre[s]entatives of the people. A plain man of good [s]en[s]e, whether farmer, mechanic, or merchant; or a man of education and literary talents. The intermediate characters, who have neither ju[s]t natural reflection, nor the advantage of reading, are unnatural, and can derive no happine[s]s to them[s]elves from the appointment; nor can they be of u[s]e to the commonwealth. But men err, not only judging fal[s]ely of their capacity for a public tru[s]t, but in the means of obtaining it. I have in view, not only all indelicacy in the [s]olicitation of votes, but in the management that is too often u[s]ed on election days, in changing tickets, ob[s]tructing windows, voting more than once; a thing tolerable perhaps, or at lea[s]t excu[s]able, in the election of a [s]heriff, an office of profit; but which ought to be con[s]idered indelicate in a competition for honour. It is impo[s][s]ible for any law to reach the cure of this evil; it can be remedied only by attaching di[s]grace in public opinion, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-595.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] opinion, to them or the like arts. I do not mean to repre[s]ent as indelicate the candidates offering to [s]erve. For I would rather be accu[s]ed of forwardness to offer my[s]elf, that of affectation to decline, when I was willing to be elected. The one favours of cowardice and fal[s]ehood; the other, at the wor[s]t, can be called but vanity. The wife and virtuous exerci[s]e of the right of [s]uffrage, is the fir[s]t [s]pring of happiness in a republic. If this is touched corruptly, or un[s]kilfully, the movements of the machine are throughout affected. Not only judicious regulations by po[s]itive law are nece[s][s]ary to [s]ecure this, but the [s]y[s]tem of family and [s]chola[s]tick education ought to contemplate it. An advice which no father ought to fail to give to his [s]on [s]hould be to this effect. "Young man, you have the good fortune to be born in a republic; a felicity that has been enjoyed but by a [s]mall portion of the race of man, in any age of the world. In [s]ome ages it has been enjoyed by none at all. It is a principle of this government, that every man, has a right to elect, and a right to be elected . In the exerci[s]e of the fir[s]t, the right to elect, be taught my [s]on, to pre[s]erve a [s]crupulous and delicate honour: And as at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-596.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] at [s]chool, the [s]en[s]e of [s]hame among[s]t your equals, would re[s]train you from all fraud, in obtaining a game at fives; [s]o much more now that your are a man, let it re[s]train you from all unfairne[s]s in this the great game of man. With regard to being elected, your fir[s]t con[s]ideration will be your talent. Quid valeant humeri, quid ferre recu[s]ent. At [s]chool, you would de[s]pi[s]e the boy who would [s]et him[s]elf forward, as an expert [s]wimmer or wre[s]tler, who was deficient in [s]kill at the[s]e exerci[s]es. In order to be re[s]pectable, put not your[s]elf above your [s]trength. If you covet the honour of a public tru[s]t, think of qualifying yourself for it; and let the people think of chusing you to di[s]charge it; that is their business. Lay in a [s]tock of knowledge by reading in early life. Your old age, by the[s]e means will acquire dignity; and appointments will readily follow. You will be under no nece[s][s]ity of [s]olliciting inordinately the [s]uffrage of men."

This took place on the ground of irreligion in Teague, and di[s]regard for the covenants; but more e[s]pecially on a difference of opinion with regard to the de[s]ert of their re[s]pective [s]ervices, in the late rencounter with the highway-men, as they were di[s]po[s]ed to call them; Teague alledging that he had intimidated them by grinning, and wry mouths; Duncan claiming the credit by the di[s]play of his cudgel. The Captain had a good deal of trouble, in parrying a deci[s]ion of their respective preten[s]ions; or adju[s]ting them in [s]uch a manner as to [s]atisfy both. They were likely [s]ometimes to come to blows. He was relieved, however, by the approach of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-598.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] of the revenue officer to his di[s]trict, into which they now began to enter. After [s]ome days peregrination through it, having made choice of a central situation, it was thought proper to open an inspection office, which was done by hiring a hou[s]e, and writing over the door, Inspection office of Survey,  No.  &c. Su[s]picion had exi[s]ted on the part of the government, that oppo[s]ition would be made in this di[s]trict to the opening an office; or at lea[s]t to the collection of the revenue. The[s]e were founded not only in reports of threats of that nature; but in [s]ome in[s]tances of actual violence, clandestinely committed on deputies. It was for this rea[s]on, among[s]t others, that the Pre[s]ident had made choice of O'Regan, a [s]tout and re[s]olute man, as he thought him, with a [s]helalah in his hand, who could repel occa[s]ional in[s]ults. So far the[s]e [s]u[s]picions appeared to be without foundation; the officer having conspicuously traver[s]ed the di[s]trict, and opened an office without mole[s]tation. The Captain was now about to return home, having [s]een the e[s]tabli[s]hment of his ward in an office under government. But before he parted with him, he thought it not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-599.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] not ami[s]s to give him le[s][s]ons with regard to the di[s]charge of his duty in his pre[s]ent appointment. With this view, drawing him into a walk the [s]econd day, a [s]mall di[s]tance from the village, he began his lecture in the following words: Teague, [s]aid he, for I am [s]till in the habit of giving you that appellation, not having yet a[s]certained whether you are to be [s]tiled, your wor[s]hip, your honour, or your reverence; or at lea[s]t not having yet been accu[s]tomed to add the[s]e epithets; Teague, I [s]ay, you are now advanced to great dignity; a limb of the executive of the union. It is true, your department is mini[s]terial. Neverthele[s]s it requires the wi[s]dom of the head to conduct it. But the integrity of the heart is the great object to be regarded. Keep your hands from bribes; and by a delicate impartiality towards all, even from the suspicion of taking them. I [s]hould regret indeed after all the pains I have taken in [s]itting you for an office, and contributing to your appointment, to hear of an impeachment again[s]t you, for a misdemeanor in that office. By conducting yourself with a [s]crupulous honour and pure morality in your pre[s]ent tru[s]t, the way is open [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-600.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] open to a higher grade of advancement; and there is no kind of doubt, but that in due time it will be attainable. The President of the United States, from whom you have received your commi[s][s]ion, is [s]aid to have the virtue, or rather the exce[s]s of one, never to abandon the per[s]on whom he has once taken up; or at lea[s]t to carry his attachment to an extreme of reluctance in that particular; whether owing to great [s]lowne[s]s in conceiving unfavourably of any one; or to pride of mind, in an unwillingness to have it thought that his judgment could be fallible. You will have an advantage here; but at the [s]ame time there is an ultimate point in this, as in all things, beyond which it is impo[s][s]ible to pre[s]erve a man. Bear this in mind, and be hone[s]t, attentive, and faithful in your duty, and let it be [s]aid of you, that you have [s]hewn your[s]elf a good citizen. Ju[s]t at this in[s]tant a noi[s]e was heard, and, looking up, a crowd of people were di[s]covered at a con[s]iderable di[s]tance, advancing towards them, but with acclamations that began to be heard. They were dragging a piece of timber of con[s]iderable length, which appeared to be ju[s]t hewn from the woods; and was the natural [s]tem of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-601.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] of a [s]mall tree, cut down from the [s]tump, and the bark [s]tripped off. At the [s]ame time a couple of pack-hor[s]es were driven along, which appeared to be loaded with beds, and pillow ca[s]es. The Captain was led to believe that the[s]e were a number of the country people, who having heard of the revenue officer coming to his di[s]trict, had come forward to pay their re[s]pects to him, and to receive him with that gratulation which is common to hone[s]t but illiterate people, in the fir[s]t paroxy[s]ms of their tran[s]port. Having under[s]tood that country to be chiefly peopled with the de[s]cendants of the Iri[s]h, or with Iri[s]h emigrants them[s]elves, he had [s]uppo[s]ed that hearing the new officer was a countryman, they had been carried forward, with [s]uch zeal to receive him, with huzzaing and tumult. On this occa[s]ion, he thought it not ami[s]s to turn the conver[s]ation; and to prepare the mind and the manners of the deputy for this [s]cene, which being unu[s]ual, might disconcert and embarra[s]s him. Teague, [s]aid he, it is not le[s]s difficult to pre[s]erve equanimity in a pro[s]perous situation, than to [s]u[s]tain with fortitude a depression of fortune. The[s]e people, I perceive, ceive, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-602.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] ceive, in a flow of mind are coming forward, to expre[s]s, with warmth, the honest, but irregular [s]allies of their joy, on your arrival among[s]t them. It was u[s]ual in the provinces under the Roman republic, when a Que[s]tor, of whom a favourable impre[s][s]ion had preceded, was about to come among[s]t them. It is a plea[s]ing, but a tran[s]ient felicity, and a wi[s]e man will not count too much upon it. For popular favour is un[s]table to a proverb. The[s]e very people in the cour[s]e of a twelve-month, if you di[s]plea[s]e them, may [s]hout as loud at your degradation, and removal from dignity. At the [s]ame time, this ought not to lead you to be indifferent, or at lea[s]t to [s]eem [s]o, to their well-meant expressions of favour at pre[s]ent; much le[s]s to affect a contempt, or even a neglect of them. A medium of ea[s]e and gracefulne[s]s in receiving their advance, and an[s]wering their addre[s]s, whether it be a ru[s]tic orator in an extempore harrangue, or [s]ome [s]cholar of the academy, or [s]chool-ma[s]ter, they may have have prevailed upon to draw up a [s]peech, and read it to you. There is no manner of doubt, but the Pre[s]ident of the United States, may have been a thousand times embarra[s][s]ed with the multitude of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-603.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] of addre[s][s]es delivered, or pre[s]ented, to him; and it required no [s]mall patience and fortitude to [s]u[s]tain them. Yet it has been remarked, that he has received them all with complacency; [s]hewing him[s]elf neither elevated with the prai[s]e, nor irritated with the intru[s]ion. And it is but rea[s]onable, and what a benevolent man would indulge; for it is a happine[s]s to the[s]e creatures, to give them[s]elves the opportunity of being di[s]tingui[s]hed in this manner. Duncan who had heard a rumour in the village of what was going forward, had in the mean time come up, and understanding from the la[s]t words of the Captain what had been the drift of his conver[s]ation with Teague, and di[s]covering his mi[s]take, interrupted him at this place. Captain, [s]aid he, ye need na be cow[s]huning him against applau[s]e, and popularity, and the turning o' the head, wi' prai[s]e, and guid u[s]age: for I doubt muckle if it comes to that wi' him yet. I wad rather [s]u[s]pect that the[s]e folks have na guid will towards him. I dinna ken what they mean to do wi' him, but if a body might gue[s]s frae the bed ye [s]ee there on the poney's back, they mean to to[s]s him in a blanker. But if it were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-604.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] were to be judged frae the tree they hae trailing after them, I wad [s]uppo[s]e they mean to make a hanging matter o' it, and take his life a' the gether. There is na doubt but they are coming in a mob, to make a [s]eizure o' the gauger, and the talk o' the town is o' a puni[s]hment I dinna under[s]tand, o' tarring and feathering. I have heard o' the [s]tocks, and the gallows, and drowning like a witch, but I never heard o' the like o' that in Scotland. I have heard o' tarring the [s]heep, to keep them frae the rot, but I never heard o' tarring a human creature. May be they mean to put it on his no[s]e, to hinder him frae smelling their whi[s]key. I [s]ee they got a keg o't there in their rear, drawn upon a [s]led; at lea[s]t, I [s]uppo[s]e it to be whi[s]ky they hae in that keg, to take a dram, as they gae on wi the frolic; unle[s]s it be the tar that they talk of to put upon the officer. This la[s]t conjecture was the true one. For it was tar; and the [s]tem of a tree which they drew, was what is called a liberty pole, which they were about to erect, in order to dance round it, with hallooing, and the whoop of exultation. The calvacade now approaching, they began [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-605.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] began to ca[s]t their eyes towards the groupe of the three as they [s]tood together. By de holy faders, [s]aid Teague, I [s]ee de have deir looks upon me. De look as wild as de White Boys, or de Hearts of Oak in Ireland. By de holy apo[s]tles, dere is no fighting wid pitch forks; we [s]hall be kilt, and murdered into de bargain. Teague, [s]aid the Captain, recollect that you are an officer of government, and it becomes you to [s]upport its dignity, not betraying unmanly fear, but [s]u[s]taining the violence even of a mob it[s]elf with fortitude. Fait, and I had rader be no officer at all, [s]aid Teague, if dis is de way de paple get out o' dair [s]en[s]es in dis country. Take de office your[s]helf; the devil burn me, but I [s]hall be after laying it down, as fa[s]t as I ever took it up, if dis is to come of it; to be hooted at like a wild ba[s]te, and [s]hot, and hanged upon a tree, like a [s]quirrel, or a Pady from Cork, when de fooli[s]h boys hang him upon the 17th of March, with potatoes about his neck, to make [s]un o' de Iri[s]h. I [s]corn to be choaked before I am dead; de devil burn de office for me, I'l have none of it. I can take my Bible oath, and [s]wear upon de holy cro[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-606.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] cro[s]s, dat I am no officer. By [s]haint Patrick, and ifdere are any Iri[s]h boys, among[s]t dem I would rather join wid dem. What is de government with offices to a [s]on o'd a whore dat is choaked, and cannot [s]pake to his acquaintance in dis world. By de holy, apo[s]tles, I am no officer; I ju[s]t took it for, a frolic as I was coming up de road, and; you may be officer your[s]elf, and good luck wid de commi[s][s]ion, Captain; I [s]hall have noting to do wid it. At this in[s]tant the advancing croud; rai[s]ed a loud [s]hout, crying, Liberty and no exci[s]e, liberty and no exci[s]e; down with all exci[s]e officers  . Teague began to tremble, and to [s]culk behind the Captain. By de holy vater o' de confe[s][s]ion, [s]aid he, dey are like de favages, dey have deir eyes upon me, I [s]hall be [s]calped; I [s]hall be kilt and have de hair off my head, like a wolf or a [s]hape. God love you, Captain, [s]pake a good word to dem, and tell dem a good [s]tory; or by de Chri[s]tian church, I [s]hall be eat up like a toad, or a wild ba[s]te in de fore[s]ts. The bog-trotter was right; for this moment, they had got their eyes upon the groupe; and began to di[s]tingui[s]h him as the officer of the revenue. An exact description- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-607.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] [s]cription had been given them, of his person and appearance; for the[s]e people had their corre[s]pondents, even at the feat of government; and travellers, moreover, had recogni[s]ed him, and given an account of his phy[s]iognomy, and apparel. There he is, there he is, was the language; the re[s]cally exci[s]e officer; we [s]hall [s]oon take care of him. He is of the name of O'Regan, is he? We [s]hall O'Regan him in a [s]hort time. The devil burn me, if I am de exci[s]e officer, [s]aid Teague. It is all a mi[s]take gentlemen. It is true I was offered the commi[s][s]ion; but the Captain here knows dat I would not take it. It is dis Scotchman that is the officer. By my [s]houl, you may tar and feather him, and welcome. No, [s]aid the Captain [s]tepping forward, no, gentlemen: for [s]o I yet call you; though the menaces which you expre[s]s, and the appearance of force which your preparations exhibit, depart from the desert of that appelation. Neverthele[s]s, as there is [s]till a probability of arre[s]ting violence, and reclaiming you from the error of your meditated acts, I addre[s]s you with the epithet of gentlemen. You are not mi[s]taken in your de[s]ignation of the officer of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-608.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] of the revenue, though he has not the cundour, to avow him[s]elf; but would meanly [s]ubject a fellow bog-trotter to the odium and the ri[s]k; an act of which, after all the pains that have been taken of his education, to impre[s]s him with sentiments of truth and honour, I am greatly a[s]hamed. No, Gentlemen, I am unwilling to deceive you, or that the meditated injury [s]hould fall on him, who if he has not the honour of the office, ought not to bear the occa[s]ional di[s]advantage: I am ready to acknowledge and avow, nor [s]hall the[s]e wry faces, and contor[s]ions of body, which you ob[s]erve in the red-headed man, prevent me; that he is the bona fide, actual exci[s]e officer. Neverthele[s]s, gentlemen, let me expo[s]tulate with you on his behalf. Let me endeavour to [s]ave him from your odium, not by fal[s]ehood, but by rea[s]on. Is it not a principle of that republican government which you have e[s]tabli[s]hed, that the will of the majority [s]hall govern; and has not the will of the majority of the United States enacted this law? will--- By this time, they had [s]unk the but end of the [s]apling in the hole dug for it, and it [s]tood erect with a flag di[s]played in the air, and was called a Liberty Pole. The beds [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-609.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] beds, and pillow ca[s]es had been cut open, and were brought forward. A committee had been appointed to conduct the operation. It was while they were occupied in doing this, that the Captain had without interruption gone on in making his harangue. But the[s]e things being now adjusted, a principal per[s]on of the committee came forward, ju[s]t at the la[s]t words of the Captain. The will of the majority, [s]aid he; yes, faith; the will of the majority [s]hall govern. It is right that it [s]hould be the ca[s]e. We know the exci[s]e officer very well. Come lay hands upon him. Guid folk, [s]aid Duncan, I am no the gauger, it is true; nor am I a friend to the exci[s]e law, though I came in company wi' the officer; neverthele[s]s I dinna approve o' this, o' your dinging down the government. For what is it but dinging down the government to act again[s]t the laws. Did ye never read i' the Bible, that rebellion is war[s]e than witchcraft? Did ye never read o' how many lairds, and dukes, were hanged in Scotland lang ago, for rebellion? when the government comes to take this up, ye [s]al all be made out rebels, and hanged. Ye had better think what ye [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-610.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] ye are about. Ye dinna gie fair play. If ye want to fight, and ony o' ye will turn out wi' me, I [s]hall take a turn wi' him; and no ju[s]t jump upon a man a' in ae lump, like a parcel o' tinklers at a fair. The committee had paid no attention to this harangue; but had in the mean time [s]eized Teague, and conveyed him to a cart, in which the keg of tar had been placed. The operation had commenced amid[s]t the vociferation of the bog-trotter, cro[s][s]ing him[s]elf, and preparing for purgatory. They had [s]tripped him of his ve[s]tments, and pouring the tar upon his naked body, emptied at the [s]ame time a bed of feathers on his head, which adhering to the vi[s]cous fluid, gave him the appearance of a wild fowl of the fore[s]t. The cart being driven off with the pri[s]oner in this [s]tate, a great part of the mob accompanied, with the u[s]ual exclamation of "Liberty, and no exci[s]e law. Down with all exci[s]e officers."

It is time now to make [s]ome reflections, were it not only for the [s]ake of form; ju[s]t as the clergyman who divides his text into [s]everal heads, and then adds, "we [s]hall conclude with an improvement of the whole; or with a few practical observations, or reflections." In early life, when long [s]ermons tired me, the young mind not capable of a long attention, I u[s]ed to look out for this peroratory part of the di[s]cour[s]e, with much anxiety; not that I valued it more than any other, for the intrin[s]ic worth of it; but merely because it was the la[s]t. It appeared to me an uncon[s]cionable thing in a man to [s]peak too long, when it was left to him[s]elf how long he [s]hould [s]peak. Ah! if it was known how many cur[s]es I have given tedious [s]peakers even in the pulpit it[s]elf, in my time, I [s]hould be thought a very wick- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-612.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] wicked man. Perhaps [s]ome may think that I am a tedious writer. Well; but have not readers it in their power to lay down the book when they think proper, and begin again? But as I was [s]aying, it has become time to make [s]ome reflections, of which it mu[s]t be acknowledged, I have been [s]paring in this the latter part of my performance. But upon what [s]hall I reflect? The vanity of things, doubtle[s]s. But in what mode [s]hall I pre[s]ent this vanity? In moralizing on the di[s]appointment of the Captain and the revenue officer, with the waiting man Duncan Fergu[s]on, coming forward to e[s]tabli[s]h offices, and all at once made pri[s]oners, and treated as the meane[s]t culprits? or [s]hall it be on the mi[s]taken patrioti[s]m of even good, though uninformed men, oppo[s]ing an obnoxious, and unequal law, not by remon[s]trance, but by actual force, and thereby [s]apping all principle, or rather overthrowing all [s]tructure of a republican government. No: the[s]e are exhau[s]ted topics. I [s]hall rather content my[s]elf at pre[s]ent, with a differtation, on that mode of di[s]grace, or puni[s]hment, which was cho[s]en in the ca[s]e of the revenue officer; tarring and feathering. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-613.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] I find no trace of this mode of punishment among[s]t the ancients, I mean the Greeks, Hebrews, and Romans. Having had occa[s]ion lately to look over the whole book of Deuteronomy, I have paid attention to this particular, and have discovered no ve[s]tige of it. Among[s]t the Greeks, [s]o far as my memory [s]erves me, there is nothing like it. I recollect well the [s]anctions of criminal law among[s]t the Romans. And what appears to me to come near[s]t to this of tarring and feathering, is the puni[s]hment of the [s]ewing up the culprit in a [s]ack, with an ape, a [s]erpent, and a fox; and throwing him into a river, or a balon of the [s]ea, to drown, if he had escaped death by his companions in the mean time. As to the origin of tarring and feathering, I am at a lo[s]s to [s]ay. It would [s]eem to me, that it took its ri[s]e in the town of Bofton, ju[s]t before the commencement of the American revolution. Unless, indeed, it [s]hould be contended that Nebuchadnezzar was tarred and feathered; of which I am not per[s]uaded; becau[s]e tho' it is [s]aid that "his nails had grown to eagles claws," and in that ca[s]e pre[s]enting the talons of a bird, which a tarred and fea- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-614.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] feathered man re[s]embles, yet at the [s]am time it is added, he eat gra[s]s like an ox. Now a turkey buzzard, or a bald eagle, does not eat gra[s]s like an ox; nor do I know that the[s]e [s]owls eat gra[s]s at all, at lea[s]t [s]o obviou[s]ly as to make the eating gra[s]s a di[s]tingui[s]hing characteri[s]tic of their nature. I [s]hall therefore give up the hypothe[s]is of Nebuchadnezzar being tarred and feathered. It would appear to me to be what may be called a revolutionary puni[s]hment, beyound what in a [s]ettled [s]tate of the government may be inflicted by the opprobrium of opinion; and yet [s]hort of the coercion of the laws. It was in this middle [s]tare, that it took it's ri[s]e with us; an[s]wering the [s]ame end, but with a more mild operation, than that of the lantern, at the commencement of the revolution in France. It took ri[s]e in the [s]ea coa[s]t towns in America; and I would [s]uppo[s]e it to be owing to [s]ome accidental conjunction of the seamen and the citizens, devi[s]ing a mode of puni[s]hment for a per[s]on obnoxious. The [s]ailors naturally thought of tar, and the women, who u[s]ed to be a[s][s]i[s]ting on the[s]e occa[s]ions, thought of bol[s]ters and pillowcases. Let [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-615.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] Let it [s]uffice that I have [s]ugge[s]ted the que[s]tion, and leave it to be [s]ettled by [s]ome other per[s]on, at [s]ome future period. WITH regard to Teague whom we left in the hands of the unob, having been carted about the village, until the eyes of all were [s]atiated with the spectacle, he was di[s]mi[s][s]ed, but ordered to depart from what was called the [s]urvey, under the penalty of being [s]eized again, and hanged on the liberty pole, to which they pointed at the [s]ame time, and on which there was a cro[s]s bar, which appeared to render it convenient for that purpo[s]e. The unfortunate officer was not [s]low to take the hint, but as [s]oon as he was out of their hands, made his way to the wilderness. There we [s]hall leave him for the pre[s]ent, and return to the Captain, whom we left in the village, and who had been employed during the occa[s]ion, rea[s]oning with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-616.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] with the people, and endeavouring fir[s]t to divert them from the outrage, and afterwards to convince them of the error of it, and the danger of the consequences. In[s]tead of allaying their fervour, and convincing their judgments, it had begun to provoke, and irritate exceedingly; and gave birth to [s]urmi[s]es that he was an accomplice of the exci[s]e officer, which in a [s]hort time grew into a rumour, that he meant to continue the in[s]pection office, and [s]ub[s]titute the North Briton as a deputy in the room of O'Regan, until his return. Under this impre[s][s]ion, a[s][s]embling next day, they proceeded to pull down the in[s]pection office altogether, and to enquire for the Captain and his valet, that they might tar and feather them al[s]o. The Captain having had a hint of this, and judging from the experiment he had made, that it was in vain to oppo[s]e the violence of the people, outrather to yield to it for the pre[s]ent, thought proper to withdraw from the village for a time, and take his rout to wards the mountains, where he might remain at [s]ome farm hou[s]e, until a more peaceable [s]tate of things [s]hould take place. He had travelled the greater part of the day, and towards evening when he began to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-617.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] to think of taking quarters for the night, he came to a narrow valley at the foot of the mountain, with a [s]mall, but a clear and rapid [s]tream running through the valley, which had the appearance in [s]ome parts of a natural meadow, there being intervals of gra[s]s plats of con[s]iderable extent, with hazel cop[s]es, and groupes of young trees. The tall timber on the height above, formed an agreeable [s]hade, and ledges of [s]tone, worn [s]mooth by the water in [s]ome places, making [s]mall but perpendicular falls in the current of the water. Di[s]mounting, and delaying a little in this [s]pot, to let the hor[s]e take a mouthful of the gra[s]s, and deliberating whether if no habitation appeared, it might not be agreeable enough to take a bed there on the natural [s]ward for the night; having a [s]mall quantity of provi[s]ions in Duncan's wallet, and a fla[s]k of whi[s]key, which they haltily put up at [s]etting out. At this in[s]tant, an aged and venerable looking man de[s]cended from the mountain, with a [s]lender and delicately formed young lad accompanying him, having on his [s]houlder the carca[s]e of a racoon, which he held by the hinder feet, and which ably [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-618.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] probably had been cut out of a hollow tree, or taken in a trap, that afternoon. The Captain thought with him[s]elf, that he would have no great objection to have an invitation from the old man and his [s]on, as he [s]uppo[s]ed him to be, to go home with them, and lodge for the night; taking it for granted from the appearance of understanding in the countenance, that they were of a grade of education above the bulk of the people of that country. It [s]o happened, after explanation had taken place, that he did receive an invitation, and went home with them. The re[s]idence was romantic, [s]ituate on a [s]mall eminence on the north [s]ide of the valley which running ea[s]t and we[s]t, the [s]un [s]truck it with his fir[s]t beams, and the zephyrs, playing in the direct line of their cour[s]e, fanned it in the [s]ummer heats. A [s]mall ca[s]cade at a little di[s]tance, with a sandy bottom, afforded a delightful bathing place; and the murmur of the falling water, in the [s]ilence of the night, was favourable to [s]leep. It was a cabbin of an oblong figure, perhaps twenty by twelve feet, con[s]i[s]ting of two apartments, the one [s]mall, and serving as a kitchen, the other an[s]wering the pur- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-619.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] purpo[s]es of hall, parlour, and bed room.--- The family con[s]i[s]ted of the old man, the young lad his [s]on, and an attendant who acted as cook, butler, and valet de chambre. Duncan having rubbed and combed the Captain's hor[s]e, and turned him loo[s]e to eat, was [s]towed away in the kitchen, while the racoon was barbecued for supper, and the Captain with the ho[s]t, and his [s]on, were pur[s]uing the explanation of what they re[s]pectively were; being yet in a great degree unknown to each other. It appeared that the old man was the Marquis de Marne[s][s]ie, who had been an emigrant from France, a [s]hort time after the commencement of the pre[s]ent revolution, and had [s]erved [s]ome time in a corps of 10,000 men, which had been formed of the nobility, under the combined princes, again[s]t the republic. Having been under the nece[s][s]ity of abandoning his [s]eats with precipitation, he had been able to carry with him, but a few thou[s]and livres. The[s]e had been reduced in [s]upporting him[s]elf and friends in the [s]ervice, and he had brought but a few hundred to America This country he had been led to [s]eek, di[s]gu[s]ted with the combined powers, when the stipulations of the convention of Pilnitz, began to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-620.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] to tran[s]pire, and the object appeared to be, not [s]o much to [s]upport the monarchy, as to divide the country: chagrined al[s]o with that neglect, and even contumely, experienced from the German princes who appeared to think with contempt of their [s]ervices, and to repo[s]e their confidence alone, in their own forces, and di[s]cipline. Coming to America, he had retired from the [s]ea coa[s]t, both to be out of the way of the French democrats in the towns, and in order to occupy a le[s]s expen[s]ive re[s]idence. He had found this valley unappropriated by the [s]tate, a warrant for an hundred acres of which he obtained from the land office, at the low rate of fifty [s]hillings; and having cleared a [s]mall [s]pot, had made a garden, and cultivated what is called a patch of Indian corn, [s]ub[s]i[s]ting and amu[s]ing him[s]elf and his family, chiefly by trapping and hunting in the neighbouring mountain; wi[s]hing to forget his former feelings, and to live upon the earth as regardle[s]s of its troubles as if buried under it. His cabbin was neat and clean, with flooring of [s]plit timber, and [s]tools made out of hewn logs. A few books, and half a dozen [s]mall paintings, a fuzee, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-621.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] and an old [s]word, being the only ornament of its walls. Having [s]upped on the barbecuedracoon, they took bed upon the planks, each furnished with a blanket, being the only matress, or covering with which they were provided. A great deal of conver[s]ation had pa[s][s]ed in the cour[s]e of the evening; and considerable [s]ympathy of mind had taken place on the part of the Marquis towards the Captain, con[s]idering him in the light of an emigrant with him[s]elf, having been obliged to ab[s]cond, from [s]ans cullotte rage, and popular [s]ervor, which though not of the [s]ame height with that in France, yet was of the [s]ame nature, and different only in degree. The invitation was given by the Marquis, and accepted on the part of the Captain, and to remain in that retirement for [s]ome weeks, until matters were compo[s]ed, and it might be [s]afe for him to take his way again through the country, and return to his dwelling. Duncan took care of the hor[s]e, chopped wood, carried water, and a[s][s]i[s]ed the French valet to barbecue racoons, young bears, [s]quirrels, phea[s]ants, partridges, and other game, that the traps [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-622.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] traps, or fuzee and dog, of the Marquis and his [s]on, accompanied by the Captain, could procure. Much conver[s]ation passed in the mean time, on the affairs of France; [s]ometimes [s]itting on a rock on the [s]ide of the mountain, or under the [s]hade of an elm tree in the gra[s][s]y valley; or walking out to [s]et a trap; at other times, in an evening in the cabbin, when they had returned from the labour or amu[s]ements of the day. The[s]e conver[s]ations were chiefly in the French language, which the Captain [s]poke very well; but in relating any particulars of that conver[s]ation, we [s]hall give it in Engli[s]h, to [s]ave the printer the trouble of having it tran[s]lated. And we [s]hall confine our[s]elves to a very few particulars, meaning rather to ha[s]ten to the action of the work, than to delay the reader in an epi[s]ode, longer than is absolutely nece[s][s]ary to let [s]ome things be matured, that are next to take place. CHAP [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-623.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] IT was one of tho[s]e temperate and pleasant evenings which in this climate succeed the autumnal equinox, that the Marquis and the Captain walking out together, the [s]ubject of the conver[s]ation happened to be the right of the people of France to overthrow the monarchy, and e[s]tabli[s]h a republic. The Captain had read the pamphlets of Thomas Paine, entitled, "Rights of Man," and was a good deal di[s]po[s]ed to [s]ab[s]cribe to the elementary principles of that work; a leading doctrine of which is, that at no time can the pact or cu[s]toms of ance[s]tors fore[s]tall or take away the right of de[s]cendants to frame whatever kind of government they think proper. This mu[s]t be under[s]tood, [s]aid the Marquis, like mo[s]t other general propo[s]itions, with [s]ome limitation, or exceptions; or at lea[s]t [s]ome explanation, before the mind of all, at lea[s]t of mine, can acquie[s]ce in the de- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-624.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] deductions. It may ea[s]ily be [s]uppo[s]ed that I am not a proper per[s]on to canva[s]s this [s]ubject, having been of that cla[s]s of men, who had all to lo[s]e, and nothing to gain, by a revolution in the government of the country where I lived. Neverthele[s]s, if my feelings do not deceive me, I ought not to be con[s]idered as a per[s]on under great prejudices. For it [s]eems to me, that I am detached from the world, and never more expecting to be re[s]tored to my country, [s]o as to live in it with reputation, or even with safety, I am like a per[s]on with all his [s]en[s]es awake, and within a few [s]econds of death; his vanity is a[s]leep, his pride is gone; he looks back upon his pur[s]uits, and his hopes with true philo[s]ophy, and makes a proper e[s]timate of all the acqui[s]itions, and all the enjoyments of life. Or rather, I may be thought to re[s]emble a di[s]embodied [s]pirit, who no longer capable of enjoying the fal[s]e glories of life, is not liable to be [s]educed by the appearance of them. The [s]hades of departed men in the ely[s]ian fields as imagined by the ancients, and painted by the poets, cannot be more ab[s]tracted from former impre[s][s]ions, than I feel my[s]elf to be, in this kind of ely[s]ian, and posthumous valley. When I conver[s]e with you who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-625.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] who have come from the world, and may return to it, I am in the [s]ituation of the Grecian worthies defunct of life, when visited by Uly[s][s]es. Achilles candidly acknowledged to him, that he had rather live as a hired labourer with a poor man, who had little food, than to rule over all the gho[s]ts. I will in like manner declare, that [s]uch is my predilection for my country, and that ravi[s]hing delight which I would take, in breathing my native air, and feeing my native [s]oil, looking at the buildings which were accu[s]tomed to [s]trike my eyes in better days, that I would prefer fi[s]hing along the [s]treams for my precarious and daily food, or digging the [s]oil, and procuring my [s]ub[s]i[s]tence with a pea[s]ant, than to be the Pre[s]ident of the United States, deprived of the countenance of my countrymen, and the view of that other heavens, and that other earth. The contempt that I may have entertained, or at lea[s]t the undervaluing in[s]perable from my [s]ituation, which I may have felt, for the undignifyed with nobility among[s]t us, is totally gone: I could lay my[s]elf down, with the meane[s]t plebian, and call him my brother. De[s]cent, title, and fortune, have di[s]appeared from the eyes, and I fee [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-626.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] [s]ee nothing but man, in his rude and original excellence, as a conver[s]ing and sociable animal. Neverthele[s]s, even in this [s]tate of mind, I cannot wholly [s]ub[s]cribe to the analy[s]is of Paine. Let us examine his po[s]ition. The new born infant has a right to a [s]upport from its ance[s]tor, until it [s]hall be of years to provide for it[s]elf; but has it a right to his e[s]tate after it [s]hall have been of a mature age? [s]urely not a natural right; nor a right [s]anctioned in all ca[s]es even by the municipal law; for the ancestor may alien, or devi[s]e away from the heir. But if he claims as heir, or takes by devi[s]e, is it not under the artificial establishment of [s]ociety, that he makes this claim, or takes this gift? [s]hall he not then take this e[s]tate [s]ubject to that government in the principle and form of it, under which this e[s]tate was acquired, and by which it is pre[s]erved to him? The civil relations that exi[s]t from the aggregate to him, are a law, as well as the relations that exi[s]t from individuals. Suppo[s]e all minors of age at one hour, and all ance[s]tors ju[s]t departed at the [s]ame moment, there might be [s]ome rea[s]on then in [s]uppo[s]ing that the de[s]cendants were not bound by the er [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-627.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] former e[s]tabli[s]hments, but were at liberty to introduce others; or the de[s]cendants emigrating, and occupying a new [s]oil, are certainly at liberty to frame new structures: But not while a [s]ingle ance[s]tor exists, who has an intere[s]t in the old mansion hou[s]e, and is attached to the building, however Gothic; becau[s]e the ance[s]tor had this right before the minor was born, and his birth could not take it away. I [s]ay, then, contrary to the principle of Paine, that our ance[s]tors having e[s]tabli[s]hed an hereditary monarchy, it is not in the power of the de[s]cendants to change it. They may remove from under it, if they will, but not pull the hou[s]e down about our heads. The early feudali[s]t, who[s]e acqui[s]itions, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of them, depended on that military [s]ubordination and tenure which gave ri[s]e to the [s]y[s]tem, when he took his place in it either as a che[s]tain, or a vassal, [s]ubmitted to it; he had his voice in this [s]ocial compact; and [s]hall his de[s]cendant be allowed to unhinge the tenure, and change the fabric which was not of his building? [s]hall he claim the advantages of that [s]pecies of government to which he has been introduced, and not [s]ubmit to the qual- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-628.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] inequalities of it? or [s]hall it be changed but by univer[s]al con[s]ent? [s]hall even a majority change it? No: becau[s]e each individual is, in the language of the law, a joint tenant, and has a right, per my & per tant, in the part, and in the whole. It can no more take away the right an individual has in the [s]y[s]tem of government, than the right he has in his e[s]tate, held by a prior law. Upon inve[s]tigation, it will be found a que[s]tion more of power than of right; ju[s]t as in the[s]e woods, I take the racoons and rabbits, not that I conceive my[s]self to have any right to have come from the banks of the Loire to make the[s]e depredations, but that having come, I have the [s]kill to do it. The Captain was led to [s]mile at the[s]e la[s]t words of the Marquis, as favouring of misanthropy, equalizing the ca[s]e of brute animals with men. I can ea[s]ily excu[s]e, [s]aid the Captain, this [s]ally of your mind, and mu[s]t re[s]olve it into the wounds your feelings have received from the rever[s]e of your fortune, and the dreadful outrages which have taken place, in the cour[s]e of the revolution, from the fury of the human mind. Nor would I call in que[s]tion wholly the ju[s]tne[s]s of your po[s]ition, with regard to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-629.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] to the right of changing a mode of government. Neverthele[s]s, it may admit of [s]ome di[s]cu[s][s]ion in the generality, and be [s]o bounded as to leave [s]ome great ca[s]es out of the rule. I grant you that the descendant, on the principle of natural right, can claim nothing more of the per[s]onal labour of the ance[s]tor, or of his e[s]tate, than support, until he [s]hall be of an age which gives [s]trength of mind and body to enable him to provide for him[s]elf. But does he not po[s][s]e[s]s by his birth, a right to [s]o much of the [s]oil as is nece[s][s]ary for his [s]ub[s]i[s]tence? you will [s]ay he may emigrate. But suppose all adjoining known lands already peopled; he cannot emigrate without committing inju[s]tice upon others. He mu[s]t therefore remain. How to preclude him from all right to think, or act in affairs of government, with a view to improve, and to improve is to change, is restraining the mind of man, in a particular capable of the greate[s]t extent, and upon which depends, more than on all things el[s]e, the perfection of our [s]pecies. I would put it upon this point; is it conducive to an amelioration of the [s]tate of life, and likely to produce a greater [s]um of happiness, to innovate upon e[s]tabli[s]hed forms, or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-630.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] or to let them remain? It is true, indeed, that when we con[s]ider the throws and convul[s]ions with which a change in government is u[s]ually attended, it ought not to be lightly attempted; and nothing but an extreme nece[s][s]ity for a reform can ju[s]tify it. It is almo[s]t as impo[s][s]ible, comparing a phy[s]ical with a moral difficulty, to change a government from de[s]poti[s]m to liberty, without violence, as to di[s]lodge a promontory from its ba[s]e, by any other means, than mining and gunpowder. Of that I am convinced, [s]aid the Marquis; for there never was a people more generally di[s]po[s]ed to a degree of reform, than the people of France, at the commencement of the revolution. The writings of philo[s]ophers had prevaded the minds of the highe[s]t orders, and it had become the pa[s][s]ion of the times to lean towards a certain extent of liberty. It had become the wi[s]h of the good, and the humour of the weak, to advance the condition of the pea[s]antry. As an in[s]tance of this, I my[s]elf had written a book, entitled, " Sur le bonheur de Campagne, " with the expre[s]s view of depicting the depre[s][s]ed situation of the common people in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-631.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] country, and the means of rai[s]ing them from that condition. But a reform once begun, it was found impo[s][s]ible to arre[s]t it at a middle point. It may be re[s]olved into a thou[s]and cau[s]es, but the great cau[s]e was, the in[s]atiable nature of the human mind, that will not be contented with what is moderate. For though there were doubtle[s]s a con[s]iderable portion of the nobility who were oppo[s]ed to any diminution of their power and pageantry; yet, on the other hand, as great an evil exi[s]ted in the wi[s]h of extreme equality in others; or rather, a wi[s]h to bring all things to a perfect level, that from thence they might begin to a[s]cend them[s]elves. There began to be in[s]incerity on the part of the court, and licentiou[s]ne[s]s on the part of the people; and finally a conte[s]t, lurid and dreadful, like the column of dark clouds edged with blue, and fraught with lightning. A conte[s]t [s]o terrible, that I have thought my[s]elf happy in e[s]caping from it, even though I have been obliged to call upon the rocks and the mountains to cover me in this valley. The above is a [s]ample of tho[s]e conversations which took place, between the Marquis and the Captain, during the [s]pace of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-632.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] of [s]ome weeks which the Captain [s]pent in this rural and ob[s]cure rece[s]s. In the mean time, the Count, the [s]on of the Marquis, had been di[s]patched occa[s]ionally through the [s]ettlement, and to the village where the late outrage had been perpetrated, in order to learn what had become of the revenue officer, as al[s]o to a[s]certain the [s]late of the public mind, and when it might be [s]afe for the Captain to [s]hew himself in public, and return by the main road to his habitation. Nothing had been heard of O'Regan, but accounts the mo[s]t unfavourable were obtained of the di[s]po[s]ition of the people. The flame of oppo[s]ition had [s]pread generally, and the whole country appeared to be involved in a common burning. They had demoli[s]hed all in[s]pection hou[s]es, far and near; a[s][s]embled in committees, and framed re[s]olves of the utmo[s]t violence. The obnoxious were bani[s]hed; and even the lukewarm in the cau[s]e were threatened with the de[s]truction of their goods, and injury to their per[s]ons. They had begun to frame guillotines, and to talk of taking off the heads of traitors to the cau[s]e. The Captain was not a little alarmed at these [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-633.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] the[s]e proceedings; but the Marquis who had [s]een the machine of the guillotine in actual operation, was [s]eized with a horrid fear; and he almo[s]t imagined to him[s]elf that he [s]aw it moving of its own accord towards him; and his rea[s]on told him, that it was not all improbable but that it might be brought to approach him very [s]peedily, as the [s]ame [s]ans cullotte anarchy and violence began to [s]hew it[s]elf in the[s]e regions, as had broke out in France. IT may now be time to make [s]ome enquiry after the unfortunate exci[s]e officer, who had been treated in the manner we have mentioned. The evening the outrage had been committed on him, he had run [s]everal miles, naked as he was; if a man may be [s]aid to be naked, that is inve[s]ted with a layer of vi[s]cous fluid, and the adhe[s]ion of birds feathers to cover him; through much ger [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-634.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] danger from the country people, who were ill affected to his office: He had at length gained the rece[s][s]es of a fore[s]t, where he thought him[s]elf [s]afe for the night; until near morning, when the barking of wolves at no great di[s]tance, as he thought, led him to apprehend the being devoured by the[s]e animals, who might take him for an object of their prey. To e[s]cape this, he had thought it advi[s]eable to climb a [s]preading beech tree, and there remained until after [s]un ri[s]e, when two hunters coming along at that early hour, de[s]cried him among[s]t the branches; and not without much [s]urprize and a[s]toni[s]hment. At fir[s]t they took him for a bear; but [s]eeing the feathers, it was decided that he mu[s]t be of the fowl kind. Neverthele[s]s his face and form, which appeared to be human, made him a mon[s]ter in creation, or at lea[s]t a new [s]pecies of animal, never before known in the[s]e woods. They at fir[s]t he[s]itated whether to take him down by a [s]hot, or to pa[s]s on and leave him unmole[s]ted. But at length it was determined to pa[s]s on for the pre[s]ent, as if they had not [s]een him, and to rou[s]e the [s]ettlement, to take him with dogs, and the help of men. It would be a valuable ti- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-635.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] tiqui[s]ion to have [s]uch a creature to carry to the great towns for a [s]how. It might be a fortune to a man. This being resolved on, one of the hunters was di[s]patched to rou[s]e the [s]ettlement, while his comrade in the mean time, had taken his [s]tation on an eminence at no great di[s]tance, to watch the motions of the wild creature, and give information of his change of [s]ituation. The officer in much melancholy of mind had de[s]cended from the beech, and was sitting on the point of a rock, looking about him like a bald eagle, when a couple of [s]tout fellows came [s]uddenly behind him, with the folds of ropes, and entrapped his body, [s]o that he could not move his arms, which they took to be wings, but was as tightly laced as a [s]hip's yard arm, when the [s]ails are furled to prepare for a tempest. A cage having been made and put into the bed of a waggon, he was conveyed to the capital, when the proprietors, after having publi[s]hed an adverti[s]ement, began to exhibit him as a curio[s]ity, for the [s]um of a quarter dollar to each grown person, and an eighth of a dollar to the children of families who[s]e parents brought them with them. In [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-636.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] In a [s]hort time, this uncommon creature, as it was thought to be, became the [s]ubject of general conver[s]ation; and the Philo[s]ophical Society had heard of it. Having called a [s]pecial meeting, they dispatched two members to a[s]certain and report the nature of the animal, in a memoir to be in[s]erted in their tran[s]actions. The two members accordingly reque[s]ted of the proprietors an opportunity of a leisurely examination of the animal, and paid them a quarter dollar each extraordinary, for this indulgence. The proprietors were di[s]po[s]ed, as was natural, to a[s][s]i[s]t with [s]ome particulars of fiction, the [s]ingular qualities of the animal they had in charge. They related, that when they fir[s]t [s]aw it, in its flying from the mountain, it was ju[s]t alighting on the tree top; that having taken it, they had at fir[s]t offered it boiled and roa[s]ted fle[s]h, but this it refu[s]ed; but that at length it had come to eat fle[s]h both roa[s]ted and [s]odden with con[s]iderable gout, and [s]ometimes even with rapacity. This was fal[s]e, by the bye, for they had tried the officer with raw fle[s]h at fir[s]t, which he had refu[s]ed, and would eat only roa[s]ted or boiled. The proprietors informed, that when first [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-637.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] fir[s]t taken, its cries, or voice, was of a mixed [s]ound, between that of a wild cat and heron; but that it had come to have [s]ome imitation of the human voice, and even articulation, and might from that circum[s]tance be probably a [s]pecies of the parrot. The philo[s]ophers noted all this, and doubtle[s]s made a proper u[s]e of the particulars, in determining the genus of the animal. For the la[s]t thing that a virtuo[s]o ought to que[s]tion, is the truth of facts. It is by taking facts as granted, that an hypothesis is mo[s]t ea[s]ily e[s]tabli[s]hed. The tran[s]actions of the Society have not been yet publi[s]hed. Neverthele[s]s we have been favoured with the report of the members on this occa[s]ion, with leave to publi[s]h it, having [s]o immediate a relation to this work. It is as follows: "The animal of which an account is now to be given, was a[s]leep when we made our vi[s]it; and the keepers were unwilling to di[s]turb him, having been kept awake, they [s]aid, too much for [s]ome time pa[s]t, by the frequency of people coming to [s]ee him. However, this circum[s]tance gave us an opportunity which we would not otherwi[s]e have had, of ob[s]erving him while [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-638.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] while a[s]leep. He lay with his head upon his right [s]houlder, and his hinder legs, drawn up to his belly, in the manner of the dog, or bear. The drawing his breath, and his [s]noring, is that of a man. He has hair upon his head, with a mixture of feathers; but upon his body there is nothing but feathers, not in the manner of other fowls, if fowl this may be called, [s]mooth and clean, but growing through a vi[s]cous [s]ub[s]tance re[s]embling tar, and intermixed with it; in this particular differing from the bird kind in general, who by means of a [s]pinal gland [s]ecrete an oily [s]ub[s]tance, with which they be[s]mear and dre[s]s their feathers; for here the oily or vi[s]cous substance is it[s]elf mixed with the feathers, and oozing from the [s]kin. Nor are the feathers here, as in fowls in general, lying all one way, but in various directions, as if nature had given them to [s]prout out at random. But what is mo[s]t extraordinary, the [s]tems are frequently protruded, and the downy part in[s]erted in the [s]kin. Such were our ob[s]ervations while he lay a[s]leep. After half an hour the keepers having awaked him, he got up from his [s]traw by turning on his back, [s]tretching out his fore [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-639.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] fore legs, or wings, if they may be [s]o called, rai[s]ing him[s]elf on his rump, and then by re[s]ting on one paw, ri[s]ing with a [s]low and ea[s]y motion, to his feet. It may [s]eem a catachre[s]is in language to talk of the face of a bea[s]t; neverthele[s]s we [s]hall u[s]e this phra[s]e, for though in great part covered with feathers, and the [s]ame vi[s]cous matter with the body, yet in [s]hape it has the appearance of a human face, full as much or more, than the baboon, or others of the ape [s]pecies. It cannot be [s]aid to laugh, but rather grin, though once or twice in our pre[s]ence, you would have thought that it exhibited a dilatation of the o[s]cular mu[s]cles, as if attempting to laugh. The eye is of a grey colour, and the look wild, but [s]teady, like that of a person under an impre[s][s]ion of amazement and wonder. The neck, and whole form of the body, and even the hinder legs, have a [s]trong re[s]emblance of the human. Were it not for the feathers, a per[s]on on a [s]uperficial view might mi[s]take the wings for arms, being attached to the body by a [s]houlder blade, and the claws re[s]embling the fingers of a Negro. If this animal is to be referred to the quadruped, or bea[s]t kind, it would mo[s]t natur- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-640.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] naturally be cla[s][s]ed with the Ouran Outang, or Wild Man of Africa: If with the bird kind, we [s]hall be totally at a lo[s]s to a[s][s]ign the genus. For though it has a head and face not unlike the ouzel, or the grey owl, yet in the body it has no re[s]emblance. Neverthele[s]s we [s]hould certainly give it a place among[s]t fowls, were it not that it has ribs in[s]tead of the lamina, or [s]ide plates, which are peculiar to the winged race alone: as al[s]o, becau[s]e we have rea[s]on to think it has an epiglottis, from the articulation of its [s]ounds, by which it has come to imitate our [s]peech, with a pronunciation not unlike that kind of brogue, which we remark in [s]ome of the we[s]t country Iri[s]h. It appears to want the ingluvies or craw; but has a gizzard, and dige[s]ts its food by the dissolving power of the ga[s]tric juices. All things con[s]idered, we incline to think that it is an animal of a [s]pecies wholly new, and of a middle nature between a bird and a bea[s]t; yet [s]o widely differing from a bat, as not to be cla[s][s]ed with it. This di[s]covery leads to new and important con[s]iderations. We do not undertake to decide for the Society; but [s]hall venture to [s]ugge[s]t [s]ome particulars. this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-641.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] This animal would [s]eem to form the link between the brutal and the human species; being nearer to it in [s]ome particulars than the Ouran Outang it[s]elf; and e[s]pecially in the evident articulation of certain [s]ounds. Articulation was with the ancients, the di[s]tingui[s]hing characteristic of the human kind. The poet Homer has the epither frequently, Meropon, Antbropon:  articulate, [s]peaking men. Yet we find from this di[s]covery, that articulation, at lea[s]t to [s]ome extent, is not peculiar to man alone. This is an incidental characteri[s]tic, given by the poet; but the di[s]tingui[s]hing marks has been given with more [s]ubtilty of ob[s]ervation, by his [s]cholar Ari[s]totle, who[s]e definition is that of Animal bipes implumis . A two legged, unfeathered animal: For though it might be contended with [s]ome plau[s]ibility, that this animal has two legs; yet it is evidently feathered; not indeed with the long and [s]trong plumage of the o[s]trich, but with the down of a goo[s]e, or duck. This animal, like man, has not a tail. Nevertheless it has the os coccygis, or termination of the [s]pinal bone, longer than in man; as was a[s]certained by one of us, who in the interval of his [s]leeping, felt his rump. Not that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-642.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] that we would draw from this any conclusion in favour of the hypothe[s]is of Monboddo, that men had once tails; but that in the [s]cate of animals, there is a gradual nearing of di[s]tance, from having long tails, to the having no tail at all. The mo[s]t important enquiry comes now to be inve[s]tigated, namely, whether this be an animal new to di[s]covery, or actually new to the world, and ju[s]t lately come into exi[s]tence in the natural kingdom. No account of it having been heretofore given by any traveller in America, either from the information of the natives, or per[s]onal ob[s]ervation of their own, founds a [s]trong pre[s]umption that it is of a novel breed of creatures; but that it is prepared to pre[s]erve its [s]pecies, with a female, may be inferred, from the circumstance of nature having furni[s]hed it with te[s]ticles. The idea of original production, involves in it the late hypothe[s]is of Macilhattan, in his treati[s]e, De Seminibus, that nature has within her[s]e f an aboriginal productive power; [s]o that as [s]ome animals di[s]appear from the earth, the Mammoth for in[s]tance, others [s]pring up, that were never known before. Which hypothe[s]is, by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-643.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] by the bye, [s]o far as re[s]pects the extinction of animals, receives con[s]iderable countenance from the ancient relations of the gorgon, the hydra, &c. and the le[s]s remote allusions to winged gryphins, orchs, &c. If this [s]hould be found to be the fact, it may be [s]ugge[s]ted whether it would be going too far to [s]ay, that it might be in the compa[s]s of human re[s]earch, to di[s]cover the [s]ubtil combination of cau[s]es and effects, necessary to the production of life, and the formation of a living creature; and that the time might not be far di[s]tant, when ingenious chymi[s]ts might undertake and accomplish the analy[s]is of matter, and synthesis of compo[s]ition, [s]o as to be able to make animals, to tho[s]e who [s]hould bespeak them; as a workman would make articles of furniture for a hall or a[s][s]embly room. This would [s]ave much expence, in feeding, and providing them for food, or for the purpo[s]es of labour, and burdens. We have thought it [s]ufficient to [s]ugge[s]t this, and propo[s]e it to the indu[s]try and ingenuity of the learned in philo[s]ophic [s]cience." So far the memoir. The [s]ociety expre[s][s]ed their approbation of it; and it was propo[s]ed to make a purchase of this animal, for the purpo[s]e of ex- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-644.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] examining it more fully, in their own hall, and po[s][s]ibly of [s]ending it to the societies abroad, for their examination al[s]o. This propo[s]ition was adopted, and the [s]ame members appointed to drive a bargain with the proprietors, for the [s]ubject of their [s]hew. When the deputation came forward, and began to traffic with the keepers, proposing a purcha[s]e of the curio[s]ity in their po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, the revenue officer, in the cage ju[s]t by, rai[s]ed what is called the Irish howl, in a mo[s]t pitiable manner; recollecting what the Captain had told him, on a former occa[s]ion, with regard to the u[s]e to which they would apply him, when they [s]hould have him in their power. God love your [s]houls, my dear ma[s]ters, [s]aid he, that have taken me in the wild woods. I care not [s]at you make o'd me, a wild ba[s]te, or a turky buzzard; or a fi[s]h o'd de varer, while I gat good mate to ate, and clean [s]traw to ly down upon; but for the [s]ake o'd de holy fathers, do not [s]ell me to defe filo[s]ophers, that will cut me up as you would a dead cat, and put my [s]kin upon a pitchfork, ju[s]t to pla[s]e deir own fancies; rader let me [s]tay where I am, and [s]hew me to de good paple, dat gape [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-645.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] gape and [s]tare, but keep deir teeth in deir mouths, and luke fooli[s]h, but dont affer to bite. The philo[s]ophers a[s][s]ured him, that his apprehen[s]ions were without foundation; having not the lea[s]t intention of diffecting, at lea[s]t until he died a natural death. Doubtle[s]s, it might be an object, to ascertain from the internal [s]tructure of his body, to what genus or cla[s]s of animals he might belong: neverthele[s]s, they were per[s]uaded, the [s]ociety would content themselves, with the ob[s]ervations drawn from external [s]tructure, at lea[s]t for [s]ome time. On this turning round to the proprietors, they re[s]umed the conver[s]ation relative to a purcha[s]e; the [s]uppo[s]ed animal continuing to vociferate and roar horribly. In the mean time, the affair of this wild man, bea[s]t, bird, fi[s]h, or whatever it was, began to make a noi[s]e in the town; the people who had come to [s]ee it, being divided in opinion; [s]ome believing it to be a mon[s]ter, or new animal in the creation; others di[s]po[s]ed to be of opinion, and others confidently a[s][s]erting, that it was a real man. Coming to the ear of the chief ju[s]tice of the [s]late, it occured to him, that if a man, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-646.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] the confining him in that manner was a re[s]traint upon the liberty of the [s]ubject; and ought not to be permitted in a country where the laws govern. Accordingly, he had i[s][s]ued his writ of Habeas Corpus to the keepers, commanding them forthwith to bring before him, the animal in their po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and to a[s][s]ign the cau[s]e of this detainer. The officer came forward at the moment the keepers were about to clo[s]e the bargain with the philo[s]ophers, and [s]hewed his writ. They were obliged to obey; and came forward with their charge before the chief ju[s]tice and a[s][s]ociate judges, in open court then [s]itting, alledging property in them[s]elves by caption, and employing coun[s]el to [s]upport this allegation. The court having a[s][s]igned coun[s]el to [s]upport the Habeas Corpus, the argument began: Coun[s]ellor Patch fir[s]t. May it plea[s]e your honours, I take this to be an animal in which there can be no property ab[s]olute or qualified, being fera natara, or of an untamed nature, [s]uch as a panther, or a buffalo; of which it is laid down no larceny can be committed, as not being the the [s]ubject of property. 4 Black. 235; referring for authorities to 1 Hal. P. C. 511. Fo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-647.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] Fo[s]t. 366. 1 Hawk. P. C. 94. Here counfeller Patch read the authorities. Councellor Catch in reply: But by the [s]ame authorities, it is laid down, that animals fera natura, or wild, when reclaimed, or confined, and may [s]erve for food, may be the [s]ubject of property, as deer inclo[s]ed in a park, fi[s]h in a trunk, or phea[s]ants or partridges in a mew. But is it conceded, that this animal can [s]erve for food? rejoined coun[s]ellor Patch. The que[s]tion to be con[s]idered in the fir[s]t place, interrupted the chief ju[s]tice, is whether this creature is of the brutal or the human kind. Speak to that point. Coun[s]ellor Scratch, as amicus curia observed, that this being a que[s]tion of fact, was mo[s]t properly determinable by a jury. Coun[s]ellor Patch thought not, as the trial by in[s]pection in the ca[s]e of infancy, which was within the province of the court, was analogous to this. The court were of opinion with coun[s]ellor Scratch, and proposed to the coun[s]el for the thing in custody, to bring a writ de Homine Replegiando, or Replevin, for the body of a man, as the proper writ to bring the ca[s]e before a jury; or that an i[s][s]ue might be made upon the return to the Habeas Corpus, by con- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-648.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] con[s]ent; and in that [s]hape let it be tried. It was agreed; property pleaded, the i[s][s]ue made up, and the jury about to be impanelled. Coun[s]ellor Patch under the principle of an alien having a right to a jury de medietata lingua,  demanded, that the jury [s]hould con[s]i[s]t of one half bea[s]ts. Curia advifari vult, and in the mean time de[s]ired the coun[s]el to [s]earch for precedents. No in[s]tance was found of the jury de medietata lingua, being carried [s]o far as this, and the motion was overruled. The jury being now [s]worn, the coun[s]el for the keepers, offered the two members of the Philo[s]ophical Society, who had examined him, to e[s]tabli[s]h his brutality; this evidence was offered on the principle, that it was peculiarly within the province of their [s]tudies to a[s]certain a point of this nature, and were therefore the proper witnesses; as in a ca[s]e within the cu[s]tom of merchants, individuals of this occupation are u[s]ally called. According to the maxim of the civil law, Unicuique, in arte [s]ua, perito credendum e[s]t  . Exception to this evidence, that they were intere[s]ted, having had an eye to the pur- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-649.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] purcha[s]e of this thing, and actually in negociation for it. The objection was overruled, as going to the credibility, not the competency. The witne[s][s]es were clear that this thing was not of the human race, though as to what cla[s]s of brute animals it was to be referred, they were not yet prepared to decide. To the weight of this evidence counsellor Catch oppo[s]ed the evidence of nature her[s]elf; the thing had a human voice and [s]peech, that of a we[s]t country Iri[s]hman; no in[s]tance of which was to be found in any natural hi[s]torian that had ever written. He would call upon the gentleman to produce any authority to that effect. Coun[s]ellor Patch, was not prepared with an authority to prove, that bea[s]ts had been found that could [s]peak Iri[s]h; but that it was no uncommon thing in early ages, and in many countries, for bea[s]ts to [s]peak fome language; [s]uch as Latin, Greek; for which he might refer the gentleman to the Æ[s]opi Fabulae , or tho[s]e of Phedrus; nor was he without an authority at hand, to prove that even in more modern times, there were many bea[s]ts who could [s]peak Engli[s]; this authority was that well known book, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-650.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] book, The Hi[s]tory of Reynard the Fox; which he now produced, and from which he read pa[s][s]ages. The court thought the authority in point, and the evidence not to be got over, and directed the jury to find accordingly; which they did, in favour of the keepers, and the Habeas Corpus, was dismissed, and the thing remanded to custody. The members after this, [s]truck a bargain the more ea[s]ily with the keepers; as they had been a good deal alarmed at the ri[s]k they had run of having this property taken from them. The Society after having retained the curio[s]ity a year or [s]o, and ascertained its [s]tructure and properties, proposed [s]ending it to [s]ome of the foreign societies, who had expre[s][s]ed a with to have a an occural examination of it al[s]o. The preference was given to the [s]ocieties of France; and it was accordingly [s]hipped in a brig of Blair M`Clenachen, that was bound to Nantz. At this place on coming a[s]hore, the cage, by rolling and tubling in it, having worn off the tar and feathers from his back-[s]ide, he was mi[s]taken for a [s]ans culotte; and the mob ri[s]ing, broke the inclo[s]ure, and let him out. I have not heard [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-653.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] heard whether he joined the army of the patriots, or is on his way home again to this country. IN the mean time the oppo[s]ition to the exci[s]e law, and di[s]turbance in the survey, had alarmed the government. The militia had been called to [s]uppre[s]s the insurrection. They had marched, and were within a [s]hort di[s]tance of the [s]urvey. The Captain in the mean time having heard of this, and believing the army now to be within [s]upporting di[s]tance, left the Marquis, and came to the village where the outrage had commenced. He was not wanting in explaining to the people, the illegality and great impolicy of their proceedings, as [s]ubver[s]ive of the government, and de[s]tructive of the fir[s]t principle of a republican government. His conduct, neverthele[s]s, had been otherwise under[s]tood by the on, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-652.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] administration, and he was greatly obnoxious with the army and judiciary. When the troops had attained the point of de[s]tination, and the judicial examinations had been [s]et on foot with regard to the conduct of individuals, it was always a principal que[s]tion, What do you know of Captain Farrago? They had heard of his man Duncan, and thinking that he mu[s]t be acquainted with the [s]ecrets of the Captain, orders were given to apprehend him, under the idea of a criminal. The examinations were conducted with great di[s]patch, many hands making light work, there being a va[s]t number of assistant interrogators, and depo[s]ition-takers, in the capacity of journeymen, and apprentices. It was a good [s]chool for [s]tudents of the law, and young clerks who came out on the expedition. It is true, they were not very capable of taking the true [s]en[s]e of what was [s]tated in the te[s]timony, nor very careful to take down for and again[s]t; but the giving them a habit of a[s]king que[s]tions, and [s]pelling words, was of more con[s]equence to the public, than the doing ju[s]tice to people that had lived in a remote corner of the commonwealth. Duncan having been arre[s]ted, was put un- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-653.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] under guard with [s]everal others. When he came to his examination, he was a[s]ked the following que[s]tion, and made the following an[s]wers: Are you aquainted with John Farrago? I hae a [s]hort acquaintance [s]ince I hae been in his [s]ervice, about a month or twa. Has he ever conver[s]ed with you on the [s]ubject of politics? He wad na conver[s]e wi' me, he kens I dinna understand them. Do you not know him to be an in[s]urgent? Indeed I dinna ken ony [s]ik a thing. I believe he is no ju[s]t vera right in the head, but I dinna believe he tuk any part in [s]tirring up the in[s]urrection. He has gane about the kintra for [s]ome time pa[s]t, in an odd way, wi' ane Teague O'Regan, an Iri[s]hman, that got to be a gauger, and came out to this kintra, to [s]et up in the bu[s]ine[s]s, and made a' this broil; and [s]ince he parted wi' him, he has employed me in the like capacity, no much to my profit, if I am pur[s]ued, and put in fear o' my life, and to hide three weeks in a glen for fear o' the mob, and now to be hanged for hanged ha'ing been in the kintra; and what is mare, to be made a witne[s]s again[s]t the Captain, when I hae nathing to [s]ay o' him. The deel tak me, gin I [s]wear a word to wrang my con[s]cience. That is the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf800v4T&image=800-654.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] the [s]hort and the lang o' it. Sae ye need [s]ay na mare about it, but gae to the examination o' [s]ome other body, for U hae told ye a' that I hae to [s]ay about it. Duncan was di[s]mi[s][s]ed, and the Captain him[s]elf; and falling into the hands of an a[s][s]i[s]tant examiner of [s]en[s]e, his account and explanation was under[s]tood, and he acquitted from the [s]u[s]picion of having [s]werved from the duty of a good citizen. Setting out after this with Duncan, he returned to his home; having experienced a number of incidents, and [s]ome danger in his travels, [s]ufficient for one ramble.
