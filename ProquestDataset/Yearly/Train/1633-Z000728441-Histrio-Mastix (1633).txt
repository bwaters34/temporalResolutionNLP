 Pagan Authors of all sorts , and by Mahomet himselfe ; but likewise by sundry Heathen, yea Christian Magistrates Edicts, and by the Statutes of our Kingdome; as the occasions of much idlenesse, prodigality, cursing, swearing, forswearing, lying, cheating, mispence of money and time, theft, rapine, usurie, malice, envie, fretting, discontents, quarrels, duels, murthers, covetousnes, acquaintance with ill company, povertie, ruine of many young Gentlemens, yea & Tradesmens fortunes and estates; with a world of such like mischiefes : which as they proclaime all publike Dice-play unsufferable in a Republike ; so much more in an Innes of Court : which cannot more dishonour it selfe, than in turning a professed Christmas Dice-house , or publike receptacle of all sorts of Dicers of purpose to enrich the Butlers , or to defray their Christmas expences ; as if Innes of Court Gentlemen were so beggerly, that they could neither maintaine their Officers , nor Christmas Commons , without the infamous Almes , or turpe lucrum of their Dice-boxes ; which empty many a young Students, trades-mans, apprentices, unfortunate gamesters purse, and bring divers unhappy Dicers yearely to the Goale, if not the Gallowes, whiles they seeke to repaire their losses by robbery, cheating, and unlawfull meanes ; leaving the guilt of all their sinnes, with many a bitter execration upon those Societies where they have lost their money: (All which your Worships have piously prevented to your deserved honour, by suppressing Dice-play:) So likewise in imitation of the ancient Lacedemonians and Massilienses , or rather of the primitive zealous Christians , you have alwayes from my first admission into your Society, and long before, excluded all Common Players with their lewd ungodly Enterludes, from all your solemne Festivals; not suffering them so much as once to enter within your gates, for feare they should corrupt the mindes, the manners, the vertuous education of those young hopefull vertuous Gentlemen committed to your care, by drawing them on to idlenesse, luxurie, incontinencie, prophanesse, and those other dangerous vices which Playes and Play-houses oft occasion : they being no other, as the Fathers Phrase them, but the very plagues and poysons of mens mindes and soules. Which praise-worthy imitable act of yours, assures me of your kinde entertainment of this my last-borne Issue which though (by reason of some intervenient subjects diverting my studies into another channell) it be ultimus in executione , yet it was primus in intentione , of all my printed Treatises, as some scattered passages against Stage-playes in my former Impressions , evidence. For having upon my first arrivall here in London, heard and seene in foure severall Playes (to which the pressing importunity of some ill acquaintance drew me whiles I was yet a novice) such wickednes, such lewdnes as then made my penitent heart to loath, my conscience to abhorre all Stage-playes ever since : and having likewise then observed some wofull experiments of the lewd mischievous fruits of Playes, of Play-houses in some young Gentlemen of my acquaintance, who though civill and chast at first, became so vitious, prodigall, incontinent, deboist, (yea so farre past hopes of all amendment) in halfe a yeares space or lesse, by their resort to Playes, where whores and lewd companions had inveagled them, that after many vaine assaies of their much desired reformation, two of them were cast off, and utterly disinherited by their loving Parents, whom I heard oft complaining even with teares; That Playes and Play-houses had undone their children, to their no small vexation : (A good caveat for all young Students to keepe themselves from play-houses by these two Youngster's harmes :) hereupon I resolved (out of a desire of the publike good) to oppugne these common vice-fomenting evills: For which purpose about some 7 yeares since, recollecting those Play-condemning passages which I had met with in the Fathers and other Authors, I digested them into one entire written Discourse; which having since that time enlarged beyond its intended Bulk, because I saw the number of Players, Play-books, Play-haunters, and Play-houses still increasing, there being above forty thousand Play-books printed within these two yeares, (as Stationers informe mee,) they being now more vendible than the choycest Sermons; two olde Play-houses being also lately reedified, enlarged, and one new Theatre erected, the multitude of our London Play-haunters being so augmented now, that all the ancient Divels Chappels (for so the Fathers stile all Play- houses) being five in number, are not sufficient to containe their troopes, whence wee see a sixth now added to them; whereas even in vitious Nero His raigne there were but three standing Theaters in Pagan Rome , (though farre more spacious than our Christian London) and those three too many : Hereupon I first commended it being thus augmented to the Licencer, and from him unto the Presse, where it hath lingred longer than I did expect. Which being now at last brought forth into the world in such a Play-adoring age, that is like to bid defiance to it, I here bequeath it to your pious Patronage, to whom it was at first devoted, not caring how it fares abroad, so it may doe good and please at home. Thus wishing all grace, all happines and prosperity to your Worships, and to the whole Society of Lincolnes Inne, together with all prosperous successe to these my unworthy labours, I commend both you and them to Gods owne blessing. Ever resting famous Innes of Court, and especially those of Lincolnes Inne. hope, the future prop and honour of our English Nation; that cordiall longing desire of your temporall and eternall felicity, which hath a long time harboured in the very innermost receptacles of my soule, hath, as at first provoked me to pen, so now at last to publish this Histrio-Mastix for your common good, which here lieth prostrate at your feet, imploring not onely your naked acceptations, but your unprejudicated affections too; that so you may thorowly scan it with an impartiall scrutinie, before you preposterously fore-judge it out of a misinformed prejudice. It is not I suppose unknowne to any, What favour, what estimation Playes and Players have lately purchased in the opinions and hearts of most; which I feare are so strangely forestalled, so desperately infatuated with their Syrenian enchantments, that they will hardly brooke the sight, much lesse the reading of this Play-scourging Discourse, whose very title will be a sufficient warrant for many to condemne it, if not a Supersedeas to them to peruse it: such being the froward disposition of prejudicated persons, (especially when their popular universall overspreading pleasures of sinne in which they most delight, come once to be controlled by some one private person, which is now the case of Stage-playes:) that let the truth be never so evident, the arguments, the authorities against them never so convincing, yet they will quite reject and precondemne them, ere they have once examined them. What therefore Minucius Felix, that famous Christian Lawyer, and St. Cyprian complained of long since, against the Pagans of their age, in the name of all the Christians : Sic occupant animos et obstruunt pectora, ut ante nos incipiant homines odisse quam nosse, ne cognitos aut imitari possint, aut damnare non possint: Or what Tertullian writes in the selfe same case ; Nolunt audire quod auditum damnare non possint. Malint nescire, quia jam oderint, adeo quod nesciunt pr aejudicant id esse, quod si sciant odisse non poterant, quando si nullum odij debitum depraehendatur, optimum utique sit, desinere injuste odisse. Quid vero iniquius, quam ut oderint homines quod ignorant, etiamsi res meretur odium? Tunc etenim meretur cum cognoscitur an mereatur, Vacante autem meriti notitia, unde odij justitia defenditur? quae non de eventu, sed de conscientia probanda est, &c. Or what Lactantius of olde lamented upon the like occasion : Student damnare tanquam nocentes quos utique sciunt innocentes; itaque constare de ipsa innocentia nolunt; quasi vero major iniquitas sit probatam innocentiam damnare qua inauditam: the same I feare may be the just complaint of this my Histrio-Mastix now: Many, I doubt, will censure, if not exclaime against it ere they reade it, because it reprehends their vices: and some perchance will purposely disdaine to cast their eyes upon it, for feare they should approve it, at leastwise be unable to controll it. But however others may chance thus ignorantly or maliciously to forejudge it; yet I hope it shall finde no such ungenteile discourteous entertainment fro you deare fellow-Brethren, whose generous ingenuous education hath taught you thus much courtesie, whose religion and profession have learned you this good Lesson ; to heare and know, before you sentence: since Gods Law, & ours too, doth not judge any man, before it heare him, and know what he doth. What Medea therefore requested of Creon; Si judicas, cognosce: or what Seneca desired of his friend Lucilius; Adhibe diligentiam tuam, et intuere quid sint res nostr ae, non quid vocentur; shall be my present suite to you ; to peruse my Histrio-Mastix first, and then to censure it as you finde it. Perchance it may seeme some Paradox, some meere fantastique Novalty, or strange Monster at the first in this Play- admiring age; wherein most men like the Athenian Epicurean Stoicke Philosophers, who encountred S. Paul, will be ready to demand in scorne , What will this Babler say? May we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is? for thou bringest certaine strange things to our eares; wee would therfore know what these things meane. But if you will doe it so much honour as considerately to revolve it, you shall finde it to containe nought else but resolved, uniuersally receiued ancient (though now forgotten) truthes; so farre from any suspicion of factious Novalty, or puritanicall singularity, that they have the concurrent testimonies, the unanimous resolutions of sundry sacred texts of Scripture, of the whole primitive Church and Saints of God, both before and under the Law and Gospell; the Canons of 55 severall oecumenicall, nationall, provinciall synods and Councels of divers ages and Countries: together with the canonicall, the imperiall Constitutions of the Apostles themselves, of Emperours, Popes and other Bishops,, the workes of 71 Fathers and ancient Christian Writers of chiefest note, from our Saviours Nativity of the yeare 1200. the suffrages of above 150 Christian Authors of all sorts, from the year 1200 to this present; the sentence of 40 Heathen Philosophers, Orators, Historians, Poets; together with the Play- condemning Lawes and Edicts of sundry Christian, yea Pagan Nations, Republikes, Emperours, Princes, Magistrates in severall ages; with the Statutes, Magistrates, Vniversities, Writers and Preachers of our owne renowned Kingdome; to back, to second them in all particulars; who all have long since passed this heavie censure against Stage-playes : that they are the very workes, the pompes, inventions and chiefe delights of the Divell, which all Christians solemnly abjure in their baptisme: the most pestilent corruptions of all mens (especially young mens) minds  & manners; the chiefe fomenters of all vice and wickednesse; the greatest enemies of all vertue, grace and goodnesse; the most mischievous plagues that can be harboured in any Church or State; yea lewd infernall pastimes not tollerable among Heathens, not sufferable in any well-ordered Christian Republike; not once to be haunted or applauded by any civill vertuous persons, who are either mindfull of their credits, or of their owne salvation. Which as it controlls the grosse mistake of divers voluptuous paganizing Christians in our dayes, who dote on Stage- playes as the most laudable, generous, if not necessary recreations; so it should now at last ingage all Christians for ever to abandon them; as the very best of Saints, of Pagans have done in former ages. Alas, what goodnesse, what profit doe men reape from stage-playes, that should any way ingage their affections to them ? Doe they not enrage their lusts, adde fire and fewell to their unchast affections; deprave their minds, corrupt their manners, cauterize their consciences, obdurate their hearts, multiply their heinous transgressions,. Consume their estates, mispend their time, canker their graces, blast all their vertues, interrupt their studies, indispose them to repentance and true godly sorrow for their sinnes; make all Gods ordinances ineffectuall to their spirituall good, draw downe the guilt of sundry Play-house abominations on their persons, incorporate them into lewd ungodly company, and without repentance damne their soules? Doe they not dishonour their most holy God, abuse their most blessed Saviour sundry wayes, blaspheame and grieve Gods holy spirit, prophane the sacred scriptures and the name of God, deride and jeare religion, holinesse, vertue, temperance, grace, goodnesse, with all religious, vertuous persons, advance the Divels scepter, service, kingdome, by sowing, by cherishing the seedes of atheisme, heathenisme, prophanesse, incontinency, voluptuousnes, idlenes, yea, of all kind of wickednes both in their Actors and Spectators hearts? How many thousands have Stage-playes drawne on to sinne, to lewdnesse, to all sorts of vice, and at last sunke downe to hell, with the weight of those prodigious evills which they had quite avoided, had they not haunted Play-houses? How many Novices and Youngsters have beene corrupted, debauched, and led away captive by the Divel, by their owne outragious lusts, by Panders, Players, Bawdes, Adulteresses, Whores, and other lewd companions, who had continued studious, civill, hopefull, towardly and ingenious, had they not resorted unto Stage-playes, the originall causes of their dolefull ruine? which bring no other benefit to their Actors, their Spectators at the last, but this, to post them merrily on to hell with a greater loade of soule- condemning sinnes; quasi vivendi sensum ad hoc tantum acceperant ut perirent; as if they had received life for no other purpose, but to worke out their owne eternall death, which needes no other instruments to effect it, than lewd lascivious Enterludes. O therefore (deare Brethren) as you tender Gods honour, the publike welfare, or your owne soules safety, abominate these glittering gawdy pompous snares, these sugered poysoned potions of the Divell, by which he cunningly endeavours your destruction when as you least suspect it: and if any of you have formerly frequented Stage-playes, either out of childish vanity, or injudicious ignorance of their oft-condemned mischievous lewd effects; or through the Over-pressing importunity of voluptuous carnall acquaintance; or by reason of that popular erronious good opinion which our wicked times conceive of Stage-playes which humour them in their lusts; or because such multitudes resort now daily to them, that they carry one another headlong to these sinfull pleasures without any sense of danger, or hopes of reformation; be you henceforth truly penitent for what is past, Quem delectabat spectare, delectet orare; quem delectabant cantica nugatoria et adulterina, delectet hymnum dicere Deo, currere ad Ecclesiam, qui primo currebat ad theatrum: as St. Augustine sweetly councels: and wholly abandon them for all future time. And so much the rather, that you may now at last falsifie that ignominious Censure which some English Writers in their printed Workes have passed upon Innes of Court Students; of whom they record : That Innes of Court men were undone but for Players; that they are their chiefest guests and imployment,  & the sole busines that makes them afternoons men: that this is one of the first things they learne as soone as they are admitted, to see Stage-playes, & take smoke at a Play-house, which they commonly make their Studie; where they quickly learne to follow all fashions, to drinke all Healths, to weare favours and good cloathes, to consort with ruffianly companions, to sweare the biggest oaths, to quarrell easily, fight desperately, game inordinately, to spend their patrimony ere it fall, to use gracefully some gestures of apish complement, to talke irreligiously, to dally with a Mistresse, and hunt after harlots, to prove altogether lawlesse in steed of Lawyers, and to forget that little learning, grace and vertue which they had before: so that they grow at last past hopes of ever doing good, either to the Church, their Country, their owne or others soules. Which heavie Censure, if any dissolute Play-haunters have justly occasioned heretofore, to the dishonour of those famous Law-Societies wherein they live, I hope their subsequent reformation will reverse it now; that so all England may henceforth experimentally discerne, that Stage-Playes and Actors are as well condemned, detested by her lawyers, as by her Lawes and Statutes, which brand all Stage-playes for unlawfull pastimes; all common Actors, for notorious Rogues; too base companions for generous spirits to beholde or dance attendance on, who were created for more noble objects, more sublime imployments than base infamous Enterludes, or most abject Players. O therefore let the serious consideration of your owne native generositie, of your heroicke Studies, elevated with the sublimer contemplations of your transcendent Christian Nobility; which makes you heires of heaven, coheires with Christ, yea, Kings and Priests unto God your Father, (who hath not onely crownes of glory, but likewise an heavenly eternall Kingdome to bestow upon you) raise up your depressed mindes and thoughts so farre above these earthly childish vanities, as with a kinde of holie magnanimitie to trample them under feete as drossie filthie pleasures, unworthy any Christians presence, much lesse his approbation, who hath farre better, farre sublimer spectacles to beholde; even those which I shall here commend unto you in Cyprians words, in his elegant Booke against Stage-playes : Habet Christianus Spectacula meliora, si velit; habet veras et profuturas voluptates, si se recollegerit, et ut omittam illa, qu ae nondum contemplari potest, habet istam mundi pulchritudinem, quam videat atque miretur; solis ortum aspiciat, rursus occasum, mutuis vicibus dies noctesque revocantem, globum lunae, temporum cursus incrementis suis, decrementisque signantem, astrorum micantium choros, et a summo de summa mobilitate fulgentes, anni totius per membra divisa, et dies ipsos cum noctibus per horarum spatia digestos, et terrae molem libratam cum montibus, et proflua flumina cum suis fontibus, extensa maria cum suis fluctibus atque littoribus: Interim constantem pariter summa conspiratione nexibusque concordiae, extensum aerem medium tenuitate sua cuncta vegetantem, nunc imbres contractis nubibus profundentem, nunc serenitatem refecta raritate revocantem, et in omnibus istis incolas proprios, in aere avem, in aquis piscem, in terra hominem. Haec inquam, et alia opera divina, sint Christianis fidelibus Spectacula. Quod theatrum humanis manibus extructum istis operibus poterit comparari? magnis licet lapidum molibus extruatur, crusta sunt montium; et auro licet tecta lucanaria reluceant, astrorum fulgore vincentur: nunquam humana opera mirabitur quisquis se cognoscerit filiu Dei. Dejicit se de culmine generositatis suae qui admirari aliquid post Deum potest. Scripturis inquam sacris incumbat Christianus: ( let Papists, and those who are given so much to play-bookes consider this :) ibi inveniet condigna fidei Spectacula. Videbit instituentem Deum mundum suum, et cum c aeteris animalibus hominis illa admirabilem fabricam melioremque facientem: spectabit mundum in delicijs suis, justa naufragia, piorum praemia, impiorum que supplicia: maria populo siccata, et de petra rursus populo maria porrecta: spectabit de coelo descendentes messes, non ex areis: inspiciet flumina transitus siccos refraenatis aquarum agminibus exhibentia: videbit in quibusdam fidem cum igne luctuantem: religione superatas feras, et in mansue- tudinem conversas: intuebitur et animas ab ipsa morte revocatas: considerabit etiam de sepulchris admirabiles ipsorum consummatoru jam vitas corporum redactas: et in his omnibus jam majus videbit Spectaculum, Diabolum illum qui totum detriumphaverat mundum, sub pedibus Christi jacentem. Quam hoc decorum Spectaculum Fratres? quam jucundum? quam necessarium? intueri semper spem suam, et oculos aperire ad salutem suam. Hoc est spectaculum quod videtur etiam luminibus amissis. Hoc est spectaculum, quod non exhibet Praetor, aut Consul, sed qui est solus et ante omnia, et super omnia, immo ex quo omnia, Pater Domini nostri Iesu Christi, cuilaus et honor in saecula saeculorum. These (my beloved Brethren) are the true celestiall worthie Spectacles of every pious Christian: O let your hearts, your mindes, your affections, your eyes and eares be wholly ravished and taken up with these, which will onely bring true comfort to our soules, Let mee therefore close up my Epistle to you with St. Augustines words: Intendite ad magna h aec spectacula. Ista sunt spectacula utilia, salubria, aedificantia: non destruentia, imo et destruentia et aedificantia Destruentia recentes Deos, aedificantia fidem in verum et aeternum Deum: Let other men therefore who love their Stage-playes better than their God, their soules, resort to Theatres whiles they please ; ( Illi habeant mare in theatro; nos habeamus portum in Christo:) but let christ Iesus be your all, in all your onely solace, your onely spectacle, and joy on earth, whose soule-ravishing heart- filling presence, shall be your eternall solace, your everlasting visible all-glorious most triumphant spectacle in the highest heavens; whither God bring us all at length for this his Sonne and mercies sake. Amen. Mastix, for which I am necessitated to make some Apologie, to prevent all causelesse cavills. The first, is its tedious prolixitie; which as it far exceeds its primitive intended Brevity, so it may somewhat derogate from its welcome acceptation, as being too large for so slight a subject: But as it was no disparagement to Ph aebus his pallace ; that the workmanship of it did exceede the matter; so I hope it will be no prejudice to this Treatise, if Malo nodo malus cuneus, may be allowed for a Plea. Hee who intends to encounter a potent enemie, had neede provide a puissant armie: Hee who will cure a large spreading gangrene, must proportion his plaister to the maladie; he who would discover or refute an inveterate generally received Error, must come strongly armed with convincing reasons and authorities, else he is like to do more harme than good. Players and Stageplaies, with which I am now to combate in a publike Theatre in the view of sundry partiall Spectators, are growne of late so powerfull, so prevalent in the affections, the opinions of many both in Citie, Court and Country; so universally diffused like an infectious leprosie, so deepely rivited into the seduced prepossessed hearts and judgements of voluptuous carnall persons, who swarme so thicke in every Play-house, that they leave no empty place, and almost crowd one another to death for multitude; as they did in Augustines time , chusing rather to fill the Theatre than the church; that had not this my Histrio-Mastix overgrowne its first intended pigmies stature, it had never beene able to foyle those many Giantlike Enemies with which it is now to grapple; neither could it have borne any geometricall proportion with those festring ulcers, those many practicall applauded Errors, whose cure and refutation it indeavours. Some Play-books since I first undertooke this subject, are growne from Quarto into Folio; which yet beare so good a price and sale, that I cannot but with griefe relate it, they are now new-printed in farre better paper than most Octavo or Quarto Bibles, which hardly finde such vent as they: And can then one Quarto Tractate against Stage-playes be thought too large, when as it must assault such ample Play-house Volumes? Besides, our Quarto- Play-bookes since the first sheetes of this my Treatise came unto the Presse, have come forth in such abundance, and found so many customers, that they almost exceede all number, one studie being scarce able to holde them, and two yeares time too little to peruse them all: And this made this Treatise swell the greater, because these Play-bookes are so multiplied. Againe, I considered with my selfe, that our Players, our Play-haunters are now more in number, more various in judgements, in humours, in apprehensions, than they have beene in former ages; whereupon I thought good to produce more store of different Play-refelling Arguments and Authorities than else I should have done ; that so I might satisfie every Reader to my power, and meete with all evasions. All which being laid together, will easily excuse my overmuch paines; which if it seeme irkesome to any Reader, I am sure it was farre more troublesome to me the Author, who if I am peccant in this kinde. it is onely out of too much love to doe the Readers greater good: who if they complaine for want of time, may soone peruse it without any losse, by devoting their Play-house houres to it, till they have read it over. The second, is some passages, termes and phrases, which may give offence to such, who consider not the grounds and reasons of them and these are of different natures. Some of them: may seeme to be over sharpe and virulent against Players, Playes, and Play-haunters: Others of them may be construed to be overmalepart and censorious: Others, too immodest, too amorous, and obscene: Others, heterogeneall, and impertinent to the intended theame. To the two first of which I answer: First, that I have used no more tartnesse against Players, Playes, or Play-haunters, nor passed no other Censures upon them, than the Fathers themselves, with sundry approved Writers have done before me, whose phrases and invectives I have onely revived. You must therefore lay the blame on them, not me, who onely speake in their language. Novi enim quod et pr aesens aetas corrigitur, dum praeterita suis meritis objurgatur. Secondly , inveterate gangrend ulcers, as Playes and Players are , neede sharpe emplaisters, biting corrosives, else they will not be cured ; because gentle lenitives cannot cleanse them. Thirdly, the greatest virulency is onely against Players and Play-haunters vices, not their persons ; Hostes plan e sumus, non generis humani tamen, sed erroris: Yea I have therefore censured their errours, their vices so severely, because I love their persons, whose happinesse, salvation and amendment I here onely seeke, by withdrawing them from Playes and Play-houses, the very greatest corruptions of their mindes and manners. Hoc enim nteriora maxim e corrumpit, quod exteriora delectat. What therefore St. Augustine writes to Macedonius in this very case; Facile est atque proclive malos odisse, quia mali sunt, rarum autem et pium cosdem ipsos diligere quia homines sunt, ut in uno simul et culpam improbes, et naturam approbes; ac propterea culpam justius oderis, quod ea f aedatur natura quam diligis. Non est igitur iniquitatis, sed potius humanitatis societate devinctus, qui propterea sit criminis persecutor ut sit hominis liberator: the same shall be my Apologie now. And if any Play-Astors or Spectators thinke themselves injured by any censure I have here past upon them, I must returne them an answer in St. Bernards words : Cum carpuntur vitia, et inde scandalum oritur, ipse sibi scandali causa est, qui fecit quod argui debeat, non ille qui arguit: or at leastwise in St. Hieroms language : Aut enim nihil scribendum fuit, ne hominum judicium subiremus, aut scribentes nosse, cunctorum adversum nos maledicorum tela esse torquenda. Quos obsecro, ut quiescant, et desinant maledicere. Non enim ut adversariis, sed ut amicis scripsimus; nec invecti sumus in eos qui peccant, sed ne peccent, monuimus. Nullum l aesi, nullius nomen mea scriptura designatum est. Neminem specialiter meus sermo pulsavit. Generalis de vitijs disputatio est. Qui mihi irasei voluerit, prius ipse de se, quod talis sit, confitebitur. Wherefore, since all I aime at in this Treatise is mens eternall good ; Sustinete hanc virgam corripientem, ne sentiatis malleum conterentem: remembring that good lesson of Salomon: He that hateth reproofe, is brutish; yea, he despiseth his owne soule, and he shall surely die. To the third of these, I answer; that hee who stirres a noysome kennell, must needes raise some stench; he who would lively portraiture a Divell, or a deformed monster, must needes draw some gastly lines, and use some sordid colours: so he who will delineate to the life, the notorious lewdnesse of Playes, of Play-haunters, is necessarily enforced to such immodest phrases as may present [illeg.] in its native vilenesse; else he shall but conceale or masque their horrid wickednesse that none may behold it, not rip it open that all may abhorre it. This is the onely reason of those more uncivill or seemingly immodest passages and phrases that are here and there scattered in this Discourse, which as they are for the most part the Fathers, or some other Authors, not mine owne, and so the more excusable; so necessity onely hath enforced mee to them; the impurity and lewdnesse of Stage-playes being such, that a man can hardly remember, much lesse reprove them without sinne or shame. Talia autem sunt ( writes Salvian) qu ae in theatris fiunt, ut ea non solum dicere, sed etiam recordari aliquis sine pollutione non possit. Quae quidem omnia tam flagitiola sunt, ut etiam explicare ea quispiam atque eloqui salvo pudore non va eat. Quis enim integro verecundiae statu dicere queat illas rerum turpium imitationes, illas vocum ac verborum obscaenitates, illas motuum turpitudines, illas gestuum faeditates? quae quanti sunt criminis, vel hinc intelligi potest, quod et relationem sui interdicunt. Nonnulla quippe maxima scelera incolumi honeste referentis et nominari et argui possunt, ut homicidium, latrocinium sacrilegium, caeteraque hujusmodi. Solae theatrorum impuritates sunt, quae honeste non possunt vel accusari: ita nova in coarguenda harum turpitudinum probrositate res evenit arguenti, ut cum absque dubio honestus sit qui accusare ea velit, honestate tamen integra ea loqui et accusare non possit. It was this Fathers Preface to his Play-condemning Treatise, and it shall be my Apologie. To the fourth of these, I answer; that there are severall passages in this Discourse, which prima facie may seeme heterogeneous to the present subject, as those concernig Dancing Musicke, Apparell, Effeminacy, Lascivious Songs, Laughter, Adultery, obscene Pictures, Bonefires, New-yeares gifts, Grand Christmasses, Health-drinking, Long haire, Lords-dayes, Dicing, with sundry Pagan customes here refelled: but if you consider them as they are here applied, you shall finde them all materially pertinent to the theame in question; they being either the concomitants of Stage-playes, or having such neare affinity with them, that the unlawfulnesse of the one are necessary mediums to evince the sinfulnesse of the other. Besides, though they differ in Specie, yet they are homogeniall in their genericall nature, one of them serving to illustrate the quality, the condition of the other: It is no impertinencie therefore for me to discourse at large of all or any of these, the better to display the odiousnesse of Stage-playes, with which they have great analogie, to which they have more or lesse relation, as the passages themselves sufficiently manifest. But admit that some of them are heterogeniall, yet it is no absurdity by way of digression, to touch on such particulars, as other Writers oft times doe, yea and the Fathers too, who have their digressions as well as others, in their Commentaries, Homilies, and morall Treatises; where they oft times lash out into collaterall Discourses against Stage-playes, Dancing, Drunkennesse, effeminacy, lascivious songs, fantastique costly apparell, Pagan customes, and those other particulars which I have how discoursed against, as their passages here recited plentifully manifest. Their practise therefore may be my excuse. And so much the rather, because the particulars I have thus lightly glanced upon in the by, are universall overspreading still-increasing evills, which neede some present opposition, especially out of those pregnant venerable Authorities of Councels, Fathers and ancient Writers that are almost forgotten in the world, (whose memory I have here in part revived as farre as opportunity would permit:) which manifest to all mens judgements, that effeminate mixt Dancing, Dicing, Stage- playes, lascivious Pictures, wanton Fashions, Face-painting, Health-drinking, Long haire, Love-lockes, Periwigs, womens curling, pouldring and cutting of their haire, Bone-fires, New-yeares-gifts, May-games, amorous Pastoralls, lascivious effeminate Musicke, excessive laughter, luxuriovs disorderly Christmas- keeping, Mummeries, with sundry such like vanities which the world now dotes on, as laudable, good, and Christian are meere sinfull, wicked, unchristian pastimes, vanities, cultures and disguises, which the primitive church and Christians, together with the very best of Pagans quite abandoned, condemned ; however we admire, applaud them now to Gods dishonour and religions shame: My short Digressions therefore against these new-revived old-condemned spreading evills, which most men countenance, few can or dare oppose, may well be pardoned in this my Histrio-Mastix , most of them being either concomitants or fruites of Stage-playes: by the present censures of which, the Reader shall be sure to reape, either fuller satisfaction, or greater variety of knowledge than else hee should have met with in this Treatise. The third, is the repetition of some quotations, some passages of Fathers and others which are twice or thrice recited in severall places of this Discourse, where the same things are oft debated. To which I answer: First, that though the same things in effect are oft times touched upon (especially the idolatrous originall of Stage-playes, and that they are the very pompes of the Divell which Christians have renounced in their baptisme) yet it is either to different purposes, or where they are amplified and confirmed by new-recited Authorities; which as I could not couple all together, so I was unwilling to omit, for feare of doing prejudice to the cause. Secondly, though the same Authorities and quotations are oft reiterated, yet it is onely in these two cases, where the words and ends for which I cite them are divers, or where one sentence, one discourse tending to severall purposes, is so intire, that it could not be sundered into fractions without perverting the sense, or blunting the life, the edge and vigour of it. Thirdly, what ever is oft repeated, is something or other worth remembring: if therefore Seneca speakes truth, Nunquam nimis dicitur quod nunquam satis discitur; this fault may easily bee excused. The Scripture it selfe (wee know) where there is no superfluity nor defect; hath oft times precept upon precept, line upon line, yea frequent repetions of the selfesame things, ( especially in the Bookes of Moses, the Bookes of the Kings and Chronicles, the Psalmes of David, the Proverbs, the Prophets, the foure Evangelists, and St Pauls Epistles) in such cases where men are either dull to learne, apt to forget, slow to beleeve, or when as the things repeated are very observable. The like repetitions with little variation, we shall finde in divers Authors: and in most of those who write of the selfesame subject, (but principally in Commentators and the Schoolemen) wee finde the selfesame matter clothed in a different method or dresse of words ; there being no new thing under the Sunne, Et nihil dictum quod non dictum prius: all being but reiterations of what hath beene written or spoken in former ages. This therefore may excuse my short reiterations of the selfesame passages against Stage-playes, with which men are so farre inamoured, that they neede many oft repeated arguments to divorce their affections from them. Having thus farre apologized for this Treatise, I shall here by way of advertisement for thy better satisfaction informe thee, Christian Reader, something concerning the Authorities quoted in it. As first, that I have cited the very Words of the Fathers themselves for the most part, in the margent, which I have faithfully englished in the Discourse it selfe, and sometimes alledged them in the margent at large, when as I have but touched them in the page: whence I shall advise thee to reade the margent and the page together. Secondly, that I have oft times onely quoted the names, the Workes of Fathers and other Authors for brevity sake, omitting their words, which the studious Reader may doe well to peruse at leisure in their workes; whose severall passages had I transcribed, I should have oft repeated the selfesame things, and augmented this Quarto Treatise into many Folio Volumes. Thirdly, I have faithfully recorded the Books, the Chapters, Columes and pages of those Authors here alledged, together with the Impressions which I follow; all which you shall finde expressed, Part.1. Act.7. Scen. 3, 4, 5, & 6\. Which Editions if any Reader want, let him them onely examine the number of the Bookes, the Chapters, Homilies or Sermons here quoted, in those Editions which he hath, omitting the pages, and he shall finde every quotation true, save onely where the Editions varie. And if any shall here quarrell with me for the multitude of Authors and quotations: let him know, that I produced them onely for the Readers better satisfaction, to evidence the damnable odiousnesse of stage playes in all ages, not out of any vaine-glorious ostentation, which I much abhorre. Which advertisements being thus premised, I shall now beseech thee, courteous Reader, in the feare of God, to peruse this Histrio-Mastix with an impartiall eye, and even seriously to consider with an unprejudicated affection, what all the primitive Christians, what all the Councels, Fathers, Emperours, Magistrates, and Authors here enumered have constantly thought of Stage-playes, and other particulars here recited. And then I doubt not but what a noble Earle of this Kingdome in his late dangerous sicknesse, professed publikely (even with detestation) of his effeminate fantastique Love-locke; that he sensibly perceived it to be but a cord of vanity, by which he had given the Divell holdfast to leade him captive at his pleasure: who would never let goe his holdfast of him as long as hee nourished this unlovely Bush: whereupon hee comanded his Barber to cut it off: ( a speech, a president well worthy those womanish Ruffians consideration, who yet are peccant in this kinde:) the same wilt thou affirme of these lascivious Enterludes ; that they are the very Divels pompes and snares, by which he captivates and inthralls mens soules; who can never enfranchise themselves from his infernall vassalage, till they have cordially renounced these his sugered gins, which detaine them captive in his service, and binde them over to damnation: as the here recited Councels, Fathers and other Authours witnesse: whose workes if Play-haunters would but study, at those vacant times which they sinfully waste on Playes, on Play-bookes, and such like unprofitable pleasures of sinne, which will end in horrour at the last; they would speedily abandon all Enterludes, all Play-houses, as the most execrable pernicious corruptions, which now they so much dote on as their chiefe delights. The Lord therefore open all such blinde Stage-haunters eyes by these my poore endeavours, who are yet so besotted with ignorance and these enchanting Spectacles, that they cannot discerne those infinite mischiefes that attend them, wasting their precious time upon them even from day to day, and quarrelling with all such pious Christians as would reclaime them from them: Of whom I may fitly use St. Augustines memorable passage : Quem itaque comprehendam istorum insanorum? Quis me audiat? quem eorum nos non miseros dicat, quia cum eis non insanimus? Amisisse nos putant varias et magnas voluptates in quibus ipsi insaniunt, nec vident quia mendaces sunt. Quando illis ovum invito, vel calicem salutarem porrigo saucio: et quomodo reficiam? Hortor ut reficiant, pugnas parant; s aevire volunt in medicum. Et si percusserint, diligantur; et si injuriam fe cerint non relinquantur; redituri sunt ad mentem, gratias acturi. Oremus itaque pro ipsis fratres charissimi; inde crescit numerus sanctoru de numero qui erat impiorum. It was this Fathers speech of those Play-haunters whom he indeavoured to reclaime in his time; and it shall be mine of ours now; whose conversion I shall truly pray for, how evill soever they intreat mee or this worke of mine; which if it doe no good to others, or purchase nought but hatred, but contempt unto my selfe, yet , Symmachus his speech shall be my comfort : Saluti public ae dicata industria, crescit merito cum caret praemio: or if not his, the Prophet Isaiah's: Then I said, I have laboured in vaine, I have spent my strength for nought and in vaine: yet surely my judgement is with the Lord, and my reward with my God: to whose onely blessing I shall now commend this Treatise , and thee true Christian Reader; whose spirituall good being the primum mouens, that set my thoughts upon this Subject; I hope it shall finde thy favourable acceptation : Sciens, quia sicut non habet unde placeat ex venustate, sic ex devotione scribentis non poterit displicere. And so I rest , SI mihi credideris, lingnam cohibebis, et aul ae, Limina non intret pestuus, esto domi. Aspectus hominum cautus vitare memento, Et tibi commissas claude libelle notas. Omnia sint suspecta tibi, quia publicus hostis Et maiestatis diceris esse reus. Ignisedax, gladiusq; ferox tibi forte parantur, Aut te polluta subruet hostis aqua. Cum tamen exieris faciem velabit amictus, Deformentq; tuam pulvis et aura cutem, Sit gradus et cultus habitus peregrinus cunti, Non nisi barbariem barbara lingua sonet. De Pictavorum dices [illeg.]te gente creatum, Nam licet his lingua liberiori loqui Nusquam divertas, ne quis te laedat euntem, Nugarumq; luat garrula lingua notas. Omnia si nescis, loca sunt plenissima nugis, Quarum tota cohors est inimica tibi. Ecclesia nugae regnant, et principis aula; In claustro regnant, Pontificisq; domo. In nugis clerus, in nugis militis usus; In nugis iuvenes, totaq; turba senum. Rusticus in nugis; in nugis sexus uterque: Servus et ingenuus, dives, egenus in his. Accelera gressus, cauto diplomate perges; Vt valeas, esto sobrius, esto gravis. Gens penetranda tibi perlarga, bibaxq, loquaxq;, Et cui ni morem gesseris, hostis eris. Icitus atque redi; ne quorum carpere nugas Aususes, infligant tela, necemque parent. Hospitiique fidem quaeres super, omnia, quo fiis Tutus ab insidiis, quas tibi quisque parat. Stultos, prudentes nimium, pravosque cavebis, Et quos insignes garrula lingua facit. Si quis amat verum, tibi sit gratissimus hospes, Et quem delectat gloria vana, cave. Iure patronatus illum cole, qui velit esse, Et sciat, et possit tutor ubique tuus. Sperne malos, venerare bonos, ignosce volenti Laedere; nulla bonis ultio grata magis. Et nisi festinus fugeres, te plura monerem, Vix pateris dici pauca, vel ista tene. Svch hath alwayes beene, and yet is, the peruerse, and wretched condition of sinfull man, the cogitations of whose heart are euill, and onely euill before God, and that continually : that it is farre more easie to estrange him from his best, and chiefest ioyes; then to diuorce him from his truest misery, the pleasures of sinne, which are but for a season, yet set in endlesse griefe . Man alwayes hugges his pleasurable sinnes so fast, out of a preposterous, and misguided loue, which makes his reformation desperate :) that if any soule-compassionating Christians attempt to wrest them from him; hee forthwith takes vp armes against them; returning them no other answere, them that of Ruth to Naomie , in a farre better case: The Lord doe so to mee, and more also, if ought but death part them and mee: where they dye, I will dye, and there will I bee buried : and thus alas hee liues, nay, dies, and lies (as too too many dayly doe) intombed both with, and in, his darling crimes . How naturally prone men are to cleaue to worldly pleasures, and delights of sinne, in despite of all those powerfull attractiues, which might withdraw them from them; to omit all other particular instances: wee may behold a reall, and liuely experiment of it, in prophane, and poysonous Stage-Playes ; the common Idole, and preuailing euill of our dissolute, and degenerous Age: which though they had their rise from Hell; yea, their birth, and pedegree from the very Deuill himselfe, to whose honour, and seruice they were at first deuoted: though they haue beene oft condemned, and quite exploded by the whole Primitiue Church, both vnder the Law, and Gospel: by the vnanimous vote of all the Fathers, and sundry Councells from age to age: by Moderne Diuines, and Christian Authours of all sorts: by diuers Heathen States, and Emperours; and by whole Grand-iuries of prophane writers, as well Historians, and Poets, as Philosophers: as the Incendiaries, and common Nurseries of all Villany, and Wickednesse; the bane, and ouerthrow of all Grace, and Goodnesse; the very poyson, and corruption of mens mindes, and manners; the very fatall plagues, and overtures of those States, and Kingdomes where they are once tollerated , as I shall prooue anon: Yet wee, we miserable, and gracelesse wretches, after so many sentences of condemnation passed vpon them: after so many Iudgements already inflicted on, and yet threatned to vs, for them: after so many yeres, and Iubilies of the glorious Gospel-sun-shine: which teacheth vs to deny vngodlinesse, and all worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World, looking for the comming, and appearance of the great God, and our Sauiour Iesus Christ ; yea, after our very vow, and sacred couenant in Baptisme, which bindes vs, to forsake the Deuill, and all his Workes, the Pomps, and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the sinfull lusts of the flesh, of which these Stage-Playes are the chiefe : as if wee were quite degenerated, not onely from the grace, and holinesse of Christians; but euen from the naturall goodnesse, and moralitie of Pagans in former Ages; doe now, euen now, in the middest of all our feares at home, and the miserable desolations of Gods Church abroade; (the very thoughts of which should cause our hearts to bleed, and soules to mourne; much more our Hellish iollitie, and mirth to cease :) as if wee had made a couenant with Hell, and sworne alleageance to the Deuill himselfe; inthrall, and sell our selues to these Diabolicall, and hellish Enter-ludes , notwithstanding, all that God, or man haue said against them: and would rather part with Christ, Religion, God, or Heauen, then with them. Yea so farre are many mens affections wedded to these prophane, and Heathenish vanities; that as it was in Saint Augustines time, euen so it is now: whosoeuer is but displeased, and offended with them, is presently reputed for a common Enemie : he that speakes against them, or comes not at them, is forthwith branded for a Scismaticall, or factious Puritan : and if any one assay to alter, or suppresse them; he becomes so odious unto many; that did not the feare of punishment restraine their malice, they would not onely scorne, and disgrace; but even stone, or rent him all to pieces, as a man unworthy for to liue on earth: whereas such who further these delights of sinne, are highly magnified, as the chiefe contriuers of the publike happinesse. There was once a time, If Tertullian, with some other ancient Fathers, may bee credited:) when as it was the chiefest badge and character of a Christian, to refraine from Stage-Playes: yea, this was one great crime which the Pagans did obiect against the Christians in the Primitive Church; that they came not to their Enterludes. But now, (as if Stage-Playes were our Creed , and Gospel , or the truest embleme of our Christian profession,) those are not worthy of the name of Christians ; they must be Puritians , and Precisians ; not Protestants , who dislike them. Heu quantum mutatus ab illo? Alas, how farre are Christians now degenerated, from what they were in ancient times; when as that which was their badge and honour heretofore, is now become their brand and shame? Quantus in Christiano populo honor Christiest, vbi religio ignobilem facit ? How little doe we Christians honour Christ, when as the ancient character, and practicall power, of Religion, (I meane the abandoning, and renouncing of sinne-fomenting Stage-Playes) subiect men vnto the highest censure, and disgrace? Conquerar? an taceam? This being the dissolute, and vnhappy constitution of our depraued times, it put mee at the first to this Dilemma ; whether to sit mute and silent still, and mourne in secret for these ouerspredding abominations , (which haue got such head of late among us; that many who visit the Church scarce once a weeke, frequent the Play-house once a day:) or whether I should lift vp my voyce like a trumpet, and crie against them , to my power? If I should bend my tongue, or pen against them, (as I haue done against some other sinfull, and Vnchristian vanities,) my thoughts informed me; that I might with the vnfortunate Disciples, fish all night, and catch iust nothing at the last but the reproach, and scorne of the Histrionicall, and prophaner sort, whose tongues are set on fire of Hell , against all such as dare affront their Hellish practises; and so my hopes and trauell would bee wreckt at once: If I should on the other side, neglect to doe my vttermost, to extirpate, or withstand these dangerous spectacles, or to withdraw such persons from them, as my paines, and briefe collections in this subject might reclaime, when God had put this oportunitie into my hand, and will into my heart, to doe it: my Conscience then perswaded me; that my negligence, and slackenesse in this kinde, might make mee guiltie of the death of all such ignorant, and seduced soules, which these my poore endeuours might rescue from these chaines of Hell, and cordes of sinne : and interest me, in all the euill which they might suppresse : Whereupon I resolued with my selfe at last, to endure the crosse, and despise the hate, and shame , which the publishing of this endeuours , if not otherwise,) these inueterate, and festred vlcers, (Which may endanger Church, and State at once,) by applying some speedy corrosiues, and emplaisters to them , and ripping vp their noxious, and infectious nature on the publike Theater, in these ensuing Acts , and Scoenes : which I thought good to stile, The Players , or Actors Tragoedie : not so much for the Stile, or Method of it, (for alas, here is neither Tragicke stile , nor Poeticall straines, nor rare Inuention, nor Clowne, nor Actor in it, but onely bare, and naked Trueth, which needes no Eloquence, nor straine of wit for to adorne, or pleade its cause :) as for the good effects I hope it may, and will produce, to the suppression, and extirpation; at least the restraint, and diminution both of Playes, and common Actors, and all those seuerall mischieuous, and pestiferous fruites of Hellish wickednesses that issue from them; which much desired successe, and reformation, if I could but liue to see; I should deeme my selfe an happy man, and thinke my labour richly recompenced. Bvt not to spend more time in Prologues; I shall now addresse my selfe vnto the Argument, or Subiect, of this Tragicall Discourse, which is no more in briefe, then this Conclusion. That all popular, and common Stage-Playes, whether Comicall, Tragicall; Satyricall, Mimicall, or mixt of either: (especially, as they are now compiled, and personated among us,) are such sinfull, hurtfull, and pernitious Recreations, as are altogether vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians. A Paradoxicall, new, and strange Conclusion, or Probleme vnto many, and yet an ancient; and resolued trueth, acknowledged at first by Heathen Emperors, States, and Writers , yea, and Iewish Authors , both before, and after Christ; and since that, ratified by the concurrent voyce, and verdict of the whole Church of God, from age, to age , euen to this present day; as the venerable records of all the Fathers ; the irrefragable Decrees of sundry Councells; and the learned Treatises of diuers Moderne Christians , both Protestants , and Papists , doe at large declare; a catologue of whose names, and workes shall bee presented to you in its proper Sc aene. Not to enter into any curious diuision, or enumeration of such Playes, or Enterludes, as were vsuall among the Greekes, and Romans: such as were their Ludi Circenses with Chariots; their Ludi Gladiatorij , or Sword-Playes : their Ludi Compitalitij, Florales, Gymnici, Lupercales, Megalenses, Cereales, Martiales, Appollinares, Consuales, Capitolini, Laquearij, Retiarij, Troiani, Plebeij , and the like: since diuers now of late , as well as heretofore, haue discribed them to the full, in sundry Treatises: nor yet to shew you the exact differences betweene Comicall, Tragicall, Satyricall, or Mimicall Enterludes, together with their seuerall circumstances, inuentions, parts, or properties, (delineated likewise by the marginall Authors,) which differ more in substance, then in forme, or action, in which they neere accord: I shall onely informe you of one moderne distinction, which some haue pleased for to make of Stage-Playes. Of Stage-Playes (say they) there are two sorts: The one popular, or publike, acted by hired, and professed Stage-Players: (the Playes wee haue now in hand,) and these they all confesse to be abominable, and unlawfull Pas-times: The other Academicall, managed onely by Schollers in priuate Schooles, and Colledges at some certaine seasons : and these they hold at least wise tollerable, if not lawfull, so as these sixe prouisoes be obserued : First, that there bee no Obscenitie, Scurrilitie, Prophanenesse, Amorous Loue-toyes, Wantonnesse, or Effeminacy mixed with these Playes: Secondly, that there bee no Womans part, no Dalliance, no Lustfull, nor Lasciuious Complements, Clippings, or Embracements in them: Thirdly, that there be no mention, or Inuocation of Heathen Gods, or Goddesses in them: Fourthly, that there be no putting on of Womans apparell, or any sumptuous, or costly attire: Fiftly, that these Playes produce no prodigall, or vnnecessary expence, either of money, or: time: Sixtly, that they be not ordinarily, but very rare, and seldome Acted; and that for the most part in the Latine tongue, for utterance, and learning sake alone, not for any gaine of money, or vaine-glory. If all, or any of these conditions faile (as what Achademicall Enterludes faile not, either in all, or most?) these very scholasticall Spectacles, become vnlawfull, euen by the most moderate mens confession. For the lawfulnesse, or Illegitimacy of our Achademicall Stage-Playes, I shall discusse it in its proper place: in the meane time, I shall addresse my selfe vnto the probate, of my precedent Conclusion: by Reasons, by Authorities. My Reasons to euince the vnlawfulnesse of Stage-Playes, I shall branch into these sixe seuerall Acts. The first, is drawne from the Originall Authors, and Inuentors of them: The second, from those Impious endes, to which they were destinated, and ordained at the first: The third, from their ordinary Stile, or subiect matter, which no Christian can euer iustifie, or excuse: The fourth, from the persons that Act, and parties who frequent them: The fift, from the very forme, and manner of their Action, and those seuerall parts, and circumstances which attend them: The sixt, from the pernitious effects, and sinfull fruites, which vsually, if not necessarily, and perpetually, issue from them. My Authorities doe marshall themselues into seuen seuerall Squadrons: The first, consisting of Scriptures: The second, of the whole Primitiue Church, both vnder the Law, and Gospel: The third, of Councells, and Canonicall, or Papall Constitutions: The fourth, of the ancient godly Fathers: The fift, of Moderne Christian writers of all sorts, as well Diuines, as others: The sixt, of Heathen Philosophers, Orators, Historians, and Poets: The last, of the Acts, and Edicts of sundry Christian, and Heathen States, and Emperours. All which, accompanied with the irrefragable, and plaine defeates of those pretences, which giue any colourable iustification to these Theatricall Enterludes; will giue no doubt a fatall, if not a finall ouerthrow, or Catastrophe to Playes, and Actors, whose dismall Tragoedie doeth now begin. That all popular, and common Stage-Playes, whether Comicall, Tragicall, Satyricall, Mimicall, or mixt of either, (especially, as they are now composed, and personated,) are such sinfull, hurtfull, and pernicious Recreations, as are altogether vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians : I shall first of all euidence, and prooue it, from their originall parents, and primary Inuentors: which were no other, but the very Deuill himselfe; or at leastwise, Idolatrous, and Voluptuous Pagans, impregnated with this infernall issue from Hell it selfe: from whence I argue in the first place, thus. That which had its birth, and primarie conception from the very Deuill himselfe, who is all, and onely euill; must needes be Sinfull, Pernicious, and altogether vnseemely, yea, Vnlawfull vnto Christians. But Stage-Playes had their birth, and primary conception, from the very Deuill himselfe, who is all, and onely euill. Therefore they must needes bee Sinfull, Pernicious, and altogether vnseemely, yea, Vnlawfull vnto Christians. The Minor, (which is onely liable to exception,) I shall easily make good: First, by the direct, and punctuall testimony of sundry Fathers.

Reinolds, Gosson , with sundry others in their Bookes, and Treatises against Stage-Playes : doe expressely testifie: That all Theatricall Playes or Enterludes, had their Originall birth from the very Deuill himselfe, who inuented them for his owne honour, and worship, to detaine men captiue by them, in his infernall snares : Whence they all condemne them, as sinfull, hurtfull, abominable, and vnlawfull pleasures: stiling all Play-houses: the. Temples, Chappels, Chaires, Shops, and Schooles of Satan : and Playes, the Deuils Spectacles, Lectures, Sacrifices, Recreations , and the like. If all these seuerall Witnesses then haue any credit: (as their testimony in our present case, was neuer contradicted to my knowledge, by any Christian, or Pagan Author:) my Minor, (yea, my Maior likewise,) neede no farther proofe: But yet to satisfie vncredulous spirits in this point, I shall here in the second place, recite some two, or three Histories of note, and credit, which prooue my assumption to the full. Memorable to this purpose, is that story in Tertullian ; who informes vs: that a Christian woman in his time, going to see a Stage-Play acted, returned from it possessed with a Deuill: which Deuill being interrogated by the Exorcists, and Christians that came to dispossesse him, how he durst assault a beleeuing Christian in such a presumptuous manner? Returned them this answere, with much boldnesse: that he had done most iustly in it , in meo enim eam inueni: for I found her in my owne Temple, negociated, and imployed in my seruice : Whence this acute, and learned Author doeth (as we also from it may) conclude: that Playes, and Play-houses came originally from the Deuill himselfe, because hee claimes both them, and those who doe frequent them for his owne . Adde wee to this, the storie of one Valesius a wealthy Roman: whose three children being desperately sicke of the Plague, and afterwards recouered by washing them in hote water, taken from the Altar of Proserpina: which remedy, was prescribed vnto him by an immediate voyce from his Deuill-Gods, after his earnest prayer to them, to translate their sickenesses on himselfe: these infernall Spirits, in recompence of this their cure,appearing to those recouered Patients in a Dreame: commanded them to celebrate Playes vnto them; which Valesius did accordingly: This story I shall couple with that of Titus Latinus as some; or Tiberius Attinius, as others stile him: to whom the great Deuill-god Iupiter Capitolinus, vnder the Consulship of Qu. Sulpitius Camerinus, &Sp. Largius Flauus,in a great mortality both of men, and beasts, appeared in a dreame: commanding him, to informe the Senate; that the cause of this fatalitie, was, their negligence, in not prouiding him an expert, and eminent Presultor in their last Playes, that they celebrated to him: and withall, to enioyne them from him, to celebrate these Playes afresh vnto him with greater care and cost, and then this Plague should cease: He supposing it to be a meere dreame, and fancy of his owne, neglects his arrant; vpon which this great Master-Deuill appeares unto him the second time, threatning to punish him for his precedent neglect, and charging him to dispatch his former message to the Senate: Who neglecting it as before, as being ashamed, and with all affraide, to relate it to the Senate , lest it should prooue nothing but his own priuate fancy: some few dayes after, his Sonne was taken away from him by sodaine death, and a griping sickenesse seised vpon euery part, and member of his body, so that he could not so much as stirre one ioynt, without intollerable paine and torture. Where upon, by the aduice of some of his friends, to whom he did impart these dreames, hee was carried up out of the Countrey in a litter, into the Senate house, where he deliuered his former message: no sooner had he ended his relation, but his sickenesse foorthwith leaues him; and rising out of his bed, he returnes unto his house an healthie man: The Senate wondring at it, commanded these Playes to bee againe renewed, with double the former pompe and cost; and so the Pestilence ceased. These two precedent parallell Histories, (the trueth of which the Fathers in the margent testifie, (doe infallibly demonstrate, the Deuill himselfe to bee the Authour of these Stage-Playes, since he inioynes his Pagan worshippers to celebrate them to his honour, and takes such pleasure, and contentment in them. To these, I shal annexe one story more, which though most Protestants may chance to slight, as a fable; yet all our Roman Catholiques, (who are much deuoted to these Theatricall Spectacles,) will ready subscribe vnto it, as an vndoubted trueth: and that as our rare Historian, Mathew Paris at large relates it, is briefely this: Saint Dominicke, Saint Iulian, and one Thurcillus a plaine Husband-man, being in the Church of Saint Maries, about the middle of the world, where there were many Soules of Saints departed, in endlesse Blisse, others in Purgatory: on a Saturndey euening neere night: saw a Deuill towards the North part of the Church, riding post towards Hell on a blacke horse, with many damned Soules: Saint Dominicke chargeth this Deuill to come presently to him: who delaying to doe it, out of ioy for the great bootie of Soules which he had gotten, Saint Dominicke takes a rod, and whips him well, causing him to follow him to the North side of the Church, where Soules were usually freed; where the Deuill among other things informes him, that euery Lords day at night, (a time which some men consecrate and set apart for Stage-Playes, and such infernall Pastimes, whereas Saint Paul did spend it all in preaching:) the Deuils did vse to meete in Hell, and there did recreate, and exhilarate themselues with Stage-Playes: Which Saint Dominicke, and the others hearing, they desired the Deuill, that they might goe along with him to Hell, to see their Enterludes: who putting by Thurcillus, permitted Saint Dominicke, and Saint Iulian to accompany him the Deuill brings them into a large, but smokie house towards the North, enuironed with three wals; where they see an ample Theater with seates round about it, where sundry Deuils sate in a row laughing, and making themselues merry with the torments and sinnes of the Damned, whom the Prince of the Deuils commanded to bee brought upon the Stage, and to Act their parts in order. And first of all, the Proud man is brought upon the Theater: next an idle Nonresident, who did not feede his Flocke, neither by Life, nor Doctrine: then a Souldier, who had liued by Murther, and Rapine: then an Oppressing, and Bribe-taking Lawyer, who was once an Officer in the Kings Exchequer, and did much oppresse the Subiects: next an Adulterer, and an Adulteresse: then a Sclanderer: next a Thefe: and last of all, a Sacrilegious person, who had violated Sanctuaries; all these comming in their seuerall garbes, and postures, did Act their proper parts, and had seuerall Tragicall tortures inflicted on them by the Deuils Ministers, who were likewise Spectators of these Ludibrious Spectacles. If then the Deuils recreate themselues thus in Hell with Stage-Playes, as this Historian reports; if they thus Proiect, and Puruay for them; they may be well reputed the primary Authors, and Inuentors of them. Lastly, that which is vtterly displeasing vnto God , and wholy fraught with Scurrility, Prophannesse, Sinne, and Wickednesse: that which was at first deuoted to the Deuils immediate worship, and cannot any wayes bee deemed the inuention, or product, either of God himselfe, who is infinitely holy, and therefore, no Proiector of such unholy pleasures:) or of Christians, or ciuill Pagans; must of necessitie be fathered on the Deuill himselfe , who is the common seed-plot of all vncleannesse, and prophannesse whatsoeuer: But such are Stage-Playes: as hereafter I shall prooue at large: Therefore they must of necessitie, call the Deuill Father, and be reputed as his of-spring: so that the Assumption of my former argument is irrefragable. For the Maior: That things which had their birth, and primary conception from the Deuill himselfe, who is all, and onely euill, must needes bee sinfull, pernicious, vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians: I presume, no Christian dares gaine-say it: For what honest, profitable, good, or lawfull thing, can flow, or issue from him, who is wholy euill, and walkes about in an indefatigable, and restlesse manner, like a roring Lyon, seeking whom he may deuoure ? Can a bitter Fountaine, send foorth sweete, and pleasant streames ? Or can a corrupt Tree bring foorth good, and holesome fruite ? Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse ; or a good thing out of wickednesse? It is past the skill of any Chymicke, or artist to effect it. Certainely, such as the Mother is, such is the Daughter: that which is borne of the flesh, is flesh, and that which is borne of the spirit, is spirit: Now the Deuill, is an uncleane, a wicked, a sinfull, and pernicious Spirit: there is no good at all within him: his inuentions, workes, and of-spring, therefore must resemble him: they must be euill, uncleane, pernicious, and abominable, like himselfe : Men doe not, men cannot gather Grapes of Thornes, or Figges of Thistles: such as the stocke is, such must bee the fruite; as Scripture, Nature, Reason, and Experience teach vs. Since then the Deuill himselfe, is all, and onely euill, abominable, polluted, and pernicious; I meane in his qualitie, as a Deuill, not in his entitie, as a creature: these Stage-playes (which are his proper, and immediate issue) must bee so too: if not to Pagans, inthralled to his bondage, and captiuated at his pleasure in his snares: yet at least to such, as lay any title to the name of Christians: who haue vowed in their very Baptisme, and first admittance into the Church of Christ: to forsake the deuill, and all his workes: of which these Stage-Playes , are well-nigh the chiefe: Oderis itaque Christiane, quorum Auctores non poteris non odisse: needes then must all Christians hate these Stage-Playes, whose Author they cannot chuse but hate: needes must they repute them euill, abominable, and pernicious; yea, altogether such; since the genitor, and parent of them, is wholly, onely, alwayes such, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? was a question, that sincere Nathaniel demanded once of Philip , when hee brought tidings to him of Christ: Can any good thing come out of Hell? out of Satan; out of that wicked, and vncleane infernall Spirit, who plots the ruine of mens Soules, and nothing else ? is the demand I make to such who are inamoured with these Stage-Playes. Alas, what Christian, or Pagan heart, can so much as once conceiue; that the professed enemie of mankinde , of God, of goodnesse: the fountaine of all sinne, and wickednesse: the very sincke, and center of all vncleannesse, should be the Author, Propagator, or Contriuer of any reall good: of any thing that furthers the happinesse, or well-fare of the sonnes of men? Was it euer knowne since the world was framed; that this onely Author of all euill, was the cause of any good? of any inuention that might benefit the Bodies, or Soules of men, or further their Temporall, or Eternall well-fare? Oh no: the experience of all ages, all men, all Christians prooues it: For though the Deuill may sometimes commend some seeming good vnto vs: yet latet anguis in herba : there is alwayes poyson, in his best, and sweetest Potions: there is a Soule-intangling snare, in all his inuentions: a dangerous, and ineuitable hooke in all his baites: all his workes, contriuances, and delights, what euer glittering out-side, or Honie tasts, they seeme to haue; are but so many trappes, and poysons, to captiuate, and indanger Soules: they are all abominable, and pernicious, like himselfe: and so are Stage-Playes too, as well as others: O then let this conuince them to bee vnlawfull, vnseemely, and pernicious vanities: (as the fore-quoted Fathers, and Authors in the Minor haue deemed them for this very reason;) and now at last perswade all Christians, all Pagans, (vnlesse they will sweare homage to the Deuill, and renounce the seruice, and protection of the Liuing, onely God;) for euer to abominate them, as the very product of Satan, and the broode of Hell. But admit, that the Deuill himselfe were not the immediate forger, and parent of these Theatricall Enterludes, which no man can disprooue by any Orthodox recordes: yet this must needes be granted: that Idolatrous Infidels, and the deboisest Pagans, were the first Actors, and Contriuers of them, and that by the very Instinct, and Tutorship of the Deuill , whose instruments they were: and this alone doeth brand them for euill, and vnlawfull pleasures, which Christians may not practise; as this second Argument will cleerely euidence. That which had its rise, its pedigree, and being from Idolatrous Infidels; and the Deboisest Pagans, (who were the Deuils agents in this seruice:) must needes bee sinfull, vnlawfull, vnseemely, and pernicious; at least wise vnto Christians. But Stage-Playes, if wee take them in their very best conception, had their rise, their pedigree, and being, from Idolatrous Infidels, and the Deboisest Pagans, who were the Deuils Factors in this seruice. Therefore they must needes be sinfull, vnlawfull, and pernicious; at least wise vnto Christians. For the Maior, I shall clearely euidence it, by Authentique Recordes; which though they somewhat vary in the particular persons, yet they all concurre in this: that Pagans, and Infidels, were the first contriuers of these Stage- Playes. Athenaeus, with others , informes vs: that the Athenians were the primary composers of Comicall Enterludes, in imitation of those drunken Husband-men, who Sacrificed, and made Playes to Bacchus, the God of their Vineyards: Plutarch relates, that Comedies, and Tragoedies, tooke their Originall from Homer: Clemens Alexandrinus records: that one Thespis: Quintilian , that Æ schylus, was the first who brought Tragoedies to light . Who euer he was, that first inuented these playes among the Graecians; yet all concurre, that the Romans (who as it seemes, deriued them from the Greekes ,) did first imbrace them vpon this occasion. when as there was a great Plague in Rome, which could not be aswaged by any Diuine, or humane helpes, the Romanes to appease the wrath of their enraged Deuill-gods, sent into Tuscanie for Stage-Players: among whom, one Hister, being more eminent, and expert then the rest, as most: or the Ætrurian word Hister, which signifieth a Play, as others: gaue the name of Histrio, which denominates an Actor, or Player, to all succeeding Stage-Players: How Stage-Playes, which were more rude, and plaine at first, came to be more refined, and inlarged afterwards, I shall referre you, to these marginall Authors, which will at large informe you : onely this I shall say in briefe; that both the inception, and grouth to Stage-Playes, by the consent of all Recordes, was from Idolatrous Infidels, and voluptuous Pagans, whose wayes, and workes, we Christians must not follow. For the Maior, I willingly acknowledge; that those inuentions of Infidels, and Pagans, which may further Gods glory, or the good of men: as Musicke, Poetrie, Husbandry, Nauigation, Architecture, Letters, Writing, and the like: are lawfull vnto Christians; because they issue from those common gifts, which God himselfe implanted in them: but as for all their noxious, improfitable, and vaine productions, which dishonour God; which preiudice mens Soules, and were destinated at first to sinfull endes , (which is the case of Stage- Playes:) these Christians must auoyde: if for no other reason, yet for this one alone: that the Heathen Gentiles were the Authors, fomentors, and frequenters of them. Hence God himselfe doeth charge the Israelites: That when they were possessed of the Land of Canaan, they should beware, that they committed not any of those abominable customes, which were committed before them, by the Cananites: that they should not defile themselues therein, but take heede, lest they were taken in a snare after them, lest they should aske after their Gods, saying: how did those Nations serue their Gods, that I might doe so likewise: Hence Christ himselfe enioynes all Christians, not to vse vaine repetitions when they pray, as the Heathen doe, who thinke to be heard, for their much babling: be ye not therefore (saith hee) like vnto them: Not to take thought, what wee shall eate, or what we shall drinke, or wherewith we shall bee cloathed: and what is his reason? For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke: Hence Saint Paul doeth exhort the Thessalonians to possesse their vessels in holinesse, and honour; not in the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles doe: Hence Saint Peter informes vs: that the time past of our liues, may suffice vs to haue wrought the will of the Gentiles: Hence Saint Paul exhorts the Ephesians, that they should not hencefoorth, walke as other Gentiles in the vanities of their mindes, in Lasciuiousnesse, and all Vncleanenesse: Hence the Prophet Ieremie, speakes thus vnto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord, learne not the way of the Heathen, and be not dismayed at the signes of Heauen , marke his reason: for the Heathen are dismayed, at them . Hence God himselfe, doeth oft times in the Scriptures, reprooue, and blame the Israelites , Manasseh, and others and likewise threaten Iudgements against them, for going after the Heathen, that were round about them: for running after their vanities, customes, fashions, and abominations, concerning whom the Lord had said, that they should not doe like them, nor learne their workes: Hence is it, that God reputed the desire of a King, which in it selfe is lawfull, a hainous sinne in the Israelites, because it issued from an apish imitation of other people: that they also in this respect, might be like all other Nations: and hence, did hee threaten to visit , not onely the inferiour ranke of the Israelites; but euen the Children, and Courteours of their Kings, for wearing strange Apparell and taking vp the garbes, and fashions, of those Pagans which bordered round about them. If then it bee vnlawfull to imitate, not onely the abominations, rites, and ceremonies: but euen the prayers, cares, and feare: the gouernment, and strange Apparell, of Infidels, and Pagans, as all these Scriptures strongly euidence: much more must it bee vile, and sinfull, to trace their foote-steps, in practising, approouing, and frequenting, their Histrionicall Stage-inuentions, which haue no good, nor profit in them. How chary, and fearefull the Saints of God in former ages were, of admitting the Festiuities, Customes, Ceremonies, Reliques, or Inuentions of Idolatrous Pagans; how ready they were to disauow them; may appeare by sundry instances, that are Parallell with Stage-Playes. Tertullian, condemnes the wearing of a Laurell Crowne, or flowrie Garland by way of Triumph, in a Christian Souldier; because those Crownes and Garlands, were first inuented by the Deuill, and worne by his Minions, to his honour. The councell of Africke, Canon 27. Prohibits Christians to make Feasts,or Morrice-daunces, on the Birth-days of Martyres, because such Feasting, and Dauncing, had their Originall from Gentilisme . The Councell of Ancyra, or Engury, Canon 21. exposeth all Christians to fiue yeares penance, who shall observe any Prophesies, Dreames, Diuinations, or Fortune-tellers, after the customes of the Gentiles, or should entertaine such Diuiners, or South-sayers in their houses . The second Councell of Towers, Canon 23. The Councell of Antisyodorum, Canon 1. Saint Augustine, De Rectitud. Cathol. Conuersationis. Tract. Tom. 9. pag. 1448. Saint Ambrose, Oration. 11. Gratian, Causa, 26 Quest. 7. condemne the observation of Newyeeres-day, and the sending of Newyeeres-gifts, as a sinne, threatning Excommunication, both from the Church, and Sacraments, to such who should observe it: because they were but the Reliques, and Obseruations of Pagans, who Consecrated this day, to the honour of Ianus their Deuill-God, and sent reciprocall Newyeeres-gifts to their friends upon it. The first Councell of Braga, Canon 29. Prohibits all such, who are ordained Readers in the Church, to sing in a Secular habit, or to give over their degree, after the manner of the Gentiles: The French Synod under Pope Zacharie, in the yeere 742. enioyned all Bishops, to give all diligence to inhibit, and keepe backe Christians, from all the Reliques of Paganisme, and Gentilisme: as Pageants, Southsayings, Diuinations, Lot-fortunes, Sacrifices to Saints, and Martyres, neere to Churches, after a Pagan manner; Sacrilegious fires, called Nedfire, or Bone-fires, with all other Heathenish Observations, and Ceremonies; because they are vnbeseeming Christians. The canons of the Greekes synods, collected by Martin, Bishop of Braga, Can. 71,72,73,74,75. Prohibit the entertainement of Southsayers, Fortune-tellers, and Diuiners, into Christians houses, after the custome of the Pagans, either to expell some euill out of them, or to purge them by some Pagan spelles, vnder fiue yeeres pennance. Yea, they say expressely: that it is vnlawfull for Christians, to retaine the traditions of the Gentiles, in observing the course of the Elements, Moone, or starres, or the vaine fallacies of signes; in building Houses, in sowing Corne, in planting Trees, or solemnizing Marriages: that it is vnlawfull to obserue Calends, or to addict themselues to Heathenish Feastiualls, and Delights; or to decke vp their Houses with Laurell, Yuie, and greene boughes, (as we vse to doe in the Christmas season:) because all this observation is descended of Paganisme: and that Christians may not observe, or vse any Spelles, or Ceremonies, in gathering medicinall Hearbes, or in their lanifices; because the Heathens did observe them. The fourth Councell of Carthage, Canon 16. together with Saint Hierome, Epist. 22. cap.13. Prohibit christian Bishops, to read the Bookes of the Gentiles. The Councell of Laodicea, Canon 37.39. The Councell of Ancyra, Canon 5, 6, 7. Saint Ambrose Orat. 3. Tertullian De Spectaculis. lib. with sundry others informe vs: that it is a great sinne to observe the Feastiualls, or Solemnities of Pagans; to be present with them at their Feasts; to retaine their Feastivall-gifts; or to communicate with them in their Ceremonies, which are not of God: whence they prohibit Christians from them, under paine of Excommunication, and two yeeres Penance. The sixt Councell of Constantinople, Canon 96. Excommunicates all such as shall sweare the Oathes of the Gentiles: Yea, the same generall Councell, canon 62. disanulles, and condemnes the obseruation of the Calends, and Winter votes: all meetings, on the first of March; all public Dauncing of Women: all Mummings, Dauncings, Sportes, and Ceremonies, which might prouoke Laughter, vnder the name of Bacchus, or any other, which was falsely named a God among the Gr aecians: inflicting Excommunication, and Deposition on those that should from thence observe them, because they were the Impostures of Satan, and the Sportes, and Vanities of the Heathen: Yea, canon 65. It prohibits the making of Bone-fires on New-moones, before the Houses, or shops of Christians; together with all skipping, iesting, and fooling about them, after the Ancient custome, vnder the foresaid penaltie; as being a Pagan practise, condemned in Manasseh: in the 2 Chro.33. 2.5,6. And Can. 70. it informes vs: that Christians who are taught the Lawes of God, ought not to vse the manners, Tumblings, Playes, and Vestments of the Gr aecian Infidels. Saint Basil, and Saint Augustine, condemne the Drinking, and Pledging of Healthes, from this very ground; that they were the inuention of the Deuill, and the obseruations, or reliques of Infidels, and Pagans: Clemens Romanus, Constit. Apostol. lib. 2. cap. 66. The third Councell of Arles: The third Councell of Toledo, Canon 23. Nazienzen. Oratio. 48. p. 796, 797. Cyrillus. Hierusol. Catech. Mystag.

And yet the Papists are not ashamed for to vse them: Saint Hierome, and Theodoret, in their Commentaries, and Interpretations on Ezech. 44.20. which inioyne the priests, not to shaue their heads, but onely to poll them; make the ground of this Iniunction, the practise of the Idolatrous Priests of Isis, and Serapis, who did vse to shaue their crowne, and beards, and make bald their heads. Yet notwithstanding, this expresse command of God himselfe, which is likewise seconded by Leuit. 19. 27. and 21. 5 All Popish Priests, and Friers, doe shaue their heads, and beards, in imitation of these, and other Idolatrous Priests, and Nations; Yea, they doe inioyne this Tonsure to them by sundry Councells, and Decrees: for which not onely Protestants, but euen their owne Popish writers doe condemne them, as Heathenish, and absurd; Pope Anicetus was the first that made this innouation: as Gratian. Distinctio. 33. Polyd. Virgil. De Inuent. Rerum. lib. 4.cap. 8. and Lorinus on Leuit. 19.27. record: contrary to the expresse Word of God; and the fourth Councell of Carthage. Canon 44. which inioyneth Clerkes, or Clergie-men: neither to let their haire grow long, nor yet to shaue their beards: which their Binius, Surius, Carranza, and Crabb, haue miserably corrupted: as Iohn Valerian in his booke, De Sacerdotum barbis , witnesseth: rendring it in this mannner. Clerici nec comam nutriant, nec barbam; shauing away this word radant, from the latter clause, as a superfluous excrement; because it expressely condemnes their Effeminate, Vinnaturall, Heathenish, and Popish shauing. If then these seuerall Fathers, and Councells haue vtterly condemned, these Morrice-daunces, Bone-fires, Newyeeres-gifts, Newyeeres-dayes, Diuinations, Lotteries, Mummings, Dancings, Healthes, Tapers, Shauen-crownd, and bare- chind Priests, together with all the other fore-recited Ceremonies, Customes, and Obseruations, (which are now too frequent among Christianes,) as sinfull and abominable, because they were in vse among the Gentiles, and had their rise, and birth from Pagans: then certainely, by the same analogie of reason; wee must needes reiect, and censure Stage-Playes, as pernicious, vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians, because they had their birth, their authoritie, vse, and progresse from Idolatrous Heathens, and the deboisest Pagans.

Canon 26,27. D. Reinolds, Gosson, and Northbrooke, in their Books gainst Stage-Playes; together with sundry other Councells, and Authors, which I shall muster up hereafter; condemne these Stage-Playes, as vnlawfull, and misbeseeming Christians; euen because they were the Inuentions, Sportes, and Ceremonies of Gentiles, which Christians must not entertaine. Now there is in trueth great reason, why Christians should not imitate, nor imbrace the Pleasures, Sportes, and ceremonies of the Heathen, though many Libertines, and Licentious Christians, who make their will, and lusts their law, may deeme it Puritanisme, or brand it for ouer- strict precisenesse, in this dissolute, and vnruly age. For first, the Scriptures doe positiuely informe vs; that Righteousnesse hath no fellowship with Vnrighteousnesse; nor Light with Darkenesse: that Christ hath no concord with Belial; that he that beleeueth, hath no part,nor portion with an Infidell: that the Temple of God hath no agreement with Idoles: and that we cannot drinke the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Deuils, nor be partakers of the Lords table, and of the table of Deuils. If then Christ, if Christians, and Infidels haue no communion; great reason is it, that they should not intercommon in these Heathenish Spectacles, and delights of sinne. Secondly, all Christians haue vowed in their Baptisme: to forsake the Deuill and all his workes, the Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinfull lustes of the flesh: and haue they any reason then, to harbour, or retaine the Ceremonies of Worldlings, or Enterludes of Pagans, which they haue thus seriously renounced? Thirdly, all true and reall Christians, are Redeemed by the red, and precious blood of Iesus Christ, from ( the ordinances, [illeg.]ments, and customes of the world: from their vaine conuersation receiued by tradition from their Fathers: they are purchased from off the earth, and from among the sonnes of men: they are ransomed, and taken out of this World, and made men of another world, that so they might haue their whole conuersation with God in Heauen; and walke on in all holy conuersation, and godlinesse, seruing God in holinesse, and true Righteousnesse, all the dayes of their liues: Christ Iesus himselfe hath bought them at the dearest rate for this very end, that they should no longer liue to the world, or to the will, and lusts of men, but unto him alone: that they should cast off the workes of Darkenesse, and put on the armor of Light: that they should not hencefoorth walke as other Gentiles, in the vanities of their mindes, following the desires of the flesh, and of the minde, giuing themselues ouer to Lasciuiousnesse, and vncleannesse: that the time past of their liues might suffice them to haue wrought the will of the Gentiles, when as they walked in Lasciuiousnesse, Lusts, Reuellings, Banquetings, and abominable idolatries: that they should now denie vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and walke soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, looking for the blessed comming, and appearance of their Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: that they should not hencefoorth walke according to the course of this world, according to the power of the Prince of the ayre, which now worketh in the children of disobedience: but that they should be pure, and vndefiled before God, keeping themselues vnspotted from the World: Since therefore Iesus Christ hath thus Redeemed all Christians from the World, and all its Pagan customes, pleasures, ceremonies, and delights of sinne, that so they might be holy, and blamelesse before him in loue. and become a peculiar people to him, Zealous of good workes: great reason is there, that they should abominate all Pagan practises, Enterludes, and Ceremonies, as vnlawfull, and misbeseeming Christians:else they should but euacuate, and make voyde vnto themselues the death of Christ: yea trample vnder feete his precious blood, and put him vnto open shame: And would any Christian be so ingratefull, so dispitefull to his blessed Sauiour, (whose bleeding wounds doe preach Saluation to his fiercest enemies, ) as thus to wrong, and shame him? Fourthly, mans nature is exceeding prone to Paganisme, and Heathenish superstition; as is euident, not onely by the frequent Apostasies of the Israelites to grosse Idolatrie, recorded in the Scriptures ; but likewise by that generall deluge of Heathenisme, Mahometisme, and hideous Idolatrie, which now, and alwayes heretofore, hath ouerspred the greatest part of all the world: God therefore out of his Fatherly care, and compassion to his Children, to anticipate all occasions, which might withdraw them from him, to Idolatrie; doeth oft times prohibit them, to imitate the Fashions, Customes, Uanities, Habites, Rites, or Ceremonies of Infidels, and Heathen Gentiles; for feare lest one thing should draw on another by degrees, till they were quite Apostatized to Idolatrie, and seduced from the Faith. Whereupon, Saint Augustine exhorts all Christians, to prohibit the vse of all diabolicall Enterludes, Vacillations, and songs of the Gentiles: and that no Christian should exercise any of these, because by this he is made a Pagan . Since therefore the imitation of Pagan customes, pleasures, and delights, are but so many ingredients, and allectiues to Paganisme, and grosse Idolatrie; and since they alienate, or at least in some degree, disioyne our affections from God, and heauenly things; there is ground, and cause enough, that Christians should reiect them, as sinfull, and pernicious. So that vpon all these authorities, and reasons, (the force of which no pious heart is euer able to withstand:) I may safely conclude this second Sc aene, with this short Corollary: That Stage-Playes are sinfull, vnseemely, pernicious, and vnlawfull, at least wise vnto Christians; because they were the inuentions, ceremonies, and pastimes of Idolatrous Infidels, and the most Licentious Heathens, ( who were no other but the DeuilsPurueyers, ) whom Christians must not imitate. Secondly, as Stage-Playes are thus sinfull, vnseemely, pernicious, and vnlawfull vnto Christians, in regard of their originall, and primitiue Inuentors: so likewise are they such in respect of those Idolatrous, vnwarrantable, and Vnchristian ends, to which they were destinated, and designed at the first. The chiefe and primarie end of inuenting, instituting, or personating Stage-Playes; was the superstitious worship, or at least wise, the pacification, or attonement, of Iupiter, Bacchus, Neptune, the Muses, Flora, Apollo, Diana, Venus, Victoria, or some such Devill-gods, or Goddesses, which the Idolatrous Pagans did adore; to whose honour, names, and memories, these Playes (which were alwayes Acted, and celebrated heretofore, as the insuing Authours testifie, on those Festiuall, and Solemne dayes, which were dedicated to the speciall seruice, and commemoration of these Idoles:) were at first deuoted. That Stage-Playes, (yea, and Theaters, or Play-houses too,) were primarily inuented for the honour, and Dedicated to the seruice (or at least-wise oft times Celebrated in times of Pestilence, to appease the anger,) of these Idole-Gods, whose Images, and Pictures, were carried about, and represented in them: wee haue the expresse authorities, not onely of Plutarch, in the life Of Romulus, and Roman ae Quaest.

Sect. 3. cap. 1. to 12. with many other Moderne writers; who all giue punctuall, vnanimous, and vncontrouleable testimonie: That Stage-Playes were at first inuented, and celebrated to the honour: and for many hundred yeeres together appropriated to the solemne worship, and seruice of these Idole-Gods; who oft times called for them to attone their anger, diuert their iudgements, demerit their protection, or reward their fauours . The originall end, and primary vse of Stage-Playes then, was odious, and Idolatrous, as all these Authours testifie: Therefore these Playes themselues, (as the recited Fathers, and Christian Writers doe from thence inferre,) must needes be sinfull, and vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians. I confesse, that since the natiuitie, and birth of Stage-Playes, they haue beene sometimes wrested by the Heathen, to some other distorted, and Vnchristian ends, besides the worship, or pacification of their Idole-Gods. Sometimes they haue beene instituted, and performed, by way of Victory, and Triumph; and that commonly, in execution of a preuious solemne vow, made to some Deuil-God, by the victorious Generall, before the Battell ioyned: of which wee haue frequent examples in the Roman Histories: whose chiefe Commanders, did vsually vow some solemne Playes, and Sacrifices to their Gods, if they would be so propitious towards them, as to giue them the honour of the Field, and chasing of their Enemies: which vowes they did performe accordingly, vpon their wished successe . Other times they haue beene purposely celebrated, to bee a kinde of Pander to mens lusts: Witnesse the Playes that Romulus made, to betray the Sabine Uirgines, to the Rape, and Lusts of his vnmarried souldiers: (vpon whose Rauishment, there arose a bloody warre:) to which end, and use, they serue as yet . Other times they haue beene Acted for Lasciuiousnesse, delight, and pleasure sake, (the onely vse which men pretend for Stage-Playes now:) Hence Polidor Uirgil obserues; that Comedies tooke their denomination from the Greeke words [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) :  which signifies, to play the Wanton, or Lasciuious person. Others derive their name, from Comus; the God of wantonnesse, and riot: others from ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif)  [illeg.] [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/zgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) :  : because they were Lasciuiously Acted heretofore in wayes, being fraught with petulant, and wanton words:  all of them concurring in this; that their end is nothing else, but Lasciuious, Carnall, and Vnchristian mirth; and therefore euill, and vnlawfull. If then this bee yeelded to mee, (as of necessitie it must be:) that Stage-Playes were originally, destinated, yea, appropriated, to the fore- recited Idolatrous, and vnlawfull ends, but more especially, to the honour, and seruice of abominable Idoles, to whose solemne worship they were actually deuoted, for many hundred yeeres together, and that by their owne speciall command, which makes them wholly theirs: I shall hence inferre a third argument. That inuention which was primarily ordained, yea, for many hundred yeeres together, appropriated, and deuoted, to the immediate worship, and solemne gratification of Deuil-gods; must of necessitie be pernicious, vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians, especially, if it be not necessary, or vsefull vnto men. But Stage-Playes were primarily ordained, yea, for many hundred yeeres together, appropriated, and deuoted, to the immediate worship, and solemne gratification of Deuil-gods, and they are no wayes necessary, nor vsefull vnto men. Therefore they must of necessitie be Pernicious, Vnseemely, and Vnlawfull vnto Christians. The Maior is euident by the cloud of witnesses, recited in the premises; by those seuerall historicall authorities, recorded in the first Act, and Scaene of this Tragedie, to prooue the Deuill, the Author of these Enterludes: and by the generall acknowledgement of all Learned writers: so that I may spare all further proofe. The Maior, no Christian can, or dares denie, vnlesse hee will turne professed Proctor for the Deuill: If any bee so Heathenish, or Atheisticall, as to gaine-say it, I shall easily euict the trueth of it, by these ensuing reasons. First, it must bee acknowledged, that those things, which euery Christian doeth solemnely renounce in his very Baptisme, must needs be pernicious, vnseemely, and vnlawfull, else why should he renounce them? But euery Christian doeth seriously abiure in his very Baptisme, all such Inuentions, which were primarily ordained, and for many hundred yeeres together appropriated, to the solemne worship, and gratification of Deuil-gods, (as Stage-Playes were:) for hee couenants by his sureties; to forsake the Deuill and all his workes: therefore the Maior must be yeelded. Secondly, that which God himselfe commanded in a more speciall manner, to be abolished and reiected; that must needes be pernicious, vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians. But God himselfe, hath in a speciall manner, commanded all reliques, monuments, parts, and appendices of Idoles, (especially, such as were primarily consecrated, and wholly appropriated to their vse,) to bee vtterly abolished, and reiected. Hence hee enioynes the Israelites: not to follow the customes of the Canaanites, nor yet to inquire after them, saying: how did these Nations worship their Gods, that I might doe so likewise Hence hee commanded them, to burne the Groues, the images, with all the appurtensnces of Idole-gods, with fire: to destroy their Altars, pull downe their Temples, cut off their Priests, and worshippers, abolish their memories, abandon their ceremonies, and not so much as to save, or reserue any remnant of them, but vtterly to abhorre, and detest them, as an accursed thing . Yea, hence hee obligeth them, to destroy even the very names of their Idoles: not to make mention of the names of other Gods: not to suffer them to be heard out of their mouthes nor yet so much, as to participate of any of their Sacrifices, Rites, or Ceremonies. Therefore since God hath giuen such speciall charge against the reliques, and monuments of Idolatrie heretofore: it cannot but be sinfull, vnseemely, and Vnchristian, for vs to foster, or admit of Stage-Playes, or any other Inuentions now, which were originally ordained, and for many hundred yeeres together appropriated , to the solemne worship, and gratification of Idole-deuill- Gods. Thirdly, the Scriptures doe peremptorily enioyne all Christians, to abstaine from things offered, consecrated vnto Idoles: as these Stage-Playes were. First, because the things which the gentiles Sacrifice, they Sacrifice to Deuills, and not to God: therefore those that participate of them, must needes haue communion with the Deuill: and I would not (saith the Apostle) that ye should haue fellowship with deuills. Secondly, because Christians cannot drinke the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Deuills: they cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and the Table of Deuills: for what fellowship hath Righteousness, with Vnrighteousness? what communion hath Light with Darkenesse? what concorde hath Christ with Belial? what part hath hee that Beleeueth with an Infidell? or what agreement hath the Temple of god with Idoles? God, and the Deuill, Christ, and Belial, are contrary, are inconsistent: therefore the seruice, and ceremonies of the one, are altogether incompatible with the other. Thirdly, because Christians must not bee unequally yoaked with vnbeleeuers, with whom they haue no part nor fellowship: now if they should communicate with the Gentiles in Stage-Playes, or things consecrated to their Idoles: they should bee then vnequally yoaked, they should haue part, and fellowship with Infidels, in this respect: which God will not allow of. Fourthly, because the Consciences of the weaker brethren, should not be grieued, offended, defiled, or emboldened, by others participation of these Idolatrous Sacrifices: to their ruine, and the Gospels scandall: Fiftly, because all the Sacrifices, reliques, and ceremonies of Idoles, are an abomination to the Lord, and therefore prouoke him vnto wrath, to our destruction. Lastly, because they are a ready meanes to withdraw our hearts from God vnto Idolatrie therefore Wee must seperate from them, and not so much as touch them, else God will not receive vs as his people . Since therefore God vpon all the former reasons doeth thus seriously, and frequently prohibit, such ceremonies, and inuentions, as were instituted, and destinated to the Deuills seruice at the first: My Maior is irrefragable, and my conclusion true: That Stage-Playes are pernicious, vnseemely, and vnlawful vnto Christians; because they were at first devoted to the honour, and for many hundred yeeres together, designed to the worship of some Idole-Gods, by the very Deuils fauourites. All that can bee here replied to euade this Argument, is reducible to these two heads, First, that the Dedication of Stage-Playes to these Deuill-gods, did onely Contract a Guilt, or Sinfulnesse vpon those particular Playes, that were really appropriated to their worship, and Celebrated to their honour: but not vpon all the kinde. Secondly, that though Pagans, or others haue abused Stage-Playes, to Idolatrous, and vnlawfull ends, yet this is no impediment, but that Christians may reduce them to a commendable, and lawfull vse, so that we cannot well conclude: That all popular Stage-Playes are vnlawfull, because the first of them were inuented, and for a long tract of time deuoted, to the Deuills worship. To the first of these, I answere with Tertullian: that though the consecrating of any profitable, and vsefull Inuentions to Idole-Gods: as of Letters, and Trade to Mercurie: of Musicke, and Poetrie to Apollo: of Physicke, to  Æsculapius: of Ships, and Nauigation to Neptune, and Minerua: of Wine to Bacchus: of Corne, and Husbandrie to Ceres: of Fire, and Smitherie to Vulcan: and the like, by whom they were inuented, as Heathen Poets, and Historians faine: doeth no wayes vitiate, or defile them in the generall, but that they are, and may be lawfull vnto Christians; because they are absolutely necessary, at leastwise vsefull, vnto men: for whose benifit by Gods prouidence, they were at first inuented: Euen as the sacrificing of a Male-goate to Bacchus: of a Cocke to Æsculapius: of a Bull to Iupiter: of a Lambe, or She-goate vnto Iuno: of an Horse to Mars: of a Doue to Venus: of a Swine to Pan: of a Doe, or Heifer to Minerua: or of Myrre, and Frankincense to other Idoles, did stampe no Impresse of vnlawfulnesse, or vnholinesse, on the whole kindes, or species of these seuerall creatures; (which did still retaine their entitiue goodnesse in them:) though it did so defile those Indiuiduall, and particular creatures that were immediately offered up in Sacrifice to them, that Christians might not lawfully eate of them . Though, I say, it bee alwayes true in case of profitable Inuentions, or Gods good creatures: that the peruerting of them to Idolatrous ends, doeth lay a blemish vpon the depraued Indiuidualls onely, not impose an vnlawfulnesse on the whole species, or other Indiuidualls of their kinde: Yet it is vndoubtedly true; that the destinating, and denoting of Vnprofitable, Pleasurable, Heathenish Infamous, Scandalous, and vnnecessary Inuentions, which neither the Scriptures, nor Primitive Church approued, to Idolatrous, and Sinfull ends, (and that from their very first conception, which is the case of Stage- Playes,) doeth make not onely the deuoted Indiuidualls; but likewise the whole kinde it selfe, vnlawfull vnto Christians; so that no particulars of this nature may be vsed. Hence Tertullian concludes; that it is vtterly vnlawfull for Christians to weare a Laurell Crowne, or flowrie Garland in any case, though it be by way of Triumph; because these Crownes were first inuented for the honour, worne to the worship, and consecrated to the seruice of Pagan Deuill-gods : Hence the selfe-same Father affirmes; that it is no wayes lawfull, for Christians to retaine the names of Iupiter, Bacchus, Apollo, or other Idole-gods, or to impose them on their children: because they were the names of Idoles at the first: therefore vnlawfull to bee used now : Hence the Fathers, Councells, and fore-recited Protestant Authors, condemne all Diuinations Morrice-dances, Bonefires, Newyeeres-gifts; the obseruation of Newyeeres-day; or the Calends of Ianuary: Effeminate mixt Dauncing ; especially, at Weddings , where it is now most in vse: burning of Tapers in Churches, especially in the day-time, as the Papists vse: shauing of Priests crownes, and beardes, &c. as vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians now; because they Were Reliques of Idolatrie; yea, Sacrifices, appendices, and deuoted ceremonies of Idoles heretofore : if then it bee true in all these cases; that the appropriating of some particulars to Idolatrous vses, doeth wholy vitiate, and defile, not onely the Indiuidualls thus deuoted, but likewise the whole Species of them, vnto Christians: then needes must it be true of Stage-Playes, (which bring no glory at all to God, nor good to Church, or State:) that the Idolatrous, and Vnchristian ends, to which they were first inuented, and for many hundred yeeres designed, must make them altogether vnlawfull, abominable, and vnseemely vnto all Gods Children. And good reason is there, that it should bee so: For where the Fountaine is polluted, the streames are alwayes filthy: where the roote is bitter, and corrupt, the fruite, and branches are so too: where the foundation is decayed, the building must bee ruinous. If Adam be but once defiled by his fall, all his posteritie must of necessitie be borne sinners. The first inuented Stage- Playes, were the Fountaine, the Roote, the Foundation, and common Father of all the rest: now these were wholy Idolatrous, and polluted: they had the Deuill, and his Instruments for their Fathers; the Deuills, honour, worship, adoration, and recreation, for their maine, and vtmost end: therefore all subsequent Playes which issue from their materialls, or example; must needes be detestable, vnseemely, pernicious, and vnlawfull vnto Christians, in despight of this euasion, or all that any Libertines, or voluptuous persons (who are but Sathans Proctors) can aleadge against it. To the second reply: That though Pagans did peruert these Stage-Playes to an Idolatrous, yet Christians may purge out their corruptions, and reduce them to a lawfull vse: Since that which was ordained impiously at the first, may weare out that impietie in tract of time, and then the vse thereof may stand without offence. I answere, that though it may bee true in some particular cases, (as perchance in case of needfull ceremonies; of Temples built, and Dedicated to Idolatrie,) that their impietie in tract of time may vanish, and then they may be Consecrated to Gods service, and reduced to a lawfull vse; as the Cathedrall Church of Pauls, afore-time the Temple of Diana, as Some record :) and most of all our English Churches, at first deuoted vnto Masse, and Popish Idolatrie, are now designed to Gods publike worship; whence the Brownists stile them, Idole Synagogues, Baals Temples abominable sties, and would haue them rased to the ground; forwhich wee all condemne them: yet it cannot hold in case of Stage- Playes. First, because they are altogether vnnecessary vanities, and superfluous pleasures , which may bee better spared, then retained. Secondly, because they haue beene, are, and alwayes will be, scandalous, offensiue, and of ill report among the Church, and Saints of God , who haue alwayes declaimed against them, yea, censured, and reiected them, from age, to age, as I shall prooue at large hereafter. Thirdly, because from their very first inuention, to this present, (which is at least 2000. yeeres, or more ), they were neuer yet in any Age, or Countrie, that I can heare, or reade of; so regulated, or reformed by Lawes, or other wise; as to be thorowly def aecated, and purged from their filthinesse, or reduced to such honest, commendable, profitable, necessary, or Christian ends, as might iustly pleade in their defence, Many are the Lawes which haue beene enacted; much the care that hath beene taken by sundry States, and Censors in all Ages, to loppe off the enormities, allay the poyson, purge out the filth, and grosse corruptions of these Stage-Playes, and so to reduce them to a laudable, and inoffensiue vse : but yet these Æ thiopians, still retaine their blacke infernall hue : these Vipers keepe their Soule-deuouring poyson still: these Aug aean stables, are as polluted yea, more defiled ) now, as euer heretofore: no Art, no Age, no Nation could euer yet abridge, much lesse reforme, their exorbitant corruptions, and enormities: their hurt doeth farre transcend their good; their abuses ouerpoyse their vse: they are so crooked, and distorted in themselves, that no Art can make them straite : there is no other meanes left to reforme them, but vtterly to abolish them: It is bootelesse , it is hopelesse therefore for any Christian to attempt, or vndertake their reformation : and so this Replication is but vaine. Fourthly, these Stage-Playes are very like to poyson: vt l aedant, nullo indigent; vt prosint multis: they are poyson of themselues, but they must haue many ingredients to make them holesome : yea, the most accurate Chymist cannot so refine them, so compound them, but that they will bee more poysonous then holesome; more pernicious then vsefull, in their best condition: their vanitie, and frothie discourse: their lasciuious complements, and wanton dalliance; their mispence of money, and that which farre transcends all treasures, of pretious, peerelesse time , (to omit all other circumstances;) will ouer-ballance all the good, that the most refined Stage-Playes can produce: It is then but folly , and madnesse, yea, sinne in Christians to retaine them; though they haue hopes for to reforme them, because their euill would still exceede their good. Fistly, it is but a meere Sophisticall, and deceitfull Apologie, to argue thus for Stage-Playes: They may be regulated , and reduced to good, and lawfull vses; therefore they are lawfull vnto Christians now: I take it for my owne part; that Christians should rather argue thus: They are onely reduceable to good, and lawfull ends, but they are not yet reduced: their abuses may bee reformed, but as yet they are not corrected: therefore Wee must take them as we finde them now, vnpurged, vncorrected; and so we must needes auoyde them, yea, condemne them. He that will pleade for Stage- Playes thus: let him first reforme them, then iustifie, and embrace them: else let him ioyne with vs in their deserued condemnation, till hee can evidently demonstrate to vs their actuall hopelesse reformation. Sixtly, if Playes may bee reformed, and reduced to their lawfull ends; what parties are there, that should vndertake their cure? Good men will not: they rather wish their ruine , then their hopelesse, vselesse welfare. Bad men will not, because they approoue them not, but for their pleasing corruptions, which feede their carnall lusts: Yea, both of them together cannot cleanse them from those inueterate corruptions, and natiue obscenities, which adhere vnto them. For my owne part, I cannot possibly conceiue, how all our popular Stage-Playes should bee so refined, as that their vse, and practise should be euery way Christian, and Legitimate; because I see no meanes, no persons to effect it: therefore I cannot but conclude them, to bee desperate, hopelesse, and incorrigible euils, vncapable of any cure, vntractible by any Christian, vnsufferable in any Christian State. Seuenthly, admit they might bee reformed, and reduced vnto honest, necessary, and Christian vses; What ends, and vses should these bee? If carnall mirth, and riotous iollitie? (the onely vse that I know for them:) all Christians know, that these are sinfull : But admit they were not: yet if all ribaldrie, wantonnesse, and scurrilitie, were exploded out of Stage-Playes; this mirth, and iollitie, would quickly wither. If honest recreation onely ? What neede of any Stage-Playes for this purpose, since there is so great varietie of farre honester, cheaper, pleasanter, shorter, and more obuious recreations, which would more refresh vs then Stage-Playes would doe, if all their filthinesse, and vanitie were expunged ? Since therefore Stage- Playes, can haue no such necessary, or vsefull ends, but that they may bee better omitted, then retained : since they alway haue beene, are, and will bee scandalous, and offensiue to the Church, and Saints of God: since their reformation is hopelesse, their cure hard, and desperate, but their extirpation easie : since their refining cannot purge out all their drosse, but that they will bee more poysonous then holesome: alwayes euill, though lesse euill , but not intirely good: since their present condition makes them odious; and there is no Censor, no person likely to reforme them: (For priuate persons cannot effect it: and suppose the King, and State might doe it: as it would take them off from more eminent, and weightie affaires, to the publique preiudice; and misbeseeme their grauities, to spend many serious, and teadious consultations vpon such toyes as these: so the reformation of them, (which would bee alwayes dubious,) would neuer counteruaile the care, the time, and cost that must be spent about it: and no sooner should their corruptions be exiled, but they would presently reuert againe, without redresse:) I may safely auerre; that they are irreducible, vnconuertible to any lawfull, good, or Christian purposes, which may benefit Church, or Commonwealth, or the bodies, soules, estates, or names of men: and so conclude; that they are vtterly vnlawfull, vnseemely, and pernicious vnto Christians; because they had their Alpha, and Omega; their beginning, and end: their birth, and vse from Hell; being not onely inuented by the Deuill himselfe: but likewise by his owne speciall command, and his greatest minions aduice, appropriated, and deuoted to his peculiar honour, and immediate worship for many hundred yeeres. Stage-Playes they had their rise from Hell: wee Christians our natiuitie, and descent from Heauen: they were at first deuoted, (yea, yet continue destinated) vnto Satan: we were at first Baptized into, yea, consecrated wholy vnto Christ: they were, they are the Deuills; we were, yet now we are not his, but Gods, but Christs alone: this must, this cannot therefore but perswade vs, to abominate them, to condemne them, both in words and deedes, as sinfull, and vnlawfull. And here before I passe to the ensuing Act, I shall propound a fourth Argument against these Stage-Playes, (which seuerall Fathers haue framed to my hands,) as a Chorus , or Corollarie to the premises. If Stage-Playes bee those Workes of Satan, those Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, which euery Christian hath seriously renounced, and solemnely vowed against in his very Baptisme; they must then of necessitie be pernicious, abominable, vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians. But Stage-Playes are those workes of Satan, those Pompes, and vanities of this wicked world, which euery Christian hath seriously renounced, and solemnely vowed against in his very Baptisme. Therefore they must of necessitie bee pernicious, abominable, vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians. For the former part of the Assumption: That Stage-Playes are the workes, and Pompes of Satan; it is infallibly euident: For first, they were inuented by him: Secondly, he did exact; and require them of, and extort them from his Worshippers. Thirdly, they were consecrated to his honour, and appropriated to his seruice, by his owne speciall command: Fourthly, they were vsually celebrated by his followers on the Feastiualls, and Birth-dayes, of; or at the solemne Dedication of some new erected Temples, to those dunghill Deuill-gods, which Pagans did adore: Fiftly, the Primitiue Church and Christians did not onely constantly condemne, but likewise, utterly reiect them, as the workes, and Pompes of the very Deuill: all which is irrefragably confirmed in the premised Acts: Sixtly, they neuer issued from God, or from his Children; but from the Factors, and Minions of the Devill, who onely did frequent, and Act them heretofore, and applaude, performe, and haunt them now: Seauenthly, God gaines no glory by them, men no good; onely the Deuill workes his endes, fulfills his pleasure, both in vs, and of vs; and propagates his kingdome by them, as I shall prooue anon. If wee will but seriously suruay the end, and fruite, or summe vp the losse, and gaine that comes by Stage-Playes, we shall finde that all are losers ; none gainers by them, but the Deuill, whose endes they doe accomplish. God the Father, he loseth his honour, his worship, his loue, his feare, his obedience, the fruite of all ordinances, and the labour of his faithfull Ministers by their meanes. Christ Iesus, hee loseth his glory, his respect; the worth, and dignitie of his person, the efficacy, and merits of his blood: the honour, and true solemnizing of his Natiuitie, his Circumcision, his Resurrection, and Ascention: which Stage-Playes trample vnder feete, as despicable, and vnholy things, and cause men for to vilifie: yea, hee loseth the desired fruite of his Gospel, his Sacraments, his Ambassadours, and of all his trauell, whereby hee doeth sollicite, and wooe vs to come in, and match our soules with him, who is happinesse, pleasure, comfort, and delight it selfe. The Holy Ghost by meanes of Playes, doeth oft times to his griefe, euen lose his blessed residence in, his heauenly influence into, his sweete regiment ouer, his flexanimous sollicitations to, those good perswasions, purposes, resolutions, and sparkes of grace, which hee hath kindled in, our hearts: The Angels they lose their ioy, in our conuersion: their office, in our protection: their happinesse in our Saluation: their fellowship, in our association: The Church shee loseth her outward beautie, and splendor, her honour, her puritie, her joy, her externall tranquillitie, and prosperitie; her members, her fruitfulnesse, and fulnesse by them. The word, and Sacraments, they lose their powerfull efficacy, their reuerend respect, their due esteeme, their spotlesse puritie, their fruitfulnesse, and their frequent resort. The Ministers, they lose their prayers, their preaching, their exhortations, and reproofes, their reuerend respect, and loue; their rewards, incouragements, and resort: together, with the ioy, and fruite of all their labours: The Saints of God, they lose their kinred, their friends, their companions, their ioyes, their hopes, their prayers, their admonitions, their good names, yea, the glory of their Christian profession, and the praise, and innocency of their holy conuersation, which are oft times vilified, traduced, and derided on the Stage: The Common-wealth is put to preiudice, by the generall corruption of mens mindes, and manners; the abundance of Idlenesse, Prodigalitie, Riot, Pride, effeminacy, Treachery, Cruelty, Whoredome, Adultery, Wickednesse, and Prophanenesse, which these Playes produce. The poore are spoiled of that almes, that succour, and reliefe which should refresh their bowels, and make glad their hearts. The miserable Spectatours, and Frequenters of these Infernall pleasures, they lose their time, their modestie, their honestie, their credit, and respect with God, and all good men: yea their ciuilitie, their chastitie, their money, and estates sometimes; and if all this be not enough, their very soules, and bodies too, without repentance: too deere a price Godwot, for such momentany shadowes, and delights of sinne, of which wee must necessitie repent, or bee ashamed, vnlesse wee will be damned. As for the professed Actors of these Enterludes, they gaine perchance a little vaine applause vpon the Stage, which they put off with their Players robes: or at the most, a little filthy gaine, or ill gotten Estate, (which they are bound in Conscience to restore, as I shall prooue anon,) and that so blasted with the curse of God vpon it; that it either turnes Wormewood, Gall, or Poyson to the owners, or meltes away like Snow before the Sunne in their very life time: or else, it prooues Rottennesse, and consumes to Ashes in their next Heires hands: But alas, their losse transcends their gaines: they lose their credit, their respect, their good names, their time, their ciuilitie, their modestie, their chastitie; and all that was commendable in them heretofore: yea, they lose their God, their Heauen, their Sauiour, their Sanctifier, and Oh that I could not say their very Soules, and Bodies for all Eternitie, vnlesse God miraculously call them to Repentance , and cause them to renounce their Vnchristian, and Infernall profession. Thus all are losers by their Stage-Playes, none gainers by them, but the Deuill, and Hell: the one gaines vassals to effect his will, and lusts here; and damned Soules, to associate him in his euerlasting torments hereafter: the other fewell to nourish those scorching, and Eternall flames, in which the Soules, and Bodies of all impenitent Stage-frequenting Christians, shall haue their portion. Since therefore, the Deuill is the onely gainer by these Stage-Playes; which Saint Hierome rightly stiles the Deuils foode: Since hee is onely honoured, and enriched by them, serued in them, delighted with them, puruaying for them: we may safely, yea, infallibly conclude on all the premises; that they are his proper workes, and poompes. For the second branch of the Assumpsion: That Stage-Playes are the Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World; these impregnable reasons will evince it. First their very inchoation, and conception, as my first Act prooues, was meerely from the Deuill, the God, and Prince of this World; from Infidels, and Idolaters, the naturall, and most genuine, if not the principall parts, and Agents of this World, which lyes in wickednesse Secondly, the common Actors, frequenters, and admirers of them, both now, and heretofore, are no other but the men of the World, who haue their portion onely in this life, being louers of pleasures, more then louers of God: Thirdly, their subject matter, their seuerall partes, and passages, as experience teacheth, doe fauour onely of worldly Pompe, and Vanitie, if not of sinne, and all prophanenesse: Fourthly, those Pompous, and stately shewes, and Scenes; that effeminate, rich, and gorgious Attire: that glittering, and glorious Apparrell; those mimicall, antique, clownish, hellish, amourous, filthy, foolish, ridiculous, obsceane, and wanton parts: those licencious complements, clippings, and embracements, withall those other ceremonies, and circumstances, which attend our Stage-Playes; what are they but the chiefest Pompes, and Vanities which this world affordes? Fiftly, is not the very ground, and end of all Theatricall Spectacles, (especially, such as are acted in priuate houses, and societies,) a vaineglorious desire of some worldly Pompe, and State? or an officious compliancy to the course, and fashion of this wicked World? Why doe men send for Stage-Players to their houses; why doe they flocke vnto their Theaters thicke, and threefold, on Feastiuall, and Solemne seasons , especially in the Christmas time? Is it not out of worldly Pompe, and State? out of a prodigall, and vaineglorious humour? a degenerous, and Vnchristian symbolization with this present World? a voluptuous, and base seruilitie to our filthie carnall lusts? or at least wise, out of an affected desire, to post, and passe away our peerelesse time, ( which flies too fast without these winges, and spurres to speed it :) to banish God, and Christ out of our Hearts; Grace out of our Soules; all thankefull remembrance of Gods fauours to vs on such times as these, out of our mindes, and thoughts? and wholly to auocate, and estrange vs from all true Christian ioy, and heauenly solace? which expresseth it selfe, in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs; in diuine Meditations, and discourses of Gods mercie towards vs: in pouring out heartie praises, prayers, and thankesgivings vnto our Gracious, and ever blessed God, with inflamed, and inlarged spirits, for all his superabundant fauours, and compassions to us : not in Hellish Playes, and carnall merriments, which Christ, and Christians doe abhorre: If this then bee the vse, the end, and fruite; these the appendices, and parts of Stage-Playes: needes must wee now subscribe: that they are, if not the greatest, and most assiduous; yet not the meanest Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, to whose vse, and ends they onely serue; as their owne professed Apologist doeth acknowledge. Now to prooue vnto you further; that Stage-Playes are the very workes, and Pompes of Satan; yea, the very selfe-same Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, which Christians haue renounced in their Baptisme: I shal vouch vnto you the expresse resolution of sundry Fathers: Stage-Playes , (saith Tertullian ,) are the Pompes of the Deuill, against which, we haue renounced in our Baptisme; because their originall, and the materialls of which they are composed, consisteth wholy of Idolatrie : whence he stiles Play-houses, the Deuills Church. Clemens Romanus , (if the worke bee his,) calls Stage-Playes; the Pompes of Idoles, and Spectacles of the Devill; wishing all Christians to shunne, and auoyd them. The Devills Pompe , (saith Cyril of Hierusalem ,) which wee renounce in our Baptisme; are those Spectacles, or Playes in Theaters, and all other vanities of this kinde: from which the holy Man of God desiring to bee freed , saith: Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanitie. Be not therefore diligent in the assemblies of Playes. Saint Augustine likewise stiles these Stage-Playes the Pompes of the Deuill, which we renounce in Baptisme. Thou art apprehended, thou art detected Oh Christian , (saith he) when thou doest one thing, and professest another: when thou art faithfull in name, faithlesse in worke , not keeping the faith of thy promise: going one while into the Church to pray; and a while after, running to the Play-house, to crie out impudently with Stage-Players. You haue professed to renounce the Deuill; in which profession, you haue said: I renounce: not onely men, but even God, and his Angels subscribing together with you. What then hast thou to doe with these Pompes of the Deuill, which thou hast renounced ? Saint Chrysostome , who of all the Fathers is most Copious, most Zealous, and diuinely Rhetoricall, against all theatricall Enterludes, endeauoring out of an holy Zeale, to withdraw all Christians from them, vnto God: doeth oft times stile these Stage-Playes : the Devills Pompes:the fables of Satan: D aemoniacall mysteries: the impure foode of the Deuill : and Play-houses: the Deuils conuenticles : And from hence hee doeth seriously, and frequently persuade all Christians to auoyde them. Yea , saith hee, (such was his implacable indignation, and holy detestation against Stage-Playes; not out of passion, or Puritanisme, but true Christian Zeale,) I will never giue ouer preaching, vntill I haue dissipated, and rent a sunder, that diuelish Theater; that so the assembly of the Church may bee made pure, and cleane; freed from its present filthinesse, and enjoy eternall Life hereafter, by the Grace, and Mercy of Iesus Christ their Lord : a memorable, and Christian resolution. That holy man of God, and professed enemie of Stage-Playes, Saluian Bishop of Marcelles , is very Elegant, and Copious in this Theame. In Stage-Playes , (writes hee) there is a certaine Apostasie from the Faith, and a deadly preuarication, both from the Symboles of it, and the heavenly Sacraments: For what is the first confession of Christians in their wholesome Baptisme: what else, but that they protest they doe renounce, the Deuill, his Pompes, his Spectacles, and his workes? Therefore Playes, and Pompes according to our profession, are the workes of the Deuill. How then, Oh Christian, doest thou follow Stage-Playes, after Baptisme, which thou confessest to be the worke of the Deuill? Thou hast once renounced the Deuill, and his Spectacles, and by this thou must needes know, that thou doest returne to the Deuill, when thou doest wittingly, and knowingly returne to Stage-Playes: for thou hast renounced both of them together, and thou hast professed both of them to bee one. If then thou reuert to one, thou hast returned vnto both; for thou sayest, I renounce the Deuill, his Pompes, his Spectacles, and his Workes. And what followes? I beleeue, sayest thou in God the Father Almighty, and in Iesus Christ his Sonne. Therefore the Deuill is first renounce, that God may be beleeued in: because he, who doeth not renounced the Devill, doeth not beleeue in God: and therefore hee who returnes to the Deuill, forsaketh God. Now the Deuill is in his Playes, and Pompes : (yea the Play-house, the Temple of all Deuills , as Tertullian obserues, is alwayes full of Deuills :) and by these meanes, when we returne to Stage- Playes, wee relinquish the Faith of Christ, and returne to the Deuill. By this meanes then, all the Sacraments of the Creed are abrogated, and all that which followes in the Creed is demolished. If then the crime of Stage-Playes seemes but small to any man, let him reflect on all this which we haue said, and hee may see, that there is no pleasure in Stage-Playes, but death : All which, if our Actors, Play-Poets, and Stage-haunters, would but a whiles consider, it would make them for euer to abominate, and renounce all Stage-Playes, as they ought to doe, because they were consecrated to the Deuill, as his chiefest Pompes. You see now by all these concurrent Testimonies of the Fathers: that Stage- Playes are those very Workes; those Pompes, and Vanities of the Deuill, which every Christian hath solemnely renounced, and seriously vowed against, in his Baptisme, in the very presence of God himselfe, and all his Angels. That they are likewise, those Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, which they haue then, and there renounced ; the former reasons, together with the expresse, and punctuall suffrages of Saint Hilary , Saint Ambrose , Saint Chrysostome , and Saint Augustine in their Comments, and Expositions on the 118, alias the 119\. Psalme verse 37\. Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanitie : (to whom I might adde, Saint Cyprian, Lactantius, Cyril of Hierusalem, Clemens Alexandrinus, Saint Bernard, Macarius Ægyptius, Saint Basil, Nazianzen, and Saluian , omitting all those Moderne writers , which are copious in this Theame,) doe abundantly testifie : and indeed, what are, what should bee the Workes, and Pompes of Satan; the Spectacles, Pleasures, Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, which we renounce in Baptisme; if Stage-Playes are exempted from that order? If then this my Assumption be yeelded to me, as of necessitie it must, (for who can, or dares controle it, against such punctuall, and pregnant euidences?) my Sequell, and Conclusion must bee granted without any more dispute. For what man, who dares to stile himselfe a Christian, can bee so Diabolically absurd, so Audaciously impious, or Desperately prophane, as to denie that to be abominable, pernicious, vndecent, and unlawfull vnto Christians, which they haue all renounced, and abominated in their Baptisme ? Doubtlesse, if there be any odious, hurtfull, vnseemely, or illegitimate thing in all the world; if there bee any euills, any vanities, or delights of sinne that Christians must refraine; then certainely those which they haue vowed, sworne, and solemnely protested against, in the very house, and presence of God himselfe , and that in the audience both of men, and Angels; those whom they haue everlastingly abiured, in that initiatory Sacrament of Baptisme , which giues them their primarie admission into the visible Church of Christ, must needes bee they ; no Man, no Christian, no Deuill can gaine-say it. Since then I haue prooued by irrefragable Testimonies; that Stage-Playes, are those very workes, and Pompes of the Deuill; those very Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked world , which every Christian, hath solemnely disclaimed, and seriously renounced in his Baptisme; Who can, who dares stand out to in iustifie them? who can, who dares denie them, to bee abominable, incompatible, and vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians ? God forbid, that any who haue beene dipped in the Sacred lauer of Regeneration; any who haue beene bathed, and purified in the Soule-cleansing, and Sinne-purging blood of the Lord Iesus Christ, any who haue pledged their Faith, and Troth to God in Baptisme; any who haue been Baptized with the name of Christians; any who haue either by themselves, or others, renounced the Deuill, withall his Pompes, and Workes : together with all the Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, from which Christ Iesus hath Redeemed them ; should prooue such desperate, incarnate Deuills ; such monsters of Impietie; such Atheisticall, Prodigious, and infernall Miscreants; such treacherous Iudasses to their Lord, and Master; such periured, and professed Rebells to their God; such blemishes , and cut-throates to their Religion ; such Apostates, and vnderminers to their Faith, and Baptisme: such vnnaturall, and deplored Enemies to their owne Saluation; or such will-full bloody Murtherers to their owne Soules; as to approoue, to iustifie, to practise, or frequent these Stage-Playes, which they haue thus abiured; or to deeme them tollerable, or lawfull vnto Christians . Alas, What haue Christians any more to doe with Idoles? What with the Deuill? What with the Pompes, and workes of Satan? What with the shewes, the pleasures, and vanities of this wicked world? yea, What with Stage-Playes, which they haue abiured ? Is there any late, or new agreement signed betweene Christ, and Belial? betweene Righteousnesse, and Vnrighteousnesse? Beleeuers, and Infidels? Is there any peace, or contract newly made betweene God, and Satan? betweene Christians, and the Deuill? betweene Heauen, and Hell? betweene the Citizens of the new Hierusalem, and this present euill World, which are euerlasting enemies, vncapable of any truce, or mixture ? Or hath God dispensed with our vow in Baptisme? or haue we lately renounced our couenant with our God, and sworne alleageance to the World, the Flesh, and the Deuill; or else beene Rebaptized in their names ? If so, then let vs flocke, and runne to Stage-Playes, and take of them our fill, I will not interrupt, or keepe backe any. But if the Deuill, the World, and God be as farre at variance now, as euer: if Righteousnesse, and Vnrighteousnesse; Christ, and Belial; Beleeuers, and Infidels; the Temple of God, and the Temple of Idoles; yea, the World, the Flesh, the Deuill, and Christians, bee yet at irreconcilable, and everlasting enmitie, as they are : If the ancient contract betweene God, and vs in Baptisme, confirmed, and ratified in the precious blood of our blessed Sauiour Iesus Christ ,) stand good: and there bee no new league, nor couenant betweene the World, the Deuill, Hell, and vs: how can, how may wee then approoue of Stage-Playes? how can wee tolerate, act, admire, or frequent them, as alas we doe? What, shall we renounce the Deuill , and all his Workes? shall wee abiure the Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World , (which serue onely to feed the sinfull lusts of the flesh;) and yet shall wee Pleade for them with our Tongues , Cherish them with our Purses, Runne to them with our Feete, Applaud them with our Hands , Magnifie them in our Iudgements, Harbour them in our Houses, yea, Lodge them in our Hearts? Alas, poore sinfull wretches, who are thus grosely Deluded, thus miserably Periured; How, how shall we answere, how excuse, or iustifie this our notorious, and will-full Periury to our great Creatour? how shall, how can we looke our God, our Iudge, our Sauiour, or any of the blessed Saints, and Angells in the face? Where can we appeare, how can wee stand in Iudgement, what shall we doe , or which way shall we turne our selues, when God himselfe shall challeng vs, when Christ Iesus shall arraigne vs, and hee together withall his holy Saints, and Angells, condemne vs, in that great, and terrible day of Iudgement , for breach of this our vow? O let vs now at last remember, that there is an Audit, a day of Iudgement comming, wherein, we must all appeare, before the great Tribunall of the Lord Iesus Christ, to answere all the breaches of this our solemne couenant : and what will then become of vs, if wee thus treacherously infringe it now, in frequenting Stage-Playes? Excuse our selues we cannot; Perish, perish we must, and that eternally without recouery; without all pittie. For is it not equall, that such who readily serue the Deuill, in practising all his workes, and resorting to his Pompes, which they haue couenanted to abiure, should participate of his wages, and euerlasting torments ? that such who follow the Pleasures, Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked world, should likewise be condemned with the world, and be partakers of its punishments ? who can Commiserate, or Pittie such a one, or deeme him worthy of Saluation, who leaues his euer-blessed God, to whom hee owes himselfe, and all his seruice ; to serue the Deuill whom hee hath defied? or willingly parts with Heauen, and Eternall glory, by departing from the Wayes of Grace, which lead men to it , to embrace the very vainest vanities, and Enterludes of this wretched world, which hee hath thus abiured? Certainely such a mans Damnation is exceeding iust, and his Saluation, (without repentance) desperate: And is not this the case of all such persons, who resort to Stage-Playes after Baptisme? O then good Christian Readers, in the name, and feare of God, and in tender compassion to your owne distressed Soules, I beseech you, I intreate you, euen with sobs, and teares proceeding from a bleeding, and lamenting spirit, anxious of nothing but your Eternall good; that you would now at last, consider seriously what you are, and what you haue done. You are all Christians in name; and it is my desire, my prayer, that you may bee such in trueth. You haue all proclaimed a solemne defiance to the Deuill, and all his Workes, and openly renounced the seuerall Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, of Which Stage-Playes are the chiefe, and most assiduous: as being the Seruants, and Saints of God, the . Heires of Heauen, the Vessels of Holinesse, the liuing Temples of the holy Ghost, the fellow Citizens of the Saints in Glory, and the Inhabitants of a better World then this : Oh answere therefore your profession with a correspondent conuersation: If you are, or would be Christians, doe not you hencefoorth liue like Pagans : but as you differ from them in your Faith, be you likewise distinguished from them by your Workes. If you haue renounced the Deuill, and all his Workes; O liue not any longer to them: If you haue abiured the Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World; O then returne not to them, as Dogges vnto their vomit : why should you serue, why should you re-embrace, how can you tollerate, or approoue the things, which you haue thus abiured ? God commands you, not to giue place to the Deuill, but to resist him stedfastly in the Faith, that so hee may flie from you : how dare you then to entertaine him in these Enterludes, which are his chiefest Pompes, and Workes; against this Precept, and your Vow? God commands you, not to loue the World, nor the things of the World : not to conforme your selues to the Course, the Fashions, Pompes, and Vanities of this present euill World, which lyes in Wickednesse but to keepe your selues unspotted from it : because the friendship of the World, is enmitie to God, and the friends of this world, which is not of God ,) are professed enemies vnto God : How can you then admit, or harbour Stage-Playes, (the greatest Pompes, and Vanities, that this World affords,) against these Precepts, and your Couenant, without the danger of Rebellion, and the highest Periury? Christ Iesus informes you; that you connot serue two contrary Masters, as the Deuill, or the World, and him : and therefore you disclaime the one in Baptisme, that so you may appropriate your selues, and seruice to the other. And can you then yoake, and serue them all together? Can you serue Christ Iesus, and the Deuill? Christ, and the World ? Christ, and Stage-Players? Or can you be so besotted by the Deuill, (as alas too many are,) as to thinke to please, to honour, court, and entertain Christ Iesus, to welcome him into the World, or celebrate his Natiuitie, with infernall Stage-Playes, the very Monuments, and Insignes, with which the Pagans did Gratifie, and Court their Deuill-gods vpon their Feastiualls, and solemne Birth-dayes :) as if Christ, and the Deuill, Christians, and Pagans were accorded? as if Stage-Playes, were the chiefest workes of the Lord Iesus Christ, (who was borne of purpose to Redeeme vs from them, and to destroy out of vs these workes of the Deuill :) the principall recreations, and delights of Christians; not the Inuentions, Pompes, and Solemnities of Satan; not the remainders of Idolatrie ; not the Soule-poysoning pleasures , shewes, and vanities of this sinfull World, which wee haue all renounced. Beloued Christians, consider I beseech you, that God himself commands you: to keepe your selues from Idoles ; and to flee from all Idolatrie, as being the most capitall, and dangerous sinne of all other : and can you then embrace these Stage-Playes, (which were originally consecrated vnto Idoles, as holy, and religious things; as parts, and ornaments of their Pompe, and Worship : and haue therefore beene condemned by the Fathers; as the Issues, Limbes, and Monuments of Idolatrie, from whence they had their birth :) without any breach of these commands, or of your vow in Baptisme; wherein you did renounce all Idoles, and Idolatrie, with all their Pompes, and Reliques? O therefore, as you are Christians; as you haue Soules to saue, or lose for euer; be you now at last entreated, to lay all these considerations close vnto your Soules; before it bee to late. The time will come ere long, (and who can tell how soone, since the Apostle hath long since forewarned vs; that the Lord is at hand: that the comming of the Lord draweth nigh; and that the Iudge standeth before the doore ; when that last, and dismall Trumpe , ( which should be alwayes sounding this into your eares: arise ye dead, and come to Iudgement ,) shall summon you before Christs glorious Tribunall, to render an account of your selues to him , how well you haue kept this vow, these Precepts, which now I presse vpon you: and then alas, what can you pleade, or answere for your selues? Can you replie, that you haue kept, or at leastwise endeauoured for to keepe, to the utmost of your power , these seuerall Iniunctions, or your vow in Baptisme? that you haue renounced the World, the Flesh, the Deuill, or Idoles, and Idolatrie, with all their seuerall Vanities, Pompes, and Workes; whiles you thus iustifie, magnifie, and harbour Stage-Playes, which not onely Fathers , but euen Pagans themselues, repute, and stile; the Worlds, and Deuills Pompes ? Alas, how haue you renounced the Deuill, World, or Idoles, whiles you retaine their shewes, or doe their workes? What diuorce haue you giuen to all, or any of these, with which, by which you liue? What enmitie haue you taken up against them, whiles you are thus obliged to them? Can you denie that (thinke you,) with your tongues, which you confesse with your hands? Or doe you destroy that in word, which you support in deed ? O my beloued, how can you euer say, that you haue liued like Christians, not like Pagans ? that you are the Saints of God, and Citizens of Heauen ; not Satans Minions, or Burgers of this present wicked world? that you haue in trueth renounced the World, the Flesh, and the Deuill, with all their Pompes, and Workes; whiles you wast your time, and your affections, on those Heathenish, and Infernall Enterludes, and delights of sinne, which are the chiefest Workes, and Pompes of Satan; the eminentest Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World; to which Infidels, and worldlings haue beene most deuoted? Can you plead Not-guiltie of Periurie, and Rebellion in all these particulars vnto God hereafter, when as you cannot plead thus, now to men, or to your owne condemning Consciences ? If you hope to prooue Not-guiltie then; Why doe your Liues, your Workes, your Consciences crie Guiltie now ? If you confesse your selues Guiltie now, how can you plead Guiltless, or escape Christs doome. and iudgement then ? Since therefore it is vndeniably euident by all the premises: that Stage-Playes are those Pomps, and Workes of the Deuill, and Idoles; those Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World, and heathen Pagans, which euery Christian hath euerlastingly renounced, and solemnely abiured in his Baptisme : Let this, yea this alone, perswade all such as are Baptized with the name of Christians, (vnlesse, they desire onely to seeme Christians, not to bee Christians, as many doe,) to abominate, and condemne all Stage- Playes; not onely in iudgement, but in practise too ; as Pernicious, Vnchristian, and vnlawfull Pompes, and Vanities, as the Church, and Saints of God haue alwayes done in former Ages . (And so much the rather; because Christians in the Primitiue Church , (how euer the times are changed now,) were especially knowne, and discouered to bee Christians, by their abstinence, and diuorce from Stage-Playes. ) Else if they approoue, applaude, and haunt these Stage-Playes still; let them know this to their endlesse terrour: that though they beare the name of Christians, or yeeld some superficiall worship vnto God; yet they doe in trueth renounce their Christianitie, annihilate their Baptisme, abiure their Religion; denie their Faith, their God, their Iesus : and bequeath themselues wholly to the Deuill : yea, they forfaite, Heauen, and their owne Saluation, and wrecke their deare immortall Soules for all eternitie. And who is there that beleeues a God, a Heauen, a Hell, so desperately prodigall of his owne Saluation, as to incurre all these, or to put himselfe to such a losse,to fauour Stage-Playes? but of this enough. Thirdly, as Stage-Playes are thus odious, vnseemely, pernicious, and vnlawfull vnto Christians in all the precedent respects: so likewise are they such in regard of their ordinary stile, and subiect matter; which no Christian can, or dares to patronize; If we suruay the stile, or subiect matter of all our popular Enterludes; we shall discouer them, to bee either Scurrilous, Amorous, and Obscene: or Barbarous, Bloody, and Tyranicall: or Heathenish, and Prophane: or Fabulous, and Fictitious: or Impious, and Blasphemous: or Satyricall, and Inuectiue: or at the best but Frothy, Vaine, and Friuolous: If then, the composure, and matter of our popular Stage-Playes, be but such as this, the Playes themselues must needes be euill , vnseemely, and vnlawfull vnto Christians. Not to insist vpon this Generall: that the subiect matter of most Comedies, and Tragedies is some vile, and odious sine: which should bee rather a griefe, and abomination, then a recreation vnto Christians : I shall for the present confine my selfe to the particulars here specified. First, I say, that the stile, and subiect matter of most popular, (especially Comicall) Stage-Playes, is Amorous, Scurrilous, and Obscene, vnbeseeming all Chast, and Christian eares: from whence I raise this fift Argument. That whose very stile, and subiect matter is Lasciuious, Scurrilous, and filthy, must needes bee vnseemely, vnlawfull, and pernicious vnto Christians. But the very stile, and subiect matter of most, if not of all our popular Stage-Playes is such. Therefore they must needes be vnseemely, vnlawfull, and pernicious vnto Christians. For the Maior, I hope no Christian, no Pagan dares to question it. For God himselfe, hath laid this peremptorie Iniunction vpon men: to keepe their tongues from euill, and their lips from speaking guile : yea, he hath giuen this in speciall charge to Christians. Let your speach bee always gracious, seasoned with salt : Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for the vse of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers: Let all euill speaking be put away from you: and as for fornication, and vncleanenesse , (the common subiects, and principall ingredients of our Comedies,) neither foolish talking, nor iesting, which are not conuenient, let them not bee once named , (much lesse then acted, or applauded) among you, as becommeth Saints : It is a great solecisme, yea, a sinne among Christians, either to relate, or doe , (much more, to Personate, Penne, or Pleasingly to behold,) any obscene, or filthie thing: Christians they are, at leastwise should be, Saints; yea, Chast, and holy Virgins, Temples, and Vessels for the Lord : cleansing themselues from all pollution, both of Flesh, and Spirit : stopping their eares from hearing blood, shutting their eyes from seeing euill: yea, not so much, as touching any vncleane thing : therefore they must abandon all Vnchast, all Scurrilous, and filthie things: their Eyes, their Eares, their Hands, their Tongues , their Hearts, must know nothing but Christ, intermeddle with nothing but pure, and holy things : Their God is holy : their Sauiour Iesus Christ is holy : their holy Ghost is holy : their Religion, their Scriptures, their Sacraments, their Companions, their Faith, their Inheritance, and Profession holy, Chast, and Vndefiled: and so must they be too, in all manner of conuersation, at all times : therefore all Amorous, all Lasciuious, filthie, and polluted things, which haue no analogie, nor proportion with them, must needes bee sinfull, hurtfull, and vnseemely, yea, odious, and displeasing to them. Obscenitie, or rotten discourse: (which the Fathers in the margent who condemne it, define to be nothing else, but a Narration of some Vitious, Amorous, Adulterous, and filthie action, to passe away the time, or to prouoke, and stirre vp laughter: of which sort, are all ribaldrie Songs, and Iests; all Theatricall, Complementall, Poeticall, or Table-discourses of the Adulteries, Incests, Loues, and vile Obsenities of gracelesse wicked men, or Heathen-gods, Who transcended others in their vices, as much as in their Deitie :) was alwayes detestable, and odious vnto Pagans: Hence Gellius informes vs, that the Romans did publikely punish, not onely Obscene, and petulant deedes, but words : Hence Romulus inacted this Law : Ne quis pr aesentibus foeminis obscaena verba facito: Let no man vse any obscene speach in the presence of any women : Hence Sophocles informes vs, that it is not seemely, nor honest, to speake such things, which are vnseemely to bee done : Hence was that ingenious checke, which Diogenes gaue to a beautifull youth, when hee heard him vttering some obscenities : doest thou not blush , (saith hee) to draw a leaden Sword out of an Iuorie scabbard ? Hence was that brand, which Seneca stamped vpon all scurrilous persons , which I would such Christians whose tongues are tipt, and hearts delighted with Ribaldrous Songs, and Iests, would seriously apply vnto their Consciences: Wheresoeuer (saith he) thou meetest with corrupt discourse, there doubt not but the heart, and manners are depraued : and no wonder: for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh, and euill words corrupt good manners, as the Scriptures teach vs Hence Aristotle magnifies the modestie of that ingenuous Pagan, who when he was about to vtter an unchast obscenitie, was tongue-tied out of modest shame : the Citizens of Marcelles though Pagans, would admit no Stage-Playes into their Citie, least their filthinesse, and obscenitie should corrupt their youth : Yea, the very Heathen Poet himselfe, would haue all scurrilitie, and ribaldrie, exiled from such places where Youthes, and Children were, for feare they should depraue their mindes, and manners. If then God himselfe, if the Fathers, yea, if all these Pagans haue vtterly condemned all filthie, Scurrilous, Vnchast, and Amorous speaches, Iests, and Poemes, as misbeseeming Chast, and Modest eyes, or Lips, or Eares: my Maior cannot but be granted: and so much the rather, because Unchast, Obscene, and Amorous wordes, are but so many vehiculaes, to carrie men on to Adulterous, and Sinfull deedes , both which, all Christians must abominate. For the Maior; that the stile, and subiect Matter of most Comicall and Theatricall Enterludes, is Amorous, and Obscene ; it is as euident, as the Morning Sunne: First, by the expresse, and punctuall testimonie of sundry Fathers.

Peruse, I say, these seuerall Fathers, and Councels; (whose words, if I should at large transcribe them, would amount vnto an ample volume:) and you shall finde them all concurre in this: that Stage-Playes are wholly composed of, or at leastwise fraught with Ribaldrie, Scurrilitie; Unchast, and Amorous streines, and passages: Obscene, and filthie Iests, which inquinate the Mindes, corrupt the Manners, and defile the Soules of men, yea pollute the very places, and common ayre, where they are but acted : Whence they all condemne, these Theatricall Enterludes, as vnseemely, pernicious, abominable, and vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians: as exceeding odious, and displeasing vnto God; stiling them, the very sinkes of all vncleanensse, the Lectures of Obscenitie, the Meditations of Adultery, the examples of dishonestie, the exhortations, and instructions of filthinesse , and the like: the Play- houses, the Temples of Venery; the Stewes of Modestie, the Schools of Ribaldry, and obscenitie: the Dennes of filthinesse: the Chaires of Pestilence, and corruption: the Seates, the Places, and Mansions of all filthinesses, and vnchastitie: and the common, and publike Shops of all wickednesses, and defilements whatsoeuer.

You shall see our Moderne Stage-Playes, euen copiously Anatomized, yea, condemned by them: as being fully fraught, and wholly composed, of Ribaldrie, Obscenitie, Lasciuiousnesse, Vnchast, and lustfull parts, and p aessages, which misbeseeme all modest eyes to see, all Christian eares to heare, or tongues to utter : Whence they stile all Playes, the grand empoysoners of Grace, Ingenuousnesse, and all manly resolution: the Lectures of obscenitie, the Seedes of vices, the Foode of wickednesse, yea the Plagues, and Poyson of mens Soules, and Manners : and Theaters, the Cratories of the Deuill, the Synagogues of Satan; the Schooles of lewdnesse; and the very sinckes of filthinesse, and all other vices: which Christians should abhorre, yea feare, and flie, as much, nay more then any Pest-house : as these their writings, will at large demonstrate. If then these seuerall Fathers, Councells, Pagan Authours, and Moderne Christian writers, (with sundry others, which I shall receit hereafter in their proper places:) conclude the very Structure, Stile, and Subject Matter of popular Stage-Playes, to bee Amorous, Scurrilous, and Obscene; and thereupon passe this iudgement on them: that they are altogether vnfit for Chast, vnlawfull for Christian, vnseemely for Gracious, or modest Eares to heare, or Lips to vtter :. I hope that none will bee so obstinately incredulous, as not to beleeue them in the one: or so desperately impious, as not to giue sentence with them, not to conforme their practise to them, in the other. But if all these seuerall Testimonies are not sufficient to conuince the most incredulous Play-haunters of the obscenities of Stage-Playes; I appeale for finall proofe of my Assumption vnto euery mans experience. Not to record those seuerall prophane, and grosse Obscenities, those Amorous streines, Lasciuious passages , and vnsauourie Iests, which are scattered in Aristophanes, Terrence, Plautus, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius Ouid , and other ancient Comedians , and wanton Poets; which euery Chast, and Gracious Christian must condemne : I shall confine my selfe vnto the Comedies, and popular Enterludes of our present Age, which farre exceede them in all these. Alas, what are the Maior part of all our Moderne Stage-Playes, but so many Lectures of Ribaldry; so many Abstracts, Compendiums, or Miscellaines of sublimated, Elegant, Wittie, or more Accurate, and choyce Obscenities? which the more refined, and accute they are, the more doe they empoyson, endanger, and depraue the Auditors : Doe not the ordinary Theames, and Subiects of our Moderne Comedies, being nothing else but the Adulteries, Fornications, Rapes, Loue-passions, Meritricious, Vnchast, and Amorous practices, of Lasciuious Wicked men, or Heathen Idole-gods ; which should not be so much as named , (much lesse then acted) among Christians ? doe not those Wanton, Whorish, lustfull Parts; those Ribaldrous Songs, and filthie Ditties: those Meretricious, and Vnchast Attires, Lookes, and Gestures: those Amorous, and lustfull Complements, Kissings, Clippings, and Embracements : those liuely, if not reall representations, or ocular demonstrations of the very acts of Whoredome, and Adulterie, which are vsually represented to vs on the Theater: together with all those Obscene, and filthie Iests; those Scurrilous, and beastly passages, those quaint, Subtile, Rhetoricall, and Flexanimous streines of contemplatiue, Elegant, and wittie Obscenities, with which our Playes are fraught, and enterlaced: the very sight, and hearing of which, should cause all modest Eyes to Blush, and Weepe; all Christian Eares, to Glow, and Tingle; all Chast, and Gracious Hearts, to Mourne, and Bleede :) doe not all these (I say) proclaime, and testifie to the world; that the Stile, and subiect Matter; yea, the very Action, Circumstances, and Appendices of our popular Stage-Playes, are Scurrilous, and Obscene? what need we then any further witnesses? Doubtlesse, the Obscenitie of our Playes is such, that if the very Stones, and Pillars, which support the Play-house; if the Seates, and Scaffoldes, which adorne it: or the very Theater, and Stage it selfe, had Tongues to speake; they would presently exclaime against it, and reprooue it. And dares any Christian then, be so audaciously absurde, as to gaine-say it? So wil-fully blinde, as not to see it? So desperately prophane, as not to loathe it? when as his owne experience must acknowledge, and his very Coscience doeth, yea cannot, but condemne it? Since then the very Stile, and subiect Matter of our Playes are such; this must, this cannot but enforce vs to reiect them, as pernicious, vnseemely, yea, vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians; yea, as grieuous, and offensiue to Gods blessed Spirit, who hath Sanctified, and Sealed vp our Mouthes, and Eares from all Scurrilitie : as all the fore-recited Fathers, and Christian Authors haue already done, vpon the selfe-same grounds. Secondly, as the Stile, and subiect Matter of Stage-Playes is Scurrilous, and Obscene, so likewise it is Bloody, and Tyrannicall; breathing out Malice, Fury, Anger, Murther, Crueltie, Tyrannie, Treacherie . Frensie, Treason, and Reuenge , (the constant Theames, and chiefe Ingredients, of all our Tragedies,) which Efferate, and enrage the Hearts, Mindes , of Actors, and Spectators; yea oft times animate, and excite them to Anger, Malice, Duels, Murthers, Reuenge, and more then Barbarous crueltie, to the great disturbance of the publike Peace . From whence I frame this sixt Argument. That whose Stile, and subiect Matter is Bloody, and Tyrannicall, breathing out Malice, Anger, Fury, Crueltie, Tyrannie, Fiercenesse, Treason, Rapine, Violence, Oppression, Murther, and Reuenge, must needes be Odious, Vnseemely, and Vnlawfull vnto Christians. But such is the Stile, and subiect Matter of most, (but especially of our Tragicall) Stage-Playes. Therefore they must needes be Odious, Vnseemely, and Vnlawfull vnto Christians. The Minor is euident: First, by Experience: Secondly, by expresse Authorities ; both which doe testifie: that the Stile, and subiect Matter of our Tragedies are Bloody, and Tyrannicall; abounding with Enuie, Malice, Furie, Clamours, Wrath, Crueltie, Treacherie, Frensie, Murthers, Treasons, Villany, Vnplacablenesse, Discordes, Mutinies, Rebellions Conspiracies, Rapes, Duells, and Reuenge, which prouoke, and whet on the Spectators to all these Barbarous, and inhumane Vices, which they should abhorre. The Major is vncontrouleable: First, because the Scriptures doe expresly enioyne vs: to put away all Malice, Anger, Wrath, Contention, Sedition, Strife, Cruelty, Violence, Rapine, and Reuenge; together with all . Truculent, Clamorous, Furious, Irefull, Tragicall, Bloody, Fierce, Malicious, and reuengefull speaches : and that for sundry reasons: First, because such words, and actions as these, are Earthly, Carnall, Diuelish; proceeding from the World, the Flesh, and the Deuill, (who are fraught with Rage, and Crueltie :) not from the wisedome of God from aboue, which is Pure, Peaceable, Gentle, easie to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruites : Secondly, because such speaches as these are the Fomenters of Contention, yea, the Chariots of Anger, Crueltie, and Reuenge :. Thirdly, because such Tragicall, Fell, and Bloody discourses as these, are altogether vnsuitable vnto Christians; who are, or should bee,. Men of a Quiet, Peaceable, Gentle, Meeke, and tender-hearted Disposition, being Kinde, and Louing one towards another, and forgiuing one another, euen as God for Christs sake, hath forgiven them . The God of Christians, is a God of Peace : the Head of Christians is a Prince of Peace : the Guide of Christians, is a Spirit of Peace, and Unitie : the Rule of Christians, is a Word, a Gospel of Peace, which bringeth, and proclaimeth Peace to all, and perswadeth Peace with all Men : the way of Christians, is a way of Peace; yea, their Uocation, Life, and End, are Peace : therefore all Irefull, Truculent, Fierce, and Tragicke Spectacles, or Poemes, which breathe out nothing but Crueltie, Blood, Vnmercifulnesse, Discorde, Vnplacablenesse, and Reuenge, must needes bee vnseemely, and vnlawfull to them; as being opposite, and Repugnant to their Peaceable, Meeke, and Courteous constitution. Secondly, such Barbarous, Bloody, Tyrannicall, Fierce, and Cruell Spectacles, and Enterludes as these, where Tyrannie, Enuy, Malice, Murther, Furie and Reuenge, are Acted, and Applauded to the Life, must needes Iurage, Imbitter, Exasperate the Spectators, and prouoke them to Crueltie , Passion, Rage, Reuenge, and Discontent, vpon very small occasion, as I shall prooue at large anon : therefore they must needes bee Euill. Vpon this very ground, Iren aeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Athenagoras, Theophylus Antiochenus Tatianus, Lactantius, Nazianzen, Epiphanius, Chrysostome, Augustine, Minucius Felix, Saluian; together with all the Christians in the Primitiue Church, as these record, did vtterly condemne; and auoyde all Sword-Playes, Trag aedies, and bloody Spectacles of crueltie; as Fightings, and Combates of Men, with Men, or Men, and Beasts together , (which the Lacedemonians , together with Plato , and Seneca , though Pagans, did likewise censure, and reiect:) because they did excite, and stiree men vp to Murther, Crueltie, and Reuenge; and make them guilty of the Wounds, and Blood of all those Combatants, and Sword-Players, which they did behold. And hence likewise was it, that the good Emperour Constantine ; together with Nerua, Arcadius, and Honorius; prohibited all Sword-Playes, Duels, and such like Cruell, and Bloody Spectacles ; as misbeseeming Christian hands to act, or eyes to see; because they were but so many Incendiaries, and Fomentors of Crueltie, Quarrells, Murthers, and Reuenge. Since therefore the Stile, and subiect Matter of our Playes, together with the consequences of them, are such as these, wee must, wee cannot but reiect them, on the fore-said reasons, as those fore-quoted Authors haue already done. Thirdly, the Stile, and subiect Matter of most popular Stage-Playes, is Heathenish, and Prophane, consisting of the Actes, the Rites, the Ceremonies, Names, and Persons; yea, the very Rapes, Adulteries, Murthers, Thefts, Deceites, Lasciuiousnesse, and other execrable Villanies of Dung-hill, Idole, Pagan-gods, and Goddesses, or wicked men which should be buried in euerlasting obliuion lest the memorie, and reuiuall of them should defile the light: From whence I raise this seauenth Argument. Those Stage-Playes, whose stile, and Subiect Matter is Heathenish, and Prophane, consisting of the Parts, the Persons, Ceremonies, Rites, and Names; yea, the Imprecations, Inuocations, Adorations, and Applauses; together with the very Loue-passions, Lusts, Adulteries, Incests, Rapes, Impostures, Cheates, Conspiracies, Treacheries, Murthers, Thefts, Debates, and other abominable villanies, and execrable practises, of Demoniacall, Incestuous, Adulterous, and Infernall Heathen-Gods, or Men whose very Names, and Practises should rot, and perish in obliuion; must needes be odious, vnseemely, yea, vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians. But such is the Stile, and Subiect Matter of most Theatricall Enterludes. Therefore they must needes bee odious, vnseemely, yea, vtterly vnlawfull vnto Christians. For the Minor; not onely our owne experience , which is a thousand Witnesses, and the truest Index ; but euen sundry Fathers, and Moderne Authors: as Clemens Alexandrinus Oratio Exhort. ad Gentes.

Augustini De Ciuitate Dei. Master Stubs in his Anatomie of Abuses : with sundry others, doe expressely testifie: that Stage-Playes are fraught with the Genealogies, Ceremonies, Images, Reliques, Imprecations , Inuocations, Names, Adulteries, Whoredomes, Incests, Rapes, Loue-prankes, Furies, Lusts, Lasciuiousnesse, Thefts, Murthers, Cheates, Persons parts, Histories, and abominable Uillanies of Heathen Idole-gods : and for this very cause, they vtterly condemne them, as sinfull, and pernicious : And so much the rather: because these Demonicall, and Infernall Deities, being delighted with these their true, or feined wickednesse; did purposely command them to bee Acted on their solemne Feastiualls; that so men might be encouraged to imitate them, and to proceede, yea perseuere without redresse, in these their Adulterous, Inhumane, and Infernall Vices, which were Countenanced, Authorized, yea Legitimated, and commended by their practicall, and Diuine examples. All Times, all Ages, yea all Ancient, and Moderne Stage-Playes, and Experience, Subscribe, and Suffragate with these our Authors to our Minor: therefore we must, we cannot but acknowledge it. For the Maior, it is cleerely euident by its owne light, and by the luster of the Scripture. For first of all; God himselfe, enioynes his People: not to make mention of the names of other Gods, not to let them be heard out of their mouthes, but to ouerthrow their Altars, breake their Pillars, burne their Groues, hew downe their grauen Images, and to destroy their very Names out of their places : Whence Dauid doeth solemnely professe: that hee will not offer the drinke Offerings of Idole-gods, nor yet take up their names within their lippes. The very names of Pagan-gods are so odious, and displeasing vnto God, so vnsuiteable vnto Christian mouthes, and eares; that God himselfe protesteth; he will cut off the namesd of Ioles out of the Land, and they shall be no more remembred: yea that he will take away the names of Baalim out of his peoples mouth, and they shall bee no more remembred by their name. Hence was it, that the Christians in the Primitiue Church , would rather die, then call Ioue a God ; as hee is oft times stiled in our Stage-Playes: (and truely they had little reason for to deeme him a God, Whose Adulteries did exceede his issues in their number :) Yea, such was their reuerence, and Pietie towards God, that they would not so much as apply any Poeticall names vnto him ; as we Christians to our shame, and his dishonour, oft times doe: Christians haue beene alwayes coy, and charie of the very naming of Heathen Idoles, vnlesse it were with detestation, and dislike. God forbid (saith Saint Hierome ) that omnipotent loue, O my Hercules, my Castor, or other such monsters rather then Gods, should euer sound out of a Christian mouth. A faithfull Christian, writes Clement of Rome; ought not to sing any Heathen verse, or Meretricious song; because hee may chance in singing to make mention of the names of Diuelish Idoles; and so insteed of the holy Ghost, the euill Spirit may seise vpon him. Saint Basil, and Nazianzen, persuade, and aduise all Christians ; to auoide all Heathen Poemes, and Writings, which treate of Heathen Gods; relating either their Genealogies, Histories, Adulteries, Loues, or Rapes; as being the Doctrine of Deuills, or so many Traps, and Snares, to endanger them. Saint Augustine, inhibites Christian women, so much as to name Minerua, or any such vnluckie persons, in their Spinning, Dying, or any other worke. Saint Gregorie the great, and Gratian, informe vs: that the Praises, Histories, or mention of loue, doe not beseeme any Godly Lay-mans mouth, much lesse a Byshops: whence they blame Desiderius a Bishop of France, for teaching the Art of Grammer, in which he must discourse, both of the Names, and Praises of Heathen Gods : vpon which ground, the fourth Councell of Carthage.

And good reason is there, that Christians should not admit of the Names, and Histories, (much lesse of the imprecations, and abominable practices,) of Heathen Gods. First, because God himselfe, with all these Fathers, doe thus inhibit them. Secondly, because the second Commandement, as Philo Iud aeus well obserues; doeth not onely prohibit the Images, and Pictures, but euen the Histories, and Fables of the Marriages, Birthes, and casualties of Heathen Gods. Thirdly, because the recitall of their Names, and Histories, by way of approbation, or delight, doeth giue a tacite, or secret allowance of them to be Gods : where as in trueth, they are but Deuills ; or wicked Men ; or rather as Saint Paul informes vs, nothing in the world. Fourthly, because the Hearing, and Reading of such Histories, and Fables as these, which are oft times sugred, and guilded ouer with the very quintessence of Art, and Rhetoricke ) doeth alienate, and coole our loue vnto the Sacred, and Soule-sauing word of God, which runnes in a lesse Elegant, and more humble Stile. Fiftly, because the recitall, acting, and personating of their Names, their Histories, and notorious Villanies, doeth reuiue their names, and memories, which should rot, and perish in obliuion: It is the will, and pleasure of God: that the Names of the wicked should rot : that the Memories, Reliques, Ceremonies, Names, and Monuments of Idole-gods, should vtterly be abolished from of the Earth, and quite exiled from the Tongues, and Pennes of Christians ; as being the originall authors, and chiefe Fomentors of Idolatrie; the propagators of all sinne, and villany ; and the very Corriualls of God himselfe, whose Soueraigne Deitie they would, yea, did vsurpe : the reuiuall therefore of their Names, and Memories, the Varnishing of them with fresh, and liuely Colours in our Stage-Playes, with affectation, and delight, must needes bee euill; because it thwartes the Lords good pleasure. Sixtly, because those Playes, and Poemes, which are fraught with the Genealogies, Names, and Histories of Heathen Gods, are a meanes to reuiue that Heathenisme, and propagate that Idolatrie, which the light, and power of the Gospel, hath long since abolished: It is the vnanimous resolution of sundrie Fathers: that these Comicall, Tragicall, and Theatricall Poemes, wherein the Genealogies, Marriages, Birthes, Ceremonies, Histories, and Lasciuious actions of Heathen Gods, were but feinedly, and sportingly desciphered, were the chiefe, and primary cause of that Paganisme, Prophanenesse, and Execrable, or Atheisticall Idolatrie, which did formerly ouerspred the World: which Poemes the Gentiles did oft times embrace, for good Diuintie. If then these Playes, and Poemes haue hatched, haue propagated Idolatrie, and Paganisme heretofore; they may likewise resuscitate, and foment it now, vnlesse Gods grace withhold vs from it; since wee are all by nature prone vnto it: as the sundrie exhortations, and caueats to auoyde it testifie : No sinne more naturall, more pleasing, and agreeable; to man then this ; no sinne so generally practised, so hardly auoyded, so easely entertained, as this one alone ; which hath alwayes captiuated, the greatest portion of the World ; and oft times conquered, and bewitched the very chosen people of the Lord himselfe, who oft reuolted to its loue, and seruice . It is dangerous, it is sinfull therefore to applaude such Playes, admit such Poemes, which may withdraw vs Christians from our God, to grosse Idolatrie, as they haue oft seduced others , as able, as resolute to withstand this insinuating, and bewitching sinne , as wee: these Authorities, these Reasons then should cause, yea, force vs to condemne them. Secondly, the Scriptures doe expressely condemne all Imprecations, all Adiurations, all Admirations by, all Inuocations of, all Heathen Gods; God himselfe commands vs: to sweare by his owne Name : not by the names of Idoles, Baal, or Malcham, or any creative whatsouer: He enioynes vs to Inuocate, Imprecate, and Admire none but himselfe alone ; not Pagan Idoles, not Saints, or Angels, who can neither beare, nor helpe vs at our needes. How then can it bee lawfull, to Inuocate, or Implore the aide, or helpe of Ioue , of Iuno, Apollo, Minerua, Neptune, Bacchus , or such like Heathen Idoles? How can we Sweare by Ioue , by Mars , by Uenus , by Hercules , by the Celestial Gods, or such like Pagan Oathes? How can we exclaime, (as oft we doe in Stage-Playes,) O Ioue! O Muses! O Cupid! O Venus! O Neptune! O ye Gods! O Uulcan, Hercules, Mars, Apollo, Minerua, Castor, Pollux, Lucena , and the like; without a great offence? Certainely, if these infernall Deities may not be named , much lesse may they bee Inuocated, Imprecated, or Sworne by among Christians: their very names are odious, and worthy highest indignation; how then can we approoue their Oathes, and Imprecations, their Praises, and Applauses, which our God condemnes ? How Execrable, and Vile these names haue beene to Christians in the Primitiue times, the former Section can informe you: and shall not then their Oathes, and Inuocations, bee much more detestable, and loathsome vnto vs? The sixt Councell of Constantinople, Canon 94\. subiects all such to the penaltie of Excommunication, who should sweare the Oathes of the Gentiles : and shall wee then approoue them in our Enterludes, as Elegant, and comely Ornaments? Certainely wee cannot doe it, without the perill of Idolatrie, or affronting God vnto his face. For first these Heathenish Oathes, and Imprecations, or Inuocations of Pagan Gods, doe giue a kinde of tacite, yea, attribute a manifest Diuinitie to these Idoles, since nothing is to bee Inuocated, or Sworne by , either in sport, or earnest, but God alone . Now to attribute a Deitie to these Pagan Gods, whose Villanie did manifest them to bee worse then men, is grosse Idolatrie. Certainely, if the reading of a Lecture of some Heathen God: If the stiling of an Idole by the name of God, without this addition; Heathen Idole, or Dung-hill God:if the receite of a blessing from a Pagans mouth, which, in trueth, is rather a cursing, then a blessing,) in the name of an Idole, without reiecting, or disapproouing it, bee flat Idolatrie, as . Tertullian, with others, hath affirmed; because it giues an approbation to these Idoles, an ascribes a couert Diuinitie to them : then much more must the Admirations, the Inuocations, the Imprecations, and Exclamations in these Idoles names, which are frequent in our Stage-Playes, be palpable, and grosse Idolatrie; which is the highest sinne, and iussells God out of his Throne . Secondly, these Oathes, and Imprecations, as they are exceeding Heathenish, and Prophane, vnbeseeming Christian mouthes, or eares; as they are Ridiculous, Vaine, and Foolish, and so within the verge, of vaine, and foolish words, which God condemnes, and will at last seuerely Iudge : so they are a direct breach of the third Commandement: thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine ; in that they attribute the Name, and Prerogatiue of it selfe : and a Manifest violation of these peremptory Iniunctions: Sweare not at all: and aboue all things my Brethren Sweare not : no, not by the Name of god, vnlesse wee are lawfully called to it : much lesse, by the names of Pagan Deuill-Idoles; which is the worst, the vainest, and prophanest Oath : therefore they must needes be odious, and abominable; yea, displeasing vnto God, and dangerous vnto vs. Thirdly, these Oathes, these Inuocations, and Imprecations, as they renew those Heathenish, and Infernall Deities, whose memories should for euer rot : so they doe likewise ingender Heathenisme, and Prophanenesse in mens liues, and speeches: they alienate mens Hearts, and Thoughts from God, heauenly things: they tip their Tongues with Vanitie, and Prophanenesse, which should flow with Grace, and Holinesse : they stampe their liues, and actions with dissolutensse, and gracelesnesse: they cause them, to liue without God, in this World; and to admire, and relish Heathen Deities, and Discourses , more then God, or his Soule-sauing Word: how may, how dare wee then approoue them? how can wee but condemne them? Yet loe the Impious, and strange Prophanenesse, yea, the Impudent, and sottish Idolatrie of our sinfull Age, which not onely tolerates, and applaudes, but likewise iustifies, and defends the naming, and inuocating of; the Swearing, and Exclaiming by these Hellish, Heathenish Deuill-Idoles, in despight of Gods Command, with these two Wittie, or rather Impudent Pretences, and Euasions. First, that these Idoles are Inuocated, Adiured, Named, Imprecated, and sworne by, in sport, and merriment onely; not seriously, or in earnest. Secondly, that they are vttered by way of Proxie, or representation onely; not as the Words, or Oathes of the Actors, but of some feined persons, whose Parts they represent: so that they are not with in the compasse of the Scriptures, and reasons fore-alleadged. To the first of these I answere: First, that the Heathen Poets did Nominate, Inuocate, Adiure, Adore, and Supplicate these Idoles, and discourse of all their Genealogies, Villanies, and Obscenities, but in a Fabulous, and sporting manner , and that in Theatricall Enterludes, and Poemes, as we now doe: yet this the fore-recited Fathers taxe in them, as grosse Idolatrie; as an abominable, and filthie crime . If then this were detestable, and Idolatrous in them who knew not God, must it not bee much more so in vs, who not onely know him, but professe him too? Certainely, if their fabulous, and iesting discourses of these Idoles, were a notorious crime, ours cannot be; lesse then an abominable, and transcendent wickednesse. Secondly, the Scriptures know no such distinction between iest, and earnest: they enioyne vs peremptorily: not to make mention of the names of Idoles ; not to Inuocate, or Adiure them ; not to Sweare by them, but vtterly to abolish both their memories, names, and reliques : which precepts being vniuersall Negatiues, admit of no euasion: If then we may not Name them, Implore them, or Sweare by them at all, much lesse may wee doe it by way of Sport, or Merriment ; since it is more tolerable, lesse hainous, to sinne in earnest vpon some pretended necessitie, though no necessitie can once authorize or force vs for to sinne ,) then thus to sinne in iest. Thirdly, if this distinction of breaking Gods Commandements in iest, or earnest, should bee warrantable; then euery man as many doe ,) would dayly violate them by way of sport, and merriment, not in earnest, and yet they should bee no sinners, because they sinne in iest: and so all God Lawes should bee euacuated, Religion vndermined, and sinne made a iest. Fourthly, this Inuocating, Naming, and Swearing by these Heathen Gods in iest, is farre more odious, and sinfull, then to doe it in good earnest, out of ignorant Superstition, or blinde Deuotion. He that sinnes thus in iest, and merriment, sinnes more wittingly, wilfully, contemptuously, and presumptuously , then hee that sinnes in earnest; he contemnes, and slights both God, and these his precepts more; hee loues, and approoues sinne more, hee feares; and hates it lesse ; hee sinnes vpon fewer, and lesse weightie prouocations, then those who sinne in earnest: therefore his sinne is farre more hainous, and abominable then theirs is, nor this his owne had beene, had hee committed it with greater seriousnesse, as the Pagans did. Fiftly, King Solomon informes vs: that it is the propertie of Fooles to make a mocke of sinne, and a pastime to doe wickedly: that hee who deceiueth his Neighbour, (much more then hee who thinkes to deceiue God, yea deceiues himselfe ,) and saith: Am I not in iest: is as a madman who casteth abroade Fire-brandes, Arrowes, and Death. If then wee make a mocke, and sport of the Names, and Oathes of Idoles, wee prooue our selues but fooles , and mad-men, and cast abroade Fire-brandes, Arrowes, and Death to our own Eternall ruine. Sixtly, these Lusorie, and Sporting Oathes, and Imprecations by, or Discourses of these Idole-gods; may now as well ingender Heathenisme, and Idolatrie, or foment a secret Atheisme in mens Hearts, as they did in former times ; Yea, they doe as really reuiue the names, the reliques, and memories of cursed Idoles, (which should putrifie, and perish in obliuions Lethe:) and as effectually propagate all prophanenesse, as if they were vttered in the most serious earnest . This iesting distinction therefore, of iest, and earnest, can neither palliate, nor salue this festered sore, nor iustifie these Pagan, and Infernall Oathes, and passages, which Christians must abominate, vnlesse they meane to Deifie the Deuill, and adore these Idoles. Lastly, the taking of Gods name in vaine, is simply euill ; yea, so euill, that God will not hold him guiltlesse, that taketh his Name in vaine . But the attributing of a Diuinitie to these Idoles; the stiling of them Gods: the Supplicating, and Adiuring of them, together with the swearing by them, as God, with approbation, and delight; and that by way of Sport, and Merriment onely, without any necessary, or vrgent cause, (which is frequent in our the Merriments, Passages, Idoles, Oathes, Imprecations, yea, the very Actors, Spectacles, and Enterludes themselues are wholly vaine ; therefore it must needes be sinfull in despite of this euasion. To the second, that they are vttered by way of Proxie, or Representation onely, not as the Words, the Oathes, and Imprecations of the Poets, or Actors, but of those feined persons, whose parts they represent: I answere: First, that it is sinfull to vtter, yea, to heare, and read such Heathenish discourses, Oathes, and Imprecations as these, with Approbation, and Applause ; because the forequoted Scriptures doe condemne them. Secondly, it is infallibly true, that euery man shall beare his owne iniquitie , and answere for his sinne: it is likewise as vnquestionably true; that these Pagan Oathes, and Passages, are sinnes ; and that they shall bee imputed as sinnes to some men , because no sinne can euer subsist without its proper subiect. If then all this bee granted: on whom shall all these Oathes, these Heathenish discourses, and Imprecations light? on the persons whose parts they helpe to fill? Why these are either feined, or long since departed: or suppose they are aliue, yet they giue no allowance to them, therefore they cannot rest on them : needes then must they rest vpon the Poets, Actors, and Spectators heads, their Soules shall answere for them all at last , and then this vaine Euasion will not helpe them. Thirdly, this absurd Delusion, hath neither colour, ground, nor warrant in the Scripture; which giues commission vnto none, to Act an others part, or person on the Stage; much lesse, to personate anothers sinne, which is it selfe, an hainous sinne, well worthy of a thousand Deathes. Suppose that God should enter into Iudgement with any Play-Poets, or Actors, for these Idolatrous Imprecations, Prophane, and Pagan Oathes, or Heathenish Stage-Plaies, as he will surely doe at last ,) what answere could they make? Can they say, that all was done in sporting mirth, or in the part, and person of some other, who gaue no such commission to them? Alas, this Plea will not auaile them then, let it not therefore gull, and cheate them now: Questionlesse, all such incarnate Deuills, who dare to Countenance, Admit, Applaude, or Act these Idoles persons, parts, Names, or Oathes in iest, shall bee Damned for them, in good earnest. As it was wittily, and truely said of Nonresidents, and Pluarlitie Ministers, who put over their Flocke to Hirelings :, that he who feedes his Flocke by Curate, shall perchance, goe to Heauen by his Uicar, but vndoubtedly to Hell by himselfe : so hee who personates these Heathen Gods, or supplicates, or Sweares by any of their Names, by representation onely, in anothers person, may chance to enter Heauen in that others person, but Hell vnduoubtedly, in his owne: These euasions therefore are but vaine, and cannot iustifie that they pleade for. Thirdly, the scriptures doe expresly prohibit, the personating of any sinne ; much more then, the acting of Adulteries, Incests, Rapes, Murthers, Thefts, Lou-prankes, or leaude, and execrable Vanities of Iupiter, Bacchus, Cupid, Uenus, and others of that Diuelish, and Infernall crew, which pester, and defile all Theaters; which Saint Chrysostome rightly stiles; the Deuills shop . If wee did but suruay the Scriptures, as seriously, as frequently, as wee behold these Hellish Enterludes, wee should there finde God himselfe commanding vs: to absteine from all appearance of Euill yea from the resemblances, and shewes of sinne ; and can we then personate, or Act these grosse, and odious sinnes to the very life, (whose representations are at leastwise, the appearances, and resemblances of sinne,) without offence? God himselfe enioynes vs, not so much, as to make an Idole, or the likenesse of any thing that is in Heauen, or Earth. And can we then lawfully take up, not onely the interdicted names and rites , but even the very persons, images habites, shapes, and representations of Devill-Idols (expresly prohibited by the second Commandement ) that so we may the more livels personate their most execrable wickednesses; when as not onely Tertullian , and Si. Basil; ; but even an whole generall Councell, haue both prohibited and condemned all representations, either of Idols or Divels, under the severest censures: because such representations, doe not onely cause men to frame the very images and portraitures of Pagan Deities, which is grosse Idolatry; but likewise transforme even men themselves, (the most lively image of the living God) into the very portraiture of those Divell-Idols, whose parts they are to act : and so turne the expresse Image of God himselfe into the very image of the Devil; a sinne beyond expression:) and yet deeme our selves guiltlesse of the breach of this most sacred Precept? It is the Apostles peremptorie command: But fornication and all uncleannesse, and filthinesse and foolish talking, let it not be once named among you as becommeth Saints : And can we then practise or approve, not onely the assiduous commemoration of the names, but likewise the artificiall, if not reall acting, not onely of the Parts, but also of the incests, rapes, adulteries whoredomes, and such like execrable abominations of the beastliest Divell- gods, or infernall Men-monsters (which were anciently exiled all such places where Chirists Gospel came, as inconsistent with it, ) and yet thinke to passe for pious Christians? It was Davids importunate prayer unto God; Turne away my eyes from beholding vanity (which the Fathers generally apply to Stage-Playes) and quicken me in thy way: And can we, dare we then once turne our eyes, and eares (which should be alwayes centred upon God and heavenly objects, that might meliorate, nourish and refresh our soules, ) unto those matchlesse obscenities of Pagan Idols that are daily acted on the Stage ( the very filthinesse of which might cause even Divels themselves to blush and tremble ) and yet flatter our selves, that we are in Davids pious condition? Certainely, every true Christian indeed (if wee may beleve the Scripture) doth feare and tremble, not onely at the act, but likewise at the very appeance and thought of sinne: yea, he stoppeth his eares from bearing blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evill . And can wee then prove our selves to be Christians, either in Gods, or our owne consciences account, when as we are so farre from trembling, that we doe even rejoyce at the sight, the hearing of these lewd Theatricall Enterludes: being so farre from shutting our eyes, or stopping up our eares against them that we doe readily open them with greedinesse and delight to these infernall, diabolicall, prodigious Stage-abominations, which would pierce an heart of steele with griefe, and dissolve even eyes of Adamant into brinish teares ? It was Davids religious protestation, I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes, I will not know a wicked person: And shall we who ought to follow Davids steps in this his pious practise, be never better recreated, more delighted, then when the laruated persons, parts and wickednesses of the very worst of men and Devils, ( that are every where abominable in the eyes of all men, but onely on the Stage, which hath no such sanctifying vertue in it, as to make ill things good, when once they are brought upon it, ) are most emphatically represented to our eyes and eares at once? It is registred of righeeous Lot; that he dwelling among the wicked Sodomites, vexed his righteous soule from day to day, in seeing and hearing their unlawfull deeds : And can any Players or Play-haunters then perswade themselves, that they are in Lots condition, when as their unrighteous soules, are so farre from being vexed at the sight and hearing of those more then Sodomiticall uncleannesses of Pagan Deities, which are acted on the Stage, that they are more aboundantly recreated and delighted with them, then with all the soule-ravishing pleasures, of Gods house, or the most delightfull consolations of his Word and Spirit, before which they oft preserre them? O the horeble incests, the exe crable adulteries, rapes and whoredomes; the vnparalleled wickednesses, the infernall practises of those lewd Pagan-Deities, and stupendious Men-monsters that are daily acted on our Theaters? What chaste, What modest Christian heart can once recount, what tongue relate, what eye behold, what eare receive, what pen discypher them (unlesse necessiated to display their filthinesse) without shame and horror, if not sinne it selfe? Are not the very Masterpceces, dregs and off-scouring of all those horrid adulteries and transcendent wickednesses, that either the prauitie of man, or the wit of hell could hitherto invent, epitomized and displayed on the Stage ? Doe not Play-Poets and common Actors ( the Divels chiefest Factors ) rake earth and hell it selfe; doe not they travell over Sea and Land; over all Histories, poemes, countries, times and ages for unparalleld villanies, that so they may pollute the Theater with all the hideous obscenities, with all the detestable matchlesse impieties, which hithereto men or Divels haue either actually perpetrated, or fabulously divulged? What shall I record the severall abominable adulteries of Venus; the infinit suparlative incests, rapes, fornications love-prankes, Sodomies, murthers, cheats, with other such execrable wickednesses of Iupiter, the very worst, though greatest of the Pagan Deities? What shall relate the several beastly flagitious practises, ceremonies, obscenities, of Iuno, Bacchus, Cupid Priapus, Mars, Serapis, Atys, Flora, the Mother of the Gods or of the rest of that infernal crew, which come so frequent on our Theaters ? Is not their filthinesse, their lewdnesse so barbarously, so stupendiously impious, that it even strikes mens hearts and tongues with horrour, forbidding them to relate it ? And can any then behold, or act these grosse abominations with delight, (the very relation of which is sufficent to pollute the eares that heare them, the common aire that receives them, yea the breath that utters them) and yet be innocent, be untainted by them? Alas, we cannot but with shame and griefe acknowledge, that our moderne Play-Poets doe not onely record and publish to posterity in their lascivious Enterludes, the execrable lewd examples of our present Age ( which parallell or surpasse all those of former times) but likewise dive into oblivions deepest Lethe, resuscitating those obsolete putred wickednesses of former ages, which Hell had long since buried in her lowest Cels, lest present and future times should be so happy as not imitate them, or finally to forget them . And can we then act, or see the action of these moderne, these ancient, these moth-eaten filthy crimes, without a crime? No verily. O therefore let Stage-Players perish, yea, for ever perish, which thus revive the cursed memory of Pagan Idols, and their infernall wickednesses , whose remembrance should for ever be forgotten lest we perish by them: O let those filthy Enterludes, those shamelesse Actors, who feare not to display those shamefull workes of darkenesse in the sight of thousands on the open Theater, with more then blushlesse impudency, which their very Pagan, yea, infernall Authors did even blush, did tremble to commit in secret, where no eye was present to behold them , but their owne, and that omniscients, who is omnipr aesent, beholding both the evill and the good ; be ever execrable to all pious Christians, whose eyes and eares are for ever consecrated to that holy God, who is purer of eyes then to behold the least,iniquiry , then to approve our filthy Stage playes; which might cause even heaven, earth, nay, hell to blush for shame, and move the very Sunne it selfe to vaile his Cristall beames for feare they should defile their light. The Scriptures, Fathers, two famous Councels, with Sundry Protestant Divines, haue utterly condemned the making, the beholding of all obscene lascivous pictures; as being a meane to enflame mens hearts with lusts, with filthy pleasures, and to draw them on to actuall uncleannesse. And shall not then those lively if not reall pictures and representations of the adulteries, rapes, incests, Love-prankes, murthers, treasons , and other such practises of Pagan Idols, which are so artificially acted on the Stage, that a man can hardly difference the representations of them from the sinnes themselves, be much more liable to condemnation on the selfe-same grounds? Doubtlesse, if the substance be evill, the Shadow of it cannot be good : if the person be odious, the picture will be such: if the thing acted be simply evill, the representation of it will resemble it. All sinnes (much more the loathsome facts of Devill-Idols) are detestably evill in themselves, therefore the personating, the imitation of them on the Stage, the characterizing of them in their freshest colours in our Theatricall Poems, must needs be sinfull, yea, abominable, unto all good Christians . The perpetrating of such sinnes is evill, therefore the personating. Quod in factoreijcitur, in dicto non est recipiendum . Since then wee cannot but abominate these odious transcendent sinnes themselves, which sunke their originall Authors, downe as low as the uery deepest depthes of hell it selfe, from whence there is no returne for ever, let us not justifie their representations, nor applaud their action. And so much the rather, because these silthy Divel-Idols , (as the Fathers testifie,) did heretofore, either really commit those beastly crimes that are acted in their persons on the Stage; or else purposely admit them to be Poetically forged of them, and then openly to be divulged to the people on the Theater in their names, that so they might give a kinde of divine approbation or publicke allowance to these their notorious wickednesses by their owne personall examples, to animate and draw on the Spectators more securely, more boldly to commit the selfesame sinnes, to the eternall ruine of their soules . Whence Athanasius informes us from his owne experience, that the proclaiming of the vices of Pagan Idols on the Stage, did much increase the sinnes of men. For when as they perceived their Idol-gods to be delighted with such filthy sinnes, they presently fell to imitate them. Insomuch that almost euery Citie was fully fraught with all the filth and dregges of wickednesse, whiles they studied to conforme themselves to the sinnes and vices of their Idols: there being not one chaste or sober man among all the worshippers of such vitious Idol-gods (as there are now few such among Players and Play-haunters; those onely being applauded by them, whose lewdnesse was most notoriously knowne unto all men . If then the personating of the wickednesses of Heathen Idols, be but a meere stratagem of Satan, to encourage, to precipitate and allure men to the selfesame sinnes: If it revives the execrable memory of those infernall crimes which should be buried in eternall oblivion: If it worke a loue, a liking, at lest-wise a slighting or lesse hating, of such hellish abominations in the hearts of men: If it be alwayes attended with the very lively appearances, or, resemblances of evill, from which Christians should absteine . If it doth more advance the Divels service, (the originall Author of Stage-playes, as himselfe , and others testifie,) then recreate the Spectators ; which none can contradict, since Satan gaines more soules, more service by them, then play-frequenters pleasure: This must, this cannot but enforce all Christians for ever to abandon Stage-playes, because they are thus pestered with the very grossest impurities of Devill-Idols, and the worst of men, which should not once be named , (much lesse then acted) among Christians. Objection . But here our Actors and Play-haunters, that they may seeme in this case to sinne honestly , or rather not to sinne at all; frame these two justifications for the personating, the beholding of these their Stage- obscenities. First, that in the personating of the vices of Idol-gods and men, they alwayes introduce their virtues; to the end that their virtues may be imitated, and their sinnes eschewed. Secondly, that these their notoriouswickednesses are thus personated, thus divulged on the Stage to this very purpose, that the beholding of their filthinesse might learne men to detest them: therefore the acting of them in this nature must needs be commendable, not unlawfull. Answer .1. To the former of these two allegations, I answer, First, that the virtues of Idol-gods, or wicked men, are seldome brought upon the Stage, but as they are vshered in by their very grossest sins: for in all our tragicall, in most of our Comicall Enterludes, sinne is the primary, adequate and most proper subiect of the Play , virtue, a Parenthesis onely in the by: Sinne is the Mistresse, Virtue but the Handmaid, which occasionally sometimes attends it. Vice hath the whole, at least the greatest share in all our Stageplaies; poore Virtue hardly findes a part in any, most parts in none. The virtues therefore that are acted in our Theaters, as they doe not ballance, so they cannot justifie nor excuse the vices. Secondly, vice oft times acts it part alone upon the Stage with great applause, whereas Virtue seldome comes upon it but accompanied with a cloud of sundry spredding vices; which as they sooner pierce the hearts, and insinuate into the affections and liues of men then virtues ; so they deprave their minds and manners more, then all the virtues of Heathen men or Idols can ever rectifie them were they onely acted, alwayes magnified on the Stage. As therefore dead Flies corrupt the oyntment of the Apothecary , or as poyson vitiates holsome food; so the contempering of some inferior Virtues with more transcendent Vices in our Stage-playes, doth either turne these Virtues into poyson , or else deprive them of their efficacie. Thirdly, the Virtues magnified on the Theater, are onely those of Devill-gods, of gracelesse Pagans, or desperate wicked men, who never had true virtue in the. No men are truly virtous, but those who are truly religious: others (as Scypio, Cato, Fabritius, Regulus, Fabius, Aristides, & the like) may haue the shadowes of virtue in the, not the substance, which growes note in vils, an Idols, a Pagans, or wicked persons, but in a reall Christians heart, wherein Christs Spirit dwels . It is the property of all true virtue, to conquer, to expell all Vice; not to cohabit with it, or submit unto it: so that there can be no true virtue seated in such persons hearts, whose vertues are inferior to, or coexistent with their vices . Nay, all the vertues of those Divell-Idols, or Heroicke Pagans which Players use to act, were contaminated, deformed and controlled by their vices , to which they were inthralled; therefore they are not true, but onely bastard virtues , which haue scarce the very huske of virtue in them. Since then their virtues, are in truth no virtues, but meere empty shadowes of virtue , or rather glittering sinnes , as the Fathers, and some others stile them; but their vices grosse and reall sinnes which plunge mens soules in endlesse misery: the acting of these feigned virtues (which are as farre from reall virtues, as Players are from those whose parts they act) can never ballance, much lesse excuse, the personating of such execrable vices, which hel it selfe can hardly parallell. Fourthly, the mutilated outside virtues of Divell-gods, or gracelesse Pagans, as they can never make their imitators, or Spectators truly vertuous ; so they are no fit patternes for a Christian, who hath Christ himselfe, the Paragon of all virtue, together with all those Saints and blessed Martyrs, who tread his footsteps, for his platforme. Christians, as they must excell all Pagans (much more then Divell-Idols) in their virtues ; so they haue farre more transcendent patternes of true virtue for to follow, then the best of Pagans are. Christ Iesus in their guide, their way, their example: his virtues, his graces must they imitate; him onely must they follow, and none else but him, or those glorious Saints of his, who walke as he hath walked . The supremest virtues of the most renowned Pagans are too inferiour precedents for the meanest Christians. The very worst of Christians who shall ever enter Heaven Gates, must transcend the virtues of the best of Pagans: for the Scripture is peremptory: That except our righteusnesse exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees (much more then the degenerate copper virtues of Heathen Infidels) we shall in no case enter into the Kingdome of Heaven . How then can we take those Heathen virtues for our examples which we must farre excell ? The Copie must surpasse the Hand; the Sampler, the Needleworke which doth but imitate it. The rule must needs bee more exactly perfect, then that which is squared or directed by it; else all will bee erronious. For Christians then, who should soare above all others , to stoope to Pagan virtues, or to allay their sublimer mettall to their courser temper , is to degenerate into Pagans; to prove worse, yea, lesse then Christians. It is all one, as for an expert Artificer to lay aside his skill, to imitate a Bungler: or for a Schoole-master to give over teaching, and to subject himselfe to the Tutorship of his rudest Scholler. Pagans and Devill-Idols (whose Parts come frequentest on the Stage,) are the very worst of creatures ; there is no such grace or virtue in them, as is either seemely, necessary, or essentiall to a Christian. And shall Christians then resort to Play-houses, to learne true virtue from such sinkes of sinne; Such Glowormes, shadowes or carcasses of virtue , as these Idols, these Pagans were, whose very virtues led them but to Hell? Doubtlesse it is but a very Heathenish, gracelesse, divellish practise; yea, a very shame and blemish to Religion thus to doe; as if Christs own example, the examples of his saints, the precepts of his Word, were not sufficient to teach Christians virtue ; but that they must resort to Divell-gods, to Infidels, to Stage-Playes for to learne it. The acting therefore of such counterfeit virtues, for the ends pretended, is no plea to justifie Stageplayes, much lesse the action of the forenamed Vices. Fiftly, if there be such Virtues taught and acted in our Playes, as is surmised, I wonder much why our eminentest Actors, our most assiduous Play- haunters, are more generally more desperately vitious then most other men, as I shall proove anon ? Certainly, if there were any virtue to bee learnt from Stageplayes, or those Pagan virtues that are acted in them, our Players, our Play-hunters would have been good proficients, not retrogrades, in the schoole of Virtue, long ere this; whereas they are now nought else but Graduates, but chiefe Artists in the schoole of Vice. Either therefore there is no good, no virtue to be learnt from Stage-playes, (as in truth there is not ) or else their Vices are farre more active, more infectious then their virtues, or else the Actors, the Spectators of our Playes are past all grace, all virtue which our Playes can teach them. since they learne it not. Sixtly, admit there be some Virtues acted in our Stage-playes, yet there are farre more Vices. Now as men by Nature are more propense to imitate mens vices then their virtues ; even so it fares with Stage-playes. All practise, all take up their vices, none their virtues: all prove the worser, none the better by them. The hurt, the sinnes, the vices which they batch and foster, are obvious unto all mens view; wee see, we reade them both in the Actors and Spectators liues , who make a daily progresse in the wayes of Vice: the good; the virtue which they teach is yet unknowne to the world; we heare, we see it not. Since then our Stage- playes are so barren in producing virtue, so strangely fruitfull in ingendring Vice; their goodnesse will not, cannot ballance, nor assoile their ill. Seventhly, suppose there are some reall virtues acted in our Enterludes; yet who can be so grosly stupid, as to thinke, to learne any grace or virtue from a Play-house? Who ever sought for gold, for pearles in dirt? for a Chrystall spring in filthy mire; for holesome water in a noysome kennell ? Who ever resorted to a Pest-house to looke for health, or drunke downe poyson to preserve his life? Who ever posted to a tippling Alehouse to seeke sobriety; or to a Stewes to learne true Chastity? Play-houses (as the fathers testifie,) are the very Nurseries, Schooles and Marts; the very shops and sinkes of all Vice and wickednesse whatsoever: they are the very Devils temples , Venus her Synagogues. Vices Oratories, Sinnes Pallaces. Hels Ware- houses, Pollutions throne, Religions slaughter-house; Uirtues Pesthouse ; and shall wee then flocke to them to learne true virtue? Can Gaull yeeld Hony, or a Flintstone Milke? can sinne beare Virtue, or Prophanesse Grace? then Playes and Play-houses, (the very grand empoysoners of all Grace, all Vertue, yea, the very Devils nets to catch mens Soules ) may make men truly virtuous. Let vs not therefore seeke for vertue in a Play-house where it growes not, as too many doe, for feare we fraught our selves with nothing but a load of Vice, which will sinke our soules for ever to the dephes of Hell. Lastly, the Church of God, not the Play-house, is the onely Schoole; the Scriptures, Sermons, devout and pious bookes; not Playes, not Play-books, are the onely Lectures, the Ministers and Saints of God, or rather God himselfe ; not common Actors, not those Divell-Idols , who rule and worke in Stage playes , the onely Tutors of true virtue. True virtue is a plant that comes from heaven , growing onely in the Churches, not the Stages garden, Philosophy and Phylososphers could not teach it ; and can Playes or Players doe it? O no: It is the prerogative royall of the King of heaven, to teach men virtue ; and that not by Stage-players, or lascivious poems, but by his Word and Spirit onely , which breathe not in our Theaters: It is then a sacriledge , yea, a madnesse, to relinquish God, his Church, his Word, his Ordinances, his Saints (the onely fountaines of true virtue) as too many doe, to seeke out virtue in Playes, in Play-houses, which are no other but the sinkes of Vice. Answer . 2 To the second objection; that Stage-playes doe not teach, but discover Vices, that so men may learne to hate them, not affect them : I answer first; that it is God onely by his Word and Spirit, who must teach vs to abhore all Vice ; not Stage-playes, the very fuell of all finne and lust. Secondly, if there were any such virtue in Stage-playes, as to alienate mens affections from the vices which they personate, they would then no doubt, not onely haue reclaimed the ancient Play-admiring Pagans and Comedians, but likewise oor moderne Play-Poets, Players, and Play-haunters from all those lewd and filthy Vices which come most frequently on the Stage. But I never yet could heare or reade of any ancient or moderne Actor, Composer, or Spectator of any Theatricall Enterludes, whom Playes recalled from the love, the practise of any Vices, that were ever acted on the Stage, wheras they have drawne milions for to imitate them. Therefore there is no such hidden virtue in them. To cause men to abandon vice: which if there were, it would have emptied our vicious Play- houses long ere this, and have made our lascivious, adulterous, amorous Playes, so odious, that none durst approch them, for feare of being polluted by them. Thirdly, Stage-playes are so farre from working an abhorring, that they produce, not only a loue and liking, but also an imitation of those pernicious vices that are acted in them , which are commonly set forth with such flexanimous rhetoricall pleasing, (or rather poysning) streines; with such patheticall, liuely and sublime expressions, with such insinuating gestures; with such variety of wit, of art and eloquence , that if ever men did hate them from their hearts before, they cannot but affect, at least approve, or lesse detest them now: they being pro[illeg.]e enough by nature for to practise them, without any allectives to edge them on. This practise therefore of acting Vices, doth onely propagate them, not restraine them. Fourthly, if Stageplayes had beene fit Lectures, Play-houses apt Schooles to instruct men to abandon Vice, the Primitive Church, together with sundry councels, Fathers, and moderne Christian Writers of all sorts, would never have so frequently condemned, so constantly avoyded Stage-playes, as the fruitfull Nurseries of all sinne and wickednesse ; Prophane and vitious persons would never flocke so fast unto them, as they use: yea, the very Devill himselfe, ( whom not onely Nature, but likewise long experience hath made exceeding politick) would never have bin so improvident as to invent, to propagate , so inconsiderate as to multiply, to perpetuate Stage- playes to his owne great preiudice, were they such disswasiues from Vice, from wickednesse, such attractiues unto Virtue, as these pleade they are, how truely let all men iudge. Fiftly, Stageplayes themselves, as the sequell will at large demonstrate, are pernicious sin-producing, Vice-fomenting pleasures, which all godly Christians have condemned: For any man then to vndertake to make men hate Vice by frequenting Stage-playes, is but to cure one vice with another , or to prevent a lesser mischiefe with a greater; yea, it is in truth nought else, but to make Vice a blame, an antidote against it selfe; and to make ill men good agains, with that selfe same thing which made them evill at the first: a paradox beyond my stupid apprehension. Sixtly, the acting of forreine obsolete. and long-since forgotten Villanies on the Stage, is so farre from working a detestation of them in the Spectators mindes (who perchance were utterly ignorant of them, till they were acquainted with them at the Play-house, and so needed no dehortation from them;) that it oft excites degenerous dunghill Spirits, who haue nothing in them for to make them eminent, to reduce them into practice , of purpose to perpetuate their spurious ill- deseruing memories to posteritie, at least-wise in some tragicke Enterlude. It is storied of Herostratus; that hee set the great and famous Temple of Diana at Ephesus on fire, for this very end; ut nomen memoria sceleris extenderes; that the very memory of this his villanous exploit might eternize his base obscure name, and adde vnto his fame. Aude aliquid brevibus Gyar is & carcere dignum Silvis esse aliquis : is the onely rode, the best, the speediest passage, that sordid desperate obscure spirits know or take to honour, wealth or fame, especially in declining , vitious, turbulent or discontented times . Wherefore since obsolete unknowns sinnes, are alwayes freest from imitation , and morec easily avoyded then sinnes divulged, though with shame, disdaine or punishment; whence wise Lawgivers, haue rather shosen, to inact no publike Lawes against vnnaturall rare-committed crimes, then to prohibit them by publike Edicts, vnder the severest punishments, for feare the publike knowledge of them, by meanes of knowen Edicts, should make them more frequent in mens practise ; it were farre more commodicus, lesse dangerous, lesse pernitious, that those vnparalleld forgotten villanics, whose memory is revived on the Stage, were for ever drowned in oblivion, then re-imprinted in mens mindes by Vice-perpetuating Stage-playes : ne exempla fiant qu ae iam esse facinor[illeg.] destiteruns ; least our depraved times should make those moth-eaten wickednesses, the patternes of their imitation, which all devouring antiquitie had expunged, out of the much enlarged Catalogue of moderne sinnes. Lastly, if Stage-playes doe onely discover Vices for to make them odious, then those lascivious Pagans who most delighted in them, should have beene meliorated and morralized by them. But the best Cbristian and Pagan Authors vnanimously agree : that Theatricall Playes and Poems were the chiefe corrupters of their mindes and manners, the most effectuall propagators of all kinde of vice, there being none so vitious and lascivious, as those Pagan Greekes and Romans, who most frequented Stage-playes . Therefore the acting of such vices doth daily propagate and diffuse them, not decrease them. Since therefore the subiect matter of Stage-playes is thus heathenish, vitious and prophane, consisting of the fabulous histories, ceremonies, vices, names, and execrable wickednesses of Pagan gods and men, which should not once be named among Christians ; we may hence also conclude them to be sinfull, and utterly unlawfull unto Christians. Fourthly; the subject matter of our stage-Playes, is for the most part, false and fabulous ; consarcinated of sundry merry, ludicrous, officious artificiall lies, to delight the eares of carnall Auditors. From whence I forme this eight Argument. That whose subject matter consists of sundry forged Fables, of artificiall, merry affected lies, must needs be odious and unlawfull unto Christians, who must abandon lies. But such is the subject matter of most Comicall, of many Tragicall Enterludes. Therefore they must needs be odious and unlawfull unto Christians. The Minor is evident, not onely from experience, and the concurrent suffrages of sundry Fathers, and Pagan Author , who stile stage-playes, fabulous, artificiall, sporting lies, from whence they take occasion to condemne them but likewise by the copious testimony of sundry ancient Play-Poets , who stile their Playes by the very name of Fables, Lies, and figments . The Maior needes no large dispute. For since every lye is diametrally contrary to the God of Truth; Since it procecdes originally from the very Devill, who is a Lyer, and the Father of lies : since it is directly opposite to the Spirit and Word of Truth , which enjoyneth every man, (especially the children of God ): to speake no lies; to put away lying : to refuse prophane and Oldwives fables, with all idle fabulous tales and babblings : to hate all such who delight in lying vanities; and to speake nought else but truth ; because whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, shall be excluded the new Ierusalem, and have his portion in that lake which burneth with fire and brimstone for ever : Since sundry of the Fathers recorded in the margent, have abundantly condemned all sorts of lies; as well officious, fabulous and sporting, as pernicious : And since divers Pagan Authors haue positiuely censured, all ludicrous lies and poems composed onely for delight ; we cannot but subscribe unto the Maior, as an undoubted truth, and so by consequence to the Conclusion too. Since therefore Stage-playes are but merry lies ; and since Saint Ambrose informes us; that all those who loue a lie, are the children of the Devills, the Father of lies; let this cause us to detest all fabulous lying Stageplayes, as the very snares and traps of Satan , for feare we prove the Divels of-spring, who hath no inheritance but Hell to leave us. Fistly, the subject matter of Stage-playes is oftimes impious, sacrilegious, blaspemous, and that in sundry respects. First, in that the sacred names of God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost ( which ought not to be mentioned but with reverence and holy feare ) are frequently recived on the Stage, (too prophane, too impious a place for such dreadfull holy names to come into) and that in a sacrilegious, blasphemous, ridiculous, impious sporting manner, to their great dishonour and pollution . Hence was that passionate exclamation of Clemens Alexandrinus against the Gentiles: O impietie: you have made the Theater heaven: you have made God himselfe an Act; that which is holy haue you also derided under the person of Divels; you have lustfully and filthily polluted Religion and the true worship of God, with the superstitions of Devils . Hence was it, that Tertullian in his booke, De spectaculis cap. 28. Chrysost. homilie 38. on Matthew: Salvian De Gubernatione Dei lib.6. the third Councell of Carthags, Canon II. with sundry others, did long since stile all Stage-players, Blasphemers : because they did not onely deride, abuse and personate their owne Idol-gods upon the Stage, for which the Christians taxed them : but likewise blasphemously prophane, satyrically traduce the very sacred names of God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost , in their publike Enterludes; whence the Fathers laid no lesse then blasphemy to their charge. A sinne to frequent in our moderne Stage-playes, where these dreadfull names (to our shame, Playes ruine be it written) are most desperately prophaned, most Atheistically blasphemed. Witnesse our owne late religious Statute, of tertio Iacobi chapter 21 . Where our Soveraigne Lord the King, together with the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and Commons in that Parliament assembled, for the preventing and auoyding of the great abuse of the holy name of God in Stage-playes and Enterludes , which then grew common, enacted this pious Law (which is seldome or never put in ecution, because few else but such who delight in blasphemy, and therfore are unlikely to prove informers against it, resort to Stage-playes;) That if at any time or times after that session of Parliament determined, any person or persons in any Stage-play, Enterlude, May-game, or Pageant should jestingly or prophanely speake or use the holy Name of GOD, or of Christ Iesus, or of the holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, which are not to be spoken but with feare and reverence; that for every such offence by him or them committed, he or they should forfeit ten pounds. The one moitie thereof to the Kings Majestie, his Heires and Successors: the other moitie thereof to him that will sue for the same in any Court of Record in Westminster, wherin no Essoigne or wager of Law shall be allowed . A sufficient evidence to testifie the execrable blasphemy of our domesticke Enterludes; since, ex malis moribus optim ae oriuntur leges: & emendari quam piscare posterius eft. Secondly, as these Sacred names, even so the Histories, Texts, and sacred passages of holy Scripture (which should not so much as come within the polluted lips of gracelesse Actors , especially in sports, in places of prophannesse ) are oft-times most Atheistically, irreligiously, blasphemously acted, vttered, profaned, derided, mis-applied, jested at, and sported with in Stage-playes. This Authors , this experience largely testifie, to the griefe of all good Christians, and if this bee not sufficient, we haue the expresse Authority of an Act of Parliament, even of 34 and 35 of Henry the 8. chapter 1. which irrefragably confirmes this truth. Now for Christians thus to abuse the Word of God, and Scripture Histories on the Stage, what is it but the very height of all impietie, which well deserves Gods heaviest judgements; It is storied, of Theopompus an historian, and of Theodectos a Tragedian; That God strucke the one of them with madnesse, the other with blindnesse for a season: the one, for inserting a part of Moses sacred writing into his prophane story; the other of them for intermixing some passages and histories of the old Testament with his lascivious Play-Poems; neither were they restored to their sight, or senses, till they had particularly repented of this their wickednesse . If then these Pagans, for these their Scripture prophanations did undergoe so sharpe, so exemplary a judgement; what a severe punishment may these Christian Play-Poets, Actors and Spectators looke for, who will fully prophane those sacred Scriptures on the Stage, by which they must be sanctified and directed now, and iudged at the last ? What a stupendious impietie, a desperate blasphemy and prophannesse is it, for men, for Christians, to turne the most serious Oracles of Gods sacred word into a Play , a Iest, a Fable, a Sport, a May-game? to temper the purest Scriptures with the most obscene lascivious Play-poems, that filthinesse or prophannesse can invent? to pollute those sacred histories on the Theater the very house and Synagogue of the Devill , which the sanctifying Spirit of God hath forever consecrated and bequeathed to the Church of God ? to make the Sin-slaying, the Lust-mortifying , Souleconverting Word of God , the onely evidence of our salvation ; a meere Pander to mens beastly lusts, their ribaldrous mirth, their gracelesse wits, and carnall jollity; yea, a meere instrument to the very Devill himselfe , , who rules in Stage playes ; and so an obsignation of their just domnation . Doubtlesse, as the damnablenesse of this most execrable impietie, (which is next of kinne to that unpardonable sinne of Blasphemy against the holy Gbost, the Author of the Scriptures ) transcends my narrow expressions; to the eternall tormens alotted to it, doe surpasse mens largest thoughts. And yet it now acts it's Part to frequently, so plausibly on the Stage, that many cease, not onely to apprehend no sinfulnesse, no danger in it, but also deeme it worthy of their best applause. Alas, with what face or confidence; with what joy or hope can such heare or reade the Scriptures in the Church, who thus actually prophanestem , or heare them thus prophaned in the Play-house? With what assurance can they call upon the Name of God, of Christ for mercy at the last, who delightfully resort unto those Theaters, where they are frequently blasphemed and prophaned now? Can any thus abuse, pollute Gods holy Name, or Word; and yet hope for consolation, for absolution, for salvation from them at the last? can any thus blaspheme the Name of God, of Christ, or patiently indure the audience of such blaspemies as are belched out against them on the Stage; and yet dare to invocate them in their greatest exigencies? Certainly, God will not, Christ will not thus be mocked . Let not such blasphemers then as these expect any thing from Gods hands, but wrath, & vengeance, the onely portion of their Cup , unlesse they speedily repent of these their damnable, prophane, blasphemous Stage-playes, which thus abuse the sacred Scriptures, in a transcendent manner. Thirdly, as the historicall passages of the Old Testament, so the historie of Christs death, and the celebration of his blessed Sacraments, are oft times prophaned in theatricall enterludes, especially by Popish Priests and Iesuites in forraigne parts: Who, as they have turned the Sacrament of Christs body and blood into a Masse-play; so they have likewise trans-formed their Masse it-selfe, together with the whole story of Christs birth, his life, his Passion, and all other parts of their Ecclesiasticall service into Stage- playes . This, not onely Protestant Writers , but even their owne Records (where the Index Epurgatorius hath not clipt their tongues) doe largely testifie, to their shame. Æ neas Silvius , surnamed Pope Pius the second; as the Records of himselfe, that he was much given to Wine, to Venery, Belly- cheere and other beastly lusts,. and that he begot a Bastard sonne on the body of an English woman, whose chastity he oft solicited before hee could prevaile; in which fact, which sonne of his, he much rejoyced , as his owne Epistle witnesses: such was his Pius Papall chastitie. So he is not ashamed to publish to the world; that in his younger yeeres he penned the wanton Comadie of Crisid, with other amorous Poems : and in his elder dayes in honour of Corpus Christi Feast, he caused a Shew or Stage-play to be acted , wherein was represented the Court of the King of Heaven, and God the Father sitting in Majestie; together with God the Sonne , (O blasphemie, O prophannesse beyond all expression) offering up the blessed Uirgin his Mother, taken out of her sepulchre, unto his aeternall Father . What wickednesse, what blasphemie like to this, as thus to Deifie a Player, and to bring the very Throne, the Majesty of God himselfe, yea, the persons of the eternall Father, Sonne, and God of glory on the Stage. But peace, it was an vn-erring Pope that did it , and so perchance it was no sinne at all in him. Honorius Augustodunensis , an Author of some credit among the Romanists, in his Booke, De Antiquo Ritu Missarum. lib. 1. cap. 83 . the title of which chapter is, De Trag aedijs : to signifie to the world, that the Popish Masse is now no other but a Tragicke Play , writes thus, Wee must know that those who rehearsed Tragedies on Theaters, did represent unto the people by their gestures, the acts of fighters. So our Tragedian (thus hath he stiled the Masse-Priest , how aptly the ensuing words enforme us) represents unto the Christian people by his gestures, the combate of Christ in the Theater of the Church, and inculcates into them the victory of his Redemption. Therefore when the Presbyter saith, (Pray yee) he acteth or expresseth Christ, who was cast into an agony for us, when he admonished his Apostles to pray. By his secret silence, he signifieth Christ led to the slaughter as a Lambe without a voyce. By the stretching out of his hands, he donotes the extension of Christ upon the Crosse. By the Song of the Preface, he expresseth the cry of Christ, hanging vpon the Crosse, &c . Loe here a Roman Masse-priest becomes a Player , and in stead of preaching, of reading, acts Christs passion in the Masse; which this Author stiles, a Tragedy-Lodovicus Vives complaines , that it was the custome of the Priests and Papists in his age, when as the solemnity of Christs death was celebrated, to exhibite Playes unto the people, not much different from these ancient Pagan Enterludes; of which practise (saith he) though I say no more, whosoever shall heare, he will repute it discommendable enough, even in this regard, that Playes should be made in a thing most serious, There Iudas is derided, uttering the most foolish things he can devise, whiles he betrayeth Christ. There the Disciples flie, the souldiers pursuing them, and that not without the dirision and laughter, both of the Actors and Spectators. There Peter cuts off the eare of Malchus, the ignorant multitude applauding him, as if by this meanes the captivity of Christ were sufficiently revenged. And a little after, he who had fought so valiantly, being affrighted with the questions of one little Girle, denies his Master, the multitude deriding in the meane time the Maide that questions him, and hissing at Peter who denies him. Among so many Players, among so many shoutes and ridiculous fooleries Christ onely is serious and grave: and when as hee endeavours to eliciate sorrowfull affections; I know not by what meanes, not there onely, but likewise at the Sacraments and holy Ordinances he waxeth cold, with the great wickednesse and impiety, not so much of those who behold or act these things, as of the Priests, who appoint these things to be done . Loe here their owne Author declaiming against Popish Priests for their frequent acting of Christs Passion, in the very selfe-same manner, as the Pagans of Old did vse to act the lives and practises of their Devill-gods. A sufficient testimony, how little Papists really estimate the bitter Passion of our blessed Saviour, since they make a common Play or pastime of it. This passage of Vives hath so offended the histrionicall Masse-Priests, that Gaspar Quiroga in his Index Expurgatorius, commands it to be expunged out of all new Impressions of Saint Augustines , and the Divines of Lovan , in their Impression of Saint Augustines Workes, Antwerpe 1575\. and in other of their Editions since that time, have razed it out accordingly , that so they might still proceed to Act Christs Passion without contoll. To passe by Ioannes Langhecrucius , a Popish Author, who makes mention of this playing of Christs sufferings, and seemes for to approve it. As also to pretermit the Statute of primo Edw. 6. chap. 1 . which informes us, That divers Papists had then of late marveilously abused, contemptuously depraved, despised and reviled, the most holy Sacrament of Christs body and blood, in sundry rimes, songs, Playes, and Iests; calling it by such vile and unseemely words as Christian eares doe much abhorre to heare rehearsed : an uparalleld blasphemy and prophannesse: The provinciall Popish Councell of Colon under Adolphus , in the yeere 1549\. cap. 17. and 22 . not onely impliedly allowes the acting of sacred histories, but likewise expresly Records: That when as the Church carryed about the consecrated hoste of Christs body and blood in long processions (the reason of which processions are there at large expressed) the secular vanity of worldly men did creepe into those processions; in so much, that they joyned with them prophane and scurrilous Playes with a great noyse; and as if they were going to Warre. Drummes and Fiffes were strucke up, and idle spectacles which suite not with these thigs were exhibited: with which the people being delighted, they were wholly avocated from the things done in procession, whence this Councell commands all Clergy men to absent themselves from such processions which were turned into Playes. Yea, the Popish synodus Carnotensis, an. 1526. & Synodus Turvinra. 1583. informes vs, That Catholicke Priests, in the dayes of the first Masses of their new Presbyters, after their merry Feasts, their great and unhallowed banquets, did goe forth in publike to exhibite most grosse unchaste Comaedies to the people, and that in the Feast of Saint Nicholas, Innocents, and on other Festivals, they did put on Visars, and act some ridiculous or foolish thing, (and sometimes the Passion of our Saviour, or those of their Saints & Martyrs either in their Churches or some other place , It is true, that some few Italian Bishops, being ashamed of this diabolicall practise, of the Paganizing Church of Rome , in acting Christs Passion, did in a Councell at Millaine, under their Archbishop Borrhom aeus, in the yeare of our Lord, 1556. decree for their Province that the Passion of our Saviour should not be hereafter acted in any sacred or prophane place whatsoever, because of the scandall which it did occasion : But yet to quit the credit of their Church which might justly be taxed for approving this ungodly practise, they put this faire glosse upon this so execrable villany; that the acting of Christs Passion, however it came to be abused, was a custome religiously practised and brought in at first : A most irreligious evasion of ambitious spirits, who would rather audaciously justifie their greatest errours to their greater infamy; then ingenioustly acknowledge them to their praise. But hath his provinciall Councell or Synodus Carnotensis , 1526. and Synodus Turonica , 1583. which are much to the like effect, abolished this abuse out of the Antichristian Church of Rome ? No verily. for the Iesuites themselves are not ashamed to publish to the world, that in stead of preaching the word of God, the fall of Adam and Eve, with their exile out of Paradise, and the history of our Saviour, they acted and played them among their Indian Proselites . A true Iesuiticall practise, beseeming well this histrionicall internall Society, who have turned the very truth of God into a lie. and the whole service of God into an Enterlude . And no wonder is it that Papists and Iesuites thus turne Christs passion into a meere ridiculous Stage-play, (a practise yet in use among them, especially on Good-friday :) since Pope. Leo the tenth (such was his unerring pious blasphemy) reputed the whole history of our Saviour, a meere cheating gainefull Fable ; as we may justly feare these acting Priests and Iesuites doe, or else they durst not thus to play it, to abuse it as we see they doe. And as they thus act the sacred Passion of our blessed Saviour, even so (if Fitz-stephen Polyder Virgil, Bochellus, or Francis de Croy , may be credited) they act the lives, the miracles, the martyrdomes torments and legions of their Saints upon their solemne Festivals, and that within their Churhes in their Mother tongue; not out of any devotion, but for mirth and recreation sake, after the manner of the ancient Pagans. Saint Augustine, writing of the honour (not of the adoration, a thing not then in vse) which the Christians gave the Martyrs in his age; informes us; that they did neither exbilerate them with their crimes; nor yet with filthy Playes, with which the Gentiles did vsually delight their Idol-gods . Yet our novellizing Romanists, ( who vaunt so much of antiquity, though their whole Religion , (wherein they varry from us) be but novelty ) abandoning the pious practice of these Primitive Christians, (conscious to themselves no doubt, that many of their late Canonized Tiburne-Martyrs , were no other, no better then the devil-gods of Pagans, who were oft-times deified for their notorious villanies , as Popish Saints are for their matchlesse treasons;) have not onely adored them as gods , erecting temples to their names and worship: but likewise solemnized their anniversary commemorations, by personating in there severall Temples, the blasphemous lying Legends of their lives and miracles, (so fit for no place as the Stage it selfe) in some theatricall shewes; adoring and honouring them in no other manner, then the very Pagans did their Devil-gods, with who these hell-saints are most aptly paralleld . Such honour, such worship give the papists to our blessed Saviour, to these their idolized Saints, as thus to turne , not onely Their Priest into Players, their Temples, into Theaters ; but even their very miracles, lives, and sufferings into Playes. To leave the Papists and close up this Scene. It is recorded of one Porphory a Pagan Stage- Player, that he grew to such an height of impiety, as he adventured to baptize himselfe in jest upon the Stage, of purpose to make the people laugh at Christian Baptisme, and so to bring both it and Christianity into contempt; and for this purpose he plunged himselfe into a vessell of water which he had placed on the Stage, calling aloud upon the Trinity: at which the Spectators fell into a great laughter. But loe the goodnesse of God to this prophane miscreant; it pleased God to shew such a demonstration of his power and grace upon him, that this sporting baptisme of his, because a serious lauer of regeneration to him: in so much that of a gracelesse Player, he became a gracious Christian, and not long after, a constant Martyr . The like I find registred of one Ardalion, another Heathen Actor, who in derision of the holy Sacrament of Baptisme, baptized him-selfe in jest vpon the Stage, and by that meanes became a Christian; Gods mercy turning this his wickednesse to his eternall good: not any wayes to justifie Playes or Players, or to countenance this his audacious prophannesse; but even miraculously to publish to the world the power of his owne holy Ordinaces , wch by the co-operation of his Spirit, are even then able to regenerate those who most contemne them , when they are used but in scorne. These notable histories, with the premises, sufficiently evidence, the subject matter of Stage-playes to be oft-times impious, sacrilegious, blasphemous: from whence I raise this ninth Argument. That whose subject matter is impious, sacrilegious, blasphemous, must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. Witnesse Levit. 24. 11. to 17. 2 Kings 19. 6. 22. Isay 37. 6. 23. c. 525. Matth. 12. 31. Luke 22. 65. 1. Tim. 1. 20, But such oft-times, is subject matter of Stage-playes: witnesse the premises. Therfore they must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. Sixtly; Stage-playes are for the most part satyrically invective against the persons, callings, offices and professions of men; but more especially against Religion and Religious Christians, the chiefest objects of the Divels malice. From whence I deduce this tenth Play-oppugning Argument. That whose stile, whose subject matter is ordinarily satyricall and invective, being fraught with bitter scoffes or jests against Religion, Virtue, and Religious Christians; against the persons, callings, offices, or honest professions of men; must needs be odious and unlawfull unto Christians. But such is the ordinary stile and subject matter of most popular Stage- playes. Therefore they must needs be odious and unlawfull unto Christians. The major needeth little proofe, since God himselfe injoynes all Christians, to put away all bitternesse, anger. wrath, clamour, and evill speaking, with all maliciousnesse: to be courteous and tender-hearted one towards another ; not rendring railing for railing ; but forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any one hath any quarrell aginst another , (much lesse then when as there are no personall variances betweene men) even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven them , The Scripture requires, that Christians should be patient, peaceable, gentle, easie to be entreated, full of mercy, and good fruits without grudging or calumny, without hypocrysie or backbiting , without rayling or slanders , especially against godly men , whose lives, whose persons, whose graces should no where be traduced, much lesse upon the Stage. Mens persons are the worke and image of God himselfe ; their honest callings, offices and imployments, the very Ordinances of God; their graces, their holinesse (to omit their credit and good names , which are better then precious oyntment, yea, more desirable by farre than great riches) the very beames that flow from the Sunne of Righteousnesse: Wherefore, to personate, deride, revile, or scoffe at all, or any of these, upon the Theater, must needs be sinfull ; because it not onely brings them into contempt and scorne, but also offers open indignitie to God himselfe, from whom they issue . The Minor is abundantly evident. First, by the expresse testimony of prophane Authors: it is storied of Aristophanes , that scurrilous carping Com aedian, that he personally traduced and abused virtuous Socrates on the Stage, by the instigation of some lewde Athenians, who maligned him for his resplendent virtues; accusing him both for a trifler, an Atheist, who did neither know nor reverence the gods; of purpose to bring him into derision with the people. Eupolis the Com aedian, did the like to that famous Graecian Worthy, Alcebiades, for which he commanded him to be drowned in the Sea. Aristotle writes of Com aedians, that they are wholly occupied in surveying, in deriding the vices of other men, which they proclaime upon the Stage, whence he rankes them in the number of traducers, and evill- speakers. I socreates blames the Athenians much, for preferring Comedians who did nothing but carpe at them, and blaze abroad their views to their infamy, before such who best deserved at their hands. Diogenianus in Plutarch, reputes it an unbefitting thing, to entertaine Players, or their Comedies at any solemne Feasts; because their virulent invectives, scoffes, and jests, would occasion sudry quarrels and debates . The Laced aemonians banished all Stage-playes, Players, and Play-poets, out of their Territories; because they could not endure to heare their lawes carped at, or spoken against in jest or earnest. Tiberi[illeg.] exiled all Stage-players out of Italy, by reason of those many commotions which their insolent personall invective Playes occasioned . To passe by that famous Gr aecian Pericles, who was oft times perso[illeg.]ted and traduced on the Theater Dionysius Hallicarnasseus describing the ancient Enterludes of the Romans, records: that Cavillatorie and satyricall Playes were of old received among the Romans: in which Playes it was lawfull for the Actors to cast Iambickes, scoffes and floutes upon the most illustrious persons, yea, upon the Emperors themselves; as it was lawfull heretofore among the Athenians, for those who accompanied their Triumphes and Shewes in Wagons, to scoffe at any they met withall, which liberty of scoffing , (as Ovid testifies) was likewise vsed in the Floralian Stage-Playes . So that invective Playes were common, both with the Romans and Athenians. Athen aeus Records: That Com aedians abound in personall scoffes, reproaches, taunts; which are frequent in the Comaedies of Aristophanes: Yea, Horace the Poet, is very copious in describing the personall invectives of Playes in former times , especially the Fescennia, and the ancient Comedy, which spared neither friends nor foes; whose personall invectives grew so excessive, so odious and intollerable, that the Romans inacted a Law against them, to suppresse their vile abuses in this kinde . This concurrent testimony then of Pagan Authors, is a sufficient justification of my Minors truth. Secondly, as these heathen Writers, even so the Fathers, with sundry ancient and moderne Authors doe positively affirme the truth of this assumption.

Eliz. chapter 2. which precisely prohibit the satyricall depraving, traducing, or derogation of the Common Prayer-Book, and of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in any Enterludes, Playes or Rimes , (in which kinde Playes had beene formerly peccant) under severe penalties .) All these, I say, with sundry others which I pretermit, expresly taxe, yea, utterly condemne all Playes, in regard of these their personall invectives against particular persons, functions, offices, callings, and the like, concurring fully in my Minors truth. But to passe by Authorities, our owne particular experience, is a thousand witnesses to this Assumption. Survay we all our moderne Stageplayes with an impartiall eye, There is hardly one of them among an hundred, where in Religion or religious men, or some particular persons, officers, callings, professions, are not notoriously, satyrically derided, personated, traduced, defamed, by such who neither consider nor bewaile their owne iniquities, whiles they curiously survay, and maliciously divulge the faults of others. Not to particularize those late new scandalous invective Playes, wherein sundry persons of place and eminence have beene particularly personated, jeared, abused in a grosse and scurrilous manner; the frequent scoffes, reproaches, scandals, Satyrs, and disgraccfull passages that are darted out in Stageplayes, against Ministers, Lawyers, Courteours, Phisitions, Marchants, Citizens, Tradesmen of all sorts; against Iudges, iustices, Maiors , and such like Officers; but especially against all zealous practicall professors of Religion, who seldome scape the Players lash : (by meanes of which, both Governours, Government, Religion, and Devotion are brought into contempt.) doe abundantly confirme the Satyricall invectivenesse of Stageplayes. Which vitious quality is sufficient to make them odious unto Christians. Objection. If any here object in defence of Stage-playes that they inveigh not against particular persons, officers, or professions; but onely against their vices; which is not onely lawfull, but usefull, but commendable. Answer . To this I answer. First, that the Objection it selfe is meerely false; since not onely . Cyprian , and the forequoted Authors, but even Players and Play-haunters themselves can testifie, that all sorts of persons, of professors are abused often on the Stage : their virtues, their graces being there more frequently censured, derided, traduced, then their vices. Secondly, admit the Objection true; yet for Players to censure, to proclaime mens vices or abuses on the Theater, must needs be sinfull . First, because they have no authenticke commission, either from God or man to doe it. For though every private man may secretly admonish or reprove another for his sinnes, as opportunity shall require: yet none must publikely censure sinnes or sinners, but Magistrates, Ministers, and such like publike persons, who are deputed by God himselfe to this very office ; vpon which no common Players must encroach. Secondly, because Players are of all others, the unmeetest persons to reprove mens vices. He, who will effectually rebuke the sinnes, the enormities of other men, must be free from open crimes himselfe ; else his reproofes will want authority, and rather exasperate or encourage the reproved in their sinfull courses, then reclaime them from them. Now Players are commonly the most criminous and enormious persons of all others , being for the most part deepely guilty of all those vices, those abuses which they condemne in any : Therefore their reproofes are vaine and fruitlesse. Thirdly, because Players are alwayes peccant in the manner of their reproofes. He, who reprehends anothers faults in a lawfull Christian way, must be sure to observe these circumstances. First, he must doe it with the spirit of meekenesse, of compassion, without wrath or passion . Secondly, he must doe it with discretion, in a decent, and prudent manner ; having a due respect both to the person, time, and place, to the vice or fault reproved. Thirdly, he must doe it out of conscience, loue, and friendship: With an unfained desire to reforme the persons, the vices reprehended ; not to vent his owne private spleene, or to disgrace the party rebuked. Fourthly, he must openly reprove the delinquents to their faces, that so they may take notice of their vices to reforme them: not covertly behinde their backes, for this is meere detraction, not reproofe : A publication of mens vices vnto others to their great disgrace; not a discovery of them to themselves for their amendment. Now our Vice-censuring, Sinne-proclaiming Actors, ( who commonly discover, but not correct their owne enormities, whiles they display and censure others , which makes them truely miserable ) transgresse in all these circumstances. Their reproofes are alwayes satyricall, edged with private malice, or pointed with revenge; they are never serious, seasonable, private, discreet: their ayme is onely mens defamation, not their reformation : since they proclaime mens vices unto others, not lay them open to themselves: they dare not looke the delinquents in the face, but are alwayes clamouring behind their backs: their rebukes proceed not from true Christian love, which delights to cover,not propalate and divulge mens sinnes: therefore they must needs be evill. Fourthly, (as a reverend worthy of our Church observes) there is nothing more dangerous in a State, then for the Stage and Poet to deride sinne, which by the Bishops and Pastors of the Church is gravely and severely to be reprooved; because it causeth Magistrates, Ministers, and Statesmen to lose their reputation , and sinne to be lesse feared. Lastly, admit that Players had sufficient authority to censure the vices, the abuses of particular persons, officers, and professions (which I cannot beleeve they have, till they can shew me an act of State, or a Commission for it in the Scripture,) yet this is infallible, that they ought not to receive or raise an ill report of any: to deride or scoffe at any mans vices, and so to make a mocke of sinne , or to speake evill of any one , as they doe: since God himselfe prohibites it, since Michael the Archangel , (whose example all must imitate) disputing with the Divell about the body of Moses, durst not bring any railing accusation against him, but said; The Lord rebuke thee : yet our desperate wicked Players (who in this are worthy the sever est penalty, that being so superlatively vitious theselves, they dare presume to censure others ) to testifie to the world, that they are within the nuber of these scoffers, and dispisers of those who are good , which are prophecied of in the latter times; dare open their blacke infernall mouthes , in bitter invective Enterludes, against all grace and goodnesse; against the very profession and professors of Religion; against all qualities, callings and degrees of men, scarce glancing lightly at their vices. Therefore their Playes must needes be inexcusably sinfull, even in this respect. Lastly, admit the stile or subject matter of Stage-playes be no wayes such, as I have hitherto demonstrated it to be; yet at the very best it is but idle, frothy, superfluous, unprofitable; as vaine, as empty, as vanity it selfe . From whence I raise this eleventh dispute. That whose stile and subject matter, in its very best acception, is but vaine, but frivolous, and ridiculous, bringing no glory at all to God, nor good to men; must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. But such is the stile and Subject of most Stage-playes, as Saint Cyprian excellently writes. Therefore they must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. The Major is uncontroulable; since God himselfe inhibits Christians to utter vaine knowledge; to reason with unprofitable talke, or with speeches which will doe no good, to walke in vanity, or things that will not profit; and to follow after vaine things which will not profit, because they are but vaine. Christians must not lay out their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which satisfieth not, they must not delight in vanitie, or in things that increase, vanity, and make not man the better ; but they must pray with David ; Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanity: since the Scripture is expresse; that the speaking, loving, or lifting up of the soule to vanity, folly, and unprofitable things, is an undoubted character of such wicked men, who shall not ascend into Gods holy hill ; not any property of Gods children: Who as they must abandon all idle, fabulous, unprofitable discourses ; Because that for every idle word that men shall speake they shall give account at the day of judgement : so they must likewise direct even all their actions, speeches, recreations to Gods glory ; the edification of others, and their owne spirituall good ; to which Stage-playes, no wayes tend. Therefore the Major is vnquestionable. For the Minor: That the stile and subject matter of Stage-playes is in its very best acception, but vaine, but frivolous and ridiculous, bringing no glory at all to God, nor good to men: is most apparant. First, by the concurring testimony of sundry Fathers, and other learned Writers, Hence Hilarie, Ambrose, Chrysostome, Augustine, Bruno and others, in their Commentaries and expositions on the 118\. alias the 119\. Psalme verse 37\. Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanity : together with Iohn Salisbury, lib . I. De Nugis Curialium, cap . 8. Master Gosson, Doctor Reinolds , Master Northbrooke , and others in their Treatises against Stage-playes ; interpret this vanity in the Psalmist of Stage-playes, and such like spectacles, which they condeme as vanity . Hence Clemens Alexandrinus writes of playes; that they are fraught with obscene and vaine speeches, rashly uttered ; hence Gregory Nazianzen stiles Playes ; the vanities of life, and the hydra of pleasures . Hence Chrysostome writes of Playes : that they are fraught with langhter, wantonnesse, and words full of folly and vanitie . Hence Anastatius Sianita writes of the Severiani : That their positions were more ridiculous, absurd and foolish, then those things that are acted in any Stage-playes. Hence Bernard writes, That the true souldiers of Christ, reject and abominate Players and Stage-playes, as vanities and false frenzies. Hence Iohn Salisbury stiles Playes, the spectacles and rudiments of vanitie. Hence Cyprian, Lactantius, Cyril of Hierusalem, Augustine, Basil, Salvian, Macarius Ægyptius , and others, formerly quoted , have utterly condemned Stage-playes, as the very pompes and vanites of this wicked world, which Christians have abjured in their Baptisme. If then we beleeve these severall Fathers, together with Plautus , Macrobius , Apuleius , three Heathen Authors; or Master Gosson, Master Northbrooke, Master Stubs, and Doctor Reinolds , in their bookes against Stage-playes : or the third Blast against Stage-playes and Theaters , together with C aesar Bulingerus De Theatro, lib . 1. cap . 11. de Ludis p . 141. We must needs acknowledge, both playes themselves, together with their stile and subject matter, to be meere idle uselesse vanities ; Since all these repute and stile them such. Secondly, our owne experience, will readily subscribe unto it as an undoubted truth. For what are all our Stage-playes, but the frothy excrements of superfluous idle braines; which being impregnated with some swelling words , or high-towring conceited plots of vanitie , (which they secretly adore with highest admiration , as being worthy the most suparlative Stage-applause ,) doe travell in paine untill they have brought forth their long-conceived issues on the Theater, w  ch prove but ridiculously vaine at best? What are they, but meere miscelanies of over- studied, well-expressed vanities? Their subiect, their action, their circumstances; what else are they but vanitie of vanities, but ridiculous follies, or frensies in the highest degree, unworthy of a wise-mans sight , much lesse his approbation? Their Actors, their ordinary Spectators , what are they but ridiculous, foolish, vaine, fancasticke persons, who delight in nothing more then toyes and vanities? Their very fruits, their ends, what are they else, but either the nourishing, or the increase of sinne and vanitie? If we survay the good, the profit which accrues from Stage-playes, we shall find, that they are good for naught; that they bring no glory at all to God, no benefit, no comfort unto men; therefore they must needs be vaine . If we respect Gods glory; where shall we finde God more dishonoured, more provoked then in Stage-playes? which had the Divell himselfe for their author , subject, and composer, who proves sometimes their Actor too. Where are Gods Name, his Word, his Attributes, his Ministers, his Saints, his Substitutes, his Children, his Worship, his Graces, more blasphemed, prophaned, traduced, or derided, then in Stage-playes ? Where is God more offended, more affronted with swarmes of crying sinnes, then in the Play-house? And how can it bee otherwise? We know it was the received opinion of the ancient Pagans; that their Devill-Idols (to whose solemne honour and worship, all Stage-playes were at first devoted) were so well pleased with these Theatricall Enterludes, that if they did but honour and adore them with them, they would forthwith pardon, yea, forget their sinnes against them, and of enemies, become propitious, kinde, and friendly to them . And can any Christian then conceive such base conceits of God, or so farre derogate from his Majestie, his purity, his Deitie, as to deeme him honoured or delighted, not grieved, not offended with such Stage-playes wherewith Devill-Idols were attoned ? Doubtlesse, that which the Devill himselfe hath invented, appropriated to his owne honour and advantage, can never bring any praise or glory unto God : therefore our Stage-playes cannot doe it. If we reflect upon the good they bring to men, alas, what is it? Where doe they sucke in more poyson, more corruption; where doe they more blunt their virtues, or make greater shipwracke of all their Christian graces, then as Stage-playes, the grand-empoysoners of mens soules ? I have knowne, heard, and read of thousands, who have wrackt their credits, their estates, their virtues, yea, their very bodies and soules at Playes, at Play-houses: but never could I yet heare or read of any who have beene meliorated or reclaimed by them. I have read of sundry pestiferous effects, and sinfull fruits of Stage-playes, of which you shall heare at large heereafter : but never could I finde in all the Fathers, in any moderne Writers, so much as any one necessary virtue, grace or reall benefit that hath resulted from them I have read of divers Republicks, Emperours, Magistrates, and Authors of all sorts, who have suppressed Stage- playes, as intollerable evils in a Christian or well-ordered Commonweale; they being the Seminaries of all kinde of vices; the chiefe corrupters of mens minds and manners : But never could I meet with any, who affirmed them to be good or usefull in a State. Since therefore it is evident by all the premises; that Stage-playes in their best condition, are but meere Nugatorie, ridiculous, superfluous vanities, which leads to serious evils; and bring no glory at all to God, nor good to men; we may conclude them to be not onely incongruous, but unlawfull unto Christians, [illeg.] who must not cast their eyes upon the vanities of this wicked world, since Christ himselfe hath crucified them in his flesh , that we for ever might abandon them. You have seene now, Christian Readers, the common stile and subject matter of popular Stage-playes, and I dare confidently averre, that there is scarce one Stage-play this day acted (our moderne Playes being farre more loved then these of former times ) whose subject, parts and passages are not reducible to all, to some, or one at least of these recited particualrs: therefore we must needs passe sentence of condemnation against them, even in this respect. Fourthly, as Stageplayes are sinfull, and utterly unlawfull unto Christians in regard of their stile and subiect matter, so likewise are they in respect both of their Actors and Spectators. If we seriously survay the lives, the practises, the conditions of our common Stage-players, we may truely write of them, as William of Malmesbury doth of Edricke; that they are the very dregs of men; the shame, the blemish of our English Nation; ungracious helluoes; crafty shifting companions, who purchase money, not by their generositie, but by their tongues and impudency; they being wise to dissemble, apt to counterfeit, prone to dive into the secrets both of King & State, as faithfull subjects; and more ready to divulge them on the Stage as notorious Traitors . What Tully records of Catiline; that there was never so great a faculty of corrupting youth in any man, as in him; he bearing a most lewd affection to other mens wives himselfe, and serving likewise as a most wicked Pander to the unchaste desires of others; promising to some the fruite of their lusts, to others the death of their Parents, not onely by instigating, but likewise by assisting them . Or what a grave historian reports of Vortiger a British King; that he was prone to the enticements of the flesh, and a bond-slave allmost to every vice, &c. May be truely verefied of most common Actors; who are usually the very filth and off-scouring, the very lewdest, basest, worst and most perniciously vitious of the sonnes of men; as all times, all Authors have reputed them. The ancient Pagan Romans, (as histories, as Fathers both relate) accounted Stage-players such infamous, vitious, base, unworthy persons; as they did by publicke Edicts, not onely deprive them of all honour and preferment in the Common-weale; but likewise disfranchise and remove them from their tribe; as degenerating from that Roman stocke, and noble parentage from which they were descended. The ancient Councels , Fathers and Christians in the Primitive church, did ipso facto, excommunicate all Stage-players, till they had utterly renounced, relinquished their diabolicall profession: reputing them the very pollution, shame, and blemish of the Church; The very depravers and destroyers of youth; the very instruments of sinne and Satan; yea, such accursed miscreants, as were altogether unworthy, both of the Society of Christians, and of those blessed Sacraments, those holy Ordinances of the Lord, which are not to be given to such unholy dogs, nor cast before such filthy swine as they. Plato, Atistotle, the Massillienses, with sundry Christian, yea, Pagan States and Emperours , (as I shall prove hereafter) exiled all professed Stage-players out of their Common-weales, as the Iewes and Primitive Christians excluded them from the Church. Needs therefore must they be extremely vitious, intollerably pernitious (and so by consequence their very Stage-playes to) whom Church and State have thus joyntly vomited out as putred, noysome and infectious members, unfit to live in either ; as Ludovieus Uives well concludes. What Polycarpe, once replyed to Marcion the Heretique; I know thee to be the first-borne of Satan ; may be fitly appliable to our Common Actors; the Arch-agents. Instruments, and Apparitors of their originall Founder and Father, the Devill; their very profession being nothing else, as Bodine well observes, but an apprentiship of sinne, a way or Trade of wickednesse, which leades downe to hell ; and their lives (a badge of their profession) much like the life of Vortiger , which was tragically vitious in the beginning, miserable in the middest, filthy in the end. What the conditions, lives, and qualities of Stage-players have beene in former Ages, let Cyprian, Nazianzen, Chrysostome, Augustine, Nicholaus Cabasila, Cornelius Tacitus, Marcus Aurelius , with others , testifie. The first of these informes us; That Stageplayers are the Masters, not of teaching, but of destroying youth, insinuating that wickednesse into others, which themselves have sinfully learned. Whence he writes to Eucratius, to excommunicate a Player who trayned up youthes for the Stage; affirming, that it could neither stand with the Maiestie of God, nor the Discipline of the Gospel, that the chastity and honour of the Church should be defiled with so filthy, so infamous a contagion. The more than Sodomiticall uncleannesse of Players lives, he farther thus discyphers. O (Writes he) that thou couldest in that sublime watch-tower insinuate thine eyes into these Players secrets; or set open the closed dores of their bed-chambers, and bring all their innermost hidden Cels unto the conscience of thine eyes; Thou shouldest then see that which is even a very sinne to see: thou mightest behold that, which these groaning under the burthen of their vices, deny that they have committed, and yet hasten to commit: men rush on men with outragious lusts. They doe those things which can neither please those who behold them, nor yet themselves who act them. The same persons are accusers in publike, guilty in secret, being both censurers and nocents against themselves: They condemne that abroad, which they practise at home. They commit that willingly, which when they have committed, 'they reprehend. I am verily a lyar, if those who are such abuse not others: one filthy person defameth others like himselfe; thinking by this meanes to escape the censure of those who are privy to his sinne, as if his owne conscience were not sufficient both to accuse him and condemne him. Thus farre Saint Cyprian , Gregory Nazianzen records of Stage-players; that they repute nothing filthy or dishonest but modesty; that they are the servants, the furtherers of all lewdnesse; this being their onely Art and profession, exceedingly to magnifie themselves for severall kinds of wantonnesse; they being imitators and actors of ridiculous things, accustomed to blowes and buffets, who have shaven off as with a Razor, all their modestie, before ever they had cut their haire, in the wanton shop of all lewdnesse and impuritie; accounting it a kinde of Art, as well to suffer, as to personate, on the stage all horrible beastly wickednesses whatsoever, in the open view of all men. And so he proceedes against them. Saint Chrysostome , as he writes of Stage-players ; that they are infamous persons, &c. well worthy of a thousand deathes, because they personate those villanies, obscenities, adulteries, which all lawes command men to avoyd. So he informes vs likewise, that the Players and Play-haunters of his time were most notorious adulterers, the authors of many tumults and seditions, filling the peoples eares with idle rumors, and Cities with commotions: that they were ready both to speake, and act all wickednesses whatsoever, it being their whole profession thus to doe; and that they were farre more savage than the most cruell beasts. Saint Augustine , as he at large informes us; that the ancient Romans accounting the art of Stage-playing and the whole Scene infamous, ordained, that this sort of men should not onely want the honour of other Citizens, but also bee disfranchised and thrust out of their Tribe, by a legall and disgracefull censure, which the Censors were to execute: because they would not suffer their vulgar sort of people, much lesse their Senators to be defamed, disgraced or defiled with Stage-players: which act of theirs, he stiles; An excellent true Roman prudence to be enumerated among the Romans prayses. So he likewise gives this ignominious epithite unto Players: Scenici nequissimi , most wicked Stage-players : intimating thereby, that Players commonly exceed all others in all kinds of wickednesse. Nicholaus Cabasila hath published upon record. That nothing can be found more wicked, more detestable then a Stage-player. Cornelius Tacitus relates: That in Tiberius his reigne, the Roman Actors grew so immodest, so exorbitant, that they attepted many things seditiously in publike, many things dishonestly in private houses: & that they grew at last to such an height of wickednesse, as that after many complaints against them by the Pretors, they were by Tiberius and the whole Senate exiled out of Italy. Marcus Aurelius himselfe doth testifie , that the adulteries, rapes, murthers, tumults and other out-rages which Stage-players did occasion and commit, were so excessive; and the mindes which they corrupted with their lewdnesse, so numerous; that he was enforced to banish them out of Italy into Hellespont, where he commanded Lambert his Deputie, to keepe them close at worke. We reade likewise, that Nero, Traian, with divers other Roman Emperours., did quite exile all Stage- players out of their Dominions, because their lives, their practises were so vitious, so hurtfull and pernitious to the publike good. Such were the lives, the insolencies, the exorbitances of Stage-players in former times. What the lives, the qualities of our owne domestique Actors are, or have beene heretofore; Two severall Acts of Parliament, which adjudge and stile them Rogues ; together with two penitent reclaimed Play-Poets of our owne, (who were thorowly acquainted with their practises and persons too) will at large declare. The first of these two Play-Poets, who out of conscience renounced his profession, and then wrote against the abominations of our Stage-playes, writes thus of Stage-players: As I have had a saying to these versifying Play-makers, so likewise must I deale with shamelesse in actors. When I see by them yong boyes, inclining of themselves to wickednesse, trained up in filthy speeches, unnaturall and unseemely gestures, to be brought up by these School- masters, in bawdry and in idlenesse, I cannot chuse but with teares and griefe of heart lament. O with what delight can the father behold his sonne bereft of shamefastnesse, and trained up to impudencie? How prone are they of themselves and apt to receive instruction of their lewd teachers, which are the Schoolmasters of sinne in the Schoole of abuse? what doe they teach them, I pray you, but to foster mischiefe in their youth, that it may alwayes abide with them, and in their age bring them sooner unto hell ? And as for these Stagers themselves, are they not commonly such kinde of men in their conversation, as they are in profession? are they not as variable in heart as they are in their parts? are they not as good practisers of bawdery, as inactors? Live they not in such sort themselves, as they give precepts unto others? Doth not their talke on the Stage , declare the nature of their disposition? doth not every one take that part which is proper to his kinde? Doth not the Plough-mans tongue walke of his Plough: the Sea-faring mans of his Mast, Cable and Saile; the Souldiers of his Harnesse, Spear and Shield; and bawdy mates of bawdy matters? Aske them, if in the laying out of their parts, they choose not those parts which are most agreeable to their inclination, and that they can best discharge? And looke what every of them doth most delight in, that he can best handle to the contentment of others. If it bee a roisting, bawdy, or lascivious part, wherein are unseemely speeches, and that they make choyse of them as best answering, and proper to their manner of play: may we not say, by how much the more he exceds in his gesture, he delights himselfe, in his part? and by so mach it is pleasing to his disposition and nature? If (it be his nature) to be a bawdy Player, and he delight in such filthy and cursed actions, shall we not thinke him in his life to be more disordered, and to abhorre virtue? But they perhaps will say; that such abuses as are handled on the Stage, others by their examples are warned to beware of such evils to amendment. Indeed if their authority were greater then the words of the Scripture, or their zeale of more force than of the Preacher, I might easily be perswaded to thinke, that men by them might be called to good life. But when I see the Word of truth proceeding from the heart, and uttered by the mouth of the Reverend Teachers, to be received of the most part into the eare, and but of a few rooted in the heart, I cannot by any meanes beleeve, that the words proceeding from a prophane Player, and uttered in scorning sort, enterlaced with filthy, lewde, and ungodly speeches, have greater force to move men unto virtue, than the words of truth uttered by the godly Preacher, whose zeale is such as that of Moses , who was contented to be rased out of the booke of life, and of Paul , who wished to be separated from Christ for the welfare of his brethren. If the good life of a man be a better instruction to repentance than the tongue, or word, why doe not Players, I beseech you, leave examples of goodnesse to their posteritie? But which of them is so zealous, or so tendereth his saluation, that he doth amend himselfe in those points; which as they say, others should take heed of? Are they not notoriously knowne to be those men in their life abroad, as they are on the Stage, Roisters, Brawlers, I'll-dealers, Bosters, Lovers, Ruffians? So that they are alwayes exercised in playing their parts, and practising wickednesse, making that an Art, to the end they might the better gesture it in their parts. For who can better play the Ruffian, than a very Ruffian? who better the Lover, than they who make it a common exercise? To conclude, the principall end of all their Enterludes, is to feed the world with sights and fond pastimes ; to Iuggle in good earnest the money out of other mans purses into their owne hands. What shall I say? They are infamous men, and in Rome were thought worthy to be expelled, allbeit there was libertie enough to take pleasure. In the Primitive Church they were kept out from the communion of Christians and never remitted till they had performed publike pennance. And thereupon Saint Cyprian in a certaine Epistle counselleth a Bishop, not to receive a Player into the Pension of the Church, by which they were nourished, till there was an expresse act of penance, with protestation to renounce an Art so infamous. Some have objected; that by these publike Playes many forbeare to doe evill, for feare to be publikely reprehended; and for that cause they will say it was tollerated in Rome, wherein Emperours were touched, though they were present. But to such it may be answered; that in disguised Players, given over to all sorts of dissolutenesse, is not found so much as to will to doe good, seeing they care for nothing lesse than for virtue. And thus much for these Players. Thus this Play-Poet, and sometimes an Actor too. Master Stephen Gosson , another reclaimed Play-Poet, writes thus of Stage-Players. That they are uncircumcised Philistims, who nourish a canker in their owne soules: ungodly Masters, whose example doth rather poyson then instruct men. Wherefore (writes he) sithence you see by the example of the Romans, that Playes are Rats-bane to government of Common-weales, and that Players by the iudgement of them are infamous persons, unworthy of the credit of honest Citizens, worthy to be removed their Tribe; if not for Religion, yet for shame, that the Gentiles should iudge you at the last day, or that Publicans and Sinnes should presse into the Kingdome of Heaven before you; withdraw your feet from Theaters with noble Marius; set downe some punishment for Players with the Roman Censors; shew your selves to be Christians, and with wicked Spectators be not puld from Discipline to libertie; from virtue to pleasure, from God to Mammon: so shall you prevent the scourge by repentance, that is comming towards you, and fill up the gulfe, that the Divell by Playes hath digged to swallow you. Thus he. To him I will annex the testimonie of I. G. in his Refutation of the Apologie for Actors. Therefore (writes he) let all Players and founders of Playes, as they tender the salvation of their owne soules, and others, leave off that cursed kinde of life, and betake themselves to such honest exercises and godly mysteries as God hath commanded in his Word to get their living withall. For who will call him a wise man that playes the foole and the vice? Who can call him a good Christian that playeth the part of the Devill, the sworne enemy of Christ? Who can call him a iust man that playeth the dissembling hypocrite? Who can call him a straight dealing man, that playeth a cosoners tricke? and so of all the rest. The wise man is ashamed to play the foole; but Players will seeme to be such in publike view to all the world: A good Christian hateth the Devill, but Players will become artificiall Divils, excellently well. A iust man cannot endure hypocrisie, but all the acts of Players is dissimulation, and the proper name of Player (witnesse the Apologie itselfe) is hypocrite. A true dealing man cannot indure deceit, but Players get their living by craft and cosenage. For what greater cheating can there be, then for mony, to render that which is not monies worth. Then seeing they are fooles, artificiall Divels, hypocrites and coseners, most evident it is that their art is not for Christians to exercise, as being diabolicall, and themselves infamous: such indeed as the Laced aemonians had, & we also have great reason to extrude out of our Common- wealth: for they are idle, vitious, dishonest, malicious preiudiciall and unprofitable to the same. They are idle, for they can take no paines, they know not how to worke, nor in any lawfull calling to get their living: but to avoide labour and worke, like brave and noble beggers, they stand to take money of every one that comes to see them loiter and play. Hence is it that they are vitious, for idlenesse is the mother of vice, and they cannot exercise their offices but in vices, and in treating of and with vitious men. They are dishonest, for they get not to eate by doing good workes, but by speaking filthie, vile, and dishonest words: They are malicious, for they are accustomed, either for their friends or themselves, when they love not a man to speake evill of him; and colourably underhand to mocke and flout at any. They are preiudiciall and unprofitable to the Common-wealth, for they cosen and mocke vs with vaine words, and we pay them good money, &c. From all which ancient and moderne testimonies, I may not unfitly write of Stage-players, as Saint Bernard doth of the ancient Irish in Connereth in Malachias his time. Nusquam adhuc tales expertus fuerat in quantacunque barbarie. Nusquam repereat sie propteruos ad mores; sic ferales adritus; sic ad fidem impios; ad leges barbaros; cervicosos ad disciplinam; spurcos ad vitam, Christiani nomine, re Pagani. And no wonder is it, that Players are so transcendently vitious and unchaste, since they are trained up from their cradles, in the very art, the Schoole of Venerie, lewdnesse and prophannesse ; which quickly eates out all their honesty, their modestie, their virtues, and fraughts them full with vice. Since then it is abundantly evident by the premises, as also by experience; that common Actors are thus excessively vitious, unchaste, prophane, and dissolute in their lives, which drawes them on to a dissolute Religion ; the most of our present English Actors (as I am credibly informed) being professed Papists , as is the Founder of the late erected new Play-house : the Playes which issue from them must needs resemble these their Actors, the fruit being never better than the tree that beares it ; the stream no purer than the Springs that feed it. From whence I deduce this twelfth Syllogisticall Argument against Stage-playes. That whose ordinary Actors and Composers, are for the most part dissolute, infamous, unchaste, prophane, deboyst, and vitious men, must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians, because no good thing can proceed from such. Witnesse, Matth. 7.17, 18. Levit. 5.2.3. Iob 14.4. Eccles. 9.18. But such are the ordinary Actors and Composers of Stage-playes: witnesse the premises. Therefore they must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians: even in this respect. Secondly, as the vitiousnesse of the Actors, even so the evilnesse of the most assiduous Spectators of Stage-playes, infallibly evidenceth them to be evill. If we looke backe to former Ages, we have the expresse testimony of sundry Fathers and Councels, that all the godly Christians in the Primitive Church, and wholly withdraw themselves from Stage-playes; that all those Pagans who either acted or frequented Playes, did immediately upon their conversion to that Christian faith, and their very first admittance into the Church of Christ, even publikely renounce all future acting, or resort to Plaies: and that none but Pagans, unchaste, prophane, and gracelesse persons , who were cast out of the Church by publike Censures, did use to flocke unto them. Hence was it that Tertullian writes thus harshly: So many persons as there are sitting in the Play-house, so many uncleane spirits are there present: intimating, that all the Play-hunters of his Age, were little better than incarnate Devils; whence he seriously dehorts all Christians from Playes. Hence, not onely Clemens Alexandrinus Cyprian , Lactantius Lactantius, Nazianzen , Hierom , Chrysostome ; Augustine , Salvian , Iohn Salisburie , the third Councell of Carthage, Canon 11\. 15. with divers other ancient and moderne Christian Authors : but even Tully , Seneca , and the lascivious Poet Ovid , with sundry other Pagans; doe earnestly disswade men from resorting unto Playes and Theatres, because none but infamous, vitious, dissolute, unchaste, prophane, and gracelesse persons whose company was apt to poyson, to corrupt, all such who durst come nigh them) did frequent them. It is observed by sundry Historians, that Tiberius, Nero, Caligula, Heliogabalus, Verus, Commodus, Gallienus, Carinus , (the most execrably vitious, and unchaste of all the Roman Emperours) delighted most in Playes and Actors; for which they deepely taxe them : whereas the better sort of Emperours were not addicted to them ; but did either banish them their dominions ; or else deminish or withdraw their publike stipends. Suruay we all the Christian, all the Pagan Antiquities this day extant, we shall finde the very best of Christians, Iewes and Pagans of all Ages, all places , not onely wholly absteining from, but likewise censuring and condemning Stage-playes , the very worst, the dissolutest and unchastest onely of them resorting to them with delight. Saint Chrysostome , Ovid , with sundry others informe us, That Adulterers, Whore-masters, Panders, Bawdes, Whores, and such like effeminate, idle, unchaste, lasciuious, gracelesse persons, were the most assiduous Play-haunters in their times. Whence I siodor Hispalensis , Primasius , Remigius , Haymo, and Ansolme write, That the Play-honse and the Stewes were oni and the same in ancient times; because after the Playes were ended, the whores who resorted to the Play-houses, or were harbored in them, did prostitute themselves upon the Theater, unto the lust of others. Whece they all derive the Word fornication; a fornicibus, seu locis theatralibus; from Brothels and Play-houses, where Whores were kept and prostituted after the Playes were acted . Such and no other were Play-houses  & Stage-frequenters in former Ages. And are they not now the same. If we seclude those children, those novices, whose ignorance, childishnesse, vanitie, folly, or injudiciousnesse allure them to playes or such like Gugaes, which men of riper yeares and iudgement doe contemne ; together with some few sociable ingenuous disposition, whom the pressing importunitie of carnall friends , or vehement sollicitations of lewde acquaintance doe casully draw to Stage-playes, against the secret reluctances of their owne gain-saying consciences , what else are the residue (at least the Maior part) of our assiduous Play-haunters, but Adulterers, Adulteresses, whoremasters, whores, Bawdes, Panders, Ruffians, Roarers, Drunkards, Prodigals, Cheaters, idle, infamous, base, prophane, and godlesse persons, who hate all grace, all goodnesse, and make a mocke of piety ? What are they but the very filth, the drosse, the scumme, of the Societies and place where they live? the very Mothes, the Drones and Cankerwormes of the Common- weale ? the shame and blemish of Religion? the most putred, scandalous, noxious, and degenerate branches both of Church and State, which should be spued out, bee lopped off from both, had they their iust demerits ? If any Play-haunter deeme this censure over-harsh, his own conscience must subscribe unto it, if selfe-love hath not blinded it ; since hee can hardly cull out any who dis-affect or come not vnto Stage-playes, so suparlatively vitious, or unchaste, as those who most frequent them. This, all the fore- quoted Authors largely testifie in their Quotations in the Margent: to whom I shall onely adde the suffrage of I.G . in his Refutation of the Apologie for Actors. p. 55\. 56. But now (saith he) draw to the conclusion of my discourse, I will onely describe briefly, who for the most part they are who runne madding unto Playes. In generall the vulgar sort, in whom Cicero pro Planco, saith, there is no reason, counsell or discretion. But to particularize some onely among all. The prophane Gallant to feed his pleasure; the Citie Dames to langh at their owne shames; the Countrey Clowns, to tell wonders when hee comes home, of the vanitie he hath seene; the Bawdes to intice; the Whores and Curtezens to set themselves to sale; the Cutpurse to steale; the Pick pocket to filtch; the knave to bee instructed in cosening trickes; Youth to learne amorous conceits; some for one wicked purpose, some for another; none to any good intent, but all fruitlessely to spend their time. But among any others, that goe to the Theaters, when shall you see an ancient Citizen, a chaste Matron, a modest Maid, a grave Senator, a wie Magistrate, a iust Iudge, a godly Preacher, a religious man not blinded in ignorance, but making conscience of his wayes. You shall never see any of those at Playes, for they count it shamefull and ignominious, even an Act of reproach that may redound unto them . I shall close up this with that of Petrarch , The way to the Play-house is altogether unknowne to good men; to which when any ill man goeth, hee returnes the worst of any: and if any good men goe thither ignorantly by accident, they shall not want contagion; So infectious, so vitious is the company that usually resorts to Plaies: the very best of them in their best condition, being for the most part, lovers of pleasures, more than lovers of God; having onely an outward forme of godinesse ( and most scarce so much ) but denying the power thereof . From all which premises, I shall derive two unanswerable arguments, to prove the unlawfulnesse of Stage-playes. The first of them, being the thirteenth in number, may be cast into this forme. That which the very best, the holiest Christians, have alwayes constantly avoyded, condemned as evill; the very worst and most notoriously vitious only of Christians, of Pagans, of ancient and moderne times, affected, applauded, frequented with pleasure and delight; is certainely evill, and so unlawfull unto Christians. But such is the case of Stage-playes. Therefore they are certainely evill, and so unlawfull unto Christians. The Minor is evident by the premises, by experience, and by the seventh act ensuing. The Major is manifest by its owne light. For first the Primitive Christians and godly men, (whose steps we ought to follow ) abhorre, reject, condemne nought else but sinfull, scandalous pernicious pastimes, (not Christian, laudable or lawfull recreations) repugnant to the Scriptures , to the inward principles of grace implanted in their soules; or to the discipline, puritie and honour of the Church, the Saints of God who went before them; the onely rules by which their lives, their iudgements, their affections are directed. Secondly, unregenerate gracelesse persons, as they commonly bate nought else but goednesse , so they most really affect, admire, frequent the pleasures, the delights of sinne, which are most homogeneous to their lusts, most suitable to their sinfull dispositions . No man can finde any true contentment or delight in any thing, but that which is sutable to his nature ; because al pleasure, all complacency whatsoever, ariseth from similitude and proportion. Now nothing is so connaturall, so consonant to the corruptions of depraved Stage-haunters as sinfull, lustfull, or polluted objects. Therefore Theatricall Enterludes, which wicked men most delight in, and many of them so adore, as to make Theaters their Chappels, yea, Playes their weekely Sermons ; must needs be sinfull and polluted, as their natures are: else they could never flocke unto them daily with delight, to their no small expence. So that this first Argument is unanswerable. The second, (in course the fourteeenth) Argument against Playes, from hence, is this. Those things to which lewde company, unchaste, deboist prophane, and gracelesse persons, flocke by troopes, with greedinesse and delight, is undoubtedly sinfull, yea, utterly unlawfull unto Christians. But such company, such persons as these, (especially Strumpets, Pandors, Bawdes, Adulterers, Whoremasters, Drunkards, Prodigals,) doe flocke by troopes to Stage-playes, with greedinesse and delight. Therefore they are undoubtedly sinfull, yea, utterly unlawfull unto Christian: The Minor is sufficiently confirmed by the premises; by the third Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters, pag. 66\. and by the suffrage of Nazianzen ; who stiles Stage- playes, the miserable Spectacles of Wicked men . The Major is irrefragable. First, because the Scriptures enjoyne all Christians; not to keepe company with wicked men; not to have concord, fellowship or communion with them, in wicked things especially, : not to walke in the counsell of the ungodly, to stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornefull , but wholly to withdraw and turne themselves from every one who walkes disorderly: after the example of David ; who hated the assemblies of the ungodly: and would not know a wicked person; giving them this resolute farewell: Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping. Secondly, because Christians must not conforme themselves to the wicked of the world , much lesse comply with them in their unlawfull pleasures of sinne, which are but for a season; since Christ hath suffered for them in the flesh to this very end, that they should no longer live the rest of their time to the lusts of men, but to the will of God; the time Past of their lives, being sufficient for them to have wrought the will of the Gentiles Thirdly, because ill company, are not onely an evident appearance of evill, which Christians must avoyd; but likewise a most dangerous insinuating, bewitching temptation; a prevalent perswasive provocation unto evill; and so much the more dangerous, by how much the more numerous . Lewde companions especially such as haunt our Theaters) are of a most infectious, leprous, captivating ensnaring qualities they are all of Catilines disposition, they will quickly corrupt all those who entertaine their friendship, or intrude into their fellowship; making them as unchaste, deboyst, and vitious as themselves at last , though they were vertuously dispesed at the first; how much more then will they poyson and corrupt all such who are naturally inclined unto vice ? To entercommon therefore with such contagious persons in their Play-house Conventicles, their Theatricall Enterludes must needes bee sinfull, because it is a strong allective, a vehement temptation unto sinne. Object . If any here object, that many good Divines, many gracious, pious Christians resort oft-times to Stage-playes, as well as vitious persons; with whom men may accompany without any danger: therefore there is no such hazzard, such pravity or infection in Play-haunters society as is suggested. I Answer , First, that perchance some few exorbitant, scandalous histrionicall, (but farre from good) Divines, at leastwise from good Christians, may sometimes visit Theaters and publike Enterludes, to the scandall of Religion, the blemish of their function, and ill example of others; for which they should, they ought to receive an heavy censure, were Ecclesiasticall Discipline duly exercised. But I dare presume there is not one zealous, faithfull, conscionable, painefull Minister this day living, who dares to grace a Play or Play-house with his presence: since not onely divers sathers: but likewise twenty five severall Councels, besides Sundry Canonicall Constitutions, have expresly inhibited all sorts of Clergie-men whatsoever, under paince of suspension, and perpetuall deprivation, to be either Actors or Spectators of any publike Stage-play, or to countenance it by their presence: which I would all scandalous Play-haunting Ecclesiastickes (of which there are now too many)  would cordially consider; that so they might reforme their errour, for feare of degradation, which they well demerit, and good Diocesans may justly inflict for this crime. Secondly, I answer; that perchance some puny new-converted Christian Novices, being altogether unacquainted with the hurtfulnesse, the wickednesse of Stage- playes, may sometimes be occasionally drawne unto Stage-playes; partly to beare others company, whose displeasure they might else incurre: partly through the importunate solicitations of lewde acquaintance, partly by the novalty or subject of the Play it selfe; partly to acquaint themselves the better with the dangerous consequences and fruites of Play-houses, that so they may more iustly condemne them, more peremptorily abandon them for future times ; yet principally because they are not fully convinced of their sinfulnesse. But that many, that any gracious, godly, growen, faithfull Christians, who are thorowly instructed in the wayes of godlinesse , or in the noxious qualities of Playes, doe constantly, doe frequently resort to Play-houses, to Stage-playes, (especially out of a loue or liking unto Playes themselves) I utterly deny. First, because no truely sanctifyed Christian (who cannot possibly delight in any knowne evill) can ever patiently heare, or deightfully behold, the severall grosse abominable wickednesses that are daily acted and committed on the Stage, but his very heart would forthwith boyle within him yea, his eyes gush forth with teares, out of an holy indignation against them . Secondly, because it is impossible, that true godly Christians shou'd take any reall pleasure in these Theatricall Enterludes which wicked men most affect: since the gracious, the gracelesse, are as contrary one to the other in their chiefe delights, as light and darkenesse; righteousnesse and unrighteousnesse; Christ and Belial; Beleivers and Infidels. Thirdly, because all godly Christians in the Primitive Church, have wholly abandoned Stage-playes, as sinfull, as unchristian pleasures ; Therefore all pious Christians must needs abhorre them now; they being guided by the selfe same Word and Spirit As the Primitive Christians were ; so that they cannot chuse but have the very selfe same judgment with them in all things, and so in case of Stage-playes, as well as in other things. Thirdly, admit some godly Christians do commonly resort to Play-houses, (which I cannot beleeve) yet these are few in number; and those for the most part children , not onely in spirituall, but even in naturall understanding ; being babes in yeares, as well as in grace : Yea, they are nought else but blemishes of Religion , and scandals to the Church, to all their fellow Saints, who blame, who much condemne them for their Play-haunting . The saints who flocke to Stage-playes (if there be any such) are but a despicable, undiscernable company, unable to draw others unto goodnesse; where as the gracelesse wicked ones who daily visit them, are many in number, contagious in quality, more apt to poyson, to infect all those who dare approach them, than one who is full of running Plague-sores. Therefore it must of necessity be dangerous to resort to Stage-Playes . We all know by wofull experience, That mans corrupt nature is farre more pendulously propense to vitious, than to good examples: and that evill things are farre more apt to defile that which is good, than good things to rectifie that which is evill. Whence it alwayes comes to passe (as Chrysostome well observes) that as oft as good and bad men associate themselves together, the ill are never meliorated by the good, but the good are always contaminated, corrupted by the evil: even as when Clay and Meale are kneaded together, the Clay defiles the Meale, not the Meale refines the Clay . Saint Paul informes us; that a little leaven, leaveneth the whole lumpe: . King Solomon ; that one sinner destroyeth must good; and the sententious Satyrist; . That one scabbed sheepe destroyes a whole flocke, one dandraffe Swine, the whole heard; one rotten grape the whole cluster : . Much more then will those troopes of wicked ones, who meet at Theaters (which are able to corrupt the strongest Christian) deprave those few unstable tender babes in Christ, who intrude into their company; as Seneca well argueth in our present case: It is a good observation of a grave Historian: that is farre better for a Kingdome, to have a bad King and good Councellors to advise him, than a good King and bad Counsellors: his reason is (and it is Saint Bernards too) because one bad man, may happily be reformed by many good; but many evil men can by no meanes be over-ruled, or rectified, by any one man be he never so good. I may aptly accomodate this reason to our present purpose thus. Admit some few good Christians resort sometimes to Stage-plays; yet since they alwayes meet with farre more farre greater troopes of lewde, deboist companions there, who (without Gods preventing grace, which Play-haunters cannot challenge) will certainely corrupt them in a moment : it must needs be sinfull, be dangerous to resort unto them: since the fewer good ones, are . more likely to be vitiated. by the major multitude of wicked ones, whose wickednesse exceeds their goodnesse; than the wicked ones to be reclaimed by their goodnesse, of which they are vncapable. Lastly, the presence of some godly men at Stage- playes, can never make Play-assemblies good, in God or mans esteeme. When good and bad men ioyne together in Religious duties; the goodnesse of . the lesser part denominates the whole, and makes it good in Gods, in mens account : because the end, the cause of this convention, is Gods glory. But when good and bad confederate themselues together in any delights of sinne, God lookes not on the goodnesse of the good but upon the wickednesse of good and bad, condemning all for a Congregation of euill doers because the obiect, the end of these their conventicles are unlawfull. When gracious and gracelesse persons shall sit promiscuously together in a Play-house, beholding some prophane lascivious Enterlude with delight; not onely God himselfe, but even Saints and Angels frowne upon them, as a fraternitie of evill doers; and a Satanicall unchristian assembly , (as the Fathers testifie ;) because the most of the are such,  & the end for wch they meet is such. Wherefore, since the whole Conventicle of Play-haunters in Gods, in Angels, in holy mens esteeme, is alwayes evill, notwithstanding the presence of some few godly oues; these Playes themselves must certainely be execrably odious to all good Christians, (who must abandon all lewde companions ) even this respect. Fistly, Stage-playes must needs bee abominable, unlawfull unto Christians, both in regard of their manner of Action, and of all those severall parts, concomitants and cirumstances that attend them. From whence I raise this fifteenth Argument. That whose manner of action, parts, concomitants, and severall circumstances are sinfull; must certainly be abominable and unlawfull unto Christians , 1 Thess . 5. 22. But such are the manner of action, parts, concomitants, and severall circumstances of Stage-playes. Therefore they are certainly abominable and unlawfull unto Christians. The Major needs no confirmation; because such as the forme, the parts and circumstances are, such questionlesse is the whole. The Minor I shall evidence by a particular discussion. First, of the very manner of acting Stage-playes: wherein I shall examine: First, the hypocrisie; Secondly the obscenitie and lasciviousnesse; Thirdly, the grosse effeminacy; Fourthly, the extreame vanitie and follie, which necessarily attends the acting of Playes. Secondly, of the severall parts that are usually acted in Stage-playes; which are as sinfull as various. Thirdly, of the ordinary apparell wherein Playes are acted: which is, First of all, womanish, belonging to the female Sex: Secondly, costly, fantasticall, strange, lascivious, whorish, provoking unto lewdnesse. Fourthly, of the severall concomitants or circumstances of Stage-playes: which I shall reduce to these foure Heads. Lascivious dancing. Amorous obscene songs: Effeminate lust-exciting Musicke. Profuse, inordinate lascivious laughter, and vaine theatricall applauses: omitting all other adjuncts, shewes, and circumstances of Playes, which Horace , and some others mention, as not so pertinent to our present purpose. To begin, with the first branch of the first particular, to wit, the hypocrisie, faining, or dissimulation that is exercised in acting Stage- playes. If we seriously consider the very forme of acting Playes, we must needes acknowledge it to be nought else but grosse hypocrisie. All things are counterfeited, feined, dissembled; not bing really or sincerly acted. Players are alwayes counterfeiting, representing the persons habits, offices, callings, parts, conditions, speeches, actions, lives,; the passions, the affections, the anger, hatred, cruelty, love, revenge, dissentions; yea, the very vices, sinnes, and lusts; the adulteries, incests, rapes, murthers, tyrannies, thefts, and such like crimes of other men, of other sexes, of other creatures; yea oft-times of the Divell himselfe, and Pagan Divellgods . They are alwayes acting others , not themselves: they vent notorious lying fables, as undoubted truthes: they put false glosses upon Histories, persons, virtues, vices, all the whole action of Playes is nought else but feining, but counterfeiting, but palpable hypocrisie and dissimulation which God, which men abhorre: therefore it must needs be sinfull. If any here obiect: That the acting of Playes is no hypocrysie, no dissimulation, it being onely done in sport, in imitation, with no sinister intent at all, to hurt, to cheate, or circumvent men. I answer; First, that admit it be but a meere imitation of other mens persons, parts and vices, yet it must needs bee sinfull: because the very imitation of wicked men, of Pagans, of Idols, of Idolaters, especially in their lewdest wickednesses (the most vsuall subject of Enterludes) is without all question evill , as the Scriptures plainly teach us. Secondly, I answer, that by the feining used in our Stage-playes, many of our Spectators are deceived, all cheated, Deceived, with forged fabulous histories instead of truthes; with false representions of true stories: with palliated vices in leiu of virtues : with virtues vizarded under the names of vice; with bad Playes oft-times which all dislike, instead of good, as some in some respects account them. Cheated, with shadowes instead of substance: with sinfull, heathenish, unchristian spectacles, in place of honest recreations: These Stage- hypocrisies, which at the very best, are pure vanity, and so not valuable; doe cheate many of their honesty, their civility, their chastity, their estates, their reputation, their virtues, their salvation: most, of their money, all, of their time : too deare a price for so fruitless, so wretchlesse a purchase. Besides, they involve men in the guilt of sundry sinnes , which they little feared or suspected, to the eternall hazzard of their soules, which is a great deceit. Yea, the very end why Players act their Euterludes, is onely to cheate mens money out of their purses by dishonest meanes , not giving quid pro quo : The very ground-worke therefore of this objection, is but forged. Thirdly, admit that no man were cheated, or prejudiced by that counterfeiting, which accompanies the acting of all Stage-playes, yet the meere acting of the persons, parts, gestures, offices, actions, passions; especially of the Sexes, Vices, Anger, Furie, Love, Revenge and Villanies of other men, be it in sport, in representation onely, is hypocrisie. For what else is hypocrisie in the proper signification of the word, but the acting of anothers part or person on the Stage : or what else is an hypocrite, in his true etimologie, but a Stage-player, or one who acts anothers part : as sundry Authors and Gramarians teach us. Hence that common epithite in our Latine Authors: Histrionica hypocrisis : And hence is it, that not onely divers moderne English and Latine Writers, but likewise sundry Fathers here quoted in the Margent, stile Stage-players, hypocrites; Hypocrites, Stage-players, as being one and the same in substance: there being nothing more familiar with them, then to describe an hypocrite by a Stage-player; and a Stage-player by an hypocrite. If therefore we given any credit to the Fathers, or Authors here alleadged; we must needs acknowledge, the very acting of Stage-playes to be hypocrisie; and Players themselves to be meere hypocrites, (their very profession being nothing else, but an artificiall hypocrisie ,) and so an abominable, and unchristian exercise. For God, who is truth it selfe , in whom there is no variablenesse, no shadow of change no feining, no hypocrisie ; as he hath given a vniforme distinct and proper being to every creature, the bounds of which may not be exceeded: so he requires that the actions of every creature should be honest and sincere , devoyde of all hypocrisie , as all his actions, and their natures are. Hence he enjoyes all men at all times, to be such in shew, as they are in truth: to seeme that outwardly which they are inwardly ; to act themselves, not others: to imitate those men, those graces which his word prescribes them; not those accursed villanies, which wicked men (who are now in hell) haue left behinde them. God requires truth in the inward parts ; in the soule, the affections; yea, in the habit, speeches, gestures, in the whole intire man. Now this counterfeiting of persons, affections, manners, vices, sexes, and the like, which is inseparably incident to the acting of Playes; as it transformes the Actors into what they are not; so it insuseth falshood into every part of soule and body, as all hypocrisie doth ; in causing them to seeme that in outward appearance which they are not in truth: therefore it must needs bee odious to the God of truth; as well as the common accursed hellish art of face-painting, which the Fathers , with others much condemne, even from this very ground; because it sophisticates and perverts the workes of God, in putping a false glosse upon his creatures. And this the personating of Stage-playes alwayes doth, as much, nay more then it. Neither will this qualifie the matter, that this Stage-hypocrisie is onely in merriment. For if Davids counterfeiting of himselfe to be mad before Achish King of Gath, for the safe-gard of his life ; or Iosephes iesting dissimulation with his brethren , were sinfull, as good Divines repute it; because there was a lie involved in it. Much more must this wanton acting hypocrisie be abominably sinfull, because it is meerely voluntary, there being no impulsive cause to move men to it. If the damnation of those who doe evill, that good may come of it, be iust : much more must their condemnation be righteous, their sinne exceeding great, who commit hypocrisie ( a great, a double iniquity ) on the open Theater, to no other end, but to make others sinfull sport to passe away their precious time. Since then it is evident by the premises, that the very acting of Stage-playes is hypocrisie, as Tertullian and Cyprian , together with Iren aeus, Basil, Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostome, Tatianus, Pascatius Ratbertus , and the other fore- quoted Author largely teach us: we may hence conclude them to bee odious unto God. Wherefore I shall here close up this Scene, with this sixteenth Play- condemning Argument. That, whose very action is but meere hypocrisie, but grosse dissimulation, must questionlesse bee execrable and unlawfull unto Christians; Witnesse, Matth. 23. 13, 14, 15. 23, 27, 28, 29. c. 24. 51. Luke 12. 1. Gal. 2. 13. 1. Tim. 4. 2. Iam, 3. 17 and that excellent passage of of Tertullian our purpose, recited in the Margent. But such and no other is the very action of Stage-playes: as the precedent Authors: together with the third blast of Retrait of from Stage-Playes and Theaters, p. 110. to 117. expresly testifie. Therefore they must questionlesse be execrable and unlawfull unto Christians, even in this respect. Secondly, as the hypocrisie, even so the lasciviousnesse of acting Stage- playes, doth draw an inexpiable guilt upon them, as this seventeenth Argument will demonstrate. That whose very action is obscene, lascivious, amorous, and unchaste, must needs be hatefull and unlawfull unto Christians. But such is the very action of Stage-playes. Therefore they must needs be hatefull and unlawfull unto Christians. The Maior is without all controversie, since God himselfe enjoynes all Christians, to live chastly, soberly, holily, and godly in this present world, as becommeth Saints ; not walking in lasciviousnesse, lusts, or wantonnesse, as the Gentiles, or other carnall persons doe: but absteining from these and all other fleshly lusts which warre against the soule. Lasciviousnesse (together with all amourous wanton gestures, complements and imbracements which issue from it) is a fruit of the flesh ; an evill that proceeds from within, and so defiles the heart of man from which it springs. It is a sinne of which God takes especiall notice, and will certainly charge it on mens consciences at the last. A sinne to be seriously repented of. A sinne to which the Gentiles and other wicked men were given over. A sinne, for which God threatens to punish the daughters of Zion. A sinne which disinherits and shuts men out of heaven. A sinne which sundry Fathers have plentifully condemned, as mis-beseeming Christians, whose very outward gestures and deportment ought to be modest, chaste, and holy , as becommeth the Gospell of Christ. The Maior therefore is unquestionable. The Minor is abundantly ratified; First, by the concurrent testimony of sundry Fathers and moderne Authors, who from hence condemne all Stage-playes, because the acting of them is obscene, and amorous. Witnesse Tertullian. De spectaculis lib. cap. 17\. We are commanded (writes he) to put away all wantonnesse and incontinency: by this meanes therefore we are divorced from the Theater, the private consistory of uncleannesse, where nothing is approved, but what in all other places is disapproved. Yea, its greatest praise is for the most part concinnated of that lasciviousnesse, that filthinesse which the Stage-player acteth; which the Actor likewise representeth by women, who have banished the modesty of their sex, that so they may more easily blush at home, than on the Stage. Which finally the Patomimus doth suffer in his body from his childhood, that so he may be expert in his profession. Yea, the very Stewes themselves, the sacrifices of publike lust, are brought forth upon the Stage, they being more miserable in the presence of women, from whom alone they were concealed; and before the eyes of every age, of every degree, the place, the hire, the testimoniall are represented, yea, published unto those to whom there is no need I forbear to mention more, it being meet they should lie obscured in darknesse, in their dungeons, lest they should defile the light. Let the Senate blush, let all degrees blush at this, since those very murtherers of their owne chastity, fearing their actions should be manifested to the people, blush once a yeere. Now if all uncleannesse must be execrable to us, why should it be lawfull to heare those things which it is unlawfull to speake? for since we may know that all scurrillity, and every vaine word is condemned by God, how can it be lawfull to heare those things which are a wickednesse to commit- Why should those things which defile a man being uttered onely with his mouth, not seeme to pollute him, when they passe through his eyes and eares by his consent? Since the eyes and eares, lie open to the soule: neither can he be made or reputed, cleane, whose appariters are defiled. Thou hast therefore an interdiction of the Theater, from the interdiction of uncleannesse. Thus Tertullian. Clemens Alexandrinus , Cyprian , Arnobius , Lactantius , Tatianus , Cyril of Ierusalem , Saint Basil , Gregory Nyssen , declaime much against the lasciviousnesse, the lewdnesse which attends the acting of Playes; especially the Floralian Enterludes, whose transcendent filthinesse, was so execrably odious, as I dare not to relate it. Gregory Nazianzen , considering the filthinesse that accompanies Playes; doth from thence stile Play-houses, the lascivious shops of all filthinesse and impuritie: Playes ; the petulancies of Players, fraught with all incontinency: the dishonest and unseemely disciplines of lascivious men, who repute nothing filthy but modesty: and Players the servants of filthinesse, the counterfeiters of ridiculous things, who are ready in the open view of all men, to suffer or act all detestable things whatsoever. Eusebius Pamphilus from the selfe-same ground, cals Stage-players, men of waton and lewde gestures; who did wonderfully delight the Spectators, and made Maximinus the tyrant sport. Saint Chrysostome writes, That all things which are acted on the Stage, are most filthy and lascivious: the words, the apparell, the gestures, the censure, the musicke, the glances of the eyes, the ditties, the pipes, the very arguments of the Playes themselves; All things, I say, are full of filthy lasciviousnesse. Whence they infuse so great lasciviousnesse into the hearers and spectators minds, that all of them may seeme to endevour, even with one consent to eradicate all modestie out of their hearts, and to satisfie their Lusts with pernicious pleasure , Saint Augustine, as he much declaimes against the obscenity of acting of Playe, in sundry places; so hee informes us from his own experience; That on the solemne day of the lotion of Berecynithea, the mothers of the Gods, such things were publikely chanted by most wicked Stage-players; as did not beseeme, I say not, the mother of the Gods to heare; but even the mother of any of the Senators, or of any honest men; yea, the mother of the Stage-players themselves. For humane modestie hath such a respect towards parents which wickednesse it selfe cannot wholly take away. The Players themselves might blush, to act in private at their owne houses of exercise sake before their owne mothers, that filthinesse of obscene words, and deeds, which they did publikely act before the mother of the gods, in the sight and hearing of a most numerous multitude of both sexes: which if she being inticed by curiosity could bee circumfusedly present at these Playes, she ought at least to depart ashamed from them, her chastity being offended with them. What things are sacrileges, if these were sacrifices? or what is pollution if this were lotion? And these were called dishes, as if some feast were celebrated, wherewith the uncleane Devils might be fed, as with their banquets. For who may not discerne what spirits they are which are delighted with such obscenities? unlesse he be ignorant whether there be at all any uncleane spirits deceiving men under the name of Gods, or unlesse he leade such a life, in which he may rather desire the favour and feare the wrath of these, than the true God. Thus he. That pious Father Salvian, records the obseenity of acting Stage-playes to be such, that no chaste, no modest face could once behold it, no gracious tongue relate it, without sin or shame. If then we will give any credit to these recited Fathers, with sundry other here recited in the ensuing Scene. Or to the third Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters; to Master Northbrooke against vaine-Playes and Enterludes; To Master Gosson his Playes confuted, to Master Stubs in his Anotomie of Abuses, p .101. to 107\. To Doctor Reinolds in his Overthrow of Stage-playes, to Barnabas Brissonius, Ioannis Mariana, or Bulengerus, De Spectaculis & Ludis Scenicis l.1.c .50,51,52. or to Bishop Babington Bishop Andrewes, Osmund Lake, Master Perkins, Master Elton, Master Dod, Master Downham, with sundry others on the seventh Commandement , who concurre with the alleaged Fathers in the lacivious filthinesse of Play- acting; We must needs acknowledge the very acting of Stage-playes, to be necessarily obscene, and so unlawfull unto Christians, as they all conclude. Secondly, those severall meretricious amorous passages, ditties parts, and complements which we meet with both in ancient and moderne Play-poems, (which can neither be acted nor vttered without much obscenity,) will evidently evince the very acting of Playes to be lascivious. And doth not daily experience testifie as much? Survay we but a whiles, those venemous unchaste, incestuous kisses , (as the Fathers stile them:) those wanton dalliances, those meretricious imbracements, complements; those enchanting, powerfull, overcomming sollicitations unto lewdnesse; those immodest gestures, speeches, attires, which inseparably accompany the acting of our Stage-playes; especially where the Bawdes, the Panders, the Lovers, the Wooers, the Adulterers, the Womans, or Love-sicke persons parts are lively represented, (whose poysonous filthinesse, I dare not fully anatomize. for feare it should infect, not mend the Reader ,) must needs at first acknowledge, the very action of our Stage-playes to be execrably obscene; to be such as none but persons desparately lewde, unchaste, immodest, can seriously affect, much lesse approve or act. Therefore Stage-playes themselves must questionlesse be abominable unto Christians, even in this regard: Thirdly, as the hypocrisie, and obscenity, even so the effeminacy of acting Stage-playes, doth manifestly evince them to be evill; as this eighteenth Argument will demonstrate. That whose very action is effeminate, must needs be unlawfull unto Christians. But the very action of Stage-playes is effeminate. Therefore, it musts needs be unlawfull unto Christians; The major is evident, by the authority of Scriptures , Fathers and other Authors who condemne effeminacie, as an unnaturall, odious, shamefull , sinne which not only mis- beseemes all Christians, all persons whatsoever making them vile and detestable unto others, but likewise shuts men out of heaven, and without repentance damnes thir soules. The Minor is ratified by the concurrent suffrages of sundry Fathers, who for this very cause among divers others, condemne all Stage-playes: Witnesse Clemens Alexandrinus, P aedagogi lib . 2. cap . 10. Where he stiles Players effeminate enervated dancers, & Padagog. lib. 3. cap. 3. where he writes thus. Now verily the intemperance of life is growne so excessive, iniquity insulting and sporting it selfe, that what soever is lascivious and unchaste, is diffused into Cities. Boyes being taught to deny nature, doe counterfeit the female Sex, &c. O miserable spectacle! O horrible wicked excercise! O how great is this iniquity! &c. Witnesse Philo Iud aeus. De Vita Contemplativa, P . 1209, 1210. Those (writes he) who onely please with scurrilous jests to recreate mens mindes , transforme youthes into the very habit and order of Strumpets, to the great injury and dishonour of their age and sexe: a thing which Moses doth much condemne . Witnesse Tertullian De Spectaculis, lib. c . 10. p . 17. Together with Isiodor Hispalensis. Originum lib . 18. cap . 51. In all scenicall arts (say they) there is plainely the patronage of Bacchus and Venus which are peculiarly proper to the Stage. From the gesture and flexure of the body, they sacrifice effeminacy to Venus and Bacchus; the one of them being effeminate by her sexe, the other by his flux, &c. Witnesse Saint Cyprian, De spectaculis lib . where he writes thus. To this vile shamefull deed, another equall wickednesse is super-added. A man enfeebled in all his joynts, resolved into a more than womanish effeminacy, whose art it is to speake with his hands and gestures, comes forth upon the Stage: and for this one, I know not whom, neither man nor woman, the whole Citie flocke together, that so the fabulous lusts of antiquity may be acted. Yea , men (writes he in another place) are unmanned on the Stage: all the honour and vigour of their sex is effeminated with the shame, the dishonesty of an unsinued body. He who is most womanish and best resembles the female sex, gives best content. The more criminous, the more applauded is he; and by how much the more obscene he is, the more skilfull is he accounted. What cannot he perswade who is such a one? &c. And in another Epistle of his, he writes to Eucratius, to Excommunicate a Player , who did traine up Boyes for the Stage , for that he taught them against the expresse instruction of God himselfe, how a male might be effeminated into a female, how their sex might be changed by Art, that so the divell who defiles Gods workemanship, might be pleased by the offences of a depraved and effeminated body. I thinke it will not stand with the Majestie of God, nor the discipline of the Gospel, that the modestie and honour of the Church should be polluted with such a filthy and infamous contagion. For since men are prohibited in the Law to put on a womans garment, and such who doe it are adjudged accursed. How much more greater a sinne is it, not onely to put on womans apparell, but likewise to expresse obscene effeminate womanish gestures, by the skill or tutorship of an unchaste Art? The most unchaste gestures and actions of Stage-players (writes Lactantius ) what else doe they but teach and provoke lust? whose enervated bodies, effeminated into an womanish pace and habit, resemble unchaste women by their dishonest gestures, &c. One being a Youth (writes Saint Chrysostome, combes backe his haire, and effeminating nature with his visage his apparell, his gesture, and the like, strives to represent the person of a tender virgin : which he condemnes as a most abominable effeminate act: There is another sort of Actors (writes Nazianzen) more unhappy then these to wit those who lose the glory of men, and by unchaste infections of their members, effeminate their manly nature, being both effeminate men and women, yea, being neither men nor women, if we will speake truely. For they continue not men and that they should become women, they attaine not. For what they are by nature that they continue not, in regard of manners: and that which they wickedly desire to be, that they are not by nature. By which it commeth to passe, that they are certaine riddles of luxurie, and intricacies of vices, being men among women, and women among men. Whether doe these things rather deserve applauses, aspections and mirth, or teares and sighes? Uerily laughter raignes in these; Nature is vitiated and adulterated, and a various flame of pleasures is kindled.

Of Bishop Babington, Master Perkins, Master Dod , Master Lakes, Master Downeham, and sundry other on the seventh Commandement. yea, of Plato, Cicero, Senica , Tacitus , Iuvenall, Marcus Aurelius , Iuvenall Plinie , and other Pagan Authors; who all with one consent, not onely testifie, but likewise positively condemne the grosse, the execrable effeminacy which attends the acting of all Stageplayes; which the very Cynicke himselfe would blush for to behold . And must not our owne experience beare witnesse of the invirillity of Play-acting? May we not daily see our Players metamorphosed into women on the Stage, not only by putting on the female robes, but likewise the effeminate gestures, speeches, pace, behaviour, attire, delicacy, passions, manners, arts and wiles of the female sex, yea, of the most petulant, unchaste, insinuating Strumpets, that either Italy or the world affords ? What wantonnesse, what effeminacy parallell to that which our men-women actors, in all their feminine, (yea, sometime in their masculine parts) expresse upon the Theater? was ever the invirility of Nero, Heliogabalus, or Sardanapalus , those Monsters, if not shames of Men and Nature: was ever the effeminate lewdnesse of Flora or Thais , comparable unto that which our artificiall Stage-players (trayned up to all lasciviousnesse from their Cradles) continually practise on the Stage, without blush of face, or sorrow of heart, not onely in the open view of men, but even of that all-eyed God , who will one day arraigne them for this their grosse effeminacie? And dare wee men, wee Christians yet applaud it? Pitty is it to consider, how many ingenuous , witty, comely youthes, devoted vnto God in baptisme , to whom they owe themselves, their service; are oft-times by their gracelesse Parents, even wholy consecrated to the stage, (the Divels Chappell , as the Fathers phrase it) where they are trained up in the Schoole of Uice , the Play-house, (as if their natures were not prone enough to sinne, unlesse they had the helpe of art to backe them) to the very excesse of all effeminacy, to act those womanish, whorish parts, which Pagans would even blush to personate. And is this a laudable, as many; a triviall, veniall, harmelesse thing, as most repute it ? Is this a light, a despicable effeminacie, for men, for Christians, thus to adulterate, emasculate, metamorphose, and debase their noble sexe? thus purposely, yea, affectedly, to vnman, vnchristian, vncreate themselves, if I may so speake, and to make themselves, as it were, neither men nor women, but Monsters, ( a sin as bad, nay worse than any adultery, offering a kinde of violence to Gods owne worke ,) and all to no other end but this; to exhilerate a confluence of unchaste, effeminate, vaine companions, or to become competent Actors on a Stage; the greatest infamy that could befall an ancient Pagan Roman, or a Christian ? Is this a meane, a pardonable wickednesse, to violate the Lawes of God, of Nature? to educate those in the very discipline and schoole of Satan, whe should be trained vp in the admonition, feare, and nurture of the Lord ? that so they may be more deepely enthralled to the Devils bondage all their dayes, (since custome is another nature , it being as difficult a thing for such who are accustomed to evill, to doe good, as for an Æthiopian to change his skin, or a Leopard his spots ,) and be made more sure partakers with him in his eternall torments at their deathes? O therefore let vs now at last consider with our selves, the execrable effeminacy which attends the very acting of our Stage-playes; together with the danger accompanying this sinne, (which is no lesse , without repentance, then the eternall losse of heavers ;) and then we shall, we cannot but abhorre all Stage-playes, even in this regard. Fourthly, as the grosse effeminacie, even so the palpable vanitie, the ridiculous folly of acting Playes; doth manifest them to be evill; as this nineteenth Play-affronting Argument will evince. That whose very action, in its best acception, is but ridiculous folly and vanity, must certainly be vnseemely, yea, unlawfull unto Christians. But such is the very action of Stage-playes. Therefore, they must certainly be unseemely, and unlawfull unto Christians. The Major is evident: First, because the Scriptures condemne all vanity, and follie ; together with all vaine, all foolish actions, persons, speeches, words, gestures, as dangerous, and pernicious evils , which draw men by degrees to greater sinnes , to serious mischiefes ; commanding men with all not to returne againe to folly , there being wickedness and madnesse in it , to abandon folly and vanities, which promote not the eternall beatitude of their soules : to depart from the presence of a foolish man, when as they perceive not in him the lips of knowledge . Secondly, because vanitie and folly are the very matter, seminaries, and seeds of sinne, of wickednesse , there being nothing worse then they. The Minor, as it is evident by the concurrent testimony of the fore-quoted Fathers, Acts 3. Scene 7. so it is such an experimentall knowne truth, that it were lost labour for to prove it. For what else is the personating of the Clownes, the Fooles, the Fantastickes, the Lovers, the Distracted, discontented, lascivious, furious, angry persons part, but professed vanitie, or ridiculous affected folly? Yea, what else is the whole action of Playes, but well personated vanity , artificiall folly, or a lesse Bedlam frenzie [illeg.] He who shall seriously survay the ridiculous, childish, inconsiderate, yea, mad and beastly actions, gestures, speeches, habits, prankes and fooleries of Actors on the Stage , (if he be not childish, foolish, or frentique himselfe) must needs deeme all Stage-players children, fooles, or Bedlams ; since they act such parts, such pranks, yea, use such gestures, speeches, rayment, complements, and behaviour in Iest, which none but children, fooles, or mad-men, doe act, or vse in earnest. There is no difference at all betweene a foole, a fantastique, a Bedlam , a Whore, a Pander, a Cheater, a Tyrant, a Drunkard, a Murtherer, a Divell on the Stage (for his part is oft- times acted) and those who are such in truth, but that the former are farre worse, farre more inexcusable than the latter, because they wilfully make themselves that in sport, to foment the more then childish folly, of some vaine Spectators , which these others are, perchance from naturall necessity, or at least from colourable grounds? Flendas dixerim, an ridendas ineptias ? The foolery, the ridiculousnesse of acting Playes is such, that I know not whether men should more bewaile it, or deride it. Sure I am, though few Spectators can finde teares to deplore the sinfulnesse, yet most of them can afford laughter to deride the vanity, the folly of acting Playes. Since therefore vanitie and folly are the genuine proper objects of derision, and mens voluptuous smiles ; the laughter Playes occasion, (which is their chiefest end,) is a sufficient evidence of their excessive folly; and so ground enough for Christians, for all men to condemne them as vanities, as fooleries, as Clemens Alexandrinus , and other Fathers doe at large declare. And thus much for the first considerable thing in the manner of acting Stage- playes. The second circumstance considerable in the forme of acting Playes, is the severall parts and persons sustained in them: which suggests this twentieth Play-oppugning Argument. Those Playes, whose very parts and persons are sinfull, yea, abominable, are certainly unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians. But such are the parts, the persons most frequent in all Stage-playes. Therefore they are certainly unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians. The Maior is irrefragable, because such as the parts are, such is the whole, which is composed of them : If the parts then be evill, the intiretie that springs out of them must bee such. The Minor I shall evidence by this Induction. In all our Stage-playes, we have most vsually the parts and persons of Divel-gods and Goddesses; of Iupiter, Mars, Apollo, Venus, Vulcan, Saturne, Cupid, Neptune, Mercurie, Esculapius, Hercules, Pluto, Bacchus, Ceres, Minerva, Diana, Iuno, Proserpina, Flora, Priapus , and others: yea, sometimes the very part and person of the Divell himselfe ; whose workes, whose pompes and vanities all Christians have renounced in their Baptisme: Adde we to these, the parts and representations of Satyres, Silvanes, Muses, Nymphes, Furies, Hobgoblins, Fairies, Fates , with such other heathen vanities, which Christians should not name, much lesse resemble ; Together with the parts, the person, of Whores, Whoremasters, Adulterers, Bawdes, Panders, Tyrants, Traitors, Theeves, Murtherers, Paricides; Drunkards, Parasites, Prodigals, Hypocrites, Fooles, Ruffians, Wooers, Epicures, Fantastiques, Pennie-Fathers, Vsurers, Scolds, Drabbes, Ravishers, Wantons, Bedlams, Turkes, Infidels, and all other desperate wicked persons whatsoever. There is scarce one Divell in Hell, hardly a notorious sinne or sinner upon earth, either of moderne or ancient times, but hath some part or other in Stage-playes. And can they then be lawfull, be tollerable unto Christians, being consarcinated of such polluted parts and persons as these? Doubtlesse, he who will but cordially, but Christianly survay those filthy Pagan Divel-gods and Goddesses; those outragious beastly lusts, unparalleld abominations, and execrable sinners, which have their Acts, their Scenes, their Parts, in Stage-playes; must necessarily abandon Playes, ( as all ancient Christions did) as pastimes more fit for Devils than for Christians : else hee must needs justifie, not onely sinne and sinners, but even Hell it selfe; which abounds not with more polluted Deuils, and Devill- Idols ; with more prodigious Monsters of impietie, with more stupendious matchlesse villanies, than the Stage , whose wickednesse oft-times, transcends even that of the infernall Lake. For there, men onely suffer and bewaile with teares, the eternall tortures which their sinnes occasion: Whereas men in Theaters, are so farre from sinne-lamenting sorrow, that they even delight themselves with the representations of those wickednesses, which the originall Authors of them now deplore in Hell. And is not this a desperate matchlesse madnesse , for men, for Christians, to sport themselves with those individuall sinnes upon the Stage, which the parties acted in the very bitternesse of their soules, are condoling now in Hell? To make that their chiefest earthly pleasure, which is now the damned acted parties greatest paine, and without repentance may prove theirs too? To raise up damned soules or Devils out of Hell; with all those horrid sinnes that sunke them thither, to no other end but this, to play them on the Stage for laughter-sake: and yet never cordially to consider the dolefull condition of the persons , nor seriously to lament the damnablenesse, the eternall punishment of the sinnes thus acted in their sight? O that our Players, our Play-haunters would now seriously consider, that the persons whose parts, whose sinnes they act and see, are even then yelling in the eternall flames of hell , for these particular sinnes of theirs, even then whiles they are playing of these sinnes, these parts of theirs on the Stage! O that they would now remember the sighes, the groanes, the teares , the anguish, weeping, and gnashing of teeth, the cryes, and shreekes , that these wickednesses cause in Hell, whiles they are acting, applauding, committing and laughing at them in the Play-house! And this, if there be any Sparke of humanity, of Christianitie; any feare of God, of Sinne, of Hell, remaining in them; would soone embitter the most Sugred Stage-playes to their soules, and engage them to detest them (unlesse they are marked out for Hell) for such like torments as these now sustaine. Certainely, he can never have a share in Heaven, that makes a mocke, a Play, a Pastime of the Parts, the Sins of those Devils, Pagans, and flagitious persons who are now in Hell. He who can thus make Sinne, or Hell, or Devils, his earthly solase here , shall undoubtedly enjoy no other Heaven but Hell hereafter . Let the consideration therefore of these parts, these persons sustained in our Stage- playes, perswade us to renounce them, as mis-beseeming Christians to sport themselves withall ; From whose hearts they should rather draw mournfull teares, than foolish laughter. The third thing considerable in the very action of Stage-playes, is the apparell in which they are acted, which is first of all womanish and effeminate, belonging properly to to the femall sex; therefore unlawfull, yea, abominable unto men. From whence this twenty one Argument is deducible. These Playes wherein men act any womens parts in womans apparell, must needs be sinfull, yea, abominable unto Christians. But in all, or at least in most Stage-playes whatsoever, men act the parts of women in womans apparell . Therefore they must needs be sinfull, yea, abominable vnto Christians. The Minor is a notorious experimentall truth which all Players, all Play- haunters must acknowledge: which sundry Fathers, and approved moderne Authors testifie. The Maior is undeniably confirmed by Deuteronomie 22. verse 5 . The Woman shall not weare that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a womans garment; for all that doe so, are abomination to the Lord thy God . God himselfe doth here expresly inhibit men to put on womans apparell, because it is an abomination to him: therefore it must certainly be unlawfull, yea abominable for Players to put on such apparell to act a womans part. If any here object (as some Play-patrons doe ) that this Scripture extends to those alone, who usually clothe themselues in womans array from day to day; or to those who put it on with a lewde intent to circumvent or inamor others: or to satisfie their lusts: in which case the Synode of Augusta inhibits women, who put on mans apparell, from the Sacrament, till they have repented : not to such who only weare it now and then to act a womans part, or in case of necessity to saue their liues , as some haue done. To this I answer; First, that sundry common Actors doe usually once a day, at leastwise twice or thrice a weeke, attire themselues in womens array to act their female parts; yea, they make a daily practice of it to put on womens attire, it being inseparably incident to their lewde profession: therefore they are within the expresse condemnation of this Scripture, and their owne most fauourable glosse vpon it, as the obiection it selfe doth euidence. Secondly, the very putting on of womans apparell to act a Play, though it be but now and then for an houre or two, is directly condemned by this Scripture : which prohibits, not onely the frequent wearing, but the very putting on of womens apparell, for the words are not: A man shall not ordinarily or frequently put on a womans garment,nor yet weare it now and then to a lewde intent , as the Obiectors glosse it : but, Neither shall a man put on a womans garment . The originall word Iilbosch , which signifieth to put on: is the very same (as two Worthies of our Church obserue ) with that of the 1 Sam .17.38,39. where it is written; that Savl clothed then Dauid in the Scripture phrase, were said to put on Savls Armor , though he put it off immediately , because he had it once upon him, though for a little space; then he who puts on a womans rayment but to act a part, though it be but once, is doubtlesse a putter on of womens apparell , within the very litterall meaning of this Scripture; and so a ground delinqvent against God: because the very putting on of a womans garment, not the frequent or long wearing of it, is the thing this text condemnes, as the word put on imports. Thirdly, the very reason of this precept expressed in the text, will take off this evasion: The woman shall not weare that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a womans garment : marke the reason. For all that doe so, are abomination to the Lord thy God . That which makes a man an abomination to the Lord his God, must be such a thing as is sinfull and abominable in its owne nature, not in its abuse or circumstances onely , as the Scriptures , and Alexander Alesius testifie: If a mans putting on of womans apparell were not simply euill in it selfe, the frequent wearing of it, or the putting of it on to a sinister intent, could not make him an abomination vnto God. For the vse of apparell being to clothe and adorne the body ; if the putting on of it were not vnlawfull, the frequent putting on of it, being the true vse of it, could not bee sinfull, and so not abominable; there being nothing odious vnto God but sinne, and sinfull things . Since then this putting on of womans apparell is an abomination to the Lord: not onely the frequent wearing of it, or the putting of it on to lewde intents, but euen the bare putting of it on to act a vicious Play, though it be but once , must needs be within the verge of this sacred inhibition. Fourthly, this precept; Neither shall a man put on a womans garment, as it is a branch of the morall law, hauing a relation to the 7. Commandement , and to seueral Scriptures in the New Testament, concerning modesty and decency in apparell: as good Diuines obserue. So it is a vniuersall negatiue, which by the rules of Theologie bindes all men, in all cases, in all places, both Semper & ad Semper; alwayes, and at all times whatsoeuer [illeg.] therefore a man putting on of womens apparell at any time vpon any occasion (yea in case of sauing life, as some affirme) but especially to act a Bawdes,a Sorceresses, Whores, or any other lewde females part vpon the Stage; must vndoubtedly be within the expresse letter of this universall negative text; and so an abomination to the Lord. Neither will this poore evasion of acting in womans apparell but now and then, take off its guilt; For since mens putting on of such aray is here prohibited by a negative precept, which bindes at all times, as an abomination to the Lord , and a thing that is sinfull in its owne nature; the rarity of it can no wayes expiate the sinfulnesse that is in it. That which is sinfull in it selfe, is no where, no time lawfull vpon no occasion . It is no iustification, no excuse at all for a Murtherer, an Adulterer, Swearer, Lier, Theefe, Drunkard, or the like, to pleade, that he commits these sinnes but seldome upon some special causes because Gods precepts are so strict, that they allow no place, no time for any finne . The infrequency, the rarenesse then of wearing womans apparell (suppose it were as rare vpon the Stage as now it is common) addes nothing to its lawfulnesse, it still continues an abomination to the Lord. Fiftly, admit it were lawful for a man to put on womas apparell to saue his life, or to avoid some imminent danger, as Achtlles Euclis , William Bp.of Ely , with, some few others ,  & the Tyrr[illeg.]eneans are recorded to haue done , though S. Augustine himselfe makes a Quare of its lawfulnesse euen in case of life, and others determine it to be unlawfull, it being a negative morall precept which admits no qualifications ; yet it followes not hence, that therefore it is lawfull for Men-actors to put on womens aray to act a Play: For doubtlesse if it be abominable in any case, or in case of daily use, as all acknowledge; it must necessarily bee so in case of acting Playes, which are but a meere abuse . For first, Playes themselues, at leastwise the personating of the Bawdes, Adulteresses, Whores, or Sorceresses part, which sauour of nought else but lewdnesse and effeminacy, are euill: therefore the very putting on of womans apparell to act such parts, cannot be good . Secondly, Playes, and female parts in Playes, admit they bee not simply euill, yet they are but meere superfluous vanities ; or Abuses , as some rightly stile them, there is no necessary vse of Playes, of womens parts in Playes, or of acting female parts in womens apparell. For men therefore to put on womans attire contrary to this sacred precept, to act a lewde lasciuious womans part out of a meere effeminate, vaine, lasciuious humour, there being no urgent necessity, no warrantable occasion so to doe, must needs be a great abomination , a most apparant violation of this ample precept; which being in it selfe exceeding broad, as all Gods precepts are , must alwayes be taken in its utmost latitude, without any humane restrictions of our owne; since God himselfe (who can onely make exceptions out of his owne generall rules) hath left us no evasion from it in his Word. Sixtly, the concurrent testimony of sundry Councels, Fathers,  & moderne Authors, do absolutely condemne mens putting on of womans apparell, (and so e conuerso) especially to act a part vpon the Stage, as an abominable, unnaturall, effeminate and dishonest thing. Hence the ancient Councell of Eliberis, Canon . 57. decreed, That Matrons, or their Husbands should not lend their clothes to set forth any secular Playes or Shewes; and if any did it, that they should be excommunicated for three yeares space . If then the very lending of womens apparell to act a Play in, were so great a crime as to demerit 3.yeeres excommunication , what doth a Players personating of a womans part in such aray deserue? The Councell of Gangra in the yeere of our Lord 324. Can. 13.  & 17\. decreed; That if any woman under pretence of chastity, or piety, as was supposed, should change her habit, and put on mans apparell; or clip and poll her haire (as our shorne English Viragoes doe of late) which God had giuen her as a badge of her subiection; she should be anathematized, as a dissolver of the precept of obedience : it being directly contrary to this text of Deuteronomy: The woman shall not weare that which pertaineth to the man, &c . and to the 1 Cor. 10. 6, 15. It is a shame for a woman to be shauen or shorne: but if she haue long haire, it is a glory unto her, for her haire is giuen her for a couering . Indeed I finde some precedents of women, who haue beene peccant in this kinde: As namely, some seduced female disciples of Eustatius, who polled their heads. and clad themselues in mans apparell, under a pretext of piety; for the redresse of whose enormous mannish courses this very Councell was assembled. A Virgin, of whom S . Ambrose speakes, who clothed her selfe in mans array to save her chastity, and so escaped. Laschonia and Axiothea, who resorted unto Plato his Schoole in mans attire. Empona the renowned wife of Iulius Sabinus, who polled her haire, and disguised her selfe in mans apparell, and so went to Rome, the better to conceale her Husband, whose life was then indangered. Euphrosina, a famous Virgin of Alexandria, who under a pretence of chastity, did cut her haire, and put on mans array, and so entred into a Monastery, where she continued thus disguised for 38\. yeeres space. The famous Maide of Burgundie, in the yeere 1225. who polling her head, and apparelling her selfe in masculine garments, of purpose to preserue her virginity, her Father being desirous to bestow her in marriage, entred into religion in a Monastery of the Friers Minorities, where she lived thus metamorphosed into a Monke, for divers yeeres . Pope Ione that masculine Roman Strumpet of knowne infamy, who transforming her selfe into the habit and tonsure of a man, repaired in this her disguize unto the University, where she lived many yeeres; and at last she aspired into the very Popes unerring Throne, by this her masculine habit and tonsure, as a man; till her unepected delivery of a base-borne issue in the very middest of her solemne procession, discried her to be a woman. A notable Damsell of Corinth, together with Metania and Marina, who under pretext of vowing virginity, and preserving their chastity, disguised themselues in mans apparell, and so entred into Monasteries, as professed Monkes , the better to satisfie their lusts among those Gotish shavelings . Puell de Dieu, that notable French Virago, who arrayed her selfe like a man, and turned a great Commander in the Wars, till at last she was taken prisoner by the English in the field, attired and armed like a man; for which unnaturall act of hers, she was condemned and burnt at Roan. The Whore apprehended in Suffolke, in King Henry the VIII. his Raigne, by M . Wharton, who being disguised in mans apparell, was taken in the company of foure Popish shaveling Priests, good Curates; who one after another had bestowed their chastity upon her . All which for this their mannish immodest attyring themselues in mans accovtrements, incur the execration of this text and Councell. If then a womans putting on, or wearing of mans apparell, or the imitation of his tonsure incurres an Anathema by this Councels doome, though chastity, learning, and devotion were pretended for it: doth not a mans attyring himselfe in womans vestments, of purpose to act an effeminate lascivious, amorous Strumpets part upon the Stage, much more demerit it, since there can be no good pretext at all for it? But to come punctually to our purpose. The 6. generall Councell of Constantinople, Canon 62 . expresly prohibits and abandons all daun ces and mysteries made in the names of those who were falsly stiled gods among the Gr aecians, or in the name of men or women, after the ancient manner, farre differing from the life of Christians: ordaining, that no man should from thence-forth put on a womans garment, nor no woman a mans apparell; and that no man should put on the person or visard of a Comedian, a Satyrist, or a Tragaedian, under paine of deposition, if a Clergie-man; of excommunication, if a Laicke . This is punctuall. Philo , a learned Iew, records; That the law doth study to exercise and confirme mens mindes io fortitude with so great earnestnesse, that it also giues precepts what garments must be used, expresly prohibiting, that the man should not take vnto him womans apparell, lest the shadow or footsteps of effeminacy, should stamp some blemish on the masculine sex. For by following nature, he doth alwayes obserue what is seemely euen in the smallest things, which might seeme to be below the care of a Law-giver. For when he considered that the bodies of men and women were deformed, and that both of them had their distinct offices; that to the one of them the care of domestique businesses was committed to the other the mannaging of publike affaires, and that by nature her selfe they were not both made for the same imployments , and that a good minde ought to follow the instructions of nature, he thought it fit to determine of these things also, to wit, of food and rayment, and other things of this nature: For he would that a man in these things should so demeane himselfe as a man ought to doe, especially in apparell; which since he carrieth it about with him night and day, it ought to be such as may alwayes admonish him both of comlinesse and honesty: So also adorning the woman according to her degree, he forbids her to weare a mans garment; remouing far both effeminate men, and women more manly then is fit . Clemens Alexandrinus, as he condemnes the putting on of womans apparell as a great iniquity ; so he demands this question; Why the law in this very text of Deuteronomy did inhibit a man to put on a womans garment ? and he resolves it thus; Because the law would have us to be man, and not to be effeminate neither in body, nor in deeds, nor in minde, nor in words . Which reason doth more especially hold in case of Playes, where our Men-women Actors are most effeminate, both in apparell, body, words, and workes. Tertullian obserues; that no kinde of rayment as he could finde was accursed of God, but womens apparell worne by men; for God saith, Cursed is every man who is clad in womans aray. Therefore (writes hee) when as God prescribes in his law, that he is accursed who is clothed in womans apparell; what will be iudge of the Stage- player, Clowne or Foole in the Play, who is attired in womans apparell? Shall this Crafts-master, this cheating Companion, thinke you, goe unpunished ? S. Cyprian writes expresly in his Epistle to Everatius ; That men in the law are prohibited to put on a womans garment, and those who doe it are adiudged accursed: how much greater a crime is it then, not onely to put on womans apparell, but likewise to expresse dishonest, effeminate, womanish gestures, by the tutorship or direction of an unchaste art ? Which passage he particularly applies to Stage-playes. Lactantius , among other things, taxeth Players, for putting on womanish gestures, and apparell, to act the parts of infamous females : hauing an eye, no question, to this text of Deutronomy. Epiphanius Contra H aereses. lib. 2. Tom. 2. Haeresis 66. Col. 543. B. informes us : That it is a shamefull and dishonest thing for a man to become a woman, and to appeare in the forme of a woman. And that it is againe a most abominable thing for women to become men , (as many of haire-clipping moderne impudent Viragoes doe) and to weare the apparell of a man . Whence he condemnes the Seres for Heretiques; among whom the men did vse to nourish and plaite their haire into knots like women , (as our moderne Love-locke wearers doe) sitting all the day idlely at home, perfumes with oyntments, effeminate, and prepared for their wiues; where as their women on the other side,did cut the haire of their heads , (as our English Man-women monsters doe of late) and gird themselues about with a mans girdle : both which are condemned by this text of Deuternomy : and by the 1 Cor.11. v. 3. to 15 . which I would our moderne Ruffians, and Mad-dames would consider. Gregory Nazianzen, Oratio. 1. ad Eunomianos , together with Elias, Metropolitan of Crete , in his Commentary on that Oration; affirme, That it is an unnaturall and disorderly thing to see flowers in winter, or women clothed in mans, or men attired in womens apparell. For (as Elias comments) the first of these disturbes the times; the other yeelds an inconvenient forme to nature, the ornament both of the man and woman being changed, and the order which nature hath prescribed to them, being confounded . Vpon which ground they both condemne the Cynicke Maximus, and his sect , for nourishing and wearing their haire long, out of a perverse affection : as being an effeminate, and unnaturall thing. S. Hierom writes expresly; That he shall eternally perish who being effeminated in womannish feeblenesse, doth nourish his haire, pollish his skin, and trim himselfe by the glasse, which is the proper passion and madnesse of women. S. Cyprian records, That they are in the Devils House and Palace, who with womanish haire transfigure themselues into women, and disgrace their masculine dignity, not without the iniurie of nature .

Doth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man hath long haire (in which our Ruffians glory) it is a shame unto him? But if a woman haue long haire , (Of which our English Ladies , who haue cast off God and nature, shame and modesty, religion and subiection, are now ashamed , as being out of fashion) it is a glory to her; for her haire is giuen her for a covering: ) doe copiously censure and condemne the frizling, nourishing, and wearing of long effeminate haire, as an unnaturall, womanish, irreligious, and unmanly practice condemned, not onely by the Law of God and nature, in the 1 Cor. 11.14. Ezech .44.20. Levit .19.27.  & 21.5. Dan . 4.33. Rev .9.7.8.1 Tim .2.9.1 Pet .3.3. Isay 3.24 (which Scriptures I would our overgrowne Lock-wearers, and frizle-pated men-women would well consider) But euen by this text of Deuteronomy, which inhibits men to put on a womans garment, or attire ; of which long haire ( the proper ornaments of women ) as well as womans rayment is a part. If then the very nourishing of long effeminate haire be a putting on of womans apparell within this Scriptures sence , as the womans cutting of her haire (as Good Expositors testifie) is a wearing of that which pertaineth to a man, to whom the clipping of haire is proper , he being in this distinguished from a woman : and so an abomination in Gods sight , though our men and women in these licentious times beleeue the contrary; Much more must a Players putting on of womens apparell, gesture, speech, and manners to act a Play, be a putting on of womans apparell, and so an abomination to the Lord our God , within the very litterall meaning of this text, if these fore-quoted Fathers may be iudged. S. Ambrose in his Annotations upon Deuteronomy. cap . 22. dedicated to Iren aeus : Wherein he examines at large the cause, why the law should prohibit women to weare a mans garment, and men to put on womans apparell ; will make this point most cleare. I shall recite his words at large. Thou hast informed me (writes he) as a sonne, that some haue demanded of thee, what is the reason, that the law should so severely call them uncleane, who use the garments of another sex, be they men or women. For thus it is written , The apparell of the man shall not be put upon the woman, neither shall a man be arrayed in a womans garment; because every one who shall doe these things, is an abomination to the Lord thy God. And if thou maist truely discusse it; that is incongruous, which even nature her selfe abborreth. For why being a man, wilt thou not seeme to be that which thou art borne? why dost thou take unto thy selfe a different forme? Why dost thou feine thy selfe a woman, or thou woman thy selfe to be a man? Nature hath clothed every sex with its owne garments. Finally, there is a diverse use, a different colour, motion, pace, an unequall strength , a different voice in a man and in a woman. Yea likewise in living creatures of another kinde, there is one forme of a Lion, another of a Lionesse, yea another strength, another sound: one of a Bull another of a Heifer. In Deere also, so much as the sex doth differ, so much doth the forme, so as thou maist distinguish them afar off. In Birds likewise there may be a proper comparison, in regard of apparell betweene them and man. For in them the very induments themselues doe by nature distinguish the sex. The male Peacockes are beautifull; the females are not adorned with so various a beauty of feathers. The Phesants also haue a different colour, which may distinguish the difference of the sex. What difference is there in Poultry? How shrill is the crowing of the Cocke, a solemne gift to stir up and sing, in the severall watches of the night ? Doe these things change their shape or habit? Why then doe we desire to change? And verily the custome of the Grecians hath flowne in among us, that women weare short coates, as being shorter then their owne. Well, be it so now, that these may seeme to imitate the nature of the better sex; why will men counterfeit the habit of the inferiour sex? A lie even in word is dishonest: much more in apparell . Finally, in Temples, where there is a counterfeiting of faith, there is a counterfeiting of nature: For men there to take unto them womans apparell, and a womanish behaviour, is thought an holy thing. Whence the Law saith: Because every one, who shall doe these things, is an abomination to the Lord thy God: that is, a man who shall put on a womans garment. But I suppose, that it speakes this, not so much of cloathes, as of manners, or of our customes and actions, wherein one act may become a man, another a woman. Whence also the Apostle saith, as an interpreter of the Law , Let the woman keepe silence in the Chruch: For it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be in subiection, as the Law saith. But if they will learne any thing, they may aske their Husbands at home. And to Timothy , Let the woman learne in silence with all subjection: for I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to domineere over her Husband. But how unseemely a thing is it for a man to doe womanish workes? Therefore also may they bring forth children, therefore may they travell of child-birth, who crispe their haire like women. And yet those are veiled, these make war. But they may haue an excuse who follow the customes of their Country, which yet are barbarous, as the Persians, as the Goathes, as the Armenians. Verily nature is greater then our Country. What doe we speake of others, who adde this to their luxury, that they keepe in their service men wearing frizled haire, and golden chaines, themselues having long beards, their servants long shag haire? Deservedly chastity is not there kept, where a distinction of sex is not observed . In which the euidences of nature, are so many tutorships; the Apostle himselfe saying : Is it a seemely thing, that a woman pray unto God uncovered? Doth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man have long haire, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long haire, it is a glory to her, for her haire is given her for a covering. These are the things which thou maist answer to those who inquire of thee. Farewell . Thus doth this Father descent on this Scripture. S. Augustine resolves us; That those are rightly accounted infamous, and unable to beare witnesse, who shew themselves in womans apparell, whom I know not whether I should rather call, false women, or false men. Yet we may stile them true Stage-players, and true infamous persons without any doubt. And withal he informes us , that it is a great Questio, whether a man may put on womans apparell, to deceive an enemy with it, for the delivery, or safety of his Country, because in this he becomes a woman, perchance to appeare a truer man. And whether a wise man, who hath some kinde of assurance that his life will be necessary for the good of men, would rather die with cold, then clothe himselfe in womans apparell, if he can get no other. But of this (saith he) we shall consider more in another place. For verily thou seest how much examination it requires, to consider how far these things ought to be proceeded in, lest men fall into certaine unexcusable uncleannesses . And so he leaues the Question undecided. Iulius Firmicus Maternus, De Errore Profanarum Religionum, lib c. 4. Bibl. Patrum. Tom. 4. p . 108. 109. writing of the effeminate Sodomiticall Male-Priests of Venus, who clad themselues in womans apparell , and were afterwards put to death by Constantine the Great for their unnaturall lewdnesse, as Eusebius (De Vita Constantini, lib. 3. cap. 53. & lib. 4. cap. 25. ) records: hath this notable passage. The Assyrians, who worship the Aire under the name of Venus, haue verily effeminated this Element, being moved I know not with what Veneration. Whether because the Aire is interposed betweene the Sea and Heaven, doe they worship it with the effeminate voyces of their Priests ? Tell me, is this the cause that they seeke a woman in a man, whom the Quire of their Priests cannot otherwise serve, vnlesse they effeminate their countenance, polish their skin, and disgrace their masculine sex with womanish attire, &c? They effeminately adorne their long nourished haire, and being clothed in delicate garments, they scarce support their head with their wearied necke. Afterwards, when they have thus estranged themselves from being men, ravished with the musicke of Pipes they call upon their Goddesse, &c. What Monster, or what Prodigy is this? They deny themselves to be men, and yet are such: They would be reputed women, but the quality of their body confesseth the contrary. Consider what deity it is which is thus delighted with the entertainment of an impure body, which adheres to unchaste members, which is attoned with the filthy pollution of the body. Blush O ye wretches, at your sottishnesse: another God hath made you! When your company shall appeare before the Tribunall of God who iudgeth, you shall bring nothing along with you, which God, who hath made you, may acknowledge. Cast away this error of so great calamity, and now at last relinquish the practices of a prophane mind. Doe not ye damne that body which God hath given you, with the wicked law of the Devill . So pathetically inveighed he against mens putting on of womens apparell. S. Chrysostome , as hee expresly condemnes the putting on of womans array to act a play ; a thing too common in his dayes: So in his 26. Hom[illeg.]l. in Epist. 1. ad Corinth[illeg.]os, cap . 11. Tom 4\. Col . 453. B.C . (where he recites this Text of Deuteronomy , and notably censures men for nourishing ,  & women for cutting and laying out their haire ;) he hath this excellent speech. There are certaine signes given both to a man and woman; to him verily of command and principality; to her truly of subiection: and among these this also; that the woman should have her head covered; but the man his head uncovered and bare. If these therefore are signes, both of them sinne, when as they confound this good order, and the constitution of God, and transgresse their limits; he, in falling downe to the humility and deiection of the woman; she, in rising up against the man, by her apparell and shape. For if it be not lawfull for them to interchange their garments, neither for a woman to bee clad in a mans Gowne; nor for a man to be attired in a womans Gowne, or Vaile; For he saith ; Neither shall the ornament of the man be put upon the woman; neither shall the man be clad in womans apparell, Deut. 22. 5. much more are not these things to be changed, &c. To passe by Damascen. Paralellorum. lib. 2. cap. 65. together with Beda Expositio in Deuteronom. c. 22. Operum. Tom. 4. p. 164 . who condemne mens putting on of womens apparell from this Text, which they recite: that elegant Bishop of Marcelles, Salvian , doth exceedingly tax the Romanes for permitting men to weare womans apparell, not onely in ordinary converse; but even upon the Stage. Who (writes he) could beleeve or heare, that men should have turned into a womanish patience, not onely their use and nature; but even their countenance, pace, habit, and all whatsoever is in the sex, or in the use of a man: all things were so turned upside downe, that whereas nothing ought to be more shameful to men, then that they should seeme to have any womanish thing in them; there nothing did seeme more dishonest to certaine men, then that they should seeme to be men in any thing, &c ? This therefore is more to be lamented and pittied, that this so great a wickednesse did seeme the crime of the whole Common-wealth; and the whole dignity of the Roman name was branded with the infamy of this prodigious wickednesse. For when men should clothe themselves in womans apparell, and become more effeminate then women, and cover their heads with feminine attires, and this publikely in a Roman City, yea, in the most famous and chiefe City there; what else was it, but the shame of the Roman Empire, that in the middest of the Commonweale this most execrable wickednesse should be tolerated without controll? Asterius Bishop of Amasea , who flourished about the yeere of our Lord,390. in his Homily, In Festum Kalendarum. Bibl. Patrum. Tom.4.p.705.C.D . writes thus: That in this feast, the people did learne the infamous and dishonest arts and studies of Stage-players, from whence effeminacy and dissolution of manners did proceed. Doth not that valiant man, that man of courage, who is admirable in his armes, and formidable to his enemies, degenerate into a woman with his vailed face? he lets his coate hang downe to his ankles, he twists a girdle about his brest, he puts on womens shoes, and after the manner of women, he puts a cawle upon his head; moreover, be harries about a distaffe with wooll, and drawes out a thred with his right hand, wherewith he hath formerly borne a trophie, and he extenuateth his spirit and voyce into a shriller and womanish sound. These are the profits of this solenmnity: these are the commodities and fruits of this dayes publike feast. O folly! O blindnesse! &c. So vehement is this godly Bishop against this unmanly practice, even in case of Stage-playes, which he much condemnes. Our learned Country-man, Alchuvi aeus , writing, of the practices of the Pagan Romanes on the Kalends of Ianuary , now our New-yeeres day; informes us; that divers of them did transforme themselves into monstrous shapes, and into the habit of wilde beasts. Others (saith hee) changed in a feminine gesture, did effeminate their manly countenance: neither unworthily haue not they a manly fortitude, who have changed themselves into a womans habit, or have put on a womans attire. Now because the whole world was replenished with these and other miseries, the whole universall Church hath appointed a publike fast to be kept on this day (which fast it seemes is now forgotten) in as much as the Author of life should put an end to these calamities : so doth he stile these effeminate practices.

All these, with infinite others in their Treatises against Stage-playes, doe utterly condemne the putting on of womans apparell, especially out of wantonnesse to act a Play, as a violation of this text of Deuteronomy, and an abomination to the Lord our God : neither was there ever any one Divine that I haue met with, who did contradict this truth; therefore we need not doubt or question it, but submit unto it without any more disputes. Lastly, the very reasons alleaged against the putting on of womans apparell on men, will evidently evince it to be sinfull to put it on to act a Play. For first, the very putting on of womans apparell (much more to act a lewde lascivious Enterlude) is an unnaturall, and so a detestable and shamefull act : as not onely Ambrose , and the fore-quoted Christian Authors, but even Seneca and Statius , with other Pagans testifie. For since nature hath made a difference , not onely betweene the sex, but even betwixt the habit and apparell of men and women, as well among the most barbarous, as the civilest Nations, in so much that they are visibly distinguished by the diversity of their rayment one from the other : it must needs be a violation of the very dictates of nature, for a man to clothe himselfe in that apparel which nature and custome have prescribed to another sex, as mis-becomming his. As nature it selfe doth teach men, that it is a shame for them to weare long haire (though our moderne Ruffians glory in it) because it is naturally proper unto women, to whom it is given for a vaile, a covering : so much more doth it teach men, that it is a detestable, unnaturall, shamefull thing for them, to put on womans attire to act a Strumpets part. Hence men in womens, and women in mens apparell have beene ever odious. Witnesse Heliogabalus , Sporus , Sardanapalus , Nero, Caligula, (Suetonij Calig. sect . 52.54. & others; together with the Male-priests of Venus , the Roman Galls or Cin aedi , the passive Sodomites in Florida , Gayra , and Peru; who clothing themselves sometimes, not alwayes in womans apparell (as did also William Bishop of Ely to his shame,) are for this, recorded to posterity, as the very monsters of nature, and the shame, the scum of men . Witnesse the Inkeepers of Fez at this day, who attyring themselves like women, shaving their beards, and becomming effeminate in their speech, are so odious to these very Infidels, (some base villaines onely excepted who resort unto them,) that the better sort of people will not so much as speake to them, neither will they suffer them to come within their Temples . If men in womens apparel be thus execrable unto Pagans, how much more detestable should they bee to Christians, who are taught not onely by the light of nature, but of the Gospel too , to hate such beastly male-monsters in the shapes of women? And as the verdict of human nature condemnes mens degenerating into women; so from the very selfesame grounds, it deepely cesures the aspiring of women above the limits of their female sex,  & their metamorphosis into the shapes of men, either in haire, or apparell. As nature dictates to men, that it is a shame for them to weare long haire, or womans rayment , so it instructeth women, that it is a shame, a sinne for them, to put on mans apparell, or to clip or cut their haire their feminine glory (as our Viragoes doe) because it is given them as a naturall covering to distinguish them from men : as the Apostle plainly teacheth, in the 1 Cor . 11. 5, 6, 15. the 1 Tim . 2. 9. & Deut . 22. 5. Hence the Councell of Gangra did anathematize those women, as infringers of the law of nature, and of the precept of subjection, who did either cut their haire, or clothe themselves in mans apparell, though it were under pretence of Religion , as Theodora (who lived a penitentiary life in mans apparell for her adultery in a Monastery for sundry yeeres together) is recorded to have done , and as some preposterous Nonnes in Egypt did : Hence Gratian Distinctio 30. Summa Angelica. Tit. F aemina . together with Calvin, Bullinger, Marlorat, Lyra, & Glossa Ordinaris , with sundry others on 1 Cor . 11. 5, 6. & Deut . 22. 5. & Synodus Turonica, Anno 1583\. apud Bochellum. Decreta. Ecclesi ae. Gallicanae. lib . 6. Tit . 9. cap . 11. (whose word I would our man-women English Gallants would consider) expresly teach us; that even nature herselfe abhors to see a woman shorne or polled; that a woman with cut haire is a filthy spectacle, and much like a monster; and that all repute it a very great absurdity for a woman to walke abrode with shorne haire; for this is all one as if she should take upon her the forme or person of a man, to whom short cut haire is proper, it being naturall and comly to women to nourish their haire, which even God and nature have given them for a covering, a token of subjection, and a naturall badge to distinguish them from men . Yet notwithstanding, as our English Ruffians are metamorphosed into women in their deformed frizled lockes and haire, so our English Gentlewomen, (as if they all intended, to turne men outright and weare the Breeches, or to become Popish Nonnes) are now growne so farre past shame, past modesty, grace and nature, as to clip their haire like men with lockes and foretops, and to make this Whorish cut, the very guise and fashion of the times, to the eternall infamy of their sex, their Nation, and the great scandall of religion. Yea, the unnaturall shamelesse Papists, bidding as it were professed defiance both to God, to nature, Moses , and S. Paul , haue made this a solemne Ceremony at the admission of all their Nonnes into their unholy orders, to poll their heads, and cut their haire, in token that they are now immediately espoused unto Christ, and so are freed from all subjection to men, or to their husbands , (as I presume those English women think they are, who cut their haire.) An unnaturall unchristian shamefull practise, derived (as themselves acknowledge) from the Pagan Roman Vestales (a fit patterne of imitation for all Popish Nonnes) who entring into that idolatrous order did use to poll their heads and consecrate their haire to the Goddesse Lucina, hanging it for a monument on a sacred Lote-tree . Well, let the Romanists and their Nonnes who give a reason for polling their religious Virgins that its a token of their freedome from all subiection to men, &c. (whereas they should rather plead they are men indeed, not women, and so are not bound to nourish their haire) much like the reason of those foolish Ruffianly Friers, or Crinitifratres, whom S. Augustine reproving for wearing long haire against the Apostles precept[illeg.] 1 Cor . 11. 14. to the scandall of religion , replied, that the Apostle prohibits men onely to weare long haire, and they were no men (as our effeminate hairy men-monsters hardly are) because they had made themselves Eunuches for the Kingdome of Heauen, and so were exempted from the Apostles text, as the Papists say these Nonnes of theirs are, though all other women what soever are included :) or let our English shorne Blowses, thinke what they will of this vile practise; yet sure I am that God, that Scripture, Nature, modesty, Religion and all ingenious persons, who have any sparkes of nature in them much condemne it, as an abominable guise, unfit for any but lewd Adulteresses and notorious Whores, (as many polled Nonnes and shorne- frizled English Maddames are.) Hence the ancient Germanes and others, did use to shame and punish notorious Adulteresses and Whores, by shauing off their haire, as the most ignominious punishment that could befall them. Hence the ancient Roman Emperours did usually punish Adulteresses by cutting their haire, and then thrusting them into a Monastery, to doe penance there, the true originall of this Popish custome. And hence the French Synode under Pope Zachery, in the yeere 742. decreed. That if any Nonnes and holy Virgins did fall into adultery (as many did) they should be thrice whipped, then cast into prison for an whole yeere, and have all the haire of their head shaven quite away; to make them odious for ever after, yet Romanists glory in this their feminine tonsure of their Nonnes; Whereas the Councell of Ariminum under Constantius (as if it had beene purposely somoned to convict the Papists of heresie in this very Ceremony of installing Nonnes) together with the Councel of Gangra , condemned Eustatius for an heretique; Quod mulieres comam detondere monuisset : for that he had perswaded women out of a pretext of holinesse, to cut their haire, against the very Lawes of God and nature . Now as womens clipping of their haire like men is thus execrable in it selfe, because unnaturall; so is their putting on of mans apparell, or men of theirs , especially for merriment. To passe by Domna , who clad her selfe in mans apparell to avoyd the rage of the Tyrant Maximinian ; together with that mirror of conjugall fidelity, Empoua, who cut her haire, and wore mans apparell lest she should betray her Husband Iulius Sabinus, being discovered, with whom she lived 9. yeeres in a vault , as Tacitna relates; with some other women formerly mentioned, who have cut their haire and put on mans apparell for learning, danger, or religion sake , whose practise I cannot approve, since God and nature both condemne it: I shall onely remember two Stories more, very pertinent to this purpose. The first is of the Argiva, or Gracian women of Argos, who driving Cleomenes King of Sparta from their besieged City under the conduct of Telesilla. the most of the Argivi being slaine before the siege; in remembrance of this their victory, ordained a feast on the seventh day of the fourth moneth, wherein they exercised their , Hibristica sacra, or contumelious solemnities, in which they clothed women in mans apparell, and men with womens haire-laces, veiles, and head attires : (inverting the very course of nature both in the male and female sex:) And withall that they might seeme to contemne and disgrace their Husbands, they inacted this law (which our English shorne Viragoes might doe well to put in practice) that all married women should put on beards, when ever they should lie with their Husbands : which puts me in minde, not onely of bearded Venus (to whom men sacrificed in womens, and women in mens apparel, as Macrobius hath recorded) whom they pictured like a man from the girdle upward, and like a woman onely from the girdle downwards, because they deemed her both a man and a woman : (a lively emblem of our halfe-men-women monsters:) but likewise of the Winnili or Lombards wives , who going to Goddanus with their Husbands to desire of him the victory against the Vandals with their haire hanging loose below their cheekes in forme of a beard ; Goddanus seeing them out of his window, and taking them to be men with very long beards, demanded . Qui sunt isti Longobardi? from whence they were after called, Lombards , quasi Long- beards , as some, or as other Historians have recorded, because their Husbands to increase the number of their Army at their first eruption, that so they might be more terrible to their enemies, did untie their wives long haire and fashion it to their faces like a beard, deceiving their enemies with this Stratagem . which if our English polled females (who may do well to make them beards of the haire they have shorne from their Lockes and Foretops) will but imitate, they may then seeme bearded men in earnest, and fall to wearing breeches to, (as they have lately taken up mens Tonsure, Lockes and Dublets, if not more :) and so bee like these mannish Argiv ae , ouer-ruling nature and their Husbands both at once. The second History is that of Aristodemus the Tyrant , surnamed effeminate, because he wore long womanish haire, for which the very Barbarians did condemne him. This unnaturall Tyrant endevoring to effeminate the Cum aeans, commanded and taught their Youths to nourish their haire like women, to colour it yellow, to curle and embroyder it, and binde it up in phillets; and to weare painted and embroydered Gownes and garments untill they were past 20. yeeres of age. And withall he compelled their women to cut their haire round, and to put on mens apparell . Which invertion of the course of nature in both sexes (condemned by Plutarch , as a tyranny beyond all his other wickednesses) did make him so execrably odious to the Cum aeans, that they rose up with one accord against him and slew him, together with all his posterity, as detestable and worthy ruine both with God and man . It is evident then by all these premises: that the putting on of womans apparel, and so e converso; is an unnaturall , and so a shamefull , an abominable act: therefore to put it on to act a Play, must needs bee such. Secondly, as it is an unnaturall, so likewise it is an effeminate act to put on womans apparell, especially to play a womans part. This all the fore-quoted Authors , together with Act 5\. Scene 3 abundantly testifie: This Plutarch , and Dionysius Hallicarnasseus [illeg.] us in the now recited History of Aristodemus the Cum aean Tyrant ; together with Orosius, Suetonius , Philo Iudoevs, Diodorus, Siculus, Athen aeus, Iustin, Lampridius, Iuvenal, Eujebius, Purchas , and the fore-quoted Historians, who condemne Sardanapolus, Heliogabalus, Nero, Sporus, the Male-priests of Venus, the Roman Galli, Cin aedi and others formerly mentioned for so many Monsters of unparalled effeminacy, for putting on womans attire , together with the very grounds of common reason, fully evidence. For what higher streine of invirility can any Christian name, then for a man to put on a womans rayment, gesture, countenance and behaviour, to act a Whores, a Bawdes, or some other lewd, lascivious females part? If this bee not effeminacy in the suparlative degree, I know not yet what effeminancy meanes. But if it be effeminate, as all must grant, then it must needs be sinfull yea abominable, since effeminacy is both an odious and a condemning sinne , as both Scriptures and Fathers doe proclaime it. Thirdly, a mans putting on of womans apparell, be it to act a Play, is a dishonest, immodest, and unseemely thing , which becomes not Christians or religion: it is a thing of ill , not good report ; a thing not honest , but vile and filthy in the sight of all men, as the fore-alleaged Authors, and Act 5\. Scene 3\. together with every ingenious mans conscience and experience testifie. Therefore it must needs be sinfull, as the recited Fathers, and Marginall Texts of Scripture will more fully evidence. Fourthly, a mans clothing himselfe in Maides attire,is not onely an imitation of effeminate idolatrouts Priests and Pagans , who arrayed them selves in womans apparell when they sacrificed to their Idols, and their Venus, and celebrated Playes unto them ; which as Lyra , A quinas; and Alensis well observe , was one chiefe reason, why this Text of Deuteronomy prohibits, mens putting on of womens apparell, as an abomination to the Lord : but a manifest approbation and revivall of this their idolatrous practice. Therefore it must certainly be abominable , and within the very scope and letter of this inviolable Scripture, even in this regard. Fiftly , this putting on of womans rayment, is a meere abuse of it . The end why God ordained apparell at the first, was onely to cover nakednesse ; to fence the body against cold, winde, raine, and other annoyances: to put men in minde of their penury, their mortality , their spirituall clothing from Heaven, and the like; and to distinguish one Sex, one Nation , one dignity, office, calling profession from another . Now a mans attyring himselfe in womans array, as it serves for neither of these good ends for which garments were at first ordained; which proves it a meere abuse: so it perverts one principall use of garments, to difference men from women ; by confounding, interchanging, transforming these two sexes for the present, as long as the Play or part doth last. If therefore mens ordinary wearing of womens garments, of the putting of them on in any other place but in a Play-house, or the wearing of them in the streets for an houre or two, and that but seldome ; be within the malediction of this text, or an unlawfull thing (as our very Antagonists in this case of Playes, coxfesse ) because it transformes the male in outward appearance into the more ignoble female sex, and nullifies that externall difference betweene them, which it ought to make : Then questionlesse mens arraying themselves in womans vestments to act a part in Masques, in Playes, or other Enterludes, must needs be much more abominable , within the meaning of this Scripture: because it not onely inverts these Sexes which God and nature have distinguished: but also abuseth apparell, not to any good or necessary purpose which is evill ; but to an unnecessary, lewde, lascivious end, from whence no good at all proceeds. Lastly, this putting on of womans array (especially to act a lascivious, amorous, whorish, Love-sicke Play upon the Stage, must needs be sinfull, yea abominable; because it not onely excites many adulterous filthy lusts, both in the Actors and Spectators; and drawes them on both to contemplative and actuall lewdnesse (as the marginall Authers testifie ) which is evill; but likewise instigates them to selfe-pollution, (a sinne for which Onan was destroyed:) and to that unnaturall Sodomiticall sinne of uncleanesse, to which the reprobate Gentiles were given over ; (a sinne not once to be named , much lesse then practised among Christians ;) which is worse, This the detestable examples of Heliogabalus, Sardanapalus, Nero & Sporus, the Male-Priests of Venus , with the Passive beastly Sodomites in Florida, Gayra, and Peru , evidence; who went clad in womans apparell, the better to elliciate, countenance, act, and colour their unnaturall execrable uncleanesse , which I abhor to thinke off. This the usuall practise of other ancient Incubi, who clothed their Galli, Succubi Ganymedes and Cyn aeds in womans attire, whose virilities they did oft-times dissect, to make them more effeminate, transforming them as neere as might be into women, both in apparell, gesture, speech, behaviour. And more especially in long unshorne womannish, frizled, lust provoking haire and Love-lockes (growne now too much in fashion with comly Pages, Youthes, and lewd effeminate ruffianly persons; as they were with these unnaturall Pagans, I dare not write, to amorous beastly purposes, to which they are strong allectives, of which they were ancient Symptomes, as sundry profane and Christian Writers testifie : Which should cause all chaste ingenious Christians for ever to detest them, the better to avoyd the snares, the badges, the suspicions of incontinency, and this most filthy sinne:) the more to extenuate this their unnaturall wickednesse, or rather the more freely to embolden, to allure and provoke them to the undaunted, unlamented practise of it, by reducing it as neere to naturall lewdnesse as they could devise : since few of them were so prodigiously impudent, so unmeasurably outragious at the first, as desperately to rush upon this unnaturall filthinesse in its suparlative native vilenesse, without some extenuating varnishes cast into it, to charme their consciences, and inflame their lusts. Yea this the execrable Precedents of ancient, of moderne Play-poets and Players witnesse, who have beene deepely plunged in this abominable wickednesse, which my Inke is not blacke enough to discypher. Witnesse the example of Sophocles , that famous Greeke Trag aedian, whom Athen aeus Dipnos. lib . 13. cap . 27. Plutarch , in his Amatorius; Suidas in the word Sophocles; C aelius Rhodiginus, Antiqu. Lect. lib . 15, cap. 9\. 10 Agrippa De Vanitate Scientiarum. c . 63. 64. have stigmatized for this sinne. Witnes Saint Cyprian , who writes thus of the womanish Pantomimes and Players in his times. Epist. lib. 2. Epist. 2. Donato. Libidinibus insanis in viros viri proruunt, &c. See Act 4. Scene 1\. Witnes Saint Chrysost. Hom. 12. in Epist. 1. ad Corinth. Theatra congregant & meretricum choros illic inducentes, & pueros pathicos qui iniuria ipsam naturam afficiunt. Quid ergo illos inducis cynaedos, & exoletos, &c. Yea witnes Caligula. Suetonij. Calig. sect. 55\. with M. Stubs , his Anatomy of Abuses p. 105\. where he affirmes, that Players and Play-haunters in their secret conclaves plage the Sodomites : together with some moderne examples of such, who have beene desperately enamored with Players Boyes thus clad in womans apparell, so farre as to sollicite them by words, by Letters, even actually to abuse them. All which give dolefull testimony to this experimental reason, which should make this very putting on of womans apparell on Boyes, to act a Play, for ever execrable to all chast Christian hearts. Hence is it, that sundry learned Divines annex this text of Deuteronomy to the 7. Commandement, as a morrall precept founded upon the very Law of nature; because mens putting on of womans rayment is a temptation, an inducement not onely to adultery, but to the beastly sinne of Sodome, which (saith Lactantius) is most properly called adultery, because it is unnaturall. Yea hence (as some have truely observed ) those women who put on mens , and men who put on womens apparel , are said in this text, not onely to be abominable, but even, to be an abomination , in the abstract, to the Lord their God; because it is an occasion off, a violent provocation to that monstrous unparalleld sinne of Sodomy, ( Cuius defecit interpretatio erubuit ratio, conticuit oratio :) which the following chapter, with severall other Scriptures , expresly stile; an abomination to the Lord our God. Since then it is abundantly evident by all these premises, (and I suppose by many Players and Play-haunters particular experience) that mens putting on of womans apparell especially to act a Whores, a Baudes, or Sweet-hearts womanish wanton part upon the Stage , where all the sollicitations, and inescating allectives to uncleannesse doe accompany it,) is a preparative, an incendiary, not only to sundry noysome lusts, to speculative, to practicall adultery, whoredome, and the like: but even to the most abominable unnaturall sinne of Sodom, to which mens imbred corruption , (as good Authors testifie) is over-prone ; as the detestable examples of the flagitious Sodonites, Cana aenites, Iewes, Gentiles, Corinthians, Italians, Turkes, Persians, Grecians, Tartars, Chinoyes, Celt ae, Peguans, Floridians, ancient Romans, Moores in Barbary , Gayrtans, Peruians, Iupiter and his Ganymedes , the anctent Priests of Venus, Sardanapalus, Nero and his Sporus, Heliogabalus , and many others : yea the frequent Sodomiticall wickednesses of sundry unholy-Popes, Cardinals, Popish Bishops, Abbots, Priests, Friers, Monkes , (such are the unchast fruits of their vowed and much-admired chastity:) together with the frequent inhibitions, Lawes & Edicts against this prodigious villany in Scriptures, Councels Heathen States , and in our English Statutes, (which have made it capitall , as a late example of a memorable act of iustice on an English Peere can witnes) doe more then testifie; it cannot but bee inexcusably sinfull, both in the eyes of God, who litterally prohibits it; and in the sight of naturall, much more of Christian men, who cannot but detest it. And so by consequence the Playes themselves which are acted in such apparell (as all our Masques and Stage-playes for the most part are) must questionlesse bee sinnefull, yea abominable, as mens putting on of womans apparell is. Thus al the fore-alleaged Councels, Fathers, Authors, do from hence conclude,  & so must I from all the premises. If any now object, that it is farre better, farre more commendable for Boyes to act in womans attire, then to bring women-Actors on the Stage to personate female parts; a practice much in use in former times among the Greekes , and Romans ; who had their Mim ae , their Sceni ae mulieres , or women- Actors (who were all notorious impudent, prostituted Strumpets ,) especially in their Floralian Enterludes : as they have now their female-Players in Italy, and other forraigne parts, and as they had such French-women Actors , in a Play not long since personated in Blacke-friers Play-house , to which there was great resort. I answer first, that the very ground of this objection is false, unlesse the objectors can manifest it to bee a greater abomination, a more detestable damning sinne, for a woman to act a females part upon the Stage, then for a Boy to put on a womans apparell, person and behaviour, to act a feminine part; which the Scripture expresly prohibits, as an abomination to the Lord our God : or unlesse they can prove an irritation, an inducement to Sodomy, to selfe-pollution (in thought at least if not in act,) a lesser sinne, a more tollerable evill, then mannish impudency , or a temptation to whoredome, and adultery: which none can evidence. Secondly, admit men-Actors in womens attire, are not altogether so bad, so discommendable as women Stage-players; yet since both of them are evill, yea extremely vitious, neither of them necessary, both superfluous as all Playes and Players are; the superabundant sinfulnesse of the one, can neither iustifie the lawfulnesse, nor extenuate the wickednesse of the other. It is no good argument to say, Adultery is worse then simple Fornication: Sodomy with such other unnaturall wickednesses are farre more abominable then adultery: therefore fornication and adultery are lawfull and may still be tollerated (as they are in beastly Rome, the very Sinke, the Stewes and Nursery of all such uncleannesse ; which should cause all Christians to detest this Whore , together with her head, her Pope, her supreme Pander :) because the transcendent badnesse of the one, doth neither expiate nor extenuate the sinfulnesse of the other. Yet this is the present objection in effect; Female- Actors, are worse then male-Actors arrayed in womans apparell; therefore they are tolerable, if not lawfull. Whereas this should rather bee the conclusion (with which I will close up this Scene;) both of them are abominable both intollerable, neither of them laudable or necessary; therefore both of them to bee abandoned, neither of them to be henceforth tollerated among Christians. Secondly, as Stage-playes are thus unlawfull, in regard of the womannishnesse, so likewise are they in respect of the costly gawdinesse, the immodest lasciviousnesse, the fantastique strangenesse, the meretricious, effeminate lust-provoking fashions of that apparell wherein they are commonly acted and frequented: from whence I shall deduce this 22. Argument against Stage-playes. Those Playes which are usually acted and frequented in over-costly effeminate, strange, meretricious, lust-exciting apparell, are questionlesse unseemely, yea unlawfull unto Christians. But our ordinary Theatricall Enterludes, are for the most part acted and frequented in such apparell. Therefore they are questionlesse unseemely, yea unlawfull unto Christians.

Whence they applaud the Lacedemonians law; that none but common prostituted Strumpets should weare any costly or glorious apparell; the better to deter all chaste and sober persons from it. A law which would well befit our Nation, our times, which Proteus- like are alwayes changing shape and fashion, and like the Moone, appeare from day to day in different formes. The Minor is evident by experience; which findes an whole Wardrobe of all gawdy, pompous vestments; a confluence of all whorish, immodest, lust- provoking attires; a strange variety of all effeminate, lewde, fantastique, outlandish apish fashions, (or disguises rather) at the Play-house; suficient to excite a very hell of noysome lusts in the most mortified Actors and Spectators bowels: To this we may adde the verdict of the Fathers, who censured the Playes in their times, even from the quality of the apparell in which they were acted. Witnes Clemens Alexandrinus; who as be reiects all costly immodest apparell, as fit for no place but the Stewes, or Stage: so he condemnes, not only Playes themselves; but even the delicacy, the effeminacy, the costlinesse and lustsulnesse of that apparell wherein they were acted. Witnes Tertullian , who writes; That in all Enterludes there is nothing more scandalous, more pernicious, then the over-curious attire of men and women (both Actors and Spectators) which did blow up sparkes of lust. Witnes S. Chrysostome , who informes vs, That the apparell used in Play houses is most lewde, lascivious. filthy ; whence he stiles it, Vestitus Satanicus, Satanicall array. Witnes Synesius who gives the title of Scenicus ornatus , to gawdie, new-fangled, swaggering apparell, because Players array was such. Witnes Theophilact, Oecumenius, Chrysostome , on the 1 Tim . 2. 9. viz. In like manner also, that women adorne themselves in modest apparel; not with broidered haire, or gold, or costly attire ; (a text which our English Ladies have long since forgotten, if not reiected , as savoring of Puritanisme and over-strict precisenesse;) where thus they write: That women must come to Church (and I would our frizled, pouldred, shorne, swaggering Lasses, who are never gawdier or compter then in Churches , would remember it) not with broidered haire, or gold, or costly attire; for they come there, to pray, not to dance. They come to crave the forgivenesse of their sinnes, and shall they then adorne themselves like comicall women, as if they were entring into a Play-house to act a part? Cut therefore from thee all this counterfeiting, circumcise from thee all this demeanour of the Stage and Players: for God is not mocked. These things are to be left to Players and Dancers, and to those who are conversant in the Play-house: no such thing is sutable to a chaste and sober woman. An unanswerable Argument, that lascivious dresses, and rich immodest, new-fangled apparell misbeseeming Christians, were much in use in Playes and Play-houses. This Theodoret, Vopiscus, Ovid, Horace , Invenal , with sundry others testifie , of which you may reade more largely in the third and sixt Scene of this present Act. All which sufficiently evidence the truth of the Assumption; and so by consequence of the Conclusion too; which needs no further proofe to backe it. The fourth thing considerable in the manner of acting Stage-playes, is the adjuncts, the Cocomitants which usually attend it, the first whereof, is, lascivious mixt, effeminate Dancing on the Stage, not men with women onely, or rather with Whores or persons more amous, (for such are all those females in Saint Chrysost[illeg.]mes iudgement, who dare dance publikely on a Theater ;) but even men with boyes in womans attire, representing the persons of lewde notorious Strumpets: whence I assume Argument against our publike Enterludes. Those Playes which are commonly attended and set forth with lascivious, mixt, effeminate, amorous dancing; either of men with women, or youthes in womens apparell, are undoubtedly sinfull, yea utterly unlawfull unto Christians. But all our popular Stage-playes are commonly thus attended and set forth. Therefore they are undoubtedly sinfull, yea utterly unlawfull unto Christians. The Major is irrefragable, because all mixt effeminate, lascivious, amorous dancing, especially with beautifull women, or boyes most exquisitely adorned in an inescating womanish Dresse on the open Stage , where are swarmes of lustfull Spectators, whose unchaste unruly lusts are apt to be enflamed with every wanton gesture, smile, or pace, much more with amorous daunces ;) is utterly unlawfull unto Christians, to chaste and sober persons; as sundry Councels, Fathers, moderne Christian, with ancient Pagan Authors and Nations have resolved; though it bee now so much in use, in fashion and request among us, that many spend more houres (more dayes and nights) in dancing, then in playing, I might adde working too.

Secondly, the very Devill himselfe (write they) who danced in the Daughter of Herodias. Math. 14 6. 7. (as Chrysostome, Fulgentius , Theophylact. and others write) was the originall Author of this dancing, the onely instrument who excites men to it; the onely person that is present at it, that is honored, pleased, and delighted with it ; (he being ever- more present and president where such dancing is ) as Chrysostome, Basil, with the other Marginall Authors have plentifully recorded. The Waldenses and Albigenses in their Censure of Dancing, have unanimously professed and published this truth to all the World; whose words because they are notable and punctuall to this purpose, I shall here transcribe at large, quoting some sayings of the Fathers in the Margent, to backe and evidence what they write. A Dance (as I finde their words in their Treatise against Dancing) is the Devils procession, and he that entreth into a Dance, entreth into his possession. The Devill is the guide, the middle, and end of the Dance. As many paces as man maketh in Dancing, so many paces doth he make to Hell. A man sinneth in Dancing divers wayes: as in his pace, for all his steps are numbred: in his touch, in his ornaments, in his hearing, sight, speech, and other vanities. And therefore we will prove, first, by the Scripture, and afterwards by divers other Reasons, how wicked a thing it is to Dance. The first testimony we will produce, is that we reade in the Gospell, Marke 6\. It pleased Herod so well, that it cost Iohn Baptist his life. The second is in Exodus 32\. When Moses comming neere to the Congregation saw the Calfe, he cast the Tables from him, and brake them at the foote of the Mountaine, and afterwards it cost three and twenty thousand their lives. Besides, the ornaments which women weare, are as crownes for many victories which the Devill hath gotten against the Children of God. For the Devill hath not onely one sword in the Dance, but as many as there are beautifull and well-adorned persons in the Dance. For the words of a woman are a glittering sword. And therefore that place is much to be feared, wherein the enemy hath so many swords, since that one onely sword of his may be feared. Againe, the Devill in this place strikes with a sharpned sword: for the women come not willingly to the Dance, if they be not painted and adorned: the which painting and ornament, is as a Grindstone upon which the Devill sharpneth his sword. They that decke and adorne their Daughters, are like those who put dry wood to the fire, to the end it may burne the better: for such women kindle the fire of luxury in the hearts of men: as Samsons Foxes fired the Philistins corne; so these women have fire in their faces, in their gestures and actions, their glances and wanton words, by which they consume the goods of men. Againe, the Devill in the Dance useth the strongest armor that he hath, for his most powerfull armes are women; which is made plaine unto us, in that the Devill made choyce of the woman to deceive the first man. So did Balaam that the Children of Israel might be reiected. By a woman he made Samson, David and Salomon to sinne. The Devill tempteth men by women three manner of wayes; that is to say, by the touch, by the eye, by the eare. By these three meanes, he tempteth foolish men to Dancings, by touching their hands, beholding their beauty, hearing their songs and musicke. Againe, they that dance, breake that promise and agreement, which they have made to God in Baptisme, when their God-fathers promise for them, that they shall renounce the Devill and all his pompe; for dancing is the pompe of the Devill, and he that danceth, maintaineth his pompe, and singeth his Masse. For the woman that singeth in the dance is the Prioresse of the Devill, and those that answer are Clerkes, and the beholders are the Parishioners, and the musicke are the Bells, and the Fidlers, the Ministers of the Devill. For as when Hogs are strayed, if the Hogheard call one, all assemble themselves together. So the Devill causeth one woman to sing in the dance, or to play on some instrument, and presently all the Dancers gather together. Againe, in a dance a man breakes the ten Commandements of God. As first, thou shalt have no other gods but me, &c. For in dancing a man serves that person whom he most desires to serue: and therefore saith S. Hierom, Every mans god is that he serves and loves hest. He sinnes against the second Commandement, when he makes an Idoll of that he loves. Against the third, in that others are frequent amongst Dancers. Against the fourth, for by dancing the Sabbath day is prophaned. Against the fift, for in the dance, the Parents are oft-times dishonored, when many bargaines are made without their counsell. Against the Sixt: A man kils in dancing; for every one that standeth to please another, he kils the soule as oft as he perswadeth unto lust. Against the seventh, for the party that dancet, [illeg.] be male or female, committeth adultery with the party they lust after ; For he that looketh on a woman, and lusteth after her, hath already committed adultery in his heart. Against the eight Commandement, a man sinnes in dancing, when he with draweth the heart of another from God. Against the ninth, when in dancing he speakes falsly against the truth. Against the tenth, when women affect the ornaments of others, and men covet the wives, daughters, and servants of their neighbours. Againe, a man may prove how great an evill dancing is, by the multitude of sinnes that accompany those that dance: for they dance without measure or number. And therefore saith. S. Augustine, the miserable Dancer knowes not, that as many paces as hee makes in dancing, so many leapes he makes to Hell. They sinne in their ornaments after a five-fold manner. First, in being proud thereof. Secondly, by inflaming the hearts of those who behold them. Thirdly; when they make those ashamed that have not the like ornaments giving them occasion to covet the like. Fourthly, by making women importunate, in demanding the like ornaments of their Husbands. And fiftly, when they cannot obtaine them of their Husbands, they seeke to get them elsewhere by sinne. They sinne by singing and playing on instruments, for their songs bewitch the hearts of those that beare them, with temporall delight; forgetting God, uttering nothing in their songs but lyes and vanities. And the very motion of the body which is used in dancing, gives testimony enough of evill. Thus you see, that dancing is the Devils procession, and he that entreth into a dance, entreth into the Devils possession. Of dancing the Devill is the guide, the middle, the end, and he that entreth a good and wise man into the dance, commeth forth a corrupt and wicked man. Sarah, that holy woman was none of these. Thus farre the Waldenses and Albigenses , whose words I would the dancing, wanton , (that I say not whorish) Herodiasses , the effeminate fiuqua-pace Caranto-frisquing Gallants of our age, together with our rustique hobling Satyrs, Nymphes, and dancing Faries , who spend their strength, their time , (especially, the Easter, Whitson, Midsommer , and Christmas season) in lewde lascivious dancing, would now seriously consider. And this would teach them, not onely to abandon all such dancing themselves, but likewise to withdraw their children, especially their daughters, from the Dancing-schoole , (as S. Ambrose long since advised all holy women, all godly Parents for to doe; admonishing them, to teach their daughters religion, not dancing , (as now alas too many doe) that so they might keepe them chaste and honest; leaving: lust-provoking dancing unto Adulteresses and their Daughters onely, as well beseeming none but such : in whose roundes the Devill for the most part leades, continues, ends the Dance, as the Waldenses , and fore-quoted Fathers largely write. Thirdly, they condemne all dancing, as being, not onely a common recreation of lascivious drunken Pagans & Idolaters, in their Festivals and times of publike mirth, as Ovid, Horace, Invenall, Virgill, Catullus , Tibullus, Propertius, Homer, Odysse ae. lib . 1. pag . 8. lib . 8. p . 14.

Witnesse their Corybantes, Curetes, Salij , and such like dancing Priests, who on the solemne festivall dayes of Cybele, Bacchus, Mars, and other Pagan-deities, danced about the streets and Market place with Cymbales in their hands, in nature of our Morrice-dances , (which were derived from them) the whole multitude accompanying them in these their dancing Morrices, with which they honoured these their Devill-Idols. Yea, witnesse the common practise of most Idolatrous Pagans, who never honoured, saluted, or offred any publike sacrifice to their Idols but with musicke, songs, and dances; dancing about their Temples and Altars, to their honour; as Virgil , Ovid , Plato, Strabo, Zenophon, Horace, Iuvenal, Catullus, Tibullus, Aristotle, Athen aeus, Alexander ab Alexandro. Genialium. Diterum. l. 4. c. 13. Caelius Rhodiginus Antiqu Lectionum l. 5. c. 3. Agrippa De Vanitate Scientiarum. cap 18. Purchas Pilgr. Booke 5. chap 1. Bulingerus De Theatro. lib. 1. cap. 52. Euripidis Bacchae , thorowout, and sundry others testifie: from which practice, our dancing at Wakes , (a name, an abuse, derived from the ancient Vigils) or Church-ales, and our late crouching and ducking unto new-erected Altars (a Ceremony much in use with Idolatrous Pagans heretofore) have beene originally derived. Since therefore its evident by all these testimonies, that dancing had its originall from Idolatry, and Idolatrous drunken Pagans, who consecrated dances to their Idols, and went dancing to their Temples, their Altars, when they sacrificed to them in their solemne Festivals, and dayes of mirth, they hence conclude them, to be unlawfull unto Christians; who must not imitate them in their Idolatrous Pagan customes, as I have here largely proved, in the first and second Act , on which you may reflect .Fourthly, dancing, write they, ( yea even in Queenes themselves, and the very greatest persons, who are commonly most devoted to it ) hath beene alwayes scandalous and of ill report, among the Saints of God; as the fore-going Councels, Fathers, and Authors plentifully evidence ; who have condemned dancing, as a pompe, a vanity of this wicked world; an invention, yea, a worke of Satan; which Christian have renounced in their baptismes. a recreation more fit for Pagans, Whores, and Drunkards, then for Christians : therefore, a Christian, (who is onely to follow things of good report, and to provide things honest in the fight of all men ; not giving any offence or scandall to Gods Church or people ;) may not practise it. Fiftly, dancing, say they, is not onely an effeminate recreation, enseebling the misdes, yea, depraving the lives and maners of men , a sufficient argument of its unlawfulnesse: but it likewise irritates and ingenders noysome lusts, it occasions much dalliance, chambering, wantonnesse, whoredome and adultery, both in the Dancers and Spectators. This daily experience; this all the fore-quoted Authors witnesse, and among the rest, Petrarcha , and Agrippa have most lively expressed it. To musicke (write they) belongs the art of Dancing, very acceptable to Maidens and Lovers, which they learne with great care, and without tediousnesse doe prolong it untill mid-night, and with great diligence they devise to dance with fained gestures, and with measurable paces to the sound of the Cymball, Harpe, or Flute, and doe as they thinke very wisely and subtilly, the fondest thing of all other, & but little differing from madnesse; which except it were tempered with the sound of instruments, and as it is said, if vanity did not commend vanity, there should be no sight more ridiculous, nor yet more out of order then dancing ; this is a liberty to wantonnesse, a friend to wickednesse, and a provocation to fleshly lust, an enemy to chastity, and a pastime unworthy of all honest persons. There oftentimes a Matron hath lost her long-preserved honour: oftentimes the unhappy Maiden hath there learned that, whereof she had beene better to be ignorant: there the fame and honesty of infinite women is lost. Infinite from thence have returned home unchaste, many with a doubtfull minde, but none chaste in thought and deed. And we have seene that woman-like honesty in dancing hath beene throwne downe to the ground, and alwayes vehemently provoked and assaulted. The ancient Romanes, grave men, by reason of their wisedome and authority, did refuse all dancing, and no honest Matrone was commended among them for dancing. Dancing is the vilest vice of all, and truely it cannot easily be said, what mischiefes the sight and hearing doe receive thereby, which afterwards be the causes of communication & embracing. They dance with disordinate gestures, with monstrous thumping of the feete, to pleasant sounds, to wanton songs, to dishonest verses; Maydens and Matrons are there groped with unchaste hands; yea, kissed and dishonestly embraced: the things which nature hath hidden, and modesty covered, are there oftentimes by meanes of lasciviousnesse made naked, and ribauldry under the colour of Pastime is dissembled. An exercise doubtlesse, not discended from Heaven (I may adde, not leading to Heaven, into which we must passe thorow many afflictions, tribulations, prayers, teares, fastings; thorow a straite, a narrow, not broad or pleasant way , as Dancing, Stage-playes, and such Pastimes are:) but by the Devils of Hell devised, to the iniury of the Divinity, when the people of Israel erected a Calfe, in the Desert, who after they had done sacrifice, begun to eate and drinke, and afterwards rose up to sport themselves, and singing, danced in a round. Thus they : thus all the other fore-quoted Authors. Hence Alexander Fabritius , an ancient English Writer, stiles Dancing, A pastime of lascivious vanity and voluptucusnesse. And Iohn de Burgo, Chancellor of Cambridge in King Henry the VI. his Raigne, in his Pupilla Oculi: Partis vlim ae. cap. vlt. De Peccatis mortalibus. X. De Ducentibus choreis. writes, That those who dance to incite themselves or others unto lust, yea those likewise who dance out of custome, sin mortally, though they do it not with a corrupt intent. Neither dare I (saith he) to excuse these from a mortall sinne, since by dancing they plung themselves into this danger, of provoking others unto lust, and ipso facto seeme to approve of dancing, and by their example give authority to others to doe the like. Vpon this very reason our moderne Writers on the Commandements, make dancing a sinne against the 7\. Commandemant , because it is a common occasion both of actuall and mentall adultery; as their fore-mentioned Authorities at large declare, Therefore it must needs be unlawfull unto Christians, among whom adultery, fornication and uncleanesse are not so much as to be named , much lesse the manifest occasions of them entertained. Fiftly, dancing write they , is altogether incompatible with that universall holinesse, modesty, gravity, temperance, and sobriety , which God requires in all chaste, all gracious Christians; it being a recreation , (as Cicero , Ovid, Virgil , together with Ambrose, Basil, Chrysestome , Petrarcha, Agrippa, Peter Martyr, M. Northbrooke , M. Stubs , and sundry others fore- quoted ) testifie which none but Bedlams, Drunkards, Fooles, or infamous persons use, in their riotous, unseasonable voluptuous feasts and meetings; which proves it the very worst and last of all vices; it being quite excluded from all private, honest, civill banquets; yea, wholy abandoned by all temperate, chaste, and sober persons. Therefore it must needs be unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians. Sixtly, Dancing , (say they) as now it is used, is an occasion of much wantonnesse, lewdnesse, and lasciviousnesse; of much riot, epicurisme, effeminacy, voluptuousnesse; of much prodigall expence, much losse of time, much superfluity, costlinesse, and new-fanglednesse in apparell, much pride and haughtinesse, much impudency and immodesty, especially in the female sex; whom dancing doth of all others least beseeme. Besides, it with-drawes young Gentlemen from their Studies to the Dancing-Schoole, which ingrosseth all their time; it avocates young Gentlewomen from their Needles, and such like honest imployments, and for the most part makes them idle Huswives, Whores, or Spend-thrifts ever after: It drawes men on, and traines them up to nought but idlenesse, the nursery of all other vices: it glues mens hearts to carnall pleasures and delights of sinne, and makes them carelesse of Gods service, unmindefull of their owne salvation, or of the day of death and iudgement, which should be alwayes fixed in their most serious meditations. More-over, it quite unfits men, and oft with-drawes them from the religious performance of holy duties, many Lords-dayes, most other Holy-dayes, (set apart for Gods peculiar worship) being oft-times grosly prophaned, if not wholy spent on lewde lascivious dancing, and such Heathenish pastimes : as the Councell of Affricke, Can . 18. the 4\.

Which I observe the rather, to confute the grosse mistake of some licentious Libertines ; who hold dancing on Lords-dayes, to be no unlawfull exercise, sport, or pastime, within the pious Statute of 1\. Caroli. cap. 1\. within which there is no question, but dancing is included; it being an exercise which all the fore-quoted Councels, Fathers, and Christian Authors, have unanimously condemned, as unlawfull, especially on the Sabbath, or Lords-day as we stile it; which our owne Homelies, and Canons enioyne us to spend in hearing the Word of God read and taught; in private and publike prayers; in acknowledging our offences to God, and amendment of the same; in reconciling our selves charitably to our neighbours where displeasure hath beene, in oftentimes receiving the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ; in visiting of the poore and sicke, using all godly and sober conversation : informing us withall; That God hath given expresse charge to all men, that upon the Sabbath day, they should cease from all weekely and workeday labour, to the intent, that like as God himselfe wrought sixe dayes, and rested the seventh, and blessed and sanctified it, and consecrated it to quietnesse and rest from labour; even so Gods obedient people should use the Sunday holylie, and rest from their common and daily businesse, and also give themselves WHOLLY to heavenly exercises of Gods true religion and service. But alas (quoth the Homely) all these notwithstanding, it is lamentable to see the wicked boldnes of those that will be counted Gods people, who passe nothing at all of keeping and hallowing the Sunday. And these people are of two sorts. The one sort, if there be businesse to doe, though there be no extreme need, they must not spare the Sunday: they must ride and iourny on the Sunday, &c. they must keepe Markets and Faires on the Sunday; finally, they use all dayes alike, Working-dayes and Holy-dayes are all one. The other sort is worse: For although they will not travell nor labour on the Sunday as they doe on the weeke day, yet they will not rest in holinesse, as God commandeth: but they rest in ungodlinesse and filthinesse, prancing in their pride; pranking and pricking, pointing and painting themselves to be gorgeous and gay; they rest in excesse and superfluity, in gluttony and drunkennesse like Rats and Swine: they rest in brawling and rayling, in quarrelling and fighting: they rest in wantonnesse, in toyish talking, in filthy fleshlinesse, so that it doth too evidently appeare, that God is more dishonoured, and the Devill better served on the Sunday, then upon all the daies in the weeke besides, And I assure you the beasts which are commanded to rest on the Sunday, honour God better then this kinde of people: For they offend not God, they breake not their holy-dayes. Wherefore O ye people of God, lay your hands upon your hearts, repent and amend this grievous and dangerous wickednesse, stand in awe of the Commandement of God himselfe, be not disobedient to the godly order of Christs Church, used and kept from the Apostles time untill this day. Feare the displeasure and iust plagues of Almighty God if ye be negligent. Dancing therefore on the Lords-day (which no godly Christians in the Primitive Church did once use for ought we read,) is an unlawfull exercise, if our Homelies or Canons may be iudges; therefore an unlawfull pastime punishable by the Statute of 1\. Caroli. cap . 1. which intended to suppresse dancing on the Lords-day, as well as Beare-bayting, Bull- bayting, Enterludes, and Common Playes ; which were not so rife, so common as dancing, when this law was first inacted. Finally, this dancing as the Waldenses teach, doth lead men on to the breach of all the ten Commandements , and to sundry inevitable sinnes and mischiefes: In all these respects therefore, they conclude it to bee evill, and unbeseeming Christians. Seventhly, Dancing (as Peter Martyr, Vives, Agrippa, Erasmus, Brant, Lovell, Northbrooke, Stubs, Gualther , and others in their fore-alleaged places testifie) is for the most part attended with many amorous smiles, lascivious gestures, wanton complements, lustfull embracements, loose behaviour , unchaste kisses, meretricious scurilous Songs and Sonnets, effeminate musicke, lust-provoking attire, obscene discourses, ridiculous Love-prankes, lewde companions ; all which are as so many severall strong solicitations to whoredome and uncleanesse, and savour onely of sensuallity, of raging fleshly lusts, which warre against the soule. Therefore its wholly to be abandoned of all good Christians. Eightly, this Dancing serves to no necessary use, no profitable, laudable, or pious and at all; it neither glorifies God, nor benefits men in soule, in body, in estate, or reputation: it issues onely from the imbred pravity, vanity, wantonnesse, incontinency, pride, prophanesse , or madnesse of mens depraved natures; and it serves onely to make provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof ; whereas all those who are Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof : Therefore it must needs be unlawfull unto Christians. Ninthly, this kinde of dancing, as it was never in use among the Primitiue Christians, whose footsteps we should tread in : so it is quite out of the road of Christianity, and salvation. Wee never reade of any Christians that went dancing into Heaven; though we read of sundry wicked ones who have gone dancing downe to Hell. The way to Heaven is too steepe, too narrow for men to dance in, and keepe revell rout: No way is large or smooth enough for capering Roisters, for iumping, skipping, dancing Dames, but that broad beaten pleasant road that leades to Hell. The gate of Heaven is to strait, the way to blisse to narrow , for whole roundes, whole troopes of Dancers to march in together: Men never went as yet by multitudes, much lesse by Morrice-dancing troopes to Heaven: Alas there are but few who finde that narrow way ; they scarce goe two together: and those few what are they? Not dancers, but mourners : not laughers, but weepers ; whose tune is Lachrym ae , whose musicke, sighes for sinne ; who know no other Cinqua-pace but this to Heaven, to goe mourning all the day long for their iniquities; to mourne in secret like Doves, to chatter like Cranes for their owne and others sinnes. Fasting, prayers, mourning, teares, tribulations, martyrdome were the onely rounds that led all the Saints to Heaven ; no other dance but these sad tunes will bring men to the place of endlesse ioy. These other dances oft-times end in sinne, in hell, in horror, in Heaven never; therefore all Christians should doe well to turne this dancing into mourning, this ioy and carnall laughter into spirituall heavinesse , as S. Iames commands them, that so sowing thus in teares, they may reape an harvest of eternall ioy. Lastly, Pagans themselves have abundantly condemned all mixt, lascivious, accurate, amorous dancing, as misbeseeming civill, chaste, or sober persons: and shall Christians iustifie or practise that which the very Heathen censure and cry shame on? Macrobius, Æ milius Probus, Cicero, Salust , together with Alexander ab Alexandro : C aelius Rhodiginus, Agrippa, Peter Martyr, Gualther, Northbrooke , and Master Stubs informe us: that it was an infamous, a dishonourable thing for men or women, among the ancient Pagan Romanes, to have skill in dancing, or to dance in any feast or publike meeting. And yet many Christians now a-dayes repute this their glory; that they are accurate expert Dancers, which these ingenuous Pagans deemed their shame. Salust , a grave Roman Historian, layes this as a brand of infamy on Sempronia, that she was taught to sing and dance more elegantly, then became an honest woman: which singing and dancing (saith he) are the instruments of luxury. And what did these two two qualities (which we now so much admire) worke in this curious, wel-educated Roman Dame? the Historian tels us: All things were alwayes dearer to her then reputation and chastity: and she was so enflamed with lust, that she would oftner seeke after men, then they after her. Macrobius informes us: that not onely Skill in dancing was reputed infamous and a badge of dishonesty among the Romanes: but that notwithstanding it the Sonnes of Noble-men, and (which is a shame to utter) their very Daughters also being yet Virgins, did reckon dancing among their other serious studies. Scipio Affricanus  Æmilianus, is a witnesse of this, who in his Oration against the iudiciary law of Tiberius Graccus saith thus : they are taught dishonest iuggling: they goe with pretty impudent Dancers, with a dulcimer and psaltery to the praise of Stage-players: they learne to sing, which our Ancestors wished should be reputed a disgrace in Gentlemen. There goe, I say, into the Dancing-Schoole among Dancers, both Noble Girles and Youthes. When one related these things to me, I could not perswade my selfe, that Noble persons would teach their Children these things: but when I was brought into the Dancing- Schoole, I saw in good earnest in that Schoole above five hundred Boyes and Girles. Among these (wherein I most of all pittied the Common-weale) I saw one garnished proud Boy, the Sonne of one that sued for a great Office, no lesse then tweelve yeeres old, dancing with rattles, which kinds of dance a lewde foolish serving-boy could not honestly dance. Thou seest (saith he) how Africanus mourned, that he had seene the Sonne of one who sued for an Office, which the hope and reason of obtaining a Magistracy (at which time he ought to vindicate himself and his from all reproachfull acts) could not then restraine from doing that, which could not be reputed but dishonest: And before he complaines that most of the Nobility did exercise this dishonesty. Thus Scipio Africanus and Macrobius iudge of dancing. Cicero , that unparalleld Roman Orator; as he by way of scorne stiles Gabinius, Catilines Consul , a Dancer : and withall accuseth Vorres for his intimate acquaintance with Apronius a dissolute adulterous, lascivious Pot-companion ; who danced naked at a drunken feast: which crime of dancing naked he obiects to L. Piso. So in his elegant Oratio for Mur aena, he censures Cato, for stiling L. Mur aena a Dancer: which if it be truely obiected (saith he) it is a reproach of a most vehement accuser: if falsly, of an ill-tongued rayler. For since thou art of so great authority, thou oughtest not, O Marcus Cato, to take up a slander out of the street, or from the reproach of any Railer, neither yet rashly to call the Consul of the Roman Nation, a Dancer, but to consider with what other vices he must necessarily be affected, to whom this may truely be obiected. For no man almost doth dance sober, unlesse peradventure he be mad, neither being alone, neither yet at a moderate and honest banquet: extreame dancing is alwayes the companion of a disorderly feast, a pleasant place, and of many voluptuous delights. Thou alleagest this against me, which must needs be the extreme or utmost of all vices; thou omittest those things, which being removed, this vice can never be at all: no dishonest banquet, no love, no revellings, no lust, no prodigall expence is shewed: and when these things are not to be found, which have the name of voluptuousnes and which are vitious: in whom thou canst not finde luxury it selfe; in him doest thou thinke to finde the shadow of luxury ? And in his Oration, Pro Deiorato Rege , he thus labours to excuse him from the infamy of dancing. What finally? whether doth this Gallowesbird proceed? he saith that Deioratus was so transported with mirth, and overcome with wine, that he danced naked in a feast. What Gallowes is sufficient to punish this fugitive? Who ever saw Deioratus dancing or drunken? all royall vertues are in him, &c. he therefore who whiles he was yet a childe, was so eminently glorious, that he never did any thing but most severely and gravely, hath he in this repute and age of his, thinke you, danced? Thou oughtest rather to have imitated the manners and discipline of thy Grandfather Castor, then to slander a good and famous man, with the tongue of a fugitive. But if thou hadest had a Dancer to thy Grandfather, and not that man from whom patternes of modesty and chastity might be taken, yet this reproach would not at all be convenient against that age, which from its youth hath fensed it selfe with the study, not of dancing, but of well-managing armes and Horses , which severall passages, together with that in the third Booke of his Offices : That a iust or honest man, would not dance in publike, though he might be heire to M. Crassus, though perchance a dishonest man would doe it : sufficiently testifie, that dancing was an infamous thing in men of place and note, among the Romanes: that it was a notorious reproach among them to be stiled, much more to bee a Dancer, and that no sober men, but vitious, riotous Whore- masters and Drunkards onely used it, in their Cups and ebrious Feasts. It is Seneca his lamentable complaint of his times, and we may iustly take up the same of ours, that the wits of slothfull youth worse growne lazie, neither were they industrious in the study of any honest thing. Sleepe, and sloath, and that which was worse then either sleepe or lazinesse, the diligent pursuite of evill things, hath invaded their mindes. The obscene studies of singing and dancing (pray marke his epithite) doe possesse the effeminate: and to frounce and curle the haire, to become effeminate in speech and body, is the very patterne of our youth . And now observe what followed here upon:) they are conquerers of others chastity, negligent of their owne . (Againe, in his Naturall Questions. lib . 7. cap . 32. he complaines; that the house of Pyladis and Batillus (two Dancing-masters and Stage-players) had successors to continue it: that there were many Schollers and many Masters of these arts: These Masters teach privately, (or there is a private Dancing- Schoole) thorowout the City; where both men and women dance: Men and their wives strive betweene themselves, which of them shall first turne the side to the Dancing-master. Afterwards, when as their modesty, and all their shame is worne quite away, they passe disguised to a Brothel-house . Loe here the end, the fruits of dancing, which this Heathen Philosopher much deplores. To passe by Iustin ; who stiles musicke and dances, the instruments of Luxury : together with Ovid , Virgil , Tibullus , and  f Horace ; who censure dancing, as an effeminate practice of drunken, lewde, adulterous men and women, in their luxurious feasts and meetings ; and withall to omit the Story, of Zenophons dancing Trull, who enamored Socrates and the other Spectators, with her dancing and Player-like action : The Poet Iuvenal makes dancing, the very badge of an adulteresse, the fuell of lust, the cause of adultery and much prodigall expence; reputing him an unhappy Husband, who hath a dancing Dame to his wife . And if this be true, how many happy Husbands are there now, when there are so few un-dancing wives? Suetonius records this, among other of Caligula his vices, that he was a Singer and a Dancer: that he was so transported with the pleasure of dancing and singing, that hee could not so much as refraine in publike Enterludes, but he must sing together with the Trag aedian that acted; and openly imitate the gesture of the Stage-player, either as it were praysing or correcting it. He did likewise dance (saith he) in the night sometimes: and upon a time, sending for three grave men who had beene Consuls, into his Palace, in the second watch of the night, he placed them being in a very great feare, upon a Scaffold: and then he leaped out suddenly with a great noyse of Pipes and Fidlers clad in a womans Gowne, and a long coate, and having danced out a dance, he departed . Polibius and Athenaus , doe both much condemne Antiochus surnamed the Illustrious , yet stiled, the mad, by them: for that in his riotous drunken Feasts, he would sometimes play together with the Actors: and once being vailed quite over, he was brought in upon the Stage by Players, and laid upon the ground, as if he were one of them: Afterwards oportunity calling him forth, he did caper, he did dance and iest with the Players, so that all there present were ashamed: To such miserable things as these, doth that stupidity induce men, which is ingendred of drunkennesse . The same Athen aeus , out of Theopompus , doth censure Strabo King of the Sydonians, who exceeded all men in the study of pleasure and delights; for that he made assemblies of Fidlers, Dancing- women, Lutanists, and sent for many Leamons, Whores, or Mistresses out of Pelleponnesus, for many singing women out of Ionia, and for many amorous Girles out of all Greece, some of which he tendred to those that danced, others of them he usually offred to his friends that sung as a reward of their combate, &c. which verefies the former position, that dancing is the occasion of much lewdenesse; and that Dancers for the most part are adulterous, lecherous people, given up to sensuality, and all kinde of vice. Which is further verified in his Dipnos. l . 4. c . 6. l . 8. c . 12. 13. l . 10. c . 9. 12. c . 6. 10. 13. l . 13. c . 6. 10. 31.  & l . 14. c . 3. 5. 11. 12. where he shewes, that all common prostituted whores were expert Dancers; and all Dancers whores, adulterers, or lascivious, deboist Bacchanalian persons, and that so they were reputed among Pagans. Homer, Odyssea. lib . 14. p . 418. and out of him Stob aeus, Sermo . 18. fol . 126. enumerate this among other effects of Wine and drunkennesse, that they make a wife man to sing and dance . Which proves, that wise men anciently never danced but when they were drunken, or frantique; which Euripides his Tragedie stiled Bacch ae , and Strabo his Geograph . lib. 10. pag. 48 to 55. will most plentifully evidence, to those who have leisure to persuse them. True it is that Plato and Aristotle approve of dancing in the Festivities and Solemnities of their Idol-Gods, in which they were most in use : which dances as they were very rare, perchance once or twice a yeere ; so they were likewise certaine, appointed by their idolatrous Priests, or by the Overseers of their dances, which dances might not be altered but by publike authority by the Priests and Magistrates speciall direction . Neither were they such dances as Christians can approve. For Plato even in these sacred dances dedicated to Idol-Gods, would have Youthes and Girles to dance together naked, that so they might the better discerne one anothers beauty or deformity, and so might not be deceived in their matches and marriages : Which custome of dancing naked , as it seems by Tully , Athen aeus , Basil , Euripedes , and others, was much in use in former times in drunken Feasts; in which naked whores or women oft-times attended , the more to enrage the naked Dancers and the Spectators lusts, to which they were prostituted at their pleasure . Such lascivious, beastly dances as these did these lewde Philosophers, and the drunken Greekes allow, in the Festivals of their filthy Idols . But for all other private dances ( such only excepted as were stiled Pirricall, wherein men vaulted, and danced in their Armor to shew their activity and strength ;) they were evermore infamous among Pagans, as the precedent Authors and Doctor Reinolds witnesse: therefore they should be much more abominable to all chaste, all modest Christians. If any here obiect in defence of amorous mixt lascivious dancing. (I speake not of grave single, chaste, and sober measures men with men) which is now so much in use and high esteeme. First, that there are many laudable example of dancing in the Scripture: as that of Miriam and the Isralitish women after the drowning of the Egyptians, and their miraculous deliverance from them: that of Iepthaes Daughters of the Isralitish women after the slaughter of Goliah and the Philistins: and that of David, who danced before the Arke with all his might . Secondly, that God commandes us , to praise him with cymbals and dances: That Salomon writes ; there is a time to dance; and that other Scriptures seeme to allow of dancing as lawfull. Therefore it cannot be unlawfull. To these, I answer first; that these Scriptures and examples warrant that kinde of dancing onely which is specified, and commended by them; not our theatricall, our moderne common dancing, which differs from it in many maternall circumstances , well worth the observation. For first, these dances which we read of in the Scripture, were all single, consisting altogether of men, or of women onely: (which kinde of single measures were anciently in use among the Persians and Greecians, & are yetretained among the Brasilians and others .) Whereas our moderne dances are for the most part mixt, both men and women dancing promiscuously together by selected couples. Secondly, these dances were no artificiall curious Galliards, Iigs, or Carontoes , learned with much paines and practise at a Dancing-Schoole, as ours are: but simple, plaine, unartificiall sober motions . Thirdly, these dances were no ordinary daily recreations , practised at every feast or meeting, upon every Lords-day, Holi-day, or vacant time; and that upon no other occasion, but for mirth or laughter sake, to passe away the time, or to satiate mens unruly lusts, ( the onely props of dancing ;) as all our moderne dances are. But they were publike extraordinary speciall dances, taken up by pious Christians to praise the Lord withall, after some extraordinary great deliverances from, or victories over their enemies , which scarce hapned twice in divers ages: Whereas our dances are not such. Fourthly, these dances were not made in any private House, or Hall; in any Ale-house, Taverne, or Bower neere adjoyning; much lesse at any May-pole, Wake, or Church-ale ; at any Play-house, Wedding, or Dancing-Schoole, as ours are: but in the open field, where the victorious Generall and his Army were to passe ; whom they went out to meet and welcome home with these their dances , which sounded forth his praises in those Psalmes and heavenly Songs, which the Scripture hath recorded . Fiftly, they danced not by couples or in measure as we use to doe, but in one intire traine or round . Sixtly, they did not wantonly leape, caper, fling or skip about like Does or Bedlams; nor mincingly trip it , as our lascivious amorous Dancers doe: but they used a modest grave and sober motion, much like to walking or the grave old measures; having timbrels and cymbals in their hands, and Psalmes (not scurrilous amorous Pastorals) in their mouthes, wherewith they did unfainedly blesse and praise the Lord for their obtained victories and deliverances, and sound forth the Victors praises . Seventhly, These dances were free from all lascivious dalliances, from all amorous gestures, gropings, kisses, complements, love-trickes, and wanton embracements; which abound in all our moderne Dances. Lastly, these dances were wholy devoted to Gods praise and glory ; they were a holy religious service done to God, proceeding from the thankefulnesse of such hearts, as were ravished with Gods more speciall mercies : Our moderne wanton dances have no such pious ends and circumstances, they proceed not from such hearts, such occasions, such extraordinary favours of God as these: they differ from them in all these severall circustances: therefore these dances, these examples doe no wayes iustifie, but condemne all ours, which have no affinity nor cognation with them. To the second Objection; that Salomon saith, there is a time to dance . I answer first, that by dancing in this, and the other obiected Scriptures , is not meant any corporall dancing, or artificiall moving of the feet in measure: but either an inward cheerefulnesse of heart, and readines of spirit in Gods service: or else a spirituall exultation of the soule in the apprehension of some speciall favour of God unto it, expressed in an abundant praysing of God in psalmes, in hymnes and spirituall songs . This and no other is the dancing intended by Salomon , and commanded in the Scripture, as Olympiodorus , Cbrysostome , Ambrese , Glossa Ordinaris, Lyra , Calvin , and sundry others teach us. Secondly, admit this text be meant of corporall dancing, yet it intends no other but religious holy dances, in which either men or women praise the Lord, with Hymnes and godly Psalmes, singing with a grace in their hearts to him, who hath given them so great an occasion of much holy ioy: it allowes no other dances but such, in which the heart is more active then the feet; in which Gods glory (not carnall iollity) is the utmost end. It gives no tolleration therefore for our common dances, which have neither holinesse for their quallity, nor piety for their end. Lastly, Salomon saith onely, that there is a time to dance : and this time, I am sure, is neither Lords-dayes, nor any other solemne Festivals devoted to Gods service, as the fore-quoted Councels, Fathers, and moderne Authors testifie: these are not times of dancing, but of praying, hearing, reading, meditating, and such like holy duties. All dancing therefore on such times as these (which are now made the chiefest dancing seasons) are out of Salomons dispensation. Againe, the time of working, of following our vocations, of performing private familie duties of religion; the times of sleepe and rest (I meane the night, which is more often spent in dancing then in praying, or any pious duty) is none of Salomons times for dancing: it being altogether untimely at these seasons; Therefore those who spend their working, praying, reading, studying time ( which God commandes them to redeeme ) in dancing, (which too many make their worke, their life, their trade) dance out of Salomons time and measure ; who gives no allowance to their untimely Rounds. Againe, dancing after a man is tyred out with honest labour, is altogether unseasonable: sleepe and quiet rest, are a wearied mans best, his fittest recreations : They that worke hard all day, had more need to rest, then dance, all night. And yet how many are there, who after an hard iourny or a toylsome dayes worke, will take more paines at night in dancing, then they did in labouring all the day time?  & because they are quite tyred out with working, they will yet tire themselves once againe in dancing; and so disable themselves the more for the workes and duties of the ensuing day; whereas every recreation should helpe, not hinder men in their callings . Hard workers therefore have little time, at least but little need or reason to turne Dancers. For others, who can finde either little, or no time at all to worke, (which is the epidemicall deplorable gentile fashion of our lazy age ,) I am sure Salomon hath bounded them out no time to dance: Eccles . 3. hath set downe 24. severall times at least, for severall workes , and but one (if that) for dancing . Those therefore who exempt themselves from these times of working, can make no title to this dancing season. He that will not labour , tis unfit he should play . He that hath no working time, tis equall he should have no dancing time. And yet how many are there now a-dayes who will needs intitle themselves to this time to dance, though they professedly disclaime all times to mourne or worke? How many are there that worke till they freeze, and yet dance till they sweat? that cannot worke or pray one houre in a day for sloath, and yet can dance nimbly day and night all the weeke long? that cannot walke twenty yards to Church on foot without the helpe of a Coach ; and yet will dance 40. Galliards or Carantoes five hundred paces long? These indefatigable dancers, who would rather die then worke; and not live then live well: need onely a time to worke (which I wish they may find:) not a time to dance, (which they will be sure to gaine) since they dance and play away all their time: Wherefore since neither Labourers nor Loyterers have any need of dancing, they have certainly no title, to Salomons time of dancing: and so both their dancing and arguments are out of season. Since therefore it is infallibly evident by all these premises, that our theatricall amorous mixt lascivious dancing, is sinfull and unchristian at the least, if not Heathenish and Dtaboltcall ; The Major of my precedent Syllogisme must be grated: which I shal here close up with that notable passage of Alexander Fabritius , an ancient English though somewhat Popish Author, who writes thus of Dancing . The entring into the processions of dances, hinders men from ingresse into the heavenly procession, and those who dance (especially upon Holy-dayes) offend against all the Sacraments of the Church. First, against Baptisme, in this, that they breake the Covenant which they have entred into with God in baptisme, where they have promised, that they would renounce the Devill and all his Pompes; but they enter into the pompous procession of the Devill when they dance. For a dance as Gulielmus Parisiensis saith, is the Devils procession . Secondly, dances offend against the Sacrament of Order; For Clergie men who have received holy Orders, take those orders that they may conveniently celebrate divine services in the Church of God: but these vanities make divine Service to be contemned and neglected; for those who ought to be present at Mattens and Vespers, are oft- times present at these dances . Thirdly, they offend against the Sacrament of Matrimony; for oft-times in dances, by signes of wantonnesse, vaine songs, and unlawfull confabulations, the faith of Matrimony is violated either in consent or worke. Fourthly, they sinne against the Sacrament of Confirmation: for in the Sacrament of confirmation the signe of the Crosse is imprinted on their foreheads, as being bought with the passion of Christ: but in such dances the signe of the Crosse being cast away, they place the signe of the Devill on their heads. Fiftly, they doe against the Sacrament of Pennance: For in the Sacrament of repentance by which they were reconciled unto God, they promised that they would never hereafter offend in the like kinde: but in such vanities they plainely doe the contrary. Sixtly, they offend against the Sacrament of the Altar, For on Easter-day they receive the Sacrament of the Altar , but immediately after they are like to Iudas the Traytor: who when he had eaten at the Lords Table, out of his owne Dish, he went out presently after, and tooke a band of Soldiers from the High-Priests and Pharises, and came against Iesus, as appeareth Iohn the 18\. So these transgressing in the foresaid manner, come directly against Iesus: for when they are in a dance the procession of the Devill, they are not with Iesus, as himselfe saith , Luke II. he that is not with me is against me. As Kings in Autumne and Summer are wont to goe forth to the Warres, that they may take that from their enemies which they have gained by their labour in Winter: so the Devill the enemy of mankinde after Easter; yea, on Easter-day it selfe (we may more truely affirme it on our Christmas and Whitson Holy- dayes) gathers together an army of Dancers, that he may take from the Sonnes and Servants of Christ who are his enemies, their spirituall fruits, which they have gathered together in the Lent-time. Seventhly, they offend against the Sacrament of extreme Unction by which those who are sicke receive spirituall health: but these wretches in their playes and dances doe often lose the health both of their bodies and their soules. After this, he compares all women-dancers, (especially such as are gorgeously attired and set out with costly array, with painted faces, with false haire, shaven off from some dead womans scull; with head-tires of Gold, of silver, Pearles, and precious Stones, contrary to the Apostles precept , which the Devill who rides upon such women hath set upon their heads, as so many crownes of vanity for those many triumphes over the Sonnes of God which he hath gained by them,) to those locusts and that smoke which ascended out of the bottomlesse pit, Apocalipse the 9\. Advising all men out of Ecclesiasticus the 9\. not to keepe company with a woman that is a Dancer, not yet to hearken to her voyce, lest they chance to perish by her snares: and wishing all Christians to renounce all dancing, as being thus opposite to all the Sacraments . Thus much concerning dancing, in probat of my Major, in which I have the more inlarged my discourse, both in respect of the neere affinity that is betweene Playes and Dancing; and in regard of the universality of this lewde infamous exercise, which overspreds our owne and other Nations, whose commonnesse hath purchased it: such credit such applause in this effeminate, unchaste lascivious dissolute age wherein we live; that most repute it a necessary ornament, an essentiall commendable quality or vertue, to make vp a Gentleman, a Gentlewoman, who are deemed incompleate, at leastwise rude without it: when as all the fore-quoted Councels, Fathers, Pagans, and moderne Christian Authors, with infinite others, have thus branded, censured it (especially in the female sex who are now most devoted to it) as a Diabolicall, infernall , effeminate, unchristian, wicked, unchaste, immodest heathenish pastime, contrary to all Gods Commandements and Sacraments: and as the very pomps of Satan which wee renounce in Baptisme: which mee thinkes should now at last rectifie our depraved iudgements in this point of Dancing, and reforme our lives. For the Minor, that Stage-playes are commonly attended with mixt effeminate amorous dancing; it is most apparant; not onely by our owne moderne experience, but likewise by the copious testimony of sundry Pagan and Christian Writers of all sorts: as namely, of Polibius.

Diabolicall Songs; dancing Girles; or that I may speake more truely, Girles stirred hither and thither with the furies of the Devill. For what doth a Danceresse doe? She impudently uncovers her head, which Paul hath commanded to be continually vailed: she inverts her necke; she tosseth about her haire this way and that way; Even these things are likewise done by her who is possessed by the Devill. Such likewise was the feast of Herod: the Daughter of Herodias entring in, danced, and cut of the head of Iohn the Baptist; and so she obtained the subterraneous places of Hell in stead of an inheritance. Wherefore, those who love rounds and dances , have certainely a portion with her in Hell . A terrible sentence sufficient to startle all our dancing Dames, and frisquing effeminate Gallants; who make dancing their onely excellency, and supreme delight.

All which expresly informe us; that dancing was alwayes heretofore, and yet continues an unseperable concomitant, if not a necessary part of Stage-playes . The premises therefore being thus confirmed, my conclusion from them against Stage-playes must be granted lascivious lust-provoking Songs and Poems, which were once so odious in our Church; that in the Articles to be inquired of in Visitations , set forth in the first yeere of Queene Elizabeths Raigne, Article 54\. Church- wardens were enioyned to inquire; whether any Minstrels, or any other persons did use to sing or say any Songs or Ditties that be vile and uncleane ; which suggests this Play-oppugning Argument to me. Those Playes which are usually accompaned with amorous Pastoralls, lascivious ribaldrous Songs and Ditties, must needs be unlawfull, yea abominable unto Christians. But Stage-playes are usually accompanied with such Pastorals, Songs, and Ditties as these. Therefore they must needs be unlawfull, yea abominable unto Christians. The Minor is most aparant. First, by our owne moderne experience, there being, nothing more frequent, in all our Stage-playes (as all our Play-haunters can abundantly testifie;) then amorous Pastorals, or obscene lascivious Love- songs, most melodiously chated out upon the Stage betweene each seueral Action; both to supply that Chasme or vacant Interim which the Tyring-house takes up, in changing the Actors robes, to fit them for some other part in the ensuing Scene: (a thing in use in Ancient times, as Horace , Livy, and sundry others have recorded;) as likewise to please the itching eares, if not to inflame the outragious lusts of lewde Spectators, who are ost-times ravished with these ribaldrous pleasing Ditties, and transported by them into a Mahometan Paradise , or extasie of uncleanesse. Secondly, as experience, so sundry ancient and moderne Authors fully suffragate to my Minors truth. In Stage-playes (writes S. Basil) corrupt Songs ingenerate too much lust in the mindes of men. These Whorish Songs residing in the mindes of the hearers, doe nought else but perswade filthinesse to all that heare them . Wherefore wee commend not those contumelious Poets who place felicity in obscene Songs. In Stage-playes (writes Chrysostome,) are broken effeminate lascivious words, meretricious songs, and voyces provoking vehemently to voluptuousnesse; and polluting mens eares farre more then any dirt or filth. What (write Euscbius and Damascen) doth he perceive who runs to Theaters?

Who all unanimously testifie; That Stage-playes are alwayes fraught with adulterous, obscene, lascivious Songs, and wanton Pastorals, which adde strength and fuell to mens lusts . My Minor therefore must be granted. The Major is unquestionable; because all ribaldrous, amorous Songs: (which now are too to rife, not onely in Stage-playes, but ever at private Christians Feasts, and other Taverne-meetings , from which Theodosius, Stilico, and others excluded all Songs and singing-women; (the very ornaments and delights of lascivious banquets, as Homer , Gellius , and Quintilian stile them:) are abundantly condemned as abominable, sinfull pastimes misbeseeming godly Christians. First, by the expresse verdict of the Scripture; which as it inioynes all Christians in their Feasts, their mirth, and private meetings, to sing Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs, of prayer, of praise to God with a grace and melody in their hearts: a practise, which all the Primitive Christians (as the marginall Authors witnesse) observed in their Love-feasts, in all their private and publike meetings : and I would, those moderne Christians, who banish these things from their Feasts and Merriments, as altogether unseasonable, exhilerating themselves with nought but scurrilous beastly Songs, lascivious musicke, wanton dancing, and such unchristian mirth ; would now againe reviue it. So it expresly prohibits all filthy, corrupt, unedifying communication : all fornication and uncleanesse which are not so much as once to be named among Christians: together with all foolish talking and iesting; all ribaldry and scurrility, either in songs or iests (which Plato , and the Athenians , though Pagans, did prohibite by an unanimous law,) as odious unto God, pernicious to the manners, mindes, and soules of men, and misbeseeming Christians , whose words should be alwayes gracious, seasoned with salt, that so they might administer grace , not poyson or corruption, to the hearers . Ribaldrous amorous Songs, are so unsutable for the mouthes, the eares of Christians; that Theophylact plainly tells us, that those who sing such Songs, are possessed with an uncleane spirit : and S. Bernard, that he who is delighted with obscene iests, and secular Ditties , (as alas too many are) is in the very pavilion or possession of the Devill . No wonder therefore if the Scripture condemnes such songs as these, as unbefitting Christians. Secondly, as the Scripture, so sundry ancient and moderne Councels expresly censure, such Poems, Songs, and Ditties; as abominable and polluted in themselves, defiling the mouthes, the eares, of those who chaunt, or heare them chaunted: as allectives unto lewdnesse, incentives unto lust , which grieve the holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed up to the day of redemption, and wholy effeminate the mindes of men .

A sufficient inducement to cause all godly Christians to abandon them, together with all those Playes, those Play-houses and places where they are in use. Thirdly, as these Scriptures and Councels; so likewise the Fathers are very copious in censuring such ribaldrous lascivious songs as these, which if we beleeve S. Ambroseor S.

We shall finde such Songs, such Poems as these abundantly condemned, as filtby and uncbristian defilements, which contaminate the soules, effeminate the mindes, deprave the manners, of these that heare or sing them, exciting, enticeing them to lust; to whoredome, adultery, prophanes, wantonnesse, scurrility, luxury, drunkennesse, excesse; alienating their mindes from God, from grace and heavenly things and Syren-like, with their sweet enchantments entrap, ensnare, destroy mens soules, proving bitter potions to them at the last, though they seeme sweet and pleasant for the present . Let S. Chrysostome , that all- golden Father , as Theodoret stiles him, whose lips did drop with Myrre and Hony , speake here for all the rest, who is somewhat copious in this theame. Like as Swine (writes he) runne thither where there is mire, and as Bees doe live where there are spices and perfumes: so where there are whorish Songs, there are the Devils gathered together: but where there are spirituall Songs, thither the grace of the holy Ghost doth flie; and the mouth sanctifieth the heart. And as those who bring in Stage-players, and Harlots into their Feasts (I would those whose practise it is now, would marke his words) doe call in Devils thither: so they who call in David with his Harpe (he meanes his Psalmes of which he speakes) doe call in Christ by him. They make their house a Theater, doe thou make thy Cottage a Church . This, saith David, is my perpetuall Song, this my constant worke and office, to prayse the Lord. Let them give eare, who effeminate and putrifie themselves with satanicall Songs. What punishment shall not they undergoe; or what dispensation may be given them, when as he being alwayes imployed in praysing his Saviour, they are perpetually wallowing themselves in these filthy Ditties? By this are we taught, to what great punishment they are obnoxious, who utter libidinous and obscene songs, who pronounce comicall toyes, who vent lyes and clamours in Ciques, &c. If then, contemning and for saking Stageplayes, thou shalt hereafter frequent the Church, thou hast then restored health to thy haulting feet: If thou shalt despise diabolicall songs, and in stead of them shalt learne spirituall Psalmes, thou mayest now speake, whereas before thou wast but mute . And in another Homely he writes thus. As stime and dirt are wont to stop the eares of the body, so meretricious songs do use to stop the eares of the minde, more then any filth: or rather, they doe not onely stop, but likewise contaminate and defile them: for such songs doe as it were cast dirt into the eares. What that Barbarian threatned saying; you shall eate your owne dung: that verily doe many to you now, not in word, but in deed: yea, that which is farre worse and filthier: For adulterous songs are much more abominable then any dung. And that which is farre worse to be endured . (though it bee the very humour and practise of our lascivious times) you are not onely not offended nor grieved at the hearing of such songs, but you laugh and reioyce: and whereas you ought to avoyd and abominate them, you entertaine and applaud them . To conclude: Dancing, musicke, adulterous ribaldry songs (faith this Father) which are so rife and frequent in our marriages (and yet not so frequent then, as they are now in ours:) are the very Devils pompe and hotch-potch &c. What wilt thou say of their slngs which are fraught with all incontinency? which bring in dishonest loves, unlawfull, nay wicked copulations, the eversions of houses and innumerable Tragedies, and have oft-times in them the name of a Mistris, and a Lover, a Sweet-heart and a Beloved. And that which is worst of all, there are Virgins present at them, who laying aside all shame, doe in the middest of unchaste Yongsters (a practice too common with our chaunting, dancing blushlesse females now) demeane themselves lasciviously and unseemely: sporting themselves with disorderly songs, obscene discourses, satanicall musicke, in honour, or rather to the dishonour of the new married Spouse. And dost thou yet inquire of me, whence adulterers, whence whoredomes, whence corruptions of marriages should proceed ? Lo here the effects of such scurrilous songs and dances. To which I shall here adde the saying of S. Valerian concerning such songs as these , in his 6. Homely, De Otiosis verbis. Bibliotheca Patrum. Tom . 5. pars 3\. pag . 482. 483. As oft (writes he) as the hearing is soothed with the pleasant voyce, so often the sight is invited to a filthy deed. Let no man trust these trecherous songs, nor looke backe to those incitations of a lustfull voyce; which rage whiles they delight, and kill when they flatter . Thus we often see Birds to be deceived with slattering whistels, and sottish wild beasts to be drawen into a snare of death by the sweetnesse of the voyce. Such, my beloved, is the case of mortall men, whom the care of pleasant songs sollicites. In this onely the varieties of voyces profit, and words drawen out at length by warblings without syllables, that a man may be either taken; or may take. It cannot be expressed, my beloved, what dangerous snares the studies of mimicall pleasure exhibite. For if any man could search out the secrets of mens brests, he should finde the hearts of unhappy men to sigh againe at every sound of the Flute. Understand therefore what over-familiar and secret speech may doe betweene men and women, what neere neighbourhood, what conferences mixed with iests, what a pallate invited with delight,; what the desire of gold exposed to every wickednesse of prostitution, if even the inticements of a dumbe voyce may charme the fury of another . This error therefore, of the sound of the voyce is to be avoyded, which hath wrought bitternes in the hearts of men by its sweetnesse, & by a certaine perswasion of a mellifluous song, hath oft- times ministred deadly poysons to the sicke. In which place the eares are first to be stopped, by opposing the Buckler of Faith, whereby the bearing of every voyce enticing unto lewdnesse may more easily be excluded. And discipline also is to be administred, which may repell the desires of the eyes, and may bridle the incitations of a consuming heart . To all which passages, I may ioyne that of S. Augustine, De Tempore Sermo . 215. Before all things, wheresoever you are, whether in a house, or in a iourney, or in a feast, or in a publike assembly, utter not yee out of your mouthes any scurrilous or voluptuous words; but rather cotinually, admonish your neighbours and friends, that they alwayes study to speake that which is honest and good, lest perchance by evill speaking, by dancing upon holy Festivals, and by singing luxurious ribaldry songs, they may seeme to inflict wounds upon themselves, even from whence they ought to have praysed God. For these unhappy and miserable men, who neither feare nor blush to exercise lascivious songs and dances before the very Temples of the Saints, although they should come Christians to the Church, yet they returne Pagans from the Church, because this custome of singing and dancing is but a relique of the observation of Pagans. And now behold what a Christian he is, who comes unto the Church to pray, and neglecting prayer, is not ashamed to utter the sacrilegious words of Pagans. Consider deare brethren, whether it be iust, that out of that mouth of Christians where the body of Christ doth enter in, a deboist song should be brought forth, as the very poyson of the Devill ? Wherefore (writeth he in another place) should we then walke delighted with vaine songs, that are profitable for nothing, being sweet onely for a time, but bitter afterwards? For with such scurrilities of songs the intised mindes of men are eff aeminated, and fall away from vertue, flowing downe into filthinesse, and for these very filthinesses they afterwards feele paines, and vomit up that againe with great bitternesse which they have drunke downe with temporall pleasure, &c. To which I may annex that Canon of the Roman Synode under Lotharius and Lodovicke: Let the Priests admonish men and women who meet together at Church on Holy-dayes, that they sing no filthy songs, nor lead nor keepe any dances: And that Constitution of Charles and Lodovicke: Let no man dance any filthy Dances or Carantoes, nor sing any dishonest riotous songs, nor use any such Diabolicall sports, either in the streets or in their houses . By all which you may easily discerne, what the Fathers iudged of amorous ribaldrous songs; which should cause all Christians, at leastwise to condemne them in their iudgements; as all these Fathers doe; if not to abandon them in their practice . To these Testimonies of the Fathers I might accumulate, not onely Plato , Seneca , Ovid , Horace , and other Pagan Authors, who condemne all amorous wanton Pastorals, as fit for none but Strumpets, and lewde lascivious effeminate persons : but likewise whole Volumes of moderne Authors; there being few Commentators on the Psalmes, upon Ephes . 4. 29, 30.  & 6\. 5. 3. 4. or upon Collos 4\. 6. Few Expositors on the 7\. Commandement : few Commonplace Compilers ; in their places or Titles, of Singing, Psalmes, Musicke, Iests, Scurrility, Modesty, Chastity , and the like: Few Writers, against Stage-playes ; but have particularly condemned these lascivious, amorous, ribaldrous Songs, (which are now too much in use) as Diabolicall , unchristian lust-exciting, vice-fomenting, soule- impoysoning pleasures, which all Christians should eternally abominate, as the very snares of Hell, the very plagues of that Common-weale wherein they are tollerated , and the very baites of Satan to draw men on to sinne, and so to endlesse destruction. Since therefore Stage-playes are evermore accompanied, adorned with such execrable unchristian Pastorals, Songs and Poems as these, (which I would wish all Christians, especially such as are most devoted to them, as they tender the everlasting welfare of their soules, even now for to abandon, for feare these momentary fading pleasures plunge them into many endlesse torments .) I must thereupon now conclude, as all the fore-going Fathers and Authors in the Major doe; that they must needs be sinfull, and altogether unlawfull unto Christians, as these their attendants are; which need no other aggravations to condemne them but themselves alone. Noscitur ex comite qui non cognoscitur ex se , was the ancient Proverbe. You may therefore iudge of Stage-playes, by these filthy Songs and Sonnets that accompany them; which Songs the very Title to our English singing Psalmes, commands all Christians to lay a part, as tending onely to the nourishing of vice, and corrupting of youth , with which I shall close this Scene. The third unlawfull Concomitant of Stage-playes, is effeminate, delicate, lust-provoking Musicke , as S. Basil phraseth it, which Christians ought to flie as a most filthy thing ; both because it workes upon their mindes, to corrupt them, upon their lusts, to provoke them to all voluptuousnesse and uncleanesse whatsoever. From whence this 25. Argument may be formed. That which is alwaies accompanied with effeminate lust-provoking Musicke, is doubtlesse inexpedient and unlawfull unto Christians. But Stage-playes are alwayes accompanied with such Musicke. Therefore they are doubtlesse inexpedient and unlawfull unto Christians. The Major is easily confirmed, by prooving effeminate lust-enflaming Musicke, unlawfull. That Musicke of it selfe is lawfull, usefull, and commendable; no man, no Christian dares denie, since the Scriptures , Fathers , and generally all Christian , all Pagan Authors extant, doe with one consent averre it . But that lascivious, amorous, effeminate, voluptuous Musicke, (which I onely here incounter,) should be either expedient, or lawfull unto Christians, there is none so audacious as to iustifie it, since both Scripture, Fathers, moderne Christian Writers; yea and Heathen Nations, States and Authors, have past a doome upon it. If we revolue the Fathers, we shall finde Clemens Alexandrinus declaiming thus against it. Those who are seriously occupied in musicke, songs and dances, and such like dissolute recreations, become immodest, insolent, and very farre estranged from good discipline, as those about whom cymbals and dulcimers are sounding, and the instruments of fraud making a noyse. But it mainly behoveth us to cut off every filthy spectacle, every dishonest sound, and to use but a word, every dishonest sence of intemperance, (which is verily a true privation of sence) that doth tickle or effeminate our eyes or eares, bewaring pleasure: For the various sorceries of effeminate songs, and of the mournfull measures of the Caricke Muse, corrupt the manners, with intemperate and wicked musicke, drawing men to the affection of riotous feasting. The Pipe therefore, the Flute and such like instruments are to be abandoned from a sober feast, which are more fit for beasts then men, and for those people who are most estranged from reason. But modest and chaste harmonies are to be admitted, by removing as farre as may be all soft effeminate musicke from our strong and valiant cogitation, which using a dishonest art of warbling the voyce, doe leade to a delicate and slothfull kinde of life. Therefore Chromaticall harmonies are to be left to impudent malapartnesse in wine, to whorish musicke crowned with flowers , Iustin Martyr , (if the Booke be his) writes thus to the selfesame purpose. It is not unlawfull, nor yet altogether unseemely for Boyes to sing; but to sing with inanimate instruments; to sing with dancing and cymbals; the use of which kinde of instruments, with others fit onely for Children, are exploded out of our Churches, where nothing is retained but singing onely. S. Hierem in his 10. Epistle to Furia. c . 4. writes thus. Let the Singer be thrust out of thine house as noxious: expell out of thy doores all Fidlers, Singing- women, with all this quire of the Devill, as the deadly songs of Syrens . And in his Commentary upon the Ephes. lib . 3. cap . 2. Tom . 6. pag 188\. A . Let Youthes heare these things; let those whose office it is to sing in the Church heare these things; that we must sing to God with the heart, not with the voyce; neither after the manner of Tragedians are the throate and chops to be anoynted with some pleasant oyntment, that theatrical songs & measures may be heard in the Church; but we must sing in feare, in worke, in the knowledge of the Scriptures. So let the Servat of Christ sing, that not the voyce of the Singer, but the words that are read may please: that the evill spirit which was in Saul may be cast out of those, who are possessed by him in the same manner, and that he may not be brought into those, who have made a Play-house of the House of God . And in his Commentary upon the 6\. of Amos. Tom . 5. p . 114. A . he writes thus. The lust of the pallate, and all variety of dainty meates is not sufficient, for you soothe your eares with the songs of the Pipe, the Psaltery, and the Harpe: and that which David hath made for the worship of God, finding out variety of Organs, and musicall instruments, you transfer to pleasure and luxury . S Valerian in his 6. Homely, De Otiosis Verbis. Bibl. Patrum. Tom . 5. pars 3\. pag . 482. 483. writes thus. We therefore oft-times finde a way to be fenced to incontinency, and fomentations to adulteries to be from hence administred, whiles this man playes on the sounding Citheren with a nimble quill, and another with a skilfull finger composeth the melodious inticements of the roaring Organs. These are the snares, by whose assistance, among other wounds the Devill workes the deathes of men, &c. S. Basil in his Commentary upon Esay 5\. Tom . 3. p . 419. 420. hath these ensuing passages, against Musicians, Songs, and Dances. Fidlers and Musicians, who passe the time of their flourishing age in villanies, together with Dances and songs drawne forth in publike by wicked persons, enervate the virility of mens bodies with their lewde inticements, and soothing their soules with that publike consort, doe breake thorow them, and stirre up Drunkards to the embracing of all filthy and unlawfull pleasure. Their eares are taken with the sweet harmony, but such as may pricke them on to a flagitious lubricity, &c. What a miserable Spectacle is it to chaste and wel-mannered eyes, to see a woman, not to follow her needle or distaffe, but to sing to a Lute? not to be knowne by her owne husband, but to be often veiwed by others as a publike whore: not to modulate or sing a Psalme of confession, but to sing songs inticing unto lust: not to supplicate to God, but willingly to hasten unto Hell: not to goe diligently to the Church of God, but to with-draw others with her selfe from thence, &c. With thee there lyeth a Lute interlaced and adorned with Gold or Elephants tooth, a Demoniacall Statue and Idoll, fastned at it were to some high; Altar and a certaine miserable woman, who by reason of the necessity of her servile condition, should apply her selfe to her distaffe, is taught of thee, perchance an hireling, perchance of one who shall deliver her over to some Bawde or prostituted Whore; afterwards when she hath satisfied all the lust in her owne body, she is set over other yong Girles, as a Mistris of the like actions. Wherefore in the day of iudgement; a double punishment shall seise upon thee; both for those wickednesses thou committest when thou art drunke, and likewise for thy wicked doctrine whereby thou hast quite alienated an unhappy soule from God, &c. Of those arts which depend vpon the studie of vanity, whether it be the art of Musicke, of Dancing, of sounding Pipes, or such like, as soone as the action it selfe hath ceased, the worke it selfe declareth it selfe, and that altogether according to the Apostles sentence; whose end is destruction and perdition: Let these things suffice to be spoken against those who thorow overmuch effeminacy give themselves wholy over to delights, and that continually; Or else against those who in the dayes of mirth or gladnesse suppose of marriages or feasts, doe more diligently procure Waites, Musicke, rounds and dancing, when as none of these is required of us: who have learned by the teaching of the Scripture, that the wrath of God is bent against all such studies and conversation of life. Therefore for feare of imminent evill from hence-forth amend this wicked customs of your life . Thus farre this Father, who in his Sermon, De Legendis Libris Gentilium, & De Ebrietate & Luxu, & Hexaemeron, Hom . 4. hath other passages to this purpose. To passe by Chrysostome , who writes; that Cymbals, Pipes, and filthy Songs are the very pomps and hodgpotch of the Devill , together with our ancient learned Country-man Alchuvinus ; who reckons up shrill, wanton amorous musicke, which doth oft-times mollisie and effeminate the vigor of Christians, among those pomps of the Devill, which Christians in their Baptisme doe renounce . S. Cyrill of Alexandria affirmes; That where there is the sound of the Harpe, the beating of Cymbals, the consort of Fidlers, with the concinnity of numbers and applauses, there also is all kinde of filthinesse; and those things are done of these in private, which is even unseemely for to utter. Gregory Naziezzen records, that the Christians in his time had no dancing, no idle Songs, or wanton Musicke in their publike feasts and solemnities; but onely Psalmes and spirituall Songs with which they praysed God. And Epiphanius in his Compendiaria Doctrina, De fide Catholica & Apostolica Ecclesiae ; ascertaines us; that the whole Catholicke and Apostolicke Church , condemned Theaters, Playes and Musicians. Eusebius and Damascen, as they declaime against wanton Musicke, songs, and dancing ; so they pronounce an woe against all such who play upon the Harper or Citharen on the Lords-day; comparing a Fidler that playes to Dancers, to a Devill . A harsh comparison, enough to scare such from their ungodly trade. Saint Augustine in his first Booke, De Musica. from c . 1. to 8\. declaimes against all wanton, effeminate, amorous, Stage-musicke: which was much in use with Players, who were commonly bad, not good, Musicians in his age: and that Musicke he most discommends which was accompanied with Playes or lascivious dancing. The 3\. Synode of Turvy under Charles the Great. Canon 7\. condemnes effeminate Musicke in these termes: The Ministers of God ought to abstaine from all things which pertaine to the enticements of the eares or eyes, from whence the vigor of the minde may be thought to be effeminated: which may be imagined of certaine kindes of Musicke. &c. Which severall Authorities are a sufficient testimony of the unlawfulnesse of effeminate, amorous, wanton Musicke. Which as it is discommendable in Feasts and merry meetings, so much more in Churches. Hence is that notable passage of Aelredus , Abbot of Rivaulx in Yorke-shire , about the yeere 1160. in his Speculum Charitatis. lib . 2. cap . 23. Bibl. Patrum. Tom . 13. pag . 111. Let me speake now (faith he) of those, who under the shew of religion doe obpalliate the businesse of pleasure: which usurpe those things for the service of their vanity, which the ancient Fathers did profitably exercise, in their types of future things. Whence then I pray, all types and figures now ceasing, whence hath the Church so many Organs and Musicall Instruments? To what purpose, I demand, is that terrible blowing of Belloes, expressing rather the crackes of Thunder, then the sweetnesse of a voyce? To what purpose serves that contraction and inflection of the voyce? This man sings a base, this a small meane, another a treble, a fourth divides and cuts assunder, as it were, certaine middle notes. One while the voyce is strained, anon it is remitted, now againe it is dashed, and then againe it is inlarged with a lowder sound. Sometimes, which is a shame to speake, it is enforced into an horses neighings; sometimes, the masculine vigor being laid aside, it is sharpned into the shrilnesse of a womans voyce: now and then it is wrethed, and retorted with a certaine artificiall circumvolution. Sometimes thou mayest see a man with an open mouth, not to sing; but as it were to breath out his last gaspe, by shutting in his breath, and by a certaine ridiculous interception of his voyce. as it were to threaten silence, and new againe to imitate the agonies of a dying man, or the extasies of such as suffer. In the meane time the whole body is stirred up and downe with certaine histrionical gestures: the lips are wreathed; the eyes turne round, the shoulders play; and the bending of the fingers doth answer every note. And this ridiculous dissolution is called religion; and where these things are most frequently done, it is proclaimed abroad that God is there more honourably served . In the meane time the common people standing by, trembling and astonished, admire the sound of the Organs, the noyse of the Cymbals and musicall instruments, the harmony of the Pipes and Cornets: but yet looke upon the lasccivious gesticulations of the Singers, the meretricious alternations, interchanges, and infractions of the voyces, not without dirision and laughter: so that a man may thinke that they came, not to an Oratory, or house of prayer, but to a Theater; not to pray, but to gaze about them: neither is that dreadfull maiesty feared before whom they stand, &c. Thus this Church singing, which the holy Fathers have ordained that the weake might be stirred up to piety, is perverted to the use of unlawfull pleasure, &c. Thus this ancient English Abbot, whom Iohn Saresbury another ancient English Writer, about the yeere of our Lord 1140. doth second in these words, in his First Booke, De Nugis Curialium . cap. 6.

Our learned Country-man Thomas Beacon , in his authorized Reliques of Rome. cap . 37. 38. Of Plain-song, Prick-song, Descant, and Singing in the Church , Writes thus: That Pope Vitalian being a lusty Singer, and fresh couragious Musician himselfe, was the first that brought Prick-song, Descant, and all kinde of pleasant melody into the Church; in the yeere 653\. And because nothing should want to delight the vaine foolish and idle eares of fond fantasticall men, he ioyned the Organs to the curious Musicke. Thus was Pauls preaching, and Peters praying, turned into vaine singing, and childish playing, unto the great losse of time, and unto the utter undooing of Christian mens soules, which liue not by singing and piping, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God . Franciscus Petrarcha, in his Booke , De Remedijs utriusque Fortun ae (saith he) declareth: that S . Athanasius did utterly forbid singing to be used in the Church at Service time, because he would put away all lightnesse and vanity, which by the reason of singing doth oftentimes arise in the mindes, both of the Singers and of the Hearers . S. Hierom, reproved not onely the lewde fashion of the singing men in his time, but also their manner of singing: when notwithstanding if the singing used in his time were compared with that minsed musicke which now beareth chiefe rule in Churches, it might seeme very grave, modest, and tolerable; and ours so light, vaine, madde, fond, foolish and fantasticall, that Hickscorner himselfe could not devise a more wanton pastime . Then he recites some passages out of Hierom, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, Gregory, Chrysostome, and Iustinian, against such curious Prick-song, and melodious singing in Churches, in which plaine singing only, which every man may understand, and which is in a manner nothing else but plaine reading, ought to be used . And then hee concludes the Chapter with these Authorities . Gulielmus Durandus saith, that the use of singing was ordained for carnall and fleshly men, and not for spirituall and godly minded men . Polidorus Vergilius writeth on this manner. How greatly that ordinance of singing brought into the Church by Pope Damasus and S. Ambrose began even in those dayes to be profitable, S. Austen declareth evidently in the Booke of his Confessions: where he asketh forgivenesse of God because he had given more heed, and better eare to the singing, then to the weighty matter of the holy Words. But now adayes, saith Polydor, it appeareth evidently, that it is much lesse profitable for our Common-wealth, seeing our Singers make such a chattering charme in the Temples, that nothing can be heard but the voyce: and they that are present (they are present so many as are in the City.) being content with such a noyse as delights their eares, care nothing at all for the vertue, pith, or strength of the words : so that now it is come to this point, that with the common sort of people all the worshipping of God seemeth to be set in these singsters, although there is generally no kinde of people more light nor more lewde. And yet the greater part of the people for to heare them, boing, bleating and yelling, flocke into the Churches as into a common Game-place. They hire them with money, they cherish and feed them; yea, to be short, they thinke them alone to be the precious Iewels and Ornaments of Gods house, &c. Wherefore without doubt, it were bitter for Religion to cast out of the Churches such chattering and iangling Iayes, or else so to appoint them, that when they sing, they should rather rehearse the songs after the manner of such as reade, then follow the fashion of chattering Charmers: which thing S . Austen in his foresaid Booke doth witnesse, that S . Athanasius Bishop of Alexandria, did in his Diocesse, and he commendeth him greatly for it . Cornelius Agrippa writeth of singing in Churches in this manner , Athanasius did forbid singing in his Churches because of the vanity thereof: but Ambrose as one more desirous of Ceremonies and pompe, ordained the use of singing and making melody in Churches . Austen as a man indifferent betwixt both, in his Booke De Confessionibus, granteth that by this meanes he was in a great perplexity and doubt concerning this matter. But now adayes Musicke is growne to such and so great licentiousnesse, that even at the ministration of the holy Sacrament, all kinde of wanton and lewde trifling Songs, with piping of Organs have their place and course. As for the Divine Service and Common prayer, it is so chaunted and minsed, and mangled, of our costly hired, curious, and nice Musitions (not to instruct the audience withall, nor to stirre up mens mindes unto devotion, but with a whorish harmony to tickle their eares:) that it may iustly seeme, not to be a noyse made of men, but rather a bleating of bruite beasts; whiles the Coristers ney descant as it were a sort of Colts; others bellowe a tenour, as it were a company of Oxen: others bark[illeg.]a counter-point, as it were a kennell of Dogs: others rore out a treble like a sort of Buls: others grunt out a base as it were a number of Hogs; so that a foule evill favoured noyse is made, but as for the words and sentences, and the very matter it selfe is nothing understanded at all; but the authority and power of iudgement is taken away, both from the minde and from the eares utterly . Erasmus Roterodamus expresseth his minde concerning the curious manner of singing used in Churches, on this wise, and saith, Why doth the Church doubt to follow so worthy an Author (Paul?) yea, how dare it be bold to dissent from him. What other thing is heard in Monasteries, in Colledges, in Temples almost generally, then a confused noyse of voyces? But in the time of Paul, there was no singing but saying onely. Singing was with great difficulty received of them of the latter time; and yet such singing as was none other thing, then a distinct and plaine pronunciation, even such as we have yet among us, when we sound the Lords prayer in the holy Canon, and the tongue wherein those things were sung, the common people did then understand, and answered , Amen. But now, what other thing doth the common people heare than voyces signifying nothing? And such for the most part is the pronunciation, that not so much as the words or voyces are heard: onely the sound beateth the eares . Thus farre this worthy ancient English Professor, Thomas Beacon , and his alleaged Authors: to which I shall adde that notable passage to the like purpose, in the second part of the Homely of the Place and time of Prayer. Finally Gods vengeance hath beene and is daily provoked, because much wicked people passe nothing to resort to the Church; either for that they are so sore blinded, that they understand nothing of God or godlinesse, or else for that they see the Church altogether scoured of all such gazing sights as their phantasie was greatly delighted with &c. which seemes an unsavoury thing to their unsavoury taste, as may appeare by this, that a woman said to her neighbour. Alas Gossip, what shall we now doe at Church, since all the Saints are taken away; since all the goodly sights we were wont to have, are gone; since we cannot heare the like piping, singing, chaunting, and playing on the Organs ( brought first into England by Pope Agatha , about the yeere 679.) that we could before. But (dearely beloved) we ought greatly to reioyce, & give God thankes, that our Churches are delivered out of all these things which displeased God so sore, and filthily defiled his holy House and his place of Prayer, for the which he hath iustly destroyed many Nations, &c. Effeminate wanton accurate musicke then, by the verdict of these severall Authors and of our owne Homelies, is altogether dispeasing unto God, corrupts his worship, and filthily defiles his holy House, &c. therefore it must needs bee evill.

Decretum, De observandis & evitandis in celebratione Missae ; decreed, that all impure, lascivious, amorous, secular Songs and Musicke, sauouring of levity and folly, should be excluded the Church, because they did effeminate the lascivious mindes of the people, and provoke them unto lust; not excite or stirre them up to devotion and compunction, as all Church Musicke ,( which should be grave, and serious) ought to doe . If therefore we give any credit to these recited Authorities; to Osorius, De Regum Institutione. lib . 4. fol . 120. to 126\. who largely declaimes against amorous delicious Songs and Musicke as so many enchaunting Syrens; which draw men on to idlenesse, effeminacy, luxury, and a kind of wanton dissolutenesse, to the corruption of their manners, of their mindes, and the perdition of their soules : Or to sundry other Christian Authors which I spare to mention, in their Expositions and Commentaries on the 7. Commandement: on Esay 5\. 11. 12.  & 24.9. Amos 6\. 1. to 8\. Iob 21\. 12. 13. Exod . 32. 18. 19. and the Booke of Psalmes ; my Major must be granted. But I passe from these to Pagans. It is storied of the ancient Ægyptians; that they condemned Musicke, not onely as unprofitable, but as noxious too, because they were perswaded, it would enervate the vigor of mens mindes: which caused them to enact a kinde of law; that their Children should for this cause learne no Musicke . Not to record the singular opinion of Ephorus; who writes; that Musicke was invented onely to deceive men ; It is registred of Alcibiades, that he reiected delicious Musicke as unworthy any ingenuous person : Of Ateas, a Scythian King; that when he heard Ismenia an accurate Musician, playing with great applause and admiration of others; he replyed, that the neighing of an Horse was much more pleasing and delightfull to him : And of Diogones Cinnicus; that he neglected Musicke as an unprofitable, needlesse, uselesse thing . But these perchance are over- rigorous, and lesse proper for our present purpose; I therefore passe to more punctuall witnesses. It is storied of the Lacedemonians, that though they approved of plaine, of grave and modest; yet they utterly exploded all effeminate, light, new-fangled harmonies; for the practise of which Terpander and Timotheus, were fined and censured by their Ephori . Polibius a grave Historian; condemnes all amorous, lascivious harmonies, together with the use of musicke for effeminate or voluptuous ends . Plato, though he approves of Musicke, yet he exiles all loose unmanly, voluptuous wanton Lydian or Ionicke Harmonies and Musicions; together with all musicall Instruments of many strings; as being a meanes to effeminate mens mindes, corrupt their manners, abate their courage, consume their time; and to draw them on to idlenesse and voluptuous living ; with whom Aristotle and Socrates concurre upon the selfe-same grounds . Salust and Iustin, have both long since condemned lascivious Musicke and Dancing, as the instruments of luxury . Ovid and Athen aeus, two great Patriots of Musicke, have notwithstanding censured effeminate accurate Songs and Harmonies, as emasculating the virility, and unbending the sinewes of mens mindes, making them of Courteous, effeminate; of temperate, intemperate; of valiant, unmanly persons: whence they advise men to abandon them . When the Lydians had revolted from Cyrus, and taken up Armes against him King Cresus advised him this course, to keepe them in subiection for future times : viz. To prohibit them the use of Armes; to cause them to traine up their Children to effeminate Songs and Musicke: and then, O King, saith he, their men will soone degenerate into women, so that thou needest not then to feare any rebellion; which fell out accordingly. For when as Cyrus had conquered them, he put this counsell into execution ; by meanes of which, this industrious mighty warlike Nation, became effeminate and riotous, and so quite degenerated from their former valour. By which experimentall example, and the fore-alleadged testimonies, it is most apparent; that effeminate accurate lust-provoking Musicke, (especially in publike meetings, feasts and Enterludes , where other concurrent circumstances confederate with it, to poast men on to sinfull actions; in which cases the Scriptures most condemne it :) must undoubtedly bee utterly unlawfull unto Christians, in regard of the fore-named lewde effects which issue from it: and so by consequence must Playes be too, which are either compounded of it, or attended with it. For the Minor, that Stage-playes (which have all other inescating lust- inflaming sollicitations accompanying them, that either human pravity, or Satans pollicy can invent) are attended with such lascivious amorous Musicke, which is apt to captivate mens chastity , and foment their lusts; it is more then evident; not onely by moderne experience, (our Play-houses resounding alwayes with such voluptuous Melody;) but likewise by the suffrage of sundry Pagan and Christian Authors, both ancient and moderne.

All which, with infinite others , largely ratifie the truth of this Assumption; that Playes are alwayes accompanied with most effeminate, amorous, lust-provoking Musicke, which depraves mens mindes and manners : therefore both it and the Conclusion resulting from it, must be granted. The last unlawfull Concomitant of Stage-playes, is, profuse lascivious laughter, accompanied with an immoderate applause of those scurrilous Playes and Actors, which Christians should rather abominate, then admire. From whence this 26. Argument against Stage-playes, may be framed. That which is alwaies accompanied with profuse lascivious laughter , with immoderate sinfull applauses of Playes and infamous Actors, which Christians should abhorre, must certainely be unlawfull unto Christians. But Stage-playes are alwayes accompanied with such laughter and applauses. Therefore they must certainely bee unlawfull unto Christians. The Major I shall evidence, by proving such laughter, such applauses to be sinfull. That profuse lascivious laughter, especially such as is occasioned by Stage-playes, is evill, it is most apparant. First, in regard of the originall efficient cause of it, which is commonly some obscene, lascivious sinfull passage, gesture, speech, or iest, (the common obiect of mens hellish mirth) which should rather provoke the Actors, the Spectators to penitent sobs, then wanton smiles; to brinish teares, then carnall solace, which suite not with such sinfull obiects ; as Nazienzen , Chrysostome , and Antonius Laurentius well observe. It is recorded of Lot , that he vexed his righteous soule from day to day, in seeing and hearing the unlawfull filthy deeds and conversation of the wicked Sodomites . Of David ; that rivers of teares ran downe his eyes, because men kept not Gods Law . Of Ieremiah , that his heart did bleed in secret, his eyes weepe sore and trickle downe with teares, for the iniquities of his people . Of Paul ; that he seriously bewayled the unlamented, unrepented sinne of the incestuous Corinthian. Of Ezra , that he humbled himselfe, and rent his cloathes, and mourned and wept exceedingly for the Israelites sinne in marrying with Idolaters . And of all the faithfull of Ierusalem, that they sighed and cryed for all the abominations that were committed in the middest thereof . Yea, God himselfe enioynes his servants, to mourne for others finnes : to turne their sinfull laughter into heavinesse; and their carnall ioy (arising from lascivious objects) into mourning: effulminating an everlasting woe, a dismall curse against all such gracelesse fooles, who make a mocke of sinne, or recreate themselves with the iniquities of other men . That Play- house laughter then which ariseth from such filthy scurrilous objects, must needs be evill, discovering nothing but a gracelesse heart; delighting onely in ribaldry, in uncleanesse ; whereas all Christians , must reioyce in God alone , not in the Devill, not in sinfull pleasures , which are but for a season . Secondly, it must needs be sinfull in regard of its excesse, it being altogether boundlesse beyond the rules of modesty, temperance, christianity, sobriety, by which it should be regulated. Theatricall laughter knowes neither bounds, nor measure; men wholly resigne and let loose the reines of their hearts unto it, glutting, nay tyring their sides and spirits with it: the dissolute profusenesse of it therefore makes it evill . Thirdly, the end of Play-house laughter, is onely to satiate mens fleshly lusts with secular iollity and delights of sinne: to pamper, to arme the rebellious flesh against the Spirit : to quench those heauenly ioyes, and spirituall comforts which should ravish Christian soules: to exile all true repentance, all godly sorrow and sound humiliation for sinne, which are altogether incompatible with these lascivious smiles : to put the evill day farre off from men, by stupifying their selfe-condemning consciences , and lulling them fast a sleepe in a most desperate carnall security. Such is the use, the fruite of this Stage-laughter: it cannot therefor but be evill. Fourthly, this laughter is altogether unseemely, unseasonable unto Christians . Vnseemely, because immoderate: profuse excessive laughter , (especially at the sight or hearing of a ribaldrous Stage-play,) is altogether inconsistent with the gravity, modesty, and sobriety of a Christian, whose affections should be more sublime, more serious and composed, then to be immoderately tickled with meere lascivious vanities, or to lash out into excessive cachinnations in the publike view of dissolute gracelesse persons, who will be hardned and encouraged in their lascivious courses, by their ill example . Vnseasonable; because this is no place, no time, no world for Christians to laugh or to be merry in: but to bewaile their owne and others sinnes, that so they may escape the eternall torments of them at the last . Our Saviour, whose doctrine no Christian dares controll, hath denounced an woe, to all those that laugh, that live in ease, iollity, and carnall pleasures now, because they shall certainely mourne, and suffer eternall torments for it hereafter ; informing all his Children ( whose ioyes are treasured up in heaven against another day ) that in this world they shall be sure to suffer persecution and affliction , to weepe, lament, and be sorrowfull: and that this world onely (who have their portion in this life) shall now reioyce ; that is, in a carnall worldly manner: whereupon he adviseth all his followers, to turne their secular laughter into mourning, their carnall iollity into weeping and heavinesse ; For Christians therefore to make this world a paradice of all earthly pleasures, to spend their dayes in Epicurisme, mirth and iollity, glutting themselves with sinfull Spectacles and mirth-provoking Enterludes, as alas two many doe: to be like Democritus, alwayes laughing, never weeping , unlesse it be sometimes against their wils, and then not for their sinnes: to be most unlike their blessed Saviour , who was oft-times weeping, never smiling that we read of. Quem flevisse legimus risisse non legimus : how can it but be sinfull, yea abominable? Christ Iesus our patterne, our example, whose steps we all must follow, if ever we expect salvation from him ; was alwayes mourning, never laughing ; (I am sure not at a Stage-play, which hee and his condemne, as worthy teares, not smiles,) and shall we doe nothing but reioyce ? The Apostles and Christians in the Primitive Church, yea all the Saints of God who went before us, were for the most part weepers , not laughers; deploring among sundry other evils, those execrable abominations which Stage-playes did produce . And shall we be alwaies laughing nay laughing at these filthy Enterludes which they so much bewailed? Is this to imitate Christ or his Apostles : to live like Saints, like Christians, like men redeemed from the world? Is this to participate with Christ in his afflictions; or to trace the narrow uncouth way that leades to endlesse ioyes ? O no! this carnall life of iollity, prognosticks nothing but a voluptuous heart, a Godlesse, Christlesse conversation, which leades men downe to Hell: needs therefore must it be unlawfull unto Christians . Fiftly, this profuse Theatricall laughter doth give a publike approbation to all the ribaldry and prophanesse that is either personated or perpetrated on the Stage , and so makes these laughers deepely guilty of it . Sixtly, it produceth sundry sinfull consequents: as cachinnations, clamors, impudency , effeminacy, incivility, voluptuousnesse, loosenesse and lightnesse of spirit, impenitency, carnall security, indisposition to every holy duty; especially to godly sorrow for sinne : therefore it cannot but be evill. Peruse we but the Scriptures; we shall finde them much condemning this excessive carnall laughter , (especially at vaine, at sinfull objects) as misbeseeming Christians .

If any censure these as more then puritanically rigid in this point of laughter, let them hearken what some Pagan Authors have resolved of it, whom none dare tax of Puritanisme. No man (writes Plato) ought to be affected with the desire of laughter. For the affectation of profuse laughter seekes a very vehement change. Neither is it to be endured, that any one should make memorable men to exceed in laughter, much lesse the Gods. Isocrates adviseth Demonicus; neither to love petulant laughter, neither to approve of insolent speech; because the one savours of folly, the other of madnesse: to carry a grave, not an austere countenance; because the one is attributed to insolency, the other to prudence. Seneca , makes immodest laughter, an undoubted character of a wicked man. Catullus , as wanton a Poet as any, records; That there is nothing more unseemely then wanton foolish laughter. Among the ancient Persians it was utterly unlawfull to laugh openly in a loude or dissolute manner . And if Æ lian may be credited; in the Vniversity of Athens it was unlawfull for any to laugh, especially in a profuse ridiculous immodest fashion . The very Heathens then as is evident by these and sundry other testimonies , condemned loude excessive laughter. If such laughter then as this, was altogether unseemely for modest Pagans, must not our publike infamous Play- house cachinnations, be much more unsuitable for sober Christians ? No Christian I presume dares once deny it. Our Stage-playes therefore which occasion, which procoke such profuse lascivious laughter, must questionlesse be evill : as Ephes .5.3.4. with all ancient and moderne Commentators on it will more largely testifie. Secondly, as the laughter, so the publike Theatricall Applauses which attend these Enterludes, are evill. First, because they give a publike iustification, not onely to Stage-playes and Actors , exploded by the Church of God from age to age; but even to all the wickednesse, the lasciviousnesse that attends them, to all the villany and lewdnesse that is produced by them . He who upon a Players or Play-Poets Plaudite , gives any publike acclamation, any applause unto the Play, or Actors, approves both Play and Players, with all their sinfull passages. Speeches, gestures, and pernicious consequents, and saith Amen unto them: A dangerous fearefull sinne, which makes men an abomination to the Lord, and drawes downe a dismall woe upon their heads because it iustifieth the wickednesse of the wicked, calling evill good, and darknesse light; putting bitter for sweet, and vice for vertue , as all Theatricall Applauses doe. Secondly, they interest men in the guilt and punishment of all those iniquities, that are either acted or committed in, or occasioned by these Stage-playes , by giving publike and reall approbation to them. Thirdly, they barden, they animate both Play-poets, Players, and Play-haunters in their ungodly courses, which perchance they would relinquish were they not encouraged in them by these vaine Applauses. Fourthly, if we believe Tertullian, these Applauses so pollute mens hands, that they can neither lift them up to God in prayer, nor yet stretch them out to receive the Sacrament in an holy manner . God requires Christians, to lift up holy hands to him in prayer : to bring cleansed, washed, pure hands and hearts unto his Sacraments, not tainted with the filth of any sinne . Now Stage-applauses defile mens hands and hearts, making them so polluted, that they can neither lift them up in holy prayers to their holy God (who can endure no iniquity, nor the touch of any thing that is uncleane ;) nor yet extend them to embrace Christs sacred Body and Blood, without defilement. These Stage-applauses therefore must needs be sinfull in all these respects, as Tertullian , Cyprian , Nazienzen , Ensebius , Chrysostome , Augustine , Salvian , with Sundry moderne Christian Authors , have already doomed them to our hands. For the Minor; that Stage playes are alwayes attended with such laughter and applauses, it is most apparant. First, by experience, which infallibly informes men, that Stage-playes have evermore superabounded with obstreperous wanton cachinnations, acclamations, applauses , misbeseeming modest persons, much more religious Christians. Secondly, by the very end of mens pretended resort to Stage-playes: For what other use doe our most rigid Play-patrons ascribe to Stage-playes , but to exhilerate the Spectators, by provoking them to laughter . Or what other pretence have Play-haunters for their resort to Play-houses; (though many of them ayme at far more sinister respects ) but to passe away the time in mirth? to laugh till their sides doe ake againe, at the Clownes behaviour, or some other merry iests and passages; or to applaud the Playes, the parts, the Actors which affect them? Thirdly, by the Plandite , which is commonly affixed as a period to most ancient and moderne Playes: at the pronunciation of which, the people, if they like the Play, are wont to clap their hands, and give a publike acclamation, or Amen, as the practice of former and present times doth manifest . Lastly, by the concurring testimony of Pagans, Fathers, and moderne Christian Authors; who all affirme, that Stage-playes not onely occasion, but are likewise attended with profuse exorbitant laughter, acclamations and applauses ; In which regard, the Fathers and moderne Christian Authors much condemne them. For Pagan Authorities; if you peruse but Athen aeus. Dipnos. lib. 6\. cap . 6. who there informes us out of Theophrastus, that the Terynthians, who were very studious of iesting Comedies, were so accustomed to laugh at Playes, that they could not forbeare laughter in their solemne sacrifices, nor their most serious affaires .

De Plausu, Sibilo, Clamoribus & acclamationibus Theatri : with sundry others formerly quoted to this purpose. pag . 30. 31. will sufficiently satisfie any that doubt of my Assumpsions truth. Since then it is evident by all these testimonies, that Stage-playes do occasion, doe abound with such laughter, such applauses , as I have here evinced to be evill and misbeseeming Saints, I may well conclude; that Stage-playes even in this regard, and in respect of all the fore-going particulars, in the precedent Act, are utterly unlawfull unto Christians; which should cause them wholy to abandon them. Fiftly, as Stage-playes are sinfull and so unlawfull unto Christians in all the fore-mentioned regards, so likewise are they in respect of severall pernicious effects , and dangerous fruits, which usually, if not necessarily and perpetually issue from them; the chiefest of which I shall here enumerate in their order; that so you may more evidently discerne the badnesse of them, by the sundry evils they occasion. The first of these, is the prodigall mispence of much precious time, which Christians should husband and redeeme to better purposes : From whence this 27. Argument against Stage-playes may be composed. That which doth alwaies unavoydably produce an intollerable mispence of much peerelesse time, which should be carefully improved and redeemed , must certainely be sinfull, and so unlawfull unto Christians. But this doe Stage-playes; as I shall fully manifest. Therefore they must certainely be sinfull, and so unlawfull unto Christians. The Major all men must subscribe to; because God himselfe commands us, not prodigally to waste but wisely to redeeme the time, and so much the rather, [illeg.]ause the dayes are evill . Our time , it is our richest treasure , it is that peerelesse portion which God himselfe hath put into our hands; that we might improve it to his glory, to our owne and others good ; not sinfully consume it upon lascivious childish Enterludes, vanities, or delights of sinne ; which bring nothing but eternall horror to mens soules at last . For men, for Christians then, to cast this unvaluable Pearle of precious time to Swine ; to disburse this treasure for that which is not bread, this money for that which satisfieth not: to waste this royall patrimony upon voluptuous spectacles , or lewde ridiculous Pastimes: to trifle it quite away upon the very vainest vanities (as alas too many doe, who treasure up nothing but eternall wrath and horror to their soules, against the day of wrath ,) how can it but be sinfull? Our dayes, yea every houre and minute of our lives, are Gods, not ours: they are those precious talents which God hath put into our hands to occupy with them till he come : to him must we give up our account for the imployment of them at the last . And can we then take Gods time, Gods treasure (allowed onely to us for his use, his service, which is abundantly sufficient to engrosse even al our dayes ,) and spend it wholly upon sinne? upon Satan? upon our owne carnall lusts and pleasures ? upon lascivious Stage-playes, Games, and Sports? upon Dicing, Carding, Dancing, Drinking, Whoring, Feasting ? upon idle Visits, Complements and Discourses? upon Meretricious Paintings, Frizlings, Pouldrings, Attyrings, and the like, (in which many squonder away their very choicest morning houres, more fit for study  & devotion then such unchristian practises,) as if we had no God to serve, no callings to follow, no soules to save, no Hell to feare , no Heaven to seeke, no Iudge to censure us, no day of Iudgement to account in, how we have spent our time? and yet flatter our selves so grosly, as to presume we have done full well , at least-wise not offended, in this profuse mispending of our Masters stocke of time? Alas, how many millions of pounds; how many myriades of Kingdomes, nay of Worlds (were they but Masters of them) would many thousand damned spirits, now in torments, or voluptuous distressed persons now lying on their death- beds, ready to breathe out their soules at every breath into the infernall Tophet , give, for the moitie, the tythe, yea the very smallest quantity of that unvaluable time which they have irrecoverably spent on Playes , and such like sinfull Pastimes; that so they might in time bewaile with brinish teares, with dolorous pangs, and deepest sighes, the losse of all those houres which they have prodigally spent in Play-houses , Tavernes, and such life-devouring places, to prevent or else extenuate the intollerable horror of their eternall paines? And shall wee then squander away, we care not how, those pretious houres, which these, which wee our selves perchance hereafter (though now we value them at so low a price, as to play them quite away for nought ) would willingly repurchase at the dearest rate, on vaine lascivious Stage-playes, toyes, and childish vanities, as if we were created only to play and follow sports (which Tully and other Pagans quite deny) and yet thinke to scape unpunished? Those Playes and Pastimes therefore, which miserably waste and eate out all our dayes, which rob us of our pretious time (our chiefe, our onely ireasure,) which we should carefully husband to our good : Which sacrilegiously defraud our God, our Country, our Soules, our Callings of sundry vacant houres which should be spent upon them, must needs be evill and unlawfull unto Christians even in this respect. For the Minor, that Stage-playes unavoydably produce an intollerable mispence of much pretious time &c. it is most apparant, if we will but summe up all those dayes, those houres which are vainely spent in the composing, conning, practising, acting, beholding of every publike, or private Stage-play. How many golden dayes and houres, I might say weekes, nay moneths, and I had almost said whole yeeres, doe most Play-poets spend in contriving, penning, polishing their new-invented Playes, before they ripen them for the Stage ? When these their Playes are brought unto maturity, how many houres, evenings, halfe-dayes, dayes, and sometimes weekes, are spent by all the Actors (especially in solemne academicall Enterludes) in coppying , in conning, in practising their parts , before they are ripe for publike action? When this is finished, how many men are vainely occupied for sundry dayes (yea sometimes yeeres) together, in building Theaters, Stages, Scenes and Scaffolds ; in making theatricall Pageants, Apparitions, Attires, Visars, Garments, with such-like Stage-appurtenances, for the more commodious pompous acting and adorning of these vaine-glorious Enterludes? When all things requisite for the publike personating of these Playes are thus exactly accommodated, and the day or nigh approcheth when these are to be acted, how many hundreds of all sorts , vainely, if not ridiculously spend whole dayes, whole afternoones and nights oft-times, in attyring themselves in their richest robes ; in providing seates to heare, to see, and to be seene of others ; or in hearing, in beholding these vain lascivious Stage-playes, ( which last some three or foure houres at the least, yea sometimes whole dayes and weekes together, as did some Roman Playes , and yet seeme to short to many, to whom a Lecture, a Sermon, a Prayer, not halfe so long, is over- tedious:) who thinke themselves well imployed all the while they are thus wasting, this their pretious time (which they scarce know how to spend) upon these idle Spectacles . Adde we to this, that all our common Actors consume not onely weekes and yeeres, but even their whole lives , in learning, practising, or acting Playes, which besides nights and other seasons, engrosse every afternoone almost thorowout the yeere, to their peculiar service; as wee see by daily experience here in London ; where thousands spend the moitie of the day, the weeke, the yeere in Play-houses, at least-wise far more houres, then they imploy in holy duties, or in their lawfull callings. If we annex to this, the time that divers waste in reading Play-bookes, which some make their chiefest study, preferring them before the Bible, or all pious Bookes, on which they seldome seriously cast their eyes; together with the mispent time which the discourses of Playes, either seene or read, occasion: and then summe up all this lost, this mispent time together; we shall soone discerne, we must needs acknowledge, that there are no such Helluoes, such Canker-wormes, such theevish Devourers of mens most sacred ( yet undervalued) time , as Stage- Playes.

Hence Basil, Hexa emeron. Hom. 4\. informes us: That there are certaine Citties, which feed their eyes and eares from morning to night, with many various Spectacles, and with effeminate amorous lascivious Songs and Enterludes, engendring an excesse of lusts within their soules, in hearing of which their eares are never satisfied. And such people as these (writes he) many call exceeding happy, because neglecting and setting aside the care of government, merchandize, their trades, and all other imployments whereby they may get their living; they spend the time of life alotted to them with exceeding idlenesse and pleasure .

And withall they much complaine; that many people leaving the Church did flocke by troopes to Play-houses, bestowing that time upon the Devill, which they should have dedicated unto God ; Hence Augustine.

To omit all others which I shall name hereafter, have censured and rejected Stage-playes, (in the hearing, reading, and beholding of which, many spend whole dayes, whole weekes, whole yeeres) as the over-prodigall devourers of much peerelesse time, which they most iniuriously steale from God, from men, and from the Common-weale. Since therefore our lives are exceeding short and momentary, posting away with winged speed ; our time so pretious ; the duties of our generall, our particular callings ( which may not be omitted for feare the Devill finde [illeg.] idle , and so tempt us unto sinne) almost infinite, well able to engrosse even all our vacant houres; the mispence, the losse of time so dangerous, so pernicisus : the grand account we must shortly render of all the ill-spent minutes of our lives before the Barre of Gods Tribunall, so certaine, terrible and inevitable , these time-devouring Stage-playes, which incroach so farre, so desperately, so universally upon the lives of many (especially in this our great Metrapolis where they are daily acted and frequented,) must certainely be execrable, sinfull, and pernicious unto Christians, ( who should redeeme their fore past time which teares, which they have spent in lascivious carnall iollity ) even in regard of this most vile effect, which issues alwayes from them. The second consequent or effect of Stage-playes; is a prodigall, sinfull, vaine expence of money, which should be more profitably, more charitably disbursed, then in supporting Playes or Players. From whence I argue in the 28. place; thus. That which alwayes necessarily occasions a prodigall vaine expence of mony or estate, which should be well imployed, is certainely sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. But this doe Stage-playes, and common Actors. Therefore they are certainely sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. The Major cannot be gainsaid, because prodigally and idle expence of mony, is a sinne , as the Scriptures , Fathers , with sundry Pagan Authors have determined: and that in two respects. First, because it abuseth, it perverteth Gods good creatures to an unlawfull end, by mispending them upon carnall pleasures, lusts, and vaine fantastique humours ; when as they should be imployed to Gods glory, our owne and others good . Secondly, because it robs the poore of that bountifull charitable reliefe, which else they should receive from that superfluity of wealth which Prodigals consume: The maine end why God bestowes abundance of earthly riches upon some men, more then others, being onely this; that their super-abundant plenty, might supply the wants of others: not feed their owne excessive lusts , as Play-haunters for the most part doe. The Minor (that Stage-playes alwayes necessarily occasion much prodigall expence, which might be better imployed;) is most apparant, not onely by that of Ovid , Inspice ludorum sumptus Auguste tuorum; Empta tibi magno talia multa leges. Quoda minus prodest p aena est lucrosa Poetae, Tantaque non parvo crimina praetor emit ; but likewise by the Records and Histories of former ages. It is storied of the Romans; that the summes of mony they disbursed in erecting Theaters, in setting forth Stage-playes, and such like publike Spectacles, did annually amount to more then their expences on their Warres, or Fortifications: in so much that the charge of them at last grew altogether intollerable, not onely to Rome it selfe, but to all her Confederates, and forraigne Tributary Provinces; who were much oppressed, much impoverished by reason of the excessive charge of Playes, and publike Shews . towards which they were Contributors . It is registred of the Athentans, that their very publike Stage-playes, (maintained at the republikes cost) did so exhaust their common treasure, that at last they left no mony in their Exchequer to rigge their Ships, to set forth their Navy, or to defend their Country: in so much that their enemies laying hold on this their penury, prevailed much against them. Whence they were not uniustly taxed by a Lacedemonian, for wasting serious things on sports, and lavishing out the provision, the supplies of great Navies and Armies, upon Playes and Theaters . It is recorded of divers Roman Emperours , (as Caligula, Clandius, Nero Verus, Maximinus, Balbinus, Carinus, and others) who are therefore censured by their owne Historians; that they spent a great part of their Revenues upon Playes and common Actors, who received annuall Pensions from them, besides other Boones and Gratuities : which publike Stipends and Donations , Tiberius, Marcus Antonius the Philosopher, Dioclesian, Alexander Severus, with other Roman Emperours did curtale, or totally withdraw, as over- chargeable to their Exchequers, which they did much exhaust . Not to relate the prodigall expences of the Roman State in generall, or of some of their Magistrates, or editors of Playes in particular, who prodigally spent their whole estate in celebrating Playes to the honour of their Idols, or to gaine the acclamattons of the vulgar crew, who were much delighted with theatricall and gladiatory Enterludes; of which there are sundry precedents , wherein I might expatiate: I shall relate the summe of all in the words of S. Augustine , who complaines; that even in his time, and before, more was given to Stage-players, for superfluous pleasure, then was disbursed in the second Punicke warre upon the Roman Legions for the publike safety, which was then indangered : with which the patheticall speech of Salvian , to this purpose, well accords. In former time (saith he) when every Part of the Roman Empire flourished, the Common-weale after a sort, did seeke where and how to waste her wealth, having almost no place to keepe it. And therefore heapes of treasure, wel-nigh above measure, were consumed upon vaine Enterludes. But now what can be said? Our old abundance in departed from us; gone is the wealth of former times; poore are we now, and yet we cease not to be vaine. Play-houses, the places and habitations of filthinesse, are yet standing, because in them all impure things were formerly acted: but yet now in many places Playes themselves are not so frequently acted, because the misery, the poverty of the time will not permit it. So that it was from mens impiety that Playes were acted in times past; and it is onely from their necessity that they are not acted now. For the poverty of the Exchequer, and the beggerlinesse of the Roman Treasury permit not now, that any prodigall expenses should be every where lavished out upon such nugatory trifles. Althought as yet much is still lost, and cast as it were into the dirt; yet nothing so much can be now consumed, because there is not much to spend. And yet such is our unsatiable desire of most filthy pleasure, that verily, we could wish that we had more, for this onely purpose, that we might convert more into this mire of filthinesse. Yea, the very thing it selfe shewes how much we would prodigally consume on Stage-playes if we were rich, when as we waste so much upon them being poore. For this is the blemish and misery of our present condition, that although through our poverty we cannot, notwithstanding through our vitiousnesse, we would yet spend more . Which may as truely be predicated of the English Play-haunters now, as of the Romans then. By all these testimonies wee may evidently discerne, how prodigally expensive these Playes and Players were unto the ancient Romans, both in their wealth and poverty. The expences in setting forth publike Playes and Enterludes being so excessive, that they could hardly be undergone by any but the Emperour, as C aesar Bulengerus testifieth . And if they were such to the very richest Common-weales and Monarches, how much more intollerably expensive, thinke you, were they to private persons? Flavins Vopiscus reports, of Iulius Messalla; that he spent his whole Patrimony upon Stage-players, leaving nought unto his Heires: and that he gave his Mothers Coate unto a Woman-Actor, and his Fathers Cloke to a Player, for which he liberally taxeth him. Nicolaus and Athen aeus record of Sylla, the Roman Captaine, that he was so adicted to Playes, (he being much enamored with ludicrous sports,) that he gave them many acres of ground, out of the Republikes revenues . To which I may adde that of Aelins Lampridius , who writes of Commodus Antoninus; that he deminished his Treasury by prodigall expenses upon Stage-playes; and that he added many Cirque playes rather out of lust, then out of religion, that so he might enrich the Masters of those factions. Gregory Nazienzen informes us; that Stage-playes and Horse-races doe manifestly impoverish mens estates. How many Families (writes he) have they sodainely over-turned? how many rich men have they enforced to begge their bread? how many Citties living peaceably among themselves, have they utterly overthrowne? Seest thou not some men (writes S. Basil) prodigally consuming their mony in Play-houses upon Tumblers and Stage-players, which every one should abbor to behold, to gaine some momentany honour, and a little popular applause? It is (quoth Arnobius) an inexpiable sinne, that gifts and stipends are alowed and appointed unto Stage-players, and worne-out Pantomimes, the deriders of the gods; that they are exempted from publike Offices and imployments, and crowned with Garlands. Saint Chrysostome oft complaintes; that Stage-playes are the occasions of many prodigall vaine expenses: that men did bestow innumerable, yea, unspeakeable gifts, and consume much mony upon Stage-players: that they cherished them at their owne private houses, bestowing that food, that cost upon them, which should be spent upon Christs poore members: that they maintained them likewise out of the publike Treasury, as if they had well deserved of the Common-weale, which had disfranchised and made them infamous . Saint Ambrose makes mention of some, whom he censureth for prodigals, who spent their Patrimonies upon Stage-Playes, Cirques, and Sword-Playes, out of a vaine-glorious humour, to surpasse the solemnities of former times, when as all they did was but vanity. S. Augustine complaines, that the Roman Magistrates, did corrupt the publike manners, by spoyling the miserable Citizens, and by giving unto filthy Stage-Players; who received more gifts for their superfluous Playes, then the ancient Roman Legions had bestowed on them for their Warres . Pope Leo the first , makes this complaint, of the age wherein he lived. I am ashamed (saith he) to speake, and yet there is a necessity that I should not be silent: there is more now spent upon the Devill at Play-houses, then there is bestowed on Christ, on his Apostles. Asterius in his Homely against the feast of the Kalends informes us, That Playes are the cause of Debt and Usury; the occasion of Poverty, the beginning of Beggery. If one hath but a small stocke of mony layd up at home for the sustentation of his wife and miserable Children, it is here drawne out and cast away and he and his sit all this eminent feast, hungry, and indigent of all things. Men now make havocke of their goods, and prodigally spend them with the great losse both of manners and discipline. Yea, the very Consuls themselves, being men of renowne, advanced to the very top of humane honours, exhaust their wealth through vanity, not onely without fruit, but likewise with sinne; and it may be truely said, that as sublime as their throne is, so eminent is their folly. For whereas they are wont to accept of many dignities, and to obtaine most ample royall Leiftenantships; they study to rake as much wealth out of each of them as they can. Some of them convert the millitary stipends to their owne private lucre: others of them sell iustice and truth for mony: others of them poll the Kings Treasures and revenues, laying up all they can scrape together on every side, to the offence of God, pretermitting no uniust, no infamous or dishonest gaine: And now when as they beare rule, in a very short space they spend the Gold they have thus hourded, upon Fidlers, Stage players, Dancers and Eunuches . And a little after. But thou (saith he) dost empty thy Bagges, upon the dishonest recreation of thy minde, upon unseemely and disorderly laughter, never considering how many teares of poore men thou mightest relieve, by which thy wealth hath beene scraped together; how many have beene cast into prison? how many have beene whipt and brought to the Gallowes, that thou mightest have sufficient to give to Stage-players on this day ? To passe by the testimony of Clemens Alexandrinus , Tertullian , and Cyprian in this nature, with sundry Other Fathers; I shall close up this with that of Iohn Salisbury , our owne ancient Country-man; Many (writes he) out of a blinde contemptible magnificence, care not to lavish out infinite summes of mony to Stage-players and Actors. Many there are who prostitute their grace and favour unto Players, and in setting forward their lewdnesse, out of a blinde dishonourable bounty, put themselves not so much to wonderfull, as to miserable expenses: and among others, he sharpely taxeth Nero the Emperour for this very crime . To these I shall adde the concurrent testimony of some few Pagan Authors. Marcus Aurelius , that worthy Roman Emperour, in his 12. Epistle to Lambert , hath this notable passage, concerning Players and mens expenses on them. Sith fatall destinies have brought me into this world, I have seene nothing more unprofitable to the Commonwealth, nor greater folly in them that be light of conditions, nor a worse invention of Vagabonds, nor a more cold revocation of mortall folke, them to learne of these Players, triflers and such other Iuglers. what thing is more monstrous, then to see wisemen reioyce at the pastime of these vaine triflers? What greater mockery can there be in the Capitoll, then the foolish saying of a Iester to be praysed with great laughter of wise men? What greater slander can be to Princes Houses, then to have their Gates alwayes open to these fooles, and never open to wise folkes? What greater cruelty can there be in any person, then to give more in one day to a foole, then to his servants in a yeere, or to his kinne all his life? What greater inconstancy can there be then to want men to furnish the Garrisons and Frontiers of Illirico, and these trewands to abide at Rome? What like shame can there be to Rome, then that the memory shall be left in Italy of the Tumblers, Trewands, Pipers, Singers of Iests, Taberers, Crowders, Dancers, Alummers, Iesters, and Iuglers, rather then the renowne of Captaines, with their Triumphes and Armes? And when these Captaines wandred all about Rome in safety, sounding their lewdnesse and gathering of mony, the Noble Barons and Captaines went from Realme to Realme, wasting their mony, adventuring their lives, and shedding their blood. In the uttermost parts of Spaine, when Warre began betweene the Liberiens and Gaditaines, and they of Liberie lacked mony , two Iuglers and Taberers offred to maintaine the Warre an whole yeere. And it followed, that with the goods of two fooles many wise men were slaine and overcome. In Ephesus a Citty of Asia, the famous Temple of Diana was edified with the confiscation of the goods of such a truant and foole. When Cadmus edefied the Citty of Thebes in Egypt with 50\. Gates, the Minstrels gave him more towards it then all his friends. If the History be true, when Augustus edefied the walls of Rome, he had more of the trewands that were drowned in Tiber, then of the common Treasure. The first King of Corinth arose by such villanies. And as I say of this small number, I might say of many other. One thing is come to my minde of the chance of these Trewands, and that is, whiles they be in presence, they make every man laugh at the follies they doe and say, and when they be gone, every man is sorry for his mony that they bare away. And of truth it is a iust sentence of the gods, that such as have taken vaine pleasure together, when they are departed to weepe for their losses . Thus he. The Poet Iuvenal reports; that many women by frequenting Stage-Playes had beggered their Husbands and spent their whole estates: and that divers had disinherited their Heires, and either spent or given away all their goods and Lands to Players: which is seconded by Flavius Vopiscus, in the life of Carinus. pag . 449.450. The Poet Horace makes mention of one Mars aeus, who gave all his Lands, his Patrimony Patrimony and Houshold-stuffe to a Woman-Actor: informing us withall; that there were divers who had spent both their lands and mony upon Stage-playes, and donations to the people in Floralan Enterludes . To these I might accumulate the severall suffrages of moderne Christian Authors; as namely, of Vincentius , in his Speculum Historiale. lib . 29. c . 141. fol . 367. a pregnant place; of Francis Petrarcha.

Pag . 242. 143. with infinite others which I pretermit, who all condemne and censure Stage- playes, in regard of the immoderate sinfull vaine expenses which they occasion, to Gods dishonour, the publike preiudice, and poore mens detriment . But for brevity sake, I shall close up all these evidences, with that of learned and laborious Gualther , who affirmes; that Stage-playes are no small plagues of Common-weales: For they exceedingly deminish (among other mischiefes which hee there enumerates) as well the publike, as mens private wealth. and they almost wholy intercept by their arts and sleights, that which ought to be bestowed for the poores reliefe . Neither need I seeke for further testimonies in so cleare a case, since our owne domestique experience (especially in the Raigne of King Henry the VIII. who spent insinite summes of mony upon Stage-playes, Masques, and such like prodigall Shewes and Pageants ) is a sufficient confirmation of my Minors truth. Not to mention the over- prodigall disbursements upon Playes, and Masques of late penurious times , which have beene wel-nigh as expensive as the Wars, and I dare say more chargable to many then their soules, on which the most of us bestow least cost, least time and care. How many hundreds, if not thousands, are there now among us, (to their condemnation, if not their reformation be it spoken,) who spend more, daily, weekely, monethly, if not yeerely at a Play-house to maintaine the Devils service and his instruments; then they disburse in pious uses, in reliefe of Ministers, Schollers, poore godly Christians, or maintenance of Gods service, all their life? How many assiduous Play-haunters are there who contribute more liberally, more frequently to Play-houses, then to Churches; to Stage- playes, then to Lectures; to Players, then to Preachers; to Actors, then to poore mens Boxes ? being at far greater cost to promote their owne and others iust damnation; then themselves or others are to advance their owne or others salvation. How many are there, who can bee at cost to hire a Coach , a Boate, a Barge, to carry them to a Play house every day , where they must pay deare for their admission, Seates and Boxes; who will hardly be at any cost to convey themselves to a Sermon once a weeke, a moneth, a yeere, (eppecially on a weeke day) at a Church far nearer to them then the Play-house ; where they may have Seates, have entrance, (yea spirituall Cordials, and celestiall Dainties to refresh their soules) without any money or expense ? How many are there, who according to their severall qualities spend 2.d. 3.d.4.d. 6.d. 12.d. 18.d 2.s. and sometimes 4. or 5. shillings at a play-house, day by day, if Coach-hire, Boate-hire, Tobacco, Wine, Beere, and such like vaine expences which playes doe usually occasion, be cast into the reckoning; and that in these penurious times, who can hardly spare, who can never honestly get by their lawfull callings, halfe so much? How many prodigally consume, not onely their charity, apparell, diet, bookes, and other necessaries; but even their annual Pensions, Revenues and Estates at Picke-purse Stage-players; which are more expensive to them, then all their necessary disbursements? If we summe up all the prodigall vaine expenses which Play-houses and Playes occasion every way, we shall finde them almost infinite, wel-nigh incredible; altogether intollerable in any Christian frugall state ; which must needs abandon Stage- playes as the Athenians and Romans did at last , even in this regard, that they impoverish and quite ruins many ; as the fore-quoted testimonies, with many domestique experiments daily testifie Et h aec quidem idcirco ego in lateras retuli (as Vopiscus writes of Iulius Messalla) quo futuros editores pudor tangeret, ne patrimonia sua, proscriptis legitimis h aeredibus, mimis & balatronibus deputarent. If any here reply, that they spend not much at Playes, and that their Play- house expenses are farre from prodigality, what ever some men deeme them. I answer first; that there are few ordinary Stage-haunters of any generous quality, but spend excessively at playes: some waste their Patrimonies at Play-houses, others the pensions which their friends alot them; others the money which should satisfie their Creditors, and relieve their needy Brethren ; or else maintaine their Families. Most of them mispend more there, then they can well spare; all of them more then is well or lawfully spent. Secondly, he that spends least of all at Playes and Play-houses, is as really guilty of prodigality, though not in the same degree, as he that lavisheth out most of any , because the very giving of money to Players as Players; that is, for the exercising of their lewde lascivious art, is prodigality. Witnesse Tully himselfe, who desineth Prodigals, to be such who spend their money in setting forth Stage-playes , with which definition, Petrarch doth accord. Witnesse Clemens Alexandrinus , who resolves; that money spent on Playes and such like vanities, is wastfull prodigality, not honest expense . Witnesse Saint Ambrose who describes prodigality , to be a wasting of wealth upon Players and Playes for popular appluse: whence he reputes those Prodigals who doe so: informing us, withall, that whatsoever is given to Stage-players, Sword-players, and such like cast-awayes, is utterly lost, so that men can reape no comfort from it . And yet, saith he, divers Magistrates have prodigally given and consumed almost their whole Patrimony in Theaters, upon Players, Wrestlers, Fencers, and such kinde of men, that they might purchase to themselves the peoples favour but for one houre, without any further advantage . To passe by Tertullians verdict; that to be unfruistfull unto players, and such unusefull persons, is great frugality: and so by consequence, that to part with money to them is prodigality: as Saint Basil, Nazianzen, Leo, Chrysostome, Asterius, Salvian, Iohn Sarisbury, Petrarch, Bodinus, Northbrooke, Gualther, Gosson , Doctor Reinolds , and others, in their fore-going passages testifie. Incognitus in Psal . 149. and our owne famous English Apostle, Iohn Wickleffe expresly teach us; that to give to Stage-players is prodigality : and therefore Wicklef instructs us: that a magnificent man ought carefully to measure out his bounty in many cases according to prudence, especially in not giving to Stage-players, or sturdie Beggers to purcase a vaine-glorious name, as the custome of many was to doe . S. Augustine is yet more strict; resolving; us; that for a man to bestow his goods or money upon Stage-players, is not onely prodigality and no vertue, but a great hainous vice . Which assertion of his is both recited and approved by Gratian, Iohn Sarisbury, Aquinas , Alexander de Hales , Tostatus , Incognuus , Astexanus , Bishop Babington ; Master Northbrooke ,  1 Stephen Gosson , and  2 others, upon these ensuing reasons. First, because the donation of money unto Stage-players doth and animate, yea maintaine them in their diabolicall lewde unchristian profession, and makes their reformation desperate . Secondly, because it supports the Synagogues, Lectures, and lewde instruments of Satan, (the Seminaries of all wickednesse) which else would fall to ruine, there being no contributing Spectators to suport them. If there were no Play- haunters to behold and cherish Stage-players , there would then (as Chrysostome truely writes) be no Play-poets, no Players for to pen or act them: But when Actors see men leave their owne callings, trades, and daily imployments, together with the gaine arising thence, and all thing else to run to Stage-playes; this makes them more earnestly to addict themselves to their trade of acting, and to bestow more diligence in playing: The multitude of prodigall Spectators , is that which makes so many Play-houses, Playes, and Actors, which else would quickly vanish: Play-haunters therefore, (if we believe Saint Chrysostome and Alexander Alensis) are the chiefe originall delinquents in the case of Playes, because their presence at them, their contribution towards them and their Actors, is the rise from whence they spring . Thirdly, because it maintaines Players in a constant course of theft: For the very profession of a Stage-player being unlawfull (as Divines agree:) the mony they receive for acting (as Tostatus , Dan aeus , Bishop Babington, Master Perkins, Elten, Dod, Downbam, Lake and Williams , with sundry others have resolved) must certainly be theft, because not gotten by any lawfull meanes . Fourthly, because it exenuates, or intercepts mens charity to the poore, who like empty Bagges, are best capable to receive the superfluity of rich mens plenty , which Players for the most part now engrosse. Fiftly,: because those who give their money to Stage-players, bestow it on them onely for the exercise of their unchristian art; for their playes and Action, not their poverty or desert: they are bountifull to them as Players onely, not as men, as Christians, whose very penury begges an almes . Our Players , though they are Rogues and Sturdy-beggers by Statute , are yet so haughty in their mindes, so gorgeously glittering in-their hired Brokers Robes ; and sometimes so well lined in the Purse, that they disdaine the name of Beggers , though in truth they are no other, then arrogant fancy Vagrants, who rather challenge as a due, then begge the almes of Play-haunters: Hence all the coyne they get by playing, is stiled by themselves, not Almes , but Wages: not Charity , but Desire ; not bounty, but reward: and those who part with it deeme it so; who gratifie them onely for their Playing, not pitty them for their poverty; as Augustine , with others well observe: Now thus to remunerate Stage-playes, pro exercitio sui vitij , as the Schoolemen speake; that is, for the very exercise of their unlawfull art, is a vast notorious sinne: ( Quoniam histrionibus dare est D aemonibus imolare:) which as it makes these who are guilty of it, wicked men; so it bindes them over to eternall punishments without repentance , as all the Marginall Authors doe define . Lastly, because mens contribution to Playes and Players (whose approbattion or approbation or applause, no good men should demerit by their baunty to them ) involues them both in the guilt and punishment of all those sinnes that are occasioned or committed by them: as Chrysostom.Hom .6. in Matth. Salvian, De Gubernatione Dei.lib .6. Augustine. Enar.in Psal .102. with all the other fore-quoted Authors largely testifie. What therefore Seneca writes in a paralell case: I will not give money unto him, whom I know will part with it to an Adulteresse, lest I should participate of his filthy fact or counsell: If I can, I will recall him; if not, I will not further him in his wickednesse: The same should bee every true Christians resolution in this case of Stage-players: hee should not give his money unto Players; lest he participate both in the guilt and punishment of their sinnes; he shold doe his best to hinder; at least-wise he should never foster Playes or Players, by contributing to their Boxes, or resorting to their Theaters, for the fore-named reasons. Since therefore it is abunndantly evident by the premises; that Stage-playes are the occasions of much vaine, much sinfull prodigell expense: and that the very contributing to Players Boxes (of which every common Spectator must be always culpable) is not onely apparant prodigality, but a Giant-like sinne , which brings much danger to mens soules: It must needs cause us to abominate, to abandon Stage-playes, even for this effect, which alwayes necessarily attends them. The third effect or fruit of Stage-playes, is the irritation, the inflamation, the fomentation of divers sinfull lusts, of many lewde, unchaste adulterous affections, both in the Actors and Spectators hearts: From whence this Play- oppugning Argument will ebulliate. That which doth ordinarily, if not alwayes defile the eyes, the eares and soules both of the Actors and Spectators, by ingendring, by exciting meretricious lustfull, lewde, adulterous desires and affections in their hearts; or by instigating, by preparing, by inducing them to actual uncleanesse; must needs be abominable and unlawfull unto Christians. But this doe Stage-playes, as I shall here make manifest. Therefore they must needs bee abominable and unlawfull unto Christians. The Major is irrefragable; because all polluting objects, all unchaste affections, and unruly carnall lusts , (which are no lesse then adultery, then uncleanesse it selfe in Gods account ,) doe not onely contaminate, and war against mens soules ; but likewise deprive them of Gods favour , disable them to every holy duty , inthrall them unto Satan ; exclude them out of Heaven ; and without repentance plunge them into Hell for all eternity . Since therefore the Scripture calls upon us; to cleanse our selves from all pollution of flesh and spirit ; to mortifie our carnall lusts and earthly members : to crucifie the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof ; the fruit of which is eternall death : to abstaine from fleshly lusts which war against the soule ; and to make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof : Since it expresly informes us; that none but I dolatrous Heathen Gentiles, in whom the Devill raignes ; none but unregenerate, carnall, gracelesse persons, who have no part in Christ, doe wallow with delight; doe foster, harbour, or take pleasure in such lusts as these . And that all who are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof : because the carnall minde is enmity against God, neither is it, nor can it be subiect to his law : There are none but Whores and Panders, or foule incarnate Devils, who dare controll my Minors truth; which all Christians must subscribe to; because they are no longer debtors to the flesh, to live after the flesh ; but sworne Servants and Spouses unto Christ alone , to whom they have resigned both their soules and bodies, to be at none but his disposall. The Minor is notoriously evident, not onely by experience; but likewise by the concurring suffrages of sundry Fathers, Councels, and Authors of all sorts: Who as they stile, Play-houses; The Temples of Venery; the Schooles of Bawdry; the Dens of Lewdnesse; the Sinkes of Filthinesse: and Stage-playes; the Lectures of Ribaldry; the Meditations of Adultery; the Nurseries of Uncleanesse: the Fomentations of Lechery: the Fuell the Incendiaries of lust: and the very Devils Forge or Bellowes, to excite and blow up flames of carnall Concupiscence, both in the Actors and Spectators hearts : a sufficient ratification of our present Assumption. So they likewise positively affirme, and copiously testifie the truth of this proposition in expresse words: Witnesse Clemens Alexandrinus ; who informes us; that Comedies and amorous moderne Poems teach men adultery: that they defile mens eares with incests, and fornications: therefore he tells the Gentiles, that not onely the use, the sight and hearing, but likewise the very memory of Stage-playes, yea of the fabulous Poems, pictures, and representations of their unchaste, libidinous Idol-gods, ought utterly to be abolished; because their eares had committed whoredoms, their eyes had played the harlots with them: and which is more strange, that their very sight had committed adultery before any actuall embracement, by reason of these obscene Pictures, and filthy Enterludes . Hence he instructeth Christians; that his P aedagoge must not. lead them unto Playes or Theaters, which may not be unfitly called, the Chaire of Pestilence: because these Conventicles where men and women meete promiscuously together to behold one another, are the occasion of lewdnesse: here they give, or plot wicked counsell: For while their eyes are lasciviously occupied, their lusts waxe warme, and their eyes being accustomed to glance more impudently on those who sit next them, having liberty and leisure granted to them, intend their lusts. These Spectacles therefore (saith he) which are fraught with wickednesse, with obscene, and vaine speeches; with the representations of filthy deeds; with impudent and unchaste discourses which provoke langhter, the Id aeaes of which men carry away with them to their houses, & there more deepely imprint them in their mindes; are utterly to be prohibited . Witnesse Tertullian ; who records; that Tragedies and Comedies, are the augmenters of villanies and lusts; being both cruell and lascivious, impious and prodigall . That they desile mens eyes and eares with uncleanesse : and blow up the sparkles of their Lusts . Hence he stiles the Play-house: the Chappell of Venery: the House of Lechery: the Consistory of Iucountinency : Hence he informes us; that all the Christians in the Primitive Church, had utterly relinquished the uncleanesse of the Theater . Hence he comforts the close imprisoned Martyrs of his time with this consideration; that by meanes of their imprisonment; their eyes were kept from the sight of Theaters, the places of publike lust, and lechery. Neither were their eares offended with the clamors or uncleanesse of Stage- players . And hence hee doubles this Assertion. That Stage-playes are absolutely prohibited, by the inhibition of incontinency . Witnesse Origen ; who instructeth us: that Christians must not lift up their eyes to Stage-playes, the pleasurable delights of polluted eyes (as he there stiles them) lest their lusts should be inflamed by them. What then (writes he in another place) shall we say of these who with the troopes of the Gentiles make haste to Stage-playes, and defile their eyes and eares with unchaste words and motions? It is not our part to passe sentence upon such, for they themselves may perceive and see what part they have chosen to themselves . Thou therefore who hearest these things. Be ye holy, for I am holy: Wisely understand what is spoken: seperate thy selfe from terrene actions; seperate thy selfe from the lusts of the world, and from the contagion of every sinne . Witnesse Saint Cyprian, who stiles Theaters The Stewes of publike chastity, and Mastership of obsc aenity: which teach those sinnes in publike, that men may more usually commit them in private . what doth a faithfull Christian (writes he) doe amidest these things, who may not so much as thinke upon any vice? Why is he delighted with these Images of lusts; that so having deposited his modesty in them, he may be made more bold to commit the crimes themselves? He learnes to commit, who accustometh himselfe to behold the Theatricall representations of uncleanesse. Those common whores whose misfortune hath prostituted them to the slavery of the publike Stewes, conceale the place where their filthinesse is committed, taking comfort in their disgrace from the secrecy of their CeUs: Those Adulterers also who have sold their chastity, are ashamed to be seene in publike: But this our publike lewdnesse is acted in the open viewe of all men: the obsc aenity of common Whores is surpassed, and men have found out how they may commit adultery before the eyes of others. Thus what soever is prohibited, is affected. Now I say, (I pray observe it well good Reader,) it is Not lavvfvll for faithfvll Christians, yea , IT IS ALTOGETHER VNLAVVFVLL FOR THEM TO BE PRESENT AT THESE Playes . These so vaine, so pernicious, so sachrilegious Stage-playes ,  AS I HAVE NOVV OFTEN AFFIRMED, ARE VVHOLLY TO BEE AVOYDED BY ALL FAITHFVLL wickednesse, which we heare and see: For since the minde of man is easily led on to these vices of it selfe; what will it doe when it is presented with unchaste examples both of body and nature? she who thus falls of her owne accord, what will she doe if she be precipitated? The minde therefore is wholly to be avotated from these lascivious Enterludes . Adde we to this another speech of his to the same purpose. Turne (saith he) thine eyes to the nolesse sinfull contagions of a different shew: thou maist also behold in Theaters, that which may affect thee both with griefe and shame. It is a Tragedians part, to relate ancient wickednesses in verse: the ancient horror of Paricides and Incestuous persons is represented by him to the life; lest those wickednesses which were committed in former ages, should grow obsolete in aftertimes. Every age is admonished, that what-ever villany was actually committed in former times, may be committed still. Those things are now made examples, which have ceased to be sinnes. Then you may please to know from Stage-players, what filthinesse any man hath committed in secret, or to heare what he might have done . Thus is adultery learned whiles it is beheld, and the evill of publike authority playing the Pander to these vices, she who at first came perchance a chaste Matron to the Play, returnes a Strumpet from the Play-house. Moreover, what a great corruption of mens manners, what fomentations of reproachfull actions, what a fuell of vices is it, to be polluted with histrionicall gestures, to see filthy Incest elaborately acted, against the very covenant and right of mans nativity ? Men are emasculated; all the honour and vigor of their Sex is abated by the filthinesse of an effeminated body; and he there gives best content, who doth most dissolve himselfe into a woman: his sinne addes to his applause, and he is reputed the more skilfull, by how much the more filthy he is. What then cannot he perswade who is such a one? he moves the sences, he soothes the affections, he expugnes the stronger conscience of an upright heart; neither wants there the authority of flattering reproach, that so destruction may creepe upon men by a more delicate hearing . They represent unchaste Venus, adulterous Mars, yea, their great love, not more a Prince in dominion, then in vices; burning with his very Thunder bolts into terrene loves ; sometimes waxing white in the feathers of a Swan ; otherwhiles descending in a golden shoure ; anon comming forth attended with Birds to ravish and snach away yong Youthes , Examine now whether those who behold these Spectacles can be sincere or chaste, whiles they imitate the gods they worship? Even sinnes themselves are made religious to these wretches: O if thou couldest standing in that sublime watch-towre insert thine eyes into their secrets, open the closed doores of their bed-chambers, and bring all their hidden inmost roomes unto the conscience or the light, thou mightest see that done by these unchaste persons, which is a sinne to see: thou mightest see that, which they sighing under the fury of their vices deny themselves to have done, and yet they hasten for to doe it . Men rush upon men with mad unruly lusts, &c. A sufficient adequate testimony of my Minors truth. Adde wee to these irrefragable Witnesses some others of no lesse validity: Tatianus, stiles Stage-players , the Promoters of Adultery, the Tutors of effeminate Dancers, and Sodomites; the authors of damnable practises; the teachers of adultery, who utter obscene words with a loud voyce, and use lascivious motions promulgating all nocturnall abominations, and uttering all obscenities that might delight the Auditors . Theophylus Antiochenui , writes: That the Christians in his time durst not behold Stage-playes, lest their eyes should be defiled with the adulteries of those Devill-gods and men, that were there personated; and lest their eares should sucke in those prophane verses that were there recited . To passe by Arnobius, who declaimes much against the obscenity of Stage-playes, which did adulterate the mindes, inflame the lusts of the Spectators, by reason of those lewde adulterous villanies of Idol-gods that were represented in them, which he at larges discyphers: Lactantius , his Scholler, writes thus of Stage- playes. In Stage-playes also, I know not whether there be a more dangerous corruption. For Comicall fables treat of the rapes of Virgins, or of the loves of Harlots, and by how much the more eloquent the Poets are who have feined these wickednesses, by so much the more doe they perswade by their elegant sentences, and the more easily doe their wel-composed and adorned verses sticke in the memory of the Hearers. Likewise Tragicall Histories present unto mens eyes the Paricides, the Incests of evill Kings, and they demonstrate tragicall wickednesses . The most unchaste motions likewise of Stage-players, what else doe they but teach and provoke lusts? whose enervated bodies dissolved into a womans pace and habit, personate unchaste women with dishonest gestures. What shall I speake of mimicall Actors, who carry along with them even in outward shew, the discipline of depraving corruptions? who teach adulteries whiles they feine them, and by counterfeit representations instruct men how to commit even reall uncleanesses . What may yong Men, or Virgins doe, when as they perceive these things to be acted without shame, and willingly to be beheld of all? Verily they are admonished what they may doe, and they are inflamed with lust, which is most of all excited by the sight: and every one according to his Sex doth prefigure himselfe in these Images; yea, they approve them whiles they laugh at them, and they returne more corrupt to their Chambers by reason of the vices which adhere unto them . And not onely Children who ought not to be seasoned with premature vices, but even old men, for whom it is unseemely now to sinne, stray aside into this path of vices . Therefore all Spectacles and Stage-playes (I pray observe it well)  ARE VVHOLY TO BE AVOYDED , not onely lest any vices should harbour in our hearts, which ought to be calme and quiet; but likewise lest the custome of any pleasure should delight us, and so TVRNE VS FROM God AND FROM GOOD VVORKES.  Yea these Enterludes with which men are delighted, and at which they are willingly present; because they are THE GREATEST INSTIGATIONS VNTO VICE , (pray marke it) AND THE MOST POVVERFVLL INSTRVMENTS TO CORRVPT MENS MINDES, ARE VVHOLY TO BE ABOLISHED FROM AMONG VS; Since they doe not onely, not contribute any thing to an happy life, but likewise doe much hurt . In another worke of his he writes thus. What is the Play-house? is it more holy then these Sword-playes? in which a Comedy treates of Rapes, and Loves; a Tragedy of Incests. and Murthers. Moreover unchaste Histrionicall gestures, with which they imitate infamous Women, doe teach those lusts which they expresse by dancing: And is not then a Player the corruption of discipline, in whom those things that are done are acted by representation, that so those things which are truely reall, may be perpetrated without any shame. Yong men behold these things, whose slippery age, which should be brideled and governed, is instructed to commit sinnes and vices by these representations . THEREFORE ALL PLAYES ARE TO BEE AVOYDED, THAT VVE MAY enioy a serene state of minde .  THESE NOXIOVS PLEASVRES ARE TO BE RENOVNCED, lest we being delighted with their pestiferous sweetnesse, should fall into the snares of death. Vertue alone, whose reward is immortall, will then content us, when she hath overcome these pleasures . Thus farre Lactantius , most elegantly, most truely. Adde wee to him Minucius Felix , that eminent Christian Lawyer, whom Lactantius himselfe commends : who writes thus of Stage-playes. Your Comedies and Tragedies glory in incestuous persons, and yet you willingly both read and heare them: and so you worship Incestuous gods, who have coupled with their owne Mothers, Daughters, Sisters: Worthily therefore (such was the fruit of these their Stage-playes) is Incest oft-times deprehended among you, alwayes is it tolerated and committed . We therefore who are valued according to our maners and modesty, deservedly absteine from your evill pleasures, your shewes, and Stage-playes whom we know to have taken their originall from your Idol-worship, and whose noxious flattering enticements we condemne. For in your Chariot-playes, who would not abhorre the madnesse of the people brawling among themselves? the discipline or art of murther in Sword playes? in Stage-playes likewise there is no lesse fury, more prolix obscenity: For one while the iesting Actor, doth either expound adulteries, or personate them. Another while ,  THE EFFEMINATE by personating whoredomes, sighes, hatreds, disgraceth your gods: The same with feined griefes provokes your teares with his vaine gestures and nods. Thus you desire true murther, you bewaile feined, &c. Thus hee. Saint Basil the Great , informes us: That the very beholding and hearing of Stage-playes ingenders overmuch lust in the mindes of men; That Stage-playes abounding with lascivious Spectacles are the common Shops of all wickednesse: that they sticke fast in the mindes of the Auditors: and serve to no other purpose but to perswade all men unto filthinesse. Gregory Nyssen records ; That lascivious Spectacles; and filthy Pictures engraven or painted either in Walls, in Halls, or Plate, (to satisfie the luxury of the minde) doe proclaime lewdnesse: the thoughts are recalled to their lusts, by the sight of these blame-worthy Spectacles, whose inflammation pierceth even to the affections, lest verily the heat of mens lusts should be quenched . If that thou couldest dive, I say, not into the Vessels and Caskets (for they are manifest unto many, neither are they different from their filthinesse of life) but into the retyred hidden secrets of the minde and soule of a man delighted with these Spectacles, thou shouldest verily there finde a stinking rottennesse of many accumulated Frogges ; that is (as hee there expresseth himselfe in a former passage) of filthy lusts and vices. But even the eye of a chaste man is cleane, and refuseth these Spectacles which incite men unto luxury, or carnall pleasure . Our common Play-haunters and lascivious Picture-masters therefore, by this Fathers verdict. (whatever they may deeme themselves,) are no chaste, no modest persons; yearather beasts, then men ; as he there tearmes them. Gregory Nazienzen , stiles Stage-players; the servants of lewdnesse: Play- houses , the lascivious shops of all filthinesse and impurity : Stage- playes: the dishonest unseemely instructions of lascivious men, who repute nothing filthy, but modesty; by which nature is vitiated, and made adulterous, and severall flames of different lusts are kindled . Theaters likewise are seasoned with most filthy things; lest that these diseases should practise their lewdnesse onely in secret; Rewards are promised to these dishonest, and wicked instructions: But doe thou have these things in execration: Suffer not thy female pupils to be defiled with them; but cause them to avoyd all corruptions of their eyes, that so they may continue Virgins to me, by thy care : Intimating hereby, that resort to Stage-playes, would soone defloure their Virginity, and make them Strumpets. Saint Hilary informes us, That he who will ascend up into the Hill of the Lord must keepe himselfe unspotted from corruption; his body must not be defiled with whoredome; his eyes must not be polluted with Stage- playes : which hee there couples with whordome, because they ingender unchaste affections in mens hearts, and oft-times allure them to actuall lewdnesse. Therefore in his Commentary on the 118\. alias the 119\. Psalme, verse 37\. (Turne away mine eyes from beholding vanity ) he paraphraseth thus. That the Prophet prayes to have both the eyes of his body and minde turned away from Stage-playes, and the obscene fables of dishonest Enterludes; which did formerly occupy and defile them. Cyrill of Hierusalem affirmes; That Play-house meetings, and Playes, which are the Devils Pompes, were fraught with all lewdnesse, contumely, and incontinency; Whence he perswades all Christians to avoyd them . Saint Ambrose stiles Stage-playes Spectacles of Vanities, by which the Devill convayes incentives of pleasures into mens hearts. Let us therefore (saith he) turne away our eyes from these vanities, and Stage- playes, lest our minds should affect that which our eyes behold, & let us come to God that he would doe it for us. In the ship of thy body there is a tempest of lusts raysed, and yet thou turnest not away the eyes of thy soule that they should not see the sinke of lusts, nor behold the filth of this world : Such are Stage- playes in this Fathers repute. S. Hierom in his Epistle to Salvina , writes thus unto her. The fame of chastity in women is a tender thing; like a most beautifull flower it is quickly blasted with a small winde, and corrupted with an easie breath: especially where both age consents to vice, and the authority of an Husband is wanting, whose shadow is the shelter of the wife . Wherefore let no srizeld-pated Steward, no effeminate Stage-player accompany thee; let not the venomous sweetnesse of a Diabolicall Singer come neere thee, nor a compt and beautifull Youth. Have thou nothing to doe with Stage- playes: because they are the pleasing incendiaries of mens lusts and vices: because they draw mens soules by their flattering entisements to deadly pleasures, (which Christians should extinguish with the love of Christ, and curbe with fasting:) and cause them to violate the vow and bond of Chastity, of Widdowhood, of Virginity . So in his Commentary on Ezechiel. lib. 6. cap 20 . he certifieth us. That we also when as we depart out of Ægypt, are commanded to cast away al those things which offend our eyes, that so we may not be delighted with those things with which we were formerly affected in the world; to wit, with the inventions of Philosophers and Heretiques, which are rightly stiled idols. We must likewise remove our eyes from all the Spectacles, yea rather, the offences of Ægypt, as Sword- playes, Cirque- playes, and Stage-playes; which defile the purity of the soule; and by the sences gaine entrance to the minde: and so that is fulfilled, which is written; Death hath entred by your windowes : By this grave learned Fathers verdict then it is most evident; that Stage-playes devirginate unmarried persons, especially beautifull tender Virgins who resort unto them, (which I would our female Play-haunters; and their Parents would consider:) that they defile their soules with impure carnall lusts; and so let in eternall death upon them. Saint Augustine brands all Stage-playes with this stigmaticall Impresse. That they are the Spectacles of filthinesse : The overturners of goodnesse and honesty : The chasers away of all modesty and chastity : Meretricious shewes. The unchaste, the filthy gestures of Actors: The art of mischievous villanies, which even modest Pagans did blush to behold: The invitations to lewdnesse, by which the Davill useth to gaine innumerable companies of evill men into himsefe . Hence hee stiles Theaters; The Cages of uncleanesse, the publike professions of wickednesse, of wicked men : and Stage-playes; The most petulant, the most impure, impudent, wicked, uncleane; the most shamefull and detestable attonements of filthy Devil-gods; which to true Religion are most execrable: whose Actors the laudable towardnes of Roman vertue had deprived of all honour, disfranchised their tribe, acknowledged as filthy, made infamous: because the people were instructed, incouraged by the sight and hearing of Stage-playes, to imitate, to practise those alluring criminous fictions; those ignominious facts of Pagan-gods, that were either wickedly and filthily forged of them, or more wickedly and filthily committed by them . Hence is it that this godly Father, doth oft dissuade all Christians from acting, seeing, or frequenting Stage-playes, and Cirque-playes, because they are but Panders, but allectives to uncleanesse, incendiaries and fomentations unto carnall lusts . Hence he speakes thus to Christian Parents (which I would to God those gracelesse Parents who either accompany, send, encourage, or else permit their Children to runne to filthy, lewde, lascivious Stage-playes, which vitiate, which deprave them ever after , would seriously consider:) As oft, deare Breathren, as you know that any of your Children resort either to furious, bloody, or filthy Enterludes, with a vaine perswation, and pestiferous love as if it were to some good worke, you who now by the grace of God contemne, not onely these luxurious, but also cruell recreations, and disports, ought diligently to chastise them, and to pray more abundantly to the Lord for them, because you know that they run unto vanity, and lying follies, neglecting that place to which they are called. These if they chance to be affrighted in the Play-house by any sudden accident , (I would our Popish Stage-haunters, who thinke to scare away the Devill from them by their crossings, would well consider it,) doe presently crosse themselves, and they stand there carrying that in their foreheds, from whence they would depart if they carried it in their hearts. For every one who runnes to any evill worke, if he chance but to stumble, doth forth-with crosse his face, and knoweth not, that he doth rather include, then exclude the Devill. For then should he crosse himselfe well, and repell the Devill out of his heart, if he recalled himselfe from that wicked worke. Wherefore I intreat you, deare Brethren, againe and againe, that you would supplicate for them with all your might, that so they may receive understanding to condemne these damnable things; desire, to avoyd them; mercy, to acknowledge them. We may likewise speake unto those whom voluptuous Stage-playes oft-times draw from the assemblies of the Church. Notwithstanding I intreat you, deare Brethren, that as often as you shall see them to doe any such thing, you would in our stead most severely correct them: Let them heare our voyce, your remembrance: correct them by reproving them, comfort them by conferring with them, give them an ensample by living well: Then he will be present with them, who hath beene present with you . Thus Saint Augustine . by whose words you may easily discover, not onely the truth of our present Assumption: but likewise the sinfulnesse, the unlawfulnesse of Playes themselves, as also of acting, hearing, seeing and frequenting Stage-playes : Which hee likewise seconds in some other passages: as namely in his 2\. Booke, De Moribus Manichoeorum , where hee writes thus against them. Finally, we have oft-times found in Theaters divers of their choyce men who were grave both in age, and as they seemed, even in manners too, with an old Presbyter. I omit yong men whom we were likewise wont to finde brawling for Stage-players and Wagoners: which thing is no small argument after what manner they can containe themselves from secret adulteries, and villanies, since they cannot overcome that lust, which may uphold them in the eyes of their Auditors, and makes them even to blush and runne away for shame . In his Booke, De Catechizandis Rudibus. cap . 16. Hee informes us: That there are certaine men who seeke not to be rich, nor yet to aspire to the vaine pompes of honors, but desire onely to be merry and to rest quietly in Ale-houses, in Brothel-houses, in Theaters, and in the spectacles of vanity, which are had gratis in great Citties. But these through their luxury consume their meane estate, and from poverty they fall to Burglaries, Thefts, and Robberies, and are suddenly filled with many and great feares: and these who a little before did sing in an Ale-house, now dreame of the mourning of a prison. But by the study and sight of Stage-playes they are made like to Devils &c. To passe by his sundry notable passages against Players and Stage-playes, in his 1. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, & 8\. Bookes, De Civitate Dei , which I shall touch upon in some other Scenes: in his 17. Sermon, De Verbis Apostols. Tom . 10. pag . 442. he writes. That of those things which delight the sences of the body, some are lawfull; others unlawfull. For these great spectacles of nature, as I have said, delight the eyes; and the spectacles of Play-houses delight the eyes likewise: these are lawfull, those unlawfull. An holy Psalme sung sweetly delights the hearing, and so doe the songs of Stage-players delight the hearing too: This lawfully, the other unlawfully . So that if this Father may be Iudge: the very seeing and hearing of Stage-playes is unlawfull . Heare him but once more for all: De Symbolo ad Catechumenos. lib. 2. cap. 1. 2. Tom. 9. pars I. pag. 1393. 1394, 1395. There are two sorts of Weapons with which the Devill fights against mens soules; pleasures, and feare. Yet beloved, you must know, that the Devill takes more by pleasures, then by feare. For why doth he daily set the Mouse-trap of Stage-playes, the madnesse of filthy studies and pleasures, but that he might take those whom he hath lost with these delights, and reioyce that he hath found that againe which he had lost? What need we runne thorow many things? You are breefly to be admonished, what you ought to reiect, and what to love. Flie Stage-playes, my best beloved, flie (play- houses) the most filthy Dens of the Devill, lest the Chaines of that wicked one hold you captive. But if the minde be to be exhilerated, and delights to behold, the holy Mother the Church will exhibit you those venerable and wholesome spectacles, which will delight your mindes with their pleasure, and will not corrupt but keepe faith in you. Is any of you a lover of the Cirque? What doth he delight in in the Circus? To see the Coachmen striving, the people breathing out frantique furies, every swift one going before breaking the horse of his Adversary. This is all the pleasure to shout, because he hath overcome whom the Devill hath overcome: to reioyce and insult, that the adverse part hath lost an horse, when as he who is delighted with such a spectacle. hath already lost his soule. See on the other side our holy, holesome, and most sweet spectacles. Behold in the Booke of the Acts of the Apostles, a lame man never walking from his birth, whom Peter hath made running: see one suddenly whole, whom before thou didest behold infirme: and if there by any soundnesse of minde in thee, if the reason of equity, and the pleasure of salvation shine forth in thee; see what thou oughtest to behold, consider where thou oughtest to shout: there, where sound horses are broken in pieces, or here where bruised men are made whole? But if that pompe; that coulor of the horses, that composition of the Chariots, those ornaments of the Coachman standing above governing the horses, and desiring to overcome; if this pompe, as I have said delight thee; neither hath he denied this to thee, who hath commanded thee, to renounce the pompes of the Devill: we also have our spirituall Horseman the holy prophet Elijas, who being set upon a fiery Chariot, hath runne so much, that he hath taken the very limits, (or won the goale) of Heaven. And if thou desirest to see the adversaries, which even true vertue hath overcome and whom he by flying hath out-gone, and from whose victory he hath received the reward of supernall greatnesse; he hath cast the Chariots of Pharoh and all his strength into the Sea : Another, perchance a lover of the Theater, is to be admonished, what he must avoyd, and with what he may be delighted, and so may not lose the desire of beholding, but change it. In Play-houses there is a contagion of manners, where people use to learne filthy things, to heare dishonest things, to see pernicious things? But the Lord assisting we may strongly repell these things out of our hearts, if we compare one thing with another. There the Spectators behold I know not what propounded counterfeit god Iove, both committing adultery, and thundring: here, we may againe behold the true God Christ, teaching chastity, destroying filthinesse, preaching holesome things. There, it is feined, that the same love may have Iuno both for his sister and wife: here, we preach holy Mary a Virgin and a Mother together. There, amazement is strucke into the sight, that a man through use should walke upon a rope: here, a great miracle , Peter passing over the Sea on his feet. There, chastity is violated through mimicall filthinesse; here by chaste Susanna, and chaste Ioseph, lust is suppressed, death dispised, God loved, chastity excited. There the quier and singing of the Stage player allureth the hearing, but conquereth the wholesome affection: and what such thing may be compared to our song, in which he who loveth and singeth, saith , Sinners have related unto me their delights, but not so as thy Law O Lord: all thy Commandements are truth? For there vanity feineth all things. Doth any one perchance admire the skill of Climebers or Uaulters, to see little Children playing in the ayre, expressing divers Histories? but looke upon the playes of our Infants; In the wombe of Rebecca two Infaunts strive, the elder comming forth, the feete of the other is seised upon by the hand of the yonger thrust forth of the wombe. , In whose combate the figure of a great mystery is declared, that the yonger should supplant the elder, and should afterwards take away the birth right and blessing from him. In which little ones as it were playing, and exhibiting a great sacrament, as I have said, both the reprobate Iewes are demonstrated in Esau, and the predestinated Christians appeare in Iacob. For that Iacob one little one so pratling, did also manifest, that many little Infants likewise were predestinated in himselfe; who are received out of the Mothers wombe, with the hands of the faithfull; neither doe they so shake them off, that they may hang in the ayre, but that being regenerated they may live in Heaven. The minde therefore may be recreated, and the Christian soule fed with these delights, and keeping this sobriety, it may avoyd the drunkennesse of the Devill. Neither may the combates of the amphitheater seduce or draw any Christians to them, unto which verily men runne so much the more greedily, by how much the more slowly they are exhibited. But even there what not dangerous, what not bloody thing is not iniected into mens eyes? where, as most blessed S. Cyprian saith, a noxious will condemnes men to wilde beasts, without an offence. Therefore my beloved, that cruell spectacle may not invite you to behold two Hunters contending with nine Beares, but let it delight you to see our one Daniel by prayer overcomming seven Lyons. Distinguish combates spirituall lover; see two guilty in will, looke upon one innocent, and full of faith: behold these for an earthly reward to have offred their soules to beasts; behold this man crying in prayer , Deliver not to beasts the soules that confesse to thee. In that spectacle, he who sets it forth is sorrowfull if the Hunter escape without harme who hath slaine him many wilde beasts; but in this our comb aete, there is a fight without Iron, neither is Daniel hurt, nor the wilde beast slaine, and yet he is so overcome, that the King wonders and is changed, and the people feare, and the enemies dispaire. O admirable spectacle of ours, truely admirable! in which God assists, faith impotrates strength, innocency fights, holinesse overcomes, and such a reward is obteined, that both thou and he who shall overcome may receive it, and he who shall give it loseth nothing. Desire these spirituall gifts, come together cheerefully to the Church to behold these things, and to waite for them with all security: recall the purpose of your heart from all carnall lust, commit all your care to be governed by God, that the adversary may feare, finding nothing of his owne in you; and you reiecting him and renouncing his Pompes, after that your liberty shall be rescued from his snares and waylayings, lest that wicked one should finde you empty, whom we have knowne desirous to hold those fast who are not his owne; believe faithfully in God the Father Almighty, &c . By which excellent passage of this iudicious Father, (parallel to which he hath another of the same nature, in his Enarration on the 39\. Psalme , where hee seriously bewailes the vanity and madnesse of those who delight in Stage-playes and such like Spectacles , desiring all Christians to pitty their condition and to pray earnestly to God for their conversion, that so they might see the vanity, and sinfulnesse of this world, and behold the excellency of these many heavenly Spectacles which he there musters up at large, on which Christias should fix their eyes and hearts ;) it is most apparent, that Stage-playes in his iudgement, are very dangerous, obscene, pernicious Spectacles, invented by the Devill to conquer and entrap mens soules; and that no Christians ought for to behold them, since they have so many other heavenly Spectacles to contemplate. Which me thinkes should cause all Christians to renounce them. Not to remember Nilus an ancient Abbot, about the yeere of our Lord 410. who informes us. That he who is conversant in a multitude (especially at Stage-playes) is affected with daily wounds; for the countenance of women is a Dart anoynted with poyson, which wounds the soule and sends in venome, and by how much the longer it continueth by so much the more the wound doth petrifie. He who desires to avoyd these wounds (pray marke it well) will absteine from publike Playes and Spectacles, neither will he be conversant in such Assemblies. For it it better that thou abide at home, then that thou fall into the hands of the enemy, whiles thou thinkest to honor such Solemnities . Which comes punctuall to our purpose. Nor yet to mention, either Primasius in Romanos. cap . 10. fol . 53. Or Remigius, Explanatio in Galat . 5. 19. Or Macarius Ægytius, Homil . 27. pag . 212. Or Isiodor Hispalensis. Originum. lib . 18. cap . 27. 42. to 69\. & De Ecclesiasticis Officijs. lib . 2. cap . 2. Or Haymo & Anselme. Exegesis in Ephesios 5\. 3. who ranke Players with Whores, and couple Play-houses, and Brothel-houses together : (whose words I shall at large recite in the ensuing Scene .) Which proves, that Playes, and Play- houses in their opinion are but Panders to mens lusts, yea, the beaten rodes to whoredome , adultery, and unchaste desires. Nor yet to remember Prosper his verdict, who stiles Stage-playes, mimicall uncleanesses ; not onely in regard of their matter, or manner of action, but likewise of their lewde unchaste effects: Or Damascen , or Eusobius; who call the Stage , Damascen. Paralellorum. lib . 3 cap . 47. See Eusobius Ibidem, & Ecclesiast, Histor, lib . 8. cap . 24. the publike Schoole of lust; and Playes the instruments which perswade men to nothing else, but lewde behaviour, &c. a pregnant testimony for our present purpose. Not to record S. Bernard ; who calls Stage-playes, childish sports, provoking lusts with their feminine and filthy turnings, and representing sordid actions : a punctuall evidence for us: Or Cassiodorus ; who stiles Stage-playes, the expellers of gravity; the exhausters of honesty, &c. Nor yet to register our own learned Country-man Iohn Saresbury , flourishing about the yeere of our Lord 1140. who informes us; That Stage-playes are the fomentations of vices, the apprentiships of vanity . That Stage-players, (whose error had then so prevayled, that they could not be expelled great mens houses) did with their obscene actions, infuse such filthinesse into the eyes of all men, as the Cynicke himselfe might blush to see. And that which was more wonderfull, neither were they then cast out, when as the people making a tumult below, defiled the ayre with their frequent noyse, which being filthily shut in, they more filthily uttered. After which he breakes out into these passages . Can he seeme to thee to be a wise man, who opens either his eyes, or eares to these things? It is verily a pleasant thing, and not dishonest, for an honest man to be sometimes delighted with honest modest myrth; but it is an ignominious thing, for gravity to be often recreated with such wantonnesse. From these Spectacles therefore, but especially from obscene ones, the eye of an honest man is to be kept backe, lest the incontinency of it, bewray likewise the uncleanes of his minde Parides the Colleage of Sophocles the Pretor reproving him, saith very excellently; (I would to God all Nobles and Magistrates would remember it) It becomes Pretor Sophocles, not onely to have chaste hands, but eyes. Yea, a man, to whom much might be lawfull in regard of the great Maiesty of his Kingdome, saith ; Turne away mine eyes lest they behold vanity; knowing that to be true which another lamenteth: because mine eye hath preyed upon my soule . To passe by (I say) these ancient Writers which are punctuall; I shall onely remember two Fathers more with whom I will conclude. The first of them, is Golden-tongued Saint Chrysostome , who writes thus of Stage-playes: that they are the introduction of sinfull lust; the Meditation of Adultery; the Schoole of Fornication; the Exhortation of Uncleanesse; the Examples of Dishonesty; the Incendiaries of mens lustfull Affections; the polluters of their eyes, their eares, their soules : yea the very originall causes of much actuall whoredome. filthinesse, and adultery; as I shall more largely prove in the ensuing Scene out of his owne Records, which I shall there recite at large. The second, is vice-rebuking Salvian, Bishop of Massilia , who thus discyphers Stage-playes: Such things are committed at Playes and Theaters, as cannot be thought upon, much lesse uttered without sinne. For other vices challenge their severall portions within us: as filthy cogitations, the minde; is unchaste aspects, the eyes: wicked speeches, the eares; so that when one of these doth offend, the other may be without fault. But at Theaters, not one of these but sinneth: for both the mind, with lust; and the eyes with shewes, and the eares with hearing are there polluted: all which are so bad, that no man can well report or declare them with honesty. For who without passing the bounds of modesty, can utter these imitations of dishonest things; those filthy spectacles, those lewde motions; those obscene gestures that are used there? the extraordinary sinfulnesse of which may be gathered even from this, that it is unlawfull for to name them. For some sinnes, though most hainous, may well and honestly both be named, and blamed too; as murther, theft, adultery, sacriledge, and such like: onely the impurities of Theaters are such, as may not honestly be, no not so much as blamed. Such new matter ariseth against the reprover in finding fault with their most horrible filthinesse; that albeit he be a most perfect honest man that would speake against it, yet can he not so doe, and keepe his honesty A gaine, all other evils pollute the doers onely, not the beholders or the hearers: for a man may heare a blasphemer and not be partaker of his sacriledge, in as much as he dissenteth from him in minde. And if one come while a robbery is doing, he is not actually guilty of it, because he abhors the fact. Onely the filthinesse of Playes and Spectacles is such, as makes the Actors and Spectators guilty alike. For whiles they gladly looke on, and so approve them by beholding them, they all become Actors of them by sight and assent: so as that of the Apostle may be properly applyed to them. How that not onely those who commit such things, are worthy of death, but they also who favor those that doe them. So that in these representations of whoredome, all the. people, doe altogether in minde play the Harlots. And such as happily come chaste to Stage-playes, returne adulterers from the Theater: For they play the fornicators not then onely when they goe away, but also when they come to Playes. For as soone as one lusteth after a filthy thing, whiles he hasteneth to that which is uncleane, be becommeth uncleane . And so hee proceeds. It is therefore abundantly evident by the concurrent punctuall testimonies of these 30. Fathers, whose words I have here transcribed; to whom I might have added, Clemens Romanus , Iren aeus , Epipbanius , Philolud[illeg.] aeus , Cyrillus Alexandrinus , Theoderet , Beda , Alchuvinus , Anexagoras , Olympio[illeg.]orus , Orosius , Iulius Firmicus , Gratian , with others , whom I shall quote hereafter in their more proper Scenes; That Stage-playes pollute the eyes, the eares, the mindes, both of their Actors and Spectators, by ingendring unchaste, adulterous lewde affections in their hearts, by their obscene words, and lascivious gestures . That they irritate, inflame, foment those beastly carnall lusts, which draw them on to actuall uncleanesse , to their eternall ruine: and so by necessary consequence, that they are utterly unlawfull for Christians, to act, to see, to heare, or resort to even in this regard, as they all from hence conclude. And dare any Play-patron then reject these grave Authorities, in iustifying, in frequenting Stage playes, as innoxious, honest, chaste, or usefull recreations, after all these Fathers censures? If any Stage-frequenting, Play- adoring Christian bee so incredulous, as not to give credit to these alleaged Fathers: let him then listen to some Councels , some moderne Christian Authors ; some ancient Pagans , who averre the selfesame truth, whose ioynt concurrent Authorities he cannot deny.

An irrefragable confirmation of our present Assumption. If we survey againe those moderne Christian Authors, who have written against Stage-playes, we shall finde them all concurring with us in this truth; I shall onely recite some few of them, by which you may easily conjecture of the rest Cirques and Theaters (writes Francis Petrarcha) are the two places which have beene knowne to be alwayes most opposite to good manners, whether if any bad man goe; he will returne much worse: For this iourny (pray observe it) is altogether unknowne to good men; who if they ignorantly chance to goe unto them by any accident, are sure not to want defilement. Stage-playes which thou willingly beholdest, are such things, as can neither be honestly acted, nor honestly seene; neither is it easie to tell, whether the Actor or the Spectator be more infamous; or whether the Stage be more filthy then the Scaffold; unlesse it be, that poverty oft-times drawes men into the one, but vanity alwayes into the other . Neither is there a greater consumption of Patrimonies at Stage-playes, then of manners; where lust is learned, humanity forgotten. What you might expect from Stage-playes, even from the very beginning, the first of your Kings , Romulus, may give you a guesse, who by these circumvented that raged, rough unpleasant chastity of the Sabine Virgins; albeit the honor of matrimony hath in some sort covered that offence. But to how many since this have Stage-playes beene the way, not to wedlocke but to whoredome, and disorderly liberty? I will that thou remember this as the summe of all; that chastity hath beene oft-times overthrowne by Stage-playes, alwayes assaulted. And that I may not speake of men, the fury of whose wickednesse is such, that they doe now welnigh even glory in adultery: the good name, and chastity of many women hath there perished: many have thence returned home unchaste, more ambiguous, but not one more honest: These are the events, these the fruits of Stage-playes : (And are they then desirable, or true Christian pleasures?) Now who would willingly stretch out his throat to receive the sword that cuts it? who will poure out more blood out of his bleeding wound? who will become lesse fearefull at the sight of death? What doth it availe you to run to the Schoole of lust and cruelty? You need no Masters; you are naturally too docible of evill things. You learne more at home by your selves, then is needfull: what will you learne if these Artificers of wickednesse, and the Mistresse, of errors, the multitude, should be added to such ready wits? Many, whom nature had made meeke, and chaste, have Stage-playes taught cruelty, and incontinency. The minde of man which is naturally prone to vices is not therefore to be instigated, but brideled: if it be left to it selfe, it will hardly stand; if it be violently driven forward, it will fall downe hedlong. Much evill is conveyed into us by the eares, but much more by the eyes: by them, as by two open windowes doth death breake in upon the soule: Nothing more powerfully sinkes into the memory, then that which is apprehended by the eye: things that are onely heard doe easily passe away; the images of the things we see sticke fast in our mindes even against our wills: yet notwithstanding they doe not offer themselves undesired, but so such who willingly behold them, unlesse it be very seldome, and that in a transitory manner to passe soone away. Whether goest then therefore? what impetus or gust doth violently dragge thee? that thou shouldest reioyce but for an houre, in that which thou maist chance eternally to lament: that thou shouldest run to see that once the very sight of which thou maist thousand times repent off. I know not what pleasant, or rather what not bitter, or sorrowfull thing, you perceive in Stage-playes: neither doe I discerne any other greater argument of madnesse in you, then that I see you daily allured unto death by miserable entisements, and as if you were drowned in an infernall slumber, a bitter sweetnesse, and an unpleasant pleasure, precipitates you. For there is one rule almost of all things to you; Whatever you desire, whatever you endeaver, whatever you doe, is against your selves . Thus Petrarcha , most elegantly, most divinely.

Who all with one unanimous Vote condemne all Stage-playes, as altogether abominable unto Christians, from this very reason among sundry others; that they irritate and foment mens carnall lusts: pollute their soules with adulterous affections, defile their eyes, their eares, their hearts with filthinesse; and allure, ye precipitate both their Actors and Spectators to all actuall lewdnesse, and execrable uncleanesses; being as so many Panders, Bellowes. and Firebrands to their vile lascivious desires . But passing by all these with a briefe quotation of their names and workes, to which you may resort, as being too tedious to recite at large; I shall onely relate unto you what 4. other Authors of our owne have written, concerning the lewde effects of Stage- playes. The first of them is reverend Bishop Babington , who writes thus of Playes. These prophane and wanton Stage-playes or Enterludes, what an occasion they are of adultery and uncleanesse by gesture, by speech, by convayances, by devices to attaine to so ungodly desires, the world knoweth by too much hurt, by long experience. Vanities they are if we make the best of them, and the Prophet prayeth to have his eyes turned away by the Lord from beholding such matter. Evill words corrupt good manners, & they have abundance. There is in them, ever many dangerous sights, and we must abstaine from all appearance of evill. They corrupt the eyes with alluring gestures; the eyes, the heart; and the heart the body, till all be horrible before the Lord . Histrionicis Gestibus inquinantur omnia ( saith Chrysostome .) These Players behaviour polluteth all things: And of their Playes he saith; they are the feasts of Satan, the inventions of the Devill, &c. Councels have decreed very sharpely against them, and polluted bodies by these filthy occasions have on their death-beds confessed the danger of them, lamented their owne soule and grievous faults, and left their warning for ever with us to beware of them. But I referre you to them, that upon good knowledge of the abominations of them, have written largely and well against them If they be dangerous in the day time, more dangerous are they in the night certainely: if on a Stage, and in open Courts, much more in Chambers and private houses. For there are many roomes besides that where the Play is; and peradventure the strangenesse of the place, and lacke of light to guide them, causeth error in their way, more then good Christians should in their houses suffer . Thus this right godly Prelate of our Church, who makes Stage-playes a breach of the 7. Commandement , because they are the frequent occasions both of contemplative, and actuall fornication, and the inducements to it. The second, is one Master Stephen Gosson , (once a professed Play-poet ; yea a great Patron, and admirer of Playes and Players , as himselfe confesseth, till God had called him to repentance, and opened his eyes to see their abominablenesse :) who among other things, writeth thus of Stage-playes. As I have already discovered the corruption of Playes, by the corruption of their causes; the Efficient, the Master, the Forme, the End; so will I conclude the effects, that this poyson workes among us. The Devill is not ignorant how mightily these outward Spectacles effeminate and soften the hearts of men; vice is learned with beholding; sinne is tickled, desire pricked, and those impressions of minde are secretly conveyed over to the gazers, which the Players counterfeit on the Stage. As long as we know our selves to be flesh beholding those examples in Theaters that are incident to flesh, we are taught by other mens examples how to fall. And they that come honest to a Play, may depart infected. Lactantius doubteth, whether any corruption can be greater, then that which is daily bred by Playes, because the expressing of vice by imitatien, brings us by the shadow, to the substance of the same. Whereupon he affirmeth them necessary to be banished, lest wickednesse be learned, or with the custome of pleasure by little and little we forget God. What force there is in the gestures of Players, may be gathered by the tale of Bacchus and Ariadne, which Xenophon reporteth to be played at a banquet, by a Syracusian, his Boy, and his dancing Trull. In came the Syracusian, not unlike to the Prologue of our Playes, discoursing the argument of the fable: then entred Ariadne, gorgeously attired like a bride, and sate in the presence of them all : after came Bacchus, dancing to the Pipe : Ariadne perceiving him , though she neither rose to meete him, nor stirred from the place to welcome him, yet she shewed by her gesture that she sate upon thornes . When Bacchus beheld her, expressing in his dance the passions of love, he placed himselfe somewhat neere to her, and embraced her: she with an amorous kinde of feare and strangenesse, as though she would thrust him away with the little finger, and pull him againe with both her hands, somewhat timorously and doubtfully entertained him . At this the beholders began to shout, when Bacchus rose up, tenderly lifting Ariadne from her seate; no small store of curtesie passing betweene them, the beholders rose up, every man stood on tiptoe, and seemed to hover over the prey: when they sware, the company sware: when they departed to bed, the company presently was set on fire: they that were married posted home to their wives: those that were single vowed solemnly to be wedded . (A very notable History for our present purpose, especially as Xenophon hath related it:) As the stinge of Phalangion spredeth her person thorow every vaine, when no hurt is seene, so amorous gesture stickes to the heart when no skin is raced. Therefore Cupid is painted with Bow and Arrowes, because it is the property of lust to wound alooffe, which being well weighed ; Saint Cyprian had very good cause to complaine; that Players are spots to our manners, nourishers of vice, and corrupters of all things by their gestures. The godly Father, knowing the practice of Playing to be so evill, and the inconveniences so monstrous that grew thereby ; thinkes the Maiesty of God to be stained, the honor of his Church defaced, when Players are admitted to the Table of the Lord. Neither was this the opinion of Saint Cyprian alone, but of the whole assembly of godly Fathers in the Councell held under Constantius the Emperour. Great then is the hardnesse of our hearts when neither Fathers, nor Councels nor God himselfe strikes us with any shame of that, which every good man is ashamed to remember. Mine eyes throughly beheld the manner of Theaters when I wrote Playes my selfe , and found them to be The very Markets of Bavvdery; where choyce without shame hath beene as free, as it is for your money in the Royall Exchange, to take a short stocke or a long; a faling Band, or a French Ruffe. The first building of Theaters was to ravish the Sabines, and that they were continued in whoredome ever after , Ovid confesseth in these words : Scilicet ex isso solennia more Theatra, Nune quoque formosis insidiosa manent. As at the first, so now; Theaters are snares to faire women. And as I told you long agoe in my Schoole of abuses ; our Theaters and Play-houses in London are as full of secret adultery as they were in Rome. In Rome it was the fashion of wanton yong men, to place themselves as nigh as they could to the Curtesans, to present them Pome- granates, to play with their garments, and waite on them home when the sport was done . In the Play-houses at London, it is the fashion of Youthes to goe first into the Yard, and to carry their eye thorow every Gallery, then like unto Ravens, where they spy the Carrion thither they fly, and presse as neere to the fairest as they can. In stead of Pome-granats they give them Pippins, they dally with their Garments to passe the time , they minister talke upon all occasions, & either bring them home to their houses on small acquaintance, or slip into Tavernes when the Playes are done. He thinketh best of his painted Sheath, and taketh himself for a iolly fellow, that is noted of most to be busiest with women in all such places. This open corruption is a pricke in the eyes of them that see it, and a thorne in the sides of the godly when they heare it. This is a poyson to the beholders, and a Nursery of idlenesse to the Players . Thus far Master Gosson , who in his Schoole of Abuse, hath much more to this purpose. The third of them is Master Iohn Brinsly , an eminent worthy Divine: who writes thus of Stage-playes. But to passe over these also, with all other unlawfull flockings and lewde sports upon the Sabbath, by every of which the worke of the Lord is hindred, as every one must needs acknowledge. What defence can we make for that concourse that is ordinary to those wanton Playes in such places, even upon that day? In which are the continuall sowings of all Atheisme, and throwing the very firebrands of all filthy and noysome lusts into the hearts of poore simple soules: the stirring up and blowing the coales of concupiscence to kindle and increase the fire threof, to breake out into an hideous flame untill it burne downe to Hell. Aske but your owne hearts as in the presence of the Lord, and you will need no further witnesse. And how can it be otherwise? how can you take these firebrands of Hell into your bosomes, and not be burnt? Is not every filthy speech, every whorish gesture, such a firebrand cast by Satan into the heart of every wanton beholder, as a brand cast into a bundle of Tow, or into a barrell of Gun-powder, to set all on fire of a sudden ? Thy protection is gone whosoever thou art, that adventurest hither, for thou art out of thy wayes. These are not the wayes of the Lord, and much lesse upon his Sabbath, when thou shouldest be amongst his people, and doing his worke, where his Angels waite for thee, his owne presence expects thee. How then shouldest thou possibly escape when then wilt offer thy heart naked unto these fiery darts of Satan? how canst thou thinke to be delivered from that flame in thy soule; that fire in the infernall lake, that river of brimstone that shall never be consumed nor quenched. when thou wilt desperately cast thy selfe headlong into the middest thereof? how can it be but that such must needs bring fagots and firebrands to set in the Gates of our Hierusalem ? The fourth of them is M. Robert Bolton , a reverend learned Minister of our Church, now living; who writes thus of Stage-playes. Lastly, let those examine themselves at this marke, who offer themselves to these sinfull occasions, breeders of many strange and fearefull mischiefes, I meane prophane and obscene Playes. Pardon me, beloved, I cannot passe by these abominable Spectacles without particular indignation. For I have ever esteemed them (since I had any understanding in the wayes of God) the Grand empoysoners of Grace, ingenousnesse, and all manly resolution; Greater plagues and infections to your soules, then the contagious pestilence to your bodies: The inexpiable staine and dishonour to this famous City. The noysome Wormes that canker and blast the generous and noble Buds of this Land: and doe by a slie and bewitching insinuation, so empoyson all Seeds of Vertue, and so weaken and emasculate all the operations of the soule, with a prophane, if not an unnaturall dissolutenesse ; that whereas they are planted in these worthy houses of Law, to be fitted and enabled for great and honourable actions, for the publike good, and the continuance of the glory and happinesse of this Kingdome; they licentiously dissolve into wicked vanities and pleasures: and all hope of ever doing good either unto God, the Church, their Country, or owne soules, melteth as the Winter Ice, and floweth away as unprofitable waters. These infamous Spectacles are condemned by all kinde of sound learning, both divine and humane. Distinctions devised for their upholding, and defence, may give some shallow and weake contentment to partiall, and sensuall affections, possest with preiudice: but how shall they be able to satisfie a conscience sensible of all appearance of evill? How can they preserve the inclinablenesse of our corrupt nature from the infection of these Schooles of Levvdnesse, and Sinckes of all Sinne, as, (to omit Divines, Councels, Fathers, Moralists, because the point is not directly incident) even a Politician calls them. Alas, are not our wretched corruptions raging and fiery enough, being left to themselves dispersed at their naturall liberty; but they must be united at these accursed Theaters, as in a hollow glasse, to set on fire the whole body of our naturall viciousnesse at once, and to enrage it further with lust, fiercenesse, and effeminatenesse, beyond the compasse of nature ? Doth any man thinke it possible that the power of saving Grace, or the pure Spirit of God can reside in his heart, that willingly and with full consent feeds his inward concupiscence, with such variety of sinfull vanities, and lewd occasions, which the Lord himselfe hath pronounced to be , an abomination unto him? how can any man, that ever felt in his heart the love or feare of so dreadfull a Maiesty, as the Lord of Heaven and Earth, endure to be present especially with delight and contentment, as Oathes Blasphemies, Obscenities, and the abusing sometimes of the most precious things in the Booke of God, (whereat we should tremble) to most base and scurrill iests? Certainely every Child of God, is of a most noble and heroicke spirit, and therefore is most impatient of hearing any wrong, indignity; or dishonor offered to the Word, Name, or Glory of his Almighty Father, &c. Thus this grave reverend Divine; in proofe of my Assumption. If any man deeme all these or any of the fore- quoted Fathers and Councels over-partiall, in the case of Playes, let him then attend unto some Pagan Authors, who concurre in iudgement with them. Not to recite the fore-mentioned Story of the Syracusian with his Boy and Trull , who acting Bacchus and Ariadne , (as Xenophon relates it) enflamed the fleshly lusts of all the Spectators in a strange excessive measure : (a sufficient experiment to confirme my Minors truth:) Aristotle himselfe records it: That those who behold the motions, and actions of Players in Stage-playes, although there be neither verse, nor singing in them, are yet notwithstanding so moved, and affected as the things are acted in them : so that if the things they act, be filthy or lascivious, the affections, the actions, the desires of the Spectators must bee such: This therefore (writes he) is to be commended, that the tender mindes of Children be with-drawen, not onely from the hearing, but likewise from the sight of filthy servile things. Therefore the Lawgiver, if he doth any other thing, ought verily, even utterly to banish all obscenity of speech out of the City. For the liberty of doing filthily and obscenely, is next to the liberty of speaking filthiy and obscenely: therefore obscenities are especially to be exterminated from yong tender mindes, that they neither heare nor speake any such thing. But if any one shall be deprehended either to speake or doe any of the things prohibited, if he be a Free-man, and so yong as to be liable to correction, he shall be shamed, and beaten with Rods: But if he be too old to be thus chastised, he shall be branded with some servile disgrace for this his slavish offence. And because we prohibit the speech of any such thing, we doe likewise verily inhibit the Spectacles both of unchaste Pictures and Fables. Therefore Magistrates must take care that ne filthinesse or obscenity be shewed neither in Shewes, nor Pictures; Vnlesse it be where there are such gods (and I am sure our holy God, who is purer of eyes then to behold iniquity , is not such a one) to whom such lasciviousnesse is granted by the Lawes, and among whom those who are of riper yeeres are permitted to offer sacrifices, or to performe religious worship for themselves, their Children and Wives. But the Law must prohibite yong men to be Spectators, both of Iambickes, and Comedies, before they come to their full age, when as education or discipline shall have made them free, from all the inconveniences both of drunkennesse it selfe, and of all other things that issue from it. Neither verily did Theodorus the Tragedian perchance erre in this, that he would not permit any, no not the slightest Actor, to act before him, because the Spectators are wont most commonly to be more taken and delighted with those things which they first heare. For this very thing is incident both to the nature and use of things themselves, that the first things are most acceptable and dilightfull. Wherefore all evill things are to be removed from Children, but especially all lewdnesse and lasciviousnesse ; which is most rife in Stage-playes. Thus Aristotle , whose words I would our Magistrates, our Parents would consider. Xenophon , informes us: that the Persians did never so much as speake of any amorous things to Youths, lest levity ioyning it selfe to that vehement lust which was in them, they should immoderatly addict themselves to these their lusts : intimating thereby; that amorous obscene words; ( much more then lewde lascivious, ribaldrous Stage-playes , in which filthy speeches, verses, ditties, gestures, shewes, and actions are united) are as fire and fewell to mens lusts; as himselfe recordeth in his forementioned Story. Plato relates, that Comicall and Tragicall Poems and Poets, effeminate mens mindes, corrupt their iudgements, provoke laughter, treat of lecherous things, nourish and water mens sinfull lusts, which should be dried up; giving them a comanding power over men, when as they should be subiect to them: and for these and such like reasons he excludes all Poets, and Stage-playes out of his Common-wealth, as inchaunting and bewitching mischiefes, that foment and stirre up those corruptions which every man should labour to the utmost to avoyd . Cornelius Tacitus rankes Theaters and Stewes together : assuring us from his owne experience; that all kindes of wickednesses and infamy did issue from them in an apparant manner; and that no filth did yeeld more plenty of lusts to corrupt manners, then Playes. Therefore divers of the Senators and people exclaimed against Pompie, for building Galleries about the Stage, wherein the people might sit the greater part of the day beholding Stage- playes, which did by little and little corrupt, yea utterly abolish and subvert their Country manners, inducing them to exercise dishonest loves, and drawing them on to commit that lewdnesse in the night, which they lustfully beheld and desired in the day time . This was the fruit of Stage-playes then, which made this Author to condemne them, and many grave Senators to declaime against them. Seneca the Philosopher informes us: That in Stage-playes vices doe game a more easie passage into our hearts. And that those men and women who harden their fore-heads by frequenting Stage-playes, doe wholy neglect Philosophy, and passe over to the Stewes or Brothel-house at last; a thing he much laments, as being the common practise of his age : Wherefore he adviseth Lucilius to avoyd all Playes, together with the ill company that frequented them; who were able to corrupt even Socrates, Cato, and L aelius themselves; much more then those of meaner vertue; who are never able to withstand the violence of these vices (which are accompanied and backed by the multitude,) even then when they doe most arme themselves against them; much lesse, when as they are not fitted to resist them . To passe by the 12. Epistle of Marcus Aurelius to Lambert , which I shall quote hereafter; even Ovid himselfe acknowledgeth; that Stage-playes are meere Bawdes and Panders to mens lusts; that they were the causes of much whoredome, lewdnesse and adultery, even from their very first invention, to the times in which he lived; Therefore in his Art of Loving, he adviseth all amorous, unchaste, lascivious persons to haunt Theaters, as being the places that were most suitable, most advantageous to their unchaste desires, where they should seldome misse their prey : And after, in his Penetentiary Elegies, for these wanton Bookes of Love, for which he was exiled: he informes Augustus; that Playes are the Seminaries of lewdnesse, the causes of much sinne, much whoredome, and adultery in many; wherefore he adviseth him to demolish all Theaters, to abandon all Cirques, and blocke up all passages to them both, as being the publike Marts where Adulterers and Adulteresses commonly met without controll, to conclude their adulterous bargaines, and make up their unchaste meretricious matches . A most pregnant ratification of our present Assumption ; and a passage worth the noting, because a most lascivious Poet, , (who was as farre from Puritanisme or over-strict Precisenesse, as he was from Christianity) hath registred it to Posterity , as an experimentall truth: The Poet Horace doth couple Whores and Stage- haunters together, as being equally adulterous, and unchaste : Moreover hee stiles Stage-playes, base Playes ; which men ought not to esteeme ; but to account as toyes and trisles, which yet notwithstanding bring men into serious evils, and by their pleasantnesse impell the mindes of the Auditors to what-ever they please . The Poet Iuvenal tells us in plaine termes. That a man in his time could not picke forth one chaste woman, which he might safely love as his wife, out of the whole Play-house: That all women (let such who have beautifull gadding Play-haunting Wives, and Daughters marke it,) who frequent Stage-playes, or love lascivious mixt dancing, are incontinent, unchaste, and in famous persons, who have forfaited their good names, and beare out their dishonest actions with their audacious cariage. That they are such who burne in unchaste, in filthy lusts, and commit adultery in earnest, (as they did in their solemne feasts of Priapus,) not in sport or representation onely: in so much that they would prostitute themselves to servants, to hired Water-bearers, and the very basest persons for want of others, rather then not satisfie their beastly raging lusts : Such were the Play-haunting females in this Poets age; and I feare that ours are but little better now, as I shall expresly prove in the next ensuing Scene. You see then, how all the fore-recited Fathers, Councels, moderne Christian Writers, and ancient Pagan Authors give punctuall testimony to my Minors truth, which no one Author to my knowledge, whether ancient or moderne, Christian or Pagan, did ever yet gainsay: therefore we may resolve upon it without any further scruple; and thereupon reject, renounce all Stage-playes , as the defilements of mens eyes, mens eares, mens soules : the incendiaries, the fomenters of filthy lusts: the very Panders, allurements, and provocations to contemplative, to actuall uncleanesse, whoredome, adultery, and the like, which bring destruction to mens soules. And indeed, how can they choose but irritate mens lusts, and draw them on to lewde unchaste affections, and meretricious filthy practises. For when a man shall delightfully behold adulteries, whoredomes, incests, together with all other obscene abominations, even lively personated , emphatically expressed before his face; When he shall heare these beastly sinnes applauded, varnished and set out to sale with the most elegant expressions; the most rhetoricall, patheticall, flexanimous, encomiums: the most insinuating Love-complements, and amorous streines of wit, of eloquence , that either the oratory of Hell, or lust can reach to: when he shall seriously contemplate those lascivious gestures, dances, complements, embracements: those meretricious kisses, claspings and dalliances: those wanton smiles, those petulant nods, those unchaste signes, those lust-irritating motions which passe betweene amorous Love-sicke Actors . When he shall heare such scurrilous Pastorals, such ribaldrous Ditties, such inescating Love-sonnets; such effeminate, overcomming, heart-resolving Musicke, which prepare the Auditors to uncleanesse, & subiect them as so many Captives to their enraged lusts . When both his eyes , his eares, affections, heart, and all his senses shal be wholy taken up, with such amorous, beautifull lust-provoking obiects as are able to reviue the most mortified carnall affections; to fire, the most frozen benummed lusts ; to overcome the most chaste and continent heart; (all which concurre at once in Stage-playes:) how can it but ingender, not onely a sparke or two, but an whole flame, an Hell of filthy lusts within his soule ; and carry him on to all uncleanesse even with a full carere? We all know by wofull experience, that all men (but especially yong men and women , who are the most assiduous Play-haunters) are exceeding prone by nature to unchaste adulterous desires, to fleshly lusts which warre against their soules : no sinnes so consonant to their depraved natures as these . Hence is it, that those who live the most retired lives; who keepe the most constant watch over their owne deceitfull hearts: who most mortisie and keepe under their rebellious carnall lusts by prayer and fasting; by substracting all that fewell, that provision which should nourish them: who abstaine from all appearance of evill; from all those lascivious lust-enflaming obiects, which might either steine their soules with unchaste desires, or defile their bodies with adulterous copulations, are oft-times vexed and assaulted; yea sometimes vanquished, and foyled by their carnall lusts : as the examples of Lot , David , Saint Paul , Saint Hierom , and some others testifie. And if these men oft-times fall into these lustfull passions of their owne accord , even then when as they have kept watch and ward against them, by avoyding all occasions which might provoke them to them: how much more then must our common Actors and Play-haunters , who adde fire, spurres, and fewell to their enraged, unbrideled lusts in Stage-playes, be much more conquered and subdued by them. If he who keepes the farthest distance from lascivious lust-enraging Stage-playes, can hardly keepe his affections, his body within the bounds of chastity; how then can they be chaste in minde, in body, who live and wallow in them with delight . Alas, how can the weakest stand, when the strongest fall? How can the carelesse be secure, where the most vigilant are surprised? How can unmortified gracelesse Yongsters continue chaste, untainted, unpolluted, either in thought, in soule, in body, in the very middest of all the temptations, the defilements of lust-irritating polluted obiects; in the very Stewes and Brothel-house of lust; the very Schoole and Shop of Venery, Lechery, and Lewdnesse ; (for so some stile the Play-house :) when as the most mortified gracious Christians, who have retired themselves wholy from all carnall obiects ; who have with-drawne their eyes, their eares, their thoughts from all lust-fomenting pleasures of sinne, have yet beene desteined with uncleane affections , in the very middest of holy duties in their private Closets? Since therefore the very dearest of Gods Saints, who alwayes warre against their lusts , are oft-times foyled, vexed, or disturbed by them , even then when as there are no externall objects to tempt them: much more then must common Actors and Play-haunters, who yeeld themselves over as slaves, as vassalls to their untamed carnall lusts, be steined, conquered , and controlled by them. And here I appeale unto the consciences of Players, of Play-haunters for proofe of this effect. Doe not your owne hearts experimentally informe you, that there are many sinfull swarmes and flames of lust , many lewde unchaste affections oft kindled in your brests by the very acting, sight, and hearing of lascivious Stage-playes ? Doe not the wanton gestures; the amorous kisses, complements, and salutes; the meretricious songs and speeches; the lascivious whorish Actions; the beautifull faces; the ravishing Musicke, the flexanimous enticements, the witty obscenities, the rhetoricall passages, the adulterous representations, with al the other fomentations of uncleanesse in the Play- house,( which are as so many fiery darts of Satan to wound our soules with lust; as so many Conduict-pipes, or Chariots to usher concupiscence into our hearts , thorow the doores, the portals of our eyes and eares ;) even raise a tempest of unchaste affections; yea kindle a very hell of lusts within your soules? Do not they strongly instigate & inrege your carnvil mindes adding much sewell unto your lewde desires ? Doe not they fraught your eyes , your eares, your hearts with filthy obiects, so that they cannot cease from sinne ? Have they not caused you to looke upon Whores and Strumpets, upon beautifull comely women with a lustfull eye, and so to commit, if not actuall, yet contemplative adultery with them in your hearts, either more or lesse ? If you deny all this, your owne consciences , together with all the fore- recited Fathers, Councels, Christian and Pagan Authors will presently convince you of a lie. If you acknowledge it; as needs you must; since your owne consciences , with all the premises will force you to confesse it , you must certainely ioyne hands, ioyne hearts, and iudgements with me in censuring, in condemning Stage-playes, because they contaminate and defile both their Actors, their Spectators soules and bodies; because they thus instigate, nourish, and enflame their inseperable sinfull fleshly lusts which war against their soules ; which should be mortefied, and subdued ; not fostered, not fomented , as they are. whoredome, and uncleanesse, which are no wayes tolerable among Christians: From whence this 30. Argument doth arise. That which is an immediate occasion, furtherance, or fomentation of much actuall adultery, fornication, whoredome, and uncleanesse, must needs be abominable, and utterly unlawfull unto Christians, But such are Stage-playes, as I shall cleerely manifest. Therefore they must needs be abominable, and utterly unlawfull unto Christians. My Minor must bee yeelded, because adultery, fornication, whoredome, with all other actuall uncleanesse , (however men may chance to slight them as meere triviall, veniall sins) are most damnable soule-murthering abominations . which God, which Christian men abhorre. The sinfulnesse, the damnablenesse, of these foule crying sinnes, (which, alas; are now so frequent in the world , that the commonnesse of them hath made them tollerable, if not commendable and lawfull in the eyes of many, who are so farre from being ashamed of, that they even boast and glory in these lascivious wickednesses ;) will easily appeare by these particulars: First, they are sinnes against the expresse letter of the 7. Commandement. Thou shalt not commit adultery : as all ancient, and moderne Expositors of this Commandement testifie. Secondly, they are sinnes, abundantly condemned thorowout the Old and New Testament, as abominable and highly displeasing unto God ; whose wrath none can stand under. Thirdly, they are the very workes and products of the flesh ; issuing alwayes from a polluted heart devoyd of grace . Fourthly, they are those execrable sinnes, those abominable pollutions wherein the Idolatrous Pagan Gentiles lived; whose lewdnesse Christians must not imitate . Fistly, they are those shamefull, desperate filthy workes of darknesse which the most audacious miscreants are afraide, yea utterly ashamed to commit in the day-time, in the face and view of others, out of a selfe-guiltinesse, an inward consciousnesse of their vilenesse ; in the act of which if any are deprehended, they are in the very terrors of the shadow of death; like men distracted they know not what to doe, nor whether to flie, the very foulenesse of the fact amazing them, and the least noyse affrighting them . Sixtly, they are sinnes which most abominably pollute the bodies and soules of men, making them odious both in the eyes of God, and men . Seventhly, they are sinnes which bring abundance of shame, of dishonour upon the persons, families, and posterities of those who are guilty of them, and even quite deprive them of their glory: a wound, a dishonour shall they get, and their reproach shall not be wiped away ; as the very wisest of men informes us. Sixtly, they are sinnes which wholy infatuate and steale away mens hearts; so that they are as an Oxe that goeth to the slaughter; or as a foole who is led to the correction of the stockes; till a dart shrike thorow their liver; or as a Bird that hastneth to the snare, not knowing that it is for his life . Yea these sinnes doe so besot men, that they can neither consider the danger of them; nor yet use meanes for to escape them. Ninthly, they consume, they putrifie, not onely the soules, the spirits, but the very bodies, and estates of men, bringing them even to a morsell of bread . Tenthly, they ingenerate many filthy loathsome diseases , which oft-times so putrisie the bodies of lewde adulterous persons, that they even stinke above ground, becoming odious, yea intollerable to themselves and others: which made S. Chrysostome to affirme, that an adulterer even in this life, before he goes to Hell, is the most miserable, the most wretched of all men . Eleventhly, they are such sinnes, as are not so much as once to be named (much lesse then practised) among Christians, whom they doe not become ; those therefore are no true Christians who take pleasure in them. Twefely, they are such sinnes, as exclude men, both from the society of Gods Children here, who are not so much as to converse, or eate with fornicators, or adulterers : and likewise from the Word, the Sacraments, the publike Assemblies of the Saints; from which all Fornicators, Adulterers, Strumpets, and unchaste persons are ipso facto by the very Law of God, and man, to be excommunicated; that so they may be delivered up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, till they shall give some outward actuall testimony of their sincere repentance for these sins . Thirteenthly, they are such sins, as make a man exceeding guilty in Gods sight. A man may as well take fire in his bosome, and his cloathes not be burnt; or goe upon coles, and his feet not be scorched, as goe into his neighbours wife, and yet be innocent : Whence Salomon informes us; that a strange woman increaseth transgressions amongst men . Fourteenthly, they are sinnes which oft-times shorten and cut off the lives of men: and draw on murther after them: For as the Adultresse will hunt for the precious life of a man : so iealousie is the rage of a man; therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance: he will not regard any ransome, neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts . These sinnes were the cause that the Sonnes of Iacob slew the Scehemites and spoiled their City, for ravishing and using their Sister Dinah as an Whore. These were the death of all those Isralites who committed whoredome with the Daughters of Moab, whom God himselfe commanded to be slaine. These occasioned the warre betweene the Beniamites and the other Tribes of the Children of Israell, in which there were threescore and five thousand men and upwards slaine; yea, the whole Tribe of Benjamin where the Levites Concubine was ravished, (which occasioned this warre,) were almost utterly destroyed, there being 600\. men of them onely left alive by meanes of these men-slaying sins . These sins caused David, to destroy Vriah: Absalom to murther his Brother Ammon for ravishing his Sister Tamar. These have beene alwayes accompanied with much murther and bloodshed in all ages : these have caused the Husband, to murther his Wife; the Wife, to poyson her Husband: one Whore-master to murther his Corrivals to the selfe-same Strumpet: yea these have caused unnaturall Mothers to murther their owne spurious Issues, to conceale their lewdnesse ; as Authors, as our owne Statutes , and experience teach us: therefore they must needs be crying, because they are bloody sinnes. Fiftenthly, they are such sinnes which offer an high indignity to the whole Trinity. First, to God the Father, not onely in taking those bodies that are his, which were made for himselfe alone, not for fornication; and giving them up as professed instruments of sinne, to lust, to lewdnesse, to Satan, to all uncleanesse : but likewise in contaminating, oblitterating, and casting dirt, yea sinne, upon his most holy Image stamped on them. Secondly, to Iesus Christ our Lord, in taking those bodies which are his members, purchased with his most precious blood, that they might be preserved pure and chaste to him; and making them the members of an Harlot . Thirdly, to God the holy Ghost; in desiling those bodies, which are the Temples of the holy Ghost, which is in us; who cannot indure any pollution, especially in his Temples, which should be alwayes holy, as he is holy . And who is there so desperately wicked, that dares thus affront the whole Trinity it selfe by these cursed filthy sinnes ? Sixteenthly, they are sinnes of which men very seldome repent. A Whore (saith Salomon) is a deepe Ditch, and a strange woman is a narrow Pit ; (out of which men can hardly recover themselves:) None that goe into her returne againe, neither take they hold of the pathes of Life : And who then would ingage his soule upon such irrecoverable inepenitable sins as these? Seventeenthly, these sinnes are the very high-way to Hell, the beaten rode to eternall death : the end of them is bitter as wormwood, sharpe as a two-edged sword . Wherefore Salomon exhorts his Sonne; to remove his way farre from a strange woman, and not to come nigh the doore of her house ; (a place well worthy their observation, who feare not for to run to Whore-houses, or to cast themselves upon the temptations, the enticements of Strumpets, as too many doe,) For her house inclineth unto death, and her pathes unto the dead: her feet goe downe to death, her steps take hold of hell: her house is the way to hell, going downe to the chambers of death: None that goe into her returne againe, neither take they hold of the path of Life . Eighteenthly, they are sinnes against the very bodies and soules of men. Against the bodies of men; as the Apostle witnesseth. Flee fornication; every sinne that a man doth is without the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his owne body: that is , in defiling it ; in dishonouring it; in impayring it; in destroying it. Against the soules of men, as Salomon testifieth: Who so (saith he) committeth adultery with an woman lacketh understanding; he that doeth it, destroyeth his owne soule . And who would be so inhumanely, so atheistically desperate, as to destroy both soule and body for ever, to enjoy the momentany bitter-sweetnesse of these filthy sinnes? Nineteenthly; they are sinnes, which disable men to performe any holy duty acceptable to God . Sinnes, into which few fall, but such as are abhorred of the Lord, and given up to a reprobate sence, to worke all wickednesse even with greedinesse. Sinnes, which devoure to destruction, and roote out all a mans increase. Sinnes , which cause the earth to rise up against men, and the fire not blowne to devoure them. Sinnes , which draw downe the temporall, the eternall wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. These were the sinnes that destroyed the old world with water : which consumed the Citties of Sodom and Gomorrah with fire from Heaven; Which caused three and twenty thousand of the Isralites to fall in one day . These were the sinnes, that caused God, in the yeere of our Lord , 1583. even in our Citty of London; to destroy with fire from Heaven two Cittizens, the one leaving his Wife, the other her owne Husband, whiles they were in the very act of adultery on the Lords day; their bodies being left dead, and halfe burnt up, for a Spectacle of Gods avenging Iustice unto others . These are the sinnes ( but adultery and incest more especially ) which God himselfe hath commanded to be punished with death, yea with stoning to death ; the most vile and shamefulest death of all others: Yea these are such sinnes, that not onely the lewes in ancient times ; but even meere Pagans from the very light of nature, did punish with death it selfe. Hence Draco enacted; that the adulterer taken in adultery, might without any danger to the party, be lawfully killed The selfe-same Law was enacted by Solon and Plato. Hence Romulus, among those lawes which he wrote in brasse and placed in the Capitol, enacted; That the convicted adulteresse should be put to death according as her husband, or his friends should thinke meete. Which act was afterwards confirmed by the Iulian Law . Hence, among the Lacedemonians, it was lawfull for a man to kill him, who was taken in adultery with his wife . Hence the Corinthians used to drowne those who prostituted themselves to the lust of others. The Vestel Virgins among the Romans being convicted of fornication were buried alive. Iu ancient Times among the Turkes, the adulterer and adulteresse were both stoned to death: and at this day they are both most ignominiously punished. The Arabians, and Tenedians punish adultery with death, reputing it a farre greater crime, then periury, or sacriledge; and therefore worthy of a severer punishment. The Æ thiopians account adultery treason, and therefore they make it capitall. In Peru whoredome is punished with the death of both parties. The Brasilians prosecute adultery with capitall hatred in so much that he whose wife is taken in adultery may lawfully kill her, if he please. The Indian Bramanes may lawfully poyson their unchaste wives. In old Saxony, women who were convicted of adultery, and ravishers of maides were first hanged, and then burned. In Siam adultery is death, the Fathers of the Malefactors, or the next Kinsmen being the Executioners. In Palmaria adulterous Priests are punished with cruell death. In Hispaniola unchaste Priests are either drowned, or burnt. In Bantam, Mexico; and China adultery is punished with death. The Tartars taken in adultery are put to present death, for feare of which they live very chaste . If then the very judiciall Law of Moses , together with these Heathens and Pagan Nations have deemed these sinnes capitall: punishing adulterers and adulteresses with death, as being the publike enemies of mankinde : needs must these sinnes bee execrable, yea dangerous unto Christians. Twentiethly, these sinnes are prejudiciall both to the Church and State, in defileing, polluting, dishonouring, and troubling them with an uncleane, degenerated, spurious, if not accursed ofspring, who are no other but the very blemishes , shames, and infamy of Church, of State, of nature: which all Lawes disinherit: who were not to enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to their tenth generation . Lastly, these sinnes exclude men out of Heaven. none that die in the guilt of them shall ever inherite the Kingdome of God or of Christ : They cause God to iudge men in a more speciall manner: Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will iudge : They binde men over to the great Assises at the last day: The Lord knoweth how to reserve the uniust unto the day of iudgement to be punished: but cheefly them, that walke after the flesh in the lust of uncleanesse : And if all this bee not enough: they plunge mens soules deepe in Hell for all eternity . For the abominable, and Whore-mongers, and all uncleane persons shall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brimstone for ever; which is the second death. Even as Sodome and Gomorra, and the Citties about them, in like manner giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffring the vengeance of eternall fire , for these sinnes of theirs. O then consider this all yee incontinent, uncleane, adulterous persons who forget God ; who leave the pathes of uprightnesse, to walke in the wayes of darkenesse; lest he teare you in pieces; lest he eternally condemne you to the endlesse flames of Hell for these your flames of lust; and there be none to deliver you . Since then it is evident by all these premises to the hearts, the consciences of all men, that adultery, fornication, uncleanesse, are such abominable, capitall, deepe-dyed pernitious sinnes; those Stage-playes which instigate, or entise men to them, foment men in them, must needs bee execrably sinfull; yea utterly unlawfull unto Christians: so that my Major needs no further proofe. For the Minor; that Stage-playes are the immediate occasions, the fomentations of much actuall adultery, whoredome, and unclenesse; it is most apparantly evident: First, from their subject matter: which being for the most part amorous, scurrilous, or obscene, consisting of adulteries, rapes, incests, whoredomes, love-prankes, sollicitations to incontinency, meretricious ribaldrous songs and iests, (as I have already proved ;) must needs inflame mens lusts, and draw them on to actuall uncleanesse: Since evill words , which corrupt good manners, are but a way, a passage unto evill deeds ; a fire, a fewell to adulterous lusts: yea, the very Chariot of whoredome, of uncleanesse ; as the Fathers stile them. Hence is it, that Agrippa reputeth amorous Poets, lascivious Historians, the chiefest Panders in the world; yea the very originall Fathers, Tutors, and chiefe Promoters of baudery, and whoredome; because their ribaldrous Poems; their true, their fabulous Histories of the adulteries, loves, and beastly lewdnesses of Idol-gods, or lustfull men, are but as so many Lectures to instruct; so many allurements to entice; so many guides to lead, so many arguments to perswade men to lechery, and all actuall uncleanesse whatsoever . Hence all ancient, all moderne Expositors on the Commandements that ever I have seene, have reduced scurrility, ribaldry; together with all amorous lascivious Poems, speeches, iests, Histories, Bookes, and Stage-playes, to the 7\. Commandement, as being the fire, fewell, fomentations, occasions of whoredome and adultery . Yea hence is it, that God himselfe prohibits, all filthy communications, all corrupt speeches; all foolish talking and iesting, which are not convenient, together with the very naming of fornication and all uncleanesse; as unbecomming Saints; because they draw men on to these shamefull workes of darkenesse, with which Christian are to have no fellowship . If then obscene, adulterous Poems, fables, Histories, Ditties, iests, or speeches have such an attractive, such a depraving power in them to draw men on to actuall lewdnesse, much more must Stage-playes , (wherein the quintessence, the confluence of all obscenity is pithily contracted, emphaticaly expressed, elegantly adorned, rhetorically pronounced) be more prevalently powerfull to draw men on to these grosse lecherous sinnes. Whence Nilus an ancient Abbot, adviseth all such who would avoyd the wounds of lust, to abstaine from publike Stage-playes, and to keepe themselves from them, lest they should fall into their enemies hands, and be drawne on to actuall lewdnesse . Secondly, my Minors truth is most evident, from the very manner of acting Stage-playes, and those whoredomes, those adulteries personated in them. Hee who shall but seriously consider those amorous smiles, and wanton gestures; those lascivious complements, those lewde adulterous kisses and enbracements; those lustfull dalliances; those impudent, immodest, panderly passages; those effeminate, whorish, lust- inflaming sollicitations; those severall concurrences, combinations, conspirations, of artificiall, studied, and more then Brothel-house obscenities: those reall lively representations of the acts of venery , which attend and set out Stage-playes; must needs acknowledge; that they are the very Schooles of baudery; the Tutors, the occasions of reall whoredomes, incests, adulteries,  &c. whence they were at the first consecrated to Venus (the Goddesse of whoredome and adultery) the very Roman Theater being stiled , The Temple of Venvs , as Tertullian writes: in which whoredome and adultery were freely practised without controll. The 6\. Councell of Constantinople, Can. 100\. the Synode of Augusta, Anno 1548\. cap. 28\. together with Clemens Alexandrinus. Oratio Adhort. ad Gentes. fol. 8\. 9. Gregory Nyssen , in his Vit ae Moseos Enarratio. p. 503\. Theodoret, Contra Gr aecos Infideles. lib. 3\. De Angelis Deque Dijs, ac D aemonibus malis. Tom. 2\. pag. 362\. 363. Mapheus Vegius, De Liberorum Educatione. lib. 1\. cap . 15. with sundry moderne Divines in their Expositions on the 7\. Commandement; condemne all amorous wanton pictures, of Courtesans, and others , (which now are too to common) as incendiaries to mens unruly lusts, which draw them on to actuall lewdnesse . Certainely, if these livelesse pictures are so apt to ingenerate unchaste affections, or to pricke men on to whoredome and adultery : much more will these amorous actions, complements, kisses, and embracements; these lively pictures, these reall representations of adultery and uncleanesse in our Stage-playes, doe it. It is storied of Tiberius , (a monster of more then beastly obscenity,) that as he adorned his houses with lascivious pictures, the better to excite his lusts ; (a practice much in use with many incontinent persons now of late;) so he caused others to defile one another before his face ; ut adspectu deficientes libidines excitaret; that by this lewde beastly sight he might stirre up his owne decayed lusts . The like I finde recorded of Tamerlan the great Scythian Warrier . It is registred likewise of that man-monster, Heliogabalus; that he commanded Stage-players to commit those adulteries upon the Stage in truth, which they formerly personated but in shew ; to quicken up his lusts to whoredome. If then the very beholding of lewde adulterous acts, were the onely incentives these prodigious Whore-masters used to enrage their wearied, spent, allayed lusts; and to enable them to the actuall committing of these beastly sinnes; we cannot but from hence conclude; that the personating of incests, rapes, adulteries, whoredomes, and the like upon the Stage, set out with all the art that either bawdery, or lechery have as yet atchieved, should much more instigate if not precipitate men to the selfe-same wickednesses , to which their owne depraved natures are too prone. Thirdly, my Minors truth is fully evident, by the qualities of the Penners, the Actors, the Spectators of these Stage-playes; who have for the most part, beene notoriously unchaste in all ages: Such were the Play-poets, such the Actors, the Stage-haunters, in Ovids , Athen aeus , Tiberius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullians, Cyprians, Lactantius, Basils, Nazienzens, Hieroms, Augustines, Chrysostomes, Salvians, Isiodores, Damascens, Bernards, Aquinas, Fabricius, Petrarkes, Polydor Virgils, Agrippaes, Gualthers dayes, and other times, as their fore-quoted testimonies, with sundry others in the precedent Acts abundantly testifie. Such were they not long since among us, as Master Northbrooke , Gosson , BB. Babington , Master Stubs , with others of our owne domestique moderne Authors write; and such are they still. What our common Play-poets and Actors chastity and demeanor is; what modest mortified persons they are, is so well knowne to all who are acquainted with their persons or Playes, that I need not defile my paper to proclaime it. What the most of our assiduous Play-haunters are; how chaste their lives, their carriages are, their owne consciences can best informe themselves ; experience and publike fame best testifie unto others: Sure I am, there is little chastity or modesty in their cloathes and gestures, lesse in their speeches , least in their lives, if publike fame or common experience prove but true. It is too well knowne to divers Stage-customers; that the most notorious Panders, Bawdes, and Strumpets, (the bane of many a Yongsters body, soule, estate, credit:) the most branded Adulteresses, Adulterers, Whore-masters, Brothel-house-haunters, and the like, are the chiefest Admirers, Patrons, Spectators, Supporters of; the most beneficiall Customers and Contributors to our Stage-playes. It is storied of Heliogabalus, that when he erected a publike Stewes, he sent to the Cirques and Theaters (the common Marts or Receptacles in those dayes for whores) to stocke and furnish it . Certainely, if such a common Brothell or Nunnery of adulterous lecherous persons were now to bee erected, (which God forbid:) the best Storehouse to furnish it, were our Play-houses, where such lewde creatures harbour, and have most resort, as Iustinian, Chrysostome, Statius, Plantus ,  & Bulengerus witnesse. Since therefore Play-poets, Actors, Stage-haunters, are thus generally adulterous and unchaste; yea commonly more excessive in these sinnes then others : Since Adulterers, Whore-masters, Whores,  &c. are the greatest Patriots, applauders, frequenters, upholders of these lascivious Stage-playes; needs must they pamper and promote their filthy sinnes and lusts; if not ingender adultery , and lewdnesse in their hearts: since such creatures live not, delight not, but in elements, in pleasures like themselves; nor yet spread their nets, their baites, but in such filthy troubled streames, where they are alwayes sure for to catch their prey , which they seldome misse at Stage-playes; where many adulterous matches, many Panderly Whorish Brothel- house bargaines are concluded : the common rode from the Play-house, being either with an adulteresse to a Taverne; or with a Whore to a Bawdy-house; where many young Gallants, to Gods dishonour, and their Parents griefe; doe even spend their Patrimonies, wast their bodies, damne their soules, being farre more pretious then the world it seife. It was the use of ancient times among the Greekes and Romans, after their Playes were ended, for whores to prostitute themselves to the lusts of others, either on, or under the Theaters where their Playes were acted; the same place being both a Play-house, and a Stewes : whence both the Brothel-house and the word Fornication, derive their etimology and originall from the Play-house, where Whores were harboured and trained up at first, till they were confined to the Stewes . How farre this usage yet continues I cannot positively determine; yet this I have heard by good intelligence; that our common Strumpets and Adulteresses after our Stage-playes ended , are oft-times prostituted neere our Play- houses , if not in them: that our Theaters if they are not Bawdy-houses. (as they may easily be, since many Players, if reports be true, are common Panders ,) yet they are Cosin-germanes, at leastwise neighbours to them : Witnesse the Cock- pit , and Drury-lane: Black-friers Play-house , and Duke-humfries ; the Red-bull , and Turnball-street : the Globe , and Bank-side Brothel- houses , with others of this nature: Such is the vertue of our Playes, our Play-houses, not onely to instruct, and make, but likewise to draw Panders, Bawdes, whores, and whore-masters to them , supplying them both with custome and revenue , as lamentable experience too evidently informes us. Therefore we need not doubt my Minors truth. Fourthly, if there be any yet uncredulous of this verity, that memorable act of P. Sempronius Sophus, a worthy Roman; who gave his wife a Bill of Divorce, for no other cause at all, but that she frequented Stage-playes without his privity, the very sight of which might make her an adulteresse and cause her to defile his bed: which Divorce of his the whole Roman Senate did approve, (though it were the very first that hapned in the Roman State;) as being a meanes to keepe women chaste. Together with the Constitution of Iustinian , grounded upon this precedent example: That a man may lawfully put away his wife if she resort to Cirques, to Play-houses, or Stage-playes without his privity and consent, because she cannot be temperate or chaste at home, who desires to be incontinent, unchaste, and to take pleasure in Play-houses abroad : wil put this out of question. For if it be lawful for a man to put away his wife for resorting unto Stage-playes; because it is a ready way to make her an adulteresse, if not a probable Argument that she is such a one already, since she dares resort to such lewde suspitious places: (which I would those who have Play-haunting Wives or Daughters would consider:) then Stage-playes are doubtlesse an apparant cause of actual adultery, and such like filthy sinnes. But if any man bee yet unsatisfied with these evidences, let him reflect on all the severall Fathers, Councels, Authors in the former Scene, and withall cast his eyes upon some pregnat witnesses which I shall here produce; and then he cannot but subscribe unto it even with full consent. To passe by S. Cyprians testimony, who informes us; that many Virgins by frequenting Play- houses, did blast the flower of their virginity, make shipwracke of their chastity, and degenerate into common Strumpets, being Widdowes before they were wives, and Mothers before they had Husbands; whose miserable fals the Church did much lament . An experimentall evidence of this most knowne truth. My first witnesse to testifie these adulterous lewde effects of Stage-playes, is Saint Chrysostome , who is exceeding copious in this Theame: his words and elegant passages against Playes, (which being dismembred into fractions will lose much of their elegance, vigor, and perswasive power,) I shall here faithfully transcribe at large, as being very pertinent to this particular Scene  & purpose, though most pregnant against Stage-playes in the grosse, to which wee will here apply them likewise. In his 3. Homily of David and Saul ; the Title of which runs thus. That it is dangerous to goe to Stage-playes, and that it makes men compleat adulterers, &c. he writes thus of Stage- playes. I verily believe that many of those who left us yesterday, and departed to the Spectacles of iniquity, are this day present. I could wish I might apparantly know who they are, that so I might excommunicate them the Church; not that they should alwaies continue without, but that being chastised, they might returne againe. For as much as Fathers also oft-times turne their offending children out of doores, and remove them from their table, not that they might be alwayes exiled thence, but that being meliorated by this chastisement, they may returne againe into their Fathers house with due prayse. The same truely doe Pastors likewise whiles they seperate the scabbed sheepe from the whole, that being eased of their wretched disease, they may againe returne safely to the whole, rather then the sicke should fill the whole flocke with that their disease. For these reasons we did desire to know those men: but albeit we are not able to discrie them with our eyes, yet the Word, the Sonne of God will know them thorowly, and their consciences being checked, he will easily perswade them to returne willingly of their owne accord; teaching them that he onely is within the Church, who brings a minde worthy this exercise: as on the contrary, he who living corruptly is a partaker of this congregation, although he stand here in person, is yet cast out , and is more truely excluded, then those who are so shut out, that it is not lawfull for them to be partakers of the holy Table. For they being expelled according to Gods Lawes, and continuing without, are yet of good hope, if so be they will amend their faults. They are cast out by the Church, that they may returne againe with a pure conscience. But those who defile themselves, and being admonished not to enter in before they shall have purged away the spot contracted by their sinnes, are afterwards ashamed to repent, and so make the wound of their minde, both sharper and greater. For it is not so hainous a thing to offend, as after an offence to be ashamed of the remedy, and not to obey the Ministers who enioyne such things. But what so great wickednesse is there here committed, say they, that men should be driven from these holy limits? Yea what offence canst thou finde greater then this? when as they have manifestly defiled themselves with adultery, impudently, after the manner of mad Dogs, they rush in to this holy Table. If so be you desire to know the kinde of the adultery, I will not rehearse my owne words to you, but his who is to iudge of the whole life of man : that man saith he , who shall looke upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery in his heart. If then a woman met casually in the street, being but carelesly attyred, hath oft-times taken him who hath more curiously beheld her with the very aspect of her countenance: with what face can those, who not simply, nor casually, but purposely, (yea with so great affection and desire, that they likewise forsake the Church, and runne to the Play-house for this very end, and sit there an whole day together idle, having their eyes fixed on the faces of those noble women,) say, that they have not looked upon them to lust after them? where effeminate and lascivious words are likewise added; where there are whorish songs; where there are voyces vehemently exciting unto pleasure, where are painted eyes, where are coloured cheekes; where the attire of the whole body, is full of deceitfull dies and painting, besides many other garnished enticements to deceive and inescate the beholders: where is the idlenesse of the Spectators, very great confusion, with the exhortation to lasciuiousnesse, arising from thence, both from those who were present at the Playes, as also from those who afterward relate to others what things they have seene in Stage-playes. To these are added the allurements of Flutes and Pipes, and such like musicke inticing to deceit, effeminating the fortitude of the minde, preparing the mindes of those that sit there with delight for the traps of Harlots, and causing them to be more easily ensnared . For if here were there are Psalmes, where there is preaching of Gods Word, where there is the feare of God, and much reverence, concupiscence doth oft-times creepe in privily like a crafty theefe ; how can those who sit idle in the Play-house; who neither see, nor heare any goodnesse, whose eares and eyes are beset on every side, overcome this concupiscence? Againe, if they cannot overcome it, how can they ever be absolved from the crime of adultery? Then how can those who are not yet free from the sinne of adultery, come to these sacred Temples without repentance, and be partakers of this excellent Assembly? Wherefore I doe earnestly exhort and entreat them, that they would first cleanse themselves by confession, repentance, and all other remedies, from the sinne they have contracted from Stage-playes, and so they may heare Gods Word. Neither doe we here commit a small sinne, as any one may easily discerne by examples. For if a servant should put his servile apparell, that is fraught with filth and many lice, into a cabinet where his Masters rich, his golden robes and garments are layd up; I pray tell me, wouldest thou easily brooke such a contempt? But what if one should cast dung and dirt into a golden vessell in which pretious oyntments have beene alwayes usually kept; wouldest thou not cudgle him who committed this notorious villany ? And after all this shall we be so carefully sollicitious of our caskets, and vessels, of our clothes and unguents, and yet estimate our soules more base then any of these? Shall we there where the spirit is an oyntment powred out, cast in the Devils pomps? Shall we there lay up the fables of Satan, or songs that are full of whorish filthinesse ? Goe too, tell me with what minde can God indure this? Doubtlesse there is not so great a difference betweene oyntment and dirt, betweene the Masters and the Servants clothes, as there is betweene the grace of the Spirit, and this perverse action. Doest thou not feare, doest thou not tremble, whiles thou beholdest this holy Table where dreadfull mysteries are administred, with the selfesame eyes that thou diddest behold the bed on the Stage; where the detestable fables of adultery are acted? whiles with the same eares thou hearest an adulterer speaking obscenely, and a Prophet and an Apostle leading thee into the mysteries of the Scripture? whiles with the same heart thou receivest deadly poyson, and this holy and dreadfull Sacrament? Are not these Playes the subversion of life the corruption, the destruction of marriages, the cause of warres, of fightings, and brawles in houses? For when thou shalt returne home from these Stage-playes more dissolute, effeminate and wanton, being made an enemy of all chastity, the sight of thy wife will be lesse pleasing to thee, let her be what she will. For being inflamed with that concupiscence which thou hast drunke in at Stage-playes, and being taken with that new sight which hath besotted thee, thou despisest thy sober modest wife, who is contented with ordinary diet, and upbraidest her with innumerable reproches; not because thou findest any thing blame-worthy in her, but because thou blushest to confesse thy disease, because thou art ashamed to discover that wound, with which thou hast returned home maimed from Stage-playes: Thou framest other excuses, seeking uniust occasions of displeasure, loathing all those things that are to be done at home, gaping after that wicked and uncleane concupiscence from which thou hast received an wounde: and whiles thou carriest in thine eares a ringing sound of a voyce, and with these, the face, the motion, briefly all those images of whorish lust, thou beholdest nothing of that thou hast at home with pleasure. And what doe I speake of a wife or family, when as afterwards, thou wilt be lesse willing to visit the very Church it selfe, when as thou wilt beare a Sermon of chastity, and of modesty with irkesomnesse? Neither are these things which are now spoken to thee, for instruction, but for accusation; and they will bring thee by little and little to despaire; yea at last thou wilt suddenly sever thy selfe from the discipline administred for the publike good of all. Wherefore I intreat you all, that you would avoyd the wicked commemorations in Stage-playes your selves, and likewise draw backe others from them, who have beene led unto them. For what-ever is there done, is not delight or recreation, but destruction, but torment, but punishment. What good doth this temporary pleasure doe, whiles everlasting torment issues from it, and whiles being pricked night and day with concupiscence, thou art troublesome and hatefull unto all? Wherefore rouse up thy selfe, and consider what a one thou art made returning from the Church: againe, what a one thou art, comming from Stage-playes, and compare these dayes with those: if thou wilt doe thus, there will be no need of my speech. For it will be sufficient to have compared this day with that, to shew what great profit comes from the one side, and how great hurt from the other. These things I thought good to speake to your charity at this time, neither will I ever cease to speake. For so we shall both admonish those who are obnoxious to this [illeg.]; and we shall confirme those who are now whole: for this oration will be profitable to both; to the one that they may desist; to the other, that they may not fall into it . So in his first Homily upon the 50. Psalme , he is very punctuall to our purpose. David (writes he) as he was walking upon the top of his Palace after dinner, saw a woman washing her selfe, and the woman was very faire and beautifull to looke upon. He saw her, I say, and he is wounded in his eye, and receiveth a dart. Let curious persons heare this who contemplate the beauty of others. Let those heare this, who are possessed with the unruly delight or desire of Stage-playes. Who say: we doe in truth behold them; but without detriment. What heare I ? David is hurt? and art not thou hurt? He is wounded; and can I trust to thy strength? He who had so great a measure of the spirit received a dart; and doest thou deny that thou art pierced ? And yet he beheld not an harlot, but an honest, chaste woman; and that not in the Theater, but at home: but thou beholdest an harlot in the Play-house, where even the very place it selfe, makes the soule liable to punishment: neither doest thou onely see, but thou likewise hearest dishonest words, and meritricious obscene songs, and thy minde is wounded on every side: to wit, by the sight, with those things which thou seest; by the eare, with those things which thou hearest: by the smell, with those things which thou smellest. And when as there are so many precipices, so many corruptions, how can I believe thee to be free from the bitings of wild beasts? Art thou a stone? art thou iron? Thou art a man subject to the common frailty of nature. Doest thou behold the fire, and yet art not burned? Whether is this agreeable to reason? Put a candle into straw, and then dare thou to deny that the straw will be burnt. That verily which stubble is, even that is our nature . Let our Play-haunters then consider this, and give this godly Father an answer these his pithy interrogations. The like passage wee finde in this 17\. Homely upon the 5\. of Mathew : upon these words, If thy right eye offend thee plucke it out, &c. Let those (writes he) heare these words who so often hasten to the Theater, and doe there almost daily defile themselves with the filthinesse of adultery. For if the Law command even him who is bound unto thee by familiarity, if he scandalize thee, to be cut off and cast away; with what satisfaction now at last can they be defended, who by their conversation and stay at Play-houses, doe daily get the acquaintance of those lewde ones who were not formerly knowne to them; & also administer a thousand occasions of destruction to themselves . Againe, in his Homily upon the 118\. alias the 119\. Psalme. vers. 151\. 152. hee writes thus. Let none account his life vile, let none cleave fast to vanity. We cannot serve two Masters; he serves two masters, who goes to Church one day, and to Stage-playes another day. Such a one hath two coates; he is farre from that Coate which cannot be devided, far from the Wedding garment; because, that is a Wedding garment which hath no spot. For he who goes one day to the Church, another day to Playes, weares a defiled garment. Every Servant standing with a blemish at his Masters Table, is cast out, and chastised with stripes: keepe your garment pure as you received it in baptisme. Let no man defile it with his manners, let no man rend so beautifull a vestment with the wickednesse of his heart. You have received such a Garment in baptisme as the Angels had who attended the Lord in his Sepulcher, whose rayment was as white as snow; And you have received such a gift of grace; keepe that you have received. He that defiles this garment , let him wash it with teares, let him seperate himselfe from the wicked, let him confesse his sinnes to God, and having reformed his life, let him not returne as a Dog to his vomit. What fellowship hath light with darknesse, or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidell. You who are the Sonnes of the Church ought not to be depraved in the vanities of Stage-playes. The Church will not indure you stinke, she cannot be defiled with your entrance; she mournes and sighes to God because she seeth her Sonnes to be such. Tremble every day, left God wax angry, and so you perish from the right way. Acknowledge the very signes of his displeasure, because the Heaven is made Brasse, and the Earth Iron; The very Elements proclaime the wrath of God. O yee Sonnes of Men how long will you be slow of heart? why doe you love vanity in Stage-playes , and seek after leasing in Stage-players? Know ye that the Lord hath made admirable the soule of all such who depart not out of the Church. The soule is heard when she cryes unto God, whiles she departs not from God. Be not ye luke-warme lest ye be spued out of the heart of God. He himselfe hath spoken by his Prophet : Because thou art neither cold, nor hot, and I would thou wert either cold or hot; but because thou art neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth. We performe our duty who speake true things of the truth. You if you have entred into the Physicians house, that you might cure your wounds, lament your wounds. The medicines being layd on, let the corruptions be purged out; let health increase, that so the Church seeing your amendment, may reioyce of her Sonnes; because where sinne hath abounded, grace hath superabounded . In his Homily upon the 140\. Psalme ; (an excellent disswasive from ill company who keepe men from repentance, and harden them in their sinnes) he hath this passage. Many are captivated of fornication, and have kindled a fire of lust, whiles they have followed feasts, and Theaters, having much iniquity in them : A pregnant eyidence for our present purpose. In his first Homily on Esay 6.1. I saw also the Lord sitting upon a Throne high and lifted up,  &c. he descants thus of Play-haunters, and the fruits of Stage-playes, which I would our Players, and Play-frequenters would consider. There are among those here present, whom I thinke are not unknowne to your charity, who contemning God, and accounting the oracles of the Spirit as vulgar and prophane, utter confused word, and carry themselves no better then mad men, keeping a stir, and turning about with their whole body, demeaning themselves so, as misbeseemes a Spirituall man. O miserable and unhappy wretch! Thou oughtest to sing the Angelicall glorification or Hymne with trembling and reverence, and to confesse to the Creator with feare, and by this to crave pardon of thy sinnes. But thou (here comes the fruit of Stage-playes in,) bringest in hither the manners of Players and Dancers; whiles thus evidently throwest about thine hands, skippests about with thy feet, and whirlests about with thy whole body. And how comes it to passe that thou fearest, that thou tremblest not whiles thou darest doe thus, against such sacred oracles ? Doest not thou thinke that the Lord himselfe is here invisibly present, who measureth every ones motion, and takes an account of his conscience? Doest thou not thinke that, the Angels stand round about his dreadfull Table, and compasse it about with reverence ? But thou thinkest not of these things. and why? pray marke it: because those things which thou hast heard and seene at Stage-playes have clouded thy minde: and therefore those things which are done there, thou bringest in among the rites of the Church; therefore thou doest utter thy incomposed minde in insignificant clamors. How then wilt thou aske pardon for thy sinnes? how wilt thou receive the Lord into thy house, when as thou prayest to him so contemptuously? Thou sayest, God have mercy upon me; and yet thou declarest such manners as are contrary to mercy. Thou cryest, save me; and yet expressest such a gesture, as is a stranger to salvation. Why doest thou stretch out thine hands to pray, which are alwayes tossed up on high, which are wheeled up and downe unseemely, and make a confused noyse with their vehement clapping and beating? Are not these things verily, partly the practises of common Bawdes and Strumpets; partly the examples of those who cry out aloud in Play-houses? How then dost thou dare to mix the sports of Devils, with the Hymnes of Angels praysing God? Yea why dost thou not feare this speech which there thou utterest, saying ; Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce unto him with trembling. Is this to serve with feare, to be so loud and clamorous, that thou thy selfe knowest not what thou speakest with the confused bellowing of thy voyce? This verily savors of contempt, not of feare: of arrogancy, not of modesty: this is rather a part of such who are playing then confessing, &c. The Prophet saith , Rejoyce in the Lord all the earth; make a joyfull noyse unto God all yee lands. Neither doe we prohibit the voyce of prayse; but the voyce of absurdity, and confusion, the vaine and rash lifting up of the hands into the ayre, the tinckling of the feet, unseemely and effeminate songs, which are the proper sports of those who sit idle in Play-houses , From thence these pernicious ensamples are brought in among us; from thence arc irreligious and vulgar voyces, from thence the absurdity of the hands, contentious combates, disorderly manners . For nothing doth bring the oracles of God into so great contempt, as the admiration of those Stage-playes and Spectacles which are there proposed. Wherefore I have ost exhorted you, that not one of those who come hither, and enjoy the divine doctrine, and are likewise partakers of the dreadfull and mysticall Sacrament, should goe unto these Stage-playes, nor yet entermixt these divine mysteries with demoniacall. Notwithstanding some have growne so mad, that even then when they carry about a shew of Religion, and are growne very white with extreame old age, they runne to them notwithstanding, neither regarding our words, nor respecting their owne outward shew. But as oft as we inculcate this speech unto them, and exhort them to respect their old age and religion, how great then is their coldnesse? how ridiculous their speech? They say, that these things are an example of the victory and crownes which shall be in the world to come, and we reape much profit from thence. What sayest thou man? This is a rotten speech, and full of deceit. From whence canst thou reape any profit thence? From innumerable contentions? from the rash oathes of evill speakers? Or from the abuses, the revilings, the scoffes with which the Spectators besprincle one another? But from these there is no good reaped; therefore thou altogether reapest benefit from confused voyces, insignificant clamors, as well from him who is cast downe upon the arena, as from those who cast him downe, who offer violence, who are mad or foolish and dissemble before women. But here verily all the Prophets and teachers doe shew the very Lord of Angels upon an high and elevated Throne, and distribute to those who are worthy, rewards and crownes, but to the unworthy they assigne Hell: and even the Lord himselfe doth ratifie this. Besides thou doest verily contemne these things, in which there is likewise terror of conscience, redargution of thy deeds, feare of punishments and accusations, and inevitable torments. But yet that thou maist finde a certaine excuse of thy Stage-playes on which thou earnestly gazest, thou sayest, thou reapest profit from them by whom thou sufferest irrecoverable losse. I intreate, and beseech againe and againe, that we excuse not our excuses in sinnes: for these are but pretences and deceites by which we procure damage to our selves . In his 6. Homily upon Mathew , he writes thus of laughter and Stage-playes. If thou therefore power out such teares thou becommest a follower of thy Lord: for he wept when he raysed up Lazarus, and when he looked backe upon Hierusalem that was to be sacked. He was likewise troubled with the treason and destruction of Iudas. So verily thou maist oft-times finde him weeping, but never laughing, no nor yet so much as slightly rejoycing with a smile. Truely no Evangelist hath made mention of any such thing. That Paul likewise wept night and day for 3\. yeeres together, both others testifie of him, and he likewise of himselfe: but that he ever laughed, neither doth he himselfe shew any where nor any other for him. Yea not one of all the Saints hath ever signified any such thing either of himselfe or of any other. We read of none but Sarah onely in the Scripture that laughed, (yea she is presently reproved by the voyce of God) and of the Sonne of Noah: but for that laughter, of a Free-man he was made a slave. And this I speake not to take away laughter altogether, but that I might quite extinguish all dissolutenesse of life. Our Christ therefore speakes many things to us concerning mourning , both by blessing those that mourne, and by pronouncing those miserable that laugh. For we doe not come into a Play-house, that is, where laughter may be moved; neither doe we therefore oft-times meet together, that we should recreate our selves, with undecent cachinnations; but rather that we might mourne, and by it inherit a Kingdome to come. For thou verily if thou standest but in the presence of an earthly King, wilt not dare so much as to smile. But yet when thou hast the Lord of Angels himselfe present every where, thou standest not before him with trembling and greatest reverence; but even when he is angry thou laughest, neither dost thou consider, that by this thou dost more offend him, then thou didest displease him with thy sinne. Neither doth God so much detest sinners, as those who are secure after their sinnes committed. And yet there are some so utterly insensible, and iron-like, that after all these words they will say: verily I would to God that I might never chance to weepe, but God grant me, that I may rather alwayes play and be merry. What, I pray, can be found more childish then such a minde? For God never taught or granted men to play; but the Devill. Heare therefore what Players have heretofore suffered. The people, saith he, sate downe to eate and drinke, and rose up to play. Such were there heretofore in Sodom: such likewise were there at the time of the Flood: for the Lord saith of them , That they abounded with pride, with fulnesse of bread, and with riches. Those likewise in the time of Noe, When they saw the Arke building for so many yeeres together, did shun all the dolor of compunction, and did onely civilly serve their flattering mirth, being nothing carefull of things to come; and therefore the sudden punishment of the Flood did drowne them all, and there was made a common shipwracke of the whole world. Wherefore crave not thou that from God which thou receivest from the Devill. For it is Gods use to give an humbled, trembling, broken, chaste, penitent, and wounded soule. These verily are the guifts of God, because we likewise stand most in need of such. For a great combate hangs over our heads: and we must fight against invisible powers, against spirituall wickednesses; and against such like Principalities, and Powers; and it is well with us if giving all diligence, and watching with all, we may be able to endure their fierce assaults. But if we laugh and play, fostering with all perpetuall idlenesse, we shall be most easily overcome of our owne idlenesse also, even before the fight. Wherefore it is not our parts to laugh continually to let our selves loose to cachinnations and derisions, to effeminate our selves with delight, but rather of those men and women Actors who are beheld in Play-houses, who are defiled in Brothel-houses; of Parasites and flatterers who are made for this very purpose. This is not, I say, the part of those, who are called to an eternall Kingdome, and are likewise registred in that celestial Kingdome; this is not the part of those who carry spirituall armor, which verily is proper onely to the Soldiers of the Devill : For he it is who hath digested iests and playes into an art, that by these he might draw the Soldiers of Christ unto himselfe, and might weaken the nerves of their vertue. Wherefore he hath likewise erected Theaters in Citties, and hath prepared these incentives of laughter and filthy pleasure: and by their pestilence, he rayseth up the like plague upon the whole Citty. Which things S . Paul commands us to flie, exhorting , that we should put farre from us all foolish speaking  & surrility; then which laughter is far more pernicious, and farre worse. For when those Stage-players and ridiculous persons, have uttered any blasphemous and filthy thing, then especially all the simpler sort are most excessive in their laughter; applauding them most in that, for which verily they ought to have cast stones at them, who kindle a furnace of dreadfull fire upon their owne heads by this kinde of pleasure . For those who applaud the utterers of these things, perswade them for to act them; and therefore for this they deserve rather to undergoe the punishment which is appointed for these things. For if there were no spectator, nor maintainer of such things, there would certainely be none who would care to act them. But when they see you to forsake your owne callings, yea the very places of your daily worke, and the gaine you reape from thence, and all things else, for love of this vaine spectacle, they are then carried to these things with a more earnest intention, and bestow more study in them. And this I speake, not to excuse their fault, but that you may learne, that you especially are the spring and head of this iniquity, who spend the whole day in such ridiculous, in such pernicious pleasures. proclaiming abrode the honest name of Wedlocke, and the reverend businesse in it. For he who personates these things doth not sinne so much as thou who commandest them to be done. Neither dost thou onely command and call for, but thou dost likewise further the things that are acted, by the exultation, laughter, applause; and by all manner of meanes thou maintainest this Diabolicall Shop. With what eyes then canst thou now behold thy wife, which thou hast there seene prostrated to so great injury in the person of another? How canst thou refraine from blushing, as oft as thou remembrest thy wife, when thou shalt there see the same sex so filthily made common? Neither maist thou reply unto me now, that whatsoever is there done is but a section or fained argument, but not the truth of things . For this very setting (which comes home to our purpose) hath made very many adulterers, and overthroweth many houses. And therefore it grieves me most, that this so great an evill, is not believed to be an evill; but that which is farre the worst of all, both favour, and clamor, and applause, and laughter are expressed, when so beastly adultery is committed to the publike hurt. What then sayest thou, is this onely feining, not a crime? Well therefore are these worthy of a thousand deaths, because what all lawes command men to shun, those things are these not afraid to imitate. For if adultery it selfe be evill, doubtlesse the imitation of it must be evill. And I doe not yet report how many and great adulterers they may make who personate such adulteries in an histrionicall fiction, and how impudent likewise they make their spectators. For there is nothing more filthy, nothing more lascivious then that eye, that can patiently, that I say not willingly, behold such things. Moreover what a thing is this, that when as thou wilt not so much as looke upon a naked woman in the street, yea nor yet at home, but if such a thing fall out by accident thou thinkest it done to injure thee; that yet when as thou goest up to the Play-house, that thou maist violate the chastity of both Sexes, and maist likewise incestuously defile thine owne eyes, thou believest that no dishonest thing befalls thee? For thou canst not say thus, that she is an harlot that is thus uncovered; because it is nature it selfe, and there is the same body of an whore, and of a free woman. For if thou thinkest that there is no obscenity in such a sight, for what cause when as thou shalt see the same thing in the street, doest thou step backe againe from thy intended walke, and most severely rebuke that immodesty? unlesse perchance thou believest, the same thing not to be alike filthy when we are severed, and when we sit all together. But this is meerely derision and shame, and words altogether of extreme folly; and it is better for one to besmeare his whole face with clay and dirt, then with a spectacle of so great filthinesse. For dirt is not so noxious to the eyes, as that unchaste spectacle, and the sight of a naked Harlot. Heare therefore what nakednesse brought upon mankinde even from the beginning, and even by this meanes feare that filthinesse. What then hath made men naked ? disobedience and the counsell of the Devill, so much hath this alwayes pleased him from the beginning. But they verily when they were naked, were yet ashamed; you repute the same thing worthy prayse, according to that of the Apostle , glorying in your shame. After what manner therefore can thy wife from henceforth behold thee returning from such a contumely? how can she entertaine or speake to one so unworthily defiling the condition and sex of womans nature; yea and returning a captive, a servant of an whorish woman from such a spectacle. If then you grieve when you heare these things, I confesse that I give you, and owe you the greatest thankes. For who is he that doth comfort me, but he who is made sorrowfull by me? Wherefor cease not to mourne for this licentiousnesse, and oft to be grieved for it. For this griefe will be made unto you a beginning of conversion unto better things. Wherefore I have more earnestly pressed my speech, that I might free you by a more deepe incision from their corruption by whom you are intoxicated, and might revoke you to pure holinesse of minde: which verily, together with the promised rewards of piety, we may all happen to enjoy by the grace and mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ; to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost be glory for ever and ever , Amen. In his 7. Homely upon Mathew ; he proceeds thus against Playes, and Play-haunters. But what doe I speake of the space of the long journey of the wise men to see Christ, when as many women are now growne to such an height of effeminacy of minde, that they cannot so much as come a very little distance from their houses to see the Lord in a spirituall manger, unlesse they be carried upon Mules? But of those also who verily can indure the paine of walking, some preferre the tumult of worldly businesse, others Theatricall routs, or Play- house meetings, before holy Assemblies. Verily these Barbarians before they had seene Christ, overcame so great a iourney for him; thou verily, no not after thou hast seene him, dost like to imitate him. For even when thou hast seene him, thou so relinquishest him, that after him thou runnest to Play- houses, and dost rather desire both to heare and to see a Stage-player, then him: And that I may touch the same things againe that I followed before, thou verily leavest Christ placed in a Spirituall Manger, but thou hastest to see a Strumpet lying on the stage. But of what punishments now at last doe we thinke this worthy? Answer I beseech you; if any one should promise he would bring thee unto the King, and would shew thee him glittering on every side, and sitting amidest the severall ornaments of his pompe and state; dost thou thinke thou shouldest prefer a Stage-play, before this courtly dignity, though thou expecteast no benefit to accrue unto thee by it? Verily out of this Table there flowes a fountaine of spirituall good things, and this thou presently leaving, runnest to the Theater, that thou maist see a swimming woman, and thou beholdest that sex exposed to the publike view: I say, that thou maist see this, thou leavest Christ sitting by the fountaine of heavenly gifts. For even now he sits not onely upon that one Samaritan Well, but speaketh to the whole Citty. But perchance even now he speakes onely to the Samaritan woman: for even now no man stands by him; save onely that some perchance are present onely with their bodies, but others truely not so much as with their bodies. Notwithstanding he departs not, but staies, and demandeth drinke of us, not water, but holinesse for Christ destributeth holy things to holy men. For he doth not give us water out of this Well, but living blood, which albeit it be received to testifie the Lords death, yet to us it is made a cause of life. But thou leavest the fountaine of his blood, and this dreadfull cup, and runnest hastily to that diabolicall well that thou maist behold a swimming whore, and suffer a shipwracke of thy soule. For that water is a certaine vast sea of luxury, in which bodies are not drowned, but soules suffer shipwracke. For she verily being naked sports her selfe with swimming in the midest of the waters, but thou looking on her from an high scaffold art plunged into the depths of lust. For these nets of the Devill, doe not so much catch those who descend into that water, and there roll themselves, as those who sit above. For these are drowned farre more cruelly, then that Pharaoh heretofore who was overwhelmed with his Chariots & Horsemen. Now if were possible by any meanes for me to shew unto you the soules swimming upon these waters, truely they would appeare no otherwise, then those Ægyptian bodies that were tossed in those floods. But this verily is far more dangerous, that this so great destruction they call pleasure, and this filthy sea of perdition, they stile the Euripus of delight; when as verily one may more easily and safely passe over the Ægean, and Tyrrhenian sea, then the horrible dangers of this spectacle. For first of all the Devill doth sollicite the hearts of such all night long with an over-anxious expectation, afterwards he represents that which hath beene so greedily beheld, where with he doth presently binde and lead them captive. Neither mayest thou thinke thy selfe free from sinnes, if thou doest not couple with an harlot, when as thou dost commit all this with thy will. For if thou art possessed by this concupiscence, thou art verily burned with a greater flame . But if by beholding these things thou suffrest nothing, notwithstanding, thou art guilty, in being a scandall unto others; and by thy encouragement of such pleasures thou thy selfe confoundest both thine owne face, and with thy face thy soule. But that we may not seeme to deale onely by way of reproofe, we will now propound the meanes of reformation. What then is this meanes of amendment? I deliver you to your owne wives to be instructed, when certainely you ought rather according to the Apostle , to be instructors of your wives. But because by sinne the order is inverted, and the body is made the superior, the head the inferior, let it not grieve you to returne to honest things by this way. But if thou art ashamed of the tutorship of a woman; avoyd sinne, and thou maist quickly ascend into the chaire of a Doctor, which is ordained for thee by God. But as long as thou shalt sinne, the Scripture doth send thee not onely to an woman, but even to irrationall and the basest creatures. Neither doth a creature endued with the honor of reason blush to become a Scholler of the Bee and the Ant: neither is this the fault of the Scripture but of those who have lost their owne noblenesse. Therefore we also will have a care to doe thus. And now verily we assigne thee to a woman to be taught: but if thou shalt contemne her admonitions, we will even send thee to the tutorship of unreasonable creatures. For we will shew thee, how many birds and fishes, yea how many kindes of beasts and creeping things outstrip thee in honesty and chastity. But if thou art ashamed to be compared to such creatures, returne to the ensigne of thy owne noblenesse, and remembring that vast Sea of Hell, and fiery River, avoyd this pestiferous Fish-pond of the Play-house. For this is it which doth drowne its Spectators in that fiery Sea, and which doth kindle the very bottome of that fire. For if he who without these provocations seeth a woman, is yet notwithstanding drawne sometimes to lust after her, and commits adultery onely by lusting; he who not onely seeth, but likewise earnestly beholds a naked and lascivious women with his whole minde, how is he not a thousand times made the captive of lust? That great Flood under Noah did not so extinguish mankinde, as these swimmers doe altogether suffocate all their spectators even with much disgrace. For that flood although it brought in the death of bodies, yet it blotted out the vices of soules, but this water doth the contrary; it workes the destruction of soules, the bodies still continuing in life : You verily if that any contention about honor ariseth, contend with all ambition, that you ought to have preheminence of the whole world; flattering your selves with this priviledge ; that this Citty did first give the name of Christians to the faithfull: but when you should contend about honesty and chastity, are you not ashamed lest you should be overcome of the very basest villages? Yes, sayest thou. But what then doe you command us to doe? To goe into desert Mountaines, and to become Monkes? And what else doe I lament, but that thou thinkest an honest and pure life belongs onely to them? Verily Christ hath given common precepts unto all men. For where he saith , if any man looke upon a woman to lust after her, hee hath already committed adultery with her in his heart: it is not onely spoken to a Monke, but likewise to an Husband. For that Mountaine in which Christ taught these things was then filled almost only with such. Consider therefore that Theater, and avoyd their Diabolicall Assemblies, and doe not as it were blame my more troublesome speech. For I prohibit not marriages, nor honest pleasure; but I would have it to be done with honesty, not with obscenity or sinne. I doe not therefore bid the goe into Mountaines and Deserts, but to be bountifull, and likewise honest and modest, even whiles thou livest in the midest of the City. The Apostle tells us , The time is short, it remaines therefore that those who have wives bee as if they had none; for the fashion of this world passeth away. As if he should say, I bid you not to dwell in the tops of Mountaines, although I desire that likewise, because Citties imitate the abominations committed in Sodom; but yet I doe by no meanes force you to it. Continue having an house, wife, children, onely doe not make them Spectators of incestuous pleasures, doe not thou introduce the plague of the Theater into thine house. Doest thou not heare Paul saying ;The man hath not the power of his body but the woman? Therefore he hath also given common precepts to him. Thou verily if thy wife frequent the Church becommest a most grievous accuser of her: but thou thy selfe spending the whole day in Play-houses dost not believe thy selfe to be worthy of accusation: but when as thou art so vigilant over thy wives chasty, that thou art not ashamed to be excessive and immoderate, keeping her oft-times from necessary iourneyes, yet thou thinkest that all things are very lawfull to thy selfe. But Paul doth not permit this to thee, who likewise giveth the same power to the woman. Let the man, saith he , give unto the wife due benevolence. How then is thy wife honored by thee who is vexed with such an undeserved iniury, when as thou doest ioyne thy body which is in her power, to harlots? For thy body is thy wives. What honor I say dost thou give unto her, when as thou bringest in tumults and contentions into thine owne house, when as thou utterst such things in the market place, that whiles thou relatest them at home, thou disgracest thy wife that heares, and makest thy daughter that is present to blush, and besides others thy owne selfe? For it were much better to keepe silence, then to utter such obscene things, which if thy servants should but speake of, it were iust for thee to cudgle them. Answer I pray, what satisfaction canst thou give, who beholdest these things with great delight which are not lawfull to be named? And preferrest those things which are dishonest for to name before all honest and holy Arts ? Lest therefore I should seeme more troublesome, I will here end my speech: But if you persevere in these things, I will launch with a sharper rasor, and make a more deep incision; neither wil I ever rest untill I breake in pieces that Diabolicall Theater, that the Assembly of the Chuch may be made cleane and pure: So shall we be freed from the present turpitude, and acquire life to come by the grace and mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ; to whom be glory and dominion with the Father and the holy Ghost for ever and ever. Amen . In his 38. Homily upon Mathew , upon these words; It shall be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Iudgement then for thee : hee falls into this excllent discourse against Stage-playes and their concomitances. The Sodomites though they lived most wickedly, yet they sinned before the Law and Grace: but what pardon are we worthy of, who commit such sinnes after so diligent a care both of the Law and Grace? We shut our gates, and stop our eares to the poore; what say I to the poore, when as we doe the same to the Apostles themselves? Yea therefore to the poore, because we doe it to the Apostles. For when as Paul is read publikely and thou dost not regard: when as Iohn thunders and thou dost not heare; wilt thou heare a poore man who dost not heare an Apostle? That our houses therefore may be open to the poore, and our eares to the Apostles, all filthinesse is to be purged out of the eares of the minde. For as filth and dirt are wont to stop the eares of the body; so whorish songs, the fables of this world, the burthen of Debtors, the accounts of Creditors and usury, are wont to stop the eares of the minde more then any filth. Or rather, they doe not onely stop them, but also make them impure and filthy, For such speeches doe as it were cast dirt into our eares. That which that Barbarian did threaten, saying ; You shall eate your owne dung; even that doe many now unto you, not in word onely, but in deed; yea verily even far worse and filthier: (For whorish songs are much more abominable then dung.) And that which is worse to be indured, you doe not onely not grieve when as you heare such things, but you likewise laugh and reioyce. And when as you ought to avoyd and abominate these things, you entertaine and applaud them. Therefore if these things be not abominable, doe thou thy selfe likewise descend upon the Stage, and imitate that thou praysest, have society and commerce with those who move such laughter: but if thou wilt not be coupled in that fellowship, why dost thou give so great honor to it? The very lawes of the Gentiles make them to be infamous: but thou together with the whole citty being all called together, runnest out to them as to Ambassadors, or Generals of the Warre; that thou together with all the rest maist put dung into thine eares: and thou who beatest thy servant, if he utter any filthy thing in thy presence, who permittest not thy Sonne to doe it; who dost not suffer these things to be done at thine owne house as being an undoubted filthinesse; when as certaine servile abiect persons who deserve the Whipping-post shall call thee to heare these things, dost not onely not take it ill, but even reioycest, yea applaudest, and givest thankes. And what madnesse could ever be found greater then this? But sayest thou, I never spake nor sung these obscene things, these incentives of pleasure. But what profit is it, if when thou dost not utter them, yet thou hearest them willingly? Yea how wilt thou make this evident that thou dost not utter them, when as thou dost willingly heare them with laughter, and runnest to receive them? Tell me I pray thee, when as thou hearest Blasphemers, dost thou reioyce and triumph, or rather, dost thou tremble and stop thine eares? I doubt not but thou tremblest; Wherefore? because thou never art wont to blaspeme. Wherefore doe so likewise in filthy speech, if thou wilt thorowly perswade us, that thou dost not utter filthy words, then truely will we believe thee when as we shall see thee not to heare them. For how dost thou respect vertue, who are nourished by hearing these things? how canst thou undergoe the difficult labours of chastity, who aboundest with laughter, and art insnared with a whorish song: For if the soule which is farre remote from these songs, doth scarce retaine the honesty of chastity, how can he live chastly who liveth in them? Are you ignorant that we are more prone to vices? When therefore we run unto these things with hast and earnestnesse, how shall we avoyd the furnace of eternall fire? Have you not heard Paul saying : Rejoyce in the Lord. He hath said , in the Lord, not in the Devill. How therefore canst thou heare Paul, when thou shalt perceive that thou hast sinned, when as thou art alwayes as it were made drunke with these ridiculous Spectacles? For that thou camest hither now, I wonder not; yea verily I wonder greatly. For thou camest hither as it were simply and perfunctorily: but thou rushest thither daily with all earnestnesse of minde, with speed, with alacrity: which appeares by this; because that most filthy sinne, which by your sight and hearing hath beene infused into your soule, you carry along with you from the Theaters to your houses; yea verily you take it, and lay it up in your mindes and thoughts: and those things which are not worthy detestation thou disdainest, but abominable things thou admirest and lovest. For many returning from the office of burying, have presently gone into the bath; but those who come from Play-houses have neither mourned, nor powred out fountaines of teares. Yet truely a carcase hath no uncleanesse; but sinne doth so defile men, that no fountaines, no rivers, but onely teares and confession can wash it away. But there is no man who discernss how great the steines of sinne are. For because we feare not things that are to be feared, therefore we feare those things which have no cause of feare in them. But what is this so great noyse of Theater men? What these Diabolicall clamors? What this Satanicall apparell? One being a yong man hath his haire combed backward, and effeminating nature in his countenance, apparell, pace, and such like, strives to deduce it to the similitude of a tender Virgin. Another on the other side being an old man, having his haire and all modesty shaven off with a rasor, standing by girt, is ready to speake and to act all things. Women also with a naked and uncovered head speake to the people without shame, and usurpe impudency to themselves with so great premeditation, and infuse so great lasciviousnesse into the mindes of the Hearers and Spectators, that all may seeme even with one consent to extirpate all modesty out of their mindes, to disgrace the female nature, and to satiate their lusts with pernicious pleasure. For all things that are done there are absolutely most obscene, the words, the apparell, the tonsure, the pace, the speeches, the songs, the ditties, the turnings and glances of the eyes, the pipes, the flutes, and the very argument of the Playes, all things (I say) are full of filthy wantonnesse. Say therefore, when wilt thou withdraw thy selfe from so great an uncleane desire of fornication which the Devill hath infused into thee, and repent. For we are not ignorant how many whoredomes are there committed, how many marriages are there defiled with adulteries; how many men are there most unnaturally abused; how many yong men are there strangely effeminated; all things there are full of the highest iniquity, all full of prodigies, all full of impudency. For which things we ought not to sit laughing excessively, but rather to mourne and grieve even with teares. What therefore will you, maist thou say; shall we shut up all the Play-house doores, and obeying thee, overturne all things ? What hast thou said, shall we overturne? Are not all things now overturned? For whence dost thou believe that the unchaste attempters of marriages proceed? Come they not from these Play-houses? Whence are those who invade the marriage beds of others? Are they not from the Stage? Is it not from hence that many men become most troublesome to their wives, and that women are despised of their husbands? Are not very many adulterers from hence? Therefore he seemes to me to overturne all things who runnes to Play- houses, who brings in a most cruell tyranny? Thou wilt say, no; to separate wives from . their husbands, to ravish children, to overturne houses: all these are the acts of Tyrants who have seised upon the Castle, and oppresse the Citty by force: but the things we doe are approved by the lawes, and these Stage-playes have never given occasion to adulteries. Yea verily, who is not already made an adulterer? For if I could call all by name I would quickly shew it thee. How many have harlots led away as captives from thence? How many have they either withdrawne from their wives, or have not at all permitted them to come to their lawfull bed? What therefore, sayest thou, shall we overturne all the lawes by which these things are established. . Yea verily, these stage-playes being overturned, you shall overthrow, not the lawes, but iniquity, and you shall quite extinguish all the plagues and mischiefes of the Citty. For from hence are seditions raysed, from hence tumults doe arise. For those who are nourished with these Playes, (who sell their voyces for their bellies sake, who are most ready to speake, to doe all things, and spend all their paines and industry in this,) these are most of all wont to inflame the people with rumors, and to rayse tumults in Citties. For the idle youth educated in these evils, is more cruell then the very fiercest beast. Are not many evill doers made and confirmed by these Stage-playes? For that they may instigate all the people to these things, that they may obtaine their dancing pleasures, that they may corrupt modest women mixed with strumpets, they come to such a height of wickednesse, that they doe not so much as absteine from the bones of dead men. What shall I say, that many spend infinite summes of mony at these Diabolicall societies? What shall I say of lasciviousnesse? What of other evils ? Consider then that thou art he who dost overthrow the whole life of man, when as thou drawest others to these things; not I, who thinke, that all these Playes are to be given over. Thou wilt say; shall we then pull downe all the Play-houses? Would to God they were now pulled downe, albeit, that as farre as it appertaines to us, they long since lie desolate. Notwithstanding I command you to doe none of these things; since the magnificence of the houses may stand, and the Playes and Dancing altogether cease; which will be more prayse to you then if you should quite overturne all Take at least an example to your selves from the Barbarians, who want the filthinesse of all these stage-playes. What excuse then can you bring for your selves, if you who are now registred in Heaven, you who are the companions and coheires of Angels and Arch-Angels, should be found farre worse then the Barbarians in this thing? especially when as thou mait else where procure to thy selfe many better comfort. For when thou wilt refresh thy minde, thou maist goe into Gardens, behold running Rivers, contemplate great Lakes, looke upon pleasant Places, heare singing Grashoppers, be conversant in the Temples of Martyrs; from whence thou shalt receive best health for thy body, and excellent profit may accrue unto thy soule, from whence thou maist reape singular pleasure, because no losse, no griefe, no sorrow followes; thou hast a wife, thou dost not want children, thou aboundest in friends, all which are wont sometimes to afford honest delight and profit. For what is more sweet then children? What more pleasant then a chaste wife to a moderate and chaste Husband? Verily the Barbarians themselves, when as they had heard of these Stage-playes, and the unseasonable delight of fables, are reported to have uttered words most worthy all the instructions of Philosophie. For they said, that the Romanes, as if they had wanted wives and children, had devised such pleasures as these to themselves. In which words they did shew, that nothing could be more sweet, more pleasant to him who would live honestly, then a modest wife and children? But thou wilt say, I can shew that these Playes have done no hurt to many. Yes verily they doe very great hurt in that thou spendest thy time idlely and to no purpose, and in that thou offerest a scandall unto others. For although thou by a certaine fortitude of a sublime minde hast contracted no evill from thence, yet because thou hast made others who are weaker studious of Stage playes by thy example, how hast thou not contracted evill to thy selfe, who hast given occasion to others of committing evill? For those who are there corrupted, as well men as women, will all transferre the crimes and cause of their corruption upon thy head. For like as if there had not beene spectators, there had not beene any to have acted; so because both are the cause of the sinnes that are committed, they shall both suffer the fire. Wherefore all be it by the modesty of thy minde thou hast effected, that no hurt should come unto thee thence , Which I doe not thinke can be: yet because others have committed many sinnes by reason of Playes, thou shalt undergoe grievous punishments for this; albeit thou hadst beene much more modest and temperate, if by no meanes thou hadst gone thither. Let us not therefore contend unprofitably, nor devise vaine excuses, when as one excuse may suffice us, to flie far from this Babilonish Stewes, to keep far off from this Ægyptian Harlot, and if need be, to escape naked out of her hands: so shall we receive great pleasure, when as we are not at all pricked with the stings of conscience. So shall we both live soberly in this life, and obtaine future good things, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ . In his 74. Homily on Mathew , hee hath this notable passage to our purpose. Many come into the Church to behold more curiously the beauty of women, and the fairnesse of yong men : dost thou not therefore wonder that Thunderbolts are not sent forth on every side, and that all things are not utterly subverted? For these things are most worthy, not onely of Thunderbolts, but also of the punishment of Hell. But God since he is long- suffring and mercifull, doth in the meane time keepe in his anger that he may leade thee to repentance. What dost thou O man, thou more diligently seekest after the beauty of women in the Church, and doest thou not tremble abusing the Temple of God with so great an indignity? For in the market place thou blushest, yea thou fearest lest any one should see thee following a woman: but in the Church of God, when as God himselfe speakes unto thee, and deters thee from these things, thou most of all practisest fornication and adultery in that very time, when as it is thundred out unto thee with a loud voyce, that thou shouldest flie from these things, neither dost thou tremble, nor stand amazed. But these things thou hast learned (I pray observe it well) from the most unchaste Theater; that most contagious plague , (so stiles he the play-house) that pestiferous poyson, that unevitable snare of idle careles persons, that voluptuous perdition of incontinent people, hath taught you these things . Such is the accursed fruit of Stage-playes, not only to make the Play-house, but even the very Church of God a kinde of Brothell, as he there more largely proves. In his 69 Homily upon Mathew : I finde this notable discourse. When you are in feare and troubles you call those ex animo happy, who live a single life in Mountaines and Caves; as I am not ignorant that those have so stiled these sometimes, who living in idlenesse spend both day and night in Theaters and Play-houses. For albeit those may seeme to abound with a thousand pleasures, albeit rivers of pleasure might be thought to be present with them, yet they lie for the most part pierced thorow with many most bitter darts from thence. For if any man shall be taken with the love of any Woman-dancer, verily he shall undergoe a torment harder then any Warfare, more troublesome then any Pilgrimage, and he shall passe thorow more miserable dayes then any besieged Citty, &c . Where now are those who sit daily in the Play-house addicted to the Dances of the Devill, and to pernicious Songs? Verily I am altogether ashamed to speake of them, but yet I must needs doe it by reason of your infirmity. For even Paul himselfe saith , As you have heretofore given up your members to serve uncleanesse, even so now give up your members as servants of righteousnesse unto holinesse. Wherefore we will now also make diligent search into the lives of Harlots & corrupt yong Men who sit together in the Play-house, and we will compare them with the life of these blessed ones, as farre as it concernes a pleasant life. For the more negligent yong Men, that they may live merrily, are taken with the snares of the Play-house: yet if we consider well, we shall finde as great a difference betweene the one and the other, as if a man should heare Angels singing an heavenly Song, and Swine buried in the dirt, grunting. For in their mouth, Christ, but in these mens mouthes, the Devill speaketh. The Pipes with puffed up cheekes and a deformed face send forth an uncertaine and unarticulate voyce to these: but by their mouthes the Grace of the Holy Spirit, in stead of a Pipe, a Harpe, and a Flute, soundeth so sweetly, that it is impossible for those who are fastned to clay and earthly things, to set so great pleasure before their eyes. Wherefore I wish that some one of those who are mad about these things, could be but brought to this Quire of Saints, and then I needed not to use any more words. And although we relate these things to earthly men, yet we will somewhat endevor to pull them out of the filth and dregs. From these songs of Harlots a very flame of lust doth presently set the Auditors on fire, and as if the sight and face of a woman were not sufficient to inflame the minde, they have found out the plague of the voyce too. But by the singing of our holy men, if any such disease doth vex the minde, it is presently extinguished. And not onely the voyce and face of a woman, but the apparell doth much more trouble the Spectators; so that if any more rude or abiect poore man beholds it, he may be too much grieved at it and oft-times say thus unto himselfe, Verily a Whore and a Whore-master, the children of Cookes and Taylors, and oft-times of Servants, live in so great pleasures: but I free-man, and borne of free Parents, who live by honest labour cannot truely so much as dreaming be delighted thus; and so he departs disquieted with griefe. Which thing hapens not from the sight of Monkes, yea the very contrary alwayes useth to fall out. For if he shall behold the sonnes of rich men, and the Nephewes of famous Ancestors to weare those meane garments, which those who are oppressed with extreame poverty would not vouchsafe to weare, and shall know that they reioyce in this very thing; consider with how great comfort he departs, if he be poore, being thus confirmed: and if he be rich, he is easily made more moderate and better by it. And verily in the Theater when a most crafty Harlot walketh about with golden ornaments, the poore are wasted with griefe, that their wives have no such thing: and the rich being troubled with this sight, when they shall see the habit, the countenance, the voyce, the gesture, and other things full of lust, and shall returne home to their houses burning with such dishonest fire, despise their wives as more deformed : Hence chidings and brawles, hence discords and warres arise, hence death also oft-times followes. For those who are taken with this kinde of lust, a life with their wife and children seemes bitter to them: thus all things in their houses are disturbed. No such thing is ever wrought by the quire of Monkes, the wife may receive her husband returning milde from thence, and voyd of all absurd pleasure, so that he may seeme more calme and quiet to her. So that this Play-house quire (pray marke it) is the Fountaine, and originall of all evils, but that of Monkes of all good things. One of them maketh Wolves of Sheepe; the other converteth Wolves into Lambes. But perchance we may seeme as yet to have spoken nothing of pleasure. What therefore is more pleasant then to live in tranquility of minde, lamenting nothing, grieving for nothing; and bewailing nothing? Notwithstanding let us proceed on further, and let us search out the pleasure of both these harmonies and sights, and we shall finde the one remaining onely till the evening, so long as the Spectator sitteth in the Play-house, but afterwards pricking him worse then any sting; but the other alwayes flourishing in the mindes of the Spectators, &c . A sufficient testimony of the accursed bitter sinfull fruits of Stage-playes. In his 89 Himily upon Mathew , he hath this short passage. All those who ascend to Stage-playes or to Harlots houses, are spiritually lame: how then shall these be able to stand in battle, and not to be cast downe with the crimes of incontinency ? In his 2. Homily against the Iewes , he writes thus. If thou hast a servant, if a wife; thou maist keepe them at home with great authority. For if thou permittest them not to goe into the Play-house, how much more are they to be driven from the Synagogue of the Iewes? Here is greater wickednesse then there. That which is done there, is sinne; that which is done here, impiety. I speake not these things to this end that you should suffer them to goe into the Play-house; for even this is evill: but that driving them from Playes, you should even much more prohibit them from this. Goe too, tell me what thou honest to see there? Whether men playing on the Trumpet? But thou oughtest sitting at home, to poure out sighes and teares for them, in that they rebell against the command of God; and in that they have the Devill dancing in the middest of them . In his Homily of Saint Barlaam. Do e ye not (quoth hee) see those who descend from Play-houses made more effeminate? this verily is the cause, that they diligently attend to the things there done. For when as they shall fix in their mindes the invertions of the eyes, the wreathings of the hands, the turnings of the feet, and the images of all those shapes which appeare in the distortion of the circumagitated body, they depart from thence. Is it not therefore an unworthy and shamefull thing, that these should take so much care in procuring the destruction of their soules, and keepe a perpetuall memory of the things that are there acted; and that we whom the imitation of these things shall make equall to Angels, should not bestow an indevor equall unto theirs, to preserve those things that are spoken ? A good item unto all such Play-haunters, and Christians, who can remember much of a Stage-play, but very little or nothing of a godly Sermon, which concernes their soules; of which there are now too many. in his 15. Homily to the people of Antioch ; he rhetorizeth thus. How many Sermons have we bestowed, admonishing many stupid ones that they would utterly relinquish and abandon Theaters, and the lascivious things proceeding from thence? and they did not absteine, but alwayes even unto this day runne to the unlawfull spectacles of Playes and Dances, and set up a Diabolicall assembly against the fulnesse of the Church of God, and their clamors brought from thence with much vehemency, did desturbe the singing of this place. But behold now we being silent, and speaking nothing of this, they have of their owne accord stopped up the Play- house, and the Circus is made unaccessible. And before this many of ours did runne unto them: but now all have fled together from thence unto the Church, and praysed our God. Seest thou how much gaine is made out of feare? For from whence the Devill hoped to have overthrowne our Citty, (to wit, by the abusing and overturning of Theodosius his Statue , the occasion of this and the ensuing Homilies) from thence hath he restored and reformed it, &c. Let us therefore acknowledge the snares, and depart farre from them. Let us take notice of the precipices and not come neere them. This will be an occasion to you of greatest security, not to avoyd sinnes onely, but even those things also, which may seeme to be but indifferent, but yet may drive us unto sinnes; as to laugh and to use iesting speeches, seemeth truely not to be an apparant sinne, but yet it leads men into manifest sin: for Oft-times filthy words arise from laughter, and filthier actions from filthy speeches. Oft-times from filthy speeches and laughter, raylings and reproches arise; from rayling and reproches, blowes and wounds; and from strokes and wounds, murthers and manslaughters. If therefore thou wilt consult well for thy selfe, thou wilt not onely avoyd dishonest words and deeds, and strokes and wounds, and manslaughters, but even unseasonable laughter it selfe, and scurrilous words, because such things are wont to be the roote of those that ensue. Againe, to ascend up into Theaters, and to behold the combates of Horses, and to play at Dice, seeme not to many to be an apparant sinne, but yet they are wont to bring in infinite evils of life. For the abode in Play-houses hath brought forth fornication, wantonnesse, and all incontinency : (a full evidence of my Minors truth:) and the beholding of the fights of Cirque- playes, hath brought with it reproches, blowes, affronts, and perpetuall enmities: and the study about Dice hath produced blaspemies, losses, anger, revilings, and infinite other things worse then these. Let us not therefore onely avoyd sinnes, but even those things that seeme to be indifferent, but yet draw us by little and little into these sins. For as he that goes by a precipice, although he falls not, yet he trembles, and oft-times he tumbles downe being overturned by the very trembling: so he who avoyds not sinnes a far off, but walkes by them, lives with feare & oft-times falls into them. For he who curiously beholds the beauties of others, although he commits not adultery, yet he hath lusted, and according to Christs sentence, he is made an adulterer: and oft-times from concupiscence it selfe, he is really carried into the very sinne. Let us therefore withdraw our selves farre from sinnes. Wilt thou be modest? not onely shun thou adultery, but even a wanton looke. Wilt thou be farre from filthy words? thou must not onely avoyd dishonest speeches, but even dissolute laughter and all concupiscence, &c . Much more then wanton Playes, and wicked Play-houses. In his 17. Homily to the people of Antioch , hee thus discourseth. But doe those things which the King hath done make thee sorrowfull? Verily neither are those things grievous, but they have even brought much profit. For tell me what troublesome thing is done, that he hath stopped the Play-house? that he hath made the Circus inaccessible? that he hath excluded and overturned those fountaines of wickednesse. Would to God it might not be granted, that these should be ever opened againe. Hence the workes of wickednesse have budded forth in the Citty: hence are those who carry a crime in their very manners, selling their voyces unto Dancers, betraying their owne salvation for three farthings, and confounding all things, &c. But now our Citty seemes to be like a beautifull, a faire and modest woman. Feare makes her more meeke and honest, and hath freed her from those wicked ones, who have adventured to commit these horrible wickednesses. Let us not therefore lament with womannish sorrow, for I have heard many saying in the Market place. Woe unto thee Antioch; what is done unto thee! How art thou deprived of honor? And when I had heard it, I derided the childish minde of those who spake such things. For we ought not to say these things now; but when thou shalt see Dancers, Players, Drinkers, Blaspemers, Swearers, Forswearers, Lyers, then use these words. Woe unto thee Citty, what is done unto thee . It appeares then by this excellent discourse, that Play-houses are the Seminaries of all vice and mischiefe; and that those Citties are truely miserable wherein they are but tolerated. To passe by his 19\. Homily to the people of Antioch , where he commends the condition of the Country husband-men, because they had no spectacles of iniquity, no Horse-combates, nor whorish women, &c. Where he withall describes the paines which Tumblers, Players, and Dancers upon the Rope did take to make themselves expert in their professions; with halfe which labour men might overcome their customary sinne of swearing . In his 21. Homily to the same people of Antioch: How absurd a thing is it (writes hee) after that mysticall voyce brought downe out of Heaven by a Cherubin; to defile the eares with whorish songs, and effeminate melodies? Yea how is it not worthy of extreame punishment to behold Harlots, and to practice adultery with the same eyes, with which thou beholdest the secret and dreadfull mysteries? and to returne againe to those pompes of the Devill which thou hast renounced in thy baptisme? Now these pompes of Satan which thou renouncest, are Theaters, and Cirque-playes . And in his 23. Homily to the Antiochians , he hath this excellent discourse worthy of most serious observation. Beloved, externall dignities are fitly manifested by extrinsecall signes that are put about them, but oures oft to be knowne by the soule. For a Christian ought not to be seene onely by his office, but likewise by his newnesse of life. It is fit a believer should shine forth, not onely by those things which he hath received from God but also by those things which he himselfe performes, and to be manifested on all hands by his gesture, by his countenance, by his habit, by his voyce. Now I have spoken these things, not that we should dispose of our selves to ostentation, but to the profit of the beholders. But now from whence shall I know thee to be a Christ? I finde thee on every side conspicuous by the contraries. For if I would learne who thou art, either from the place; I see thee abiding in Cirques, in Theaters, and in iniquities: in the councels of wicked ones, and in the conventicles of desperate hopelesse men. Or from the forme of thy countenance; I see thee alwayes laughing excessively, and dissolute like a recluse Harlet, and vile withall: Or from thy clothes; I see thee no better apparelled, then those who are conversant in the Play-house; Or from thy followers; thou leadest about Parasites and Flatterers: Or from thy words; I heare thee speaking nothing that is savory, or necessary, or conferring to a Christian life: Or from thy table; hence a greater accusation will appeare. From whence then I pray, shall I know thee to be a Christian, all thy words and deeds professing the contrary ? But why doe I say a Christian? For thou art not so much as a man, if I can plainely discerne. For when as thou kickest like an Asse, and playest the wanton as a Bull, and neighest after Women like an Horse, and pamperest thy belly like a Beare, and fattest thy flesh as a Mule, and retainest evill in thy memory like a Camell, and moreover ravenest as a Wolfe, and art angry as a Serpent, and smitest like a Scorpion, and art crafty like a Fox, and keepest the poyson of wickednesse as an Aspe or Viper; and impugnest thy Brethren as that wicked Devill: how shall I be able to number thee among men, when I shall behold in thee the signes of such a nature? For seeking after the difference of a Catechumenish, and a Believer, I am afraid that I shall not finde the difference no not of a man and a beast. For what shall I call thee ? A beast? but beasts are held onely with one of these vices; but thou carrying about all of them together, proceedest on to a greater beastlinesse then they. Or shall I stile thee a Devill? But the Devill serves not the tyranny of the belly, neither doth he love mony. Since then thou hast greater imperfections then Men and devils; how shall we call thee a man? But and if it be not lawfull to call thee a man, how I pray shall we salute thee as a Believer? And that which is worse, neither being so evilly disposed, doest thou thinke of the deformity of thy soule, nor yet consider its filthinesse: but sitting in a Barbers shop , and triming thy haire; taking a glasse, thou diligently examinest the composition of every haire, and advisest with those that stand by, and with the Barber himselfe, whether he hath ordered those haires well that are about thy forehead. And when as thou art for the most part an old man, thou art not ashamed to wax mad with youthfull vanities. But we behold not, not onely the deformity of our soules; but we doe not so much as any whit at all consider that beastly shape, that Sylla, or Chym aera, according to the poets Fables, which we haue put on : by all which it is evident, that they who resort to playes or Play-houses, have not so much as the least Symptomes of any Christianity in them; that they are worse then men, then beasts, then Devils: and carefull onely to adorne their haire, their bodies, but altogether carelesse to correct the grosse deformities and pollutions of their soules. In his Sermon, De Ele emosyna & Hospitalitate ; hee acquaints us: That lascivious and gawdy apparell, which all godly Christians should leave to Danceresses, and lewde singing-women; together with filthy and unseemely pleasure, are reputed comely in Theaters and Stage-playes . A sufficient evidence of their lewdnesse. In his 42. Homily on the Acts , and in his 62. Homily to the people of Antioch , hee writes thus of Playes. but what? Wilt thou that we compare the Prison and the Play-house together? That verily is a place of affliction, but this of pleasure. Goe to therefore, let us see what things doe happen unto both. There, is much philosophy: For where there is sadnesse, there also is philosophy. He who before did gape after riches, who was greatly puffed up, and would scarce suffer an ordinary man to speake unto him; he is then made humble, feare and sorrow being fallen upon his soule like a certaine fire, and softning its hardnesse; then he is made sorrowfull, then he feeleth a worldly change, then he is made strong to all things. But in the Play-house all things are contrary; laughter, wantonnesse, uncleanesse, Diabolicall pompe and pride, prodigality, expence of time, and unprofitable wasting of dayes, the preparation and induction of absurd and filthy lust, the meditation or plotting of adultery, the schoole of fornication and intemperance, the exhortation of filthinesse, the occasion and matter of laughter, the examples of lewdnesse. But it is not so in a prison, where is humility of minde, exhortation and excitation to Philosophy, the contempt of worldly things, all things troden under foot and despised: Yea feare sits by as a Schoolemaster fitting him for all things that he ought to doe. But if thou wilt we will againe inquire into these places after another manner, I would have thee meet with one man comming from a Play-house, and with another going out of a Prison : thou shouldest behold his soule loathsome, distempered, and truely fettered: but this mans loosed, prompt, and almost winged. For he returnes from the Play-house bound with the eyes of the women that are there, carrying bonds heavier then any iron; to wit, the places, words, and habits that are there. But he who goeth from the prison being freed by all, wil not now thinke that he suffers any grieuous thing, comparing his case with other mens; he now gives thankes that he is not bound, he contemnes human things, seeing many rich men in troubles, and great men there imprisoned for many and great things, yea he will suffer any uniust thing, so valiant is he. Moreover many examples of that place will lead him to thinke of the iudgement to come, and he will dread those places seeing them there already. For as he who is there imprisoned, is meeke to all; so he also before the iudgement, before the day to come will be more favourable to his wife, his children, his servants. But men returne not so from the Theater; for the husband will behold the wife more unpleasantly, he will be more cruell to his servants, he will be more sharpe to his children. Play-houses cause great evils in cities, great ones, and neither doe we know by this, how great . In his 12. Homily upon the first Epistle to the Corinthians ; hee condemnes the Heathen lawgivers for countenancing and erecting Play-houses, in these ensuing words. They assemble company to Theaters, bringing in thither whole quiers and troopes of Harlots, of lecherous Boyes, or Ganimedes, who abuse even nature it selfe; and they make all the people to sit in a loftier place. Thus they recreate the citty: thus they crowne great Kings whom they alwayes admire for their Trophies and Victories. But what is more trifling then this honor? What is more unpleasant then this pleasure? Doest thou seeke then applauders of thy actions out of these? and wilt thou, I pray tell me, be commended with Dancers, effeminate persons, Stage players, and whores? and how can this be but extreame madnesse? For I would willingly demand of them; Is it an hainous and unseemely thing to overturne the lawes of nature, and to introduce unlawfull and wicked copulations? All will say it is a grievous and unworthy act: Yea they seeme verily to punish likewise this hainous offence. Why then dost thou bring in those Cyn aeds, & exolete persons? Neither dost thou only bring them in, but thou likewise honorest them with innumerable and unspeakable gifts; And where as thou punishest those who attempt such things in another place, yet here thou spendest mony upon them, and maintainest them at the publike charge, as men deserving well of the Common-wealth. But, saist thou , they are infamous. Why then dost thou traine them up? Why dost thou honour Kings by infamous persons? Why dost thou kill Citties? Yea why also dost thou bestow so much upon them? For if they are infamous, infamous persons ought to be banished. For why hast thou made them infamous? Whether as one that praysest them, or as one who condemnest them? Verily as one who condemnest them. Moreover, thou makest them infamous as one who condemnest them: but yet thou runnest to see them, yea and admirest, laudest and applaudest them, as those who are of honest fame, and good repute . In his Oration of the Kalends , hee writes thus. There is now a war proclaimed against us, not the Amalekeits invading us, or other Barbarians making incursions upon us, as then they did, but Devils leading their pompe in the Market place. For those Diabolicall pernoctations which are this day practised, those scoffes and revilings in Playes, those nocturnall Dances, and those Comedies which should be hissed out, doe vanquish our Citty worse then any enemy: and therefore it is meet, that both those that thus offend, and those who offend not should be deiected, mourne, and be ashamed; these verily for the wickednesses they have committed; but those because they have seene them Brethren to have beene immodest. For although you your selves doe not these things (and O that our Christian Magistrates who connive at Stage-playes would consider it) yet it is altogether unworthy of our religion, if you suffer even others for to doe them, whether they be your servants, your friends, or your neighbours. Whom God doth hate, doe not thou commend; but he hates every one who liveth in iniquity though he abound in wealth. It is lawfull for thee to reprove and correct them for the glory of God. But how is it lawfull to chide for God ? If thou shalt see a drunkard, or a theefe, or a servant, or a friend, or any other that is thy neighbour, either running into a Play-house; Or betraying his owne soule, or swearing, for swearing, or lying, be angry with him, punish him, reclaime him, correct him; and thou hast done all this for God . In his 6\. Oration. That all vices arise from sloath : hee writes thus of play-haunters. Before the last day, our speech to your charity was purposely and wholy of the Devill. At which time, some verily, when as we were discoursing of these things out of this place, did then idlely behold the pompe of the Devill in Play-houses, and did then heare whorish songs; but you did give your mindes to the most pleasant spirituall Doctrine. Who then hath made them thus to erre? Who hath avocated them from the holy Sheepefold ? Verily the Devill hath deceived them, but he hath not deceived you . Those therefore who runne to Play-houses are deceived and led thither by the Devill, if this holy Father may be credited. And in his 8. Homily of Repentance , with which I will conclude: hee hath this memorable passage against Stage-playes and Play-houses, which should make all Players and Play-haunters for to tremble; which passage likewise fully proves the Minor of my former Syllogisme. We may undergoe the paines of a fast, and yet not obtaine the fruit of a fast. But how? To wit, when we absteine from meate, but not from sinne; when we fast the whole day in want, and then spend what we have saved in unchaste Play-houses. Loe the paines of a fast, the fruit of a fast , (much more then of prayer, of hearing, reading, receiving the sacrament, and all other holy duties, which I beseech all play-haunters to consider) is wholy lost, when as we ascend the Play-house of iniquity. My speech is not directed unto you, for I know that you are free from this accusation. But it is the custome of those who are loden with griefe, when as those are not present who give the occasion of griefe, to rush upon those who are present. For what gaine is it to goe up to the Play-houses of wickednesse, to enter into the common shop of luxury, and the publike schoole of incontinency; or to sit in the chaire of pestilence ? For if any one shall call the Play-house, the chaire of pestilence, the schoole of incontinence, the shop of luxury, and the Scaffold of all uncleanesse, he should not offend: that most wicked place being a Babilonish Brothell full of many diseases: when thou art driven unto a Play-house, thou entrest into a direct Stewes. The Devill thus furnishing the Citty with infernall flames, doth not now put under stalkes of hempe besmeared with Brimstone, nor Marle, nor Flax, nor Pitch, as that Barbarian did; but things farre worse then these; leacherous sights, filthy words, anointed members, and songs full of all lewdnesse. That whore- house then, barbarous hands have burned; but this whore-house cogitations more foolish then Barbarians have kindled: this being worse then that, since the fire is worse, which doth not waste the nature of the body, but the good state and disposition of the minde. And that which is worse, neither those who are burned doe perceive it. For if they did feele it, they would not now send forth such an effuse laughter in Play-houses. Therefore this is the very worst evill, when as one is weakned, and yet knoweth not this, that he is diseased: and burning miserably and loathsomely, doth not feele the burning. What profit, tell me, is there then of fasting, when as thou drivest thy body from lawfull nutriment, but yet bringest in wicked nourishment to thy soule? When as thou spendest the day sitting in the Theater beholding common nature deturpated, deformed, and unchaste women condemned to adultery, collecting there the evils of every house? For liberty is there given both to see fornications, and to heare blasphemies, whereby both by the eyes, and by the eare, a disease may proceed to the very soule it selfe: they imitate the calamities and mischances of others, from whence the contagion of filthinesse gets into our selves. Tell me therefore, what profit there is of fasting, the soule being fed with such meates? With what eyes wilt thou behold thy wife from these Theaters? with what eyes wilt thou looke upon thy sonne, thy servant, thy friend? Verily it must needs be that he that speaketh there, or he that holds his peace, should be confounded with shame at the filthinesse that is acted. but thou departest not so from hence: for it is lawfull for thee with much confidence to repeate all things at home, Propheticall speeches, Apostolicall precepts, Divine lawes; to furnish or set to every table of vertue, and to make thy wife more chaste, thy sonne more dutifull, thy servant more deare with the same repetitions; yea and thou shalt perswade thy very enemy to lay aside his hatred. Dost thou see how these precepts verily are every where holsome, but those sound filthily in every place? What profit therefore of fasting, when as thou fastest with thy body, but committest adultery with thine eyes? Adultery is not onely that conglutination of body to body, but even an unchaste looke. What benefit is there then when as thou goest to the Play-house from hence ? I correct, the Player corrupts: I administer salves to thy disease, he ministers the cause of the disease: I extinguish the flame of nature, he kindles the flame of lust. What profit is there, tell me? One edifying, and another pulling downe, what have they profited themselves by their labour? Therefore let us not be occupied here in vaine, but profitably, whereby we may fruitfully, whereby we may lesse in vaine, whereby we may not unprofitably and to condemnation meete here, one building, and the other pulling downe; lest the multitude of builders bee overcome with the easinesse of the pulling downe. Truely it is a part of great uncleanesse both for yong men and old men to hasten to the Play-house. But would to God the evill did extend no further. For this perchance seemeth intollerable to an ingenuous man, and worthy to be punished with the greatest losse, with reproofe and shame: but verily this correction is not at al inflicted so far as to shame. But yet torments and punishments hang over Play-haunters heads: for it must needs be that those who sit there should swim in the sinne of adultery, not because they are coupled to women, o[illeg.] because they behold them with unchaste eyes. For with these it must of necessity be, that every one is surprised in adultery. Neither will I speake my owne words to you whereby you may lesse regard it, but I will explicate the Divine Law, where there is no place for neglect. What therefore saith the Divine Law ? You have heard that it hath beene said of old; Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, that whosoever shall looke upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart; Hast thou seene adultery committed? Hast thou seene sinne finished? And that which is worst in adulteries, thou hast seene him that is taken in adultery to be guilty of adultery, not under any humane, but under a Devine Sentence; hence deadly punishments : For whosoever shall looke upon a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his heart. He doth not onely extirpate the disease, but likewise the roote of the disease: for unchaste concupiscence is the roote of adultery, So likewise doe Phisicians: they looke diligently not onely to diseases, but likewise to the taking away of their causes: although they see the eye diseased, yet they represse the evill rewme that is above in the temples. Thus Christ also doeth. Adultery is an evill blindnesse, it is a disease of the eyes, not of the body onely, but first of the soule: Therefore he stops the reume of uncleanesse from thence by the feare of the law. Wherefore he not onely punisheth adultery, but avengeth concupiscence likewise . He that looketh upon a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. These bare words repeated are sufficient to purge away all the disease of sinne. But pardon us, we cleanse wounds, and he who purgeth wounds must apply bitter medicines. But by how much the more they shall indure my words, by so much the more shall the poyson be purged out . By all these faithfully recited passages of holy Chrysostome , which I would Players and Play-haunters would seriously, would frequently read over; it is most apparant; that Stage-playes are the immediate common occasions of much actuall lewdnesse, adultery, and other grosse uncleanesse: which should cause all christians to abominate them, and to keepe their wives and children from them, as the ancient pagan germans did , for feare they should corrupt their chastity and draw them on to publike lewdnesse. To passe by the concurrent testimonies of Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Lactantius, Basil, Nazienzen, Origen, Hierom, Hilary, Augustine, Cyril, Salvian, and all the other Fathers, Councels, and Authors , quoted in the precedent scene, who give punctuall testimony of this truth, as their words there cited will sufficiently manifest; I shall confine my selfe onely to foure of our owne English Authors for small confirmation of my minors verity. The first of them is Alexander Fabritius , in his Destructorium Vitiorum. pars 4. cap. 23. De Ludis inhonestis , or dishonest Playes. The second kind (writes he) of unlawfull playes, is the Play of lascivious vanity; such as are Dancing, Enterludes, and other Theatricall Playes; which are called Playes, from the Theater or Play-house which is a publike place, where the people hath accustomed to meet together to play; because after such Playes ended whores are oft times prostituted in such Playes. And so such Playes are very often the cause of fornication, whoredome and adultery; and therefore the devill is delighted in such playes: and as it appeareth, a perfect man ought not to give his minde to such sports with which the Devill is delighted. And therefore worthily saith Saint Augustine: Let him withdraw himselfe from the Spectacles of the world who will obtaine the perfect grace of remission. For Dyna the Daughters of Iacob; of whom it is written in the 34. Of Genesis: when Iacob came into the Land of Canaan , Dinah his Daughter walked abroad, to wit, to the spectacles of the world, that she might see the women of that Country; whom Sychim the Sonne of the King of that Country seeing, he was inamored with her, tooke her and ravished her perforce. But as Saint Augustine saith, if she had continued at home among her owne she had not beene defloured by a forraigne ravisher. Therefore the soule ought by so much the more to beware and to restraine it selfe, because she is not once, but oft-times ravished and defloured; let her feare now having had experiment of that which she was ignorant of being yet a Virgin . Adde wee to him the testimony of Master Philip Stubs in his Anatomy of abuses. Doe not Playes (writes he) maintaine Bawdry, insinuate foolery and renew the remembrance of heathen Idolatry? Doe they not induce to whoredome and uncleanesse? Nay, are they not rather plaine devourers of Maidenly virginity and chastity? For proofe whereof but marke the flocking and running to Theaters and Curtens, daily and hourely, night and day, time and tide, to see playes and Enterludes, where such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches, such laughing and fleering, such kissing and bussing, such clipping and culling such winking and glancing of wanton eyes and the like is used, as is wonderfull to behold. Then these goodly Pageants being ended, every mate sorts to his mate, every one brings another homeward on the way very friendly, and in their secret conclaves (covertly) they play the Sodomites, or worse. And these be the fruits of Playes and Enterludes for the most part. And whereas you say there are good examples to be learned in them: truely so there are: if you will learne to play the vice, to teare, sweare, and blaspeame both Heaven and Earth: if you will learne to become a Bawde, to be uncleane, to devirginate Maides, to defloure honest Wives, &c. If you will learne to sing and talke of bawdy love and venery, &c. If you will learne to play the Whore-master, the Glutton, Drunkard, or incestuous person: and finally, if you will learne to contemne God and all his Lawes, to care neither for Heaven nor Hell, and to commit all kinde of sinne and mischiefe, you need goe to no other Schools; for all these good Examples you may see painted before your eyes in Enterludes and Playes . Wherefore, that man who giveth money for the maintenance of them, must needs incurre the inevitable sentence of eternall damnation, unlesse he repent . Thus hee. Stephen Gosson a penitent reclaimed play-poet ( whose eyes did shed many teares of sorrow, whose heart sweat many drops of blood, when he remembred Stage-playes , to which he was once addicted) writes much to this effect. I will shew you (writes hee) what I see, and informe you what I read of Playes. Ovid said, that Romulus built his Theater as a Horse-faire for Whores, made Triumphes and set up Playes to gather the faire women together, that every one of his Souldiers might take where he liked a snatch for his share, &c. It should seeme that the abuse of such places was so great, that for any chaste Liver to haunt them was a blacke Swan and a white Crow : Dion so straitly forbiddeth the ancient Families of Rome and Gentlewomen that tender their name and honour to come to Theaters, and rebukes them so sharpely when he takes them napping, that if they be but once seene there, he iudgeth it sufficient cause to speake ill of them, and thinke worse. The shaddow of a knave hurts an honest man; the sent of a Stewes an honest Matron, and the shew of Theaters a simple gazer, &c. Cookes doe never shew more craft in their iunkets to vanquish the taste, nor Painters in shadowes to allure the eye, then Poets in Theaters to wound the conscience. There set they abroach strange consorts of melody to tickle the eare; costly apparell to flatter the sight; effeminate gesture, to ravish the sence; and wanton speech, to whet desire to inordinate lust. These by the privy entries of the eare slip downe into the heart, and with gunshot of affection gaule the minde where reason and affection should rule the roste , Domitian suffred playing and dancing so long in Theaters, that Paris led the shaking of the sheets with Domitia, and Menster the Trenchmoore with Messalina, & c. in Rome Ovid chargeth his Pilgrims to creepe close to the Saints whom they serve, and shew their double diligence to lift the Gentlewomans robes from the ground, for soyling in the dust: to sweepe moates from their kirtles, to keepe their fingers in ure, to lay their hands at their backes for an easie stay; to looke upon those, whom they beheld; to prayse that, which they commend; to like every thing that pleaseth them: to present them Pomegranets to picke as they sit; and when all is done to wait on them mannerly to their houses. In our Assemblies at Playes in London, you shall see such heaving and shoving, such itching and shouldring, to sit by women: such care for their garments, that they be not trod on: such eyes to their laps that no chips light in them: such pillowes to their backes, that they take no hurt: such making in their eares I know not what: such giving them Pippins to passe the time: such playing at foote Saunt without Cards: such ticking, such toying, such smiling, such winking, and such manning them home when the sports are ended, that it is a right Comedy, to marke their behaviour, to watch their conceits, as the Cat the Mouse, and no good as a course at the Game it selfe, to dogge them a little or follow aloofe by the print of their feet, and so discover by flot where the Deare taketh soyle. If this were as well noted, as ill seene; or as openly punished, as secretly practised; I have no doubt but the cause would be feared to drie up the effect, and these pretty Rabbets very cunningly ferreted from their buroowes . For they that lacke customers all the weeke, either because their haunt is unknowne, or the Constables and Officers of their Parish watch them so narrowly, that they dare not queatch; to celebrate the Sabbath flocke to Theaters and there keepe a generall Market of Bawdry. Not that any filthinesse indeed is committed within the compasse of that ground, as was done in Rome, but that every Wanton and his Paramour, every Man and his Mistris, every Iohn and his Ioane, every Knave and his Queane, are there first acquainted and cheapen the merchandise in that place which they pay for else-where as they can agree. I intend not to shew you all that I see, nor halfe that I heare of these abuses, lest you iudge me more wilfull to teach, then willing to forbid them . Thus farre this penitent play-poet from his owne experience. The last of these witnesses with whom I will conclude, is the Anonymous Author of the Booke intituled, the third Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters ; Penned by a Play-poet, and common Play-haunter, who had good experience of the lewde effects of Stage-playes, which made him to abhorre them, and to renounce his wicked profession, as being incompatible with Christian Religion or his owne salvation , as himselfe professeth in that Treatise, where he writes thus as followes. Such doubtlesse is mine opinion of common Playes, that in a Christian Common-weale they are not sufferable. My reason is, because they are publike enemies to nature and religion; allurements unto sinne; corrupters of good manners; the cause of security and carelesnesse; meere Brothel-houses of Bawdery; and bring both the Gospell into slander, the Sabbath into contempt, mens soules into danger; and finally the whole Common-weale into disorder. Great and haynous speeches, no doubt, yet not so hainous, as the exercise of them is odious: biting words; yet not so bitter as the cause requireth. It were ill painting the Devill like an Angeil; he must be portraied as he is, that he may the better be knowne, Sinne hath alway a faire cloake to cover his filthy body. And therefore he is to be turned out of his case into his naked skinne, that his nasty filthy body, and stinking corruption being perserved; he might come into the hatred and horror of men. For as we are naturally of our selves evill and corrupt; so are we naturally giuen to love our selves, and to be blinded with our owne affections insomuch that what we know to be evill, we are not ashamed either openly to detend, or slily to cloake. The excuse of wickednesse is but the encrease of punishment, and an ill cause defended by authority, and maintained by learning, brings Magistrates into slander, and learning into contempt. Therefore to the end that others should not be deceived with that wherewith my selfe was overtaken, I thought it my part to lay open to all mens eyes the horrible abuse as well of Playes, as of the Inactors, and the disorder of their auditory; that the abuse being perceived, every man might reforme himselfe, and be weaned from their wickednesse: or otherwise, that the Magistrates being informed might take such good wayes, that the intollerable exercise of Playes might be utterly put downe. For I am verily perswaded, that if they may be permitted still to make sale of sinns, we shall pull on our heads Gods vengeance, and to our Realme bring an utter confusion. What I shall speake of Playes of my owne knowledge, I know may be affirmed by hundreds, to whom those matters are as well knowne as to my selfe. Some Cittizens Wives (and I would to God our married Cittizens would well consider it because it concernes them neerely) upon whom the Lord for ensample to others hath layd his hands, have even on their death-beds with teares confessed, that they have received at these Spectacles such filthy infections, as have turned their mindes from chaste cogitations, and made them of honest women light buswives : (which very thing is likewise testified by reverend Bishop Babington , in his Exposition on the 7. Commandement ; and by Doctor Layton , in his Speculum belli Sacri. cap . 45. and therefore worthy credit under the hands of these three witnesses:) by them they have dishonoured the Vessels of Holinesse, and have brought their Husbands into contempt, their Children into question, their bodies into sicknesse, and their soules into the assault of a dangerous state. Such is the nature and inclination of us all, that we runne whether affection leads us, and are withdrawne by company. And therefore as David saith . With the godly thou wilt shew thy selfe godly, with the upright man thou wilt shew thy selfe upright, with the pure thou wilt shew thy selfe pure, and with the froward thou wilt shew thy selfe froward. The repaire of them that are honest to those places of evill resort, makes their owne good life to be doubted of; for that the place breeds suspition as well of good as of bad. For who can see man or woman resort to an house which is notoriously wicked, but will iudge them to be of the crew of the wicked and ungodly ? The most honest wife, is the soonest assaulted, and hath such snares laid to entrap her, as, if God assist her not, (he must needs be taken. When I gave my selfe first to note the abuse of common playes, I found my heart sore smitten with sorrow ( sinne did there so abouna, and was so openly commited, that I looked when God in iustice would have presently in his wrath have confounded the beholders .) The Theater I found to be an appointed place of Bawdery, mine owne eares have heard honest women allured with abominable speeches. Sometime I have seene two knaves at once importunate upon one light huswife, whereby much quarrell hath growne to the disquieting of many. The servants as it is manifestly to be proved, have consented to rob their Masters to supply the want of their Harlots: there is the practising of married wives to traine them from their husbands, and places appointed for meeting and conference. When I had taken notice of these abuses, and saw that the theater was become the Consultory- house of Satan, I concluded with my selfe, never to imploy my pen to so vile a purpose, nor to be an instrument of gathering the wicked together. It may seeme I am overlavish of speech, and that which I have publikely expressed of others by mine owne knowledge might have beene dissembled. But I have learned, that he who dissembles the evill that he knowes in other men, is as guilty before God of the offence, as the offenders themselves. And the Lord hath expresly commanded in Exodus, that, wee should not follow a multitude to doe evill, neither agree in a controversie to decline after many, and overthrow the truth. I cannot therefore but resist such wickednesses, lest I might seeme to maintaine them. For he that dissembles ungodlinesse is a traytor to God. Since therefore that the cause is Gods, I dare presse forth my selfe to be an Advocate against Satan unto the rooting out of sinne. Are not our eyes at Playes, carryed away with the pride of vanity? Our eares abused with amorous, that is, lecherous, abominable and filthy speech? Is not our tongne (which is given us onely to glorifie God withall) there imployed to the blaspheming of Gods holy Name, or the commendation of that is wicked? Are not our hearts through the pleasure of the flesh, the delight of the eye, and the fond motions of the minde withdrawne from the service of the Lord, and the meditation of his goodnesse ? No zealous heart but mout needs bleed to see how many Christian soules are there swallowed up in the whirlpoole of Devillish impudency. Whosoever shall visit the Chappell of Satan, I meane the Theater, shall finde there no want of young Ruffians, not lacke of Harlots utterly past all shame, who presse to the forefront of the Scaffold, to the end to shew their impudency, and to be as an object to all mens eyes. Yea, such is their open shamelesse behaviour, as every man may perceive by their wanton gestures whereunto they are given: yea they seeme there to be like Brothels of the Stewes. For often without respect of the place and company which behold them, they commit that filthinesse openly, which is horrible to be done in secret, as if what soever they did were warranted: for neither reverence, iustice, nor any thing beside can governe them. Alas that Youth should become so devillish and voyd of the feare of God. Let Magistrates assure themselves, that without speedy redresse all things will grow so farre out of order, that they will be past remedy. Shamefulnesse and modesty is quite banished from yong men: they are utterly shamelesse, stubborne, and impudent. It was well said of Calvin, that a man setled in evill will make but a mocke of Religion. He preacheth in vaine that preacheth unto the deafe. Tell many of these men of the Scripture, they will scoffe and turne it into a iest. Rebuke them for breaking the Sabbath day, they will say you are a man of the Sabbath, you are very precise, you will allow us nothing: you will have nothing but the Word of God; you will permit us no recreation, but have men like Asses, who never rest but when they are eating. Seeke to withdraw these fellowes from the Theater unto a Sermon, they will say, By the Preacher they may be edified, but by the Player both edified and delighted. So that in them the saying of Saint Paul is verified, where he saith , That the wisedome of the flesh is nothing but enmity against God. How small heed take they of themselves, which suffer their owne wicked affections to withdraw them from God and his Word. We need not voluntarily seeke our owne destruction. For he that is vertuously disposed shall finde lewde persons enow to withdraw him from well-doing by the promise of pleasure and delightfull pastime, whereunto we are naturally inclined unto the Schools-house of Satan, and Chappell of ill counsell, where he shall see so much iniquity and loosenesse, and so great outrage and scope of sinne, that it is a wonder if he returne not either wounded in conscience, or changed in life. I would wish therefore all Masters not onely to withdraw themselves, but their servants also from such wicked assemblies for it is alwayes wisedome to shunne the occasions of evill. Youth will be withdrawne by company, if they be not restrained of their liberty. They need not seeke out for schoole-masters, they can learne evill too fast of themselves, and are pregnant enough at home to learne unhappinesse . Many of nature honest and tractable, have beene altered by these shewes and spectacles, and become monsterous. Mans minde which of it selfe is prone unto vice, is not to be pricked forward unto vice, but brideled: if it be left unto it selfe, it hardly standeth; if it be driven forth, it runneth headlong. Flee farre from Babylon, yee that carry the Lords vessels . Forsomuch as you are baptised into Christ, it standeth you upon to be holy both of body and minde, and to dedicate your selves to his service, which ye shall never doe, unlesse you withdraw your selves from the inticements of vanity, and eschue the occasions of evill; which that ye may the better doe, you are to fasten your eyes upon God, by whom ye are sanctified . Let not the examples of the wicked be a president unto us, neither let us be drawne away to evill with the multitude. Custome shall but make us bold in sinne, and the company of scorners make us more impudent of life. It is not enough for us to excuse our selves by the doings of other men; it will not be taken for an excuse, although we could alleage; that every man doth as we doe. For it is no meanes to acquite us before God, to say that others be no better then our selves. I would rather wish that the evill conversation of others might be an occasion to draw us backe, lest perhaps we be wrapped in the vices that raigne in all the wicked, and so be partakers of the punishment due to them. For we are not to walke as men that looke onely upon the creatures, but our part is, to set God before our eyes, whose presence we cannot possibly escape. It is marvelous to consider how the gesturing of a Player, which Tully termeth, the eloquence of the body, is of force to move, and prepare a man to that which is ill. For such things are disclosed to the eye and to the eare, as might a great deale better be kept close. Whereby a double offence is committed; First, by these dissolute Players, which without regard of honesty are not ashamed to exhibite the filthiest matters they can devise to the sight of men: Secondly, by the beholders, which vouchsafe to heare and behold such filthy things, to the great losse both of themselves and the time. There commeth much evill in at the eares, but more at the eyes, by these two open windowes death breaketh into the soule. Nothing entreth in more effectually into the memory, then that which commeth by seeing: things heard doe; lightly passe away, but the tokens of that we have seene, saith Petrarch, stickes fast in us whether we will or no. Many have beene entangled with the webs of these Spiders, who would gladly have beene at liberty when they could not. The webs are so subtily spun, that there is no man that is once within them, that can avoyd them without danger. None can come within these snares that may escape untaken, be she Maide, Matron, or whatsoever: such force have their enchantments of pleasure to draw the affections of the minde. This inward fight (let married men consider it) hath vanquished the chastity of many women ; some by taking pitty of the deceitfull teares of the Stage-lover have beene moved by their complaint to rue on their secret friends, whom they have thought to have tasted the like torment: some having noted the ensamples how Maydens restrained from the marriage of those whom their friends have misliked, have there learned a pollicy to prevet their parents, by stealing them away: some seeing by the ensample of the stage player one carryed with two much liking of another mans wife, having noted by what practise she hath beene assailed and overtaken have not failed to put the like in effect in earnest, that was showne in iest. The wilinesse and craft of the Stage is not yet so great as is that without on the Scaffolds; for that they which are evill disposed no sooner heare any thing spoken that may serve their turne but they apply it to themselves. Alas say they to their familiar by them, Gentlewoman, is it not pitty this passioned Lover should be so martyred? and if he find her inclined to foolish pitty, as commonly such women are, then be applies the matter to himselfe, and saith, that he is likewise carried away with the liking of her: craving that pitty to be extended upon him, as she seemed to shew toward the afflicted amorous Stager. These running headed Lovers are growne so perfect Schollers by long continuance at this Schoole, that there is almost no word spoken, but they can make matter of it to serve their turne. They can so surely discover the conceits of the minde, and so cunningly handle themselves, and are growne so subtile in working their matters, that neither the iealousie of Iuno, who suspecteth all things; nor the strait keeping of Danaes may debar; nor the watchfulnesse of Argos with his hundred eyes espy. Credit me , there can be found no stronger engine to batter the honesty as well of wedded Wives, as the chastity of unmarried Maides and Widdowes, then are the hearing of Common playes. There, wanton Wives Fables, and Pastorall songs of love, which they use in their Comicall discourses (all which are taken out of the secret Amory of Venus, and practising bawdery,) turne all chastity upside downe, and corrupt the good disposition and manners of youth, insomuch that it is a miracle, if there be found either any Woman or Maide which with these spectacles of strange lust, is not oftentimes inflamed even unto fury. The nature of their Comedies are, for the most part after one manner of nature, like the tragicall Comedy of Calistus, where the Bawdresse Scelestina, inflamed the Mayden Melibeia with her Sorceries. Doe we not use in these discourses to counterfeit Witchcraft, charmed drinkes, and amorous potions, thereby to draw the affections of men, and to stirre them up unto lust, to like even those whom of themselves they abhorre? The ensamples whereof stirre up the ignorant multitude to seeke by such unlawfull meanes the love and good will of others. I can tell you of a Story of like practice used of late by a iealous Wife to her Husband, whose heart being, as she thought estranged, otherwise then of custome, did practise with a Sorceresse to have some powder, which might have force to renew her Husbands wonted good will towards her: but it had such a vertue in the operation, that it welnigh brought him his bane, for his memory thereby was gone, so that if God had not dealt miraculously with him by reveiling it, it had cost him his life. The like we read of Lucullus and Lucretius, who by drinking such amorous confections lost first their wits, and afterwards their lives. the device of carrying and recarrying letters by Landresses, practising with Pedlers to transport their tokens by colourable meanes to sell their Merchandices, and other kinde of pollicies to beguile Fathers of their Children, Husbands of their Wives, Gardians of their Wards, and Masters of their Servants, is it not aptly taught in the Schoole of abuse? But hush, no more. I am sorry this schoole is not plucke downe, and the schoole-masters banished this Citty. Thus much I will tell them, if they suffer these Brothel-houses to continue, or doe in any wise allow them, the Lord will say unto them as the Psalmist saith . If thou sawest a Theefe thou wentest with him, and haddest thy part with adulterers: thou hast done these things, and because I held my peace, thou hast beleeved; wicked man, that I am like unto thee: but I will accuse thee,  &c. Thus farre our owne Play-poet from his owne experience. By these three severall witnesses, to which I might accumulate infinite ethers , it is most apparant, that Stage-playes are the ordinary occasions of much actuall whoredome, adultery, and such like beastly lewdnesse; that they are the common Nurseries, Schooles, and Seminaries of Adulterers, Adulteresses, Whore-masters, Whores, and such polluted creatures. This therefore should cause all chaste, all sober Christians to abominate them; all Protestant states and churches to abandon them. we all condemne Pope Sixtus the IV. with the unholy holy Church of Rome, for erecting and allowing publike Stewes, which yeeld above twenty thousand Duckats of annuall revenue to the Pope his filthinesse , (for holinesse in this respect I cannot stile it,) which summe is cast up among the constant annuall revenue of the Church ; whereas God himselfe forbids the hire of an Whore to be cast into the Treasury of his Sanctuary . If then we all censure the Papists, and that deservedly, for tollerating, for erecting Stewes, where their Priests, their Monkes, and Friers, who have vowed perpetuall chastity (such is their hypocriticall boldnesse) may recreate themselves at pleasure without any breach of vow, their owne Bishops enioyning every of them to pay an annuall pension for their concubines, whether they use or use them not, because they may use them if they will : shall we our selves erect or tollerate Play- houses, which are no other but a publike Stewes, a professed Brothel -house , as the recited Authors, and the Fathers stile them? God forbid. Our Religion, our God enjoyne us not to doe it, in that they command us: not to commit adultery : to flee fornication, and uncleanesse; yea , not so much as once to name them (much lesse to act, to countenance, or propagate them) as becommeth Saints. Our Stage-playes therefore must certainely be sinnefull, and abominable even in this respect. The fift effect of Stage-playes, is the generall depravation of the mindes, the manners, both of their Actors and Spectators; which administreth the 31. Argument against them. That which ordinarily corrupts the mindes, and vitiates the manners, both of the Actors and Spectators, must doubtlesse be unlawfull, yea abominable unto Christians, if not intollerable in any Christian wel-ordered Common-weale. But Stage-playes ordinarily corrupt the mindes , and vitiate the manners, both of their Actors and Spectators. Therefore, they must doubtlesse bee unlawfull, yea abominable unto Christians, intollerable in any Christian wel-ordered Common-weale. The Major is most apparantly evident: First from the very principals of reason: For what-ever vitiates another thing (especially mens mindes and manners) must needs be corrupt it selfe , the depravation of the one, arising meerely from the pravity of the other : If Stageplayes therefore corrupt the manners, the mindes of others, they cannot but be ill themselves. Secondly, from the grounds of Theology: which as they enjoyne men to avoyd the corruptions that are in the world through lust : to eschue all occasions of evill , all scurrilous idle speeches , all wicked places, all lewde companions which may defile their soules, their manners; and to keepe themselves unspotted of the world : So they condemne all occasions of evill , all dishonest contaminating pleasures of sinne which filthily disteine mens soules. Thirdly, from the rudiments of civill policy. For as the happinesse, honor, life and safety of every Common-weale consists in the ingenuity, temperance, and true virtuous dispositions of the peoples mindes and manners; so the distemperature, malady, and confusion of it alwayes issue, from the exorbitant obliquity, the uncontroled dissolutenesse, and degeneracy of their vitious lives, which bring certaine ruine, Whence the most prudent Princes, and Republiques in all ages, have constantly suppressed all such pleasures, as might either empoyson the yonger peoples manners, or pervert their mindes . The Major therefore is irrefragable. The Minor, is an avowed truth, not onely ratified by experience, but by the concurrent testimony of sundry States and Writers in all ages, both Pagan and Christian. To begin with Pagan Authors, States, and Magistrates. The unparalleld Philosopher Plato , as his owne Workes, with sundry others testifie, banished all Stage-players, Play-poets, and Play-poems out of his Common-weale, as being the chiefe instruments to effeminate the mindes, to vitiate the manners of the people, (especially the yonger sort) and to withdraw them from the study of vertue, to the love of vice. Aristotle , the Oracle of all humane literature, excludes these Stage-playes out of his Republicke; debarring youthes and children from them, as being apt to poyson both their mindes and manners, with their grosse scurrility and lascivious shewes. Solon , the wisest of the ancient Grecian Lawgivers, reiected Stage-playes; not onely as lying, but deceitfull fictions; which would quickly teach men both to cheat, to steale, to play the hypocrites and dissemblers, and to circumvent men in their dealings, to the publike preiudice: whence he deemed them unsufferable mischiefes in a Citty. Tully, declaimes against all pleasurable effeminate amorous Playes and Poets, as the contagions of mens mindes and manners, through their excessive delicacy: whence he adviseth the Romans to abandon them, lest they should effeminate and corrupt them as they had done the Grecians, and so subvert their Empire. Seneca informes us, that there is nothing so pernicious to good manners, as to sit idlely at Stage-playes: for then vices easily creepe upon us through pleasure: And therefore he much bewailes the frequent concourse of the Roman Youth to Playes and Theaters, as an undoubted symptome of a degerated declining State, then neere to ruine , Plutarch , an eminent Moralist and Historian, disapproves all Stage-playes; not onely as lascivious vanities, occasioning much prodigall vaine expence to the Republikes dammage; but as contagious evils, which blast the vertues, marre the ingenious education, corrupt the lives and manners of all those who frequent them, and with all he reports of Gorgias, that he reputed Tragedies and Stage-playes, meere impostures. Livy the gravest Roman Historian, writes of Playes: That they are scarce a tollerable folly or madnesse in wealthy Kingdomes: affirming withall, that these Stage-playes which were brought into Rome at first with an intent to asswage the Plague, and to attone their enraged Devill gods; did farre more infect the mindes of the Romans, then the Pestilence did their bodies . Valerius Maximus relating the manner and cause of introducing Stage-playes among the Romans, records; that they were brought in, and devisedl onely for the worship of their Devill-Idols and the delight of men; and that not without the blush or shame of peace; the Romanes having steined both their pleasures and religion with civill blood, by meanes of scenicall Prodigies . So that he reputed the tollerating of Playes, a blemish to the Roman State, which he there concludes, to be intollerable mischiefes in a Republike, and grand empoysoners of mens manners, from the Massilienses example, which he there applaudes. Socrates, the very wisest Gr aecian, by the expresse resolution of the Delphian Oracle , condemned all Comedies as pernicious, lascivious, scurrilous, and unseemely pastimes, to which he refused to resort; which caused Aristophanes, that carping Comedian, to traduce him on the Stage. Isocrates , that grave Gr aecian Orator, declaimes against all Playes and Actors as pernicious, scurrilous, fabulous, ridiculous, invective, and expensive, not tollerable in a Citty . That valiant Roman Marius , in his Oration to the Roman Senate and people; produceth this as an argument both of his wisedome, temperance, valour and vertue, which some objected to him as a disparagement, that he kept never a Stage-player, nor costly Cooke about him, as other voluptuous, effeminate dissolute Romans did , whom he stiles, most filthy men. Caius Plinius Secundus in his Panegyricke to the Emperour Traian , stiles Stage-playes; effeminate arts and studies, altogether unbeseeming the world; whence he highly applaudes this Emperour for banishing them the Roman Empire, whose honor they had blemished, whose vertues they had cankered , and in his Epistles likewise, he declaimes against them, as intollerable mischiefes in a Common-weale, for the precedent reasons. Cornelius Tacitus , an Historian of no small repute, informes us, that the hereditary ancient manners of the Romanes were by little and little corrupted and abolished, and their publike discipline subverted by Stage-playes; whence he declaimes against them as the very plagues, and overthrow of the Roman State : inveighing much against that Monster Nero, who corrupted the Roman Nation, and drew them on to all kinde of vice, of luxury and lewdnesse, by these accursed Stage-playes, to the publike ruine . And not onely he, but likewise Polibius , Dion Cassius , Iustin , Suetonius , Plutarch , Herodian , Iulius Capitolinus , Trebellius Pollio , Flavius Vopiscus, and Invenal . (to passe by Eutropius , Orosius , Zonaras , Grimston , Opmeerus , with other Christian Historians) condemne and censure , Nero, Claudius, Tiberius, Commodus, Heliogabalus, Verus, Balbinus, Maximinus, Gallienus, Solonius, Carinus, and other dissolute Roman Emperours; for acting, countenancing and frequenting Playes; and harbouring Stage-players, (with whom they sometimes fraught their Courts) which did not only exhaust their treasures, and impoverish their subjects, but even corrupt their discipline, and strangely vitiate and deprave not onely their owne, but the very peoples mindes and manners, by drawing them on to all licentious dissolutenesse , and excesse of vice, to the very utter subversion of their States, as these Authors ioyntly testifie, whose walls could not secure them when as their vertues, their manners were gone quite to ruine. Horace and Iuvenal . in their severall Satyricall Poems, together with Gellius Noctium Atticaru. lib. 20. cap. 4. inveigh against these Stage-playes, Players, and Stage-houses, as the occasions of much villany and lewdnesse; the corrupters of youth, especially of the female sex, who were made Strumpets by them; and as the shames, the blemishes of the Citties where they were permitted . The wanton Poet Ovid ; who was farre enough, I am sure, from all Puritanicall precisenesse, as men now stile it, is even a rancke Puritan in this case of Stage-playes, For after he had informed his bawdy leacherous companions; that Playes and Play-houses were the best places of Mart for unchaste bargaines; the most commodious haunts for amorous Lovers, and Whore-masters; the most dangerous snares to entrap all beautifull persons, and the onely places for Panders, Whore-masters, Whores and such like beastly Men monsters to catch their desired prey; in these lascivious dislikes ; which notably discry the intollerable mischiefes both of Playes and Theaters: Sed tu pr aecipue curvis venare Theatris. H aec loca sunt votis fertiliora tuis. Illic invenies quod ames, quod ludere possis; Quodque semel tangas, quodque tenere velis. Ut redit itque frequens longum formica per agmen Granifero solitum dum vehit ore cibum, &c. Sic ruit ad celebres cultissima f aemina ludos: Copia iudicium s aepe morata meum est. Spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur ut ips ae Ille locus casti damna pudoris habet. Primus sollicitos fecisti Romule ludos. Cum invit viduos rapta Sabina vires, &c. In gradibus sedit populus de cespite factis. Qualibet hirsutas fronde tegente comas. Respiciunt oculisque notant sibi quisque puellam, Quam velit: & tacito pectore multa movent Dumque rudem prabente modum tibicine Thusco, Lydius aequatam ter pede pulsat humum, &c. Protenus exiliunt, animum clamore fatentes, Virginibus cupidas inijciuntque manus, &c. Romule militibu scisti dare commoda solis, H aec mihi si dederis commoda, miles ero. Scilicet ex ille solemnia more Theatra, Nunc quoque formosis insidiosa manent. When he had thus, I say, discovered the lewdnesse of these Stage-playes, though to a lewde intent, and withall informed Lovers, that it was impossible for Parents, for Husbands, with all their care and industry to keepe their Wives or Children chaste, as long as there are so many Play-houses suffered in the Citty , in these foure verses: Quid faciet custos? cum sint tot in urbe Theatra: Cum spectet iunctos illa libenter equos: Cum sedeat Phari ae sacris operata invenca: Quoque sui comites ire vetantur eat. (A good caveat for Husbands, for Parents, to keepe their Wives, their Daughters from all Playes and Play-houses:) In his Booke De Remedio Amoris : he adviseth all those who would live chastly, and keepe under their unchaste desires; to withdraw themselves from Stage-playes: to cast away all Play- bookes, Playes, and amorous Poems, especially Tibullus, and his owne wanton Verses ; in these ensuing lines. At tanti tibi sit non indulgere Theatris, Dum bene de vacuo pectore cedat amor: Enervant animos cythar ae, cantusque lyraeque: Et vox & numeris brachia mota suis, Illic assidueficti saltantur amantes. Quid caveas, actor, quid invet arte docet. Eloquar invitus: teneros ne tange Poetas: Summoneo dotes impias esse meas. Callimachum fugito; non est inimicus amori: Et cum Callimacho tu quoqque Coe noces. Carmina quis potuit tut o legisse Tibulli? Vel tua cuius opus Cynthea sola fuit? Quis putuit lecto durus discedere Gallo? Et mea nescio quid carmina tale sonant, &c. And to shew his utter detestation of Playes and Play-houses, whose amorous lewdnesse be at large disciphers: he informes Augustus, that they are the Seminaries of all wickednesse: the frequent occasions of much sinne, much lewdnesse and adultery unto very many; the places of many adulterous meetings, and whorish contracts: whereupon he perswades Augustus, utterly to demolish all Play-houses and Theaters; to damne up all the portals and passages to them; and to suppresse all Stage-playes; that so these their pernicious fruits might be prevented . All which hee thus elegantly expresseth. Vt tamen hoc fateor: ludi quoque semina prabent Nequiti ae; tolli tota Theatra iubo Peccandi causam qu am multis saepe dederunt: Martia cum durum sternit arena solum? Tollatur Circus, non tuta licentia Circi est: H ic sedet ignoto iuncta puella viro. Cum qu aedam spatientur in hac ut amator eodem Conveniat: quare porticus ulla patet? Omnia perversas possunt corrumpere mentes. What could any Puritan (as our prophane Play-haunters stile them) have said more against Playes then this? and what can any Christian speake lesse against them, when as a prophane lascivious Heathen Poet hath written so much? If therefore we are loath to passe a censure upon Stage-playes, or to abandon Play-houses for feare we should be as good as Puritans; yet let us now at last renounce them, out of shame, lest we prove farre worse then Pagans, lest Horace , lest Iuvenal , and therefore-named Heathen Authors: lest wanton Ovid : or obscene Porpertius , (who thus cryes out of Theaters: O nimis exitis nata Theatra meo !) should bee more gracious, holy and precise then wee; whose holinesse should exceed even that of Scribes and Pharesies , much more then this of wanton Pagan Poets , which carried them no farther then to Hell ; what ever some old, some new Pelagians have dreamed to the contrary. To passe from Pagan Authors, to Heathen Magistrates, States and Emperors. The ancient Lacedemonians, excluded all Stage-playes out of Sparta, permitting neither Comidies nor Tragedies to be acted in it, lest their youth should be corrupted, their Lawes derided and brought into contempt. And when as an Embassador of Rhodes demanded of a Lacedemonian, what was the occasion of their lawes against Players and Iesters, since they shewed pleasure to the people, and the people lost nothing by it, but laughed at their folly. The Lacedemonian replied, that Lycurgus saw, heard or read of some great damage that Players and Iesters might doe in the Common-weale, since he had established so strait a Law against them. But this I know, that we Greekes are better weeping with our Sages, then the Romans laughing at their Fooles. The Athenians, though they much honoured Actors, Players, and Play-poets at the first; yet growing wiser by deare-bought experience at the last , when they had effeminated their mindes, exhausted their treasure, the sinnes of their Wars, and brought upon them sundry mischiefes; they abandoned all comicall Stage-playes as pernicious evils , enacting this publike law against them, that no man should from thence forth presume to pen or act a Comedy; and making common Actors thence-forth infamous . The very Heathens Massilienses , were so Puritanically rigid in this case, that they would upon no tearmes, no intreaties whatsoever, permit any Stage-playes to be acted within their Citty or Territories; for this very reason; lest the beholding of them should corrupt the mindes and manners of their Youth; and draw them on to commit these vices in earnest, which were acted before them but in iest. The ancient Pagan Romans, as they reputed all common Actors infamous (as the Civilians and our owne Statutes now esteeme them), disfranchising them their tribe as unworthy persons; and disabling them to inherite lands, to give any publike testimony betweene man and man, or to beare any honor, office or dignity in the Common weale , ( a very great evidence and acknowledgement of the evilnesse of Stage-playes, as Tertullian and others descant on it; since Players were thus branded with the note of infamy, even then when Playes themselves were in their first and best request;) even so they demolished all their Theaters, together with the Galleries built about them by a publike edict, lest the mindes and manners of the people should be effeminated and defloured by them, to the publike preiudice . Themistocles the famous Athenian Generall, enacted a Law, that no Magistrates should resort to Stage- playes, lest the Common-wealth it selfe should seeme to loyter and play in them , (Et utinam audiretur  a nostris ( writes Iohn Sarifbury) ut saltem in provectiori  aetate nugis suis republicae seria anteferrent:) and even before this law of his, it was an ancient custome in Athens, which was long observed, that not the least admittance into the Theater should be given unto any but such who should sing and utter honest things; lest the Magistrates and people there present should be made spectators of dishonest pastimes, which might draw them on to vice. Not to speake of the Gothes and other Barbarians, who censured and condemned Stage-playes as effeminate and ridiculous superfluities. Philippus Gluverius informes us out of Tacitus , (who writes thus of the German women. Ergo sept a pudicitia agunt, nullis spectaculorum illecebris, corruptae:) that the ancient Pagan Germanes knowing with what things the chastity of women was most corrupted among other Nations, did wholy abandon Stage-playes, with which they were unacquainted: of the corruption of which spectacles Seneca hath spoken most truely, That there is nothing so preiudiciall to good manners as to sit idly at a Play; for then vices creepe more easily upon us through pleasure. O Propheticall and Divine speech most worthy so great a Teacher of Wisedome! This verily writes this Heathen man, who was altogether ignorant of those divine Precepts which God by Moses and other Prophets hath delivered to his people. We therefore who have now given up our names to Christs discipline and warfare, with what face doe we now not onely excuse our Stage- playes, but like wise applaude, and voluntarily institute them? which verily are so much the lesse to be tollerated, by how much the more they exceed the measure of that old Heathenish modesty. For now vices doe not onely steale upon us through the pleasure of beholding: but they are as it were by force thrust into sincere and pure mindes, by examples, by voyce, by hand and action: so that I verily believe, there were never any inventors and Actors of Playes more corruptly licentious then ours now: But these things are rather forraigne, then our owne, for even now the Germanes wives are lesse solicited with Stage-playes then the wives of other Nations . The ancient and moderne Germanes then, by this Authors testimony, abandoned Stage-playes, as the very Seminaries of lewdnesse, the occasion of adultery, and the grand empoysoners, especially of all womens manners; which I would wish all husbands to observe. Scipio Nasica , that unparalleld Roman Generall, as sundry Authors testifie, did by a publike decree of the whole Senate demolish the Roman Theaters, and interdict their Stage-playes, as the very bane and ruine of the Romans manners, vertues, valour, and the like: as the Seminaries of all lewdnesse, effeminacy, idlenesse, vice and wickednesse; and the very overtures of the Commonweale: whose welfare was altogether inconsistent with lascivious Playes . Which worthy act of his, is much applauded by Livy, Tully , S. Augustine , and others here quoted in the margent. Trebonius Rufinus, banished all Iests and Stage-playes out of Vienna, over which he was Governour, as infectious to their manners: for which when as he was accused before the Romane Senate by some dissolute Male- contents, because he did it of his owne head, without any direction from the Senate ; Iunius Mauricus, a grave Roman Senator tooke part with him, and iustified this act of his, which he not onely much applauded, but wished openly withall, that all Stage-playes were likewise expelled out of Rome, as well as out of Vienna; For the vices of the Viennians (saith he) reside onely among themselves, but the Romanes wander farre abroad; and as in bodies, so in Empires, that disease is most grievous which is diffused from the head to the inferior members. Octavius the Nephew of Iulius C aesar, as Marcus Aurelius informes us, drove away all Stage-players and Iesters out of Rome, as insufferable mischiefes in the State . I read indeed in Suetonius , and Dion C aessius , that Octavius (whom we usually call Augustus C aesar) was at first very much delighted with Stage-playes, (the meanes perchance of making him an adulterer) in the beholding of which he spent much time, and now and then whole dayes together . I reade likewise, that he tooke away the power of punishing and suppressing Stage-players permitted to the Roman Magistrates at all times and places by the ancient law , (an infallible evidence that the ancient Roman lawes condemned Stage-playes and Actors;) yet so, as that he reserved the power of punishing Players, and reforming Stage-playes to himselfe ; by vertue of which power; he first of all inhibited all Roman Knights, Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen from acting or dancing on the Stage, prohibited likewise by a former law: Secondly, he commanded one Stephanio , (some call him Epiphanius,) an excellent Player and Iester (who upon a Holy- day to shew this Emperour some pleasure, and hoping to receive a good reward, went thrice unto his Palace: one time in the attire of a Page, and another time in the habite of a Romane Matron, and so truely counterfeited every thing, that it seemed not to be him, but the selfesame person he represented;) to be whipped publikely three severall times one after another about the Theater, and then to be banished for this fact of his. And when he complained that the Emperour commanded Vagabonds to be whipped but once, and he thrice : Augustus replyed: Once they shall whip thee for the iniury thou diddest to the Roman Matron whom thou representedst: The second time they shall whip thee for the presumption thou hadst, to act it in my presence. The third, for the time thou hast made divers lose for beholding and hearing thee. For Iesters and Players deserve not so much punishment for their Iests and Playes, as for the time which they lose, and cause others to lose . Thirdly, he commanded Hylas an eminent Stage-player, upon a complaint of the Pretor against him, to be publikely whipped in the Court of his Palace . Fourthly, he banished Pilades (some write him Pilas) another Actor out of Rome and Italy, after he had tasted of the Whipping-post, for pointing at a Spectator with his finger, who had hissed at him; and so had made him notorious. Which Pilas, being very popular, and making many friends to Augustus, that he might not be exiled , Augustus notwithstanding gave sentence of banishment against him, saying: That Rome hath beene mighty and puissant enough to make her enemies stoope, and now she is not able to banish Iesters and Fooles; and that which is worst of all, they have presumption to vex us, and we have not courage to reprove them . Lastly, he banished all the Players and Iesters out of Rome for those intolerable mischiefes they did occasion. And when as the people earnestly besought him to recall Pilas from his exile: he condiscended to their request with much adoe, upon this condition; that they should give a Master and Tutor to Pilas, that should chastise and correct him as a Foole: saying, That since Sages take Fooles to be their Masters, that Fooles also should have Sages for their Masters . All which is a sufficient evidence, that Augustus deemed Playes and Players, whom hee thus whipped and exiled, intolerable mischiefes in a State. Tiberius , none of the best Emperours, though he much delighted in Playes at first; yet at last by reason of those great mischiefes, outrages, misdemeanors, tumults, quarrels, murthers, seditions, that Playes and Players did occasion, after many ioynt complaints preferred against them both by the Senate and the Common-people; he was enforced to condemne all Players to the Whipping-post , (a punishment sutable to such unruly Rogues) and then, to banish them and their Stage-playes out of Italy, as insufferable evils in a Kingdome. Nero that vitious Roman Emperour, who was so much besotted with Stage-playes, as sometimes to play the Actor, to his eternall infamy: was at last enforced to expell all Stage-players out of Rome and Italy, together with their theatricall Enterludes, for those many unsufferable villanies and uprores that they did produce. Domitian also did the like upon the same occasion . Yea Iulian himselfe, that Atheisticall Antichristian Apostate , as impious as he was, had thus much goodnesse in him, as to prohibite Stage-playes: and therefore an Epistle to Arsatius, the Pagan High-priest of Galatia, he commands him to exhort all the Idol-priests under his Iurisdiction, that they should not be seene in Play-houses, nor resort to Theaters; endeavouring to draw the Pagans to imitate the very discipline and manners of the Christians; who inhibited both Minister and people to resort to Playes ; though now both Ministers and people flocke unto them, as if they were worse then Pagans. And if these very worst and dissolutest Heathen Roman Emperours exiled Playes and Players, as intolerable mischiefes and corruptions, what thinke yee did their better Pagan Successors doe? You shall heare a true relation what they did. The Roman Princes that were good (as Guevara, and others witnesse;) did alwayes cast out Playes and Stage-players, and those onely that were evill called them in. So that one of the tokens to know a vertuous or vitious Prince in Rome , write Guevara and I. G . (how much more then to know a religious vertuous Christian Prince and Magistrate?) was to see, whether he maintained Players, Iesters, and Iuglers among the people, yea or no ; which did so effeminate, vitiate and deboist both Magistrates, Prince and people too, as to precipitate them into all kindes of lewdnesse, sinne and wickednesse, and to prepare them both for invasions and destruction, as Ammianus Marcellinus. lib . 28. c . 9. 10. Augustin. De Civitate Dei. lib. i. c . 31. 32, 33. lib 2. c . 3. to 17\. Guevera, Dial of Princes. lib. 3\. c . 43. 44, 45, 46, 47. & Carolus Sigonius, De Occidentali Imperio. lib. 1\. pag . 32. most plentifully testifie. Hence that worthy Emperour Traian, though a Pagan, (who when he was intreated by his Courtiers to heare an active Player, made this most worthy reply , worthy all Christian Princes imitation: It is not for the Maiesty of a grave and vertuous Prince that in his presence any such vaine thing should be shewed; for in such a case himselfe should be no lesse noted of lightnesse, then the other of folly; and that before Princes no man should be so hardy as to utter dishonest words, or to act any light representations, and that those who move Princes to behold such Enterludes deserve as great a punishment as those that act them, since none ought to present before Princes things that may move them to vice, but such things as might move them to amendment:) partly out of his owne voluntary disposition, and partly upon the peoples owne request, abandoned all Stage- playes out of Rome, as effeminate arts, and unbeseeming exercises, which did much dishonour and corrupt the Roman State: which memorable act of his is thus emblazoned by C. Plinius Secundus , being then the Roman Consul, in his elegant Panegyricall Oration to him in the Senate House, in the name of al the Senators. Perge modo C aesar, & vim effectumque censurae tuum propositum, tui actus obtinebunt, &c. Et quis terror valuisset efficere quod reverentia tua effecit? Obtinuit aliquis ut spectaculum Pantomimorum populi Romani tolli pateretur; sed non obtinuit ut vellet: rogatus es tu quod rogebat alius, caeptique esse beneficium quod necessitas fuerat. Neque enim a te minore concentu ut tolleres Pantomimos, quam a patre tuo, ut restitueret, exactum est. Utrumque recte: nam & restitui oportebat, quod sustuler at malus princeps, & tolli restitutos. In his enim quae a malis benefiunt, hic tenendus est modus, ut apareat, autorem displicuisse, non factum. Idem ergo populus ille altquando scenici Imperatoris Spectator & applansor, nunc in Pantomis quoque adversatur, & damnat effaelig;minates artes, & indecora seculo studia. Ex quo manifestum est, principum disciplinam capere etiam vulgus; quum rem, si ab uno fiat, severissimam fecerint omnes. Macte hac gravitatis gloria Caesar, quae consecutus es, ut quod antea vis & Imperium, nunc mores vocarentur. Castigaverunt vitia sua ipsi qui castigari merebantur, ijdemque emendatores qui emendandi fuerunt . And a little after. Et quis i am locus misera adulationis manebat (speaking of Nero his times) qu um leudes Imperatorum ludis etiam & commessationibus celebrarentur saltarenturque atque in omen ludibrium effaeminatis vocibus, modis, gestibus frangerentur? Sed illud indignum, quod codem tempore in senatu & in scena ab histrione & a Consule laudabantur: tu procul a tui cultu ludicras artes removisti. Seria erge te carmina honorque aeternus annalium, non hac brevis & pudenda praedicatio colit: quinetiam tanto maiore consensu in venerationem tui Theatraipsa consurgent, quanto magis de te scen ae silebun:. A pregnant evidence how much this Emperour and the whole Roman Senate distasted Playes and Actors, as the very bane and ruine of the Common-weale. These Stage-playes creeping into Rome againe after this good Emperours decease, in the raigne of Antoninus Pius, qui amavit histrionum artes , as Iulius Capitolinus writes; Marcus Aurelius Antoninus , who succeeded him; that he might reduce the people to Philosophie and civility, tooke away the Gladiators and Players with him into the Warres, inhibiting all publike Playes and meetings under a severe edict both at Rome and Antioch: Which Edict of his taking no such good successe as he expected: hee thereupon banished all Stage-players, Tumblers and Iesters out of Italy, and sent three Ships landing of them to Lambert Governour of Hellespont; commanding him in his Letter directed to him, to keepe these laste Loyterers hard at worke, that they might no longer minde or practise their foolish Sports; certifying him withall in this his Letter; that the cause he had banished these Trewants and loytering Players from Rome, was not for the blood they had shed (for they had occasioned divers tumults in which many were slaine;) but for the hearts they had perverted: not for the occasion of any who were dead, but because they were Masters of follies to the living. For without comparision (writes he to Lambert) it is a greater offence to the gods, and more damage to the Common-weale for these Trewants to take away the wits from the wise folke, then for Murtherers to take away mens lives. Yea there is nothing that our Fore-fathers did, which displeaseth me so much as the sufferance of these unthrifty Trewants. In the yeere 264. of the foundation of Rome, in a time of an horrible pestilence in Italy, to reioyce the people was first found out the invention of Theaters by the advice of these Trewants. It is a shamefull thing to beare, that the pestilence dured but two yeeres, and the rage and folly of these unthrifts dureth foure hundred yeeres. Would to the immortall gods that the plague had ended these few which remaine, before this cursed generation had brought such abominable customes into Rome; for much better had it bene for our Mother Rome that she had wanted Inhabitants, then such Rascals should have come and dwelt therein. These Master-fooles have beene so wily to teach folly, and the Romane youth so apt to learne , that though they be put in Barkes, their disciples would lade 3000\. Carrackts. Rome was never overcome by those who were valient and vertuous, yet that day we saw it overgone & troden under foot by those fooles: the walls of Rome, that were never touched by the Paenians had that day their lowpes full of armed Trewants. Rome that triumphed over all Realmes, was trinmphed upon that day with Players and Iuglers. I am so abashed in this case, that I know not what to say or write. Yet one thing comforteth me, that sithe Rome and Romanes uniustly doe reioyce with these fooles, she and the famous Wisemen iustly shall be chastised for their fooles. And in this the gods shall not be dispeased; that sithe Rome laughed at these Trewands and mockeries, one day she shall weepe with these Tumblers and Iuglers, &c. Thus farre this Heathen Emperour, who both by his deeds and words, exterminated Playes and Players out of the Roman Territories, as the greatest contagions and corruptions of his Empire. Cornelius Tacitus records: That when as Pompie erected his standing Theater at Rome, he was accused and blamed for it by the Senators; because it would be a meanes to make the people sit whole dayes together idle in the Theator beholding Playes; and utterly overthrow their hereditary manners and discipline by new acquired lasciviousnesse : So that the whole Romane Senate then reputed Stage-playes pernicious to their State and manners. And for a conclusion of this tragicke Scene, Trebellius Pollio relates: that Martianus, Heraclianus, and Claudius, three worthy Romanes, conspired together to murther Gallienus the Emperour , (a man much besotted and taken up with playes, to which he likewise drew the Magistrates and people by his lewde example,) as Flavius and others conspired Nero his murther too for the selfesame cause, lest the Comon-weale being longer addicted to he Cirque and Theater should utterly perish through the allurements of pleasures: which murther they accomplished. All these recited Authorities of Pagan Writers, Emperours, States and Magistrates, together with Ammianus Marcellinus , a famous Heathen Historian; who reckons up the unworthy approbation of Cirque- playes, and Stage playes, in which the people spent their lives and time, as the very greatest corruption of the Roman State, and the chiefest character of their depraved manners: against which Playes, and their Spectator, he hath much inveighed: (which me thinke should for ever shame and silence all such gracelesse Christains, who dare to plead for Stage- playes, giving out, that none but some few foolish Puritans did ever yet condemne them:) infallibly evidence unto all mens consciences; that Stage- playes desperately vitiate and deprave mens mindes and manners, precipitating them into all vice, all wickednesse and lewdnesse whatsover; and that they are unsufferable contaminating pernicious plagues in any Well-ordered State; which caused these very Pagan Emperors, States and Magistrates thus solemnely to exile them; and these their Authors to declaime against them. To passe from these to Christians; wee shall finde both Christian Princes, Republikes, Authors, of ancient and moderne times, concurring with these former Pagans in these their doomes of Playes and Actors. It is storied by Iosephus; that when as Kind Herod would have brought Stage-playes, Cirque- playes, and other Spectacles into Hierusalem, where he had erected a beautifull Theather, and Amphitheater, adorned with C aesars Titles and Inscriptions; the whole Nation of the lewes, (though Forraigne Spectators much admired and delighted in his spectacles) perceiving that these Playes did wholy tend to the dissolution of their ancient received Country discipline; and fearing that some great inconvenience to their Common-wealth would follow upon this alteration; thought it their duty to maintaine thair publike discipline which was now declining, though it were with the hazard of their lives; and not to suffer Herod to proceed with these his Spectacles, shutting up their City Gates against them. which when Herod perceived, he began to pacifie and perswade them with good words, to admit of these his Playes; which prevayling nothing with many, he endeavoured to introduce these Playes among them perforce: whereupon ten of the Iewes conspired together to murther him whiles he was sitting in the Theater beholding these his Enterludes; which they had certainely effected, had not this their conspiracy bene casually detected: Of which Herod taking advantage, accomplished his desire, and so brought these his Theatricall Enterludes into Hierusalem: by meanes whereof , saith Iosephus (pray marke the dangerous consequence) the Iewes departed more and more from their Country rites, and corrupted the inviolable Institutions of their Ancestors with forraigne inventions and delights; so that there was a very great declining and degenerating of their good manners into worse: the discipline decaying whereby the people were wont before this time to be kept in order. Such vigorous venome was there in these Stage- playes, both to subvert their State, and discipline, and corrupt their manners; the whole Nation of the Iewes being thus both reall witnesses and examples to confirme my Minors truth, whom I have here ranked among Christians, as being then opposite unto Pagans: I now come to reall Christians. It is storied of Constantine the Great , that very first and most famous Christian Romane Emperour, (whose name we English men have speciall cause to honour, he being borne, bred, and first crowned King and Emperour here in England, his Mother Helena being a Brittish woman to:) That he wholy with-drew himselfe from the Secular Stage- playes of the Gentiles made in the third yeere of his Consulship, to drive away plagues and diseases: contemning and reiecting these their Enterludes; at which these Pagan Gentiles grieved much: After which being established in his Empire, he did by publike Edicts abolish all the ceremonies, rites, lascivious customes and abscenities of the Gentiles, and interdicted all gladiatory Playes and Enterludes, as intolerable pernicious evils . Not to speake of Nerva , Constantius , Valentinian , Honorius , Arcadius, and others, who banished and prohibited all Sword playes , against which divers Fathers did declaime as barbarous and unchristian Spectacles, not tolerable in any civil State : with which our tumultuous bloody Tragedies have too neere affinity; I finde Theodosius the Great , (who banished all Women dancers, Players, and Singers by a publike Edict, as the plagues of those places and Citties where they were tolerated:) not onely suppressing and inhibiting all Stage-playes and Cirque-playes at Antioch, and stopping up all Cirques and Theaters, as the fountaines of all wickednesse, and the Nurseries of all those mischiefes that sprung up in Citties , as Chrysostome at large relates: and I likewise finde both him, Valentinian and Gratian, together with Valens the Emperour , enacting these publike lawes against Stage-playes and common Actors, well worthy observation: That no Stage-playes should be acted on the Lords-day; that Stage-players and Women-actors should be quite debarred from the Sacraments as long as they continued in their playing, and that the Sacrament should not be administred to them in their extremity, when as they lay upon their death-beds, though they desired it, unlesse they did first renounce their wicked lewde profession, and protest solemnely that they would not returne unto it againe in case they should recover . Such was their detestation against common Actors, and so by consequence against Playes themselves, which made their Actors so base, so execrable, to these Christian Emperours. Iustinian the Emperour , promulgated this pious Edict; That all sorts of Clergie men, together with all other Christians, should refraine, not onely from Dice play, and Dicers company, but likewise from the very acting and beholding of Stage playes and Theatricall Spectacles, because they are not the least part of those pompes of the Devil which Christians solemnely renounce when they are baptized. Leo and Anthemius , two worthy Christian Emperours, made this most pious Edict. All Feast-dayes, or Holy dayes dedicated to the most high God, shall not be taken up or solemnized with any pastimes or excursions. We therefore decree the Lords-day to be alwayes so honourable and venerable, that it shall be exempted from all Executions, Admonitions, Bayles, Appearances, Arrests, Law- suites, and Controversies, which shall all then cease; Let all Advocates and Criers then be silent, let there be then a kinde of truce for a space, that so Adversaries may safely meete together upon it, without feare, and reconcile themselves one to the other, &c. Neither releasing the imployments of this religious Day doe we permit any one to be occupied in obscene pleasures. Let not the Theatricall Scene, nor the Cirque Combate, or the dolefull Spectacles of wilde Beasts, claime any liberty to themselves on this day: and if any solemnity to be celebrated, either in respect of our coronation or nativity, shall chance to happen upon it, let it be put off to some other time. If any person shall ever hereafter presume to be present at Stage-playes on this Holy-day or if the Apparitor of any Iudge under pretext of any publike or private businesse shall violate those things which are decreed by this law, he shall undergoe the losse of his office, and the sequestration of his Patrimony . O that this godly Law were now in force with Christians! then Playes and Pastimes on Lords-day evenings, would not be so frequent; then those who had served God at Prayers, and Sermons in the day time, would not so seriously serve the world, the flesh, the Devill, in Dancing, Dicing, Masques, and Stage-playes in the night, beginning perchance the Lords-day ( like the foolish Galathians) in the spirit, but ending it in the flesh , as alas too many carnall Christians doe. Theodoricus , a Christian King of Italy, (whose prayses Ennodius Ticinensis , hath proclaimed to the world) in his Epistle to Faustus , transmitted to posterity, by Marcus Aurelius Cassiodorus , hath passed this Censure upon Stage-playes , and Cirque-playes : that they expell the gravest manners, invite the most triviall contentions; that they are the exhausters of honesty, the ever-running fountaine of brawles and quarrels; which antiquity verily reputed sacred, but contentious posterity hath made them a meere ludibrium. Which passage he thus seconds in his Epistle to Speciosius. Who can expect grave manners in Stage-playes? Catoes know not how to meete together at Play- houses. Whatsoever is there spoken to the reioycing people is not deemed an injury. It is a place which defends excesse . In another Epistle of his to the Roman Senate , he thus informes them, what great mischiefes these Stage-playes had procured to the people, who were brought into extreme dangers by them. Animum nostrum. Patres Conscripti, Reipub. curis calentem, pulsavit sapius querela populorum, orta quidem ex causis levibus, sed graves eructavit excessus. Deplorat enim pro spectaculorum voluptate ad discrimina se ultima pervenisse, &c. And in his Epistle to Maximus, of the divers sorts of Spectacles, which the Consuls exhibited to the people out of a preposterous custome, to their great expence; (against the severall wickednesses of which Enterludes hee there much declaimes) he closeth up that Epistle with this patheticall Epilogue. Hen mundi error dolendus: si esset ullus aequitatis intuitus, tantae & divitae pro vita mortalium deberent dari, quantae in mortes hominum videntur effundi. Such was his Royall Censure of these pestiferous Stage-playes, which bred so many mischiefes and discords in the world. It is registred of Henri, the third Emperour of that name, whom they stiled blacke and godly; that when as a great company of Stage-players and Actors flocked together to Ingelheim to his marriage, about the yeere 1044\. he thrust them all out of the Court and Citty; and commanded that the money which should have beene spent in maintaining, rewarding, and adorning them, should be distributed among the poore; An example (writes Master Gualther , who relates it) truely worthy of eternall prayse; which if Princes and Magistrates of Common-weales would this day imitate, there would be lesse place left to filthy and sloathfull idlenesse, then which there is nothing more powerfull to corrupt mens manners; yea wise and prudent men would be then in greater request, and the poore would be better provided for, who now wander about in every corner to the great scandall of Christianity ; It is storied of Philip Augustus, the 42\. King of France; that he being an enemy to publike dissolutions, and a friend to good order and iustice, enacted publike lawes against Players, Iuglers, Playes, and Dicing-houses, which he wholy suppressed, as pernicious to his Kingdome; banishing all Stage-players out of France by a publike Edict : the true grounds of which worthy act of his Vincentius in his Speculum Historiale , doth thus expresse. Cum autem in Curijs regum vel principum frequens histrionum turba convenire solebat, ut ab eis aurum & argentum, & equos seu vestes, quas saepe principes mutare solent verba ioculator a varijs adulationibus plena proferendo ab eis extorqueant: videns Rex Philippus haeic esse vana, & animae saluti contraria, mente promptissima Deo promisis; quod omnes vestes suas quamdiit viveret intu[illeg.] Dei pauperibus erogaret; malens nudum Christum in pauperibus vestire; quam adulatoribus vestes dando peccatum incurrere ; quoniam histrio[illeg.]bus dare (and I would those who spend their money at Play-houses would well consider it) est D aemonibus imolare. Hoc si quotiaie principes attenderent, nequaquam tot leccatores per mundum discurrerent. Vidimus autem principes quosdam vestes diu excogitatas, & varijs florum picturationibus artificiosissime elaboratas vix evolutis septem diebus, proh dolor, histrionibus, scilicet, Diaboli ministris (so hee stiles them) ad primam vocem dedisse, pro quibus forsan , 20. aut 30\. vel 40\. marcas argenti impenderent, de quo nimirum precio totidem pauperes per totum annum victus necessaria percipere potuissent , By all these severall Acts and Testimonies of these worthy Christian Princes, it is most apparant; that Stage-playes insufferably corrupt mens mindes and manners, and that they are no wayes tolerable in a Christian State. The selfesame verity wee shall finde confirmed by the Fathers. Hence Clemens Alexandrinus , stiles Playes and Play-houses; the very Chaire of Pestilence, which corrupts mens mindes . Hence Tertullian records; that the Roman censors oft-times demolish their re-erected Theaters to prevent the corruption of the peoples manners, which they fore-saw would be much indangered and corrupted by the lasciviousnesse of State-playes; the lewde effects of which hee at large discovers, stiling the State, the very Chairre of Pestilence, and the Gallorie of the enemies of Christ. Hence Cyprian phraseth Stage-playes Masters not of teaching but of corrupting, of destroying Youth: and Play- houses, the very Brothels of publike chastity; where all vices are both taught and learned; all modesty exiled, all continency wrecked, mens soules and manners most incurably corrupted to Gods dishonor and the Churches shame . Hence Lactantius informes us; that the very hearing and beholding of Stage- playes exceedingly corrupt all Youth; by depraving their manners, enraging their unruly lusts, and teaching them to commit adulteries, whiles they behold them acted: Whereupon he peremptorily concludes; that all Stage-playes are wholy to be abandoned, that so not onely no vices might harbour in our brests, but that the custome of no pleasure might ever overcome us, and so turne us away from God and from good workes . Hence Gregory Nazianzen avers; that Stage-playes ought to be reputed nothing else but the very plague and sicknesse of mens mindes ; the severall ill effects of which he there reckons up at large, and thereupon he thus concludes; Wherefore it evidently appeares, that these Stage-playes are nought else but the very destruction of mens soules : which Censure of his is fully ratified by the concurrent suffrages of Tatianus, Oratio Advers.

Saint Chrysostome is exceeding copious in this Theame, as is evident by all his transcribed passages in the preceding Scene. (See here, page 401. 402. 404. 405\. 406. 415. 416. 424. 431. whence hee stiles the Play-house; the Caireof Pestilence; the Shop of Luxury; the Scaffold of Incontinency; the publike Schoole of Lewdnesse: a Babilonish Brothell full of many filthy noysome diseases, which depraves, depopulates, not the nature of the body, but the good habitude of the soule , which over-turnes all lawes, all modesty, vertue, discipline , and brings many great mischiefes unto Citties Whereupon he thus concludes; that Magistrates by overthrowing Play-houses shall overturne all iniquity, and utterly extinguish all the plagues, the mischiefes of the State and Citty . Saint Augustine , as he informes us in expresse tearmes: That if there had beene none but good and honest men in the Citty of Rome, that they would never have admitted Stage-playes to have any existence among humane things, much lesse in Divine affaires: so he proves at large out of Heathen Authors, that Stage-playes are most unsufferable contagions and mischiefes in a State, vitiating the mindes, subverting the manners, the discipline of those places where they are but tolerated . Among other passages to this purpose, he affirmes: That the Roman vertue was altogether unacquainted with these Theatricall arts almost 400. yeeres: which albeit they were sought after to delight the voluptuousnesse of mens lusts, and crept in onely by reason of the corruption of mens manners, yet the Idol Heathen gods desired that they might be dedicated unto them . And then speaking of the first occasion of bringing Stage-playes into Rome, to asswage the pestilence which afflicted their bodies, they brought in (saith he) another farre more grievous and perpetuall pestilence of their mindes , which he thus elegantly expresseth. Dij propter sedandam corporis pestilentiam ludos sibi seenieos exhiberi iubebant, pontifex autem vester (Scipio) propter animorum cavendam pestilentiam, ipsam scenam construi prohibibat. Si aliqua luce mentis animum corpori pr aeponitis, eligere quem colatis? Neque enim & illa corporum pestilentia ideo conquievit, quiae populo bellicoso, & solis antea ludis Circensibus assueto, ludorum scenicorum delicata subintravit insania: sed astutia spirituum nefandorum praevidens illam pestilentiam iam fine debito cessaturam, aliam longe graviorem, qua plurimum gaudet, ex hac occasione, non corporibus, sed moribus curavit immittere: quae animos miserorum tantis occoecavit tenebris, tanta deformitate faedavit, ut etiam modo quod incredibile forsitan erit, si a nostris posteris audietur, Romana urbe vastata, quos pestilentia ista possedit, atque inde fugientes, Carthaginem pervenire potuerunt, in Theatris quotidie certati[illeg.] pro histrionibus insanirent. Amentes, amentes, quis est hic tantus, non error, sed furor ut exitium vestrum plangentibus Orientalibus populis, & maximis Civitatibus in remotissimis terris, publicum luctum maeroremque ducentibus, vos Theatra quaereretis, intraretis, impleretis, & multo insaniora quam fuerant antea faceretis. Hanc animarum labem ac pestem, hanc probitatis & honestatis eversionem (so he truely stiles the Theater) Scipio ille meiuebat, quand o construi Theatra prohibebat, &c. neque exim censebat ille faelicem esse rempub. stantibus maenibus ruentibus moribus: sed in vobis plus valuit quod impij Daemomes seduxerunt, quam quod homines providi praecaverunt, &c. It is evident then by Saint Augustines resolution: that Stage-playes incurably vitiate and desperately corrupt, if not subvert mens manners; and so bring ruine to that State that suffers them, the evils which they ingenerate in the peoples manners, being farre worse then the cruellest enemies . Hence he informes us; that Stage-playes had made Rome, which was gotten with the care, and augmented by the industry of their Ancesters, more filthy whiles it was standing, then when it was falling unto ruine: since in its ruine, onely the stones and timber, but in the lives of Play-haunters, all the monuments and ornaments not of walls, but of manners were fallen to the ground; since their hearts burned with more lamentable polluting lusts, then the houses of the Citty did with flames . Yea hence he concludes and proves, the Fagan Deities of the Romanes to be no gods but beastly devils, and uncleane infernall spirits; who were no friends no advancers, no protectors of the Romanes or of their Common weale, but professed enemies, plagues, and traitors to them both, because they invented, exacted, countenanced, and delighted in those obscene, lascivious, vitious Stage-playes, which defiled the mindes, corrupted the lives, ruinated the manners,and eternally destroyed the soules of men, by precipitating them into all vice and lewdnesse whatsoever: which Playes both Plato, Scipio, Cicero, and the ancient Romanes quite abandoned, as the very Pests, the Cankers, bane and overthrow of the Common-weale . Such they, such he reputed them; and from thence he perswades the Romanes to discarde them together with all their Devill-Idols who tooke such pleasure in them. Paulus Orsius , Saint Augustines intire friend and Coetanean in his excellent History (dedicated to this learned Father,) relating the originall introduction of Stage-playes among the Romanes, to asswage the plague; thus discants on that passage. Autores suas ere pontifices, ut ludi scenici dijs expetentibus aederentur: & ita pro depellenda temporali peste corporum accersitus est perpetuus morbus animarum : these Stage-playes being no other in his opinion, but a perpetuall sicknesse of mens soules, far worse then any pestilence that could afflict their bodies : What State, what person then would foment such fatall plagues? Salvian, Bishop of Massilia in France, most elegantly inveigheth against the horrid obscenity of Stage-playes, informing the ancient Romanes and others , that Stage-playes were those insufferable impurities which polluted their soules, depraved their manners, provoked the Maiesty of their God to wrath, offended their blessed Saviour, dishonoured their Christian profession, and drew downe Gods Iudgements on their State, which was then miserablie wasted by the Goathes and Vandals: and thereupon he adviseth them, eternally to abandon Playes and Theaters (according to their vow in baptisme) as the most pernicious evils, which would bring their soules, their bodies, their Church and State to utter ruine. Isiodor Pelusiota , who flourished about the yeere of our Lord 440. in his Epistle to Hiero , who then swayed the Common-wealth under Theodosius the Yonger, writes thus of Stage-players; that this is their chiefe end and study, not that many should be made better by their scoffes, (as some have said, deceiving both themselves, and these that heare them,) but that many might be drawne to sinne. For their felicity is wholy placed in the lewdnesse of their Spectators. For so it is that if their Spectators should be made better, their very occupation would goe to wracke: wherefore they never so much as thinke of reforming any who offend, neither if they willed it, could they effect it. For their mimicall art of its owne nature is onely fitted for to hurt men . A passage, which not onely answers that vaine Obiection of play-patrons (which you see was ancient) that Stage-playes reforme men by reprehending vice : but likewise manifests them to be intolerable mischiefes in any Christian State, since their very end and nature is onely to corrupt and make men worse. Aurelius Cassiodorus, describing the office of the Romane Censor, or Surveyer of sports, records; that the dissolute lives, and light arts of Stage-players are remote from honest manners; and that therefore antiquity becomming a Moderator, did take care to suppresse their insolencies by appointing Censors to correct and punish them, thus so they might not wholy lash out, when as they should undergoe the censure of a Iudge. For the very exhibition of pleasures is to be administred under a certaine discipline. If not a true, yet at leastwise let a shadowed order of iustice keepe Stage- playes with in compasse. Let even these businesses be tempered with the qualification of lawes, that so honesty may rule over dishonest persons, and they may live under certaine rules who know not the way of a right conversation: For those Players seeke not so much their owne pleasure as other mens myrth, and by a perverse condition, when as they deliver the dominion their bodies, they have compelled their soules to serve. It is fit therefore that those should receive a Moderator, who know not to carry themselves with a legall moderation. For the office of a Censor is set up as a Tutor over these heards of men. For as Tutors keepe children of tender yeeres with diligent care, so vehement pleasures are to be curbed by the Censor, with great grauity, &c . Which passage, as it proves Stage-playes, intolerable mischiefes; and Players, disorderly dissolute wicked person, whose excesses need to be suppressed, even by the opinion of the ancient Pagan Romanes, who apointed Censors of purpose to correct their grosse abuses , which yet could never be redressed : so it condemnes the excessive lewdnesse of our moderne Playes and Actors which have no such Surveyers to curbe, to censure their abuse;  & withall acquaints us, how pernicious Stage-playes are, both to mens manners & the publike weale: and what reason Christians have for ever to abandon them; since the very worst of Pagans, had long since wholy discarded them, for their unsufferable corruptions and abuses, but to please their Idols, to whom they were devoted ; which reason holds not with us Christins, but ingageth us most against them. To passe by Iohn Saresbury , Alexander Fabritius , Holket , Paulus Wan , Maphens Vegins , Nicolaus De Clemangis , Thomas Bradwardine , petrarcha , and other more ancient writers, who censure Stage-Playes; as the intolerable depravers of mens mindes and manners; the Seminaries of all wickednesse, vice, and lewdnesse; the corrupters of Youth, the subverters of all good discipline; the enemies of all vertuous education; and insufferable mischiefes in a State, which thorow the eyes and eares usher eternall death into mens soules : To whom I might accumulate; Ludovicus Vives , Astexanus , Cornelius Agrippa , Peter Primauday , Dan aeus , Peter Martyr , Ioannes Langhecrucius , Bochellus , leannes Mariana , Barnabas Brissonius , C aesar Bulengerus , Baronius , Spondanus , The Centuriators , with sundry other forraigne Authors hereafter quoted ; who fully suffragate to this their Censure. I shall onely recite the words of 4. other moderne Outlandish Authors against the intolerable abuses of Stage- playes, and then passe unto our English Writers: The first of these, is Master Ralph Gualther , a reverend orthodox Divine, whose laborious learned Workes all Protestant Churches highly honor: who acquaints us: That Stage-Players, the artificers, the ministers of unlawfull pleasures, who are wont to frequent the Courts of great Princes, and the eminentest richest Citties where there is most hope of gaine propounded to them, are not a small plague of Common-weales for they are the servitors of lust, they corrupt good manners they bring all religion into contempt: they greatly exhaust both the publike and mens private treasure, and that which ought to be distributed for the poores reliefe, they by their arts have almost intercepted. These the Prophet compares to Locusts, not onely for their multitude, but rather for their idle sloathfulnesse, and because being borne onely for to eate and drinke, they doe nothing in the meane time that is honest, or which may any way advance the publike good. Wherefore grave men in all ages have thought fit to exclude this sort of men from the Commonwealth. This Plato a man of most acute iudgement perceived when as he banished all Poets out of his Common- wealth, because he knew they would both corrupt mens manners, and bring the gods into contempt. Neither undeservedly is the old discipline of the Massilienses applauded, who would admit no Stage-players into their Citty, nor any persons but such who were skilfull in some art or other, wherby they might honestly maintaine themselves. To which this also may be added, that the ancient Divines most sharpely condemne both Stage-playes and Spectacles: having a respect to that of the Apostle , who would not have fornication, filthy discourse, scurrility or any uncleanesse, so much as to be once named among Christians: commanding all the followers of Christ, not to absteine from evill onely, but likewise from all appearance of it. It is therefore a great signe of corrupt and perverted discipline, that these effeminate persons and furtherers of most dishonest pleasures, are in great esteeme both in the Courts of Princes & in rich Citties, whiles grave men who excell in councell and experience are in the meane time excluded and contemned, and the poore neglected, &c. Then he recites the examples of Licinius, and Henry the 3. Emperor of that name, who cast all Stage-players out of their Courts and Citties, as the very Rats and Moathes of the Court and Common-weale. Examples (writes he) worthy of eternall prayse, which if Princes and Magistrates of the Common-weale would imitate at this day, there would be lesse rome left for filthy sloathfull idlenesse, then which there is nothing more powerfull to corrupt mens manners: yea wise and prudent men would be in more esteeme, and the poore would be better provided for, who now wander up and downe in every corner, to the great scandall of Christianity. But because all here neglect their duty, God himselfe will at one time or other finde out a meanes whereby he will cast out these plagues (so stiles he Playes and Players) not without some publike calamity, as the Prophet here threatens to the Ninivites . Thus hee. The second is Petrus Opmeerus , a grave Historian, who writes thus of Playes. The ancient Romanes did waste too much upon Pleasures and Spectacles, of which they had foure sorts: Stage-playes which served to delight their eares: Cirque-playes, Gladiators, and Huntings, which served for their eyes: From the first of these, they learned filthinesse and lewdnesse: from the latter, cruelty and inhumanity. Neither did any one bring backe those manners from these Spectacles that he brought thither; for a certaine rust and canker did spread it selfe over them at unawares. Neither doe vices more easily or speedily corrupt mens mindes then by these pleasures . The third is Didacus de Tapia , a famous Spanish Hermite; who discussing this question; Whether the Sacrament might be given to Stage-players ? writes thus. The ancient Fathers inveigh so bitterly against this pernicious kinde of men, and the holy Canons punish them so severely by Ecclesiasticall censures, that I suspect that those things which were acted in Theaters heretofore, were filthier then those things that are acted now. But let this be as it will, yet the things that are played now are lascivious, filthy, and obscene, and very pernicious to Christian Religion. And therefore whosoever tasts any sweetnesse in the Lord, or is any whit wise towards God, is bound to repute them publike sinners, and so much the more grivous plague of the Common-weale, by how much the wound of the soule is greater then that of the body. The Councell of Carthage , Saint Cyprian, Chrysostome , and Augustine (whose words he there recites at large) excommunicate them both from the Society of the Faithfull, and the Sacraments as the very infamy, plagues, and blemish of the Church, which could not tolerate them without much infamy and dishonour; since the very Pagan Romanes disfranchised them their tribes, and made them infamous. And if these Stage-players are reputed infamous among Heathens, and deprived of all honour, as Saint Augustine most truely affirmeth . De Civitate Dei. lib. 1. cap. 31. what ought we Christians now to doe? Verily we ought to eschue and condemne both in Playes and sports, what ever is profuse, what ever is immodest, what ever is unseemely, what ever is wanton, what ever is wicked; all which even Tully himselfe condemned in his Offices. But all these things are found in Play- houses: But if that Stage-players delight men with their pleasures, iests, and wily speaches, and with the sweetnesse of their songs, and musicke; or if they adorne and instruct men with their grave Sentences, and please them with the representation of ancient things, or with their passions ; (A common objection in the behalfe of Stage-playes;) would to God they had never mixed these good things with their Comedies: For this onely happens because evill is so weake and miserable by it selfe, that it cannot defend and helpe it selfe, unlesse it be holpen and assisted by good: For evill, if it be perfect, destroyeth it selfe, as Aristotle saith; and therefore it is hid under the shew of good, that it may deteine and deceive incautelous men: for by nature we are vehemently prone to honesty. But albeit some good things are mingled in these Playes, yet we alwayes ought to have these excellent words of Hierom before our eyes, in his Epistle to L aeta. No Man (saith he) sendeth his Daughter to the Stewes, although some Women may there be found bewayling their filthy corruption: no man commits his Heire to a company of Theeves, that he may learne audacity; no man enters into a Boate that is full of holes, that he may learne to avoyd shipwracke. No man therefore ought to goe to the impure and infamous place of the Theater which is contrary to religion, to modesty and sobriety, (a place so familiar to Devils, and so odious to God,) that he may learne or tast the things there acted: for they are intermixed with poyson . Such is the venome, the contagion of Players and Play-haunters, in this Popish Hermites judgement, whose words no Papist (and I presume no Protestant) dares to question. The fourth is Iohn Bodine , an eminent Polititian, and renowned Statesman, who hath passed this verdict upon Stage-playes. I will (writes he) passe over in silence the abuses which are committed in suffring of Comedies and Enterludes, the which (pray marke it) is a most pernicious plague to a Common-weale: for there is nothing doth more corrupt the Citizens good manners, simplicity and naturall bounty then Stage-playes: the which have the more power and effect, for that their words, accents, gesture, motions and actions, governed with all the art that may be, and of a most filthy and dishonest subiect, leaves a lively impression in their soules who apply thereunto even all their sences. To conclude we may well say, that the Comedians Stage is an apprentiship of all impudency, loosenesse, whoredome, cozening, deceit and wickednesse. And therefore Aristotle doth not with out cause say, That they must have a care lest the subiects went to Comedies : he had said better, that they should have pulled downe their Theaters, and shut the Comedians out of the Citty gates. For saith Seneca, there is nothing more contrary to good manners, then to haunt Playes. And therefore Philip Augustus King of France, did by a publike Edict, banish all Players out of his Realme. If any one will say, that both Greekes and Romanes did allow of Playes: I answer, that it was for a superstition they had unto their gods: but the wisest have alwayes blamed them. For although a Tragedy hath something in it more stately and heroike, and which doth make the hearts of men lesse effeminate: yet Solon having seene the Tragedy of Thespis played, did much mislike it; and whereas Thespis excusing himselfe, said, it was but a Play: No (replyed Solon) but this Play turnes to earnest. Much more had he blamed Comedies, which were then unknowne: and now alwayes they put at the end of every Tragedy (as poyson into meate) a Comedy or Iigge. And although that Comedies were more tolerable among those that dwell in the Southerne parts, being more heavy and melancholy by nature, and for their naturall constancy lesse subiect to change, yet should they be utterly denyed to those that live toward the North, being of a sanguine complexion, light and inconstant; having in a manner all the force of their soule in the common and brutall sence: But there it no hope to see Playes forbidden by the Magistrates, for commonly they are the first at them . Thus farre these Forraigners. To passe by Carolus Sigonius, who enumerates the frequenting, tolerating, and countenancing of Stage-playes both by Prince and people, as the inevitable forerunner, and chiefe occasion both of the destruction and overthrow of the Roman Empire, by the Gothes and Vandals : and Guevara , his Dial of Princes. l. 3. c . 43. to 48\. I come now to our own domestique Playes, to see what our Writers, our Divines, in their daily Sermons; what our Vniversities, Magistrates, and our whole State have determined of them, in confirmation of my Minors truth. For our Writers. To passe by those of more ancient times, as Beda, Anselme, Alexander Fabritius, Holkot, Bradwardin, Ioannis de Burgo, Alexander de Ales, Edmundus Caniuariensis, Ioannis Saresberiensis, Petrus Blesensis, Mathew Paris, Polychronicon, Ludovicus Vives, Thomas Waldensfis , and others hereafter quoted, who all condemne these Stage-playes as intolerable corruptions. Master Northbrooke , an eminent learned Divine, in his excellent Treatise against Vaine Playes and Enterludes , Imprinted by Authority, London 1579, writes thus of Stage-playes. To speake my minde and conscience plainely and in the feare of God, I say, that Players and Playes are not tolerable nor sufferable in any Common-weale, especially where the Gospell is preached ; (which he there proves at large by sundry testimonies of Fathers, Councels, moderne Divines, and others; and by many arguments,) because they are the occasions of much sinne and wickednesse, corrupting both the mindes and manners of their Actors and Spectators . The Author of the third Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters, (once a Playerly Play-poet himselfe, till being pricked in conscience for it, he renounced his profession ) delivers his experimentall resolution of Stage-playes in these very tearmes. Such doubtlesse is mine opinion of common Playes, that in a Common-weale they are not sufferable. My reason is, because they are publike enemies to vertue and religion, allurements to sinne, corrupters of good manners, meere Brothel houses of Bawdery, and bring both the Gospell into slander, the Sabbath into contempt, mens soules into danger, and finally the whole Common-weale into disorder : all which particulars hee there confirmes at large. The title of which Booke is very observable: viz. A second and third Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters: the one whereof was sounded by a reverend Bishop, dead long since; the other by a worshipfull and zealous Gentleman now alive: one shewing the filthinesse of Playes in times past; the other the abomination of Theaters in the time present: both expresly proving, that that Common-weale is nigh unto the curse of God, wherein either Players be made of, or Theaters maintained: Set forth and allowed by Authority. Anno 1580\. A pregnant Authorized evidence of my Minors truth. Master Stephen Gosson , another great Play-poet before his conversion, (for which he afterwards shed many a bitter teare ;) in his Schoole of Abuse; containing a pleasant invective against Poets, Pipers, Players, Iesters, and such like Caterpillers of a Common-wealth, setting up a Flagge of Defiance against their mischeivous exercise, and overthrowing their Bulwarkes by Prophane Writers, Naturall Reason, and Common Experience; printed by Allowance, and Dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney. Anno 1578\. And in his Playes Confuted , Dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham ; which Booke is thus intituled: Playes Confuted in five Actions: Proving that they are not to be suffred in a Christian Common-weale, &c . Imprinted at London, about the yeere 1581. doth positively affirme, and copiously demonstrate upon unanswerable grounds; That Stage-playes and common Actors are no wayes tolerable in any Christian, or Well-governed Common-weale; because they occasion much wickednesse, lewdnesse, and disorder, and exceedingly corrupt the mindes, the manners both of their Auditors and Spectators : as the Perusers of these Tractates shall more at large discerne.

That our godly Divines in their zealous daily Sermons, have likewise declaimed against Stage-playes, both in former and latter times, as these our Writers doe, it is evident, not onely by our owne daily experience; (there being not one godly faithfull Minister where these Play houses, Playes and Players are admitted, but hath oft cryed out against them in the Pulpit, as the very Schooles, the Tutors of Bawdery and Abuse; The nests of the Devill; the chaire of pestilence, the sinkes of all sin, the pompes and soveraigne places of Satan; the poyson of mens soules and manners, the plagues and overtures of the Commonwealth, &c .) but by the testimony of the Prefacer to the 2\. and 3\. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters. Anno 1580\. who informes us; that in his time many godly Preachers day by day, in all places of greatest resort, did denounce the vengeance of God to those, be they high or low, that favoured Playes, Theaters, or Players. That in all ages the most excellent men for learning have condemned them by the force of eloquence and power of Gods Word: and that many in the principall places of this Land have, and daily, yea openly doe speake against Playes, Players, and Theaters; as neither warranted by Gods Word, nor liked of Christians, but disallowed utterly , by Scripture, by reason, by Doctors, by Bishops, by their very Authors themselves, yea and by all other good man, as the enemies to godlinesse, the corruption of the wel-disposed: and so consequently a speciall engine to subvert all religion, and to overthrow the good State of that Common-weale wherein they are tolerated . By the suffrage of Master Stephen Gosson. Anno 1581\. who acquaints us: That it is a shame to frequent Playes, impudency to defend them: it is sinne in the Gentiles to set out Playes, in Christians it is a presumptuous sinne; because we see better wayes and yet take the worse: we know their corruptions and allow them. All this hath beene sufficiently proved by ancient Writers, and daily revealed by learned Preachers; yet will not my Country-men leave their Playes, because Playes are the nourishers of delight . By the expresse averment of M. George Whetston. An . 1586. who records: That godly Divines, in publike Sermons, and others in printed Bookes, have (of late) very sharpely invayed against Stage-playes, (unproperly called Tragedies, Comedies and Morals) as the springs of many vices, and the stumbling- blockes of godlinesse and vertue. Truely, the use of them on the Sabbath day, and the abuse of them at all times, with scurrility and unchast convaiance, ministers matter sufficient for them to blame, and the Magistrate to reforme . To which I might adde D. Rainolds Overthrow of Stage-playes. Epistle to the Reader & pag . 93.94. I. G. his Apologie for Actors , with sundry others who concurre in this. That our two famous Vniversities have passed the selfesame doome of condemnation against Stage playes; is most apparant; both by the testimony of M. Stephen Gosson. Anno 1581\. who upon his owne knowledge affirmes: That many famous men in his time in both our Universities, had made open out-cries of the inconveniences bred by Playes; and that they held this opinion; That Playes are not to be suffred in a Christian Common-weale: but (saith he) they doe not thorowly prosecute the same, by printing any full discovery against them, because that finding the eares of the hearers stopt with the deafe Adder, they begin to shake: the dust of their shooes against them; and follow the Counsell of God himselfe ; Which biddeth them, throw no Pearles to Swine . By the testimony of learned D. Rainolds , who affirmes; that the best and gravest Divines in the Vniversity of Oxford, condemned Stage-playes by an expresse Statute made in a full Convocation of the whole University, in the yeere of our Lord 1584\. whereby the use of all common Playes was expresly prohibited in the Vniversity, lest the yonger sort (who are prone to imitate all kinds of vice) being spectators of so many lewde &evill sports as in them are practised, should be corrupted by them : answerable to which the Vniversity of Cambridge (as I have beene credibly informed) enacted a publike Statute; that no common Actors should be suffred to play within the Precincts of the Vniversities Iurisdiction, for feare they should deprave the Schollers manners . Which Statutes though perchance they are not alwayes so strictly observed as they ought, yet they are oft-times put in execution, by such Vice- chancelers, and Proctors as are most conscionably vigilant and carefull in their places. All which being put together, sufficiently discovers our Vniuersities judgement of common Players and Actors, what unsufferable mischiefes and corruptions they are. If any here Object; That our Vniversities approve of private Stage-playes acted by Schollers in private Colledges: therefore these Playes are not so intolerably evill in their opinions. I answer; that our Vniversities though they tolerate and connive at, yet they give no publike approbation to these private Enterludes , which are not generally received into all Colledges, but onely practised in some private houses, (perchance once in three or foure yeeres;) and that by the particular Statutes of those houses made in times of Popery, which require some Latine Comedies, for learning-sake onely, to bee acted now and then: Which Playes, as they are composed for the most part by idle braines, who affect not better studies; and acted (as I.G.) informes us, by Gentle-bloods, and lusty Swash-bucklers, who preferre an ounce of vaine-glory, ostentation and strutting on the Stage, before a pound of learning; or by such who are sent to the University, not so much to obtaine knowledge, as to keepe them from the common ryot of Gentlemen in these dayes; like little Children whom their Parents send to Schoole, the rather to keepe them from under feet in the streets, which carefull Mothers greatly feare: their spectators for the most part being such as both Poets and Actors are; even such as reckon no more of their studies, then spend-all Gentlemen of their cast-suites : So the graver, better, and more studious sort (especially Divines, who by sundry Councels are prohibited from acting or beholding any publike or private Stage-playes, and therefore dare not to a approach them) condemne them, censure them, come not at them , (especially when they transgresse the rules of modesty and decency as ought times they doe:) Neither are these Playes so frequent now as they have beene in former times, by reason of those mischiefes, those expences of time and many which they occasion , and that affinity they have with common Stage-playes, which all ages, all Christian, all prophane Authors of note, and these our Vniversities have solemnely condemned. Descend we from our Vniversities to our Magistrates. The Magistrates of the Citty of London , as M. Iohn Field records, obteined from Queene Elizabeth, of famous memory , about the yeere 1580. that all Heathenish Playes and Enterludes should be banished upon Sabbath dayes : and not long after many godly Citizens, and wel-disposed Gentlemen of London, considering that Play-houses and Dicing- houses, were traps for yong Gentlemen and others; and perceiving the many inconveniences, and great damage that would ensue upon the long suffring of the same, not onely to particular persons, but to the whole Citty; and that it would also be a great disparagement unto the Governours, and a dishonour to the government of this honourable Citty, if they should any longer continue; acquainted some pious Magistrates therewith, desiring them to take some speedy course for the suppression of common Play-houses and Dicing-houses within the Citty of London and Liberties thereof. Who thereupon made humble suite to Queene Elizabeth and her Privy Councell, and obtained leave from her Maiesty to thrust the Players out of the Citty, and to pull downe all Play-houses and Dicing-houses within their Liberties: which accordingly was effected: and the Play-houses in Gracious-street, Bishops-gate-street, that nigh Pauls, that on Ludgate-hill, and the White-Friers, were quite put downe and suppressed by the care of these religious Senators. And surely (writes my Author) had all their Successors followed their worthy steps, sinne would not at this day have beene so powerfull and raigning as it is . This memorable Act of suppressing Play-houses by our London Magistrates , by Authority from our vertuous Queene Elizabeth, and her most Sage Privy Counsell , as intolerable grievances and annoyances to our chiefe Christian Metropolis, is an infallible argument, that they all reputed them, unsufferable corruptions in a Christian State. Now as these pious Magistrates demolished Play houses, and thrust out all Players from within their Liberties, which now have taken sanctuary in some priviledged places, without their Iurisdiction; so divers sage and pious Iustices of Peace, and Magistrates in sundry Citties and Counties of our Realme, have from time to time, punished all wandring Stage-players as Rogues , notwithstanding the Master of the Revels, or other mens allowance, who have no legall authority to license vagrant Players : and in cases where they have had Commissions to act, they have oft denyed them liberty so to doe, within their Iurisdictions, lest their lascivious, prophane, and filthy Playes, should corrupt the people, and draw them on to vice . All which sufficiently demonstrates what our Magistrates thinke of Players and Stage-playes, which our whole State and Kingdome have condemned, as I shall now make evident, by some Acts of Parliament. In 4\. of Henry the IV. cap . 27. I finde this Act of Parliament made. Item, to eschew many diseases and mischiefes, which hath hapned before this time in the Land of Wales, by many Wasters, Rimours, Minstrels, and other Vacabonds; It is ordained and stablished, that no Master- rimour, Minstrill nor Vacabond be in any wise sustained in the Land of Wales to make commoithes nor gathering upon the people there . Loe here an ancient Statute banishing all Players, Rimours, and Minstrels out of Wales , as the Authors of many commotions, disorders, and mischiefes. In 3\. Henry 8\. cap . 9. there was this Law enacted against Mummers. For as much as lately within this Realme, divers persons have disguised and apparelled themselves, and covered their faces with Visours or other things, in such manner as they should not be knowne: and divers of them in a company together, naming themselves Mummers, have come to the dwelling place of divers men of honour, and substantiall persons, and so departed unknowne; whereupon murthers, felony, rape, and other great hurts and inconveniences have afore-time growne, and hereafter be like to come by the colour thereof, if the said disorder should continue not reformed. Wherefore be it enacted by the King our Soveraigne Lord, &c. that if any persons hereafter disguise or apparell them with Visours or otherwise upon their faces, and so disguised or apparelled as Mummers or persons unknowne, by reason of their apparell, associate or accompany them together or apart, and attempt to enter into the house of any person or persons, or assault or affrayes make upon any person or persons in the Kings high-way, or any other place in forme afore disguised, that then the said Mummers, or disguised persons, and every of them shall be arrested by any of the Kings leige people as suspects or Vacabonds, and be committed to the Kings Gaole, there to be imprisoned by the space of 3\. monethes without bayle or mainprise, and then to make fine to the King by the discretion of the Iustices, by whom they shall be delivered out of prison. And also it is ordained and enacted by the said Authority, that if any person or persons sell or keepe any Visours or Visour in his house, or in any other place within this Realme after the feast of Easter next comming, and after this Act proclaimed, that the said person (that keepeth the said Visour or Visours) shall forfeit to the King our Soveraigne Lord for every Visour 22.s. And further shall suffer imprisonment, and make fine after the discretion of the Iustices afore whom hye is thereof convicted by examination or by inquisition, after the course of the Common-law . Vpon the consideration of which Statute, Polydor Virgil writing of Stage-playes and Mummers , records: That onely England of all other Countries did not as yet behold these personated beasts: neither truely will she see them: since among the English, who in this thing are farre wiser then others; there is this law, that it shall be capitall for any person to put on a Visour or Players habit : Which Statute, as may be collected from Polydor , (who wrote about some 10\. yeeres after it ) extends as well to Players as Mummers. In 2\. & 3\. of Philip and Mary. cap . 9. intituled; An Act to avoyd divers licenses of houses wherein unlawfull games be used: upon the humble Petition of the Commons to the Queene in Parliament, it was inacted; That whereas by reason of sundry Licences heretofore granted to divers persons, as well within the Citty of London and the Suburbs of the same, as also in divers other places of the Realme, for the having, maintaining, and keeping of Houses, Gardens, &places for Bowling, Tennise, and Dicing (a game prohibited as unlawfull by sundry other of our Statutes : viz. By 12. Richard 2\. c . 6. 11. Henry 4\. cap . 4. 17. Edward 4\. cap . 3. 11. Henry 7\. cap . 2. 19. Henry 7\. cap . 12. & 33\. Henry 8\. cap . 9. where Dice-play is stiled an unlawfull, unprofitable, ungracious, and incommendable game, whereby divers are utterly undone and impoverished of their goods, and by meanes whereof divers and many murthers, robberies, and other hainous felonies were oftentimes committed in divers parts of the Realme . See 17. Edw. 4. c. 3. and thereupon it is severely condemned under great mulcts and punishments; the Dice-players being to forfeit ten pound a peece, and to suffer two yeeres imprisonment, and such as keepe any Dicing- houses to forfeit twenty pound a peece, and to suffer 3\. yeeres imprisonment, &c.) for white and blacke, making and marring, and other unlawfull games prohibited by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, divers and many unlawfull assemblies, conventicles, seditions and conspiracies had beene daily and secretly practised by idle and misruly persons repairing to such places, of the which robberies and divers misdemeanours had ensued; that for remedy thereof, all Licences, placards or grants made to any person or persons for the keeping of any Bowling-allies, Dicing-houses, or other unlawfull games (in the which number Stage-playes were included) should be utterly voyd, and of none effect. By the Statutes of 34. & 35\. Henry 8\. cap . 1. of 2\. & 3\. Edward 6\. cap . 1. 1. Eliz. cap . 2. and of 3\. Iacobi. cap 21\. We have severall mulcts and penalties inflicted upon such, who should recite or interpret Scripture, or revile the Sacrament or Booke of Common Prayer, or any part thereof; or iestingly and prophanely speake or use the Name of God the Father, or of Christ Iesus, or of the holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, in any Enterludes, Stage-playes, Rymes or Pageants . And lest any one should hence inferre, that these Statutes (which are principally intended in private Playes and Enterludes, since they condemne and suppresse all publike,) seeme to allow of popular Stage-playes, because they suppresse not Playes themselves, but onely these their abuses; the Statutes of 14\. Eliz. cap . 5. 39. Eliz. cap . 4. 1. Iacobi. cap 7\. & 1\. Caroli, cap . 1. doe in expresse words. condemne all Stage-playes, and common Enterludes, as unlawfull exercises and pastimes; occasioning many great inconveniences, quarrels, blood-sheds, and disorders, to Gods dishonour, and the publike preiudice : For the better suppression of which, the Statutes of 14\. Eliz. cap . 5. & 39\. Eliz. cap . 4. have branded, have adiudged all common Players of Enterludes, all idle persons using any unlawfull games, all Players and wandring Minstrels, for Rogues, for Vacabonds and Sturdy Beggers; subiecting them to such paines and punishments as other wandring Rogues and Vacabonds are to undergoe; unlesse; they should belong to some Baron or other honourable person of greater degree, and be authorized by them to play under their band and Seale of Armes: which license of theirs exempted them onely from the punishment, not from the infamy , or stile of Rogues and Vacabonds: which Statutes, not so effectually suppressing these Playes and Enterludes as was expected, by reason of the liberty that Barons and other Noblemen had to license Players of Enterludes belonging to them to act their Playes, the Statute of 1\. Iacobi . c. 7. to remedy this mischiefe, hath declared and enacted: that from thenceforth no authority given or to be given or made by any Baron of this Realme, or any other honourable Personage of greater degree unto any Enterlude Players, Minstrels, Iuglers, Bear-ward, or any other idle person or persons whatsoever, using any unlawfull games or Playes, to play or act, should be available to free or discharge the said persons or any of them, from the paines and punishments of Rogues, of Vacabonds and Sturdy-beggers in the said Statutes (viz. 14. Eliz. cap. 5. &39\. Eliz. cap. 4.) mentioned; but that they shall be taken within the offence and punishments of the same Statutes, and of this Statute of 1\. Iacobi. cap . 7. So that now at this day, by these severall Acts of Parliament yet in force, (resolved and concluded upon after long mature deliberation by our whole State and Kingdome,) all common Stage-playes, are solemnely adiudged to be unlawfull and pernicious Exercises, not sufferable in our State: and all common Stage-players, by whomsoever licensed; to be but Vacabonds, Rogues, and Sturdy-beggers; who ought to suffer such paines and punishments in every degree, as are appointed to be inflicted upon all other Vacabonds, Rogues, and Sturdy-beggers, by the forenamed Statutes . So that all Magistrates may now justly punish them as Rogues and Vacabonds, where-ever they goe, (yea they ought both in law and conscience for to doe it, since these severall Statutes thus inforce them to it) notwithstanding any License which they can procure, since the expresse words of the Statute of 1. Iacobi. cap . 7. hath made all Licenses unavaylable to free them from such punishments . It is most apparantly evident then by all these premises; that not onely Pagan Writers, Emperours, States, and Magistrates; together with the Primitive Christians, Fathers, and Christian Writers of Forraigne parts; but even our owne domestique Writers, Preachers, Vniversities, Magistrates, and our whole State it selfe in open Parliament, both in ancient, moderne, and present times, have abandoned, censured, condemned Stage-playes and common Actors, as the very pests, the corruptions of mens mindes and manners; the Seminaries of all vice, all lewdnesse, wickednesse, and disorder: and intolerable mischiefes in any civill or well-disciplined Common-weale : therefore my Minors truth is past all doubt, we cannot but readily subscribe unto it; and so by consequence to the conclusion too, without any more dispute. How then can we tolerate, or connive at, much lesse applaude, frequent, or iustifie these pernicious depraving Enterludes, which we have all thus condemned as intolerable evils? Our owne Writers, Preachers, Vniversities, Magistrates; yea, our whole Realme and State in Parliament (to whose Acts we all are parties, as our Law-bookes teach us ) have thus publikely branded, censured them, as extreamely evill, how can, how dare we then foment them, pleade for them, or resort unto them, as exceeding good? Let us, O let us not be worser then these Heathen, nor wiser then these Christian fore-recited forraigne, and domestique Authors, Fathers, Ministers, Magistrates, Princes, Emperours, States and Kingdomes, who have thus abandoned, suppressed Playes and Players for the forenamed mischiefes which they did occasion: but as we cannot but approve, applaud their censure in our judgmets, so let us submit unto them in our practise; renouncing, abominating all filthy Stage-playes from henceforth and for ever, as the very poyson, the corruption of our mindes and manners, which they will strangely vitiate, as all these conclude, and the examples both of the ancient Greekes and Romanes witnesse. And no wonder is it, that Stage-playes should thus deprave the Actors, the Spectators mindes and manners; especially those of the younger sort, who in regard both of their tender yeeres, their want of iudgemet, of experience; the strength, the vigor of their lusts, and their naturall inclination unto evill, are more easily corrupted . For if evill words corrupt good manners , as the Apostle teacheth: there is plenty of these in all our Stage-playes, which are little better then meere bawdery and scurrility: If sinfull, lewde companions : if the society of Adulterers, Adulteresses, Whore-masters, Whores, Ruffians, Panders, Bawdes, or such like leprous creatures, can deprave men, as all professe they will ; what others shall we meete at Theaters, but such lewde filthy persons? If pestilent, wicked, vitious places will infect mens mindes or manners ; What place so dangerous, so leprous, so contagious, as the Play- house? which the Fathers stile, a Chaire of Pestilence. If adulterous, lascivious Spectacles are apt to poyson, to contaminate the eyes, the soules, the lives, the manners of the Spectators, as they are : what Shewes, what Spectacles so lewde, so obscene, as those that are daily represented on the Stage? If any, if every of these will severally corrupt men, in company, in places where there is little danger, as too oft they doe; much more will they deprave men when they are all combined , as they are in Stage-playes; where all the severall scattered corruptions that usually adulterate mens mindes and manners of themselves alone, unite their forces ; their contagions into one. But what need I presse any further reasons to prove this cursed effect of Stage-playes, when as our own visible experience abundantly confirmes it? For alas, whence is all that prodigious desperate dissolutenesse, prophanesse, wickednesse, drunkennesse, impudence, lewdnesse, and disorder; that grosse uncleanesse, that exorbitant obliquity, that stupendious degeneracy in life, apparel, speech, gesture, haire , complements, and the intire man? Whence all those severall armies of corruptions, of vices, which infect our Nation? Whence all those severall beastly, diabolicall, audacious, crying, daring sinnes of our femalized gotish males , or mannish females , who out-stare the very Lawes of God, of Man, of Nature, and send up daily challenges for vengeance to the God of Heaven; Whence all those common Adulterers, Adulteresses, Whore- masters, Whores, Bawdes, Panders, Ruffians, Rorers, Swearers, Duellers, Cheaters, Fashion-mongers, Fantastiques, Libertines, Scoffers, haters of God , of grace, of holinesse; Dispisers and slanderers of all religious men ; the Enemies of all modesty and common civility; with such other lawlesse, godlesse persons, who now swarme so thicke of late in the streets of our Metropolis; professing themselves openly to be the very first- borne of Satan , the very factors, and heires apparant of Hell; in that they proclame their sinne as Sodom in the open view of all men , without the smallest blush, and glory in those infernall filthy practises which should even melt their soules with sorrow, and confound their Faces with the deepest shame ; Are not they all originall from Playes? From Play-houses ? have they not all their birth, their growth, their aliment, their complement, their intention, their support from these? Are not these the Nurseries, the Fountaines whence they spring? the food by which they live, they grow, and multiply? the meanes by which they roote and spred themselves? Certainely he is starke blinde that cannot; he most perversly wilfull that will not see it; so apparant is it to the eyes, the consciences of all men who prie into the causes of these grosse disorders. Since therefore the dangerous leprosie, the pestiferous contagion of mind-corrupting, manner-depraving Stage-playes is so irrefragably confirmed by reason, by experience, by all the forequoted Authorities, both Pagan and Christian, forraigne and domestique; I may safely, I may confidently conclude on all the premises, (and I hope ere long, to see our Gracious Soveraigne, or Church, our State, our Parliament, our Counsell; yea all our Magistrates, Ministers, People, even really concurring with me in this right Christian Assertion;) That Stage-playes deprave the mindes, adulterate the manners both of their Actors and Spectators; and that therefore they are altogether unlawfull, abominable unto Christians; not tolerable in anywill be at lea Christian well-ordered Common-weale: Which should cause us all in generall, each of us in particular, as wee either tender the publike or our owne private welfare, for ever to abandon, suppresse, renounce all Stage-playes. Crudelitas ista, pietas est : This cruelty will be at least our piety, if not our safety, in these dangerous wicked times, that cry for nought but wrath and vengeance, which are likely for to come upon us to the uttermost, (as they did of old upon the Iewes, the Greekes and Romanes,) for our resort to Stage-playes and our other sinnes , unlesse our speedy, repentance,  &Gods great mercy ward them off. The sixt pestiferous effect of Stage-playes, is sloth and idlenesse: two dangerous inchanting Syrens : From whence this 32. Argument will arise. That which is the constant cause, the common spring and nursery of much sloth and idlenesse; must needs be sinfull and pernitious unto Christians, intolerable in any Common-weale. See 1. Edward 6 cap . 3. 3. Edw . 6. cap . 16. 5. Edw . 6. c . 2. and all our Statutes against Rogues and Vacabonds , accordingly. But Stage playes are the constant occasions, the common springs and nurseries of much sloth and idlenesse; witnesse the present condition of our English Youth, who flocke to Theaters, whom Seneca hath long since discyphered in the Romanes. Therefore they must needs be sinfull and pernitious unto Christians, intolerable in any Commonweale. The Major verily must be granted to me: First, because sloth and idlenesse are sinnes against the expresse command of God . Secondly, because they are the very rust and canker of mens mindes, mens parts, mens bodies, mens soules . Thirdly, because they are the occasion, the fountaine of most other sinnes; as adultery, whoredome, drunkennesse, theft, voluptuousnesse, pride in apparell, lasciviousnesse, vaine discourse, and a world of other sinnes which would never be committed; to which the Devill could not tempt men, were they imployed in their lawfull callings . Fourthly, because the very curse and wrath of God; together with pennury, vanity, misery, and destruction attend these sinnes . Fiftly, because these sinnes are most dangerous, most pernitious, preiudiciall and destructive to a State, of all others ; both because they indispose men too, and keepe them off from their honest callings, from all publike imployments and services for the publike good: because they occasion dearth and poverty, robbing the Common-wealth of the benefit of mens industry, and painefull labour: and likewise because they are the Seminaries, Nurseries, and fewell of all other vices and corruptions, that either weaken, trouble, disorder, or subvert a Republike , (as idlenesse and luxury have subverted many,) as all Polititians doe affirme: who censure and exclude all idle persons, as the very Caterpillers, Drones, and Canker-wormes of the Common-weales wherein they live ; inacting sundry Lawes against them, as the lawes of Draco, (who made idlenesse a capital crime :) together with the lawes of the Æ gyptians , of Solon , of Sardoa, and Pesistratus doe abundantly testifie. The causes therefore of such pernicious State-subverting sinnes as these, which have brought destruction to sundry great Republikes as they long since drew downe fire and brimstone from Heaven upon Sodom ; must needs be as dangerous, as intolerable as these sins themselves: and so my Major (if either Divinity or Policy may be credited) must be intirely condiscended to. For the Minor; That Stage-playes are the constant occasions, the common Seminaries and Nurseries of much lasinesse, and idlenesse; (as our reverend Archbishop Matthew Parker witnesseth,) it is most apparant. First, by their ordinary Actors and Frequenters; who are commonly such idle Drones, as live either altogether without any honest calling ; their whole life being but an Apprentiship of idlenesse, or a continued Play; (as if they were borne for no other purpose but to eate, to drinke , to sleepe, to play, and waste their time:) or else such who are altogether negligent, slothfull, indiligent in their callings: such who make Pauls their Westminster; a Play-house, an ordinary or Dancing-schoole, their Study: a Play-booke their Littleton , their Bible : and loytering, if not the courting of some Whore or Mistris , the greatest part of their profession; as too too many doe in this voluptuous age: wherein divers of our male, more of our female sex, repaue it a blemish to their honour, a disparagement to their gentility to be honesty imployed in any lawfull vocation that might either benefit themselves or others , or advance the publike good. Secondly, by the very end and use of Stage-playes, to which men seldome resort, but to passe away their idle houres, which they know not how to spend for want of other imployments. Alas say our idle Drones one to another, (as if they had no God to serve, no Bibles to read, no Sermons to heare, no Churches, no Studies, no Closets to resort to, no graces to purchase, no lusts to conquer, no Prayers to make , no spirituall instructions to learne, no holy duties to performe, no workes of grace to finish, no degrees of grace to acquire, no friends to admonish, no families to instruct, no sicke to visite, no dejected spirits to comfort, no gracelesse persons to reprove, no heavenly misteries to contemplate, no spirituall doubts to satisfie, no callings to follow, no Heaven to desire, no Hell to feare,) wee know not how to spend or passe away these afternoones, we have nothing at all to doe; come therefore let us goe to such or such a Play-house, and there we will merrily passe the time, feeding our eyes, our eares with those Stage- delights which shall there present themselves unto us . Stage-playes serve for nothing else, but either to draw men on by degrees to idlenesse, or to foster, to foment them in it: Wherefore they are rightly called Playes, from playing; because they teach men onely to play away their time with-drawing them from their Studies, their Vocations, unto idlenesse, and a kinde of lasie life. Thirdly, by daily experience: For what persons are there more slothfull, idle, unprofitable, unserviceable to themselves or others; lesse studious, lesse diligent and laborious in their lawfull callings, then common Actors and Play-haunters? who have many of them no other imployment at all, but onely this, to Act, or see a Stage-play; or to dice, to card, to dance, to adorne and paint themselves, oft-times for publike if not for private sale . Stage-playes either finde or make men idle : they either occasion, or foment their sloth: they either cause people to live without callings; or at least withdraw them from them, to give their after-noones attendance on themselves. Hence is it, that the Scholler is oft with-drawne from his Schoole, the Student from his Study; the Mechanicke from his Trade; the Master from his Family; the Lady and Gentlewoman from her Closet or Needle; the Mistris from her house; the Husband from his Wife; the Wife from her Husband; the Servant from his Masters businesse; the Apprentice from his Shop; the Courtier from his attendance: the Officer from his Office; Yea sometime, the very Magistrate from his Government, the Minister from his Pulpit ; the Parishioner from his Church, his Lecture; the whole Citty from their callings, to a Play-house, to act, to see or heare a lewde lascivious Enterlude ; the very best part whereof, is pure vanity, if not sinfull folly. Totam hodie Romam Circus capit ; was the Poet Iuvenals complaint of old; and I feare it might be ours now: Such prevalency is there in these bewitching Stage-playes to draw men on to sloth, to idlenesse the very bane, the poyson, and destruction of mens peerelesse soules : which the very Turkes enumerate among the number of their seven deadly sinnes . Lastly, my Minors truth, as it is evident by experience, so likewise is it ratified by the concurrent suffrage of sundry Fathers and moderne Authors, and by our owne Acts of Parliament , who for this very cause among sundry other condemne, reject and censure Stage-playes as unlawfull pastimes, because they are the occasions, the fomentations of much sloth and idlenesse .

Since therefore the Major, and Minor are thus apparantly true, the Conclusion from them must be granted, by all who either regard the publike, or their owne private good. The consequent or effect of Stage-playes, is luxury, drunkennesse, and excesse: From whence this 33, Argument may be raysed. That which is an immediate occasion of, an ordinary temptation unto luxury, drunkennesse, and excesse, is utterly unlawfull unto Christians: intolerable in any Common-weale. But such are Stage-playes: as Lactantius , Augustine, Scipio Nasica , and the ensuing Authors testifie. Therefore they are utterly unlawfull unto Christians, intolerable in any Common-weale. The Major is evident by the 1 Pet . 4. 3. 4. which informes us, That the time past of our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousnesse, lusts, excesse of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries; wherein they thinke it strange that you run not with them into the same excesse of riot, speaking evill of you: who shall give an account to him who is ready to iudge both quicke and dead . By Titus 2\. 11. 12. The grace of God which bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men; teaching us, that denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world . By Ephes . 5. 18. And be not drunke with wine wherein is excesse . By Luke 21\. 34. Take heed to your selves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfetting and drunkennesse, and cares of this world, and that day come upon you at unawares : by sundry such like Scriptures to this purpose which I have formerly quoted in another Treatise : And likewise by the dangerous quality of these effeminating soule- destroying sinnes, which are more pernicious to a Common-weale, then pestilence or warre it selfe ; more fatall to mens soules and bodies, then any Circean charme. The Minor is most apparant: First, from the originall invention, and dedication of Stage-playes; which were first of all devised by a company of drunken Grecians in honor of their Devil-Idoll Bacchus ( the God of wine, of drunkennesse, and all excesse;) to whom Playes, and Play-houses were consecrated at the first; as Historians and Fathers certifie us : Whence Tertullian stiles the Theater , the house or temple of Bacchus; because Stage-playes (which were formerly stiled Liberalia) were as Diodorus Siculus, I sinder Hispalensis, and others record, instituted by, & consecrated unto Bacchus, the Idol, the author of all intemperance . If therefore their very inception were thus from drunkennesse, and excesse; their progresse questionlesse must bee such. Secondly, it is euident from the testimony, the experience of former ages; who not onely enumerate Stage- playes among the excesses, the luxury both of the Greekes and Romanes , as the Fathers and Authors in the margent testifie; but likewise make them the chiefe occasions of it. Hence Chrysostome and Nazianz[illeg.]n stile the Playhouse; The Schoole of intemperance, deboistnesse, luxury, and excesse . Hence Salvian ioynes the Stage-playes, epicurisme and drunkennesse of the Romanes, and those of Trevers, both together ; making one the effect, the companion of the other. It is noted by Historians , that Caligula, Heliogobalus, Nero, Commodus, Gallienus, and other Roman Emperours who delighted most in Stage-playes, were the most deboist, luxurious, dissolute, ebrious , of all others: an infallible demonstration; that Stage-playes are the occasion, fewell, and attendants of these sinnes. It was the custome of the Pagan Greekes and Romanes, in all their drunken riotous Feasts , (as it is now the usage of too many Christians) to exhilerate themselves with Stage-playes, of purpose to draw men on to drunkennesse, luxury, and more grosse intemperance : Whence the Councell of Laodicea. Can . 53. 54. and the Councell of Aquisgrane under Lewes the godly, prohibited Stage-playes at Christians marriage-Feasts; and enioyned all Ministers not to be present at them, but to arise and depart from such feasts before the Players entred ; that so they might prevent that riot, that excesse which these theatricall Enterludes might occasion. All which, together with that of Plutarch , who relates, that all Stage-players were consecrated unto Bacchus as well as these their Stage- playes , is a plenary ratification of my Minors truth, to which our owne experience must subscribe. For who more luxurious, ebrious, riotous or deboist, then our assiduous Actors and Play-haunters? Who greater Taverne, Ale-house, Tobacco-shop, Hot-water-house haunters,  &c? who greater, stouter drinkers, health-quaffers, Epicures, or good-fellowes, then they? What walke more usuall then from a Play-house to a Taverne, to an Ale-house, a Tobacco- shop, or Hot-water Brothel-house; or from these unto a Play-house? where the Pot, the Can, the Tobacco-pipe are alwayes walking till the Play be ended; from whence they returne to these their former haunts. Many are the Ale-house, more the Bacchanalian Taverne-meetings that are appointed, concluded at the Play-house, from which much drunkennesse, and excesse arise: yea the Play- house is the common Randevouze where most such riotous Taverne-conventicles are either motioned, plotted, or resolved on, as our Play-haunters themselves confesse. And is there not reason, why it should be so? Are not drunkennesse, ioviality, epicurisme, luxury, and profusenesse, most rhetorically applauded, most elegantly adorned in our Stage-playes with the sublimest Encomiums, the most insinuating Panegyrickes, the most amiable Titles that either art or eloquence can invent? and doth not this adde spurs and fewell to many Yongsters lusts? who to purchase the empty title. of brave, generous, liberall, and right ioviall Sparkes , whom Players most applaud, doe prodigally consume their Patrimonies, their Pensions, their time in Tavernes, Ordinaries, Tobacco- shops,  &c. in ebrious luxurious meetings, to their owne undoing, their friends and Parents griefe. Alas, the pittifull complaints of sundry parents, together with the testimony of our owne grave English Authors , prove this to be too true: Therefore we must needs abominate and reject all popular Stage-playes, in respect of these their cursed fruits. The eight effect of Stage-playes, is impudency, immodesty, and shamelesnesse, yea even in sinfull things: Whence this 34. Argument may be deduced. That which banisheth all modesty, al shamefacenesse, and makes both Actors & Spectators impudently shamelesse in committing sinne, is questionlesse abominable and unlawfull unto Christians. But this doe Stage-playes, and Play-houses. Therefore they are questionlesse abominable and unlawfull unto Christians. My Major is irrefragable: First, because modesty and shamefastnesse are such graces, such vertues, as God himselfe requires of us in his Word ; and which the very Heathen much extoll . They are the chiefest ornaments, virtues, guides, supports, and stay of Youth; the Mothers, the conservers of all other Christian, or morrall vertues; the onely curbs that restraine men from all sinne, all lewdnesse and dishonesty whatsoever : where these are once removed, the whole practise of honesty and vertue will be quite extinguished . Hee who hath lost these vertues, is no better then a cast-away : He who is past all shame, is certainley past all grace, past all recovery, all amendment. That therefore which banisheth these two restrayning, vice- suppressing vertues , in which not onely Christianity , but even all common honesty, civility, and the publike safety doe subsist , must needs bee abominable. Secondly, because impudency and shamelesnesse, especially in committing sinne, is almost the very highest degree of sinne; yea they provoke God more to anger, and draw a deeper guilt, a more multiplied condemnation upon men, then the sinne it selfe which they thus perpetrate . They are infallible symptomes of a cauterized conscience, an obdurate heart, a reprobate sence; of a man given wholy over unto sinne and Satan : yea they are very dangerous presages of a man bound over to eternall destruction. My Major therefore must be granted. The Minor is as evident as the morning Sunne. First, by the concurrent testimony of sundry Fathers, and moderne Christian Authors. Tertullian reputes Stage-playes, the banishers, the murtherers of all modesty and shamefastnesse : S. Cyprian informes us; that all modesty is put off at Theaters ; which he stiles, the very Brothell of publike modesty : in which the most shamefull representations of lust are acted; ut in ipsis deposita verecundia, andaciores fiant ad crimina. Lactantius records; that those things are acted in Stage-playes by representation which are not; that so the very things themselves may be committed by the Spectators without any shame. What (saith he) will Youthes and Virgins doe when they shall see these things acted, and willingly beheld of all without any blush? doubtlesse they will grow exceeding impudent and shamelesse in committing the very sinnes there acted. Gregory Nazianzen and Chrysostome , write, That all Stage- players are impudent shamelesse persons; who as they repute nothing vile but modesty; so they utterly extirpate all shamefastnesse, all modesty out of the mindes and foreheads of the Spectators. S. Augustin , in his Booke De Civitate Dei , affirmes the very selfesame thing; whence he stiles these Stage-playes: The very pestilence and contagion of mens mindes; the overthrow of vertue and honesty : the true Fugalia of shamefastnesse and modesty: Damascen in his Parallels informes us out of Nazianzen ; that Play- haunters, and women who resort to Theaters, account it a reproach unto them, to blush: so impudently brawny are their faces . The same doe other Fathers; together with Petrarch[illeg.] , Mantuan , Agrippa , Lodovicus Vives , M. Gosson , M. Northbrooke , Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters , D. Rainolds , with sundry others affirme: therefore wee need not doubt its verity. Secondly, our owne present experience will evidently manifest the Minors truth. For who are there more impudently audacious; more shamelesly wicked; more ready to heare, to see, to speake, to act, to execute the most execrable obscenities, the most grosse impieties without any blush, then our common Actors and Play-haunters ? What Spectacles, what places doe more steele the faces, or crust the foreheads both of men and women, then Playes and Play-houses? Those who at first , could neither see, nor heare, (much lesse utter or act) any obscene or vitious thing without some shame of face, or checke of conscience, before their resort to Playes and Theaters; become so strangely impudent, so brazen- faced in a very little space by frequenting Stage-playes, that they cannot onely confidently behold and heare, but likewise utter and commit any filthinesse, or wickednesse whatsoever, in the very open view of men, without any blush at all; even as Nero did. The stupendious whorish unparalleld impudency of our present age; Of our effeminate overgrowne Yongsters , and blasphemous Ruffians, who breath out nothing but oathes, obscenities, and desperate execrations against the God of Heaven , rending the very flesh and bones, piercing the very heart and soule, blaspheming the very Name and Blood of our Lord Iesus Christ, at every word they utter: Of our impudent, brazen-faced Man-woman Monsters , who have banished all shewes of modesty, of shamefastnesse from their sex; carrying the very characters of impudency, not onely in their blushlesse lookes; but likewise in their lascivious gestures, their audatious deportment, their obscene discourses, their whorish attires, their immodest fashions and complements, their painted faces; their prodigious shorne, frizled lockes and foretops, which outstare the very Lawes of God; of Man, of Nature , (so unnaturely, and more then whorishly impudent , are many of our females lately growne;) Whence is it, comes it but from Playes and Theaters? which have diffused this cursed disease of shamelesse impudency, well-nigh thorowout the Kingdome: And hence is it, that we are all lately growne so immoderately excessive in committing sinne, because Playes and Play-haunters have scrued us up to such a pitch of impudency, that we are quite past all shame . Neither is it strange, that Playes and Play-houses should make the modestest and most ingenious Spectators shamelesse, if not sencelesse of any sinne. For first the Actors of them are certainely past all shame , if not all grace. Secondly, the greater part of common Play-haunters are audacious Panders, Whores, Adulterers, Whore-masters, and the like , who are as blushlesse as Frier Bacons Brazen-head, or as he who acts the Devill in the Play. Thirdly, the very words, the parts, the speeches, gestures, complements, and representions in Stage-playes, are so obsceme, lascivious, lewde, and beastly , that the very hearing and beholding of them were enough to banish all modesty out of the hearts and countenances of the most ingenious Spectators, or at least to drive them from the Play-house: For as Aristotle well observes; Men are not onely ashamed of those shamefull things that are so called, but likewise of the signes of them: not onely when they are conversant in any lecherous thing, but likewise when the representations of that thing are present: and not onely when as they doe filthy things, but likewise when they speake them : So that modesty and shamefacenesse doe not onely restraine men from speaking and doing; but likewise from hearing and beholding any scurrilous or immodest thing. Alcaus a modest Heathen, being about to utter some obscenity, was so overcome of modesty, that he brake out into these memorable words I would have spoken some thing, but modesty prohibites me . It is storied of Archytas another Pagan, that his modesty was such, as he would not so much as utter a scurrilous word; and being upon an occasion necessitated to speake some unbeseeming thing, he could not be induced to relate it upon any tearmes, but wrote it on the wall, and then pointed to others to read it . Yea Pliny records, that the hashfulnesse and modesty of brute Elephants is such : Vt pudore nunquam nisi in abdito coeunt: that they never couple but in some secret place not obvious to mens view . Certainely, if modesty had such prevalency in these bruites and Pagans, to deterre them both from obscene discourses, and venereous actions, especially in publike: our Stage-playes which are fraught with many ribaldrous passages, many witty obscenities, many filthy gestures, many feined, if not reall representations of Incests, Rapes, Adulteries, and the like, must either utterly abolish all modesty out of the Actors and Spectators eyes and eares; or else quite chase them from the Play-house; whose lewdnesse and unchastity is such, that it is capable of none but shamelesse and immodest Customers . So that I may well conclude with Tacitus ; That shamefastnesse, chastity, or any other honest quality, which are hardly retained in honest arts, can never possibly be preserved amids so many confluences and combates of vices as accompany Playes and Theaters . And hereupon L. Crassus, and Cn. Domitius prohibited Playes and Play-houses, by a publike Edict , quod his corroboraretur impudentia, because they made their Spectators more impudent . The propositions therefore being thus infallibly confirmed by the premises, the Conclusion from them must be granted, The 9. consequent or fruit of Stage-playes, is cozenage, fraud, and theft: which are oft-times occasioned and taught by Stage-playes. Play-houses are the Schooles, Playes the Lectures which teach men how to cheate, to steale; to plot and execute any villany: how to conceale it, to evade it being executed; men learning, yea practising that in earnest, which they act or see acted but in sport. Zenophon makes mention of a Persian Schoole-master, who instructed his Schollers: both to doe iustice and iniustice; not to lie, and to lie: not to deceive and to deceive: not to caluminate and calumniate, not to forestall any benefit that might accrue to others, and to forestall it: He did likewise distinguish which of these ought to be practised upon enemies, which upon friends: And then proceeding further, he taught that it was iust to deceive their friends if it were for their good; and to steale the goods of their friends if it were for their good: This Schoole-master likewise exercised his Schollers to practise these instructions in iest among themselves: by which meanes it came to passe, that some of his Schollers who had a naturall ingenuity wittily to deceive, to cheate and steale from others; began at last not onely to cozen and steale from strangers, but likewise to cheate and rob their friends. Whereupon the Persians were enforced to make a law to prevent this mischife (which law is yet in use) that Children should ever after be taught plainely, and to speake and deale truely, as men teach their Servants: and not to steale, to lie, or use deceits . As it fared with this Persian Schoole- master, and his Schollers; so it fares with Players and their lewde Spectators: those cheates, those fallacies, thefts and robberies, those rapes of Wards, of Virgins from their Gardians, their Parents, which they act in sport upon the Stage, the Spectators oft-times practise in earnest upon others off the Theater. Discunt facere dum assuescunt videre . This Solon knew full well, who when he beheld Thespis acting a Tragedy, wherein there were many lies and cheates: he demanded of him after the Tragedy ended; whether he were not ashamed to lie and cheate so egregiously before so great a multitude? To which Thespis replyed; that there was no hurt in it, for all he had uttered or acted was but a Play, it was all in sport, nothing in earnest: which answer Solon hearing, stroke his staffe upon the ground with indignation, making this reply: If we commend or approve this Play of yours, we shall shortly finde it in our bargaines : intimating that this his lying and cozenage which hee acted in jest, would quickly turne to earnest: so prone, so docible are men to learne any evill that Players act. Saint Augustine had a hint of this: whence he stiles Stage-playes, the very overthrow of honesty and upright dealing . For the theft that Playes occasion, I shall give but two or three instances. It is storied by Suetonius in the life of Nero; that he put downe Chariot-playes and Stage- playes, in which men by an inveterate liberty did use to cheate and steale in iest, because this iesting turned to earnest at the last. Tiberim did the like, banishing all Players out of Italy upon the selfe same ground . Vpon this very reason was our owne Statute of 3\. Henry 8\. cap . 9. against Mummers , made; because those thefts and robberies which they acted in sport, proved robberies and felonies in good earnest at the last, and were the occasions of much mischiefe . The Author of the 3. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters informes us. That many servants have learnt at Stage- playes (as it may be manifestly proved) to rob and cheate their Masters, to supply the wants of their Harlots. That many have there learned a policy to prevent Parents of the not marrying of their Daughters to such whom they have disliked, by stealing them away. And that men are taught policies in this Schoole of Abuse, how to beguile Parents of their Children, Husbands of their Wives, Gardians of their Wards, and Masters of their Servants : To which Master Gosson and others doe subscribe. Wherefore from all these premises I may now safely frame this 35. Argument against Stage-playes, with which I shall conclude this Scene. That which occasions much theft, much treachery, cozenage and deceit, must needs be unlawfull unto Christians, unsufferable in a Common-weale. Witnesse Ephes . 4. 25. 28. 1 Thes . 4. 6. & Caso Ethecorum. lib . 4. cap . 7. But all these doe Stage-playes occasion, as is evident by the premises. See Act 3\. 4. 5. Therefore they must needs be unlawfull unto Christians, unsufferable in a Common-weale. brawles, seditions, tumults , murthers, and the like; as is evident by sundry testimonies and examples. Hence was it, that Plato banished all Tragedies out of his Common-weale, because they would draw men on to tyranny and cruelty, by acting, by applauding them, and breed quarrels and commotions among the people . Hence Seneca and Plutarch, dislike of Stage-playes, because they enrage the mindes of the Spectators, breeding oft-times many tumuls, quarrels and contentions among them . Hence Horace writes expresly: that Playes engender contention and anger; anger cruell enmity and dolefull warre . Hence we finde it recorded of Dionysius , Nero, Caligula , and other bloody tyrants; that they delighted much in Tragedies and Stage-playes; as being suitable to their tyrannicall dispositions . Hence Tertullian ; Cyprian and Clemens Alexandrini[illeg.]; declaime against Tragedies and Comedies as the augmentors of wickednes and lust; as bloody wanton, impious and prodigall pastimes which occasion sundry tumults and seditions. Gregory Nazianzen informes us: That Playes and Enterludes disturbe Citties, rayse up sedition among the people, teach men how to quarrell, sharpen ill-speaking tongues, cut asunder the love of the Citizens, set families at variance betweene themselves, drive yong men into fury, kindle quarrels and contentions, &c . Whence hee stiles them; A sedition producing murther, and a disease of Citties. Saint Chrysostome records from his owne experience. That Players and Play-haunters were the onely men who did fill the Citty with contentions, quarrels, seditions, tumults: that Playes did breed debate betweene man and wife; and that Players and Play-haunters by acting and seeing Playes became more barbarous then the most savage beasts, insomuch that they spared not the bones of the dead. Theodoricus King of Italy , stiles Stage-playes, The invitation of contentions, the perennious fountaine of brawles and quarrels , and the frequent occasion of seditions and tumults . Such Authors of misrule, quarrels, seditions and contentions were Playes in ancient times, of which there are divers pregnant examples. Wee all know, that the rape of the Sabine Virgins was occasioned by a Play; which produced a long and bloody warre betweene the Romanes and Sabines. The fierce and cruell warre betweene the Volsci and the Romanes was likewise occasioned by a Play; the Consuls upon the speech of Attius Tullus, excluding the Volsci from their Playes, and commanding them to depart their Citty, for feare of some sodaine tumult that might arise betweene the Romanes and them, or some unexpected surprisall of their Citty whiles the whole Citty were busied about their Players. In Tiberius his Raigne, there were so many tumuls, murthers, uprores, quarrels, and open insolences committed at Play-houses, occasioned by Playes, and Actors; (One Centurian, with divers Soldiers and common people being slaine, and a Captaine of the Pretorean band, with sundry others being likewise wounded at a Play) that Tiberius was enforced to banish all Stage-players out of Italy: In the time of Nero, there were so many seditions, quarrels, commotions, and misdemeanors in the Roman Theater, that Nero himselfe (who had oft an hand in them) suppressed all Playes, all Stage players by a solemne Edict, though he much delighted in them . In the Raigne of Marcus Aurelius, there was a very great tumuls and sedition occasioned by Stage-playes, in which much blood was shed, there being many slaine and wounded: upon which occasion this Heathen Emperour, banished all Stage-players for ever from Rome, and sent them into Hellispont to Lambert the Governour, with a command to compell them to labour, to chastice them if they were idle, and not to suffer them to use their accustomed toyes. Coesar Bulengerus informes us; that under Hypatius and Bellisarius, there were at least 35\. thousand men slaine in a commotion and tumult raysed at a Cirque-play . In the time of Theodoricus King of Italy, there were so many tumults, quarrels, and commotions raysed at Stage-playes; that he was enforced upon the complaint of the people, to write to the Senate, and other of his Officers, to suppresse their insolencies, and to punish the mutinies, the commetions caused by them: At last being not able to reforme their disorders, he gave order wholy to suppresse them. And from these severall disorders and quarrels came these common phrases ; Seditiones & factiones Pantomimorum, & seditiones theatri, bella Theatricorum, &c . which we read of in sundry Authors; and in Saint Augustine, De Catechizandis Rudibus. lib. Tom . 4. pars 2\. pag . 340. 341. & H Rabanus Maurus, De Sacris Orainibus. lib . 1. Tom . 6. pag . 63. A. B . where the sundry tumults, quarrels, and other mischiefes that Stage-playes and Cirque-playes occasion, are pithily discribed. But these are all ancient forraigne testimonies and examples, may some say: are there any such moderne domestique presidents to be found? Yes verily. Witnesse the Statute of 4\. Henry 4\. cap . 27. which recites; that divers diseases and mischiefes (to wit commotions, murthers, and rebellions) had hapned before this time in the Land of Wales, by many Wasters , Rimours, Minstrels, and other Vacabonds: for the eschewing of which; it was ordained and established by this Statute; That no Master Rimour, Minstrell, nor Vacabond, should be in any wise sustained in the Land of Wales, to make commoithes or gathering upon the people there . Witnesse the Statute of 3\. Henry 8\. cap . 9. against Mummers , (all one with Stage-players:) which recites. That lately within this Realme, divers persons had disguised and apparelled them, and covered their faces with Visours or other things in such manner as they should not be knowne, and that divers of them in a company together, naming themselves Mummers had come in to the dwelling place of divers men of honour, and other substantiall persons, and so departed unknowne, whereupon murthers, fellonies, rapes, and other great hurts and inconveniences had aforetime growne, and hereafter were like to come by the colour thereof, if the said disorder should continue not reformed ; for the prevention of which mischiefe, it was enacted; that all Mummers or persons, that should hereafter thus apparell or disguise themselves, or weare, or sell, or keepe any visor in their houses should be imprisoned for 3\. moneths space, without bayle or mainprise, and make a fine and ransome to the King . Yea witnesse the great rebellion of Robert Ket , in 3. of Edward the 6. which as Hollingshead with others record; was plotted and contrived at, and partly occasioned by a meeting at a Stage-play, at Wimonham, to which the Country people resorting, they were by the instigation of one Iohn Flowerdew, first incouraged to pull downe the Inclosures, and then to rebell . The Statutes of 14. Eliz. cap . 5. of 39\. Eliz. c . 4. & 1\. Iacobi. cap . 7. which make common Players of Enterludes, Rogues and Vacabonds, subiecting them to a severe punishment for their lewde manner of life ; doe likewise recite: That by meanes of these common Enterlude Players, and such other Rogues, Vacabonds, and Sturdy-beggers, there daily hapned in the Realme of England and Wales, many horrible murthers, thefts, and other great outrages, to the high displeasure of Almighty God, and to the great anoy of the Common-weale : which these Statutes endeavour to suppresse. Not to mention either Petrarch. De Remedio Utriusque Fortun ae. lib . 1. Dialog . 30. or the Author of the 3\. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters , who informes us; That he hath sometimes seene two Knaves at once importunate upon one light Huswife, whereby much quarrell hath growne to the disquieting of many : Nor yet to recite the late Statute of 1. Caroli. cap . 1. which informes us: that many quarrels, blood-sheds, and other great inconveniences have growne by the resort and concourse of people going out of their owne parishes to Beare- bayting, Bull-bayting, Enterludes, Common-playes, and such disordered and unlawfull exercises and pastimes : (a sufficient confirmation of my Minors truth.) Our owne experience can sufficiently informe us; that Playes and Play-houses are the frequent causes of many murthers, duels, quarrels, debates, occasioned, sometimes by reason of some difference about a box, a seate, or place upon the Stage: sometimes, by intruding to boldly into some females company: sometimes, by reason of some amorous, scurrilous or disgracefull words that are uttered of, or to some female Spectators; sometimes, by reason of some speeches or passages of the Play particularly applyed to some persons present or absent: sometimes, by reason of some Husbands, Whore-masters, or corrivals iealousie , or affront, whose Wife, whose Whore, or Mistris being there in person, is perchance sollicited, abused, or jeared at in his presence: sometimes by reason of the Apprentises resort to Play-houses, especially on Shrove-tuesday; sometimes by meanes of other accidents and occasions. Many have beene the murthers, more the quarrels, the duels that have growne from our Stage-playes, whose large encomiums of rash valour, duels, fortitude, generosity, impaciency, homicides, tyranny and revenge, doe so exasperate mens raging passions, and make them so impatient of the very smallest injury, that nothing can satisfie, can expiate it but the offenders blood. Hence is it that some Players, some Play-haunters now living, not satified with the murther of one, have embrued their barbarous unchristian hands in the blood of two, of three, if not of foure severall men ; and so farre are they from ruing the odiousnesse of these their bloody deeds, that they glory in the number of their murthers as the very trophies of their valour. Pitty is it, that such savage homicides who rest not with the first mans death, should ever live to slay a second , much lesse a third: Yea pitty is it that such Playes, such Spectacles should be suffred, which thus animate men on to quarrels, duels, contentions, injuries, impaciency, bloodshed, and most unchristian revenge. As therefore the Fathers, Christians, with some Pagan Authors, did generally condemne; and good Christian Emperours utterly take away all bloody Sword-playes, Cirque-playes, Chariot-playes, and such like barbarous inhumane Spectacles; by reason of the murthers, blood-shed, quarrels, contentions, tumults, debates, and such like savage unchristian effects which they occasioned ; so likewise may we now suppresse, condemne, and quite abolish Stage-playes upon the selfesame grounds, as the fore-quoted Authors and Pagan Emperours have done before us. Wherefore I shall briefly close up this Scene with this 36. Play-confounding Argument. That which is an ordinary occasion of much cruelty, quarrelsomenesse, impaciency, fiercenesse, implacablenesse, and revenge: of many tumults, seditions, quarrels, murthers, injuries, brawles, and such like barbarous unchristian effects, must needs be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians, (who should be men of peace, of meekenesse, willing to suffer, to passe by, if not to pardon wrongs :) intolerable in any Christian or peacecable Common- weale. But such are Stage-playes, as is manifest by the premises. Therefore they must needs be sinfull, unlawfull unto Christians; intolerable in any Christian or peaceable Common-weale. The 11 fruit of popular Stage-playes, is this; that they fill mens mouthes with idle, frothie, scurrilous, lewde, prophane discourses, complements, Histories, Songs, Iests, which are odious unto God, yea execrable to all chaste, all modest Christians . Stage-playes are the Lectures , the Marts, the common treasuries of all ribaldry, scurrility, prophanesse; which furnish their Actors, their Auditors with such plentifull variety of corrupt, irreligious, atheisticall, unchristian and gracelesse discourses, which they communicate to others upon all occasions, that they scarce ever speake of holy things. This Ovid himselfe confesseth; informing us; that men sing those ribaldrous songs, and utter those amorous verses, discourses at home, which they have learned at the Play-house . What Seneca writes of the words of flatterers and lewde companions, I may well apply to Actors. Their speeches doe much hurt. For if they doe men no present harme, yet they leave the seeds of evill in their mindes, and an evill afterwards to arise, followes them even then when as they are departed from them. For as those who heare some pleasant consort carry away with them the sweetnesse of the song in their eares, which hinders their thoughts, and suffers them not to be intent upon serious things: so the obscenities of Stage-players ( which men are aptest to remember, as most agreeable to their lusts, where as they are extraordinary forgetfull of all the good they heare) sticke longer by men then whiles they heare them. Neither is it an easie matter to shake their pleasant sound out of their mindes: for it followes them, it stayes with them, and recoiles backe againe into their mindes and tongues after some little space. Therefore the eares are to be kept shut against such evill speeches, and that verily against the very first: for when they have made a beginning and gotten entrance, they will make a further attempt. Lactantius , Chrysostome , Clemens Alexandrinus , and BB. Babington informe us; That Play-haunters carry away with them the Id aeaes and similitudes of the lewde representations they behold in Stage-playes, which sinke deepe into their mindes; that they sucke in the venome of Stage-playes with great delight, & practise the speeches, the convayances of love, which there they see and learne: And having once polluted their speech with the language of the Theater; (for I will never , writes BB. Babington, call it polishing,) they are never better then when they have company to bestow their tales, and Stage-greetings upon : And for this reason among others, they dislike of Stage-playes. As these recited Authors, so our owne experience can suffragate to the truth of this effect: For who so vaine, so frothie, so prophane, so atheisticall, blasphemous, lascivious, scurrilous; who lesse holy, gracious, or edifying in their ordinary discourses, then Players and Play-haunters? whose tongues are tipt with oathes, execrations, ribaldry, lascivious tales, amorous songs, wanton histories, unseemely jests, adulterous insinuations, invective taunts and scoffes against holinesse, sobriety, chastity, modesty, grace, and goodnesse; with the very language of the Stewes, of Atheists, of Pagans, not of Christians. Seldome shall you heare from such mens mouthes any religious discourses, any conference of God, of Christ, of the Scriptures, of grace, of glory, of practical divinity, of sin, of faith, of repentance, of the meanes or signes of grace and salvation, any praysing or blessing of God for his mercy to us in his Sonne; any bewayling of their owne sinfull conditions, or of their slavery under sinne: any exhortation unto goodnesse; any dissuations from any sinne; or the like; the principall things that Christians should conferre off : Their tongues are so accustomed to the theames, the flattering Eloquence, and phrases of the Theater; so taken up with the relations of the things they heare or see at Stage-playes; that they cannot relish the language of Canaan, the dialect of Heaven , nor brooke the Scripture phrase, (whose plainesse they deride and scorne :) much lesse can they spare any vacant time to habituate their unholy lips, to season their uncircumcised hearts and eares , with holy conference. It is Gods owne command to Christians: That they should put away all vaine, all evill speaking: that no corrupt communication should proceed out of their mouthes, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may administer grace to the hearers : That fornication and all uncleanesse should not be so much as once named among them, as becommeth Saints: Neither filthinesse, nor foolish talking, nor iesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thankes. That their speech should be alwayes gracious seasoned with salt : And that his words and his Commandements should be alwayes in their hearts; to teach them diligently unto their Children: to talke of them (not of Play-house passages, or such vaine fruitlesse trifles) when they sit in their houses, and when they walke by the way, and when they lie downe, and when they rise up: that they should binde them for a signe upon their hands, and that they should be as frontlets betweene their eyes: and that they should write them upon the posts of their house, and upon their gates ; that so they might meditate and discourse of them day and night upon all occasions . But alas our Stage- playes incorporate themselves so firmely, and sinke so deepe into our Actors and Play-haunters mindes , that they quite invert these sacred precepts; suppressing those heavenly Christian conferences which they command; reviving and advancing those vaine lascivious discourses which they prohibite. This the fore-quoted Authors; this present experience testifie. Wherefore I shall end this Scene with this short Syllogisme, being a 37.Argument against Stage- playes. Those things which banish all holy conferences, all pious discourses out of their Actors and Spectators mouthes, and furnish them with all variety of idle, vaine, unprofitable, lascivious, scurrilous, prophane, atheisticall, irreligious phrases, Play-house conferences, and Stage-discourses, must questionlesse bee unlawfull, yea abominable unto Christians: as the alleadged Scriptures testifie. But this doe Stage-playes; as the premises and experience manifest. Therefore they must questionlesse bee unlawfull, yea abominable unto Christians. The twelfe effect of Stage-playes is this: That they wholy indispose their Actors and Spectators to all religious duties: that they withdraw and keepe them from Gods service: that they bring the Word, the worship, yea all the ordinances of God into contempt; making them vaine and ineffectuall to their soules. First, I say, that Stage-playes indispose men to the acceptable performance of every religious duty; be it prayer, hearing, and reading of Gods Word , receiving the Sacraments, and the like. This sundry Fathers fully testifie: and I would to God all Christians would well weigh their words which much concerne their soules in the very maine of Christianity, to wit, Gods worship, and their vow in baptisme. Tertullian informes us; That Stage-playes defile the eyes, the eares, the soules of the Spectators, and make them to appeare polluted in Gods sight. That none of the things deputed unto Stage-playes are pleasing unto God, or beseeming the servants of God, because they were all instituted for the Devill, and furnished out of the Devils treasury; for every thing that is not of God, or displeasing unto God is of the Devill: Stage-playes they are the pompe of the Devill, against which we have protested in the seale of our faith: That therefore which we renounce, we ought not to participate of neither in deed, nor word, nor sight, nor view. And doe we not then renounce and teare off the seale againe, in cutting off the testimoniall of it? Shall we then desire an answer from the very Heathens themselves? Shall they resolve us, whether it be lawfull for Christians to use Stage-playes? But verily they most of all discerne a man to be a Christian, even from this renouncing of Stage-playes: he therefore doth manifestly deny himselfe to be a Christian, who takes away this badge by which he should be knowne to be a Christian. Now what hope is there remaining in such a one? No man hath revolted unto the enemies Tents, unlesse he first cast away his armes, unlesse he hath first forsaken the colours and allegeance of his Prince, unlesse he hath covenanted to perish together with them. Will he thinke earnestly of God at that time, who is placed where there is nothing at all of God? will he thorowly learne chastity who admires Stage-playes? will he call to minde the exclamations of some prophet, whiles the Tragedians are crying out? will he meditate of a Psalme, who sits amidest effeminating measures? or can he be moved with compassion, who is wholy intent upon the biting of Beares, and the spunges of retiaries? God turne away from all his so great a desire of pernicious pleasure. For what a desperate wicked thing is it, for a man to goe out of the Church of God, into the Chappell of the Devill? out of Heaven (as they say) into the mire and clay? those hands which thou hast lifted up unto the Lord in prayer, to weary afterwards in applauding a Stage-player? out out of the same mouth with which thou hast uttered Amen, to the holy one, to give testimony to a Sword-player? or to say, ( ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif)  ,) for ever and ever, to any one but to God Christ? Why then may not such become liable to the possession of Devils,  &c? For no man can serve two Masters. What hath light to doe with darkenesse? What relation hath life to death  ? we ought to hate these assemblies of Pagans, even because the Name of God is there blasphemed, and because divers temptations are sent out from thence. How wilt thou doe being deprehended at unawares in that over-flowing of impious suffrages; not as though thou shouldest there suffer any thing from men; for no man knoweth thee to be a Christian; but consider seriously, what may be done concerning thee in Heaven. For dost thou doubt but that in the very moment when as thou art in the church of the Devill, all the Angels looke downe from Heaven, and take speciall notice of every one there present; observing who he is that speakes blasphemy, who that heares it, who it is that lends his tongue, his eares to the Devill, against God? Wilt thou not therefore flie these seates of the enemies of Christ, this pestilentiall chaire, and that very aire which hangs over it, adulterated with wicked words and sounds, &c ? Thus he: whose words sufficiently testifie, that Stage-playes indispose men to all religious duties; because they defile their eyes, their eares, their hands, their soules, they being the pompes, the inventions of the Devill which are incompatible with Christianity: because they teare of the very seale and cognisance of their Christianity: and wholy inthrall them to the Devils vassalage. Saint Cyprian writes thus of Stage-playes to the selfesame purpose. What hath the Scripture interdicted? Verily it hath prohibited that to be behold, which it inhibiteth to be acted. I say, it hath condemned all these kindes of spectacles when as it hath taken away Idolatry the mother of all Playes, from whence these Monsters of vanity and levity have proceeded. For what spectacle is there without an Idoll? what Play without a sacrifice, &c? What doth a faithful Christian make among these? if he flieth Idolatry, why doth he speake it? he who is now holy, can he reape pleasure from criminous things? Why approves he superstitions against God, which he affecteth whiles that he beholds them? But let him know, that all these are the inventions of Devils, not of God. He impudently exorcizeth Devils in the Church, whose pleasures he applaudes in Stage-playes: and when as by renouncing him once, every thing of his was pared off in Baptisme; whiles that after Christ (I pray observe it all you Christians who resort to Stage- playes) he resorteth to the spectacles of the Devill, he renounceth Christ as if he were a Devill. Idolatry, as I have already said, is the Mother of all Playes, which that it may allure faithfull Christians to it, flatters them with the pleasure of the eyes and eares . Romulus did first of all consecrate Cirque-playes to Consus, as to the God of Counsell, for the Sabines that were to be ravished. But other Stage-playes were procured at the intreatie of the people, when as a famine and pestilence had seised upon the Citty, and these were afterwards dedicated to Ceres, to Bacchus, and to other Idols and dead men. These Grecian combates, either in songs, in musicall Instruments, in voyces, or in strength , have divers Devils for their Presidents: and what ever else there is, which either affects the eyes, or pleaseth the eares of the beholders, if its orignall or instituters be sought after, hath either an Idoll, a Devill, or a dead man for the Father of it. Thus the cunning Devill, because he knew that naked Idolatry by it selfe would be aborred, hath mixed it with Stage-playes and spectacles, that so thorow pleasure it might be beloved. What need I prosecute this any further ? If thou aske a Play-haunter, what are the parts of a Christian, he knoweth not, or else he is so much the more unhappy, that he knoweth: If I should againe demand of him, by what way he came to that spectacle; he will confesse through the Brothel-house, through the naked bodies of prostituted Harlots , through the common Stewes, through publike shame, through vulgar lasciviousnesse, through the common reproach of all. To whom that I may not obiect, that which perchance he hath committed, yet he hath seene that which was not to be committed, and hath led his eyes though lust to the spectacles of Idolatry: daring, if he had beene able, to carry the Holy Ghost along with him into a Brothel-house; who hastning to a Stage-play, as soone as he is dismissed the Church, and whiles he carrieth the Eucharist about him, as he hath wont to doe; hath brought it among the obscene bodies of Whores; deserving more damnation from the pleasure of the spectacle. These so vaine, so pernicious, so sacrilegious Playes and spectacles are to be avoyded of all Christians, as we have already oft-times said; and both our eyes and eares are to be kept from them, &c . If then the Scripture prohibites the acting, the seeing of Stage-playes; as being the invention of the Devill; the parts, the issues of Idolatry: If those who resort to Playes renounce Christ Iesus himselfe, as if he were a Devill; if they doe as much as in them lies, even carry the holy Ghost himselfe; and the very Sacrament of Christs Body and Blood into a Play-house; and so prophane them in the highest manner, as this Father testifies: no wonder is it, if Playes unqualifie men for holy duties. Isiodor Hispalensis , and H Rabanus Maurus , discoursing of Cirques, of Theaters, of Cirque-playes, and Stage- playes, write thus of them: that uncleane Deities possesse them. Therefore O Christian, let this be a strange place to thee, which many spirits of Satan have taken possession of. For the Devill and his Angels have filled it all up. For the spectacles of cruelty, and the inspection of vanity were not ordained onely by the vices of men, but likewise by the commands of Devils. Therefore a Christian ought to have nothing to doe with the madnesse of the Circus, with the uncleanesse of the Theater, with the cruelty of the Amphitheater, with the barbarousnesse of the Arena, with the luxury of the Play. For he denieth God (a terrible sentence worthy all Players, all Play-haunters saddest considerations) who presumeth to act or see such things: being made a Prevaricator of the Christian faith, who againe desires that which he hath long since renounced in his baptisme; that is, the Devill, his pompes, and workes . And is such a desperate Play- haunter, thinke you, fit or able to serve, to please the Lord, or to performe any holy duty to him in a holy manner? Olympiodorus in his Enarration upon the 4\. of Ecclesiastes, Keepe thy feete when as thou entrest into the house of God , is pregnant to our purpose. Keepe thy feete, &c . That is, saith he; Let us not abuse to evill, those very instruments which we use in good: as if he should say; Doe not, I beseech thee. goe to Stage-playes and obscene Spectacles with the same feete wherewith thou frequentest the Temple of God. Vnderstand that the same likewise is to be done of the other members of the body. And truely those who will goe to the Church of God with an undefiled foote, ought altogether to with-hold themselves from wicked and prophane places, as being contrary unto God . Therefore those who frequent Play-houses can never serve God as they ought if this Father may be credited. S. Augustine writing against Stage-playes, and those Devill-Idols that were both honoured and delighted with them, informes us: that Christians in his time, had utterly abandoned all Stage-playes ; and that no filthy, no wicked thing was propounded to be seene or imitated, where either the precepts of the true God were insinuated, or his miracles declared, or his gifts praysed, or his benefits craved. That when Christianity came up, the Play-houses almost thorow all Citties fell downe; they being the very dens of filthinesse, and the publike professions of wicked persons: whereupon the Pagans complained, that the Christian times were evill times: And whence is it , (writes he) that the Play-houses fall downe, but through want of those things by whose lascivious and sacrilegious use they are supported? Did not their Cicero when as he commended one Roscius a Stage-player, say, that he was so skilfull, that he onely was worthy to come upon the Stage: that he was so good a man, that he onely was worthy not to come upon it? shewing most plainely nothing else; but that the Stage is so filthy, that by so much the lesse a man ought to be there, by how much the more he is a good man: and yet their gods were attoned with such dishonesty, as he thought ought fit to be removed from good men . But most punctuall is that in his lib . 4. De Symbolo ad Catechumenos. cap . 1. Tom . 9. pars 1\. pag . 1427. 1428 where he writes thus. Thou art deprehended and detected O Christian when as thou doest one thing, and professest another: being faithfull in name, and shewing the contrary in deed; not keeping the faith of thy promise: one whiles entring into the Church to poure out prayers, and a very little while after comming into a Play-house to cry out dishonestly with Staye-players. What hast thou to doe with the pompes of the Devill which thou hast renounced? Why doe you halt with both hoofes? If God be God, follow him: if the world be God, follow it. If God be chosen, let him be served according to his will: if the world be chosen, to what end is the heart feined, as it were fitted for God ? What hast thou to doe with the pompes of the Devill, who professest thy selfe a lover of Christ? Doe not deceive thy selfe, for God hates such persons, neither doth he repute those among his professors, whom he seeth to be the forsakers of his way . All which is a sufficient evidence, that Stage-playes wholy indispose men to the true worship of God. Salvian Bishop of Marselles , is very copious in this theame. We say (writes he) God hath forsaken us, when in very deed we forsake God. For suppose we, that the Lord will respect us, not deserving his favour? let us see if he can. Loe infinite thousands of Christians daily abide at the shewes of unseemely things. Can God then favour such kinde of persons? Can God cast his gracious countenance upon such as rage in Cirques, and commit adultery in Theaters? Or is this our meaning, or doe we thinke it meete, that for as much as God seeth us in Cirques and Theaters, that what things we see he beholdeth; and what filthinesse we behold, he seeth it also for company? For one of these must needs be: for if he vouchsafe to looke upon us, it followes, that he must behold all these things where we are: or if, which is most true, he turne away his eyes from these things , he must likewise turne away his countenance from us who are there. And the case standing thus, yet neverthelesse, we doe these things which I have said, and that without ceasing. Or thinke we that God hath his Theaters and Cirques, as had the gods of the Gentiles. For thus did they in old time, because they were perswaded that their Idols delighted in them: but how is it that we doe so, who are certaine that our God detesteth them? Or verily if we know that these abominations doe please God, I will not gainsay but we may resort unto them continually. But if it be in our conscience, that God abhorreth, that he detesteth; that God is offended as the Devill is fed by Theaters ; how say we that we worship God in the Church, who alwayes serve the Devill in the obscenity of Playes, and that wittingly and willingly, out of deliberation and set purpose? And what hope I pray you, shall we have with God, who not ignorantly, or at unawares offend him; but after the example of those Giants heretofore, whom we read to have attempted Heaven with their mad endeavours, and as it were to have marched forwards against the clouds? So we through the iniuries which all the world over we continually commit, doe as it were oppugne Heaven with a common consent. To Christ therefore, O monstrous madnesse! even to Christ doe we offer Cirques and Stage-playes; yea and even then especially when as we receive any goodnesse from his hands, when any prosperity is bestowed upon us by him, or when as God hath given us any victory over our enemies? And what else by this doe we shew our selves to doe, but even to be like the man who is iniurious to the person who hath done him good; who rayles upon him that speakes him faire, or strikes him over the face with a sword that kisseth him. For I aske the great and rich men of this world, of what offence is that servant guilty which wisheth ill to a good and gracious Master; which rayleth on him that deserveth well, and rendreth dispitefull words for his good received? without controversie all men will iudge him a most hainous offender, who rendreth evill for good to him, to whom indeed he might not render evill for evill. Thus verily doe even we who are called Christians, we stirre up a mercifull God against us by our uncleanesse; we offend a gracious God by our filthinesse, and we wound a loving God by our wickednesse. To Christ therefore, O monstrous madnesse! even to Christ doe we offer Cirquers and Stage-playes; to Christ doe we render for his benefits the filthinesse of Theaters; even to Christ doe we sacrifice the oblation of most base sports. As though our Saviour, who for us became man, had taught us thus to doe: As though he had preached this either by himselfe, or by his Apostles: As though that for this end he had taken upon him the shame of mans nativity, and the contumelious beginnings of an earthly generation: As though for this end he had layen in a manger, at what time notwithstanding the very Angels ministred unto him: As if for this purpose he would be swadled in ragges of cloth, who did governe Heaven in his cloutes: As though for this end he had hung upon the Crosse, at whose hanging the whole world was astonished : Who for your sakes ( saith the Apostle ) when he was rich, became poore, that yee through his poverty might be made rich. And being ( saith he ) in the forme of God hee humbled himselfe to the death, even the death of the Crosse. Even this did Christ teach us when he suffred these things for our sakes. Well doe we requite his passion, who receiving through his death redemption, leade a most filthy life. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men, saith blessed Paul , and teacheth us, that we should deny ungodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and that we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the mighty God and of our Saviour Iesus Christ; who gave himselfe for us that he might redeeme us from all iniquity, and purifie us a peculiar people to himselfe zealous of good workes. Where be they who doe these things, for which the Apostle saith, that Christ came? where be they who flie the desires of this world? where be they which live godly and righteously, that looke for this blessed hope by well doing; and leading a pure life; shewing thereby that they looke and long for the Kingdome of God: where be such ? Our Lord Iesus Christ came ( saith he ) that he might purifie us a pecular people to himselfe, zealous of good workes. Where is that pure people? that peculiar people; that good people; that people of holinesse ? Christ (saith the Scriptures) suffred for us, leaving us an ensample, that wee should follow his steps: And we follow the steps of our Saviour in Cirques, and in Theaters; as if our Saviour had left us such an example, whom we read to have wept, but that he laughed we never read. And both these for our sakes: because weeping is a pricking of the heart, laughter a corruption of manners. Therefore saith he ; Woe to you that laugh, for yee shall waile and weepe. And , blessed are yee that weepe now, for yee shall laugh. But it is not enough for us to laugh and be merry, unlesse we reioyce with sinne and madnesse, unlesse our laughter be tempered with filthinesse, and mixed with impiety. What error I say is this, or what folly? Cannot we daily be merry and laugh, unlesse we make our laughter and mirth to be wickednesse? Or else thinke we simple mirth to be nothing worth? and can we not laugh except we sinne? What a mischiefe is this, or what furie? Let us laugh I pray you and be merry so we sinne not. What foolishnesse, nay madnesse is it, to thinke mirth and ioy nothing worth, unlesse God be iniured thereby? yea iniured, and that most hainously. For in Stage-playes there is a certaine Apostasie from the faith, and a deadly declining from our beliefe and the heavenly Sacraments, &c . as in pag. 51. 52. before. And what else is it but to fall into destruction, to foregoe the beginning of life? For where the foundation of the Creed is overthrowne, life it selfe is destroyed. Then againe we must needs returne unto that which we have often said: What such thing is there among the Barbarians? Where be any Stages or Theaters among them? where is the wickednesse of diverse impurities, to wit, the destruction of our hope and salvation? Which Playes notwithstanding if they being Pagans did use, they should erre with lesse offence to God: because albeit such doing were a defiling of the sight, yet were it not a violation of the Sacrament. But now what can we say for our selves? we hold the Creed, and yet overturne it: we confesse the duty of salvation, and yet deny it too. And therefore where is our Christianity? who as it seemeth have received the Sacrament of salvation to no other purpose, but that afterwards we might more hainously offend. We preferre pastimes before the Church: we despise the Lords Table and honour Theaters: in a word, we love all things, reverence all things, God alone seemeth vile unto us in comparison of all other things, &c . By which large discourse of this pious Father, it is most apparant: That Stage-playes overturne mens faith and religion; annihilate their baptisme; estrange their hearts and affections from Gods service, and wholy indispose them to his worship. Gregory Nyssen informes us: That God neither heares nor regards the prayers of those qui in Theatris faustas acclamationes affectant,  &c. who affect applauses in Theaters, and delight in Stage-playes. Gregory Nazianzen , demanding this question, unto what manner of persons he should discourse of divine things? makes this reply; that it must be to those who would lay them seriously to heart; and not to such who handle them slightly, as one thing onely of many for pleasure and contentment sake, after Cirque-playes, after Stage-playes, after songs, after gluttony and carnall copulation: Intimating unto us ; that those who delight in Stage-playes and such like Spectacles are altogether unfit to heare Gods Word, or seriously to performe any holy duty; their mindes being so preposessed with Playes and thoughts of vanity, after their returne from Play- houses, that they can never bend them to pious exercises in that diligent manner as they ought. And therefore he records of the Citizens of Constantinople , who delighted much in Stage-playes: That as they reputed Cirques and Stage-playes, so they likewise esteemed the divine misteries themselves, to be but a pastime . Saint Chrysostome in his forequoted Homilies , is exceeding copious in this theame; where he informes us; that Stage-playes so pollute the eyes, the eares, the hearts of the Actors and Spectators, that they make them altogether unfit to approach into Gods holy presence, or to tread within the porch, the doores of his holy Temple, much more unfit to participate of his most sacred Body and Blood, (which must not be lodged in a polluted soule) or to heare his pure Word; which eares defiled, or rather putrified and stopped up with filthy Stage-playes, can never seriously attend too. His fore-alleadged words to this purpose , are so emphaticall and flexanimous, that they might even move an heart of Adamant, and cause the most obdurat Stage-haunters for to tremble. If wee adde to this, the constant practise of the Primitive Church, who excommunicated all Stage- players and Play-haunters both from the Word, the Sacraments and all Christian society as altogether unworthy to participate of either; refusing to admit of any Actors or others into the Church till they quite abandoned, not onely the acting, but the very sight and hearing of Stage-playes, and openly promised and professed, never to returne unto them more : Or if wee againe consider; that Stage-players, with those who married Woman-actors were utterly uncapable of any Ecclesiasticall Orders, and perpetually disabled to administer either the Word or Sacraments to Gods people, by reason of that inexpiable steine which the very acting of Stage-playes had engrained on them : Wee must needs acknowledge, that the acting and beholding of Stage-playes indispose men to Gods service, and unfit them for his holy ordinances: else why should the Church excommunicate or exclude these persons, or thus disable them in so strict a manner? Moreover those sundry Councels and Authors, which debar all Clergie men from the acting and beholding of Stage-playes, either in publike or private, lest their eyes, their eares and hearts, set apart, and consecrated to Gods holy mysteries, should be defiled by them, and so indispose them to discharge their ministeriall function ; are a most pregnant evidence of this irrefragable truth; that Stage-playes disable men from the right performance of all holy duties. And no wonder. For first they disteine the soule with the filth, and involue it in the guilt of divers sins ; which makes it odious in the eyes of God; Who as he can indure no iniquity; so he regards no worship, no duties of piety, no prayers that proceed from polluted hearts. God will be worshipped onely in the beauties of holinesse; with cleane hands and pure hearts : Whence hee commands all his, to cleanse themselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holinesse in his feare : to wash their heart from wickednesse that they may be saved: and not so much as to touch any uncleane thing, that so he may receive them. God will be sanctified of all those that come neere him; he will have them to be holy in all manner of conversation, even as he is holy, that so they may be a holy Priest-hood, to offer up spirituall sacrifices of prayer and praise, acceptable unto him through Iesus Christ; whose blood doth cleanse them from all their sinnes , presenting them pure and holy in his Fathers sight without spot or bleemish . Now Stage-playes, as I have formerly proved , universally defile the very bodies and soules of men, overspredding them with a leprosie of sundry sinnes , (which they either ingenerate or infuse into their soules, (which eclipse Gods grace and favour from them , stopping up his eares against all their prayers, and sending up an unsavary stinke into his sacred nostrels : therefore they must of necessity disable them to all holy duties. Secondly, it is impossible for any man to serve two different Masters both together, to serve God and Mammon, Christ and the Devill : God in the Church, the Devill in the Play-house: Christ in the morning, the Devill in the evening. He who serves Satan all the weeke in the Stage or Play-house, can never worship Christ upon the Lords day in the Temple. Alas, there was never yet such fellowship between Christ and Beliall, betweene the renounced pompes and vanities of Satan, and the humility of our super-celestiall Saviour, that men might serve and follow them both together . Now Stage-playes are the very Devils owne peculiar pompes, Play- houses his Synagogues ; Players, his professed Masse-priests and Choristers; Play-haunters his devoted servants, as himselfe professeth , and Origen , with others, largely prove: Those therefore who thus serve the Devill in Playes and Play-houses; its impossible for them to serve the Lord sincerely in prayers and Churches. Thirdly, No man can drinke the Cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils; nor yet partake of the Lords Table, and of the table of Devils: But Stage-playes , are the cup and table of Devils; the very Devils meate; his drinke ; those dishes and repasts wherewith he was solemnely feasted by his idolatrous worshippers, in his owne Idoll-temples . It is not possible therefore for any Christian to feed his eyes, his eares with these diabolicall banqvets, and yet worthily to participate of Christs Body and Blood, the spirituall Sweet-meates of a Christian soule. Fourthly, the very acting and beholding of Stage-playes drawes downe a selfe-condemning guiltinesse, and so by consequent a certaine secret terror of appearing in Gods presence , on mens soules. There is scarce a man of any grace or ingenuity, but would even blush and feare to be deprehended by any good man at a Play-house: Yea the very Heathen Romanes stood so much in awe of Cato his vice-condemning presence: that they durst not call for their Floralian Enterludes whiles he was neere the Theater . And will not the consideration of Gods all-seeing presence, thinke yee, strike much more feare into the hearts and consciences of such who are deprehended by him at lewde lascivious Stage-playes, then any Christians, any Catoes eye or face , could strike into these Heathen Romans; which have no such soule- confounding Majestie in them as is in the very smallest frowne of God? If therefore those who resort to Stage-playes by reason of their selfe-convincing conscience, can never approach with boldnesse to Gods Throne of Grace ; its certaine they cannot serve or worship him as they ought. Fiftly, hee who perjures himselfe in the highest degree, breaking that very origall covenant which he made to God at first in Baptisme, and afterward ratified at every receiving of the Sacrament, can never questionlesse serve the Lord in any acceptable pious manner : the performance of this vow and covenant (at least- wise in the desire the endeavour of his soule) being that alone which makes him a Christian; and so a man capable of serving God. But he who acts or resorts to Stage-playes, violates that very originall covenant which he made to God at first in baptisme, and afterwards reconfirmed at every receiving of the Sacrament; as I have else-where largely proved: therefore he can never serve the Lord in any acceptable or gracious manner, according to his will. And alas what Christian is there, who would frequent or harbour any such sinfull pleasures, as will quite disable him to serve his God, to please his blessed Saviour, who bath bought him even at the dearest rate ? What contentment can a man take in any thing; in all the riches, honours, pleasures, contentments of this world, whiles his soule can draw no comfort, no heavenly refreshment from his God? Better can the inferiour world subsist without the light and influence of the Sunne, or the body of a man without the heart, then the soule of any Christian without the satisfactory soule-inlivening presence of his God, his Saviour, which is never found but in those broken humble spirits, who serve him in syncerity, and tremble at his Word . As therefore we ever desire to please, to serve our blessed God according to his will; or to enjoy the heart-ravishing consolations of his most blisfull presence; let us presently abandon Stage-playes, which as they hinder us in the service, so they utterly deprive us of the face and favour of our God, which are able to make us more then happy in the middest of all our deepest miseries. The pleasures, the refreshments that men reape from Stage-playes, as they shut out better contents, so they abide no longer then the Playes are acting , (and sometimes scarce so long) and then they oft- times leave a sting behinde them, which gaules and prickes the soule for ever after. If then that love of Christ which constrained holy Paul, to bid adue to all carnall pleasures , will not enforce us to say thus to Stage- playes: as David sometimes did to his lewde companions; Depart from me yee wicked, yee workers (yee producers) of iniquity, for I will keepe the Comandements of my God ; yet let the comfort that Gods service wil bring unto our soules, and this consideration joyned with it; that we cannot serve God with any syncerity of heart, as long as we delight in cursed Stage-playes , now at last enforce us to bid this farewell to them, that so we may be enabled to please that holy blessed God, who created, redeemed us at first, and hath evermore preserved us since, that we might doe him service . Secondly, as Stage-playes indispose men to, so they likewise withdraw and keep them from Gods service, especially on Lords-dayes, Holy- dayes, and solemne Festivals; which should be wholy and onely consecrated to his more speciall worship; and spent in duties of devotion, in lawding and blessing him for his more speciall favours . And doth not our owne experience beare witnesse to this truth? Are not our Play-houses oft-times more crowded, more coached and frequented then many of our Churches? and are they not full oft-times, when our Churches are but empty? Are there not many hundreds serving the Devill daily in our Theaters, even then when as they should be serving God in his Temples? Doe not more commonly resort to Playes, then Lectures, which is ill? yea doe not too too many neglect to come to Sermons, that they may runne to Stage-playes, which is worse? Indeed our Church of England (out of the great respect it yeelds to Preaching, and the absolute necessity of it to salvation) enioynes God-fathers and God-mothers, to call upon their God-children, to heare Sermons ; (which some prophane ones now begin to loath and speake against, as if we had too much preaching:) that so they may the better forsake the Devill and all his workes, mortifie all their unholy corrupt affections, and daily proceed in all vertue and godlinesse of living . Yea the Saints of God in ancient times, were quickning and calling upon one another in this manner: O come let us sing unto the Lord, let us make a ioyfull noyse unto the Rocke of our Salvation. Let us come before his presence with Thankesgiving, and make a ioyfull noyse unto him with Psalmes, &c. O come let us worship and fall downe and kneele before the Lord our maker ? O sing unto the Lord a new Song, sing unto the Lord all the earth. Sing unto the Lord; blesse his Name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. Declare his goodnesse among the Heathen, his wonders among all people. Give unto the Lord (O yee Kindreds of the people;) give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name; bring Offring and come into his Courts. O worship the Lord in the beauty of holinesse, feare before him all the earth : Come yee, and let us goe up to the Mountaine of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Iacob, and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes, &c . But now alas in stead of calling upon one another to heare Sermons, and of these encouragements to goe up to the house of the Lord to blesse and prayse his Name (which is now no better then a brand of Puritanisme) we heare nought else among many who professe themselves Christians; but, come let us goe and see a Stage-play: let us heare such or such an Actor; or resort to such and such a Play-house : (and I would I might not say unto such a Whore or Whore-house;) where we will laugh and be merry, and passe away the afternoone : As for any resort to such or such a Lecture, Church, or pious Preacher; its a thing they seldome thinke, much lesse discourse of. Alas, that any who professe themselves Christians should be thus strangly, (that I say not atheistically) infatuated, as to forsake the most sacred Oracles, the soule-saving Word, the most blessed Sacraments, house and presence of their God; to runne to Playes and Play-houses, the abominable Spectacles, Lectures, Pompes, and Snogogues of the Devill : as thus to leave the pathes of uprightnesse, to walke in the wayes of darknesse; reioycing to doe evill, and delighting in the frowardnesse of the wicked ; even then when as they should solace their very soules in God. Yet this is the most desperate deplorable condition of many hundred prophane ones in this age of light; who admire who respect the very basest Stage-playes, more then the devoutest gravest Preachers; and would rather heare the most lascivious Comedy, then the best soule searching Sermon: their very practise proclaiming as much unto the world (if not their words;) they being oftner weekely in the Play-house then in the Church; reading over three Play-bookes at the least, for every Sermon, for every Booke or Chapter in the Bible. O that the execrable sinfulnesse of this prodigious profanesse would now at last awake us! then those who thinke a Stage-playe once a day (at leastwise three aweeke) too little, a Sermon once or twice a weeke, a moneth, too much; would change their tune for shame ; thinking one Play a yeere to much, one Sermon a weeke, a moneth to little for Christians, concluding in the words of that blessed Martyr of our Church, Iohn Hooper Bishop of Glocester (who constantly preached in his Dioces most times twice, or at leastwise once every day thorowout the weeke without faile ) in the Confession and protestation of his Faith, Dedicated to King Edward the sixt, and the whole House of Parliament, in the yeere of our Lord , 1550. where we writes thus. What Realme soever will avoyd the evill of Sedition and contempt of Godly Lawes, let them provide the Word of God, to be diligently and truely preached; and taught unto the Subjects and Members thereof . The lacke of it is the cause of sedition and trouble, as Salomon saith ; Where Prophecy wanteth, the people are dissipated. Wherefore I cannot a little wonder at the opinion and doctrine of such, as say, a Sermon ONCE IN A VVEEKE, IN A MONETH, OR IN A QVARTER OF A YEERE, is sufficient for the people. Truely it is injuriously and evill spoken against the glory of God and the salvation of the people. But seeing they will not be in the whole as good unto God as before they have beene unto the Devill, neither so glad to remove false doctrine from the people, and to continue them in the true; where as they did before occupie the most part of the forenoone, the most part of the afternoone, yea and a great part of the night, to keepe the estimation and continuance of dangerous and vaine superstitions, were it much now to occupie ONE HOVRE IN THE MORNING, AND ANOTHER HOVRE TOVVARDS NIGHT, to occupie the people with true and earnest prayer unto God in Christs Blood, and in preaching the true Doctrine of Christ, that they might know and continue in the true Religion, and faithfull confidence of Christ Iesu? Fifteene Masses in a Church daily were not too many for the Priests of Baal; and SHOVLD ONE Sermon every day be TOO MVCH FOR A GODLY Bishop, And Evangelicall Preacher? I wonder how it can be too much opened unto the people? If any man say, labour is lost, and mens businesse lyeth undone by that meanes. Surely it is ungodly spoken: for those that beare the people in hand of such a thing, knoweth right well, that there was neither labours, cares, needs, necessity, nor any things else, that heretofore could keepe them from hearing of Masse, though it had beene said at 4\. a clocke in the morning. Therefore as farre as I see, people were content to lose more labour, and spent more time then to goe to the Devill, then now to come to God : (as our common Players and Play-haunters doe.) But my faith is, that both Master and Servant shall find gaine thereby at the yeeres and ;  THOVGH THEY HEARE MORNING Sermon ,  AND MORNING PRAYERS EVERY DAY OF THE VVEEKE . Thus farre this reverend Bishop, whose words and practise I would the grosse and shamelesse perverters of his doctrine in the points now controverted, (he being a professed Anti-Arminian , and Anti-Pelagian , and that in terminis, as his printed Workes most positively demonstrate, however some pervert them :) together with our constant Play-haunters would now seriously consider: especially in these our dayes; wherein Stage-playes almost cry down Sermons, and Play-books finde so quicke a sale, that (if Stationers doe not misinforme me) there are at least a dozen Play-bookes vented for one printed Sermon: so that I may safely affirme, that Stage-playes exceedingly withdraw and keepe men from Gods service: especially on Lords-dayes, Holi-dayes, and solemne Festivals, set apart for better purposes : which experimentall truth is so visible to the eyes, the consciences of all men, that it needs no further proofe. If any man be so uncredulous as not to believe experience, let him then attend to sundry Councels, Fathers, and other moderne Authors, who affirme: that Stage-playes withdraw men from the Church, and keepe them from Gods service, especially on Lords-dayes, Holi-dayes, and solemne Festivals which were set apart for pious exercises. For Councels, See the 4. Councell of Carthage, Canon 88\. with sundry others here recited. Act 7\. Scene 3\. For Fathers, Clemens Romanus, in the 2\. Booke of Apostolicall Constitutions. cap . 64. 65. complaines; That many leaving the Congregation of the Faithfull, with the Church and Lawes of God, did runne to the Playes of the Grecians, and hasten unto Theaters, desiring to be numbred among those who resorted thither, and to be made partakers of filthy, that I say not abominable wards and spectacles: neither doe they heare the Prophet Ieremy, saying : Lord I have not sate in the assembly of Players or Mockers, but I was afraid at the sight of thy hand: nor Iob, who speakes the like words, &c. Clemens Alexandrinus , in his 3. Booke of the Padagoge. cap . 11. fol . 52. 53. complaines; That divers after they are departed from the Church, laying aside that divine inspiration which was in it, assimulate themselves to the company in which they are; or rather laying aside the false and counterfeit visour of gravity, they are found to be such, as they were before unknowne to be; and when as they have reverenced that Word which was spoken of God, they leave it where they heard it, running unto Play-houses, the chaire of pestilence; and delighting themselves abroade with wicked measures and amorous songs; being filled with the noyse of pipes, with clapping of hands, with drunkennesse, with all kinde of filth and dirt. But whiles they chaunt and rechaunt this; those who before did celebrate and extoll immortality, doe at last wickedly sing, that most pernicious palinody; Let us eate and drindke, for to morrow we shall die. But they not to morrow, but even now already are truely dead to God, burying their dead, that is, interring themselves in death, &c . A dreadfull speech, which I would our Dancers, Play-haunters, and voluptuous persons would lay neere their hearts. Saint Augustine informes us; That voluptuous Playes and Spectacles oft-times withdraw men from the Assemblies of the Church: and That the whole City of Rome did with publike eyes and eares, learne those alluring criminous fables, and those ignominious deeds which were wickedly and filthily fained of their Idol-gods, and more filthily, more wickedly committed by them, neglecting in the meane time better things . Saint Chrysostome in sundry of his Homilies complaines: That men did oft-time leave the Church and runne to Playes; preferring Stage- play-meetings before the Church Assemblies, and chusing rather to see an Harlot or Player in the Theater, then the Body and Blood of Christ himselfe in the Church. Pope Leo the first laments. That Stage-playes, and unruly Spectacles were more frequented then the blessed solemnities of the Martyrs . Saint Asterius , in his Homily against the Feast of the Kalends , complaines: That many preferring their vaine Stage-playes, pleasures, and imployments, absented themselves from the Church, and holy Sermons on Festivals and Holi-dayes, and on the Feast of Kalends. Alas for griefe (writes Cyril Arch-bishop of Alexandria) very many among us Christians imitate this madnesse and dishonesty of the Iewes: who upon Holi-dayes and solemne Festivals giving themselves over to dishonest Playes, to drunkennesse, to dancing, or other vanities of the world; when as they ought to serve God more diligently, to frequent the Churches of God more earnestly, to be instant in prayers, and to be present at Ecclesiasticall duties, doe then most of all provoke God with their most dissolute manners. Is this O Christians to celebrate an holy day, to pamper the belly, and to let loose thereines to unlawfull pleasures? If worke bee prohibited on Holi-days, which must be used for the necessary sustenance of life; that so you may the more intirely devote your selves to heavenly things; are not those things then much more forbidden which cannot bee committed without sinne and great offence to God? On dayes that are allowed for servile worke, every one is intent upon his owne businesse; and hee abstaines from drunkennesse, pastimes, and vanities. But on Holi-dayes (loe here the true genious picture of our present age) men every where runne to the Ale-house, to Playes, to Enterludes, and dances, to the very derision of Gods Name, and the prevarication of the day: where as in truth the sinne is so much the more hainous, by how much the more holy the time is in which it is committed. Let them therefore repent, and labour utterly to extirpate and pull up this tare, which the envious man hath sowne in the Field of the Lord. Iohn Damascen out of Eusebius informes us. That those who are endued with the feare of God, long for the Lords day, that so they may pray unto God, and be made partakers of the Body and Blood of the Lord. But sluggish lasie persons looke for the Lords day, for no other end but that being loosed from their worke, they may give themselves over to their vices. Now that I lie not, the very things themselves doe make it credulous. Walke forth upon any other day, and thou shalt finde no man idle or playing. Goe forth upon the Lords day, and thou maist finde, some playing upon and singing to the Harpe: others shouting and dancing; others sitting, and reviling their neighbours, others wrestling. Doth the Preacher call to the Church? all of them grow lasie, and make delayes. Doe the Harpe or Trumpet sound? all of them presently runne as if they were winged. We behold the Spectacles of the Church; we see the Lord Christ lying on the Table, the Ceraphyns singing a thrice holy song, the words of the Gospell; the presence of the holy Ghost, the Prophets ecchoing, the Angels singing , Alleluia, all things spirituall, all things worthy salvation, all things procuring the Kingdome of Heaven. These things heares he that enters into the Church. But what seeth he who runnes to Play-houses? Diabolicall songs, dancing Wenches, or that I may speake more truely, Girles tossed up and downe with the furies of the Devill : (A good discription of our dancing females.) For what doth this Danceresse? She most impudently uncovers her head, which Paul hath commanded to be alwayes covered: Shee turnes about her necke the wrong way; She througheth about her haire hither and thither; Even these things verily are done by her whom the Devill hath possessed. But the Fidler, like a Devill, conflicteth with woodden instruments. Such verily was the feast of Herod. The Daughter of Herodias entred in and danced, and cut of the head of Iohn Baptist, and obtained the subterraneous places of Hell for her inheritance. Therefore those who love Charantoes and Dances, have their portion with her. Woe unto those who play upon the Harpe on the Lords day, or doe any servile worke. This day was allotted for the rest of servants and hirelings: For this saith he, is the day of the Lord, let us reioyce and be glad therein, &c. Salvian is yet more punctuall to our purpose: heare but his words for all the other Fathers, We preferre (saith he) pastimes before the Curch of God: We despise the Lords Table, and honour Theaters. Finally, besides other things which prove the same, this which I now say manifests it to be true. For if it fall out (as often it doth,) that at one and the same time an Holi-day be kept, and common Playes proclaimed; I demand of every mans conscience, which place hath greater troopes of Christians? whether the Yard of the publike Play-house, or the Court of Gods house; and whether men flocke to most; to the Temple, or to the Theater? Whether doe they most affect, the sayings of the Evangelists, or of Stage-players? the words of life, or the words of death? the words of Christ, or the words of a foole in a Play? Doubtlesse wee love that most which we preferre. For if the Church keepe any feast on that day when there are solemne Playes; those, who say they are Christians, doe not onely not come to the Church, but if any not thinking of the Playes come casually thither, if they heare whiles they are in the very Church, that there are Playes acting abrod, they leave the Church, and repaire to them. The Temple of God is dispised to runne unto Theaters: the Church is emptied, the Play-house filled: We leave Christ upon the Table, to feed our adulterous eyes with the impure and unchaste sight of most filthy Enterludes. What stranger soever either commeth to Ravenna, or to Rome; shall finde a part of the Romanes at Stage-playes, and a part of the Ravenians at Theaters And although any be either absent or distant by place, yet is he not excused thereby: for as many as are ioyned together in likenesse of affection, are guilty alike of the same wickednesse that either doth commit. Yet for all this, wee flatter our selves of our good behaviour, and of the rarenesse of our impurity, &c . Thus farre these Fathers Polydor Virgil complaines. That in his time holy days were most acceptable to youth for no other reason, but that they had then leasure to lead about dances; especially among the Italians, who after the custome of the ancient Pagans, did usually exhibite Spectacles and Playes unto the people; reciting Comedies, and personating the lives and martyrdomes of the Saints in Churches; in which that all might receive equall delight, they acted them in their Mother-tongue. Thus was it heretofore among the ancient Romanes, who on their solemne Festivals recited the Poems of Poets in open Theaters, and made divers Spectacles of beasts and Sword-players in Amphitheaters; with sundry other Playes thorowout the Citty, with which the people were delighted . Agrippa complaines, and so likewise doth B B. Latimer our renowned Martyr, and Episcopus Chemnensis: That that waster of equity, that subverter of all order and decency, that author of all evill things, the Devill, endevouring daily to pull downe what ever the holy Ghost doth build up, hath alwayes quite demolished this fortification: The greatest part of Christian people so spending the holy rest of Holy-dayes, not in meeting together to pray, or heare Gods Word, nor yet to performe those other duties for which they were first ordained; but wasting it in all kinde of corruptions of good manners, and of Christian doctrine, in Dances, in Comedies, in Stage-playes, in ribaldrous Songs, in sports, in drunken meetings, in spectacles, in all kinde of worldly and carnall workes contrary to the Spirit and holinesse: And as Tertullian saith of the solemnity of the C aesars or Romane Emperours; they are wont then to performe a notable piece of service, to make Bonefires and Dances in the streets, to feast from house to house, to turne the whole Citty into the forme of a Taverne, to force wine downe their throates, to runne earnestly to misdemeanors, to impudencies, to irritations, and enticements of lust: thus is the publike ioy expressed by a publike shame: so may it be said of our Festivals. Are we not therefore worthily to bee condemned who thus celebrate the solemnities of Christ and of his Saints ? Not to remember the Statute of 17 Edward 4. cap . 3. which informes us, that the Holi-dayes and Sundayes were spent in Dice-play, Kayles, Bowles, and such other unlawfull ungracious and incommendable Games . Nor to recite the words of the authorized Homily of the time and place of Prayer: which complaines: That it too evidently appeares that God is more dishonoured, and the Devill better served on the Sunday, then upon all the dayes of the weeke besides . Nor yet to recite the lamentable complaint of Ioannis Langhecrucius: That Lords-dayes and Holi-dayes in his time were for the most part spent in drunkennesse, dancing, wantonnesse, Stage-playes, and the like: in so much that the very Singing-men and Choristers of the Church (such was their blindnesse and madnesse) did spend and honor the sacred feast-day of the Virgin Martyr C aecilia, not in sackcloth and fastings; but in gluttony, in drunkennesse, in dancing, in lascivious and unchaste songs; being then more prone to all lascivious wickednesse, then to the reformation of their lusts, or to fasting and prayer : And that almost all Artificers and Trades-men had chosen some one Saint or other to be a Patron to them, which Saints they worshipped in a deboist Bacchanalian manner: so that by this kinde of worship and custome, men seemed to have relapsed to Heathennisme or Atheisme . I shall truely transcribe a notable passage out of Nicholaus de Clemangis to the like effect; in his Treatise: De Novis celebritatibus non instituendis : where he writes thus: Every one may perceive with what devotion Christian people doe at this day celebrate their Festivals and Holi-dayes. They seldome come to Church, they most seldome heare the Masse, and that for the most part but by piece-meale, &c. Yea they leave the Church, and runne away. One goeth to a Farme, another to his worldly affaires: a great companie resorts to faires, which now are never kept in a publike and solemne manner but on the most eminent Festivals : the Stage-player delighteth some, Play-houses take up others; Tennis-courts many, Dice very many. Festivals are celebrated by the richer sort with great gawdinesse of apparell; and provision of banquets: but between rich cloathes and pompous feasts, the conscience lies unadorned in uncleanesse. The outward house is cleansed with beasoms, the floores are swept, greene boughes are placed at the doore, the ground is strowed with hearbes and flowers , all outward things are cleane and trim: but the miserable inward man not partaking of this exultation, pines away in the meane time in his filthinesses, and by how much more excessive the laughter is in the middest of vaine delights, by so much the more is it afflicted with greater sorrowes, and wounded with sharper prickes of sinnes. But to omit these: let us see what the prophane vulgar doth in the meane time, and the youth in our times corrupted with luxury. I have fitly said, the prophane vulgar, according to the thing which is done; because then doubtlesse they are farre from the Temple; and as they are farre from the Temple, so likewise farre from home For Holi-dayes are not celebrated by them in the Temple, nor in their houses; all the solemnities of their celebration are in Tavernes and Ale-houses, They resort thither almost at Sunne-rising, and oft- times they abide there untill midnight; they sweare, forsweare, blaspheme God, and curse all his Saints, they roare, they wrestle, they wrangle: they sing, they rage, they shrecke, they make a tumult, and seeme to be as mad as Bedlams. They strive who shall overcome one another in drinking: they drinke merrily one to other; they earnestly provoke and stirre up one another to drinke: And when as they have glutted themselves, and are drunke, then they rise up to play, &c. What shall I relate the vanities of publike Playes and spectacles upon Holi-dayes: The crosse-wayes sound againe with dances? the Vilages and streets, yea the whole Citty rebound with the voyces of Singers, the shoutes, the clamours of Dancers, the confused sound of the Harpe, the Tabret, the Psaltery, and all other musicall Harmonies. There mindes being moved with the flatteries of laughter, the thumping of the feet, the glances of the eye, the gropings of the hands, and with the alluring sweetnesse of Verses and Harpes , Wax effeminate, become vaine, and grow hot to luxury and incontinency. There the consultations of whoredomes and adulteries are handled; oportunities are taken, places, times, and conditions are appointed. And because the day is not sufficient for their lewdnesse, Girles and espoused Women are there oft-times voluntarily or against their wils ravished in the darknesse of the night. I know places, yea famous Citties, in which on Holi-dayes and Lords-daies it is lawfull for Maides in a publike manner to runne abrode to their Lovers, yea to their Panders, which promised liberty they diligently study to preserve without controll, and speedily as soone as ever the houre of dinner is past, they earnestly call themselves together, and march in troopes to their corrupters with incredible wantonnesse and malepartnesse. We see in Wakes or Festivities of Country Villages, how Harlots come from all quarters out of the neighbour Townes and Citties, and Country Youthes flocking thither by troopes, who perhaps were free from such uncleanesse all the yeere, casting away the bridle of modesty in the solemnity of their Patron (the Saint to whose honour their Church is dedicated) publikely commit adultery. There Youth hath first cast off its Chastity; there yong men are polluted, there Children are corrupted, and they learne the experiment of a most impure contagion. There they continually provoke and invite one another to that most filthy pleasure, and he that will not follow the rest to destruction is accounted a wretch, a sluggard, an unprofitable person, good for nothing. What Heathen skilfull of sacrilegious Feastivals (if he should happen to be present) would not rather beleeve that the Floralia of Venus, or the feasts of Bacchus were kept, then the solemnities of any Saint; when as he should there behold such uncleanesses as were wont to be acted in the Festivals of those Idols. Neither doth the filthy obscenity onely of Bacchus and Venus seeme to bee exercised there, but likewise of Mars and Bellona too. For it is now a common fame, that it is an unseemely Holi-day which is not sprinkled with fighting and effusion of blood. Neither is it strange if that Mars be made a companion of Bacchus and Venus. For mindes provoked with wine and lust are wont to be easily provoked to fight; Whence Venus Martia was fained by the Poets to be coupled with a cunning and insoluble knot What, is the Patron of the Village to be worshipped by the Inhabitants on his birth-day in such a manner, that so he might be propitious to them all the yeere? What Noble or great man would not be displeased that his birth-day should be defiled with such a pollution? Who may not see, how much honester, how much better it were to observe no Holi- dayes, then to keepe them in this manner? Whose heart is so estranged from reason, so devious from the truth through perverse error, that he may not understand it to be lesse evill to goe to plow, or to digge, to sow, or doe other Country workes on the solemnities of the Saints, then not to honour, but to prophane their solemne Festivals with such horrible obscenities? And yet if any one oppressed with never so great penury of necessaries for his family be found to have done any thing in his Field or Vineyard, he is cited, severely punished, reprehended, condemned as guilty of violating an Holi-day. But he who shall commit these worser things condemned by the Lawes and Commandements of God, shall want both punishment, and an accuser. And why is this, but because there is no man who will take revenge on those who transgresse the Precepts of the Lord? They have their Officials (whose office Petrus Blesensis hath excellently characterized) they have Archdeacons, they have Promoters, they have Apparitors, who enforce their Episcopall Edicts to be kept with most grievous penalties. They runne thorow the Dioces, they craftily examine and enquire, if any Vine-dresser or Husbandman hath wrought or carried any thing upon an Holi-day: and if it shall appeare that hee hath done any such thing, he is accused and punished, not so often according to the quality of the offence, as at the will of the Iudge. But yet Christ hath none or very few Proctors who cause his Commandements to bee kept, &c. Saint Augustine saith ; that hee would rather goe to Plow on the Lords-day, then Dance: not that it is lawfull then to goe to Plow, or that hee that goeth to Plow should be pardoned, but because hee who danceth offends more grievously: because dancing it selfe is oft-times a sinne, and oft-times enforceth men to occasions of worser sinnes. Consider what hee would have said of those other things, which now are commonly done upon our Holi-dayes. And yet notwithstanding, if any one goeth to Plow on the Lords-day, hee is not onely most severely punished, but he is welnigh reputed an Infidell: but hee who danceth excellently, not onely hath no reproofe, but he is likewise plausibly received with applause and gratulation even by the Censors themselves, &c. Now what a thing is it for men to intangle themselves in greater villanies, on those dayes that are appointed for reconciliation and remission of sinnes, and on which men wholy cease from terrene actions, that they may give themselves to the contemplation of Heavenly things with a pure heart? What confidence can such have of the suffrage of the Saints, who defile their Holi-dayes with most foolish vanities, most impure pollutions, most wicked debacchations, and sacrilegious execrations? Verily they deserve to have them, not most pious furtherers, but most deadly accusers. For what greater iniury can bee done to a Saint, then to dishonor his birth-day, wherein he was carried into Heaven and Paradice, with such uncleanesses? and with every such sacrilegious custome wherewith Devils were wont to be attoned by their superstitious worshippers? What doe we thinke the ancient holy Fathers would say, who appointed the solemnities of the Saints to be observed in the Church for the foresaid ends, if they were now alive, and should see those vanities and counterfeit fooleries that are done upon them? I doubt not but they would take care of the soules that are like to perish, neither would they suffer such things on the holy dayes of the Saints as were not permitted to be done in the Bacchanalia themselves. Either therefore, they would recall the people by the censure of discipline from such most unworthy obscenities, or would compell them to celebrate Festivals with due honesty; or if they could not breake the force of pernicious custome, they would rather abolish the feasts themselves, lest they should bee an occasion of so great wickednesses; which as it seemes to agree with the safety of soules, according to the variety of manners and times, are either to be discharged from observance, or else more stricktly to be tied to an honest observance, lest they should doe farre more hurt by being ill observed, then well omitted, &c . By all which discourse of this learned Author, (who hath much more to the selfesame purpose, which suites punctually with the practise of our present times) wee may easily discerne, how Stage-playes and dancing avocate and with-hold men from Gods worship, especially on Lords-dayes, and the most solemne Christian Festivals , which of all other times are most abused, to the eternall ruine of many thousand Christians soules. To passe by Bucer in Psal . 92. Master Gualther. Hom . 88. in Acta Apostolorum. cap . 13. Master Iohn Calvin, on Deut . 5. Sermo . 34. Doctor Bownde, of th Sabbath. London 1595\. p . 135. 136, 283, 284. Master Beacon, Hooper, Babington, Brinsly, Perkins, Dod, Lake, Downham, Andrewes, Williams, Ames , and most other Writers upon the 4. Commandement, and the Sabbath: who make the selfesame complaint, that the Lords-day, and Holi-dayes are prophaned and oft-times spent in Stage-playes, Dancing, Drinking, Masques, and Pastimes . Which complaint I finde likewise seconded by learned Iohn Gerson , Vincentius Bellovecensis , and Cardinall Bellarmine himselfe; who as they condemne all Stage-playes, Enterludes, Masques, with all mixt lascivious amorous dancing , (against which Vincentius and Bellarmine have largely written) at all times, so especially on Lords-dayes, Holy-dayes, and solemne Festivals, on which they are most execrable . The Author of the 3. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters is very copious in this point. God (writes he) hath given us an expresse Commandement, that we should not violate the Sabbath day, and prescribed an order how it should bee sanctified, namely in holinesse, by calling into minde the spirituall rest, hearing the Word of God, and ceasing from worldly businesse. Whereupon Isaiah the Prophet, shewing how the Sabbath should be observed, saith , If thou turne away thy foote from the Sabbath, from doing thy will on mine Holy-day, and call the Sabbath a delight, to consecrate it as glorious to the Lord: and shalt honour him, not doing thing owne wayes, not seeking thine owne will, nor speaking a vaine word; then shalt thou delight in the Lord, and I will cause thee to mount upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Iacob thy Father, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Here we see how the Lord requireth that this day should be observed, and what rest hee looketh for at our hands. But, alas, how doe wee follow the order which the Lord hath set downe ? Is not the Sabbath of all other dayes most abused? which of us on that day is not carried whether his affections leades him, unto all dissolutenesse of life? How often doe we use on that day unreverend speech? which of us hath his heart occupied in the feare of God? who is not led away to the beholding of those Spectacles, the sight whereof can bring but confusion to our bodies and soules? Are not our eyes ( there) carried away with the pride of vanity? our eares abused with amorous, that is, lecherous, filthy, and abominable speech? Is not our tongue which was given us onely to glorifie God with all, there imployed to the blaspeming of Gods holy Name, or the commendation of that is wicked? Are not our hearts through the pleasure of the flesh, the delight of the eye, and the fond motions of the minde, withdrawne from the service of the Lord, and meditation of his goodnesse? So that albeit it is a shame to say it, yet dovbtlesse whosoever will marke with what multitudes these idle places are replenished, and how empty the Lords Sanctuary is of his people, may well perceive what devotion wee have. We may well say we are the servants of the Lord, but the slender service wee doe him, and the small regard we have of his Commandements, declares our want of love towards him. For if yee love mee ( saith Christ ) keepe my Commandements. Wee may well bee Hirelings, but wee are none of his Houshold. Wherefore abuse not the Sabbath day, my Brethren: leave not the Temple of the Lord: sit not still in the quagmire of your owne lusts: but put to your strength to helpe your selves before your owne waight sincke you downe to Hell. Redeeme the time for the dayes are evill. Alas what folly is it in you, to purchase with a penny damnation to your selves? why seeke you after sinne as after a banket ? None delight in those Spectacles, but such as would bee made Spectacles. Account not of their drosse: their treasures are too base to be laid up in the rich Coafers of your minde. Repentance is farthest from you when you are nearest to such May-games. All of you for the most part doe lose your time, or rather wilfully cast the same away, contemning that as nothing which is so precious as your lives cannot redeeme. I would to God you would bestow the time you consume in these vanities, in seeking after vertue and glory. For to speake truely, whatsoever is not converted to the use wherefore it was ordained, may be said to bee lost. For to this end was man borne, and had the benefit of time given him, that hee might honour, serve, and love his Creator, and thinke upon his goodnesse. For whatsoever is done without this, is doubtlesse cast away. Oh, how can you then excuse your selves for the losse of time! doe you imagine that your carelesse life shall never bee brought into question? Thinke yee the words of Saint Paul the Apostle were spoken in vaine, when hee saith , We must all appeare before the Iudgement Seate of Christ, that every man may receive the things which are done in his body, whether it be good or evill. When that account shall bee taken, I feare me your reckoning will bee to seeke, &c , By such infamous persons as Players much time is lost, and many dayes of honest travell are turned into vaine exercises; Youth corrupted, the Sabbath prophaned, &c. It was ordained in Rome by the Emperour Trajan, that the Romanes should observe but Holi-dayes thorowout the whole yeere. For hee thought without doubt, that the gods were more served on such dayes as the Romans did labour, then on such dayes as they rested; because the vices were more then which they did commit, then the sacrifices they did offer. And trust mee I am of that opinion, that the Lord is never so ill served as on the Holi-dayes. For then Hell breakes loose. Then wee permit Youth to have their swinge; and when they are out of the sight of their Masters, such government have they of themselves, that what by ill company they meete withall, and ill examples they learne at Playes, I feare me, I feare me their hearts are more allienated from virtue in two houres, then againe may well be amended in a whole yeere . Thus hee; yea and thus M. Gosson , M. Northbrooke , M. Stubs , M. Brinsly , and others too tedious to transcribe, together with the expresse words of the Statute of 1. Caroli. cap . 1. which informes us; That the holy keeping of the Lords-day in very many places of this Realme hath beene and now is prophaned and neglected, by a disorderly sort of people, in exercising and frequenting Beare-bayting, Bul-bayting, Enterludes, common Playes, and other unlawfull exercises and pastimes, neglecting Divine Service both in their owne Parishes, and elsewhere . All which concurrent testimonies are a sufficient confirmation of this experimentall truth; that Stage-playes avocate, with-hold, and keepe men from Gods worship, house  & ordinances, especially on Festivals, Holi-dayes, and those solemne times which should bee more peculiarly devoted to his service. And no wonder that it should be so: First, because the vulgar people , (who are commonly inamored with childish pleasures, and pompous vanities,) are exceedingly delighted with Enterludes and Stage-playes; as Tully , Horace, Iuvenal , Theodoricus , Ovid , with sundry others testifie: they are , as the Apostle speakes; Lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God : Gods presence, Sacraments, Temple, Word, and service are not so gratefull, so delightfull to them, as these: No wonder therefore if they neglect the one, (which are but a yoke , a wearisomnesse, a paine, a burthen to them ,) to enjoy the sinfull pleasures of the other, which are suitable to their vaine voluptuous humour. Secondly, because these Stage-play pleasures are the very chiefest baites, the strongest, the most prevailing Engins which the Devill hath, to with-draw mens hearts from God: They were so in former ages , as Tertullian , Cyprian , Chrysostome , Lactantius , Augustine , and Salvian teach us; no wonder therefore if they bee so now. Thirdly, as Stage-playes thus with-draw men from Gods service; so they bring the Word, the ordinances, the worship, Ministers, and sincere service of God into contempt and scorne. Witnesse Saint Chrysostome , who expresly avers it. That nothing brings the Oracles and Ordinances of God into so great contempt, as the admiration and beholding of Stage-playes . Hence Lactantius , and Hierom informe us; That those who are accustomed to rhetoricall Stage-playes, to sweet polished Orations and Poems, despise the plaine common phrase and humble stile of the Scriptures, as base and sordid; seeking after that which may delight their senses . Hence Gregory Nazianzen informes us; That Stage-playes make men unfit to heare Gods Word, and cause them to contemne it. And that the Inhabitants of Constantinople who delighted much in Stage-playes; accounted the Divine Mysteries and Oracles of God, but a meere sport, as they reputed their Stage-playes and Cirque-playes : implying thereby that Play- haunters for the most part, contemne Gods Word, his ordinances, and all spirituall things; as meere toyes and trifles. This truth is likewise confirmed, by Saint Augustine , Salvian , with other Fathers and Councels, in the two precedent clauses: by Rodolphus Gualther , one of the eminentest Divines that the reformed Churches have bred, who records: That Stage-playes, and common Actors bring all Religion into contempt; and that Plato banished them out of his Common-weale for this reason among others; because they would breed a contempt of the Gods . By the Author of the 3. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters; by M. Gosson, Master Northbrooke, and M . Stubs, in their Treatises against Playes; by Master Brinsly, in the third part of his True Watch. cap . 11. Abomination 30 pag . 302. and by sundry others too tedious to recite. And doth not our owne experience suffragate to this truth? Alas who more vilifie Gods ordinances; or more slight his Word, his Ministers, his Servants, then Players and Play-haunters? who so atheistically irreligious, so gracelesse, so godlesse, so negligent of all holy duties, so little acquainted or inamored with Gods Word, his worship, his service; as they? Whence is it, that men and women are lately growne so cold, so heartlesse in religion; so remisse, so carelesse in all religious duties; so regardlesse of Gods Word, his Sacraments, his service: so lukewarme, yea so frozen in their love to God, his Saints, his Ordinances? it is not from their late extraordinary resort to Playes and Play-houses, which is now more frequent then in former times? For my owne part. I can impute it originally to nought else but it. Sure I am that religion is no where more scorned and jested at, that religious men are never more traduced, then on the Stage: that there are no such Seminaries of atheisme , irreligiousnesse, blasphemy, idolatry, Heathenisme and prophanesse, as Playes and Play-houses: This the Authors in the precedent Acts doe fully testifie: It is more then probable therefore, that they are the primary fundamentall causes of this most desperate lewde effect. Lastly, Stage-playes make all the meanes of grace and salvation, all the ordinances of God ineffectuall to mens soules. Men heare, men read, pray, receive the Sacraments, and come to Church in vaine, as long as they continue Actors or Spectators of Stage-playes. This all the Fathers, Councels, moderne Christian Authors, with the severall reasons alleaged in the three precedent particulars, abundantly evidence; revolue them, and you shall finde it true. Saint Chrysostome is punctuall to this purpose: Wee lose (saith hee) all the labour, all the fruit of our fasting whiles wee resort to Stage-playes: yea wee reape no benefit at all from the Word of God. What profit reape you whiles you goe from hence to the Theater? I reprove you; the Player corrupts you: I apply medicines to your disease; hee ministers the fewell and occasion of the disease. I extinguish the fire of nature; hee kindles a flame of lust: I build up, and hee puls downe : Yea hee plainely informes us, that neither the Sacrament, nor any other of Gods ordinances will doe men any good, so long as they resort to Stage-playes . Saint Augustine informes us of himselfe: That as long as hee delighted in Stage-playes (which did nourish irritate and foment his lusts) God was not then his life, and that his life was not a life, but a death. For Stage-playes (writes hee) are the very baites, the snares, the dens, and chaines of the Devill, wherewith he takes and reintraps the soules of those whom he hath formerly left. Flie therefore Stage-playes, O beloved, the filthiest dens of the Devill, lest the bands of that malignant one hold you captive. Whosoever hee bee that will obtaine perfect remission of his sinnes, let him keepe and withdraw himselfe from these spectacles of the world : which last sentence of his is approved both by Aquinas himselfe, and by Alexander Fabricius , for good Divinity: If then Players and Play-haunters bee thus spiritually dead; if they are in the very chaines of the Devill; and uncapable of the full remission of their sinnes, as long as they delight in Stage-playes, or resort unto them, as this Father writes; needs must Gods holy Ordinances bee altogether unprofitable to their soules whiles they resort to Playes. A plaister never heales, as long as there is an Arrowes head, or poyson in the wound: Stage-playes are an Arrowes head, a venomous poyson to the soules of men ; they are cankers to their graces, meere fire and fewell to their lusts : no wonder then if Gods Ordinances never cure their soules, whiles they resort to Stage-playes. It was the use of Players and Play-haunting Pagans in the Primitive Church, as soone as ever they were converted to the Christian Faith; to renounce and utterly abandon Stage-playes; as altogether incompatible with their Christian profession; and making all the meanes of grace ineffectuall to their soules. Doubtlesse the very selfesame course must be taken now. Hee that would thrive in grace and holinesse; hee that would have the Word, the Sacraments, fasting, prayer, or any other of Gods ordinances effectuall to his soule, must bid an eternall farewell unto Stage-playes. Thus did two eminent Play-poets and Play-haunters of our owne; upon their very first conversion unto God , as themselves record; they abandoned Playes and Play-making, as inconsistent with salvation, with Christianity, with the grace, the service, the ordinances of God: resolving never to returne unto them more; but to their powers to oppugne them, as formerly they had admired, composed & frequented them; which they did accordingly in severall printed Bookes : Wherefore from all these severall premises thus confirmed by reason, by authority, I may safely frame this 38. Syllogisme against Stage-playes. That which unfits and indisposeth men to the acceptable holy performance of all religious duties: that which either with-drawes, or keepes men from Gods service at times of greatest holinesse and devotion, and brings the Word, the worship, with all the ordinances of God into contempt; making them vaine and ineffectuall to mens soules; must needs bee sinfull, and utterly unlawfull unto Christians. See Hebr . 12. 1. Iam . 1. 21. 1 Pet . 2. 1, 2. accordingly. But this doe Stage-playes , as is evident by the premises. Therefore they must needs bee sinfull and utterly unlawfull unto Christians. The 13. effect of Stage-playes is, that they breed in the hearts of their Actors and Spectators an inward disesteeme, a violent antipathy, an inplacable enmity against the practicall power of grace and holinesse; against all pious and religious men. This Lactantius , this Chrysostome , Augustine , Salvian , M. Gualther, The Author of the 3\. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters , M. Northbrooke , M. Stubs , swith sundry others expresly testifie. Yea this our owne experience must subscribe too. For who more bitter, more virulent, more implacable adversaries to the power of godlinesse, to those who excell in grace, in piety: who such deriders, haters, slanderers , despisers of puriry, of sincerity, of devout and holy Christians, as Players and Play-haunters? None abhorre, revile, traduce, deride or scorne them more then they. And no wonder: for Saint Paul foretold it long agoe; That such who are lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God (as Players and Play-patrons for the most part are) are alwayes despisers of those that are good, having onely a forme of godlinesse, but denying the power thereof. Lactantius hath given the true reason of it. Everyone (saith he) that sinnes desire elbow roome, he would have free liberty to sinne without controll; neither can hee take any full delight in evill, unlesse there be none to disapprove his wicked courses. Therefore hee desires to roote out all good men, who are offensive and displeasing to him, because they are not onely witnesses of his evill deeds, but likewise reprove and shame them by their different holy lives, though they never speake of them with their tongues Their very holy lives are a reproach, a scandall to their dissolute manners: therefore they slander and abhor them. S. Augustine oft-times informes us; That the degenerous voluptuous Pagans, did detract from Christ and Christians, accusing, yea declaiming against the Christian times, as evill; because they sought not after such times in which their lives might bee quiet, but rather in which their wickednesse might bee secure; in which they might securely enioy their wicked Stage-playes, their sinfull lusts, and worldly pleasures, without any reprehension or restraint . This doe our Paganizing Actors and Play-haunters now; they hate, revile and slander, all zealous, practicall Christians, under the Tearmes of Puritanes, Prescitians, Novellers, Factionists , Holy-breathren, Men of the Spirit, Bible-beares, Sermon- haunters, Hypocrites, Holy-sisters, and a world of such like ignominious, disgracefull tearmes, (though some of them in themselves are honourable , having the holy Ghost himselfe for their Author, how ever prophane Atheisticall persons turne them into very mottoes of disgrace:) They abhor the very appearances of all grace and holinesse, as diametrally opposite to their ungodly courses, to their prophane, lascivious, ribaldrous Enterludes, which all the Saints of God have evermore condemned. They thinke it strange that holy men run not with them into the same excesse of riot , into the selfesame pleasures and delights of sinne, in which they plunge themselves: therefore speake they evill of them ; therefore they reproach, traduce, contemne, detest, oppugne them with the very height of spleene, of malice ; as being an eyesore, yea a life-sore to them, as present experience can informe us Hence therefore I argue in the 39. place. That which ingenders in the hearts of its Actors and Spectators, an inward hatred, an undervaluing disesteeme, a violent antipathy, a virulent enmity, against the practicall power of grace and holinesse; against all holy, gracious, godly Christians; must needs be sinfull and abominable unto Christians. Witnesse the 1 Iohn 3\. 10. to 20\. Phil . 4. 8, 9. and infinite other Scriptures. But this doe Stage-playes, as is evident by the premises, by experience, and by Act 8\. Scene 7. Therefore they must needs be sinfull and abominable unto Christians. The 14 fruit of Stage-playes is this: That they inamor men with the love of sinne and vanity, which is ill: yea harden them in their sinne, and indispose them to repentance, which is farre worse. The more a man resorts to Stage- playes, the more hee delights in sinne, in vanity , scurrility, lewdnesse; in Pagan Rites and Ceremonies; the more is hee obdurated and confirmed in his vitious wicked courses; the more is hee indisposed to repentance: Playes are the Birdlime , the enchaunting snares of Satan , with which he captivates and intangles soules through Pleasure and delight: they are his chiefest instruments to expell all godly sorrow from mens hearts, to stupifie, to cauterize their consciences; to banish the very feare and thoughts of sinne out of their mindes; to remove the sence, the sting of conscience  & iniquity far from their soules: to lull their hearts asleepe in deepe security; to chase away farre from them all thoughts of Hell, of death, of damnation, of the day of iudgement; to forestall all helpes, all preparatives, all meanes, all motives to repentance, and to with-hold men from it. Alas, how can he loath sinne in the street, who delights in it in the play-house? How can hee mourne for it in his Closet; who sports himselfe with it in the Theater? How can hee weepe for it in secret, who thus laughes at it in publike? How can he looke upon it with detestation in himselfe, who makes it his recreation when it is acted by others? How can he renounce, abhorre, condemne it at home; who thus applaudes, affects, admires it abrode? Certainely, hee can never make sinne his greatest griefe, who makes the representations of it his chiefest mirth: He can never make ribaldry, adultery, whoredome, incest, and the like, the everlasting objects of his hatred, who makes the hearing, the seeing, the acting, the lively representations and pictures of them, the daily objects of his chiefe delight. Every true penitent must be sensible of sinne; he must feele the sting, the venom of it, see the filth of it , bewayle the guilt of it , all the occasions of it, all the allurements to it, yea utterly abhorre the very sight and hearing of it, as a most execrable, horrid, and ac[illeg.] an [illeg.]hing . And can Players, can Play-haunters then who spend their dayes in myrth, in carnall iollity , in laughing, in rejoycing, in ribaldrous songs, in scurrilous jests, in amorous Poems, in wanton Comedies; in lewde discourses, in adulterous representations, wallowing in the very mire of sensuality, voluptuousnesse, and such like beastly sinnes, without the least remorse, be neere to true repentance, or to the wayes, the preparatives that lead and bring men to it? O no! A penitent heart, an humbled soule, a circumcised eare, an eye that weepes in truth for sinne, is altogether impatient of such objects , such Enterludes, and delights as these. Witnesse the pactise of the Pagan converts in the Primitive times , who immediately upon their baptisme, and syncere repentance did utterly renounce all Stage-playes as accursed Pleasures, not daring to return unto them againe : Witnesse all Christian converts of latter times, who have done the like. Thus did Saint Augustine heretofore, as himselfe confesseth ; thus did M. Gosson and the Author of the 3. Blast of Retrait from Stage-playes of late; as themselves record: before their repentance and conversion they composed, they admired Stage-playes; immediately upon their repentance and reformation they utterly abandoned them, and wrote against them : Thus likewise did Alipius , Saint Augustines convert , as himselfe relates: thus all that heartily and sincerely turne to God have ever done : their repentance drew them first from Playes  & Play-houses, and then bent their hearts, their judgements, their tongues, if not their pens against them: Thus was it with the wanton Poet Ovid ; his very morall Heathenish repentance, made him to detest and write against those Playes and Play-houses, which formerly hee conmmended : And will not then true Christian Evangelicall repentance much more reclaime men from, embitter their hearts, their tongues, and pens against these Heathenish, Hellish, and polluted pleasures? undoubtedly it will, as appeares by all the Play-contemning Councels, Fathers, and other Christian Authors here recited, and by the concurrent suffrage of the devoutest Christians in all ages, who have constantly condemned and declaimed against Stage-playes, as the very greatest corruptions that can befall a Church or Christian State. The farther men are from Playes and Play-houses, the neerer are they (saith an Author) to true repentance : the neerer to them, the further are they from this soule-saving grace. Hereupon some Fathers well observe, that Saint Paul writing to Philemon to provide an house or lodging for him , (Philemon, vers. 22.) would have such an house as was not neere the Theater or place of publike Enterludes, whither Lascivious persons running did follow all filthy things, lest its filthy vicinage should make it detestable . Certainely if it were not meete for an eminent Apostle to dwell neere to Playes or Play-houses, for feare their lewde vicinity should make his habitation detestable to Christian Auditors who resorted to it: much more unseemely is it for a penitent Christian (who must abstaine not onely from evill it selfe, but likewise from all the appearancies of it ) to resort to Playes and Play- houses themselves, which are farre more noxious, more contagious then the houses neere adjacent to them. As hee therefore, who would obtaine the perfect grace of remission, must withdraw himselfe from the Spectacles and Enterludes of the world ; if Saint Augustine , Aquinas , or our owne Country-man Alexander Fabricius write true Doctrine; so hee that would attaine the grace of true repentance must wholy sequester himselfe from Playes and Play-houses , which are altogether incompatible with true repentance, and both hindring men from it, and indisposing them to it, to the eternall losse, the irrecoverable perdition of their dearest soules. Wherefore I shall epitomize this Scene into this 39. Play-refuting Argument. That which inamors men with sinne and vanity; which hardens them in their sinnes, detaines them in their wicked courses, and indisposeth them to true repentance; must needs be utterly unlawfull, and execrable unto Christians: Witnesse, Psal. 101. 3. Psal. 119. 37. Rom . 24. 5. But this doe Stage-playes, as the premises demonstrate. Therefore they must needs bee utterly unlawfull, and execrable unto Christians. The 15. consequent or effect of Stage-playes is; that they effeminate their Actors and Spectators; making them mimicall, histrionicall, lascivious, apish, amorous, and unmanly, both in their habites, gestures, speeches, complements, and their whole deportment: enervating and resolving the virility and vigor of their mindes , to their owne private and the publike prejudice.

These effeminated the Grecians, the Romanes heretofore, resolving their valour into sloath and lazinesse, and so making them a booty to their enemies, which made the Massilienses and Scipia Africanus to suppresse them . And if this evidence is not sufficient, our owne experience can sufficiently manifest this truth. For whence is it that many of our Gentry are lately degenerated into a more then Sardanapalian effeminacy ; that they are now so fantastique in their apparell, so womannish in their frizled Periwigs. Love-lockes, and long effeminate pouldred pounced haire; so mimicall in their gestures; so effeminate in their lives; so Player- like in their deportment; so amorous in their speeches; so lascivious in their embracements; so unmanly, degenerous and un-English (if I may so speake) in their whole conversation; is it not principally from their resort to Playes, to Masques, and such like antique, apish Pastimes, the very Schooles to traine them up in all effeminacy, and fantastique folly? undoubtedly it is. Wherefore I shall briefely conclude this Scene with this 40. Play-oppugning Syllogisme. That which effeminates mens mindes, mens manners, and makes them womannish both in their mindes, their bodies, speeches, habites, and their whole deportment: must needs bee abominable unto Christians, intolerable in a Common-weale. Witnesse Act 5. Scene 3. & Act 7. Scene 5\. before. But this doe Stage-playes; as is evident by the premises; and by Act 5. Scene 3. & Act 6. Scene 5\. Therefore they must needs be abominable unto Christians, intolerable in a Common-weale. The 16. pernicious fruit of Stage-playes is, the incorporating of men into lewde, deboist, ungodly company, which oft-times proves the utter ruine of their soules, their bodies, credits and estates . How many Gentlemen are there now living, who by frequenting Stage-playes, have got such intimate acquaintance with Adulterers, Whore-masters, Adulteressses, Panders, Whores, Bawdes, Parasites, Rookes, Cheaters, Drunkards, Rufffians, Rorers, Duellers, Quarrellers, Fantastiques, Idle-bees, Fashion-mungers, Stage-players, Pursers, and the like pernicious creatures, that they have never beene able to shake them off againe, till they have beene plunged over head and eares in sinne and villany, till they have wasted their bodies, their estates, their credits, and lost themselves past all recovery? How many are there now in England that even in this respect have cause torue the day that ever they beheld a Stage-play ? How many tender carefull Parents are there who may with watry eyes and bleeding hearts cry out, that Stage-playes have beene the utter overthrow of their beloved Children, by ensnaring them in the bonds of dissolute, gracelesse, prodigall, unchaste companions, the chiefest instruments to make men wicked; and irrecoverably deboist? Flavius Vopiceus , in the life of Divus Aurelianus , inquiring into the severall causes that make Princes evill; reckons wicked friends, and detestable or foolish Courtiers and companions as the chiefe of all the rest : intimating, that nothing is more contagious, more pernicious then evill company: of whom we may truely say as Seneca doth of an over-indulgent friend. Ille amando me occidit ; that they kill men whiles they love them. It is storied of Carinus the most defiled of men; that when hee came to the Empire hee abandoned all his best friends, retaining and choosing none but the very worst of all for his companions: Whereupon hee filled his Court with Stage-players, Harlots, Iesters, Singers, Bawdes; and committed most of his affaires to wicked men, whom hee alwayes invited to his Feasts . This and no other doe our common Play-haunters; they abandon all religious, modest, sober, chaste, and studious acquaintance: they fill their houses, their chambers with Poets, Stage-players, Whore-masters, Panders, Iesters, Drunkards, Whores, Bawdes, Rookes, Sycophants, who hang like Burres, like Horsleeches upon them, till they have suckt them drie, and then they vanish. These are their onely counsellers, companions, guests, and bosome friends, who prove at last their deadliest enemies. This therefore should lesson all good Christians to refraine from Stage-playes, for feare they incorporate them into evill company, who will draw them by degrees to any wickednesse. S. Augustine relates a memorable Story of one Alipius, a deare friend and convert of his, whom he himselfe had disswaded from frequenting Theaters and Cirque-playes; who being sollicited by his friends and fellow Schollers, who met him as they returned from dinner, to goe along with them to a Sword-play, did at first earnestly refuse and withstand them; and being at last drawne along by them to the Amphitheater with a familiar violence, hee told them by the way, that though they should drag his body to that place, and set it there, yet they should never seriously fix his minde or eyes upon these Spectacles; I therefore (said hee) will bee absent whiles I am present, and so I will overcome both you and them. Notwithstanding these words they drew him along with them to the Amphitheater, perchance to try him, whether hee could doe as hee hath said. Where when they were come, and every man had placed himselfe in such a seate as hee could get, all things growing hot with most cruell pleasures ; Alipius shutting his eye-lids, forbade his minde, that it should not proceed on into so great evills: and I would to God (Writes Saint Augustine) ) hee had likewise stopped his ears. For when as a great shout of all the people, occasioned by some accident of the fight had vehemently beaten his eares, being overcome with curiosity, and withall being as it were prepared to contemne and overcome the sight what- ever it were, hee opened his eyes; and forth-with hee was smitten with a more grievous wound in his soule, then hee whom hee desired to see was in his body, and hee fell more miserably then hee, whose fall occasioned the shout, which entred thorow his eares, and opened his eyes, that so there might bee some thing whereby his bold, rather then as yet valiant minde (and so much the more weake, by how much hee had the more presumed of himselfe, who ought to have relied on God,) might bee smitten and cast adowne. For as soone as he saw that blood, he dranke in cruelty together with it, and did not turne away himselfe, but fixed his eyes, and drew in fury; hee knew not the danger, and yet was delighted with the wickednesse of the combate, and was drunken with the bloody pleasure. And now hee was not the same man that hee came thither, but one of the company to which hee was come, and a true companion of theirs by whom hee was brought thither. What shall I say more? Hee beheld, hee shouted, hee grew outragious, he carried away madnesse with him from thence, whereby hee was excited to returne thither againe, not onely with those by whom hee was first drawne away, but likewise before them, and drawing along others with him. And yet thou O Lord hast pluckt him thence with a most powerfull and mercifull hand, and hast taught him not to have any confidence in himselfe, but in thee; but this a long time after  . From this experimentall Story thus related by S. Augustine , which comes punctually to our purpose, wee may learne many good instructions: First, that lewde companions are very importunate sollicitors to draw others to Playes, and Play-houses, (as Panders, Whore-masters, and Yongsters now are, to draw yong Gentlewomen and others whom they would make their prey) that so they may corrupt and lead them on to greater evils with more facility. Secondly, that the best remedy to avoyd their importunate sollicitations, is peremptorily to withstand them, and not to yeeld one inch unto them . Thirdly, that it is exceeding dangerous for good Christians, especially for new converted Novices, to be drawne by any importunities or perswasions of friends or lewde companions, to a Play-house, though it be against their wills and judgements, though they goe thither with a prejudicate opinion against Playes,  & with a peremptory resolution not to minde them, much lesse to be overcome or tempted by them, as this Alipius did. Fourthly, that the beholding of one lascivious Stage-play, though with prejudice, disaffection, and an absolute resolution against it, is able to corrupt and vitiate the very best spectators that resort unto it: how much more then will it deprave those lewde Play-haunters who flocke unto it with delight, and are almost daily in the Play-house? Fiftly, that the sight of one onely Stage-play, though with a prepossessed opinion against it, will draw men onto frequent, applaud, and admire others . Sixtly, that those who are once corrupted by seeing Stage- playes, are industrious to seduce, and draw others to them ; whereas it were farre better for such men not to have beene borne, then to be thus enrolled among the number of those, who are borne for the publike hurt of others . Seventhly, that those who are misled by Stage-playes, though they be civill, or religious men, are seledome speedily reclaimed from them ; and that onely by the strong arme and powerfull hand of God, not by any strength or goodnesse of their owne. Lastly, that God commonly with-drawes his preventing and perfecting grace, from who runne approving to be an undoubted storie, though not canonicall Text, infallibly assures us ; First, that these Playes and Enterludes had their originall from the Idolatrous dissolute Pagan Greekes ; and that they were the exercises, ordinances and customes of the Heathen. Secondly, that they were never in use among the Iewes till this wicked Iasons time , who is the first wee reade of that erected a Theatre or place of exercise for these and such like pastimes in Ierusalem , about 174 yeares before our Saviours Nativitie; where Herod likewise set up a Theatre and Amphitheatre for stage- playes, sword-playes, cirque-playes, and such other Roman sports, about some 25 yeares before our Saviours birth; till which times the Iewes were utterly unacquainted with those heathenish spectacles . Thirdly, that those who brought in these Playes among the Iewes, were desperate wicked men, who made themselves uncircumcised, forsooke the holy covenant, and joyned themselves to the Heathen, being solde to doe mischiefe . Fourthly, that the bringing in of these Playes withdrew the Iewes from God, and from his Law, to open, yea, professed Paganisme and Idolatry : Fifthly, that these Playes are directly against the holy convenant, and good Law of God, and that those who practise or approve them doe wickedly against Gods Law . Lastly, that the introducing of Stage-playes was the cause of Gods bringing in of sore calamity upon the Iewes, and of those sundry judgements and afflictions which they suffered . If we add to this the apocryphall Constitutions of the Apostles , recorded by Clemens Romanus ; we shall finde them expresly condemning and prohibiting Stage-playes, with all those Gr aecian Enterludes which Iason introduced; commanding all Christians to withdraw themselves from them yea wholly to renounce them as the very inventions and pompes of the Divel : nay we shall see St. Paul himselfe, expresly excommunicating and casting out of the Church, all Stage-players, and Play-haunters, whether male or female, till they shall utterly renounce their profession, and take their everlasting farewell of Stage-playes . It is evident then by all these Canonicall and Apochryphal Scriptures,  & by the Apostles constitutions; that Stage-playes are directly contrary to, and condemned by the very sacred Law and word of God; which administers unto us this 46. Play-condemning argument, against which there can be no averment, from which there can be no evasion. That which is fully and really condemned by sundry sacred texts both of canonicall and apochryphall Scripture , must certainly be sinfull, and altogether unlawfull unto Christians, who must never allow, or practise that which the very word of God condemnes. But Stage-playes are fully and really condemned by sundry sacred texts both of canonicall and apochryphall Scripture; as is undeniably evident by the premises. Therefore they must certainly be sinfull, and altogether unlawfull unto Christians : Who if for no other reason, yet for this alone, should now at last without more delayes , renounce, suppresse all Stage-playes, which the sacred Scripture (the very ground and object of our faith , the very rule, the square both of our lives and thoughts ) hath thus condemned. The second Squadron of Play-oppugning Authorities, is the venerable hoary resolution of the whole primitive Church both under (if not before) the Law and Gospell; which hath passed such an irrepealable sentence of condemnation against all Stage-playes, Players, and Play-haunters, as no true member of the holy Catholicke Church shall be ever able to gainsay. That the whole Church of God under the Law ( consisting onely of Iewes and Iewish Proselites ) abominated and rejected Stage-playes, it is most apparant by these ensuing reasons. First, because we finde no mention at all of any such Playes or Enterludes in any canonicall Scripture, or ancient Iewish Authours, nor any intimation that the Iewes approved them. Secondly, because Stage-playes (as Iosepbus , and the Bookes of Maccabees informe us; were most directly opposite both to the Iewish lawes, their government, manners, rites and customes : For first the Iewes (and so all Christians) were expresly enjoyned by Gods Law, to make no image, likenesse or representation of any Idol, nor yet to make mention of any Idols name . Now Stage-playes were alwayes fraught with the pictures, images, representations, and names of Pagan idols , which the Iewes could never brooker and there upon they withstood Herod when he would have brought his Stage-playes into Ierusalem, because of the images, visours and pictures that attended them . Secondly, the Iewes were commanded to abandon all monuments, rites and reliques of Idols and Idolatry: all customes, fashions, vanities, exercises and pastimes of the Heathen round about them; whose wayes and customes they were not for to learne, much lesse to practise . Now Stage-playes were the very monuments, rites and reliques of Idolatry, of Pagan Divell-Idols: the customes, fashions, vanities, exercises, wayes and pastimes of the Heathen Greekes and Romanes, who bordered on them, and subdued them; as Iosephus , Philo Iudaus . the Bookes of Macabees , and others witnesse: therefore the Iewish Church must of necessitie condemn them, never practise them. Thirdly, because the Authour of the Bookes of Macabees informes us; that wicked Iason, and his profane confederates were the first that brought in these Playes and Grecian Exercises among the Iewes, who never practised them before; which Playes though divers of the Priests and people embraced, apostatizing wholly from their religion and Gods worship; yet the Iewish Church, with all those Iewes who clave close to their religion did vtterly abandon and condemne them, as directly contrary to the holy covenant and Law of God . Fourthly, Iosephus , that famous Iewish Historian, as hee condemneth Iason for this fact of his : so hee informes us likewise, that when as Herod would have introduced Stage-playes, Sword-playes and such like Roman Spectacles into Ierusalem, where he had built a stately Theatre and Amphitheatre for the exercise of those theatricall Enterludes; of purpose (as it seemed) to draw the Iewes to Paganisme, and overturne their ancient discipline; to which end he likewise erected another Theatre at C aesarea Stratoni[illeg.]: the whole Iewish Nation, and the gravest wisest men among them, were much offended with it; and thereupon withstood these Playes of his, as being contrary to their lawes, their received discipline and customes; pernicious to their manners, prejudicial to their Republike, opposite to their Religion, and offensive to their God: which Playes when Herod resolved to bring in by force whether the Iewes would or no, there were certaine Iewes confederated together to murther him in the Theatre it selfe, out of the detestation which they bare to Playes, of purpose to prevent those mischievous consequencies which these Stage-playes would occasion both to their religion, discipline, state, and Country manners, which they were bound in honour, yea in conscience to maintaine, though it were with the hazard of their lives . Fifthly, Philo , a very learned Iew, who flourished in the Apostles times, under Caius the Emperour , (a man whom Iosephus, Eusebius , Hierom , Augustine , and others highlie magnifie:) as he expresly Augustine , and others highlie magnifie:) as he expresly condemnes Stage-playes, as voluptuous, petulant, nugatory, vaine and hurtfull Pastimes, in which many thousands of wretched people did miserably spend their time, nay waste their lives, neglecting in the meane while both the publike and their owne private affaires : So he records withall, That Moses thought it meete, that all his Citizens, following the law of nature, should celebrate the seventh day (being the birth-day of the world) in rest, and festivall recreations; laying aside all workes, all gainfull callings and secular imployments, that so they might wholly apply themselves, not to sports and pleasures, (as some doe) nor yet to the ridiculous sights of Stage-playes and dances, which the unruly vulgar loves excessively, captivating their very soule by the two chiefest sences, sight and hearing, which of it selfe is free and soveraigne: but that they might solely addict themselves to true phylosophy, and to Gods worship and service . And withall he certifieth us, That the Iewes in their solemne feasts and meetings abandoned all drunkennesse, voluptuousnesse, effeminacy and excesse; together with all Stage-players, Fidlers, Tumblers, Iesters , (which the Gr aecians used in their festivals:) who did onely exhilerate mens mindes with scurrilous sports and jests: using no other mirth or musicke, but Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall songs, wherein they sounded out Gods praises . All which sufficiently manifests, that the whole Church of the Iewes condemned Stage-playes. Sixthly, St. Chrysostome in his 56. Homily upon Genesis , discoursing of the marriage of Iacob to Labans daughter , (even long before the Law was given) informes us: That the Saints of God in those times had no Musitians, no diabolicall dancing at their marriages; that they sent for no players from the Play-house, to their houses, to corrupt the chastity of the married Virgin with their unseasonable expence, and to make her more impudent and incontinent ever after: A custome too frequent in his and our times, which this godly Father much condemnes . Seventhly, Origen , (who much inveighes against Playes, against Players and Play-haunters, as the very broode and bondslaves of the Divell, who have no part at all in Christ or in his Church) records: That Moses tooke away all such things as conduced not to the benfit of mankinde; embracing and cherishing those things onely which might be usefull and profitable unto all men: whence he permitted and instituted no such Playes and gymnicall Exercises as the Gentiles used, in which naked men wrestled together, or contended with one another on horsebacke, or in which women were prostituted to the lusts of all men, that so they might delude nature by their lewdnesse. But this verily was principally intended among the Iewes, that from their very cradles they might learne to transcend all nature, to overcome what ever was sensible, and to beleeve, that God resided not in any part of sensible nature, whom they did seeke onely in things above, and without all bodies . Lastly, Potrus Blesensis Archdeacon of Bathe . about the yeare of our Lord, 1160. speaking of that holy man Iob ; informes us: That he nourished no lyons, beares or apes; that no Stage-players, no singers of fables and vaine idle toyes resorted to him; that he gave not himselfe to the pleasures and vanities of this life, upon which many spend their estates; but that hee bestowed his revenues in the charitable relieving of the poore . All which being laid together, is an undeniable proofe; that the whole primitive Church and Saints of God both before and under the Law, did utterly abandon and condemne all Stage-playes, Players, and such other Spectacles as sinfull and pernicious; not giving the least allowance to them. And shall we Christians under the Gospell, be worse than these were under the Law, and so make our condemnation farre more terrible, our sinne more out of measure sinfull ? God forbid. That the whole primitive Church under the Gospell hath reprobated, abandoned and condemned Stage-playes, is more than evident. First, by the expresse testimonie of Epiphanius, Bishop of Constans , in Cyprus, a learned ancient Father: who in his Compendiary Summe of the faith and doctrine of the Catholike and Apostolike Church , informes us, in positive termes: That the Catholike and Apostolicall Church doth reprobate and forbid all Theatres, Stage-playes, Cirque-playes, and such like heathenish spectacles : An evidence so full, so pregnant, that we need no other. Secondly, by the suffrage of Tertullian , who in his Apologie for the Christians against the Gentiles ; writes thus in the name and person of all the primitive Christians of his age: Wee renounce your Spectacles and Stage-playes, as farre forth as we reject their originalls; which we know to have had their conception from superstition. We have nothing at all to doe with the furie of the Circus: with the dishonesty or lewdnes of the Theatre, with the cruelty of the Arena: with the vanity of the Xystus or Wrestling place, wee come not at all unto your Playes . Loe here a professed publike Protestation of all the primitive Christians, against these Playes and Spectacles which we so much admire; whose detestation of Playes was so notoriously knowne to the Pagans, that Tertullian in his Booke, De Spectaculis , affirmes: That the Heathen Gentiles did most of all discerne men to be Christians by this, that they abandoned and renounced Stage-playes . And shall this which was the eminentest badge of a Christian , heretofore, be nothing else but the ignominious brand of a Puritan , now? Certainly its a strong argument, that those whom the world now brands for Puritans , are in truth no other but the sincerest Christians ; and that those who stile them so (especially for condemning or renouncing Stage-playes) are little better, (I had almost said as bad, nay worse) than Pagans; since he manifestly denies himselfe to be a Christian, who takes away this speciall marke by which hee is knowne to be a Christian ; as the same Tertullian there inferres. Thirdly, this truth is evident by Theophilus Patriarke of Antiochia about the yeare of our Lord 170: Who in the person of all the Christians of that age, writes thus unto Autolycus : Wee are all prohibited to beholde Duells, lest wee should bee made partakers of such murthers. Neither dare wee beholde those other Playes and Spectacles, lest our eyes should be defiled, and our eares should draw in those prophane verses that are there uttered: neither dare wee so much as to heare Thyestis whiles hee commemorates tragicall villanies, &c. Neither is it lawfull for us to heare the adulteries of the Gods and men, which they modulate with a sweete straine of words, being allured unto it by rewards. Farre be it, farre be it, I say, from Christians, with whom temperance and modesty flourish, and chastity beares sway, that wee should so much as thinke, much lesse behold or act such villanies as these . What fuller, what plainer declaration against Stage-playes can we desire than this? Fourthly, Athenagoras , the famous Christian Philosopher, in his Apologie or Embassie for the Christians, to M. Aurelius Antoninus, and Aurelius Commodus, two Roman Emperours , about the yeare of our Lord 180; writes thus in the behalfe of the Christians of that age: We utterly disaffect and condemne your gladiatory Spectacles, Playes and Enterludes . Fifthly, Minutius Felix , that famous Christian Lawyer , who flourished about 200 yeares after Christ, in his incomparable Dialogue, stiled Ostavius , in the defence of the Christians; brings in C aelicius a Pagan, taxing the Christians, for that they resorted not to Stage-playes, neither were they present at publike shewes : to which Octavius , in the behalfe of all the Christians gives this reply: We therefore who are valued by our manners and chastity, deservedly withdraw our selves from your evill pleasures, Playes and spectacles, whose originall we know to have proceeded from idolatry, and which we condemne as pernicious allurements unto sinne . Sixthly, St. Cyprian that godly Martyr, Bishop of Carthage , about the yeare of our Lord 250. informes Eucratius , in an Epistle purposely written to him to this end; that it would not stand with the Majesty of God, nor the discipline of the Gospell, that the chastity and honour of the Church should be contaminated with so filthy a contagion, as to permit a Stage-player, either to act his Playes, or to traine up others for the Stage, though he had given over acting himselfe . A pregnant evidence, in what tearmes of opposition the primitive Church and, Christians stood with Stage-players, and their filthy Enterludes, which they could upon no tearmes brooke. Seventhly, the 3. Councell of Carthage , about the yeare of our Lord 394. Can. II. which prohibits the sonnes of Bishops and Clergie men from exhibiting and beholding Stage-playes ; informes us; that all Christians had beene alwayes inhibited from resorting to such places where Players and blasphemers came . If all Christians then have alwayes beene prohibited from resorting unto Stage-playes, as this ancient Councell affirmes ; it is certaine, the primitive Church and Christians did evermore condemne them: and can we yet approve, applaud, frequent them now? Eighthly, St. Chrysostome , about 400 yeares after Christ, in his 15. Homely to the people of Antioch ; and in his 38. Homely upon Matthew , writes: That all the Christians of Antioch in the time of their feare and danger, had of their owne accord shut up the Play-house doores, and stopped up all passages to the Circus, running hastily with zeale and earnestnesse to the Church to praise the Lord, in stead of resorting to the Theaters ; which as to us, and all good Christians, (in whose person hee speakes) lie desolate and ruinated long agoe . Ninthly, Saint Augustine about the yeare of our Lord 410. records: That when the Gospell was spread abroad in the world, Stage-playes and Play-houses, the very caves of filthinesse, and professions of wicked persons, went to ruine almost in every Citty, as inconsistent with it: whence the Gentiles complained of the times of Christianity, as evill and unhappy seasons . An apparant demonstration, that the truth and power of Religion, the true Church and servants of Christ were as opposite to Stage-playes, to Theatres in the primitive times, as the Arke to Dagon , Christ to Belial : and shall we now yoake them both together? Lastly, St. Bernard , about the yeare of our Lord 1130. instructs us: That all the faithfull souldiers of Iesus Christ abominate and reject all dicing, all stage-players, south-sayers, tellers of fables, all scurrilous songs and stage-playes, as vanities, and false frensies. Neither delight they in the ravenous sport of banking. They cut their haire and weare it short, knowing according to the Apostle, that it is a shame for a man to nourish his haire. All which concurring testimonies infallibly cleare this undoubted truth: That the whole primitive Church and all godly Christians that lived in it, have unanimously, constantly and professedly with greatest detestation, abominated, renounced and condemned Stage-playes . For the further manifestation of which; I shall desire you to consider but these particulars more. First, that the Scriptures both Canonicall and Apochryphall, together with the Apostles, the Whole Nation of the Iewes, the Saints and Church of God both before and under the Law, rejected and abandoned Stage-playes, as I have largely proved in the precedent Scene: therefore the primitive Church and Christians under the Gospell, could not but censure and oppugne them too. Secondly, the most, the chiefest Fathers and Councels in the primitive Church have abundantly, unanimously, professedly condemned Stage- playes, in the highest straine of opposition; as the premises, and two next ensuing Scenes will manifest: the primitive Church and Christians therefore did undoubtedly condemne, reject them; whose judgement remaines upon record to all posterity in the laborious writings of these Fathers, and in the Canons of these most famous Councels. Thirdly, the primitive Church under the Gospell, as sundry Councels , Fathers , and others testifie, excommunicated all Stage-players, all Play-haunters; thrusting them out both from the Church, the Sacraments, and all Christians society, as noysome, putred, contagious, unworthy gracelesse persons, till they had utterly abjured Stage-playes, and solemnly protested to returne unto them no more : this therefore is infallible, that they rejected Stage-playes. Fourthly, If any Pagan who was a professed Stage-player or Play-haunter, desired to turne Christian, he was first to renounce his art of Stage-playing, and to abandon all resort to Playes, before hee could be baptised or admitted into the Church, as the marginall authorities fully evidence : This therefore is an unfallible evidence, that the primitive Church and Christians abominated Stage-playes. Lastly, every Christian that was baptized in the primitive: Church, did solemnly renounce all Stage-playes, dancing, with such like sports and spectacles, as the very workes and pompes of the Divell, under which all Stage-playes, Spectacles and dancing are included, as Clemens Romanus, Tertullian, Cyrill of Hierusalem, St. Augustine, Chrysostome, Salvian, Isiodor Hilpalensis, HRabanus Maurus, and other Fathers expresly testifie, in their forequoted places: to which I shall here annexe some other testimonies to make the point more plaine; that Stage-playes, and dancing are those very pompes of the Divell, which Christians in the primitive Church, (and Wee now as well as they) renounce in baptime, however we most perjuriously reassume them, against our sacred vowes. St. Cyprian in his Booke De Spectaculis , is most punctuall to this purpose; where thus he writes: He impudently exorciseth the Divel in the Church, whose pleasures hee commends in Stage-playes; and when as by renouncing him once in baptisme, all his pompe and furniture is lopped off; whiles that after this profession of Christ he goeth to the spectacles of the Divel, he renounceth even Christ himselfe as a Divell . Which dreadfull sentence, together with that of Isiodor Hispalensis formerly quoted: ( That he who after baptisme agreeth either to act or see a Stage-play, denieth God, and becomes a pr aevaricator of the Christian faith; since hee againe desires that which hee had long since renounced in his baptisme; to wit, the Divell, his Pompes and Workes: Which is likewise seconded by HRabanus Maurus de Vniuerso l.20.c.38) me thinkes should shake the very heart and reines of every Play-haunter and make his very soule to weepe even teares of blood. Iustinian , that godly Christian Emperour, Codicis lib. 1\. Tit. 4\. De Episcopali Audientia, Lex 35\. expresly informes us: That Stage-playes, Cirque-playes, Dicing, and such like Spectacles are not the least part of that worship, of those pompes of the Divell which Christians renounce in baptisme, when they are first initiated and admitted to the sacred Mysteries: whence he prohibits all Christians, especially all Clergy men, either to act, or beholde such Enterludes and Spectacles as these, or to pollute their hands, their eyes and eares with such damned and prohibited Playes. St. Chrysostome , as in sundry places before quoted; so in his 21. Homely to the people of Antioch ; and his 69\. Homely upon Matthew, he stiles stage-playes, cirque-playes, and dancing, the Divels Pompes and Lectures: his words in the first of these places are remarkable. Remember (faith hee) this speech which thou hast uttered when as thou wast baptised, I renounce thee Satan, thy Pompes, and thy service: say always, I renounce thee Satan . Nothing will be safer than this speech, if wee expresse it by our workes. For this speech is a confederation with the Lord. And as we when we buy servants, demand of them first, whether they will serve us yea or no: even so doth Christ, when as he ought to receive thy service, he first demands of thee, whether thou wilt first forsake that mercilesse and cruell tyrant, and then he receives thee into covenant: for his dominion is not forced. And though hee hath redeemed us wretched and ungratefull servants with such a price, the greatnesse whereof the reason and minde of man is not able to comprehend; even with his owne most precious blood: yet after all this he exacts no witness nor writings from us, but is contended with a word alone: and if thou saist from thy heart; I renounce thee Satan, and thy pompe, he hath received all he doth require. Let us say this, I renounce thee Satan: and let us keepe this promise, as those who are to give an account of it at the last day, that we may then restore the pledge safe. Now the Divels pompe, are theatres, stage-playes, cirque-playes, costly and gorgeous apparell, pr aesages, omens, and every sinne. To preserve thee therefore from these pompes, and every other sinne : when thou art going out of thy doore, utter this speech first; I renounce thee Satan, and I am united to thee o Christ: Never goe thou abroad without this speech: this will be a staffe, this will be armour and an impregnable tower to thee, so that neither man nor Divell shall be able to hurt thee, when they shall see thee appearing every where furnished with these weapons. St. Augustine , as in his fore-alledged place , so in his second Booke De Symbolo ad Catechumenos, cap . 1.  & 2\. He informes us: That stage-playes, cirque-playes, and such like spectacles, are the pompes of the Divell, which God hath enjoyned us to renounce: Flie stage-playes therefore (saith he) o my beloved, avoid these most filthy dens of the Divell, lest the snares of the wicked one holde you captive. Alchuvinus , a famous English Divine, flourishing about the yeare of our Lord 790. in his Epistle, De C aeremonijs Baptismi , writing of that renouncing which we make in baptisme; wherein we renounce the Divell with all his workes, and all his pompes ; informes us; That these pompes of the Divell, are vaine boasting, loud-sounding Musicke, in which Christian vigour is ofttimes remitted and effeminated, filthy Stage-playes, with all superfluous things. Thomas Waldensis , a famous Popish English Writer, assures us: that the pompes of the Divel which we renounce in baptisme, before we are united to the fabricke of the Church, are unlawfull desires, which defile, but not adorne the soule; as the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, with the ambition or ostentation of the world, belonging to the lust of the eyes; as vaine Stage-playes, foolish pride, and the pleasures of this evill world . To these I might adde Gulielmus Parisiensis , Alexander Fabritius , the Waldenses , Honorius Augustodunensis , with sundry other moderne Authours, who make Stage-playes, dancing, and such other spectacles, to be the chiefest pompes of the Divell which wee renounce in baptisme : but I shall conclude with that of Baronius and Spondanus his Epitomizer, who informe us: That among the primitive Christians in the solemne time of baptisme, when as they all made publike renunciations; it was the custome of the French Church, for Christians particularly to renounce all Stageplayes , as Salvian testifieth: and under the pompes of the Divell, which it was then (and now) the custome for Christians at their baptisme to renounce; St. Cyrill teacheth us in another place, that all Stage-playes were esteemed to be comprised , and so Church  & Fathers, and of All Other Interpreters Since , if Baronius or Spondanus may be credited: Stage-playes are the very Pompes of the Divell which wee most solemnly abjure and protest against in our baptisme, upon our very first admittance into the Church of Christ . And certainly they must needes be so. For if Pompa , in its genunine interpretation , signifie nought else (as Calepine, Eliot, Holioke, and other Dictionaries teach us) but Spectaculum , to wit, a spectacle, Stage-play, or glorious gaudy shew; in which sence this word is oft times used, both by . Clemens Alexandrinus , Cyprian , Arnobius , Tertullian , Nazienzen , Chrysostome , Augustine , Salvian , Apuleius , Prudentius, and other ancient Christian Writers ; and likewise by Zenophon , Cicero , Seneca , Livie , Dionysius Hallicarnasseus , Ovid , . Plutarch , Suetonius , Plautus , . Athen aeus , Diodorus Siculus , . Macrobius , Herodian, with divers other Heathen Authours , to which many moderne Writers might be added: who comprehend all Playes and Spectacles, under the name of Pompes : And if Stage-playes were originally invented by, and consecrated unto Divels , on whose festivalls they were alwayes solemnly acted in greatest pompe and state ; as all these Authours, and the premises largely testifie: then questionlesse the very Pompes of the Divell which we renounce in baptisme, can be no other but Stage-playes, with such other Spectacles, Shewes and Pastimes, which the idolatrous Pagans used in the solemnities and worship of their Divell Gods: and so the primitive Church and Christians alwayes tooke them. If then the primitive Church, and Saints of God, (who to shew their greater detestation to Stage-playes, disabled all those who did but marrie women-Actors or Play-haunters, from taking holy Orders, or any Ecclesiasticall preferments whatsoever ) thus solemnly abominated and renounced Stage-playes in their Baptisme, as the very Pompes and pastimes of the Divell; it is most undeniably certaine, that they reprobated and condemned Stage-playes in the very highest degree. And to put this out of all further question; we have the Century-Writers , in the behalfe of Protestants, and Cardinall Baronius and Spondanus , in the behoofe of the Papists, upon the serious perusal of all the severall records, and Writers of the primitive Church, proclaiming this as an indubitable truth; That all the Christians, Fathers and Councels in the primitive Church, have wholly abandoned, yea utterly condemned Stage-playes, as diabolicall, heathenish. unchristian Spectacles; excommunicating all Players, all Play- haunters both from the Church, the Sacraments, and the society of Christians, till they had abjured, renounced these lewd accursed Enterludes, which they did most detest . And shall we then who professe our selves the undoubted progenie, followers, successours of the primitive Churches, Saints and Christians , so farre degenerate from their piety, purity, zeale and Christian discipline; as not onely to tollerate, but even patronize, admire, honour Players, Play-Poets, Theaters, Stage-playes, which they so severely censured, so diligently suppressed? and which is worse, to hate, abominate, revile, condemne, and ignominiously traduce all such for Puritans, Proecisians, Humorists, Cynnicks, Novellers, Factionists ,  & I know not what besides; (an apparant argument of their grace and goodnesse when such vitious persons thus revile them) who either write or speake against them, or out of piety and conscience resort not daily to them; Alas, where is our Christianity, our piety, our godly discipline; where is our claime, our title, our conformity to the primitive Church: where our affinity, our cognation to the primitive Christians, whose children, successours and disciples we professe our selves, whiles that we thus tollerate, harbour, justifie these Diabolicall Pompes and Spectacles, which they so seriously renounced as extremely opposite to, as inconsisted with the very practise and profession of a Christian, and thus causlesly revile all those who speake or write against them? When we shal all appeare before the dreadful tribunal of our most holy Saviour, as we shall doe ere long: and when we shall there behold those blessed Patriarkes, Apostles, Fathers, Bishops, Saints and holy Martyrs in the primitive Chruch, who have so zealously anathematized, renounced Stage-playes, as the very Pompes of the Divell, which they and we have solemnly abjured in our baptisme; passing an eternall doome of condemnation on us for our perfidious resort unto them, against our sacred vow; alas, what can we pleade to justifie, to extenuate this our fact, or to intitle our selves to the triumphant Church in heaven, whose discipline wee thus reject on earth? Can wee alledge for our selves, that we are pious Christians, when as our daily Play-house-haunting proclaimes us worse than Pagans ? or can we pleade we are members of the holy Catholicke Church of Christ, when as our frequent presence at Playes, at Play-houses, and the diametrall contrariety of our lives, our actions to all the primitive Christians, proves us the very limbes, the bondslaves of the Divell? Certainly we must needes stand silenced, amazed, confounded, condemned then, for justifying, for frequenting Stage-playes now, against the unanimous execration, vote and sentence of the whole primitive Church and Saints of God, both under the Law and Gospell:who as they shall judge and doome us at the last , so they must needes abominate and condemne us now. O therefore let no Christian now be so impiously shamelesse, so peevishly absurd, as to apologize for Playes or Players, (by pen, by tongue or practice,) as tollerable, as usefull among Christians; or ignorantly, much lesse maliciously (out of an implacable detestation to all grace, all goodnesse to condemne all such for Puritans, Novellers, or factious Male-contents ; the common voice and clamour of our dissolute gracelesse times, wherein many turne professed Atheists, or incarnate Divels, to avoid the jealousie of being reputed Puritans : But since the whole Catholicke Church both before and under the Law and Gospell, with all the primitive Christians, Fathers, Councels, of all Nations, all places, have thus unanimously proclaimed an everlasting professed hostility, and passed such a finall doome and execration against Players and Stage- playes; let this eternally convince our conscience, close up our mouths, alter our resolutions, reforme our Play-haunting lives,  & cause us readily to subscribe to this 47. Play-confounding Argument, against which there can be no resistance, with which I shall conclude this Scene. That which the whole Church of God, both before and under the Law and Gospell, together with all the Iewes and faithfull Saints before, and primitive Christians in & since our Saviours time, have professedly abominated, rejected, condemned in the very highest degree, even as the very workes and Pomps of the Divell, must undovbtedly be extremely sinfull and utterly unlawfull unto Christians: as is evident by 1 Cor. 10. 32. Phil. 4. 8. Hom 12. 16, 17. 1 Cor. 1. 10. cap. 14. 23, 24, 25, 32: with sundry other Scriptures. But the whole primitive Church of God, both before and under the Law and Gospell, together with all the Iewes and faithfull Saints before, and primitive Christians in and since our Saviours time, have professedly abominated, rejected, condemned Stage-playes in the very highest degree, even as the very workes and pompes of the Divel; as is evident by the premises. Therefore they must undoubtedly be extremely sinfull and utterly unlawfull unto Christians. Let us therefore henceforth walke in the way of these good men, and keepe the pathes of the righteous: becomming followers of these blessed primitive Christians , as well in renouncing Stage-playes as in points of faith. The third Squadron of Authorities, is made up of ancient and moderne, generall, nationall, provinciall Councels and Synodes, both of the West and Easterne Churches: of divers Ecclesiasticall and imperiall Constitutions, which either expresly or by way of necessary consequence prohibit Stage- playes; excommunicating and censuring all Stage-playes, all Play-haunters; and inhibiting all manner of Christians, (especially Clergy men) to act any theatricall Enterludes, or to be present at them, under severe penalties. To begin with Councels and Synods; I shall here enumerate them in their Order, according to their severall antiquities, without any variation from their Latine names, which I shall still retaine for greater certainty, since I finde them variously englished: setting downe their severall Canons both in Latine & English for the Readers better satisfaction; inserting likewise here and there some other Canons not altogether impertinent to this Discourse. The first Councell against Stage-playes, Players and Play-haunters, is, Concilium Eliberinum in Spaine , about the yeare of our Lord 305, consisting of 19. Bishops : Where I finde these three subsequent Canons most pertinent to our purpose: viz: Canon : 57. 62. 67. Canon : 57. Matron ae, vel earum mariti, vestimenta sua ad ornandam seculariter pompam non dent. Et si fecerint, triennij tempore abstineant. Can: 57. Matrons, or their husbands may not give (or lend) their garments, to adorne any secular Playes or shewes: If they doe, let the be excomunicated for 3 yeares. --- Canon : 62. Si Augur aut Pantomimi credere voluerunt, placuit, ut prius artibus suis renuncient, et tunc demum suscipiantur, ita ut ulterius non revertantur. Quod si facere contra interdictum tentaverint, projiciantur ab Ecclesia.    Can: 62. If any Southsayer or Stage-player will beleeve, we ordaine, that they first renounce their Arts, & then after a while they may be received, so that they returne unto them no more. But if they shall attempt to doe contrary to this injunction, let them be cast out by the Church. Canon : 67. Prohibendum, ne qua fidelis vel catechumena, aut Comicos, aut viros scenicos habeat; qu aecumque haec fecerit, a communione a[illeg.] ceatur.    Can:67 We prohibit, that no beleeving woman or catechumenist entertain or marry any Comedians or stage-players; who ever shal doe it, let her be excommunicated. A sufficient evidence, how execrably detestable all Stage-players and Play-patrons, together with their Stage-playes were unto the primitive Church and Christians, who would neither admit them into the Church, nor permit them to continue in the Church being admitted, till they had utterly renounced Stage-playes; the very lending of clothes to act Stage- playes in, and the very marrying with, or harbouring of a Stage-player incurring three yeares excommunication both from the Church, the Sacraments, and the very society of Christians. The second Councell, is Concilium Arelatense 1\. held under Constantine the Great , in the Citty of Narbo in France , about the yeare of Christ 314, consisting of 600 Bishops, as Ado Viennensis informes us : where I finde this Canon against Stage-players, intituled De his qui conveniunt in Theatris : and so by consequence against Stage-playes too. Canon : 5. De Theatricis, et ipsos placuit, quamdiu agunt, a communione separari.    Can: 5. Concerning Stage-players, we have thought meet to excommunicate them, as long as they continue to act. --- The third, is, Concilium Arelatense 2\. about the yeare of our Lord 326. at which there were present some 38 Bishops , and some 50 Elders and Deacons : where this Canon was promulgated. Canon : 20. Deagitatoribus sive theatricis, qui fideles sunt, placuit, eos, qu amdiu agunt, a communione separari.    Can: 20. Concerning Actors or Stage-players, who are Christians, we decree them to be excommunicated as long as they persevere to Play. --- The fourth, is, Concilium Laodicenum , in Phrygia Pacatiana , about the yeare of our Lord 364\. as some affirme, others placing it sooner, others later; at which most of the Bishops in Asia were present: where I meete with these two Canons, against Dancing and Stage-playes. Can : 53. Non oportet Christianos ad nuptias euntes vel balare vel saltare; sed cast e caenare vel prandere, sicut competit Christianis.    Can: 53. Christians going to weddings ought neither wantonly to sing, nor yet to dance; but to suppe or dine soberly as becommeth Christians. --- Which Canon extending principally to dancing, is ratified and revived by Concilium Ilerdense Can. ult : which hath this title: Vt in Christianorum nuptijs non saltetur. Canon : 54. Non oporte Ministros Altaris, vel quoslibet Clericos spectaculis aliquibus qu ae aut in nuptijs, aut in scenis exhibentur, interesse: sed antequam thylemici ingrediantur, surgere eos, et de convivio abire.    Can: 54. Ministers of the Altar, or any other Clergymen, ought not to bee present at any stage-playes that are acted either at marriages or in play-houses: but before the Players or Fidlers enter, they ought to arise, and depart from the feast. --- Which latter Canon though it extends onely to Clergy men in words, yet the equity of it reacheth indifferently to all Christians, as the former Canon doth in positive tearmes. The fifth is, Concilium Hipponense, Anno 393 . wherethere were divers Bishops: in which there were two Canons made against Stage-playes and Actors; to wit, Canon : 13.  & 35\. being the very same with the 11. & 35\. Canons of the 3\. Councell of Carthage next ensuing, to which I shall refer you: wherein all the Canons of this Councell of Hippo were abbreviated and confirmed. The sixth is, Concilium Carthaginense in Africa , about the yeare of our Lord 397, or 399: consisting of Bishops , of which St. Augustine , then Bishop of Hippo , was one: where these two Canons were composed out of the 13. and 35. Canons of the forementioned Councel of Hippo. . Canon : 11. Vt silij Episcoporum vel Clericorum, spectacula secularia non exhibeant, sed nec spectent, quandoquidem ab spectaculo et omnes Laici prohihibeantur. Semper enim Christianis omnibus hoc interdictum est, ut ubi blasphemi sunt, non accedant.    Can: 11. That the sonnes of Bishops and Clergy men shall neither exhibit, nor yet so much as beholde any secular Enterludes, since that even all Lay-men are prohibited from stage-playes. For this hath alwayes beene straitly forbidden all Christians, that they come not where blasphemers are. --- Canon : 35. Vt scenicis atque histrionibus, c aeterisque hujusmodi personis vel apostaticis, conversis vel reversis ad Dominum, gratia vel reconciliatio non negetur.    Can: 35. That grace or reconciliation shall not be denied to Stage-players and Actors, and such like persons, or to apostates, who shall convert, and returne againe to the Lord. --- Which Canon admits Stage-players into the Church upon their conversion and renouncing of their ungodly profession, but not before. The Seventh, is, Concilium Carthaginense 4\. . Anno Christi 401: at which 214 Bishops were present: Which as it makes all flattering, all scurrilous Clergy men, who delight in filthy jests, or sing or dance publikely at any feasts, liable to a finall degradation : (See Can : 56. 60. 62,) So it provides thus against Playes, and Play-haunting. Canon : 86. Neophyti  a lautioribus epulis et spectaculis abstineant. Can: 86. Those who are newly baptized or converted to the faith ought to abstaine from costlier feasts and stage-plaies. --- Canon : 88. Qui die solenni, pr aetermisso solenni Ecclesiae conventu, ad spectacula vadit, excommunicetur.    Can: 88. Hee who upon any solemne feast-day, omitting the solemne assembly of the Church, resorts to stage- playes, let him be excommunicated. --- Stage-playes then in this Councels judgement are no meet pastimes for any solemne Christian festivals. The eighth, is, Concilium Africanum, Anno Christi 408: to which 238 Bishops subscribed their names, St, Augustine being one of that great number: where I finde these severall Canons to our purpose. Can : 12. Vt Scenicis atque Histrionibus ( id est conversis vel reversis ad Dominum ) c aeterisq; hujusmodi personis, reconciliatio non negetur.    Can: 12. That reconciliatiation shall not bee denied to Stage-players and common Actours, and such like persons ; in case they repent and abandon their former professions. --- Canon : 27. Illud etiam petendum, ut qu ae contra praecepta divina convivia multis in locis exercentur quae ab errore gentili attracta sunt, vetari talia jubeant, et de civitatibus et de possessionibus, imposita paena, prohiberi: maxime, cum etiam in natalibus beatissimorum martyrum per nonnullas civitates, et in ipsis locis sacris talia omittere non reformident. Quibus diebus etiam (quod pudoris est dicere) saltationes sceleratissimas per vicos atque --- plateas exercent, ut matronalis honor et innumerabilium faeminaru pudor, devote venientium ad sacratissimum diem, injurijs lascivientibus appetatur, ut etiam ipsius sanctae religionis pene fugiatur accessus.   Can: 27. That also is to be desired, that those feasts which are used in many places contrary to Gods precepts, which were drawne from the errour of the Gentiles, should be prohibited by command, and excluded out of citties and villages: especially, since in some citties men feare not to keepe them even on the birth-dayes of the most blessed Martyrs, and that in the very Churches. On which dayes also (which is a shame to speake) they used most wicked dances through the villages and streetes, so that the matronall honour, and the chastity, the modesty of innumerable women devoutly comming to the most holy day, is assaulted with lascivious injuries in such manner, that even the very accesse to the holy exercises of religion is almost discontinued and chased away. [page 576]] Canon : 28. Necnon et illud petendum, ut spectacula theatrorum c aeterorumq; ludorum die Dominico, vel caeteris Christianae religionis diebus celeberrimis amoveantur; maxime quia sancti Paschae octavarum die, populi ad Circum magis quam ad Ecclesia conveniunt; et debere transferri devotionis eorum dies si quando occurrent: nec oportere etiam quenquam Christianorum, cogi ad haec spectacula: maxime, quia in his exercendis Qv ae Contra Praecepta Dei Svnt , nulla persecutionis necessitas a quoquam adhibenda est: sed (uti oportet) homo in libera voluntate subsistat sibi concessa. Cooperatorum enim maxime periculum considerandu est, Qve Contra Pr aecepta Dei Magno Terrore Cogvntvr Ad Haec Spectacvla Convenire.   Can: 28. And this also is to be requested, that Stage-playes and such other Playes and Spectacles should be wholly abandoned and laid aside on the Lords day, and other solemne Christian festivalls, especially because on the Easter holy-dayes people runne more to the Cirque or Theatre, than to the Church; laying aside all their holy-day devotion, when these Spectacles come in their way: Neither ought any Christian to be compelled to these Enterludes or Stage-playes: chiefly, because in practising these things or violence ought to be used by any man: but every man (as hee ought) may abide in that freedome of will which is granted to him. For the danger of the co-actours ought principally to be considered , Who Against The Precepts Of God Are Compelled To Come Vnto These Stage-Playes. Stage-playes therefore by this whole Councels resolution, are no fit sports for Lords-dayes and holy-dayes : yea they, and the resort unto them, are directly contrary to the commandements of God, and exceeding dangerous to those mens soules, who allure or enforce any others to them. Canon : 30. Et de his etiam petendum, ut si quis ex qualibet ludicra arte ad Christianitatis gratiam venire voluerit, ac liber ab illa macula permanere, non cum liceat  a quoquam iterum ad eadem exercenda reduci vel cogi.    Can: 30. And this also is to be desired, that if any man of any ludicrous art whatsoever will come and turne a Christian, and continue free from that pollution; that hee ought not to bee reduced or compelled by any man to practise the same arts againe. --- Canon : 96. Item placuit, ut omnes infami ae maculis adspersi, id est, histriones ac turpitudinibus the ninth, is ae, ad accusationem non admittantur, nisi in propriis causis.    Can: 96. Also, it is decreed, that all infamous persons, that is to say, Stage-players & persons inthralled to filthinesse or lewdnesse, shall not be admitted to accuse any person, but in their proper causes. --- The ninth, is Concilium Carthaginense 7 of 38 Bishops , about the yeare of our Lord 419. Canon 2\. whereby all Stage-players are declared to be infamous persons, and unable to beare any testimony . Which Canon is verbatim the same with the 96 Canon of the Councel of Africke here recited, to which I shall here referre you. The tenth, is, Concilium Agathense , in France , Anno Domini 506\. there being 35 Bishops present at it: where this Canon was promulgated. Canon : 39. Presbyteri, Diacones, Subdiacones, etiam alienarum nuptiarum evitent convivia: Nec his c aetibus immisceantur ubi amatoria cantantur et turpia, aut obscaeni motus corporum choreis et saltationibus efferuntur, ne auditus et obtutus sacris mysterijs deputati, turpium spectaculorum atq; verboru contagione polluantur.    Can; 39. Presbyters, Deacons and Subdeacons, ought to avoid the marriage feasts of other persons: Neither may they be present in these assemblies where amorous and filthy things are sung, or where obscene motions of the body are expressed in rounds or dances: lest the hearing and sight deputed unto the holy mysteries should be defiled with the contagion of filthy Spectacles (or Stage-playes,) and words. --- Which Councell, as it prohibits Clergy men from beholding. Playes or dancing : so it also inhibits them from drunkennesse; from keeping either haukes or hounds: and from all scurrilous mirth or jesting, under paine of excommunication and suspension. The eleventh, is, Concilium Arelatense 3\. in the yeare of our Saviour 524. subscribed by 15 Bishops; where Ludi funebres , or funerall Playes (which were frequent among the ancient Romanes ) are thus condemned; the reason of which condemnation trencheth upon Stage-playes. Laici, qui excubias funeris observant, cum timore et tremore, et reverentia hoc faciant. Nullus ibi diabolica carmina presumat cantare, nec joca, nec saltationes facere, quae Pagani docente Diabolo adinvenerunt.   Lay men who observe funerall watches, let them doe it with feare and trembling, and reverence. Let no man presume to sing there any diabolicall songs, nor to make any Pastimes, Playes or dances, which the Pagans have invented by the Divels tutorship. --- Quis enim nesciat diabolicum esse, et non solum a Christiana religione alienum, sed etiam humanae naturae esse contrarium, ibi laetari, cantare, inebriari, et cachinnis ora dissolvi, et omni pietate et affectu charitatis postposito, quasi de fraterna morte exultare, ubi luctus et planctus flebisibus vocibus debuerat resonare, pro amissione chari fratris, &c. Ideo talis inepta laetitia, et pestifera cantica ex authoritate interdicta sunt. Si quis autem cantare desiderat, Kyrie eleison cantet: si autem aliter, omnino taceat. Si autem tacere non vult, in crastino a Presbytero taliter coerceatur, ut alij timeant.   For who knoweth not that it is diabolicall, and not onely farre from Christian religion, but even contrary to humane nature, to rejoyce, to sing, to be drunke, and to laugh excessively there, and laying aside all piety, and affection of love, as it were to be glad of his brothers death, even there where as sorrow and mourning with dolefull sounds ought to be heard for the losse of a deare brother, &c. Therefore such foolish mirth, and pestiferous songs ought to be prohibited by authority. And if any man desire to sing, let him sing, Lord have mercy upon mee: but if hee would sing otherwise, let him holde his peace. But if hee will not be silent, let him the next day bee so chastised by the Presbyter, that others may feare. The twelfth is, Concilium Veneticum , about the yeare of our Lord 526. consisting of 8 Bishops, wherein the forementioned 39 Canon of Concilium Agathense , (see pag. 578. ) is verbatim recited, and ratified, as the 11. Canon of this Councell. The thirteenth, is, Concilium Toletanum 3\. in Spaine , Anno 617\. subscribed by 72 Bishops, where I finde this Canon registred, which though it principally aimes at dancing and filthy ribaldry songs, yet it necessarily condemneth Stage-playes too, which consist of scurrilous songs and dancing, as I have largely proved in the premises. Canon : 23. Exterminanda omnin o est irreligiosa consuetudo, quam vulgus per sanctorum solennitates agere consuevit. Populi, qui debent officia divina attendere, saltationibus et turpibus invigilant canticis, non solum sibi nocentes, sed et religiosorum officijs. Hoc etenim ut ab omni Hispania depellatur, sacerdotum et judicum a concilio sancto curae comittitur.    Can: 23. That irreligious custome is altogether to be abandoned, which the common people have used upon the festivals of the Saints: The people who ought to attend divine offices, addict themselves wholly to dancing and filthy songs, not onely doing hurt to themselves, but to the offices of religious persons. That this custome may be driven out of all Spaine, it is committed to the care of the Ministers and Iudges by this sacred Councell. --- Which Canon was ratified by the publike Edict of King Reccaredus, who punished the breach of it in rich men, with the losse of the moity of their estates; and the violation of it in the poorer sort, with perpetuall exile. The fourteenth, is, Concilium Antisiodorense , in France, Anno 614\. subscribed by 45 Bishops, Abbots and Presbyters : wherein there are these severall Canons applicable to our present theame: the first of which expresly condemnes the Pagan originall of Playes; the second the acting of them in Churches, which the Papists used : the third, the acting or beholding of them by Clergie men. Canon : 1. Non licet Kalendis Ianuarij vecola aut cervolo facere, vel strenas diabolicas observare: sed in ipsa die sic omnia officia tribuantur, sicut et reliquis diebius --- Can: 1. It is not lawfull in the Kalends of Ianuary to make any bonefires or filthy Playes; or to observe any diabolical New-yeares gifts: but let all offices be so performed sicut et reliquis diebus.   on this day, as they are upon other dayes. Canon : 9. Non licet in Ecclesia choros secularium vel puellarum cantica exercere, nec convivia pr aeparare; quia scriptum est. Domus mea domus orationis vocabitur.   Can. 9. It is not lawfull for Quires of secular men or girles, to sing songs, or provide banquets in the Church: for it is written , My house shall bee called an house of prayer. --- Canon : 40. Non licet Presbytero inter epulas cantare vel saltare.    Can. 40. It is not lawfull for an Elder to sing or dance at feasts. --- The fifteenth, is, Capitula Gradurum, Synodorum , collected by Martin Bishop of Bracara, Anno Dom : 610. in which we have these two Canons. Canon : 59. Non licet sacerdotibus vel clericis aliqua spectacula in nuptijs, vel in convivijs spectare, sed oporteat antequam ingrediuntur ipsa spectacul ae surgere et redire inde.    Can. 59. It is not lawfull for Ministers or Clergy mend to beholde any Stage-playes at marriages or feasts, but they ought to rise and returne from thence before the Stage-playes enter. --- Canon : 73. Non liceat iniquas observationes agere Kalendarum, et ocijs vacare gentilibus; neque lauro aut viriditate arborum cingere domos: Omnis enim h aec observatio Paganismi est.    Can. 73. It is not lawfull to keepe the wicked observations of Kalends, nor to observe the festivals of the Gentiles; nor yet to begirt or adorne houses with laurel or greene boughes: For all this practise favours of Paganisme. --- Which latter Canon comes home to Stage-playes who had their originall from Paganisme, as I have largely proved as well as this condemned custome. The sixteenth Play-condemning Councell, is, the sixth Councell of Constantinople , Anno Domini 680\. which Councell consisting of 289 Bishops, is confessed both by Protestants , and Papists to be oecumenicall; and so the Canons of it (especially in point of discipline) oblige all Christians to renounce all Stage-playes, all Stage-players, which they have much condemned, as these ensuing Canons witnesse. Can. 24. It shall not bee lawfull for any who are in the order of Priests or Monkes, to bee present at horse-races, or to act, or see a part in Stage- plaies. But if any Clergy man be called to marriages, when these deceitfull sports shall enter, let him arise and depart, the doctrine of our Fathers so commanding. If any bee convicted of this thing, either let him give over, or let him be deposed . See pag. 575, 576, 578, 581, accordingly. --- Can . 51. is most expresse in point. Omnin o prohibet haec sancta, et universalis Synodus eos qui dicuntur Mimos et corum spectacula: deinde venationum quoque spectationes, easq; quae fiunt in scena, saltationes perfici. Si quis autem praesentem Canonem contempserit, et se alicui eorum quae sunt vetita dederit; si sit quidem Clericus, deponatur; si vero Laicus, segregetur.    Can: 51. is most punctuall. This sacred and universall Synode doth utterly prohibit those who are called Stage-players and their Enterludes; together with the Spectacles of huntings, and those dances that are made upon the Stage. And if any shall contemne this present Canon, and shall give himselfe to any of these things that are prohibited; if hee be a Clergy man, let him be deposed; but if a Lay-man, let him bee excommunicated. --- [page 583] Canon : 61. Eos quoque sexennij canoni subjici oportet, qui ursos, vel ejusmodi animalia ad ludum et simpliciorum noxum circumferunt; ac fortunam, ac fatu, et genealogia, et quorundam ejusmodi verborum multitudinem ex fallaci ae imposturaeq; nugis proferunt; eosq; qui impraecatores, remediorumque amuletorumque praebitores et vates appellantur. Eos autem qui in ijs persistunt, et non ab ejusmodi perniciosis gentilibusq; studijs aversantur et aufugiunt, Ecclesia omnino exturbandos decrevimus, sicut et sacri Canones dicunt. Qu ae enim est luci cum tenebris communicatio , ut ait Apostolus? vel qu ae templo Dei cum Idolis consentio? vel que fideli cu infideli pars est? quae aute Christo cum Belial concordia et consentio ?    Can. 61. Those also ought to be subject to sixe yeares excommunication, who carry about beares or such like creatures for sport, to the hurt of simple people; or tell fortunes or fates, and genealogies, and utter a multitude of such like words out of the toyes of fallacy and imposture: and those also who are stiled charmers, givers of remedies and amulets, and prophets. And those who persist in these things, and are not turned from such pernicious and heathenish practises, or doe not shunne them; wee decree, that they shall wholly bee thrust out of the Church, even as the holy Canons affirme . For what communion hath light with darknesse, as the Apostle saith ? or what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols?or what part hath a beleever with an infidel? or what concord or agreement is there betweene Christ and Belial? Canon : 62. Kalendas qu ae dicuntur, et vota brumalia quae vocantur, et qui in primo Martij mensis die fit conventus, ex fidelium civitate omnino. --- are named winter wishes, and that meeting which is made upon the first day of March, wee will shall bee tolli volumus: sed et publicas mulieru saltationes, multam noxam, exitiumq; afferentes: quin etiam eas, quae nomine eorum qui falso apud Graecos dij nominati sunt, vel nomine viroru ac mulierum fiunt saltationes ac mysteria more antiquo et a vita Christianorum alieno, amandamus et expellimus: statuentes ut nullus deinceps muliebri veste induatur, vel mulier veste viro conveniente. Sed neque comicas, vel satyricas, vel tragicas personas indu[illeg.]t, neque execrandi Bacchi nomen, uvam in torcularibus exprimentes, invocent; neque vinum in dolijs effundentes, risum moveant, ignorantia vel vanitate ea quae a daemonis impostura procedunt exercentes. Eos ergo qui deinceps aliquid eorum, quae scripta sunt, aggredietur, uti ad horu cognitione pervenerint, si sint quidem Clerici, deponi jubemus; si vero Laici, segregari. wholly taken away out of the Citty of the faithfull: as also we wholly forbid and expell the publike dancing of women bringing much hurt and destruction: and likewise those dances and mysteries that are made in the name of those, who are falsly named Gods among the Gr aecians, or in the name of men and women, after the ancient manner, farre differing from the life of Christians: ordaining that no man shall henceforth bee clothed in womans apparell, nor no woman in mans aray. Neither may any one put on comicall, satyricall or tragicall vizards in Enterludes, neither may they invocate the name of execrable Bacchus, when as they presse their grapes in winepresses; neither pouring out wine in tubbes, may they provoke laughter, exercising those things through ignorance or vanity which proceed from the imposture of the Divel. Those therefore who hereafter shall attempt any of these things that are written, after they shall come to the knowledge of them; if they be Clergy men, we command them to be deposed; and if Lay men, to bee excommunicated. [page 585] Canon : 65. Qui in Novilunijs  a quibusdam ante suas officinas et domos accenduntur rogos, supra quos etiam antiqua quadam consuetudine salire inepte et delire solent, jubemus deinceps cessare. Quisquis ergo tale quid fecerit; si fit Clericus, deponatur; fin autem Laicus, segregetur. In quarto enim Libro Regu scriptu est, Et edificavit Manasses altare univers ae militiae caeli in duobus atrijs domus Dei, et filios suos traduxit per ignem, &c. et ambulavit in eo ut faceret malum coram Domino, ut cum ad iram provocaret.   Can. 65. Those bonefires that are kindled by certaine people on New moones before their shops and houses, over which also they use ridiculously and foolishly to leape by a certaine ancient custome, we command them from henceforth to cease. Whoever therefore shall doe any such thing; if he be a Clergy man, let him be deposed; if a Lay man , let him be excommunicated. For in the fourth Booke of the Kings, it is thus written , And Manasses built an altar to all the hoast of heaven, in the two courts of the Lords house, and made his children to passe through the fire,  &c. and walked in it that he might doe evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to wrath. Canon : 66. A sancta Christi Dei nostri resurrectionis die usque ad novum Dominicum, tota septimana in Ecclesijs vacare fideles iugiter oportet psalmis et hymnis et spiritualibus canticis in Christo gaudentes, festumq; celebrantes, et divinarum Scripturarum lectioni mentem adhibentes, et sanctis mysterijs    Can:66. From the holy day of Christ our God his resurrection to the new Lords day, the faithfull (or Christians) ought to spend the whole weeke in their Churches, rejoycing without intermission in Christ, in celebrating that feast with psalmes and hymnes and spirituall songs (not with dancing, stage-playes, dice, tables, or such like revel-rout) addicting their mindes to the --- jucunde et laute fruentes. Sic enim cu Christo exaltabimur, et una resurgemus. Nequaquam ergo praedictis diebus, equorum cursus, vel aliquod publicu fiat spectaculu. which if this Councel may be credited, are no fit sports for holy times.   reading of the holy Scriptures, and chearfully and richly enjoying the holy Sacraments. For thus wee shall bee exalted with Christ, and rise together with him, By no meanes therefore on the foresaid dayes let there be any horse-race, or any publike shewe or stage-playe made. Canon :71. Eos qui docentur leges civiles Gr aecis moribus uti non oportet; et neque in theatrum induci, nec eas quae dicuntur cylistras peragere &c. Si quis autem deinceps hoc facere ausus fuerit, segregetur.    Can:71. Those who are taught civill lawes, ought not to use Greeke manners or customes; neither ought they to be brought into the theatre, or to practise any playes called Cylistr ae. If any man shall presume to doe the contrary, let him be excommunicated. --- Canon : 100. Oculituirecta aspiciant, et omni custodia serva cor tuum, jubet sapientia . Corporis enim sensus sua facil e in animam effundunt. Picturas ergo quae oculos praestringunt, et mentem corrumpunt, et ad turpium voluptatum movent incendia, nullo modo deinceps imprimi jubemus. Si quis autem hoc facere aggressus fuerit, deponatur.    Can:100. Let thine eyes behold right things, and keep thine heart with diligence, is the command of wisdome. For the senses of the body doe easily infuse their objects into the soule. Therefore wee command, that such pictures as dazell the eyes, corrupt the minde, and stirre up flames of filthy lusts, be not henceforth made or printed upon any tearmes. And if any shall attempt to doe it, let him be deposed. --- Some of these recited Canons, as Canon 61,65  & 100\. condemne all Bearehards, Bearebaiting, Bonefires , and filthy pictures , (which Aristotle himselfe condemnes:) yet withall they oppugne Stage-playes, ex obliquo , there being betweene them and Playes so great analogie, that the censure of one is the condemnation of the other. But the other Canons are so punctuall, so expresse against them, that there can be no evasion from them. The seventeenth Synodicall authority against Stage-playes, is, Synodus Francica , under Pope Zachary Anno Dom . 742. Which runnes thus. Illas venationes et silvaticas vagationes cu canibus omnibus servis Dei ( speaking of Clergie men ) interdicimus. Similiter ut accipitres vel falcones non habeant. Decrevimus quoq; ut secundum Canones unusquisq; Episcopus in sua parochia solicitudinem adhibeat, adjuvante Graphione, qui defensor Ecclesi ae est, ut populus Dei Paganias non faciat, sed ut omnes spurcitias gentilitatis abjiciat et respuat, sive prophana sacrificia mortuorum, sive sortilegos vel divinos, &c. sive hostias immolatitias, quas stulti homines. juxta Ecclesias ritu paganico faciunt, sub nomine sanctorum martyrum vel confessoru, Deu et suos sanctos ad ira cundiam et vindictae gravitate provocantes. Sive illos We prohibit those huntings and silvaticall wandrings abroad with hounds to all the servants of God, and likewise that they keepe neither haukes nor falcons. Wee decree also that according to the Canons every Bishop in his parish shall take care, the Graphio or Curate, who is defender of the Church, assisting him, that the people of God make no Pagan feasts or Enterludes, but that they reject and abominate all the uncleannesses of gentilisme, whether prophane sacrifices of the dead, or fortune-tellers, or diviners, &c. or immolated sacrifices, which foolish men make near unto Churches,after the Pagan manner, provoking God and his Saints to wrath, and vengeance. And that they diligently inhibit those sacrilegious fires which they call Nefri (or bonefires) and all other observations of the Pagans whatsoever . Which Canon is likewise ratified --- sacrilegos ignes quos Nedfri vocant, sive omnes quaecumque sunt Paganoru observationes, diligenter prohibeant.   in Synodo Suessionensi, sub Childerico Rege , about the selfe same yeare wherein this Synode was held. The eighteenth Play-oppugning Councell, is, Synodus Nicana 2. Anno Dom : 785. or 787. in which there were present 350\. or 377. Bishops , as some record: which Councell (commonly reputed the 7. oecumenicall or universall Councell) determines thus of Stage-playes. Canon : 22. Deo quidem universum dedicare et non proprijs voluntatibus servire res magna est. Sive enim editis, sive bibitis , inquit divinus Apostolus, omnia in Dei gloriam facite &c . Cuivis ergo homini necesse est comedere ut vivat, et quibus est vita quidem matrimonij, et liberoru, et laici constitutionis, immixtim comedere viros et mulieres est ab omni reprehensione alienum, si modo ei qui dat nutrimentu gratias agunt; non cu scenicis quibusda studijs, sive satanicis canticis et citharaedicis ac meretricijs vocibus, quos prophetica execratio prosequitur sic dices: V ae qui cu cythara et psalterio vinu bibunt, Domini   Can: 22. Verily to dedicate all to God, and not to serve our owne wills, is a great matter : For whether ye eate or drinke ( saith the divine Apostle ) or whatsoever ye doe, doe all to the praise and glory of God,  &c. It is necessary therefore for every man to eate that he may live; and those who live a married life, and have children, and are of a lay condition, for them to eate men and women together is farre from all reproofe, if so be they give thankes to him who giveth foode; not with Stage- playes, or certaine theatricall practises, or with satanicall songs, or citheredicall and meretricious tunes which the propheticall execration pursueth in these words : Woe unto them who drinke wine with the harpe and viol, but they regard not the worke of the Lord,  & the operation of his --- mini aute opera non respiciunt, et opera manuu ejus non considerant . Et sicubi tales fuerint inter Christianos, corrigantur.    hands they consider not. And if there be any such as these among Christians, let them be severely punished. Which Canon teacheth us, First, that Stage-playes and ribaldry songs or musick, are no fit pastimes for Christians to praise the Lord withall on festivall and solemne seasons. Which condemnes the atheisticall, if not diabolicall practise of those heathen Christians, who use them most at such times as these. Secondly, that they are directly contrary to the Scripture, and utterly unlawfull, not onely to Ministers, but to lay men too. Thirdly, that those Christians who frequent or use them, ought to be severely punished, by the expresse resolution of this whole generall Councell, in which all Christian Churches, were present by their Delegates. The nineteenth, is, Synodus Turonensis 3\. under Charles the Great, Anno Christi 813\. which determines thus of Stage-players and their Enterludes, that all Christians should avoid them , as the ensuing Canons testifie. Canon : 7. Ab omnibus qu aecuq: ad auriu et ad oculoru pertinent illicebras, unde vigor animi emolliri posse credatur (quod de aliquibus generibus musicorum, aliisq; nonnullis rebus sentiri potest) Dei sacerdotes abstinere debent: quia per auriu oculoruq; illicebras vitioru turba ad anima ingredi solet. Histrionum quoq; turpiu, et obscaenorum insolentias jocorum, et ipsi omnino    Can: 7. The Ministers of God ought to abstaine from all allurements whatsoever, belonging either to the eares or eyes, from whence the vigour of the minde may be thought to be effeminated, (which may be conceived of certaine kindes of musicke, and some other things:) because through the intisements of the eyes and eares, the troope of vices is wont to enter into the soule. They ought likewise wholly to eschew the insolencies of filthy Stage-players, and of obscene --- effugere, caeterisque effugienda praedicare debent.   iests, and also to preach to others, that they ought to be avoided. Canon 8\. Sacerdotibus non expedit, secularibus et turpibus quibuslibet interesse jocis: venationes quoque ferarum vel avium minime sectentur. Can:8. It is not expedient that Ministers should be present at any secular and dishonest Playes or sports; neither may they follow the hunting either of wilde beasts or birds. --- The twentieth, is, Synodus Cabilonensis 2\. under Charles the Great, Anno Christi 813\. which defines thus of Players and Stage-playes; that not onely Clergy men, but even all manner of Christians ought wholly to abandon them : Witnesse this Canon which is almost the same with the last recited. Can : 9. Ab omnibus oculorum auriumq; illecebris sacerdotes abstinere debent, et canum, accipitrum, falconu, vel c aeteraru hujusmodi reru curam parvi pendere; et histrionum sive scurronum, et turpium, seu obscaenorum jocorum insolentiam, non solum ipsi respuant, verum etiam fidelibus respuenda percenseant.    Can:9. Ministers ought to abstaine from all wanton entisements of the eyes and eares, and to neglect or disregard the care of dogges, haukes, falcons, and suche other things: and not onely they themselves ought to contemne the insolency of Stage-players, Iesters, and of filthy or obscene jests and pastimes, but likewise to beleeve and teach, that they ought to bee rejected to all faithfull Christians. --- The 21. is, Concilium Moguntiacum under the same Emperour Anno 813\. where I finde this Canon. Canon : 14. Ministri autem Altaris Domini,    Can: 14. We decree that the Ministers of the Lords Altar --- vel monachi, nobis placuit ut a negotijs secularibus omnino abstineant. Multa sunt secularia negotia &c. videlicet, conductores aut procuratores esse secularium reru: turpis verbi vel facti joculatorem esse, vel jocum seculare diligere, aleas amare, ornamentu inconveniens proposito suo quaerere, in delicijs vivere velle, gulam et ebrietate sequi; canes et aves sequi ad venandum. Ecce talia et his similia ( under which all Stageplayes are included) ministris altaris Domini, et monachis omnino cotradicimus, de quibus dicit Apostolus. Nemo militans Deo, implicat se negotiss secularibus. & Monkes shall altogether abstaine from secular affaires. Now there are many secular businesses; as to be hirers or sollicitors of secular affaires; to be a jester or actour of filthy words or deedes; or to love a secular jest; to affect dicing; to seeke after such attire or ornaments which are inconvenient for his degree, to desire to live in pleasures, to follow hounds and haukes a hunting. Loe these and such like things (which include all stage-playes, dancing, and scurrilous songs and musicke) wee altogether forbid the Ministers of the Lords Altar, and Monkes: of whom the Apostle saith thus. No man that warreth to the Lord intangleth himselfe in secular affaires. The 22. is Synodus Rhemensis , under the same Emperour Anno Christi 813\. concurring with the former. Canon : 17. Vt Episcopi et Abbates ante se joca turpia facere non permittant, sed pauperes et indigentes ad mensam secum habeant, ( which many of them now disdaine to speak to, much lesse to eate with, though Christ commands it )    Can: 17. Wee decree, that Bishops and Abbots permit no secular Playes or jests to bee made before them; but let them have the poore and needy with them at their tables : (which some now scorne as a disparagement to their greatnesse:) let the reading of the Scripture sound forth --- et lectio divina ibi personet, et sumant cibu cu benedictione et laude Domini secundum Apostolum; Sive manducatis, sive bibitis, omnia in laudem Dei facite.   there, and let them eate their meate blessing and lauding the Lord, according to the Apostles rule ; Whether yee eate or drinke, doe all to the praise and glory of God. 23\. The 23. is, Concilium Aquisgranense , under Lewis the godly, Anno Christi 816\. which concludes thus of Playes, and prohibits all Clergy men especially, from resorting to them. Canon : 83. Quod non oporteat Sacerdotes aut Clericos quibuscunq; spectaculis in scenis aut in nuptijs interesse: sed antequa thylemici ingrediantur, exurgere eos covenit, aut inde discedere.    Can: 86. Ministers and Clergie men ought not to bee present at any Spectacles or Stage-playes either in Play-houses or at marriages: but before the Fidlers or Players enter, they ought to rise up and depart thence. --- Canon : 100. . Clericis igitur lege patru cavetur, ut  a vulgari vita seclusi, a mundanis voluptatibus sese abstineant. Non spectaculis, non pompis intersint.    Can: 100. It is provided for Clergy men by the law of the Fathers, that being secluded from a vulgar life, they withdraw themselves from worldly pleasures. They may not be present at Stage-playes or shewes. --- Canon : 145. Clerici contubernia f aeminarum nullatenus appetant; non vanis oculis, aut petulanti tumidoq; gestu, ac dissolutis renibus incedant: non spectaculis, no pompis secularibus intersint: non aleae, non quibuslibet venationibus inserviant: nequaquam praeciosis    Can: 145. Clergy men may by no meanes desire the company of women; they may not walke with vaine eyes, or with a wanton or proud gesture, or dissolute reines: they may not be present at worldly Spectacles or Enterludes: they may not give themselves to dice, or any kinde of hunting: they ought not to delight in costly --- delectentur vestibus &c. and yet few now so richly, so sprucely apparelled as these, who should be patternes of humility and sobriety to others. apparell &c . as now too many of them doe, who are more like to Courtiers or Knights in their beavers, sattins, silkes or velvets, then to Ministers. The 24. is, Concilium Parisiense , under Lewis and Lothorius, Anno 829\. to the like effect as the former. Canon: 38\. C um ab omnibus Christianis, juxta Apostoli documentum, stultiloquium et scurrilitas sit cavenda , mult o magis a sacerdotibus Domini, qui alijs exemplum et condimentum salutis esse debent, caveri oportet. Haec quippe a sanctis viris penitus sunt propellenda, quibus magis convenit lugere, quam ad scurrilitates et stultiloquia, et histrionum obscaenas jocationes et caeteras vanitates, quae animam Christianam a rigore suae rectitudinis emollire solent, in cachinnos ora dissolvere. Neque enim decet aut fas est oculos sacerdotum Domini spectaculis faedari, aut mentem quibuslibet scurrilitatibus, aut turpiloquijs ad inania rapi. A[illeg.]t quippe Dominus in Evangelio:    Can. 38. Since that foolish talking and scurrility, according to the Apostles instruction , ought to be avoided of all Christians, much more ought it to be eschued by the Ministers of the Lord, who ought to be an example, and condiment of salvation unto others. For these things are utterly to bee abandoned by holy men, whom it better becomes to mourne, than to laugh immoderately at scurrilities and foolish speeches, and at the obscene jests of Stage-players and other vanities, which are wont to soften a Christian soule from the rigour of its rectitude and uprightnesse. Neither is it seemely or lawfull, that the eyes of the Lords Ministers should bee defiled with Stage-playes, or their mindes carried away with any scurrilities or filthy speeches. For the Lord saith in the Gospell : Every idle word that men shall speake, they shall give an account --- gelio: Omne verbum ociosum, quod loquuti fuerint homines, reddent de eo rationem in die judicij . Paulus ad Ephesos, Omnis , inquit, sermo malus ex ore vestro non procedat, sed si quis, bonus ad aedificationem fidei, ut det gratiam audientibus, et nolite contristare Spiritum sanctum, in quo signati estis in die redemptionis . Et non post multa, Fornicatio autem , inquit, et omnis immunditia, aut avaritia, nec nominetur in vobis, sicut decet sanctis; aut turpitudo, aut stultiloquium, aut scurrilitas, qu ae ad rem non pertinent; sed magis gratiarum actio . Et Esaias: Cythara et lyra, et tympanum, et tibia, et vinum in convivijs vestris, et opus Domini non respicitis, nec opera manuum ejus consideratis . Sunt et alia hujusce rei innumera exempla, qu ae prospecta et diligenter animadversa, non solum sacerdotibus, verum etia caeteris fidelibus magno terrore sint necesse est; ne dum his contra fas se    of it in the day of judgement. Paul to the Ephesians, saith : Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the edification of faith, that it may administer grace to the hearers, and grieve not the holy Spirit by which ye are sealed to the day of redemption. And not much after, he saith : But fornication and all uncleannesse, or covetousnesse, let it not be named among you, as becommeth Saints; neither filthinesse, nor foolish talking or scurrility, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thankes. And Esay : The harpe, and the violl, and the tabret and pipe, and wine are in their feasts, but they regard not the worke of the Lord, nor consider the operation of his hands. There are other innumerable examples of this matter, which being seene and diligently considered, must needes bring great terrour, not onely to Ministers, but also to other Christians; lest whiles they subject themselves to these things against right, they neglect the salvation of their soules. Wherefore it subdut, animae suae salute negligant. Proinde nobis omnibus in comune visu fuit, ut si qui sacerdotum hactenus his vanitatibus usi fuerint, ab his deinceps Domino adjuvante, prorsus se cavere debere meminerint.   hath seemed good to us all in common, that if any Ministers have hitherto used any of these vanities, that from henceforth they remember, that they ought wholly to abstaine from these things. So that not onely Clergie men, but even all Christians are prohibited from Stage-playes, under perill of the losse and hazard of their soules , by this Councell, which hath doomed Stage-playes to be scurrilous, filthy and unlawfull pleasures, contrary to Gods word, which defile both the eyes, the eares and soules of the spectators. The 25. is Synodus Moguntina, sub Rabano Archiepiscopo, Anno 847\. Where I finde this Canon against Clergy mens resort to Playes. Canon : 13. Providendum necessari o est, ut Clerici a secularibus negotijs omnino abstineant &c. Multa autem sunt secularia negotia: turpis verbi vel facti joculatore esse, vel jocum seculare diligere, aleas amare &c. ( as before in Concil: Mogunt: can . 21. ) Qu ae omnia Ministris Altaris interdicimus; hortantes eos ante se joca secularia vel turpia fieri non permittere &c.    Can: 13. It is necessarily to be provided, that Clergy men wholly abstaine from secular affaires &c. But there are many secular businesses: as to be a jester or actor of any filthy word or deed as is the Clown in Stage-playes) to love a secular jest, to affect dice-play &c. All which wee interdict to Ministers of the Altar; exhorting them not to suffer any worldly or filthy jests or playes to be made before them &c. as in Synodo Rhemensi before Can. 22. --- The 26. is Synodus Constantipolitana 8 Anno Christi 867, or 870 as others place it, consisting of 373 Bishops; which is commonly stiled, the 8 generall Councell; wherein the personating of a Bishop (and so by consequence of other persons) is thus severely prohibited. Canon :16. Colligere licet, solenne fuisse in aulis principum statis quibusdam diebus, componere alique laicum insignibus Episcopalibus, qui et tonsura et c aeteris ornamentis personatu Episcopu ageret; et creasse etia ridiculu Patriarcha, quo se oblectarent. Quae omnia ut in dedecus Ecclesiae accersita, prohibentur sub gravibus censuris.    Can:16. Wee may collect, that it hath beene a solemne custome in Princes Courts on some set dayes, to attire some Lay man in Episcopall robes, who both in tonsure and other ornaments should act a Bishops part; and likewise to create a ridiculous Patriarke, with whom they might sport themselves. All which things as brought in to the disgrace of the Church, are prohibited under grievous censures. --- The 27. is Concilium Nanetense , about the yeare 890: where I finde this Canon. Nullus Presbyterorum quando ad anniversarium diem 30. aut 7. vel 3. alicujus defuncti, aut quacunq; vocatione ad collectam convenerit se inebriare nullatenus presumat; nec praecatus amore sanctorum vel ipsius animae bibere, aut alios ad bibendum cogere, vel se aliena praecatione ingurgitare, nec plausus et risus inconditos et fabulas inanes ibi referre aut cantare   No Minister when he shall come to the 30. or7. or 3. anniversary day of any dead person, or bee invited to a gathering, may by no meanes presume to make himselfe drunke; neither may hee presume being intreated by the love of the Saints, or of his owne soule, to drinke, or to cause others to drinke, or to glut himselfe upon any others request, nor yet to use applauses or rude laughter. or there to relate or sing any --- praesumat; aut turpia joca vel urso, vel tornatricibus ante se fieri patiatur: nec larvas daemonum ante se fieri consentiat: quia hoc diabolicum est, et sacris Canonibus prohibitum.   vaine fables; neither may he suffer foolish Playes or pastimes to be made before him with beares or tumblers: neither may he agree, that any vizards or shapes of Divels be carried before him: because this is diabolicall, and prohibited by sacred Canons. The whole scope of which Canon, is onely to inhibit Clergy men from drinking, pledging or enforcing Healthes,upon any occasion or intreaty whatsoever;and to debarre tnem from beholding Playes and Enterludes, especially such where any Divels had their parts or representations. The 28. is Concilium Lateranense sub Innocentio 3. Anno Christi 1215\. consisting of 2 Patriarkes , 70 Arch-bishops , 412 Bishops , 800 Abbots and Priors ; where these ensuing Canons were promulgated, which I wish all Clergy men would remember. Canon : 15,16. A crapula et ebrietate omnes Clerici diligenter abstineant, unde vinum sibi temperent, et se vino; nec ad bibendum quispiam incitetur, cum ebrietas et mentis inducat exilium, et libidinis provocet incentivum. Vnde illum abusum decrevimus penitus abolendum, quo in quibusdam partibus ad potus aequa    Can:15,16. Let all Clergy men diligently abstaine from surfeiting and drunkennesse; to which end let them keepe wine from themselves, and themselves from wine;neither let any one bee provoked to drinke, since drunkennesse banisheth wit, and provokes lust: whence we decree that abuse to be utterly abolished, whereby drinkers in certaine parts doe binde one another --- suo modo se obligant potatores, et ille judicio talium plus laudatur, qui plures inebriat et calices faecundiores exhaurit. Si quis autem super his culpabilem se exhibuerit, nisi a superiore commonitus satisfecerit comperenter, a beneficio vel officia suspendatur. Venationem et aucupationem universis Clericis interdicimus, unde nec canes nec aves ad aucupandum habere praesumant. Clerici officia vel commercia secularia non exerceant, maxime inhonesta. Mimis, joculatoribus, et histrionibus non intendant, et tabernas prorsus evitent, nisi forte causa necessitatis in itinere constituti. Ad aleas vel taxillos non ludant, nec hujusmodi ludis intersint. This Councell and Canon was received in England.   to drinke healthes ( or equall cuppes) after their manner, and hee in the judgement of such is most applauded, who makes most drunke, and quaffes off most cups. And if any offend in these things, unlesse hee shall give competent satisfaction being admonished by his superiour, let him be suspended from his benefice or office. We prohibit hunting and hauking to all Clergy men, whence they may not presume to keepe either dogs or hawks to hawk with. Clergy men may not manage secular offices or affaires, especially such as are dishonest. Let them not addict themselves to tumblers, jesters,  & Stage-players, and let them wholly avoid tavernes,unles perchance in case of necessity, when they are in a journey. Let them not play at dice or tables, nor yet be present at such Playes. The 29. is Concilium apud Castrum Gonterij Anno 1231 . which decreeth in this manner. Statuimus, quod Clerici ribaldi, maxime qui Goliardi vulgo dicuntur et nuncupantur, per   We decree, that scurrilous or riming Clergy men, especially those who are usually called Goliardi (that is jesters, --- Episcopos et alios Ecclesiae Praelatos praecipiantur tondi, vel etiam radi, ita quod non remaneat in eis clericalis tonsura: ita tame quod ista sine scandalo et periculo fiant. A just censure upon such disorderly Clergy men, who were not ashamed to turne Rimers, Iesters and common Actors or Tumblers, as many of the Popish Clergie did.   and Stage-players, as the marginall Authours expound it) may by Bishops and other Prelates of the Church, bee commanded to bee polled, and likewise shaven, so that their clericall tonsure may not remaine upon them: provided notwithstanding, that these things be done without scandall or danger. To passe by Synodus Pictaviensis, Anno 1377\. which condemnes the dancing of young men and maides together, as the occasion of much luxury, wantonnesse, fornication, lewdnesse, and sundry other misdemeanours : The 30. Councell against the acting and beholding of Stage-playes, is, Synodus Lingonensis Anno 1404\. Where I meete with this Canon. Prohibemus clericis et viris ecclesiasticis, potissime in sacris ordinibus constitutis, et maxime sacerdotibus et curatis, ne omnino ludant ad taxillos, ad aleas, neque ad chartas, neque ad stophum, neque ad lucta, neque ad jactum lapidis, ad saltum, ad choreas, neque ad clipeum, neque cum fistula vel alijs musicalibus instrumentis, quibus com ore seu bucha luditur. Non ludant etiam ad bolas, ad cursum   We prohibit Clergy men and Ecclesiasticall persons, especially those in holy orders, and most of all Priests and Curates, that they play not at all at tables, at dice, nor at cards, neither at whirling, nor at wrestling, nor at throwing of the stone, at leaping, at dancing, neither at the buckler, neither with a pipe or other musicall instruments, which are played upon with the mouth or cheeks. Likewise they may not play at bowles, at running in the field for money or wine, at --- vel currendum in campo pro lucro, vel pro vino, ad jaculandum, vel gladiandum, neque ludant ad quillas, vel torneamenta, seu jostas. Summopere caveant, ne intersint neque ludant in ludo quod dicitur charenuari, in quo utuntur larvis in figura daemonum, et horrenda ibidem committuntur: quem ludum non solu Clericis, sed generaliter omnibus subditis prohibemus sub excommunicationis paena, et decem librarum nobis applicandarum: neque etia in ludis illis inhonestis quae solent fieri in aliquibus Ecclesijs in festo Fatuorum, quod faciunt in festivitatibus Natalis Domini. Non ludant etia ad ludum scatoru, nisi forsan raro: quia quamvis sit ludus honestus, et proveniat ex subtilitate ingenij, tamen magnam et inutile requirit occupationem, et prolixitatem temporis.   darting, or sword-playing, neither may they play at quintins, at torneies, or justs. Let them diligently beware, that they be not present at, nor yet play in the play that is called Charenari, in which they use vizards in the shape of divels, and horrible things are there committed: which Play wee prohibit not onely Clergy men, but generally all our subjects under paine of excommunication, and of ten pounds to be paid unto our use: nor yet in those dishonest Playes which are wont to be made in some Churches in the Feast of Innocents, which they make in the Festivalls of our Saviours Nativity. Moreover they may not play at Chesse, unlesse it bee very rarely: for albeit it bee an honest play, and proceedes from the subtilty of wit, yet it requires great and unprofitable studie, and much prolixity of time. Which canon regulates the sports and pastimes of irregular Clergy men, prohibiting them from Stage-playes, among other Playes. The 31. is, Synodus Tre[illeg.]ensis, sub Ioanne Lesguisier Episcopo, Anno 1427. Curati et Ecclesiarum rectores prohibeant suis parochianis ex parte nostri, ne in suis Ecclesijs, vel earum cimiterijs, ludos publicos, choreas vel alia hujusmodi de caetero exerceant &c.   Let Curates and rectours of Churches prohibit their Parishioners on our behalfe, that they suffer no publike Enterludes, dances, or such like things, to be henceforth exercised or acted in their Churches or Church-yards. --- The 32. is, Concilium Basiliense, Anno 1431\. Sessio 21\. Cap. De Spectaculis in Ecclesia non faciendis : which decrees thus. Turpem illum abusum in quibusdam frequentatum Ecclesijs, quo certis anni celebritatibus nonnulli cum mitra, baculo et vestibus pontificalibus, more Episcoporum benedicunt: alij ut reges, ac duces induti, quod festum fatuorum, vel innocentium seu pueroru in quibusdam regionibus nuncupatur: alij larvales vel theatrales jocos: alij choros et tripudia marum ac mulierum facientes, homines ad spectacula et cachinnationes movent: haec sancta Synodus detestans, statuit ac jubet tam ordinarijs, quam Ecclesiarum decanis et rectoribus, sub poena suspensionis omnium proventuum Ecclesiasticorum trium mensium spatio, ne haec et similia ludibria   This sacred Synode detesting that foule abuse frequent in certaine Churches, in which on certaine festivals of the yeare, certaine persons with a miter, staffe, and pontificall robes, blesse men after the manner of Bishops: others being clothed like Kings and Dukes, which is called the feast of fooles, of innocents, or of children in certaine Countries: others practising vizarded and theatricall sports; others making traines and dances of men and women, move men to spectacles and cachinnations: hath appointed and commanded as well ordinaries, as deanes and rectors of Churches, under paine of suspension of all their Ecclesiasticall revenues for three moneths space, that they suffer not these and such like Playes --- ludibria in Ecclesia, quae domus orationis esse debet, ac etiam in caemiterio exerceri amplius permittant, transgressoresq: per censuram Ecclesiasticam, aliaq; juris remedia punire non negligant.   and pastimes to be any more exercised in the Church, which ought to be the house of prayer, nor yet in the Church-yard, and that they neglect not to punish the offenders by Ecclesiasticall censures, and other remedies of law. And in the Appendix of the same Councell I find this Constitution. In via quilibet incedens pudicis oculis, cum modestia et gravitate, ad loca minus honesta non vadat, nec ad spectacula publica, choreas, ludos, hastiludia, torneamenta, et alia hujusmodi. Nemo ludat, aut familiares suos ad taxillos, vel alios ludos inhonestos ludere patiatur.   Every one walking in the way with chast eyes, with modesty and gravity may not goe to dishonest places, nor yet to publike spectacles, dances, Playes, tiltings, jests, and such like sports. Let none play, nor yet suffer his familiars to play at dice, or tables, or other dishonest, games. --- The 33. is, Concilium Toletanum, sub Sixto quarto, Anno 1473\. where I finde these Constitutions. Quia tempore quo sacrorum Canonum decretis nuptiarum celebratio interdicitur et carnalis copula prohibetur; nonnullos laicos nubere et carnaliter commisceri, ac proinde convivia publica, strepitus, ac choreas facere; ( a thing much in use among the Russians, who at their weddings spend almost the whole night in   Because in the time wherein by the Decrees of holy Canons, the solemnizing of marriages and carnall copulation are prohibited; it falls out for the most part that some lay men marrie, and use carnall copulation, and thereupon make publicke feasts, tumults, and dances ; (prohibited at marriages by sundry forerecited Coucels:) and solemnly celebrate --- dancing, which practise the Church of God hath alwayes disallowed :) et cu histrionibus ac joculatoribus solenniter celebrare, et ad Ecclesias sic incedere plerunq; contingit. Nos perniciosa hujusmodi cosuetedne divellere cupientes, sacro approbante Concilio, commixtiones hujusmodi, strepitus, choreas, joculationes  &c. fieri de caetero prohibemus &c.    their nuptialls with Stage-players, and so for the most part walke unto the Churches. Wee desiring to abolish this pernicious custome, the holy Councell approving it, prohibit such commixtures, tumults, dances, Playes &c. to be hereafter made &c. So that Stage-plaies, Masques, Mummeries and dances, are altogether unlawfull at Mariages, by this Councels verdict. Ab Ecclesia &c. turpitudo quaeq; merito est abolenda. Quia vero quaedam tam in Metropolitanis qua in Cathedralibus et alijs Ecclesijs nostrae provinciae consuetudo inolevit, ut videlicet in festis. Nativitatis Domini nostri Iesu Christi, et sanctorum Stephani, Ioannis, Innocentium, alijsq; certis diebus festivis, etiam in solennitatibus Missarum novarum dum divina aguntur, ludi theatrales, larvae, monstra, spectacula, necno quamplurima inhonesta et diversa figmenta in Ecclesijs introducuatur, tumultuationes quoq; et turpia carmina, et derisorij sermones dicuntur, adeo   All filthinesse is worthily to bee abandoned from the Church. But because as well in Metropolitan as in Cathedrall and other Churches of our Diocesse there hath a custome growne, that even in the feasts of our Lord Iesus Christs Nativity, and of St. Stephen, Iohn, Innocents, and other certain holy dayes, yea in the solemnities of new Masses whiles divine things are doing, Stageplayes, mummeries, monsters, spectacles, as also very many dishonest and various fictions are brought into the Churches, as also tumults, and filthy songs, and scoffing speeches are uttered, so that they hinder divine service, and make the people undevout. --- quod divinum officiu impediunt, et populum reddunt indevotu. Nos hanc corruptelam sacro approbante Concilio, revocantes, hujusmodi larvas, ludos, monstra, spectacula, figmenta, et tumultuationes fieri; carmina quoque turpia et sermones illicitos dici tam in Metropolitanis qua in Cathedralibus, caeterisq; nostrae provinciae Ecclesijs, dum divina celebrantur, praesentiu serie omnino prohibemus: statuentes nihilominus ut Clerici qui praemissa ludibria, et inhonesta figmenta officijs divinis immiscuerint, aut immisceri permiserint, si in praefatis Metropolitanis seu Cathedralibus Ecclesijs beneficiati extiterint, eo ipso per mensem portionibus suis mulctentur: si vero in parochialibus fuerint beneficiati, triginta; et si beneficiati non fuerint, quindece regaliu poenam incurrant, fabricis Ecclesiaru et testi Synodali aequaliter applicandam. Per hoc tamen honestas repraesentationes et devotas quae populum ad devotione movent, tam   Wee repealing this corruption by the approbation of this holy Councell, doe by the contents of these presents, utterly prohibit these disguised Playes, monsters, spectacles, fictions, and tumults to be made, and likewise all filthy verses and unlawfull speeches to be uttered, as well in Metropolitan as in Cathedrall and other Churches of our province, whiles divine things are celebrating: ordaining neverthelesse that Clergie men who shall intermixe the foresaid Playes and dishonest figments with divine offices, or suffer them to be intermixed, if they shall be beneficed in the said Metropolitane or Collegiate Churches, shall for this cause and this offence forfeit their pentions for a moneth: but if they are beneficed in Parish Churches, they shall incurre the penalty of thirty; and if they are not beneficed, of fifteene royalls, to be equally bestowed upon the fabrickes of Churches and the Chapter house. But yet by this wee intend not to prohibit honest and devout representations which stirre up the people in praefatis diebus, qua in alijs non intendimus prohibere.   to devotion either on the foresaid dayes or others. Which last clause extends not to authorize any publike or private Stage- playes, either on the stage or else where, but onely to those representations of our Saviours passion, or the Legends and Martyrdomes, of such Saints as the Priests did use to personate in their Churches on festivall and solemne days: Which shewes and representations were afterwards particularly prohibited, condemned by the Councels of Millaine, Mogunce , and others , before and after recorded, though the Papists still retaine them , to their eternall infamie. The 34. is, Synodus Senonensis, Anno 1524\. in which these Canons were enacted. Quoniam refrigescente nunc Christicolarum devotione, intelleximus ex nimia festorum multiplicatione populum ocio et vaniloquio illis diebus deditum. ebrietatibus, commessationibus, ludis et lascivijs, magis quam rei divinae, orationibus et contemplationibus vacare &c. Moneant itaque Ecclesiarum rectores suos parochianos, ut illis diebus easdem Ecclesias frequentent, orationibus insistant, Deum et Sanctos quoium solennia aguntur, pia mente et devoto affectu venerentur et colant: verbum Domini, seu praedicationes vigilanter et attente   Because the devotion of Christians now waxing cold, we have understood through the multiplication of holydayes, that the people given to idlenesse and vaine discourse doe in these dayes addict themselves more to drunkennesse, surfetting, Playes and wantonnesse, than to divine things, prayers, and contemplations, &c. Therefore let the rectors of Churches admonish their Parishioners, that on those dayes they frequent their Churches, and be instant in prayers: that they reverence and worship God, and the Saints, whose solemnities are observed, with a pious minde, and devout affection: that --- audiant. Cessent his diebus, ludi, choreae, commessationes, ebrietates, vaniloquia, lasciviae, ab omni vitio abstineatur, &c. Which are no fit holyday exercises, and recreations, if this Councel erre not   they vigilantly and attentively heare the word of the Lord, and preaching. Let Playes, dances, surfetting, drunkennes, idle discourses, lasciviousnesse cease on these dayes, and let there be an abstinence from all vice & c. Non solum omnem alearum, taxillorum et sortis ludum, aut interesse dictis, interdictum Clericis esse constitutionis Concilij generalis denunciamus, prout eisdem autoritate dicti Concilij interdicimus, sed et turpes plausus, cachinnos, risus inconditos, larvales et theatrales jocos, et tripudia, et his similia ludibria, nec non omnem alium ludum per quem Ecclesiae honestas inquinari potest praedictis Clericis prohibemus. Non immisceantur caetibus ubi amatoria cantantur et turpia; ubi obscaeni motus corporis choreis et saltibus efferuntur: ne Clerici qui sacris mysterijs deputari sunt, turpium spectaculorum atque verborum contagione polluantur.   We denounce not onely all. Playes of dice, tables, and lot, or to be present at them, to be inhibited Clergy men by the constitution of a generall Councell, as we forbid them by the authority of the said Councell; but wee likewise prohibit the aforesaid Clergy men all unseemely applauses, cachinnations, uncivill laughter, disguised and theatricall Playes, and dances, with all such ridiculous Enterludes, and likewise all other Pastimes by which the honestie of the Church may be defiled. They may not mix themselves with such assemblies where amorous and filthy things are sung: where obscene motions of the body are expressed in dances and galliards: lest Clergy men who are devoted to holy mysteries, should bee polluted with the contagion of filthy Spectacles and words. --- Which reason extends as well to the Laity as the Clergie: since filthy Spectacles and words are as apt to pollute the one as the other. And dare any Clergy men then after such expresse inhibitions resort to Play-houses, or behold or practise any of these interdicted games and sports? The 35. is Synodus Ratispon ae Anno 1524\. intituled, Reformatio Cleri Germani ae : where we reade thus. Canon : 4. Insuper tabernas publicas Clerievitent, nisi eas peregr e proficiscentes ingredi oporteat, ( which our English () Canons have seconded:) et t am in ibi, quam domo et alibi a crapula et ebrietate, omniq; ludo a jure prohibito, blasphemijs, rixis ac alijs quibuscunq; excessibus et offensionibus penitus abstineant. Choreas, Spectacula et convivia publica evitent, ne ob luxum petulantiamq; eorum nomen Ecclesiasticum male audiat. Can: 4. Moreover Clergy men must avoid all publike tavernes , (which too many of them now frequent) unlesse they are enforced to enter them when they travell: and as well there, as at home and elsewhere they ought wholly to abstaine from surfetting and drunkennesse, and from every Play prohibited by law, from blasphemies, brawles, and all other, excesses and offences whatsoever. Let them shunne dances, Stage-playes & publike feasts, lest for their luxury and wantonnesse the Ecclesiasticall name be ill reported of. --- The 36. is, Synodus Carnotensis, Anno 1526\. Where these subsequent Constitutions were compiled. Cessent diebus festis, judicia, causarum cognitiones, venditiones, mercatus, commestationes, ebrietates ludi, et nundinae. Contra facientes, citentur coram nobis aut Officiali nostro &c. In festo   On holy dayes let matters of judicature, hearing of causes, sales, merchandice, luxury, drunkennesse, Playes, and faires cease. Those who doe contrarie, let them be cited before us or our officiall &c. In the feast of St Nicholas , --- Sancti Nicholai, Catherinae, Innocentium aut alio quovis die praetextu recreationis, ne Scholastici, Clerici, Sacerdotesve stultum aliquid aut ridiculum faciant in Ecclesia, aut ab alijs fieri permittant. Denique ab Ecclesia ejiciantur vestes fatuorum personas scenicas agentium.   Katherine, Innocents, or any other day, let not Schollers Clergy men, or Priests, under pretence of recreation, act any foolish or ridiculous thing in the Church, or permit others to doe it. Finally let the clothes of those who act the scenicall persons of Innocents or fooles, be cast out of the Church. Quia solent in plerisque locis nostrae Diaecesis deferri baculi ipsarum confratriarum, praecedentibus mimis et lusoribus cum tympanis, quod maxime dedecet honorem Dei et Sanctorum: non enim debent ante eorum imagines baculis confratriarum infixas praecedere instrumenta illa musica ad choream et tripudia potius quam ad devotionem audientes excitantia. Idcirco prohibemus districte, ne posthac tales baculi deferantur publice per vicos histrionico ritu, et modulatione musica choreis accommodata &c.   Because the staves of the fraternities themselves are wont to be carried about in most places of our Diocesse with Stage-players, Fidlers and tymbrels going before them, which doth most of all unbeseeme the honour of God and the Saints: for those musicall instruments stirring up the auditors rather to Carantoes and dancing than to devotion, ought not to precede their images fastned in the staves of the fraternities. Therefore wee strictly prohibit, that after this such staves be not carried about publikely through villages after an histrionical manner, or with musicall melody fitted to dances &c. --- Quoniam in confratrijs primum recte constitutis, et postea in deterius prolapsis, multa conspiciuntur   Because in fraternities rightly ordained at the first, and afterwards declining unto worse, many things are --- committi, ab honestate et Christianae mentis religione penitus aliena; ut illis congruum adhibeamus remedium, imprimis ordinamus; Ne in ipsarum confratriarum congregationibus fiant dissoluta convivia, compotationes ad ebrietatem inducentes, choreae, tripudia, et caetera id genus, ad Bacchanalia magis quam ad Christianam religionem spectantia. Quod nota.   seene to be committed altogether different from honesty, and the religion of a Christian minde: that we may apply a fitting remedy to them, wee first of all ordaine; That in the assemblies of the fraternities themselves, no dissolute feasts be made, no compotations (or Healthes) conducing to drunkennes, no dances, galliards and other things of this nature, belonging rather to the feasts of Bacchus, than to Christian religion. Interdicimus, ne Clerici publice aut in privato exerceant ludos turpes aut ludibriosos unde scandalu oriri, et ministeriu ecclesiasticum vituperari possit, pro loco et tempore, causa et personis quibus, propter quam, et cum quibus hujusmodi ludos exerceri contingeret. A ludo autem alearum, taxillorum, et similium qu ae in sorte pendent sic abstineant, ut neque etiam alijs ludentibus fautores aut testes sint, intersint.   We prohibit, that Clergie men use no dishonest nor ludicrous Playes either in publike or private whence scandall may arise, and the ecclesiasticall ministery be disgraced, according to the place and time, the occasion and persons, in which, for which, and with which such Playes shall happen to be used. Let them so abstaine from the play of dice, of tables, and the like which depend on chance, that they bee not so much as present among them that play, either as countenancers, or witnesses. --- Districte prohibemus, ne sacerdotes choreis publicis, tripudiationibus, saltationibusve sese commisceant:   Wee strictly forbid, that Ministers, intermixe not themselves in publike morrices, dances or carantoes: that --- ne turpes, amatorias aut lascivas decantent cantilenas, aut cantantibus faveant aut intersint. Corrumpunt siquidem bonos mores colloquia prava . Denique non sint vagi oculis, non dicaces, non joculatores, non histriones; ea enim omnia indecora, ijs pr aecipue quibus animarum cura comissa est. they sing no ribaldry, amorous or lascivious songs, nor yet fauour, or keepe company with those that sing them . For evill communications corrupt good manners. Finally, let them not be roving with their eyes, no talkers, no jesters, no stage-players, for all these things are unseemely especially to those to whom the cure of soules is committed. Sacerdotes qui in diebus primarum Missarum novorum Presbyterorum, post festivas epulas et grandia convivia commesstionesq; exeunt in publicum ad exhibendas populo et plebeculae comaedias, maxime crassas et impudicas, et choreas in plateis, committunt sine dubio in legem Ecclesiae et Apostolorum dogma. Quare qui tales fuerunt, si perseveraverint, sciant se condignam punitionem et correctionem non evasuros. Item prohibemus sacerdotibus ne in festo Sancti Nicholai, Innocentium, aut alio quovis die stultum aliquod aut ridiculum in Ecclesijs aut alio quocunque loco publico   Priests who in the dayes of the first Masses of new Presbyters, after merry banquets and great feasts and entertainments goe forth in publike to exhibit most grosse and unchast Com aedies and dances in the streetes to the common people, offend without doubt against the law of the Church, and the Apostolicall decree. Wherefore those who have beene such, if they shall persevere, let them know, that they shall not escape condigne punishment and correction. Also we inhibit Ministers, that they neither act nor suffer to be acted any foolish or ridiculous thing, either on the feasts of St. Nicholas, Innocents, or on any other day, neither in Churches, nor in --- faciant fierive permittant, larvati aut quocunq; tempore, aut quovis in loco incedant.   any other publike place: and that they disguise not themselves at any time in any publike or private place. The 37. is, Concilium Senonense, Anno 1528\. where Inter Decreta morum , we have these two Canons. Canon : 16. Cum aute deceat domum Dei sanctitudo  &c. Prohibemus idcirco, ne histriones aut mimi intrent Ecclesiam, ad pulsandum tympana, cythara, aut alio quovis instrumento musicali: neq; in Ecclesia aut juxta Ecclesiam suis pulsent instrumentis: prohibemus insuper, ne fiat deinceps festu, fatuorum aut innocentiu neque erigatur decanatus patellae.    Can: 16. And since holinesse becommeth the house of God: therefore we prohibit, that no stage- players or tumblers shall enter into the Church to strike up any tabret, harpe or other musicall instrument; neither shall they play upon their instruments in or neare the Church: moreover wee prohibit that the feast of fools or Innocents be not from henceforth observed, neither may the deanery of the platter be erected. --- Canon : 25. Clerici neque in publico ludant pyl a, aut alijs ludis, maxime cum laicis. A ludo alearum aliisq; qui a forte pendent abstineant, neque ludentium fautores, spectatores aut testes existant. Non se admisceant choreis publicis, tripudiationibus aut saltationibus: non turpes amatorias aut lascivas depromant cantilenas, seu cantantibus faveant aut adsint. Nec in scenam velut histriones prodeant,    Can. 25. Clergy men may not play publikely at ball or other playes, especially with lay men: they shall abstaine from dice-play, and all other games that depend on chance; neither may they bee cherishers, witnesses or spectators of such as play: They shall not intermixe themselves in publike morrices, galliards and dances: they shall not sing any filthy amorous or lascivious songs, nor yet favour or be present with those that sing them. They may not --- [page 612] non comaedias vernaculas agant, non spectaculum corporis sui faciant in publico privatove loco. Quae omnia, cum omnibus sacerdotibus sunt indecora, et ordini clericali multum detrahentia, tum illis praecipue quibus animarum cura est commissa.   come forth upon the stage as Actors, nor act Com aedies in their mother tongue: they shall make no spectacle of their body in any publike or private place. All which, as they are unseemely to all Ministers, and much derogatory from the clericall order, so especially to those to whom the cure of soules is committed. The 38. is, Conciliam Coloniense, Anno 1536\. where we have these canonicall Injunctions following. Pars 2. cap . 25, 26. Vivere quidem de Altario sacerdoti licet, luxuriari non permittitur. A crapula itaque et ebrietate,  a compotationibus illis ad haustus aequales, a luxu, ab alea, ab immoderatis sumptibus et commessationibus, Concilium generale Clericos revocat universos, sequutum veteris testamenti institutum, quo ministri templi vino et cicera prohibebantur , ne ebrietate gravarentur corda eorum, et ut sensus eorum semper vigeret et esset tenuis. Et Apostolus ait: Nolite inebriari vino in quo est luxuria, sed impleamini spiritu sancto . Et iterum:    Part. 2. cap. 25, 26. It is lawfull for a Priest to live of the Altar, but to be riotous is not permitted. Therefore a generall Councell recalls all Clergy men from surfetting and drunkennesse, & from drinking of healths, from riot, from dice, from immoderate expences and feasts, following the institution of the olde Testament, wherein the Ministers of the temple were prohibited wine and strong drinke, lest their hearts should be overcome with drunkennesse, that so their sence might be alwayes vigorous and thinne. And the Apostle saith : Be ye not drunken with wine wherin is excesse, but be ye filled with the holy Ghost. --- Non in commessationibus et ebrietatibus &c . Olim tanta honestas desiderabatur in Cierico, ut ne. nuptialibus quidem convivijs ipsis interesse liceret, non immisceri spectaculis ac catibus ubi amatoria cantantur, aut obsc aeni motus corporis, choreis aut saltationibus efferuntur ; me auditus et intuitus sacris mysterijs deputatus, turpium spectaculorum atque verborum contagione pollueretur. Quid si videret Ecclesia illa prisca Clericos nostri temporis tabernarios;. tabernisq; (quasi domos non haberent) noctu diuque alligatos? quam execraretur hoc facinus? Posthac ergo non solum nullus ex clero sordidissimum cauponem aut tabernarium agat, sed. ne in tabernas quidem, nisi necessitatis causa divetat: alioquin poenae canonicae imminent illi qui ordini suo hanc ignominiosam notam inurere tentaverit.    And againe : Not in rioting and drunkennesse  &c. Heretofore so great honesty was required in the Clergy, that it was not lawfull for them to bee present at marriage- feasts, nor to intermixe themselves in Stage-playes and assemblies where amorous poems were sung, or obscene motions of the body expressed either in dances or galliards; lest the hearing and sight deputed to sacred mysteries should be polluted with the contagion of filthy spectacles and words. What if that ancient Church should behold the taverne-haunting Clergy men of our times; who (as if they had no houses) are tyed to Tavernes both night and day? how would she detest this wickednes? From henceforth therefore, let no Clergy man not onely keepe no taverne or base victualling house, but let him not so much as turne aside into tavernes, but in case of necessity: otherwise canonicall punishments hang over his head who shal attempt to stampe such a brand of infamie upon his order. Pars 3\. c . 26. which hath this title, Theatrales ludos non inferendos teplis . Olim theatrales quoq; ludi et larvarum ludibria inferebantur templis, pessimo quidem exemplo, adeo ut provisione canonica, qua hic deterrimus abusus aboleretur, opus fuerit: quem ex nostris di aecesibus jam ut speramus, ejectum gaudemus.    Part 3. c. 26. That Stage-playes are not to bee brought into the Church. Heretofore Stage-playes and Mummeries were brought into Churches by a most lewd example, so that there needed a canonicall provision, by which this most vile abuse might bee abolished; which wee rejoyce, that now, as wee hope, it is cast out of our dioces. Pars 5\. cap . 6. Denique procul absint parochi ab omni luxu: Sobrium enim vult parochum Paulus, nec multo vino deditum, ac vino potius ad necessitatem, qu am ad voluptatem utentem . Nesciat ergo parochi domus commessationes crapulosas; execretur copotationes illas, ad aequales haustus obligatorias, ( which our owne . English Councel at Oxford Anno 1222\. doth   Part 5. cap. 6. Finally let parish priests be farre from all luxurie: For Paul will have a parish priest to be sober, not given to much wine, and using wine rather for necessity than for pleasure. Let a Bishops or Ministers house therefore know no riotous feasts; let it abominate all drinking of Healths, binding men to pledge them by equall cuppes , (which healthes an ancient English Councell at Oxford, Anno solemnly censure and condemne, under paine of excommunication .) Turpissimum putet nisi causa necessitatis intrare tabernam, quasi domum non habeat ad edendum et bibendum. Breviter, vitet omnia qu ae pastoralem authoritatem aut dedecorant, aut imminuunt, &c.    1222\. hath long since solemnly condemned under paine of excommunication) Let him repute it a most dishonest thing to enter into a taverne, unles it be in case of necessity; as if he had no house to eate and drinke in. Briefly, let him avoid all things which either disgrace or diminish his pastoral authority. Pars 9\. c . 9, 10. Diligenter quoq; populus admonendus est, cur feri ae, et potissimum dies Dominicus, qui a temporibus Apostolorum in Ecclesia semper celebris fuit, instituta sint: nempe, ut in unum omnes pariter convenirent, ad audiendum verbum Domini, ad audiendum quoque sacrum et communicandum. Breviter, ad vacandum Deo soli; ut dies illa tantum orationibus, hymnis, psalmis, et canticis spiritualibus transigatur. Hoccine est sanctificare Sabbatum. Quamobrem cupimus hisce diebus prohiberi nundinas, claudi cauponas, vitari commessationes, ebrietates, lusus improbos, choreas plenas insanijs, colloquia prava, cantilenas   Part 9. c. 9, 10. The people also is diligently to be admonished, why holy dayes, and especially the Lords day. which hath beene alwayes famous in the Church from the Apostles times, were instituted: to wit, that all might equally come together to heare the word of the Lord, and likewise to heare and receive the holy Sacrament. Briefly, that they might apply their mindes to God alone; and that they might be spent only in prayers, hymnes, psalmes, and spirituall songs. For this is to sanctifie the Sabboth. Wherefore wee desire, that on these dayes all Playes should be prohibited, all victualling houses shut up, all riot, drunkennesse, dishonest Playes, dances fraught with frensies, wicked discourses, filthy songs: briefly, all turpes: breviter, omnem luxu. Na hisce, et (quae haec fere semper consequuntur) blasphemijs et perjurijs, nomen Domini profanatur, et sabbatum (quod nos admonet, ut quiescamus perverse agere, et benefacere discamus) contaminatur.   luxurie to be avoided. For by these things, and that (which for the most part followes them) by blasphemies and perjuries, the name of the Lord is profaned, and the Sabbath (which admonisheth us that wee should cease to doe ill, and learne to do good) is polluted. So that if we beleeve this Councell, Stage-playes, dancing , feasting, and drinking are. no fit holy-day or Lordsday exercises , which should be wholly consecrated to Gods service. The 39. is, Synodus Heidelsheimensis, Anno 1539\. which doth thus expresse its resolution in our case. Canon : 14. Item ut Clericorum, maxim e beneficiatorum, vita sit exemplaris et accepta, universis Clericis beneficiatis in sacris, et nostra diaecesi constitutis, constitutione praesenti districtius inhibemus, ne ludis taxillorum aut alijs levitatibus, ac choreis, hastiludijs, torneamentis et alijs spectaculis publicis et prohibitis intersint, aut talia exerceant prout poenas condignas in contra facientes facti exigente qualitate, authoritate nostra infligendas, voluerint evitare &c. Vid. Ibidem.   Can: 14. Moreover that the life of Clergy men, especially of such who are beneficed, may be exemplary and acceptable: we strictly inhibit all beneficed Clergy men, which are in orders within our diocesse, by this present Canon, that they be not present at any games at tables, or at any other vanities, dances, tiltings, torneies, or other publike prohibited spectacles, and that they practise not any of these themselves, as they will avoid condigne punishments against the offenders, the quality of the fact requiring it, to be inflicted by our authority. --- The 40. is, Concilium Treverense, Anno 1549\. which in Cap: De Moderandis Ferijs , decrees as followeth. Et si quis five Clericus, sive laicus in praenominatis celebribus festis, compotationibus, choreis, ludis, aut id genus lascivijs et levitatibus, temere aut contumaciter sese dederit aut immiscuerit, ab Officialibus nostris arbitrario; pro modo delicti, etiam brachij secularis auxilio (si opus erit) invocato, puniri mandamus.   And if any whether a Clerk or lay man in the forenamed eminent festivalls shall rashly or contemptuously give himselfe to drunkennesse, dances, Playes, or such like lasciviousnesse and lightnesse; or shall intermixe himselfe with them, we command that he be punished by our officials as they shall thinke fit, according to the measure of his offence, calling in likewise (if neede be) the assistance of the secular power. --- Which shewes how unseasonable Dancing, Stage-playes, and such other sports and pastimes are, on Lordsdayes, holy-dayes, and other Christian festivals, set apart onely and wholly for Gods worship and service , not for such vanities and Playes as these; as our owne . Statutes , as well as these recited Councels teach us. The 41. is Synodus Augustensis, Anno 1549 which excludes all Stage-players and Dice-players from the Sacrament. Cap. 19\. Item ne hoc pr aecellens Sacramentum aliqua afficiatur injuria et contemptu, ex sanctorum Patrum decreto et institutione etiam infames omnes ab ejus perceptione prohibendi sunt. Praestigiatores, incantatores, publice rei, et scurrae, et qui ludis vacat jure pontificio prohibitis:    Cap. 13. Also lest this most excellent Sacrament should suffer any injurie or contempt, even by the decree and ordinance of the holy Fathers, all infamous persons are prohibited [illeg.] from receiving it. Iuglers, inchanters, publike offenders, jesters, and those who addict themselves to Playes prohibited by the Canon Law (as --- itidemq; scortae et ienones, ij, inquam, omnes ab Altaris Sacramento removendi funt, donec vita sua improba penitus abdicata irrogatam sibi poenitentiae mulctam persolverint. Item ijs annumerandi sunt, qui alearum lusui perpetuo vacant,. quibus non est porrigendum venerabile sacramentum, donec inde abstineant. Which accords well with . Concilium Eliberinum, Canon 79\. Si quis fidelis alea, id est, tabula luserit, placuit, eum abstinere: et si emendatus cessaverit, post annum poterit communione reconciliari. And with the 6\. generall Councell of Constantinople, Can . 50. Nullum omniu sive Clericum, sive Laicum, ab hoc deinceps tempore alea ludere decrevimus. Si quis autem hoc deinceps facere abhoc tempore aggressus fuerit, si sit quidem Clericus, deponatur, si Laicus, segregetur.    Stage-playes are) as also whores and panders, all these are to be put from the Sacrament of the Altar, untill their wicked life being wholly abandoned they shall have satisfied that mulct of penance that is imposed on them. To these also are those to be added who perpetually give themselves to Dice-play, to whom the venerable sacrament is not to be administred untill they abstaine from dicing . Which accords well with the Councell of Eliberis: Canon 79. If any beleever (or Christian) shall play at dice, or tables, wee ordaine, that hee shall be excommunicated: and if being reformed, he shall give it over, after a yeares space, he may be reconciled and admitted to the Sacrament . And with the 6. Councell of Constantinople can 50. We decree, that none of all the Clergy or Laity, shall from this time forwards play at dice. And if any one from henceforth shall hereafter attempt to doe it; if he be a Clergy man, let him be deposed; if a Lay man, let him be excommunicated. Which Councells I would our common Dice-players and gamesters would seriously consider. The 42. is, Concilium Coloniense, Anno 1549\. where I finde this notable Canon to our present purpose. Cap : 17. Percepimus Com aediaru actores quosdam, non scena et theatris contentos transire etiam ad monasteria monialium, ubi gestibus prophanis, amatoribus et secularijs commoveant virginibus voluptatem. Quae spectacula, etiamsi de rebus sacris et pijs exhiberentur, parum tamen boni, mali vero plurimum relinquere in sanctimonialium mentibus possunt, gestus externos spectantibus et mirantibus, caeterum verba non intelligentibus. Ideo prohibemus et vetamus posthac, vel comaedias admitti in virginum monasteria, vel virgines comaedias spectare.    Cap. 17. We have understood that certaine Actors of Comedies not contented with the stage and theatres, have entred into Nonneries, where they make the Nons merry with their prophane, amorous and secular gestures. Which Stage-playes ,. although they consisted of sacred and pious subjects can yet notwithstanding leave little good, but much hurt in the mindes of holy virgins who behold and admire the externall gestures onely, but understand not the words. Therefore we prohibit and forbid, that from henceforth no comedies shall be admitted into the Monasteries of Nonnes, neither shall Virgins be spectators of comedies. --- An unanswerable evidence of the desperate venemous corruption of Stageplayes. For if comaedies even of religious and holy subjects, void of all scurrility, would with their very gestures and action contaminate the mindes, and enflame the lusts of devoted mortified Nons themselves . and the most chast virgin spectators, much more will amarous wanton Comedies corrupt all other actors and spectators, and kindle a very flame of noysome lusts within their breasts. The 43. is, Synodus Moguntina, Anno 1549 which decreeth thus against Stage- playes, dancing, and the like. Cap . 60, 61. Dum  a novitijs sacerdotibus hujus sacri primitiae celebrantur, ferio mandamus, choreas et seculares pompas omittendas &c. Sed et sanctorum celebritates in diem dominicam incidentes censemus submovendas, et in feriam aliquam praecedentem vel subsequentem transferendas, quo sanctorum omnium Domino sua conservetur solennitas &c. Et quo Dei gloria in observatione divini cultus magis illustretur, et fidelium devotio minus impediatur; diebus dominicis et festivitatibus celebrioribus, mercimonia, tripudia, saltationes, quas damnat Concilium Toletanum, et prophana spectacula, decernimus non permittenda; simul etiam ludicra quaedam a pietate aliena, et theatris, quam Templis aptiora, censemus in Ecclesijs non admittenda.    Cap: 60, 61. We seriously command, that whiles the first fruites of this sacrifice are celebrated by new-ordained Priests, dances and all secular shewes be wholly omitted &c. Wee likewise decree, that those solemnities of the Saints which happen upon the Lords day shall be removed and transferred to some precedent or subsequent holy day, whereby due solemnity may be preserved to the Lord of all Saints &c. And that the glory of God may be more illustrated in the observatio of divine worship, and the devotion of the faithfull may be lesse hindred; wee decree that on Lords-dayes & more eminent festivals, merchandises, dances, morrices and prophane dances, which the Councel of Toledo condemns, are not to be tolerated: and we likewise resolve, that certaine Playes that are farre fro piety, & more fit for Theatres than Temples, are not to be admitted in Churches. --- Cap . 74. Clerici insuper tabernas publicas evitent nisi eas peregre proficiscentes ingredi oporteat et t am inibi quam domi et alibi a crapula et ebrietatibus,    Cap. 74. Moreover Clergy men must avoid all publike tavernes, unles it be upon occasion whiles they are travelling; and as well there as at home and elsewhere they must [page 621] omnique ludo a jure prohibito, blasphemiis, rixis, et alijs quibuscunque excessibus et offensionibus, penitus abstineant. Choreas, spectaculaq; et convivia publica vitent, ne ob luxum petulantiamq; eorum nomen Ecclesiasticum male audiat.   wholly abstaine from surfetting and drunkennesse, and every Play prohibited by law (as all Stage-playes are) from blasphemies, brawles, and all other excesses and offences whatsoever. They must shun dances, stage- playes, and publike feasts, lest the Ecclesiasticall name be ill reported of for their luxury & wantones The former part of which Canon prohibits Clergy men from wearing costly apparell, silkes and velvets, which sundry other Councels have condemned in Bishops, Ministers, and all other Clergy men, who should be patternes of humility and frugality, not of luxury, pride, and worldly pompe to others , as many silken and satyn Divines now are. The 44. is, Concilium Parisiense, Anno 1557\. Where I finde these Constitutions. Caeteros dies festos Dominicis Ecclesia addidit, ut beneficiorum a Deo et sanctis ejus nobis coliatorum memores essemus, sanctorum exempla sectaremur &c. orationi vacaremus. non autem ocio et ludis &c. Moneant autem Ecclesiarum Rectores subditos suos ut praedictis diebus festis in templum   The Church hath added other holy-dayes to Lords-dayes, that wee might be mindefull of the benefits bestowed upon us by God and his Saints, that wee might follow the examples of the Saints, that wee might devote our selves to prayer, not to idlenes and Playes, Therfore let Rectors of Churches admonish their Parishioners , --- [page 622] conveniant, illudq; frequentent pie ac religiose audituri quae in ijs sacra aguntur Conciones attente audiant, Deum pia mente et religioso affectu venerentur et colant.

Let the attentively heare sermons, let them reverence and worship God with a pious minde and religious affection. And on these dayes, as it is said, let playes, dances, drunkenes, vain discourses, and what ever may offend Gods majesty, cease &c. Fraternitates eas quae ad commessationes et ebrietates ut plurimum fiunt, reprobamus. Insuper baculorum cum imaginibus conductum ad domos laicorum, cum turba sacerdotum, mulierum et mimorum, districte sub poena excommunicationis, et emendae arbitrariae inhibemus, et praecipue clericis, ne talibus sese immisceant, aut asiensum quovis modo praestent.   We reject those fraternities which are for the most part made for rioting and drunkennesse. Moreover we strictly inhibit under paine of excommunication, and an arbitrary mulct, the carrying about of staves with images to the houses of lay men with a company of Priests, of women and Stage-players: and specially wee prohibit Clergy men, that they joyne not themselves with such assemblies, nor yet assent unto them by any meanes. The 45. is, Concilium Tridentinum , which the. Papists: boast to be oecumenicall , though Protestants gainsay it . Which Councell, Sessio 24\. Anno Dom : 1563. Decretu de Reformatione Can . 12. decreeth as followeth. Omnes vero Clerici per se, et non per substitutos compellantur obire offticia &c. Ab illicitisque venationibus, aucupijs, choreis, tabernis, lusibusque abstineant, atque ea, morum integritate polleant, ut merito Ecclesiae Senatus dici possint.   Let all Clergy men be compelled to discharge their duties or cures by themselves, not by their substitutes. Let them abstaine from hunting, hauking, dances, tavernes and Playes; and let them excell in that integrity of maners, that they may be deservedly called, the Senate of the Church --- So much pretended goodnesse at least was there in this Trent Councell , as to prohibit all Clergy mens resort to tavernes, dances, Playes, and such like sports : and to enjoyne them even in proper person for to feede their flockes, and not by proxie; Non-residence being such an odious crime in those Bishops, Pastors and Ministers who have the cure of soules; that this very Trent Councell , together with some Canonicall Constitutions , have solemnly condemned it, as our owne Canons and Writers doe. The 46. is, Concilium Mediolanense I. Anno 1560\. where I finde these following Constitutions. )Et quoniam pie introducta consuetudo repraesentandi populo venerandam Christi Domini passionem, et gloriosa martyrum certamina, aliorumque sanctorum res gestas, hominum perversitate eo deducta est, ut multis offensioni, multis etiam risui et despectui sit; ideo statuimus, ut deinceps Salvatoris passio nec in sacro, nec in prophano loco agatur, sed docte et graviter eatenus a concionatoribus exponatur, ut qui sunt uberes concionum fructus, pietatem et lachrymas commoveant auditoribus, quod adjuvabit proposita crucifixi Salvatoris imago, caeteriq; pij actus externi quos Ecclesiae probatos esse Episcopus judicabit.

Cap. De Festorum dieru cultu . Ijs etia diebus studebunt Episcopi, ne personati homines incedint; ne ludi equestres, certamina, aut alia ludicra aut inania spectacula adhibeantur. Chore ae, saltationes in urbibus, suburbijs, opidis, vicis, aut usquam omnino ne patiantur.    Cap. Of the observation of holy-dayes. On these dayes the Bishops shall endeavour, that no man goe disguised; that no Cirque-playes, combates, or other pastimes or vaine spectacles be exhibited. Let no morrice-dances be suffered in Citties, suburbes, townes, villages, or in any other place whatsoever. Cap. De armis, ludis, spectaculis, et ejusmodi a Clerico vitandis .

They shall abstaine from hunting, tables, comedies, and tiltings, neither shall they be present at other profane or ridiculous spectacles; lest the eyes and eares devoted to sacred offices being distracted, should be polluted with impure actions and speeches. We prohibit Clergy men all kinde of dancing, and of play, but especially of dice and tables. Neither doe we onely [page 626] tesserarum ac talorum interdicimus. Nec solum ludere vetamus, sed eos ludorum spectatores esse noluimus, aut quenquam ludentem in aedibus suis permittere. forbid them to play, but wee will not so much as have them spectators of plaies, or to admit any one to play in their houses . And were not these ranke Puritans thinke ye? Cap De Histrionibus et Aleatoribus . De his etiam Principes et Magistratus commonendos esse duximus, ut histriones et mimos, c aeterosq; circulatores et ejus generis perditos homines e suis finibus ejiciant, et in caupones et alios quicunque eos receperint acriter animadvertant. Et quoniam usu    Chapter. Of Stage-players and Dicers. Of these also wee have thought good to admonish Princes and Magistrates, that they banish out of their territories all Stage- players, tumblers, juglers, jesters, and other castawayes of this kinde, and that they severely punish victuallers and all others whatsoever who shall receive them. And because it is found by experience, that robberies , [page 627] compertum est, ex aleae ludo saepe furta, rapinae, fraudes, blasphemias, aliaq; id generis flagitia proficisci, prohibeat taxilis aut alea ludi, et graviter in publicos aleatores, et in eos qui hujusmodi ludis intersint, quive domum ad recipiendos ludentes expositam habent animadvertant. Maxime vero efficiant, ut bonis artibus instituendis vel renovandis, otia, quantu fieri poterit, e civitatibus tollantur.   thefts, fraudes, blasphemies, and other wickednesses of this kinde, doe oft proceede from dice-play , let them forbid all playing at tables and dice, and severely punish all common dicers, and those who are present at such games, or keepe houses to receive such gamesters. But let them chiefly endeavour to effect, that idlenesse may as much as may bee quite banished out of Citties by instituting or renewing good arts. If therefore all Stage-players, tumblers, and common dicers are thus to be banished and cast out of the common wealth, and all those to be severely punished who entertaine or harbour them, their Playes must certainly be execrable, intollerable, which make their persons such. The 47. is Synodus Ebroicensis Anno 1576\. where I finde these following Canons. Dies festos secundum Scripturas instituit Deus in monumentu ac memoria suoru beneficioru, ut ea homo agnosceret, et de ipsis gratias ageret, &c. quoniam festa a creatione mundi fuerunt introducta, ut animus cum corpore cessaret a saeculo, et avocaretur a solicitudinibus et   God according to the Scriptures hath appointed holy-dayes for a monument and remembrance of his benefits, that men might acknowledge them, and give thankes for them, &c. because feasts were introduced from the beginning of the world, that the minde with the body might cease from the world, and might be avocated from the cares and labours --- [page 628] laboribus hujus mundi, occuparetur vero in Dei obsequio, recognoscendis ejus beneficijs et gratijis referendis.

But wee thinke verily, that in no age men offended more grievously and frequently against the holy and lawfull observation of festivalls, than in ours; since many consume them in following the pleasures of this world, in tavernes, in brothels, in unlawfull Playes; and in other vaine, yea, and vitious actions, &c. Let therefore the doore- keepers of the Church upon holy dayes observe and note which of the Presbyters and Parishioners shall be absent from the Churches Offices, and inquire for what cause they were absent; whether they spend the time in Ale-houses or in Playes &c. The 48. is, Synodus Rothomagi, Anno 1581\. which decreeth thus as followeth. Curatis Ecclesiaru pr aecipimus, ne sinant in Caemeterijs choreas duci, aut alios lusus et insanias fieri, sed potius ea quae luctus et mortis memoriam inducunt.   Wee command the Curates of Churches, that they suffer no dances, or other Playes or fooleries to be made in Church yards, but those things rather which may put men in minde of sorrow and death. --- Novimus et experimur astutias Diaboli ad derogandum cultui Dei,   We have knowne and tried the subtleties of the Divell to derogate from Gods worship , [page 629] et ad suu substituendu in illius locum.

For in our Diocesse through all solemne feasts of the Apostles and other Saints, to augment sacriledge, he admixeth unchast and obscene Playes in these, that hee may destroy the whole man upon the Sabbath, and subject him to himself. But he thought good to exempt Lords- dayes from faires, yet he hath defiled and prophaned them with a like sacriledge: for hee turneth almes into riot, prayer into dances, and Sermons into scurrility. To cleanse these prophanations of holy dayes &c. wee command Curates that they provide a Preacher, which may preach the word of God twice in a day (pray marke it) if it be possible, that the people may be kept exercised in piety both morning and evening, even from dinner. Wee condemne and reprobate rioting, drunkennesse, prodigality, contentions, wicked and dishonest plaies, dances fraught with fooleries, filthy songs; briefly all luxurie, lasciviousnesse, and all prophanation of holy-dayes, under paine of excommunication . Vide Ibidem. So abominable, so unlawfull are dances, Playes and amorous Pastorals on Lords- dayes, holy-dayes and all solemne festivals devoted to Gods service. The 49. is, Concilium Burdigense, Anno 1582\. Which as it complaines that Lords-dayes and holy-dayes were much prophaned with Playes, Pastimes, drunkennesse and other villanies in these words. Tametsi Dominici festiq; dies ad hoc unum instituti sunt, ut fideles Christiani ab externis operibus abstinentes, liberius et majori cum pietate divino cultui vacarent  &c.

Which abuses it enjoynes Magistrates & Officials to suppresse: So it decreeth thus. Clerici nunquam personati incedant, neq; comaedias, fabulas, choreas, vel aliquid aliud ludicrum ex ijs quae ab histrionibus exhibentur, agant vel spectent, ne visus et obtutus sacris mysterijs dicati turpium    Although Lords-dayes and holy-dayes were instituted for this onely purpose, that faithfull Christians abstaining from externall workes, might more freely and with greater piety addict themselves, to Gods worship &c. Notwithstanding it is preposterously usuall in our times,that even religious dayes are wholly spent not onely in following unlawfull and secular affaires, but even in riot, lasciviousnes, prohibited sports and playes, compotations and other execrable wickednesses . Which abuses it enjoynes Magistrates and Officials to censure and prohibit: So it decrees thus. Clergy men may never put on vizards or goe disguized, neither may they act or behold comedies, fables, dances, or any other of those Playes that are exhibited by Stage-players, lest the sight and hearing dedicated to sacred mysteries should be polluted with the contagion --- [page 631] spectaculorum contagione polluantur.

Let them wholly abstaine as well in private as in publike from dice, tables, cards, or every other prohibited and unseemely play. Let them be never present at riotous and dishonest, feasts: let them avoid places of judicature, markets, and places of resort; neither let them ever enter into tavernes and innes, but being necessitated by some long journey. The 50. is, Concilium Rhemense, Anno 1583\. Which condemnes the use of Stage-playes and dancing, especially on Lords-dayes, holy-dayes, and the Christmas season, when they are most in use, under paine of excommunication.

Let no man give him selfe on these dayes to Playes or dances, especially whiles divine service is celebrating, and the Magistrate shall be admonished by the Ordinary or Parish Priest, that hee by no meanes suffer these things to be done. Wee utterly prohibit Stage-playes and other childish pastimes accustomed to be presented under pretext of custome, with which the --- [page 632] et Sanctorum festivitatibus omnino prohibemus; contra nitentes autem poenis coerceri volumus a superioribus.   honesty and sanctity of the Church is defiled in the festivalls of Christ, and of the Saints: those that doe contrary, wee will shall be punished by their superiours. The 51. is, Synodus Turonensis, Anno 1583\. Which is somewhat observable. C um juxta divi Pauli praeceptum, qui Christi sunt sobrietatem semper sectari debeant, diebus Dominicis praefertim et alijs festis, commessationes, convivia publica, tripudia, saltationes, strepitus et choreas fieri, vaenatu et aucupatu tempus terere, in hospitijs seu cauponis alijs qua peregrinis cibaria et vinum ministrari, ludos palmarios et alios (maxime) dum sacra conficiantur laudesq; Deo decantantur aperiri: comaedias, ludos scenicos vel theatrales, et alia ejus generis irreligiosa spectacula agi, sub anathematis poena prohibet haec Synodus: praecipitque omnibus et singulis Paraeciarum rectoribus eos apud Episcopum deferre, qui huic decreto non paruerint, ut, illius ordinatione nominatim   Since according to the precept of St. Paul, those who are Christs ought alwayes to follow sobriety, especially on Lords dayes and other festivalls: this Synode prohibits under paine of excommunication (on the foresaid dayes especially) all rioting, publike feasts, galliards, dances, clamours, and Morrices to be made, to spend time in hunting and hauking; to serve wine or victualls in Innes or victualling houses to any but to strangers; any prizes or other playes to be shewed, (especially whiles divine things are performed, and praises sung to God:) any comedies, Stage-playes, and other irreligious spectacles of this kinde (so it stiles them) to be acted: and it enjoyneth all and singular Rectors of parishes to cite those before the Bishop who shall not obey this decree, that in his name they may be denounced and proclaimed --- [page 633] excommunicati denuncientur et publicentur: valde etenim est absurdu fideles, ijs diebus qui propitiando Deo sunt destinati, fallacibus illis Sathanae blanditijs illectos a divinis officijs, religiosis supplicationibus concionibusq; sacris abduci.   excommunicated: for it is very absurd, that Christians, on those dayes that are destinated to appease Gods anger, allured with those deceitfull inticements of Satan, should bee drawne away from divine Offices, religious supplications, and holy Sermons. So that by this Synodes expresse resolution, Stage-playes are irreligious spectacles, and the deceitfull inticements of Satan, to withdraw mens hearts from God, and from his service ; which should cause all Christians to abominate them. The 52. is, Concilium Bituriense, Anno 1584\. where these constitutions were compiled. Prohibetur populus prophana sodalitia et commessationes, choreas, tripudia, larvas et theatrales ludos diebus Dominicis et festis exercere; pompas instrumentorum musicorum et tympanorum in gestationibus imaginu per vias et compita exhibere; a caupona abstineant, et nihil nisi quod pietate redoleat exerceant. Imitentur Christiani totis hisce diebus sanctos illos quorum memoriam colant per opera charitatis.   The people are prohibited to exercise prophane assemblies, and riotous feasts, dances, morrices, disguises and Stage-playes on Lords dayes and holy dayes: to exhibit shewes or pompes of musicall instruments and tabers in the processions of images through the streetes and crosse wayes: let them abstaine from the Ale-house, and practise nothing but that which may savour of piety. Let Christians all these dayes imitate by the workes of charitie, those Saints whose memorie they observe. --- Clerici nunquam personati sint: a comaedijs,   Let Clergy men never put on vizards: let them abstaine [page 634] Mimis, choreis, et saltationibus agendis atq; spectandis abstineant; Aleas, tesseras, chartas, omnes ludos vetitos, comessationes, ac inverecunda convivia, mercatus et nundinationes, tabernas ac diversoria praeterqua in itinere devitent &c. Hortatur etiam haec Synodus Christianos omnes ut pro Christiani nominis honore et dignitate se gerant, tripudia et saltationes, publicos ludos, mimos, larvas, et aleas, quatu fieri poterit, devitent. from acting and beholding com aedies, Stage-playes, morrices and dances. Let them shun dice, tables, cards, all prohibited Playes, riotous and immodest feasts, markets, faires, tavernes and Innes, but onely when they travell. This Synode doth likewise exhort all Christians, that they carry themselves for the honour and credit of Christianity, and that they avoid and shun Masques and dances, publike Playes, Iesters, Stage-players, vizards and dice, as much as may be . Which stands not with the honour of Christianity. Which Councel extending unto all Christians as well as to Clergy men, and exhorting them as much as may be, to abstaine from all dancing, dicing, Stage- playes, Mummeries. Stage-players and the like, even for the honour of religion, is an unanswerable evidence, that these sports, these Enterludes are altogether unseemely and unlawfull unto Christians. The 53. is, Synodus Aquensis, Anno 1585\. which decreeth thus. Cessent in die sanctorum Innocentium ludibria omnia et pueriles ac theatrales lusus.   Let all pastimes, all childish and theatricall Enterludes on the day of the holy Innocents, cease. --- Nullus etiam vestibus religiosorum hominu aut mulierum utatur ad larvas, vel scurrilia, sub poena excomunicationis ipso facto incurrenda.   Let none likewise use the garments of religious men or women for Masques and scurrilous Playes, under paine of excommunication to bee ipso facto incurred. [page 635] Sacerdotes ne pagellis, aut alea, aliove hujusmodi ludo ludant, aut ludentes spectent. Ne personati unquam incedant neve comaediarum aut chorearum aut profani ullius spectaculi acto res sint vel spectatores. Tabernas ne frequentent adeantve nisi itineris causa. A comessationibus aut minus honestis convivijs abstineant omnino: nec dicterijs aut mordacibus utantur salibus, neve sacrae Scripturae verbis ad profanos sermones abutantur.   Ministers may not play at cards or dice, or any other such like play, or look upo those that play. They may not walke disguized, neither may they be actours or spectatours of com aedies or dances, or of any prophane Play. Let them not frequent or goe to tavernes, but by reason of travell. Let them wholly abstaine from riotous and dishonest feasts: neither let them use scoffes or biting jests, nor yet abuse the words of holy Scripture to prophane discourses . A good pious Canon, which I wish all Ministers would observe. The 54. and last printed Councell with which I will conclude, is Concilium Tholosanum, Anno 1590\. which concludes in this manner. Ludis, spectaculis, histrionumq; circulationibus, Ecclesiam caemiteriumque deinceps patere prohibemus.   Wee prohibit the Church and Churchyard from henceforth to stand open to Playes, to Spectacles, and the jests of Stage- players. --- Et quonia Sacerdotu vitia ut apparere maxime et primo conspectu occurrere, majori deniq; dedecore haberi, imo et quae in alijs levia, in illis gravissima censeri consueverunt, ijs tripudia, ludos publicos, aliaq; omnia, quibus reliquos homines   And because the vices of Ministers are wont most of all to appear & to come in ure at the first sight and to be accounted more shamefull, yea and those things that are reputed slight things in other, are deemed most hainous in them; wee wholly interdict and prohibit them dances, publike Playes , [page 636] damnoso aliquo scandalo offendere possent, omnino interdicimus et prohibemus. and all other things, by which they may offend any other men by any hurtfull scandall. To these I shall adde as a Corollary, the Nationall Protestant Synode at Rochell; Anno Dom . 1571. Where these two Canons were unanimously composed by all the Protestants in France. All Congregations shall be admonished by their Ministers seriously to reprehend and suppresse all Dances, Mummeries and Enterludes. And it shall not be lawfull for any Christians to act, or to be present at any Comedies. Tragedies, Playes, Enterludes, or any other such sports, either in publike, or in private chambers. Considering . That They Have Alvvayes Beene Opposed, Condemned And Svppressed In And By The Church. As Bringing Along With Them The Corrvption Of Good Manners, especially when as the holy Scripture is prophaned; which is not delivered to be acted or played, but onely to be preached. Dancing-masters, or those who make any dancing-meetings, after they have been often admonished to desist, ought to be excommunicated for this their pertinacy and rebellion. By which it is most apparant; that Stage-playes, Dances and Mummeries, have beene evermore condemned in and by the Church of God, as the corruptions of mens manners, and unlawfull Pastimes . Whence the French Protestants (as I am informed by those who have lived among them) doe wholly abandon Stage- playes and Dancing, as unchristian & sinfull pastimes; neither will they suffer their sonnes or daughters to dance, or to resort unto a dancing- schoole, as the French Papists doe, who delight and glory in nothing more than dancing, to which they are naturally addicted; whereas effeminate, amorous dancing either of men or women together, or of men in the presence of women, or of women in the sight of men, hath beene alwayes an allurement to lewdnesse, a grand occasion of much whoredome and uncleannesse, a recreation fit for none but whores, adulteresses, &c . as Philo Iud aeus , Chrysostome , Nazienzen. Basil , Vincentius , Hugo Cardinalis , and Bellarmine himselfe , with sundry other Fathers and Authors formerly quoted Act. 5. Scene 8. most plentifully testifie. By all these 55 severall Councels and Synodes, in divers ages and Countries (3 or 4 of which are confessed to be oecumenicall and universall , to which all the Christian Churches in these knowne parts of the world subscribed by their selected Bishops and proxies,) it is most apparant, ( to passe by dicing, carding, dancing, health-drinking, bonefires. New yeares gifts, scurrilous songs , and other recited particulars concerning Clergy men, which they have condemned): ) First, that the profession of a Stage-player is altogether unchristian, abominable and unlawfull: and that all common Actors and Stage- players ought to stand excommunicated ipso facto , both from the Church, the Sacraments and all Christian society, till they have utterly renounced and quite given over their infamous execrable lewd profession, which is no wayes tolerable among Christians. And if the very profession of a Stage-player bee so execrable by these Councels resolution much more abominably execrable must Stage-playes be, which make it so. Secondly, that all Christian Princes and Magistrates ought to suppresse all Stage-playes, all common Actors, and to banish them their territories and dominions; severely punishing all such persons who dare to harbour or protect them. Thirdly, that Stage-playes are diabolicall heathenish, unchristian polluted spectacles, which defile the eyes, the eares, the soules; corrupt the manners, enflame the lusts of those who act, who see or heare them acted, disabling them likewise to and withdrawing them from Gods holy worship and service. Fourthly, that Stage-playes even in private houses, at marriages or feasts, are unlawfull, and misbeseeming Christians; as well as in publike Theatres. Fifthly, that the acting of Stage- playes whether publike or private, by common Actors or others, especially in Churches and Church-yards, is altogether abominable and unlawfull; though it be still permitted in some places, among the Papists in forraigne parts. Sixthly, that the acting of our Saviours passion, or of any other sacred history, either in the Church, or on the Stage, (a practise yet in use among the prophane sacrilegious Papists and Iesuites ,) is altogether to be abandoned, and condemned: Seventhly, that dancing, dicing, carding, and Stage- playes, are unlawfull and abominable, as at all other times, so chiefly upon Lords dayes, holy dayes, and solemne Christian festivalls; (especially on Easter, Whitsontide and Christtide, set apart and consecrated to Gods peculiar and more speciall worship;) when they are now most in use. If any here demand of me, how the beginning and ending of Lords dayes and holy dayes (on which these Stage-playes and Pastimes are more specially prohibited) should be accounted? I answer; that the Lords day (notwithstanding some late reverend opinions to the contrary) hath alwayes anciently beene reputed to begin at saturday evening, (not at midnight, or daybreaking , as some now teach,) and so to continue to the evening following. At the time of the creation, it is most apparant, that the day began at evening: For, the evening and the morning were the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth , (and so by consequent the seventh) day : in ratification of which originall law of nature for the beginning and ending of dayes, the Lord himselfe above two thousand yeares after, commanded the Israelites to celebrate their Sabbath from evening to evening. Levit . 23. 32. From even to even shall you celebrate your Sabbath . By vertue of which precept, the Iewes did alwayes begin and keepe their Sabbaths, and solemne festivalls from evening to evening , till our Saviours passion, and this present day. Neither did our Saviours resurrection on the first day of the weeke, alter the beginning and end of that day, nor yet of the Sabbath, which we now keepe upon it: For if the first day on which our Saviour rose againe tooke its beginning onely from the time of his resurrection (as some affirme;) then our Saviour could not possibly be three dayes in the grave, nor yet be truly said, to rise againe the third day according to the Scriptures : the night in which our Saviour rose, being according to this computation, a part of the Seventh day, and no part of the first, of which the Fathers and all other Expositors have alwayes made it parcell, to justifie the truth of our Saviours resurrection on the third day. And whereas some object, that it is absurd, that our Christian sabbath should begin before the houre of our Saviours resurrection, which is the ground of it; for this were to put the effect before the cause, and to make the sabbath precede Christs resurrection, which was the cause of its commencement. I answer first; that Christs resurrection did not sanctifie onely the first houre, but the first day on which he rose: therefore the antecedent part of the first day, (which was past before his resurrection) as well as the subsequent: For as Christians celebrate the day of our Saviours passion, even from the very morning, though our Saviour suffered not till towards evening: and as the Israelites by Gods owne appointment, were to begin their Passeover , the evening of the foureteenth day, not at midnight; though the Angell slew not the first-borne of Egypt, nor yet passed-over the Israelites till midnight : And as all Christians keepe holy the mornings of those dayes wherein they receive any publike deliverances, as well as the evening, though the deliverances perchance were not till noone or after. And as if our Saviour should have risen at two of the clocke in the afternoone, ( about which time he first shewed himselfe to his Disciples ) yet no man would have argued; that therefore the sabbath must not begin before that houre, ( & so be kept from noone to noone) because we observe not the houre, but the intire day: So our Christian sabbath by the selfsame reason, must be still kept from evening to evening, though our Saviour rose not till the morning; because we observe not the houre, the minute, but the intire day whereon he rose againe, which then began at evening. Secondly, I would demand, on what day our Saviour rose? on the seventh, or on the first day of the weeke? If on the seventh, then he was not three dayes in the grave; and then we have no ground for sanctifying the first day: If on the first day of the weeke, then the day was begun before he rose: for if the day began not till he was risen; then he rose not on it but before it. If he rose after the day began ( as it is certaine he did . by severall Scriptures ,) then his resurrection did not change the beginning of the day, it being begun before: (else this day should have two beginnings, and so it was begun before it began, and after it began, which is a contradiction:) and if it altered not the beginning of the first day, then by what authourity is it changed now? Neither can it be here replied, that the first day hath one beginning, and the Sabbath or Lords day another: for as it is said of the seventh day: that the seventh day is the sabbath, and the sabbath the seventh day : so it may be truly said; that the Lords day is the first day of the weeke, and the first day of the weeke the Lords day , they having both the selfe-same limits. Thirdly, no Scripture informes us, that our Saviours resurrection changed the beginning or end of the sabbath, that it should now begin at midnight, or morning, not at evening; therefore it keepes the selfesame beginning and end it had before. Neither doth the objected reason, ( viz : that the cause should precede the effect, (warranted by no Scripture,) prove any thing at all. Indeed if any had celebrated the first day as a sabbath, before our Saviour had risen, the reason had beene good: but since our Saviour was risen againe before the first day was ever kept holy; and since his resurrection on it was the cause why Christians subsequently observed the whole day, not the very minute or houre on which he rose, or that part onely of the day which remained after he was risen; the reason is of no weight at all: For if our Saviours resurrection should not extend to consecrate that part of the first day which preceded it, because the effect should not goe before the cause: a man might by the selfesame reason argue; that our Saviours passion did not relate a parte ante to save those beleevers who died before, but only a parte post , to redeeme such onely who departed after his incarnation: which were blasphemy for to thinke; since our Saviour was virtually and in destination (though not actually) . a lambe slaine from the beginning of the world . Now that the Christian sabbath or Lords day begins at even, and so ought to be sanctified from even to even, not from morning to morning, or from midnight to midnight; (which ecclesiasticall beginning of dayes we never find in Scripture, or in any Ecclesiasticall Writers) it is most apparant: First because we reade of no other beginning or end of the sabbath in Scripture but this: and to make it begin from the very houre or minute of our Saviours resurrection, is to make it arbitrary and altogether uncertaine, because the very houre and minute of his resurrection is not, neither can it certainly be knowne. Secondly, because the sabbath being nothing else in proper speach, but a day of rest, it is most naturall and proper it should then begin when as God and man begin their rest; and leave off their labour; not when as they begin their worke: but God began his rest at the end of the sixth day, not on the morning or midnight of the seventh day : and men begin their rest at evening, not at midnight or morning: Witnesse Psal. 104. 22, 23. The Sunne ariseth, and man goeth forth to his worke and to his labour unto the evening : and Iohn 9. 4. I must worke the workes of him that sent me whiles it is called to day: the night commeth when no man can worke : therefore it is most consonant to reason and nature that it should begin at evening. Thirdly, this beginning of the Lords day on saturday at even doth best prepare Christians for the sanctification and duties of the Lords day: For it makes them put a period to their labours in due time, it disburdens them the sooner of their weekday imployments; it causeth them to goe to bed sooner, to rise earlier, and to prepare themselves the better for the duties of the ensuing morning; and upon this ground did the Church appoint Vigils and Evening Saturday service in ancient times, that Christians laying aside all secular imployments, and resorting then unto Gods publike worship, might (after the manner of the Iews, who had their preparatio of the sabbath ) the better prepare themselves for the sacred duties of the Lords day. And hence perchance it is that we have seldome any Playes or Masques at Court upon saturday nights. Lastly, it is infallibly evident by the constant practise of the primitive Church, who kept the Lords day onely fro evening to evening, not from morning to morning ; as is evidenced (not onely by the assemblies of the primitive Christians , who met together before day-breake upon the Lords day to priase their Lord and Saviour Christ ,) but by sundry Councels, Fathers, and Imperiall Constitutions. To begin with Councels. Survey we Concilium Tarraconense Can . 7. Surius concil. Tom . 2. p . 292. Matisconense 2\. Can . 2. Ib. p . 683. Toletanum 4\. Can 8\. Ib. p . 729. Constantinop . 6.

Nec aliquis vespera dici Sabbathi, usque ad vespera diei Dominicae ad molendina aquarii, nec ad aliqua alia molere audeat &c . So that by the expresse resolution of all these severall Councels, whereof one is oecumenicall: the Lords day ought to be kept onely from evening to evening , and so to begin and end at evening. If we peruse the Fathers; we shall finde St. Augustine, enjoyning Christians to celebrate the Lords day from evening to evening, as the Iewes did celebrate their sabbath . And that the Lords day and our Christian sabbath begins at evening, not at morning or midnight, it is the direct and punctuall verdict of Dionysius Alexandrinus Epist . 1. Bibl.

In primis sacrudiem dominicum ab hora dici Sabbati vespertina inchoandum &c . to which the forequoted Authours suffragate. Lastly King Edgar and Canutus enacted by their Lawes, That the Sunday should be kept holy from saturday at noone till monday in the morning . And Charles the Great, Capit. lib . 6. enacted: that the Lords day should be kept holy from evening to evening . By all which testimonies and reasons it is most apparant, that Lords dayes and holy dayes begin at evening, and so ought to be celebrated and kept holy from evening to evening. Therfore all dancing, dicing, carding, masques, stageplaies , (together with all ordinary imployments of mens callings) upon saturday nights, are altogether unlawfull by the verdict of the forequoted Councels ; because the Lords day (as all these ancient Authorities and reasons, against all new opinions prove,) is even then begun. Neither will it hereupon follow, that we may dance, dice, see Masques or Playes on Lords-day nights (as too many doe,) because the Lords day is then ended; since these Councels prohibit them altogether at all times whatsoever. But put case they were lawfull at other times, yet it were unseasonable to practise the on Lords day nights: For this were but to begin in the spirit, and end in the flesh ; to conclude holy-daies  & duties with prophane exercises; and immediately after the service of God to serve the Divell , and to commit our selves to his protection. Wee must therefore know, that though the Lords day end at evening, yet there are then evening-duties still remaining, answerable to the workes of the precedent day: as the repetition, meditation, and tryall of those heavenly instructions which we have heard or read in the day-time ; prayer to God for a blessing upon all those holy ordinances of which wee have beene made partakers : thanksgiving to him for his manifold mercies : singing of psalmes and hymnes and spirituall songs : instruction and examination of our children, servants and families : examination of our owne hearts, estates, and wayes by the touch-stone of Gods word : together with a serious commendation of our soules and bodies into the hands of God by prayer and well-doing when as we are lying downe to our rest . All which most serious necessary duties, with which wee should close up every day and night, (it being for ought we know the utmost period of our lives, will out all dancing, dicing, Masques and Stage-playes, which are incompatible with these holy duties, and altogether unseasonable for the night, which God made for sleepe and rest ; not for these dishonest workes of darkness in which too many spend whole nights, who never imployed one halfe night (or day) in prayer, as their Saviour , and King David did . Since therefore we never reade of any faithfull Saints of God in former times who practised dancing, dicing, masques or Enterludes on Lords day nights, ( no nor yet on any other dayes or nights for ought appeares by any Author, though they have oft times spent whole dayes and nights in prayer; let us not take up this godlesse practise now, which will keepe us off from God and better things. But let us rather follow Edgars and Canutus lawes, keeping the Sunday holy from saturday evening, till monday morning ; spending the whole day and night in prayer and praises unto God, and in such holy actions , as we would be content, that Christ and death should finde us doing . No man I am sure would be willing, that Christ, that death, or the day of judgement should deprehend him whiles he is dancing, drinking, gaming, masquing, acting, or beholding Stage-plalyes : yea who would not tremble to be taken away sodainly at such sports as these, especially on a Sunday night, when every mans conscience secretly informes him that they are unexpedient, unseasonable, if not unlawful too? Let us therfore alwaies end the Lords day, yea every weekday too with such holy exercises, in which we would willingly end our dayes : then neede we not be ashamed for to live nor feare to die. Lastly, it is evidently resolved by the foregoing Councels, that the very beholding and acting of Stage-playes either in publike or private, is altogether unlawfull unto Christians, and more especially to Clergy men, (who now are not ashamed to frequent them, against the expresse resolution of all these Councels:) who are neither to behold nor countenance any dancing, dicing, carding, table-playing, much lesse any publike or private Stage-playes ; the very acting or beholding of which subjects them both to suspension and degradation; as the recited Canons witnesse to the full: which I wish all Ministers would now at last remember. If any man here object: that many of the alledged Councels prohibit Clergy men onely from acting and beholding Stage-playes; therefore Lay men may safely personate and frequent them still. To this I answer. First that most of these Councels expresly inhibit as well Lay men as Clergy men both from acting and beholding Stage-playes: therefore the objection is but idle. Secondly, the very reason alledged by these Councels, why Clergy men should abstaine from Stage-playes: to wit; lest their eyes and eares deputed unto holy mysteries should be defiled by them &c . extends as well to Laity as the Clergi; since every Lay Christian is as apt to be defiled by Playes, and ought to be as holy in all manner of conversation , as Clergy men. Every Lay Christian is, or ought to be a spirituall Priest, to offer up spirituall sacrifices of prayer and praise to God both morning and evening, and at all other seasons : whence God himselfe enjoynes even Lay men as well as others; to cleanse themselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit perfecting holinesse in the feare of God ; to keepe them\selves unspotted of the world ; to abstaine from fleshly lusts which warre against the soule; and to be holy even as God is holy. There is the selfesame holinesse required both of the Laity and Clergy; both of them ought to be alike spirituall Priests to God (at leastwise in respect of familyduties, and private exercises of piety and devotion :) if therfore Stage-playes unsanctifie or pollute the one, and indispose them to Gods service, needes must they defile the other too: and so they are equally unlawfull to both by these Councels verdict. Lastly, though many of these Councels prohibit only Clergie men fro acting or beholding Stage-plaies; partly because their Canons bound none but Clergy men, not the Laity, untill they were received : and partlie, because the reformation of the Clergie ( whose resort to Stage-playes did seduce the Laity ,) was the speediest meanes to reclaime all Laicks: yet they intended not to give anie libertie to Lay men, to haunt Plaies or theatres; for as they inhibit Ministers themselves from Plaies, so they charge them likewise both by preaching, by ecclesiasticall censures, & all other meanes, to withdraw their parishioners and all others from them . So that the objection is meerelie frivolous, and I may safelie conclude, that these 55 recited Councels have censured and condemned all kinde of Stage-plaies, together with their Actors and spectatours. And dare then anie Clergie man, anie Lay man or Christian whatsoever after all these pious Constitutions, these deliberate resolutions of above a double Grand-Iurie of oecumenicall, nationall, provinciall Synodes and Councels, of all times, all ages of the Church; after the solemne verdict of above 5000 reverend Bishops and prelates, (who were present at these Councels, and subscribed them with their hands,) once open his eyes to see, his eares to heare, his purse to cheerish, his mouth to justifie Plaies or Plaiers? I hope there is none will be so desperately shamelesse, so gracelesse as to doe it now, though they did it out of ignorance heretofore. To these forenamed Councels I shall accumulate some Canonicall Play-condemning Constitutions to the same effect, according to their severall antiquities. The first of them (if we beleeve Clemens Romanus are the very Canons and Constitutions of the Apostles themselves, who decree thus. Can . 17. Qui accepit meretricem, vel mimam feu scenicam, non potest esse Presbyter, vel Episcopus, vel Diaconus, vel omnino in numero sacerdotali Hee who hath married a strumpet, or a woman-actor or stageresse, cannot be an Elder, a Bishop, or Deacon, nor yet in the number of the Clergy. --- If then the marrying with a woman-actor or Stage-hauntresse ( who were commonly notorious prostituted strumpets in ancient times ,) disables men from bearing any ecclesiastical function, by the Apostles owne verdict; how execrable must Stage-plaies themselves and Plaiers be? The same Apostles in their Constitutions (Recorded by the selfesame Clemens ,) will informe us: where thus they write. David dixit, Odi Ecclesiam malignantium, et cum iniqua gerentibus non ingrediare . Et rursus. Beatus vir qui non ambulavit in consilio impiorum, et in via peccatorum non stetit, et in cathedra pestilentium non sedit, sed in lege Domini voluntas ejus, et in lege ejus meditatibur die ac nocte . Tu vero relicto fidelium c aetu, Dei Ecclesijs ac legibus, respicis speluncas latronum, sancta ducens quae nefaria esse voluit: non solumq; id facis, sed etiam ad Graecorum    David hath said , I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and have not kept companie with those who doe wicked things. And againe . Blessed is the man, who hath not walked in the counsell of the wicked, and hath not stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sate in the seat of contagious persons, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law will he meditate day and night. But thou leaving the assembly of the faithfull, the Church and lawes of God, regardest the dens of theeves, accounting those things holy , --- [page 650] corum ludos curris, et ad Theatra properas, expetens unus ex venientibus eo numerari, et particeps fieri auditionum turpium, ne dicam abominabilium: nec audisti Hieremiam dicentem: Domine, non sedi in consilio ludentium, sed timui a conspectu manus tuae : neque Iob dicentem similia: Si ver o et cum risoribus ambulavi aliquando, appendor enim in statera justa . Quid vero cupis Graecos. sermones percipere hominum mortuorum, afflatu Diaboli tradentium ea, quae mortem afferunt, fidem evertunt, ad deorum multitudinem credendam inducunteos, qui ad illos attentionem adhibent? Vos ergo divinis legibus invigilantes, vitae hujus necessitatibus putate eas praestantiores, majoremq; ijs honorem deferentes, convenite ad Ecclesiam Domini, quam acquisivit sanumine Christi dilecti , primogeniti omnis creatur ae . Ea est enim altissimi filia, quae parturit nos per verbum gratiae, et formavit which he reputeth wicked: and thou doest not that onely, but thou runnest likewise to the Grecian Playes, & hastests to theaters desiring to be reputed among those who resort thither, & to be made a partaker of filthy, that I say not abominable hearings: neither hast thou heard Ieremie saying : O Lord, I have not sate in the assembly of Players, but I have feared because of thy hand: nor yet Iob. uttering the like : And if I have at any time walked with scoffers, for I am weighed in a just ballance. But why desirest thou to heare the Greeke speeches of dead men, delivering those things by the instinct of the Divell which bring in death, overturne faith, induce those to beleeve a multitude of gods, who give attention to those things? But you waiting upon the divine lawes, esteem them more excellent than the necessaries of this life, and giving them greater honour, come together to the Church of the Lord , which he hath purchased wilth the blood of his beloved Christ, the first- borne of every creature. For she is the daughter of the most high, who hath begotten us by [page 651] vit in nobis Christum cujus participes facti, sacra membra existitis et dilecta, non habentia maculam neque rugam, neque aliquid hujusmodi sed tanquam sancti et irrepr aehensibiles in fide, perfecti estis in ipso, secundum imaginem ejus qui creavit vos . Cavete igitur, ne conventus celebretis cum ijs qui pereunt, quae est Synagoga Gentium ad deceptione et interitum. Nulla est enim Dei societas cum Diabolo : Nam qui congregatur una cum ijs, qui cum Diabolo idem sentiunt, unus ex ipsis connumerabitur, et v ae habebit. Fugite quoque indecora spectacula, theatra (inquam) et Graecorum ludos &c. Propterea enim oportet fidelem fugere impiorum caetus, Graecorum et ludaeorum, ne ubi una cum ijs degimus, animis nostris laqueos paremus et ne ubi in eorum festis versamur, quae in honorem daemonum celebrantur, cum ijs habeamus societate impietatis. Vitandi quoq; sunt illorum mercatus, et qui    the word of grace, and hath formed Christ in us, of whom being made partakers , you become holie and beloved members, not having spot or wrinkle, or anie such thing, but as holie and unblameable in faith, you are perfect in him, according to the image of him who hath created you, Beware therefore that you celebrate no meetings with those that perish, which is the Synagogue of the Gentiles, to deceit and destruction . For God hath no fellowshippe with the Divell; for hee who is assembled together with those, who thinke the same with the Divell, shall bee accounted one of them, and shall have woe. Fly likewise (I say) the unseemely Spectacles and Theatres of the Gr aecians. For therefore ought a Christian to shun the assemblies of wicked men, of Greeks and Iewes, lest where wee live together with them, wee provide snares for our soules, and lest whiles wee are conversant in their feasts, which are celebrated to the honour of Divels, wee become partakers with them of impiety. Their markets likewise are to be eschued, and the Playes that are made in ijs fiunt ludi. Vitate igitur omnem idolorum pompam, speciem, mercatum, convivia, gladiatores, denique omnia daemoniaca spectacula.   in them, Shunne therefore all the pompe, the shew, the market, the feasts, the Gladiators of Idolls, and finally all d aemoniacall Playes and Spectacles. Than which Apostolicall Constitutions, there can be nothing more expresse and punctuall against Stage-playes. To these Play-censuring Canons of all the Apostles together, I shall adde these Constitutions of St. Paul in particular, registred by the selfesame Clement of Rome , in these very words. Scenicus si accedat, sive vir sit sive mulier, auriga, gladiator, cursor stadij, ludius. Olympius choraules, cytharedus, lyristes, saltator, caupo, vel desistat, vel rejiciatur. Which Canon extends to Actors onely, not to Spectators.   If a Stage-player, be it man or woman, a Chariotor, gladiator, race-runner, a fencer, a practiser of the Olympian games, a flute- player, a fidler, a harper, a dancer, an alehouse-keeper, come to turne Christian; either let him give over these professions, or else be rejected. --- Theatralibus ludis qui dat opera, venationibus, equorum cursibus, ac certaminibus; vel desistat, vel rejiciatur. Graecos mores qui sequitur, vel mutet se, vel rejiciatur.   He who gives himselfe to Stage-plaies huntings, horseraces, or prizes; either let him desist, or let him be cast out of the Church. He who followeth Greeke fashions, let him reforme himselfe, or be rejected. Which extends to Actors and Spectators too . So that if the very Apostles themselves , or St. Paul may be umpires; the very acting and beholding of Stage-playes is unlawfull unto Christians of all sorts; as these their Canons and Constitutions largely prove. The Constitution which I shall here remember, is that of Pope Eusebius , about the yeare of our Lord 369. Oportet Episcopu moderatis epulis contentum esse, fuosq; convivas ad comedendum et bibendum non urgere, quin potius sobrietatis pr aebere exemplum. Removeantur ab ejus convivio cuncta turpitudinis augmenta, non ludicra spectacula, non acroamatum vaniloquia, non fatuorum stultiloquia, non scurrilium admittantur praestigia: ( A full clause against these stageplayes :) Adsint peregrini et pauperes et debiles, qui de sacerdotali mensa Christum benedicentes, benedictionem percipiant. Recitetur sacra lectio, subsequatur viv ae vocis exhortatio, ut non tantum corporali cibo, immo verbi spiritualis alimento, convivantes se refectos gratulentur, ut in omnibus honorificetur Deus per Iesum Christum.    A Bishop ought to be content with moderate feasts, and not to urge his guests to eate or drinke, but rather to give them an example of sobriety. Let all augmentations of filthinesse be removed from his feast, and let no ludicrous Stage-playes, no vaine recitall of comicall verses, no foolish speeches of fooles, nor legerdemaines of jesters be admitted. Let strangers, let poore and feeble persons be present, who blessing Christ for the sacerdotall table, may receive a blessing. Let the Scripture be there recited, and let the exhortation of the living voice follow it, that the guests may rejoyce that they are fed not onely with corporall food, but likewise with the foode of the spirituall word, that God in all things may bee glorified through Iesus Christ our Lord . Such should Bishops, such Ministers feasts and entertainments be, though now grown out of use with many. --- The 3. is the Decree of Pope Innocent the first, Anno Christi 408\. Capit. 1. sect. 11. Praeterea, frequenter quidam ex fratribus nostris, curiales, vel quibuslibet publicis functionibus occupatos, clericos   Moreover certaine of our brethren strive to make Courtiers, or those who are imployed in certaine publike functions, Clergy men, from whom --- facere contendunt, quibus postea major tristitia &c. Constat enim eos in ipsis munijs etiam voluptates exhibere, quas a diabolo inventas este non est dubiu; et ludoru vel muneru apparatibus aut praeesse, aut interesse. &c.   greater sorrow ariseth afterwards. For it appeares that in their very offices themselves they exhibit pleasures, which without doubt were invented by the Divell, and are either chiefe overseers or spectators of Playes and publike spectacles. Stage-playes therefore by this Popes verdict (for of them he speakes) are the very inventions of the Divell. The 4. is the Decretall of Pope Sextus , where we reade as followeth. Clerici qui non modicum dignitari clericalis ordinis detrahunt, et se joculatores seu Goliardos aut buffones faciunt, si per annum ignominiosam artem illam exercuerint, ipso jure, si minori tempore, et non desistunt post tertiam monitionem, carent omni privilegio clericali.   Clergy men who doe not a little detract from the dignitie of the clericall order, and make themselves jesters , Stage-players or Buffones, if they shall exercise that ignominious art for a yeares space, or for a lesser time, if they desist not after the third admonition, are ipso jure deprived of all clericall priviledge. --- The 5 is the Constitution of Pope Clement the 5. An . 1310 which as it prohibits, Clergy men and Monkes to hunt or hauke ; so it likewise decreeth: Ne moniales aut comatis aut cornutis utantur crinibus, aut choreis, ludis, aut secularibus intersint festis.   That Nonnes shall not use broydered or horned haire, nor yet be present at dances, Playes, or secular feasts. --- The 6. is the Synodall Decrees of Odo Parisiensis , about the yeare of our Lord 1200. which ordaine: Ne sacerdotes in   It is wholly prohibited Clergie ------ suis domibus habeant scachos, et aleas, omnino prohibetur.   It is wholly prohibited Clergiemen, that they keepe no checker-men, or tables, and dice in their houses. Prohibetur penitus universis sacerdotibus ludere eu decijs, et interesse spectaculis, vel choreis assistere, et intrare tabernas, causa potandi, aut discurrere per vicos aut plateas, et ne habeant vestes inordinatas onino prohibetur   All Clergy men are utterly prohibited to play at dice, to bee present at Stage-playes, or stand by dancers or to enter into tavernes, to drinke, or to runne through villages or streetes, or to weare disorderly apparell. The 7. is the Constitution of Pope Pius the 5. Anno Dom . 1566. which runnes thus. Vt Clerici quos propter Christum spectaculu fieri coportest mundo, Angelis, et hominibus, maxime debeant, ab ijs spectaculis, quae Christum non sapiunt, abstinere; et ne comaedias, fabulas, choreas, hastiludia, aut ludiorum, et profanum ullum spectaculi genus agant vel spectent. Ne talis, tesseris, pagellis pictis, et omnino alea, aut ullo praeterea vetito aut indecoro ludi genere ludant, neve hujusmodi ludi spectatores sint. Ne comessationibus aut minus honestis convivijs intersint, cauponasuqe aut tabernas ne ingrediantur, nisi longioris itineris causa nAPPEND e cuiquam   That Clergy men who ought to bee made a spectacle to the world, to Angels and to men for Christ ought chiefly to abstaine from those spectacles, which savour not of Christ; neither may they act or behold Comedies, Playes, dances, Iusts, or any prophane sport or spectacle. Let them not play at tables, dice, cards, or any game at dices (which games even Mahomet him selfe hath condemned and prohibited his followers in his Alcoran, as the greatest sinnes, and the Divells engine, to breed discords among men, and to withdraw them from prayer and Gods service:) nor at any other prohibited or unseemely kinde of play; neither may they bee --- quam propinent, aut provocati ad bibendum respondeant, sed sobrie et caste ex doctrina Apostoli vivant. Which Constitution was framed out of the fore- recited Decree of the Councell of Trent, of which this Pope (writes Langhecrucius, ) was a most diligent observer and practiser.    spectators of such playes or games. They may not be present at riotous or dishonest feasts, neither shall they enter into any tavernes or alehouses unles it be by reason of some long journey. Let them not drinke (or begin an health) to any one; nor yet pledge others when they are provoked to drinke but let them live soberly and chastly according to the Apostles doctrine. And is it not then a shame for Protestant Ministers to frequent, to use these Playes, these games and sports, or to practise these abuses, which Popes, and Papists thus condemne, at leastwise by their publike Decrees, though they still approve them by their practise? To these Canonicall, I shall here annexe these Imperiall Constitutions following; which inhibit all Clergy men under severe penalties, yea and other Christians too, from dancing, dicing, acting or beholding Stage-playes, and such like Spectacles as these. The first is the Decree of Iustinian himselfe, directed to Epiphanius the patriarke, in these words. Vehementer credimus quod Sacerdotu puritas et decus, et ad Dominu Deu et Salvatore nostrum Iesum Christum fervor, et ab ipsis missae perpetuae praeces, multam propitiatione nostrae reipub: et incrementu praebent, per quas datur nobis et barbaros subjugare, et dominum fieri eorum   We verily beleeve that the puritie and honour of Ministers, and their zeale to our Lord God and Saviour Iesus Christ, and their perpetuall prayers, afford much reconciliation and increase to our Republike; by which there is power given to us, both to subdue the barbarians, and to be made Lord of those things which before we have not obtained , --- quae antea non obtinuimus; et quanto plus rebus illorum accedit honestatis et decoris, tanto magis et nostram remp. augeri credimus, Si enim hi praetulerint vitam honestam et undique irreprehensibilem, et reliquum populum instruerint, ut is ad honestatem illorum respiciens multis peccatis abstineat, plane est, quod inde et animae omnibus meliores erunt, et facile nobis tribuetur a maximo Deo et Salvatore nostro Iesu Christo clementia conveniens. Haec igitur nobis speculantibus, nunciatum est, praeter communem rerum fide quosdam ex reverendissimis diaconis itemq; presbyteris, (nam eo amplius dicere erubescimus. Deo amantissimos nempe Episcopos,) quosdam, inquam, ex his non vereri, alios quidem per se, aleas seu tesseras contrectare, et adeo pudicum, Atqve Etiam Idiotis A Nobis Freqventer Interdictvm Spectacvlvm participare: alios ver o talem ludum non accusare,    and by how much the more honesty and comelinesse accrues to their affaires, we beleeve that our commonweale shall bee so much the more increased. For if these shall live an honest, and every way unblameable life, and shall instruct the residue of the people, that they beholding their honesty may abstaine from many sinnes, it is manifest, that fro thence; even all mens soules will be the better, and convenient mercy shall be easily granted to us by our great God and Saviour Iesus Christ. We therfore contemplating these things, it is tolde us, beyond the common truth of things, that certaine of the most reverend Deacons and Presbyters, (for wee are more ashamed to say, that even Bishops who are best beloved of God,) I say, that some of these, are not afraid, some of them by themselves, to play at tables or dice, and to participate of so shamefull a others verily blame not this play, but either communicate sed vel communicare facientibus, aut sedere spectatores actus indecori, et spectare quidem cum aviditate omnimoda, res omnium rerum importunissimas, sermones vero audire blasphemos, quos in talibus necesse est fieri, polluere etiam suas manus, et oculos, et aures Sic Damnatis Et Prohibitis Lvdis ; alios vero neque obscur e et latenter, aut equorum certaminibus se immiscere, aut etiam invitare aliquos super equoru profligatione aut victoria, vel per seipsos vel per alios quosdam. Et quia no deceter talia ludat, aut in theatris certantium ferarum pugnae fiunt, quemadmodum ipsi vel his qui modo et recens initiati sunt et adorandis mysterijs dignati ipsi praedicant, ut Abr[illeg.]nvncient Adversarii D aemonis Cvilvi, Et Omnibvs Pompis Eivs, Qvarvm Non Minima Pars Talia Spectacvla   with those who use it, or sit spectators of this unseemely act, beholding even with all greedinesse the most inconvenient foolish thing of any, and hearing blasphemous speeches which must necessarily be uttered in such sports , polluting even their hands, their eyes & eares with such Condemned And Prohibited Playes : that others truly, not obscurely and covertly, intermingle themselves in Cirque-playes and horse-races, or else bett with others upon the discomfiting and victorie of horses, either by themselves or some others. And because they cannot conveniently use such Playes, they become Spectators Of Stage-playes and Enterludes, or of those combates of wilde beasts that are made in theaters; albeit they theselves doe preach even to those that are even now but newly admitted to and made partakers of the sacred mysteries, that they should Renovnce The Worship Of The Divel Their Adversary, And All His Pompes, Of Which Svch Spectacles Or his factam nobis relatione in necessitatem incidimus ad praesentem veniendi legem tum propter nostrum super religione studium, tum etiam propter sacerdotij ipsius simul et communis reipub: utilitatem. Et sancimus, neminem neque diaconum, neque presbyterum, et multo magis neque Episcopum, (quod quidem et incredibile forte videri possit,) ut quoru in ordinationibus praeces ad Dominum mittuntur Christum Deum nostrum, et invocatio sancti et adorandi sit Spiritus, et eorum capitibus aut manibus imponuntur sanctissima eorum quae apud nos sunt mysteriorum, u[illeg.] scilicet ipsis omnia sensoria instrumenta pura fiant et consecrentur Deo. Neminem igitur horum audere de caetero et post divinam nostram legem aut cubicare, (id est tesseris seu aleis ludere,) quocunque aleae genere aut ludo, aut ita ludentibus communicare aut conversari, aut recreari, aut    Stageplayes Are Not The least Part . Truly we have ofttimes proclaimed that such things should bee observed by them: but seeing there is a relation of these things made unto us, we are fallen into a necessity of comming to the present law, both in respect of our care for religion, as also for the publike benefit of the ministry it self, and of the Republike. And we decree, that no Deacon nor Presbyter, and much more no Bishop, (which truly may chance to seeme incredible,) as in whose ordinations praiers are sent up to our Lord God Iesus Christ, and the holy and adored Spirit is invocated, and the most holy mysteries that are among us are imposed on their heads or hads, that so al their sensitive instruments may be made pure and consecrated unto God. Let none of them therefore hereafter presume after our divine law, either to play at tables or dice, or at any kinde of dice-play, or game, or to communicate or converse, or to be recreated with those who play thus, or to play together with them, or to beare witnesse to unacum ijs agere, aut eis testimoniu perhibere, aut interesse Plebeiis Hvivsmodi Spectacvlis qu ae prius diximus, aut quid eorum quae in his prohibetur facere, sed Omni Ad Illa Participio In Postervm Abstinere &c. Si vero quis de caetero tale quid faciens deprehensus fuerit &c. et convictus fuerit diaconus et presbyter vel aleator esse, vel aleatorum particeps, aut talibus assidens vanitatibus, vel praedictis interesse spectaculis; aut etia forte aliquis Deo amabilium Episcoporum (quod quide neque eventurum esse confidimus,) prorsus tales cujusda participes esse spectaculi, aut cum aleatoribus una sedere, et disponere, aut pacisci, aut sponsiones facere, de caetero ausus fuerit eum a sacra seperari liturgia jubemus, ac imponi ipsi canonica poenam, et definiri tempus infra quod conveniat metrapolitanu suu jejunijs et supplicationibus utentem magnum propitiari Deum super tali transgressione:et si per definitu    them, or to be present at such to doe any of those things that are here prohibited, but to Abstaine Hereafter From All Participation With Them . And if any one shall henceforth bee deprehended doing any such thing, and if any Deacon or Presbyter shal bee convicted to bee either a dicer, or a partner with dicers, or one that sitteth by such vanities, or to be present at the foresaid Enterludes: or if perchance any one of the Bishops beloved of God (which truly we trust will never happen,) shall henceforth presume to be a partaker of any spectacle or play, or to sit together with dicers, and to direct, or bargaine, or bett, wee command him to be sequestred from the sacred liturgie, and canonicall punishment to be inflicted on him, and a convenient time to bee appointed within which hee may resort to his Metropolitan with fasting and supplications, to appease the great God for this his offence: and if during the appointed tempus maneat lachrymis et poenitentia et jejunio et ad Dominum Deum oratione, remissionem delicti exorans, confestim ei cui subjectum est hoc diligenter cognito, et sollicite requisito, commune quidem pro ipso orationem fieri curabit, et cum omni diligentia injunget ipsi ut postea a tali sacerdotij dedecoratione abstineat; et si putaverit ipsum sufficienter ad poenitentiam venisse, tum sacerdotali eum restituer dignetur clementiae. Si vero et post excommunicatione inventus fuerit, neq; vera poenitentia usus et alias etiam aspernatus eam rem et manifeste ab adversario (diabolo) mente inescatus, ipsum quidem sacerdos sub quo degit, sacris eximat catalogis, omnino eum deponens: ille autem non amplius ullo modo licentiam habeat ad sacerdotalem venire agradum &c.   time he shall continue imploring the remission of his fault with teares, repentance, and fasting, and prayer to his God, this being speedily made knowne to who he is subject, and diligently examined by him, hee shall provide a common prayer to be made for him, and with all diligence shall enjoyne him, that he shall afterwards abstaine from such a disgrace of the ministry; and if he shall thinke that hee hath sufficiently repented, let him vouchsafe to restore him to his ministeriall function. But if even after his excommunication he shall be found not to have truly repented, and contemptuously to returne to the same thing againe being manifestly seduced in his mind by the Divell; let the Bishop or Minister under whom he lives strike him out of the sacred catalogues, and altogether depose him & let him by no means obtaine any future licence to come into the Ministerial order. Which constitution shewes how execrable a thing it is, for Clergy men especially, to resort to Stageplayes. To this worthy Constitution or Law of his, I shall annexe two others, worthy our observation. Virnullo modo uxorem   A man may by no meanes ------ orem expellat, nisi adulteram &c. nisi circensibus vel theatralibus ludis, vel arenarum spectaculis, in ipsis locis in quibus haec adsolent celebrari, se prohibente gaudentem.   put away his wife, unlesse she be an adulteresse, &c. or unles she resort to Cirque-playes, or Stage-plaies, or Sword-plaies, in those very places where they are wont to be celebrated, contrary to his command. Vir dimittere uxorem potest, si praeter voluntatem suam circenses et theatricas voluptates captet, ubi scenici ludi sunt, aut ubi ferae cum hominibus pugnant.   A man may put away his wife, if without his leave shee runne to Cirque-playes, and theatrical Enterludes, to play-houses, (or places where are Stage-plaies,) or where beasts fight with men. Which lawes of his, authorizing men to put away their wives, (as Sempronius Sophus did,) if they resort to Playes, to Play-houses, or other spectacles without their licence . ( because it is an apparant evidence of their lewdnesse, and a meanes to make them common prostituted whores, few else resorting unto Playes but such ;) is an impregnable evidence of the lewdnesse, the unlawfulnesse, the infamy of acting and frequenting Stage- playes, and of the intollerable mischievous qualities of Plaies themselves which thus strangely vitiate their Spectators: and withall should cause all husbands, all parents, to keep their wives and daughters from Playes and Theaters, (the very marts, the instructions of baudery and adultery ), if they would preserve them chast; to which Adulterers, Woers and others oft entice them, that so they may more easily overcome their chastity, and make them pliable to their lusts,. which they are alwayes sure to accomplish, if they can once but draw them to resort to Playes ; as ancient, that I say not moderne experience, can too well witnesse. The second, are the imperial Constitutions of Honorius and Theodousius , which runne thus. Placuit nostrae clementiae   It pleaseth our grace that ------ ut nihil conjuncti Clerici cum publicis actionibus vel ad Curiam pertinentibus habeant. Praeterea ijs qui Parabolani vocantur, neque ad quodlibet publicum spectaculu neque ad Curiae locum, neque ad judicium accedendi licentiam permittimus &c. Interdicimus sanctissimis Episcopis et presbyteris, diaconis et subdiaconis, et lectoribus, et omnibus alijs cujuslibet ordinis venerabilis collegij aut schematis constitutis, ad tabulas ludere aut alijs ludentibus participes esse, aut inspectores fieri, aur ad quodlibet spectaculu spectandi gratia venire Si quis aute ex his in hoc deliquerit, jubemus hunc tribus annis a venerabili ministerio prohiberi, et in monasteriu redigi: sed in medio tempore si se poenitente ostenderit, liceat sacerdoti sub quo constitutus est tempus minuere, et hunc priori rursus ministerio reddere.   Clergy men intermeddle not with publike actions or things belonging to the Court. Besides, wee permit not those who are called . Parabolani, to have leave to come to any publike Spectacle or Stageplay, nor yet to the Court, or place of judgement. Wee prohibit the most sacred Bishops, and Presbyters, Deacons and Subdeacons, and all others of the venerable colledge, or livery, to play at tables, or to bee partners with others that play, or spectators of them, or to come to any spectacle or stageplay of purpose to behold it. If any of these shall offend in this, we command him to be suspended the venerable ministrie for three yeares, and to be thrust into a Monastery: But if in the middle of this time hee shall shew himselfe penitent, it shal be lawfull for the Minister under whom hee is placed to shorten the time, & to restore him to his former ministery. To which I may adde these ensuing Imperiall Constitutions of Gratianus, Valentinianus, and Theodosius. Nullus solis die populo spectaculum praebeat,   Let no man exhibit any Stage-play or Spectacle to --- nec divinam venerationem confecta solennitate confundat.   the people on the Sunday, nor confound Gods worship with any acted Enterlude. Dominico quae est septimanae totius primus dies et natale, atque Epiphaniorum Christi, Paschae etiam atque quinquagesimae diebus omni Theatrorum atque Circensium voluptate per universas urbes earundem populis denegata, totae Christianorum ac fidelium mentes Dei cultibus occupantur. Si qui etiam nunc vel Iudaei impietatis amentia, vel stolidae paganitatis errore atque insania detinentur aliud esse supplicationum noverint tempus, aliud voluptatis. Acne quis existimet in honorem numinis nostri veluti majori quadam imperialis officij necessitate compelli; et nisi divina religione contempta spectaculis opera daret, subeundum forsitan sibi nostrae serennitatis offensam, si minus circa nos devotionis ostenderit qua solebat, nemo ambigat, quod tunc maxime mansuetudmi nostrae ab humano genere defertur, cum virtutibus Dei omnipopotentis   On the Lords day which is the first day and birth-day of the whole week, and on the feast-dayes of the Epiphany of Christ, of Easter also and of Whitsontide, all the pleasure of Stage-playes and Cirque-playes, being denied the people throughout all their Citties, the whole minds of Christians & beleevers shalbe busied in the worship of God. And if any now are deceived either with the folly of Iewish impiety or with the errour and frenzie of foolish paganisme, let them know, that there is one time of supplications, another of pleasures. And lest any one should thinke himselfe as it were compelled out of honour to our Majesty with a certaine greater necessitie of imperiall duty, and that perchance he shall undergoe the displeasure of our grace, unlesse contemning divine religion, he shall addict himselfe to Stage-playes, or if hee shall shew lesse devotion towards us in this kinde than hee was wont: let no man doubt, that then most of all meritis universis obsequium orbis impenditur.   is attributed to our clemencie by mankind, when as the obedience and service of the world is bestowed on the vertues and universall merits of the omnipotent God. The last is that of Iulian the Apostata , who in his Letter to Arsacius , the Arch-Pagan Priest of Galatia , writes thus by way of injunction, of purpose to draw the Pagans to the discipline of the Christians. Deinde sacerdotem quemq; cohortare, ne in theatro conspiciatur; ne apud caupones potet; neve arti cuiquam aut operae pudendae aut ignominiosae praesit. Et morem quidem gerentes persequere, rebelles vero a te repelle. Moreover exhort every Priest that hee be not seene in the theatre; that he drinke not at ale-houses; and that hee practise or survey no ignominious, no shameful art or worke. And honour those who are obedient, but repell the rebellious from thee. --- So much shew of ingenuity was there even in this grand Apostate, as to doome Stage-playes unfit Spectacles, Playhouses & Alehouses undecent places for Pagan Priests, how much more then for Christian Ministers.

With sundry other Canonists and Casuists in their Treatises, De Ecclesiasticis Officijs, & De Vita & Honestate Clericorum : who all unanimously conclude, (as the forequoted Councels and Constitutions doe;) That it is utterly unlawfull for any Clergy men whatsoever, (who should be patternes of piety, temperance and humility to others:) not onely to hunt, to hauke, to drinke or pledge any healthes; to make any riotous feasts, to weare any velvets, silkes, or costly apparell, to intermeddle with secular affaires &c. to dance, to play at dice or tables, or at any unlawfull games, or to looke upon any others who are dancing or playing: but likewise to be actors, hearers, or spectators of any Enterludes, Stage-playes, or other such Spectacles whatsoever either in publike or private ; for the premised reasons.

Wherefore I shall here close up this Scene (and I hope the mouthes of all Play-patrons whatsoever) with this 48. Play-confounding Argument, uncapable (I suppose) of any answer. That which 55 severall Oecumenicall, Nationall, Provinciall Synodes and Councels in severall successive ages of the Church: together with sundry Apostolicall, Canonicall, and Imperiall Constitutions, have severely inhibited, suppressed, anathematized, condemned under paine of excommunication, and the like; must undoubtedly be execrable, unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians, unsufferable in any Christian Church or State. But 55 severall Oecumenicall, Nationall, and Provinciall Synodes and Councels, in severall successive ages of the Church; together with sundry Apostolicall, Canonicall and Imperiall, Constitutions , have severely inhibited, suppressed, anathematized, condemned Stageplayes, together with their Actors and Spectators, under paine of excommunication, and the like: as all the premises witnesse. Therefore they must undoubtedly be execrable, unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians, unsufferable in any Christian Church and State. The premises no Christian can or dares controll, against so many apparant evidences: the Conclusion therefore must stand inviolable, maugre all that Players or Play-haunters can object against it. The fourth Squadron of Authorities, is the venerable troope of 70 severall renowned ancient Fathers and Writers of the Church, from our Saviours time till the yeare 1200, who have professedly encountred, censured, condemned Stage-playes, in their incomparably excellent writings, a Catalogue of whose names and workes. I shall here present you withall, together with a note of those impressions which I follow; omitting the recitall of their words at large; partly to avoid prolixity; partly, because I have already recorded their most eminent passages against Stage-playes and Players in severall precedent Acts and Scenes , on which you may cast your eyes. To begin with these ancient Fathers and Authours according to their severall Antiquities, which I would wish the learned to peruse, for their owne better satisfaction in this point. The of them, is Philo Iud aeus , an eminent learned Iew, if not a Christian, whom St. Hierom highly applaudes, inserting him into his Catalogue of Ecclesiasticall Writers.

Thirdly, it is evident by the unavoidable suffrage of Gregory Nazianzen , the Countrey-man , if not the co aetanian of this Arrian George : who in his Oratio 31. in laudem Athanasij , writes thus. ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohacgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ,  &c. which not only Bilias , but Ioannes Lewenclavius too, (who well understood the signification of the word ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  ) Latine thus. Monstrosus quida Cappadox ex ultimis terra nostr ae finibus oriundus, malus genere, animo pejor, &c , Which words, monstrosus quida [illeg.]appadox, ex ultimis terra nostr ae finibus oriundus : ( Grogory Nazianzen being a Cappadocian borne ;) coupled with this foregoing passage: Atque hic mihi charissimum solum, patriam, inquam, meam omni crimine solutam velim; Non enim patri ae, sed ijs qui libera animi voluntate eum (viz. George the Arrian) elegerint improbitas assignanda est. Illa enim sacra, et apud omnes pietatis laude clara et illustris; at hi Ecclesia parente indigna. Porro in vinea quoque spinam nasci audistis, &c . (Wherein he excuseth his native Country, Cappadocia, from all blame; that George the Arrian was borne  & made a Bishop in it; since thornes may grow in vineyards, and those who chose him for their Bishop, not his native Countrey were to blame:) and seconded with this ensuing gradation; malus genere , (which referres to his parentage, hee being a Cappadocian borne, whose wickednesse and lewdnesse, as is confessed, grew into a proverbe:) animo pejor , which relates to his conditions: are an unanswerable evidence, that George the Arrian was a Cappadocian borne. Hence Billius in his Scholia upon this Oration, long before Dr. Rainolds wrote any thing of this subject , concludes peremptorily; That George the Arrian was a Cappadocian borne; Cappadox enim erat (saith hee) Georgius Arrianus infestissimus Athanasij hostis. Quatenus autem Cappadox erat, inquit Theologus, videam mihi, et p aetriam communem cum eo habere, nonnihil etiam ad insidias adversus Athanasium structas conferre . Hence Flaccus Illyricus, Iohannes Wigandus, Matth aeus Iudex, and Basilius Faber , in their Famous Magdeburgian Ecclesiasticall Centuries , ( 36 yeares before Dr. Rainolds ,) relating the life and death of George the Arrian , expresly affirme from this of Nazianzen, That George the Arrian was a Cappadocian borne . For thus they write: Georgius natione Cappadox, ex sordido et vili vit ae genere, ad Episcopatum, seu tyrannidem potius, Alexandriam pervenit . Yea both Baronius and Spondanus from this passage of Nazianzen , and those of Athanasius , affirme; That this Arrian George was a Cappadocian borne, and the Countrey-man of Nazianzen : For writing of Gregory , and this Arrian George: Concordant vero (say they) omnino patria, cum utrumque fuisse Cappadocem veteres scriptores tradant , quoting Nazianzen and Athanasius in the margent. Whence they stile this George, Georgius Cappadox, quem quidem malum genere, animo pejorem, moribus pessimum fuisse, Gregorius Nazianzenus ipsius Gentilis docet, dum ejus scelera recenset . If then we beleeve either the forenamed Historians, or Athanasius, Nazianzen, Billius , the Century-writers, Baronius or Spondanus , who are most expresse in point, this George the Arrian was undoubtedly a native Cappadocion . Lastly, that passage of Cassiodorus in his Tripartita Historia , where he stiles this George, Capp aedocem hominem Arianae vesaniae : that more punctuall testimony of. Nicephorus Constantinopolitanus , who reckoning up the names of the Bishops of Alexandria, whereof he makes this George the 22\. stiles him, Georgius Cappadox : by which title hee distinguisheth him, not onely from. George the Arrian Bishop of Laodicea , but from, George the 50 Bishop of Alexandria , who succeeded him: perchance the same George whom Photius, mentions , as the authour of a booke concerning Chrysostome : together with. Nannius , Billius , the Centuriators , Baronius, Spondanus , Nicolaus Faber , and the severall Index-compilers of Athanasius, Nazianzen, Nicephorus, Zozomen, Socrates Scholasticus, the Centuries, Baronius, Spondanus, Bibliotheca Patrum , and others, who all stile him, Georgius Cappadox , as being a Cappadocian borne; yeeld us an infallible testimonie in Dr. Reinolds his behalfe : that George the Arrian Bishop ( a thing not questioned heretofore by any,) was by birth a Cappadocian . Neither will those two objections to the contrary, so much as once eclipse this shining truth: To wit, that Homo , or Monstrum Cappadox , is a proverbiall speech, denoting, not the Country, but the lewd conditions of this Arrian George, and that Ammianus Marcellinus, who lived about those times, affirmes for certaine in expresse termes, that George of Alexandria was borne at Epiphania in the Province of Cilicia . For first, though Homo Cappadox be sometimes a proverbiall speech, being applied to a notorious wicked wretch, who is no Cappadocian borne, (where it must of necessity be proverbial, because it cannot be litterall); yet it is never so, when as it is spoken of any native Cappadocian, where it may have a proper litterall construction: which is the case of George the Arrian , whom all Writers hitherto, till one of late, haue conceived to be a Cappadocian borne. But admit, that Homo , or Monstrum Cappadox , were a meere Adagie or a periphrasis of a desperate gracelesse wicked miscreant; (which is unlikely in our case, since Nazianzen ,  & Isiodor pelusiota informe us; that about this George his time the ancient infamie of the Cappadocians lewdnesse was quite abolished, Cappadocia being then become not onely sacred, but even famous and illustrious both for piety, learning, education of youth and learned pious men, who were as so many lights of holy life and doctrine unto all the world :) Yet no one testimony can be produced by the objector, to prove, that Georgius Cappadox . or Cappadox coupled with any other proper name, is used onely proverbially, for a man of wicked, lewd or vile conditions; not for a Cappadocian borne. For as Anglicus, Scotus, Brito, Iudaus , and such like nationall stiles, annexed to their proper names, (as Thomas Anglicus, Ioannes Duns Scotus, Herveus Brito, Philo Iud aeus, &c .) denominate onely the native Countrey, not the morall conditions, vertues or vices of men: So Cappadox , united to Georgius , or any other proper name, demonstrates onely the native soile, not the notorious wickednesse of the person: else Philagrius , whom Nazianzen stiles, Philagrius Cappadox clarus et illustris ; (which were an apparant contradiction if Cappadox were nothing but a lewd companion;) else all the pious Cappadocian Bishops in the first Nicene Councels , who are stiled Cappadoces ; else Eustochius Cappadox , as I finde him named; else St. Basil , and famous Gregory Nazianzen , who are called Cappadoces , Basilius Cappadox , and Gregorius Cappedox : yea and Georgius Cappadox , the Sainted Martyr too, (whom some make the same with George the Arrian ; others , and among them Opmeerus , Hyperius , Georgius Stagelius , and Ioannes Æmilius , Mr. Samuel Purchas , Mr. George Withers , and famous Philip Melanethon too, what ever some aver against it, as his words I have quoted in the margent witnes:) A meere symbolical or allegoricall fiction ; either of pious Magistrates, the Princes of Gods husbandry, who fight against the Dragon, rescuing the Virgin the Church from his assaults, or defending and maintaining discipline and justice, against all tyrants and oppressours : or, of our Lord and Saviour Christ, the true ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  of his Church, who hath long since bruised the head , wounded the body, and vanquished the power of the great Serpent the Divell, (whom the Scripture stiles the Dragon ,) and trampled him under his feete. like a victorious conquerour; rescuing the Woman, his beloved Church , (whom he stiles his Margarita , his Iewell) from his infernall power , as the Scriptures plainly teach us; all which the emblematicall picture of S. George doth lively represent:) must all be now unsaincted, and stigmatized for nought else, but desperate notorious castawayes, as this their proverbiall appellation of Cappadox proclaimes them, if the objection prove once true; since this title ( Cappadox ) is appropiated to them all, yea even to George the Saint , as well as to George the Arrian ; he being principally knowne and conceived to be a Cappadocian borne , by this addition, Cappadox : which if it be meerely nationall in George the Martyr , and others fore-recited, must necessarily be so in George the Arrian ; there being no reason to make it proverbiall in the one, and literall or nationall onely in the other. Secondly, for the objected authority of Ammianus Marcellinus which is misquoted in the chapter: I answer, first, that he was onely an heathen Writer, and not so well acquainted either with the birth or life of George the Arrian, as Athanasius his competitor, as Nazianzen his Countrey man, and the forequoted Ecclesiasticall historians were; who all affirme him to be a Cappadocian borne : his single testimony then ought not to be preferred before all theirs; no more than the testimony of Frier Anselme or Sir Walter Raleigh, who record, that George the Martyr, was borne in Syria (not in Cappadocia,) in St. George his castle five miles from Ptolemais , is to be credited before theirs, who affirme him born in Cappadocia. Secondly, his witnes is not certaine, but dubious, grounded onely upon a flying report of others, not upon his owne knowledge. it is but, In Fullonio, in Fullio , or infulio (no man knowes which) natus Vt Ferebatvr , apud Epiphaniam Cilici ae oppidum : And shall we beleeve a Ferebatvr , a meere uncertaine rumour, taken up by an Heathen, before the expresse Authorities of sundry eminent Christians. Thirdly, admit the most that may be, that this George was borne in Cilia ; yet it no more followes from thence, that George the Arrian was not a Cappadocian borne; than that one borne in St. George his Parish in Burford in the County of Glocester , is no English-man borne. For as Glocester-shire is a County of England, and so hee that is borne in it, may be truly called an English-man borne; so this Cilicia in which George the Arrian was reported to be borne, was, for ought it appeares, a Pr aefecture or Province of Cappadocia ; and therefore though he had there his birth, yet we may truly stile him a Cappadocian borne. That this Cilicia was but a Province of Cappadocia, it is somewhat probable by the testimony of Strabo , no infamous Cappadocian: of Æ nea Sylvius , and Volateranus , who informe us: That Cappadocia was divided by the Persians into two Kingdomes, viz: Cappadocia Major, towards Taurus, which they properly stiled Cappadocia; and Pontus, which some have called Cappadocia too: and That this Cappadocia Major under King Archelaus and his predecessors, was parted into 10 Pr aefectures, 5 of them scituated towards the hill Taurus; to wit, Pr aetura Melitina, Cataonia , Cilicia , (which Æ neas Sylvius stiles. Cilicia Strategia) Tyanensis & Isauriensis; the other 5 intituled, Lavinasena, Sargasena, Sarauna, Chamanena, and Rhimnena: to which the Romans added an eleventh Praefecture out of Cilicia, namely the region of Castabalis and Cydrista unto Derba, the seate of Antipater the pirate, the eleventh Praefecture before Archelaus, who annexed likewise Cilicia Tracheae, and the whole country that practised piracie unto Cappadocia . If then Cilicia were but a Province of Cappadocia, and an eleventh Province out of Cilicia, together with Cilicia Trachea were added unto Cappadocia by the Romans and Archelaus: we may as safely conclude, that George the Arrian was a Cappadocian, though borne in Cilicia, a part or Province of Cappadocia, as that St. George his Advocate is an English-man, though born Glocestershire. But admit Cilicia, where this George was borne, were no part of Cappadocia, because it may be objected, that Epiphania was scituated in the Province of Cilicia , and not in this Cilicia : to which I must reply out of Volateran, Geogr: l: 11. f: 110 , that there were three Citties of that name, and one of them perchance in this Cilicia; yet the Country of Cilicia it selfe (admitting he had his nativity there,) borders on the south of Cappadocia . As therefore some affirme,. that St. George may without any contradiction be said to have both Lydda and Rama for the Stage of his suffering, because they are both conterminous and adjacent , by which devise they have endeavoured to reconcile some jarring Authours : So by the selfesame reason, George the Arrian might be reported, to be borne in Cilicia, as Ammianus writes, though in truth he were borne in Cappadocia, as the precedent Authours witnesse; by reason of the neere vicinity of these two Countries. All which being laid together, will sufficiently justifie the true, though late oppugned position of our deceased famous Dr.Reinolds , (whose Overthrow of Stage-playes , hath thus occasioned me even here to quit his credit in this case of George the Arrian, which might else be questioned in the case of Stage-playes:) That George the Arrian was a Cappadocian borne , as was the Mother of St. Basil : to whose Play-condemning passages I now proceed: as namely his Hexameron Hom : 4.

These 71 eminent ancient Fathers and Writers in these their recited works, to which I might adde Iustinian that famous Christian Emperour, in his forequoted lawes and workes, have constantly even from our Saviours death till the yeare 1200. abundantly oppugned, censured and condemned, not onely Sword- playes, Cirque-playes, and Amphitheatricall bloudy Spectacles ; but even Stage-playes themselves, as diabolicall, heathenish, sinfull, lewd, ungodly Spectacles , not sufferable among Christians ; condemning withall, not onely the acting, but even the beholding of such lascivious, filthy and contagious Enterludes, the seminaries of all those prodigious execrable wicked effects , which I have more fully anatomized in the precedent Acts . And if all these worthy ancient Fathers did thus abominate, oppugne the Stage-playes, Actors and Play-haunters of their times;  o how would they censure and abhorre the scurrilous, obscene, blasphemous, impious Playes and Players of our age, which are farre more execrable, prophane and lewd than the very worst in former dayes ? From these authorities therefore thus recited, I shall frame this 49 invincible Argument against Stageplayes. That which 71 severall Fathers and eminent ancient Writers of the Church have constantly, professedly condemned, as sinfull, and abominable in these their recited workes ; must certainly be desperately sinfull, unseemely unlawfull unto Christians, intollerable in any Christian Commonweale. But these 71 severall Fathers and eminent ancient Writers of the Church, have thus constantly, professedly condemned Stage-playes and Stage-Players, in these their recited workes. Therefore they must certainly be desperately sinfull , unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians, intollerable in any Christian Commonweale. The Minor is evident by the premises: the Major I dare challenge the most impudent Player, or Play-patron to denie. For what man, what Christian is there so peremptorily audacious, so unchristianly immodest, so erroniously schismaticall , as to controll, and quite reject, the unanimous resolutions of so many reverend, pious, incomparably learned Fathers ? whose Play- condemning censure, seconded by the definitive sentence of the whole primitive Church both under the Law and Gospell; not onely challenge our reverend respect , but our subscription too . We are all exceeding ready in matters of faith, to give credit to Councels, to the renowned Fathers, and ancient Writers, especially where all, or many of them concurre: and shall we then reject and undervalue them here in the case of Stage-playes, in which they all accord, without the least dissent? Never (I dare positively affirme it) did Fathers, Councels, and Writers of all sorts, all ages, more plentifully more unanimously accord in passing sentence against, any abuse or wickednesse whatsoever, then in censuring, in condemning, Stage-playes, as the precedent and subsequent Scenes will evidence: and shall we then desert them where they all concord? Could Playes, Play-haunters or lewd lascivious persons, finde out but one councell, one Father or two, to countenance Stage-playes, dancing, dicing, Health-quaffing, face-painting, Love-lockes, or their strange fantastique habits and disguises; they would so hugge it, so adore it, that neither the lawes of God or man, the authorities of Christ, his Prophets and Apostles, the concurring resolutions of all other Fathers, Councels or Writers to the contrary should be able to convince them that these things are evill : so pertinaciously doe men adhere not onely to their opinions, but their errors too, who justifie or foment their vices in the least degree . And shall not then the uncontrolled authority of all the precedent Christian Councels and Fathers, be much more prevalent to withdraw them from pernicious Stage-playes, with other oft condemned vanities, which have not so much as one Father, one Councell to defend them? shall men beleeve, (yea sometimes preferre) the Fathers before the Scriptures, where they seeme to give any countenace to their errours or superstitions; and yet reflect them, where they all unanimously condemne their sinfull pleasure? O let us not so farre undervalue these their pious, judicious, unanimous resolutions against Stageplayes and Actors, as still to magnifie, frequent, or patronize them in despite of all these their determinations; but let us joyne hearts, and hands and pens, and judgements, yea and, our practise with them ; passing the very selfesame doome on Players, on Stage-playes, as they all have done before us; for feare their pious resolutions prove so many unavoidable endictments of condemnation against us at the last. We all professe our selves inheritors of these Fathers faith; let us not then be ashamed to inherit the purity, piety, discipline, and devotion of their lives. It was one great part of their discipline, to censure; one badge of their Christianity, their piety, to abandon Stage- playes, Players and Play-haunters ; let it be one peece of our Ecclesiastical, if not civil discipline and devotion, to doe the like. And since we are compassed about with so great a cloud of Play-condemning Authorities, let us now at last resolve, to lay away every weight, and the sin , (these sinfull stigmatized Stage-playes which doe so easily beset us ; Let us hearken to the instruction of these pious Fathers, and attend unto their doctrine: not removing those Play-exiling Land-markes which they have set us : that so imitating them in their piety, wee may at last participate with them in their glory. sundry Christian Authours, as well Papists as Protestants, from the yeare of our Lord 1200, to this present time, a Catalogue of whose names and workes, I shall here present unto you, according to their severall antiquities, together with the Impressions which I follow.

These 150 moderne Christian famous Writers, I say, with sundry others who I pretermit; have in their recited works, by a constant uninterrupted succession from the yeare of our Lord 1200, to this present, unanimously oppugned and condemned Stage-playes, (together with all mixt effeminate, lascivious, amorous Dancing, the epedemicall corruption of our present age,) as most pernicious, execrable, lewd, unchristian, heathenish Spestacles, not sufferable in any Christian Church or State; branding all , Stage-players for gracelesse, lewd infamous miscreants, who ought to be excommunicated ipso facto both from the Church, the Sacraments, and all Christian society, till they have wholly renounced their diabolicall vile profession, and given publike testimony to the world, both of their reformation and sincere repentance . And as all these recited Writers, even so our owne Magistrates, our Vniversities, and all our faithfull Ministers, both in their publike Sermons, and private discourses, together with all godly zealous Christians from age to age, have passed the very selfesame doome and verdict against Playes and Players , as I have elswhere largely proved, and our owne experience can sufficiently testifie. If then all these Protestant and Popish Authours, Magistrates, Ministers and godly Christians, both at home and abroad, have successively from age to age, from yeare to yeare, thus publikely, thus professedly condemned Stage-playes, both by their words and writings, as most pernicious evills; and that not coldly or slightly, but with the very height of zeale and earnestnesse; I dare any Christian now be so perversely obstinate, so singularly wilfull, so desperately audacious, as still to magnifie; frequent, or patronize them? Never, I dare confidently averre, was any one thing whatsoever (except onely some grosse notorious sinne against the expresse law of God and nature) so universally, abundantly, professedly condemned by Councels, Fathers, Christian and prophane Emperours, Princes, Magistrates, States, and Writers of all sorts, all ages, all places whatsoever, as Stage-playes, against which the Fathers of olde , and many Christians of late have written whole Treatises, Bookes and Volumes with such affection and acumen, that wee shall never finde them more sharpe and piercing, more vehement, elegant, and divinely rhetoricall, than in their Impressions against Stage-playes, wherein they farre transcend themselves. Yea such hath beene the harmonious unanimity of Writers in condemning Stage- playes, and Actors, that I never met with any Christian or Heathen Authour ( Lodge onely and Haywood , two English Players excepted) that durst publikely pleade in any printed worke for popular Playes and Actors, It is true, that these two Players Lodge & Haywood , the first of them in his Play of Playes , the latter in his Apologie for Actors , thrust out in print by stealth, perceiving Play-houses, Playes and Actors to grow into disgrace by reason of sundry pious Bookes that had beene written against them, by Mr. Northbrooke, Mr. Gosson, Mr. Stubs, Dr. Rainolds , and others forerecited; undertooke the patronage of Playes and Players (as. Demetrius and his silver-smithes did the defence of their great Diana and her silver shrines ) for their owne private ends, it being the craft by which they got their wealth and living . But their ridiculous Player-like Pleas, savouring of nought but paganisme, ignorance and folly, were no sooner published by connivance, but they were presently so soledly refuted, (the first of them, by Mr. Stephen Gosson ; a penitent Play-Poet, in his Playes confuted in 5 Actions ; the latter by I: G : in his Refutation of the Apologie for Actors London 1615. both published by authoritie:) that they durst not, yea they could not since replie unto them, there being so much against Playes and Players in all writers, all ages, so little (and that little as good as nothing) for them, that it is not onely bootelesse, but impious and absurd, for any to indeavour their defence, which. Dr. Gager , Dr. Gentiles , and Dr. Case , who writ something in behalfe of academicall Stage-playes onely, (in which argument they were likewise so utterly foyled and overthrowne by that ornament of our Church and Nation,. Dr. Rainolds , as they were glad to yeeld the wasters to him, to change their opinions ,  & set downe with losse;) durst never undertake; they all condemning popular Plaies and Plaiers, even in their Apologies for private academicall Enterludes. Let therefore the numerous concurring resolutions of all these learned eminent approved Authors, whose single opinions wee highly estimate in most other things, overballance the prejudicate, erronious, inconsiderate, private and subitane Opinions of all ignorant novices . or lascivious injudicious Players or Play-haunters whatsoever, who are so prepossessed, so besotted with the love of these most sinfull pleasures, that they are altogether unable to judge rightlie of them: And let us chuse rather to judge aright of Plaies and Plaiers, with all these worthie Sages, than to erre with novices, children, fooles, or lewd ones, who for want of grace and rectified judgements, are. unable to discerne betweene good and evill ; contracting the summe of all our present Resolues into this 50 Play-refelling Syllogisme. That which above 150 moderne Protestant and Popish Writers of all sorts, of our owne and other Nations; together with many learned godly Ministers and private Christians have professedly written, preached, declaimed against from time to time, with an unanimous consent, without any publike opposition or controll; must certainely bee execrable, unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians. Witnesse , Matthew 23. 2, 3. Luke 10. 16. 1 Corinth. 10 32, 33. Hebr. 13. 17. 2, Cor 7. 15 c. 9. 13. Ephes. 5. 21. cap. 6. 1, 2. 1 Pet. 5. 5. But above 150 moderne Protestant and Popish Writers of all sorts as well domestique as forraigne, together with many learned godly Ministers and private Christians, have professedly written, preached, declaimed against Stage-playes from time to time, (even from Anno 1200, till now;) and that with a most unanimous consent, without any publike opposition or controll: Witnesse the premises. Therefore, they must certainly be execrable, unseemely, unlawfull unto Christians. prophanesse, will be ready to censure all the fore-alledged Fathers and moderne Christistian Authours, for Puritans or Precisians , and so blow away all these their authorities at one breath; the very title of a Puritan (as of olde the name of a Christian ) being sufficient to dash, to blast them all. I shall therefore in the next place controll the madnesse of these Antipuritan Play-proctors with a squadron of such Play-condemning Pagan Philosophers, Orators, Historians and Poets, as the very Divell himselfe dares not brand for Puritans, though perchance some desperate Players or Play- haunters will, against all sence and reason, because they are better than themselves. I shall begin with Heathen Philosophers, Orators, Morralists, and then proceed to Historians and Poets, whose names and workes I shall onely quote for the most part, with those Editions which I follow; because I have recited most of their words at large, Act . 6.

The first Play-condemning Heathen Philosopher is Socrates , the very wisest Heathen, by the expresse verdict of the Delphian Oracle, (witnesse Plato his Socratis Apologia, p . 12.  & Diogenis Laertij;, Socrates: ) who condemned Comedies and Stage-playes, as pernicious, lascivious vanities; refusing to resort to Aristophanes his Comedies; & persuading the Athenians with all the Graecians to abandon Comicall Play-Poets, which they did accordingly : for which see, Plato his Socratis Apologia, p . 22.

( Neque enim oratorius, immo hercule ne virilis quidem cultus est quo plerique temporum, nostrorum, actores ita utuntur ut lascivi a verborum, et levitate sententiarum, et licentia compositionis, histrionales modo exprimant, quodque vix auditu fas esse debeat, laudis et gloriae et ingenij, loco plerique jactani, cantari saltarique commentarios suos. Vnde oritur illa faeda et praepostera, sed tamen frequens quibusdam exclamatio, ut oratores nostri temere dicere, histriones diserte saltare dicuntur, &c ). So he informes us whence this evill and the decay of eloquence & all other arts did spring; & that was from the ill education, the idlenesse of youth, and their resort to Stage-playes : which he thus notably expresseth. Quis enim, ignorat et eloquentiam, et c aeteras artes descivisse ab ista veteri gloria, non inopia hominum, sed desidia juventutis, et negligentia parentum, et inscientia praecipientium, et oblivione moris antiqui? quae mala primum in urbe nata, mox per Italiam fusa, jam in provincias manant &c. Iam primuns suus cuique filius ex casta parente natus, non in cella emptae nutricis, sed gremio ac sinu 30\. 31. are Iulius Capitolinus, Trebellius Pollio, Ælius Lampridius , and Flavius Vopiscus ; in their fore-quoted places: Act. 6. Scene 5. p. 451. in the margent; where they condemne Heliogabalus, Commodus, Verus, Carinus, the Galieni, and other Roman Emperors, for fostering Playes and Players, on whom they spent much treasure & time, whereby they corrupted their owne, and likewise the peoples mindes and manners to their eternall infamy . The 32. is Amianus Marcellinus , Hist. l. 28. c. 9, 10. London 1609. p. 340, 341, 342. Where he first declaimes against the Senators and Roman Gentry, for their play- haunting & dice-play; them against the sloath, the vanity & lewde behaviour of the commo people, who flocked thick and threefold to the base sports of the Theatre, where the Actors were sure to be hissed by them off the stage if they had not with some money bought the favour of the abject multitude; which there did nought but clamour, shout, and raise up tumults . The 34. 35. 36. are Ovid, Horase, Iuvenal , and Propertius : 4 famous Heathen Poets, who in their severall forequoted places, Act. 6. Scene 3.  & 5\. p. 369, 370, 371, 452, 453, 454. condemne all Stage-playes and Actors, as intollerable mischiefes in a state: and as the occasions of much adultery, villany, lewdnesse, prodigality, and the like ; as their forequoted testimonies more largely prove, to which I shall referre you. To these I might adde C. Velleius Paterculus , Hist. l. 1. 37. Francofurti, 1602. p. 16. Taurus , the Philosopher, apud 38. Gellium, Noctium Attic. l. 20. c. 4. who there labours to withdraw his scholler from Stagelayes, with a speech of Aristotle . Together with Macro the Philospher, tutor to 39. Caius Caligula ; whom he deissuaded from Playes and Players: as Philo Iud aeus . De Legatione ad Caium, p. 1342. records: and that passage of Plautus , in his Captivei Prologus . Raphelengij 1609. p. 105. where he writes thus. Profecto expedit fabul ae huic operam dare: Non pertractate facta est, neque idem ut caeterae: Neque spurcidici in sunt versus immemorabiles. Hic neque periurus leno est, nec meretrix mala &c . An infallible evidence that most Stage-playes are fraught with ribaldry; with bawdes, with whores and panders parts ; and that such Playes are lewd and vile, not fit for Pagan (much lesse for Christian) Auditors, as this passage intimates. If then all these several Pagan Writers, Philosophers, Historians, Poets of chiefest note, (which none but Atheists, or men more desperately wicked, dare taxe for Puritans) have thus censured Playes and Players, as intollerable mischievous evils, even in a heathen Commonweale; taxing all such for vitious unworthy persons, who countenance or applaud them; can any Christian be so far past shame, past grace, or hopes of goodnesse, as once to patronize them? Alas, with what countenance or forehead can any Christian pleade for Playes or Actors as tollerable among Christians, which not onely Plato, Seneca and Tully , but even Ovid and Propertius too have long since doomed, as unfit for Pagans? With what assurance can any one stile himselfe a Christian , who in this case of Playes, of Actors, and such like branded evills, comes short of all these Pagans? If therefore there be yet any sparkes of ingenuity, modesty, grace or goodnesse remaining yet in Christians, whereby they may manifest to themselves and others, that they are, if not farre better, yet at least as good as all these Pagans: let them now at last declare it in abandoning, in suppressing Playes and Actors, which they have long since stigmatized as lewd pernicious evils, Alas what an intollerable eclipse and blemish will it be to the honour, purity, power and holines of Christian religion? what a desperate hazard unto all our soules, Si non pr aestat fides quod exhibuit infidelitas ? If Christians should fall short of Pagans in condemning Playes and Actors, and prove farre worse than they, as too too many doe? As therefore we desire to satisfie our owne consciences and others, or to secure our soules, that we are reall Christians as well in truth as appellation, let us now at leastwise equall, if not transcend these Pagans in anathematizing and renouncing Stage- playes, according to our vow in baptisme, which Pagans never made, who have no such strong professed solemne engagements against Playes, as we; who have our baptismall covenant to binde us , the concurring examples of all the forementioned primitive Christians, Fathers, Councels, and moderne Christian Writers , to induce us to it. And if any out of ignorance, perversenesse or prophanesse, have deemed it overmuch pr aecisenesse heretofore, to imitate the piety of the forequoted primitive or moderne Christians from age to age, in censuring, in renouncing Stage-playes, as execrable, lewd, infamous spectacles, unfit for Christians: let them not now degenerate so farre beneath themselves, as to prove worse than Pagans in this case of Playes, whom they should farre excell : but rather subscribe to this 51 Play-refelling Argument; which will certainly condemne and shame them, if it convince them not; with which I shall close up this Scene. That which 40 Heathen Writers, Philosophers, Historians, Orators and Poets of chiefest note, have unanimously censured, condemned from the very principles and remainders of corrupt nature, and their owne experimentall knowledge of its lewd pernicious effects; must doubtless be sinfull and altogether abominable unto Christians: Witnesse , Rom. 2. 14, 15, to 29 Ier . 2. 10. 11. c. 18. 13. 14. But these 40 recited Heathen Writers, Philosophers, Historians, Orators, and Poets of chiefest note, have unanimously censured and condemned Stage-playes, from the very principles and remainders of corrupt nature, and their owne experimentall knowledge of their many lewd pernicious effects: Witnes the premises, and Act. 6. Scene 3. & 5. Therefore they must doubtlesse be sinfull, and altogether abominable unto Christians. The seventh Squadron is composed of sundry Pagan and Christian States, Nations, Magistrates, Emperors, Princes, who have excluded, censured, banished, suppressed Playes  & Actors as the greatest mischiefes. If we look upon Heathen States or Nations, we shall find the ancient Lacedemonians, Athenians, Grecians, Romanes, Germanes, Massilienses, Goathes and Vandals: If upon Heathen Magistrates, Emperours, or Princes, we shall see Licurgus, Solon, Plato, Socrates, Themistocles, Scipio Nassica, Trebonius Rufinus, Iunius Mauricus , together with Augustus C aesar, Tiberius, Nero, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Domitia, Iulia, & the whole Roman Senate, excluding suppressing, condemning Playes and Actors, as the occasions of much vice and lewdnesse; the fomenters of whoredome, effeminacie, idlenesse, &c. the corrupters of the peoples mindes and manners; the authors of many tumults, discords, disorders; the causes of much prodigality of many intollerable mischiefes in a state : as I have more largly manifested, Act. 6. Scen. 3. 4, 5. to 20. on which you may reflect. If we looke on Christian States or Nations, we shall discerne the whole State and Nation of the Iewes both before and since Christs time , together with all the primitive Christians, the Waldenses, Albigenses, and French Protestants ; the Cities of Geneva, Tigure, Basil , and the whole State of England in sundry Acts of Parliament, condemning, suppressing Playes and Players, as most prophane unchristian Spectacles, not tollerable in any Christian Republike : witnesse Act. 6. Scene 3 4, 5, 12.  & Act. 7. Scene 2, 3, 4, 5. on which you may cast your eyes. If we desire any precedents of Christian Emperors, Princes, Magistrates; we have not only the examples of Noah, Melchizedeck, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Moses, Ioshuah, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Iosiah , with other godly Patriarkes, Kings and Princes, recorded in the Scriptures for our Christian imitation; who were so farre from cherishing from approving Enterludes, Mummeries, Masques or Stage-playes , either in their Pallaces, Courts or Kingdomes (as too many Princes since have done) that we never read in Scripture, nor in any other Story whatsoever, that they were so much as once experimentally acquainted with them; the whole Iewish Nation (some few Apostates onely excepted) oppugning them from time to time (and so by consequence these Patriarkes, Magistrates and Princes too) as opposite to their religion, manners, lawes and government , as I have elsewhere largely proved: (Which me thinks should some what move all Christian Princes  & Governors to abandon Stageplaies now, since they can finde no King, no pious person in all the Bible, that ever harboured or beheld them heretofore:) But likewise the patterns of Constantine, Theodosius,7 Leo, Anthemius, Iustinian, Valentinian, Valens, Gratian , Charles the Great, theodoricus, Henry, the 3. Emperour of that name, Philip, Augustus King of France; our famous Queen Elizabeth, & her Counsel, with our London Magistrates, and Vniversities in her raigne, who all suppresed, inhibited Stage-playes, Sword playes, and Actors, as unsufferable mischiefes in any Christian State or City . To these I might adde Lodovicus the Emperour , who by his publike Edicts (agreeing verbatim with the the 7.  & 8\. forequoted Canons of Synodus Turononsis 3\. p . 589, 590) inhibited all Ministers all Clergy men from Stage-playes, hunting, hauking &c . Together with Charles the 9\. and Henry 3. of France , (who by their solemne Lawes and Edicts prohibited all Stage-playes, all dancing on Lord- dayes, or other solemne annuall festivals, under paine of imprisonment, and other penalties to be inflicted by the Magistrates ;) and our owne most gracious Soveraigne Lord, King Charles ; who together with the whole Court of Parliament , in the first yeare of his Hignesse Raigne, enacted this most pious Play-condemning Law, (intituled, An Act for publishing of divers abuses committed on the Lords day, called Sunday.) Forasmuch as there is nothing more acceptable to God, than the true and sincere worship of him, according to his holy will, and that the holy keeping of the Lords day, is a principall part of the true service of God, which in very many places of this Realme hath beene, and now is profaned and neglected by a disorderly sort of people, in exercising and frequenting Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting , And for that many quarrells, bloodsheds, and other great inconveniences have growne by the resort and concourse of people going out of their owne parishes to such disordered and unlawfull exercises and pastimes, neglecting Devine service both in their owne parishes and elsewhere. Be it enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, the Lords spirituall and temporall, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same; That from and after 40 dayes next after the end of this Session of Parliament assembled, there shall be no meetings, assemblies or concourse of people out of their owne parishes on the Lords day within this Realme of England, or any the Dominions thereof for any sports or pastimes whatsoever: nor any Bull- baiting, Beare-baiting , Enterlvdes, Common Playes , or other unlawfull exercises or pastimes used by any persons or person within their owne perishes: and that every person or persons offending in any the premises shall forfeit for every offence 3 shillings 4 pence: the same to be employed and converted to the use of the poore of the Parish where such offences shall be committed. And that any one Iustice of the peace of the County, or the chiefe Officer or Officers of any Citie, Borough or Towne Corporate where such offence shall be comitted, upon his or their view, or confession of the partie, or proofe of any one or more witnesse by oath, which the said Iustice or chiefe Officer or Officers by vertue of this act shall have authority to minister, shall finde any person offending in the premises; the said Iustice or chiefe Officer or Officers, shall give warrant under his or their hand and seale to the Constables or Church -wardens of the Parish or Parishes where such offence shall bee committed, to levie the said penalty so to bee assessed, by way of distresse and sale of the goods of every such offender, rendring to the said offendors the overplus of the monie raised of the said goods so to be solde. And in default of such distresse, that the party offending be set publikely in the stockes by the space of three houres . Which Act, being to continue unto the end of the first Session of the next Parliamet, only : was since recontinued by the Statute of 3. Caroli cap 4\. and so it remaineth still in force: So that if it were as diligently executed, as it was piously enacted, it would suppresse many great abuses (both within the letter and intent, which is very large) that are yet continuing among us to Gods dishonour, and good Christians griefe in too many places of our Kingdome; which our Iustices, our inferiour Magistrates might soone reforme, would they but set themselves seriously about it, as some here and there have done. If then all these Pagan, these Christian Nations, Republickes, Emperors, Princes, Magistrates, have thus abandoned, censured, suppressed Playes and Players, from time to time, as most intollerable pernicious evils in any State or City, how can, how dare we now to justify the, as harmelesse, comendable, or usefull recreations? What, are we wiser, are we better than all these Pagan Sages; than all these judicious Christian Worthies, who have thus abandoned, suppressed Playes and Actors, out of a long experimentall knowledge of their many vitious lewd effects? Or are we ashamed to be like our ancestors in judgement, in opinion, as wee are in tonsure, complement, habit and attire in this age of Novelties, which likes of nothing that is old or common, (though such things commonly are the best of all .) that wee thus undervalue the resolutions of all former ages in this case of Playes and Players, preferring our owne wits and lusts before them? O let us be ashamed now at last to countenance, to pleade for that, which the very best, the wisest Heathen, yea Christian Nations, States and Magistrates of all sorts, have thus branded and cast out as lewd, as vitious, as abominable in the very highest degree;  & let us now submit our judgments, our practise, lusts and foolish fansies to their deliberate mature experimentall censures; abominating, condemning Playes and Players, if not exiling them our Cities coasts and Countrey, as all these have done: arming our selves with peremptory resolutions against all future Stage-playes, with this 52 Play-oppugning Syllogisme, with which I shall terminate this Scene. That which the ancient Lacedemonians, Athenians, Gr aecians, Romans, Germanes, Massilienses, Barbarians, Gothes and Vandals; the whole Iewish Nation of old; divers Christian Countries, and Citties since: together with many Pagan, many Christian Republickes, Magistrates, Emperours, Princes in severall ages and places, have censured, abandoned, rejected, suppressed, as a most pernicious evill, as a very seminary of all vice and wickednesse; must certainly be sinfull, execrable, and altogether unlawfull unto Christians: Witnesse . Rom. 13. 6. c. 13. 1, to 8\. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. But such is the case and condition of Stage-playes: as the premises, and Act. 6. Scene 5. &c. most plentifully evidence. Therefore they must certainly be sinfull, execrable, and altogether unlawfull unto Christians. Authorities encountering Stage-playes and Actors, and giving them such an onset, as I hope will put them with their Patrons quite to route, so that they shall never be able to make head againe; their forces being so weake, so few, that they cannot bring one Councell, one Father, one ancient, one moderne Christian or Pagan Writer of any note into the field, to maintaine their cause, against this army royall of Play-condemning Authorities, which I have here mustered up against them. It is not their long since conquered and confuted Lodge or Haywood (two scribling hackney Players, their onely professed printed Play- Champions that I know of,) who can withstand their all-conquering troopes; which either severall, or united, are impregnable; able to over-power to vanquish all the forces, that the whole world can raise against them. Let it therefore be your wisdome now at last to take the best, the strongest side, not onely in quality, but in number too. Stage-playes and Actors, (as the foregoing Scenes declare;) have bin oppugned, condemned in all ages, all places, by all sorts of men; Iewes and Gentiles, Greekes and Barbarians, Christians and Pagans; emperours, Magistrates, people, Writers of all sorts, have bent, not onely their hearts and judgements, but their very hands, their tongues, their pens and power against them: Yea those who are dead and rotten long agoe, still fight against them in their surviving workes: ( Licet ossa jacent, calamus bella gerit) :) and they will one day rise up in judgement (as they doe now in armes) against us, if we submit not to them. Let us, O let us not therefore be any longer besotted, befooled with these lewd stigmatized Playes or Actors, as we have beene in former times; but since all Ages, all Nations, (yea those who loved them best and most at first, to wit, the Greeks and Romans ) together with all primitive and moderne pious Christians, Fathers, Councels, Writers, have thus unanimously, successively condemned, renounced them, let us abominate and reject them too. It was the branded infamie of the Iewes, that they pleased not God, and were contrary to all men : and will it not be ours too, if all these Authorities will not sway us? If Scriptures, Councels, Fathers; if Christian, if Pagan Writers, Nations, Cities, Republickes, Emperours, Magistrates, Kings, and Edicts thus severed, thus united, will not stir, nor draw us from our Stage-playes, Play-houses and Actors, what then can we conclude of our selves but this; that God hath given us over to an impenitent heart, a reprobate sence, a cauterized conscience, if not to strong delusions, to beleeve , to affect these lying Playes and Fables; that we all might be damned, who will not beleeve the truth , which all these Witnesses have confirmed; but take pleasure in unrighteousnesse , in ungodly Playes and Actors, which leade their followers to destruction, and without repentance plunge them into hell for ever , amids those filthy Divels, whose disavowed pompes and workes, they deeme their chiefest pleasures. Let us therefore earnestly pray to God, to open our eares, that we may heare: to incline our hearts that we may beleeve, what all these testifie and averre of Stage-playes; that so now at last we may take our finall farewell of them, as all true penitent Christians have done before us , and never returne unto them more, to Gods dishonour, the Republickes dammage, or our owne eternall ruine; concluding from henceforth of all Stage-playes , all amphitheatricall Spectacles , as Prudentius , that worthy Christian Poet, did many hundred yeares agoe: Heulquid vesani sibi vult ars impialudi ? H ae sunt deliciae Lovis Infernalis ; in istis Arbiter obscuri placidus requiescit Averni. And then we neede no more, no other arguments to disswade us from resort to Stage-playes, when we shall thus adjudge them, the chiefest delights of the infernall Divel Iove, who rests well pleased, well delighted with them , as too many carnall Christians doe; who will one day rue it, when it is too late, if they now repent it not in time. Having thus at large evinced the unlawfulnesse of Stage-playes by Reasons, by Authorities; I come now to refute those miserable Apologies, those vaine pretences, or excuses rather, which their Advocates oppose in their defence; the most of which are already answered to my hands. Apologies for Stage-playes are of great antiquity. Tertullian in his booke De Spectaculis, cap . 1, 2, 3.  & 8\. brings in the Pagan Romans, (whose consciences the pleasures of these enchanting Enterludes had bribed ) apologizing for their Playes with great acutenesse; the feare of losing these their secular pleasures adding a kinde of sharpnesse to their wits . I finde St. Cyprian complaining. that the vigour of Ecclesiasticall discipline was so farre enervated in his age. and so precipitated into worse in all dissolutenesse of vice; that vices were not onely excused, but authorized; there wanting not such flattering Advocates and indulgent Patrons of naughtinesse who gave authority unto vices; and which was worse, converted the very censure of the heavenly Scriptures into a justification of crimes and Stage-playes; producing some texts of Scripture in defence of Playes , as well as reasons; which this Father at large refells. The like Play-apologies of voluptuous Pagans, I reade recorded in Arnobius , Chrysostome , Augustine , and Salvian ; who answer them to the full. And as these Pagans of olde, so some who would be deemed Christians now, (as namely one Thomas Lodge a Play-poet, in his Play of Playes , and one Thomas Haywood a Player, in his Apology for Actors ,) have lately pleaded as hard for Stage-playes, as ever Demetrius did for his great Diana :) whose severall allegations in the behalfe of Playes are soledly refelled; by Mr. Stephen Gosson , in his Playes confuted : by the Authour of the 3\. Blast of Retrait from Playes and Theaters ; by Mr. Iohn Northbrooke in his Treatise against vaine Playes and Enterludes ; by Dr. Rainolds , in his Overthrow of Stage-playes : by I: G : in his Refutation of the Apologie for Actors , (which you may peruse at leisure) and by sundry others forerecited , whom I spare to mention. The Players, the Play-patrons of our present age, as their cause is worse, so their Pleas for Playes are no other, no better than those of former times, which neede no other replies then what these Fathers, these Authours have returned: yet since their answeres are now growne obsolete, and our Play-Advocates persevering in their former folly, proceede to justifie one vanitie, one falshood with another, disputing much for the lawfull use of Stage-playes (perchance to exercise or declare their witts in the unhappy patronage of evill things :) I shall therefore addresse my selfe to give a satisfactory answer to all their chiefe Play- propugning Objections, that so I may put them to perpetuall silence. The first, if not the best Argument in defence of Stage-playes, may be cast into this forme. That which is not prohibited, but rather approved and commended by the Scripture, cannot be sinfull nor unlawfull unto Christians. But Stage-playes are not prohibited, but rather approved and commended by the Scripture. Therefore they cannot bee sinfull nor unlawfull unto Christivns. The Major being unquestionable, the Minor may be thus confirmed. Acts 19, 29, 31. there is mention made of the Theatre at Ephesus a place wherein Playes were acted : and in the 1 Cor . 4. 9. St. Paul writes of himselfe and of the other Christians in this age: We are made a Theatre or Spectacle unto the world, unto Angels, and to men . To which may be added the 1 Kings 13\. 8. 2 Kings 16\. 14, 15, 17.  &c. 2, 11, 12, 1 Cor . 9. 24, 25. & 15\. 22. Eph . 6. 11, 12, 13, 14. which mentio horses, chariots, races, duels, combates: alluding to the Olympian games, the Roman Circus, Sword- playes, and other amphitheatricall Spectacles , which these Scriptures seeme to justifie; and so by consequence Stage-playes too, which are in the selfesame predicament. To this I answer first; though Stage-playes are not expresly condemned in the Scripture by name, yet they are in other generall tearmes (as well as Apostasie, Atheisme, poysoning, Incest and such other sinnes whose names we finde not in the text) as I have already proved : So that both the Major and Minor are false. Secondly, I answer, that the reason why Stage-playes are not by name condemned in the Scripture is, because the penmen of it being Iewes, were unacquainted with Stage-playes, which the Iewes would not admit, as being opposite to their religion, and pernicious to their State : wherefore they condemne them onely under those generall termes, of Idolatry, sacrifices of Idols, vanities of the Gentiles, rudiments and customes of the world, &c . under which they are fully comprized. Thirdly, though the Scriptures inhibit not Stage-playes by name, yet St. Paul himselfe in his Constitutions , (if Clemens Romanus may be credited) hath condemned Playes and Players in expresse tearmes , decreeing, that all Players and Play-haunters should desist from Stage-playes, or else be cast out of the Church ; and the other Apostles also decreed the like : yea the whole primitive Church in severall generall and Nationall Councels, the ancient Fathers in their renowned writings, and the holiest Christians) from age to age, have given sentence against them as unlawfull Spectacles, which the word of God inhibits as misbeseeming Christians : this therefore is sufficient to disprove the Minor. Fourthly, the Scriptures here produced as approving Stageplayes, doe no wayes countence, but oppugne them. For first, that Theatre mentioned Acts 19\. 29. 31. was not a Theatre on which Playes were acted, but a place of publike meeting, where malefactors were punished, Orations made to the people, and the Magistrates and people usually met together to consult of publike affaires : A place much like the Pr aetorium, into which our Saviour was brought, Matth : 27. or like to Areopagus or Marshill in Athens, where Paul made an Oration to the Athenians: Acts 17\. 19, 22. That this was such a Theatre, is evident: First, because such places of publike concourse and consultation, where speeches were made, and malefactors sometimes executed , were stiled Theatres : witnesse Ausonius , Apuleius , Cicero , Tacitus , Livie , Philostratus , Varro , Philo , Chrysostome , Synesius, Iuvenal, Appianus, & Bulengerus De Theatro, l . 1. c . 32. where this very text is quoted. Hence Eusebius and Nicephorus, write , that Ignatius with other Martyrs were tortured and put to death in the Theatre : yea hence Orosius , (and out of him Baronius and Spondanus ) record; that Iulian the Apostate, commanded a Theatre to be built of the materialls that were brought to reedifie the temple at Hierusalem, in which Theatre after his returne from Persia he intended to cast the Bishops, Monkes, and other Christian inhabitants of that place to beasts which should teare them in peeces: ut scilicet ibi esset Christianorum carnificina, unde eoru religio videretur esse progressa . Secondly, the very words and circumstances of the text assure us, that this was such a Theatre: For first, it is said. that all the people rushed with one accord into the Theatre , v. 29. as into a place of common counsell. Secondly, that the cause of this their concourse was, to prevent the decay of their craft of making silver shrines, and to maintaine the honour of their great Goddesse Diana : v. 27. Thirdly, that Paul would have entred into the Theatre to have made an Oration unto the people., from which his friends disswaded him : v. 30, 31. Fourthly, that the assembly there was confused, some crying one thing, some another, and that the most part knew not why they were come together : verse 32. Fifthly, that they caught Gaius and Aristarchus, and drew them as malefactors into the Theatre : verse 29. Sixthly, that they drew Alexander out of the multitude, who there beckened to them, with his hand, and would there have made his defence to the people : v. 37. Seventhly, that the Town clerke made there a solemn speech to the people, admonishing them to be quiet, and to doe nothing rashly against Paules companions, whom they had brought into the Theatre, since they were neither robbers of Churches, nor yet blasphemers of their Goddesse: informing Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen, that if they had a matter against any man, the Court-dayes were kept, and there were deputies before whom they might implead one another: and they if inquired any thing councerning other matters, it should be determined in a lawfull assembly:v , 35. to 4l. All which concurring particulars infallibly prove, that this Theatre was onely a place of publike counsell, justice and execution ; not a Theatre whereon Playes were acted; therefore it gives no colour of approbation to Playes or Play-houses, no more than the Courts of Iustice at Westminster argue, that the Playes and Play-houses about London are lawfull. But admit this Theatre were a place for Stage-playes, yet it affords no justification at all to Playes or Play-houses. For the assembly in the Theatre, which this Scripture mentions, was but a tumultuous concourse of Idolaters, without any lawfull authority: and that not to act or see a Stageplay, but to defend their Goddesse Diana, and their idolatrous trade of making her silver shrines, by which they got their living: to persecute St. Paul and his companions, whom, they accused as malefactors, and to withstand the preaching of the Gospell, which would suppresse their trade and their Diana both together . This unlawfull assembly therefore, which both the Scripture, their owne Towne-clerke , and themselves condemned, is no justification of, but a strong evidence against our Play-assemblies, which are commonly as tumultuous, as opposite to Christs word, his Saints, his kingdome, as this Ephesian conventicle. Secondly, that text of 1 Cor. 4.9. We are made [illeg.] and most Latine Authors  render, Spectaculum ; and our English Translations, a Spectacle, or gazing-stocke : makes nought for Stage-playes. For what if the Apostles were made a Theatre or Spectacle to the world, to Angels and to men : (that is, as some Fathers interpret it; The whole world of men and Angles good and bad, beheld the miseries, the afflictions they endured for Christ and his Gospell, not onely in one corner, but in all the quarters of the world . Or as others of them paraphrase it: They were made a wonderment, a laughing-stocke to uncleane spirits, and to the wicked of the world, who rejoyced at their miseries, their torments, being glad to see them drawne to the place of execution called [ Theatrum ] a Theatre, where the innocent Martyrs for the most part suffered in the view of all the people , as our Traytors usually suffer on a Stage or scaffold, erected for that purpose: both which expositions some good Interpreters have conjoyned:) yet this no wayes justifies bnt oppugnes our Stage-playes. For first, the Apostles did not make themselves a voluntary Spectacle, as all Players doe; but they were made Spectacles by others. Secondly, they were no Spectacles of lasciviousnesse, vanitie, follie, mirth, or wickednesse, as Plaies and Plaiers are; but of grace, of faith, of pietie, patience, constancy, martyrdome , and the like which Plaies and Plaiers are not. Thirdly, they were Spectacles of Gods owne institution, they being appointed, called, destinated to their sufferings by God himselfe ; whereas Plaies and Actors are Spectacles not of Gods, but of the very Divels owne invention and appointment . Fourthly, they were memorable publike Spectacles of admiration, of imitation, both to the world, to Angels, and to men : Playes, Players and Play-haunters were yet never such. Fifthly, they were reall, not hypocriticall, histrionicall personated Spectacles, consisting of representations onely, as all Playes and Actors are. Sixthly, they were Spectacles appointed onely unto death , not to laughter: Spectacles of passion, of compassion, not of mirth and pleasure: Spectacles onely at a stake, appointed unto martyrdome; not on a stage, to stir up laughter: Spectacles they were, which the very Angles and Saints applauded, not condemned; which Divels and wicked men derided, persecuted, not applauded: Spectacles, which were the crowne, the honour, not the reproach, and infamy of Christianity, as Playes and Players are : therefore they give no colour, no approbation to our Play-house Spectacles with which they have no Analogie, but this alone; that as the chiefe agents in the Apostles and Martyrs tortures, were desperate wicked men, envenomed, enraged with bitter rancor against all grace, all goodnesse; even such are the common Actors and Abetters of our theatricall Enterludes . All the argument then that our Play-patrons can collect from hence, is from the allusion which the Apostle hath to Theatres, to Spectacles; which being an allusion onely to the spectacle of a Martyr, at the stake; or of a malefactor at the place of execution, as all Expositors accord; not to a Play or Enterlude on a Stage, subverts their very foundation, and takes them off from this their hold, in which they had most repose. But admit, it were an allusion to a Play-house Theatre, yet as theeves can never justifie their stealing, nor usurers their usurie to be lawfull, because the Scripture saith, that Christ, that the day of the Lord shall come as a theefe in the night : and that he will require his owne with usurie no more can our Play-champions conclude from hence, that Stage-playes are warrantable or lawfull among Christians, because St. Paul by way of similitude, writes thus of himselfe and his fellow-Apostles: Wee are made a Theatre or Spectacle to the world, unto Angels, and to men . These two maine Scriptures being thus fully vindicated from our Play-proctors wrestings, the other will fall away of themselves: there being no analogie at all betweene a race and a Stage-play: an horse or chariot for warre, and a Comedie for sport. I shall therefore answer them all together in St. Cyprians words. In this place I may say, that it had beene better for these Objectors never to have knowne the Scriptures, than thus to reade and wrest them. For these words and examples which are laid downe as exhortations to evangelicall vertue, are translated into apologies for vice; For these things are written, not that they should be gazed upon, but that a more earnest vehemency should be stirred up in our minds in profitable things, whiles there is so great a diligence in Ethnickes in unprofitable things. It is an argument therefore of exciting vertue, not a permission or libertie of beholding the Gentiles error; that by this the minde may be more enflamed to evangelicall vertue by divine rewards, when as men must passe through the miserie of all toyles and griefes, before they can come to terrene emoluments . That Elias is the horseman or charitoter of Israel, it yeelds no patronage to the beholding of Cirque- playes, for he never ranne in any Circus: That David danced in the sight of God, it no wayes availes nor justifieth the sitting of faithfull Christians in the Theatre: for by distorting none of his members with obscene motions, hee hath ended the dance, and put a period to the Play of Gr aecian lust. His Lute, his trumpets, flutes and harpes have resounded Gods praises, not an Idols. It is not therefore hence determined, that unlawfull things may be looked on: those lawfull things by the Divels cunning being now changed from holy into unholy things. Let shame therefore instruct or restraine these men, although the holy Scriptures cannot doe it. For is it not a shame, is it not a shame I say, for faithfull men, who challenge to themselves the name of Christians, to justifie the vaine superstitions of the Gentiles intermixed with their Stage-playes, out of the sacred Scriptures, and to give authority to Idolatry? For when that which is done by Ethnickes to the honour of any Idol is frequented by Christians in a Stage-play, both heathen idolatry is maintained, and in contumely of God, true religion is trod under foote . This is St. Cyprians answer to the objected Scriptures, and with it I rest. The second Objection in defence of Playes is this: that they are innoxious, pleasant, honest & landable recreations, which the ancient Greekes and Romans not onely tollerated but applauded : therefore they are tollerable among Christians. Not no answer this objection with that exclamation of Volateranus in this very case of Playes: Sed quid nunc dc f aece hujus saeculi dicam? quum virtutem ac gloriam, veterum, imitari nullo pacto valeamus, vitia tamen omni studio imitamur. Iam scena ubique renovata est, ubique comaedias spectat uterque sexus, quodque longe impudentius, ipsi Sacerdotes et praesules, quorum erat officium omnino prohibere. Multo igitur severiores in hac parte Graeci, qui omnes suos comicos jamdin aboluerunt, propter unum Aristophanem, quamvis moribus minime officeret . I answer first; that Playes are no harmelesse. honest or laudable recreations, as all the premised Authorities, and this whole treatise prove at large: this objection therefore is but a begging of the cause in question. Secondly, I answer, that although some Pagan Greekes and Romanes approved Stage-playes at the first in lewd and dissolute times; yet at last after long experience of those intollerable mischiefes which they occasioned, enforced by deare bought repentance, they banished them their Commonweales and Territories by publike solemne Edicts, as inconsistent with their safety . And although some vitious histrionicall Roman Emperours, as Nero, Caligula, Heliogabalus, Commodus , and others, reduced Plaies & Plaiers, yet the gravest Roma Emperors, Senators, Philosophers did still oppose and reexile them as the seminaries of all vice and lewdnesse, and intollerable mischiefes in the Commonweale : as I have largely proved . Wherefore wee should rather imitate the best, the wisest Pagan Greekes and Romans in abandoning, than the worst or lewdest in retaining Stage-playes. Secondly, the reason why the ancient Pagans, Gr aecians and Romans tollerated plaies and plaiers (as Bodine and Guevara observe) was not for any good or laudable quality in them, but onely out of superstition and idolatrous devotion to their Idol- gods , who exacted solemne Stage-playes from them as the most pompous if not serious part of their idolatrous worship: which Playes (saith Guevara) were dedicated to them by the divine sufferance of the living God, who would that their Idol-gods being but laughing-stockes should be served, honoured and feasted by jeastures, mockes and Playes . The truth of this is evident, not onely by that of Aristotle; who prohibiting the sight of all unchast fabulous Playes or pictures, and advising the Magistrates to suppresse them; comes in with this exception: Nisi forte apud illos Deos, quibus etiam per leges lascivia illa conceditur, et apud quos sacra facere aetate quidem provectioribus pro se, pro liberis et conjugibus permittitur : by Dionysius Hallicarnasseus. Antiqu. Rom. l. 2\. c. 5\. & 7\. c. 9. by Cicero in Verre, Act. 6\. Oratio de Aruspicum Responsis. p. 524, 526, 527. Oratio. 3. in Catilinam, p. 452\. b. Where he informes us, that Stage-playes were exacted by, and dedicated to the Roman gods, who were honoured and attoned by them: by Thucidides Histori ae, lib. 3\. p. 291\. Polybius Histori ae l. 4\. p. 340\. C. and Diodorus Siculus Bibl. Hist. l. 4\. sect. 5\. 6. 7. p. 202, to 206\. with sundry other Pagans: and by St. Augustine. De Civitate Dei lib. 2\. c. 4\. to 15\. & l. 4\. c. 20. 27. HRabanus Maurus l. 2\. c. 10\. with others formerly quoted ; but by that also which Livy and Ovid have recorded of the Romanes: who when as all the Fidlers and Players departed from Rome to Tibur in one discontented company, because the Censors prohibited them to eate in the Temple of Iove, as they had accustomed: the Senate out of their care to religion (there being no man left in Rome to sing and play before their sacrifices) sent embassadours after them to Tibur, requesting the Tiburtines to doe their best endeavour to perswade them to returne to Rome: upon which embassie the Tiburtines sent for these companions into their Senate house, where they first perswaded them to goe backe to Rome; but their intreaties not prevailing, they concluded to make them drunke with wine , ( of which they were very greedy) and then to put them into carts being drunke, and so to carry them backe to Rome; which they did accordingly. Where upon their returne, the Senate to obtaine their good will, restored them to their former priviledges, and withall authorized them to goe freely about the Citty, and to act their solemne Stage-playes every yeare . Vpon which Valerius Maximus descants thus: Personarum usus pudorem circumvent ae temulentiae causam habet . Idolatrie therefore, and the pleasing of Idol-Gods being the chiefe, if not the onely cause why these Pagan Greeks and Romans allowed Playes or Players ; their example grounded on this reason, should rather engage all Christians eternally to detest them, than any wayes to approve them . Thirdly, admit that Stage-plaies were in high estimation among these lascivious vitious Pagans, yet they were evermore execrable among Christians, who have constantly abandoned them from age to age . It is therefore a great dishonour, a shame, if not a sinne for Christians (who should follow the footsteps of their blessed Saviour onely, and those who walke as he hath walked ; abandoning all the fashions, wayes and customes of lewd idolatrous Pagans :) to swerve from Christ and primitive Christians as not worthy the following in this case of Plaies; and to make the worst, the most lascivious heathens, the guides and patternes of their actions. Alas, where is our Christianitie, our pietie, our obedience or our love to Christ, if we chuse rather to imitate the very vices of the lewdest Pagans than the graces, the holinesse of the best Christians? It was the brand, the infamie of the Iewish Nation; that they were mingled among the heathen, and learned their workes : and shall it not be much more ignoble and sinfull for us Christians, to justifie the lawfulnesse of Stage-playes from the bare examples of these wicked Pagans? O let it be never be heard in Gath, nor published in Askelon , that any Christians should grow so atheistically prophane, so stupendiously impious, as to preferre the lewd examples of the deboisest heathens, before the unparalleld patternes of their most holy Saviour, and the best of Christians: (alas, what need we run to such precedents of impiety, when as we have better examples nearer hand?) but since all Christian, yea, the very best of Pagan Greeks and Romanes have utterly condemned and exploded Stage-playes, the very worst of Greekes and Romanes onely approving them by their practise, and that to sinister ends : let us rather imitate the best, the wisest of them in abandoning, than the very worst of them in patronizing, in applauding Stage-playes; for feare we renounce our Christianity, and prove farre worse than the very worst of Pagans ever were. The third Objection in the behalfe of Playes is this; that they are not onely commendable but necessary in a Commonweale; and that in three respects: First, for the solemne entertainment and recreation of forraigne Embassadours, States and Princes: Secondly, for the solemnizing of festivals and triumphes: Thirdly for the exhileration and necessary recreation of the people. Therefore they ought to be countenanced, continued, not suppressed. To this I shall first reply; that Stage-playes are so far from being commendable or necessary in a Comonweale, that they are the very greatest mischiefes which can befall it: whence the wisest States and Magistrates have beene so farre from tollerating, that they have quite discarded them as inconsistent with the publike welfare . So that the very ground of this objection failes, and then the particulars cannot stand, which I shall now examine. For the first of them; that Stage-playes are necessary for the solemne entertainment of Embassadours, and forraigne States; though I will not take upon me to define what entertainment will befit such personages; yet with all humble submission to better judgments, I conceive, that common Stage- playes (to which every cobler, tinker, whore, and base mechanicke may resort from day to day, as many of them doe ) are no meete sports or entertainments for Christian Princes, States, and Potentates ; whose pietie, majestie, gravitie are so transcendent, that they cannot but disdaine the sight, the presence of such ridiculous, infamous, scurrilous, childish Spectacles, as common Stage-playes are, which savour neither of state, nor royaltie, but of most abject basenesse, though too many great ones (I know not out of what respects) have vouchsafed to honour them (or rather dishonoured themselves ) with their presence. For my owne part it is beyond my Creed to beleeve, that Christian Monarches, Peeres, or forraigne Embassadours, who are (at leastwise should be) men of highest dignity , of eminentest piety , severest gravity, deepest wisdome, sublimest spirit, and most sober , exemplary conversation, without any mixture of levitie, vanitie, or childish folly , (the least tincture of which in men of supreme ranke, ( though it be but in their sports ) is no small deformity, no meane ecclipse unto their fame ) should so farre degenerate, or descend below themselves , as to admit of common Plaies or Actors, (the most infamous, scurrilous, ignoble pleasures and persons that the world affords ) into their royal presence. We know that many Christian, many Pagan States and Emperours, have long since sentenced, exiled Playes and Players, and that the whole Church of God, with all faithfull Christians from age to age have execrated and cast them out, as the very greatest grievances, shames and cankerwormes both of Church and State : We know, that many publike Acts of Parliaments , even of this our Realme, have branded Players with the very name, the punishment of Rogues and Vagabonds, and condemned Stage-playes as unlawfull Pastimes . And can any one then be so brainsicke, so shamelesse to affirme, that these anathematized heathenish Spectacles, these stigmatized varlets, (which all times, all Christians, all men of gravity and wisdome have disdained as the most lewd infamous persons, are fit to entertaine the noblest Princes, or to appeare before them in their royall Pallaces, at times of greatest state? Certainly as Eagles scorne to stoope at flies, or as magnanimous lions disdaine to chace a mouse ; even so those generous Christian Monarches, who have cast out Playes and Actors as intollerable mischiefes in their meanest Citties; will never so farre grace them , as to deeme them worthy to approach their Courts , as necessary ornaments and attendants, on dayes of most solemnitie. It was King Davids godly protestation; that he would set no wicked thing before his eyes; that the worke of those who turned aside should not cleave unto him: That a froward heart should depart from him, and that he would not know a wicked person: who so privily slandereth his neighbour, him (saith he) will I cut off: him that hath an high looke and a proud heart, I will not suffer: he that worketh deceit shall not dwell in my house; he that telleth lies shall not tarrie in my sight, &c . Certainlie, there is never a true Christian Prince or Potentate this day living, but is, but must, or ought to be of Davids mind, he being a man after Gods owne heart : therefore hee can never suffer Stage- plaies, which are wicked, lewd and heathenish Pastimes; or common Actors, (who are perverse, yea froward, wicked, proud, deceitfull, slanderous, lying persons in the highest degree ) to come into his presence, or harbour in his pallace. A King that sitteth in the throne of judgement (saith the wisest King) scattereth all evill with his eyes : yea, A wise King scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheele over them, Prov.20.8, & 26\. Needs therefore must a just, a prudent Christian Prince, abandon Playes and Players from before his eyes, the one being the greatest evills to a State: the other, the very worst and most infamous men . It is true indeed, that some dissolute Roman Emperors as Caligula, Nero, Heliogabalus, Carinus, and others, have beene much enamoured with Playes and Actors : but this was onely the blot, the infamie of these shames of Monarchy , as Philo Iudus , Marcus Aurelius , Iuvenal , Iohn Sarisbery , and their owne Historians witnesse : who have recorded it onelie for their greater shame : Res haud mira tamen cythar aedo Principe mimus, Nobilis &c . being the sole encomium, that they have left behind them for it. Their examples therefore can be no good argument to second this objection, especially since the best Roman Senators, Monarches, both Pagan and Christian have exiled Stage-players, and suppressed Playes , as even Nero himselfe (who was most devoted to them, and most honoured Players) was at last enforced to doe, by reason of those intollerable oft-complained mischiefes which they did occasion . I confesse, that many Christian Writers both of ancient and moderne times, and among sundry others whom I spare to mention, Vincentius , Olaus Magnus , Iohn Sarisbery , and Peter de Bloyes , Archdeacon of Bath (two ancient English Writers; Æ n[illeg.]as Sylvius (afterwards Pope Pius the 2) and Mr. Radolphus Gualther , have publikely complained and bewailed in their writings; that Stage-players, Tomblers, Fidlers, Singers, Iesters, and such like idle persons, have followed Princes Courts, and haunted great mens houses; that they have there found accesse and harbour, when as experienced, vertuous, well-deserving men, have beene excluded, contemned, and sent away without reward; these caterpillars and pests of the commonweale, not onely anticipating in the meane while their charity to the poore, their bounty to men of best desert, but even exhausting their treasures, depraving their manners, fomenting their uices to the publike prejudice, and their owne eternall perdition : But this they censure as their shame, their folly and oversight, not their praise; as did St. Chrysostome long agoe, whose words I would these Objectors would observe: Wilt thou heare againe (saith he) some other things which shew the folly and madnesse of these wise Law-givers? They gather together Players & Theatres, & bring in thither troopes of harlots, of adulterous youthes &c. making all the people to sit on scaffolds over them: Thus recreate they the Citty; thus doe they crowne great Kings, whose victorious trophees they admire. But alas what is more cold than this honour? What more unpleasant than this pleasure? Doest thou then seeke applauders of thy actions among these? Tell me, I pray thee, wilt thou be praised with dancers, with effeminate persons, Stage-players, whores? And how can this be but the very extremity of folly and frenzie? But thou wilt say, these are infamous persons. Why then doest thou honour Kings, why doest thou murther Citties by such who are infamous? Why doest thou bestow so much upon them? For if they are infamous, they ought to be cast out, &c . It is therefore no lesse then madnesse , then extremest folly in St. Chrysostomes judgement, to honour, to Court Kings or great ones with Playes or common Actors : and a farre greater frenzie is it for such to foster, to applaud them; and to be praised by them ; because no true praise can proceed from any, but such who really deserve applause themselves . Adde we to him the verdict of laborious Gualther , who reputes it an argument of corrupted, of everted discipline, that at this day Players, Iesters, effeminate persons, and furtherers of most dishonest pleasures are in great request in Princes Courts and in great cities, &c . which he there proves at large.To him I shal annex that notable passage of Olaus Magnus to the like purpose, well worth all Princes, all Players and Play-haunters most serious consideration: in his Histori ae l. 15.c.31 . De Histrionibus et Mimis. 'Where he writes thus. Nemo miretur quod hac etiam pessima occupatione repleta sit h aec chartula pusilla, nempe talibus hominum generibus, quorum numerus est infinitus, et tantae reputationis in curijs et mensis sublimium Dominorum, ut fere vel nullum vel exiguum credatur adesse solatium praeter unicum hoc quod emanat ab infamibus his Protomimis. Refert Trebellius, Galerum in tantum dilexisse scurras et parasitos, et id genus infami ae hominum, ut poneret eos in secunda sua mensa. Si consilium Suetonij locus habuisset, tales mimi publico spectaculo virgis et flagris c aest, remotiusque effugati fuissent: quod et Vincentius in speculo Histori ae lib.29.c.41. de rege Galli ae Philippo attestatur ; quem asserit dixisse, Histrionibus dare est d aemonibus immolari, &c . And cap.34. De abjecta commendatione Mimorum, et utili laude prudentium: where he thus expresseth himselfe. Sed nec ignotum universis relinquitur , Qvanta Ignominia Principievs Sit , aut laudis cupidis a talibus commendari , quorum pr aecipua professio est infamibus colludere, turpibusque colloquijs bonos mores corrumpere, eosq; effaeminatos efficere, ac libidinosos reddere et luxuriosos: praeterea comaediarum more adulteria et stupra representare vel concinnere, unde spectandi enascatur voluptas et consuetudo, ac turpissima quaeque faciendi licentia perniciosa, et denique adomnium virorum gravium obmutescere rationem et censuram. Cujus rei testis est illa Massiliensis meretrix, qu ae in actu publico prostans vestemq; deducens, gravi Catone viso descendere in Spectaculum, a gestu se statim continuit, et alijs mirantibus, ait, severum virum adesse: qua quidem voce ostendit, longe pluris esse gravissimi viri aspectum, qu am totius populi applausum. Quocirca, et si cuncti, maxime principes laudari appetant , Tamen Intime Caveant , ne id procurant vel admittant fieri Ab Histrionibvs Et Protomimis Nisi Similes Illis Æstimari Et Forsan Esse Volvnt . Vera enim laus haberi debet, qu ae a laudato viro proficiscitur, quia a tali viro emanat qui virtute praeditus cum laude vivit. Sed haec peramplius verior esse judicatur, quae ex recte factis et justis meritis, multitudinis etiam laude concurrente procedit: alioquin nihil aliud nisi popularem auram aut scurrarum fucum captant: quo nihil instabilius aut detestabilius inveniri potest. Igitur attendendum erit unicuique , Maxime Principi in sublimiori dignitate constituto, ne sic scurrarum, mimorum, histrionum, protomimorum brevi tempore delectetur spectaculis, uti immemor salutis, perdito tempore, honore, laude, et bono nomine in uno momento rapiatur ad aeterna tormenta, quae ab immundis spiritibus forsitan in umbra et forma histrionum apparentibus et flagellantibus importunius sustineist; sentietque perpetuo flendum esse cum diabolis, sicuti in momentanea vita inconsiderate risit cum stultis. Exclamandum hic merito foret contra quosdam alti nominis viros, in sublimitate constitutos, qui pro summa voluptate ducunt, scurras videre et audire, nudas mulierum picturas intueri, et ijs delectari, atque alijs prebere videndas; quasi propria caro, mundus, et d aemonia non sufficerent ad infatuandum hominem, creatum ad imaginem Dei, ni et studiose in suam irreparabilem damnationem excitarent tot importunatissimos hostes, ignorantes verbum beati Gregorij, dicentis; Talem te ostendis in corde diligere, qualem imaginem ante te geris in oculis, &c . All which recited premises, together with that memorable fore-mentioned worthy speech of the Emperor Trajan to a Courtier, who intreated him to heare an active Player: and that private advice of Macro , unto Caius the Emperour ; insane spectantem saltatores it a ut una gesticularetur, aut ad mimorum scurrilia dicteria non subridentem, sed cachinnantem pueriliter &c . who whispered thus into his eare, ne quis audiret alius, bland e admonens: Non decet te alijs audiendo spectandoque et usu caeterorum sensuum esse similem, sed tantum debes in ratione vivendi excellere, quanto eminentiorem te fortuna constituit: absurdum enim fuerit terrae marisque principem, cantibus, cavillis, et hujusmodi ludis succumbere: oportet illum semper et ubique meminisse majestatis imperatoriae, tanquam pastorem gregi praepositum, et undicunque dictis factisque in melius proficiscere : (a good lesson for this scandalous, ignoble, dissolute Emperour, who was not onely a spectator, an applauder, but sometimes an actor too of Masques and Stage-playes to his eternall shame :) are sufficient to disprove this crack-brain'd frentique Objection of an infamous Player; That Stage-playes are necessary pastimes for the recreation, the solemne entertainment of Christian Princes, States, Embassadours, Nobles; whose majesty, whose greatnes cannot but disdain such base infamous spectacles, which make their Actors and Spectators infamous. Certainly he who shall reade the Epistle of Marcus Aurelius , unto Lambert ; the Panegyricke of C. Plinius Secundus , to the Emperor Trajan : the answer of Agesilaus , to Callipides the expert tragicke Player; (who saluting this royall King, and thrusting himselfe into his presence, expecting and hoping that this noble Prince would have taken some speciall notice of him, and spoken kindly to him; and then perceiving that he slighted him, demanded of him; Doest thou not know me o King, and hast thou not heard whom I am? who looking upon him, returned him no other reply but this, Art not thou Callipides the Player ? intimating, that Kings should wholly contemne such lewd infamous persons as not worthy their least respect:) or Guevara his Diall of Princes, lib. 3. c. 43. to 48. & Act. 6. Scene 5. Act. 7. Scene 2, 3, 6 . will presently adjudge all Stage-playes, all Actors, unworthy a Pagan, how much more then a Christian Emperours, Kings or Princes royall presence; who have farre more honourable, majestique, heroicke sports and exercises to refresh themselves withall: as tilting Barriers, Iusts, and such like martiall feates, (the ancient solemne festivall entertainments of Kings and Nobles, wherein our warlike English Nation have farre excelled others ;) with an hundred such like laudable exercises, savouring both of royalty, valour, and activity; which if they were now revived insteed of effeminate, amorous, wanton dances , Enterludes, Masques and Stage-playes, effeminacy, idlenesse, adultery, whoredome, ribaldry and such other lewdnesse would not be so frequent in the world as now they are . But admit this idle surmise as true as it is fabulous, it then administers a pregnant argument against all common Stage-playes: for if Stage- playes be meet ornaments for Princes pallaces at times of greatest state and royallest entertainment, great reason is there to suppresse their daily acting, and to appropriate them to such times, such places, such purposes as these, for feare their assiduity, their comonnes should make the despitably base and altogether unmeet for such sublime occasions . Extraordinary royall occasions, persons, entertainments will not suite with common prostituted Enterludes, which every tinker, cobler, foot-boy, whore or rascall may resort to at their pleasure, as they doe unto our Stage-playes; which as they are every mans for his penny, so they are every dayes Pastime too, at every roguish Play-house. And are such common hacknie Enterludes, thinke you, fit for high-dayes, for Princes Courts and presence? If therefore you will exalt these sordid Stage-playes to such sublime imployments as you here pretend, you must now shut up our standing Play-houses, and sequester all Stage-playes from the vulgar crew, appropriating them onely to some certaine solemne publike festivities, and times of royall entertainment , (as the ancient Greekes and Romans did; who had no constant (much lesse any private) Enterludes acted day by day, but onely publike Stage-playes, at times of publike triumph, or on the great solemne Feast-dayes of their Idol-gods, to whom they were devoted :) that so their raritie may ennoble them to such royall services as are pretended , when as their assiduous commonnesse hath now made the & their Actors base ; too base (I dare say) for any Princes presence, when as they deeme themselves highly honoured, with the very meanest varlets. To the second clause of this Objection, That Stage-playes are necessary for the true solemnizing of our Saviours Nativitie, and other such solemne Christian Festivalls; it is so diametrally opposite unto truth, above 40 severall Councels, besides Fathers and other Christian Writers professedly contradicting it, (See Act. 6. Scene 12. & Act. 7. Scene 3.) that I cannot so much as name it but with highest indignation. Alas into what atheisticall heathenish times are we now relapsed, into what a stupendious height of more than Pagan impiety are we now degenerated, when as Stage-playes ( the very chiefest pompes and ornaments of the most execrable pagan Idols festivities ) are thought the necessary appendants of our most holy Christian solemnities ? when as we cannot sanctifie a Lords- day, observe a fift of November, or any other day of publike thanksgiving to our gracious God, nor yet celebrate an Easter, a Pentecost, or such like solemne Feasts, (much lesse a ( Christmasse , as we phrase it) in a plausible pious sort, (as too many paganizing Christians now conceit ) without drinking, roaring, healthing, dicing, carding, dancing, Masques and Stage-playes? which better become the sacrifices of Bacchus , than the resurrection, the incarnation of our most blessed Saviour, which are most execrably prophaned, most unchristianly dishonoured with these Bacchanalian pastimes . What pious Christian heart bleedes not with teares of blood, when he beholds the sacred Nativitie of his spotlesse Saviour, transformed into a festivitie of the foulest Divels? when he shall see his blessed Iesus, who came to redeeme, to call men from their sinnes, and to purifie unto himselfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes ; entertained, honoured, courted, served like a Divell, yea rather crucified and nailed to his crosse againe , with nought else but desperate notorious sinnes, by an unchristian crew of Christians, (I might say Pagans , or incarnate Divels ) who during all the sacred time of his Nativity, when they should be most holy, are more especially and that professedly too, a most impure people, zealous of nothing but of Stage-playes, dicing, dancing, healthing, rioting and such evill- workes, as would make the very lewdest Pagans to blush for shame. Is this the honour, the entertainment , the gratitude, the holy service, the welcome we render to our Saviour, for his Nativity, his incarnation or his passion, to court him thus with heathenish Playes or hellish pastimes, as if he were no other, no better than a Pagan Idol or infernall Divel, who were alwayes worshipped, courted with such solemne Enterludes? Are Christ and Belial (thinke we) reconciled ? or is there no difference betweene our Saviours Nativity, and a Divel-Idols birth-day, that we thus commemorate them in the selfesame manner? For how did the idolatrous Gentiles honour, or please their Iupiter, Venus, Flora, Apollo, Berecynthea, Bacchus, and such like Divel-gods upon their gaudiest feast-dayes, but with healthing, dancing, Masques and Stage-playes ; the very workes and pompes of Satan, invented for, appropriated to these Idols service, as I have largely proved? and how doe we Christians spend or celebrate for the most part, the Nativity of our Saviour, but with such heathenish sports as these, which Turkes and Infidels would abhorre to practise? O wickednes, O prophanesse beyond all expression! even thus to abuse our Saviours solemne birth-time, as to make it a patronage for all kinde of sinne ! Were wee to celebrate the very foulest Idol-Divels birth-day (as many wretches doe in deedes , whiles they solemnize Christs in shew) how could we please or honour him more, than to court him with lascivious Masques or Stage-playes, (an invention of and for himselfe, which he hath oft exacted from his worshippers upon his solemne festivals :) or to give him the very selfesame welcome that most men give to Christ, in the feast of his Nativity; when the Divell hath commonly more professed publike service done him, than all the yeare beside? For may I not truly write of our English Citties, and Country villages in the Christmas season, as Salvian did of Rome; Video quasi scaturientem vitijs civitatem; video urbem omnium iniquitatum generi servientem, plenam, quidem, turbis, sed magis turpitudinibus: plenam divitijs, sed magis vitijs: vincentes se invicem, homines nequitia flagitiorum, suorum, alios impuritate Certantes, alios vino languidos, alios cruditate distentos, hos sertis redimitos, illos unguento oblitos, cunctos vano luxus marcore perditos, sed pen e omnes una errorum morte prostratas: non omnes quidem, vinolentia temulentos, sed omnes tamen peccatis ebrios. Populos putares non sani status, non sui sensus, non animo incolumes, non gradu, quasi in morem, baccharum, crapulae catervatim, inservientes &c . Those who are temperate and abstemious at all other times, prove Epicures and drunkards then. Those who make conscience to redeeme all other seasons , deeme it a point of Christianity to mispend all this , eating, drinking, and rising up to play , whole dayes and nights together. Those who are civill at other seasons, will be now deboist; and such who were but soberly dissolute before (if I may so speak) will be now stark mad, forgetting not onely their Saviour but themselves. Those who repute it a shame to be unruly disorderly any other part of the yeare; thinke it an honour to be outragiously disordered and distempered now, turning day into night, and night into day, against the course of nature, like Seneca his Antipodes , setting no bounds to any lust. That which is not tollerable at other times seemes laudable unto most men now: that which were it done at any other season could not but be condemned as an execrable sinne, becomes now a vertue, at least a veniall crime. In a word, those who make a kinde of conscience of drinking, amarous dancing, healthing, dicing, idlenesse, Stage- playes, and of every sinne at other times, deeme it a part of their piety to make no bones of these, of any deboistnesse or prophanesse now: those who are constant in religious familie-duties, now discontinue them; those who remembred their Saviour and sinnes before, now quite forget them: those who seemed Saints before, turne Divels incarnate now: those who were reasonable men before, are metamorphosed into beasts or monsters now: those who were formerly good at least in outward shew, doe now turne bad; and all who were bad before, prove now ten times worse;  & all under this pretence of solemnizing Christs Nativitie, as if he were delighted onely with their sins. Thus doe we even crucifie our blessed Saviour in his very cradle, and like that Tyrant Herod, seeke to take away his life, as soone as he is born , whiles we thus impiously celebrate  & prophane his birth, & eve pierce him through with these grosse disorders which are now too frequent among many Christians.Should Turkes & Indels behold our Bacchanalia Christmas extravagancies, would they not thinke our Saviour to be a glutton, an Epicure, a wine-bibber, a Divell, a friend of publicanes and sinners , as the Iewes once stiled him; yea a very Bacchus, a God of all dissolutenesse, drunkennesse and disorder, since his Nativitie is thus solemnized by his followers, who are never so dissolutely, so exorbitantly deboist in all kindes, as in this his festivall? Would they not take up that speech in Salvian. Ecce quales sunt qui Christum colunt? falsum plane illud est quod aiunt se bona discere, quod jactant se sanct ae legis praecepta retinere. Si enim bona discerent, boni essent. Talis profecto secta est, quales et sectatores: hoc sunt absque dubio quod docentur. Apparet itaque Prophetas quos habent impuritatem docere, et Apostolos quos legunt nefaria sensisse, et Evangelia quibus imbuuntur haec quae ipsi faciunt praedicare. Postremo sancta a Christianis fierent, si Christus sancta docuisset. Æstimari itaque de cultoribus suis potest ille qui colitur. Quomodo enim bonus magister est, cujus tam malos videmus esse discipulos? Ex ipso enim Christiani sunt, ipsum audiunt, ipsum legunt: promptum est omnibus Christi intelligere doctrinam. Vide Christianos quid agant, et evidenter potest de ipso Christo sciri quid doceat . Would they not condemne our God, our Saviour, our religion, and loath both them, and us? qui ita agimus ac vivimus, ut hoc ipsum quod Christianus populus esse dicitur, opprobrium Christi esse videatur ; as the same Father speakes. O in aestimabile facinus et prodigiosum! Quid non ausae sint improbae mentes , in the Christmas season? Armant se ad peccandum per Christi nomen; auctorem quodammodo sui sceleris Deum faciunt: et cum interdictor ac vindex malorum omnium Christus sit, dicunt se scelus quod agunt agere pro Christo . Such are our gracelesse unchristian Christmas lives: who when as our Saviour daily cries unto us: Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven : we on the contrary live so in the Christmas season, (that I speake not of other times) that the sonnes of men, that Infidels and Pagans may openly behold our evill workes, and blaspheme our Father, our most blessed Saviour, who is now grieving in heaven, whiles we are thus dishonouring his Nativitie here on earth. And should not our hearts then smite us, should not shame confound us all for this our heinous sinne? for this our indignity to our blessed Lord and Saviour, who never findes worse entertainment in the world than in the feast of his Nativity, when he expects the best? O let us now at length remember, that our holy Saviour was borne into the world for this very purpose, to redeeme and call us from (not to) those sinnes and sinfull pleasures ; to destroy out of us (not to erect within us) those very workes and pompes of Satan , which now we more especially practise at his sacred birthtide: as if he were borne to no other purpose, but to set hell loose, to give a liberty to all kinde of wickednesse, and to prove a meere broker (for such a one men then make him) to the very Divell. Did we but seriously consider and beleeve, that our Saviour Christ was for this end borne into the world; that hee might purifie and wash us both from the guilt, and power of all our sinnes in his most precious blood : that hee might sanctifie and cleanse us with the washing of water by the word from all iniquitie, and present us to himslfe a glorious Church without any spot or wrinkle : that he might teach us to deny ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present evill world, expecting every day his second comming : that he might quite destroy out of us the workes of the Divell, purge us from all iniquitie, and purifie us unto himselfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes : that wee being delivered out of the hands of our enemies might serve him without feare in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our lives , Shining as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation : that we should henceforth cease from sinne, and no longer live the rest of our time in the lusts of the flesh to the will of men, but to the will of God : that we might be holy in all manner of conversation and godlinesse, even as hee is holy , especially at holy seasons: that wee should not henceforth live unto our selves, but unto him who died for us and rose againe : that whether we live we might live unto him, or whether we die we might die unto him, and that living and dying we might be his ; glorifying him both in our soules and bodies which are his . And did we withall remember, that this our blessed Saviour hath called us, not to uncleannesse, but unto holinesse : that he hath likewise enjoyned us, to cast off all the workes of darknesse, and to put on the armour of light: to walke honestly as in the day; not in chambering and wantonnesse, not in rioting and drunkennesse , not in divers lusts and pleasures , according to the course of this wicked world, according to the power of the Prince of the ayre, which now worketh in the children of disobedience . That he hath seriously charged us, That wee walke not from henceforth as other Gentiles walke, in the vanity of their mindes, who having their understandings darkned, and being alienated from the life of God, and past all feeling, have given themselves over unto all lasciviousnesse to worke all uncleannesse with greedinesse. That wee put off concerning our former conversation the olde man which is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts; and that we put on the new man which after God is created in holinesse and true righteousnesse. That we take heed unto our selves, lest at any time (how much more at times of greatest devotion) our hearts be overcome with surfetting and drunkennesse, and that day come upon us at unawares. That we crucifie the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof, and abstaine from fleshly lusts which warre against our soules , since the time past of our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles; when as we walked in lasciviousnesse, lusts, excesse of wine, revellings, banquettings, and abominable idolatries : That we give up our soules and bodies as an holy and living sacrifice unto God; not fashioning our selves to the course of this present evill world , but keeping our selves unspotted from it : walking circumspectly as in the day, not as fooles, but as wise, redeeming the time because the dayes are evill; and making no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof . Did we (I say) but seriously ponder and unfainedly beleeve all this, it would soone turne our dissolute Christmas laughing, into mourning ; our bacchanalian jollities into sin- lamenting Elegies; our riotous grand-Christmasses into such pious Christian duties, as would both honour our Saviours birth-day, and make it welcome to our soules. Let us therefore cordially meditate on all these sacred Scriptures, on the ends of our Saviours blessed incarnation, (which was, to redeeme us from all these our sinnes and sinfull pleasures; to crucifie our lusts, to regenerate and sanctifie our depraved natures, to make us holy even as he is holy, and to conforme us to himselfe in all things :) and then this inveterate heathenish common custome of prophaning Christs Nativitie with all kinde of lasciviousnesse, wickednesse and delights of sinne, (which should be spent in honouring, blessing and praising of our gracious God for all his mercies to us in his Sonne: in Psalmes, in hymnes and spirituall songs; in holy and heavenly contemplations of all the benefits we receive by our Saviours blessed incarnation, in charitable relieving of Christs poore members, and mutuall amity one towards another:) will become most execrable to your pious soules. The damnablenesse of which much applauded unruly Christmas keeping that you may more evidently discerne, I shall for learning and religions sake discover whence it sprang; and that was, originally from the Pagan Saturnalia, from whence Popery hath borrowed and transmitted it unto us at the second hand. The ancient Pagan Romans, upon the Ides of December , consecrated to Saturne, and their Goddesse Vesta, (not in the Moneth of Ianuary, as Macrobius misreports) accustomed to keepe their Saturnalia, or annuall Feast of Saturne for 7 dayes together, which they spent in feasting, drinking, dancing, Playes and Enterludes : at the end of which they celebrated their Festum Kalendarum, on the first of Ianuary , (now our New-yeares day) to the honour of their Idol Ianus, which they likewise solemnized with Stageplayes, Mummeries, Masques, dancing, feasting, drinking, and in sending mutuall New-yeares gifts one to another, for divers dayes together . In these their Saturnalia and feasts of Ianus, all servants were set at libertie, and became checke-mates with their masters, with whom they sate at table: every man then wandred about without controll, and tooke his fill of pleasure, giving himselfe over to all kinde of luxurie, epicurisme , deboistnesse, disorder, pride and wantonnesse; to pastimes, Enterludes, Mummeries, Stage-playes, dancing, drunkennesse, and those very disorders that accompany our grand unruly Christmasses: which Saturnalia and Festivalls the ensuing Authors thus describe. Servi cum Saturnalia c aenant (writes Plutarch) aut Liberalia, in agro vagantes celebrant, ululatio eorum et tumultus ferre non possis pr ae gaudio et imperitia rerum pulcrarum, talia agentium et loquentium : Quid desides? quin bibimus et capimus cibos? Sunt h aec miselle, in promptu: cur tibiinvides? Vocem statim hi ded ere: tum Bacchi liquor Infunditur; et corona aliquis ornat caput. Laurique pulcram ad frondem turpiter canit, Inducia Ph aebo, januamq; alius domus: Pulsam operiens, excludit caram conjugem, &c. Saturnalibus tota servis licentia permittitur: ludi per urbem in compitis agitantur (writes Macrobius: ) Maxima pars Graium Saturno, et maxima Athen ae Conficiunt sacra, qu ae Cronia esse iterantur ab illis. Cumque diem celebrant, per agros urbesque fer e omnes Exercent Epulis l aeti, famulosque procuraut Quisque suos, nostrique itidem, et mos traditur illinc Iste, ut cum dominis famuli epulentur ibidem, &c. Parallell to which is that of Seneca: December est mensis quo maxim e Civitas desudat: jus luxuriae publice datum est: ingenti apparatu sonant omnia, tanquam quicquam inter Saturnalia nunc intersit, et dies rerum agendarum. Adeo nihil interest, ut non videatur mihi err asse qui dixit, olim mensem Decembrem esse, nunc annum, &c . And that of Horace: Age libertate Decembri--- (Quando ita majores voluerunt) utere: narra, &c. Nunc est bibendu, nunc pede libero pulsanda tellus; Nunc saliaribus ornare pulvinar Deorum, tempus &c. That the ancient Romanes (yea and the Graecians too) in times of Paganisme) did spend their Saturnalia, Feri ae , and other solemne Festivals in dancing, drinking, feasting, Mummeries, Masques and Enterludes, the Poet Virgil, Ovid, Tibullus, Philo Iud aeus , with sundry others , will plentifully informes us. The first of these describes it thus. Veteres ineunt proscenia ludi Pr aemiaq; ingentes pagos et compita circum Thesaid ae posuere, atque inter pocula laeti, Mollibus in pratis unctos sali ere per utres. Necnon Ausonij Troia gens missa coloni Versibus incomptis ludunt, risuque soluto; Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis, Et te Bacche vocant per carmina l aeti, tibique Oscilla ex alt a suspendunt mollia pinu. The second, thus. Plebs venit ac virides passim disjecta per herbas Potat, et accumbat cum pare quisque sua. Sub jove pars durat: pauci tentoria ponunt, Sunt quibus e ramis frondea facta casa est. Sole tamen vinoque calent; annosque pr aecantur Quot sumunt cyathos, ad numerumque bibunt. Invenies illic qui Nestoris ebibat annos; Qu ae sit per calices facta Sibylla suos. Illic et cantant quicquid dedicere theatris , Et jactant faciles ad sua verba manus. Et ducunt posito duras cratere choreas, Cultaque diffusis saltat amica comis. Cum redeunt, titubant, etsunt spectacula vulgi Et fortunatos obvia turba vocat, &c. Rusticus ad ludos populus veniebat in urbem Sed d is, non studijs, ille dabatur honos. Luce sua ludos uv ae commentor habebat Quos cum t aedifera nunc habet ille dea, &c. Ibunt semi-mares, et inania tympana tundet, Aeraque tinnitus aere repulsa dabunt. Scena sonat, ludique vocant, spectate Quirites Et fora marte suo litigiosa vacent. Annuimus votis; Consul nunc consule ludos, &c. Talia luduntur fumoso mense Decembri Qu ae jam non ulli composuisse nocet. The third, thus. Nunc mihi nunc fumo veteris proferre falernum Consulis et Chio solvere vincla cado. Vina diem celebrent, non festa luce madere Est rubor; errantes et mal e ferre pedes. Sed bene Messallam sua quisque ad pocula dicat; Numen et absentis singula verba sonant, &c. Agricola assiduo prim um satiatus aratro Cantavit certo rustica verba pede. Agricola et nimio suffusus Baccho rubenti Primus inexperto duxit ab arte choros &c. Whom Philo Iud aeus (writing of the Romans festivals) doth second in this manner. In omni festo nostro et celebritate qu ae miraemur, sunt haec: securitas, remissio, ebrietas, potatio, comessationes, deliciae, oblectamenta, patentes januae, pernoctationes, indecentes voluptates, insolentiae, exercitiu inteperantiae, insipientiae meditatio, studia turpitudinis, honestatis pernicies, nocturn ae excitationes ad cupiditates inexplebiles; somnus diurnus quando vigilandi tempus est, natur ae ordinis perversio; tunc virtus ridetur ut noxia, vitium tanquam utile rapitur: tunc in contemptu sunt quae oportet facere, quae vero non oportet in precio. Tunc philosophia, et omnis eruditio, divinae animae divina revera simulachra, tenent silentium: ac istae artes quae suis lenocinijs ventri, et his quae sub ventre sunt, voluptatem conciliant, ostendunt suam facundiam. Haec sunt festa istorum qui se faelices dicunt: quorum turpitudo quamdiu inter privatos parietes locaque prophana continetur, minus peccare mihi videntur: ubi vero torrentis in morem populans omnia, vel in sacratissima templa irrumpit, quicquid in his sanctum est sternit continuo, faciens prophana sacrificia, victimas absque litatione, praces irritas, prophana enim mysteria simul et orgya, pietatem sanctitatemque fucatam et adulterinam, castitatem impuram, veritatem falsatam, cultum Dei superstitiosum. Ad haec quidem corpora abluuntur lavacris et purificationibus, affectiones vero animae quibus vita sordidatur, nec volunt, nec curant eluere. Et ut candidati templa subeant dant operam, diligenter emaculatis vestibus amicti; mentem vero maculosissimam in ipsa sacraria penitissima inferre non verentur . A most accurate Character, both of our unruly Christmasses, and such Christmas-men. If wee now parallell our grand disorderly Christmasses, with these Roman Saturnals and heathen Festivals; or our New-yeares day (a chiefe part of Christmas) with their Festivity of Ianus , which was spent in Mummeries, Stage-playes, dancing, and such like Enterludes , wherein Fidlers and others acted lascivious effeminate parts, and went about their Towns and Cities in womens apparrell : Whence the whole Catholicke Church (as Alchuvinus, with others write) appointed a solemne publike fast upon this our New-yeares day , (which fast it seemes is now forgotten) to bewaile those heathenish Enterludes, sports, and lewd idolatrous practises which had beene used on it: prohibiting all Christians under paine of excommunication, from observing the Kalends or first of Ianuary (which wee now call New-yeares day) as holy, and from sending abroad New-yeares gifts upon it , (a custome now too frequent;) it being a meere relique of Paganisme and idolatry, derived from the heathen Romans feast of two-faced Ianus; and a practise so execrable unto Christians , that not onely the whole Catholicke Church; but even the 4 famous Councels of Alt[illeg.]siodorum and Towres; Capit. Gr aecarum Synodorum, here p. 581. & Concil. Constantinop: 6. here p. 583. St. Ambrose , Augustine , Asterius , HRabanus Maurus , Alcbuvinus , Gratian , Iuo Carnotensis , Isiodor Hispalensis , Pope Zachary , Pope Martin , Saint Chrysostome , Michael Lochmair , Ioannes Langhecrucius , Bochellus , Stephanus Costa , Francis de Croy , Polydor Virgil, Durandus , with sundry other, have positively prohibited the solemnization of New-yeares day, and and the sending abroad of New-yeares gifts, under an anathema & excommunication, as unbeseeming Christians, who should eternally abolish, not propagate, revive, or recontinue this pagan festivall, and heathenish ceremonie, which our God abhors . If wee compare (I say) our Bacchanalian Christmasses & New-yeares tides, with these Saturnalia and feasts of Ianus , we shall finde such neare affinitie betweene them both in regard of time, (they being both in the end of December, and on the first of Ianuary :) and in their manner of solemnizing; (both of them being spent in revelling, epicurisme, wantonesse, idlenesse, dancing, drinking, Stage-playes, Masques, and carnall pompe and jollity:) that wee must needes conclude the one to be but the very ape or issue of the other . Hence Polydor Virgil affirmes in expresse tearmes; that our Christmas Lords of misrule, (which custome , saith he, is chiefly observed in England,) together with dancing, Masques, Mummeries, Stage-playes, and such other Christmas disorders now in use with Christians, were derived from these Roman Saturnalia, and Bacchanalian festivals ; which should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate them. If any here demaund, by whom these Saturnalia, these disorderly Christmasses  & Stageplayes were first brought in amog the Christians? I answer, that the paganizing Priests and Monkes of popish C the same with heathen Rome ) were the chiefe Agents in this worke: who as they borrowed their Feast of All-Saints , from the heathen festivall Pantheon ; and the feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary , (which they have christned with the name of Candlemasse) from the festivall of the Goddesse Februa, the mother of Mars; to whom the Pagan Romans offered burning tapers, as the Papists in imitation of them now offer to the Virgin Mary on this day at evening : (answerable to which, are their ordinary burning Tapers on their idolized Altars, borrowed fro Saturne and those other Idol-Gods whose blindnes stood in need of those burning torches which the Pagans placed on their Altars ; they having eyes and yet not seeing : though our Saviour Christ ( the Sunne of righteousnesse , the light that lightens every one that commeth into the world , the Father and author of all light , the light of the heavenly Hierualem it selfe, which needes neither Sunne nor Moone, because he is the light thereof, and the light it selfe wherein is no darknesse,) needes no such Tapers , as Lactantius tells us.) So they have deduced (not the celebration of our Saviours Nativity in a Christian manner, which was ancient) but the riotous solemnizing of this sacred festivall, from these Pagan Saturnalia; which having baptized or new guilded over with this glorious pompous title, of Christ \- Masse , (a name I am sure of their owne imposing, not knowne to the ancient Fathers, as the Masse therein imports:) they transmitted it as a most sacred Relique or Tradition to dissolute posteritie: who are so farre besotted with its bacchanalian pastimes, Enterludes, and other heathenish disorders, that they have both lost their Saviour and themselves, whiles they thus celebrate his Nativitie; which in regard of those infernall prophanesses, of that licentious libertie of sinning which men now take unto themselves more than at other seasons , may more truly bee stiled Divels \- Masse , or Satvrnes \- Masse (for such too many make it ) than Christ-masse; there being farre more affinitie betweene the Divell, Saturne, Masse, and riotous Christmas-keeping, than betweene Christ and them: who as he never approved idolatrous sacrilegious pompous Masses, which rob him of his honour, worship, and all- sufficient sacrifice once for all : so he cannot but abhor these bachananalia paga Christmasses, which deprive him of his service, praises, love, and proclaime him an open patron of those notorious sinfull Christmas practises which hee doth most abhorre. When these disorderly extravagant kinde of Christmasses crept first into the Church, I cannot certainly determine, yet this I doe conjecture. After that Pope Boniface, and Pope Gregory the first, under pretence of drawing men from Paganisme to Christianity, had changed divers of the Pagan Festivalls into Christian: as Pantheon into All Saints; Februalia, Lupercalia, Proserpinalia and Palilia, into the Feast of Candlemasse. Quirinalia, into Innocents; the Feast of the Kalends of Ianuary, into our Saviours Circumcision or New-yeares day; these Saturnalia into our Saviours Nativitie; and the like : (contrary to the judgement of St. Ambrose, St. Augustine , the whole Councell of Affricke, and others, who wished all Pagan Festivals not changed into Christian, but quite abolished, the better to avoid all heathenish customes :) it came to passe, that the observation of these Pagan Festivalls, ( whose names they onely changed ) brought in all Pagan rites and ceremonies that the idolatrous heathens used, (as drunkennes, health-quaffing, wantonnesse, luxurie, dancing, dicing, Stage-playes, Masques with all other Ethnicke sports) into the Church of God ; (which was never defiled with these prophane abominations, till these Pagan holy-dayes were metamorphosed into Christian;) which by reason of mens naturall pronesse unto evill, did soone transforme all Christian Festiualls into Pagan, as good Authors witnesse : partly through the peoples strong propensity to carnall pleasures, to heathenish rites and ceremonies to which they naturally adhere ; but principally through the intollerable luxurie and voluptuousnesse of the Popish Clergie ; whose excessive endowments power, pride, and lordly pompe drew them on by little and little to that stupendious Epicurisme and dissolutenesse of life, that to stop the peoples mouthes, and to palliate, if not authorize these their luxurious courses, they not onely stuffed their Kalenders with new-invented Festivals and Saints dayes; but likewise countenanced all Pagan sports and customes on them, exhibiting publike banquets, Enterludes, Mummeries, Dances, and merriments to the people ; who being bribed with their belly-cheare, and soothed with their pleapleasures, applauded them for the present , and then fell to imitate them for the future ; till at last all Christendome was over-runne , yea all life, all power of Christianitie quite eaten out with these Pagan Christmas pastimes and delights of sin . That the Popish Clergy (whose extravagancies and most intollerable luxurie in this kinde, many Councels and Authors have declaimed against at larg ) were the chiefest instruments of ushering in these Pagan Christmasses, together with Stage-playes, dances, and such like bacchanalian practises into the Church of Christ, it is most apparant, not onely by those Councels and Authors which crie out against them , for their strange unparalleld excesses in all these kindes; and by that elegant oration of King Edgar to our English Pr aelates, worthy to be registred in golden Characters, where he thus displayes the Epicurian lives of the Clergy in his raigne: Taceo, quod Clericis nec est corona patens, nec tonsura conveniens; quod in veste lascivia, insolentia in gestu, in verbis turpitudo, interioris hominis loquuntur insaniam. Pr aetera in divinis officijs quanta negligentia, cum sacris vigilijs vix interesse dignentur, cum ad sacra Missarum solennia ad ludendum vel ad ridendum magis quam ad psallendum congregari videantur. Dicam, dicam quod boni lugent, mali rident, dicam dolens (si tamen dici potest) quomodo diffluant in commessationibus, in ebrietatibus, in cubilibus, in impudicitijs, ut jam domus Clericorum putentur prostibula meretricum, et conciliabula histrionum. Ibi alea, ibi saltus et cantus, ibi usque in medium noctis spatium protractae in clamore et horrore vigiliae : (the chiefe ingredients of our exorbitant Christmasses.) Sic, sic patromonia regum, eleemosyn ae pauperum, imo (quod magis est) illius pretiosi sanguinis pretium profligatur. Ad hoc igitur exhauserunt thesauros suos patres nostri, ad hoc fiscus Regius, distractis redditibus multis, detumuit, ad hoc Ecclesijs Christi agros et possessiones Regalis munificentia contulit, ut delicijs Clericorum meretrices ornantur, luxuriosa convivia praeparentur, canes et aves ettalia ludicra comparentur? Hoc milites clamant, plebs submurmurat, mimi cantant et saltant, et vos negligitis! vos parcitis! vos dissimulatis! &c . But likewise by sundry forequoted Councels, and canonicall Constitutions ; by which it appeares most evidently; that divers of the Popish Clergie were common Iesters, Actors, Dicers, Dancers, Epicures, Drunkards, Health- quaffers; that they both acted & caused Playes and Enterludes to be personated both in Churches & elswhere, especially on the feasts of Innocents, New-yeares day, and the Christmas holy-dayes; the commonnesse of which abuses, was the onely cause of those severall Canons and Constitutions to suppresse them , on which you may reflect. Hence Aventine records of Pope Boniface the 8. that he made and brought in secular sports and Enterludes, endeavouring to reduce the golden age: and of Pope Nicholas the 5. that he instituted secular Playes at Rome, contrary to the Councell of Constans; and that 560 persons were crushed to death, and drowned with the fall of the Tiberine bridge, who flocked to Rome to behold those Enterludes . Hence Polydor Virgil , Lodovicus Vives , Ioannes Langhecrucius, and Didacus de Tapia, cry out against the popish Clergie, for acting and representing to the people, the passion of our Saviour, the Histories of Iob, Mary Magdalen, Iohn the Baptist, and other sacred Stories; together with the lives and legions of their Saints; and for erecting Theaters for this purpose in their Churches, on which their Priests and Monkes, together with common Enterlude-Players, and other Laickes did personate these their Playes . Which grosse prophanesse though thus declaimed against by many of their own Authors , & condemned by their Conncels , is yet still in use among them, as not onely Didacus de Tapia, and others who much lament it , but even daily experience  & the Iesuites practise, together with Iohn Molanus , Divinity-professor of Lovan , witnesse: who in his Historia SS. Imaginum & Picturarum Antwerpiae 1617\. lib. 4. cap. 18. De Ludis qui speciem quandam Imaginum habent, in quibusdam anni solennitatibus, p. 424, 425, 426, 427 . out of Conradus Bruno , and Lindanus , writes thus in justification of these their Enterludes. Now even Stage-playes have a certaine shape of Images; and oft times move the pious affections of Christians, more than prayer it selfe. And after this manner truly Stage playes and shewes are wont to be exhibited on certaine times of the yeare, the certaine pictures of certaine Evangelicall histories being annexed to them. Of which sort is this, that on Palm-sunday children having brought in the picture of our Saviour, sitting upon an Asse, sing praise to the Lord, cast bowes of trees on the ground, and spread their garments on the way. And that likewise upon Easter Eve, when as the presbyter after midnight receiving the image of the crucifixe out of the sepulcher, goeth round about the Church, and beates the doores of it that are shut, saying , Lift up your gates yee princes, and bee yee lifted up yee everlasting gates, that the King of glory may come in: and he who watcheth in the gates demanding, Who is this King of glory? the Presbyter answers againe , The Lord strong and mighty in battaile; the Lord of hoasts he is the King of glory. Likewise, that on the day of the resurrection of our Lord in the morning after morning prayers, Angels in white garments, sitting upon the sepulcher, aske the women comming thither and weeping, saying; Whom seeke ye women in this tumult, weeping ? he is not here whom ye seeke: but goe ye quickly, and tell his Disciples; Come and see the place where the Lord lay. And that on the same day the image of our Lord, bearing an ensigne of Victorie, is carried about in publike procession, and placed upon the altar to be gazed upon by the people. Likewise that of Ascention day in the sight of all the people, the Image of the Lord is pulled up in the midst of the Church, and shewed to be taken up into heaven. In the meane time about the Image are little winged images of Angels, carrying burning tapers in their hands, and fluttering up and downe, and a Priest singing ; I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and the Clergy singing after him , and unto my God and your God: with this solemne hymne, Now is a solemne &c. and this Responsory : Goe ye into the world &c. And that upon Whitesunday, the image of a dove is let downe from aboue in the midst of the Church, and presently a fire falls downe together with it with some sound, much like the noyse of guns, the Priest singing , Receive ye the holy Ghost  &c. and the Clergy rechanting ; There appeared cloven tongues to the Apostles, & c. By all which and other such like spectacles, and those especially which represent the passion of our Lord, nothing else is done, but that the sacred histories may be represented by these exhibited Spectacles and Enterludes to those who by reason of their ignorance cannot reade them. And these things hitherto out of Conradus Bruno in his Booke of Images, cap. 17. Thou hast the like defence of these shewes and Enterludes in William Lindane the reverend Bishop of Ruremond in his Apologie to the Germans, where among other things he saith: For what other are these Spectacles and Playes than the living histories of Lay-men? with which the humane affection is much more efficaciously moved, than if they should reade the same in private, or heare the publikely read by others &c . Thus he. O the desperate madnesse, the unparalleld profanes of these audacious Popish Priests & Papists, who dare turne the whole history of our Saviours life, death, Nativitie, Passion, Resurrection, Ascention, and the very gift of the holy Ghost descending in cloven tongues, into a meere prophane ridiculous Stage-play; (as even their owne impious Pope Pius the 2\. most prophanely did:) contrary to the forequoted resolutions of sundry Councels and Fathers, who would have these things onely preached to the people, not acted, not represented in a shew or Stage-play . No wonder then if such turne the sacred solemnity of our Saviours Incarnation into a Pagan Saturnal, or Bacchanalian feast; who thus transforme his humiliation, his exaltation, yea his whole worke of our redemption into a childish Play. But let these Playerlike Priests and Friers, who justifie this prophanesse, which every Christian heart that hath any sparke of grace must needes abominate, attend unto their learned Spanish Hermite, Didacus de Tapia , who reades this Lecture both to them and us. That this verily is altogether intollerable, that the life of Iob, of St. Francis, of Mary Magdalen , (how much more then of Christ himselfe) should be acted on the Stage. For since the very manner and custome of Play-houses is prophane, it is lesse evill (if it were tollerable) that prophane things onely should be acted, and that holy things be handled onely in a holy manner &c. But now that a Theatre , A Place So Familiar To Divels, And So Odiovs Vnto God (pray marke it) should be set up in the very middest of the body of the Church, before the high Altar and the most holy Sacrament, for Playes to be acted on it, he onely can brooke it, who by reason of his sins hath not yet knowne or felt , Hovv Crosse And Opposite These Things Are To The Holines Of God . It is evident then by all these premises, that our riotous, ludicrous  & voluptuous Christmasses , (together with Stage-playes, dancing, Masques and such like Pagan sports) had their originall from Pagan, their revivall and continuance from Popish Rome , who long since transmitted them over into England: For if Polydor Virgil may be credited, even in the 13. yeare of Henry the second, Anno Dom. 1270. it was the custome of the English to spend their Christmas time in Playes, in Masques, in most magnificent and pompous Spectacles, and to addict themselves to pleasures, dancing, dicing, and other unlawfull prohibited games, which then were tolerated and permitted; contrary to the usage of most other Nations, who used such Playes and wanton pastimes not in the Christmas season, but a little before their Lent, about the time of Shrovetide . What therefore Salvian writes of Sodomie and publike stewes, (from which the Popes Exchequer receives no small revenue ) Hac ergo impuritas in Romanis et ante Christi Evangelium esse c aepit: et quod est gravius, nec post Evangelium cessavit : the same may I say of Stage-playes and unruly Christmas-keeping: they had their first originall from heathen Rome (I meane from their Saturnalia, Bacchanalia, Floralia &c .) before the Gospell preached to her; and they have beene since revived, continued, propagated by Antichristian Rome, even since the Gospell preached : which should cause all pious Protestant Christians eternally to abandon them, conforming themselves to the most ancient practise of the primitive Christians, who celebrated this festivall of our Saviours Nativitie in a farre different manner. For when as the Angel of the Lord appeared to the shepheards, abiding in the fields , (not feasting and playing in their houses) and keeping watch over their flockes (not dancing, dicing, carding, drinking or keeping Christmas rout) by night; and said unto them; feare not: for behold I bring unto you tidings of great joy which shall be to all people: for to you is borne this day in the City of David, a Saviour which is Christ the Lord : What Christmas mirth and solace was there made, but this which St. Luke hath recorded for our everlasting imitation? Sodainly (saith hee) there was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly hoast praising God and saying; Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will towards men . This is the onely Christmas solemnity which the holie Ghost, which Christ himselfe, the whole multitude of the heavenly hoast, and the very best of Christians have commended to us from heaven; this I am sure is the ancientest and the best patterne of Christmas-keeping, that we reade of ; why then should we be unwilling or ashamed for to imitate it? When our Saviour was borne into the world at first, we heare of no feasting, drinking, healthing, roaroaring, carding, dicing, Stage-playes, Mummeries, Masques or heathenish Christmas pastimes; alas these precise puritanicall Angels, Saints and shepheards (as some I feare account them) knew no such pompous pagan Christmas Courtships or solennities, which the Divell and his accursed instruments have since appropriated to his most blessed Nativitie. Here we have nothing but Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men : this is the Angels, the shepheards only Christmas Caroll: which the Virgin Mary in the former chapter, hath prefaced with this celestiall hymne of prayse. My soule doth magnifie the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour : and Zacharias seconded with this heavenly sonnet: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people: And hath raised up an horne of salvation for us in the house of his servant David . This was the only sport and merriment, these the soule-ravishing Ditties, with which men and Angels celebrated the very first Christmas that was kept on earth; yea this is the onely Christmas solemnity that the blessed Saints and Angels now obserue in heaven : why then should we so earnestly contend for any other? If we reflect upon the Christians in Tertullians , Clemens Alexandrinus , Philo Iud aeus , Minucius Felix , Plinie the seconds , Chrysostomes , and Theodorets times: wee shall finde them banishing all gluttony , drunkennesse, health-quaffing, intemperance, dancing, dicing, Stage-playes, fidlers, jesters, ribaldrie songs and lewd discourses from their feasts, and Christian Festivals ; which they celebrated in this manner. First of all they assembled themselves together into one companie, that so they might as it were assault and besiege God with their united prayers : after that they did feed their faith, erect their hope, settle their confidence, inculcate their discipline with the Scriptures and holy conferences, and with the often repetitions of divine precepts, using withall exhortations, corrections and ecclesiasticall censures: which being ended they kept their Agape, or feasts of Love, wherein no immodesty was admitted; at which feasts they never sate downe to eate, till they had first pr aemised a solemne prayer unto God: and then falling to their meat, they did eate no more than would satisfie their hunger, and drinke no more than was fit for chast persons: satiating themselves so, as that they remembred they were to worship God in the night: discoursing like such who knew full well that God overheard them. After the bason and ewer and lights were brought in, every one as he was able, was provoked to sing a psalme unto God out of the holy Scriptures, or out of his owne invention: and by this it was manifested how he had drunke. And as prayer began , so it likewise concluded their feasts; after which every one departed, not into the routs of roaring swashbucklers, nor yet into the company of riotous ramblers, nor into the lashings out of lascivious persons; but to the same care of modesty and chastitie, like those who had not so much repasted a supper as discipline . Yea such was the puritanicall rigidnesse of the primitive Christians on the solemne birth-dayes and Inaugurations of the Roman Emperors, when as other men kept revel-rout, feasting and drinking from parish to parish, making the whole Cittie to smell like a taverne, kindling bonefires in every street, and running by troopes to Playes, to impudent prankes, to the enticements of lust &c. accounting their licentious deboistnesse at such seasons their chiefest piety and devotion , (as our Grand Christmas keepers now doe:) that they would neither shadow nor adorne their doores with laurell; nor diminish the day-light with bonefires and torches, nor yet drinke, nor dance, nor runne to Play-houses, which they wholly abandoned; but kept themselves temperate, sober, chast and pious ; celebrating their solemnities, rather with conscience and devotion than lasciviousnesse ; whence they were reputed publike enemies, as Tertullian , Philo Iud aeus , and Clemens Alexandrinus most plentifully informe us. Hence Theodoret writes, That the Christians of his time, instead of solemnizing the festivals of Iove and Bacchus, did celebrate the festivities of Peter, Paul, Thomas, Sergius, Marcellus, Leontius, Antoninus, and other holy Martyrs; and that instead of that ancient pompe, that filthy obscenity and impudency that the Pagans used on their festivals, the Christians instituted holy-dayes full of modesty, chastity and temperance: not such as were moistned with wine, lascivious with riotous feasts, dissolute with shoutes and laughter; but such as resounded with divine songs, as were spent in hearing holy Sermons, on which prayers were humbly powred out to God not without teares and sighes . Thus did the primitive Christians spend their solemne holy-dayes; and so should we doe too, as our owne Statute of 5. & 6\. Ed. 6.c.3 . expresly enjoynes us. How the primitive Christians celebrated the Nativitie of our Saviour in particular, and in what manner we also ought to solemnize it, let Gregory Nazianzen in his 38 Oration upon our Saviours Nativity , now at last informe us; where thus hee writes: Hoc festum nostrum est , (treating of our Saviours Nativitie) Hoc hodierno die celebramus, Dei nimirum ad homines accessum, ut ad Deum proficiscamur, aut, ut aptiori verbo utar, revertamur, abjectoq; veteri homine novum induamus; et quemadmodum in veteri Adamo mortui sumus, ita in Christo vivamus, un a cum eo nascentes, una crucifixi, una sepulti, una resurgentes. Praeclara enim vicissitudo atque conversio mihi sentienda est, ut quemadmodum ex secundioribus rebus adversae natae sunt, sic contra ex adversis ad laeta prosperaq; redeam. Vbi enim abundavit peccatum, superabundavit gratia: et si gustus condemnavit, quanto magis Christi passio justificavit? Quocirca non ostentorie, sed divine; non mundi ritu, sed supra mundi ritum; non res nostras sed nostri, vel ut rectius loquar, Domini; non ea quae infirmitatis sunt, sedquae curationis; non ea quae creationis, sed ea quae recreationis instaurationisque celebremus. Id autem hac demum ratione consequemur, si nec domus limina sertis coronemus , nec choreas agetemus, nec vicos ornemus, nec oculum pascamus, nec aurem cantu demulceamus, nec lenocinijs gustum titillemus, nec olfactum eff aeminemus, nec tactui obsequamur, promptis inquam illis ad vitium vijs, peccatique januis, nec teneris et circumfluentibus vestibus emolliamur, quarum ut qu aeque pulcherrima, ita maxime inutilis jacet, nec gemmarum splendoribus nec auri fulgoribus, nec colorum artificijs nativam pulchritudinem ementientibus, atque adversus imaginem divinam excogitatis , nec commessationibus et ebrietatibus, quas cubilia et lascivi ae comitantur, quandoquidem malorum magistrorum mala doctrinae est, vel potius malorum seminum mala seges. Nec thoros altos servamus, ventri delicias sternentes: nec vina generosa, coquorum lenocinia, liquorum profusas magnificentias in precio habeamus. Nec terrae et mare charum nobis ac preciosum stercus offerant: hoc enim nomine delicias ornare soleo. Nec alius alium intemperantia superare contendamus. Mihi enim intemperantia est quicquid superfluum est, usibusque necessarijs superest, idque esurientibus alijs atque inopia laborantibus; ijs inquam, qui ex codem luto et temperatione creati sunt. Verum haec prophanis atque ethnico fastui solennitatibusque relinquamus: qui cum ijs deorum nomen tribuant, qui sacrificiorum nidore oblectantur, congruentur profecto eos helluando colunt, mali utique malorum daemonum et fictores et sacerdotes et cultores. At nos a quibus Verbum adoratur, verborum delicijs (si quid tamen delicijs dandum est) indulgeamus, atque ex lege divina et narrationibus, cum alijs, tum ijs praesertim, quibus praesentis festi mysteria explicantur, voluptatem capiamus. Ita enim commodae, minimeque ab eo, a quo convocati sumus, alienae deliciae nostrae fuerint . Which thus he seconds, in his 48 Oration against Iulian. Ac primum quidem fratres l aetemur non corporis splendore, non vestium permutationibus et magnificentijs, non commessationibus et ebrietatibus, quarum fructum cubilia et impudicitias esse didicistis: nec floribus plateas coronemus, nec unguentorum turpitudine mensas, nec vestibula ornemus, nec visibili lumine splendescat domus, nec tibicinum concentu plausibusque personent: hic enim Gentiliti ae festorum celebrationis mos est. Nos vero ne his rebus Deum honoremus, ne pr aesens tempus indignis rebus attollamus; verum animae puritate, et mentis hilaritate, et lucernis totum Ecclesiae corpus illustrantibus, hoc est divinis speculationibus et sententijs super sacrosanctum candelabrum erectis, et excitatis, orbique universo praelucentibus. Parvum meo quidem judicio ac tenue, si cum hoc comparetur, lumen illud omne est, quod homines festos dies celebrantes privatim publiceque accendunt, &c. Hymons pro tympanis assumamus, psalmodiam pro turpibus et flagitiosis cantibus, plausum gratiarum actionis et canoram manuum actionem pro plausibus theatricis, gravitatem pro risu, prudente sermonem pro ebrietate, decus et honestatem pro delicijs. Quod si etiam te ut festum laeto animo celebrantem, tripudiare convenit; tripudia tu quidem, sed non obscenae Herodiadis tripudium, ex quo Baptist ae mors secuta est, verum Davidis ob arca ae requietem saltitantis, quo quidem itineris sancti ac Deo grati agilitatem volubilitatemque mystice designari existimo . These are the Christmas exercises, this the only Christmas-keeping, that all the primitive Christians used, and this godly Bishop calls for. To passe by that excellent passage of Salvian , against our Christmas Enterludes, which fully meetes with the Objectors frenzie: Christo ergo o amentia monstruosa, Christo Circenses offerimus et Mimos, tunc et hoc maxime, cum ab eo aliquid boni capimus, cum prosperitatis aliquid ab eo attribuitur, aut victoriae de hostibus a divinitate donatur? Et quid aliud hac re facere videmur, quam si quis homini beneficium largienti injuriosus sit, aut blandientem convitijs caedat, aut osculatis vultum mucrone transigat, &c . which I have formerly englished. As also to pretermit St. Cyprian , St. Augustine , Leo , Bernard , with sundry other Fathers , who have written of our Saviours Nativitie, how it ought to be celebrated with the greatest holinesse, sobriety, and chiefest devotion; I shall relate the summe of all their Mindes in the words of St. Ambrose , who is somewhat copious in this theame. Sermo 2. Dominica 1. Adventus , he writes thus. Hoc tempus, fratres charissimi, non immerito Domini adventus vocatur, nec sine causa sancti Patres adventum Domini celebrare c aeperunt, et sermones de his diebus ad populum habuerunt, id namque ideo instituerunt, ut se unusquisque fidelis praepararet et emendaret, quo digne Dei ac Domini sui Nativitatem celebrare valeret. Nam si aliquis vestrum seniorem suum in ejus domum suscepturus, ab omnibus sordibus et immundis rebus ipsam domum mundaret, et qu aeque honesta et necessaria essent, secundum suam possibilitatem praepararet; et hoc facit mortalis suscepturus mortalem; quanto magis se mundare debet creatura, ut suo creatori apparenti in carne non displiceat: Ille justus venit ad nos peccatores, ut ex peccatoribus faceret justos: pius venit ad impios, ut nos faceret pios: humilis venit ad superbos, ut ex superbis faceret humiles. Quid plura? ille natura bonus venit ad homines qui erant pleni omnibus malis. Quapropter hortamur vos, ut his diebus abundantius eleemosynas faciatis; ad Ecclesiam frequentius conveniatis, confessionem peccatorum vestrorum purissime faciatis, et ab omni immunditia vos studiosissime contineatis. Odium nihilominus, iram, et indignationem, clamorem et blasphemiam, superbiam atque jactantiam cum omni carnali delectatione procul a vobis repellatis: ut cum dies Dominicae Nativitatis advenerit, salubriter ipsum celebrare possitis. Et sicut multi sunt soliciti de carnalibus divitijs, et de preciosis vestimentis, ut honorabiliores caeteris videantur in illa die; ita vos solicitiores estote de spiritualibus divitijs et vestimentis: quia sicut anima melior est carne, ita deliciae spiritales meliores sunt quam carnales. Et multo melius est animam ornare virtutibus, quam corpus preciosis induere vestibus. Haec admonitio Fratres, idcirco ad vos facta est, ut qui boni sunt per hanc sint meliores; et qui malos se esse recolunt, certissime convertantur; ut pariter in die Dominicae Nativitatis laetari spiritaliter mereatur . Which he thus prosecuts in his 4. Ser. Dominica 2. Adventus. L aetitia quanta sit, quantusq; concursus, cum Imperatoris mundi istius natalis celebrandus est, bene nostis quemadmodum duces eius et principes omnes militantes accurate sericis vestibus accincti, operosis cingulis auro fulgente pretiosis ambiant solito nitidius in conspectu regis incedere. Credunt enim maius esse Imperatoris gaudium, si viderit majorem suae apparationis ornatum; tantoque illum laetum futurum, quanto ipsi fuerint in ejus festivitate devoti; ut quia Imperator tanquam homo corda non conspicit, affectum eorum circa se probet vel habitum contuendo, ita fit ut splendidius se accuret quisquis regem fidelius diligit. Deinde quia in die Natalis sui sciunt eum largum futurum ac donaturum plura vel ministris suis, velijs qui in domo ejus abjecti putantur et viles, tanta prius thesauros ejus replere divitiarum varietate festinant, ut in quantum prorogare voluerit, in tantum prorogatio copiosa non desit, et ante voluntas donandi deficiat, quam substantia largiendi. Haec autem ideo solicite faciunt, quia majorem sibi remunerationem pro hac solicitudine sperant futuram. Si ergo fratres saeculae istius homines propter praesentis honoris gloriam terrens regis sui natalem diem tanta apparitione suscipiunt, qua nos accuratione aeterni regis nostri Iesu Christi Natalem suscipere debemus? qui pro devotione nostra non nobis temporalem largietur gloriam, sed aeternam; nec terreni honoris administrationem dabit quae successore finitur, sed caelestis imperij dignitate, quae non habet successore. Qualis aute nostra remuneratio sit futura, dicit Propheta. Quae oculus non vidit, nec auris audivit, nec in cor hominis ascendit, quae praeparavit Deus diligentibus se. Quibus indumentis nos exornari oportet? Quod autem diximus nos, hoc est animas nostras: quia rex noster Christus non tam nitorem vestium, quam animarum requirit affectum, nec inspicit ornamenta corporum, sed considerat corda meritorum: nec fragilis cinguli pr aecingentis lumbos operositatem miratur, sed fortis castimoni ae restringentis libidinem ad pudicitiam plus miratur. Ambiamus ergo inveniri apud ipsum probati fide, compti misericordia, moribus accurati; et qui fidelius Christum diligit, nitidius se mandatorum ejus observatione componat: ut vere nos in se credere videat, cum ita in ejus solennitate fulgemus, et magis laetus sit, quo nos perspexerit puriores. Atque ideo ante complures dies castificemus corda nostra, mundemus conscientiam, purificemus spiritum, et nitidi ac sine macula immaculati Domini suscipiamus adventum: ut cujus nativitas per immaculatam virginem constitit, ejus Natalis per immaculatos servulos procuretur. Quisquis enim in illo die sordidus fuerit ac pollutus, Natalem Christi ortumq; non curat: intersit licet Dominica festivitati corpore, mente tamen longius a Servatore separatur. Nec societatem habere poterunt immundus et sanctus, avarus et misericors, corruptus ac virgo; nisi quod magis ingerendo se indignus offensione contrahit cu minime se cognoscit. Dum enim vult officiosus esse, injuriosus existit: sicut ille in Evangelio, qui in caetu sanctoru invitatus ad nuptias venire ausus est vestem non habens nuptialem: et c um alius niteret justitia, alius luceret fide, alius castitate fulgeret, ille solus conscientiae faeditate pollutus, cunctis splendentibus deformi horrore sordebat. Et quanto plus simul discumbentium beatorum candebat sanctitas, tanto magis peccatorum illius apparebat improbitas, qui poterat minus displicuisse forsitan, si in consortium justorum minime se dedisset. Igitur fratres suscepturi Natalem Domini, ab omni nos delictorum faece purgemus, repleamus thesaurum ejus diversorum munerum donis, ut in die sancta sit unde peregrini accipiant, reficiantur viduae, pauperes vestiantur, &c. Supervenientem festivitatem ejus omni ambitione retinere debemus: Retinere, inquam, ut si dies solennitatis transeat, apud nos sanctificationis ejus beatitudo permaneat. H aec enim gratia Natalis est Domini Salvatoris, ut in futuru ad pr aedestinatos transeat, in praeteritum remaneat ad devotos. Oportet ergo esse nos sanctitate puros, mundos pudiciti ae, nitidos honestate, ut quo diem festu advenire propinquius cernimus, eo accuratius incedamus. Si enim mulierculae solent aliquas ferias suscepturae, maculas vestium suarum aqua diluere: cur non magis nos accepturi Natalem Domini, maculas animaru nostrarum fletibus abluamus ? Vnusquisq; ergo quicquid in se reprehensibile recognoscit, in hac die in qu ae Filius Dei nascitur, corrigat: id est, qui fuit adulter, voveat Deo castitatem: qui avarus, largitatem: qui ebriosus, sobrietatem; qui superbus, humilitatem: qui detractor, charitatem voveat et reddat: secundum illum Psalmi versiculum : Vovete, et reddite Domino Deo vestro. Nos fideliter voveamus, ille dabit possibilitatem solvendi. Valde quippe honestum est fratres, ut nullus sit qui non hodi e domino aliquid offerat. Regibus vel amicis susceptis munera damus, et creatori omnium ad nos venienti nihil dabimus? Nihil enim a nobis magis requirit, quam nosmetipsos. Offeramus igitur ei nos ipsos, quatenus et a praesentibus malis, et ab aeternis cruciatibus, ipsius ineffabili pietate liberati, in caelestis regni beatitudine suscepti perpetuo valeamus gaudere. And Sermo 6. Dominica quarta Adventus: he proceedes thus . Propria divinitate fratres dilectissimi, jam adveniunt dies, in quibus Natalem Domini Servatoris cum gaudio desideramus celebrare, et ideo rogo et admoneo, ut quantum possumus cum Dei adjutorio laboremus, quatenus in illo die cum sincera et pura conscientia, et mundo corde et casto corpore, ad altare Domini possimus accedere, et corpus, vel etiam sanguinem ejus non ad judicium, sed ad remedium anim ae nostrae mereamur accipere: In Christi enim corpore vita nostra consistit, sicut et ipse Dominus noster dixit : Nisi manducaveritis carne Filii hominis et biberitis ejus sanguinem, non habetis vitam in vobis. Mutet ergo vita, qui vult accipere vita. Na si non mutat vitam, adjudicium accipiet vitam, et magis ex ipsa corrumpitur, quam sanetur; magis occiditur, qu am vivificetur. Sic enim dixit Apostolus : Qui manducat corpus Domini, et bibit sanguinem ejus indigne, judicium sibi manducat et bibit. Et ideo licet omni tempore bonis operibus ornatos ac splendidos esse conveniat, pr aecipue tamen in die Natalis Domini, sicut in Evangelio ipse dixit , ut lucere debeant opera nostra coram hominibus. Considerate qu aeso fratres, quando aliquis homo potens aut nobilis natalem aut suum aut filij sui celebrare desiderat, quanto studio ante plures dies quicquid in domo suo sordidum viderit ordinat emundare, quicquid ineptum et incongruum projicit, quicquid utile et necessarium praecipit exhibere: domus etiam si obscura fuerit, dealbatur, et diversis respersa floribus adornatur: pavimenta autem a scopis mundantur, quicquid etiam ad laetitiam animi, et corporis delicias pertinet omni sollicitudine providetur. Vt quid ista fratres charissimi nisi ut dies natalicius cum gaudio celebretur hominis morituri? Si ergo tanta praeparas in natalicio tuo, aut filij tui; quanta praeparare debes suscepturus Natalem Domini tui? Si talia praeparas morituro, qualia praeparare debes aeterno? Quicquid ergo non vis inveniri in domo tua quantum potes labora ut non inveniat Deus in anima tua. Certe si Rex terrenus aut quivis potens paterfamilias ad suum natalicium te invitasset, qualibus vestimentis studeres ornatus incedere? quam novis vel nitidis, quam splendidis, quo nec vetustas, nec vilitas, nec aliqua faeditas oculos invitantis offenderet? Tal iergo studio, in quantum praevales Christo auxiliante contende, ut diversis virtutum ornamentis animam tuam compositam, simplicitatis gemmis, et sobrietatis floribus adornatam, ad solennitatem regis aeterni, id est, ad Natalem Domini Salvatoris, cum secura conscientia procedas, castitate nitida, charitate splendida, eleemosynis candida. Christus enim Dominus noster si te ita compositum ejus natalitium celebrare cognoverit, ipse per se venire, et animam tuam non solum visitare, sed etiam in ea requiescere, et in perpetuum in illa dignabitur habitare, sicut scriptum est : Et inhabitabo in illis et inambulabo inter eos: Et iterum , Ecce sto ad ostium et pulso; si quis surrexerit et aperuerit mihi, intrabo ad illum, et c aenabo cum illo, et ille mecum. Qu am faelix est illa anima qui vitam suam ita Deo auxiliante studuerit gubernare, ut Christum hospitem inhabitatorem mereatur excipere. Sicut e contrario quam infaelix est illa conscientia, toto lachrymarum fonte lugenda, quaese ita malis operibus cruentavit, ut in ea non Christus requiescere, sed diabolus incipiat dominari. Talis enim anima si medicamentum paenitentiae non cito subvenerit, a luce relinquetur, a tenebris occupabitur, vacuabitur dulcedine, replebitur amaritudine; a morte invadetur, a vitae repudiabitur. Ideo etiam ab omni inquinamento ante Christi Natalem multis diebus abstinere debemus. Quotiescunque Fratres aut Natalem Domini, aut reliquas solennitates celebrare disponitis , ebrietatem ante omnia fugite, iracundi ae quasi bestiae crudelissima repugnate, odium velut venenum mortiferum de corde vestro repellite, et tanta in vobis sit charitas, quae non solum ad amicos, sed etiam usque ad ipsos perveniat inimicos, &c. And in his Sermo 11. in Die Circumcisionis Domini nostri Iesu Christi; as if he had purposely written against our moderne Christmas disorders; he concludes thus. Est mihi adversus plerosque vestrum fratres, querela non modica, de his loquor, qui nobiscum Natalem Domini celebrantes, Gentilium se ferijs dediderunt, et post illud c aeleste conviviu superstitionis sibi prandium paraverunt; ut qui ante late laetificati fuerant sanctitate, inebriarentur postea vanitate; ignorantes, quod qui vult regnare cum Christo, non possit gaudere cum saeculo: et qui vult invenire justitiam, debet declinare luxuriam. Alia est enim ratio vitae aeterna, alia desperatio lasciviae temporalis. Ad illam virtute ascenditur, ad istam perditione descenditur. Atque ideo qui vult esse divinorum particeps, non debet esse socius idoloru. Idoli enim portio est inebriare vino mentem, ventrem cibo distendere, saltationibus membra torquere, et ita pravis actionibus occupari, ut cogaris ignorare quod Deus est. Vnde sanctus Apostolus hac pr aevidens dicit : Qu ae portio justitiae cum iniquitate? aut quae societas luci cum tenebris? aut quae pars fidelis cum infideli? qui autem consensus templo Dei cum idolis? Ergo si nos sumus templum Dei, cur in templo Dei cobitur festivitas idolorum? Cur ubi Christus habitat, qui est abstinentia, temperantia, castitas, inducitur commessatio, ebrietas atque lascivia? Dicit Salvator , Nemo potest duobus Dominis servire; hoc est, Deo et Mammon ae. Quomodo igitur potestis religiose Epiphaniam Domini procurare, qui jam Kalendas quantum in vobis est, devotissime celebrastis? Ianus enim homo fuit unius conditor civitatis, quae Ianiculum nuncupatur, in cujus honorem a gentibus Kalendae sunt Ianuariae nuncupatae: unde qui Kalendas Ianuarias colit, peccat, quoniam homini mortuo defert divinitatis obsequium. Inde est quod ait Apostolus : Dies observatis, et menses, et tempora, et annos, timeo ne sine causa laboravero in vobis. Observavit enim diem et mensem qui his diebus aut jejunavit, aut ad Ecclesiam non processit. Observavit diem qui hesterno die non processit ad Ecclesiam, processit ad campum. Ergo Fratres omni studio Gentilium festivitatem et farias declinemus, ut quando illi epulantur et l aeisunt, tunc nos simus sobrij atque jejuni, quo intelligant laetitiam suam nostra abstinentia condemnari. Illi habeant mare in theatro, nos habeamus portume in Christo. If then our Saviours Nativitie ought thus to be celebrated by us; if all drunkennesse , epicurisme, health-quaffing , dancing dicing, Enterludes, playes, lasciviousnesse, pride and pagan customes must now be laid aside; if all kinde of sinne and wickdnesse whatsoever must now be banished our bodies, soules, and houses; if our soules must now especially be cleansed by repentance from all their spirituall filthinesse, adorned, beautified with every Christian grace and made such holy spiritual Temples, that Christ the King of glory may come and dwell within them : if nought but holinesse , temperance, sobriety and devotion must now be found within us, yea, if fasting and abstinence must now be practised, as all these Fathers teach us, let us now at last for very shame abandon all those bacchanalian infernall Christmas disorders, Enterludes, sports and pastimes which now overspread the world, as diametrally contrary not onely to Christians, but to our Saviours Nativitie, which they most desperately dishonour and prophane . And if there be any such deboist ones left among us (as alas there are too too many every where) who will still support and pleade for these abominable Christmas excesses, not onely in despite of God , of Christ , of Angels, Fathers , Councels , and godly Christians who condemne the, but even of our owne pious Statute, viz. 5. & 6\. Ed.6.cap.3 . Which expresly enjoynes men, even in the Christmas holy- dayes , as well as others; to cease from all other kinde of labour, and to apply themselves Onely And Wholly to laud and praise the Lord, to resort and heare Gods word, to come to the holy communion, to hear, to learne and to remember almighty Gods great benefits, his manifold mercies, his inestimable gracious goodnesse so plentifully powred upon all his creatures, and that of his infinite and unspeakable goodnesse, without any mans desert: and in remembrance hereof to render him most high and hearty thankes, with prayers and supplications, for the reliefe of all their daily necessities; because these holy-dayes are separated from all prophane uses, and sanctified and hallowed, dedicated and appointed not to any Saint or creature, but onely unto God and his true worship . (Which Statute excludes all Stage-plaies masques, dancing dicing and such other Christmas outrages from this sacred festivall; it being separated from all prophane uses, and onely and wholly devoted to Gods worship , and the forenamed duties of religion , which are inconsistent with them:) If there be any such, I say, as these within our Church, I only wish them banished into Nelewki in Moscovia , every Christmas; where if we beleeve Guagninus all Moschovites are prohibited to health, to be drunke, or to keepe revel rout, except onely in the Christmas, Easter, Whitsontide, and certaine other solemne feasts of Saints, especially of St.Nicholas their patron, and the festivities of the Virgin Mary, Peter and Iohn; on which like men let out of prison, they honour Bacchus more than God, or these their Saints; healthing and quaffing downe sundry sorts of liquors so long, till they are as drunke as swine, and then they fall to roaring, shouting, quarrelling, abusing, and from thence to wounding, stabbing and murthering one another; Insomuch that if this drunkennesse and disorder were permitted every day, they would utterly destroy one another with mutual slaughters . This is the Moschovites Christmas- keeping, who have liberty granted them to be drunke all Christmas, yea these are their drunken fatall ends, which if our Christmas roaring boyes affect, they may doe well to keepe their Christmas commons with these beastly drunken swine, where strangers have libertie to be drunke, to carouze & health even all Christmas , & at all times else. But let all who have any sparkes of sobriety, temperance or grace within them, abominate these unchristian Christmas extravagancies; passing all the time of their sojourning here in feare , concluding with that speech of holy Peter; The time past of our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousnesse, lusts, excesse of wine and riot, revellings, banquettings, abominable idolatries ; bacchanalian Christmas pastimes and disorders: And thereupon resolving, to purge out all this old leaven, (of dancing, dicing, healthing, Playes and riot) that so they may be a new lumpe, because Christ their Passeover is now sacrificed for them: casting away all these workes of darknesse, and putting on the armour of light: walking honestly as in the day , (especially in the days of Christs Nativitie) not in rioting and drunknesse, not in chambering and wantonnes, strife and envying, (no nor yet in dancing, dicing, carding, Stageplayes, Mumeries, Masques, and such like heathenish practises , which are altogether unsuitable for Christians, expecially at such sacred times as these, as sundry forequoted Councels have resolved:) but putting on the Lord Iesus Christ, (who about this time put on our nature, as wee must now put on his grace, his holinesse) and making no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof : So shall wee celebrate our Saviours Nativity, and all other Christian Festivals, with which Stage- playes are altogether inconsistent, both to our Saviours honour, our owne present comfort, and our eternall future joy. For the third part of the Objection: that Stage-playes are necessary to recreate and delight the people. I answer first; that there are many other farre better, easier and cheaper recreations void of all offence, with which the people may seasonably delight themselves: therefore they neede not these lewd superfluous costly Enterludes to sport themselves withall. Secondly, wee see that people live best of all without them. There are Many Nations in the world, who never knew what Stage- playes meant; yea there are sundry shires and Citties in our Kingdome, where Players (who for the most part harbour about London, where they have only constant standing Play-houses) never come to make them sport; and yet they never complaine for want of pleasures, or these unnecessary Stage-delights: The most, the best of men live happily, live comfortably without them; yea farre more plesantly than those who most frequent them . Therefore they are no such necessary pastimes, but that they may well be spared. Thirdly, there are none so much addicted to Stageplayes, but, when they goe unto places where they cannot have them, or when as they are suppressed by publike authority, (as in times of pestilence , and in Lent till now of late) can well subsist without them, finding out far better recreations to solace themselves withall, and to passe away their idle houres: therefore they are meere superfluous pleasures which may be better spared then enjoyed. Fourthly, what people should these delight? Good people? Alas , they hate them, abhorre them, they see nought else in Playes but filthinesse, wickednesse, and that which grieves their righteous soules : therefore their soules can take no pleasure in them. Lewd people? Alas, their lewdnesse should be crossed, checked, suppressed , not countenanced, not fomented with this foode of vice: yea these should rather be afflicted, nay terrified with Gods judgements, hell, and the serious contemplation of their owne forlorne sinfull estates, which might leade them on to sin-lamenting sorrow and sincere repentance; then soothed, then delighted with these momentany pleasures of sinne, which doe but crust their consciences, obdurate their impenitent hearts , and post them on to hell with more security and greater speed . Good men neede not these infernall delights to make them worse; ill men neede to want them, that they maw grow better; for whiles they diligently frequent them, they are altogether hopelesse of becomming good : therefore it is necessary onely that all should want them, but no necessitie at all that any should enjoy them. Lastly, all the wisest Heathen Emperours, States, Philosophers, have deemed them so unnecessary, so intollerably pernicious, that they have wholly abandoned them as good for nothing but to corrupt the peoples mindes and manners: yea all the primitive Christians, the primitive Church both under the Law and Gospell; together with sundry Councels, Fathers , Christian Emperors, Kings and Writers have excluded them Church and State as unlawfull, unsufferable to remaine in either, as recreations no wayes fit for Christians, especially on festivals and holy seasons ; on which no man ever thought them usefull but one poore scribling hackney Stage-player , for his owne advantage, who was likely to be undone if playes should once miscarry. Wherefore I may safely conclude with the unanimous suffrage of all the forequoted Authorities: that Stage-playes are no whit usefull or necessary to recreate or delight the people, who may live well without them; but cannot live well with them, as I have more largely proved Act.6.Scene 3, 4, 5.  & 19, 20. on which you may reflect. The fourth objection for the lawfulnesse of playes is this: That they are ancient, and of long continuance, that they are tollerated still among us; that many, yea most frequent them, approve them in their judgements; therefore they are certainly lawfull. To this I answer first: that the long continuance and antiquitie of Stageplayes is no good argument of thier goodnesse. The Divell and sin are of greater antiquitie and continuance than Stage-playes; yet their antiquity makes neither of them good: yea both of them are therefore the worse, because they are so ancient ; and so are Playes. Ill things the elder they are the worse. Secondly, though playes are ancient, yet their originall is knowne what it was, it was from, their Father the Divell, and idolatrous Pagans : and that which had so bad a beginning, will hardly contract any reall goodnesse by any effluxe of time. Thirdly, though they were ancient and of long continuance among heathen Greekes and Romans, yet they are but of punie standing among Christians, the primitive Church and Christians wholly abandoning and never admitting them , as I have largely proved. Fourthly, though they have long continued, yet their pescription hath beene oft interrupted, and themselves suppressed as well by Pagans as Christians: yea the very best and chiefest of Pagans, of Christians have alwayes constantly oppugned them from their very infancy till this present, as most pernicious evills , as I have largely proved. Their antiquitie therefore is onely an argument of their long-continued, long-oppugned lewdnesse, no proofe at all of their present goodnesse. Secondly I answer. That their tolleration is a strong evidence of their mischievous naugthinesse: since good and profitable things are always approved, established, and nought but ill things tollerated or connived at, which are to be removed: But admit they are thus tollerated, yet their tolleration makes them not good or lawfull in themselves. We know, that usury is permitted by the lawes and State: yet it remaines a sinne still : We know, that many wicked men and notorious malefactors are tollerated for a time; and that not onely by men, but even by God himself, who is patient and long-suffering towards sinners: and yet they are not therefore good, but bad men still; and so much the worse, by how much the longer they are forborne. The tolleration therefore of Stage-playes will not evince their goodnesse: the rather, because though they are connived at de facto, yet they are long since condemned de jure by our Lawes, our Statutes, our Magistrates, and Writers, as unlawfull pastimes : their tolleration therefore is no better an evidence of their lawfulnesse, than a reprive or pardon of a condemened traytors innocency: which are onely arguments of a Princes lenity, but infallible testimonies of the traytors guilt. That Playes, that Players are suffered still, (as too many other condemned sins  & mischiefes are) it is onely the falult of Magistrates, who may, who should suppresse them , not of our Lawes, which are most severe against them. Thirdly, for the multitude of Play -baunters, and Play-approvers , I answer; first, that it is no argument of their goodnesse, but of their badnesse rather; since multitude, for the most part is an infallible figne of the worser, not the most part of the broad way which lead to destruction, where the passengers are alwayes many; not of the narrow way that leades to eternall life, which few ever finde, 'and fewer walke in . If multitude were an argument of goodnesse, then pagans and Mahometans should be as good, nay better than Christians; Papists, better than Protestants; drunkards and wicked men, better than sober and good men, because they are more in number than they: yea than the world the flesh and the Divell should be good, yea as good or better than God himselfe, because more follow them, serve tham, than there follow God . The multitude therefore of play-haunters, of play-patrons is no convincing evidence of their goodnesse. Secondly, we must not judge of the lawfulnesse of unlawfull things by the most, but by the best or men : now the best, wisest of men, as I have largely proved , have always condemned Stage-playes, no matter therefore what the multitudes judgement of practise is, whom we must not follow to doe evill . Thirdly, Christians are not to walke or judge by examples, but by precepts; the word of God , not the actions or lives of men, must be the onely rule both of their practise and their judgements too . Now the Scripture , (yea the whole Church of God from age to age ) have passed sentence against Stage-playes, as unlawfull pastimes: no matter therefore what the world esteemes them. Fourthly, for those who approve of Stage-playes or resort unto them, what are they? Children, youngsters, ignorant injudicious persons who know not how to distinguish between good and evill, judgeing onely of the goodness of things by sence, by pleasure, by the opinion and practise of others , or as they are swayed by their unruly lusts, not by right reason or the word of God: or else they are gracelesse, dissolute, prophane, lascivious, godlesse persons, (as most Players, Play-haunters,and Play-proctors are ) who call good evill, and evill good : who count sinne their honour , sobriety, modesty, and true piety, their shame: iudging amisse of God, of grace, of holinesse, of all kinde of goodnesse and good men : no matter therefore, what these judge of Stage-playes, who thus misjudge of all things . Let us therefore judge of Stage-playes with righteous judgement , as God, as Christians, as the primitive Church as Councels, Fathers, and the best, the wisest of Christian, of Pagan Emperours, Magistrates, Republickes, Philosophers, and Writers of all sorts have already determined of them to our hands; and then we must certainly condemne them, as most intollerable and unchristian pleasures; as all these have done. The fifth Allegation in the behalfe of Stage-playes is this: That there is much good history, many grave sentences, much good councell; much poetry, eloquence, oratory, invention, wit, and learning in them. Therefore they must certainly be very good and commendable recreations. To this I answer first: that it is true, there is in many Stage-playes many commendable parts of history, poetry, invention, rhetoricke, art, wit, learning; together with much good language, and some sage Counsell too, all which are good and usefull in themselves; but yet there is so much obscenity, scurrility and lewdnesse mixed with them, like deadly poyson in a sugred potion, that these very good things make the Playes farre worse . The stronger the wine, the better, the sweeter the conserves wherewith poyson is contemperated, the more deadly, the more dangerously it workes; the deeper it sinkes into the veines, and the more greedily and insensibly it is swallowed downe . So the more witty, the more eloquent and rhetoricall the Playes, the more imperceptibly, the more perniciously & abundantly diffuse they their vices, their obscenities, & poysonful corruptions into the eares and hearts of the Spectators . It is a true saying of judicious Augustine , . That evill things elegantly expressed are most pernicious : whence Lactantius affirmes; that the heathen Philosophers, Orators and Poets were most hurtfull in this, that they did easily intangle unwary mindes with the sweetnes of their words, and the harmony of their smooth-running verses, which were but as honey covering poyson . The more elegant and witty therefore the Playes, the more dangerous and destructive are they,as the Fathers teach us; there being nothing else but poyson under the honey of art and eloquence . Secondly, the reason why there is so much history, poetry, sweetnesse, wit and curious language in our stage-playes, is onely to conceale their venome, their contagion that so the auditors, the spectators may swallow it downe with greater greedinesse, and lesse suspition. Nulla aconita bibuntur fictilibus : the Divell and his accursed instruments know full well, that poysoned positions must be infused not into earthen, but into golden Cuppes ; that venemous pills must not be tempered with gall or colloquint, but with honey, sweet-meates, or the most luscious conserves, else none will swallow or quaffe them downe: wherefore they temper, they guild over their venemous obscenities and Stage-corruptions (which if they came naked on the Stage without these trappings, would be so bitter, so foule and desperately obscene that few Christians could digest them.) with these specious outsides, these luscious conserves of wit, of eloquence, invention, learning, history, and the like, that so they may the better countenance, shrowd and vent them to the hurt of others. What Gregory the Great writes of Heretiques; Habent hoc h aeretici proprium, ut malis bona permisceant, quatenus facile sensus audientis illudant. Si enim, semper prava discerent sitius in sua pravitate cogniti, quod vellent, minim e persuaderent. Ita permiscent recta perversis, ut ostendendo bona auditores ad se trahant; et exhibendo mala, latenti eos peste corrumpant . Or what Faustus Rhegiensis writes of the Divell and malicious poysoners, Diabolus calliditate veteris artificij ac multiformis ingenij, condit blandimenta peccandi. Sic etiam malefici facere solent qui mortiferos herbarum temperant succos in condito aut aliquo dulci poculo nescientibus propinaturi, gustum mentita suavitate componunt, virus amaritudinis obscurant fraude dulcedinis, Provocat primus odor poculi, sed pr aefocat inclusus sapor veneni. Mel est quod ascendit in labia, fel est quod descendit in viscera . Or what Vincentius Lerinensis writes of Heretiques: Faciunt quod hi solent qui parvulis austera qu aedam temperaturi pocula, prius ora melle circumlinunt; ut incauta aetas cum dulcedinem praesenserit, amaritudinem. non reformidet: Quot etiam ijs curae est, qui mala gramina, et noxios succos, medicaminum vocabulis praecolerant, ut nemo fere ubi supra-scriptum legerit remedium, suspicetur venenum . The same may I truly write of Play-poets and Actors. They cover and sweeten over their poyson, their corruption with eloquence, art and witty inventions, that so they may have the freer vent; and temper their evill with some shewes of good, that so it may more easily circumvent the Auditors, and find freer entrance into their soules. This Cyprian, this Tertullian , Salvian, with other Fathers , together with Didacus de Tapia , and sundry . moderne Authorstestifie: heare but Tertullian for them all, who writes thus of the pleasure, the eloquence and good ingredients that are oft in Playes. Nemo venenum temperat felle et hellebora, sed conditis pulmentis et bene saporatis, et plurimum dulcibus id mali injicit. Ita diabolus letale quo conficit, rebus Dei gratissimis ac acceptissimis imbuit. Omnia itaque illic (speaking of the Theatre) seu fortia, seu honesta, seu sonora,seu canora, seu subtilia proinde habe ac si stillicidia mellis de libalunculo venenato; nec tanti gulam facias voluptatis, quanti periculum . All the eloquence and sweetnesse therefore that is in Stage-playes, is but like the drops of honey out of a poysoned limbecke which please the pallate onely, but destroy the man that tastes them. So that I may well compare our Stage- playes to Apothecaries Gallie- pots: Quorum tituli habent remedia, pyxides venena :which have glorious soothing titles without, but poysons onely within. Thirdly, though all these good things are in Stage-playes now and then, yet they are there onely as good things perverted, which prove worst of any . Nothing is there so pernicious as good parts, or a good wit abused: as wit, art, eloquence and learning cast away upon an amorous, prophane, obscene lascivious subject; on which whiles many out of a vaine-glorious humour have spent the very creame and flower of their admired parts I may truly affirme with Salvian , Non tam illustrasse mihi ipsa ingena, qu am damnasse videantur they seeme to me not so much to have illustrated as damned their much applauded wits and parts , in being acutely elegant in such unworthy sordid theames, which modest eyes would blush to reade, and chast tender consciences bleede to think of. As therefore Ovids transcendent poetry. Martials prophane and scurrilous panderly wit, Catullus, Tibullus , and Propertius their eloquence, made their obscene lascivious po ems farre more pernicious, not more chast and commendable; so the elegancy, invention, stile and phrase of Stage-playes, is onely an argument of their greater lewdnesse, not any probate of their reall goodnesse. What therefore Vincentius Lerinensis writes of Origen and Tertullian , that their transcendent abilities of eloquence, learning and acutenesse, made their erronious Tenents farre more dangerous: the same wee may conclude of Playes and Poets; the more witty and sublime their stile or matter, the more pernicious their fruites: for then, Viperium obducto potamus melle venenum . We drinke downe deadly poyson in a honey potion; which proves honey onely in the pallate, but gall in the bowells, death in the heart; as the most delightfull amorous Stage-playes: alwayes doe. common as it is prophane : That Stage-playes are as good as Sermons; and that many learne as much good at a Play as at a sermon: therefore they cannot be ill. To this I shall answer first in the words of Mr. Philip Stubs, and of I.G. in his Refutation of the Apologie for Actors, p. 61. Oh blasphemy intollerable! Are obscene Playes and filthy Enterludes comparable to the word of God the foode of life, and life it selfe? It is all one as if they had said; Baudry, Heathenry, Paganisme, Scurrilitie and Divelry it selfe is equall with Gods word:or that Sathan is equipollent with the Lord. God hath ordained his word, and made it the ordinary meanes of our salvation: the Divell hath inferred the other as the ordinary meanes of our destruction. God hath set his holy word and Ministers to instruct us in the way of life; the Divell instituted Playes and Actors to seduce us into the way of death. And will they yet compare the one with the other? If he be accursed, that calleth light darknesse and darkness light; truthe falshood, and falshood truth; then a fortiori, is hee accursed that saith, Playes and Enterludes are equivalent with Sermons, or compareth Comedies & Tragedies with the word of God; whereas there is no mischiefe, almost, which they maintaine not . Thus they. But if Stage-playes be as good as Sermons (as many prophancce ones, who heare and reade more Playes than Sermons, deeme them;) then Players certainly by the selfe same argument,are as good as Preachers: and if this be so, what difference betweene Christ and Belial, Play-houses and Churches, Ministers and Actors? yea why then doe we not erect new Theaters in every Parish, or turne our Churches into Play- houses , our Preachers into Actors , since they are thus parallels in their goodnesse? But what prodigious and more than stygean profanesse is there in this comparison? Who ever paralleld hell with heaven, vice with vertue, darknesse with light, Divels with Angels, dirt with gold? yet there is as great a disparity in goodnesse between Playes and Sermons, as there is in these; the one being ever more reputed the chiefest happinesse , the other the greatest mischiefe in any Christian State . But this part of the objection is too grosse to confute, since the very naming of it is a sufficient refutation. I come therefore to the second clause: That many learne as much good at Playes, as at Sermons . And I beleeve it too; for had they ever learn'd any good at Sermons, (which would be altogether needles, if so much goodnesse as is objected might be learn'd from Playes) they would certainly have learned this among the rest, never to resort to Stage-Playes . The truth then is this; most Play-haunters learne no good at all at Sermons; not because Sermons have no goodnesse for to teach them, but because they are unapt to learne it: partly , because they seldome frequent Sermons, at leastwise not so oft as Playes: partly, because their eares are so dull of hearing, and their mindes so taken up with Play-house contemplations whiles they are at Church, that they mind not seriously what they heare: partly because the evill which they learn at Playes, overcomes the good they learne at Sermons, and will not suffer it to take root within them: and partly, because Playes and Sermons are so incompatible, that it is almost impossible for any man to receive any good at all from Sermons, whiles hee is a resorter unto Stageplayes : Well therefore may they learne as much goodnesse from Playes as Sermons, because they never learned ought from either, but much hurt from both, the very word of God being a stumbling block, a meanes of greater condemnation, yea a savour of death unto death to such unprofitable hearers who reape no grace nor goodnesse from it . But to passe by this, if there be so much goodnesse learn'd from Playes, I pray informe me who doe learne it. If any, then either the Actors or Spectators: For the Actors, their goodnesse verily is so little , that it is altogether to be learnt as yet; and if ever they chance to attaine the smallest dram of grace (as they are never like to doe whiles they continue Players) it must be then from Sermons onely, not from Playes, which make them every day worse and worse, but cannot possibly make them better. For the Spectators, they can learne no good at all from Playes, because (as Isiodor Pelusiota long since resolved it) Players and Stageplayes can teach the none . Never heard or read I yet of any whom Stage-playes meliorated or taught any good: all they can teach them, all they learne from them is but some scurrill jests, some witty obscenities, some ribaldry ditties, some amorous wanton complements, some fantastique fashions, some brothel-house Courtshippe to wooe a strumpet, or to court a whore: these are the best lessons these schooles of vice and lewdnesse teach, or these their schollers learne: I shall therefore close up this objection with that of Mr. Stubs and I. G. in their forequoted places. If you will learne to doe any evill, skilfully, cunningly; covertly or artificially, you neede goe no other where than to the Theatre. If you will learne falshood, cosenage, indirect dealing, if you will learne to deceive, to play the hypocrite , sycophant, parasite and flatterer: if you will learne to cogge, lie and falsifie; to jest, laugh, and fleere; to grin, nodde, and mow; to play the vice, to curse, sweare, teare, and blaspheme both heaven and earth in all kindes and diversities of oathes: if you will learne to play the bawd or curtesan; to pollute your selfe, to devirginate maides, to deflowre wives, or to ravish widdowes by enticing them to lust: if you will learne to drabbe and stabbe, to murther, kill and slay; to picke, steale, rob and rove: if you will learne to rebell against Princes, closely to carry treasons, to consume treasures, to practise idlenesse, to sing and talke of filthy love and venery; to deride, quippe, scorne, scoffe, mocke and floate; to flatter and smooth: to play the Divel, the swaggerer, the whoremaster, the glutton, the drunkard, the injurious or incestuous person; if you will learne to become proud, haughty and arrogant: Finally, if you will learne to contemne God and all his lawes, to care neither for heaven nor hell, and to commit all kinde of sinne and mischiefe with secrecie and art, you neede not goe to any other schooles: for all these good examples may you see painted before your eyes in Enterludes and Playes . These, and these onelie are the great good instructions that either Actours or Spectatours learne from Stage-plaies; which make them fit schollers only for the Divel, and traine them up for hell, where all Play-house goodnesse (unlesse God grants mercie and sincere repentance) ever ends. that they reprehend sinne and vice; that they inveigh against the corruptions and corrupt ones of the times; that they remunerate and applaud vertue, and sharply censure vice: that their abuses, their excesses may be regulated, and themselves reduced to a good decorum: therefore they are lawfull: which Objections I have answered by the way before: viz . at pag. 34. to 42. p. 96. to 106.  & p. 124. to 127. The grand Objections of our present dissolute times for the justification of these Playes is this; That none but a companie of Puritans and Precisians speak against them; all else applaud and eke frequent them; therefore cetainly they are very good recreations, since none but Puritans disaffect them. To this I answer, that the objection is as false as frivolous: For first, I have already fully manifested, that many Heathen States and Emperors, and among the rest, Tiberius, Nero, and Iulian the Apostate , (who were as farre from Puritanisme, as the deboisest Antipuritans, the most dissolute Players or Play-Patrons this day living) have condemned, suppressed Playes and Players : Besides, I have largely proved, that not onely Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, and other heathen Philosophers; but even Horace, Iuvenal, nay Ovid and Propertius , (the most lascivious heathen Poets, who were as farre from Puritans, as they were from Christians) have declaimed against Stage-plaies. And is not this then a notorious falshood? that none but Puritans condemne Stage-plaies. Were Tiberius, Nero, Iulian, Aristotle, Tibullus, Ovid , (thinke you) Puritans? Were all those fore-quoted Pagans , who censured and suppressed Stage-plaies, Puritans? If these be now turn'd Puritans in the Objectors phrase, I pray what manner of Christians (I dare not say incarnate Divels) are those persons, who thus taxe these dissolute Pagans for puritanicalll Precisians? certainlie if they are somewhat better than infernall fiends, yet they are by many degrees worse than the very worst of all these Pagans ; who by their owne confessions, are Saints, are Puritans in respect of them . O then the stupendious wickednesse! the unparalleld prophanesse of our gracelesse times! when Christians are not afraid, ashamed to professe themselves more desperately vitious, lascivious, and deboist, than the very worst of Pagans, whom they thus honour with the stile of Puritans, because they are more vertuous, lesse vitious than themselves! Certainly if atheisticall prophanesse, and infernall lewdnesse increase but a little more among us, as it is very like if Stage-playes still continue, I am afraid these Objectors will grow to that excesse of wickednes ere long,that the Divell himselfe, (nay, Beelzebub the very Prince of Divels ) shall be canonized by them for a Puritan, because he equalls them not in wickednesse. Let these Play-patrons therefore, either waive this false Objection, or else confesse these very heathen Puritans (as they deeme them) to be much better, much worthier of the name of Christians, than themselves. Secondly, I have infallibly manifested; That the whole primitive Church both under the Law and Gospell, together with all the primitive Christians, Fathers and Councels have most abundantly censured and condemned Playes and Players in the very highest degree of opposition . And were the primitive Church and Christians, the Fathers, or Bishops who were present at these Councels, Puritans? If not: then the objection is false. If Puritans; then Puritans are no such Novellers, or new upstart humorists as the world reputes them: yea then they are in truth no other, but the true Saints of God, the undoubted successors of the primitive Church and Chistians, whose doctrine, discipline, graces, manners they onely practise and maintaine. And indeede if the truth of things bee well examined, wee may easily prove the Fathers, the primitive Church and Christians, (yea Christ himselfe, his Prophets and Apostles) Puritans , if that which brands men now for Puritans in prophane ones censures, may descide this Controversie. To instance in some few particulars. One grand badge of a Puritan is (as the objection testifieth) to condemne Stage-playes, Players and Play-haunters, and wholly to renounce these Pompes of the Divell: But this the Apostles, the Fathers , the primitive Councels, Church and Christians did, as I have plentifully manifested , this being the most notorious character of a faithfull Christian, to abstaine from Stage-playes . By this badge therefore they are arrant Puritans. To condemne effeminate mixt dancing, lasciviousnesse , and diceplay ; together with health-drinking, drunkennesse, deboistnesse, roaring, whoring, ribaldry, obscene or amorous songs and jests, and naked filthy lust provoking pictures , are now chiefe symptomes of a notorious Puritan: but Christ, his Prophets and Apostles, together with all the primitive Churches, Christians, Fathers, Councels have condemned all and each of these with an unanimous consent : therefore they are arrant Puritans. To speake or write against mens wearing of perewigges; Love-locks, and long haire, together with the effeminate frizling, pouldring, and accurate nice composing of it: to declaime against our whorish females frizling, broydring, pouldring, dying, plaiting, with their late impudent mannish, that I say not monstrous cutting and shearing of their haire; and their false borrowed excrements: to declaime against face-painting, vaine wanton complements, strange fashions , tyres, newfangled or overcostly apparell , are eminent characters of a branded Puritan: But Christ Iesus himselfe, his Prophets and Apostles, with all the primitive Churches, Councels, Fathers, Christians, have earnestly spoken, written, declaimed against all & each of these lewd sinfull practises . Therefore they are Puritans. To be holy in all manner of conversation even as God and Christ are holy : to live righteously, soberly and godly in this present evill world , crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof; avoiding, detesting all sinne and wickednesse whatsoever in ones selfe and other; and shining as lights and patternes of holinesse in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation : to be frequent in hearing, reading, preaching, or meditating and discoursing of Gods word: to repeate Sermons , (a duty warranted by Scripture , and much pressed by Arelatensis , an ancient Father; to pray constantly morning and evening with ones family; to abandon all lewd places and companions , all pleasures and delights of sinne, all Christmas excesses and disorders, all Pagan rites and heathenish customes ; and to make the holiest Svints his best, his sole familiar friends, the word & service of God his chiefe delight: to stand for God and for his truth in evill times when they are most opposed; to live civilly and piously in the middest of wicked men, and not to joyne with them in the same excesse of sinne and riot of dissolutenesse and deboistnesse that they runne into: to reprove or crosse men in their sinfull fashions, customes, disorders, lusts or courses : with sundry other particulars which I pretermit; are now infallible arguments and symptomes of a ranke Puriran . But this did Christ, his Prophets and Apostles, together with all the primitive Churches, Councels, Fathers and pious Christians, as those whom the world stiles Puritans doe now: therefore without all doubt they are Puritans (as Puritans are now reputed) even in the very highest degree. Yea, were our Saviour Christ, St. Paul, St. Iohn , together with all those holy Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Fathers, and other primitive Saints which we reade of in the Scriptures, or Ecclesiasticall Writers, now living here among us, I doubt not but they would all be pointed at, hissed, reviled, hated, scorned , if not persecuted, as the very Archest Puritans, for their transcendent holinesse, and rebukes of sin  & sinners: since those poore Saints of God, who have not attained to the moity of their transcendent grace and purity, are now stiled, & pointed at for Puritans , even for that little purity and holinesse which is discovered in their lives. If therefore Christ himselfe, his Prophets and Apostles, together with all the primitive Churches, Fathers, Councels, and Christians were Puritans, in that very sence, & on the selfesame grounds that those whom the world stiles Puritans are so named now, as I have fully manifested by the premises; and dare make good in all particulars against any Anti-puritans whatsoever; the objectors must now either disclaime their Antecedent, (that none but Puritans condemne Stage- playes:) or in case they grant all these to be Puritans, they must now invert their rash conclusion: that Stage-playes certainely are evill, because Christ, his Prophets and Apostles, the whole primitive Church, the Fathers, Councels, and primitive Christians, (all ranke Puritans) have out of their very puritie and holinesse condemned them long agoe, and none but the very shame, the scumme of Christians, or men unworthy that worthy title did anciently approve them, as I have largely evidenced, Act. 4. Scene 1, 2. Act. 6. Scene 3, 4, 5. & Act. 7. Scene 1. to 7. Thirdly, I have manifested, that many moderne Christians, not onely Protestans, but Papists too , have utterly condemned Stage-playes. And I hope all Papists (the originall inventors of this stile of Puritans, which they have cast on orthodox Protestants as a very Motto or by-word of disgrace,) are exempted from this number of Puritans intended in the Objection. Either Papists therefore must be Puritans, for condemning Playes, which many of the chiefe Objectors being Papists (as are most of all our Players) will hardly grant; or else the Objection must be false. Fourthly, admit that none but Puritans condemne or censure Stage-playes; consider then, I pray you, with an impartiall eye, what kinde of persons these Play-abhorring conformable Puritans and Precisians are: Are they not the holiest, the devoutest, the eminentest and most religious gracious Saints, who leade the strictest, purest, heavenliest, godliest lives outstripping all others both in the outward practise, and inward power of grace? Are they not such whose piety, whose universall holinesse in all companies, times and places, are an eye-sore, a life-sore, an heart-sore, yea a shame and censure unto others ? Are they not such as Lactantius writes of? Sunt aliqui intempestiv e boni, qui corruptis moribus publicis convicium bene vivendo faciunt. Ergo tanquam scelerum et malitiae suae testes extirpare funditus nituntur et tollere; gravesque sibi putant tanquam eorum vita coarguatur. Idcirco auferantur, quibus coram vivere pudet; qui peccantium frontem etsi non verbis, quiae tacent, tamen ipso vitae genere dissimili feriunt et verberant: Castigare enim videtur quicunque dissentit . (The case of the primitive, pious Christians, amongst the dissolute vitious Gentiles.) And they not such who are peremptory in the conscionable performance of every holy duty: resolute in the hatred of every customary sinne , refusing to runne into the same excesse of wickednesse, into the grosse corruptions of the times, into which most men rush with greedinesse, as the horse into the battell ? Doubtlesse, what ever the malice of others may conceive of them, yet they are no other but such as these, as the very fiercest Anti-puritans consciences whisper to them; qui suspectis omnibus ut improbos metuunt, etiam quos optimos sentire potuerunt . If any man doubt of this, these few experimentall arguments may convince him. For first, there is never a sincere, devout or pious Christian this day living is England, who excells in holinesse of life, in integrity of conversation , avoiding all the corruptions that are in the world through lust; and living righteously, soberly and godly in this present evill world; refusing to conforme himselfe to the fashions, vanities, pleasures, sinnes, and wicked humours of the times , (which perchance he hath too much followed heretofore before his true conversion,) but is commonly reputed, and oft times stiled, a Puritan, a Precisian, and the like , be his place or condition what it will. Hee who hath more grace and godnesse, more chastity, modesty, temperance or sobriety, more love and dread of God, more hatred of sin and wickednes; lesse tincture of atheisme, impiety, voluptuousnesse and prophanesse, than others among whom he lives, let him be never so just in his dealings towards men, never so conformable to the doctrine and ceremonies of the Church , is forthwith branded for a notorious Puritan and Precisian all England over: and the more eminent his graces and holinesse are in the view of others , the more is he maligned, envied, hated, and the greater Puritan is he accounted, as every mans owne experience can informe him. These Puritans and Precisians therefore are the best of Christians. Secondly, those who are most violently invective, and maliciously despitefull against Puritans and Precisians, both in their words and actions, are such who are unsound or popishly affected in their religion, or prophane and dissolute in their lives. The most Romanized Protestants, the deboisest drunkards , the effeminatest Ruffians, the most fantasticke apish Fashionmongers; the lewdest whoremasters, Panders, Strumpets; the prophanest Roarers, Players, Play-haunters, and Brothel-hunters; the most prodigious Swearers, Epicures and Health-quaffers; the most gracelesse vitious persons of all rankes and professions; (especially temporizing, sloathfull, unorthodox, epicurean, Ale-house haunting, dissolute Clergy men, the greatest enemies of all others, to true grace and piety , as all ages witnesse;) are alwayes the greatest railers, the fiercest enemies against Puritans and Precisians as the world now stiles them; therefore they are certainly the very best and holiest Christians, because the very worst of men (who like vitious Nero, never heartily condemne ought else, but some great good or other ) detest, revile them most. Et argumentum recti est, malis displicere , as not onely Seneca , but the Scripture teacheth us. Thirdly, there is no man ever stiled a Puritan or Precisian by another in score or contempt, as these names are now commonly used; but it is either for some evill or other that he hates, which he who stiles him so, affects; or for some grace or goodnesse , or some transcendent degree of holinesse that is in him, which the other wants. To instance in some particulars. Let a man make conscience of drunkennesse, of drinking and pledging healthes, of frequenting Ale-houses, Tavernes, and Tobacco-shops; and presently he is cried out upon and censured for a Puritan by all the Pot-companions, and Drunkards with whom he shall converse . Let any one refuse to follow the guise and dissolute effeminate fashions of the times; let him crie out against Love-locks and ruffianly long haire; against false haire and perewigs which our men and women now generally take up, as if they were quite ashamed of that head which God hath given them, and proud of the tire-womans which they have dearely bought : Let any Gentlewoman of quality now refuse to cut, to poulder, frizell and set out her haire like a lascivious courtezan, or to paint her face like some common prostituted harlot; or to follow any other amorous complements and disguises of the times , adorning her selfe onely in modest apparell, with shamefastnesse, sobriety and good workes, as becomes a woman professing godlinesse ; the onely feminine ornaments that St. Paul commends: and what else shall they heare from all the Ruffians, fantastiques, and Frenchefied wanton Dames that live about them, but this opprobrious censure, that they are become professed Puritans. If any make conscience of frequenting Play-houses, Dice-houses, Whore-houses; of lascivious mixt dancing, lascivious ribaldry songs and Discourses, inordinate gaming , and such other sinfull pleasures which the most delight in, refusing to beare men company in these delights of sinne: our Play-haunters, Dicers, Gamesters, Whoremasters, and such voluptuous persons, will presently voyce them up for Puritans. Yea such is the desperate wickednesse of the times, that let a man be vitious in one kinde, and yet temperate in another; as let him be a Play-haunter, a gamester, and not a drunkard; a drunkard, and yet no swearer, no whoremaster, no ruffian, or the like; or let a man be vitious in diverse kindes, and yet not so bad as others of his companions, and he shall be sometimes reproached for a Puritan, because he is not so universally, so extremely wicked and deboist, as those of his companions who are farre worse than he. Whence we oft times finde, that such who are reputed no better than prophane ones, when they are in company somewhat better than themselves; are censured for Puritans among prophane ones, because they are not so unmeasurably wicked as the worst of them . And as those who are not so desperately outragious in their extravagant sinfull courses as others, are thus houted at for Puritans and Precisians, by such as are lewder than themselves: so those who outstrip all others in holinesse, pietie and vertue, are reputed Puritans too, because they excell in goodnesse. For let a man be a diligent hearer and repeater of Sermons and Lectures; a constant reader and discourser of Gods word ; a strict observer of the Lords day; a lover,and companion of the holiest men ; a man that is holy and gracios in his speeches in all companies and places , desirous to sow some seedes of grace, and to plant religion where ever he comes: let him be much in prayer, in meditation, in fasting and humiliation , much grieving for his sinnes, and complaining of his corruptions ; let him be alwayes hungring and thirsting after grace , and using all those meanes with conscionable care which may bring him safe to heaven, abandoning all those sins, those pleasures and companies which may hinder him, in his progresse towards heaven : Let a man be a diligent powerfull soule-searching sinne-reproving Minister , residing constantly upon his benefice, and preaching every Lords-day twice : or let him be a diligent upright Magistrate, punishing drunkennesse, drunkards, swearers, suppressing Ale- houses , May-games, Revels, dancing, and other unlawfull pastimes on the Lords day , according to his oath and duty; Let any of any profession be but a little holier or sticter than the Major part of men; and this his holines, his forwardnes in reliligion , is sufficient warrant for all prophane ones, for all who fall short of this his practicall power of grace to brand and hate him for a Puritan, as every mans conscience cannot but informe him. It is manifest then by all these particular experimentall instances; that those whom the world stiles Puritans and Precisians, are the very best and holiest Christians, and that they are thus ignominiously intituled, yea hated and maligned because they are lesse vitious, more pious, strict and vertuous in their lives than such who call them so. Fourthly, there is no man so fierce an Antipuritan in his health and life, but desires to turne Puritan and Precisian in the extremity of his sicknesse and the day of death . When God sends his judgements, crosses, or tormenting mortall diseases upon such who were most bitter Satyrists against Puritans all their lives before; or when hee awakens such mens consciences to see the gastly horrour of their notorious sinnes, when they are lying perplexed on their death-beds with the feare of damnation ready to breath out their soules into hell at every gaspe, they will then turne Puritans in very good earnest, desiring to die such as they would never live: yea then in such extremities as these they send for those very Puritan Ministers, whom they before abhorred to instruct, to comfort them, to pray with them, for them, and to advise them what to doe that they may be saved:  & however they reputed the no better than hypocrites , fooles , or distracted furious mad ones before , yet they would willingly change lives, change soules and consciences with them then, wishing with many teares and sighes that they were but such as they. This every dayes experience almost testifies; therefore Puritans and Precisians even in the true internall conscientiall judgement of every Anti-puritan are the most godly men. Fifthly, let a drunkard, a whoremaster, a swearer, a ruffian, or any other prophane notorious wicked person be truly converted from these their sinnes, and unfainedly devoted and united to the Lord so as never to returne unto them more , [ ] cleaving unseparably unto him both in their hearts and lives; or let God worke any such visible notorious happy change in men, as to call them out of darknesse into his marvelous light , and to translate them from under the power of Satan into the kingdome of his deare Sonne ; and no sooner shall they be thus strangely altered from bad good , or from good to better, but presently they are christened, as it were, with these two proverbs or reproach, and pointed at for Puritans and Percisians , as if they were now unworthy for to live because they are thus converted to the Lord. Before people turne religious and gracious, they are never pestered with these disdainfull tearmes: but no sooner can they begin to looke towards heaven, to change their vitious courses and amend their lives, but these Mottoes of contempt are cast upon them, even because they are growne better than they were before. Thus was it long agoe even in Salvian his dayes, who thus complaines. Statim, ut quis melior esse tentaverit deterioris abjectione calcatur. Si fuerit sublimis, fit despicabilis; si fuerit splendidissimus, fit vilssimus: fi fuer it totus honoris, fit totus injuria: ubi enim quis mutaverit vestem, mutavit protinus dignitatem. Perversa enim sum et in diversum cuncta matata. Si bonus est quispiam, quasi malus spernitur: si malus est, quasi bonus honoratar. Si honoratior quispiam se religioni applicuerit, illico honoratus esse desistit, ac per hoc omnes quodammodo mali esse coguntur ne viles habeantur. Et ideo no sine cause Apostolus clamat: Seculum totum in malo positum est: et verum est: merito enim totum in malo esse dicitur, ubi boni locum habera non possunt: siquidem ita totum iniquitatibus plenum est, aut ut mali sint, qui sunt; aut qui boni sunt malorum persecutione crucientur . And thus is it now in our dayes. Therefore Puritans and Precisians are undoubtedly the very primest Christians, because they are never honoured with these titles till they turne better than they were at first, yea better than all those that reproach them by these names of scorne. And here we may observe a difference betweene eminency in religion, and excellency in all other things besides. For let a man be exquisite in any other art or profession whatsoever, be it in Phisicke, Musicke, Law, Philosophy, or any liberall science, or mechanicke trade; yea let a man be a zealous forward Papist, Iesuite, Priest or Votary; the more eminent they are in all or any of these, the more honoured, reverenced, frequented, admired, and beloved are they of all sorts of men, because they are but naturall humane excellencies, to which corrupt nature and the Divell have no antipathy at all. But let any man become a conscionable, zealous, sincere and forward professor of true religion, transcending others in the practicall power of grace, or in the inward beauty of holinesse; and the more perspicuously eminent he growes in these, the more is he commonly hated, slaundered, persecuted, reviled by the tongues of wicked men, and the greater puritan doe they account him; because there is grace within him, that is diametrally contrary to their corruptions . Neither neede we wonder at it: for ever since God at first put enmity betweene the seede of the woman and the seede of the serpent those who have beene borne after the flesh, have persecuted, slandered, abhorred those who have beene borne after the spirit; and those who are of this world; have hated such who are redeemed out of the world; there being never as yet in any age, any concord or truce betweene Christ and Belial, light and darknesse, righteousnesse and unrighteousnesse, Beleevers and Infidels ; those who are upright in the way, being alwayes an abomination to the wicked , for these very reasons onely, and no other; because they follow the thing that good is, and runne not with them into the same excesse of riot , because their works are good, and theirs who thus revile and hate them, evill: because their lives are not like other men, and their wayes are of another fashion: because they are not for wicked mens turnes, and they are cleane contrary to their doings, upbraiding them with their offending the Law, objecting to their infamy the transgression of their education, and abstaining from their wayes as from filthinesse , testifying unto them by their holy lives, that the workes they doe are evill . These and no other were the true originall causes of mens hatred  & reproach against Christians, against Christ and his Apostles heretofore ; and of mens inveterate rancor and malicious calumnies against Puritans now, what ever mens pretences are against it, as I have more largely manifested in a precedent Treatise . If any thinke this strange, that men should be thus persecuted, hated, reviled, nicknamed, slandered and contemned even for their grace, their holinesse, and the very practicall sincere profession of religion: let them consider but these few particulars which will give them ample satisfaction in the point. First, those frequent predictions or premonitions of our Saviour to all the professors of his name: That they shall be hated, persecuted, reviled of all men & Nations for his sake: that they shall seperate them from their company, cast out their names as evill, & say all maner of evill against the falsly for his names sake : that in the world they shall have tribulation, and that whosoever killeth them shall think he doth God good service . Secondly, that memorable position of St. Paul , 1 Tim . 3.11,12. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution : for through many tribulations and afflictions we must enter into the Kingdome of heaven . Thirdly, the examples of Gods Saints in all ages even from Adam to this present. If we looke upon Cain and Abel , the two first-borne of the world, wee shall beholde gracelesse Cain, who was of that wicked one, slaying his righteous brother Abel :  & wherefore slew he him? S. Iohn resolves the question in these very termes, because his owne workes were evill and his brothers righteous : and thereupon he grounds this inference; Marvell not, my brethren, if the world hate you. Non enim mirum est , (writes Salvian) nunc sanctos homines qu aedam aspera pati, cum videamus quod Deus etiam per maximum nefas, primum sanctorum sivit occidi . Looke we upon holy King David , we shall finde him thus complaining: Psal. 38.19,20. They that hate me wrongfully are multiplied, they also that render me evill for good are my adversaries , (pray marke the onely reason) because I follow the thing that good is . The Prophet Isay complaineth thus of his times: Isay 59.14, 15. Iudgement is turned away backward and justice standeth afarre off; for truth is fallen in the streets, and equity cannot enter: yea truth faileth, and hee that departeth from evill maketh himselfe a prey, or is accounted mad : yea hee brings in Christ himselfe prophetically speaking in this manner: Behold I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signes and wonders even in Israel . The Prophet Amos writes thus of his age: Amos 5.8. They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and abhorre him that speaketh uprightly : and the Prophet Zechariah informes us, that Ioshua the high Priest, and his followers that sate before him (to wit, Christ and all his followers) were men wondred at in the world, as if they were some monstrous creatures , or men besides themselves. The Prophet Daniel we know, was so unblameable in his life and actions, that his very enemies could not finde any errour, fault, or occasion against him, except it were concerning the law of his God, and that hee made prayers and supplications before the Lord his God three times a day: and for this his piety onely they procured him to be cast into the Lions den . I could instance in divers others of Gods dearest Saints who were thus persecuted and maligned for their graces before our Saviours time, but that Tertullian hath long since forestalled mee; whose memorable passage to this purpose I wish all Antipuritans to consider. Aprimordio justitia vim patitur: statim ut coli Deus c aepit invidiam religio sortim est. Qui Deo placuerat occiditur, et quidem a fraire, quo proclivius impietas alienum sangainem sectaretur, a suo auspicata insectata est. Denique non mode justorum, verum etiam et Prophetarum: David exagitatur, Elias fugatur, Hieremias lapidatur, Esaias secatur, Zacharias inter altare et aedem trucidatur; perennes crueris sui maculas silicibus adsignans. Ipse clausula legis et Prophetarum, nec prophetes sed Angelus dictus, contumeliosa caede truncatur in puellae salticae lucar. Et utique qui spiritu Dei agebantur, ab ipso in martyria dirigebantur, etiam patiendo quae praedicassent, &c. Talia a primordio et praecepta et exempla debitricem martyrij fidem ostendunt . If wee looke upon Christ and his Apostles , we shall finde them hated, persecuted, slandered, reviled with opprobrious names and obloquies ; being made as the very filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day ; yea wee shall see them martyred and put to death for no other cause at all, but onely for their grace, their holinesse, their transcendent goodnesse, and their opposition to the sinnes and errours of the times : as I have elsewhere amply discoursed. If we behold the primitive Christians but a while, we shall discover no other cause of their hatred and persecutions against them, but onely this, that they were Christians, that they were better than they were before, and more holy than their neighbours . This Pliny himselfe affirmes in his Epistle to the Emperour Trajan, Affirmabant autem hanc fuisse summam vel culp ae Christianorum, vel erroris; quod essent soliti stato die ante lucem convenire, carnemque Christo quasi Deo dicere secum invicem: seque sacramento non in scelus aliquod obstringere, sed ne furta, ne latrocinia, ne adulteria committerent, ne fidem fallerent, ne depositum appellati denegarent : And yet for this alone were they persecuted and put to death . Hence was it that Clemens Alexandrinus writes thus in the behalfe of Christians: Nos ergo prosequuntur, non ut qui nos esse injustos deproehenderent, sed quod nos vit ae humanae injuriam facere existiment eo quod simus Christiani, et ipsos inquam, qui sic vitam instituimus, et alios adhortamur ut vitam degant similem . Hence is that excellent discourse of Tertullian to the like purpose: Ecce autem et odio habemur ab omnibus hominibus nominis causa. Non scelus aliquod in causa est, sed nomen: et solius nominis crimen est. Non ideo bonus Caius, et prudens Lucius, quia Christianus. Vt quisquis nomine Christiani (I may now say Puritani) emendatur offendit. Oditur in hominibus innocuis, nomen innocuum. Nomen detinetur, nomen expugnatur, et ignotam sectam, ignotum et auctorem vox sola pr aedamnat, quia nominatur non quia convincitur . Which I may as justly apply to Puritans and Precisians, as ever he did unto Christians who are persecuted and hated onely for their graces, their surpassing goodnesse, under the vizard of these odious names, by such who would rather slaunder, than imitate their holinesse . Hence Gregory Nazianzen also thus complained of the usage of the pious Christians of his age: Spectaculum uovum facti sumus non Angelis et hominibus, sed omnibus ferm e improbis et flagitiosis; et quovis tempore et loco, in foro, in compotationibus, in voluptatibus, in luctibus: I am etiam ad scenam usque prodijmus (quod propemodum lachrymis refero) et cum perditissimis obscaenissimisque ridemur; nec ullum tam jucundum est spectaculum, quam Christianus comicis cavillis suggillatus . And is it not as true of Puritans and Precisians now, as it was then of Christians? Hence also was the complaint of holy St. Augustine. Insultatur homini quia Christianus est: insultatur etiam homini qui inter multos Christianos melius vivit, et timens aspera verba insultatorum incidit in laqueos diaboli . Tibi pro convicio objicitur quod Christianus est Cur autem modo objicitur quod Christianus est? Tam pauci non Christiani remanserunt, ut ijs magis objiciatur, quia Christiani non sunt, qu am ipsi audeant aliquibus objicere quia Christiani sunt. Tamen dico vobis fratres mei, incipe quicunque me audis vivere quomodo Christianus, et vide si non tibi objiciatur et a Christianis; sed nomine, non vita, non moribus. Nemo sentit nisi qui expertus est . And is not this the case of Puritans, among titular Christians now? Survey we all the other Fathers and Ecclesiasticall Historians , we shall finde them very copious in this theame, that the best Christians have beene evermore hated, persecuted and reviled by carnall men, and that onely for their grace and goodnes : Witnesse the expresse resolution of St. Chrysostome : Christianorum genus, non quia est odibile, sed quia est divinum, odiunt carnales : Which St. Augustine thus seconds. Invidenti ae illius diabolicae quainvident bonis mali, nulla alia causa est, nisi quia illi boni sunt, illi mali. Omnis enim malus ideo persequitur malum, quia illi non consentit ad malum . And this onely is the cause why Puritans and Precisians are thus maligned and despited now. If any here object, that they condemne not Puritans for their goodnesse, but because they are hypocrites and dissemblers; or because they are seditious factious persons, & enemies to the state and government; the crimes wherewith the world now charge them, whose accusations are still as various, flitting and uncertaine against Puritans, as they were of old against the Christians. To this I answer first: That it is no wonder for Puritans to be reputed hypocrites and impostors now: For even our Saviour Christ himselfe was not onely counted, but called a Deceiver, and one who did but cheate the people ; though we all know and beleeve that there was no guile at all within him: Yea all the Apostles and Saints of God were accounted Deceivers, and yet they were true, 2 Cor. 6. 8 . And St. Hierom informes us, that Christians were thus stiled even in his age. Vbicunq; viderint Christianum, statim illud e trivio ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  ; vocant Impostorem et detrahunt. H[illeg.] rumores turpissimos serunt; et quod ab ipsis egressum est, id ab alijs audisse se simulant; ijdem auctores et exaggeratores  : as our Antipuritans are now. Secondly admit that Puritans were but hypocrites  & Impostors (which is impossible for any particular men to judge since they are unacquainted with the secrets of their hearts, which God alone can onely search , which me thinkes should stop these objectors mouths) yet none exclaime against them as Puritans and Precisians for these vices onely; but for that very profession of religion which they make. For let a man be never so treacherous or deceitfull in his dealing, yet if he make no forward profession of religion, he may passe very well for a politique, crafty, provident man ; he shall then be no Puritan: but let him professe religion, be he never so honest in his dealings, yet he shall certainly be branded for a Puritan: It is not therefore mens hypocrisie, but their profession of religion that makes them Puritans: which if it be but meerely counterfeit, why doe not our Antipuritans make that profession of religion in truth, the very shew of which they so much hate, even for the substance sake? Thirdly, admit some Puritans or Precisians are meere Impostors, making religion a very vaile to cloake their treachery, and circumvent their brethren ; as there are now too many such: yet malice it selfe must needs acknowledge that the Major part of them are most just and upright in all their dealings towards men; witnesse experience, and the common speech; that such and such are very honest and upright in their trades, or they are worthy Gentlemen which men may safely trust, but yet they are Puritans; as if their piety were a disparagement to their honesty: and yet men hate and slander them all alike for the hypocrisie onely of some few; as they did the Christians in St. Augustines dayes. Quanta mal ae (saith he) dicunt in malos Christianos qu ae maledicta perveniunt ad omnes Christianos? Nunquid enim dicit qui maledicit, aut qui reprehendit Christianos, ecce quid faciunt non boni Christiani? Sed ecce quae faciunt Christiani; non seperat, non discernit . Thus doe men deale with Puritans now; they hate, revile and persecute them in the lumpe without distinction; they deeme them hypocrites and deceivers all alike, when as the most of them are not such; (as if their very profession of religion. made them hypocrites, which men are apt to believe :) therefore they detest them not for their hypocrisie, which reacheth onely to some few, but for the strict holinesse and precisenesse of their lives alone, wherein they all accord. Fourthly, the reason why men thus uncharitablie forejudge all Puritans for hypocrites, though they neither know their hearts nor persons, is onely this; because they see that holinesse, grace and goodnesse in them, which they finde not in themselves or others : and thereupon to satisfie their owne selfe-condemning consciences, they censure all excesse of grace and holinesse as meere hypocrisie, for feare themselves should be reputed but prophane in wanting all those graces, those eminent degrees of holinesse wherein they excell. It was a true speech of an heathen Orator: An non hoc ita fit in omni populo? nonne omnem exuperantiam virtutis oderunt? Quid? Aristides nonne ob eam ipsam causam patria pulsus est quod pr aeter modum justus esset ? Certainly if the exuberancy of morall vertues have made heathens odious unto vitious Pagans , no wonder if the transcendent eminency of Puritans graces procure the malice, the reproaches of all carnall Christians, who being unacquainted with the power of saving grace themselves , are apt to censure it as folly, hypocrisie or madnesse in all others: but yet this may be their comfort; C um damnamur a vobis, a Deo absolvimur. If any now reply, that Puritans live not as they speake and teach; therefore the world condemnes them for hypocrites and dissemblers: let Seneca give them a satisfactory answer. Aliter, inquit, loqueris; aliter vivis. Hoc per malignissima capita, et optimo cuique inimicissima Platoni objectum est, objectum Epicuro, objectum Zenoni Omnes enim isti dicebant non quemadmodum ipsi viverent, sed quemadmodum vivendum esset. De virtute, non de me loquor. Et cum vitijs convicium facio, in primis meis facio: cum potuero, vivam quomodo oportet. Nec malignitas me ista multo veneno tincta deterrebit ab optimis. Ne virus quidem istud, quo alios spargitis, vos necatis, ne impediet, quo minus perseverem laudare vitam, non quam ago, sed quam agendam scio, quo minus virtutem adorem, et ex intervallo ingenti reptabundus sequar. Expectabo scilicet, ut quicquam malivolenti ae inviolatum sit cui sacer nec Rutilius fuit nec Cato, &c. De alterius vitae, de alterius morte disputatis; et ad nomen magnorum ob aeliquam eximiam laudem virorum, sicut ad occursum ignotorum hominum minuti canes, latratis. Expedit enim vobis neminem videri bonum; quasi aliena virtus exprobratio delictorum vestrorum sit. Inviti splendida cum sordibus vestris confertis, nec intelligitis quanto id vestro detrimento audeatis. Nam si illi qui virtutem sequuntur avari, libidinosi, ambitiosiq; sunt; quid vos estis quibus ipsum nomen virtutis odio est? Negatis quenquam pr aestare quae loquitur, nec ad exemplar orationis suae vivere. Quid mirum? cum loquantur fortia ingentia, omnes humanas tempestates evadentia: cum refigere se crucibus conentur, in quas unusquisque vestrum clavos suos ipse adjicit. Non praestant Philosophi quae loquuntur, multa tamen praestant quod loquuntuor; quod honesta mente concipiunt. Nam si et paria dictis agerent, quid esset illis beatius? Interim non est quod contemnas bona verba, et bonis cogitationibus plena praecordia studiorum salutarium, etiam citra affectum laudanda tractatio est. Quid mirum si non ascendunt in altum? Arduos aggressus virtutis suscipe: etiam si decidunt magna conantur. Generosa res est, respicientem non ad suas, sed ad naturae suae vires, conari alta, tentare, et mente majora concipere, quam quae etiam ingenti animo adornatis effici possint. Qui hoc facere proponet, volet, tentabit, ad deos iter faciet; ne ille, etiamsi non tenuerit, magnis tamen excidet ausis. Vos quidem qui virtutem cultoremq; ejus odistis, nihil novi facitis. Nam et solem lumina aegra formidant, et aversantur diem splendidum nocturna animalia, qui ad primum ejus ortum stupent; et latibula sua passim petunt, abduntur in aliquas rimas, timida lucis. Gemite, et infaelicem linguam bonorum exercete convicio. Instate, commordete, citius multo frangetis dentes quam imprimetis . It is true that the best of all Gods children have their weaknesses, their passions and infirmities , which they cannot wholly conquer whiles they continue here; they have flesh in them as well as spirit , which sometimes shewes itselfe; they have a dying body of sinne within them , which though it raignes not in them as a King , yet sometimes it overmasters them in some particular actions as a tyrant; insomuch as they cannot doe the good they would, and the evil that they would not that they doe : But yet this frees them from hypocrisie. First, that they unfainedly desire and endeavour to mortifie all their sinnes and lusts, and to be freed from them . Secondly, they utterly abominate and detest their sinnes, continually watching, fighting, praying against them, and labouring to destroy them . Thirdly, when they fall into any sinne of infirmity out of humane frailty, they condemne and judge themselves for it; it is their greatest griefe and shame, and they goe mourning for it all their dayes , loathing and abhorring themselves because they have thus offended . Fourthly, they become more vigilant against their sins and frailties for the time to come, binding themselves by solemne vowes and covenants never to relapse into them more , crying mightily unto God for strength to resist, and power to subdue them . Fifthly, they allow not themselves in one knowne sinne whatsoever; they sinne not so frequently, in that manner as others doe , keeping themselves innocent for the most part from great offences, and notorious sinnes , in which those who most condemne them wallow. Lastly, they leade farre holier and stricter lives than other men, they serve and honour God more than they ; they love and feare God more than others, being farre more frequent, more constant in hearing, reading, prayer, meditation, fasting, and all holy duties , than those who declaime against them most; and yet they desire, they endeavour to be better and holier every day . Therefore they are no hypocrites, as all Antipuritans for the most part are; who professe themselves Christians as well as Puritans, and yet live like Pagans, like Infidels in grosse notorious sinnes, without any shame or sorrow for them, or any warre against them, endeavouring not to grow better than they are. For the second part of the Objection; that Puritans and Precisians are seditious, factious, troublesome, rebellious persons and enemies both to state and government: and that this onely is the cause why they are so much hated, persecuted, reviled. I answer, that this is an ancient scandall which hath beene alwayes laid upon the choycest Saints of God from age to age; wherefore we may the lesse wonder at it now. For did not Pharaoh long agoe, thus censure Moses and Aaron, and thereupon drove them out of his presence as factious persons who did let the people from their worke, and stirre them up to mutinie ? Did not King Ahab accuse the holy Prophet Eliyah as a troubler of Israel, when as it was onely himselfe and his fathers house that did disquiet it ? anddid he not hate and imprison the good Prophet Micaiah as an enemie to him and his proceedings, because he alwayes prophecied truth unto him, and would not flatter him in his ungodly courses and humours ? Did not that wicked favourite Haman, accuse the whole Nation of the Iewes to King Ahasuerus, that their lawes were diverse from all people, that they kept not the Kings lawes, and that it was not for the Kings profit to suffer them; and thereupon procure the Kings Letters to the Lieutenants and Governours of the people, that they might be destroyed ? Did not Rehum and Shimshai write letters to King Axtaxerxes against Hierusalem of purpose to hinder the building of it out of their malice to the pious Iewes: that it was a rebellious and a bad Citie, and hurtfull unto Kings and provinces, and that they had moved sedition of old time in the middest thereof, for which cause it was destroyed: informing the King withall, that if the walls thereof were set up againe, they would not then pay toll, tribute and custome, and so the Kings revenue should be endammaged ? and did not Sanballat send his servant to Nehemiah with an open letter in his hand, wherein it was written; it is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Iewes thinke to rebell, for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou maist be their King? &c . Was not the Prophet Ieremy persecuted and imprisoned by the high Priest, the Princes and all the people, for a man of strife and contention to the whole earth; as a professed enemie both to the King, the State, and all the people, for no other cause but this, that he faithfully delivered those displeasing messages which God enjoyned him to proclaime against them for their sinnes ? Did not Amaziah the Priest of Bethel accuse the Prophet Amos to King Ieroboam, for conspiring against him in the middest of the house of Israel, and that the land was not able to beare his words ? Which scandalous accusation not succeding, did hee not thereupon advise him, to flee into the land of Iudah, and to eate bread and prophecie there; charging him like an Episcopall controller, not to prophecie any more at Bethel, for it was the Kings Chappell, and the Kings Court , where he would have no faithfull Prophets, no truth-telling sinne-rebuking Chaplaines come who knew not how to flatter. Did not the governours who conspired together against the Prophet Daniel, put in this information against him to King Darius, that he neither regarded him nor his decree which hee had signed ; accusing him of disobedience; faction and opposition to his lawes and royall authority? Yea was not our blessed Saviour himselfe, though he payed tribute to C aesar, injoyning all his followers , to give unto C aesar the things that were Caesars ; being as free from all sedition or rebellion against Princes as from all other sinnes; accused, condemned as a seditious Anti-monarchicall person? Did not the whole multitude of the people with the chiefe Priests and Scribes accuse him before Pilate, saying; We found this fellow perverting the Nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C aesar, saying, that he himselfe was Christ a King? and did not they thereupon cry out against Pilate when as he sought to have released him, saying, if thou let this man goe, thou art not C aesars friend, for he speaketh against Caesar ? And if our most innocent Saviour were burthened with these most false and scandalous reproaches of sedition, faction, treason and rebellion against C aesar ; no wonder if none of all his followers can be exempted from these calumnies: For if they have thus falsely called the Master of the house Belzebub, how much more will they stile those of his houshold so? the Disciple not being above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord ; as himselfe doth argue in this very case. To confirme this further by some other pregnant examples. Was not St. Paul himselfe, together with all the Disciples and beleeving Christians both at Philippi and Thessalonica, accused by the Iewes and other lewd companions, as men who did exceedingly trouble the Citty, and teaching new customes which it was not lawfull for men either to receive or observe? that did all contrary to the decrees of C aesar, and that they had turned the whole world upside-downe, insomuch that their sect was every where spoken against ? Did not the Iewes cry out against this most laborious Apostle St. Paul , saying Men and brethren helpe; this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place, and hath likewise defiled this holy place; and did not all the people thereupon lay violent hands upon him, intending to put him to death, as a most seditious factious person . Yea did not Tertullus the Iewish Orator, accuse him before Felix, and the high Priests & Pharisees traduce him before Festus, for a pestilent fellow, a mover of sedition among all the Iews throughout the world, & a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarens ? And yet who so free from sedition, faction, rebellion or discord, as this most blessed Apostle; who commandeth every soule to be subject to the higher powers : to obey those who have the rule over them, and to submit unto them even out of conscience sake ? who exhorts all men to make supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings for Kings and all that are in authority: to keepe the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace: to marke those who cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine they had received, and to avoid them : blaming the Corinthians for their dissentions . Besides this doth not St. Peter informe us; that albeit the Christians in his time had their conversation honest among the Gentiles, submitting themselves to their Governours, Kings and lawfull ordinances for the Lords sake; yet the Gentiles were alwayes speaking against them as evill doers, and falsly accusing their good conversation in Christ, as if they were nought but seditious factious people, and rebels or enemies to Governours and government ? To passe by many notable texts of Scripture which ratifie this notorious truth ; Doe not Tertullian , Arnobius , Lactantius , Iustin Martyr , Minutius Felix , St. Chrysostome , with all Ecclesiasticall Historians, both ancient and moderne , expresly informe us, that the primitive Christians (who were oft nicknamed by the ignominious titles of Galileans, Sibyllists, Impostors, Greekes, Sarmentisij, Semassij, Biothonati, Magitians , Ioannites , and the like, as they are now derided under the names of Puritans and Precisians) though they were never detected of any treason, rebellion, mutinie, or sedition whatsoever (the case of those whom men stile Puritans and Precisians now:) yet they were alwayes slandered, accused, traduced, persecuted as refractory, seditious, factious, mutineers; as enemies and rebels to the Emperours and Governours under which they lived, and as the authors of all the mischiefes and troubles that hapned in the world; by which false pestilent suggestions in the eares of Princes, continuall bloody persecutions were raised up against these innocent lambes, who had no other offensive or defensive armes, but prayers and teares : and doe not the Century-Authors thence conclude eve for our present times; Solenne est ut Christianis crimina seditionis, blasphemi ae, et lesae majestatis a persecutoribus affingantur, quibus tamen non sunt obnoxij ? Doe we not likewise reade, that Athanasius , Basil , Nazianzen , Chrysostome, with sundry other ancient sinne- reproving, error-confuting Bishops were accused of faction and sedition for opposing the sinnes and vices of the times ? and was not our owne worthy Bishop Latimer , with other pious Martyrs, accused, slandered as raisers of sedition, as factious, turbulent, and seditious persons, by those whose sinnes and errours they reproved, and that even in good King Edward the 6 his dayes ? Survey wee all the Fathers, all Ecclesiasticall Stories, we shall finde poore innocent peaceable harmelesse conscionable Christians in all times and places, maliciously slaundered with the crimes of sedition, faction, rebellion, disobedience to Princes and their lawes, of purpose to make them odious both to Prince and people, even without a cause; they being but as lambes in the very midst of wolves . And is it any wonder then that Puritans and Precisians should suffer the very selfesame calumnies now? Alas what powder treasons, what conspiracies have these poore Play-condemning Puritans and Precisians hatched against King or State? what rebellions have they raised? what publike uprores have they ever caused from the beginning of reformation till this present? what treacheries, what mutinies are they guilty of, that they are thus condemned, as if they were as bad or worse than Papists, Priests or Iesuites , (for so some affirme;) whose very faith is faction, whose doctrine rebellion, and their practise Treason ? Certainly were these whom the dissolutenesse of the times now brand for Puritans and Precisians, though every way conformable to our Churches discipline, such rebels, factionists, mutineers, disobedient antimonarchicall persons as the world conceives them, as Papists, Priests, Iesuites, prophane & dissolute companions proclaim the for to be, we should have seene some fruits, experiments and detections of it ere this . But blessed be God, we have heard of no Puritan treasons, insurrections or rebellions in our age; and experience (in despite of scandall and all lying rumours) hath manifested, that these Puritans and Precisians are such persons as both feare God and honour the King , though they oppugne the corruptions, sinnes, profanesse, and Popish and Pelagian Errors of the times, with all such factious Innovators who either broach new heresies and superstitions, or revive olde. As for their loyalty to their Prince, his power and prerogative, it is so apparant, that however Papists and persons popishly affected, now slander them as enemies to Monarchie and Princes Prerogatives in words, (to take off this merited imputation from themselves ) yet they blame them even under the very name of Puritans , as over-great advancers and chiefest patriots and propugners of Monarchy, of Princes supremacy , in their printed workes ; none going so farre in suppressing the Popes usurped Authority, or enlarging the Kings and temporall Magistrates prerogatives and supremacy as they, as even the Iesuite in his Answer to Deus et Rex , hath proclaimed unto all the world. Let therefore the Moguntine Iesuites Contzen disciples, (following the desperate plot of their Master, to cheat a Protestant Church of her religion, and to scrue in Popery into it by degrees without noyse or tumult, by raising slaunders upon the Doctrines and persons of the most zealous Protestant Ministers and Protestants, to bring them into the Princes , and peoples hatred, and thrust them out of office ) accuse Puritans of faction, sedition and rebellion now, without any ground or proofe at all as the Pagans did the Christians long agoe: or let the Epicures and prophane ones of our voluptuous times repute them such, because they wage warre against their sinnes and sinfull pleasures : yet now upon the serious consideration of all these premises, I hope their consciences will acquit them of these malicious slaunders, and readily subscribe to this apparant truth, that they are the holiest, meekest, and most zealous Christians, and that they are onely hated and reviled for their goodnesse. Since therefore these Play-censuring conformable Puritans and Precisians in their proper colours (uncased of these odious persecuted termes of scandall, which represent them to mens fansies in a most ugly forme ; there being never poore persecuted word, since malice against God first seized upon the damned Angels, and the graces of heaven dwelt in the heart of man, that passed through the mouthes of all sorts of unregenerate men with more distastfulnesse and gnashing of teeth, than the name of Pvritan doth at this day: which notwithstanding as it is now commonly meant, and ordinarily proceedes from the spleene and spirit of prophanesse and good fellowshippe, is an honourable nickename of Christianity and grace ; as a worthy reverend Divine observes:) are the very eminentest, choicest, and most gracious forward Christians, let us not thinke the better, but farre worse of Stage-playes, because they all abominate, condemne them , as all good Christians have done before them: and if any have thus persecuted, hated, or reviled them out of ignorance or malice heretofore, let them heartily bewaile it, and give over now, because it is not onely a kinde of sacriledge, but even an high indignity and affront to God himselfe, to hate, to slaunder, persecute or wrong his servants, especially for controlling us in our delights of sinne, of which these constantly condemned Stage-playes are the chiefe . And for a close of this Objection, and Scene together, let us all remember that worthy sentence of St. Hierom : Apud Christianos, ut ait quidam, non qui patitur, sed qui facit contumeliam, miser est : and then these malicious calumnies against Puritans and Precisians will quickly vanish. Yov have seene now Christian Readers, the severall arguments and Authorities against Stage-playes, together with the slender Apologies for them, which how poore, how illiterate and weake they are, the very meanest capacity may at first discerne. I beseech you therefore by the very mercies of God , as you tender the glorie of Almighty God; the honour and credit of religion; the happinesse and safety both of Church and State; the serious covenant you have made to God in baptisme; to forsake the Divell and all his workes, the pompes and vanities of this wicked world, with all the sinfull lusts of the flesh; whereof Stage-playes certainly are not the least : as you regard that solemne Confession you have publikely made to God, and ratified in the very sacred blood of the Lord Iesus Christ, at every receiving of the Sacrament; that you doe earnestly repent, and are heartily sorrie for all your misdoings; that the remembrance of them is grievous unto you; the burthen of them intollerable; and that you will ever hereafter serve and please God in newnesse of life, to the honour and glory of his name : offering and presenting unto the Lord your selves, your soules and bodies to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto him : or as you respect your owne, or others soules, whom your evill examples may leade downe to hell : that upon the serious perusall of all the premises, you would now at last abominate and utterly abandon Stage-playes, as the very fatall pests both of your mindes and manners, and the most desperate soothing enemies of your soules, as all ages, all places have found the by experience . It may be some of you through ignorance and incogitancy have formerly had good opinions and high thoughts of Playes and Players, (as being altogether unacquainted with their infernall originall, and most lewd effects, which I have here displayed to the full , and that made you so diligently to frequent them:) Let not this then which was only the sin of ignorance of weaknesse heretofore, become the sinne of wilfulnesse, or presumption now : but as God by these my poore endeavours hath opened your eyes to see, so doe you pray unto him for strength and grace, to reforme your ancient errour in this case of Playes. Repent therefore with teares of griefe, for what is past ; and then speedily divorce your selves from Playes and Theaters for time to come; that as your consciences upon the serious perusall of all the premises, cannot but now subscribe to this strange Paradox, (as some may deeme it) which I have here made good: That all popular and common Stage-playes, whether Comicall, Tragicall, Satyricall, Mimicall, or mixt of either: (especially as they are now compiled and personated among us) are such sinfull, hurtfull, pernicious recreations, as are altogether unseemely, yea unlawfull unto Christians : so the lives and practise likewise may say Amen unto it. So shall you then obtaine the intended benefit, and I my selfe enjoy the much-desired end of these my weake Endeavours, which was, which is no other, but Gods owne glory, your temporall and eternall happinesse, and the Republickes welfare: For which as I have hitherto laboured, so I shall now by Gods assistance proceede to endeavour it in the ensuing part of this Play-scourging Discourse; wch now craves your favour and attention too. unseemly, unlawfull unto Christians, as I have at large evinced in the precedent part of this my Histrio-mastix, I shall thence inferre these 3. ensuing Corollaries which necessarily issue from it. First, That the profession of a Play-poet, or the composing of Comedies, Tragedies or such like Playes for publike Players or Play-houses, is altogether infamous and unlawfull. Secondly, That the very profession of a Stage-player, together with the acting of Playes and enterludes, either in publike theaters or private houses; is infamous, Scandalous, and no wayes lawfull unto Christians. Thirdly: That it is an infamous shamefull, and unlawfull practise for Christians to be either spectators or frequenters of Playes or Play-houses. In briefe; the very penning, acting and beholding of Stage-playes, are infamous, unseemly, unlawfull unto Christians, since Playes themselves are so. To begin with the first of these; I shall for the better clearing of its truth and the avoyding of all mistakes, most willingly acknowledge. First, that as Poetrey it selfe is an excellent endowmet, peculier unto some by a kind of naturall Genius ; so it is likewise lawfull, yea usefull and commendable among Christians , if rightly used: as not onely the divine hymmes recorded in Scripture, together with the famous ancient Po ems of Tertullian, Arator, Apollinaris, Nazianzen, Prudentius, Prosper , and other Christian worthies, with the moderne Distiques of Dubartas, Beza, Scaliger, Bucanon, Heinsius, Withars, Hall, Quarles , our late Soveraigne King Iames , with infinite others; but likewise the much applauded verses of Homer, Pindarus, Virgil, Statius, Silius Italicus, Lucan, Claudian, Horace, Iuuenall , and some parts of Ovid , where he is not obscene, most plentifully evidence; whose Po ems are both approved, read, & highly magnified of all learned Christias, who both allow & teach them in their publike Schooles. Yea, were not Poetrie and Poets Lawfull, we must then rase out of our Bibles. Acts 17\. 28. 1 Cor . 15. 33. Titus 1\. 12, 13, where the sentences of Menander, Epimenides, and Aratus , three heathen Poets are not only recited but Canonized too. If any desire any further satisfaction in this point which is so cleare, I shall onely referre them to Tertullian ad Vxorem lib. 1\. to St. Basil, de legendis libris Gentilium Oratio: to Nicephorus Callistus Ecclesiastic ae Historae l . 10. c , 26. to the ancient  & moderne Commetators on these texts; to Georg Alley Bishop of Exeter, his poore mans Librarie part 1\. Misellanea Pr aelectionis 4\. pag. 165. 166. & D. Rainolds Overthrow of Stage playes p. 21, 22. who will abundantly satisfie them in this poynt. Secondly, that it is lawfull to compile a Poeme in nature of a Tragedie, or poeticall Dialogue, with severall acts and parts, to adde life and luster to it, especially, in case of necessitie when as truth should else be suffocated. Hence Nicephorus and Cassiodor record of Apolinaris the Elder, that being inhibited by Iulian the Apostate to Preach or teach the Gospell, or to traine the christians children to learning and poetrie, he thereupon translated divers Bookes of Scripture into verse, and composed divers Tragedies in imitation of Euripides, and sundry Comedies and lyricke verses in imitation of Menander and Pindarus, consisting only of divine arguments and Scripture stories; by which he instructed those to whom he could have no liberty to Preach : the like did Gregory Nazianzen and others in the Primitive Church , upon the same occasion, having no other meanes to defendor propagate religion with approbation or connivance but by such Po ems as these. Hence divers pious Christians likewise in King Henry the 8. and Queene Maries bloudy raigne, being restrained by Superiour Popish powers to oppose received errors or propagate the truth and Doctrine of the Gospell in publike Sermons, or polemicall positiue treatises, did covertly vent and publish sundry truthes, yea censure sundry Errors, and interpret divers scriptures in Rimes, in Comedies, Tragedies, & Poems like to Playes under the names, the persons of others, whom they brought in discoursing of sundry points of true religion, which could not else bee Preached but by such Poems as these, which the people gladly heard and read, and the Magistrates and popish Priestes conived at at first; till at last King Henry the 8. by the statute of 34 & 35\. H. 8. c . 1. and Queene Marie by her expresse Proclamation in the first yeare of her raigne (which the popish Prelates did most strictly execute) Prohibited the setting forth or penning of any songs, Playes, Rimes, or Enterludes, which medled with interpretations of Scripture, contrary to the doctrine established in their raignes . Wherefore I shall here approve & not condemn, the ancient Tragedy stiled, Christus passus falsly attributed to Nazianzen wherein Christs passion is elegantly descyphered, together with Bernardinus Ochin his Tragedy of Freewil, Plessie Morney his Tragedie of Ieptha his daughter , Edward the 6. his Comedie de meretrice Babilonica, Iohn Bale his Comedies de Christo & de Lazare, Skeltons Comedies, de Virtute, de Magnificentia, & de bono Ordine, Nicholaus Grimoaldus, de Archiprophetae Tragedia , &c. which like Geffry Chaucers & Pierce the Plowmans tales and Dialogues, were penned only to beread, not acted, their subiects being al serious, sacred, divine, not scurrilous wanton or prophan, as al modern Play po ems are. Thirdly, as it is lawfull to pen, so likewise to recite, to read such tragicall or comicall poems as these , composed onely to be read, not acted on the Stage. And in truth the Tragedies, Comedies and Play-poems of ancient times, as those of Sophocles, Euripedes, Æschylus, Menander, Seneca , and others, were onely read or recited by the Poets themselves , or some others of their appointment before the people, not acted on the Stage by Players, as now they are; it being a great disparagement to Poets to have their Po ems acted , as Horace Diodorus Siculus and Quintilian testifie. That these ancient Comedies and Tragedies were thus read or recited onely, not played or acted on the Stage, is evident by the expresse testimonies of Horace: Sermo: l. 1. Satyr. 4. & 10, Epist. l. 2. Epist. 1. & de Arte Poetica lib . of Iuuenall, Satyr. 1. 4. & 8\. of Diodorus Siculus. Bibl. hist l. 14. sect. 110. p. 649, 650 . of Plutarch, de Audiendis Poetis lib . of Plinie: Epist: l. 1. Epist: 13. Epist: l. 2. Epist. 10. l, 3. Epist: 15. 18. l. 5. Epist. 3. l. 7. Epist. 17. l. 8. Epist. 21. l. 9. Epist. 27 . Of Suetonius in his Octauius sect. 89 . Of Quintilian de Oratoribus Dialogus: 1. 6. 14. of Polydor Virgil, de Invent. rerum, l. 3. c. 13 . of Scaliger Poeticis l. 1. c. 7. of Dr. Reinolds in his Overthrow of Stageplayes p. 22. of Bulengerus de Theatro. l. 2. c. 1. p. 339\. A. B. with sundry others , who all give testimony to this truth. Which takes of one grand obiection that Players, and Play-poets make to iustifie the Acting, and penning of Stage-playes; that many good men have compiled Playes and Tragedies in former times; of purpose that they might be acted on the Theatre; when as in truth these Playes of theirs were never acted but recited onely, they being composed for Readers, not Spectators, for private studies, not publike Playhouses, as our present Stageplayes are. The sole controversie then is this; Not whether it bee simply unlawfull to penne a Poem in nature of a Tragedie or Comedie, which may be done without offence, in case it be pious, serious, good and profitable; not wanton amorous, obscene, Prophane, or heathenish, as most Playes are now: but, whether the profession of a Playhouse-Poet, or the penning of Playes for publike or private Theaters, be warrantable or lawfull ? And for my owne particular opinion, I hold it altogether unlawfull, for these ensuing reasons. First, to be an inventer, a contriver of evill, scandalous, unprofitable or noxious things, is certainely unlawfull unto Christians: witnesse Rom. 1. 30, 31. Psal. 31. 6. Eccles: 7. 29. Prov. 14. 22. c . 24. 8. and Isay. 55. 2. But Stage-playes (as I havealready manifested at larg) are evil, scandalous, unprofitable, noxious pastimes yea intolerable mischeifes both in a Church or State. Therefore the inventing and contriving of them must certainely be unlawfull. Secondly, to be a compiler, an Author of the certaine, the common occasions of much wickendesse, sin and lewdnesse, can be no wayes warrantable or lawfull: as is evident by by the 1 Thes. 5. 22. 2 Sam . 12. 14. and Rom . 1. 30. But Stage playes (as the premises testifie) are the certaine, the common occasions of much wickedesse, vice and lewdnesse: Yea Play-poets and Play-po ems if Cornelius Agrippa may be credited, are the very greatest entisements to all lecherie, bauderie, vice, and lewdnesse: Vnde Poet ae inter lenones principatum facile obtinuerunt, quo suis lasciuis rithmis alijsq; fabulis ac amatorijs bucolicis, praeceptiunculis, comaedijsque ex penitissimis Veneris armarijs depromptis lasciuis carminibus, lenocinio functa, pudicitiam omnem subuertit, ac adolescentiae bonam indolem, moresque corrumpit . Therefore to be an Author, a compiler of Stageplayes, can bee no wayes warrantable or lawfull unto Christians. Thirdly: To foment men in their sinnes and sinfull courses, to uphold them in their ungodly professions, is without all scruple sinfull and unlawfull: witnesse 1 Tim. 5.22. Hab. 1.15, 16. Ezech. 13. 18, 19, 20 . But the penning of Playes for Play-houses, foments men in their sinnes  & sinfull courses: It fostereth the spectators in their idlenesse, vanity, wantonesse, ribaldry, prodigality, lewdnesse, and the like; it drawes them on to many other sinnes, which else they might eschewe: It supports all publike Actors in their graceles, infamous, ungodly, lewd profession of Acting, and others in their sinfull practise of beholding Stage-playes: if there were no new Playes to act or see, all Players, all Play-haunters would quickly vanish, the Play-poet being the prime mover in this infernal sphere of lewdnesse. Therefore the penning of Playes for Play-houses, is without all question very unlawfull. Fourthly to be a professed factor for the Devill and his instruments; to maintaine his pomps  & vanities which we have all renounced in Baptisme, is sinfull and abominable: as the 1 Pet. 5\. 8, 10. I Ioh. 3. 8. Ephes. 2. 1, 2. c. 5. 11.  & Ioh. 8. 44. infalliblie evidence. But Stage-poets are professed factors for the Devill and his instruments who are most honoured & delighted with them, now as well as heretofore ) and they maintaine (yea forge and pen) the very pompes and workes of the Divell which we have all renouced in Baptisme; for I have infalliblie proved Stageplays (which they so seriously compile) to be the Devills pomps which wee protest against in Baptisme : Therefore the profession of a Play-poet even in this respect, is sinfull and abominable. Fiftly for men to wast their wits, their parts and precious time (with which they might and ought to doe God and men good service) on amorous, filthy, wanton, ridiculous, vaine, prophane, unprofitable, subiects, which tend not to Gods glorie, to the good of men, or the peace and comfort of their owne soules at last; is altogether unlawfull, see Isay. 55. 2. Psal. 7. 6. Psal. 4. 2. I Sam. 12. 21. 2 Cor. 5. 15. Rom. 12. 1, 2. I Cor 6.20. & 10\. 31, 32, 33. Eccles. 5. 16. Luk. 1. 74, 75. 2 Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12 . for proofe of this proposition.) But those who penne Playes for the Stage; doe wast their wits, their parts and precious time, (with which they ought to do God & men good service) on amarous, filthy, wanton, ridiculous, vaine, prophane, unprofitable, (yea sometimes on atheisticall, blasphemous, sacrilegious, diabolicall, detestable ) subiects, (for such for the most part, are all our moderne Playes ) which tend not to Gods honor but to his great dishonour, and the Devils advantage: which bring no good at all, but exceeding much hurt and mischeife unto others : and no comfort, no peace, but horror and vexation onely to the soules of their composers, who have oft beene so terrified with the sad consideration of those infinite horid sinnes which their Stage-playes have produced both in themselves and others, that it hath almost driven them to despaire, and drenched their soules in floods of brinish teares to wash away their guilt of Play-making: as the memorable example of Steven Gosson, and the Author of the third Blast, of retrait from, Playes and Theaters, besides a more bloody fresh example, most fully testifie . Therefore the penning of Playes for the Stage is altogether unlawfull. 6 Sixtly; for men to bend their wits like bows for lyes, and lying fables, to corrupt and misrepresent true histories, and to make their braine a very forge for lying vanities, and old-wives fables; is certainly unlawfull among Christians, who must put away lying fables, and speake nought but truth: See Ephes. 4. 25, 29. c. 5. 3, 4. 1 Tim. 4. 2, 7. and part 1\. Act 3. Scene 4. p. 106, 107 . accordingly. But Play- poets thus racke and bend their wits like bowes for lyes and lying fables; they corrupt and misrepresent true histories, and make their braines a very forge for lying vanities and old wives Fables: witnes Act 3. Scene 4. p. 106, 107 . with the Authors there quoted: witnesse the common prouerbiall speech Permulta canunt mendacia vates , that Play-poets broach verie many lies, that being no Po em in Socrates his iudgement, a qua abesset mendacium , in which there is not some lye or other couched: witnes Solon who prohibited Thespis either to act or teach Tragedies, inutilem eas falsi loquentiam vocans) because they were but unprofitable lyes , or vaine common thridbare fabulous figments of Stage-poets extolling vaine & idle things , with many words, as Philo Iud aeus phraseth them. witnesse, the 3. Blast of Retrait from stage-playes , p. 104. which informes us: That the notablest liar is become the best Poet: and that he who can make the most notorious lye, and disguise falshood in such sort, that it may passe unperceived, is held the best writer, for the strangest Comedie brings greatest delectation and pleasure . Yea witnesse our own experience, our moderne Playes being nought but amorous ridiculous figments, lies & vanities, or sophisticated stories . The penning therfore of such stories as these must needs be ill. Seventhly: that profession, or action, which hath no good warrant either from the practise of the Saints; or from the word of God, the square of all our lives and waies, and in the prosecution of which a man cannot proceed with faith, or comfort, nor yet seriously pray for, or expect a blessing from God; must questionles be unwarantable, unlawfull for a Christian: witnesse, Gal. 5. 16, 17, 18. c. 6. 15. Psal. 119. 9. 104, 105. Rom. 14. 23. 1 Cor. 11. 1. Ehes. 5. 1, 5. Psal. 129. 7, 8. 9. phil. 4. 6, 7, 8 . But the profession of a Play-poet, and the composing of Playes for Theaters, hath no warant at all either from the practise of the Saints of God among whom we read of no professed Playpoets or Players of ancient or moderne times, but such onely who upon their true conversion & repentence renounced this their hellish lewd profession : nor yet from the sacred word of God, the square of all our lives and wayes; in which I cannot so much as find one title, one syllable to iustifie either the penning or acting of a Stage-play: so that a man cannot proceed on in them either with faith or comfort, nor yet expect or pray for Gods blessing or assistance on his Playes or Studies, which serve onely to advance the Divills service, and foment mens lusts and vices . Therefore the very profession of a Play-poet, and the compiling of Playes for Theaters, must questionlesse be unwarrantable, unlawfull for a Christian. Lastly, that very profession  & function which Christians, which heathens, which even relenting Play-poets themselves have censured, renounced, condemned, as sinfull and abominable; must undoubtedly bee unlawfull for a Christian: But Christians, heathens, yea and Play-poets themselves have thus censured, renounced, condemned the profession of a Playpoet, and the making of Playes to furnish Play-houses. Witnesse all the fore-quoted Fathers Councels and Christian Writers, who in condemning Playes, have censured their composers, not onely by consequence, but in expresse termes too . Witnesse the Athenians, and Solon, who inhibited the penning of Comedies and Tragedies: together with Plato & Tullie, who banished all Playpoets out of their Republikes, as the effeminaters, the corrupters of mens minds and manners, leading them on to a dissolute, sloathfull, vitious, voluptuous life: Witnesse the Lacedemonians, & Massilienses, who would never admit the penning or acting of Comedies or Tragedies ; together with Gorgias Horace and Iuuenall , who condemne the composing of Playes for the Stage, as a base unworthy thing, unfit for eminent Poets : Yea witnesse the constant practise of all Players and Play-poets in the primitive Church, who upon their true conversion to the faith, renounced these their lewde ungodly professions, and never returned to them more : together with the moderne examples of Æ naeas Sylvius, and Theodorus Beza , who publikely renounced, censured, and bewailed in their riper yeares those wanton amorous playes and poems which they had compiled in their youth; of M. Stephen Gosson, & the Authour of the 3. Blast of retrait from playes and Theaters ; two Eminent English Play poets Who being deepely wounded in conscience for those Playes they had penned for the Stage, thereupon abandoned this, their hellish trade of Play-penning, as incompatible with Christianity or salvation, and by way of holy recompence and revenge, compiled three memorable printed Treatises against penning, acting and frequenting Stage-playes , which now are extant to their eternall praise, and to the just condemnation of all those Playpoets which persevere in their relented and reclaimed steps. The penning therefore of Stage-playes for the Theater (which hath no precept, no example for to warrant it in the Scripture or in the Primitive Church) must certainely be sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. All which I would wish our moderne Play-poets to consider. Who being oft times men of eminent parts, and choysest wits, able pithily to expresse what ever they undertake: I shall onely say of them and their po ems as Quintilian doth of Seneca & his books, Mult ae in eo claraeq; sententiae, multa etiam Elocutionis gratia legenda; sed in eloquendo corrupta plaeraq;, atq; adeo perniciosissima, quod abundant vitijs. Velles exim suo ingenio dixisse, alieno iudicio, &c. Digna fuit illa naturae quae meliora vellet, quae quod voluit fecit . And thus much for the first conclusion. I proceed now to the second Corollary, That the very professio of a Stageplayer, & the acting of Stageplays is base and infamous, yea sinfull and unlawfull among Christians . First, for the infamie of Stage-players and play-acting, it may be evidenced by these examples. First, they were infamous even among Pagans and Infidells: Witnesse the ancient pagan Romanes, who adiudged all Actors, all Stage-players infamous persons; & thereupon excluded the their temples, disfranchised them their tribs, as unworthy of their stock or kinred, disabling them both to inherit lands as heires to their parents, or to beare any publike office in the common wealth: as Livie Cicero , Valerius Maximus , Æ milius Probus Tacitus , Macrobius Suetonius , Gellius , Iuvenall , Tertullian , Arnobius , Augustine Cassiodorus , Tostatus , Agrippa , Alexander ab Alexandre , Gothofrede , Arius Montanus , C aelius Rhodiginus , Barnabas Brissonius , Bud aeus , Dr. Rainol as , and infinite others testifie. Hence Nerva & Pegasus pronouncea all such infamous, qui quaestus causa in certamina discendunt, et propter praemium in Scenam prodeunt: Hence also Pr aetoris verba dicunt: infamia not atur qui artis Ludicrae pronunciandiue causa in Scenam prodierit. Infames sunt qui comicam artem exercent : which extends as well to voluntary as hired actors. And hence even by the Municipall Lawes of the ancient heathen Romans as Vlpian & other Civillians informe us, all stageplayers and Actors were infamous persons; and so disabled to beare testimony, to inherit lands, or to receive any publicke place of honour in the Common-weale . And as these Romans, even so the Pagan Grecians too (who honoured Stage- players at the first) reputed the infamous at the last, as Chrysostom Volateranus , together with Plato & Aristotle informe us, and Agesilaus his answer to Callipedes implies. Secodly, as they were thus infamous among Pagans , so much more are they among Christians, as both Councels Fathers , Civilians , Canonists , Casuists , Schoolmen , Historians Divines, unanimously testifie : Heare but Arias Montanus for all the rest, who informes us in expresse termes, that publicke dauncing or acting of playes for money or sport, is condemned as base, infamous, and unworthy any ingenuous person, not only by Scripture & reason, but almost by all humane laws. Et vocari fecerunt (saith he) Simsonem ex domo vinctoru &c. nec ad digniorem et honestiorem agendam rem, quam ad ridiculum atque turpe de se spectaculum saltandrop abendum inimicis, principibus, ac populo. Qui legit intelligat; publice saltantes, et huiusmodi spectaculorum personas, turpitudinis atque infami ae nota inustas, et ratio ipsa, et antiqua jura fere omnia volunt, divina vero lex minim e admittenda, sensuit, in vulgaribus etiam ac vilibus capitibus, nedum in honestioris ordinis atque census viris: neque vero tantum vltro non quaerenda & optanda, sed nec si inuitis fuerint illata, ferenda esse censet &c. Certe qui de virtute vera, deque corruptis hominum moribus prudenter locuti sunt, hujus generis actiones ingenuo homine iudignissimas duxerunt, vt ille de Nerone . In Scena nunquam cantavit Orestes, H aec opera, atque hae sunt generosi principis artes, Gaudentis patrio peregrina aut pulpita saltus Prostitui, Grai aeque apium meruisse coronae? Which passage of his extends as well to Masquers, or Academical voluntary Actors, as to common stage-players, they being both alike infamous in this Authors judgement. How great this infamy of Actors was among Christians in the primitive Church, and yet is, or at leastwise ought to be, with modern Christians, will appeare by these particulars. First, it excluded them from the Church, the Sacraments, & all Christian society, making them ipso facto excommunicated so long as they continued players, neither were they readmitted to the Church, til they had wholy relinquished & given over acting . Witnes the severe imperiall Edicts of Valentinian, Valens, and Gracian , against Male and Female Actors. Scenici & Scenicae qui in ultimo vitae necessitate cogente interitus imminentis ad Dei summi sacramenta properarunt, si fortassis evaserint, nulla posthac in Theatralis spectaculi conventione revocentur: Ante omnia tamen diligenti observatione tueri sanctione jubemus, ut ver e et in extremo periculo Constituti, id pro salute poscentes (si tamen antistites probant) beneficij consequantur. Quod vt fideliter fiat, statim eorums ad judices si in presenti sunt, vel curatores Vrbium singularum desiderium perferatur, Quod & inspectatoribus missis sedula exploratione quaeratur, an indulgeri his necessitas poscat extrema suffragia : which Edicts, exclude all Stage-players from the Sacrament , even when they lay vpon their death-beds, vnlesse they earnestly desired it, and manifested such sincere repentance for their play-acting, as might in the Magistrats or Ministers judgement prepare and fit them to receive it. Hence, Concilium Eliberinum. Can. 62. Concilium Arelatense 1. Can. 4,5. & 2\. Can. 20. Concil, Carthag. 4. Can. 88. Concil. Constantinopolitanum 6. Can. 24.51. Concil. Hipponense. Can, 35. Concil. Carthaginense. 3. Can. 35. Concilium Africanum. Can. 12.28. & Synodus Augustensis 1549. Can. 19. expressly decreed; that all Stage-players shall be excomunicated, and debarred from the sacrament till they gave over their profession, & that upon their repentance they should be admitted to the sacrament & reconciled to the Church . Hence Clemens Romanus. Constit. Apostol. l. 8. c. 38. Tertullian de Pudicita. c. 7. Cyprian Epist. l. 1. Epist. 10. Chrysostome Hom. 3. De Davide & Saule, Theodoret de Martyribus. lib.

Gratian Distinctio. 33. & 48\. & de Consecratione Distinctio . 2. expresly teach, that Sage-players are to continue excomunicated and excluded from the Eucharist, & all Christian society, till they abandon playes and acting.

Gosson in their Treatises against Stageplayes, Ioannis Mariana de spectaculis lib. with sundry other schoolemen, Canonists, and divines, expresly determine, that the Eucharist or Sacrament of our Saviours body and blood, ought not to be administred to Stageplayers, as long as they vse their detestable infamous unchristian art of acting playes, which excludes them from the Sacrament, not only of the Lords Supper, but of Baptisme too, no Players, no play-haunters being received into the Primitiue Church, or admitted to the Sacrament of Baptisme, till they had renounced their acting & beholding of stageplayes, as the very pompes and inventions of the Devill , as I haue elsewhere largely manifested. Such was, such is the notorious infamie of acting playes, as thus to exile men fro the Church, the Sacraments and all Christian society, and to make them Excommunicate ipso facto ; An infallible evidence of its great vnlawfullnes. Secondly, the acting of Playes, disables Players to receive any Sacred Orders, or Ecclesiasticall preferments whatsoever; no player being capable of any Ministeriall, or Episcopall function; hence Augustine de Ecclesiasticis Regulis cap . 20.  & out of him, Iuo Carnotensis & Gratian , conclude; Clericum non ordinandu qui aliquado in scena lusisse probatur : hence Hierom Epi. 83. Oceano, ca. 4. & Anselme in Epist. 1. ad Timotheum, c. 3. tom . 2. p. 356. write thus Non congruit, vt here in Amphitheatro, hodie in Ecclesia; vespere in circa, mane in altario: dudum fautor histrionum, nunc consecrator virginum . Hence Pope Gregorie the first, determines thus of Stageplayers Illos qui in Scena lusisse noscuntur non ordinandos censemus : all which extend to voluntary, as well as hired Actors. Hence Tostatus Abulensis informes vs, Histriones & qui adhaerent ijs sunt infames, nec possunt promoveri ad sacros Ordines . Hence Panormitan affirmes, Histriones non possunt promoveri ad clericatum etiam peracta p aenitentia, dummodo exercuerunt artem suam causa quaestus . Hence Stephanus de Costa , writes. Histriones infames sunt, nec possunt ad ordines promoveri . Hence Ioannes Bertochinus propounds this question. Qu aero an histrio possit elegi Episcopus ? & he resolves it thus: Respondeo quod non, neque post peractam p aenitentiam. Quinimo histrio non potest corpus Christi accipere, ratio est, quia est infamis notorie . Hence Antonius de Brutio avers: Histriones non possunt promoveri post p aenitentiam, quia infames, nisi Papa dispensarit : and he quotes Gratian distinctio. 51. & causa 4 Quaest . 1. to warrant it. All which Ioannis de Burgo our Countrey-man, thus seconds. Item mimi, histriones & hujusmodi non sunt ad ordines promovendi, nisi ex dispensatione Papae, quia sunt infames. Hoc intellige de his qui publice coram Populo faciunt aspectum sive Ludibrium sui corporis exercendo opus illud. Si autem in occulto aliquis saltaret, vel huiusmodi opus facere posset, nihil ominus post peractam poenitentiam potest ordinari. Vilitas enim person ae est causa quare tales ab ordinibus repelluntur : for which he quotes Extrauag. de vita est honestate Clericorum: cum decorum in glos . Inno :  &c. So that no academicall or private voluntary Actors by the cannon Law ought to be admitted to orders, before they have publikely repented and done some open pennance for this their private acting. The same we shall finde affirmed by Aluarus Pelagius: De Planctu Ecclesi ae. l.2. Artic.28. H. histriones (writes he) non promoventur ad clericatu : & in sundry other Canonists : Yea the Canon Law is so strict in this, that if any one married a woman actor, he could not be promoted to any ecclesiasticall living, or take orders upon him. Thirdly, the acting of Playes made Players so infamous, that they could giue no publike Testimony between man & man: witnesse Concil. Africanum[illeg.] Canon. 96. & Concil. Carthaginense. 7. Can. 2. here p.577. Ioanes Bertachinus Repertorij Moralis. pars. 2.p.669. Tit, histrio; Angelus De. Clauasio, Summa Angelica. Tit. Infamia Adulatio, Histrio, & Testis : with divers others. Fourthly, it made Players so execrablie infamous, that for a Christian woman to marrie a Stageplayer, was Excommunication ipso facto : witnes, Concilium Eliberinum, can . 67. here p.571. Fiftly, the infamie of players was such, that they might lawfully be disinherited by their parents, and so might Play-haunters too; histriones enim sunt infames &c. et qui adhaerent mimis et histrionibus possunt exheredari & c. as Tostatus informes us. Lastly, Such is the infamie of Play-acting, that our owne Statutes have branded Players with the stile of Rogues and vagabonds, making them liable to the stocks, the whipping post, and all other punishments to which Rogues are subject : Which Statutes if any Actors thinke over rigorous; let them remember that both Augustus C aesar , and Tiberius, two heathen Roman Emperours, made Stage players liable to the lash, or Bedles whip , (a punishment suitable to such base idle Rogues as they) When as it was altogether unlawfull for any ingenuous Roman to be scourged Act. 16. 37, 38. & 22\. 24, to 30. By all which Testimonies together with that passage of Tully concerning Roscius the eminent Roman Actor, to whom Syla gave an Annual Pension and a ring of gold; Etenim, cum artifex ejusmodi est, ut solus dignus videatur esse, qui in scena spectetur; tum vir ejusmodi est, ut solus dignus videatur qui eo non accedat: quid aliud apertissime ostendens, (as St . August: descants on it) nisi illam scenam esse tam turpe, ut tato minus ibi esse homo debeat, quato fuerit magis vir bonus: it is abundandly evident, That Stageplayers are most infamous persons, and their very profession most base and execrable both among Pagans and Christians. Neither is the art or publike profession of acting Stage-playes vile and execrable onely when it is practised for lucre sake, but likewise the voluntary personating of them too for recreation or entertainement, especially in persons of ranke and quality. To instance in some particulars. First, it hath beene alwayes reputed dishonorable, shamefull, infamous, for Emperors, Kings, or Princes to come upon a Theatre to dance, to masque, or act a part in any publike or private Enterludes, to delight themselves or others: Hence Dion Cassius Suetonius , Philo Iudeus with sundrie other writers, impute this as an inexpiable infamie to that monster, and shame of Monarches, Caius Caligula , (who was so farre besotted, as not onely to drinke his horses Incitatus health,  &c. and to spend whole nights in beholding masques and Stage playes, turning night as it were into day; but likewise by a publike edict to compell all the people to be present at his enterludes at his unseasonable houres, and to chop off the heads of such as either came not to them, or departed from them ere they were ended:) Quod procedente tempore et aurig auit et pugnauit, et saltavit, et Trag aediam, git, semper h aec tractans: et quod semel noctn primoribus Patrum, quasi ad necessariam deliberationem, vocatis, coram, saltavit, ac desaltato cantico abijt : which caused Ch aerea to conspire his death, and to murther him as he was coming out of the Theater : which Dion Cassius thus relateth. Postquam vero saltare etiam et fabulans agere Caius instituit , Cha aerea cum suis rem extrahendam porro non rati, observarunt e Theatro exeuntem, ut pueros spectaret, deprehensumque in angiportu obtruncarunt . An end most sutable to his vitious tyrannicall play-adoring life, which had quite exhausted the Romane treasurie. We find this recorded to Nero his perpetuall shame. Quod postremo ipse scenam inscendit, multa cura tentans cytharam et pr aemeditans, assistentibus familiaribus Quod faeminarum illustrium senatorumque plures per arenam faedasset, et acriore in dies cupidine adigebatur promiscuas scenas frequentandi. Nam adhuc per domum aut hortos cecinerat iu aeenalibus ludis, quos vt parum, celebres et tanta voci angustos spernebat. Non tamen Romae incipere scenas ausus, Neapolim quasi Graecam, vrbem dilegit: inde initium fore vt transgressusin Achaiam insignesque et antiquitus sacras coronas adeptus maiore fama studia aeiuiumae eliceret, &c. Ibidem saepius per complures cantauit dies. Neque eo segnius adolecentulos equestris ordinis et quinque amplius millia e plebe robustissimae iuuentutis vndique elegit, qui divisi in factiones plausuum genera condiscerent, operamque nauarent cantanti sibi insignes pinguissima coma, et excellentissimo cultu pueri,nec sine annulo laeues: quorum duces quadragena millia H S. merebant. Etiam Romae Neroneum ageus ante praestitutum, diem reuocauit: Nomen suum in albo profitentium citharaedorum iussit adscribi sorticulaque in vrnam cum caeteris demissa, intrauit ordine suo simulque Praefecti praetorij citharam sustinentes, post tribum militum, juxtaque amicorum intimi. Vtque constitit peracto principio, Nioben se cantaturum per Cluvium Rufum consularem pronuntiavit, et in horam fere decimam perseveravit: coronamque eam, & reliqua certaminis partem in annum sequentem distulit, ut saepe canendi occasio esset. Quod cum tardum videretur, non cessauit identidem se publicare. Non dubitauit etiam priuatis spectaculis opera inter scenicos dare, quodae praetorum H S. decies offerente Tragoedias quoque cantauit personatus heroum Deorumque, item heroidum, ac Dearum personis effictis ad similitudinem oris sui, et f aeminae, proui quamque diligeret: inter coetera cantauit Canacen parturientem, Orestem matricidam, Oedipodem excaecatum Herculem insanum. In qua fabula fama est tyrunculum milite positum ad custodiam aditus, cum eum ornari ac vinciri cateni;s, sicut argumentu postulabat, videret, accurisse ferendoe opis gratia. Mox ipse aurigare atq; etiam spectari saepius voluit positoque in hortis inter servitia et sordidam plebem rudimento, universorum se oculis in Circo maximo praebuit, certamina deinceps obijt omnia. Cantante eo, ne necessaria quidem causa excedere Theatro licitum erat. Itaque & enixae quaedam in spectaculis dicuntur, et multi taedio audiendi laudandique, clausis oppidorum portis, aut furtim dissiluisse de muro, aut morte simulata funere elati. Constitit plerosque equitum dum per angustias aditus & ingruentem multitudinem enituntur obtritos, et alios dum Diem noctemque sedilibus continuant, morbo exitiabili correptos; quippe gravior inerat metus si spectaculo defuissent, multis palam et pluribus occultis, vt nomina ac vultus, alacritatem, tristitiamque coeuntium scrutarentur. Vnde tenuioribus statim irrogata supplicia, aduersus illustres dissimulatum ad presens, et mox redditum odium. Interea Senatus propinquo iam lustrali certamine, ut dedecus averteret, offert Imperatori victoriam cantus, adijcit facundi ae coronam, qua ludicra deformitas velaretur. Sed Nero nihil ambitu nec potestate Senatus opus esse dictitans, se aequum adversus aemulos et religione indicum meritam laudem assecuturum, prime carmen in Scena recitat: mox flagitante vulgo vt omnia studia sua publicaret (h aec enim verba dixere) ingreditur theatrum, cunctis citharae legibus obtemperans: ne fessus resideret, ne sudorem nisi ea quam indutus gerebat veste detergeret; vt nulla oris vel narium excrementa viserentur. Postremo flexus genu, et caetum illum manu veneratus sententias indicum opperiebatur fictopauore. Et plebs quoque vrbis histrionum quoque gestus inuare solita personabat certis modis, plausuque composito, Crederes laetari, ac fortasse laetabantur per iniuriam publici flagity : so he stiles it. Sed qui remotis emunicipijs, seueram, que adhuc, et antiqui moris retinentes Italiam, quique per longas prouincias lasciuiae inexperti, officio legationum, aut priuata vtilitate advenerant: neque aspectum illum tolerare, neque labori inhonesto sufficere, cum manibus nescijs fatiscerent, turbarent gnaro, ac s aepe a militibus verberarentur, qui per cuneos stabant, ne quod temporis momentum impari clamore, aut silentio segni praeteriret, &c . Such was the Playerlike citharedicall life of this lewd vitious Emperour: which made him so execrable to some noble Romanes , who affected him at first, before he fell to these infamous practises; that to vindicate the honour of the Romane Empire, which was thus basely prostituted, they conspired his destruction: which conspirarie being detected, Subrius Flavius a chiefe captain, one of the conspirators, being demaunded of Nero , for what reason he had thus conspired against him? returned this answere Oderam te inquit, nec quisquam tibi fidelior militum fuit dum amari meruisti; odisse capi postquam parricida matris et vxoris, auriga, Histrio, et incendiarius extitisti . And Sulpitius Asper, a Centurian , being demanded the like question, made this reply; Non aliter tot flagitijs eius subueniri posse . And when as some of these Conspirators would have had Piso to succeed Nero in case their treachery had succeeded, Flavius made them this answere Non referre dedecori, si citharedus dimoueretur et Trag aedus succederet: quia vt Nero cithara, ita Piso tragico ornatu canebat . All which, together with the Satyricall invectiues of Iuuenall and others against this infamous Playerlie Emperor, are a sufficent evidence, what an ignoble shamefull thing it is for any Prince or Emperour to sing, to dance, or act upon a Stage. Hence AElius Lampridius , and Eutropius in their Commodus Antoninus , and Herodian histori ae l. 1. & 2\. p. 57. to 73 . severely censure this dissolute Emperour Commodus , whom they and the people stiled, a Gladiator , an Actor on the stage: Quod nudus ingressus amphitheatrum est, sumptisque armis numeros gladiatorios implebat &c. Triste vero (writes Herodian) Romano populo spectaculum id visum, nobilissimum Imperatorem, post tam multos parentis sui maiorumque triumphos, non quidem adversus Barbaros arma capere militaria, vel Romanorum Imperio congruentia, sed amplissimam dignitatem, turpissime fedissimoque cultu contaminare; eoque tandem vesani ae provectus est, ut deserere principalem aulam atque in domicilium gladiatorium migrare institueret. Neque se amplius Herculem appellari patiebatur, adoptato nobilissimi gladiatoris nomine, qui jam vita excessisset: atque in basi simulachri Colossei solis effigiem gerentis subscripsit, non quos consuesset imperatorios Paternosque titulos, sed pro Germanico, mille gladiatorum victorem : To such prodigious degrees of basenesse of degeneracy doe dissolute Princes come to by degrees, when as they once addict themselves to such infamous delights. These actions of his were so execrable to the Senate, the common people, and to all his freinds; that when as on the feast of Ianus, Statuisset non quidem ex imperatorijs (ut mos erat) aedibus, sed ex ipso gladiaterio prodire in publicum, deducente gladiatorum agmine in conspectu Populi Romani &c. Martia his best-beloved Concubine, Intellecto tam absurdo turpiq; Consilio, primu orare multis lachrymis, supplexquo ad genua accidere, ne aut Romanum imperium contumelia afficeret, aut ipse vitam sua perditis ac deploratis hominibus tam periculose comitteret. Sed cum diu supplicando nihil proficisset, lachrymans discessit. Ille Pr aefectum exercitibus Laetum nomine et Electum cubiculi custodem, ad se accitis, parare iubet in ludo ipso gladiatorio, que se dormitum recipiat, vt illic ad sacrificandum mane procederet, ac se armatum Romano Populo ostentaret. Illi supplicabant et persuadere tentabant, ne quid imperio indignum faceret . But loe the desperate obstinacie of this wicked Emperour; Commodus id aegre ferens, eos quidem amandauit: reversus autem in cubiculum ad capiendum somnum (nam meridie id facere moris habebat) sumpto in manus libello, conscribit in eo quoscunque illa nocte interficere destinaverat. Ex quibus prima erat Martia, mox L aetus atque Electus: post hos ingens eorum numerus qui plurimum authoritatis in senatu obtinebant. Siquidem senes universos, & reliquos patris amicos tollere e medio (quod graves turpium factorum inspectores habere puderet) bonaque ipsa divitum dilargiri partim militibus, partim gladiatoribus decreverat, vt alteri se defenderent. alteri oblectarent . Which booke comming to Martia her hands, shee and Electus with others, conspired to poyson him: which when they had effected; all the people rejoyced,  & ran to their Temples, to giue publick thanks; vocerebanturque quidam, jacere tyrannum, pars gladiatorem, qui f aelicitatem. (uam alijs in rebus studijs faedissimis contaminasset . Which severall passages, are a most pregnant testimony, how infamous, how disgraceful a thing it is, for Kings or Emperours to turne Actors, Masquers, or Gladiators on a Stage, even in the very judgement of heathens, much more of Christians. It is storied of Antoninus the Emperour to his deserved infamie; Quod e Syria profectus, statim debacchari supra modum caepit, cultum patrij numinis, cui dicatus fuerat, celebrare supernacuis saltationibus, vestitum vsurpans luxuriosum: ad tibiarum et tympaenarum sonum in publicum prodibat orgya numinis celebrans &c . From which M aesa earnestly deswaded him; ne spectantium oculos offenderet. Ipse ver o identidem aurigans aut saltans conspiciebatur: quippe ne latere quidem sua patiebatur flagitia, procedens etiam in publicum pictis oculis genisque purpurissatis, faciemque suapte natura for mosam, indecoris coloribus inficiens. Quod animaduertens M aesa, ac suspectans militum ob talem Imperatoris vitam indignationem: persuadet leui alioqui stolidoque adolescenti, vt sibi consobrinum suum Alexandrum adoptaret, et Caesarem declararet, &c. Postea igitur quam Alexander Caesar est appellatus volebat cum statim Antoninus suis illis institutis imbuere, ut scilicet choros agitans saltansque, vestitu eodem atque artibus vteretur; quem tamen mater Mamm aeaa f aedis illis et quae Imperatores dedecebant actionibus avertebat: atque omnium disciplinarum doctores clam accersebat; modestiamque edocens, ac Palaestra virilibusque gymnasijs insuefaciens, graecisque cum pariter ac latinis literis instituens. Quibus iratus Antoninus magnopere indignabatur. Quapropter omnes illius Doctores aula exegit. Quosdamque illustriores partim morte, partim exilio affecit; ridiculas allegans causas , Quod filium ipsius corrumperent, cum neque agitare choros, neque ebacchari permittendo, sed ad modestiam componendo, et virilia officia edocendo. Eoque vecordi ae provectus est ut omnes scenicos artifices ac theatricos ad maximas imperij dignitates promoveret. Quippe exercitibus saltatorem quendam praefecit, qui olim iuuenis publice in theatro operas dederat. Alium item e scena, iuuentuti, alium senatui, alium etiam equestri ordini praeposuit. Aurigis item et comaedis mimorumque histrionibus maxima imperij munia demandabat: seruisque suis aut libertis vt quisque turpitudine reliquos an[illeg.]eibat, procurationes tradebat prouinciarum. Ita rebus omnibus per omnem contumeliam et temulentiam debacchantibus , cum c aeteri omnes, tum imprimis Romani milites indignabantur; abominabanturque eum, vtpote vultum componentem elegantius quam faeminam probam deceret: insuper aureis monilibus, mollissimoque vestitu haudquaquam viriliter ornatum,, saltantemque in conspectu omnium. Quare propensiores animos in Alexandrum habebant, spemque meliorem in puero modeste et continentere ducato, &c. Quae intelligens Antoninus nihil non insidiarum Alexandro matrique intendebat, &c. Quod milites aegre ferentes, imperatorem e medio tollere turpiter se gerentem vellent; quapropter ipsum Antoninum et matrem Soaemidem interficiunt, cumque ijs seruos ministrosque omnes scelerum . So execrable did his dancing, acting, effeminacy, & love of Stage-players make him to all the Senate, soldiers and people, that they thought him unworthy for to raigne or live, and at last dragged his carcase through the Citty and cast it into the common Iakes. It is registred among other of Heliogabalus his lewd effeminate unworthy actions Quod agebat domi fabulam Paridis, ipse Veneris personam subiens, ita vt subito vestes ad pedes defluerent, nudusque vna manu ad mammam, altera pudendis adhibita, ingenicularet, posterioribus eminentibus in subactorem reiectis et oppositis. Vultum pr aeterea eodem quo Venus pingitur schemate figurabat, corpore toto expolitus; ipse cantavit, saltavit, ad tibias dixit, tuba cecinit, pandurizavit, organo modulatus est. Fertur et vna die ad omnes Circi et theatri meretrices (a good evidence that all whores, and few women else frequent these Play-houses) tectus cuculione mulionico, ne agnosceretur, ingressus &c . An aparant proofe, that an Emperour dancing or acting a part in Playes or Masques even in his own private pallace is infamous, and his resort to playhouses more abominable. To passe by the censure of Philarcus & Athen aeus , upon Lysimachus , who bring in Demetrius thus usually speaking of his Court. Aulam Lysimachi nihil differre a Scena Comic ae : to whom Lysimachus replied: ego igitur meretricem exeuntem ex Scena tragica non vidi . It is recorded to the shame of Vitellius ; Vitellio cogniti scurr ae quibus ille amicitiarum dehonestamentis mire gaudebat. Quantoque magis appropinquabat vrbi, tanto corruptius iter, mixtis histrionibus & spadonum gregibus, et caetero Neronianae aulae ingenio. Namque et Neronem ipsum Vitellius admiratione celebrabat sectari cantantem solitus non necessitate, qua honestissimus quisque, sed luxu et sagina mancipatus emptusque . The like is storied to the infamie of Gallienus the elder, qui natus abdomini et voluptatibus. Quod s aepe ad tibicinem processit, ad organum se recepit, cum processui et recessui cani iuberet: et quod mensam secundam scurrarum et mimorum semper prope habuit . To which I may add that of Saloninus Gallienus ; Quod plura qu ae ad dedecus pertinebant ab eo gesta sunt: nam noctibus popina dicitur frequentasse, et cum lenonibus, mimis, scurrisque vixisse : And that of the Emperour Carinus too, Quod mimos vndique advocavit. Exhibuit et ludum Sarmeticum quo dulcius nihil est: Donatum est et gr aecis artificibus, et gymnicis, et histrionibus, et musicis aurum et argentum: donata et vestis serica. Sed haec omnia, nescio quantum ad populum (writes Vopiscus) grati ae habeant, nullius certe sunt momenti apud principes bonos. Dioclesiani denique dictum fertur, cum ei quidam largitionalis suus editionem Cari laudaret, dicens; multum placuisse principibus illos, causa ludorum theatralium, ludorumque Circensium; ergo (inquit) bene risus est imperio suo Carus . All which is a convincing proofe, how absurd a thing it is for Princes to delight in playes or Actors, much more to Act Enterludes or Masques themselves, Theopompus Historiarium lib. 28. & Athenaeus Dipnosph. lib. 6. c. 6 . pa. 422. condemne King Philip, qui cum Thessalos prodigos esse cognovisset, atque omnino intemperantes, artibus omnibus illis placere studuit: nam et tripudiabat, et lasciviebat, omniaq; pr aeter modestiam patiebatur. Erat enim natura scurra, singulisque diebus ebrius &c. Polybius & Athenaeus , severely censure Antiochus the illustrious, who they phrase the mad: Quod vna cu recitat oribus ludebat, totusq; velatus inferebatur a mimis, atque in terram deponebatur quasi vnus esset ex mimis. Concinnitate deinde evocante, rex exiliebat, tripudiabatque et iocabatur cum mimis, ita vt omnes verecundia caperentur. Ad res huiusmodi miseras inducit stuporis, qui ex ebrietate nascitur . Yea Athen aeus taxeth Straton King of Sidonia for this very thing Quod conventus cum tibicinis, saltatricibus ac cytharistis faciebat; multasque amicas ex Peloponeso accersebat, compluresque cantatrices ex Ionia, atque ex vniuersa Gr aecia amicas puellas, quaru alias quide saltantibus, alias canetibus amicis praemium certaminis proponere solebat, quibuscum etiam coire s aepius delectabatur; cum vitae huiusmodi institutionem complecteretur, ipsa natura seruus erat voluptatum . By all which severall recited examples (well worthy all Christian Princes consideration and detestation too; De quibus nescio an decuerit memori ae prodi; as Eutropius writes of Caligula his vices, nisi fort e quia iuvat de Principibus nosse omnia, vt improbi saltem famae metu declinent talia :) it is most evident: that it hath beene alwayes a most infamous thing for Kings, and Emperours to act Playes or Masques either in private or publike; or to sing, or dance upon a Stage or theatre; or to delight in Playes and Actors. Which assertion is likewise confirmed by Plinius secundus Panegyr: Traiano dictus p . 32. 45. 110. here p. 462, 463. Froysart his Chronicle Booke 4. cap. 192. fol. 243. 244. The generall history of France p. 231. Gueuara his Dial of Princes l. 3. c. 43. to 47. D. Rainolds his Overthrow of Stage- playes p. 6. to 10.  & 63\. to 76. Arius Montanus in lib. Iudicum c. 16. p. 470. 571. & Iuuenal Satyr 8. by Tacitus, Herodian, Suetonius Polybius, Athenaeus, Flauius Vopiscus, Ælius Lampridius, Trebellius Pollio, Eutropius, Corceius Sabellicus, Antoninus, Grimston , in the lives of these fore-named Emperours, and in the places quoted in the margent. with sundry others whom I pretermit. See here p. 462, 463,557,558,734. to 743. & p. 710. the example of Ptolomie , accordingly. Secondly as it is absurd  & most infamous for Princes, so also is it for any Magistrates, Nobles, Gentlemen, or persons of ranke or quality, to act a part in publicke or private on the Stage. Hence Cornelius Tacitus writes thus of Nero his times. Sed f aeminarum illustrium Senatorumque plures per arenam faedati sunt. Ratusque dedecus amoliri si plures faedasset nobilium familiarum posteros egestate venales in Scenam deduxit, quos fato perfunctos, ne nominatim tradam maioribus corum tribuendum puto. Nam et eius flagitium est qui pecuniam ob delicta potius dedit, quam ne dolinquerent. Notos quoque equites Romanos operas aren ae promitterae subegit, donis ingentibus, nisi quod merces ab eo qui iubere potest vim necessitatis affert. Ne tamen adhuc publico theatro dehonestaretur, instituit ludos Iuuinalium vocabulo in quos passim nomina data non nobillitas cuiquam, non aetas aut acti honores impedimento, quo minus Graeci Latiniue histrionis artem exercerent vsque ad gestus, motusque haut viriles &c . Whereupon divers of the Senators and people complained and cried out, Proceres Romani specie orationum et carminum Scena polluantur, quid superesse, nisi vt corpora quoq; nudent, et c aestu assumant, easq; pugnas pro militia et armis meditentur &c. vid Ibide : Which infamous act Suetonius thus expresseth, Spectaculorum plurima et varia genera edidit, Iuvenales, Circences, Scenicos Ludos, gladiatorum munus: Iuvenalibus senes quoque Consulares anusque matronas recepit ad lusum. Ludos quos pro aeternitate imperij susceptos appellari maximos voluit, ex vtroque ordine et sexu plerique ludicras partes sustinuerunt. Exhibuit autem ad ferrum etiam quadringentos Senatores, sexcentosque equites Romanos et quosdam fortunae atque estimationis integrae ex ijsdem ordinibus, confectoresque ferarum et ad varia arenae ministeria, &c. Which ignoble flagitious base practise of his & others, the Poet Iuvenal doth thus notably inveigh against. At vos Troiugen ae vobis ignoscitis & quae Turpia Cerdoni. Volesos, Brut osque decebunt. Quid si nunquam ade o foedis, adeoque pudendis Vtimur exemplis, vt non peiora supersint? Consumptis opibus vocem Damasippe locasti Sippario, clamosum ageres vt Phasma Catulli. Laureolum velox etiam bene Lentulus egit, Iudice me , dignus ver ae cruce:nec tamen ipsi. Ignoscas populo: populi frons durior huius, Qui sedet, & spectat triscurria patriciorum: Planipedes audit Fabios, ridere potest qui Mamercorum alapas, quanti sua funera vendant, Quid refert? vendunt nullo cogente Nerone, Neo dubitant celsi Pr aetoris vendere ludis. Finge tamen gladios inde, atque hinc pulpita pone, Quid satius? mortem sic quisquam exhorruit, vt sit Zelotypus Thymeles, stupidi collega Corinthi? Res haud mira tamen, citharoedo Principe mimus Nobilis, h aec vltra quid erit nisi ludus? & illic Dedecus urbis habes, nec Mirmillonis in armis, Nec clypeo Gracchum pugnantem, aut falce supina. ( Damnat enim tales habitus, & damnat & odit. ) Nec galea frontem abscondit, movet ecce tridentem, Postquam vibrata pendentia retia dextra Nequicquam effudit, nudum ad spectacula vultum. Erigit & tota fugit agnoscendus arena. Ergo ignominiam graviorem pertulit omni Vulnere, cum Gracco iussus pugnare secutor. &c. An elegant description & demonstratio of the infamie of such mens acting playes: Which Laberius an anciet Roman Knight, drawne upo the Stage to act a part by the hire  &comad of Nero , doth excellently descypher in this expression of his owne dishonor. Laboriu asper ae libertatis equitem Romanum (writes Macrobius ) C aesar quingentis millibus invitavit, ut prodiret in scenam, et ipse ageret mimos quos scriptitabat. Sed potestas non solum si iuuitat, sed etiam si supplicet, cogit. Vnde se et Laberius a Caesare coactum in Prologo testatur his versibus. Necessitas, cuius cursus aversi impetum Voluerunt multi effugere, pauci potuerunt. Quo me detrusit pene extremis sensibus? Quem nulla ambitio, nulla unquam largitio, Nullus timor, vis nulla, nulla aucto. ritas Movere potuit in iuuenta de statu; Ecce in senecta vt facile labefecit loco viri excellentis mente clemente edito, Submissa placide blandiloquens oratio. Etenim ipse dijnegare cui nihil potuerunt Hominem me denegare quis posset pati? Ego bis tricenis annis actis, sine nota, Eques Romanus lare egressus meo, Domum revertar mimus. Ni mirum hoc die Vno plus vixi mihi quam vivendum fuit. Fortuna immoderata in bono atque in malo, Si tibi erat libitum literaru laudibus Floris cacumen nostr ae famae frangere, Cur cum vigebam membris praeuiridantibus, Satisfacere Populo, et tali cum poteram viro, Non flexibilem me concuruasti, vt caperes? Nunc me quo deijcis? quid a scena affero? Decorem formae, an dignitatem corporis? Animi virtutem, an vocis iocundae sonum? Vt haedera serpens vires arboreas necat; ita me vetustas amplexu annorum necat; Sepulchris similis, nil nisi nome retineo. In ipsa quoq; actione subinde se qua poterat vlciscebatur, inducto habitu Syri, qui velut flagris caesus, praeripientiq; se similis, exclamabat Porro, Quirites libertatem perdimus. Et paulo post adiecit; necesse est multos timeat quem multi timent: quo dicto vniuersitas populi ad solum Caesarem oculos et ora convertit; notantes eius impotentiam hac dicacitate lapidatam . A most pregnant evidence of the point in question. Among the ancient Romans as Macrobius, Cicero, Seneca and others in their forequoted passages witnes, it was an infamous thing for Senators, Knights, for men or women of quallity, or their Children, to dance either in a publicke Theatre, or at any private feasts: Hence Seneca thus complaines Cantandi saltandique obsc aena studia effaeminatos tenent: hinc molles corporis motus docentium, mollesque cantus et infractos: Sapientia vero animorum magistra, non indecoros corporis motus, nec varios per tubam et tibiam cantus efficit, &c . Hence Augustus C aesar, quoniam Equites et feminae illustres adhuc in Orchestra saltabant, prohibuit ne non modo Patriciorum liberi (id enim antea cantum erat) sed etiam nepotes eorum, quique equestris erant ordinis, amplius id facerent. In his actionibus Legislatoris Augustus et Imperatoris speciem nomenque ostendit . Hence this is laid as a tax upon Caligula , that in his presence, Patricij pueri Troiam luserunt . And hereupon Claudius his successor, to draw men from this infamie; In Orchestram introduxit inter alios viros etiam equites ac mulieres, quales Caij principatu saltare solebant; non quod ijs delectaretur, sed vt pr aeterita argueret. Nam posthac certe nemo eorum in scena visus est dum Claudius viveret? Pueri quoque quos ad Pyrrhicam saltationem Caius evocaverat, somel duntaxat ea saltata civitate donati, ac ablegati sunt, Alij deinde ex famulis Claudij saltarunt: haec in theatro . Yea such was the infamie of acting playes among the ancient Pagan Romans; that even lewde Vitellius inacted this law: Cautum severe ne equites Romani Ludo et aren a polluerentur . And Plinius Secundus in his Panegyricall oration to Traian , in the name of the whole Roman Senate  & people, stiles the acting of Playes; Eff aeminatas artes, et indecora seculo studia : which the whole Roman Nation did condemne. See here p. 462, 463. accordingly. To these severall recited Pagan testimonies, I might accumulate, the forequoted evidences of the Praetor, Bud aeus, Arius Montanus, Vlpian, Æmilius Probus, Dio, Xiphilinus, Dionyssius Gothofredus, Ioannes de Burgo &c. together with the concurrent suffrages of Lipsius Saturnal.l.2.c.1 . and of Lubine C aelius secundus, Farnaby , and others in their Commentaries and notes upon Iuvenal, Satyr 8\. who all affirme, the voluntarie descending of any persons of quality or ranke upon the Stage ( etiam et sine pr aemio ) to act a part even without reward or hire, to be infamous and absurd: but our learned Dr. Rainolds in his Overthrow of Stage-playes p.4. to 11.  & 63\. to 77. and in other pages of that discourse, hath proved this point so fully, that I will here proceede no further in it. Thirdly, it is altogether infamous, yea unlawfull, for any Clergie-men whatsoever or their Children, and for any who intend to enter into orders, either voluntarily or compulsorily, for reward or without reward, to act a part upon the Stage, either in any publicke or private Enterludes. Hence the Councel of Carthage, Anno. Dom. 397. Can.11. Decrees: That sonnes of Bishops and Cleargie men (much lesse then they themselves) should neither exhibit, act or behold any secular Enterludes : Hence also the 4. Councell of Carthage: Can . 56. 60. 62. The 7. Coun. of Carthage, can : 70. the 6. Coun. of Constantinople, can . 24. 51. 62. the 3. Synod of Towers. can . 7. 8. the 2.

Scene 3\. together with Sextus, Odo Parisiensis, and Pope Pius the 5. Ivo Carnotensis Decret. pars 6. cap . 208, 209. 349. pars 11\. cap . 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81. Hostiensis Summal. 5. Tit. de Clerico Venatore fol . 455. Summa Angelica Ludus, have possitiuely prohibited all sorts of Clergie-men whatsoever from dancing from acting (and which is farre more strict, even from beholding) Stage-playes or any such ioculatorie Enterludes, either in publicke or private ; which resolutions and decrees of theirs, are abundantly ratified by the concurrent suffrage of all the forequoted Canonists and Civilians on which you may reflect. Yea such is the rigidnesse of the Canon-law in this particular; than it makes not onely all professed Stageplayers, but likewise all Schollers and others who have voluntarily acted any part in publicke or private Enterludes, uncapable of any Ecclesiasticall Orders or preferments, till they have done publicke pennance, and openly manifested their serious repentance for the same ; as our owne famous English Canonist Ioannis de Burgo , Chanceller of the Vniversitie of Cambridge in Henry the 6. his raigne (the onely ancient extant writer of that Vniversity before Henry the 7. his dayes, which I have hitherto met with) with others, expresly testifie in their forementioned passages. And hereupon Ioannis Langhecrucius a famous popish Canonist and Divine, in his Treatise De vita et honestate Ecclesiasticorum. 1.2. after he had largely proved in the 20.  & 21\. Chapters of that Booke, that Clergie-men ought not to act or see any Stage-playes or Enterludes ; in the 22. Chapter he propounds this question (which naturally comes here to be discussed from the premises;) Whether Schoolemasters or their Schollers may at this day act any Coedies, Trag aedies or other Stagplayes? And he resolves it negatively that they may not doe it, whether these Masters or scholers are such as are already admitted, or as yet not entred into clericall Orders: Veru si quis in terroget (writs he) anne ludimagistri possint per discipulos suos co aedias et tragaedias aliosue ludos scenicos agere? Respodendu videtur, quod si praedicti ludimagistri, eoruve discipuli clericali tosura insigniti sint, eos non posse, vt per supradicta patet. Quia jure canonico expresse cautu est, vt clerici mimis ioculatoribus et histrionibus non intendant. Verum si discipuli non sint tonsurati, nec illis quidem permittendum hoc videtur , (pray marke it) pr aesertimsi lascivi vel prorsus profani sint, cuab illis Christiana religio eos prohibeat. Nam cum paruuli qui succrescentes in maiorum suorum locum in reipublic ae tam ecclesiastic ae quam secularis administratione succedant , conseques sit, ab ipsis prane ac nequiter institutis reipub: pernicie imminere; idcirco summoper e refert, vt pueritiae, quae seminarium est omnium rerum publicaru in timore Domini, verecundia, pudicita, et bonis disciplinis edoceatur, prout supra ex SS. Concilio Tridentino demonstratum fuit. Divus enim Cyprianus, consultus quid sibi videretur de histrione quodam, an talis deberet communicare cum catholicis, qui adhuc in in eiusdem artis su ae dedecore perseuerabat; respondit his verbis: Puto ego nec maiestati divinae, nec evangelicae disciplinae congruere, vt pudor et honor ecclesiae, tam turpi et infami contagione faedetur, &c. Nec excusetse quispiam, si a theatro ipse cessaverit cum tamen hoc caeteris doceat. Non potest enim uideri cessasse, qui vicarios substituit, et qui pro se vno plures succedaneos suggerit, contra institutionem Dei, erudiens et docens quem admodum masculus frangatur in faeminam, et sexus arte mutetur, et diabolo divinum plasma maculanti, per corrupti atque eneruat; corporis delicta placatur, &c . Then he quotes the forementioned passage of St. Cyprian to Donatus Epist. 1. 2. Epist. 2 . to iustifie this his answer: After which he thus proceeds. Deinde in acumenica Synodo sexta, qu ae fuit Constantinopolitana 3. Canon 62. statutum est: vt nullus vir muliebri veste induatur, nec mulier veste viro conveniente; sed nec Comicas, nec Tragicas nec Satyricas personas induant. Qui secus fecerit, si clerici sint, deponantur; si Laici, segregentur a communione : (which Canon prohibites all manner of persons whatsoever, whether laymen or Clergiemen, from acting any sort of Enterludes, be they Comedies, Tragaedies or Satyrs) Quare pi e et recte a provinciali Synodo Mechliniensi statutum fuit; vt illi auctores, qui per gentilitate aut turpes amores iuuenum mores corrumpere possent a scholis arceantur? Et vt non solum e templis et locis sacris, verum etiam e domibus et hortis ecclesiasticorum tollantur imagines, sculpturae, aulaea, quae gentilitatem, aut mendaces ethnicorum fabulas, Satyrorum, faunorum, Syrenarum, terminorum ac Nympharum, acid genus alia repr aesentant : (which are the commonnest representations in all Masques and Stage-playes:) Similiter qu aecunque figurae lasciuae, procaces, et ob pudendam nuditatem vel alias tam obscenae, vt pios mentes offendant, et superstitiosae, qui fidelium mentes a religione et devotione distrahunt et saepius graviter offendunt . Then hee quotes the forementioned Canons, prohibiting childrens acting of Playes in Churches upon Innocents day : together with the Canons of the Councell of Millaine ; from all which he truely and positively concludes: That it is unlawfull for Schoolemasters or their Schollers, to act any Comedies, Tragedies or other stageplayes . And shall Protestants then allow of that which the very Papists condemne: God forbid. From all which premises thus layd together, wee may quickly learne what to judge, not onely of the personating of all private and publick Masques and Mummeries, which are now to frequent, but likewise of the acting of Academicall Enterludes, by Vndergraduates, Graduates, Deacons, and sometimes young Divines; which Playes are commonly as scurrilous, as prophane, as scandalous, as invectiue against religion and the professors of it, as experience witnesseth, as any that are acted in our standing Playhouses. Certainly whatever the Error, the corruption of the times may judge; yet the fore-aleaged Councels, Fathers, Authors doome the acting, (yea the very beholding of such academicall Enterludes, especially by Clergie-men, who are now to forward to pen, to act and see them whereas above 40. severall Councels have possitively decreed, that they ought not to be present at any such Playes or Enterludes) to bee both scandalous and infamous, not onely in the repute of Christians, but of Pagans too, especially of the anciant Pagan Romans; In scenam enim prodire et populo esse spectaculo nemini in Gr aecis gentibus fuit turpitudini: qu ae omnia apud Romanos, partim infamia, partim humilia, atque ab honestate remota ponuntur , as Æ milius Probus writes. And can any gentlemen or schollers whatsoever, thinke this an honor to them, to be excellent Actors, Masquers or dancers, in any Academicall Enterludes, which the very heathen (besides, Councels, Fathers, and Christian authors) haue long since sentenced as their shame? Doubtles no ingenuous christian ought to be so stupid. so prophane or gracelesse, as to harbour any such conceit within their breasts. And here that I may not to farre digresse into a large discourse against Academicall or private Enterludes since I have beene so overteedious against popular, I shall onely commend these three considerations to the Readers, and all Academicall Actors consciences. First, that the Fathers, the Primitiue Christians, the fore-recited Councels, and Pagan authors, never made, nor knew of any such novell distinction as this, of Popular & Academicull Enterluds, but condemned all playes alike, as well those in private houses, as in publike Theators as well those that were acted by Voluntary as by hired and professed Actors, both which they reputed infamous, as I haue here largely manifested. Secondly that all, at leastwise most of all the arguments, the authorities here produced against popular stage-players, stand firme against Academicall too, there being no other difference betweene them that I know, but this; that the one are more frequent, more publike then the other: their materials, circumstances, concomitants, and manner of acting. being for the most part both alike, and their original too. Thirdly, that Academicall Enterludes are in this regard farre worse then popular, in that they give a kind of authoritie, and justification to publike Enterludes Actors, and Play-haunters, our common Players and Playhaunters alleaging the examples of our vniversity Enterludes as their cheifest Agument, their best apologie both for the vse and lawfullnesse of publicke Stageplayes, as present experience manifests: and in that their example, their scandall is farr worse then that of popular stage- playes, and so apt to doe more harme, by increasing the number both of popular players and Actors, and hardning them in the love, the practise of acting and frequenting Playes; because the persons who commonly Act, behold and pen them being schollers and divines (who should be patternes of piety, gravity, sobriety and right christian conversation unto others ) are of farre better education ranke and quallity, in regard of their professions, and of the Vniversities theselves in which they live, (they being the very eyes and Lampes, the Seminaries and Nurseries of our Iland, where youth are vsually either made or marde for ever, to the great publike good or hurt) then either the penners, or actors, of our common Enterludes, who are ordinarily men of meanest quallity & lewdest conditions , even such as our owne statutes brand for Rogues . Which three Considerations added to all the premises, to page 489. 490. 491.  & to Doct. Reynolds his learned Over-throw of Stageplayes , (where he hath professedly proved, Academicall stageplayes as well as popular, to be unlawfull, mauger all Doct. Gagers, or Doctor Gentiles their slender cavils and objections to the contrary, which are there so solidly answered, that they were inforced to yeeld their cause Doct. Gager subscribing at last unto D. Reynolds his judgement ;) will be a sufficient evidence, to convince the vnlawfulnes of Academicall Enterludes, and the infamie of such as shall presume to act the; All voluntary, hyred, or professed Actors of Academicall, of common Stageplayes being infamous persons, as the foregoing Authorities, largely testifie, I shal therefore here coclude this Scene, with that excellent passage of Cornelius Agrippa , of the infamie of acting  & frequenting stagplayes, Proinde exercere histrinica, non solu turpis et scelesta occupatio est, sed etia conspicere et dilectari flagitiosum: siquidem et lasciuientis animi oblectatio cadit in crimen. Nullu deniq; nomen olim fuit infamius, quam histrionum, et legibus ipsis arcebantur ab honoribus, quicunq; fabulam saltassent in Theatro . And thus much for the infamie of Acting Stageplayes: a good Prologue or introduction to the unlawfulnes both of the Profession of stageplayers, and of acting Playes, which I shal next discusse. that the profession of a Player, and the acting of Stage-playes are unlawfull. Secondly, I shall lay downe the Severall groundes and reasons of their unlawfullnesse. For the first of these, I shall need to vrge no more but these ten Arguments First. That which hath ever been infamous, scandalous and of ill report, both among Christians and Pagans to, must questionlesse be sinfull, unlawfull unto Christians, who are to follow things only of good report, and to provide things honest in the sight of all men, giving no offence, either to Iew or Gentile, or to the Church of God . 1. Tim. 3, 7. 1.Pet.2. 11. 12. 15. c, 3. 15. 16. Phil . 4, 5. 8. 9. Rom.13,13.c.14.13.19. cap. 15.2. cap.12.17.1. Cor.10.31,32,33. Ephes. 4.2 But the professio of Stagplayers,  & the acting of playes either in publike or private, have been ever infamous, scandalous, and of ill report, both among Christians and Pagans, as the foregoing Scene demonstrates. Therefore it must questionlesse bee sinfull, unlawfull unto Christians. Secondly. If those who have acted Stage-Playes, have all wayes beene banished, excluded and cast out of the common weale, and made uncapable of any honor, or promotion, by Christian by Pagan Republiques, Emperors, Kings, Magistrats, If they have bin excommunicated both from the word, the Sacraments, the societie of Christians, & disabled to give any testimony, or to take any Ecclesiasticall Orders or promotions upon them, by the solemne resolutions, constitutions and Decrees, of Councels, Fathers, and the whole Primitiue Church, even for their very Play-acting; which thus debarred them from all the priviledges both of Church and common weale, then certainely the profession of a stage-player, together with the acting of playes, is unbeseeming and unlawfull unto Christians, See p. 133, 134. But those who acted playes, have alwayes thus beene handled: as being altogether unworthy of any privileges of Church or comon weale; witnes the examples of Plato, Aristotle, the Massilienses, Lac aedemonians, Iewes, auncient Germaines, Tiberius, Augustus, Nero, Traian, Marcus Aurelius, Constantine, Trebonius Rufinns Henry the third, Philip Augustus , and others forecited; who excluded Players and Play-poets out of their Republikes, and banished them their Dominions : (to which I might adde Lewis the 9\. surnamed the godly , who made divers good Laws against Dice-houses, Players, playes and other enormities ) Witnesse the forealeaged Councels, Fathers and Primitive Church, & Christians who excommunicated al Stage- players & Actors from the word, the Sacraments and all Christian society; disabling them to give any publike testimony, or to take any ecclesiasticall orders and preferments &c. even for their very acting of Stage-playes : See part 1. Act. 4. Scene 1. Act 6. Scene 5. Act. 7. Scene 2. 3, 7. and the next fore going Scene, where all this is largely manifested. Therefore the profession of a Stage-player, together with the acting of stage- playes, is unbeseeming and unlawfull unto Christians. Thirdly: The profession, the action of any unlawfull scandalous or dishonest sports, cannot but bee unlawfull, especially unto Christians, who must absteine , not onely from all evill things, but likewise from all appearance of evill : 1 Thes. 5. 22. See here Part 1. Act. 3. Scene 3. Act. 5. Scene 1, 2, 3.  & Act. 6. Scene 4. accordingly. But Stage playes as the Premises prove at large, are unlawfull, scandalous and dishonest sports. Therefore their action cannot but be unlawfull, especially unto Christians. Fourthly. That profession which hath neither Gods word for its rule, nor his glorie for its end, must certainely be unlawfull unto Christians; witnesse, Psal. 119\. 9, 10. Gal . 6. 16. 1 Cor . 10. 31. c. 6. 20. 1 Pet . 4. 11. which informe us, that Gods people must make his word the square, his glory the cheife and onely end of all their actions. But the profession or art of acting Playes, hath neither the word of God for its rule (there being neither precept nor example in all the scripture for to warrant it, but many texts against it: See here p. 547. to 551. & 723\. to 730;) nor yet the glory of God for its end, as I have here largely manifested, p. 127. to 133. & f . 520. to 570. Therefore it must certainely bee unlawfull unto Christians. Fiftly, That art or trade of life, in which men cannot proceed with faith or comfort, & on which men cannot pray for or expect a blessing from God, must questionlesse be unlawfull unto Christians: witnesse, Rom . 14. 23. Psal . 129. 7, 8. Phil . 4. 6. 8. 9. 1 Iohn 5\. 16. Neh . 1. 11. c . 2. 20. Psal . 90. 17. But in this art or trade of acting Playes, men cannot proceed with faith or comfort, because it hath no warrant from the word, the rule of faith ; nor from the Spirit, the efficient cause of faith ; nor from the Church or Saints of God, the houshold of faith : neither can men pray for or expect a blessing from God upon their Playacting; it being a calling of the very Divels institution , not of Gods appointment; a calling not authorized by the word of God, and therefore no wayes intitled to the blessing of God: A profession I dare say, on which the very professors themselves, could never heartily pray as yet for a blessing; Neither doe or can those pious Christians which go by whiles they are acting, say , The blessing of the Lord be upon you, wee blesse you in the name of the Lord . A profession which hath oft times drawne downe the very vengeance and curse of God on many who have practised or beheld it, See here f . 552. to 568. Therefore, it must questionlesse bee unlawfull unto Christians. Sixtly. That calling or profession in which a man cannot attribute his gaines to the blessing and favour of God; so as to say, it is God that hath blessed mee in this my honest vocation and made me rich; and for his gaines and thriving in which hee cannot render any thanks & prayse to God; must doutblesse be an ungodly calling and profession, not lawfull among Christians: witnes Prov : 10. 22. Gen . 33. 5. 11. 2. Chron . 1. 12. Eccles . 5. 19. Matth . 11. 6. 33. Psal . 145. 1, 2, 15, 16. Acts 2\. 46, 47. 1 Tim . 4. 3, 4.  & Phil . 4. 6. But Players cannot attribute or ascribe their gaines to the blessing and favour of God; it being but turpe lucrum , dishonest filthy gaine, much like the hire of an harlot : neither can they render true praise or thankes to God for what they gaine by acting, because they have no assurance that it proceedes from his good blessing, on this their lewde profession. Therefore it must doutlesse bee an ungodly calling and profession, not lawfull among Christians. Seventhly. That profession towards the maintenance of which, a man cannot contribute without sinne, and sacrificing to the Devill himselfe, must questionlesse bee unlawfull unto Christians; See I Cor . 10. 21, 22, 23. Rom . 1. 30, 32. 2 Iohn 10, 11. But no man can contribute towards the maintenance of Stage-players, as Stageplayers, with out sinne, without sacrificing to the very Devill himselfe: For histrionibus dare immane peccatum est: & histrionibus dare, est daemonibus immolare ; as St Augustine , Raymundus , and sundrie others testifie: See here p. 324, 325, 326. 905. 906.  & 688. Therefore it must questionlesse bee unlawfull unto Christians. Eightly. That calling or profession which altogether indisposeth and unfits men for Gods worship & service, and for all religious duties, must necessarily bee sinfull and unsutable unto Christians: See Luke 1\. 74. 75. Hebr . 12. 1.  & Matth. 5. 29, 30. Act . 19. 18, 19. Iam . 1. 21. 1 Pet . 2. 1, 2. But the profession of Playacting doth altogether indispose, and unfit men for Gods worship, his service, for the hearing of his word, the receiving of his Sacraments, (from which all Players were excomunicated) & from all other religious duties: See here p. 393. to 420. & fol. 522. to 542. & p. 561. to 573. Therfore it must necessarily be unlawfull unto Christians. Ninthly. That profession which is pernicious and hurtful both to the manners mindes and soules of men, and preiudiciall to the Church, the State that suffers it must certainely bee unlawfull, intolerable among Christians: See here p. 447, 448, & Ioh . 10. 10. But the profession of acting Playes is pernicious both to the manners mindes and soules of men, of actors &spectators, & preiudicial to the Churches and States that suffer them: witnesse: page 302. to 568. Therefore it must certainely be unlawfull, intollerable among Christians. Lastly. That calling which the very professors of it upo their conversion & repentance have vtterly renounced with shame, and highest detestation, as altogether incompatible with Christianity, piety or salvation, must certainely be sinfull and utterly unlawfull unto Christians: See Rom : 6. 20, 21. But sundry professed Actors and Stage-players both in the Primitive Church and since, upon their true conversion and repentance, have vtterly renounced and given over their profession of acting Playes, with soule confounding shame and highest detestation, as altogether incompatible with Christanity, piety, or salvation: See here p. 134. fol. 542, 545. 566. 568. p. 561, to 573. 840. & 910. Therefore it must certainely be sinfull and altogether unlawfull unto Christians. And that upon these severall grounds which is the second thing. First, in regard of the parts & persons that are most usually acted on the Stage: which are for the most part Devills, heathen Idoll Gods and Goddesses, Satyrs, Syluanes, Furies, Fayries, Fates, Nymphes, Muses, & such like ethnicke idolatrous figments, which Christians should not name or represent: Or else Adulterers, Whoremasters, Adulteresses, Whores, Bawdes, Panders, Incestuous persons, Sodomites, Parricides, Tyrants, Traitors, Blasphemers, Cheaters, Drunkards, Parasites, Prodigals, Fantastiques, Ruffians, and all kinde of vitious godlesse persons; whose very wickednesses are the comon subiect of those Stageplayes which men so much applaud : And if the persons of any Magistrates Ministers or Professors of Religion are brought upon the Stage (as now too oft they are) it is onely to deride and jeere them, for that which most commends them to God and all good men . The parts and persons therefore of Stage-playes being such, the represention of the on the Stage must needs be ill, as I have largely proved: pag. 88, 89, 94. 175. to 178. &c. Secondly, in respect of the subiect matter of Stageplayes which is either prophane or heathenish, fraught with the names, the histories, ceremonies, applauses, acts and villanies of Pagan Idols: or ribaldrous, wicked, & obscene, consisting of Adulteries, Whoredomes, Rapes, Incests, Treasons, Murthers, sollicitations to lewdnesse, ribaldrie, bawdrie, treacherie, prodigious periuries, blasphemies, oathes, execrations, and all kindes of wickednes: Or impious and blasphemous, abusing Scripture, God, Religion, Grace, and Goodnesse: Or Satyricall, slanderous, and defamatorie; or vaine and frothy at the best, full of amorous, effeminate wanton dalliances, passages, pastorals, or of idle words & actions . All which can neither be uttered nor acted, without sinne and shame, as I have more largely proved, Act.3. & 5. throughout; and as Tertullian Chrysostome Cyprian Lactantius , Saluian , Northbrooke , Gosson , Stubs , Doct. Reynolds , and others witnes; because such things as these , ought not to be named , much lesse then Personated, among Christians : they are evill in their owne nature, their representations therefore, being the appearances of evill, which Christians must abstaine from, cannot be good. Thirdly, in regard of the very manner of acting Playes, consisting of sundry particular branches, which I have at large discussed Act. 5 . Scene. 1.2.3.4.5, 6.7.  &c. on which you may reflect, and therefore shall passe more briefly over them now, reciting only some passages, some authorities that I there omitted. The first considerable particular in personating of Stage-playes, is the hypocrisie of it, in counterfeiting not onely the habits, gestures, offices, vices, words, actions, persons, but even the gestures and passions of others, whose parts are represented; which I have proved hypocrisie, Act.5. Scene 1. p. 156. to 161 Hence Philo Iud aeus compares hypocrites and secret enemies unto Stage-players: tanquam in theatro personatos sub alieno habitu tegentes veram faciem : Hence Athanasius stiles the hypocriticall Epicritian heretiques, who covered their foule heresy with a faire outside, Stageplayers . Hence also is that passage of Zeno Veronensis an ancient Father. Denique hypocrita ille dicitur, qui in theatro persona vultui superimposita, cum alius sit, alius esse simulatur; verbi causa, interdum regis persona vtitur, cum sit ipse plebeius, aut etiam Domini cum forte ipse sit servuns. Ita ergo in hac vita complurimi hominum tanquam theatro simulatis personis vtuntur et fictis , (as too many likewise doe in this our age) et cum sunt extrinsecus aliud, aliud se esse hominibus ostendunt . Parallel to which is that of Paschatius Ratbertus: Nunc autem quia hypocrit ae vt Mimi secundum tragicam pietatem in theatricis Ludorum, coram hominibus Diabolo astipulante permulcent se, et cupiunt iusti videri, cum rex militum venerit, invenient non se fuisse quorum partes agebant in superficie, sed scenicorum imitatores quorum speciem tenebant in corde . Which being added to that of learned and laborious Mr. Fox , who stiles hypocrites and false teachers, histriones pietatis , (as Dr. Humphries and others call the Masse, Histrionicam fabulam, et theatricum Papismi Spectaculum ) is a sufficient evidence, that Stage-players are hypocrites, and the acting of Playes hypocrisie, therefore unlawfull unto Christians. The second unlawfull circumstance in the acting of Playes; is the grosse obscenity, amorousnesse, wantonnesse, and effeminacie that attends it, which here I shall but name because I have at large debated it. Act 5. Scene 2,3,4,5. to which I shall referre you. The third, is the apparent vanity, follie, and fantastique lightnesse which appeares in those ridiculous antique, mimicall, foolish gestures, complements, embracements. smiles, nods, motions of the eyes, head, feete, hands, & whole intire body which Players vse, of purpose to provok their Spectators to profuse inordinate laughter , which absurd irrationall, unchristian if not inhumane gestures and actions, more fit for skittish goates then men, or sober Christians, if grave men, if reason or religion may be judges, are in truth naught else but the very extremitie of folly, of vanity, if not of Bedlam frenzy . For what greater evidences can there be of vanity, folly. or frenzy, then to see a wise man act the fooles or clownes; a sober man the drunkards, bedlams, wantons, fantastiques; a patient man, the furies, murtherers, tyrants  &c. a chast man the Sodomites, whoremasters, adulterer, adultresses, whores bauds or Panders; an honest man the theefs or cheaters; yea a reasonable man the horses, Beares, Apes, Lyons, &c. or a male the womans part; What more absurd, then to behold a base notorious Rogue representing not only the person of a Maiestrate minister, Peere, Knight, &c. but even the Maiestie, Pompe State, office, of the greatest Monarch, the vanity that Salomon reprehended long agoe: when he saw folly set in great dignity; when he beheld Servants to ride on horses, and Princes walking as servants on the earth . Or what can be more impious or prophane, then to behold a Christian who beares the image of God, of Christ ingraven on his Soule, cuius signum se in fronte portare asserit, et de corde perdidit , as St. Augustine speakes) to act the part, the person, to put on the habit, the Image of a pagan, an Idol, yea a heathen-God and Goddesse on the Stage, the very recitall of whose names, whose rites, the very making of whose images, is grosse Idolatry, condemned by the expresse letter of the second commandement, and infinite other Scripture , as all Christian writers iointly witnesse. Certainely if the Scriptures be so rigid, as to prohibit , all idle wanton foolish words; all unseemely gestures, and lasciuious motions of the body ; as the pride the loftines of the countenance, the amorous glances of the eye, the walking with stretched out neckes and wanton eyes, the mincing, and tinckling of the feete &c . commanding Christians to put away vanitie, folly and madnes, with all unseemely things ; and confineing them to gravitie, modestie, comlines and sobrietie, both in their actions gestures, apparell haire words, thoughts ,  & things of smallest moment, the gravitie of Christ & Christians being such in former time that they were never seen to laugh seldome to smile, much lesse to use any light dishonest gestures, or play any wanton Childish pranks , as actors doe:) we cannot but from thence conclude, that it condemns these wanton postures, Complements, dalliances, motions, & representations, that alwayes attend the acting of Playes; which in their very best acception are vanity & the appearance of evill , if not impiety and sinne it selfe; & so vnlawfull unto Christians. The fourth is the apparell wherein Playes are acted; in which two things are considerable, which make the acting of Playes unlawfull: First, the abuse; Secondly, the excessive gawdinesse, amorousnesse, and fantastique strangenesse of theatricall apparell. For the first of these; not to insist upon this particular, that infamous sordid Actors oft usurpe the habits of Ministers , Magistrates, Gentlemen, Citizens, and others; yea, the robes of Emperours, Princes, Nobles, Bishops, Iudges, and those whose parts they act, which are no waies suitable to their condition or profession; I shall onely pitch upon this one particular abuse, of mens acting female parts in womens apparell and haire in Enterludes; Vbi alius soccis obauratis, indutus serica veste, mundoque pretioso, & adtextis capite crinibus, incessu perfluo faeminam mentitur ; as Apuleius expresseth it. Which practise is diametrally contrary to Deut . 22. 5. The woman shall not weare that which pertaineth to a man, neither shall a man put on a womans garment; for all that doe so, are an abomination to the Lord thy God . Which Scripture, as it condemnes womens cutting of their haire like men (as HRabanus Maurus, Nicholaus de Lyra, Hugo Cardinalis, Iunius , and sundry other forequoted Expositors on this text affirme, who couple it with the 1 Cor . 11. 4, to 16.) together with their cloathing of themselves in mans array: (a mannish whorish practise, of which Pope Ione, anotable strumpet; Theodora , a Roman Matron, who waited on Stephanio the Player, in cut haire, and mans apparell, as his page; Tecla , a famous Virgin, Qu ae pro Paulo quaerendo tonsuram & virilem habitum suscepit ; (even against S. Pauls professed doctrine, 1 Cor . 11. 5, 6, 15.) and so repaired thus disguised to his lodging, to bee instructed by him . Eugenia a female Romish Saint, who did cut her haire, and cloath herselfe in mans apparell, and so went disguized to the Monastery of Saint Helenus the Bishop, whether no woman might have excesse, where shee entred into Religion, and lived many yeeres in mans apparell like a Monke, and was at last elected Abbot of that Monastery, which office she managed with great humility like a man, as all reputed her. Marina, and Eufrosina, who polled their heads, and put on mans apparell, and then entred into Monasteries, where they lived and died professed monkish Votaries , (or rather disguised prostituted Strumpets to their chast fellow Monkes) as sundry others have done of latter times. Gundo , an infamous Virago, Qu ae comam capitis inscidit, & contra Dei iura virilia sumpsit indumenta; armisque accincta, baculoque innixa: and thus attyred, resorted to the Monastery of S. Karilephus, who avoyded the sight of all women; But no sooner was she entred into the inward parts of the Abbathie, but she was presently strucke blinde in both her eyes, and possessed with a Devill, vomiting up blood in a horrid manner, for this her unnaturall bold attempt: with divers other Romish female Votaries, who have polled their heads, and entred into Monasteries as professed Monkes, in mans apparell, the better to satiate their owne and other unchaste Monkes lusts , have beene notoriously guilty. Witnesse Cornelius Agrippa , who writes thus of these chaste Virgin Nonnes and Monkes: Quin & plurimae monialium & vestarum & beguinarum domus privat ae qu aedam meretriculorum fornices sunt, quas etiam monachos & religiosos. (ne diffametur eorum castitas) nonnunquam sub monachali cuculla, ac virili veste in monasterijs aluisse scimus &c. Habent enim sacerdotes, monachi, fraterculi, monialos, & quas vocant sorores specialem lenociniorum praerogativam, quum illis religionis praetextu liberum sit quocunque pervolare, & quibuscunque quantum & quoties libet, subspecie visitationis & consolationis, aut confessionis secreto sine testibus loqui, tam pie personata sunt eorum lenocinia & sunt ex illis quibus pecuniam tetigisse piaculum est, & nihil illos movent verba Pauli dicentis; Bonum est mulierem non tangere; quas illi non raro impudicis contrectant manibus & clanculum confluunt ad lupanaria, stuprant virgines sacras, vitiant viduas, & hospitum suorum adulterantes uxores, nonnunquam etiam, quod ego scio & vidi, Iliaci instar praedonis abducunt, & Platonica lege, cum popularibus suis communes prostituunt, & quarum animas lucrari debent Deo, illarum corpora sacrificant Diabolo; aliaque his multo sceleratiora, & qu ae nefas est eloqui, insana libidine perpetrant: interim castitatis voto abunde satisfacientes, si libidinem, si luxuriam, si fornicationem, si adulteria, si incestum verbis acerrime incessent detestenturque. & de virtute locuti clunes agitent. Sed & flagitiosissimi lenones scelestissimaeque lenae saepe sub ilis religionum pellibus delitescunt. Tales habent aulicae dominae plerum[illeg.] sacrorum suorum mystas, & aulicarum nuptiarum scortationumque consultores . Which passage seconded by divers other Popish and Protestant Authors , I wish our Romish Catholikes, who glory of the chastity of these their goatish Votaries, would consider.) So it likewise reprehends mens nourishing of their haire like women, and their putting on of womens attire, (though it be but now and then,) as an abomination to the Lord: And no wonder, that the putting on of womans apparell, and the wearing of long haire should make men abominable unto God himselfe, since it was an abomination even among Heathen men: Witnesse, not onely the forequoted examples of Heliogabalus, Sardanapalus, Nero, Sporus , Caius Caligula, and others : together with Commodus and Annarus the effeminate governor of Babilon, (all great Sodomites and Adulterers:) whose going clad sometimes in womans apparell (for none of them went constantly in that array, some of them onely once or twice) hath made them for ever execrable to all posterity : insomuch that Æ lius Lampridius writes of Commodus, (qui clava non solum leones in veste muliebri, sed etiam multos homines afflixit) Quod tant ae impudentiae fuit, ut cum muliebri veste in Amphitheatro & Theatro sedens publice saepissime biberit . And what accursed fruits this effeminacy of his produced, the same Author witnesseth; Nec irruentium in se iuvenum carebat infamia, omni parte corporis atque ore in sexum utrumque pollutus . It is storied of Ortyges the Tyrant of Erythre and his companions, Qui legibus solutis res administrabant civitatis ; that they grew to that height of effeminancy: Quod per hyemem muliebribus calceis induti ambulabant, comas nutriebant, nodique capillorum erant studiosi , (let our Ruffianly Love-locke wearers marke it:) caput purpureis cotoneisque diadematibus convolventes. Habebant etiam mundum muliebrem totum aureum, sicut habere f aeminae consueverunt ; which made them so abominable to the people, that Hippotes the brother of Cnopus invaded them with an army, and slue them . The Samians are taxed for effeminacy by Duris and Athen aeus, Quod circa brachia ornatum muliebrem gestare consueverant, que cum Iunonium celebrarent comas pexas habentes, atque in tergum reiectas incedebant. Sic illi pexi Iunonis templa petebant Aurea C aesaream contortam vincula nectunt : and the Sybarites are taxed for the selfesame crime; Quod est etiam apud eos consuetudo, ut pueri ad impuberem usque etatem purpuram, capillorumque nodos auro revinctos gestant. Pausanias writes of Leusippus , who went clad in womans apparell, and wore long effeminate haire like a woman, consecrated to Alpheus, the better to circumvent the chastity of a Virgin whom he loved; that he was slaine by Daphne and her Nymphes, who discovered him to be a male in womans attire, as he was bathing among them : so detestable was this his lewdnes to them. Yea, such was the detestation of this effeminate unnaturall odious practise of mens putting on womens apparell, even among Ethnickes; that the Lycians when they chanced to mourne, did usually put on a womans garment , (ut deformitate cultus commoti, maturius stultum proijcere m aerorem velint, that the very deformity and infamy of that array might move them the sooner to cast of their foolish sorrow: and Charondas the famous Lawgiver , as Diodorus Siculus informes us; is much applauded for enacting this law among the Thurians, that whereas other Lawmakers made it capitall for any man to forsake his colours in the warres, or to refuse to beare armes for the defence of his Country, he contrariwise enacted; that such men as these, should sit three dayes together in the market place, clothed in womans apparell. Which Constitution (saith Diodorus) as it exceeds the lawes of other places in mildnesse; so it doth secretly deterre such cowardly persons from their effeminate cowardice , (probri magnitudine) with the greatnesse of the reproachfull shame. Siquidem mortem oppetere long e praestat, quam tantum ignominiae dedecus in patri a experiri: For it is farre better for a man to be slaine, then to undergoe so great an ignominy and shame in his owne Country . The wearing of womans apparell, even for a little space in these Pagans judgements being so shameful, so execrable a thing, that a man were better to bee put to death, then to put on such array; with which Ascanius doth thus upbraide the Troianes. Vobis picta croco, & fulgenti murice vestes: Desidi ae cordi: iuvat indulgere choreis: Et tunic ae manicas, & habent ridimicula mitrae, O ver e Phrygiae (neque enim Phryges) ite per alta Dyndama, ubi assuetis biforum dat tibia cantum, Tympana vos buxusque vocat Berecynthia matris Ide ae: sinite arma viris & cedite ferro. Nothing being more abominable even among Heathens then effeminacy in long, compt, frizled haire , and womanish apparell, as these examples, and Maff aeus Vegius, De Educatione Puerorum. lib. 5. cap. 4 . and Act 5. Scene 6. abundantly testifie: on which you may reflect. If then the putting on of womans apparell were so abominable to Pagans, no marvell is it if this text of Deuteronomy stiles it an abomination to the Lord our God; the grounds and reasons of which, as I have at large insisted on before, so I shall briefly touch upon them now in Gulielmus Parisiensis his words. Caus ae vero prohibitionis, ne vir utatur veste faeminea, vel e converso, multae fuere. Primo, fuit congruentia ipsius naturae, videlicet, ut quod natura sexu discreverat, discerneret & vestitus. Secundo, ut oportunitas auferretur turpitudinum latibulis; posset enim intrare vir ad mul ierem sub habitu muliebri, & e converso mulier sub habitu virili , (as the examples of Achilles, who by putting on womans apparell defloured Deidamia King Lycomedes Daughter ; of Clodius, who by this wile abused Pompeia, Iulius C aesars wife; and of Leucippus, who by this stratagem sought to ravish Daphne, with other examples of women clad in mans apparell to satiate the lusts of others , witnesse:) Ablata est igitur per hanc discretionem vestitus, multa opportunitas flagitij. Tertio, exterminatio sacrorum. Martis &Veneris: in sacris n. Martis, non solum virili vestitu vestiebantur mulieres, sed etiam armabantur, ut in ipsis vestim entis bellicis, idest armis, ipsum tanquam Deum belli & victoriae datorem colerent. Et Cocogrecus in libro maledicto quem scripsit de stationibus ad cultum Veneris, inter alia sacrilega & Deo odibilia praecepit, ut qui nefandum illum ritum exercet, coronam faemineam habeat in capite suo. Eodem modo in sacris Veneris viri effaeminabantur, videlicet in vestibus muliebribus sacra Veneris exercentes, propter huiusmodi sacrilegos ritus Veneri se placere credentes atque quaerentes. Quarta causa est , ut occasio magna provocationi libidinis auferretur: magna enim est provocatio libidinis viris vestitus muliebris, & e converso : (how much more then when amorous wanton parts are acted in it?) & hoc est quoniam vestis muliebris viro circundata, vehementer refricat memoriam,  & commovet imaginationem mulieris, & e converso: alibi autem didicistis, quia imaginatio rei desiderabilis commovet desiderium. Quinta causa, ut auferretur occasio maleficij quibus gentes ill ae refertissimae erant, & in ijs nutritae. Consueverant n. malefici & maleficae in vestibus aut devestibus libidinis, maleficia exercere, & hoc nos in eorum libris saepe legimus. Vt ergo occasio huiusmodi tolleretur, iam voluit Deus hanc confutationem vestitus esse in viris & mulieribus. Sexta causa, ut tolleretur error periculosus & superstitiosa credulitas, qua trahi possent ad idololatriam, quibus credebant decepti applicatione vestium muliebrium, maxime in sacris Veneris, coniungi sibi ac conciliari amore fortissimo corda mulierum, propter quas hoc facerent, vel quae postea huiusmodi vestibus ut erentur: similiter & deceptae mulieres idipsum credebant de viris, & virilibus vestimentis. Voluit ergo Deus hunc superstitiosum errorem auferri de cordibus corum per ablationem abusionis istius, ne per illum tandem traherentur ad cultum Veneris .

Yea, so universally execrable hath this practise beene in all ages, that the 2. Councell of Bracara , Anno Dom. 610. (as Iuo Carnotensis informes us) enacted this particular Canon against mens acting of Playes in womens, or womens acting or masquing in mens apparell: St quis balationes ante Ecclesias sanctorum, seu qui faciem suam transmutaverit in habitu muliebri, & mulier in habitu viri, emendatione pollicita, tribus annis paeniteat : and Baptista Trovomala , discussing this very question; Whether it be a mortall sinne for a woman to put on mans, or for a man to weare womans apparell to act a Masque or Play ? maketh this reply. Respondent omnes pr aedicatores & totus mundus quod sic : all Preachers, and the whole world doe answer that it is: and for this (saith he) they alleage Gratian Distinctio. 30. cap. Si qua mulier : and Deut. 22.5 . The reason why it is a mortall sinne is rendred by Angelus De Clavasio, because it is contrary to this text of Deut. 22.5. and inconvenient for the persons who put it on : and by Alexander Alensis, and Aquinas: because it is directly contrary to the decency and virility of nature, and likewise to this text of Deuteronomy; Nec pertinet ad honestatem viri veste muliebri indui: utrique enim sexui diversa indumenta natura dedit. Habet enim & sexus institutam speciem habitus (writes Isiodor Hispalensis) ut in viris tonsi capilli, in mulieribus redundantia crinium; quod maxime virginibus insigne est, quarum & ornatus ipse proprie sic est, ut concumulatus in verticem ipsam capitis sui arcem ambitu criniu contegat . If then all these severall Authors, and Councels, together with Vincentius Belsensis Speculum Historiale. lib. 11. cap. 73. & lib. 21. cap. 44 . with others fore- alleaged; if all Preachers, and the whole world it selfe ; or if our owne worthy Doctor Rainolds (who hath largely and learnedly debated this particular point in his Overthrow of Stage-playes. pag. 9. to 15. & 82\. to 106 &c .) may be judges, the very putting on of womans apparell by Players or their Boyes to act a Play, and so e converso, is a most execrable abomination to the Lord our God, prohibited by this text of Deuteronomy . Neither will the shortnesse of the time excuse the fact: For as Nero was truely said to weare his suits, and to put on his apparell, though he never wore one garment twice, changing his raiment every day, as Historians relate ; so he who puts on a womans attyre for a day, an houre or two, or any lesser space to act a womans part, be it but once in all his life, is a putter on of womans apparell within the very words and meaning of this text; which principally provides as the fore-alleaged reasons, Authors, and examples witnesse, against such temporary occasionall wearing and putting on of womans apparell, which oft-times happens , rather then against the daily constant wearing of it, which few have beene so unnaturall as to use. What Tertullian therefore writes of Hercules , attyred by his Mother in womans apparell, to satiate his lusts. ( Naturam itaque concussit Lariss aeus heros in virginem mutando, &c. Feras in puero matris sollicitudinem patiens certe iam ustriculas: certe virum alicuius clanculo functus adhuc sustinet, stolam fundere, comam struere, cutem fingere, speculum consulere, collum demulcere, aurem quoque foratu effaeminatus. Ecce itaque mutatio , monstrum equidem geminum, de viro f aemina, mox de faemina vir, quando neque veritas negari debuisset, neque fallacia confiteri . Vterque habitus mutandi malus, alter adversus naturam, alter contra salutem. Turpius adhuc libido virum cultu transfiguravit, qu am aliqua materna formido; tametsi adoratur a vobis qui erubescendus est Scytalosagittipelliger ille, qui totam epitheti sui sortem cum muliebri cultu compensavit. Tantum Lydiae clanculariae licuit, ut Hercules in Omphale, & Omphale in Hercule prostitueretur, &c . The same may I say of women who impudently cut their haire, or put on mens, or men who effeminately nourish their haire , or put on womans apparell to act any mummery, Masque, or Stage-play, or for any such like ends; that they sinne against nature, their sex, their owne salvation , making themselves not onely double monsters , but even an abomination to the Lord their God , as all the premises witnesse. And what Christian, what Mummer, Masquer, or Actor is there so desperately prodigall of his owne salvation, as thus to become an Anathema Maranatha , a perpetuall unsufferable abomination to his God, by putting on such apparell for an houre, to act a Matrons, perchance a Strumpets part, which may make him miserable for all eternity? As therefore this putting on of womans apparell is an abomination unto God, so let it be an execrable and accursed thing to us; and since there is so much ingenuity left in most men, rather to goe could and naked, yea to expose their lives to hazard, then thus unnaturally to cloath their nakednesse, or to walke abroad in womans vestments; let there not bee henceforth so much impudency in any Actors, Mummers, Masquers, as to appeare publikely in feminine habits, or attires on the Stage, rather then to foregoe their lascivious sinfull Playes and Enterludes, which (if S. Augustine , or others may be credited,) are the very broad way, which leades men downe to Hell and endlesse death, in which many multitudes daily walke and sport themselves . I shall therefore close up this particular (which D. Rainolds hath at large discussed , and I my selfe more copiously insisted on in the foregoing part ) with the Commentary of Erasmus Marbachius on this text of Deuteronomy. Distinxit Deus in creatione virum a muliere, ut forma corporis, ita quoque, officio : hanc distinctionem vult Deus conservari, & neutrum sexum habitu & vestitu in alium se transformare, nec quae alterius sunt usurpare. Mulieris est suo vestitu indui, & colum ac lanam tractare, domesticaeque rei curam agere. Viri est, suis quoque vestibus indui, & quae foris & reipub. curane, &c. Prohibentur itaque hac lege larvae, quibus se homines transformant ut agnosci nequeant, quae res occasionem praebet multorum gravissimorum sceleram. Praeterea turpis & inhonestus vestitus, qui nec virilem, nec muliebrem sexum decet; ipsa etiam vestitus novitas, quae animi levis & inconstantis, & vani indicium est : the next particular, which I shall briefly touch. The second unlawfull Circumstance of Actors apparell, is its overcostly gawdinesse, amorousnesse, fantastiquenesse, and disguizednesse. For the gaudinesse, lasciviousnesse, and newfanglednesse of Players attire, it hath beene long since discovered and censured by the Fathers. Hence Philo Iud aeus discribing a lascivious painted frizled accurately attyred Strumpet, stiles her; Pr aestigiatrix splendide ac scenice ornata . Hence Gregory Nazianzen stiles all women, who paint their faces, embroyder or frizle their haire, and weare lascious gawdy apparell; Theatric e comptae & ornatae, ob venustatem invenustae ; as Levenclavius translates it: recording this as none of his Mothers meanest vertues: quod pictum &arte quaesitum ornatum, ad eas, quae theatris delectantur ablegabat ; who were all notorious prostituted Strumpets. Hence Chrysostome , declaiming against the compt, glittering, painted, amorous females of his age, writes, that they were nihil a theatralibus faeminis discrepantes : and to beat downe all fantastique pride and gawdinesse in apparell, he reasons thus: Sed ornaris &comeris? Verum & equos comptos videre licet, homines vero scenicos omnes . Hence S. Bernard taxing the pride of Prelates and Popish Priests in his time proceeds thus. Vnde hinc est eis quem quotidie videmus meretricius nitor, histrionicus habitus ? Hence Iohn Sarisbery our Countri-man useth this expression in censuring the effeminate compt fantastique Gallants of his age; interim invident meretrici histrionis habitum . And hence our learned Walter Haddon , phraseth Masse-attire, gawdy Copes, and such like vestments, Histrionicus vestitus : Which severall phrases and expressions, with sundry others to the like purpose are frequent in most Greeke and Latine Authors. All which being coupled with 22. Henry 8\. c . 13. (which speakes of the costlinesse of Players Robes) and with Act 5. Scene 7. pag. 216. to 220. where I have more largely demonstrated this particular, will bee a sufficient evidence, of the gawdinesse, lasciviousnesse, and newfanglednesse of Stage apparell, and so by consequence of its unlawfulnesse too . For the strange disguisednesse of theatricall attires, it is most apparant: For doe not all Actors, Mummers, Masquers usually put on the Vizards, shapes and habits of Iupiter, Mars, Apollo, Mercury, Bacchus, Vulcan, Saturne, Venus, Diana, Neptune, Pan, Ceres, Iuno, and such like Pagan Idol-gods and Goddesses: the persons, the representations of Devils, Satyrs, Nymphes, Sylvanes, Fayries, Fates, Furies, Hobgoblins, Muses, Syrens, Centaures, and such other Pagan Fictions? yea, the portraitures and formes of Lyons, Beares, Apes, Asses, Horses, Fishes, Foules, which in outward appearance metamorphose them into Idols, Devils. Monsters, Beasts , whose parts they represent? and can these disguises bee lawfull, be tolerable among Christians? No verily. For first, the former sort of them, as Iosephus , Philo Iud aeus , Tertullian , with all ancient and moderne Expositors on the 2. Commandement witnesse, are meerely idolatrous ; the very mentioning of these Idols names, much more then the representation of their parts, the making and wearing of their Vizards, shapes, and Images being wholy condemned by the Scripture; which commands Christians to flie all Idolatry , and not to come neere it, lest it should infect them. Secondly, there is no warrant at all in Scripture for any such Stage- disguises, but very good ground against them. For first it condemnes mens disguising of themselves like women, and womens metamorphosing themselves into men either in haire, apparell, offices, or conditions : how much more then mens transfiguring of themselves into the shapes of Idols, devils, Monsters, Beasts,  &c. betweene which and man there is no Analogie or proportion, as is betweene men and women. Secondly, it enjoynes men and women, to attire themselves in modest, decent, and honest apparell, suitable to their sexes and degrees, as becommeth those who professe godlinesse : But such Vizards and disguises as these, are neither modest, decent, honest, nor yet suitable to their human nature. Thirdly, it requires them, to abandon all wanton, strange, lascivious, vaine, fantastique dresses, fashions, vestments: much more then such habits, such disguises as these, which are both inhuman, bestiall, and Diabolicall. Fourthly, it commands men, not to bee like to Horse and Mule, which have no understanding : therefore not to act their parts, or to put on their skins or likenesse. It was Gods heavy Iudgement upon King Nebuchadnezar, that he was driven from men, and did eate grasse as Oxen, and that his body was wet with the dew of Heaven, till his haires were growne like Eagles feathers, and his nailes like Birds clawes : yea, it is mans greatest misery, that being in honour he became like to the beasts that perish : And must it not then bee mans sinne and shame to act a Beast, or beare his image, with which he hath no proportion ? What is this but to obliterate that most glorious Image which God himselfe hath stamped on us , to strip our selves of all our excellency, and to prove worse then bruits? Certainely, that God who prohibits, the making of the likenesse of any beast, or fish, or fowle, or creeping thing, whether male or female, to expresse or represent his owne likenesse; condemning the idolatrous Gentiles , for changing the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and foure footed beasts, and creeping things; with which he hath no similitude or proportion ; must certainely condemne the putting on of such bruitish Vizards, the changing of the glory, the shape of reasonable men, into the likenesse of unreasonable beasts and creatures, to act a beastiall part in a lascivious Enterlude. Fiftly, it enjoynes men, not to alter that forme which God hath given them by adding or detracting from his worke; not to remove the bounds that he hath set them; but to abide in that condition wherein he hath placed them : Vpon which grounds, as the Fathers and others aptly censure face-painting, Perewigs, vaine fashions, disguises and attires, together with the enchroachments of one sex upon the habits, offices, or duties of the other; so I may likewise condemne these Play-house Vizards, vestments, images and disguises, which during their usage in outward appearance offer a kinde of violence to Gods owne Image and mens humane shapes, metamorphosing them into those idolatrous, those bruitish formes, in which God never made them. Sixtly, it censures mens degenerating into beasts, or Devils, either in their mindes or manners, be it but for a season; as the marginall Scriptures witnesse; therefore it cannot approve of these theatricall, bestiall, and diabolicall transfigurations of their bodies ; which are inconsistent with the rules of piety, gravity, honesty, modesty, civility, right reason, and expedience, by which all Christians actions should be regulated . Seventhly, it informes us, that even Achish King of Gath , a meere Pagan Idolater, when he saw David acting the madman before him, and feining himselfe distracted, scrabling on the doores of the gate, and letting the spittle fall downe upon his beard; said thus unto his servants; Loe you see the man is mad: wherefore then have yee brought him to mee? Have I need of mad-men, that yee have brought this fellow to play the mad-man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house ? If then this Heathen King was so impatient to see David act the Bedlam in his presence, even in his ordinary apparell, that he would not suffer him to stay within his Palace; how much more impatient should all Christian Princes and Magistrates be of beholding Christians acting, not onely Mad-mens, but even Devils, Idols, Furies, Monsters, beasts, and sencelesse creatures parts upon the Stage in such prodigious deformed habits and disguises, as are unsuitable to their humanity, their Christianity, gravity, sobriety; bewraying nought else but the very vanity, folly, and bruitish frensie of their distempered mindes? Certainely those who readily censure and detest such habits, such representations in all other places must needs condemne them in the Play-house, whose execrable infamous lewdnesse may happily make them more unlawfull, never commendable or fit for Christians. Lastly, these theatricall habits, vizards, and disguises have beene evermore abominated, condemned by the Church and Saints of God: as namely, by the Iewish Church and Nation: who, as they never admitted nor erected any Images or Pictures of God, of Christ, or Saints within their Temple , as Hecat aeus Abderita , Cornelius Tacitus , Dion Cassius Philo Iud aeus , and Iosephus witnesse: accounting it a hainous sinne contrary to the expresse words of the second Commandement, to paint or make any Picture, any Image of God; because the invisible incorporiall God, ( whom no man hath seene at any time, nor can see; betweene whom and any Image, Picture, or creature there is no similitude, no proportion,) cannot be expressed by any visible shape or likenesse whatsoever, (his Image being onely spirituall and invisible like himselfe ,) as not onely the Scripture , but even Seneca and Tully informe us: Vpon which grounds the Primitive Christians ( who had no Images, no Pictures, no Altars in their Churches , as Arnobius , Origen , Minucius Felix , and Lactantius testifie, for which the Pagans blamed them :) as also Iustin Martyr , Iren aeus , Clemens Alexandrinus , Tertullian , Origen , Minucius Felix , Cyprian , Arnobius , Lactantius , Gregory Nyssen , Ambrose , Hierom , Augustine' Eusebius , Epiphanius , Cyrillus Alexandriutis , Damascen and other Fathers ; together with Constantine the Great , Constantinus Caballinus, Nicephorus, Stauratius, Philippicus, Anthemius, Theodosius the second, Leo Armenus, Valence, Theodosius the third, Michael Balbus, Theophilus, Charles the Great , with other Emperours; the Councels of Eliberis , Constantinople, Toledo , and Frankford ; with sundry Popish and Protestant Writers since, our late renowned Soveraigne King Iames , and our owne Homilies, against the perill of Idolatry , (established by Act of Parliament, and confirmed by our Articles and Canons , as the undoubted Doctrine of our Church, to which all our Clergie subscribe:) doe absolutely condemne, as sinfull, idolatrous, and abominable the making of any Image or Picture of God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost , or of the sacred Trinity, & the erecting of them, of Crucifixes, or such like Pictures in Churches , which like the Emperor Adrians Temples built for Christ, should be without all Images, or Saints Pictures . So they likewise codemned the very art of making Pictures and Images, as the occasion of Idolatry , together with all Stage- portraitures, Images, Vizards, or representations of Heathen Idols,  &c. as grosse Idolatry, as Iosephus witnesseth : The selfesame censure is passed against these theatricall Pictures, Vizards, Images, and disguises, by Philo Iud aeus, De Decalogo. lib. pag.1037.

Wherefore they are certainely unlawfull, as I have formerly proved at large. Act 3. Scene 3. & Act 5. Scene 1.2,3,5, 6,7 . on which you may reflect. I shall therefore close this point with that speech of Saint Bernard , in his Apologie to William the Abbot , in his passage against the overcostly building and adorning of Temples, and the setting up of vaine Images and Pictures in Churches , (a thing much condemned by sundry Fathers, Councels, and Imperiall Christian Constitutions ; by all Reformed Churches, and orthodox Protestant Writens, and by the Statutes , Injunctions , Homilies , Canons , ancient and modern Bishops & authorized Writers of the Church and State of England, who teach, that all Images and Pictures, especially Crucifixes, with the Images, the Pictures of God the Father, and the sacred Trinity, which to make is grosse Idolatry and superstition, ought wholy to be abolished and cast out of Churches , in which some of late erect the:) where thus he writes. C aeterum in claustris (I may say in Spectaculis & theatris) cora legentibus fratribus quid facit illa ridicula monstruositas, mira deformis formositas, ac formosa deformitas? quid ibi immunde simiae, quid feri leones? quid monstruosi Centauri? quid semi-homines? quid maculosae tigrides? quid milites pugnantes? quid venatores tubicinates? Videas sub uno capite multa corpora, & in uno corpore capita multa. Cernitur hinc in quadrupede cauda serpentis, illinc in pisce caput quadrupedis. Ibi bestia praefert equum, eapram trahens retro dimidiam, hic cornutum animal equum gerit posterius. Tam multa denique tamque mira diversarum formarum ubique varietas apparet, ut magis legere libeat in marmoribus quam in codicibus, totumque diem occupare singula ista mirando, quam in Dei lege meditando. O vanitas vanitatum! sed non vanior quam insanior. Pro Deo si non pudet ineptiarum; car vel non piget expensarum . And thus much for the manner of acting Stage-playes. The 5.thing which makes the profession of a Player and the very acting of Playes unlawfull, is the end for which they are acted, which is double; profit, or pleasure; the first, the end of all common Players: qui pr aemium incertum petunt certum scelus : the second onely of Academicall and private Actors. To begin with the first. I say it is altogether unlawfull for any to act Playes for gaine or profit sake, or to make a trade or living of it. First, because the profession of a Player is no lawfull warantable trade of life, but a most infamous lewde ungodly profession, condemned by Pagans, by Christians in all ages, as the examples of Plato, Aristotle, the Lacedemonians, Massilienses, and others, who excluded Stage-players their Republikes, and of the Primitive Church and Christians who excommunicated and banished them the Church , together with our owne Statutes , who brand them all for Vagrant Rogues and sturdy Beggers , most plentifully evidence. That therfore which all ages have thus solemnely censured as infamous, execrable and unchristian, can be no lawfull calling for men to live or gaine by. Besides, the professio of a Stage-player, had its original institution from Pagan Idols and Idolaters: it was originally devoted to Idolatry, to Bacchus, and Heathen Devill-gods: it tends onely to dissolutenesse and prophanenesse, to nourish idlenesse, vice, and all kinde of wickednesse both in the Actors and Spectators: yea, it makes men professed vassals to the Devill, to maintaine his very works and Pompes which they have utterly renounced in their baptisme : it tends neither to Gods glory, nor the good of men:needs therefore must it be unlawfull; and so likewise to get money by it. Secondly, Stage-playes in their very best acception are but vanities or idle recreations , which have no price, no worth or value in them: they cannot therefore bee vendible because they are not valuable. In every lawfull way of gaine or trade, there ought to be quid prequo , some worth or other in the thing that is sold, equivalent to the price the vendees pay, or else the gaine is fraudulent and sinfull; but there is no value at all in Stage-playes or their action, which are but empty worthlesse vanities; therefore no price ought to bee taken for them. Thirdly, neither the Word or Church of God, nor the Lawes and Statutes of any Christian Kingdom, (which for the most part condemne al Actors and their lewde profession,) did ever authorize the acting of Playes (no nor yet the Playing at Cards or Dice, or Bowles,) as a lawfull trade and meanes for men to live and gaine by. Yea, the acting of Stage-playes can never be made a lawfull profession, because Playes themselves are but recreations, which must not be turned into professions; recreations being onely to bee used rarely, when men are tyred out with honest Studies, callings, and imployments; (as Stage-playes ought to be were they lawfull,) but professions , constantly from day to day . Therefore men cannot act them, to gaine a living by them. Vpon these grounds the Fathers, Schoolemen, and Canonists teach us; that for men to give their money to Stage-players for their playing, is a very great sinne : Yea, Guillermus Altissiodorensis , Hierom, Iuo , Vincentius Bellovicensis , Olaus Magnus , Ioannis Bertachinus , Stephanus Costa , and divers other certifie us; that, Histrionibus dare est D aemonibus immolare , to give to Stage-players, is nought else but to sacrifice unto Devils: because their proffesion is unlawfull & Diabolicall too: it being both a sinne for play- haunters to give, or Players to take any money for their Playes and action. Hence is it that most Divines and Casuists inforine us, that money gotten by Dice, by Cards, by acting Playes, or any unlawfull profession whatsoever, is plaine theft, and that Dicers and Players are bound to restore their gaines in case they are able, or else to distribute it to the poore . Hence Saint Cyprian (and out of him Ioannes Langhecrucius , and Iuo Carnotensis ) informes us, that Players gaines doe but seperate them from the Society of the Saints in Heaven, and fat them up for Hell: for thus he writes of a Player who pretended poverty and necessity to continue in his acting; Quod si penuriam talis & necessitatem paupertatis obtendit, potest inter caeteros qui alimentis Ecclesiae sustinentur, hujus quoque necessitas adjuvari, si tamen contentus sit frugalioribus & innocentibus cibis. Nec putet salario se esse redimendum ut a peccatis cesset, quando hoc non nobis sed sibi praestet. Caeterum quando vult inde quaerat . Qualis qu aestus est qui de convivio Abrahae, Isaeac, & Iacob & homines rapuit, & male ac perniciose in seculo saginatos ad aternae famis ac sitis supplicia deducit? Et ideo quantum potes, eum a pravitate ac dedecore ad vitam innocentia, atque ad spem vitae suae revoca, ut sit contentus ecclesiae sumptibus parcioribus quidem, sed salutaribus. Quod si illi cecclesia non sufficit ut laborantibus praestentur alimenta, poterit se ad nos transferre, & hic quod sibi ad victum atque vestitam necessarium fuerit, accipere, nec alios extra ecclesiam mortalia docere, sed ipse in ecclesia salutaria discere . The acting therefore of Playes for hire, gaine, or profit sake (which ought not to bee the end of any mans lawfull calling, but onely Gods glory and the good of men , which Playes and Actors never aime at:) must certainely bee unlawfull; Which I would wish our Players and Play-haunters to consider. Secondly, as it is unlawfull to act Playes for profit, so likewise for pleasure sake, because this life is no life of carnall joy and jollity, but of weeping and mourning for our owne and other sinnes, and because carnall pleasures dampe, or quite extinguish all spirituall heavenly joyes, obdurate mens hearts, stupifie their consciences, withdraw their mindes and thoughts from God and better things , lullmen fast a sleepe in dangerous security, so that they never seriously thinke either of their sinnes or latter ends, as is evident by many Players and Play-haunters lives , who are so intoxicated, so stupified with these Syrenian Enterludes, that they never seriously thinke of sinne, of God, of Heaven, or Hell, or of the meanes of grace. But because I have beene more copious in this theame before, I shall here briefely passe it over now, referring you to Part I.Act 2. & Act 5.Scene II . for fuller satisfaction. The 6. and last ground of the unlawfulnesse of acting Playes is the evil fruits that issue from it, both to the Spectators (of which I have at large discoursed, Part 1. Act 6.thorowout ,) and likewise to the Actors, which I shal here onely name. As first, it makes the Actors guilty of many sinnes; to wit, of vaine, idle, ribaldrous, and blasphemous words; of light, lascivious, wanton gestures and actions; losse of time, hypocrisie, effeminacy impudency, theft, lust, with sundry other sinnes, which they cannot avoyd: Secondly, it ingenerates in them a perpetual habit of vanity, effeminacy, idlenesse, whoredome adultery, and those other vices which they daily act: Discunt enim facere dum assuescunt agere, & simulatis erudiuntur advera , as Lactantius and Cyprian truely write. Whence we see for the most part in all our common Actors the reall practise of all those sinnes, and villanies which they act in sport; they being (as Ludovicus Vives , Iohn Calvin the Civilian, and Iacobus Spielegius write) Perditissimis moribus, & deploratae nequitiei ; men of most lewde, most dissolute behaviour, and most deplorable desperate wickednesse, as I have elsewhere largely proved . And how can it bee otherwise? Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem testa diu , being as true as it is ancient. When Children Youthes and others, shall be trained up either in Vniversities, Schooles, or Play-houses, to Play effeminate amorous wanton Strumpets parts; to act the parts of Wooers, Lovers, Bawdes, Panders, Whore- masters, Incestuous persons, Sodomites, Adulterers, Cheaters, Roarers, Blaspemers, Paricides, and the like: when they shall be instructed. Magisterio impudic ae artis gestus quoque turpes & molles & muliebres exponere , as Saint Cyprian phraseth it, to expresse effeminate, womanish, wanton, dishonest mimicall gestures, by the tutorship of an unchast art; to court Whores and Strumpets, to sollicit the chastity and circumvent the modesty of others; to contrive, to plot and execute any villany with greatest secrecy and security; to act any sinnes or wickednesse to the life, as if they were really performed: when they shall have their mindes, their memories, and mouthes full fraught with amorous ribaldrous panderly Histories, Pastorals, Iests, discourses, and witty, though filthy obscenities from day to day; (the case of all our common Actors; especially those who have beene trained up to acting from their youth;) no wonder if we discover a whole grove of all these notorious acted sinnes and villanies budding forth continually in their ungodly lives ; insomuch that those who in their yonger dayes represented other mens vices onely, fall shortly after to act their owne, the better to inable them to personate other mens of the selfesame kinde; he being best able to play the sinnes of others, who hath oft-times perpetrated the very selfesame crimes himselfe. Whence commonly it comes to passe, that the eminentest Actors are the most lewde companions. Et nonne satis improbata est cujusque artis exercitatio, qu a quanto quisque doctior tanto nequior ? Thirdly, it makes men vaine, lascivious, prophane and scurrilous in their discourses; fantasticall and new-fangled in their haire and apparell; mimicall, antique, histrionicall in their gate, their gestures, complements and behaviours: prodigall in their expences, impudent and shamelesse in their carriage; false and trecherous in their dealings; malicious, bloody and revengefull in their mindes; atheisticall, gracelesse, unchaste, deboist and dissolute in their lives; and for the most part impenitent and desperate in their deathes; according to that true rule of the famous Roman Orator; Mors honesta s aepe vitam quoque turpem exornat; vita turpis ne morti quidem honestae locum relinquit . These and many such like evils are the fruits of Play-acting, as too many ancient and moderne visible examples witnesse. Fourthly, it nourisheth men up in vanity and idlenesse, in which they waste their precious time which should be husbanded, redeemed to farre better purposes . For though our common Players be ever acting, yet they are alwayes idle, and make thousands idle to besides themselves; Horum enim non otiosa vita est dicenda, sed desidiosa occupatio, Nam de illis nemo dubitabit, quin opero se nihil agant : as Seneca wittily descants. And so great is our popular Stage- players (that I say not our ordinary Play-haunters) idlenesse; quod totam vitam ordinant adludendum , as Aquinas writes of them: they even spend their whole lives in playing: whence Marcus Aurelius long agone, and our owne Statutes since, have ranked Players among the number of idle vagrant Truants, Rogues, and Vagabonds, which ought severely to be punished and then set to some honest worke, to get their livings ; their acting being nought else but idlenesse in Gods, in mens account. And alas what a poore reward must they expect from God at last, when he shall remunerate every man according to his workes , who have never wrought, but onely loytered and played all their dayes? Lastly, the acting of Stage-playes inthrals the Actors both in the guilt, the punishment of all those sinnes which their Playes or action occasion in the Spectators . Which being so many in number, so great in quality as experience manifests them to bee, what Actors conscience is able to stand under their guilt, their curse and condemnation, either in this life or in the day of judgement, when they shall all be charged on his soule? Lastly, the acting of Stage-playes, as it of right excludes all Actors, both from the priviledges of the Common-weale, from the Church, the Sacraments, and society of the faithfull here, and drawes a perpetuall infamy upon their persons ; so it certainely debars them from entring into Heaven, and brings downe an eternall condemnation on their soules and bodies hereafter, if they repent not in time, those being bound over to the judgement of the great generall Assises and eternall torments even in Heaven, who are thus bound and justly censured by the Lawes and Edicts of the Church or State on earth . Hence was it, that divers Players and Play-poets in the Primitive Church, and since, renounced their professions, as altogether incompatible either with Christianity or salvation ; yea hence a late English Player some two yeeres since, falling mortally sicke at the City of Bathe , whether he came to act; being deepely wounded in conscience, and almost driven to despaire with the sad and serious consideration of his lewde infernall profession, lying upon his death-bed ready to breath out his soule; adjured his sonne whom hee had trained up to Play-acting, with many bitter teares and imprecations, as he tendred the everlasting happinesse of his soule, to abjure and forsake his ungodly profession, which would but inthrall him to the Devils vassalage for the present, and plunge him deeper into Hell at last . Such are the dismall execrable soule-condemning fruits of Play-acting; the profession therefore of a common Player, and the personating of theatricall Enterludes must needs be unlawfull even in this respect. And thus much for the second Corolary; That the profession of a Stage-player, and the acting of Stage-playes is infamous, yea sinfull and unlawfull unto Christians. I now proceed to the 3. Consectary; That it is a sinfull, shamefull, and unlawfull thing for any Christians to be Spectators, frequenters of Playes or Play-houses. In which I shall be very compendious, because I have so largely manifested it in the first part of this discourse. Now the reasons of the unlawfulnesse of beholding Stage-playes, are briefely these. First, because Playes themselves are evill, and the appearances, the occasions of evill; therefore the beholding of them must bee such : Secondly, because it hath alwayes beene a scandalous, infamous and dishonest thing both among Christians and Pagans to resort to Stage-playes, and a thing of ill report : Thirdly, because it is Contrary to our Christian vow in baptisme, to forsake the Devill and all his workes, the pompes and vanities of this wicked world and all the sinfull lusts of the flesh, of which Stage-playes are not the meanest : Fourthly, because it gives ill example to others, and maintaines, and hardens Stage-players in their ungodly profession, which else they would give over, were there no Spectators to encourage or reward them . Fiftly, because it is an apparant occasion of many great sinnes and mischiefes; as losse of time, prodigality, effeminacy, whoredome, adultery, unchaste desires, lustfull speculations, luxury, drunkennesse, prophanenesse, heathenisme, atheisme, blaspemy, scurrility, theft, murther, duels, fantastiquenesse, cheating, idle discourses, wanton gestures and complements, vaine fashions, hatred of grace, of holinesse, and all holy men, acquaintance with lewde companions, the greatest enemies to mens salvation; and a world of such like sinnes and mischiefes , as I have formerly proved at large, Act 6 . thorowout. Sixtly, because it with-drawes mens mindes and thoughts from God and from his service unto vanity; and indisposeth them to all holy duties, making all Gods holy ordinances ineffectuall to their soules . 7 Seventhly, because it tends onely to satisfie mens fleshly lusts which warre against their soules; men being carried alwayes to the Play-house by the sinfull carnall suggestions of the flesh ; or by the sollicitations of lewde companions; but never by the Dictate, the guidance of Gods holy Spirit or Word, by which all Christians must be wholy guided, even in all their actions . Eightly, because all Christians ought to turne away their eyes from beholding vanity . Psal. 119.37. (a text applyed by the Fathers unto Stage-playes :) and what greater, what worser vanities can men behold, then the acting of lascivious Enterludes? Ninthly, because Stage-playes are but Pagan Heathenish pastimes, yea the ordinary recreations of Devill-Idols, of Idolatrous voluptuous Pagans , whose pleasures and sports no Christians ought to practise. Lastly, because the Primitive Church and Saints of God, together with the very best of Christians, of Pagans in all places, all ages, have constantly abandoned the beholding of Stage-playes themselves, and condemned it in others, the very worst of Pagans onely, or men unworthy the name of Christians, and few or none but such alone affoording them their presence , as the fore-quoted Authorities plentifully evidence. Act 4\. Scene 1.2. Act 6\. Scene 3\. 4,5.  & Act 7\. Scene 1.2,3,4,5,6,7. Which severall reasons with all the rest that I have formerly produced against Stage-playes in the first part of this Play-condemning Treatise, will be a sufficient conviction of the unlawfulnesse of beholding, of frequenting Stage-playes, as well in private houses, as in publike Theaters : Which should cause all Christians, all Play-haunters to abandon Stage-playes, as all the fore- alleaged Fathers, Councels, and Authors doe advise them; and that especially upon Lords-dayes and Holi-dayes, on which Stage-playes and dancing are especially prohibited by this pious Decree of Pope Eugenius c.35. with which I shall cloze up this Act. Ne mulieres festis diebus vanis ludis vacent. Sunt quidem & maxime mulieres, qui festis ac sacris diebus, atque, sanctorum natalicijs, quibus debent Deo vacare, non delectantur ad ecclesiam venire, sed balando ac verba turpia decantando, ac choreas ducendo, similitudinem Paganoru peragendo advenire procurant. Tales enim si cum minoribus veniunt ad ecclesiam, cum majoribus peccatis revertuntur. In tali enim facto debet unusquisque, Sacordos diligentissime populum admonere, ut pro sola oratione his diebus ad ecclesiam recurrant, quia ipsi qui talia agunt, non solum se perdunt, sed etiam alios deperire attendunt . Die autem Dominica nihil aliud agendum est, nisi Deo vacandum: nulla operatio in die illa honesta comperiatur, nisi tantum hymnis & psalmis, & canticis spiritualibus dies illa transeatur . Which I would wish all grosse prophaners of this sacred Day now seriously to consider. Having thus run over these three Corollaries of the unlawfulnesse of penning, acting and beholding Stage-playes; I come now to answer such Objections as may bee made against them; especially against the unlawfulnesse of acting & beholding Stage-playes. The arguments (or pretences rather) for the acting of Stage-playes (which I shall first reply to) are these: First, it is lawfull to read a Play; therefore to pen, to act, or see it acted. To this I answer first; that the obscenity, ribaldry, amorousnesse, heathenishnesse, and prophanesse of most Play-bookes, Arcadiaes, and fained Histories that are now so much in admiration, is such, that it is not lawfull for any (especially for Children, Youthes, or those of the female sex, who take most pleasure in them) so much as once to read them, for feare they should inflame their lusts, and draw them on to actuall lewdnesse, and prophanesse. Hence Origen , Hierom and others informe us, that in ancient times Children and Youthes among the Iewes were not permitted to read the Booke of Canticles before they came to the age of 30. yeeres, for feare they should draw those spirituall love passages to a carnall sence, and make them instruments to inflame their lusts . Vpon which ground Origen adviseth all carnall persons, and those who are prone to lust, to forbeare the reading of this heavenly Song of Songs. Si enim aliquis accesserit, qui secundum carnem tantummodo vir est, huic tali non parum ex hac Scriptura discriminis periculigque nascetur. Audire enimpur e & castis auribus amoris nomina nesciens, ab interiori homine ad exteriorem & carnalem virum, omnem deflectat auditum, & a spiritu convertetur ad carnem: nutrietque in semetipso concupiscentias carnales, & occasione divinae Scripturae commoveri, & incitari videbitur ad libidinem carnis. Ob hoc ergo moneo & consilium do, omni qui nondum carnis & sanguinis molestijs caret, neque ab affectu naturae materialis abscedit, ut a lectione libelli hujus, eorumgque quae in eo dicentur, penitus temperet. Aiunt enim observari etia apud Hebraeos, quod nisiquis ad aetatem perfectam maturamque pervenerit, libellum hunc ne quidem in manibus tenere permittatur . If Children, yong men, and carnall persons then upon this ground, are thus advised to refraine the reading of this sacred canonicall Booke of Spirituall love expressions betweene Christ and his beloved Church: Ne sub recordatione sanctarum f aeminarum, &c. quae ibi nominantur, noxiae titulationis stimulus excitaretur, &c . How much more then ought they to forbeare the reading of lascivious amorous scurrilous Play-bookes, Histories, and Arcadiaes; there being no women, no youthes so exactly chaste, which may not easily be corrupted by them, and even inflamed unto fury with strange and monstrous lusts; since there is no stronger engine to assault and vanquish the chastity of any Matron, Girle or Widdow, of any male or female whatsoever, then these amorous Play-poets Poems and Histories, as Agrippa in his discourse of Bawdery , hath truely informed us. Atque tamen (writes hee) qu ae in his libris plurimum edocta puella est, quaeque horum scit jacere dicteria, & ex horum disciplina cum procis in multas horas facunde confabulari, haec demum est probe aulica .

Commandement, together with most Commentators on Ephes.5.2. 3,4 . have expresly condemned and prohibited Christians to pen, to print, to sell, to read, or Schoole-masters and others to teach any amorous wanton Play- bookes, Histories, or Heathen Authors, especially Ovids wanton Epistles and Bookes of love; Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Martiall, the Comedies of Plautus, Terence, and other such amorous Bookes savoring either of Pagan Gods, of ethnicke rites and ceremonies, or of scurrility, amorousnesse & prophanesse; as their alleaged places will most amply testifie to such who shall peruse them at their leisure : the reason of which is thus expressed by Isiodor Hispalensis, Iuo Carnotensis, & Gratian, Ideo prohibetur Christianis legere figmenta poetarum, quia per oblectamenta fabularum mentem nimis excitent ad incentiva libidinum. Non enim thura solum offerendo daemonibus immolatur, sed etiam [illeg.] dicta libentius capiendo . The penning and reading of all amorous Bookes was so execrable in the Primitive times, how ever they are much admired now, that Heliodorus Bishop of Trica was deprived of his Bishopricke by a Provinciall Synod, for those wanton amorous Bookes he had written in his youth, his bookes being likewise awarded to the fire to be burnt (though they are yet applauded and read by many amorous persons) quia lectione eorum juvenes multi in periculu conijcerentur: because divers yong men by reading of them might bee corrupted and entised unto lewdnesse; answerable to which memorable pious act are these Constitutions of the Councell of Burdeaux. An. 1582\. and of the Synod of Towres. Anno 1583\. well worth our observation. Quia multi a vera fide aberrantes contra professionem, etiam consulto gravius peccant, &c. Prohibet haec Synodus, ne libri magicae artis, vel ad lasciviam & luxum provocantes imprimantur, vendantur, legantur, aut retineantur omnino; jubetque sicut repertifuerint comburantur, sub ejusdem Anathematis paena quam ipso facto incurrunt, qui minime paruerint. Moneantur etiam saepissime fideles Christiani a suis Parochis & confessarijs ut fugiant, tanquam virus mortiferum, lectionem librorum quorumcumque, qui vel ad artes magicas pertinent, vel obscaenas & impias narrationes continent: eosque, utolim tempore Apostolorum factum legimus, comburant . Yea, Ignatius Loyola , the Father of the Iesuits, was so precise in this particular; That hee forbade the reading of Terence in Schooles to Children and Youthes, before his obscenities were expunged, lest he should more corrupt their manners by his wantonnesse, then by his Latine helpe their wits . And Æ neas Sylvius , afterwards Pope Pius the second, in his Tractate, De Liberorum Educatione , dedicated to Ladislaus King of Hungary and Bohemia ; discoursing what Authors and Poets are to be red to Children; resolves it thus. Ovidius ubique tristis, ubique dulcis est, in plerisque tamen locis nimium lascivus. Horatius sive fuit mult ae eloquentiae, &c. sunt tamen in eo quaedam quae tibi nec legere voluerim nec interpraetari. Martialis perniciosus, quamvis floridus & ornatus, ita tamen spinis densus est, ut legirosas absque punctione non sinat. Elegiam qui scribunt omnes puero negari debent; nimium enim sunt molles Tibullus, Propertius, Catullus, & quae translata est apud nos, Sapho, raro namque non amatoria scribunt, desertosque conqueruntur amores. Amoveantur igitur &c. Animadvertere etiam praeceptorem oportet dum tibi comaedos tragaedosque legit, ne quid vitij persuadere videatur . And in his 359. Epistle pag. 869. 870, Where hee repents him seriously of that amorous Treatise which he had penned in his youth, he writes thus to our present purpose. Tractatum de amore olim sensu pariterque aetate juvenes cum nos scripsisse recolimus, paenitentia immodica pudorque ac maeror animum nostrum vehementer excruciant: quippe qui sciamus quique protestati expresse fuimus, duo contineri in eo libello, apertam videlicet, sed heu lasciviam nimis prurientemque amoris historiam, & morale quod eam consequitur, edificans dogma. Quorum primum fatuos atque errantes video sectari quam plurimos, Alterum heu dolor, pene nullos. Ita impravatum est atque obfuscatum inf aelix mortalium genus. De amore igitur quae scripsimus olim juvenes, contemnite o mortales atque respuite; sequimini quae nunc dicimus, & seni magis quam juveni credite. Nec privatum hominem plures facite quam Pontificem: Æneam reijcite, Pium suscipite, &c . A passage which plainely informes us, that amorous Playes and Poems though intermixed with grave Sentences and Morals, are dangerous to be read or penned, because more will be corrupted by their amorousnesse, then instructed or edified by their Morals, as daily experience too well proves. If these authorities of Christians will not sufficiently convince us of the danger, the unlawfulnesse of reading amorous Bookes and Playes, the most assiduous studies of this our idle wanton age; consider then that Plato, a Heathen Philosopher, banished all Play-poets, and their Poems out of his Common-wealth; that the Lacedemonians, Massilienses, and at last the Athenians to, prohibited and suppressed all Playes and Play- poems, not suffring them to bee read or acted : that Aristotle, Plutarch, and Quintilian expresly condemned the reading of wanton, amorous, fabulous, obscene lascivious Poems and Writers; that Augustus banished Ovid for hisobscene, and panderly Bookes of love; and that Ovid himselfe disswaded men very seriously from reading his owne or other mens wanton Bookes and Poems, as being apt to inflame mens lusts, and to draw them on to whoredome, adultery, effeminacy, scurrility, and all kinde of beastly lewdnesse . And can Christians then approve or justifie the delightfull reading and revolving (that I say not the penning, studying, printing and venting) of such lewde amorous Bookes and Playes, which these very Heathen Authors have condemned, and so prove farre worse then Pagans? I shall therefore cloze up this first reply to this Objection with the words of learned reverend George Alley, (Bishop of Exeter , in the second yeere of Queene Elizabeths Raigne,) against the reading, writing, and Printing of wanton Bookes and Playes. It is to be lamented, that not onely in the time of the idolatrous and superstitious Church, but even in this time also lascivious impure, wanton Bookes, pearce into many mens houses and hands. Alas what doth such kinde of Bookes worke and bring with them? Forsooth nothing else but fire, even the burning flames of an unchaste minde, the brands of pleasure, the coles of filthinesse; the fire I say, that doth consume, devoure, and roote out all the nourishments of vertue, the fire I say, which is a proeme and entrance into the eternall fire of Hell. What is so expedient unto a Common-wealth as not to suffer witches to live? for so the Lord commanded by his servant Moses. And (I pray you) be not they worse then an hundred Witches, which take mens senses from them? not with magicall delusions, but with the enchantments of dame Venus, and as it were to give them Circes cup to drinke of, and so of men to make them beasts. What punishment deserve they as either make or print such unsavory Bookes; truely I would wish them the same reward wherewith Alexander Severus recompenced his very familiar Vetronius Turinus, ut fumo videlicet pereant qui fumum vendunt, that they perish with smoke who sell smoke. And what other things doe these set forth to sale, but smoke, ready to breake out into flames? For, that certaine persons bequeath themselves wholy to the reading of such lascivious and wanton Bookes, who knoweth not, that thereof commeth the first preparative of the minde, that when any one sparke of fire (be it never so little) falls into the tinder of Lady Venus, suddenly it is set on fire as towe or flaxe. Many doe read the verses which Lycoris the Strumpet, the Paramour of Gallus the Poet did read, and the verses which Corynna mentioned in Ovid, and which Ne aera did read. It will perchance be replyed, that they doe read them, either for the increase of knowledge, or to drive away idlenesse. I answer, If any doe salute Venus, but a limine, as they say, that is, a farre off, as it were in the entrie, what kindling and flames, I pray you, will ensue thereof when the coles bee once stirred? It is to be feared that no small number of them who professe Christianity, be in this respect a great deale worse then the Heathen. The people called Massilienses, before they knew Christ, yea, or heard whether there were a Christ, but were very Pagans, and sacrificers to Idols, yet were knowne to all the world to be of such pure and uncorrupt manners, that the manners of the Massilienses ( as Plautus testifieth) are commonly counted the best and most approoved manners of all others. These among many other good orders of their well nurtured City made a severe law, that there should be no Comedy played within their City, for the argument for the most part of such Playes, did containe the acts of dissolute and wanton love. They had also within their City (about 613. yeeres before the birth of Christ) a Sword of execution where with the guilty and offenders should be slaine; but the uprightnesse of their living was such, that the Sword not being used was eaten with rust, and nothing meet to serve that turne: And alas are not almost all places in these dayes replenished with Iuglers, Scoffers, Iesters, Players , which may say and doe what they lust be it never so fleshly and filthy? and yet suffred with laughing and clapping of hands ? Hiero Syracusanus, did punish Epicharmus the Poet, because he rehearsed certaine wanton verses in the presence of his wife, for hee would that in his house not onely other parts of the body should be chaste, but the eares also, which be unto other members of the body in stead of a tunnell, to be kept , sartas tectas, that is, defended and covered, as the proverbe saith, and to be shut from all uncomely and ribaldry talke. Vnto which fact of Hiero, the worthy sentence of Pericles is much consonant and agreeable . Sophocles, who was joynt fellow with Pericles in the Pretorship, beholding and greatly praysing the well favored beauty of a certaine Boy passing by him, was rebuked of Pericles his companion after this sort: Not onely the hands of him that is a Pretor ought to refraine from lucre of money, but also the eyes to bee continent from wanton lookes. The Athenians provided very well for the integrity of their Judges, that it should not be lawful for any of the Areopagites to write any Comedy or Play: and Epicharmus suffred punishment at the hands of Hiero for the rehearsall of certaine unchaste verses. But I speake it with sorrow of heart; to our vicious Ballad-makers, and indictors of lewde Songs and Playes, no revengment, but rewards are largely payd and given : Gerardas a very ancient man of Lacedemonia, being demanded of his Hoste, what paine adulterers suffred at Sparta, made this answer: O mine Hoste, there is no adulterer among us neither can there be : (prey marke the reason:) For this was the manner among them, that they were never present at any Comedy, nor any other Playes, fearing lest they should heare and see those things which were repugnant to their lawes. But to revert to our purpose: Wanton Bookes, can bee no other thing but the fruits of wanton men, who although they write any one good sentence in their Workes, yet for the unworthinesse of the person the sentence is rejected. The Senators of Lacedemonia would have refused a very worthy and apt saying of one Demosthenes, for the unworthinesse of the Author, if certaine men of authority called among them Ephori, had not come betweene, and caused another of the Senators to have pronounced the sentence againe, as his owne saying . Plutarch writeth, that there was a law among the Grecians, that even the good Bookes of ill men should be destroyed, that the memory of the Authors also, should thereby utterly be blotted out and cleane put away , Gerson; sometimes Chancellor of Paris, speaking of a certaine Booke made by Ioannes Meldinensis, the title whereof is the Romant of the Rose, writeth of that Booke two things. First, he saith, if I had the Romant of the Rose, and that there were but one of them to bee had, and might have for it 500\. Crownes, I would rather burne it then sell it. Againe, saith he, if I did understand that Ioannes Meldinensis did not repent with true sorrow of minde, for the making and setting forth of this Booke, I would pray no more for him, then I would for Iudas Iscariot, of whose damnation I am most certaine. And they also which reading this Booke, doe apply it unto wicked and wanton manners, are the Authors of his great paine and punishment. The like Ioannes Raulius said of the Booke and Fables of one Operius Danus, that hee was a most damned man, unlesse he repented and acknowledged his fault, for the setting forth of that Booke. I would God they heard these things whom it delighteth to write or read such shamelesse and lascivious workes. Let them remember the saying of Saint Paul; A man shall reape that which hee hath sowen . Chrysostome, a great enhaunser of Pauls prayses, writeth; that so long shall the rewards of Paul rise more and more, how long there shall remaine such, which shall either by his life or doctrine be brought unto the Lord God. The same may we say of all such, who while they lived have sowne ill seed, either by doing, saying, writing, or reading, that unlesse they repented, the more persons that are made ill by them, the more sharpe and greater growth their paine, as Saint Augustine wrote of Arrius. God save every Christian heart, from either the delighting or reading of such miserable monuments . Thus concludes this reverend Bishop, and so shall I this first reply. Secondly, admit it be lawfull to read Playes or Comedies now and then for recreation sake, yet the frequent constant reading of Play-bookes, of other prophane lascivious amorous Poems, Histories, and discourses, (which many now make their daily study;) to read more Playes then Sermons, then Bookes of piety and devotion, then Bookes or Chapters of the Bible, then Authors that should enable men in their callings, or fit them for the publike good, must needs be sinfull, as all the forequoted authorities witnesse, because it avocates mens mindes from better and more sacred studies, on which they should spend their time, and fraughts them onely with empty words and vanities, which corrupt them for the present, and binde them over to damnation for the future. The Scripture we know commands men, not to delight in vanity, in old wives tales, in fabulous poeticall discourses, or other empty studies which tend not to our spirituall good : Not to lay out our money for that which is not bread, and our labour for that which satisfieth not: but to redeeme the time, because the dayes are evill . Yea, it commands men to be fruitfull and abundant in all good workes ; to be holy in all manner of conversation ; to be alwayes doing and receiving good, and finishing that worke which God hath given them to doe, growing every day more and more in grace, and in the knowledge of God and Christ , laying up a good foundation against the time to come , and perfecting holinesse in the feare of God , giving all diligence to make their calling and election sure: doing all they doe to the praise and glory of God . Now the ordinary reading of Comedies, Tragedies, Arcadiaes, Amorous Histories, Poets, and other prophane Discourses, is altogether inconsistent with all and every of these sacred Precepts, therefore it cannot bee lawfull. Besides the Scripture commands men even wholy to abandon all idle words , all vaine unprofitable discourses, thoughts and actions. If then it gives us no liberty so much as to thinke a vaine thought, or to utter an idle word , certainely it alots us no vacant time for the reading of such vaine wanton Playes or Bookes. Againe, God enjoynes us, that our speech should be alwayes profitable and gracious, seasoned with salt, that so it may administer grace to the hearers, and build them up in their most holy faith: Therefore our writings, our studies, our reading must not be unedifying, amorous and prophane, which ought to be as holy as serious, and profitable as our discourses. Moreover, it is the expresse precept of the Apostle Paul , (whom many prophane ones will here taxe of Puritanisme) Eph. 4. 29. &c. 5. 3, 4. But fornication and all uncleanesse, or covetousnesse, let it not be once named among you as becommeth Saints: neither filthinesse, nor foolish talking nor jesting, which are not convenient, &c. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouthes but that which is good to edifie profitably, that it may minister grace to the hearers, &c . And may wee then read or write these sinnes and vices which we ought not to name? or study or peruse such wanton Playes and Pamplets, which can administer nought but gracelesnesse, lust, prophanesse to the Readers? Lastly, wee are commanded to search the Scriptures daily: to meditate in the Law of God day and night, and to read therein all the dayes of our lives, that we may learne to feare the Lord, and to keepe and doe all the workes and Statutes of his Law; which was King Davids study all the day long, yea, in the night season to: And because no time should bee left for any vaine studies or discourses; we are further enjoyned, to have the Word of God alwayes in our hearts; to teach it diligently to our children, and to talke of it when we are sitting in our houses, and when wee are walking by the way, when we lye downe, and when we rise up: Which for any man now conscionably to performe, is no lesse then arrant Puritanisme, in the worlds account. If then we believe these sacred precepts (to which I might adde two more; Pray continually. Rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, and againe I say rejoyce ) to bee the Word of God, and so to binde us to obedience; there are certainely no vacant times alotted unto Christians, to read any idle Books or Play-house Pamphlets, which are altogether incompatible with these precepts, and the serious pious study of the sacred Scripture, as S. Hierom writes. Qu ae enim (quoth he) comunicatio luci ad tenebras? qui consensus Christo cum Belial? quid facit cum Psalterio Horatius? cum Evangelijs Maro? cum Apostolis Cicero? Et licet omnia munda mundis & nihil reijciendum quod cum gratiarum actione percipitur; tamen simul non debemus bibere calicem Christi, & calicem Daemoniorum ; as he there proves by his owne example, which I would wish all such as make prophane Playes and human Authors their chiefest studies, even seriously to consider; For saith he, when ever I fell to read the Prophets after I had beene reading Tully and Plautus, Sermo horrebat incultus , their uncompt stile became irkesome to me; & quia lumen c aecis oculis non videbam, non oculorum putabam culpam esse, sed solis. Whiles the old Serpent did thus delude me, a strong feaver shed into my bones, invaded my weake body, and brought me even to deaths doore: at which time I was suddenly rapt in spirit unto the Tribunall of a Iudge, where there was such a great and glorious light as cast me downe upon my face, that I durst not looke up. And being then demanded what I was, I answered, I am a Christian: whereupon the Iudge replyed, thou lyest: Ciceronianus es, non Christianus: thou art a Ciceronian, not a Christian: for where thy treasure is, there also is thy heart: whereupon I grew speechlesse, and being beaten by the Iudges command, and tortured with the fire of conscience; I began to cry out and say, Lord have mercy upon me. Whereupon those who stood by falling down at the Iudges feet, intreated that he would give pardon to my youth, and give place of repentance to my error: exacturus deinde cruciatum si gentilium litterarum libros aliquando legissem. I being then in so great a strait, that I could be content to promise greater things, began to sweare and protest by his Name, saying, Domine si unquam habuero codices seculares, si legero, te negavi. And being dismissed upon this my oath I returned to my selfe againe, and opened my eyes, drenched with such a showre of teares, that the very extremity of my griefe would even cause the incredulous to believe this trance, which was no slumber or vaine dreame, but a thing really acted, my very shoulders being blacke and blue with stripes, the paine of which remained after I awaked. Since which time saith he; Fateor me tanto dehinc studio divina legisse, quanto non ante mortalia legeram . And from hence this Father exhorts all Christians to give over the reading of all prophane Bookes, all wanton Poems, which in his 146. Epistle to Damasus , hee most aptly compares to the Huskes with which the Prodigall in the Gospell was fed ; where hee writes thus fitly to our purpose. Possumus & aliter siliquas interpraetari. Daemonum cibus est carmina poetarum, saecularis sapientia, rhetoricorum pompa verborum. Haec suae omnes suavitate delectant, & dum aures versibus dulci modulatione currentibus capiuntur, animam quoque penetrant, & pectoris interna devinciunt. Verum, ubi cum summo studio fuerint, & labore perlecta, nihil aliud nisi inanem sonum, & sermonum strepitum suis lectoribus tribuunt, nulla ibi saturitas veritatis, nulla refectio justitiae reperitur: studio si earum in fame veri, in virtutum penuria perseverant. Vnde & Apostolus prohibet ; ne in Idolio quis recumbat, &c. Nonne tibi videtur sub alijs verbis dicere, ne legas Philosophos, Oratores, Poetas, nec in illorum lectione requiescas? Nec nobis blandiamur, si in eis, quae sum scripta, non credimus, cum aliorum conscientia vulneretur & putemur probare, quae dum legimus, non reprobamus, Absit au de ore Christiano sonet, Iuppiter omnipotens, & me Hercule, & me Castor, & caetera magis portenta quam numina. At nunc etiam Sacerdotes Dei (and is not as true of our times?) omissis Evangelijs & Prophetis, videmus Comaedias legere, amatoria Bucolicorum versuum verba canere, tenere Virgilium, & id, quod in pueris necessitatis est, crimen in se facere voluptatis. Cavendum igitur si captivam velimus habere uxorem, ne in idolio recumbamus: aut si certe fuerimus ejus amore decepti, mundemus eam, & omni sordium errore purgemus, ne scandalum patiatur frater pro quo Christus mortuus, cum in ore Christiani carmina, in idolorum laudem composita, audierit personare . Since therefore all these idle Play-bookes and such like amorous Pastorals are but empty huskes, which yeeld no nourishment but to Swine, or such as wallow in their beastly lusts and carnall pleasures; since they are incompatible with the pious study and diligent reading of Gods sacred Word, ( the gold, the hony, the milke, the marrow, the heavenly Manna, feast and sweatest nourishment of our soules,) with the serious hearing, reading, meditation, thoughts and study whereof we should alwayes constantly feed, refresh, rejoyce, and feast our spirits , which commonly starve and pine away whiles we are too much taken up with other studies or imployments, especially with Playes and idle amorous Pamphlets: (the very reading of which S. Augustine, repented and condemned:) let us hencefore lay aside such unprofitable, unchristian studies, betaking our selves wholly at leastwise principally to Gods sacred Word, which is onely able to make us wise unto salvation, and to nourish our soules unto eternall life: & since Christianity is our general profession, let not Paganisme, scurrility, prophanes, wantonnes, amorousnesse, Playes, or lewde Poeticall Figments or Histories, but Gods Word alone, which as Sumula Raymundi saith, transcends all other Bookes & Sciences ; be our chiefest study, at all such vacant times as are not occupied in our lawfull callings, or other pious duties. I shal therefore cloze up this 2. reply, with that Apostolicall Constitution recorded by Clemens Romanus , (if the Booke bee his) which I would wish al Papists who deny the reading of the Scripture unto Lay-men, to who this good precept is directed as the very Title and first Chapter proves, even seriously to consider. Sed sive ad fideles & ejusdem sententiae homines accedis, conferens cum ijs vitalia verba loquere: sin minus accedis, intus sedens percurre legem, Reges, Prophetas: Psalle hymnos David , lege diligenter Evangelium, quod est horu complementu. Abstine ab omnibus Gentiliu libris. Quid enim tibi cum externis libris, vel legibus, vel Prophetis? qu ae quidem leves a fide abducunt. Nam quid tibi deest in lege Dei, ut ad illas gentium fabulas confugias? Nam si historica percurrere cupis, habes Reges: si sophistica & Prophetica, habes Prophetas, & Iob, & Proverbiorum authorem, in quibus omnis poeticae, & sapientiae accuratam rationem invenies; quoniam Domini Dei, qui solus est sapiens, voces sunt. Quod si cantilenas cupis, habes Psalmos: si rerum origines nosse desideras, habes Genesim: si leges & praaecepta, gloriosam Dei legem. Ab omnibus igitur exteris & diabolicis libris vehementer te contine , quoniam in ipso verbo sunt omnia. Ibi remedium vulnerum, ibi subsidia necessitatum, ibi resarcitus defectuum, ibi profectuum copi ae, ibi denique quicquid acipere vel habere hominibus expedit, quicquid decet, quicquid oportet. Sine causa ergo aliud a verbo petitur, cum ipsum sit omnia . Thirdly, admit a man may lawfully read a Play-book, yet it will not follow, that therefore he may pen, or act a Play, or see it acted . For first, a man may lawfully read such things, as hee cannot pen, or act, or behold without offending God. A man perchance may lawfully read a Masse-booke, but yet he cannot write a Masse-booke, nor yet act, or say, or see a Masse without committing sinne. Some men may lawfully read an Alcoran , or any hereticall Booke, ut magis judicent qu am sequantur ; rather to confute then follow it; but no man can pen, or print, or publish it with delight, (no nor yet read it out of love and liking, as men read Play-bookes) but he must transgresse. A man may safely read the stories of the Sodomites sinnes, of the Cananites and Israelites Idolatries ; but yet to act, or see them acted cannot bee lesse then sinfull. A man may and must daily read the sacred Scriptures, the Passion of our Saviour, the Histories of Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Iob , and others recited in the Bible; yet none may Play or see them Played without sinne, yea highest blasphemie and prophanesse ; though some gracelesse wretches as well in private as in popular Stage-playes much prophane them, bringing not onely Ministers, preaching and praying, but even the very sacred Bible and the stories in it on the Stage , as some late notorious damnable (if not damned) precedents witnesse ; when as not onely our owne pious Statute of 3\. Iacobi. cap. 21 . but likewise Concilium Rhemense, Anno 1583. which decrees thus: Vt ea vitent fideles quibus cultus divinus impediri potest, statuimus, ne quis Scriptur ae sacrae verba ad scurrilia, detrectationes, superstitiones, incantationes, sortes, libellos famosos audeat usurpare. Si quis contra fecerit, juris & arbitrij paenis coerceatur: And Concilium Bituriense. Anno 1554 . which thus ordaines. Non liceat cuiquam verba & sententias sacrae Scripturae ad scurrilia, fabulosa, vana, adulationes, detractiones, superstitiones, & diabolicas incantationes, divinationes, sortes, libellos famosos, & alias ejusmodi impietates usurpare: Qui in eo peccaverint, ab Episcopis legitimis paenis coercetur: together with the Synod of Rochell. An. 1571 . (here p. 636.)  & BB. Gardener have long since prohibited and condemned this atheisticall horrid prophanesse, which no Christian can so much as thinke off, but with highest detestation. Since therefore many things may be lawfully read, which cannot honestly be penned, acted, heard or seene, the argument is but a meere inconsequent. Secondly, though a man perchance may in some cases lawfully read a Play-booke, yet it will not follow, that he may compose, or act, or see a Stage-play: For first, a man may read a Play with detestation both of its vanity, ribaldry and prophanesse; but he can neither pen, nor play, nor yet very willingly behold it, as all Play-haunters doe, without approbation and delight. Secondly, a man may read a Play without any prodigall vaine expence of money, or over-great losse of time: but none can compile, or act, or see a Stage- play without losse of time, of money , which should bee better imployed: Thirdly, Stage-playes may be privately read over without any danger of infection by ill company, without any publike infamy or scandall, without giving any ill example, without any incouraging or maintaining of Players in their ungodly profession, or without participating with them in their sinnes; but they can neither be compiled, beheld , or acted, without these severall unlawfull circumstances which cannot be avoyded. Fourthly, Stageplayes may be read without using or beholding any effeminate amorous, lustfull gestures, complements, kisses, dalliances, or embracements; any whorish, immodest, fantastique, womanish apparell, Vizards, disguises; any lively representations of Venery, whoredome, adultery, and the like, which are apt to enrage mens lusts: without hypocrisie, feining, cheats, lascivious tunes and dances, with such other unlawfull Stage ingredients or concomitants: but they can neither be seene nor acted, without all, or most of these . Fiftly, he that reades a Stage-play may passe by all obscene or amorous passages, all prophane or scurrill Iests, all heathenish oathes and execrations even with detestation; but he who makes, who acts, who heares, or viewes a Stage-play acted, hath no such liberty left him, but hee must act, recite, behold and heare them all. Yea sometimes such who act the Clowne or amorous person, adde many obscene lascivious jests and passages of their owne, by way of appendix, to delight the auditors, which were not in their parts before. Lastly, when a man reads a Play, he ever wants that viva vox , that flexanimous rhetoricall Stage-elocution, that lively action and representation of the Players themselves which put life and vigor into these their Enterludes, and make them pierce more deepely into the Spectators eyes, their eares and lewde affections, precipitating them on to lust: yea, the eyes, the eares of Play-readers want all those lust-enraging objects, which Actors and Spectators meet with in the Play-house: Therefore though the reading of Stage- playes may be lawfull, yet the composing, acting, or seeing of them in all these several regards, cannot be so. So that this first Objection is both false and frivolous. The second Objection for the composing and acting of Playes is this. The penning and acting of Playes doth whet & exercise mens wits and poetry, embolden youth, confirme their voyces, helpe their memories, action and elocution; and make them perfect Orators. Therefore it is both lawfull, yea and usefull to. To this I answer first: that this Objection makes onely for academicall and private, but nought for popular Enterludes. Secondly, academicall Stage-playes are seldome acted or penned for any of the ends, the uses here recorded, but onely for entertainement, for mirth and pleasure sake. Thirdly, men must not doe evill that good may come of it: therefore they may not exercise their wits, their inventions about lascivious amorous Play-house Poems; they may not strengthen or stuffe their memories with such vaine lewde empty froth as Playes now are; nor embolden themselves by acting effeminate, scurrile, whorish, impudent, or immodest parts: nor yet helpe their action, their elocution by uttering, by personating any unlawfull things, which may either draw or tempt them unto lewdnesse. We know that frequenting of Tavernes and Brothels; courting of impudent Strumpets, keeping of deboist company, reading of amorous Bookes and Pastorals, adde spirit and boldnesse unto men, yea oft improve their elocution, carriage, and amorous fond discourse, as much or more then Playes, yet none may use these wicked courses to obtaine these petty benefits; no more then he may oppresse, or steale, or cheate, or perjure himselfe to augment his wealth, or use charmes and sorceries to recover health. Fourthly, Melius est aliquid nescire, qu am cum periculo discere . The hurt, the danger that accrues to men by penning, by acting Playes, is evermore farre greater then the good, the benefits here alleaged: the evill is certaine, the good, uncertaine: it is no wisedome, no safety therefore to plung men into sundry great and certaine evils, to atchieve some probable meane emoluments. Fiftly, the good that comes by penning or acting Playes, is onely temporall; the hurt, the mischiefe is eternall; the good extends no further then mens bodies; the damage reacheth to their soules, yea oft unto their bodies, goods and names: it is no discretion then for men to hazard the losse, the damage of their soules, for such petty improvements of their bodies. Sixtly, there is little or no analogie betweene the action, the elocution of Players, of Orators and Divines: The principall prayse of Actors is a lively counterfeiting and representation of the parts, the persons they sustaine, by corporall gestures rather then by words: the chiefest prayse of Orators is to expresse, to describe the things they speake of in an elegant flexanimous phrase, and grave elocution: the duty of the one being to represent things to the eye, whereas the other speaks onely to the eare. Which diversity is warranted both by the story of Cicero the Orator, and Roscius the Actor , who, as Macrobius writes, did use to contend together; Vtrum ille s aepius eandem sententia varijs gestibus efficeret, an ipse per eloquentiae copiam sermone diverso pronunciaret: by the very stiles of Actor, and Orator , the first, importing onely corporall gestures, and representations; the other, verball expressions; and by the usuall phrases of seeing a Stage-play, and hearing an Oration . Now what proportion is there betweene gestures and words? betweene acting and speaking well, that one should be such a helpe or furtherance to the other? Alas what profit, what advantage can an Orator gaine by acting an amorous females, a Bawdes, a Panders, a Ruffians, Drunkards, Murtherers, Lovers, Soldiers, Kings, Tyrants, Fayries, Furies, Devils or Pagan Idols part with suitable gestures and speeches? tell me I beseech you, what furtherances these are to make a perfect Orator, who though hee may plead or speake for others, must act no other man but himselfe alone, whereas Players must never act themselves but other parts? Certainely if wee believe Quintilian , or a late famous Orator of our owne, the acting of Playes, which is full of wantonnesse, of light, of lewde, of foolish gestures and speeches, is the next way to marre an Orator, whose speech, action and deportment must be grave and serious. Hence Quintilian (as eminent an Orator as most now extant) in his directions how an Orator should frame his speech, his voyce and gesture, expresly forbids him, to imitate the voyce or gestures of Players, or to expresse or act the slaves, the drunkards, lavers, penni-fathers, cowards, or any such Play-house part, because as they were no wayes necessary for an Orator, so they will rather corrupt his minde and manners, then any wayes helpe his elocution or action . The acting therefore of Playes is no wayes necessary or usefull for an Orator, it being no furtherance but an apparant obstacle to true oratory, action, elocution; there being no analogie betweene the wanton amorous gestures, speeches, Pastorals, jests, and florishes of a Poet, an Actor; and the sad, grave, serious elocution or action of an Orator. And as Play-acting is no wayes usefull for an Orator, so much lesse for a Minister, or Divine, there being no Analogie betweene Preachers and Players, Sermons and Playes, Theaters and Churches , betweene the sacred, sober, chaste, and modest gestures, the soule-saving speeches of the one, and the lascivious, scurrill, prophane, ungodly action and discourses of the other. Hence the forementioned Councels, Fathers and Canonists , together with Concilium Foro-juliense, Can.6 . which I before omitted, have inhibited Ministers and Clergie men from penning, acting and beholding Stage-playes, as being no wayes suitable, but altogether incompatible with their most holy and grave profession: Hence also they excluded all common Actors, (and likewise academicall to, till they had done publike penance) from the Ministeriall function; the acting of Playes being so far from making men fit for the ministry, that it made them both unfit, and likewise uncapable to receive it . What therefore Agis junior replyed to a wicked fellow who oft demanded of him, Quis esset Spartanorum optimus? Quitui est dissimilimus ; the same may I say of Ministers; that hee is the best Minister who is most unlike a Player both in his gesture, habit, speech and elocution. Hence Saint Ambrose, Bishop of Millaine, refused to give Ecclesiasticall Orders to one who sued for them, and likewise deprived another (who afterwards fell to the Arian heresie) Quia lucebat in eorum incessu species qu aedam scurrarum percursantium : condemning not onely all those Clergie men, but also Laymen to, who used Playerly gestures, qui sensim ambulando imitantur histrionicos gestus, & quasi quaedam fercula pomparum, & statuarum motus nutantium, ut quotiescunque gradum transferunt modulos quosdam servare videantur : a vice too common in this our antique wanton age. We that know that all Christians, and more especially Ministers, ought to be sober, modest, grave, chaste, both in their gesture and deportment ; Hence Concilium Senonense. An. 1528. Decreta Morum.cap.25 . decrees thus. Clerici in incessu quoque honestatem exhibeant, ut gravitate itineris, mentis maturitutem ostendant. Incompositio enim corporis, risus dissolutus, indecens oculorum vagatis, in aequalitatem indicant mentis . And then it proceeds thus. Non in scenam velut histriones prodeant; non com aedias vernaculas agant; non spectaculum corporis sui faciant in publico privatove loco (pray marke it:) Qu ae omnia cum omnibus sacerdotibus sunt indecora, & ordini clericali multum detrahentia, tum illis praecipue, quibus animarum cura est commissa . An infallible evidence that histrionicall gestures, and the acting of Stage-playes either in publike or private, are no wise usefull, but altogether scandalous, and unseemely for a Minister; and that the acting, the beholding of Playes, will make men amorous, wanton, light and Playerlike in their gestures , as Saint Chrysostome with others largely testifie. And as Theatricall gestures are altogether unseemely in a Minister, (whence Protestants condemne all Masse-priests gestures, crouchings and noddings in the celebrating or acting of their Masses, which they compare to Playes ,) So likewise are all poeticall Play-house phrases, Clinches and strong lines, as now some stile them; (too frequent in our Sermons; which in respect of their Divisions, language, action, stile, and subject matter , consisting either of wanton flashes of luxurious wits, or meere quotations of humane Authors, Poets, Orators, Histories, Philosophers, and Popish Schoole-men; or sesquipedalia verba , great empty swelling words of vanity and estimation more fitter for the Stage, from whence they are oft- times borrowed, (then the Pulpet,) unsutable for Ministers qui dum indeceter elegantes videre volunt passim jam turpibus verbis impudenter insaniant. Ministers are Gods Ambassadors, therefore they must speake nothing in the Pulpit but those words which God shall put into their mouthes; they must deliver Gods message in his owne dialect ; not in the language of Poets, and other humane Authors, in which Gods spirit never breathes . They are Christs Vnder-Shepheards , therefore they must speake unto their Flockes in Christs owne voyce, which they must onely know and heare, and follow, not in the voyce of strangers, whose voyce they will not, yea they must not heare : They are the Ministers, the mouth of Christ, therefore they must onely preach and speake his language : They have no other Commission, but to goe and preach the Gospell , (not Histories and Poets) unto men : They are the Stewards of the misteries, and manifold graces of the Gospell, of the milke and bread of Gods holy Word; and these alone they must dispence : They are sent out by God for no other purpose, but onely to open mens eyes; and to turne them from darkenesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgivenesse of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified through faith that is in Christ Jesus : therefore they must come unto them, not with the dimme lights of human learning, but with the light, the brightnesse of the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ : not with entising words of mans wisedome (which never yet converted or saved any one soule,) but in demonstration of the spirit and of power : not with the wisedome of this world, which human Authors teach, but with the wisedome of God in a mistery, which the holy Ghost teacheth : not with philosophie and vaine deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ: but with the Word and Gospell of Christ , the mighty power of God unto salvation, which is able (yea onely able) to save mens soules . Hence Saint Hierom writes thus to Nepotianus, Docente te in Ecclesia non clamor populi, sed gemitus suscitetur. Lachryme auditoru laudes tu ae sint. Sermo Presbyteri Scripturarum lectione conditus sit. Nolo te declamatorem esse & rabulam, garrulumque sine ratione, sed mysteriorum peritum, & sacramentorum Dei tui peritissimum. Verba voluere, & celeritate dicendi apud imperitum vulgus admirationem facere, indoctorum hominum est, &c . Hence Prosper Aquitanicus positively affirmes, Quod non se debeat Ecclesi ae doctor de accurati sermonis ostentatione jactare, ne videatur Ecclesiam Dei non velle aedificare, sed magis se quantae sit eruditionis ostendere. Non igitur in verborum splendore, sed in operum virtute totam praedicandi fiduciam ponat: non vocibus delectetur populi acclamantis sibi, sed fletibus, nec plausum a populo studeat expectare sed gemitum. Hoc specialiter doctor Ecclesiasticus elaboret, quo fiunt qui audiunt eum sanis disputationibus meliores, non vana assentatione fautores. Lachrymas quas vult a suis auditoribus fundi, ipse primitus fundat, & sic eos compunctione sui cordis accendat. Tam simplex & apertus, etiam seminus Latinus, disciplinatus tamen & gravis sermo debet esse Pontisicis ut ab intelligentia sui nullos, quamvis imperitos, excludat: sed in omnium audientium pectus cum quadam delectatione descendat. Denique alia est ratio declamatorum, & alia debet esse doctorum. Illi elucubratae declamationis pompam totis facundia suae viribus concupiscunt: isti sobriousitatoque sermone Christi gloriam querunt. Illi rebus inanibus pretiosa verborum induunt ornamenta, isti veracibus sententijs ornant, & commendant verba simplicia. Illi affectant suorum sensuum deformitatem tanquam velamine quodam phalerati sermonis abscondere; isti eloquiorum suorum rusticitatem student pretiosis sensibus venustare. Illi totam laudem suam in favore vulgi, isti in virtute Dei constituunt. Illi plausibiliter dicunt, & nihil auditoribus suis declamando proficiunt: isti usitatis sermonibus docent, & imitatores svos instituunt; quia rationem suam nulla fucatae compositionis affectatione corrumpunt. Isti sunt ministri verbi, adjutores Dei, oraculum Spiritus sancti. Per tales Deus placatur populo, populus instruitur Deo . Hence Isiodor Pelusiota writes thus sharply to Theopompus and Talel aeus two preaching Monkes. Quis te comicis salibus non perstringat? Quis te non commiseretur, quicum in philosophi ae discipulorum Domini tranquillitate sedeas, Gentilium historicorum & poetarum tumultum atque aestum tecum trahas? Quid enim dic qu aeso, apud illos est, quod religioni nostrae sit praeferendum? Quid non mendacio ac risuscatet ex ijs quae magno studio consectantur? An non divinitates ex vitiosis affectionibus? An non fortia facinor a pro vitiosis affectionibus? An non certamina pro vitiosis affectionibus? Quamobrem ipsam quoque faeditatis & obscaenitatis lectionem fuge (nam & ea miram ad aporienda vulnera jam cicatrice obducta vim habet:) ne alioqui vehementiori cum impetu spiritus improbus revertatur, ac deteriorem ac perniciosiorem tibi priore ignorantia aut negligentia cladem inferat: Sermo, qui ad audientium utilitatem habetur, potens sermo est, quique optimo jure sermo appelletur, imitationemque ad Deum habeat. At qui voluptate sola ac plausu terminatur, aeris sonitus est, magno strepitu aurem personans. Quare aut sermonem tuam gravitate moderare, ac sermonis fastui ac pompae mediocritatem antepone, aut te cymbalum theatrorum scenae accomodum esse scito. And hence is that lamentable complaint of Episcopus Chemnensis: Modernis autem temporibus in academijs publicis scientia duntaxit mundana invaluit, scientia Dei non est in terra. Sacrarum literarum doctrina ubique prorsus perijt, doctores scientia inflati docent suum chere, circumferuntur omni vento doctrin ae. Sicut gentes, ambulant in vanitate sensus sui, tenebris habentes obscuratum intellectum, propter caecitatem cordis ipsorum. Caeci speculatores educunt discipulos caecos in viam quam nesciunt, ponunt tenebras in lucem, & prava in recta, & nox nocti indicat scientiam. Et sic ubique suos seducunt oratores. Extollunt doctrinam Aristotelis, Averrois, & aliorum Gentilium Scribarum, ad excogitandum profunda & voraginosa dogmata, obscurantia solem sapientiae Christianae ac Evangelicae, vitae, ac purum aerem religiosi status suis fastuosis verbis, acutisque disputationibus, ac sophisticis garrulitatibus maculantia. Modo equidem cernimus omnia fere gymnasia ubiolim tradebatur theologica doctrina, poeticis figmentis, vanis nugis, ac fabulosis portentis esse impleta. Vbi est literatus? Vbi legis verba ponderans? ubi est doctor parvulorum? videbis populum alti sermonus, ita ut non possis intelligere disertitudinem lingu ae ejus, in quo nulla est sapientia. Atqui praedicatores concionarij student, non ut syncero affectu, sed gratia propriae laudis & verbis ornatis & politis aures auditorum demulceant. Meliores autem sunt sermones veriores quam disertiores. De talibus doctoribus disertis inquit Salvator. In vanum me colunt, docentes doctrinas & praecepta hominum: relinquentes enim mandata Dei, tenetis traditiones hominum . All which recited passages, are sufficient testimonies, that poeticall streines of wit and Playerly eloquence, are no wayes tolerable, much lesse then commendable in a preaching Minister. Therefore the acting, the penning of Playes, is no wayes necessary or usefull for Clergie men to further them in their ministry. All the benefit that Schollers reape by acting Playes, is this; that it makes them histrionicall, antique, unprofitable verball, Preachers , more fit for a Play-house then a Pulpit. The acting and penning therefore of Stage-playes is no wayes helpefull either for an Orator or a Preacher, as the Objectors dreame, Lastly, men may learne boldnesse, eloquence, action, elocution by farre readier, easier, and and more laudable meanes then the penning or acting Playes; as by frequent Declamations, and often repetitions of eloquent Orations , and the like; the onely meanes Quintilian prescribes, and the ordinary method that all Schoole-masters  & Tutors use, to make men perfect Orators : no need therefore of penning, of acting Playes, for these pretended ends, which it cannot effect. We never read that the Apostles, Prophets, and elegant Fathers of old, (as Cyprian, Basil, Nazianzen, Chrysostome, Ambrose, Hierom, Augustine, Leo, Gregory the Great, Chrysologus, Bernard , and such other unparaleld Christian Preachers; that Demosthenes, Cicero , or Quintilian , the most accomplished Heathen Orators for action, phrase, and elocution that the world hath knowne,) did ever attaine to their perfectio of Oratory by acting Playes: neither have we heard of any Orators of latter times who hve trod this unknowne path to elocution, to perfect rhetoricke by acting Playes; yea I have not read to my remembrance of any one common Actor or Play-poet, that was an exquisite Orator: The acting therefore of Playes is but a preposterous Spurious course, to traine up youthes to an oratoricall grave comely action or elocution, who should rather be educated in the feare and nurture of the Lord, in the Grounds and Principles of Religion, in the knowledge and study of the Scriptures ; in honest callings, Sciences, Arts, imployments, which might benefit themselves and others, then in penning or acting Stage-playes, which hath alwayes beene condemned as infamous, both by Christians and Pagans too. The 3. Objection for the composing and acting of Playes, is this: That they dilucidate and well explaine many darke obscure Histories, imprinting them in mens mindes in such indelible Characters, that they can hardly bee oblitterated: Therefore they are usefull and commendable. To this I answer first, that this Objection extends not unto feined Comedies or Tragedies, which are now most in use, but unto such reall tragicall Histories onely as are brought upon the Stage, which Play-poets and Players mangle, falsifie, if not obscure with many additionall circumstances and poeticall fictions; they doe not therefore explaine, but sophisticate, and deforme good Histories, with many false varnishes and Play-house fooleries. Secondly, these Histories are more fully, more truely expressed, more readily and acurately learned in the originall Authors who record them, then in derivative Play-house Pamphlets, which corrupt them; all circumstances both of the persons, time, occasion, place, cause, manner, end,  &c. being commonly truely registred in the story, which are either altered or omitted in the Play . Thirdly, if this Objection be true, Historians which we so much magnifie would be of little use or worth; we might then make waste paper of their voluminous workes, and turne all the applauded Histories both of former and future ages into Playes, which better expresse them then our stories, and more deepely imprint them in mens mindes. Lastly, admit the Objection true; yet the Histories Playes explaine would not doe the Actors or Spectators halfe the good, nor yet sticke by them halfe so long, as the corruptions that accompany them; that being a true rule of Aulus Gellius. Adolescentium indolem non tam juvant qu ae bene dicta sunt, quam inficiunt quae pessime . Since then the good they bring to men is no way equivalent to the hurt, as S. Augustine himselfe long since affirmed, the penning and acting of them cannot be lawfull. Id enim magis est eligendum, cui majus bonum, vel minus malum est consequens , as a very Heathen hath truely taught us. The 4. Objection for the penning and acting of Playes is this: That both our Universities, and long continued custome approve them: therefore they are good. To this I answer first; that the Objection it selfe is false, since both our Universities condemne all popular Enterludes, and the best, the gravest in our Universities, all academicall Stage-playes too: as I have already prooved: Act 6. Scene 5. pag. 489. 490, 491 . Secondly, though the dissoluter  & yonger sort in our Universities, (being but Youthes or Children, who are apt to dote on spectacles of vanity, and unable to judge of good or evil) approve perchance of Stage-plaies in their practise; yet the holiest, the gravest in our Universities condemne them in their judgements, if not their practise to. And here by the way, in case of examples, we must ever learne to judge of the lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse of things, not so much by the actions, as by the judgements and selfe-condemning consciences of men , by which they shall at last bee judged. There is never a Drunkard, Whore-master, Lyer, Hypocrite, Thiefe, that lives or wallowes in these sinnes approving them as lawfull by his continuall practise, but doth secretly passe sentence against them in his conscience; As therefore we must not argue, that drunkennes, whoredome, adultery, lying, hypocrisie and theft are lawfull, because they are commonly committed,  & sometimes applauded, since the very committers do condemne them, no more may we argue, that the acting or beholding of Stage- playes is lawful, because Schollers and University men do sometimes act and see them; since if they will but seriously examine their checking consciences, they shal finde them passing a secret doome of codemnation against them, what ever their practise be. Thirdly, Christians must notlive by examples, but by precepts : if therefore the rules of Religion and Christianity allow them not, no matter though the whole world approve them ; they will be evill  & unlawfull still, and so much the worse because so many justifie them. Lastly, admit the Objection true; yet Si auctoroitoas qu aeritur, orbis major est urbe : The authority of the whole Church of God from age to age, of 71. Fathers, 55. Councels, above 150\. moderne Christian Authors, of diuers Christian & Heathen Nations, Magistrates, Emperours, States, &c. of 40\. Heathen Writers, and of our owne Church and State , who condemne the penning, acting: and seeing of Stage-playes , is far greater then the custome or exemplary Authority (not the sad and serious resolution after full debate, which Stageplayes never had as yet) of both our Vniversities: This Objection therefore is too light to sway the ballance of this present controversie; Consuetudo enim si ex eo quod plures faciunt nomen accipiat, periculosum dabit exemplu, non orationi mod o, sed (quod majus est) vitae. Ergo consuetudinem vivendi vocabo consensum bonorum, sicut sermonis, consensum eruditorum . And thus much for the chiefe Objections, both for the compiling and acting of Stage-playes. I now come to answer the Objections, the pretences for seeing and frequenting Stage-playes. The first of them is this. Wee goe to Play-houses (say all our Play-haunters) with no evill intent at all: for recreation sake alone, and for no sinister purpose: therefore our resort to Playes cannot be evill, because our intentions, our purposes are not so. To this I might here reply as Saint Cyprian did to those lascivious Virgins who ran to wanton Bathes, as some doe to our Bathes, to see  & to be seene, or to bathe with naked men; and made this very objection. Videris, inquis, qua illuc mente quis veniat, mihi tantum resiciendi corpusculi cura est & lavandi : To which hee gives this answer: Non te purgat ista defensio, nec Lascivi ae & petulantiae crimen excusat. Sordidat lavatio ista, non abluit, nec emundat membra sed maculat. Impudice tu neminem conspicis, sed ipsa conspiceris impudice. Oculos tuos turpi oblectatione non polluis, sed dum oblectas alios pollueris. Spectaculum de lavacro facis, &c. Theatra sunt faediora quo convenis, verecundia illic omnis exuitur, &c . but I answer, first; that men cannot run to Playes and Play-houses with any good intent: For every intention is regulated by its object, and if that be ill, the intention it selfe cannot bee good. If a man intend to murther another for any good or publike end, the intent cannot be good because the thing intended, to wit the murther, is evill. Vzza no doubt had a good intent (far better then any Play-haunters have in flocking to Playes or Play-houses) when as hee put forth his hand to stay the Arke, which was shaken and like to fall: and yet God presently slew him for it , because God had forbidden any to touch it but the Priests. The Bethsheemites had questionlesse a good intention, when they tooke downe the Arke and pried into it upon its unexpected returne from the Philistins: and yet God slew fifty thousand three score and ten men for it; because he had prohibited all but the Priests and Levites to looke into it . Men must not doe evill that good may come of it: therefore they must not, they cannot goe to Stage-playes, (whose sinfulnesse and unlawfulnesse I have sufficiently discovered.) with any good intent; These Playes themselves being ill their good intentions cannot make either them, or your resort unto them, good  & lawfull. Secondly, I answer, that the intetions, the aymes of most who resort to Playes, are meerely ill. For to what end doe our Common Strumpets, Bawdes, Panders, Adulteresses, Adulterers, Whore-masters, &c. frequent either Playes or Play-houses, but for lewde and sinister purposes; to conclude of times, of places for their shamefull workes of darknesse, to draw others on to sinne, and to satiate their owne ungodly lusts? . And why doe most other Spectators flocke unto them; but either to gratifie such lewde companions who intice thither her or to spend and passe their time which might bee better imployed: to see and to be seene : to learne some apish fashions, or antique complements: to behold such or such in obscene or Satyricall Comedie acted: to laugh excessively in a profuse unchristian childish manner; to satisfie some secret carnall lust or other, which prickes them on to Stage- playes; or some strange fantastique humor of novalty, vanity, ridiculous mirth and jollity ; and the like? These I dare boldly say are the chiefe, if not the onely ends why men repaire to Stage-playes; and these all are sinfull: therefore their intention in resorting unto Stage-playes is not good. Thirdly, no man when he goes to see a Stage-play, propounds Gods glory (which ough to be the ut most end of all mens actions) for his end; nor yet the good, the peace, the comfort of his own and others soules: his intentions therefore cannot be warrantable. Fourthly, admit the Objection true; that your meanings and mindes are good when you run to Playes; yet Bonus animus in malare dimidium est mali ; as even Plautus the Comedian writes: your good intentions make your ill actions far the worse, because you commit them with greater greedinesse, and lesse remorse, as if they were truely good, at least not ill. Fiftly, admit that you goe to Stage-playes onely for recreation sake: yet it will not follow, that your resort to Playes is lawfull, because Playes themselves are no lawfull recreations. And if the consequent of this Objection bee now admitted: then men might by the selfesame reason run to Brothels, Whore-houses, Dice-houses, Tavernes, Alehouses, to whore, to drab, to drink themselves drunke, and cast away all their estates at one desperate throw, as too many doe, without offence, under pretence of recreation. The Scripture therefore is expresse, that we must not make a sport or mocke of sinne, it being the object onely of our godly sorrow, and deepest griefe, not of our carnall joy: that we may not recreate our selves with scurrility, ribaldry, lascivious, prophane or amorous Enterludes , but onely with good and lawfull things, which are no wayes scandalous, or of ill report: therefore we may not make Playes the object of our Recreation, which were ever infamous and unlawfull too . Sixtly, I answer, that mens pretence of going to Stage-playes meerely for their honest recreation, is but a false surmise, which will be most apparant, if we shall truely weight, what it is to doe a thing, onely for honest Recreation, and what necessary ingredients and circumstances all lawfull recreations must have, Every honest lawfull Recreation must have these conditions: First the object, the subject of it must be lawfull, Christian, and commendable, not sinfull, not infamous , or prohibited by the Magistrate. Secondly, it must be bounded with due circumstances of place and persons, both of them must be honest, & of good report: in which all Stage-playes (especially in Play-houses,) are defective. Thirdly, it must have all these circumstances of time: First, It must not bee on Lords-dayes, on times devoted to Gods more speciall service, on times either of publike or private fasting and solemne humiliations: nor yet in times designed for our honest studies, callings, or any necessary publike inployments: Secondly, it must not be in the night season when men by Gods appointment, and the ordinary course of nature ought to take their rest, to enable them the better to the duties of the ensuing day: and so much the rather because such night- recreations are occasions, if not provocations unto workes of darkenesse . Thirdly, it must be onely at such times when we stand in need of recreations to refresh our bodies or spirits: It must bee alwayes either after sicknesses, or naturall infirmities, or distempers of body or minde, to recover strength, health and vigor: or else after honest labours, studies, and imployments, in our lawfull callings, to repaire the decayes, to refresh the wearinesse of our bodies, or to whet the blunted edge of our over-wearied mindes: Fourthly, It must bee rare and seldome, not quotidian . Fiftly, the recreation must not be overlong, not time-consuming ; it must be onely as a baite to a traviler, a whetting to a Mower or Carpenter, or as an howres sleepe in the day time to a wearied man; we must not spend whole weekes, whole dayes, halfe dayes or nights on recreations , as now too many doe, abundance of idlenesse in this kinde, being one of Sodomes hainous sinnes: Fourthly, they must not be over-costly or expensive; but cheape and obvious, with as little expence as may bee . Fiftly, they must bee such as are suitable to mens callings, ages, places, sexes, conditions, tempers of body, &c. that being not lawfull or convenient in these regards to one, which yet are and may bee commendable in, or suitable to another . The recreations of Princes being not meet for Peasants; and so e converso ; nor all the pastimes of the Laitie agreeable to the Clergie. Sixtly, they must be all directed to a lawfull end even to the strengthning, quickning and refreshing both of our bodies and spirits, that so we may goe on with greater cheerefulnesse in the duties of our callings, and in the worship and service of God , whose glory must bee the utmost ayme of all our recreations . If our recreations faile in all or any of these circumstances, or if wee use prophane Playes or sports in Churches, in other sacred places devoted to Gods service, they presently cease to be lawfull or honest, and so prove sinfull pleasures. Now Stage-playes,  & those who resort unto them under the pretence of recreation, are defective or peccant in all or many of these particulars. Therefore they are not used, not frequented onely for honest recreation sake. Lastly, admit men goe to Stage-playes onely to recreate their mindes, and to refresh their spirits; I answer, that this is so farre frow justifying or extenuating, that it doth highly aggravate the execrable vitiousnesse of this their action, and proclaime them sinners in an high degree. For what men or women are there who can make a play, a sport, a recreation of sinne and sinfull things; of ribaldry, prophane and scurrill Iests, Adulteries, Rapes, Incests, Blasphemies, and such other notorious abominations, that are usually acted on the Stage, which vex every righteous soule from day today, and grieves it to the heart,) but such who are voyd of grace, of sin-abhorring, vice-lamenting repentance, and wholy enthralled to the love, the service of these sinfull lusts and pleasures, which will plunge them over head and eares into eternall torments at the last; this being one of the highest degrees of lewdnesse, for men to take joy and pleasure even in sinfull things. If any here reply in the second place, that they delight not in the scurrilous sinfull passages, speeches, gestures, representations or parts in Stage- playes, which they altogether abhor, but only in the action, & in those honest Spectacles and discourses, which no man can condemne. To this I answer first, That commonly the more obscene and scurrilous the Play, the more lascivious the Players action is, the more it exhilerates, and delights the Auditors, the Spectators ; no Playes, no Actors giving lesse content, then those that are most free from lascivious, amorous, prophane, effeminate jests, and gestures, as experience and the premises witnesse. This very suggestion therefore is untrue. Secondly, those who delight in the appearances of evill, in the lively representations of sinne, or sinfull things, can never cordially abhorre the evils, the sinnes themselves: for he that truly loathes a Man, a Toade, a Devill, a Serpent (and so by consequent, a sinne, will abhorre their very pictures, and resemblances. Hence is it that Christian who detests all sinne, hates the very thoughts and imaginations, and absteines from all the appearances of it too . Since therefore Play- haunters delight thus in the representations of whoredome, adultery, and such like execrable crimes, needs must they take pleasure in the sinnes themselves. For, if men did cordially detest these sinnes as they pretend, the nearer the representations came unto the sinnes (as they oft-times come too neere in Stage-playes, even to the actuall commission of the very abominations acted:) the more they would abhorre them, by reason of that neere similitude they beare unto the sinnes: but the more lively the resemblances of these Stage-lewdnesses are, the greater vicinity they have unto the sins themselves, the more they are applauded, admired & actor eo peritior quo turpior judicatur: therefore they doe not hate, but love these sins themselves, what ever they pretend. Thirdly, that which most Play- haunters. deeme nothing else but the representation of sinne in the acting of Playes, is even the sin it selfe in Gods repute: the acting of an effeminate whorish part upon the Stage in womans apparell, with amorous, womanish speches, gestures, kisses, coplements, dalliances  & imbracements, with wanton, unchaste, lascivious glances, nods, and sollicitations unto lewdnesse, yea the very expressions of the acts of Venery on the Stage, are nought else but effeminacy, scurrility, wantonnesse, whoredome and adultery it selfe in Gods esteeme: the personating of fooles part in jest, is fully and vanity in good earnest[illeg.] the speaking of vainewords, the swearing by the names of Pagan Idols, and the very uttering of their names, much more the acting of their parts: the very naming of fornication and adultery, together with foolish talking and jesting on the Stage, are nought else but actuall sinnes in Gods account, not onely in the Actors, but the Spectators too ; who give consent unto them: Those therefore who take pleasure in all or any of these, delight not in the representations onely of sinne, but even in sinne it selfe, which should be their greatest sorrow. Fiftly, these Play-house shadowes, and counterfeit resemblances of evill, are a ready meanes to enamour men with, to inscare them in the very sinnes themselves, as the Fathers and premises witnesse: If then Play-haunters detest these sinnes, why doe they not likewise hate the very representations of them , which are a beaten rode, a strong allurement to these sinnes themselves? Certainely, their little care to avoyd the one, bewrayes their love, their little detestation of the other. Sixtly, whereas some object, that they hate all scurrilous, filthy, amorous parts, discourses, passages, Pastorals, jests, and gestures in the Playes they goe to, approving none but chaste, but modest representations, passages, speeches: To this I answer, That as few Play-haunters, I dare say, can speake this seriously from his hearts: so it is but an idle false surmise. For first, every man who resorts to Playes, comes with a resolution to heare and see the whole Play acted, not one particular Scene or Act: he resolves, not this before hand with himselfe, I will onely see and heare this Act, this Scene, this Part; but I will debarre mine eares, mine eyes from all the rest, because I detest their lewdnesse: no man goes thus pre-resolved to a Play; he comes not therefore with an intention to abhor its lewdnesse, but to approve the whole. Secondly, few Play-haunters (that I say not any, I meane in point of conscience, though many doe it out of lasciviousnesse and lust) inquire before hand of the Play, whether it be scurrilous or obscene? whether there be any prophanesse, any lewde parts or passages in it? whether it bee such a one as they may behold with a safe conscience? whether there bee any lewde ungodly persons who resort unto it,  &c. but they run head-long to it without these premised Queries: Those therefore who make no such conscionable inquiries of the unlawfull parts and passages of Playes before they resort unto them, can hardly detest them when they come. Thirdly, he who truely abhors the lewde scurrill parts and sinfull passages of Playes, will chuse rather to avoyd the whole Play for the evill parts and particles which defile the whole; (as every man is apt to flie those Cities that are but in part infected with the plague, and to eschue those sweet conserves and wholsome potions that are contempered with a little poyson,) then to behold the evill parts though with detestation, that he may injoy the pleasure of the good; there being more danger of sinne, of corruption by the one, then hope of any reall benefit or contentment from the other. Lastly, every Play-haunters presence at the whole entire Play; and his contribution to the Actors for playing of the whole, is a notorious approbation of, an unavoydable assent unto the whole, in Gods, if not in mens esteeme , who will thence conclude that they consented to and tooke pleasure in the whole. Let no Play-haunters therefore any longer cheat theselves or others with these dilusory false pretences, which have neither truth nor substance in them: but quite abandon Playes and Play-houses, notwithstanding these evasions which wil not help them in the day of Iudgement. And thus much for the first Objection. The 2. Objection or pretence for seeing Stage-playes is this: That it serves to passe away mens idle time, which would else perchance be worse imployed. To this I answer first; That therefore it is evill because it thus consumes mens pretious time which should bee better imployed, either in publike or private duties of piety and devotion, or else in some honest studies, callings, or imployments for the publike good . Secondly, there is no man who hath so much vacant time, that he needs to run to Playes, to Play-houses, to waste, to poast away his idle houres. Alas, we all complaine with Seneca and others, Ars longa, vita brevis ; that our studies, our professions are long, our lives exceeding short and swift; and shall wee then adde wings, adde spurs of life-consuming pleasures of sin to our few winged dayes, to make them flie away with greatest haste and worser speed, as if we had too much life? Our time is too too swift already; it runnes whiles wee sit still; it is alwayes flying more swift then any poast, whiles we are eating, drinking, sleeping, playing, and thinke not of its haste: yea so swift winged is it ubi per luxum ac negligentiam defluit, ubi null ae rei bonae impenditur, ut quod ire non intelleximus praeterijsse sentimus ; that whiles we waste it thus on Playes and sports, it is past and gone before we discerne it move. And shall we then bee so desperately prodigall of our lives, our rich and peerelesse houres, as to plot, to study how to passe them quite away with more celerity, and farre lesser fruit? Certainely if we would but seriously consider and peruse that elegant Treatise of an Heathen, Of the shortnesse of life , or this memorable speech of his Quotidie morimur, quotidie enim demitur aliqua pars vit ae, & tunc quoque cum nescimus vita decrescit. Infantiam amisimus, deinde pueritiam, deinde adolescentiam, usq ad hesternum quicquid transijt temporis perit. Hunc ipsum quem agimus diem, etiam cum morte dividimus, &c . If we would with all remember the end for which God made us; to wit, to doe his service; to finish the worke which he hath given us to doe; and to passe the time of our pilgrimage here in his feare: Or the cause for which our blessed Saviour redeemed us, That we might serve him in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our lives: that we should no longer live to our selves but unto him alone, and that living and dying we might be his . If we would further seriously ponder how many holy duties we have every day to performe towards God; how many graces, and degrees of grace we want; how many daily sinnes and lusts we have to lament and mortifie; how many offices of piety, of charity, of courtesie, duty and civility wee have to exercise towards our selves, our friends, our neighbours, our families, our enemies, as we are men, or Christians, in all those severall relations wherein wee stand to others: considering withall what time we ought to spend upon our lawfull callings, upon the care and culture of our soules which are then most neglected, when as our bodies are most pampered, most adorned ; all which are sufficient to monopolize even all our idle dayes  & more. And if we would adde to this; these strict commands of God: Exod. 20.9. Sixe dayes shalt thou labour and doe all thy worke ; Gen. 3. 19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread till thou returne unto the ground: (a curse, a precept layd on all mankinde.) Ephes . 5. 15, 16. See that yee walke circumspectly, not as fooles but as wise, redeeming the time, because the dayes are evill: 2\. Thes. 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. For even when we were with you this we commanded you, that if any would not worke, neither should he eate. For we heare there are some (and O that we did not now heare of many such among us) which walke among you disorderly, not working at all, but are busie-bodies. Now them that are such wee command and exhort by our Lord Iesus, that with quietnesse they worke and eate their owne bread, not being weary in well doing. And if any obey not our Word by this Epistle note that man, and have no communion with him, that he may be ashamed , Did we, I say, consider all this, or did we remember, how narrow, steepe, and difficult the way is unto Heaven, and what paines all those must take who meane to climbe up thither ; We should then speedily discover, how little cause men have to run to Stage-playes to passe away their idle houres, which flie away so speedily of themselves. But suppose there are any such (as alas our idle age hath too too many,) who though they are loath to die, (as all men should be willing to depart who have finished or survived their worke , or else want good imployments,) yet they have so much idle time, that they know not how to spend, standing all the day idle, like those lazy Loyterers , Matth. 20. 1. to 8. even for want of worke; or loytring abroad like our common Vagrant Sturdy-beggers , not so much because they cannot, but because they will not worke; let all such idle-Bees know, that Christ Iesus their Lord and Master hath a Vineyard in which they may and ought to spend their time ; he hath store of imployments for them though themselves have none, even enough to take up all the vacant houres of their lives. When therefore any Play-haunters or others have so much idle time that they know not how to bestow it, let them presently step into the Lords Vineyard; let them repaire to Sermons, and such other publike exercises of Religion ; calling upon one another and saying, Come and let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, to the house of the God of Iacob, and hee will teach us his wayes, and we will walke in his pathes: or else betake themselves to their owne private prayers and devotions: Let them read the Scriptures , or some other pious Bookes, which may instruct them in the wayes of godlinesse: or sing Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spirituall Songs to God: let them seriously examine their owne consciences, hearts and lives, by the sacred Touch-stone of Gods Word ; let them bewayle their owne originall corruption, with all their actuall transgressions, and sue earnestly to God for pardon for them ; let them labour after all the graces and degrees of grace which yet they want, and bee ever adding to those graces which they have: let them renew their vowes and covenants with God, and walke more closely, more exactly with him every day: let them muse and meditate on God, on all his great and glorious workes and attributes ; on Christ and all his suffrings; on the holy Ghost and all his graces; on the Word of God and all its precepts, promises, threatnings; on Heaven and ever-lasting happinesse: on Hell and all its torments ; on sinne and all the miseries that attend it: on their owne frailty and mortality ; on the vanity of all earthly things ; on the day of death and iudgement, which should be alwayes in their thoughts ; and on a thousand such like particulars, on which they should imploy their mindes and vacant houres. If men will but thus improve their idle time which now they waste on Playes and such like vanities (which onely treasure up wrath unto their soules against the day of wrath , and plunge them deeper into Hell at last,) what benefit, what comfort might they reape? their idle vacant seasons would then prove the comfortablest, the profitablest of all others, and bring them in a large returne of grace here, of glory hereafter. Let us therefore henceforth labour to improve our cast, our leisure times to our eternall advantage; & ab hoc exiguo  & caduco temporis transitu, in illa nos toto demus animo, quae immensa quae aeterna sunt, quae cum melioribus communia: Haec nobis dabu[illeg.]d aeternitatem iter, & nos in illum locum ex quo nemo eijciet, sublenabunt: haec una ratio est extendendae mortalitatis, imo, in immortalitatem vertendae: and then we need not run to Masques, to Playes, or Play-houses to passe away our time. Lastly, I answer, That men cannot be worse imployed then in hearing or beholding Stage-playes, Nihil enim tam damnosum bonis moribus, qu am in aliquo Spectaculo desidere: tunc enim per voluptatem facilius vitia surrepunt . It was Seneca his resolution to his friend Lucilius , when he requested his advice, what thing hee would have him principally to avoyd ; and it may be a satisfactory answer to this Objection. For how can men be worse imployed, then in hearing, seeing, learning all kinde of vice, of villany, and lewdnesse whatsoever? then in depraving both their mindes and manners, and treasuring up damnation to their soules? This is the onely good imployment, that our Play- haunters have at Playes , which is the worst of any. This Objection therefore is but idle. The 3. Objection which Play-frequenters make for the seeing of Playes, is this. That the frequenting of Stage-playes (as their owne experience witnesseth,) doth men no hurt at all: it neither indisposeth them to holy duties, nor inticeth them to lust or lewdnesse: therefore it is not ill. An Objection made in Chrysostomes time, as well as now. To this I answer first; that Play-haunters are no meete judges in this case, because most of them being yet in the state of sinne and death , are altogether sencelesse of the growth and progresse of their corruptions, of which they take no notice. Excellent to this purpose is that speech of Seneca. Quare vitia sua nemo confitetur? Quia etiam nunc in illis est. Somnium narrare, vigilantis est; & vitia sua confiteri, sanitatis indicium est. Expergiscamur ergo, ut errores nostros coarguere possimus . Stage-haunters are for the most part lulled asleepe in the Dalilaes lappe of these sinfull pleasures. yea they are quite dead in sinnes and trespasses; their eyes are so blinded that they will not see, their hearts so hardned that they cannot discerne , their consciences so cauterized that they never seriously behold nor yet examine the execrable filthinesse, greatnesse, multitude, growth, or daily increase of their beloved sinnes and lusts; no marvaile therefore if they affirme this falsehood; that they receive no hurt at all from Stage-playes. Secondly, every man (especially those who were never thorowly humbled for their sinnes, as few Play-frequenters are,) is a corrupt, a partiall, and so an unfitting judge, in his owne cause . As therefore men in ordinary differences, referre the censure and determination of their owne causes to indifferent Arbitrators who are no wayes ingaged in their suits, declining their owne particular discitions to avoyd all partiality; it being against reason (as Mr. Littleton and our Law-bookes teach us,) that any man should be the Iudge of his owne cause . Or as Aristotle writes of Physicians, that they use the helpe of other Physicians in their owne sicknesse, because they cannot discerne the true touch of their owne diseases by reason of their distemper : the same should our Play- haunters doe in this particular; referre the examination of the hurt they receive from Playes and Play-houses unto others, who are impartiall judges; but not unto themselves, whom selfe-love makes too partiall. Thirdly, I answer with S. Hierom ; Tunc maxime oppugnaris, si te oppugnari nescis. Adversarius nester, tanquam leo rugiens, aliquem devorare quarens circumit; & tu pacem putas? Sedet in insidijs; insidiatur in occulto; & tu frondosae arboris tectus umbraculo, molles somnos futurus praeda, carpis? Inde me persequitur luxuria, inde compellit libido, ut habitantem in me Spiritum sanctum fugem, ut templum ejus violem: persequitur, inquam, me hostis, cui nomina mille, mille nocendi artes; & ego infaelix victorem me putabo, dum capior? In illo aestu Charybdis luxuriae salutem vorat. Ibi ore virgineo ad pudicitiae perpetranda naufragia, Scylla seu renidens, libido blanditur. Hic barbarum litus, hic Diabolus pyrata cum socijs portat vincula capiendis. Nolite credere, nolite esse securi. Licet in modum stagnifusum aequor arrideat; licet vix summa jacentis elementi spiritu terga crispentur: magnos hic campus montes habet; intus inclusum est periculum, intus est hostis, expedite rudentes, vela suspendite; tranquillitas ista tempestas est . Stage-players and Play-haunters are commonly most dangerously corrupted by the Playes they act and see, when as they are least sensible of their hurt; yea their oft resort to Playes and Play-houses which perchance did somewhat gall their consciences at the first, hath made them sencelesse of their mischiefe at the last. Vulnere vetusto & neglecto callus obducitur, & eo insanabile quo insensible fit. Solum est cordurum quod semet ipsum non exhorret quia nec sentit . I shall therefore shut up this reply with that of Bernard , which I would wish all unlamenting Play-haunters  & sinners to consider. Scio, longius a salute absistere membrum quod obstupuit, & aegrum sese non sentientem, periculosius laborare . Fourthly, the hurt men receive from Stage-playes, is like the growth of their bodies, it increaseth by certaine insensible degrees, so that it is hardly discerned whiles it is growing, till time hath brought it to maturity. Nemo repente fit turpissimus: is as true as ancient. No man becomes extreamely vitious on a sudden , but by unsensible gradations, and so doe Play-haunters too, even by those seeds of vice which Stage-playes sow and nourish in them. What Seneca writes of the discourses of lewde companions; Horum sermo multum nocet; Nam etiam si non statim officit, semina in animo relinquit; sequiturque nos etiam cum ab illis discesserimus resurrecturum poste a malum . The same may I truely write of Playes; whose evill fruits, like tares that are buried under ground, are oft concealed for a time, till at last they bud forth by degrees, and come to perfect ripenesse; and then they are abvious unto all mens view. No wonder therefore if Play-haunters discover not the hurt they receive from Playes, because it creepes thus on them by imperceptible gradations, though faster upon some then others. But albeit Play-haunters feele no hurt at first, (no more then those who drinke downe poyson in a sugered cup, which yet proves fatall to rhem at the last, though it were sweet and luscious for the present,) yet when terrors of conscience, death, and judgements, when crosses and afflictions shall thorowly awaken them; when God shall set all their sinnes in order before them, or bring them by his grace and mercy to sincere repentance, then they shall finde and know it to their griefe (as sundry penitent Players and Play-haunters have done before them,) that Stage-playes have done them hurt indeed. Fiftly, Stage-playes have exceedingly depraved, corrupted many Spectators from time to time, and drawne them on to divers sinnes, which have even sunke their soules to Hell ; as the premises largely testifie: And can any then think to escape all danger, even where they have seene so many perish? Can any man rest secure where multitudes have miscarried? What S. Cyprian therefore writes in a like case, that shall I here commend to Stage-haunters. Ad vos nunc mea exhortatio convertitur, quos nolumus experiri talia pr aecipita ruinarum. Metuite quantum potestis ejusmodi casus exitia. Et in ista subversione labentium vos experimenta perterreant. Nimium praeceps est quitransire contendit, ubi alium conspexerit cecidisse, & vehementer infrenis est cui non incutitur timor alio pereunte. Amator vero est salutis suae qui evitat alienae mortis incursum, & ipse est providus qui solicitus fit cladibus caeterorum. Adversa est confidentia quae periculis vitam suam pro certo commendat; & lubrica spes est quae inter fomenta peccati salvari se sperat. Incerta victoria est, inter hostilia arma pugnare; & impossibilis liberatio est flammis circundari, nec ardere; quod Solomon non negat, dicens. Quis alligabit in sinu suo ignem, vestimenta autem sua non comburet? Credite qu aeso vos, credite divinae fidei quinimo plus quam nostrae. Difficile quis venenum bibet & vivet: verendum est dormienti in ripa, ne cadat, cum dicat Apostolus , Qui se putat stare videat ne cadat. In hac parte expedit plus bene timere, qu am male fidere. Et utilius est infirmum se homo cognoscat, ut fortis existat; quam fortis videri velit, ut infirmus emergat . Sixtly, all Play-haunters receive much hurt from Stage-playes what ever they pretend: For first, these Playes enflame their lusts, ingender unchast affections in their soules; mispend their mony and time, indispose them to Gods service  & sincere repentance, by inthralling them in the guilt of sundry other mischiefes, as I have elsewhere largely prooved . Secondly, it makes them guilty of all the sinnes that are either acted or committed at the Play-house; of all the Play-poets, all the Actors wickednesse which they maintaine and cherish both with their purses and presence. A fearefull mischiefe. Nam qui alios peccare fecerit, multos secum pr aecipitat in mortem, & necesse est ut sit pro tantis reus, quantos secum traxerit in ruinam ; as Salvian well observes. Thirdly, your very contribution unto Players for their Playes and action if Saint Augustine and others may be credited, is a very great and hainous sinne; of which every Play-haunter is guilty . And is it not the greatest hurt that can be, to be guilty of an hainous sinne, which subjects men to Gods curse and vengeance here, and to eternall torments hereafter? Fourthly, your very example in frequenting Playes and Play-houses, as it is seandalous and offensive to Gods Church, Gods Saints, and unbeseeming the Gospell of Christ , so it is a meanes to harden vitious Play-haunters, to encourage and draw on many Spectators unto Stage- playes, who are polluted, vitiated, and made worse by them: whose sins shall certainely be put on your, as well as on their scores at last, whose lewde example was the originall occasion both of their sinne and hurt. I shall therefore cloze up this reply with that of Chrysostome , to those who made this very objection. Sed ego, inquies, ostendam, nihil multis hujusmodi Iudos obfuisse: imm[illeg.] a vero id maxime noet, quod flustra & incassum tempus consumismp; scandalum alijs offers. Nam etsi tu quodam excelsi animi robore, nihilinde tibi mali contraxisti: at tamen quoniam alios imbecilliores exemplo tui spectaculorum studiosor focisti, quomodo non ipse malum tibi contraxisti, qui causam mali committendi alijs praebuisti? Qui enim illi corrumpuntur tam viri quam muliores, omnes corruptionis crimina & causam in caput tuum transferunt. Nam quemadmodum si non essent qui spectarent, nec essent etiam qui ludorent: sic quoniam uterque sunt causa peccatorum que committantur, igneus etiam patientur. Quare quamois animi tui modestia efficisti, ut nihil tibi inde obfuerit, quod ego fieri posse non arbitror: quoniam tamen alij causa ludorum multa peccarunt, graves propter hoc panas lues, quamvis etiam multo modestior & temperantior esses, si nullo modo eo pergeres . Which passage (formerly Englished) I would wish all Play-haunters seriously to consider. Lastly, admit that many Spectators receive no hurt from Stage- playes; yet certainely they are very dangerous temptations unto evill; and it is Gods preventing grace alone, of which no Play-haunter can presume, that preserves men from their grosse corruptions. Why then shall wee runne our selves into such temptations, such infectious, insinuating, if not ensnaring pleasures of sinne, which wee may avoyd with safety, but not resort to without feare of danger? Quid tibi necesse est in ea versari domo in qu a necesse habeas aut perire, aut vincere? Quis unquam mortalium juxta viperam securos somnos cepit? quae et si non percutiat, certe sollicitat. Securius est perire non posse, quam juxta periculum nonperisse . O therefore let us flie these pestiferous Enterludes which will endanger hurting us, if that they harme us not. If any here reply, as some did to Tertullian in this very case: Thus the Sunne shines on a dung-hill, and yet its beames are not defiled by it: so men may looke on Stage-playes and yet not be polluted ; for unto the pure all things are pure: And admit there be some obscenity in Stage-playes, yet chaste hearts and eares will not be tainted with it. Auribus enim castis obsceni sermones cum sono deficiunt, nec secretum pudici cordis irrumpunt: nec erumpit sermo turpis ex mento nisi se voluntarie mens ant e corrumpat, quam recipiat aliquid unde corrumpatur, aut proferat. Turpia quoque verba per aures ingressa, quid praevalent, si non fuerint arbitrio mentis admissa? Quando autem praevalent, non ipsam corrumpunt mentem, sed jam corruptam sponte reperiunt. Pulchrorum quoque corporum formae per oculos irrepentes, animum non movent incorruptum; & quando corruptibiliter movent, non corrumpunt sanum, sed ostendunt propria voluntate corruptum ; as Prosper Aquitanicus writes. To this I answer first, that the Sunne is of a pure and celestiall nature, uncapable of any defilement whatsoever; its shining therefore on a dunghill can no wayes maculate its pure rayes, which oft-times make the dung-heape stinke the more. But mans nature as it was capable of pollution at the first, before Adams fall, so it is altogether filthy, stinking, and corrupted since , more apt to be inflamed with any lascivious amorous speeches, gestures, Playes and Enterludes, then Tinder, Gun-powder, Flax, or Charcole are with the least sparkes of fire. Every Sonne of lapsed Adam is borne into the world a sinfull, uncleane, depraved creature, overspred with a universall leprosie of corruption : all the imaginations of his heart are evill, yea onely evill, and that continually: yea all his righteousnesse is but as menstruous rags, and in him there dwells nothing that is good: his very eyes being full of adultery, so that they cannot cease from sinne; and his heart most desperately wicked and deceitfull above all things , as both Scripture and experience teach us: No wonder then if Stage-playes (which if we believe S. Chrysostome, are farre more contagious & filthy then any dung,) defile mens vitious natures , though no stinking dung heape can pollute the shining Sunne. We see that the very sight of the forbidden fruit was sufficient to tempt Adam and Eve to sinne even before their Natures were depraved: and we know that the casuall sight of Bathsheba was sufficient to provoke even regenerate David to an adulterous act: And will not then the premeditated voluntary delightfull beholding of an unchast adulterous Play, much more contaminate a voluptuous, carnall, gracelesse Play-haunter, who lies rotting in the sinke of his most beastly lusts? A very Heathen could informe us thus much: Ad deteriora non tantum pronum iter est, sed etiam pr aeceps ; that mans nature is not onely prone, but precipitate unto evill things: and shall Christians then thinke themselves, as uncapable of contagion as the shining Sunne? God forbid: we may perchance bee such in Heaven hereafter, as neither v elle, nec posse peccare ; but here we cannot be such; For what man among us can say, that he hath made his heart cleane, and that he is pure from his sinne? Certainely if any dare say so, (as some Papists write of their super- errogating super-arrogant Saints,) St. Iohn , will tell him that he is a lyer, and there is no truth in him And although unto the pure all things (that is all good, all lawfull, all indifferent things, all meates and drinkes, for of them the Apostle speakes) are pure, yet unto the impure (and such for the most part are all Play-haunters) all things (that is all good, all indifferent things, all meates, all drinkes and recreations) are uncleane ; and so by consequence Stage-playes too; because their very conscience is defiled . Secondly, whereas it is objected, that evill things corrupt not chaste or honest eyes, or eares, or hearts. I answer, that it is true indeed in these three particular cases: Firstly, when as the evils which men see or heare are meerely casuall, not run unto of set purpose upon deliberation. Secondly, when men are necessitated to heare and see them, even against their wills: and yet in these two cases they prove oft-times contagious . Thirdly, when as men see or heare them with highest detestation of their lewdnesse , and strong resolves against them: not with delight or approbation. But thus men see and heare not Stage-playes, to which they purposely and willingly resort, in which they place their pleasure: and delight. Therefore they cannot but corrupt, yea dangerously defile them, because they doe not loath but love them over-much. And what so apt to contaminate and deprave men, as that which they best affect? The last Objection for the seeing of Playes is this: If you debarre us from beholding Stage-playes (say some) you will then deprive us of all our mirth, our pleasures, and cause us for to live a melancholy, sad, dumpish life, the which we cannot brooke: therefore you must still permit us to resort to Playes. To this I answer first: that it is the condition of all voluptuous carnall persons, to deeme themselves much restrained, when as they are inhibited from any one sinfull pleasure in which they take delight; as if all their comforts, their contentments, yea their life it selfe, were utterly lost and gone . Let a Drunkard be but restrained from his Cups and Pot-companions; an Whore-master from his Queanes and Whoredomes, a common Dicer from his unlawfull gaming, or a Play-haunter from his Stage-playes, which delight and feed his lusts; they presantly thinke themselves undone, yea quite bereaved of all their pleasures: and all because they place their happinesse, their chiefe delights in these their carnall contentments, which alwayes end in horror. But alas what hard injurious restraint is this, to inhibit them from sinne and sinfull things , which would certainely plung them into eternall misery, from which the very Lawes of God, of nature, of Nations have long since debard them, under the severest penalties? What, are Christians growne now such carnall Epicures, as to thinke there is no pleasure, mirth or solace but in sinne alone, in amorous Pastorals, obscene lascivious speeches, jests, and Enterludes, or such lewde notorious abominations as should even pierce all Christian hearts with griefe? what, is there no pleasure thinke we but in that which God prohibits? in that which he and all good men abhorre ? in that which shuts men out of Heaven, and poasts them on to Hell? Good God, if these be the chiefe delights of Christians now, which was the vice, the shame of Pagans, of Christians heretofore, why doe any such voluptuous carnall Christians hope for Heaven? Are there any lascivious Stage-playes, Spectacles, Songs, or such like sinfull vanities there? are there any such lust-fomenting, sin-engendring sports or pastimes in Heaven, as carnalists delight in here on earth? O no, there is no uncleanesse, vanity or lasciviousnesse in that holy place: If men therefore thinke themselves miserable when they are deprived of these pleasures here, what happinesse can they hope to finde in Heaven hereafter, where there are no such Enterludes, such carnall contentments as they delight in now? If then wee may bee happy, yea eternally happy in the highest degree without these lust- enraging Enterludes hereafter, why should wee deeme our selves unfortunate in being restrained from them now? especially since Christ himselfe informes us, that if any man will come after him, he must deny himselfe in all his sinfull pleasures, and crucifie his flesh with the affections and lusts thereof . The Saints and Angels now in Heaven; the Primitive Church and Christians, yea and many Pagans, whiles they were on earth, accounted their lives most comfortable, though they wanted Stage-playes, yea, this was one of their greatest contentments, that they had quite abandoned them: Nay those very Saints of God on earth, who now lead the most comfortable, joyfull, happy lives of all men in the world, are such who never come at Stage-playes: and many carnall men there are who live full merry, full jolly lives without them. This Objection therefore is but frivolous. Secondly, though men are deprived of Stage-playes, of all other unlawfull pleasures whatsoever; yet they have choyce enough of sundry lawfull recreations, and earthly solaces with which to exhilerate their mindes; and sences: They have the severall prospects of the Sunne, the Moone, the Planets, the Stars, the water; the earth, with all the infinite variety of Creatures, of Fishes, Birds, Fowles, Beasts, creeping things, Trees, Herbes, Plants, Rootes, Stones, and Mettals that are in them, to delight their eyes: They have the Musicke of all Birds and singing creatures to please their eares; the incomperably delicate odoriferous sents and perfumes of all Hearbes, all Flowers, Fruits, &c. to refresh their noses: the savory tastes of all edible creatures to content their pallats , so farre as the rules of sobriety and temperance will permit: the pleasures that Orchards, Rivers, Gardens , Ponds, Woods, or any such earthly Paradices can affoord them: the comfort of Friends, Kindred, Wives, Children, Possessions, wealth, and all other externall blessings that God hath bestowed upon them. And what want of pleasures, of contentments can they complaine of, who have all these for to delight them, the very meanest whereof are farre more pleasant, then the very best of Enterludes, then all our Stage-playes put together? Besides, though men are debard from Stage-playes, Dicing, or mix lascivious Dancing, or any other unlawfull sports, they have store of honest, of healthfull recreations still remaining, with which to refresh themselves; as walking, riding, fishing, fowling, hawking, hunting, ringing, leaping, vauting, wrestling, running, shooting, singing of Psalmes and pious Ditties; playing upon musicall Instruments , casting of the Barre, tossing the Pike, riding of the great Horse, (an exercise fit for men of quality) running at the ring, with a world of such like lawdable, cheape, and harmlesse exercises; which being used in due season, with moderation, temperance, and all lawfull circumstances, will prove more wholsome to their bodies, more profitable  & delightfull to their soules, then all the Enterludes, the unlawfull Pastimes in the world. Men need not therefore complaine for want of recreations in case they are deprived of Playes, when they have such plenty of farre better sports. Thirdly, admit the objection true, that you shall be stript of all your earthly pleasures in case you are kept from Playes, yet what prejudice should your soules or bodies suffer by it? Carnall worldly pleasures, you know, are no part; no particle of a Christians comfort, hee can live a most happy joyfull life without them; yea he can hardly live happily or safely with them. Worldly pleasures are full of dangerous soule-entangling snares, which are apt to endanger the very best of Christians. Hence was it, that holy Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season . Hence our Saviour pronounceth an woe unto them that laugh now, for they shall weepe and lament hereafter ; Hence S. Iames adviseth men, to turne their laughter into mournig, and their joy into heavinesse: And Solomon hereupon instructs men; that it is better to goe to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. That sorrow is better then laughter, for by the sadnesse of the countenance the heart is made better: And that the heart of the wife is in the house of mourning, but the heart onely of fooles in the house of mirth: there being nothing more dangerous to mens soules, more opposite to their vertues, then carnall pleasures . This Heathen men long since acknowledged. Volupt as esca malorum qu a nulla capitalior pestis hominibus a natura datur, Nihil altum, nihil magnificum & divinum suscipere possunt, qui suas omnes cogitationes abjecerunt in rem tam humilem atq contemptam: writes Cicero. Resp[illeg.]end ae sunt voluptates, enervant & effaeminant Voluptati indulgere initium omnium malorum est. Indarandus itaque est animus & blandimentis voluptatum procul abstrahendus. Vna Hannibalem hyberna soluerunt, & indomitum illum nivibus atque Alpibus virum enervaverunt fomenta Campaniae. Armis vicit, vitijs victus est, &c. Dobellandae itaque sunt imprimis voluptates ; is the advice of Seneca . And good reason is there for it. Quippe nec ira De um tantum, nec tela, nec hostes , Quantum sola noces animis illapsa voluptas , as Silius Italicus affirmed long agoe: answerable to which is that of Scipio , appliable to our present times. Non est tantum ab hostibus armatis aetati nostrae pericult, quantum a circumfusis undique voluptatibus: qui eas sua temperantia frenavit ac domuit, multo majus decus majoremque victoriam sibi peperit quam nos Syphace victo habemus. And is it then any such tedious irkesome matter for Christians out of their love to Christ, (for whom they should part with all things) to part with these their worldly pleasures, so dangerous to their soules, when as Pagans have thus censured, abandoned them long agoe? Let us therefore contemne the losse of these our worthlesse, vaine and sinfull Enterludes, whose danger farre exceeds their pleasure , and since we shall not enjoy them hereafter in Heaven, let us not desire them whiles we are on earth. Fourthly, this world, this life is no time, no place for pleasure, mirth or carnall jollity; it being onely a vale of misery, a place of sorrow, griefe and labour to all the Saints of God. Cum enim legatur Adam in loco voluptatis ab initio positus ut operaretur, quis sanum sapiens, filios ejus in loco afflictionis ad feriandum positos arbitretur? Every man is borne into this world weeping, to signifie that it is a place of teares, not of laughter; a prison, not a Paradice ; and shall we then thinke to make it onely a Theater of jollity and delights? Fiftly, let no men so far deceive themselves, as to expect an earthly Paradice and an heavenly too; as to enjoy the pleasures of earth and Heaven both. Delicatus es frater si & hic vis gaudere cum saeculo, & postea regnare cum Christe , writes Saint Hierom . Alas, those who receive their pleasure in this life, must not looke for any comfort, but torments onely in the life to come, and so much pleasure as they have enjoyed here, so much torment shall they susteine hereafter None reape in joy hereafter, but those who sow in teares of godly sorrow now. Our light afflictions (not our carnall pleasures) which are but for a moment, are the onely instruments that purchase for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory. Through many afflictions (not through the pleasant way of worldly pleasures and Spectacles which are quite out of the rode to Heaven) we must all enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, where all teares shall be wiped from our eyes, which here must ever flow with teares of sorrow for our owne and others sinnes . Memorable is that speech of Abraham to the rich man. Luke 16\. 25. Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy pleasure, (as some Translations render it) and Lazarus paine; but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented . Lo here, a voluptuous life, ending in torments; and a sorrowfull life terminating in eternall blisse. It is recorded of the wicked, Iob 21\. 12, 13. That they take the Timbrel and Harpe, and rejoyce at the sound of the Organ: they spend their dayes in wealth and in a moment goe downe to Hell . And Solomon, Eccles. 11\. 8, 9. speakes thus unto all voluptuous persons who delight in worldly jollity: If a man live many yeeres, and rejoyce in them all, yet let him remember the dayes of darkenesse for they are many. All that commeth is vanity: Rejoyce, O Young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee to Iudgement. Which two remarkable places coupled with Revel. 18\. 7. How much she hath glorified herselfe and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: are sufficient evidences that all worldly pleasures without Gods mercie and repentance bring men onely to Hell, to torments at the last . It will be therefore your happines, your eternall advatage, not your prejudice, to foregoe all your sinfull pleasures now, that so ye may gaine far greater, far better in Heaven hereafter . Sixtly, those Enterludes and carnall pastimes wherein the world takes so much solace, can bring no true joy to a Christians heart, who tramples upon them as not worthy the enjoying. It is an excellent saying of Bernard: Gustato spiritu, necesse est desipere carnem: affectanti c aelestia, terrena non sapiunt: aeternis inhanti, fastidio sunt transitoria. Revera illud verum & solum est gaudium, quod non de creatura sed de creatore concipitur, & quod cum possideris nemo tollet a te. Cui comparata omnis aliunde jocunditas, maeror est; omnis suavitas, dolor est; omne dulce, amarum; omne decorum, faedum; omne postremo quodcunque aliud delectari possit, molestum . Every pious Christian hath the God of all comfort and consolation, (without whom nothing is pleasant,) with all his great and glorious attributes: the mercies of God the Father; the merits and soule-saving passion of God the Sonne; the consolations, joyes and graces of God the holy Ghost; the wisedome, power, goodnesse, eternity, omnipotency, mercy, truth and alsufficiency of the sacred Trinity, which are onely able for to fill the soule: the word, the promises of the God of truth; the eternall joyes of Heaven; the fellowship of the blessed Saints and Angels, to ravish, solace, and rejoyce his soule upon all occasions: on these he may cast the eyes, yea fix the very intentions and desires of his heart: in these his affections may even satiate themselves, and take their full contentment, without any subsequent repentance, sinne, or sorrow of heart: Those then who cannot satisfie their soules with these celestiall Spectacles, and soule-ravishing delights, in which all Christians place their complacency and supreme felicity, it is a sure character, that they have yet no share in Christ, no acquaintance with the least degrees of grace, no interest in Gods favour, no true desire of grace, of Heaven, and everlasting life, which would soone embitter and debase al worldly pleasures, which are but cyphers in respect of these. Lastly, if any Play-haunter bee yet so devoted to his Play-house Spectacles that he will not part with them upon any tearmes: let him then behold farre better, farre sublimer Spectacles then these with which to delight himselfe; which I shal commend unto him in S. Augustines words: Quid ergo facimus fratres? writes he in our very case. Dimissuri eum sumus? sine spectaculo morietur, non subsistet, non nos sequetur. Quid ergo faciemus? Demus pro spectaculis spectacula. Et qu ae spectacula daturi sumus Christiano homini, quem volumus ab illis spectaculis revocare? Gratias ago Domino Deo nostro, sequente versu ostendit nobis quae spectatoribus spectar[illeg.] volentibus spectacula praeberemus, & ostendere debeamus. Ecce aversus fuerit a Circo, a Theatro, ab Amphitheatro, quaerat quod spectet, prorsus quaerat; non cum relinquimus sine spectaculo. Quid pro illis dabimus? Audi quid sequitur. Multa fecisti tu Domiue Deus meus mirabilia tua. Miracula hominum intuebatur, intendat mirabilia Dei. Multa fecit Dominus mirabilia sua, hac respiciat. Quaere illi viluerunt? Aurigam laudas regentem quatuor equos, & sine lapsu atque offensione currentes. Forte talia miracula spiritalia non fecit Dominus. Regat luxuriam, regat injustitiam, regat imprudentiam: motus istos qui nimium lapsi haec vitia faciunt, regat & subdat sibi & teneat habenas & non rapiatur: ducat quo vult, non trahatur quo non vult: aurigam laudabat, aurigam laudabit. Clamabat, ut auriga veste cooperiretur, immortalitate vestietur. Haec munera, haec spectacula dedit Deus; clamat de caelo, Specto vos: luctamini, adjavabo vincite, coronabo, &c. Nunc Specta histrionem. Didicit enim homo magno studio in fune ambulare, & pendens te suspendit. Illum attende aeditorem majorum Spectaculorum. Didicit iste in fune ambulare, nunquid fecit in mare ambulare? Obliviscere Theatrum tuum, attende Petrum nostrum, non in fune ambulantem, sed ut ita dicam, in mari ambulantem, &c , See here, pag. 345. to 349. to the same purpose. Christians then in this Fathers judgement have farre greater, farre better Spectacles then all the Play-houses in the world can yeeld them: They have many heavenly, sweet and spirituall Spectacles on which to cast their eyes and thoughts ; these they must alwayes contemplate; not these base filthy Enterludes. I shall therefore cloze up this objection with that excellent passage of Tertullian , which answers it to the full. Nostr ae caenae, nostrae nuptiae nondum sunt: non possum cum illis (Spectatoribus) discumbere, quia nec illi nobiscum. Vicibus disposita res est. Nunc illi letantur, nos conflictamur . Seculum (inquit) gaudebit, vos tristes eritis. Lugeamus ergo dum Ethnici gaudent, ut cum lugere c aeperint, gaudeamus; ne pariter nunc gaudentes, tunc quoque pariter lugeamus. Delicatus es Christiane, si & in seculo voluptatem concupiscis, im[illeg.]o nimium stultus si hoc existimas voluptatem. Philosophi quidem hoc nomen quieti & tranquillitati dederunt, in ea gaudent, in ea avocantur, in ea etiam gloriantur. Tu mihi metas & scenas & pulverem, & harenas suspiras. Dicas velim, non possumus vivere sine voluptate, qui mori cum voluptate debebimus? Nam quod est aliud votum nostrum, quam quod & Apostoli; exire de seculo & recipi apud Dominum. Haec voluptas, ubi & votum. Iam nunc si putas delectamentis exigere spacium hoc, cur tam ingratus es, ut tot, & tales voluptates a Deo contributas tibi satis non habeas, neque recognoscas? Quid enim jocundius quam Dei Patris & Domini reconciliatio, quam veritatis revelatio, quam errorum recognitio, quam tantorum retro criminum venia? quae major voluptas , qu am fastidium ipsius voluptatis, quam seculi totius contemptus, quam vera libertas, quam conscientia integra, quam vita sufficiens, quam mortis timor nullus, quod calcas Deos Nationum, quod Daemonia expellis, quod medicinas facis, quod revelationes petis, quod Deo vivis? H ae voluptates, hae spectacula Christianorum, sancta, perpetua, gratuita; in his tibi ludos circenses interpraetare; cursus seculi intuere, tempora labentia dinumera, metas consummationis expecta, societates ecclesiarum defende, ad signum Dei suscitare, ad tubam Angeli erigere, ad martyrij palmas gloriare. Si scenic ae doctrinae delectant, satis nobis literarum est, satis versuum est, satis sententiarum, satis etiam canticorum, satis vocum, nec fabulae, sed veritates, nec strophae, sed simplicitates. Vis & pugillatus & luctatus? praesto sunt, non parva sed multa. Aspice impudicitiam dejectam a castitate, perfidiam caesam a fide, saevitiam a misericordia contusam, petulantiam a modestia adumbratam, & tales apud nos sunt agones, in quibus ipsi coronamur. Vis autem & sanguinis aliquid? habes Christi. Quale autem spectaculum in proximo est, adventus Domini jam indubitati, jam superbi, jam triumphantis? Quae illa exultatio Angelorum, quae gloria resurgentium sanctorum? quale regnum exinde justorum? qualis civitas nova Hierusalem? At enim supersunt alia spectacula, ille ultimus & perpetuus judicijy dies, ille nationibus insperatus, ille derisus, cum tanta seculi vetustas, & tot ejus nativitates uno igni haurientur. Qu ae tunc spectaculi latitudo? quid admirer? quid rideam? ubi gaudiam, ubi exultem spectans tot ac tantos reges, qui in caelum recepti nuntiabantur cunm ipso Iove, & ipsis suis testibus inimis tenebris congemiscentes? item praesides persecutores dominici nominis saevioribus quam ipsi flammis saevierunt insultantibus contra Christianos, liquescentes: quos praeterea sapientes illos philosophos coram discipulis suis una conflagrantibus crubescentes, quibus nihil ad Deum pertinere suadebant, quibus animas aut nullas, aut non in pristina corpora redituras adfirmabant: etiam poetas, non ad Rhodamantinec ad Minois, sed ad inopinati Christi tribunal palpitantes. Tunc magis Trag aedi audiendi, magis scilicet vocales in sua propria calamitate. Tunc histriones cognoscendi solutiores multo per ignem: tunc spectandus auriga inflammea rotatotus rubeus: tunc Xystici contemplandi, non in gymnasijs, sed in igne jaculati, nisi quod nec tunc quidem illes velim visos, ut qui malim ad eos potius conspectum insatiabilem conferre qui in dominum des aevierunt. Hic est ille (dicam) fabri aut qu aestuariae filius, Sabbati destructor , Samarites & Daemonium habens. Hic est quem a Iuda redimistis, hic est ille arundinis & colaphis diverberatus, sputamentis dedecoratus, felle & aceto potatus. Hic est quem clam discentes subripuerunt, ut resurrexisse dicatur, vel hortulanus detraxit ne lactuc ae suae frequentia comeantium laederentur. Vt talia spectes, ut talibus exultes, quis tibi praetor, aut consul, aut quaestor, aut sacerdos de sua liberalitate praestabit? & tamen haec jam quodammodo per fidem habemus spiritu imaginante repraesentata. Caeterum qualia illa sunt, qu ae nec oculus vidit, nec auris audivit, nec in cor hominis ascenderunt? credo Circo, & utraque cauea & omni stadio gratioru. thus at large evinced, and those Objections answered, which are most usually opposed in their unjust defence, there is nothing now remaining, but that I should cloze up this whole Treatise with a few words of exhortation to Play- poets, Players, and Play-haunters, whom the love of Stage-playes hath seduced , to their eternall prejudice. And here I shall first of all beseech all Play-poets, to ponder with themselves; that they are the primary causes of all the sinnes which Players, Playes or Play-houses doe occasion: not any one sinne is there that any Actors, Auditors, or Spectators commit by meanes of acting or beholding these their Stage-playes, but flowes originally from them, and shall at last be set on their account: for if there were no Play-house-poets there could be no Playes to see or act, and so by consequence no such accursed fruits of Stage-playes as now are too too frequent in the world, both to the publike and mens private hurt. Now tell mee I beseech you, what man, what Christian is there who in Gods, in mens account would thus be branded for an inventor of evill things; a publike nursery of all sin and wickednesse; a man borne onely for the common hurt both of himselfe and others, yea an instrument raysed up from Hell it selfe to draw on thousands to that horrid place of their eternall woe. Quanto autem non nasci melius fuit, qua sic numerari inter publico malo natos? Better had it beene for you never to have had a being, to have perished in the wombe like an untimely birth: yea happier were it that a milstone had beene fastned about your neckes and you so drowned in the very depth of the Sea , then that you should thus pull downe damnation, eternall damnation on your owne and infinite others heads by these your prophane ungodly Enterludes, which will prove no other at the last but the evidences of your vanity, folly, sinne and shame, and without repentance your owne and others destruction . O therefore deare Christian Brethren, as you tender your owne, the States, the Churches welfare; as you feare, that dreadfull reckning which you must shortly make before the Iudgement Seate of Christ, when all your idle, wanton, amorous, prophane, ungodly, scurrilous Playes and words, with all the sinnes they have produced, shall be charged on your soules; let me now perswade you with many a bitter sigh and teare, to lament your former , and seriously to renounce your future Play-making, as many true penitent Play-poets have done before you , endeavouring to consecrate your much applauded wits, your parts and industry to Gods glory, the Churches, the Republikes benefit, your owne and others spirituall good, which you have formerly devoted to the Devils pompes and service , the Republikes prejudice, sinnes advantage, Religions infamy, and mens common hurt . O consider, consider I beseech you, that as long as you continue Play-poets, you are but the professed agents of the world, the flesh, the Devill, whose pompes, whose lusts and vanities you have long since renounced ; that you doe but sacrifice your wits, your parts, your studies, your inventions, your lives to these accursed Masters, who can gratifie you with no other wages at the last, but Hell and endlesse torments ; a poore reward for so hard a service. Doe not, O doe not then devote your pretious time, your flourishing parts of Poetry, Eloquence, Art and Learning to these usurping hellish tyrants, which you should wholy dedicate to your God , to whom they are onely due: but since you are no longer debtors to the flesh to live after the flesh, nor yet to the world, the Devill, or sinne to doe them service, let God alone henceforth enjoy them , from whom, for whom you did at first receive them . Alas my Brethren when you shall come to die, when terrors of conscience shall seize upon your soules , or when as Christ himselfe shall sit upon his Throne of Glory for to Iudge you , what good, what comfort, (yea what shame and horror ) will all your Play-poems bring to your amazed spirits? then will you wish in earnest, O that we had beene so happy as never to have pend, or seene a Stage-play; yea woe be to us that we were ever so ill imployed as to cast away our time, our parts, our studies, our learning upon such heathenish, foolish and unchristian vanities. Alas, one day, one houre in Gods Courts , Gods service, had beene farre better to us; then all the yeeres of our vaine uselesse lives , which wee have spent on Playes and Theaters, which now bring nothing else but a more multiplied treasure of endlesse miseries and condemnation on our owne and others soules, which these our Enterludes have drawne on to sundry sinnes. O that the day had perished wherein we were borne, and the night wherein it was said, there is a man-childe conceived! Why dyed we not from the wombe, why did we not give up the ghost when we came out of the belly, before ever we had learnt the art of making Playes? for then should wee have lien still and beene at rest; then had we beene free from all those Play-house sinnes and tortures which now surcharge our soules, then had wee never drawne such troopes of Players, of Play-haunters after us into Hell, whose company cannot mitigate, but infinitely enlarge our endlesse torments . And then all this over-late repentance will be to little purpose. O then be truely penitent and wise betimes , before these dayes of horror and amazement over-whelme you, that so you may have peace and comfort in your latter ends , in that Great, that terrible Day of the Lord Iesus, when all impenitent Play-poets, Players, and Play-haunters faces shall gather blacknesse, their hearts faint, their spirits languish, their joynts tremble, their knees smite one against the other, and their mouthes shreeke out unto the Mountaines to fall upon them, and unto the Rockes to cover them, for feare of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majesty, when he shall come in flaming fire to render indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish to every soule of man that doth evill, whether he be Iew or Gentile . Certainely the time will come ere long, when the Sunne shall become blacke as sackcloth, and the Moone as blood: when the Starres of Heaven shall fall unto the earth even as a Figtree casteth her untimely fruit when shee is shaken with a mighty winde; when the Heavens shall depart as a scrowle when it is rolled together, and the Elements melt with fervent heat; when every Mountaine and Island shall be moved out of their places, yea the earth also and the workes that are therein shall be burnt up with fire: when the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chiefe Captaines, and the mighty men , (who now wallow securely in their sinfull lusts and pleasures without feare of God or man) and every Bond-man and every Free-man (who lives and dyes in sinne and vaine delights) shall hide themselves in the Dennes and Rockes of the Mountaines; yea say to the Mountaines and Rockes, fall on us, and cover us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lambe: for the Great Day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand ? And then what good, what profit will all the Stage-playes you have penned, seene, or acted, doe you? Will they appease that sin-revenging Iudge, before whose Tribunall you shall then bee dragged? Will they any way comfort or support your drooping trembling soules? or any whit asswage your endlesse, easelesse torments? O no ! nothing but Christ, nothing but grace and holinesse , (which the . world, which Playes and Play-poets now deride and laugh at) will then stand you in stead , and sheild of all the terrors of that dismall Day. Wherefore (beloved) seeing that all these dreadfull Spectacles, and this day of horror draw so nigh, be diligent that yee may be found of God in peace, without spot and blamelesse; abandoning Playmaking, with all such fruitlesse studies, passing all the time of your sojourning here in feare, endevouring to be holy in all manner of conversation, even as God is holy ; and growing up daily more and more in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, laying up in store for your selves a good foundation against the time to come; that so you may lay hold on eternall life, and receive that Crowne of righteousnesse which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall give at that Day to all those who love, and wait for his appearing. Secondly, I shall here beseech all voluntary Actors, of academicall or private Enterludes, in the name and feare of God, as they tender the glory of their Creator and Redeemer, the peace of their owne consciences, the eternall welfare of their soules, or their owne credit and repute with men, now seriously to consider the intolerable infamy, sinfulnesse, shame, and vanity of acting Playes, which not only the Primitive Christians, and Protestants, but even Pagans and Papists have condemned. Alas how can you justifie or excuse your selves in the sight of God for this your action, when as you are thus condemned in the eyes of men? or how can you appeare before God with comfort in the Day of Iudgement, when as you are unable to stand innocent before mans tribunall in these dayes of grace? Certainely, if for every idle word that men shall speake, (yea and for every idle part or gesture to, which they shall act or use) they must give an account at the day of Iudgement ; what a dreadfull reckning must you then expect for all those idle wanton words and gestures which have passed from you whiles you have acted Playes? Repent therefore, repent I say with floods of brinish teares for what is past, and never adventure the acting of any academicall Enterlude for time to come. And if any Clergie-men, who have taken ministeriall Orders upon them, are guilty of this infamy, this impiety of prophaning, of polluting their high  & heavenly profession by acting or dancing on any publike or private Stage; becomming thereby the worlds, the Devils professed Ministers instead of Christs, to the intolerable scandall of Religion, the ill example of the Laity, ( who are apt to imitate them in their lewdnesse) and their own deserved infamy; Let such disorderly histrionicall Divines, consider that of Bernard, Si quis de populo deviat solus perit, Verum Pastoris error multos involuit, & tantis obest quantis preaest ipse. Verum tu Sacerdos Dei altissimi, cui ex his placere gestis, mundo an Deo? Si mundo, cur Sacerdos? Si Deo, cur qualis populus talis & Sacerdos? Nam si placere vis mundo, quid tibi prodest Sacerdotium? Volens itaque placere hominibus, Deo non places. Si non places, non placas . Alas how can any commit the custody of their soules to such who are altogether negligent of their owne. Qui sibi nequam, cui bonus ? Placet vobis ut illi homini credam animam meam qui perdidit suam ? Was S. Bernards question to Pope Innocent ; it may be mine to Patrons and Ordinaries who present or admit such play-acting or other scandalous Ministers to the cure of soules, which ought to be deprived of all sacred Orders and preferments, as the precedent Councels and Canonists witnesse . But how ever such Actors chance to escape all humane penalties here, let them remember that they shall surely undergoe the everlasting censure of the Great Shepheard of the Sheep. Christ Iesus , hereafter: and let this for ever disswade them from this ungodly practise of personating Stageplayes, which hath beene most execrably infamous in all former ages. As for all professed common Actors, I shall here adjure them by the very hopes and joyes of Heaven, and the eternall torments of Hell, to abominate, to renounce all future acting, and this their hellish profession, which makes them the very instruments, the arch-agents, the professed bondslaves of the Devill, the publike enemies both of Church and State, the authors of their owne and others just damnation; excommunicating them both from the Church, the Sacraments, and society of the faithfull in this life, and everlastingly excluding them from Gods blessed presence in the life to come . You then who are but newly entred into this infernall unchristian course of Play-acting, consider I beseech you, that this your infamous profession is the broad beaten rode to all kinde of vice, of wickednesse  & prophanesse; the readiest passage unto Hell it selfe, in which you cannot finally proceed without the assured losse of Heaven; & a professed apprentiship to the very Devill, whose pompes, whose service you have long since renounced in your baptisme; and therefore cannot now embrace without the highest perjury. O then take pitty on your owne poore soules before it be too late; before Stage-playes, sinne, and Satan have gotten such absolute full possession of you, as utterly to disable you to cast off their yoake : And now I pray say thus unto your soules; Cur ergo tantopere vitam istam desideramus, in qua quanto amplius vivimus tanto plus peccamus? Quanto est vita longior, tanto culpa numerosior. Quotidie namque crescunt mala & subtrahuntur bona. Minime pro certo est bonus qui melior esse non vult: & ubi incipis nolle fieri melior, ibi etiam desinis esse bonus . Alas why will you die, why will you voluntarily cast away your soules for ever by this trade of acting Playes, when as you need not hazard them if you will now renounce it? What, is there any profit or pleasure in your owne damnation? is there any advantage to be gotten by the Devils service? is there any safe living in the very mouth of Hell it selfe? Why then should you proceed on in this Diabolicall trade? Doe your Friends or gracelesse Parents presse, or else induce you to it, even against your wills? O give them that pathetical resolute answer which Helyas the Monke once gave unto his Parents. , Si me vere ut boni, ut pij Parentes diligitis; si veram si fidelem erga filium pictatem habetis, quid me patriomnium Deo placere satagentem inquietatis, & abejus servitio cujus servire regnare est, retrahere attentatis? Vere nunc cognosco, quod inimici hominis domestici ejus. In hoc vobis obedire non debeo, in hoc vos non agnosco parentes sed hostes. Si diligeretis me gauderetis utique quia vado admeum atque vestrum, immo universorum patrem. Alioquin quid mihi & vobis ? Quid a vobis habeo nisi peccatum & miseriam? hoc solum quod gesto corruptibile corpus de vestro me habere fateor & agnosco. Non sufficit vobis quod me in hanc seculi miseriam miserum miseri induxistis, quod in peccato vestro peccatores peccatorem genuistis; quod in peccato natum de peccato nutristis, nisi etiam invidendo mihi misericordiam quam consecutus sum ab eo qui non vult mortem peccatoris, filium insuper gehennae faciatis? O durum patrem! o saevam matrem! o parentes crudeles & impios! imo non parentes sed peremptores, quorum dolor salus pignoris, quorum consolatio mors filij est. Qui me malunt perire cum ijs, quam regnare sine eis. Qui me rursus ad naufragium unde tandem nudus evasi, rursus ad ignem, unde vix semiustus exivi, rursus ad latrones a quibus semivivus relictus sum, sed miserante Samaritano jam aliquantulum convalui, revocare conantur, & militem Christi prope jam rapto caelo triumphantem, ab ipso jam introitu gloriae, tanquam canem ad vomitum, tanquam suem ad lutum, ad seculum reducere moliuntur. Mira abusio. Domus ardet; ignis instat a tergo, & fugienti prohibetur egredi; evadenti suadetur regredi? & haec ab his qui in incendio positi sunt & obstinatissima dementia, ac dementissima obstinatione fugere periculum nolunt? Proh furor! Si vos contemnitis mortem vestram, cur etiam appetitis meam? Si inquam negligitis salutem vestram, quid juvat etiam persequi meam? Quare vos non potius sequimini me fugientem, ut non ardeatis? An hoc est vestri cruciatus levamen, si me etiam perimatis, & hoc solum timetis, ne soli pereatis? Ardens ardentibus quod solatium praestare poterit? Quae inquam consolatio damnatis socios habere suae damnationis, &c? Definite igitur parentes mei, definite, & vos frustra plorando affligere, & me gratis revocando inquietare . Doth the love of gaine or pleasure allure you to it? Alas, what will it profit you to win the whole world (much lesse a little filthy gaine, or foolish carnall momentany delight) and then to lose your soules? Remember therefore your Creator in the dayes of your youth, by abjuring the Devils service, and betaking your selves to Gods, lest the Devill being your lord and master in your youth, prove your tormentor onely in your age. Recedat itaque peccandi amor, succedat judicij timor. Nam quamdiu in vobis carnalium rerum vixerit appetitus, spiritalium a vobis sensuum elongabit affectus. Nemo in vas aliquo faetore corruptum balsama pretiosa transfundit; & sicut dixit Dominus; Nemo mittit vinum novum in utres veteres. Difficile est ut assurgere ad bonum possis, nisi a malo ante diverteris: quamdiu nova delicta adijciuntur, vetera non curantur. Prorsus peccata non redimet, qui peccare non desinit: quia nemo potest duobus dominis servire. In uno animae domicilie iniquitas atque iustitia, castitas atque luxuria simul habitare non possunt. Interdicatur igitur accessus voluptati, atque libidini, ut domus munda pateat castitati: excludatur Diabolus cum militia vitiorum, ut Christus cum choro possit intrare virtutum . You who have beene ancient Stage-players, and have served many Apprentiships to the Devill in this your infernall profession, O consider, consider seriously I beseech you, the wretched condition wherein now you stand: your parts are almost acted, your last dying Scenes draw on apace, and it will not belong ere you goe off the Theater of this world unto your proper place ; and then how miserable will your condition be? You have beene the Devils professed agents, his meniall hired servants all your lives, and must you not then expect his wages at your deathes? You have treasured up nought but wrath unto your selves against the day of wrath, whiles you lived here , precipitating both your selves and others to destruction; and can you reape ought but wrath and vengeance hereafter if you repent not now ? Your very profession hath excommunicated you the Church, the Sacraments, the society of the Saints on earth ; and will it not then much more exclude you out of Heaven? O miserabilis humana conditio, & sine Christo vanum omne quod vivimus was S. Hieroms patheticall ejaculation: and may it not be much more yours, who have lived without Christ in the world , who have renounced his service, and betaken your selves to the Devils workes and pompes against your baptismall vow, as if you had covenanted by your selves and others to serve the Devill, and performe his workes, even then when you did at first abjure them: O then bewaile with many a bitter teare, with many an heart-piercing sigh; with much shame, much horror, griefe and indignation, the losse of all that precious time which you have already consumed in the Devils vassalage, and since God hath forborne you for so many yeeres, out of his tender mercy, O now at last thinke it enough, yea too too much that you have spent your best, your chiefest dayes in this unchristian diabolicall lewde profession; professing publikely in S. Peters words; The time past of our lives may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, and of the Devill to, we will henceforth live to God alone : If you will now cast of your former hellish trade of life, with shame and detestation; if you will prove new men, new creatures for the time to come; Christs armes, Christs wounds, yea and the Church her bosome stand open to receive you, notwithstanding all the lusts and sinnes of your former ignorance . But if you will yet stop your eares, and harden your hearts against all advice, proceeding on stil in this your ungodly trade of life, in which you cannot but be wicked , then know you are such as are marked out for Hell; such who are given up to a reprobate sence to worke all uncleanesse even with greedinesse, that you all may be damned in the Day of Iudgement, for taking pleasure in unrighteousnesse, and disobeying the truth . As therefore you expect to enter Heaven Gates, or to escape eternall damnation in that great dreadfull Day, when you must all appeare before the Iudgement Seate of Christ, to give a particular account of all those idle, vaine and sinfull actions gestures, words and thoughts, which have proceeded from you, or beene occasioned in others by you all your dayes , be sure to give over this wicked trade of Play-acting without any more delayes, which will certainely bring you to destruction, if you renounce it not, as all true penitent Players have done before you. For if the righteous shall scarcely be saved in the Day of Iudgement, where shall such ungodly sinners , as you appeare ? Certainely, you shall not be able to stand in Iudgement , or to justifie your selves in this your profession in that sinne-confounding soule-appaling Day: but you shall then be punished with everlasting perdition from the presence of the Lord, & from the glory of his power , if the very riches of his grace and mercy will not perswade you to renounce this calling now; Quantoque diutius Deus vos expectavit vt emendetis, tanto districtius judicabit si neglexeritis : by how much the longer God hath forborne you here expecting your repetance, the more severely shal he then condemne you. If any Stage-players here object, that they know not how to live or maintaine themselves if they should give over acting. To this I answer first, that as it is no good argument for Bawdes, Panders, Whores, Theeves, Sorcerers, Witches, Cheaters, to persevere in these their wicked courses, because they cannot else maintaine themselves; so it is no good Plea for Players. No man must live by any sinfull profession; nor yet doe evill that good may come of it : therefore you must not maintaine your selves by acting Playes, it being a lewde unchristian infamous occupation. Secondly, there are divers lawfull callings and imployments by which Players might live in better credit, in a farre happier condition then now they doe, would they but bee industrious: It is therefore Players idlenesse, their love of vanity & sinfull pleasures, not want of other callings, that is the ground of this objection . Thirdly, admit there were no other course of life but this for Players; I dare boldly averre that the charity of Christians is such, as that they would readily supply the wants of all such indigent impotent aged Actors (unable to get their livelihood by any other lawfull trade) who out of conscience shall give over Playing. Certainely, the charity of Christians was such in Cyprians dayes, that they would rather maintaine poore penitent Actors with their publike almes, then suffer them to perish, or continue acting ; and I doubt not but their charity will be now as large in this particular as it was then. Lastly, admit the objection true; yet it were farre better for you to die, to starve, then any wayes to live by sinne or sinfull courses. There is no absolutenecessity at all that men should live; but there is this necessity lies on all men, not to sinne ; yea every pious Christian as is evident by the concurrent examples of all the Martyrs , should rather chuse to die the cruellest death, then to commit one act of sinne. Better therefore is it for Players to part with their profession for Christs sake even with the very losse of their lives and goods, ( which they must willingly lose for Christ, or else they are not worthy of him ,) then to retaine their Play-acting, and so lose their Saviour, themselves, their very bodies and soules for all eternity, as all unreclaimed, unrepenting Players in all probability ever doe. Let Players therefore if they will be mercifull to themselves, shew mercy rather to their soules, then to their bodies or estates. Talis enim misericordia crudelitate plena est, qua videlicet ita corpori servitur, ut anima juguletur. Qu ae enim charitas est, carnem diligere, & spiritum negligere? Quave discretio, totum dare corpori & animae nihil? Qualis verc misericordia ancillam reficere & dominam inter ficere? Nemo pro hujusmodi misericordia sperat se consequi misericordiam sed certissime potius paenam expectet . Yea let them renounce their Play-acting though they perish here, rather then perish eternally hereafter to live by it now. Lastly, I shall here exhort all Play-haunters, all Spectators of any publike or private Enterludes, to ponder all the premised reasons and Authorities against Stage-playes, together with those severall soule-condemning wickednesses, sinnes, yea fearfull judgements, in which they frequently involue their Actors and Spectators : to remember, that they are the very Devils snares, his workes, his pompes, which they most solemnely renounced in their baptisme : that they are the greatest, the most pernicious corruptions both of their Actors, their Spectators mindes and manners; the onely Canker-wormes of their graces, their vertues; the chiefest incendiaries of their carnall lusts; the common occasions of much actuall lewdnesse, sinne and wickednesse; the principall obstacles of their sincere repentance; the grand empoysoners of their soules and if we believe S. Augustine, the mortiferous broadbeatenway to Hell it selfe, and everlasting death, in which whole troopes of men run daily on unto destruction . O then let all these, all other fore-alleaged flexanimous considerations divorce you now from Stage-playes, from Theaters, which else will seperate you from your God; and so engage your hearts, your judgements, your consciences against them, as never to frequent them more upon any occasion or perswasion whatsoever. You have heard and seene at large what Censures, what Verdicts the Primitive Church, both before and under the Law and Gospell; the ancientest Christians, Councels, Fathers; the best Christian, the best Pagan Nations, Emperours, Princes, States, Magistrates, Writers, both ancient and moderne, have constantly, have unanimously passed upon Stage- playes, Theaters, Players, Play-haunters , against whom Tertullian, Cyprian, Chrysostome, Augustine, Salvian , and other Fathers, with sundry moderne Authors , have professedly written ample Volumes: You have seene all ages, all places, all qualities and degrees of men, Iewes and Gentiles, Greekes and Barbarians, Christians and Pagans, Protestants and Papists, yea Popes and Iesuits to , concurring in their just damnation. Be not, O be not yee therefore wiser, nay worser, then all, then any of these Play-condemning Worthies who have gone before you ; (whose harmonious Play-confounding resolutions agreeable with the Scripture , if Saint Bernard may be credited, must binde you to renounce all Stage-playes, in the very selfesame manner as if God himselfe had expresly commanded you to abandon them:) frequent not Playes which they abominated; pleade not for Enterludes which they so seriously, so abundantly condemned: Let not that censure of holy Bernard be verified of you; that you have now not onely lost the power of the ancient Christian Religion, but even the very shew and outside to : but as you are Christians in name, in profession, so bee you such in truth, in practise. And since it was the most notorious character of Christians heretofore, to abominate, to abandon Players, Playes and Play-houses ; let it bee your honour, your piety, your practicall badge of Christianity to forsake them now: that so imitating the Primitive Play-renouncing Christians in their holinesse, you may at last participate with them in their eternall blisse. And so much the rather let me admonish you to withdraw your selves from Playes and Play-houses, because no ordinance of God can doe you any good, or clense you from your sinnes, whiles you resort to Theaters , as I have largely proved: heare but Saint Chrysostome once more to this purpose, where speaking against mens and womens parling, laughing, and gazing about in Churches (which hee severely censures) he writes thus. Nunquid theatrica sunt h aec quae hic geruntur? opinor autem quod id Theatris debeamus. Inobedientes enim multos nobis constituunt & ineptos: quae enim hic extruuntur, illic subvertuntur: & non hoc solum, sed & alias immunditias necesse est Theatri studiosis adhaerere. Et perinde fit ac si quis campum velit purgare, in quem fons luto fluens, influat; quantum enim purgaris, tantum insfuit. Hoc & hic fit, quando enim purgamus a Theatro huc venientes, & immundiciam afferentes, dum illuc iterum abeunt, majorem contrahunt immundiciam, quasi dedita opera sic vivant ut nobis negocium faciant, & iterum veniunt multo luto sordidati, in moribus, in gestibus, in verbis, in risu, in desidia. Deinde iterum nos fodimus, quasi dedita opera in hoc fodientes, ut puros illos dimissos iterum videamus luto ac caeno inquinari . You then who have beene constant Play-haunters besmeared with their filth and dung for divers yeeres together, you who have spent your youth, your manhood, your best and chiefest dayes which you should have dedicated to God, your honest callings, and farre better things ; on Playes, on Play-houses, and such lascivious sports, you who have cast away your money, your estates on Players, Playes  & Play-houses, (the very factors, pompes and synagogues of the Devill) wherewith you should have cherished Christs poore needy members ; You who have beene ancient Patriots, Supporters of Actors or their Enterludes either by your purses, or your presence, drawing thereby upon your soules the guilt of many a fearefull unlamented sinne; remember, O remember that it is now more then time for you to clense your selves from these Aug aean Stables; with which you have beene too long defiled: to renounce these cursed pompes of Satan, which you have too long served; to redeeme the short remainder of that most sacred time which you have too prodigally, too sinfully consumed; to take some speedy serious course for the mortifying of those soule-slaying fleshly lusts which you have over-long fomented; for the adorning, the saving of those immortall soules , which you have over-much neglected; for the attoning of that holy God, that blessed Saviour that sanctifying Spirit of grace, which you have too highly, too long provoked , crucified , grieved which you ; can never doe whiles you resort to Stage- playes . And since the world, the flesh, the Devill have had your youth and strength, let God be sure to enjoy your age, whom you have sacrilegiously robbed of all the rest . Alas, all the time that you have already past in Play-haunting, and such delights of sinne, hath beene but a time of spirituall death , wherein you have been worse then nought in Gods account: Ab eo enim tempore censemur ex quo in Christo renascimur , as Saint Hierom truely writes: and what other profit have you reaped from Playes or Play- houses, Nisi quod senes magis onusti peccatorum fasce proficiscimini , as the same Father speaks? O therefore now at last before it be too late , before death hath wounded you, Heaven excluded you, Hell devoured you, repent of all your former Play-haunting with many a sob and teare, abandoning all Playes, all Play-houses for the future; ut sic correcti atque in melius reformati, qui admirati fuerant prius in Spectaculis insaniam, nunc admirentur in moribus disciplinam . You who are but young and newly entred into this dangerous course of Play-haunting; you of whom I may say as Seneca once did of the Roman gentry; Ostendam nobilissimos juvenes mancipia pantomimorum , remember that holy covenant which you not long since made to God in baptisme, to forsake the Devill and all his workes, the pompes, the vanities of this wicked world, with all the sinfull lusts of the flesh, of which Stage-playes (as the Fathers teach you) are the chiefe ; O perjure, perjure not your selves, renounce not your christianity, your faith, your vow, your baptisme (by frequenting Playes) in your youth, your child-hood; bequeath not your selves so soone unto the Devill, after your solemne consecration unto God in Christ ; let not him gaine possession of your persons, your service in your youth, that so hee may command, and challenge them in your age; Non enim obtinebis ut desinat si incipere permiseris: ergo intranti resistamus, &c. But as you have given up your soules and bodies as an holy living sacrifice unto God in baptisme, to serve him with them in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of your lives; so be ; yee sure to make good your promise, by remembring , by serving your Creator in the dayes of your youth , your strength, your health and life, who will then crowne you with glory and immortality at your death. Pitty it is to see how many ingenious Youthes and Girles; how many young (that I say not old) Gentlemen and Gentlewomen of birth and quality, (as if they were borne for no other purpose but to consume their youth, their lives in lascivious dalliances, Playes and pastimes, or in pampering, in adorning those idolized living carcases of theirs , which will turne to earth, to dung, to rottennesse and wormes-meat ere be long, and to condemne, their poore neglected soules) casting by all honest studies, callings, imployments, all care of Heaven, of salvation, of their owne immortall soules, of that God who made them, that Saviour who redeemed them, that Spirit who should sanctifie them, and that Common-weale that fosters them; doe in this idle age of ours, like those Epicures of old most prodigally, most sinfully riot away the very creame and flower of their yeeres, their dayes in Play-houses, in Dancing-Schooles, Tavernes, Ale-houses, Dice-houses, Tobacco-shops, Bowling-allies, and such infamous places, upon those life-devouring, time-exhausting Playes and pastimes, (that I say not sinnes beside,) as is a shame for Pagans, much more for Christians to approve. O that men endued with reason, ennobled with religion; with immortall soules, fit onely for the noblest, heavenliest, sublimest and divinest actions , should ever bee so desperately besotted as to wast their precious time upon such vaine, such childish, base ignoble pleasures, which can no way profit soule or body , Church or State; nor yet advance their temporall, much lesse their spirituall and eternall good, which they should ever seeke. You therefore deare Christian Brethren, who are, who have beene peccant in this kinde, for Gods sake, for Christs sake, for the holy Ghosts sake, for Religions sake, (which now extremely suffers by this your folly;) for the Church and Common-weales sake, for your owne soules sake, which you so much neglect, repent of what is past recalling, and for the future time resolve through Gods assistance, never to cast away your time, your money, your estates, your good names, your lives, your salvation, upon these unprofitable spectacles of vanity, lewdnesse, lasciviousnesse, or these delights of sinne, of which you must necessarily repent and be ashamed , or else be condemned for them at the last; passing all the time of your pilgrimage here in feare , and imploying all the remainder of your short inconstant lives, in those honest studies, callings, and pious Christian duties which have their fruit unto holinesse, and the end everlasting life . And because we have now many wanton females of all sorts resorting daily by troopes unto our Playes, our Play-houses, to see and to be seene , as they did in Ovids age; I shall only desire them (if not their Parents and Husbands, to consider; that it hath evermore beene the notorious badge of prostituted Strumpets and the lewdest Harlots, to ramble abroad to Playes, to Play-houses; whether no honest, chast or sober Girles or Women, but only branded Whores, & infamous Adulteresses did usually resort in ancient times: the Theater being then made a common Brothell: And that all ages, all places have constantly suspected the chastity, yea branded the honesty of those females who have beene so immodest as to resort to Theaters, to Stage-playes, which either finde or make them Harlots ; inhibiting all married Wives and Virgins to resort to Playes and Theaters , as I have here amply proved. Since therefore Saint Paul expresly enjoynes all women (especially those of the younger sort) to be sober, chaste, keepers at home , (yea therefore keepers at home, that they may be chaste and sober, as ancient and moderne Commentators glosse it;) that the Word of God be not blasphemed : (where as the dissolutenesse of our lascivious, impudent, rattle-pated gadding females now is such, that as if they had purposely studied to appropriate to themselves King Solomons memorable character of an whorish woman , with an impudent face, a subtile heart and the attire of an Harlot; they are lowde and stubborne; their feet abide not in their houses; now they are without, now in the streets, and lie in wait at every corner ; being never well pleased nor contented, but when they are wandring abroad to Playes, to Play-houses , Dancing-matches, Masques, and publike Shewes; from which nature it selfe (if we believe S. Chrysostome hath sequestred all women ; (or to such suspicious places under pretence of businesse or some idle visits, where they oft-times leave their modesty, their chastity behinde them, to their eternall infamy:) Let me now beseech all female Play-haunters, as they regard this Apostolicall precept, which enjoynes them, to be sober, chast, keepers at home (or good carefull House-wives , as some have rendred it:) adorning themselves in modest apparell, with shamefastnesse and sobriety : (which now are out of fashion) not with broidered cut or borrowed plaited haire, or gold, or pearles, or costly array , (the onely fashions of our age;) but ( which becommeth women professing godlinesse) with good workes : As they tender their owne honesty, fame or reputation both with God and men; the honour of their sex; the prayse of that Christian Religion, which they professe, the glory of their God, their Saviour, and their soules salvation , to abandon Playes and Play-houses, as most pernicious Pests; where all females, wrecke their credits; most, their chastity; some, their fortunes; not a few, their soules : and to say unto them as the Philosopher did unto his wealth which he cast into the Sea, Abite in profundum ma ae cupiditates; ego vos mergam ne ipse mergar a vobis. I Have now deare Christian Readers, through Gods assistance, compleatly finished this my Histrio-Mastix , wherein I have represented both to your view and censures to, (as well as my poore ability, and other interloping Imployments would permit,) the unlawfulnesse, the mischievous qualities and effects of Stage-playes themselves, and of their penning, acting, and frequenting; endeavoring (out of a cordiall desire of your eternall welfare ) as much as in mee lieth, to perswade you to abandon them; by ripping up the severall mischiefes and dangers that attend them. If any therefore henceforth perish by frequenting Stage-playes, after this large discovery of their sin-engendring soule condemning qualities, their sinne, their blood shall light upon their owne heads, not on mine , who have taken all this paines to doe them good. All then I shall desire of you in recompence of my labour, is but this; that as I have acted my part in oppugning, so you would now play your parts to in abominating, in abandoning, Stage-playes, without which this Play-refuting Treatise, will doe no good, but hurt unto your soules, by turning your sinnes of ignorance, into sinnes of knowledge and rebellion. The labour of it hath beene mine alone; my desire, my prayer is and shall bee, that the benefit, the comfort of it may be yours, the Republikes, and the glory, Gods; the convincing concurrence of whose ever-blessed Spirit , so blesse, so prosper it to your everlasting weale, that your whole spirits, soules and bodies, may be henceforth preserved blamelesse , from all future soule-defiling Enterludes and delights of sinne, unto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ ; ( before whose dreadful Tribunall we must al ere long be summoned, to give an account of all our actions :)  & that you may so judge of Stage-playes now, as you will determine of them in that great dreadfull Day of Iudgement, and in the day of death, when you shall not judge amisse. And because no dissolute Libertines, or licentious Readers through Satans or the worlds delusions, should cheat their soules of the benefit intended to them by this worke, out of a prejudicate opinion, that it is overstrict, and more then puritanically invective against Players, Playes and Theaters; to prevent this fond evasion, and to put all exclaiming Play-patriots to perpetuall silence, pretermitting the memorable omitted authorities of Gulielmus Stuckius, Antiquitatum Convivalium. lib. 3. cap,20.21,22, &c Tiguri.1597. and of Gulielmus Peraldus, Summ ae Virtutum ac Vitiorum. Tom. 2. Lugduni. 1585. Tit. De Luxuria. c.3.p.68. to 77. two excellent learned Discourses against Stage- playes, health-drinking, and mixt lascivious dancing , which I shall commend unto your reading; with the Imperiall Edicts of Charles the Great, against Stage-playes and Dancing on Lords-dayes, and Holy-dayes , and all fore-cited Play-condemning Authorities:) I shall here by way of Conclusion, cloze up this whole Discourse, with the words of Ioannis Mariana , a famous Spanish Iesuit ; who besides his large and learned Booke, De Spectaculis , professedly oppugning Stage-playes, hath since the publication of that Treatise, in his 3\. Booke and 16. Chapter De Rege & Regum Institutione.pag.341. to 352. (dedicated to King Philip the 3. of Spaine , and published in the yeere 1598. Cum Privilegio C aesareae Majestatis & permissu Superiorum , with the speciall prefixed approbations of Stephanus Hoieda, Visitor , and Petrus De Onua, Master Provinciall of the Iesuits of the Province of Toledo, in Spaine ,) delivered his positive and deliberate resolution against Players, Playes, and Play-houses in these ensuing termes, which is every way as harsh, as rigid and precise as any verdict, that either I my selfe, or any other fore-quoted Authors have here past against them. His words well worthy all Players and Play-haunters consideration are these. Publicam ludorum insaniam, qu ae spectacula nominantur, seperata disputatione pro virili parte castigavimus, multisque; Argumentis & majorum testimonijs confirmavimus, theatrilicentiam, de qua potissimum laborandum est, nihil esse aliud ; quam officinam impudiciti ae & improbitatis, ubi omnis  aetatis, sexus & conditionis homines depravantur: simulatisque & ludicris actionibus ad vitia vera informantur. Admonentur enim quid facere possint, & inflammantur libidine, quae aspectu maxime & auribus concitatur: puellae presertim, & juvenes, quos intempestive voluptatibus infici grave est , atque reipublic ae Christianae exitiale malum . Quid enim continet scena, nisi virginum stupra, & mores prostituti pudoris faeminarum, lenonum artes, atque lenarum, ancillarum & servorum fraudes, versibus numerosis & ornatis explicata, sententiarum luminibus distincta, eoq; tenacius memoriae adhaerentia, quarum rerum ignoratio multo commodior est? Histrionum impudici motus & gestus, fractaeq; in faeminarum modum voces, quibus impudicas mulieres imitantur, quid aliud nisi ad libidinem inflammant, per se ad vitia satis proclives? An major ulla corruptela morum excogitari possit ? Qu ae enim in scena per imaginem aguntur, peracta fabula cum risu commemorantur, sine pudore deinde fiunt , voluptatis cupiditate animum titillante: qui sunt veluti gradus ad suscipiendam pravitatem, cum sit facilie  a jocis ad seria transitus. Recte enim & sapienter Solomon, Quasi per risum, inquit, stultus operatur Scelus ; turpia enim, atq; inhonesta factu dictuq; dum ridemus, approbamus: suoq; pondere pravitas identidem inpejus trahit: Censeo ergo, moribus Christianis certissima pestem afferre theatri licentiam, nomini Christiano gravissimam ignominiam. Censeo Principi eam rem vel maxime cur ae fore, ne aut ipse suo exemplo authoritatem conciliet arti vanissimae, si frequenter intersit spectaculis, audiatque libenter fabulas, praesertim quae ab histrionibus venalibus exhibentur: & quo ad fieri poterit, de tota provincia exturbet eam pravitatem. Neque concedat mores suorum ea turpitudine depravari. Hoc nostrum votum est destinataq; sententia. Verum populi levitas  & peccantium multitudo, quasi moles quaedam opponitur; tum auctoritas eorum qui communi Errori patrocinantur. Et est excusatio furoris multitudo insanorum, hoc quoq; nomine prava nostra natura, quod vitijs suis & cupiditatibus favet, neq; facile avelli se sinit ab ijs quae cum voluptate suscipiuntur; cujus sumus natura cupidissimi. Vsque adeo ut si quis vanitati resistat, ei vehementer irascatur populi multitudo. Ille sit publicus inimicus , Augustinus ait, cui h aec faelicitas displicet, quisquis eam auferre vel mutare tentaverit, eum libera multitudo, avertat ab auribus, evertat a sedibus, auferat a viventibus . Excaecat nimirum prava consuetudo animos, & quae passim fieri videmus, defendere conantur quidem licenti ae patroni, magni scilicet Theologi , quasi juri & aequitati consona, otio & literis abutentes: quos redarguere facile erit testimonio & authoritate veterum Theologorum, in hac re non discrepantium ; a quibus discedere nostrae aetatis Theologos velle non putamus. Has omnes simulatae veritatis praestigias retegere non erit difficile, multitudinem a furore retinere difficilius erit: nisi publica accesserit authoritas, quorum interest magistratuum. Profecto curandum est, ut ea opinio publice suscipiatur, Theatra sane, quibus obsc aena argument a tractantur; officinam universae improbitatis esse, qui concurrunt eo non secus facere, quam qui ad ganeas, ad furta, ad caedes, ad lupanaria: qui suscepti laboris fructus erit multo maximus. Erunt enim qui pravitate cognita desinant peccare, salutemq; suam turpi voluptate potiorem habeant, neq; prudenter & scientes in mortem ferantur furentes, rapidi, & miserabiles, Illud certe omni cura prestandum, ut haec natio perditorum hominum, penitus a templis exturbetur : quod Romanorum tempore fuisse aliquando factum, Tacitus , Libro quartodecimo his verbis indicat. Acne modica quidem studia plebis exarsere, quiar redditi quanquam sc aenae pantomimi , [illeg.]erta[illeg.]ibus sacris prohibeantur. Qua ergo fronte histriones de foro raptos e publicis diversorijs in Templum Christiani inducent, ut per eos sacra festorum laetitia augeatur? Aut qui conveniat, uti Augustinus contra Romanos antiquos ait; histriones ignominia notare, atque in infami um numero ponere, per quos divinus cultus honestatur? cur a sacris ordinibus repellantur , quod ecclesiasticae leges sanciunt, quorum opera dies festi & caelestium celebritates illustrantur? Sed obijcis fortasse, eos in templis non in turpibus argumentis versari, sed sacras historias referre; quod utinam verum esset, & non potius ad movendum populi risum, obscaenissima quoq; actitarent. Et est acerbum negare non posse, quod sit turpe confiteri. Scimus s aepe in sanctissimis templis inter fabuli actus, chori adimstar adulterorum furta, amores turpes recitari, ut honestissimus quisque ea spectacula vitare debeat, si decori, & pudori consultum velit. Et putabimus tamen qu ae a modestis hominibus fugiuntur, ea caelestibus esse grata? Ego crediderim potius quasi sordes & religionis ludibria, hos omnes ludos a sanctissimis templis esse exterminandos, ac imprimis publicos histriones, qui cum turpi vita sint, religionem faedare potius sua ipsorum ignominia videntur; & assueti turpibus, in sanctissimis locis odorem, quo imbuti sunt, ore, oculis, & toto corpore exhalant : ac nescio an aliquando fabulam agant, quin verba turpia, vel imprudentibus saepe excidant: & hos tamen contendemus divinis celebritatibus adhibere ? Sed fac, ( quod nunquam accidisse probabis ) histriones severa aliqua lege constrictos, intra modesti ae sines contineri posse, ac sacras tantum historias cum dignitate referre; contend[illeg.], non minus eum morem cum religionis sanctitate pugnare, neque minus dedecus reipub afferre: Qu i enim conveniat ab hominibus turpibus Divorum res gestas referri, eosque Francisci, Dominici, Magdalenae, Apostolorum, ipsius etiam Christi personas repr aesentare? An non id sit Caelum terrae, aut caeno potius, sacra profanis miscere? Imagines in templis magna honestate depingi cavetur, & impudicam faeminam Mariae aut Catharinae, probosum hominem Augustini, aut Antonij personam sustinere patiamur? Quod Arnobius certe,  & antiquior Tertullianus ab antiquis factitatum accusant: ignominiosos homines in scenam sanctissimorum Deorum personas inducere. Nonne violatur Majestas. (Tertullianus ait)  & divinitas constupratur, laudantibus vobis ? Qu ae verba ad nostros mores transferas licet, atq; in antiquis interpreteris, nostrorum licentiam & turpitudinem accusari. Itaque si duorum optio danda esset, mallem ab histrionibus profanas fabulas agi, quam sacras historias: quoniam cum decore & honestate eos facere non posse persuasum plane habeo, tum ob eorum vilitatem & dedecus, tum ab faedissimos mores, paremque actionum levitatem & turpitudinem. Et ipse cogitabam in templis festisque Divorum omnia ad pietatem & modestiam comparanda esse, quibus rebus animus excitatur ad religionem & ad rerum divinarum contemplationem, ijsque communiter & privatim vacandum esse. Risus, plausus, clamores an id praestent, per se quisque considerabit . Sequitur pravitas alia, neq; minor superiori, neque minus devitanda. Mulieres excellenti pulchritudine, eximia actionum venustate  & gratia inducuntur in Theatrum, quod maximum est incitamentum libidinis & ad corrumpendos homines potissimum valet. Deus enim (uti Basilius ait libro de virginitate) cum conderet animantes in utrumque sexum distinctas, aestrum mutuae cupiditatis inseruit, inter homines maxime, qua se invicem appeterent, majorem multo in viro, quoniam faeminam de ejus latere formatam diligit ut proprium membrum, & ad eam toto impetu rapitur. Sic f aemina in se quandam virtutem habet, miramque potestatem trahendi ad se virum, non secus ac Magnes, cum ipse non moveatur, ferrum ad se rapit . Contra hanc potissimum cupiditatem pugnare debent, quicunq; pudicitiae dignitatem consequi student, nunquam interrupto usq; ad vitae finem certamine: Quod an ij faciant, qui tanto studio ad Theatra concurrunt, pius & modestus lector secum ipse consideret . Enim vero cum histriones studia omnia lucro metiantur, ut multitudinem alliciant, quam non ignorant aspectu mulierum, & auditu maxime capi, omnes fraudes suscipiunt, nulla honestatis cura: usque eo ut in templa etiam turpes has mulierculas inducant : quod his Annis non semel factitatum est, neque uno loco in Hispania, quod horrescunt audire aures; de quibus rebus egerint pudet, pigetq; dicere. Et Principum munus est resistere levitati multitudinis, & perditorum hominum temeritati . Non ignoramus antiquis temporibus mulieres in scenas fuisse invectas, quas insigni impudentia corpora etiam nudasse, omnemq; aetatem objecta specie libidinis expugnasse passim atq; corrupisse, sua quoq; aetate Chrysostomus multis locis accusat. Nudas quidem in nostra Theatra mulieres prodire non arbitror, tamet si nonnunquam in ipsa actione nudari audiebam , certe tenuissimis vestibus indutas prodire, quibus membra omnia figurantur, ac ferme subijcuntur oculis. Mulieris autem aspectu pulchr ae & ornatae, preterea gestus & verba in molliciem fracta adjungentis, quid potentius esse possit ad illiciendas animas, atque in sempiternam mortem impellendas, inflammandasque libidine, ego sane non video: vincit officium lingu ae periculi magnitudo : eo amplius quod haec etiam turpitudo suos patronos habet, non quosuis de populo, sed viros eruditionis & modestiae opinione praestantes. Aiunt enim aut comaedias in universum abdicandas, aut mulieres inducendas in Theatrum, quod majus periculum immineat si pueri substituantur in veste muliebri & ornatu, quo aspectu ad praeposteram & nefariam libidinem populus solicitetur . Nimirum velamen malitiae quaerunt: aliud agunt, aliud agere videri volunt. Hispanorum nationi suspicio criminis imponitur, a quo natura abhorret, (paucos excipio) & nos in provincijs quibus id malum viget, scimus saepe pueros in scenam prodijsse sine periculo; variasq; personas ut res se dabat cum dignitate, eligantiaque actitasse. Cupiditas autem muliebris sexus latius patet, majoresque multo impetus habet, non solum in corruptissimis hominibus & pravis, quales sunt qui puerorum amoribus indulgent, sed in alijs etiam viris, aliqua probitatis & modestiae laude conspicuis. Mitto quod f aeminae scenicae, quae histriones consectantur & adjuvant, forma sunt venali, sive quod tot viris procacibus & otiosis circumseptae , miraculi instar esset, si pudice viverent: & ex turpi questuplerumque raptae, posito amplius in Theatro pudore ad ingenium redeunt. Ita vulgato inter plures corpore omnibus exitium afferunt, juvenes otiosi & perditi (quorum magnus numerus ubique est) eo aspectu concitati feruntur precipites: unde rixae graves, vulnera, & cedes, contemptus parentum & rei familiaris prae amore earum muliercularum. Quae probra, & similia multa alia, qui digna non putat quae omni studio avertantur, ferreus sit & communi hominum caeterorum sensu rationeque destitutus. Censeo praeterea nullam certam sedem histrionibus extruendam publice, domum aut Theatrum, quam lucri parte locatam unde inopes alantur, aut quod in alias publicas utilitates impendatur; ea enim species obtenditur ab ijs qui contra statuunt. Primum enim facto Theatro occasio manifesta pr aebetur honesta conditione viris & faeminis inter selibere conveniendi, praesertim domus, aut Theatri magistro venali: nam qui emit magno, vendat necesse est omnem licentiam, quae ab illo flagitare homines perditi poterunt: fietque ex Theatro lupanar multo exitialius quam alia: deinde frequentiores ludi erunt perpetua sede publice designata, quam omnino sit opus. Alliciet loci opportunitas ad ludendum & spectandum, & praefectus cum magno eam sedem conduxerit histriones undique conquiret, nullumque diem elabi sine ludo patietur; quin potius diebus noctes continuabit, quanta cum perturbatione reipublicae dicere non est necesse. Quis enim juvenes avellat ab ea vanitate? Opifiees & agrestesrelicto opere quotidiano concurrent, famuli heroscontemnent, faeminae viros & familiam, prae cupiditate spectandi: quod scimus boc etiam tempore ex parte contingere . Praeterea histrionum numerus extructo certe Theatro per urbes & oppida, immensum augebitur pondus iners atque inutile, cum sint enervati voluptatibus; nam & lucri aviditas multos excitabit, neque nisi magno numero poterunt tam multis Theatris satisfacere. Postremo, num juvenes ex his privilegys & baschanalibus, aut strenuos milites, aut bonos senatores fore credimus? discent illi quidem ea inspectione amare, armorum pondus, alias molestias sustivere non poterunt: cum totos dies residere in Theatris consueverint: quo tempore aut aequos calcaribus incitare & flectere potuissent, aut alia ratione vires corporis exercere, aut certe pacis artes commentari . Scimus Romae primum ex lapide Theatrum a Gneio Pompeio fuisse extructum, nam antea scena ad tempus ex materia facta utebantur, tanta ex eo opere populi gratia, ut magni cognomen ex ea fabrica accesserit. Id fuit multitudinis judicium, qua pale ae instar levissimae in omnes partes circumfertur: nam prudentiorum magnae partis repraehensionem incurrit, unde laudem captabat. Sic docet Tacitus libro quartodecimo, productis etiam in utramque partem probandi  & improbandi Theatra argumentis: ut quod in ea temporum f aece & morum labe dubitatum est, nobis pro certo lege esse debeat, nequaquam populi Christiani moribus & sanctitati convenire, ut per urbes & oppida, certa, perpetuaque sedes histrionibus detur. Scimus saepe a Censoribus Romae eversa Theatra nihilominus, quasi morum certissimam a lascivia labem: & erit in populo Christiano, hac professione, qui restituenda contendat? Ad haec: Suscepta Christi veligione per omnes pene Civitates cadunt Theatra , uti Augustinus ait, cave ae turpitudinum & publicae professiones flagitiosoru, & nos ea instauranda contendamus? Vincit rei dignitas orationis facultatem. Neque excuses, nostra Theatra non esse conferenda cum antiquis, neque majestate operis, neque ludorum apparatu. Turpitudinem loci accusamus, non structurae modum; rivus tenuis, naturam continet fontis unde manat; surculus arboris unde excisus est, succum habet. Nam si magno vectigali, sublato Theatro rempub. privari accuses, risum tenere non potero, neque enim tanti lucrum esse debet, ut mores populi & religio negligantur ; neque deerunt aliunde rationes, si Theatra repudiemus, ad egenorum inopiam sublevandam. Et mihi qui secus statuunt, magni Pompeij factum imitari velle videntur. Is enim ut reprehensionem evaderet quasi Theatro constituto turpitudinis scholam apperuisset, Veneris Templo Theatrum quasi appendicem adjunxit, religionis sanctitate novam structuram velaturus, nimirum verebatur ne aliquando memori ae suae censoria ignominia accederet, quasi arcem omnium turpitudinum struxisset ; uti Tertullianus ait: Ergo Pompeij imitatione cum templis, aut hospitijs pauperum theatrum jungatur, quo majus lucrum sit, honestius suscept ae improbitatis velamen. Censeo ergo cum multis, fore e republica, si histriones pretio venales penitus removeantur. Omnes enim pecuniae vias norunt, & pecuniae causa omnes turpitudines suscipiunt, instillantque alijs; questuaria arte exhauriunt pecunias, & veluti sopitis voluptate sensibus latenter extorquent, quas non minori turpitudine insumant, otio & desidia ut torpeant Cives efficiunt, quae omnium vitiorum radix est, vitijs omnibus & fraudibus viam muniunt, libidine maxime, quae auribus & oculis suscipitur. Divinum Cultum minuunt diebus festis, cum vacandum esset rebus divinis, populo ad spectacula attracto, quae pestis omnibus piaculis procuranda videbatur . Quod si non obtinemus, ut ludi scenici penitus amoveantur, & placet nihilominus eam oblectationem populis dare: quod jus & aequitas postulare videtur, impetrare certe cupimus, ut delectus aliquis sit, neque promiscue licentia quidvis agendi histrionibus concedatur: sed legibus certis circumscribantur & finibus, quos nemo impune transgrediatur. Tamet si nullis legibus putabam furorem hunc satis frenari : prudenter quidam O here , inquit, qu ae res nec modum habet neque Consilium, ratione, modoque tractari non vult . Sequamur tamen Platonis institutum, qui poetarum Carminibus examinandis pr aefici sanxit viros prudentes non minores quinquaginta annis: eorum judicio quaecunque agendae erunt fabulae examinentur, ipsi etiam intermedij actus quibus major turpitudo inesse solet; mulieres in Theatra inducere nefas esto: Theatrum nusquam publice constituatur. Diebus festis (uti antiquis legibus sancitum meminimus) ludi scenici ne exhibeantur, ne temporibus quidem jejunij Christiani: quid enim commercij squalori cum Theatri risu, plausuque. A templis & sanctorum qui cum Christo in Caelo regnant, ac omnino divinis celebritatibus amoveantur: ac praesertim ij modi & gestus, quibus turpitudo in memoriam revocatur, & ferme oculis subijcitar, quae sunt vulnera religionis nostrae probra, monstraque immania : Hispanorum nationis dedecora, adeo faeda, ut stilus contrectare vereatur, suoque se faetore tueri hoc genus mali videatur. Postremo, quo ad fieri poterit minori aetate pueri & puellae arceantur ab ijs spectaculis, ne a teneris reipublicae Saeminarium vitijs inficiatur, quae gravissima pestis est . Adsint inspectores publice designati, viri pij & prudentes quibus cura sit ut turpitudo omnis amoveatur, & potestas coercendi paena si quis se petulanter gesserit. Denique, populus intelligat, histriones non probari a republica, sed populi oblectationi atque importunis precibus dati : quae cum non potest quae sunt meliora obtinere, solet aliquando minora mala tolerare, & populi levitati aliquid concedere. What could any Puritan or Precisian (as the world now stiles all such who run not with them into the same excesse of riot and prophanesse ) write more against Stage-playes, Play-houses, Players, Play- haunters; or what have I said more against them in this Treatise, then this great Iesuit hath done, and that by publike approbation both of his Royall Soveraigne, his Visitor and Superior too? And must not Stage-playes then be extremely bad when as pofessed Iesuits so severely censure them? yea, shall not Protestants, nay Papists to, be unexcusably licentious, if they should be more moderate or indulgent unto Playes, then they? Let no Player, or Play- haunter, no voluptuous libertine therefore henceforth quarrel either with me or others, as being too puritanically rigid against Stage-playes, when as these loose Iesuits equalize, if not exceed us in their Play-condemning Censures, as this large transcribed passage fully proves. Yee therefore, beloved Readers, seeing yee now know these things before hand, beware lest ye also being led away to Playes, to Theaters, with the error, the example, the importunate sollicitations of the wicked (as many ignorant and unstable nominall Christians have beene before you;) fall from your owne stedfastnesse , faith and Christian vertues, into a sinke of hellish vices, to your eternall ruine. Now the God of peace that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus, that great Shepheard of the Sheepe, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good worke to doe his will; working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. Quisquis contempto Deo sequeris mundum, & ipse te deserit mundus. Sequere adhuc quantu potes fugitivum, & si potes[illeg.] apprehendere eum, tene eum: sed video non potes, fallis te. Ille n.labiles motus suos torrentis ictu percurrens, dum te videt inhaerentem sibi, & tenentem se, ad hoc te rapit, nonut salvet, sed ut perdat te. Quid n. cu pompis Diaboli amator Christi? Noli te fallere, odit n. tales Deus, nec inter suos deputat professores, quos cernit viae suae desertores. Ecce ruinosus est mundus, ecce tantis calamitatibus replevit Dominus mundum, ecce amarus est mundus & sic amatur, quid faceremus si dulcis esset? O munde immunde! teneri vis periens, quid faceres si maneres? Quem non deciperes dulcis si amarus alimenta mentiris? Vultis dilectissimi non inhaerere mundo, eligite amare creatorom mundi, & renunciate pompis mundanis, quibus Princeps est Diabolus cum Angelis suis. FINIS.
