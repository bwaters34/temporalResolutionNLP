 the welfare of his Subiects, and being carefull they might not lacke one in his absence to administer Iustice unto them, thought good to signifie his Royall Will and Pleasure, which was that all Birds; of what name, colour, or degree soever, should repaire unto the Wood, called Sylvia ; and that there be purposed to chuse one amongst them to rule the rest; who could declare himselfe to be most worthy in merit and desert. This Proclamation being written and subscribed with Aquila Rex avium , which is in English , The sooner made knowne through all thickets, hedges, and bushie fields where Birds doe resort, but that presently their hearts were inflamed with ambition. every one desiring to prove himselfe worthy of the Uice-regency or government, during the retiring of the King. So that in a short time there were come unto the Court of Sylvia. Rubert the Robin, Mavis the Magpie, Phillip the Sparrow , the Blackbird, Starling , and Iackdaw , with Philomel the Nightingall, Tom Titmouse, Parvis the Wren, Spincke the Finch, Columber the Dove , and Maybird the Cuckoo , with many others which came with prepared speeches to make knowne their owne worth. But now the Eagle having seated himselfe on a high Cedar tree, began to looke downe upon the Assembly of Birds, who sate upon the lower boughes round about him, and by the piercing quicknesse of his eye, hee soone perceived that his cosen Rapax the Hawke , who was somewhat a kin unto him, and Cawwood the Rooke were onely absent. So that before he would make knowne his minde unto them, he sent Flywill the Buzzard for his cosen Rapax the Hawke , and Cawwood the Rooke ; and withall fearing that the Hawke kept out of the way, because he had committed many outrages, upon the smaller birds, hee sent him a free pardon for all his former offences, bidding Flywill to command him to come away with all speede. deserveth honour and preferment, as may appeare by the Wren and the small Birds, who all resorted to the Court upon the Eagles Proclamation, to make the worthiest Vice-regent in his absence. The Hawke and the Rooke keeping away from Court, doth shew that a guilty conscience, is a selfe accuser, and maketh men afraid to come in sight, especially at any publike Meeting. How Flywill the Buzzard carried a Pardon to Rapax the Hawke , and how the Hawke and the Rooke requited him for his paines. No sooner had Flywill the Buzzard tide the Pardon with a string round about his necke, but straight hee tooke wing, and flew away to a Wood some three miles of, to which he knew the Hawke and the Rooke did use to resort, and there accordingly he soone meete with them, and delivered the Pardon to the Hawke , telling him that the King out of his free mercy, had sent him a Pardon for all his former bloody facts, wishing him to obey the former Proclamation, and to make all hast that could be to come unto the Court. The Hawke tooke the Pardon, and having reade it, he gave Flywill the Buzard many thankes, for that he being so short of wing, had tooke the paines to bring him these good tidings and so walking aside with Cawwood the Rooke , as if they had consented about going to the Court; the Hawke told the Rooke that this Buzard , (albeit he was a kin unto him, was a shame and disgrace unto all Hawkes , being a Coward, and not daring to cease on any thing but dead Carrion, or some scattered guts, or to take childrens bread and butter out of their hands, all which doe shew the basenesse of his breeding, and that he never came out of the true Nest or Airy of the Hawkes ; and therefore friend Rooke , seeing thou hast beene accounted a cunning Politition in thy dayes, I would intreate thee to instruct me in some devise how we might make him a way, and yet have no hand in the matter. The Rooke scratching his head with one of his clawes stood still a while, till at last turning to the Hawke , he told him, that there was a new invention come into his braine how to make away the Buzard , and set him going with a powder. After this they returned againe unto Flywill the Buzard , who never suspected what they had contriv'd against him, but complained unto them that he had gotten a great cold in his head, by flying so farre in a rainy day, hee being onely us'd to haunt Warrens, and there to flie from one old tree to another, and so passe away the time. But no sooner had the Rooke heard him say that he had gotten a cold, but hee presently tooke hold of the occasion, telling him that there was no better medicine for a cold than warmth; and therefore if he would but tie his head about with a cloath, he should finde that the rhume would presently void it selfe, and runne out of his beake in a great abundance. The Buzard being full of paine with the headach. consented thereunto, so that the Rooke very carefully and cunningly tyed a clout round about his head, and so bid him flie to the next tree. The foolish Buzard thinking hee could finde out the way for all he was blindfolded, tooke wing, and flew directly against the body of a great Oke, which beate him backe so violently, that he came fluttering through the boughes, till at last he caught hold on one of them with his talents, and so having pearch'd himselfe, he learned Phisitions did come unto him; but they flew unto an other tree from whence they might behold the Buzard sitting very demurely by himselfe. But hee had not sat there long, when it hapned that one came by with a birding peece, and perceiving so faire a marke, went towards him, and taking his aime gave fire, and shot the Buzzard that he came tumbling down starke dead. Which when the Rooke  & the Hawke perceived, they flew away toward the Court; the Hawke being very glad that his Cosen Buzzard was brought to this end, and so giving the Rooke many thankes for inventing this devise which had so luckily tooke effect, they both flew together to the Court. upon them, as may appeare by the Buzard, who sate blindfolded in the tree, till the Fowler came by and shot him. The Hawke bringing his Cosen Buzzard to an untimely death; and sheweth that the rich doe despise their poore kindred, and so doe expose them to danger. How Rapax the Hawke, and Cawwood the Rooke came to the Court, and how the Eagle declared unto the Birds the reason why he called them together. The Eagle being, as before mounted upon a Cedar, all the Birds in a circle sat round about him, making such a charme of severall notes, tunes, and ditties, that if you had heard them, you would have sworne you had never heard the like. As they were thus sitting together, in came the Hawke and the Rooke with nimble wing, and tooke their place amongst the other Birds. And so the Hawke having made obeysance to the King, began in an eloquent speech, to amplifie the Kings mercy, who had not onely granted him a free pardon for all his former bloody offences, but also safe protection to come unto that place. But the Eagle cut him off in his speech, saying, Cosen, I hope my mercy shall finde that reward which I expect, which is, that you will amend your life, for that is the best way to give me thankes, and satisfie the whole Common wealth of Birds, who else, though they dare not speake yet openly, yet in their hearts they will condemne me of iniustice, for remitting the bloody murders, and slaughters of my Subiects which you have dayly committed. But I have other matters to declare unto you, & therefore I would have you give attention, and so with his Scepter (which he held in one of his talents) making a signe unto them for silence. He began his Roiall speech in this manner. My loving Subiects, it behoveth a King to be carefull of his Subiects, even from the highest to the lowest; I therefore doe here professe, that all my Subiects are equally deare unto me, so that my Cosin the Hawke is not more deare unto me than the little Wren . It behoveth me therefore that as I have made knowne my purpose unto you by my Proclamation, which is, to leave my Court of Sylvia , and flye into the solitary Desarts of Arabia ; so it is necessary for the establishing of peace and quiet in my absence, that I leave one to rule and governe over you; and to this end I have called you to this Assembly, that whatsoever Bird among you can prove himselfe to be the worthiest, either by parentage, merit, or desert, or any other way, him I will make King in my absence. Therefore let every one speake boldly in the behalfe of themselves, and orge what reasons they can in their owne practise. The Birds hearing this began to clappe their wings, aod with chirping and chattering gave a great applause to the Eagles speech. Magistrate, he cannot shew more Thankefulnesse than by amending his life; for so the Kingly Eagle told his cosin Rapax the Hawke. Kings ought to take care of their Subjects in their absence, as appeareth by the Eagles speech to the Commonalty of Birds, whose rejoycing thereat, does shew how acceptable the gracious Speech of a King is to his loving subjects. How Parvis the Wren made a speech unto the Eagle . The Wren all this while sate upon thornes, though indeede she were now upon a higher tree than ever she was in her life before, being alwayes wont to creepe and peepe in the hedge bottome, and therefore it seemes that the hight of the tree had put high conceits into her head. So that perking up her selfe, and getting upon a small twigge, from whence shee might be seene of all the company, she began most earnestly to desire the Kingly Eagle to make her his substitute; for sayes she, though I am but a Wren , and of a small body, yet my heart is as bigge as the best; and for my wit and policy, you may see it in building my nest, and the workemanship thereof. And therefore though I am least of Birds, yet if you please, I thinke my selfe worthy to beare the greatest authority among Birds. The Wren would still have gone on, being all heart and tongue; but that the Eagle commanded Rubert the Robin to speake next. is seene by the Wren preferring her selfe before all other Birds, and the reason is because those that have the least worth, have the greatest opinion of themselves. How Rubert the Robin spake to the Eagle. My Lord the Eagle , I hope Rubert the Robin is not unknowne unto you, whom men, women, and children, doe love, honour, and respect; no Peece is discharged against me, no snare set for me, so that I flye with safetie into houses, butteries, and cellers, because no man will hurt a Robin . The reason why I am beloved is for my courtesie and familiarity towards men, for if I finde a dead body in the Wood, I and the rest of my fellowes doe bury it with Mosse and Leaves, and for this I am called the Sexton of the Wood: Besides, I sing in Winter, neither can the coldest frosts put me downe, when all the other Birds like cowards creepe into bushes. I therefore having the better heart, and being generally beloved, doe know no reason why I may not governe the Common wealth of Birds in your roiall absence. as appeares by the speech of Rubert the Robin, who urges it as a praise unto himselfe, to be beloved of men. The Owles Speech. The Owle being not in those times afraid of the other Birds, but esteemed as a grave Counseller, began to speake next; but with such a hollow voice, as no man could understand him, yet some of his words were to this purpose. May it please your roiall Eagleship, the Owle was beloved of Pallas , and the Lacedemonians did coyne their money with the stampe and picture of an Owle, so much did the Lacedemonians love me. But the Birds hearing the Owle speake of the Lacedemonians , they fell all into a confused chirping or laughter, so that the Owle without taking any leave flew away, and ever since that time hath hid his head in an old Ivytree, being ashamed of day light, and shunning the company of the other Birds. them prove rediculous, as appeares by the Owle, who was laught at for his learned speech of the Lacedemonians . The Speech of Philomel the Nightingall. After the Owle was laughed out of countenance. The Nightingall began to delight their eares with her sweete harmonious voyce; and no sooner had she framed her selfe to speake, but the Birds were ready to give attendance to her speech; which was in this manner. Most royall Soveraigne, if I should declare my sorrowes which I record by night, making the Thorne my Song-booke, I know it would move you to compassionate my uniust ravishment; for know, that I was daughter to a King, and ravished by my Sister Prognes husband, called Tereneus , and afterward by some strange power, we were all changed into Birds; Tereneus into a Lapwing , my Sister Progne into a Swallow , and I Philomel into a Nightingall who still in lamentable tunes, setting my brest against a thorne, doe warble forth my owne griefe. And seing every bird hath free liberty to praise her selfe, I may boldly say, that I am the honour of the Woods, the darling of the Spring, the Lovers joy; for young men and maides will walke out together to heare my notes, and if they heare me before May- bird the Cuckoo , they are in good hope they shall enjoy their sweete hearts that yeere. I am called Philomel for my melodious straines, my body is little, my voyce is loud, so that one said of me, Vox es praeterea nihil : That I was onely a voyce and nothing else . If therefore my great birth, my former wrongs, or pleasant tunes have any power to declare my merit, I hope the Crowne and Scepter may be worthily resigned unto me, having beene sometime a Kings Daughter, and therefore fit to be made Queene of the Woods. story of her ravishment, and by the Birds giving so diligent attention, unto her, is shewed that a well delivered speech hath a great power over the mind and affections. The Cuckooes Speech. Maybird the Cuckoo having heard the sweete speech which Philomel had made, thinking he could have made as good himselfe, for yet he had not suckt so many egges to make him hoarse, and therefore getting upon a bared bough, he began to wipe his beake, and rubbe it upon the tree, afterwards he fluttered his wings, and at last, fetching his breath as if he meant to make a long speech. he began in this manner. Great King, I am the Cuckoo, Cuckoo, Cuckoo , & so he could goe no further, but still cried Cuckoo, Cuckoo , whereat all the other Birds laugh'd, and the Cuckoo was much dismaide, and since then hee will never be seene of the Birds but only in May , and for that reason he is called the Maybird . those whose braines seeme to be in labour with a Mountaine, doe at last bring forth a Mouse, as may be perceived by Maybird the Cuckoo, who made them beleeve that she had great matters to speake, and at last could say nothing but Cuckoo, Cuckoo, and so was laugh'd at for her paines. The Speech of Corvino the Crow. When the Cuckoo had ended with shame, as she began with great ostentation. Then Corvino the Crow stood up, and told them he was a great Astrologer, having knowledge in the influence of the starres, the shiftings of the windes, the change of the weather, all which he made knowne unto men by voyce, so that the Shepherds are wont to say, When the Crow doth cry amaine, Then you may be sure of raine. Besides, my craft and cunning it is such, that I am seldome ensnar'd & brought to ruine, and therefore I ought for my policy to be prefer'd If a horse chance to die, I am presently upon his bones, or if a Lambe or Sheepe be weake, I picke out his eyes, and afterward doe flye to some tree and from thence doe heare how the Shepheards curse me, but yet for all that I thrive the better. If therefore Policy or Knowledge in affaires may enable one for publike government, you may make me your Substitute, and deliver the Crowne unto the Crow , for to him it belongeth, if desert may beare it away. Arts, so that Every Art hath some ignorant fellowes, who will pretend to have skill therein, as Mountibankes will needes be Physitions, and fellowes with a little Lattine will needes be Schollers, as the Crow, because he cries sometimes before raine, would therefore needes be an Astrologer. The Speech of Mavis the Magpie. The Magpie after this began to chatter out her minde, saying he was once a King, and so was changed into a Pye , and therefore he might now againe be changed from a Pye into a King. Besides, saith he, I have beene alwayes esteemed as a Poet, for I can make Uerses, and chatter them out so fast that you would wonder at it, and I can tell you the Commonwealth of birds have much delighted in my Songs and Ditties, being excellent Rhyme with some reason, and therefore I thinke they have reason to applaud me: and for proofe of my skill you shall heare some of my Uerses. Although I am no Iackedaw, Nor house Crow that crieth Caw, Yet I am a Magpie, That can make sweete melody, And sing so in my mother tongue, That all birds shall admire my song. And no sooner had he spoke these Uerses, but the Magpie seeing the birds laugh at him, he swore they were very good lines, and that they had no more wit then Woodcocks , or else they would have prais'd them. will deliver the Morrall to two Verses, out of Persius the Poet, entreating of the same matter.  Corvos Poetas, & poetrias picas, Cantare credas, Pegascium melos. Crow Poets, and Poeticke Pies. Doe thinke they make sweete Melodies. The Speech of Anser the Goose. After this Anser the Goose , and Coby the Cocke , having by chance heard the Proclamation as they were standing under a hedge, they came flying thither, but being not able to light upon a tree, the Goose and the Cocke stood at the bottome of the tree; which when the Eagle perceived, he came downe to them, and all the birds sate round about upon the ground. Then the Goose began to speake in this manner. Albeit I am esteemed a cowardly bird, because when I goe under a barne dore I stoope downe my head, yet I can speake much in my owne behalfe: for to begin with former times, I, onely my gagling voyce sav'd the Capitoll of Rome , from being taken by the enemy, as I know your Eagleshippe hath read in histories; besides, if I come unto these times, how could the Lawyeres Clarke or Scrivener make the poore countrimen pay for their Law, unlesse I lent them quills to write their bills and bonds. So that I thinke the Graygoose wing maybe as much feared now, as in the old time when they headed their arrowes with my feathers, for then many times they lost lives, and now their lands, while the sheepe affoords the parchment, and I afford the pen, with which the Prodigall sets his hand to the seale, or Morgage of his whole Patrimony. Besides, I have a great many two legg'd kindred in the world, who yet scorne to acknwledge me, but the world knowes them to be Geese And therefore considering how necessary I am, I hope you will give me preheminence above the other birds: After him the Cocke spake as followeth. Coby the Cocks speech. I am Coby the Cocke , or the bird of Mars , I fight single combats, and from the Cockpit I beare away the bloody victory: I am the Country Clocke, and tell the Maides when tis time to rise, I call up the labourer to his worke. and proclaime day-light over the whole world. I am loving to my hens, respected of my Dame that keepes me, and fed with the best barley she can get, and in requitall I tread her hens lustily, and make them lay egges. To conclude, I am come of a generous kinde, being the true Embleme of valour, and so necessary that the world could not tell how to doe for Egges at shrovetide if the Cocke should faile. And therefore if the matter might be decided by voyces, I know the Country wives would desire to have me made King, for they doe all love a good treading Cocke . The Iackdawes Speech. Though I am last to take boldnesse to speake, yet I hope you will consider that I am an excellent Linguist, and have the knowledge of many Languages, so that when we Iackdawes are got together about a steeple, we make a chattering noise like so many Welchmen. Besides, I have some rich treasure which lies hid in the crowne of a tree, as namely, beades, tagges of points, pewter spoones, and divers other things, which I meant to present unto your Eagleship, for it is my nature to hide whatsoever I finde. Besides, for my Language (as I said before) I can speake Latin, Greeke, Hebrew, French, Italian as easily as my mother tongue, but indeede few can understand me, and therefore I doe lose that praise which I deserve. However, I hope you will consider my worthinesse, and place me as your substitute, during the time that your Eagleship shall be absent in the Desart of Arabia . And so ends Iackdaw , praying for your long life, and to give you a taste of my Languages. Levat le Roy ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  foelicissimum . How the Eagle having heard the Birds severall speeches did make a Speech to them againe, and at last made his Cosen Rapax the Hawke Viceregent in his absence. The Eagle like a wise King having all this while colected the chiefe matter of their speeches, he began to speake unto them in this manner. My loving Subiects, I have heard what you have spoken in the behalfe of your selves. You Robert have pleaded well for your selfe, and so have you Lady Philomel , and all the rest, whose names for brevity sake I omit. But yet you have not shewed me any vertues worthy of royall dignitie. For in that Philomel was a Kings daughter, and Mavis the Pye was sometime a King, yet these are but the fictions of Poets, and I had rather have you make it appeare that your brests are filled with Iustice, Temperance, Magnanimitie, Mercy, and such other Uertues, which are required in a King. For to boast of Parentage, or gifts of Nature, as your faire white feathers, or of Art, as Languages, Learning, and the like, they may be esteemed ornaments to private men: but Princes should have Power to make them fear'd, and Uertue to make them be beloved, but in none of you I finde these qualities: and therefore since you have all spoken your mindes, I would faire know why my Cosen Rapax the Hawke hath sate mute all this while. The Hawke hearing himselfe named by the Eagle , answered thus. May it please your highnesse. I know that my former offences, and bloody murthers are so odious and hatefull in the sight of the birds, that I dare not open my beake to pronounce a syllable in my owne behalfe. But yet might it please them to remit and forgive my former offences, and pardon what is past, I would promise (if so be your Maiesty should make me your Substitute) to rule over the Commonwealth of Birds, with Iustice, temperance, and equitie, insteed of killing and slaying them with my Talents, I would protect them from the inuiry of Owles and other bloud suckers, who in the Winter evenings doe pull the small birds out of the bushes, and so prey upon them Then they should spend their dayes peaceably, sleepe securely, sing sweetly, feede plentifully, and live merrily. And besides, as I have power to sway the Empire, so I promise to rule over the Commonwealth of Birds, with Iustice and equitie, and to give them the better assurance that I will not prove a Tyrant, I am willing to have my Talents pared off. Therefore if the birds doe like of my offer, to shew their consent thereunto let them clappe their wings. Which was no sooner heard, but the Birds on condition that the Hawkes talents should be pared off, they all cryed with one voyce: Fuit Rex Rapax . Let the Hawke be King . as may be seene by the Hawkes speech, who promising to ride with Iustice amongst them, got so farre into the opinion of the birds, that they were content to chuse him King, to avoid farther strife amongst themselves. Take heede therefore of faire speeches, for all their words are mingled with dissimulation. How Rapax the Hawke had his talents pared off, and how the Eagle had resigned his Scepter unto him, and made him King of the Birds. After the birds had consented to the Hawkes speech. The Hawke , because they had no edge tooles amongst them, put his talents into the clift of a tree, and so never left pulling, till hee had pulled them quite off, and yet the hope of Soveraignety was so sweete unto him that he felt no paine therein Being thus unable to hurt The Eagle rose out of his seate, and caused the Hawke to sit therein, and afterward delivered his Scepter unto him, and put his Crowne upon his head, and then charged him to remember his promise, which was, to have a care of his subiects, and be loving unto them; as also to heare their complaints, to redresse their greevances, and to yeeld them releefe. And this see you performe, as you tender or respect your owne life; for if at my returne from the Arabian Desart, I finde that you have wrong'd my Subiects, you shall be sure to die for it. The Hawke answered, that he hoped his Maiestie should commend him at his returne, and not finde any iust cause of punishment, for though I have beene heretofore counted cruell, and have plumed upon the Carkasse of many a small bird, as Larkes, and Sparrowes, and sometimes upon Doves, Partridges, Quailes, & the like, yet now your subiects shall finde me full of mercy, for indeede I was then enforced to be cruell by necessity. At these words the Eagle tooke wing, so taking some few birds of note with him, he flew away, and when these birds had accompanied him some part of the way, he sent them backe againe, charging them to be carefull to obey the Hawke in all things. And so flew on to the Desart of Arabia . sufficient reward for all his sufferings, as may appeare by the Hawke, who could endure to plucke off his owne Talents, in hope to be made King. How the Hawke behaved himselfe after the departure of the Eagle, and how he requited Cawwood the Rooke for teaching him to make away the Buzzard, as is shewed in the first Chapter. The Eagle being gone, the Hawke behaved himselfe very lovingly for the first weeke; as Nero , the first five yeares of his raigne was counted the best of Kings, but afterward he proved the worst of Tyrants: so the Hawke dissembled his nature for a weeke or fortnight, but afterward he had a great desire to shed blood, and therefore he began to thinke how he might put Cawwood the Rooke to death, and requite him for his former kindnesse in betraying the Buzzard , and making him stand blinde folded with a clout about his head, till one came by and shot him with a birding-peece. Now to bring this to passe, he called many of the little birds together, and told them, that what cruelty he had formerly committed, was by the encouragement of the Rooke , who made him beleeve, that seing nature had allotted him no other foode, it was lawfull for him to prey upon all sorts of birds, and that now he was afraid least he should put into his mind, the same bloody principles againe, and therefore to avoid suspition. My loving Subiects saith he, if any of you can accuse him of any hainous crime, (as I know he is guilty of many) I will grant you a day of hearing against him, that so, if he cannot cleere himselfe, he may suffer the punishment of death, which is due unto his desarts: no sooner had the Hawke spoken these words, but presently they told his Maiestie, that they had every one cause to complaine against him, and therefore if he were once summoned to the Court- they would be all ready to accuse him. their owne purpose is effected, as may appeare by the Hawke, who sought the life of the Rooke, after he had us'd his invention to make away the Buzzard. So that he which furthers a mans vice, is belov'd while it is doing, but is hated when tis done. How Cawwood the Rooke was called to the Court to answer for himselfe, and how all the small birds brought in their accusations against him. The Hawke began now to make knowne his blooddy nature, and therefore sent Corvino the Crow to summon the Rooke to appeare at the Court of Sylvia , who accordingly came at the day appointed, not doubting to receive any iniury from the Hawke, being alwayes his friend, and therefore not fearing that now being made King, he would use his power to his destruction, but it proved far otherwise, for no sooner was Cawwood come unto the Hawkes presence but the Hawke commanded him to stand forth and answer to such matters as should be laid against him, for saies he, friend Rooke there are many complaints made against you, and I must doe iustice as I promised the Eagle at his departure. When the Rooke heard this, he began to change colour, and his feathers began to stand up on end, what thought he shall I be betrayd by a Traytor, yet at last seeing no remedy, he was faine to stand to it, while the Birds gathered round about him, beeing all ready to complaine against him; and first Rubert the Robert began his enditement. the Havvkes speech to Cawvvood the Rooke, who being affraid thereof, does shew that a guiltie conscience is a thousand witnesses. How Rubert the Robin complayned against Cawwood the Rooke. I am glad that we small Birds have now free liberty to shew our wrongs and greevances, which we have received from Cawwood the Rooke , who upon a time brought me in danger of my life, for one day as he and I were walking in a field by a hedge side, we chanced to come where there was a turfe set up with two stickes, and a little hole digged underneath it; I began to aske him what it was. O sayes hee doe you not know what this is, then you have lost many a faire worme, for it is never without one or two, and therefore (saies he) if you hop into the bottome of it, you shall finde my words true, but quoth I is there no danger in it? O no (sayes he) Ile warrant you for danger, whereupon I beleeving him, leapt upon the forked sticke, and no sooner was I lighted thereon, but presently the turfe fell upon my head, so that I was made close prisoner in the Pitfall, and there I continued, till at last a waggish boy, who had made the Pitfall came and tooke me out, and with great ioy carried me to his mother, but she telling him that it was ill lucke to hurt a Robin, at last the boy was content onely to cut of my tayle and let me flye, whereby I escaped the danger that the Rooke had brought me into, and therefore I desire that we may have iustice on him. The Sparrowes complaint. VVith the same malitious minde, though not in the same manner, Cawwood the Rooke brought me in danger and perill of my life. For one frosty morning there being a great many Limestrawes set on a dunghill, Cawwood the Rooke went amongst them and spying mee upon the top of a Barne, called me downe unto him, and bid me come to him, for there were a great many Wheate eares scattered on the ground, whereupon I being somewhat hungry, by reason of the could frosty weather came flying to him, and no sooner had I begun to pecke on one of the eares, but straight the end of one of the limed strawes caught me by the backe, and another under the wing, so that I had much adoe to get from thence, for when he that watcht the strawes saw me limed and taken, he came running out to catch me, but then with all the strength I had, I made towards a hedge, and having gotten into the bottome thereof escaped the fowlers hands. Thus I was betrayd by Cawwood the Rooke , and I thinke there is no Bird but hath some accusation against him. The Complaint of the Woodcocke. May it please you, I was once comming through a Wood with this Trayter Cawwood the Rooke , and as we went, there was two or three stickes set iust crosse the path, with one great bended sticke, whereon was a noose of haire. And as we came to them I asked the Rooke what this meant, why sayes he it is a swing, whereon I am wont many times to stretch my selfe, at these words like a Woodcocke as I was, I went to take hold of the great sticke, and thought to have swong upon it, but no sooner had I set my foote upon the Bridge but the Spring flew up, and caught me by one of the legges, so that there I lay vpright, and looking every houre when the Fowler would come to fetch me, and if the haire noose had not broken, I had certainly long ere this beene rosted, and served up to some rich mans Table. The Woodcocke had no sooner ended his complaint, but there came in a Thrush and a Starling like maymed Souldiers hopping upon one legge, and seeing Cawwood the Rooke standing at the barre. The Thrush, because she was the better speaker began to tell their case; how that Cawwood the Rooke made them beleeve that a Birding-peece was but a pipe which men used to play upon, whereupon one morning a Fowler comming towards us with a Peece, we thinking to heare his pipe sate still, so that he taking his ayme discharged against us, and shot me into the legge, and my brother Starling into the wing. Thus hath the Rooke with his craft deceived us many times, and many a bird hath hee brought to untimely end by his cunning. We beseech the Hawke therefore (who we heare is left substitute in the Eagles absence) that he would punish the cruelty of the Rooke . How Cawwood the Rooke, would have answered for himselfe, but that Rapax the Hawke would not suffer him, but condemned him to perpetuall banishment.
