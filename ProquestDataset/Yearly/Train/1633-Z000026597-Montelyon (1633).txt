 That even as for a man of understanding, being praysed to be led therby unto a selfe-loved opinion of his own laudable parts: or as selfe-willed presuming on his high deserts, may seeme an especiall argument of no small folly: so likewise for being discommended, to remaine even amort with heavie cheere, and drooping mind, figuring his sad lookes, like to the Anatomy of death, is a plain proofe of his scarcity of counsell, want of patience, (which Phylosophers hold the soveraign'st vertue that belongs to the qualified indument of mortality) and (which is worse penury of reason, Affectus temporare suos . I propose not this Gentle Reader, as if Stoycally I regarded your judicious censure, but rather portray a Preludium , how indifferently I can endure the divers taunting reports of the envious: as for your ever regarded judgements, I account it the sanctuary, wherein my tyred sconce may finde refuge, the chiefe gresse , onely whereby my feeble invention ascendeth; the Colosse that wholly supporteth my endeavors; yea I reckon it all my being, all my essence, all my good. As therefore with a favourable smile, you ere-while entertayned Parismus and Parismenos , my elder off-springs, with so cheerefull an aspect; now cast your lookes on my Montelyon , whose forwardnesse to winne fame, you shall perceive nothing inferiour to the promptnesse of the former, although by birth and course of time the yonger. Oh he can acquaint you with the wonders of Chivalry, with admirable acts and doubty deeds, supported alway with a Fayery suffrage, as was Vlysses in his ten yeares venture by the ayde of Pallas . Your well-willing acceptance, and kind conceit of him, is all the recompence I aske for my trauell, and I wish no more, so (I trust) you will no lesse, grant this, and make my endeavours prosperous: deny that, and leave mee so utterly infortunate, as hopelesse for ever of every good successe: ever found bountifull in giving the one; so my selfe will not rest ingratefull for the other: that both in one,  & one in both, may not only augment your longing pleasures, which I heartily wish, but also inrich my lasting content, which I hope you as courteously will. Your Well-wisher, Be swallowed of Obliuion: What Honour (whereon Vertue feeds) Remembred rests for Merites done? Whence shall proceed that sparke of Fame, That sets on fire the Noble-Heart, For Honour of his Birth and Name, In Valours Field to act his part? Had not great Alexander view'd The Blazons of Achilles praise, Whereat with enuious Eye, he rew'd The world, beyond him we should raise. Hee scarcely to Subdue had sought, The World vnder his Commaund: Nor had his Conquests Honour bought, According to his Mindes demaund.

How worthy prayse are Writers then; Whose workes shew to this vile-growne Age, The worthy liues of Valiant men, For Vertues Freedome layd in gage? Then well deserues he that reuiues The Age-worne records of Renowne; Contemning Enuie , that depriue's The well deseru'd of Lawrell Crowne. Thanke Foorde , thus offring at free cost, His Talent for our hearts delight, And reckons not his labour lost, If it (with kindnes) we requite. R. K. How Persicles was created King of Assyria , and travailed into Persia , to the Marriage of his Sister Piera , to the Emperours Sonne Deloratus . How he was enamoured of Constantia: and returned into Assyria . An ancient King named Pius , ruled the Land of Assyria in great peace: as well Fortunate by the loue of his Subjects, and other outward blessings, as with two faire children a Sonne and a Daughter, that after his death should succeed in that Empire. And by reason Age was now so much growne vpon him, that he found himselfe wearied, and vnable to exercise the care that belongeth to the gouernment of so mighty a Nation: also beholding in his Sonne, more then ordinary grauity, and so forward a minde to vertue, as that he might well commit a matter of such waight to his care: he determined to giue himselfe to rest, which well agreed with his Age, and therefore caused all the Peeres of his Land to be assembled. Which beeing effected, and all set in Parliament, the old King vttered his minde: which was, to establish his Sonne Persicles in the Kingdome. The Peeres before that, as well by common report, as of their owne experience, hauing perfect knowledge of his manifold vertues, gaue their generall consents: And so Persicles within few dayes was crowned King. Pius hauing effected this according to his mind, yet could not be at quiet vntill he had prouided a mariage for his daughter, befitting her estate. To further which good intent, it fortuned that Deloratus Son and heyre to the King of Persia , hearing of Pieraes beauty (for so was she called) came into the Country of Assyria, and by long sute, at last obtained her good will, and her fathers consent: being assured to her in the presence of most of the Peeres, but for that certaine conditions were to be ratified by the King his Father, the solemnization of the marriage was deferred vntil that was performed: and for that time should not be long protracted, which Deloratus with earnestnesse hastened. Persicles with the consent of his Father, accompanied his Sister Piera into Persia, attended by a number of gallant Knights, as well to see the conditions ratified, and the marriage performed, as also to doe Deloratus honour. After their departure, they within few dayes arriued in the Kingdome of Persia, where Persicles and Piera were most honourably entertained by the olde King Torsilus , and the conditions ratified. The Solemnization of the marriage was deferred for certaine dayes, for that the King of Persia determined to haue the same performed with great pompe, whether he inuited many of his Neighbouring Kings, as of Arabia, Natolia, and Thessalia. The knights of Persia made preparation to attend the Bridegroome in great royalty. Persicles being in the Persian Court, hearing what Gallants were likely to be at the wedding, prepared most rich Ornaments against that day, determining not to be the last in tryall of his valour at the Tilt. The prefixed day being come, the King of Arabia, Natolia, Thessalia, and many other Princes of great Estate, with them were arriued, and the City was filled with such a number of Knights and Gallants, that there was scarce roome therein to containe them. To recite euery particular of theyr entertainements, greetings, riches, and what gallant Ladies were with them, would be ouer-tedious: but in briefe, there was such royall entertainment as befitted such Personages, and such a multitude of rare shewes, and fine deuices, as might euery way please a curious beholder. The Marriage being past, the sumptuous Banquets ended, and the Estates set to behold the Tilt: The first that entered the Lists, was a Persian Duke, named Osimus , gallantly mounted and a man of goodly proportion: After whom, followed the rest of the Persian Knights, who were all Challengers against all strangers that came to make tryall of their Ualour. Next came the aduerse part, the foremost of which was Persicles , who appeared in Richnesse, according to the dignity of his place, being King of so mighty a Country as Assyria: whose sight led the beholders in admiration of his euident perfections. After whom followed Nonlus Prince of Natolia, and after him a number of most gallant Knights, so richly adorned, as would haue perswaded a cowardly miscreant to haue become valiant: whose particular description I omit. As Persicles was chiefe of the aduerse part, and Duke Osimus of the Persians, so they two beganne the encounter, breaking of staues with exceeding valour: but Osimus entending to winne the chiefest honour, for that he was esteemed the best Knight in Persia, had prouided staues of tough Wood, which would not start with an easie encounter: one of which he tooke, and ranne the fourth time at Persicles , who vnprouided of such an vnexpected assault was ouerturned: and his Steed tumbling, fell vpon him, that with the fall he for a time remained without sence. The King of Persia and the rest, being exceedingly afraid that he was slaine, came running off the Scaffolds to take him vp, carrying him foorth of the Lists, to be vnarmed: Amongst the rest, his sister Piera vsed her vttermost diligence to recouer him, with whom likewise, were a number of gallant Ladyes to assist her: but chiefly the Queene of Persia, and her youngest Daughter Constantia , as more regarding him, by reason he was Brother to Piera , and most of all lamented his mishap. Persicles finding himselfe somewhat recouered, at the first opening his eyes, fixt them on Constantia , which by reason hee was not fully reuiued, stood still fixt vpon the first object, as it were with affectionate earnestnesse, which caused an exceeding blush to rise in her cheekes. But now seeing such a number about him, he was amazed, & halfe ashamed of this foyle, sayd: I beseech you leaue me to myselfe: and see the rest of the Turnament, for I haue no harme. With that he started vpon his feet, and fetching a deepe sigh departed. They were all exceeding glad of his safety: and so leauing him to be attended by his owne Knights, they departed to the Scaffolds, and againe tooke their places to behold the rest of the Turnament. Persicles was exceedingly vexed, that he had receiued such a disgrace, and in the presence of such an honorable assembly: most of all for that he vnderstood Osimus intent: presently buckled on one of his Knights Armors, and mounting himselfe, entred the Lists againe: by which time, the Tilt was almost ended, and the Persian Knights bare away the prize; but Persicles then vnknowne, stood ready at the Races end, for the next encounter: against whom a Persian Knight ran, but so farre to his disgrace, that he tumbled with his heeles vpwards. With that euery one began to wonder what he should be, and the people gaue an exceeding shout: with that the other Persian met with him, whose fortune was much like the former. For his Steed stumbling with the strength of the Encounter, they both fell downe. A Knight of Persia who that day had wonne great honor by his valor, seeing that, would needs be the next to meet him, thinking to reuenge his Countrymans disgrace: but at the first race he could not performe it, for they past by without any other oddes, but breaking their staues most gallantly. And running againe the Persians Fortune was so bad, that he was ouerthrowne. By this time the day was ended, and the Iudges ready to depart: but Osimus intreated that he might break one staffe with the strager, which they granted. Whom Persicles well knew, resolutely determined to giue or take the foyle, both of them meeting with such terror, that the Earth seemed to shake, and Osimus (notwithstanding all his strength) was by Persicles ouerthrowne, to salue his honor, and requite his discourtesie. With that the people gaue such shouts, as made all the Pallace ring with the sound. And Persicles discouered himselfe, which made euery one reioyce, and wonder at his valour. Persicles being vnarmed, accompanied the King of Persia, Natolia , and the rest, hauing that day wonne such honour as made him more highly esteemed: and comming to salute his sister Piera , hee suddenly espyed Constantia : thinking he had before seene that sweet countenance, but he could not remember where, which cast him into such a deepe study, that he almost forgat himselfe. After he had saluted the rest he came to Constantia , to whom he sayd. Faire Lady either I haue beheld your Beauty, and that sweet countenance in some other Countrey, or in some vision, for my mind perswadeth me, I should perfectly know you: for I am sure this is not the first time I haue seene you, which maketh me thus bold to demand of whence you are, if it be not offensiue vnto you. Sir (replyed Constantia ) it may be, I am but an imperfect shadow of her you so perfectly remeber; for vntill this day I neuer saw you, which maketh me suppose, you doe but take an occasion of course to commend me, that deserue no such matter, neither shall you offend me: nor I deny to shew my Birth, being Daughter to the King of Persia , but for many yeares brought vp in Arabia . Pardon my boldnesse (quoth Persicles ) for I would not offend you, neither doe I thinke you a shadow, but a perfect substance, and not to resemble any but your selfe: for there can be no Beauty that excelleth yours, which mine eyes before this time haue beheld: or else Nature it selfe hath imprinted in my hart an essentiall instinct of deuotion thereto, which perswadeth me to this boldnesse: therefore I humbly desire you not to misconceiue me, nor esteeme me of so rude a disposition, as to speake otherwise then my heart thinketh: and to account of me as one that earnestly desireth to be better acquainted with you, and will indeauor to make you amends for any offence giuen, offering my selfe and all that is mine, to be at your disposition: which said, he left off further speech, for he saw others attend to heare what he said. At night Constantia being in her priuate Chamber, called to remebrance Persicles speeches, which made her maruel why he should say, he had before that seen her, which she knew could not be: but remembring how earnestly he beheld her that day, when he was scarce reuiued fro his trance, she thought that sight might breed such a perswasion in him, which was so indeed: withall, she called to mind, his comelinesse, valour, estate, and courtesie, which she had before noted: all which remembrances made her so much forget all other thoughts that a great part of the night was vnawares ouerpast: & after she had reuiued her sences, she felt such an alteratio, as all that night she could not rest, delighting in nothing so much as to remember him. The like did Persicles , for her Beauty and other outward graces, had pierced so neare his heart, that he was enthralled to her Loue, and resolued to winne it. Earely the next morning he gat vp, seeking all occasions to speake to her againe, but he was disappointed all the forenoone. For she by reason of her little rest in the night, kept her Chaber, and after dinner, accompanyed the Queene her mother, and the other Ladyes whereby he was that day disappointed. The next morning likewise he arose, studying which way to come to her speech, for his affection was so great, as no thought contented him but her remembrance; but before he could bring to passe what he most desired, there arriued Messengers from Assyria , certifying him that his Father was deceast, and that their ancient enemy the King of Armenia had entred his Land, and destroyed many of his Subjects, desiring him in all haste to returne: For in his absence the Assyrians seemed like men without courage. Persicles hearing this vnexpected newes, was exceedingly astonisht, both with desire to saue his Country, and also to prosecute his Loue: the one perswading him to stay, the other to hasten his departure: The one being as deare to him as his life, the other as deare, as both Life, Country, and all: for without obtaining that, hee thought he could not liue, being so much perplexed that he could not resolue what to doe: at last the speciall regard of his Countrey ouercame his heart, & reuiued him with a manly courage to reuenge, that he Commanded all things to be prepared for his sudden departure, and going to his Chamber, he got Pen and Inke, and wrote as followeth. my sudden departure, yet my Love to your perfections, importuneth me to solicite your gentle eares with these rude Lines. I cannot with colourable Phrases shadow a perfect meaning, nor yet with painted Eloquence, decipher my true love: but in the truest sort, manifest my constant affection to your vertues, which unlesse you grace with some favor, will be my endlesse torment. I have long desired to make the same manifest unto you, but I was still disappointed, and my unexpected departure hath now shut me from your presence, wherby I shall live in continuall care. Notwithstanding, I humbly beseech you in my unwilling absence, to esteeme me your faithfull and true devoted Servant, and one that hath vowed himselfe for ever to bee yours: whose welfare consisteth in your curtesie, the hope wherof shall preserve my life untill my returne, which my constant love will cause me to hasten: desiring you, though I be absent, not to forget me, nor for my little deserts to reject me: but let me be so much bound to your vertues, as to conceive well of me: and to your courtesie, as to pitty me: so shall my ioyes be lengthened, my unhappy life is preserued, and my good will and constant loyalty highly rewarded, So with sorrow, I take my leave, Yours inseparably, Hauing wrote this Letter, he found out his sister Piera , to whom he said as followeth Deare sister, the sorrowes that cause my departure, come so suddenly, as that I canot stand long to confer with you: therefore for that I build vpon assurance of your loue, secrecy, & assistance, I will vnfold to you the secrets of my heart, and that which none but your selfe should know. So it is that Constantiaes beauty hath bewitched mine eyes, & I remaine so much inthralled thereto, that vnlesse she pitty me, I am but cast away. I desire your assistance herein, whereby you may preserue my life. I haue wrote this Letter vnto her, which I desire you to deliuer: and withal to vse such speeches on my behalfe, as shall seeme best to your wisedome: for I assure you, vnlesse at my returne, which shall be shortly, I find her fauourable, my sorrowes will shorten my dayes. Then good sister shew your loue to me in this, and in my absence giue her knowledge of my loyalty, which shall make me euerlastingly thankfull vnto you. Piera promised her vtmost assistance, and so with many teares of her side, they parted. The newes of his departure was soone spred through the whole Court, and likewise came to Constantias hearing, who left her chaber, and gat into her mothers company, where she thought to haue a sight of him, which some small sparks of Loue that were kindled in her tender breast, procured her vnto. After all farewels were past, he espied her in the company of other Ladies, to whom he came, and only amongst the rest of them all, took his leaue of her with a sweet kisse, breathing forth a bitter sigh at the parting, which eueryone noted: Some taking the same in disdaine, and others maruelling that he regarded her aboue them all. Which made the bloud rise in Constantiaes cheekes, and the water swell in her eyes. How Helyon Prince of Arabia , crost the love betweene Persicles and Constantia . Of a battell fought betweene Persicles , and the King of Armenia . And how disguising himselfe, he travelled into Persia , and how he discovered himselfe to Constantia . His departure caused a sadnesse throughout the Court, for indeed he was the beauty thereof, so excellent was his person, and so commendable his qualities. Piera betaking her selfe to her Chamber, lamented his absence with priuate teares, vntill Deloratus found her out, and caused her with his comfortable speeches, to giue ouer that griefe. The King of Natolia likewise with most of the Nobles and Knights that came to the Solemnization of the Wedding were departed, except Prince Helyon , sonne to the King of Arabia . The occasion of whose stay, was to craue Constantia in marriage, assuring himselfe of her Loue, by reason of the familiarity that was betwixt them in her fathers Court: which indeed by her former kindnesse he might be in some assurance of, though not by any promise she had made him: which motion he made to the King of Persia who esteeming so honourably of him regarding his Birth, and most of all, desiring to be allyed to the Arabian King, gaue his consent, which was fully concluded and agreed vpon, before it came to Constantiaes knowledge. Prince Helyon hauing his assurance, with a merry hart sought out Constantia , entending to reueale the same to her: and according to his wonted kinde of Familiaritie, began to greete her: In whom he found such an alteration, that he wondred thereat, saying: My deare Constantia , this vnexpected vnkindnesse in you, whom I esteeme as my most chosen Friend, maketh me admire, whereas I had thought to haue enioyed your loue without interruption. Upon confidence of your courtesie, I haue moued your Fathers consent to our Marriage, who hath yeelded thereto: then I beseech you, darken not both your and my ioyes, with these Mistie cloudes of care, which will fill my heart with sorrow: but rather increase your kindnes, to both mine and your comfort. Constantia's countenance bewrayed the angry motions of her hart, incensed by his speeches, that she had much adoe to withhold her eyes from shedding teares: yet with a colour as red as Scarlet, she gaue him this answer. Prince Helyon , if that be true which you tell me, I cannot chuse but wonder at your follie, that would without assurance of my Loue, make such a motion: thinke you my affections are to be limitted according to your disposition? For my part, I disclayme such interest, and renounce such Affection: for I neuer intended any such matter, nor euer did you demand the same. Then my Lord be you satisfied for this, for I neuer yet did, nor will giue my consent. Helion hearing her answere, was nipt on the head, being strooke with such griefe, that he could not tell what to say. But at last replied. Constantia , I confesse I haue done you wrong, in aduenturing so farre without your consent, but yet for that I haue not thereby either dishonoured your Name, or otherwise iniured you, I humbly craue pardon, desiring you to ratifie that which I haue by your former curtesies assured my selfe of: and let not my ouerboldnesse alienate any part of your good will, For you know my affections haue remained inuiolable constant many yeares: and I haue attended your liking with such feruencie, as you may be resolutely assured of my truth. Then I beseech you be not now displeased with mee, but according to your wonted kindnesse, accept me into your fauour. My Lord (replied she) I cannot deny but that your goodwill hath exceeded my deserts, for which I thanke you: and withall, that I haue alwaies esteemed you, which likewise I would haue done still: But now that opinion is altered neither can I be induced to conceiue wel of him that would doe me such manifest iniury as you haue done. Therfore I pray be contented with that fauor you haue had, for my affections are otherwise emploied, and my heart vtterly disagreeing to the motion you haue made. With that shee espied Piera in the Garden comming towards her, to whom she went down, saluting her most kindely. Piera thought now to haue deliuered her Persicles Letter, but by reason that there were diuers in their companie, she could not then performe it. After a while they left each other. Piera returning to her Chamber, and Constantia into a secret place of the Garden where shee vttered these meditations. What contrarious disquiets are these possesse the center of my heart? What inconueniences am I like to run into? and how shal I auoyd blame for the one, and reape content by the other? How vnkindly hath Prince Helion vsed me, to make this motion to my Father, whose disposition must not be crost, without hazzard of much disquiet? My kindnesse to him, hath caused his ouer-fond conceit of himselfe, and brought mee into much trouble: I could haue loued him before I came to the sight of Persicles , whose guifts are so far exceeding his, that whereas my heart loued him, the thought of that Loue is now most grieuous. Wherein I may doe my selfe great wrong: for in hope of his affection, I refuse Helions loue, wch may depriue me of both, purchase my Fathers heauy displeasure, and my own perpetuall discontent, Reuoluing a Chaos of these, and such like confused cogitations, which ouercame her sences with their ambiguity, in a heauy and discontented vaine she went to her Chamber, thinking there to consider of euery particular at ye full: where she found Piera all alone, staying her comming in, who soone espied that Constantia had wept whereupon she tooke occasion to say as followeth. My beloued Sister, I am sorry to see you in this heauy and sadde vaine, alwayes finding you either sad or weeping, which maketh me wonder; and desirous to know the cause, as one willing in any sort to counsell you,  & comfort you with my vttermost assistance, I haue of purpose entred your Chamber, to haue some conferece with you in priuate, being a Messenger sent to you by my Brother Persicles , who I know loueth you dearely: who by me humbly commendeth himselfe vnto you, being sorry that his sudden departure was such, that he could not before his going doe you that Seruice you deserue, and he desired. Withall, he desired me to deliuer you this Letter, which he left behinde, to testifie the depth of his affection: which at my request vouchsafe to read, & withall credit: for I know his honourable heart endureth much care by his absence. Constantia without making reply receiued the letter, and read the same: which when she had done, she said: Deare Sister, I thanke you for taking this paines to come to me, and not rather to haue sent for me, that rest at your command. And also I thank that worthy King Persicles , that he will vouchsafe me such vndeserued fauour, as to esteeme well of my vnworthinesse, to whom I am bound in all honorable respect: but how vnfit I am to entertaine loue, your selfe would judge, if you knew my estate, which vpon assurance of your secrecy I will vnfold. Prince Helion of Arabia , vainly presuming he was assured of my fauour, hath asked my Fathers consent, to a mariage twixt him & me, which he hath granted vnto: which ye heauens can testifie is vtterly disagreeing to my heart, and altogether without my Consent, which he shall neuer attaine, what danger soeuer I incurre thereby. Which if Persicles should vnderstand, would soone alter his minde: Therefore it is best for his quiet not to place his affections on me so vnworthy, but let me alone to endure the affliction that is likely to ensue. I know (qd. Pyera ) my Brothers Loue is so constant, that nothing can alter the same. which he related to me at large: which maketh me testifie the assurance therof. Which would you but accept of, or giue me some comfortable hope in his absence, I should thinke my selfe bound to you for euer, and to haue done him an exceeding pleasure: for nothing but the happy tidings of your fauour, can comfort him. The King of Persia will not compell you to marry Helyon when he vnderstandeth that you are otherwise bent, for that were cruelty. And I thinke Helion himselfe beareth not so dishonourable a minde, as to seeke your Loue by constraint, for that were inhumanity. But would you yeeld to like of my Brothers loue that is euery way as good as the Prince of Arabia , the knowledge thereof would soone make him return to aske your fathers consent, which may peradueture stand as wel affected to him as to Prince Helio . Ay me qd. Constat : sister I need not doubt to reueale my greatest secrets to you that I know for Persicles sake wil conceale them, I cofesse without further circumstances, that I loue that worthy King Persicles , which is ye cause of these disquiets: neither did my fauor euer yeeld to conceit of liking to Helyons loue, which I tooke to be rather grounded vpon common familiarity, then pretence of Marriage. Therefore now that you are assured of that which you request, I beseech you not to conceiue amisse of my rash confession, nor esteeme my loue light, because of so short continuance, for it shalbe immoueable: but rather comfort my poore disquieted hart, with your counsel how to auoyde these inconueniences. And if that worthy King be so affected towards me, as your speeches and his Letter here affirmeth, I would wish his returne might be speedy: otherwise my sorrowes will be endlesse. For I know my Fathers nature to bee such, that whatsoeuer he will haue, must be performed, though equity would perswade the contrary. Grieue not so much (quoth Piera ,) with premeditated conceit of feare, which peraduenture shal neuer come to passe: I will presently send messengers vnto my Brother, which shall carry such newes as will comfort his heart, and cause speedy returne: in the meane time I will make Deloratus acquainted with Helions practise, not Persicles Loue, who shall perswade the King all that may be, not to consent to marry you against your minde. Be then of good comfort, and in assurance of Persicles Loyalty let no feare disquiet your sences, or impaire your health: For things now at the worst may haue a good end. These speeches ended they parted. All this while Prince Helion was meditating how to hasten the Mariage, but most of all to find the cause of Constantias discontent: which he thought was aggrauated against him, by some good conceit shee had lately entertained of some other then himselfe, which made him prosecute the same with more feruency: and dealt so effectually with the King, that he swore Constantia should be ruled by him. And thereupon, the next day sent for her, to whom he said. Daughter, I thinke it is not vnknowne to you that I haue promised you in Marriage to Prince Helion ; one that is euery way worthy to match with you, both for Noblenesse of Birth, vertuous qualities, and comelines of person. Withall, I am giuen to vnderstand, that you like not our choice, nor esteeme our command: which if you neglect, you shall not only displease mee, but also loose my fauor for euer. For as you are mine, I purpose to dispose of you, but if you refuse my counsell, refuse me too; for I will not regard a disobedient childe. The manifold reasons I could alleadge, that perswade me to the consumation of this Contract, are of such waight, as I might seeme carelesse of your welfare, and your self enuious of your owne good, to deny them: therefore let me know your answer. Constantia well knew that if shee denyed, he would be offended; and his froward Nature to be so much disposed to wrath, that before she could speake she shooke with feare: yet resolution to hazard the worst, humbling herselfe vpon her knee, she made this answere. My reuerend duty to you (most louing Father) perswadeth my consent to fulfill your command though my Loue bindeth me to the contrarie: that I stand perplext twixt two extreames: the one fearing to offend you, the other to procure my euerlasting discontent: for in refusing to doe according to your will, I shall incurre your indignation, and in performing the same, my euerlasting sorrow. For as yet my heart could neuer yeeld to loue that worthy Prince, who farre too worthy to be matcht with me. Most humbly beseeching you to consider, that inforced Loue neuer bringeth content, but disquiet, which with Helion , will be my portion: Therefore I beseech you reuoke your determination. Is it euen so (quoth he) shall my commaund be counteruaild by your peuish conceit? Is this the regard you giue to my good will? Are you wiser then I? or are you willing to displease mee? Shall my will stand at your direction? is this the duty you owe to your Father? or feare you no more to offend me? Haue I so carefully brought you vp, and tenderly regarded you for this? Henceforth neuer come in my sight, for I will not esteem thee as a Child, but as a bastard: and withall I vow that if thou dost not yeeld to marry him, vse him kindly, and apply thy deuotions to his liking, I will vse thee in such sort, that all Persia shall lament thy case. Hauing giuen her this bitter reproofe, he departed: leauing her weeping the fountaines of her precious eyes dry, wringing her hands, & like one in a dead trance, ouercome with griefe, cast vpon the Earth. The first that entred the roome was Helyon , who seeing her in that agony, tooke her by the hand to haue raised her from ye earth, but she refusing his helpe, vttered these speeches. Untill this time I alwaies esteemed honourably of you but now my good opinion is altered, for that you onely seek my torment: my Father hath giuen me charge to Marry with you, which I must against my heart fulfill: but be assured neuer to possesse my Loue, for that I haue bequeathed an other: onely my outward parts may be yours, but my inward, affections shall continually esteeme you as the onely occasioner of my endlesse miseries. With that she rose vp from the ground, giuing him neither better words, nor other kinde behauiour, but left him standing still as one astonisht. Piera made Constantia's estate knowne to Deloratus , who so farre as he durst, perswaded her Father not to constraine her to marry the Prince: but such wilfulnesse possest him, that the more they intreated him the more contrarious he was, and therefore appointed the day for the Marriage to be within two monthes. And in the meane time doubting the King of Arabiaes consent, he sent his Embassadours to that effect. Piera hearing this, presently sent messengers into Assiria , to certifie Persicles of all that had happened: and withall, wrote a Letter, which contained the whole summe of Constantia's consent to his Loue. Who with all diligence hasted vntill they arriued there, beeing presently conducted into his presence: After he had most kindely imbraced them, he demanded how Piera did, and what message they brought from her: whereupon they deliuered him the Letters they had brought: which when he had read, commanding his Knights to giue the Messengers honourable entertainement, hee departed to his Tent, one way so much comforted, and an other way so much troubled, that he sate him downe in a deepe study, not yet knowing what to resolue vpon. When he had a long space meditated with what contrarieties his Fortunes were crost, the daunger his Country was in, how likely he was to loose Constantia , and how difficult to attempt her possession, and many other, at last he thought his Life would be nothing without her Loue: and therfore he fully resolued to hazard the same to attaine it: but so vnpossible it seemed which way to accomplish the same: For first the Armenians warre hazarded his Knigdome, whom he could not suddenly expell: Next to attempt to winne her by force, that could not be, for the Persian was too mighty: & lastly, delay might breed a greater mischiefe then all the rest: that calling vnto him two of his chiefest Nobles, the one named Parenus , a wise Counsellour, the other Thrureus a Noble Warriour, he vttered his minde to them, saying: I haue sent for you, as the men that I must respect and trust: being determined to commit to your charge the gouernement of my Kingdome, for that waighty businesse, and such as concernes my euerlasting welfare, must for a season withdraw mee: and for that I am fully assured of your Loyalty. I will vse no exhortations, to perswade you thereto, but to order the same in this sort. Thrureus resembling me much, both in proportion and countenance, shall in any absence possesse my roome, whom the people will assuredly take to be my selfe, and so gouerne them with more ease. And you Parenus , by your wisedome order all things according thereto: Thus you know my minde: which I doe not doubt, but you will accomplish in euery respect according to my desire. They first intreated him, not to depart, but when they saw nothing could preuaile, they swore that they would faithfully execute what he had giuen them in charge. Hee likewise telling them that he would depart within three dayes, which he deferred so long, by reason that the second day the Armies of the Assyrians and Armenians should meete. Hauing ended his conference with them, he returned to the Messengers that came from Persia , giuing Letters to Piera , which gaue her knowledge that he would be there within few dayes. The prefixed day for the Battell was now come, and both the Armies met, betwixt whom began so hot & deadly a Fight, that many thousands on both parts lost their liues, and the Armenians greedy of their Enemies ouerthrow, followed them so eagerly, that they began to sound retrait. Persicles seeing that, left the place of his Gouernment, and with his Lance ready coucht, met an Armenian Duke so full, that he pierced the same through his body, then drawing his sword, with the same he slew the next & after him dismembred others: that within a while his valour made such a Massacre amongst them, that they auoyded the place of his Fight, and thought themselues best that were furthest of him. Thus valorously did he pursue them, vntill he was vnawares in the midst of their Army: which aduantage the King of Armenia espyed, and thinking Persicles life within his power at him with a lance poyned with steele, but it mist him: and Persicles seeing him, met him so full with the pommel of his sword against his breast, that had not his Steed yeelded, he had broken his backe; with that the Armenians assailed him round about, with such vnequall oddes, being a multitude to one, that sometimes they were thrust so neere vpon him by the throng, that swayed him vp and downe: Those that came next him dyed by his sword, their dead trunkes falling downe betwixt his Steeds legges, which made him spring about with such furie, that he soone made them giue way. In the meane time, while the most part of the Battell were bent to destroy him, the Assyrians had made such a slaughter amongst the outwings of the Army, that most of them were slaine, and the rest fled, Thrureus fearing Persicles harme, for that he mist him with his Followers, soone found him out, and by that meanes rescued him from amongst the multitude: who by this time had vnhorst him, and he was constrained to fight on foote, being scarce able to withold himselfe from stumbling vpon the dead carkasses of those himselfe had slaine. Thrureus soone got him remounted, and then both of them pursued their enemies so fiercely, that they beganne to flie; and had not the day beene ended, they had beene all destroyed: which caused Persicles to sound retraite, and betake him to his Tent, hauing that day done such deeds of Armes, as made both his owne subiects and the Armenians admire him. Early the next morning, word was brought him, his Enemies were all fled, and not any of them to be found in the Campe, hauing left all there Riches behinde them, being glad they had escaped aliue: which reioyced Persicles to heare, for that they should bee no hinderance to his iourney, commanding his Souldiers to take the spoyle, and to bury the dead: and for that he had receiued neuer a mortall wound, hee determined the next day to depart, which he acquainted Parenus and Thrureus withall, requesting them (if it were possible) not to discouer his absence vntill his returne. Hauing ordered euerything according to his mind, the next morning he departed, attiring himselfe like a Palmer; with his staffe in his hand, which disguise shadowed him from knowledge, that he past his owne Court Gates, vndiscried: which assured him, that if his owne subiects and seruants knew him not, much lesse would strangers, that he passed without feare of being discouered. In this sort did he trauell, thinking it no penance to take paines to finde out his Loue, vntill he arriued in Persia , yet not knowing which way to accomplish his intent, or to come to speech, eyther of Piera or Constantia , for that he was a Stranger, being denyed to enter the Court-gates, where he stayed attending his good Fortune, some three dayes: but as farre from hope then, as at his first comming: that he was so much tormented in his thoughts, that he could not tell what to doe. The next day he heard that the King should goe foorth on Hunting, which made him presently suppose (for that the Parke was so neere the Court) the Ladies likewise would see the Pastime, hoping by some odde meanes or other, to giue one of them knowledge of his arriuall, That he wrote a Letter, the contents whereof were these. should deliver this. The Palmer that delivered this Letter is Persicles , that desireth to speake with one of you, for he sayth, you both are as deare to him as his owne Soule. Attending an happy houre, I end. Yours Persicles . The next day, according to his hopes, the King and Queene, Dela , and Piera, Helyon and Constantia , and many other, came forth, whom Persicles soone espyed: and well noting Constantiaes countenance, perceiued the same so darkened, as if she had beene fully possest with discontent. Who comming neere him (for he stood so as they must passe by him) casting her eyes vpon him, beheld him so earnestly, that she almost forgate her selfe, feeling her heart to throb with an vnwonted motion, that she let fall her rich Scarffe, most curiously imbroydred, which occasion Persicles soone espyed, as awayting such an opportunity, tooke vp the Scarffe and with great reuerence gaue it her, conueying the Letter therein so closely, that she soone espyed the same: wherewith her heart began to pant, and viewing the superscription, found it directed to her, or Piera : that closely she put the same in her bosome, lest Helyon or any else should espie it, vntill she could find opportunity to reade it. By this time, the game was rowsed, and all but she alone followed the pastime with earnestnesse: which she beholding withdrew her selfe with one of her Ladyes, and read the Letter through, which affected her heart with such joy and feare, that sometimes her heart leapt with the one, and her Eyes stood ready to ouerflow with teares with the other. Presently following the company vntill she ouertooke Piera , to whom she said: Sister, did you not behold the Palmer that stood in the way, as we came by the Pallace Wall? Yes (quoth she) And doe you not know him, said Constantia ? It is your Brother Persicles . With that Piera smiled, saying: How can that be: or what maketh you thinke so? With that she pull'd out the Letter, and had her read it: Which when she had done, she sayd: Constantia , he is worthy to be kindly vsed, hauing trauailed so farre on foot to see vs. Yea (quoth Constantia ) how may we come to speake with him? Or how may we giue him that Welcome his Worthinesse deserueth? that for my vnworthy sake, hath vndertaken to hazard his Royall person in trauell? Let me alone (quoth Piera ) and the better to auoyd suspition, vse Helyon somewhat more kindly then heretofore you haue done, that his minde may be voyd of iealousie: for I perceive when you come in any place or company, he hath a diligent and vigilant eye ouer you. And calling vnto her a Damzell named Dela , one that was priuy to all her secret Counsels, to whom she sayd: Goe thy way and finde out the Palmer that thou sawest as we came, for it is Persicles , conduct him into my Chamber, where let him stay vntill my returne: and if any aske thee what he is, tell them he is of Assyria , and bringeth me newes from the Knight my Brother. Dela hasted, and soone found him out, Reuerently saluting him, and calling him by his name: which made him maruell that she knew him, vntill she deliuered her Message, which he was ready to fulfill, as the thing he aboue all things desired. And hauing brought him into the Court, which she did without contradiction, she returned to certifie her Mistresse thereof. Whom she met with Constantia , and some few before the rest, returning to the Court, being both desirous to see Persicles . Who now entring the Pallace, were soone espyed of him, which affected his heart with such content, as it seemed to reuiue his sences. Constantia likewise was possest with such contrarious passions, sometimes of Feare, joy, bashfulnesse, desire, and modest loue, that her heart seemed to dissolue: and all the Arteries of her body wrought with internall and strange motions. By this time they were ascended the stayres, and Persicles ready to meet them, who first saluted Piera , as reseruing the best for the last: which he performed so superficially, in respect of the behauior he vsed to Constantia , whose modesty made her blush: whilest he bereft her of a sweet kisse: who with as mild a countenance as if Modesty her selfe had beene there, bade him Welcome. Most diuine Lady (quoth he) I cannot expresse my thankfulnesse by outward meanes, for that my heart both wisheth and intendeth more good to you, then my tongue can vtter: being so farre bound vnto you in (respect of my slender and small deserts) for your esteeming well of me, that I shall neuer be able to discharge the debt. And though you haue little cause by reason of the small proofe you haue of my Fidelity, to yeeld me Loue, yet if my faithfull Uow may satisfie you, and my plighted promise of perpetuall constancie assure you, you shall finde me both constant in Loue to you, Faithfull, to deale Honourably with you, and Loyall, not to doe any thing that shall be disagreeable to your Will. My Lord (said Constantia ) in full assurance of your good meaning my heart willingly affecting you more then any, without farther delay, I yeeld my selfe to your disposition: desiring you not to misconceiue me. And though I am too vnworthy such account as you make of mee, my possession being linckt to so many Inconueniences, yet since your desire is to haue it so, I am ready wholly to be ruled and gouerned and ruled according to your directions. Piera then said Let further conference for this time cease, because I heare of the Kings returne: and for this Night I will prouide for my Brothers security, with whom I will conferre about this businesse, vntill you may conueniently meet againe. This sayd, Persicles tooke his leaue of Constantia , with many ceremonious Farewels, as each part interchanging their hearts, such perfect Loue was establisht betwixt them. He to a secret Chamber to meditate. Piera , to accompany her Husband. And Constantia , with an outwardly merry, though inwardly heauy heart, to Welcome Helyon . How Constantia disguised her selfe, and departed the Emperours Court with Persicles . Within this place, stayed Persicles so long without meanes how to accomplish his desire, which was to conuey away Constantia , that the prefixed day for the performance of the Marriage approached, which draue them to their vttermost shifts, knowing that now or neuer it was to be done. Constantia comming to Pieraes Chamber, with a heauy heart and watry eyes, demanded whether they had yet determined how she should escape? But hearing them make no answer, sayd thus: (My Lord) since the feare you haue I should be discouered, and so dishonoured, maketh you vnwilling to haue me hazard my selfe, the time of my pretended Wedding now drawing nigh, which I most abhorre, because I loue none but your selfe: Prouide but for your owne departure out of the Court, without being discouered, and stay for me in the Euening, vnder the Myrtle-tree, by the Pallace wall, and thither I will assuredly come to you: but by what meanes, as yet I know not. Persicles was glad to heare her speeches, but he was much troubled in mind that his misfortune was such, that he could not carry her thence, without she her selfe should hazard her escape alone, but seeing her forwardnesse, which was an infallible token of her constancie, with many thanks and Fare-wels, vntill their happy meeting againe they parted: with such carefull hearts, and outward signes of sorrow, as would haue made the hardest heart of any remorselesse beholder relent. Persicles soone departed, and without disturbance: for in that Habit he was without controll, and soone got to the Myrtle-tree, where vnder he sate him downe, vttering many hearty Inuocations for his Loues fortunate escape: thinking that she alone should endure this hazzard, but whatsoeuer extremity should follow, should bee borne by him. Constantia being in her Chamber with Dela , many thoughts possest her fancies, and sundry Deuises were soone inuented, and as soone out of content, that many she bethought her of, but none of them seemed currant. At last, leaning out of her Window, she espyed a Countrey-damzell enter the outer Court of the Pallace, with a Basket on her arme, wherein were Grapes, which she came of purpose to present vnto Constantia , for their fairnesse: being a gift worthy acceptation. The Porter knowing her minde, sent her to the Princesse Chamber with a Gentleman. Constantia seeing that she came to her, caused her to come in, receiuing her Present most graciously: the Gentleman being departed, Dela by Constantiaes appointment, led the Maiden into a secret chamber, telling her, that it was her Mistresse pleasure, so much to grace her, that she should attend on her, and not returne to her Fathers house: the damzell being glad of that preferment, gaue her many thankes. Dela then caused her to put off her owne Apparell, and put on other that was Constantiaes . Which done, she left her and carried her homely weeds to Constantia , which she presently put on: disrobing her selfe of her rich ornaments, casting aside all other care, but only to attaine her Loue. And the Euening, being now come, the happy time of her euerlasting weale or woe, she tooke the damzels Basket on her arme, and first with many farewels to Dela , commendations to Piera , and heauy sighes to leaue her Parents, not knowing what misfortunes might befall her, with the water standing in her eyes, which to her vttermost power she returned, she went downe the staires, and from thence into the Court, behauing her selfe so decently, that none that met her had any thought, but that she had beene a perfect Damzell: and so she past vntill she came to the Porter, who knowing of her comming in, denyed not to let her out. Constantia having past thus far without escape, thought not to be long in going to the appointed place, but feare and hope hastening her steps, she sometimes ranne, and sometimes went: and then againe looking behind her, as if some had pursued her, ran vntill she gate a sight of the tree, where vnder likewise she espyed her Loue, who before that beheld her, but in that habite knew her not. To whom she approacht so nigh, that he noting her well, knew her, and with that embraced her in his armes, saying: My dearest Loue, a thousand times Welcome, and more desired of me, then all the riches of the World: for euer shall this day be blest, and the houre of this our happy meeting, accounted Fortunate: Let all that wears this habit be happy, and enjoy their most desired content: and let this tree wheresoeuer growing, be esteemed aboue many others: For that it was the appointed place of our meeting. Let the Euening be the most pleasant time of the day for Louers meetings: and let all those be Fortunate in their meetings, whose hearts harbour constant Loue. My deare (quoth he) I cannot expresse the joy my heart conceiueth at your presence, being sorry that you are thus driuen to hazard your Person for my sake: being likewise as sorry that I haue no place of security to carry you vnto, for in this place we must not stay long, therefore let vs depart the nearest way towards Assyria ,  & Fortune that hath shewed her selfe so gentle, may fauour vs with some more happy successe. My Lord (qd. Constantia ) now that I haue attained your presence, I haue found the Harbor I expected, where my heart shall rest, what hereafter you shall intend, I will be as well contented with as your selfe: therefore direct your steps which way soeuer you will, I will beare you company. Persicles heart was glad to heare her so cheerefull, that folding his Arme in hers, the Night being new approached, they walked along: she by the way discoursing the manner of her escape: To relate the conference betweene them, were tedious: but the most part of the night, they continued trauelling so fast, as Constantiaes feeble legges could carry her: who though not accustomed to such labour, yet endured the same so cheerefully, as it had beene a wonder to behold: but at last arriuing into a solitary place, where seldome any frequented but Shepheards. The Night being farre spent, and Constantia wearie, they seated themselues downe vpon a banke, and their minds being now somewhat eased of cares, their bodyes wearied with trauell, and the place voyd of disturbance: After some delightfull conference, Constantia slept, and within a while Persicles did the like: not awaking vntill the Sunnes bright beames glimmering vpon them, awakened them. Persicles heart now beganne to be troubled, where to get Food for Constantia , which he was out of hope to attaine in those solitary walkes, and rising vp to view the place well, and which way next to trauell, he espyed a Shepheards Cottage hard by, to which he with Constantia went, knocking at the doore, when presently the Shepheards Wife came foorth, who espying such vnlooked for Guests, started backe, saying; What would you haue? Mother (said Persicles ) my Wife and I (for so he thought best to name her, to auoid suspect) trauailing towards Assyria , by misfortune yesternight lost our way, and haue wandred vp and downe all this night, that we are both weary, especially my Wife, that hath not beene vsed to such vnrest: our desire is to rest our selues, and get vs food (if it may be) in this place: Which kindnesse, if you will afford vs, we will both pay for our charge we put you too, and withall rest thankfull. The Shepheardesse noting them well, thought them other then their habit declared: with whom his kinde Words and their countenances so much preuayled, that she desired them to come in, telling them, that her house rested wholly at their disposition. So they both entred, and willingly sate them downe to rest themselues: but Persicles asking the old woman what meate she had, she told him she had none at all: but if it pleased him, she would be ready to fetch any thing he should send for, at a Uillage hard by. Whereupon the old Woman went forth to buy meat, leauing them in the house alone: In whose absence Persicles desired Constantia not to be offended with him for saying she was his Wife; For (quoth he) should I name you my sister, or otherwise, it might breed in them some suspition. Withall, they hearing of your escape, which may by some meanes or other come to their knowledge, will the sooner suspect you; but vnder that name, shall you be voyd of the least knowledge. Constantia was contented to be ruled by him in any thing, whose heart would now haue conceited the height of content, had not feare to be disclosed darkened the same. In which place wee will leaue them, to speake of Helyon . Of a merry Iest that befell Helyon Prince of Arabia . Mayden, to tell Piera what was done, and to aske her counsell what to doe: who hearing all, at last bad her returne to the Damozell, and carry her meate for her Supper, but so closely as none might see her goe out and in: which Dela performed, and telling her where she should lye, so left her: altering her Garments and Attyres in such sort, that the Mayden seeing her, should not know her. The Mayden being alone, was soone tempted to take those dainty meates, for that she was very hungry, thinking her selfe most happy to be so exalted, daintily fed, and seeing her soft Bed, her belly being full, and being not vsed at home to sit vp late, drawing the curtaines close about her, went to Bed, where she was no sooner laid, but she fell fast asleepe. Helyon all that euening, maruelling he could not see Constantia , and withall, not seeing Piera , was satisfied, thinking they had beene together, When Supper was ended, he determined to see her, and therefore went to Pieraes Chamber, thinking to find her there, who told him, that she was not there this afternoone. Then hastening thence, he went to Constantiaes Lodging, finding the Doore shut, which being but latcht, he opened, and so softly as he could, shut the doore againe: with easie pace, and stealing steppes, passing through the first roome, vnto the next, where he saw a light burning through the hangings, which he softly lifted aside, and looking into the chamber, saw no body stirring, but the curtaines drawne, and Constantiaes Apparell lying not far off and drawing nigh the Bed perceiued that she was fast asleepe: that standing by the Bed, as loath to awake her, and yet vnwillingly to leaue her, he silently vttered these meditations. Sweet Fortune hath appointed this happy houre, in fauour of my true loue that haue with constancy long attended my Loue, but neuer was graced with any title of her fauour: which opportunity if I ouerstep, it may be I shall neuer attaine the like: if I should attempt to awake her, could she be offended? if I should further aske her consent to possesse of her Loue: could shee take it in all part? No, she knoweth my Loue is loyall, and therefore will not be offended: but this feareth mee most, I neuer as yet had any fauour at her hand: shee for ought that I can see, regardeth me not; but in stead of my loue, repayeth me with sorrow: yet in that I may be deceiued: Peraduenture shee hath vsed mee to make tryall of me, and also hath done this, to try whether I would like a Coward for feare of displeasure, leaue the scaling of so sweet a Fort: therefore be my fortune good or bad, I will hazard the worst. Then taking the Damzell by the hand, who slept so soundly, that he had much a doe to awaken her, he sayd; Constantia , be not offended with me, it is your faithfull friend Helyon , that speaketh to you: I hauing mist you, thus boldly presumed into your Chamber, which I found but sleightly shut, and fearing that you had beene sick, I am come to visit you, desiring you to graunt me this fauour, both to pardon my bolde intrusion, and let me stay to be your Guardiant: Which said, very boldly he kist the Damzell twice or thrice. The Mayden hearing his speeches, was so amazed, that she could not speake, reuoluing many thoughts in her doubtfull braine, what he should be, and why the Princesse had appointed her to that place: but being vnacquainted with the fashions of the Court, she thought it was the custome there (as she had heard her Father report,) for euery one to haue a Louer, she laid still and said nothing: Which animated Helyon to such confidence, as that fastning the Doore extinguishing the light, and putting off his Apparell, he leapt into the Bed: and first asking pardon with many humble speeches, repeating with what constancie he had serued her, and how faithfully he intended for euer to loue her, he folded her in his armes, vsing such behauiour, as soone tempted the Damzell to yeeld, whome he bereft of her Uirginitie, to both their contents: He on the one side thinking he had imbraced the faire Constantia , and she supposing she had gotten a rich and kinde Louer. When he had stayed with her so long as he could, for feare of being discouered: for that the Day beganne to appeare, he told her that now to his hearts griefe, he was inforced to leaue her: which she was vnwilling he should doe, that by her Embracings, Kisses, and other kinde behauiours, he stayed longer then he would haue done, and tooke such full possession of her before hee went, as she thought her selfe the happiest Mayden aliue: and hee himselfe most fortunately blessed in the possession of so sweet a loue. At last parting with many farewels, the Damzels eyes somewhat dazeled with the sport, layd her downe agayne, and slept soundly, vntill she thought it time to arise. When the day was somewhat aged by the height of the Sunne, Helyon with an exceeding merry countenance, taking a rich standing Cup of beaten Gold, full fraught with the purest Wine, attyring himselfe in his richest Robes, went to Constantias Chamber, to present her therewith: and entring therein, hee found his Bed fellow attired in Constantiaes Ornaments: with which sight, he was so amazed, as that he stood like one in a traunce, thinking himselfe eyther blinde, or that she was Metaphorphosed. The Damzell likewise espying him, was ashamed to see him stand gazing on her with such a wilde countenance, that she blusht exceedingly. At last, Helyon fearing some deceyt, said: Where is Constantia , that you are attired with her Ornaments? The Damzell making a low curtesie, sayd: I know not where she is: her Mayde bad me put on this Apparell yesterday, appoynting me to stay in this place vntill her returne. Helyon then perceiued that he was deceiued, and the Damzell in stead of Constantia had beene his Paramour that night, whome he desired to tell him whether Constantia had of purpose perswaded her to doe that: and also if she knew where she was. For know (quoth he) that thou hast not bestowed thy Uirginity on an vnworthy person, but vpon the Prince of Arabia . The Damzell humbling herselfe vpon her knees, told him all that she knew: Whereby he then perceiued that Constantia was fled, by reason that he could not finde the damzels Apparell: that taking her by the hand, he said: Damzell, I perceiue Constantia still rejecteth me: and therefore as thou in her stead, hast taken possession of my Loue, that good Will and Affection which formerly I haue borne to her, will I beare to thee: and hereafter preferre thee to such dignity, as otherwise thou shouldest neuer attaine vnto: Withall, requesting thee to conceale my being with thee this night, from any: For if it should be knowne, it would redoune to my shame, and thy punishment: but when question shall be made for Constantia , tell thou all that thou knowest of my comming hether, but nothing of me: and in signe of my good Will, I drinke to thee in this Cup of Wine, which I had thought Constantia should haue tasted. This said, he left the Damzell, and so secretly as might be, he went to his owne Lodging: so much grieued in minde, fretting with vexation, and desperate with anger, that he vowed to be reuenged, were it by neuer so cruell meanes: In his heart now hating her, whom before he doted on. Which is a signe of an inconstant disposition: for true Loue could by no meanes be altered. It was not long before Constantia was mist, and the Newes thereof came to the King her Father, who with the Queene, maruelled thereat, causing all diligent Enquirie to be made: but no other newes was heard of them, but that she was gone, and a strange Damzell left in her stead. Who being brought before the King, told them the cause of her comming, and how she was vsed after by a Gentlewoman that wayted on Constantia . Whereupon the King caused all the Ladyes and Gentlewomen in the Court to be brought before him but amongst them all, she could not tell which was shee: for Dela had altered her apparell in such sort, that the Damzell was as ignorant of knowing her, as of any of the rest. The King was so exceedingly inraged, that hee was ready to teare the haire from his head, commanding that the Damzell should bee punished: but at the earnest intreaties of the Queene, she was onely in disgracefull sort turned out at the Court gates. The King for that time in an exceeding rage, betaking himselfe to his solitary Chamber, to study which was the best way to finde out his Daughter. Helyon pittying the Damzell, being now more in loue with her then euer he was with Constantia , called vnto him one of his most trustiest Seruants, willing him in secret sort to follow the Damzell: and to deliuer her a Purse full fraught with Gold, telling her that Prince Helyon sent it her: and withall, to conduct her home to her Fathers house, that he might know where to finde her. Which done, he presently went to the King, desiring him speedily to send foorth Messengers to find Constantia . Who thinking Helyon had requested him thereunto, with his former pretence of Loue, caused twety of his Knights priuily to be brought before him, to whom he imparted his intent: which was, that (not making any priuy therevnto) they should that Night depart seuerall wayes in search of Constantia . All things being complotted according to his minde, the Knights hauing taken their Oathes of Fidelity and Secrecie, and departed, the King rested: calming his disquiet with so merry a countenance, as none supposed, but that he had remitted all regard of Constantia : Which was so closely effected, that the Knights were dispersed euery way in the Countrey, before there was any question made of Constantiaes absence. Helyons Seruant surnamed Aldrus , soone ouertooke the Damzell, deliuering her the gift his Lord had sent, which she receiued with many thanks: telling her likewise, that he had sent him to attend her home. Which she was likewise glad of, fearing her Parents displeasure for staying so long: who knew her not at the first sight, but afterwards were satisfied by Aldrus , who learning her Name, which was Selia , left her. The Pleasures that passed betweene the two faithfull Lovers, Persicles and Constantia , in the Shepheards Cottage. How a Knight that was sent in their search, found them, and what thereon ensued. The Day being farre spent, the old Shepheards Wife returned with Prouision, which shee had brought, dressing the same very cleanly, though after her Country fashion, whereon Persicles and Constantia fedde heartily: spending the rest of the day in talke with the old Woman, vntill at Night the old Shepheard and his sonne returned, who wondred to see such Guests in his House, and such cheare at the fire, that was woont to sup with a Crab put into sowre Whigge: and calling aside his Wife before he would enter, demanded, What they were? Husband (qd. she) they came hither in the morning, desiring me to let them haue but House- roome: For that loosing their way, they had wandred about all that night, and were sore weary. They are the kindest people that euer I saw: Good Husband bid them Welcome. The good old man waxed so kind by his Wiues intreaties, that he came in, telling them they were most heartily Welcome: and that both himselfe and all that he had were at their command. Persicles gaue him many thankes, being much comforted with their kindnesse, which he found dis-agreeing with the humours of Rusticke people. Supper time was come and ended, and then the old Woman called her Husband aside, asking him where they should lye? Marry (quoth he) in our owne Bed. And we for this time will make other Prouision: and therefore, I pray make the same ready in the best sort you can. Which sayd, the old Woman went about the same, and the olde Man comming to them, sayd: Because I know you not, I know not what Title to giue vnto you, but lesse then borne of Gentle blood I am sure you are not: I am sorry my Wealth affordeth me no better entertainement to welcome you withall. But such as our homely Cottage yeeldeth shall be at your disposition. Desiring you to accept this our disable good Will, in stead of better performance: my Wife is making ready your Bed, which though homely, yet cleanly, we hauing no choyce but onely that, desire you to accept it as the best. I thanke you good Friend (quoth Persicles ) but wee shall be vnmannerly to thrust you forth of your owne Rest: therefore we will rather sit vp then disquiet you. Not so (quoth the old man,) I haue all my lifetime beene brought vp to hardnesse, and can endure it well, which I am sure you cannot doe without the hazard of your healthe. Then came the old Woman bringing a light to conduct them vnto the Chamber, which she had drest so finely with greene Rushes and sweet flowers, that it was most pleasant, though nothing costly. And leauing them there departed. Constantia seeing them gone, beganne to blush, to thinke she must be Persicles Bed fellow, which he perceiuing, folding her in his armes, sayd: Now Constantia , you must bee a Wife before you are married, which name you cannot now refuse, hauing giuen your consent thereunto already. I must of force be your Bed-fellow, vnlesse you will haue me lye on the greene Rushes: therefore I pray tell me: Whether you are willing to fauour me so much, or no? Constantia betwixt a modest bashfulnesse, and a modest desire, stood mute, not knowing whether to consent or deny. Sometimes thinking her denyall might disquiet him: and againe, that to yeeld, might make him suspect her of lightnesse: So that betwixt Feare and Hope, she continued silent, as it were ouercome with a deepe study. Persicles smiling thereat, sayd: My deare Loue, I know with what motiues your minde is now agitated: if you thinke it will impaire your Honor to be my chast Bed-fellow, I will rather loose my life then perswade you thereto: but if you will vouchsafe me such fauour as to lye by you, in the most vertuous sort, I protest it shall be no dishonour to you, for that your Uirgin purity shall not be spotted by the least thought of vnlawfull attempt in me: wherein if you will trust me: you shall finde that I will vse you both as beseemeth your Estate, agreeth with your Honour, and the vertuous meaning of a true Friend. My Lord (sayd Constantia ,) doe not thinke me eyther so immodestly scornefull to distrust you, or so curious to thinke it will impaire my Name to be your Bedfellow: Onely this I would wish, that the Rights of Marriage were performed, and then I were at your disposition. Lady (quoth he,) What needeth such strict performance of the outward Ceremonies, which maketh not the Marriage: but those are truely Married, that with vnited hearts haue plighted Promise of perpetuall friendship: electing one the other by true Loue, and not outward Ceremony: For where true Loue is not, there can be no perfect Marriage, though the outward Ceremony be neuer so deuoutly performed. Therefore if my opinion can preuaile with you, we being without meanes to vse the outward Ceremony, may confirme as true and lawfull a Contract betwixt our selues, as euer was established by the rights of the Church. This also maketh me vse these reasons, sithence the meanes of performance of that beeing wanting, we may neuerthelesse still protract our happinesse: For who are more happier then those that liue in perfect Loue, though neuer so miserable: For my part, I esteeme your louing company aboue all ioyes: and the fruition of your Loue, more deare to me, then a thousand liues without the same. Then I beseech you let my intreaties so much preuaile, that I may with your free consent possesse your Loue: For I vowe neuer to loue or chuse other then your selfe. Constantia hearing his speeches, and many other reasons that he alleadged: At last made this answer. My Lord, relying vpon your Uertues, true Loue, and honourable meaning, I yeeld to your Request, giuing my Consent to be your Wife for euer: desiring you to dispose of mee according to your minde: for you shall finde me alwayes obedient at your command. Thus ending theyr speeches, with many Embracings, they adrest themselues to theyr Brydall Bed, which resembled such a Bed indeed: For the old Woman had deckt the Bed with her best linnen, and other furniture, stucke the same round about with sweete Roses, strowed the Chamber, with greene Rushes, filled the Windowes with greene Boughs and Flowers so thicke in euery place, giuing such a sweete sauour, that it might well be tearmed a Shepheards Paradise. The two Louers being in Bed, vsed that behauiour such Louers doe, thinking themselues Fortunate, the place pleasant, their meetings happy, and their Loue sweete, enioying content without controll: Loue without lust: and pleasure without pride: He thinking his ioyes without compare, and she thinking none to be compared with hers. The Byrds without, singing their sweete Dytties in stead of Musicke, and the sweet Philomela , hard by the Wall, with a merry note reioycing at their pleasure. Thus did they passe ouer this night with exceeding content: and the next day in communication with the Shepheard, who committed both the Flockes to the gouernment of his Sonne, for that himselfe would stay to beare them company: to whome he bare such an inward loue, wrought in him by a naturall motion, that he thought himselfe most happy to doe them any pleasure. Some three dayes staied they with the Shepherd, being past feare to be discouered, for that they heard not of any Enquirie was made after them. At last one of the Knights that the King of Persia had priuily sent forth in their search, chaunced to come into the Plaines where the Shepheards sonne was keeping his Sheepe, to whom he said: Shepheard, didst thou not see a Damzell lately passe by this way? Not I answered he: Why, what Damzell is it you aske for? The Knight either by his countenance, or stuttering in his answer, supposing it might be he had seene her, said: It is a friend of mine that I esteeme dearely: She promised me I should heare of her hereabout, but my fortune hath not yet been so good, I cannot tell (said the Shepheard) it may be my father can tell you, who dwelleth hard by yonder thicket. The Knight with that left him, and Rode to the Shepheards house, where he alighting, entred without calling, and found the Sheepheard, his Wife, Persicles , and Constantia , altogether: and presently knowing Constantia , he sayd. Lady Constantia , the King your Father makes great lamentation for your absence at the Court. With that they knew they were betrayed, and she with feare and griefe, fell downe in a trance: Whom with much adoe they recouered. My friend (quoth Persicles ,) thou art either very vnmannerly, or thy Authority is great, that thou intrudest thyselfe into our Company. Doest thou know that this is Constantia ? Then where is thy reuerence to her? Were it not for disquieting her, that is already distempered with thy presence, thou shouldst finde colde entertainement. The Knight being much grieued to see Constantia so disquieted, said: I am sorry my presence hath troubled her, which was contrary to minde: for be it farre from my thought to worke her disquiet: the King of Persia missing her, hath sent out diuers besides my selfe, to seeke her, with Commandement to bring her backe to the Court, and amongst the rest, you see it is fallen to my lot to performe it: yet such regard doe I beare vnto her, that I will not doe any thing disagreeing to her honourable minde. Constantia hearing his speeches, said: what is your name? My name (sayd he) is Pisor . Art thou of Assyria , (quoth Persicles ) and one of the Knightes belonging to Piera ? I am said he. Then I feare not but thou bearest a Knightly minde, and wilt rather conceale this Ladies being here, then betray her, by carrying her backe: If not (for her owne sake,) yet for Persicles thy King, whom shee loueth, and thou shouldest obey. Were it quoth hee, to venture my life for my Prince, I would most willingly doe it, and if the Lady loueth him, and for that hath left the Court, I will hazard my life in her defence: and to my vttermost power procure her hearts desire. Then know Pisor , that Persicles heareth thy kinde speeches and hath not failed in his kinde opinion, of thy vertues: For I am he, though thus disguised, With that Pisor knew him, and humbled himselfe with great reuerence vnto him vpon his Knee. Persicles rising vp, embraced him, telling him that he came in a most Fortunate houre to doe him pleasure. Constantia with this, was comforted againe, and forgot her former passion of feare. The old Shepheard and his wife were halfe amazed, vntill Persicles said: Father, be not any way disquieted with my knowledge: for though I am King of Assyria , I am thy Guest, and will for thy kindnesse reward thee liberally: desiring thee not to discouer me to any: For if thou shouldest, it might hazard this Ladies life and mine: that are now in thy hands. With that, they both kneeled downe, vowing that nothing would make them so disloyall. Then he said to Pisor , of old experience I know thou louest me, and therefore I make no question of thy Fidelity, or doubt that thou wilt vndertake any thing to pleasure me. Therefore I would haue thee (with as much haste as might be) to Post into Assyria , vnto Parenus and Thrureus , whom I left my substitutes, and to them make my estate knowne: telling them, that my desire is, that they come to me into this place, with a sufficient number of Horsemen to Guard me, and the Princesse Constantia home: but to let none know their intent: which I take is the best course for our safety. For if we should seeke other meanes by trauell, Constantia is not able to endure it: which also might be a meanes to discouer vs, so many being abroad in our search. Pisor presently obeyed him, and taking his leaue, departed: whom we will leaue onwards of his Iourney, and Persicles and Constantia in the Shepheards-cottage. How Helyon was in loue with Selia , and hearing of his Fathers sicknes, obtained leaue to depart. And of the Desolation that was befallen in Assiria , by the treason of Duke Oretus . see her againe: with whom he was more deeply in Loue, then euer he was with Constantia : for the Loue he before bare to her, was turned to hatred: and the cause of his importunacie to the King to haue her found, was with a malicious disposition of Reuenge: not of any Honourable inclination, being of such variable and inconstant Nature, that the least occasion altered his wauering minde, either to loue or hatred: Which was vnfit for a man of so great a birth as he deriued himselfe from. And now hauing past many dayes, colouring his pretence vnder the shadow of fained sorrow, he longed to visite his Louer Selia . Therefore finding a time set for his intent, he with his Seruant Aldrus , rode thither. At his comming, finding Selia , againe cloathed in her Countrey-Weedes. Who espying him, with a modest blush came to meet him: Whom he imbraced most kindely in his armes, asking her how shee fared? My Lord (sayd she) your Hand-mayde reioyceth to see your worthy person, in this homely Cottage, whose heart can attaine no quyet, but by your remembrance. By this time, her Parents were come in, who seeing the Prince, did him humble reuerence: He likewise saluting them with great curtesie. When he had stayed there most part of the day in priuate conference with his Loue, hee departed: The next day repayring thither againe. Which hee likewise did for many dayes after. In the end, growing to such extremity of passion, that he told Selia , hee would Marrie her: and withall, made her Parents acquainted therewith, who willingly gaue their consent thereto: and by this meanes, he enioyed her company at all times according to his desire. In this sort did hee visite her many dayes, doting exceedingly on his Countrey Selia , thinking no Ladie in the Court comparable vnto her, and likewise dissembling exceeding griefe for Constantia so that the King highly commended his constancy, esteeming him the more for not altering his minde. Within few dayes, Newes was brought to the Persian -Court, that the King of Arabia was very sicke: which caused Helyon to desire the King of Persias consent, to his departure: which hee graunted: first hauing receiued his faithfull Oath to Marrie Constantia , which he sware to performe at his returne. Most of the Knights that went in search of Constantia were returned, not one of them bringing Newes of her: Which draue the King into such a rage, that he seemed quite bereft of sence: causing them to make more open Enquirie, and to promise great Reward to those that could tell of her. By this time likewise Pisor had beene in Assyria , and againe returned to the Shepheards house: Whom Persicles welcommed, as glad that he was so soone returned. But Pisors countenance bewrayed some ill Newes, which Persicles soone perceiued: and being vnwilling Constantia should heare ought that might breed in her any discontent, walked aside with him into the Thicket of a Wood, hard by the house, where Pisor sayd: My Lord, I haue a Tragicke discourse to reueale, that maketh my heart melt to thinke thereof: which I would had not been my ill Fortune to haue brought you newes of. At my comming into Assyria , I passed many myles before I found an Assyrian to conuerse withall: For that the Townes and Uillages which before were repleat with store of Inhabitants, were now consumed by Fire, and not a house standing alone, but was dispoyled, and the people from their dwellings fled away, which caused me make the more haste: hoping that all was not destroyed. And comming more neare the Court, in my way I found the bodies of the Assyrians lying dead, and confusedly strowed vpon the Earth, as if some battell had beene lately fought in that place: Those which lay dead, seeming to haue fled to saue their liues. And the farther I past, the more did the number increase: which I followed so long, that I was perswaded, those that destroyed them were not farre off, but yet went so fast before me, that I could not ouertake them, for the bodyes of some were not yet cold, and others lay strugling to ouer- master Death. Wherewith I was so amazed, that I set spurres to my Steeds sides, and rode with all the hast I could, vntill at last I espyed a mighty Army of Souldiers, right before me, vpon the Mount Silo , whose multitude seemed to be innumerable. Neare vnto which, I was no sooner come, but I espyed an Assyrian wounded grieuously, to whom I drew nigh, and soone knew him to be Parenus , and discouering my selfe vnto him, desired him to tell me what Treason had brought him to that dangerous estate. With that he knowing me, sayd. Pisor , such misery is befalne vs Assirians , as wee shall be a reproach and scandall to all the World: Which I would repeate, but before that I can make an end, Death will stop my speech: therefore first tell me how my Lady Piera fareth? Noble Duke (said I) she is in good health, and in great prosperity. I reioyce thereat (quoth hee,) though I haue otherwise euerlasting cause to sorrow. For our Soueraigne Lord the King, after he had put the Armenians to flight, was very desirous vpon some occasion (as yet vnknowne) to leaue the Court, in his absence committing the gouernment thereof to my vnhappy selfe, and that Noble Knight Thrureus , which we performed with great quiet: vntill Duke Oretus , one that was neuer true to the State, hearing of the Kings departure, which we could by no meanes conceale, raised a false report, that we two had murthered the King: Which Rumor moued the Common-people to such disquiet, that they beganne to Rebell: Which he perceiuing (ayming thereby to winne the Crowne,) gathered a great multitude of them together, with pretence of reuenge against vs, which when we heard off, with all the hast we could possible, we Mustered men for our defence: but so eager were the multitude to our destruction, together with Oretus perswasions, that before we were any way able to resist them, they set vpon vs, and shed a great number of their owne Country-mens blood, that stood in our defence, and draue vs to immure our selues within the Citie, The King of Armenia hearing of this rebellion, with great speed brought a mighty great Army into this Land, destroying all that came in his way, burning both Townes and Cities, and destroying the common people with an exceeding great Slaughter. Which came to Oretus hearing, with such terror, that he presently fled, and left his Confederate Rebels to be destroyed by the Enemy: Which caused vs by a Herauld to demaund whether they would submit themselues to vs or no? or by their treason to see theyr Countries ruine? With that they yeelded, and we gathered all the Forces we could to resist the Enemies, with whom we fought three great Battels, and in the same lost aboue thirty thousand Assirians , being driuen to flight: this day againe gathering head to resist them: but being too few in number, in respect of their strength and multitude, you see how our bodies be scattered vpon the Earth, mangled and cut in pieces: My selfe being I thinke, the last that liueth to tell this newes. For the Noble Thrureus is already slaine, whose deedes of Ualour would containe a great volume: Which newes when our King shall heare, it will no doubt cut off his vertuous life with sorrow. My greatest griefe being that I cannot heare of his safety before my death. My Lord, said I, our gracious King is liuing, and in good health in Persia , who sent me vnto your Honour and Thrureus , with a secret Message which I neede not now vnfold. Yes good Pisor , (quoth he) let me heare my Lords Message, that I may thereby know whether I were still in his fauour or no. With that I vnfolded the cause of my comming: Which heard, such a passion of discontent ouercame his vitall spirits, that with many bitter groanes he gaue vp the Ghost. When I saw there was no meanes for his recouery, I departed, to enquire what slaughter the Enemy had made, who by that time the day was ended, had vanqueshed the Assyrian forces, taking the Citty, and most of the Nobility Prisoners. I stayed some foure dayes, hiding me secretly to bring you certaine Newes, which is this. The King of Armenia compelled the Noble men to sweare Allegeance vnto Palyon , his eldest Sonne, whom he hath crowned King in Assiria , and left a mighty Army for his defence. When I vnderstood this, I returned to certifie your Highnes thereof. How Persicles hearing the newes by Pisor , hee departed into a solitary place, and thereby caused the vnfortunate separation betweene him and Constantia , who in great sorrow wandring to seeke him, was found by Helyon , and carried into Arabia . And of the many sorrowes Persicles endured for her absence. How Pisor became franticke. Newes, that he had much adoe to containe himselfe from extreame madnesse: that he minded a while to withdraw himselfe, to vtter his plaints in those solitary walks: but seeing Pisor follow him, he desired him to returne to the Shepheards house, and in no case to accquaint Constantia with these misfortunes. But if she asked for him, he should tell her he would come presently. Pisor being departed, he sought for the most vnfrequented place of the Wood, wandring long in that discontent, but could find none agreeable to his mind: neither knowing whether he went, nor almost what he intended: his sences being dulled with such passionate vexation, continuing so long therein, that he spent longer time in seeking out a place of rest, then he was aware of, which turned to his greater vnrest, as afterwards it fell out. For Constantia maruelling that he stayed so long, and withall noting Pisors darkened countenance, supposed some ill newes was the cause of both, finding occasion fit, thought to find her Loue in the midst of his dumps, and with her amiable presence to comfort him, stole from the Cottage into the Wood, where Pisor told her that he had left him: Where she wandered vp and downe a great while, not finding him, which made her maruell, sometimes calling him, but not by his right name, least any should heare her: and finding that meanes to preuaile nothing, she began to enter into many doubtfull thoughts; sometimes calling his Loyalty in question, then againe, reprouing her fancies, for entring into suspition of him, then thinking some ill newes was befaln in Assyria , which might driue him into a carelesse desperation, and also fearing that some of the Persian Knights had met with him, and finding some likelyhood of suspition in him, had carried him to the King her Father. These Meditations possest her mind so long, and wrought such a terrour in her fancies, that she faird like one that had beene possest with the truth, that it was so. Thus did they both continue most part of that day, she seeking him, and he opprest with care, not remembring that it was time to returne home, yet both of them directing their steps a contrary way, that they met not, but wandred a from one another. At last, he began to remember where he was, how long he had beene absent, and what care she would take for his absence, which caused him with as much speed to hast backe, as with carelesnesse he had wandred vp  & down, which before he could attaine, it grew to be towards Night. Pisor likewise maruelling at his long stay, and at Constantiaes sudden departure, fearing that some ill might betide him, and some extraordinary care oppresse her, left the Cottage to find him, and if he could meet her, to direct her to the place where he left him. When Persicles found them both absent, he maruelled thereat: Enquiring of the old Woman when they departed: who told him that Constantia went first out, and he after her. Which made him thinke, that she missing him so long, might goe to seeke him: and Pisor followed her, thinking to direct her, least she should wander astray, as she might well doe in those vnfrequented places. But when he had a long time continued in those dumps, and saw neither of them returne, he began to enter into many misdoubts, such as proceed from the vnquiet motions of distempered thoughts: being fearefull to depart thence againe, least he might so misse them. Pisor being entred the Wood, came to the place where he had left Persicles , but could neyther find him there, nor Constantia , which made him wander vp and downe so long, that he was weary: At last comming to a shady place, and laying himselfe downe to rest, casting vp his eyes, espyed most beautifull fruit vpon a Tree, hanging right ouer his head: The sight whereof pleased him so well, that plucking some of the same, he found the taste pleasant, which caused him to eate many of them: which made him presently, to fall into a deadly sleepe. The name of the Fruit is called Pilos , the nature whereof is, to procure those that taste thereof, first to sleepe, without awaking, for the space of foure and twenty houres, and after to become Franticke, for the space of three Moneths, which hindred Pisor from returning. When Persicles had stayed so long expecting their returne, vntill it beganne to be darke, he againe went out, telling the Shepheard that he was going to seeke them: cruell Fortune directing his steps directly to the place whereas Pisor lay sleeping, whom he beheld, and neyther by calling, nor by any other meanes could awake him: a deadly feare possest his Fancie, that some furious Beast had slaine him, and eyther deuoured Constantia , or pursued her, flying from him; Which caused him like a Franticke man to draw forth Pisors Sword, running vp and downe to seeke that which was not there to be found. Constantia by this time was wandred so farre in search of Persicles , that she could by no meanes tell which way to returne againe, but she was constrained all that night to wander vp and down, with hope to haue returned. But contrary to her thought, going a quite contrary way, her fears and care causing her to make the more speed: that being wearied with trauell, comming to the out-side of the Wood, shee sate downe vpon a Banke, and there, after she had bewailed her miserable estate, and wearied her sences with sorrow, as she had her body with trauell, she fell asleepe. Now it so fell out, that Helyon the day before, had taken his leaue of the King of Persia , to trauell into Arabia , and that Night lay at Seliaes Fathers, causing her to be attired in rich Ornaments, that morning carried her with him into Arabia , intending there to make her his Bride: and by misfortune, past by the place where Constantia lay fast a sleepe: some of his followers soone espied her, and shewed her to Helyon. Selia likewise seeing her, presently told Helyon that her Apparell was eyther the same which Constantias Gentlewoman tooke from her in the Persian Court or so like it, that she could not know one from the other. Helyon himselfe rode to her and awaked her, by his former disposition, and her countenance, which was still in his remembrance, perfectly knowing her. She likewise at the very first sight knowing him, which amased her sences with deadly feare. To whom he said: My deare Constantia , What hath caused you thus discourteously to reiect my Loue, and leaue the Persian Court, to endure this hard Fortune, so much disagreeing to your Estate? Yet at length I beseech you accept of my Loue, and goe with me into Arabia . Leaue of your dissembling speeches (quoth Constantia ) and let me alone: For I had rather all my life lye on this cold Earth, then liue in all ease with you. With that shee would haue left him, but he commaunded his Seruants to take her by force into the Coach, and so carry her along with him into Arabia : not letting any know what she was, but onely his Selia . When Constantia saw that of force she must needs goe, she vttered such plaints, and made such sorrowfull exclamations, that those which guarded her, thought shee would haue fallen madde: though neither knowing her, nor her cause of sorrow, yet inwardly in their hearts pittying her. Whom we will leaue, fully possest with the vttermost extremity of anguish, onwards towards Arabia , the place shee most of all loathed, to speake of Persicles , who in a madde fury hauing runne vp and down a great while in the Wood, againe returned into the shepheards house, see if Constantia were not yet returned, but there he found onely the Shepheard and his Wife in great care, awayting his returne: who espying the Sword in his hand, and his face and hands in many places bloudy, which was with the scratches he had receiued in the darke Wood, were ready to run from him for feare: but he mildly demaunded if Constantia were yet come backe, who told him they saw her not? Alas (qd. hee) poore Ladie, I feare she is deuoured by some mercilesse Beast: For I found Pisor lying dead in the Wood: Which affrighteth me with such feare of her mishap, that I know not what to doe, nor which way to goe in her search. My Lord (said the olde Shepheard) I can assure you, there doth no Wilde Beast haunt this Wood, for then could not my flockes feede in quyet: of which I haue not lost one Lambe by any casualtie: but rather I thinke my Lady missing you all the day, is wandred so farre into the Wood, that she cannot returne, nor you finde her: whom I doe not doubt but to finde in the Morning: neither is he dead, but I belieue hath tasted some of our vnlucky fruit called Pylos , that hath cast him into a dead sleepe, and after that he will be Franticke for a certaine space. Persicles was wonderfully comforted with the Shepheards speeches, yet notwithstanding leauing him, and all that Night wandring vp and downe the Wood to finde her, but he spent his labour in vaine, neyther that night nor the next day finding her, which draue him so farre beyond the compasse of naturall continencie, that if hee remained long in that extreame perplexity, it would cut of his life. When hee saw himselfe voyde of all hope, without meanes how to finde her, and assurance that she was not within the Wood, he layde him downe vpon the earth, vttering these laments. How fortunate had I been had I neuer set foote in ye Persian soyle? the had I still bin King of Assyria , & Constantia in quiet in her Fathers Court: wheras now, both I, but especially her selfe, are fallen into extreame misery. Had it onely falne to my share to haue indured a thousand more misfortunes, I could with patience haue endured them: onely this tormenteth mee, that my misfortune hath brought her from Weale to woe: from quiet to discontent: from pleasure, to paine: from happinesse to misery, and from life to death. I cannot tell how to preuent these euils, to sit here, and vtter sad words auaileth me not: to bewaile her estate, helpeth her: nor to destroy my selfe, will benefit her: should I sit still heere, so shall I neuer finde her: and to seeke for her out of this place, is to spend my Labours without hope of comfort. For I feare me she is dead, and then may I sooner meete her Ghost in this place, then her Body in another. Well, since neither comfort nor counsell is left to further my hopes, I will for euer dwell in this vnfortunate place, and fill the same with my Laments: neither shall my Body rest in bed, nor my stomacke tast of other meat then Wilde fruit, vntill I finde my Loue, or be assured of the place of her abode. Thus liued hee in those Woods many dayes, and many yeares, making euery Tree a monument of Constantias vnfortunate losse, though he were often disswaded by Pisor , who afterwards trauelled most parts of all those Countryes in search of her, but could neuer heare of her. The King of Persia had likewise giuen ouer all care of Constantia , as supposing her to be dead: greatly lamenting the misfortunes of Persicles , and maruelling at his absence, beleeuing verily that he was murthered, according to the accusation made by Oretus , against Parenus and Thrureus . Whom we will all leaue for a while, to speake of the misfortunes befell to Constantia . How Selia was married to Helyon , and of the miseries Constantia endured by her iealousie. How Constantia was deliuered of a goodly Boy: whose life was preserued by the pollicie of Palia , and how Selia vexed thereat. Fathers death, which for a time he lamented of common course, not of pietie or affection: in the meane time, causing Constantia to be kept in the old Monasterie vnder the gouernment of an ancient Ladie, that liued not onely by the gifts of the King bestowed vpon her, for many badde actions, but also of many Gentle-men that haunted the Company of the Kings Concubines by stealth. In this place did he put Constantia , neyther her Keeper, nor any other knowing what she was: Who by this time had resolued to endure any aduersity, for many dayes giuing her selfe to quiet, for that by reason of his counterfeit mourning, he came not at her. But the time being come that he was Crowned King, and on the same day likewise married Selia , causing poore Constantia as one of her Handmaides ta attend her: Which he did of a malicious intent, onely to vexe her: but she was well contented to doe any thing to rid her of his hatefull Loue, whom she abhorred in the very depth of her Soule. But when he saw she endured the same with such Patience, he againe caused her to be closely kept in that Monastery: giuing commandement that none but the old Lady named Palia , should come at her. Thus did she continue, vntill she beganne to feele her selfe with Child by Persiclos , which draue her to the vttermost exigent of care, how to preserue her Infants life: Sometimes purposing to make her estate knowne to Palia , but hauing sufficient tryall of her wicked disposition, she durst not trust her, least she should reueale the same to the King. Selya likewise at that very instant was great with Child by Helyon , both Conceiuing at one instant, the one in the Persian Court, and the other in the Shepheards cottage. Selia made Helyon acquainted therewith, desiring that she might be deliuered thereof in some priuate place, where the Ladyes of the Court might not know thereof, which would turne to her euerlasting scandall. Helyon well knowing the nature of the people, in what detestable sort they held adultery in their Queene, thought no place so fit for the accomplishment thereof, as in the Monastery where Constantia was, vnto which place she was soone conueyed: report being giuen out by the Kings command, that she was for the preseruation of her health, secretly departed into the Country. The Queene being come into the Monastery, asked for Constantia , who was presently brought before her, whom Selia now began to hate mortally, being very Iealous of her, and supposing that the King still Loued her: whom she vsed so disdainfully vpbrayding her with many vndecent speeches. Which Constantia tooke most patiently, only with Teares lamenting her misfortunes. And so proudly and scornefully did she behaue her selfe towards Palia , and all that attended her, that they began to dislike of her. Palia seeing the pride of the Queene, and in what disdainfull sort she vsed her, accusing her to be priuy to the Kings secret loue to Constantia , vsing her so distrustfully, and with such euill tearmes, began to hate her. Which Constantia perceiued by some doubtfull speeches she gaue out against her. Whereupon, finding a fit opportunity, when she was vexed with her vnkindnesse, she came to Palia , and said: I perceiue the Queene vseth you but vnkindly, regarding to vse none well, though they giue her no cause at all. She likewise misuseth me, that neuer in my life offended her, but haue beene the greatest cause of her good. I would gladly intreat your ayd, and withall reueale many things vnto you, that you yet know not, if I were assured of your secrecie: which I am the more fearfull to reueale, for that they are matters of importance, wherein notwithstanding if you would vouchsafe your assistance to pitty my miserable estate, you shall doe a deed of euerlasting merit. Palia hearing her speeches, sayd: If I may likewise without feare make my minde knowne vnto you, be you assured I doe so mortally hate her, that rewardeth my dutifull seruice with disdaine, that I will not leaue any thing vnattempted to vexe her, and pleasure you: therefore if an Oath may assure you of my secrecie, hauing no other meanes at this instant to giue proofe thereof, I vow by all the good I euer expect, neuer to reueale what you disclose to me, but most faithfully labour to pleasure you to my power. Then know (qd. Constantia ) that I am Daughter to the King of Persia , sometimes brought vp in this Court: and your Queene but the Daughter of a Countrey-Swaine in Persia , that being exalted to dignity, though basely borne, behaueth her selfe thus proudly: I fearing my Father would haue married me to Helyon against my will, hauing betrothed my selfe to the King of Assyria , with him stole from the Court in this Apparell of Selia , that is now your Queene: much search was made for me, but they could neuer finde me: for I liued with my Lord in this disguise in a Shepheards house, vntill one day I missing him strayed so farre from the House, that I could not returne, but by misfortune was found by Helyon , and thus as you see brought into this Countrey, either to my death or to a worser end. I am likewise great with Child, and within short space shall be deliuered. My earnest desire is, that you would vse some meanes to preserue my Babe from death, which no doubt it is likely to endure by her malice and his cruelty. Palia hauing heard her speeches, Reuerenced her, comforted her, and promised her with many Uowes and Protestations, to fulfill her desire, thereby to worke some reuenge against the Queene. In her heart pitying the distresse of Constantia , of whose Uertues she had before times some knowledge. With this Promise did Constantia somewhat comfort her selfe, hoping yet in the end to escape from that Bondage, being daily cherished by old Palia : who behaued her selfe towards Selia , with such duty and obedience, notwithstanding her often vpbraydings, that she still kept her selfe in most place of credit about her. The Day being now come that the Queene was deliuered of a goodly Boy, and Constantia the next Night of another, none being priuy thereto but Palia , who handled the matter with such cunning, that she conueyed Constantiaes Child to Selia , and hers to Constantia , making her acquainted with her intent therein. The next day declaring to Helyon , how that the Damzell in her custody was deliuered of a Boy. Helyon hearing that, willing her to keepe the same secret from any, vpon paine of death: Not so much as once to reueale it to the Queene, vowing ere many dayes to destroy it. Giuing Order to haue his owne Christened, naming him Petus : And comming to the Queene, told her it were best to be Nursed in the Countrey, who was contented to be ruled by him. Then calling to him Palia , he told her, that she must needs prouide a Nurse for his Sonne, who already hauing complotted what she intended, told him that she knew a Kins-woman of hers, that was lately brought to Bed, some twenty miles off in the Countrey, to whom she would (if it liked him) conuey the Infant. Helyon was glad of her promise, appointing her all things fit for her departure, the next morning. Late in the Euening, when Palia was sure none could see her, she went to Constantia , telling her what she had intended: Withall, asking her counsell what hee should doe. Aye me (quoth Constantia ) I know not in this extremity what to resolue vpon, fearing neuer to see my Sonne againe: and if thou goest loosing my greatest comfort. Then taking the Childe in her armes, and bestowing many Teare-wet kisses thereon, she said Palia , I pray thee let me know what thou intendest to doe with it? Lady (quoth she) if you perswade me not to the contrary, after I am departed this Court, I will neuer leaue trauelling vntill I arriue in Assyria : where I doe not doubt but to find Persicles , vnto whom I will declare your misfortunes: But if I finde him not there, I will then Trauell into Persia , to the place where you lost him, where I shall then assuredly find him: that he (knowing your estate) may seeke to release you. And wilt thou doe this for me (sayd Constantia ) that am neuer likely to make thee amends? I will (qd. Palia ) and with such faithfulnesse execute the charge I vndertake, as shall turne to thy euerlasting quiet. Many speeches past betwixt them before they parted, but yet in the end she was constrained to leaue Constantia , almost dead with griefe, but afterwards somewhat comforted, with the good hope she had of her faithfull dealing: Of two euils thinking it the best to commit the Babe to her custody, who by all likelyhoods intended well thereto. Earely the next Morning Palia departed, hauing none in her Company, with all the hast she could trauelling towards Assyria . Helyon , now beganne to meditate on Constantia's Fortune, and who should be the Father of her Childe: and whereas before he determined to penne her vp in that Cloyster, vntill she would yeeld to his desire, he now resolued to reuenge the disdaine she had showne, in refusing his Loue, with all Cruelty: that finding occasion when none could interrupt his speeches, being alone with her in her chamber, he thus sayd. Disdainefull and discourteous Lady, did you esteeme so basely of my Loue, in my contempt, to choose some base-borne Peasant, to possesse that which I long sought with such deuoted affection: and refusing my Honorable proffer, to chuse rather to become anothers Harlot. Who would euer haue thought thy comely person shadowed with so faire a pretext, had inwardly nourished such innoble affections. Doe you thinke the King of Persia will reioyce to heare that his faire Daughter Constantia , (that may well be termed Incontinencie) hath so vildely slained her Princely blood and defamed her Royall stocke, with so infamous a fact, or not rather dye with griefe, Therefore to preuent so great a mischiefe as will come by his death, I will be the meane to keep thy fact from coming to his knowledge, and in his behalfe, worke such Reuenge as shall be agreeable, to so great an offence. Yet let me know the cause of thy contempt against mee, and who is the Father of thy bastard? Which if thou refusest to doe by gentle meanes to vnfold, I will by force compell thee therunto. Constantia with Patience heard out his speeches, and with as great Patience answered him. Helyon , I can well beare your Opprobrious speeches, neyther will I impugne how scandalous they are: For the Father of this Infant is as good as your selfe and him I Loue, farre more honourable and vertuous then Helyon , King of Arabia , who ensureth mee according to the qualitie of his owne disposition. The reason I left my Fathers Court, was to auoide your importunate suite, which was vnpleasing to me, in respect of the honourable Loue I embraced: therefore beware you abuse not Constantia . For though the King of Persia will not reuenge my wrongs, yet there is a King as mighty as hee, claymeth my possession, and will not suffer me to be iniuried. What? is a King the Father of that Bastard (qd. he?) No, thou shalt neuer perswade mee to that, for it looketh not like a King, but as the perfect Image of a Foole. Yea (said Constantia ,) and yet a King as wise as thy selfe, and that ere long thou shalt know, for the Father thereof is priuy to all thy Actions, although thou thinkest me safely kept. And if thou doest murther it, I care not, for thy selfe will be the first that shall repent the deede. And for mee, vse me well, for the Father of this Childe loueth thee well, and yet thou wilt be thine owne destruction in seeking his death. Helyon vnderstood not her meaning, maruelling who it should be she meant, that he sayd: I thinke thou art madde, or conterfeytest some deceyt by the ambiguitie of thy speeches: for how can the Father of that Brat loue me? Or what cause should there be to make me repent any thing that I should doe to it: Which the rather shall suffer my wrath, because of thy derisions: Therefore resolue me, or be assured of my euerlasting hatred. I neither (said she) regard thee, nor thy hate: vtterly denying to fulfill thy request in any respect. Yet if thou hadst not demanded it, I would peraduenture haue told it thee: Doe the worst thou canst, I care not for miserie, it selfe hath made me so resolute to endure the greatest extremitie. And know, that I so much the more dislike this Babe, because it is like thee, that hath no sparke of honour or honesty in thee. Aske me no more questions, for I will not answer thereto, esteeming my selfe more fortunate in thy hatred, then thy friendship: for the one is but the distemperate motion of a Cowardly disposition, and the other, the inconstant falshood of a shallow- Wit. Helyon was much vexed to see how lightly she esteemed him that almost ready to teare his haire, hee went raging and swearing from her, meditating which way to worke his Reuenge. Selia noting his distemperature, by his pale Countenance, asked him what had disquieted him? To whom he gaue no answere at all, casting a scornfull looke towards her: which she tooke in such suspitious sort, that she presently supposed he did it in scorne of her, and her heart being puft vp full of Iealousie, could not detaine it selfe, from bursting forth into Teares, and then into these speeches. My Lord, I now perceiue the Loue you protested to beare me, is altered, and I like a poore Cast-away, like to liue in misery: would to God I had still liued in my contented estate in Persia , then should I not haue beene subiect to these misfortunes. Constantia whom you tolde me loued you not, is she that hath stolne away your Affection, and on her you dote, despising me: wherein you shew the inconstancie of your variable disposition: besides, she hath disclosed what I am, and that maketh me be scorned and despised of the Ladies of this Court, that the misery I am like to endure is intollerable. Doe not (said he) disquyet your selfe with the least suppose of such alteration in me: for by Heauen I vow, I loue none but your selfe: the cause of my vexation is, how to reuenge my selfe on Constantia , that euen now hath vsed me with opprobrious terms. Besides, she is brought to Bed of a Bastard, begotten of some base-borne Peasant, which shall not liue long to vexe me. I would I had left her in Persia , to haue beene deuoured by wilde-beasts, rather then pittying her, for to worke my selfe this disquiet. Should I send word to the King of Persia , he would compell me to marry her, or else bring open Warre against my Kingdome: or if I should seeke her death, the knowledge thereof would by some meanes come to his hearing, and then would he seeke reuenge against me: that in this extremity, I know not which way to ridde my selfe from her. Selia , hearing him say she had a Bastard, presently beganne to suspect it was his: which she would then haue vttered, but that feare and premeditated hope of reuenge against Constantia , withheld her, thinking first to learne the truth before she would offend him: perceiuing his inconstant disposition to be such, that the least thing altered his Loue: deferring the same vntill her Moneth was ended, by which meanes Constantia rested voyd of disturbance. The flame of enuious suspition, burnt so furiously in her brest, that as soone as she had forsaken the Monastery, and had a while with all kindnesse behaued her selfe towards the Nobles and Ladies of most estimation, thereby to insinuate into their good opinion, she came to Constantia , fawning vpon her with an affable countenance, & vsing many speeches of courtesie towards her, with intent to sift out the truth of her suspition. Helyon , hearing that she was in the Monastery, fearing she would haue done Constantia some violence, followed her, and found her in quiet conference with her. Selia seeing him there, was halfe astonished, supposing he had not knowne thereof: and withall, now of a truth suspecting that he came to visit Constantia of Loue, and not to seeke her: againe burst foorth into teares, whereon he tooke occasion to say, Selia , I perceiue suspition is the cause of your disquiet: Therefore to shew what little cause you haue to vse me so, doe but say what I shall doe to this dishonourable Lady, and I will performe it. Constantia then began to feare some mischiefe was neare her, which might easily haue been perceiued by the oft change of her countenance: who made this reply. Helyon , if thy Queene knew how much I disdained thee, such motions of suspect for me, would not disquiet her: For I contemne thy base dispositions, which is ready to alter with the blast of euery inconstant winde. Or Selia doest thou thinke that my minde wil stoupe to his base lust, or become Concubine to so degenerate a wretch, and to thy Husband? No, I will rather see thy bodie torne into pieces, and suffer the cruellest misery in the World: he threatned me with terrible speeches, but his Cowards hart is not of courage to execute his detested will. Therefore thou that peraduenture art of a more hardy and inhumane disposition, commest to encourage him to mischiefe: doe the worst you can both, for I feare you not, but would gladly be ridde out of this miserable life. And ridde thou shall soone be (said Selia ,) notwithstanding thy counterfeit dissimulation, thinking with disdainefull speeches to colour thy wickednes: I am indeed come to be reuenged on thee, that crossest my content, and first shall that Bastard feele the smart of thy wrath: then catching the Child out of the cradle where it lay, she held the same by the Heeles in the one hand, and the knife in the other, ready to depriue it of life, vntill Helyon wihtheld her, and Constantia sayd, Nay, Let her murther it, and let her selfe be the first that will repent it: yet first view it well, and see if it resemble not the Father that standeth by: I assure thee it is his, and that thou shalt soone know. Out vpon thee (sayd Helion ) I defie thee. With that Selia viewed it well, and perceiued that it resembled him perfectly, wherewith she cast the same on the Earth, saying: Did you bring me hither to doe me this intollerable wrong? Shall I suffer my selfe to be thus abused, and liue to endure perpetuall discontent? The Peers of this Land shall vnderstand the wrongs I sustaine, and if none else, mine owne hands shall worke reuenge. Constantia then said, Selia , take vp the Infant, and cherish it, for it is thine owne: My childe by this time is conueyed farre enough from thy power, by Palia , who pittying my distresse, and scorning to be subiect to the base Pride, hath enterchanged one for the other, leauing thine with mee, and carrying my Infant into Assyria , vnto the Kigg Persicles , who is Father thereof, who I doe not doubt, will soone reuenge the wrong is done to me: Neither doe thou iealously suspect me for that degenerate K: thy Husband: for shee that is Daughter to the King of Persia , scorneth to be thy Corriuall: If I had dealt vnfaithfully with him, then might he worthily haue inflicted this punishment vpon me: but his owne Conscience knoweth I alwayes refused to yeeld to loue him, my Loue being before vowed to the King of Assyria . Both of them were amazed at her speeches, Selia with haste taking vp her sonne, that lay, sprawling at her feet, almost halfe dead with crying: and Helyon after a deepe study, saying: Constantia , I perceiue thou knowest not how vnable the King of Assyria is to redeeme thee from hence, being lately dispossest of his Crowne by the King of Armenia , and by the Treason of his owne Subjects, being himselfe driuen to liue in obscurity. Therefore this will I doe in satisfaction of my mind against thee: thou shalt neuer depart from hence, but in this Cloyster end thy life, vnlesse the most valiantest Knight in the World redeem thee: for such a sure Guard will I set ouer thee, as shall be ouercome by none. Constantia was no whit grieued to heare that Doome of her Imprisonment, but onely the suspect she had of his speeches of Persicles , ouercame her heart with such feare, that she fell downe into a deadly trance: Those that were about her, hauing much adoe to recouer her. Wherewith they left her: Helyon giuing command that most diligent search should be made for Palia , through the whole Countrey of Arabia . How Helyon built an Enchanted Tower, and put Constantia therein. How he was imprisoned therein himselfe in great misery, by the Enchantresse Ila. Within few Dayes after, Helyon purposing to effect that which he had Uowed, calling all the cunningst Workemen of his Land before him, asking their aduice, about building a Castle of inuincible strength, which they promised him to performe: and so began to Worke, scituating the same vpon a Rockie-hill of exceeding largenes, that was encompassed with a Lake of exceeding depth. First encompassing the circuit of the ground, with a wall framed of the hardest Marble, of such smoothnes without, and height, that it was not to be ascended Ouer the Lake they framed a Bridge of exceeding beauty, placing at the entrance two Porches or Fortifications: betwixt them setting a Gate of Brasse, curiously wrought, with carued images of Lyons, being the Armes of Arabia , On the midst they placed a Draw-bridge, drawne vp by such deuices, as the labour of one man was able to doe the same with speed. At the further end of the Bridge, was their builded a most curious wrought Gate-house, garnished with stones of sundry colours, and exceeding strange: The entrance thereto was another Gate of Brasse, farre exceeding the first, for beauty, bignesse, and strength, in the midst aboue the top thereof, were placed in the carued forme of six Golden Lyons of exceeding bignes, whose proportion might be discerned farre off. Within this Porch was there a large Court, encompassed round with Turrets, Walls, and Fortifications: within the compasse whereof, an Army of Souldiers might lye Encamped. The next Entrance, was three gates of Brasse, carued like the other two: ouer which was built a Tower of wonderfull Beauty and workmanship framed of Adamant, cut out and carued into the forms of sorts of Beasts, Trees, Hearbs, and Fowles: the beauty whereof, would haue held the beholder in admiration: on the tops whereof, were built foure Pinacles in a Squadrant, whose glistering Uaines and carued worke, shone against the Sunne, as if the same had beene framed of beaten Gold. Within this Tower, was there a Court, encompassed round about with most rich and stately Buildings, hauing seuerall doores into euery building of an inuincible strength, framed all of one proportion, guilded ouer with Gold. The Window of an exceeding largenes and beauty: supported by two Lyons of carued Allablaster, guilded ouer with Gold: On the top next to the Eues two Cherubs standing in forme of Angels, of carued Gold, supporting the Picture of a beautifull Lady: the Windowes discouering the exceeding richnesse of the Chambers within. In the midst of this Court, was framed a cleere Fountaine, with diuers streames of water, springing from the same, curiously carued, and guilded ouer with Gold: the brightnesse glistering such a reflection of the Sunnes beames round about, that at the first entrance it would haue dazeled the beholders eyes. At the further end of this Court was there a Hall of exceeding largenes, supported within, with Pillars of Geate, beset with stones of sundry colours, and exceeding richnes, the Skreene being framed of the most curious worke of carued-Wood: the Noose of Stone, wherein were coloured out the formes of all kinds of Fruits: the Wals hung with Rich-Hangings of Arras , containing the Histories of the Warres of Troy . In the midst of this Hall, was fastned two Pillars, whereto were chained two Lyons of huge bignes, and wonderfull strength, denying any farther Entrance. The farther end of the Hall, was without any Wall at all, supported by Pillars of the same Geate, lying open into a Garden of exceeding largenesse, which at the first entrance into the Hall was gloriously discerned. In which were made Walks of Pleasure, Arbors, borders of Flowers, the forms of all things cut out in Pearbs: Flowers to delight the Eye, please the smell, and of strange formes, and all things so curiously wrought, as was strange to behold. In the midst of this Garden, stood a Banqueting-house of round proportion, the foundation supported by 4. Lyons of carued blew Stone, called Ayres : The Windowes round about that encompassed the same, through which the Light passed cleerely passed without impediment: the Pillars, Casements, and other proportions of such excellent workmanship, that it seemed to be altogether framd of Christall On the top of this house stood the forme of an Angell framed of beaten Gold, pointing with his finger towards the other Lodgings of wonderfull rich Building. At the farther end of the Garden, the description whereon is hereafter set down. When Helyon had finished this worke, he called vnto him, one called Penthrasus , an ancient professor of Necromancy and with him alone, went vnto the Pallace, shewing the same, and why he had built it, desiring his Counsell and ayd to the performance of his Will. Penthrasus desirous likewise to practise his Art, which before he durst not doe, for by the Lawes of the Land, the same was punished with death. Which now he thought none durst contradict, because the King was consenting thereto: Promised by his Art to make the same so inuincible, that it should neuer be ouercome by strength nor policy. Then did he aduise the King to bring Constantia thither, and two Damzels to attend her, attyring her with most Rich Ornaments. When the King had performed this, and deliuered her to Penthrasus : taking a Condition of him, that none but himselfe should be suffred to haue entrance there, he departed, leauing her there to be entertained of Penthrasus : who led her into the Castle appointing her Damzels where they should haue all things necessary: and withall, telling her that it should be many yeers before she should be deliuered. After he had placed her there, he beganne to cast about for to Fortifie the same: And first by his Art, he found that there liued in the Desert of Arabia , two mighty Giants of vnwonted proportion, and huge strength, whom hee found out, casting such a bewitched Charme vpon them, that they presently followed him vnto the Castle, which he afterwards named Penthrasus Pallace : by his Charms and Spells, binding them to keepe the first entrance of the Bridge, and by his Sorceries guarding euery entrance in such strong sort, as it was impossible to be ouercome. When he had performed euery thing according to his minde, hee brought thither his Wife, named Ila , determined to spend the rest of his life there. Within few yeares he fell sicke, and by his Art found the date of his life to be nigh an end. Whereupon he went vnto the Oracle of the Hesperian Nymphs in the Desart, which he was stricktly enioyned vnto by a Uision, which he saw in his sleepe, to know what he should determine as concerning those charms, he had set vpon the Castle? Whose answere was this; Penthrasus , because by thine Art thou hast not attempted any wicked Action, and to disclose the Destinies, many a Knight of sundry strange Countries shall heare of the beauty of Constantia , and shall come to try their Aduentures to set her at Liberty, but yet none shall performe it: neither shall it be Reuealed, that shee is Daughter to the King of Persia : vntill shee be released by the valour of her owne Sonne. The manner and meanes how, is as yet hidden and vnreuealed: vntill which time, Ila shall liue, and by our Directions gouerne the Castle, vntill the Enchantments be ended. Penthrasus hauing receiued his Answer, returned home, and within few dayes dyed. Thus was Constantia enclosed, enioying all the Delights her heart could desire, but nothing could comfort her, but the Remembrance of Persicles , for whose absence she liued in continuall sorrow. Helyon kept that which he had done concerning Constantia , from the Knowledge of Selia , determining neuer to see her againe: but within short time, such discord beganne betwixt him and Selia , that by meanes thereof, the whole Court was in an vprore, and he found such disquyet with her, that then he began to hate her, abandon her companie, and began exceedingly to dote with remembrance of Constantia : repenting him of the euill he had done her: and resoluing againe to set her at Liberty, or else to obtaine of Penthrasus , to liue for euer with her in the Castle: and by extraordinary meanes to attaine her Loue. And vpon a time he rode thither, determining to haue a sight of her: Where when he came, he found the Gate at the entrance of the Bridge fast shut, and nothing but a Horne hanging thereat, fastned to a Chaine, which he Winded: and with that one of the Giants came foorth, with whose sight he stood affrighted till he asked him what he sought? I would (said Helyon ) speake with Penthrasus : With that the Gyant bad him come in, and shutting fast the Entrance, brought him before Ila , who presently knew him, saying: I know the cause of thy comming, which thou shalt neuer obtaine: For which disloyall thought, and other ignoble deeds, thou shalt neuer depart from hence, vntill the Lady thou causedst to be inclosed here, be set at Liberty: With that, not suffering him to replie, she caused him to be bound, and carried into a darke Dungeon, where he was hardly Dyetted, and worse intreated. Ila hauing him in her custodie, knowing that none else was priuie to Constantiaes being there, caused these Uerses to be written in Letters of Gold, and hung ouer the outtermost Gate, and by the same, Constantiaes Picture, whereon she had cast such a Spell, that all that beheld it, were in Loue with it. The Uerses were these, Within this Castle is inclos'd The Daughter of a King: Whose Beautie caus'd a Traytour fell Her from her Countrey bring. Here must she bide, vntill a Knight By sword doth set her Free: And by his valour end the date, Of crooked Destinie. The World shall Fame him for that deede, And great shall be his gaine: Her lasting Loue shall he enioy, That rids her out of paine. When Ila had written these Uerses, and placed them vnder the Picture, shee withdrew herselfe into the Castle, staying the comming of the first Knight for the Aduenture. What befell to Palia , how shee was deuoured by Wilde Beasts. How the young Infant was found by a Ladie, who cherished him, and afterwards named him Montelion . Now returne wee to speake of Palia , and what befell to the Infant. After she had trauelled out of Arabia , resoluing with a faithfull heart, to execute what she had vndertaken, and attained to the bounds of Assiria , shee soone vnderstood those euill Newes of the Armenians victorie: whereby she was assured, it would be in vayne to seeke Persicles there: and therefore she returned towards Persia , intending to follow Constantia's directions to find him: but being wearied with continuall trauelling, she sat herselfe downe vpon a Mountaine, standing in a vaste and Desolate place: on the top whereof, grew a tuft of Trees that shadowed her from the heate of the Sunne: where she had not long rested, but the Boy fell fast asleepe, and she being very hungry, began to seeke for Fruit, no other foode being their to be gotten, leauing him vpon the Mount. Palia , wandring into the Thicket by misfortune was deuoured of a Lyon: and so the poore Infant left ready to be destroyed: but the Destenies that had allotted him to better fortune, thus preserued him. Not farre off, there dwelt an ancient Knight named Cothanes , who with his Lady, the same day had been Hunting, and now she being weary of the sport, with two seruants in her companie, chanced to alight at the very place where the Babe lay: who by that time awaked, and missing his Nurse began to cry. The Lady hearing the noyse, searched among the Trees, and presently found the Child, which she tooke vp in her armes, commanding one of her seruants to take vp a bundle of cloathes that lay by the same, and to winde his Horne, that Cothanes hearing it, might come vnto them: Who according to her desire came, asking what was the matter? You haue (said she) all this day Hunted after Wild beasts, and lost your labour, but I haue found a richer Prize, yet by what misfortune left in this place I know not: With that they both viewed the Child, well noting his exceeding beauty, and sweet countenance, with great joy carrying him home: by the way naming him Montelyon : finding in the fardell many rich Iewels, and a faire Embroydered Scarffe, whereby they knew him to be of no meane Byrth: educating him carefully, and after he was come to Knowledge, teaching him many commendable and vertuous qualities. When he came to the age of fourteene yeares, Cothanes taught him how to Ride and Manage a Horse, taking him foorth with him many times on Hunting, delighting wonderfully in his forwardnes Wherein he shewed such aptnesse, that he could not offer to teach him any thing but he soone grew to be as perfect therein as himselfe. Whom we will leaue to be Educated by Cothanes , and returne to speake of Persicles : and what befell to him after the losse of Constantia . How Pisor being recovered, perswaded Persicles to crave ayde of the King of Persia , against his Enemies: How he obtained the same, and carried a mighty Host into Assiria , which was there overthrowne. After that Persicles had in heauines and sorrow wandred vp and downe those Woods, the space of three moneths, and Pisor again come to his remembrance: Upon a time they both met, Pisor saluting him with great reuerence. Persicles seeing he was come to his right sences againe, asked him what became of Constantia ? My Lord (qd. he) I found her in the Shepheards house, telling her you would presently returne, but when she saw you stay so long, vnawares to me, she went out of the Cottage to seeke you: I soone missing her, thought to ouertake her, to direct her vnto the place where I left you, and by misfortune tasted of that Ominous fruit. Then said Persicles , she is assuredly deuoured by wilde Beasts, and I shall neuer see her againe. My misfortunes exceeding the bounds of common miseries: that I would to God I had ended my selfe when I was first borne, then should not both Assiria , and Persia haue had such cause of discontent. My Lord (quoth Pisor ) I cannot be perswaded that she is dead, but by some misfortune wandred out of knowledge, or carried hence by some vnexpected meanes: Therefore I beseech you beare her losse with patience, and in the end I doe not doubt but you shall heare of her safety. Thou giuest me words full of comfort (sayd he) but thou hast no ground for them: Nor can I tell how by them to adde any hope of my restlesse passions: for that shee is lost I am sure, but that I shall euer see her againe, I thinke it impossible: being driuen to so hard an exigent of extremity, that I neither know what to doe, nor whose ayde to implore. Thou seest another hath shut mee from my Kingdome, and in my absence wonne my subjects hearts from mee. The King of Persia , hearing of the wrong done to him, will become mine Enemie, and then is there no place of refuge left for mee but in this place be best fitting my miserie. My Lord (said Pisor ,) yet if I may be so volde as counsell you, let vs goe to the Persian Court, I as I am, and you in that disguise, for none but your sister Piera , being priuie to your escape with Constanta , you may safely and without feare goe thither, both to conferre with Piera , and to craue the Persians assistance to establish you in your Kingdome. Persicles vnwilling to leaue those woods where he was, determined to dwell for euer there: But finding no hope thereby to recouer Constantia , and also being perswaded by Pisor , he condiscended to goe with him, and thereupon immediately departed. When they approached neare to the Court, Pisor rode on before, and entring the Court, he soone found Piera declaring to her the misfortune that was befallen to Persicles and Constantia : and how that hee was without the Court, staying vntill he returned, to know whether hee might with safety come to speake with her, or no? Piera then presently sent for him by Pisor , and other of her Knights, who brought him into the Court, whither he was Welcommed by her, with great Ioy: With whom he continued some time in priuate Conference. Piera counselling him to discouer himselfe to the King of Persia , and to craue his ayde against the Armenians , who would readily assist him: Whereof she told him, he needed not to doubt, for that he had euer beene his Friend, nor knew not of his escape with Constantia , which none but her selfe and Dela were priuy vnto. Whilest they continued in this conference, Deloratus came in, and espying one in such priuate with his Wife in that disguise, wondred who it should be. Piera soone espyed him and leauing her Brother went to him, and told him who it was: Wherewith he Embraced Persicles in his Armes, now perfectly remembring him, although griefe had much altered him. After many speeches past, Deloratus , he, and Piera , went to the King of Persia , who knowing him, welcommed him, with exceeding kindnes. Persicles then vnfolded his Misfortunes vnto him, and desired his assistance, in reuenge of the wrongs the Armenians had done him. Which the King of Persia willingly yeelded vnto him: giuing authority vnto Deloratus to muster Souldiers, and make prouision for their expedition. The newes hereof was suddenly rumoured in the Court, and many thousands of Knights vnconstrained, prepared to ayde Persicles , whom they honoured for his exceeding valour and courtesie: purposing to spend their liues in his Defence: that of a sudden one part of the Countrey was vp in Armes, and a great Force was assembled, and conducted into Assyria , by Deloratus , and Persicles , and Pisor , and Osimus , and also many other Knights of exceeding valor: Of whose worthy Exployts, we will hereafter speake more at large. Persicles had such ill successe, that after he had continued a long time in Assyria , yet he so little preuailed, that he was compelled thrice to flye backe into Persia to renew his Forces. These cruell Warres continued many yeares, the King of Armenia , defending himselfe, and keeping possession of the Crowne, notwithstanding the Persian Forces. Deloratus perceiuing that the long continuance of those Warres had wasted a number of his subiects, and yet notwithstanding Persicles was so farre from possession of his right, as at the first beginning of those tedious Warres, determined to giue ouer: and therefore assembled together such as were the chiefest Rulers ouer the Hoast, to know their opinion, what further to determine. Who with a generall consent, perswading him once againe to renew his Forces, and if that then they did not preuaile, neuer more to giue the Onset. How Persicles Army was renewed. And how Montelyon , being denyed by his supposed Father, stole to the Campe. And how he preserved Persicles life. How Cothanes knew him, and discovered what he knew of his Birth. And how he received Knighthood at Persicles hand. himselfe wearied with that tedious Warre, went likewise with resolution, eyther then to end his life, or euer after to abandon the company of all men, and end his dayes in solitarinesse: Deloratus therefore sent Messengers into Persia , to muster new Forces, who in short time returned, that the Persian Campe was full fourescore thousand strong. Amongst the rest, it so fortuned that Cothanes (being in Youth accounted a man of great valour, and now being somewhat growne in yeares, of great Experience) determined not to giue his mind to sloth being touched with griefe, to heare what a number of his Country-men were slaine: therefore told his Lady what he intended: who with teares and many intreaties disswaded him, but all could not preuaile, his heart was so fully set thereon, Montelyon being now growne to mans estate, hearing thereof, entreated Cothanes (whom he esteemed to be his Father, and so called him) that he might goe with him: but Cothanes would by no meanes consent thereto: the rather, for that his Lady most earnestly requested him, that if it were so that he would needs goe himselfe, yet that he would not leaue her altogether comfortles, by taking Montelyon with him. Therefore all his intreaties nothing preuayled, but of necessity he was enforst to stay. Cothanes being departed, Montelyon continued some two dayes exceedingly pensiue, so much troubled in his thoughts, with griefe to be left behind, that he refused his meate: and notwithstanding the manifold kindnesses his supposed Mother vsed him withall, yet he thought all things troublesome. Which desire so much preuailed with him, that furnishing himselfe with good store of Coyne, secretly one Night he conueyed his Steed without the Castle Walles: and when all thought he had bin in his Chamber, he was departed. By that time it was day he approched neare the City of Helotos , where he stayed some three dayes, vntill he had furnished himselfe with Armour, which he caused a workman to frame of exceeding pure Lydian steele, bearing this Deuise. His Armor Siluer, interset with the formes of diuers Beasts and Trees of burnisht Gold. And in his Shield, a naked Man amongst a tuft of Trees: Which deuise he caused to be made of purpose, to be knowne different from the rest. Hauing furnished himselfe in this sort, he left the City, and journeyed toward the Persian Campe in Assyria : Where he was no sooner come, but he found the Battels joyned in most cruell Fight, and a number of Souldiers on both sides slaine, lying couered and besmeared in Bloud: Some with their Swords fast grasped in their hands threatning: Others with a hideous noyse breathing forth their latest gasps: then in the Campe beheld he some flying, others pursuing: some standing fast in cruell Conflict: others with fierce terror slaying those that was next them: Some with hideous cryes, animating their followers: Others with feare, crying retire. There did he behold both Persians and Armenians , intermingled slaughtering each other. Wherewith he a while stood as one amazed, hauing neuer before beheld such cruell Conflicts: At last he beheld a most gallant Knight, with his Sword drawne, and all couered with blood, hurling vp and downe amongst the Armenians : performing admirable deeds of Chiualrie, but at last encompassed with such a multitude of his Enemies, that he knew it was impossible for him to escape. Which sight, stirred vp such sparks of courage and desire to succour him, that his heart vrging him to more forwardnes then his Steed could performe: and yet his Steed with furious pace, running as swift as might be, rusht in amongst the thickest of them: At the first piercing his Lance through the bodies of two that were opposite before him: and his Steed with his vnstayed course, ouerthrowing others, and treading them downe vnder his Feet: then drawing his Sword, whose brightnesse dazeled the sight of such as beheld it, vntill he had darkened the Splendor with their purple blood: mangling, slaughtering, and destroying such as withstood his Passage: vntill he approched the Persian Knight, who without his approach, had there ended his Life: But finding himselfe at more liberty, by the assistance of this new-come Gallant, he againe redoubled his abated Courage, joyning themselues both together, performing such honoured Ualor, as by their onely resistance, the thronged multitudes of Armenians disperst themselues, euery one hasting to get without their reach. Now the Knight that Montelyon had rescued, was the Noble King Persicles , who seeing how valiantly this New-come Gallant had rescued him, and preserued his life, said thus vnto him. Noble Knight, thy Ualor hath preserued me: For which Persicles will not be vngratefull. And if thou beest a friend to me, as thou hast already showne, second me, and I will once again try my Fortune. With that Montelyon held vp his hand, in signe he gaue consent. Then Persicles with speed hasted into the foremost of the Battell, and Montelyon followed, making such way, as none stood to resist them, but they dyed. Where they found Deloratus, Pisor, Osimus, Cothanes , and a number of gallant Knights in combat, beset with oddes, but that disaduantage was soone turned to aduantage, by their approach: for there did Montelyon performe such deeds of exceeding Ualor as made the whole Persian and Armenian Hosts admire him. Then began the Persians to gather new courage to assaile their enemies, continuing the skirmish with equall strength, against them. Palian the vsurping K. of Assyria , thinking to haue the aduantage against the Persians , as in times past they had, called the chiefest Rulers to him, exhorting them to courage to resist their enemies. Upon whose exhortation, the Armenians with vndaunted courage followed the battell on all sides with great eagernes, that the Persian Gouernours were enforced to flye to their Companies, to encourage them to resistance, only Montelyon and Persicles still kept together, making thousands of the Armenians pay their liues for tribute to their conquering Swords: Whilst they continued the fight in the fore-front of the Battell, they suddenly heard a cry on the outside of the battell, with which noyse, Montelyon not regarding to be counselled, set spurs to his Horse, and hasted thither, where he found Deloratus , though to him vnknowne, in the throng of a multitude of Armenians , vnhorsed, and fighting on foot, so sore wounded, and against such ods, that he was ready to faint, and by force to be taken: Amongst whom, Montelyon rushed with such fury, spoyling them, that he succoured Deloratus , and hauing againe with the helpe of some of his owne Knights set him on Horse-backe, sent him to his Tent with a sufficient Guard: and returning againe towards Persicles , he espyed Cothanes his Father, whom he knew by his Armour, vnhorst, and newly by force taken prisoner, but before they could convay him from thence, Montelyon began so cruell a fight, that with the losse of many of theyr liues, he set him at liberty, Then began the Armenians somewhat to Retire, hauing such a number of them slaine, and finding theyr enemies pursue them so fiercely, that Palyon perceiued the Persians would that day be conquerors: yet notwithstanding calling to him two Knights, the one named Althesus , the other Preton , who were most renowned of all the Armenians , he said to them, Ioyne with me, and let vs once againe repell these fainted harted Persians : With that, they three with a multitude of their chiefest soldiours, kept a head together, and fronted the battell where Persicles fought, Palion knowing him, with a Lance ready coucht ran at him, which lighted vpon his Shield, where it burst in pieces, not once piercing the well tempered steele. Then both Palion, Althesus and Preton , all at once assailed him, whom Persicles resisted with exceeding valour, continuing so long as any Knight could possible doe: But at last the oddes being so great, he was driuen onely to defend their swift blowes, that were followed with eagernes: then began he to wish for the strange Knight, that had all that day succored him, expecting nothing but death. By this time Montelion had rescued Cothanes , and again got him Horse and weapon, which done he left him, and euen at that time that Persicles wisht for him, came,  & espying three knights assailing him alone, ayming his sword point at Petrons brest, who was next him, and running at him with all the force his horse could make, run the same through his body and with the like intent, ayming the same at Palion , he ran at him, that had he not auoyded his Encounter, he had eyther slaine, or sore wounded him, but missing, he let driue at him with his sword with such force, that in short space he gaue him many wounds Persicles likewise hauing nowe but Althesus to resist, Combated with him brauely, who with like valour resisted him: In the end Palion finding himselfe so out-matcht, began to retire, which Montelion perceyuing gaue him no respit to flye. Then was theyr Battle most terribell to behelde, the Persians comforted by the only valour of Montelyon , ran vpon their Enemies with vnresisted fury. And the Armenians seeing one of their chiefe Champions dead, and their Generall retire, were amazed: and rather ready to flye then to stand out: which animated their Foes with courage to pursue them, euen as long as the day lasted. Montelyon still pursued Palion , in whose Rescue many of his Knights interset themselues, and dyed by his Sword: and notwithstanding he withdrew himselfe, yet Montelyon followed him so neare, that he often put him in danger of his life: vntill he was so farre past in amongst their Troupes, that he was compelled with his Sword to make his way to get out againe. In which Retyre, many of the Armenians dyed. The Night now drawing nigh, whilest the Armenians found Retrayt, and the Persian Generals busie in gathering together theyr scattered Followers, Montelyon had time to consider what was best for him to doe, and whether it were conuenient to discouer himselfe or no: at last, determining to depart in secret, he espyed Persicles hard by him, who of purpose had watched him, misdoubting that which he intended, who came vnto him, and sayd. Sir Knight, the kindnesse I haue found in you, emboldneth me to desire your company, and intreat you to accept of my Tent, to repose your selfe in; For that I suppose you are a Stranger, and it were inconuenient for you to Iourney after so great labour, hauing this day with such Honour defended me, that I account my selfe yours, and my life preserued by your onely Ualor. Therefore deny me not, that I may in some sort requite your kindnesse. Montelyon hauing heard Cothanes oftentimes exceedingly commend the King for Ualour and curtesie, likewise hauing knowledge how to behaue himselfe, as well to the meanest as to the greatest personages, being by Cothanes nobly educated, and of his owne Inclination more apt to conceiue, then they are able to instruct, knowing it to be the King himselfe, bowing his body, sayd: Most honoured King, I am vnfit the honour you proffer me, and my desarts no way deseruing the commendations you giue them: therefore I beseech you, not to attribute to me more then is befitting my meane estate, but rather licence me to attend you, in all humble duty; My Life and all vttermost endeauors, being vowed to be spent in your seruice, and myselfe ready to be at your disposition. This sayd Persicles and he departed into the Campe, whether they were welcommed with, the shoutes and reioycing of the Persian Souldiers. Deloratus hearing that applaus, came foorth of his tent to see what was the cause thereof, and espying Persicles and the strange Knight together, came vnto them, they both alighting to salute him, Deloratus would by no meanes suffer them to depart, but intreated them to lodge in his Tent that night, which Persicles could not deny: and therefore taking Montelyon in kinde sort betweene them, they entred the same, where he was vnarmed: but when they beheld his youth, they wondred thereat, to be accompanied with such exceeding valour, both Deloratus and Persicles vsing him with great kindnesse. Then presently the principall Commanders of the Campe, assembled themselues to their Generals tents, to know what they did determine. Amongst the rest was Cothanes , who at the first entrance into the Tent, espyed his sonne Montelyon , his head being onely disarmed, & by his armour knowing it was he that had so honourably preserued his life, and defended himselfe: had much a doe to containe himselfe from rejoysing: likewise Montelyon seeing him, vpon his knee entreated him to pardon his boldnesse in comming to the Campe without his consent. Cothanes with great ioy tooke him vp, and imbraced him. Persicles seeing that said to Cothanes , My friend is this thy sonne? My Lord sayd he, he is my sonne, and he calleth me father, and yet I am vnworthy to be father to such a sonne, that hath this day showne himselfe rather to be the sonne of some heroicke King. And my Lord, because his worthinesse shall not be darkened with the ignoble Title of Cothanes sonne. I will declare to you all that I know of him. Indeed he is not my sonne, but my Lady and I beeing one day hunting, found him vpon the top of a Mount in swadling clothes: which were such, as shewed hee was not of meane parentage, but of honourable race: his Nurse as it should seeme, being distressed for want of food, was wandred from him, whose carkasse and cloathes wee found not farre off, destroyed by a Lyon: since which time, with carefulnesse I haue brought him vp esteeming him as mine owne sonne. This my Lord, in briefe is the whole summe of all that I know of him. They all maruelled at his words, especially Montelyon was strucken into such a sudden meditation, that for a while stood like one metamorphosed, Persicles taking him by the hand, said: Although I know not what title to giue you, yet borne you cannot be lesse then of noble bloud, as may well appeare by the manifest tokens of your heroicke dispositions: therefore remit the care of that vntill hereafter, and vouchsafe to stay with vs, who are now both comforted with your presence, and beene preserued by your valour. My Lord (replyed Montelion ) were my desire a thousand times greater then it is, yet the desire I haue to doe you seruice, would surmount the same, being in the depth of inward affection, loue and duty wholly addicted, and entirely deuoted to your worthinesse, which no desire of reward, hope of praise, or wordly respect hath bred in me, but onely the instinct of nature, that hath effectually engraffed the same in my heart: therefore I humbly desire you vouchsafe to entitle me with the honour of knighthood: wherewith if I be dignified by your vertuous hand, I shall both remaine with you, and endeauour to deserue the same. Persicles highly esteeming him, and kindly imbracing him, told him hee should that night be his bedfellow, and the next day haue his desire. With many other speeches they ended that nights conference: euery Ruler departing with carefulnesse to set the Watches. How the Armenians army with exceeding losse was discomfited. Earely the next morning, Deloratus, Persicles, Cothanes , and all the rest of the chiefe Commanders of the Persian Army, were assembled, who gaue order, that euery battell should be planted in such sort, as if they expected a present assault, which beeing performed. Montelyon in great triumph was brought into the field, and by Persicles inuested with the order of Knighthood: which when he had receiued, the Souldiers gaue such shoutes, as made the ayre resound with their Ecchoes. The Armenians hearing the noyse, could not iudge what might be the cause thereof: some censuring one thing, some another. Palian fretting with exceeding vexation at the last dayes discomfiture, which went the nearer his heart, for that in all the time of warres, he had not endured the like called vnto him the chiefest knights in his Camp, which were Althesus, Golgron, Mulatus , and Lamdelyon , Knights of Honourable birth, great wisdome and appointed valour, vttering to them his hearts griefe, and his earnest desir of reuenge, desiring them with all speed to counsell him which way to suppresse the Persians courage, onely reuiued with the ayde the strange Knight had brought them. Amongst whom it was agreed, & generally held best, to surprize them at vnawares in the middest of their ioy: that with all speed, and as speedily as might be they detained their Forces, and without the noyse of eyther Drum or Fife, issued the City gates. Certaine Persian Spyes perceiuing their intent, posted to the Camp, and certified their Generall thereof, who gaue commandement that without making any kind of suspicion, they should continue there mirth, so that thereby the Armenians might be heartned, to their owne destruction. Montelyon with a company of Horsemen departed out of the Campe, a contrary way to that the Armenians came, with intent to get betwixt them and the City, which afterwards sorted to effect. The Armenians thinking to make a sudden slaughter of them, and nothing at all suspecting their readinesse to receiue them with carelesse hast approached ye Campe, with greedy desire of conquest running vpon their Enemies. Whom they found in such orderly sort, ready to welcome them, that within an houres space they wisht themselues againe within the City Wals: To recite euery particular of their Conflict, and with what terror the battell continued, would dull my wits with confusion. Principally, my penne shall barely recite the admirable deeds of the most honourable of both Armies. Persicles considering what iust cause he had and with what equity he might challenge his right, wrongfully detained by his vsurping Foe, bent his Sword point with vnrelenting Fury, to the destruction of his Enemies, pittying their deaths who dyed by his Sword, ayming the same rather at Palians owne heart, then against them that were by constraint enforced to hazard their dearest liues. Which when he had coloured and made drunke with many of their deaths bloud, he at last met with Palian , whom at the first encounter he had surely bereft of life, had not his owne Steed by great misfortune stumbled at a dead body, that interrupted his steppes, but notwithstanding his Swords point by that mischance, missing his right ayme, ranne quite through his Steeds necke, who falling, and Palian with him, both lay groueling on the ground, ready to be troden to death. Mulatus being next at hand, rescued Palian , and mounted him on his owne Steed, whereby he lost his owne life: For Persicles with both his hands fetch so full a blow at his head, that with the force thereof, his Armour yeelding some scales thereof, pierced his Braine, and he dyed. Palian for a while continued Fight with Persicles : with euery blow receiuing a deepe wound, vntill he felt himselfe so vnable to hold out, that he must eyther yeeld, dye, or retyre: but euen then came Golgron fortunately to his ayde, who with him maintained fight against Persicles : who notwithstanding that ods, had neare hand brought them both to destruction, had he not espyed Deloratus and Cothanes in distresse, who were vnequally assailed by sixe valiant Knights, two of them being Althesus and Lamdelyon , vnto whom he hasted, giuing them succour by the death of the first he met. Whilest the Battell was maintayned in the Forefront by the chiefe Commanders of both Armyes, and Montelyon with his resolued Followers, whose hearts were enspired with fiery courage, to be guarded by so valiant a guide was gotten behind them, and began such a massacre, that multitudes of a sudaine were slaughtered by his approach, whose deeds of valour amazed their sences, with such feare, and abated their courage with such terror, that like as a flocke of fearefull sheepe, espying the approach of a deuouring Lyon, ranne with amazed feare from his pawes: Euen so the Armenians fled from the destroying hands of Montelyon , filling the empty ayre with such dismall cryes, that the noyse thereof amazed the hearts of the stoutest Armenians: Palian and Golgron then turned their backes, making hast thitherwards to know the cause, Althesus and Lamdelyon did the like, whilest Deloratus and Persicles , and the rest made such hauocke against the common Souldiers, that had the fight continued long, the whole Forces of the Armenian Army had beene destroyed. Palian and Althesus met Montelyon not knowing him: but supposing it was he had made such slaughter amongst them the last day, both assayled him: who in his heart reioyced that he had met with two such Champions to make tryall of his valour continuing so braue a combat against them both, as is not to be described. By this time the cry beganne againe on the contrary side, with such hideous noise, that Palians heart was affrighted therewith, and defended himselfe as if a slender youth should hold encounter against a strong Giant, till both he and Althesus were so grieuously wounded that it had beene a pittifull spectacle to behold. Both being driuen to retire amongst their scattered Troupes, and with all the haste they could, to preuent their vtter ouerthrow, to sound retreat, and with all speed haste vnto the City, which could not be accounted a retyre, but rather an absolute flight: for it was done with such haste, as if they had beene all amazed, none hauing the power to resist: and pursued by Persicles and Montelyon , with such fury, that their owne hearts relented at their owne hands cruelty, which couered the earth with the dead bodyes of their affrighted foes. The day being thus ended to the terror of the one, and comfort of the other: The Persians retyred as Uictors, and the Armenians halfe mad with griefe, and despaire within their Wals, not minding sodenly to issue again. Persicles and Deloratus honouring Montelyon with their kinde embracings, and the Souldiers applauded their valours with reioycings. Euery one according to the present occasion betooke themselues to their charges spending the time in more ioy and security, then earst they had done. How the Armenians sent two Knights into Armenia for more ayde, who were met, and one of them taken Prisoner, and of other accidents that befell. Earely the next morning, Palian assembled his Councell to determine what order to take for their security: which it behooued them to doe for that their Forces were vtterly discouraged, and the Country Inhabitants knowing their lawfull King to be liuing, beganne to reuolt, and denyed to ayde Palian , eyther with men or victuals, that he was constrained onely to keepe himselfe within the City Walles, not suffering any to issue out, or daring indeed to doe it, they were so strictly besieged by the Persians . When they had well considered their estates, and the misery they were likely to fall into, they concluded to send into Armenia , to certifie the King, which Althesus and one Mutellus two Knights of exceeding valour vndertooke to performe the next night. Montelyon , beeing in his Tent, determining to repose himselfe, yet feeling no desire to sleepe: calling for the Chronicles of the Warres of Antiochus King of Assyria , and spending some houres in reading that History, his Squire by his commandement being gone to Bed, about the dead time of Night, he heard the neighing of a Horse, as it seemed to him within the City: again reading and again staying to listen, his mind being somewhat troubled, being as yet in his Armour, he gyrded his Sword to his side, determining to walke the round, to see how diligently the Watch was kept: whom he found sleeping as soundly as if they had beene in their quiet Beds, maruelling much at theyr drowsinesse, but much more at their carelesnes, he went from place to place, not minding that night to sleepe, but himselfe would watch for them all. He had not long stayed, but he spyed two in Armour, with hasty (though softly steps) passing through the Campe on foote, whom he little suspected to be any other then of his owne company, thinking them to be some straglers, that seeing their fellowes in dead sleeps went to robbe: following as closely as he could, he perceiuing them to depart the Campe, but maruelling thereat, he drew nigher vnto them, entending to know what they were before they departed. Althesus and Mutellus espying one to follow them, and seeing themselues now without the Campe, purposed to lay hold on him, with purpose to force him to declare what the Persians intended to doe: that turning backe to him, Althesus offered to lay hold on him. Soft quoth Montelyon , let me first know what you are? We are enemies vnto thee sayd Althesus , and therefore yeild. Tell mee quoth he, your names? Althesus knowing himselfe to be of great valour, and therefore not to be vnknowne of any. Besides, little thinking he would haue resisted them, told him his name was Althesus . Then I defie thee quoth Montelyon , for I am thine Enemy, and will rather dye then yeeld to thee. With that Althesus drew his Sword, and strooke at him. Montelyon did the like to defend himselfe: and afterwards they offend him so much, that both he and Mutellus had enough to doe to saue their owne stakes and liues. Althesus seeing his valour, desired to know his name, which Montelyon tolde him. Althesus was much disquieted therewith: and seeing his companion fallen and faint with effusion of bloud, hee thus said: Knight, at this time I cannot stay to end the combat, for by hazarding myselfe, I should endanger the liues of many: therefore farewell vntill more conuenient time to meete thee againe. With that hee turned his backe, and Montelyon stouped to giue his conquered aduersary breath, which reuiued Mutellus : but seeing Althesus gone, his heart was ready to die with griefe. Montelyon had him be of comfort, for his intent was to vse him honorably: with that helping him vp, he ledde him to his Tent, calling vp his Squire to attend him, and disarme him, he went presently to Persicles . The next day Montelyon caused Mutellus to be carried before the Generall, where hee declared the cause of their departure towards Armenia, which Persicles was glad to heare of: that by this foreknowledge he might preuent the purposed intent of his enemies: but most of all he reioyced and commended Montelyon for this noble act, Which had they not beene discouered, might haue brought the whole Campe into great distresse: by this meanes euery way growing into such loue, and admiration of his valour, vertue and courtesie, that they esteemed their onely defence and felicity consisted in his safety: that wheresoeuer hee went, the eyes of multitudes awayted him, as being delighted to behold him. Mutellus desired Persicles to appoint his ransome, but hee committed that to Montelion , who after he had honourably feasted him, sent him ransomelesse to the City. Mutellus soone got entrance, and declared what misfortune had befallen him and Althesus , which turned their conceiued hope of comfort into despaire, which had ouercome them with feare, had not some little hope of Althesus escape reuiued them. Thus remained they many dayes within the citty, so hardly besieged, that they were out of all hope in getting Uictuals, but were driuen to content themselues with spare dyet, scantling out euery souldier and inhabitant theyr allowance, Which they continued likewise so long, expecting to heare from Armenia , that being frustrated, they expected nothing but miserable famine: which caused them late in the night, to assemble all their old, weake and impotent men, vnable to serue, and all women and children, except some few of account, and turned them out of the Citty, to the number of sixteene thousand, whose distressed estate Persicles pittied, causing them to haue sufficient foode, themselues builded Cabins to defend them from the weather. Persicles seeing the miserable estate his owne Country was in, and to what extremity his subjects were brought: by this knowing that Palian was not able long to endure, but that both hee and all those within the Citty, were ready to be famished, of whom many were Assirians , that were constrained to that subjection, whose estate he pittyed, being vnwilling to bee guilty of theyr destruction by the aduise and counsell of those hee most esteemed, but principally of Deloratus and Montelyon , hee sent a Herauld vnto Palian with this message; that although he did vniustly vsurpe his Crowne and many other wayes done him intollerable iniuries, yet pittying the miserable estate he was like to bring the Citizens into by his cruelty, he made him this proffer, that notwithstanding he might worke sufficient reuenge by his death, whose life was now in this mercy, he should without interruption, with all his Armenians, haue free liberty to depart out of Assyria . The Herauld with his message, went vnto the City, declaring the cause of his comming. Palian assembled his Counsell and returned this answere. That what he held, was his right by conquest, and that would hold: scorning hee should send any such proffer to him, that was wel able to defend himselfe, and as little regarded his courteous proffer as his malice: Wishing him, not to stay long, least his Fathers comming inflicted a greater punishment vpon him then he could eschew. Persicles was exceedingly vexed with his disdainefull reply, fearing indeed, that if the Kings forces were once come, it would be a great cause to lengthen the warres, which he earnestly desired might haue an end, that thereby he might haue respite to trauell in search of Constantia , for whom his heart endured exceeding torments, that being thus disquieted in his thoughts, and desirous of ease to his restlesse passions, one day amongst many that he passed ouer with pensiuenes, he got himselfe into a solitary place, and there in sad silence meditated on his misfortune. Montelyon by chaunce troubled with remembrance of his vnknowne estate, chose the very place for his priuate meditations. wherein Persicles was already shrowded, and suddenly espying him, beganne to withdraw himselfe, vntill Persicles desired him to stay, vttering these speeches. Worthy knight, I perceiue some inward care hath made you withdraw your selfe from mee, but impart your discontent to me: if not, yet heare mine, for I haue long desired to impart them vnto one, on whose fidelity I might repose my selfe, and you are the man I haue elected, hauing had so sufficient triall of your courtesie and friendshippe, that without doubting I durst commit my selfe to your secresie, for your ayde may, as heretofore it hath preserued me, My Lord, replyed Montelyon , I account my selfe onely fortunate, in your loue, and my heart acknowledgeth my euerlasting bounden duety to none so much as to your Maiesty, which bindeth me in all duty to become your thrall, being more ready to venture my life and vttermost endeauours in your seruice then you can imagine: therefore good my Lord, feare not to impose any taske vpon me, for by your imploying me I shall account my selfe onely blest. I thanke you good friend (quoth he) and if euer fortune fauour me againe, I will requite this kindnesse, though now I am plunged in the depth of ill lucke, beeing as you see depriued of my kingdome by the rebellion of my owne subiects, and the Tyranny of an ill neighbour the King of Armenia : the briefe discourse whereof is this. My Father when he liued, matcht my sister Piera in marriage with this worthy Knight Deloratus , sending me vnto Piera with her, who before my returne dyed, whilest I was there I chanced to fixe mine eyes on the beauty on Constantia , daughter to the Persian King, which by reason of my sudden departure, I could not giue her knowledge, hauing no other comfort but my sister Piera , to whom I bewrayed the secrets of my heart, departing with her promise of assistance whilest I went into Assyria to establish my Kingdome, Prince Palian of Arabia obtained the King of Persias consent to marry Constantia . Which newes Piera sent me, I being much troubled therewith, after I had refelled my olde enemy the King of Armenia in a battell, I left the gouernment of my kingdom to two of my noble men, & departed in the habite of a Palmer into Persia, where within short space I found such meanes by my sisters friendship, that I was in that habit without suspition, in Pieras chamber, and thereby had conference with Constantia , and attained her consent nothing remayning, but onely meanes how wee should escape, which afterwards we effected, and trauelled together vntill we came to a shepheards house, where we were kindely welcommed, contracting a solemne marriage betwixt our selues, because wee durst not be knowne the contrary, where wee liued some dayes in quiet: in the meane time the King of Persia caused diligent search to be made, and it was Pisors chance to finde vs, who kept our counsel, and was by me sent into Assyria, to fetch some of my owne knights to attend me home, where he found my Nobles at strife: and the King of Armenia taking opportunity, that with a mighty band of Souldiers, slew most of my part, the rest ioyning with him, vntill he had fully ceazed my Crowne. Pisor with this heauy newes returned to me, being vnwilling to giue me knowledge thereof, which ouercame my heart with such griefe, that seeking a solitary place, I wandred so far that I could not returne to the Shepheards house the same night. Constantia missing me, likewise stole from the cottage to seeke me but directing her steps a contrary way, or meeting with some misfortune that slew her, I neuer heard of her since. Pisor , he likewise went forth to seeke vs, and vnwillingly tasted of an vnfortunate fruite, that infused a sleepinesse vpon him for foure and twenty houres: but notwithstanding his and my most earnest search, wee could neuer finde her, nor I feare neuer shall. But if I could recure this euill done me by my foes, I would then spend the rest of my dayes in her search. Hauing ended his speech, his heart was so much ouercome with griefe, that he had much a doe to withholde his eyes from teares. Montelyon was opprest with no lesse griefe then hee, whose heart felt more inward disquiet then a stranger could haue done, in silent sadnesse seeming to impart with his sorrowes: but not abide to counsell him which way to recure them. That at last by reason the necessity of the time afforded little respite, they were constrained to depart. How Montelyon by a strange and dangerous adventure, wonne the City, and tooke Palian prisoner. such as he esteemed most valiant, telling them he had a matter of great danger and secresie to complot, which might be a meanes to establish Persicles in his Kingdome, if they would faithfully joyne with him. Which they stedfastly vowed to accomplish, and to follow him, although it were euen to their deaths. Arme you then, quoth he, in Armenian Armour, of which you haue choyce, and come to me at midnight. This being performed, and the Knights come, Montelyon with them departed through the Camp vnto the City Gates, where Montelyon knockt, but scarce so lowd that the Porter could heare him, who yet notwithstanding, comming to the Battlements, demanded who it was? I am said Montelyon, Althetus , and other Armenians , as thou mayst know by our Armor, and bring good newes: therefore open the Gates, lest by thy delay we be betrayed, for we are pursued. The Porter being out of all doubt, and hasty to succour them, vnbolted the Gates. Montelyon was no sooner entred, but he slew the Porter, entring the Lodge, and apprehending the watch, who lay sleeping, and slaying most of them before they awaked: One of them submitting himselfe, thus said. I am an Assyrian spare my life, and if you be friends to Persicles , I will giue you such directions, as you may surprize the City, and subdue Palian . Montelyon sayd, in so doing thou shalt be honoured of thy King and purchase thy owne liberty. After that they had put the rest to the Sword, the Assyrian directed them to the Pallace, and by so secret a way that he brought them euen within the compasse of the Castle, to the very place where as the Guard was. Montelyon then thus said to his Followers. My companions: let not feare now possesse your hearts, but by this exployt win honour for euer. Then by the Assyrians direction, they diuided themselues into two parts, the one to the foremost entrance, and the other by a By-way. Montelyon likewise knockt, and one of the Guard misdoubting no mischiefe, opened the doore, whereinto Montelyon rusht with his sword drawne, not speaking a word, slaying the first, the next, and all that came within his compasse: the Guardiants were so amazed therewith, that they were confounded in their sences, their courages for lack of time to consider, abated, and their hands with feare trembling not able to draw their swords, and when they were drawne, not knowing whom to offend, for Montelyon and his Knights were so like them in Armour, and so intermingled amongst them, that they knew not whether they strooke their owne fellowes or no, not knowing one from the other: by which meanes Montelyon and his knights who by a priuy token knew each other, made such a slaughter amongst them, that all the floud swam with their bloud. Some of them made meanes to flye by the backe doore, but euen then, as they stept out, they met death, he that followed, not knowing him that went before to be slaine, that had a thousand come that way, they had one by one met with destruction, that in the end, by Montelyons valour there was not one left aliue, nor any escaped. And this complot performed with such expedition in the dead time of the night, that the rumor thereof came not to the hearing of any. That within short space and little labour, Montelyon surprized Palian euen in his Bed, who seeing one in Armour besmeared with bloud, with his sword ready drawne, being exceedingly affrighted, asked what he was? I am qd. Montelyon , thine enemy, and Persicles friend, Thou art a villaine and a Traytor, qd. he, and with that he called to his Guard. crying out treason. treason, I am betrayed, helpe, helpe. Thou cryest in vaine, qd. Montelyon , for there is none here to help thee: for by this hand thy Guard are slaine, and thou shalt follow them the same way to death, unlesse thou aske mercy: For my hands can hardly abstaine from working vengeance on thy trayterous head, thou hast deserued to be punished with inexorable torments. Montelyon had scarce ended those words, but the rumoring Eccho of an exceeding out-crie, sollicited his eares, the occasion was this. After Montelyon was departed his Tent, his Squire following him, and seeing him enter the City with so few in his Company, ranne backe with all speed, and certified Persicles what he had seene, who fearing least that valourous attempt might endanger his life, and hearing that he had gotten entrance into the City, with all the haste he could armed himselfe, and calling vp Deloratus, Pisor, Cothanes and Osimus , and all the rest of his chiefe Commanders of the Army. with the choyce of their seuerall Bands, to the number of ten thousand, they soone marched to the City gates, which they found wide open, and being entred, and by seuerall companies dispearst into euery corner of the Streets, on a sudden on euery side they gaue the Alarum, which rung through the City and eares of the Armenians with such terrour, that like men bereft of their Sences, they ran vp and downe to their destruction. There did Deloratus fill his hands with slaughter, and Pisor with cruelty reuenged his withholden liberty: There did Cothanes, Osimus , and many thousands, colour pale Death in purple Robes. There did Persicles tryumph ouer his foes, his conquering Sword working their deaths, that the City channels ran with goate bloud, and their hasty steps were intercepted by the heaps of breathlesse foes: then began such an outcry, as would haue affrighted the sences of the most valiant: Old men hiding their heads in secret places of their Houses, the women with their children crying, wringing their hands, and making exceeding lamentation: the Soldiers ready to destroy one another, not knowing whom to offend, being ignorant in the originall of the Stratagem. The Counsellors and such as sate in Seate of Iudgement with speedy steppes conueying themselues to the Castle, where Palian was, where at theyr Entrance they saw such sad Spectacles of horror, and dreadfull war already entred, laying open passage to death. Where Montelyons Followers though but few, soone layd hands on them, slaying those those that resisted, and enclosing them that yeelded, within a strong Tower. Montelyon by this time had haled Palian from forth his Chamber and bound him hand and foot, brought him out of the Castle, inclosing him in a strong Iayle, where many malefactors were imprisoned, himselfe for safety becomming his Iaylor. And now hauing intelligence that Persicles was entred the City, he bent his steppes to finde him out: by the way destroying the Armenians , who indeed tooke him to be one of their owne company by his Armour: at last he came to the Abbey, wherein the greatest part of the Armenian Souldiers lay, in a large field, encompassed within the wall, wherinto Persicles with some three thousand Souldiers were before entred, making such slaughter as would haue terrified the heart of any beholder. Montelyon being alone, thought now or neuer to make tryall of his Ualour: though being on foot, yet rushing amongst the thickest of the Armenians , who seeing him in that Armor, rather thought he had beene of their Commanders, then an Enemy: who franticke with affright: slaughtered them, because they were slow to slay their enemies: which when he perceiued, he cryed vnto them, Uillaines, traytors, cowards, why shun you me? I am your Enemy, a Persian , and come to destroy you. Notwithstanding his speeches, by reason they had no respite to consider what to doe, they still fled from him, not so much with thought of what he was, as with feare to come neare him: for none came within his compasse, but he dyed, so that where he fought, their Death tryumphed: and by reason of their flight, his hasty blowes onely hurt the Wind, for sometimes, they were spent in vaine. Persicles and Deloratus being nigh, stood and beheld him with admiration, wondring who it was, that in their judgement with such fury fought against himselfe: vntill he espyed them, by his speeches giuing them knowledge what he was, hauing found him they desired to find, after short salutations, they followed their enemies with cruell destruction: the bright day disclosing that nights bloudy act, which appeared before them with such a grimme aspect, as that it made terror seeme most terrible, so that before many houres of the day were spent, the Armenians were vtterly destroyed, and amongst them many Assyrians vnknowne to be Affricans were also slaughtered. Persicles gaue strict commandement to his souldiers, to make diligent search the City throughout, and if they found an Armenian , to put him to the Sword, not suffering one to escape nor liue. Which done, he commanded the dead Carkasses in Carts to be carryed out of the City, which were so many that with much adoe they could performe it in a dayes labour. Which done, he gaue the spoyle of the Armenians Tents and Houses vnto the Persian Souldiers, and also gaue commandement, that the women, children, olde men, and impotent people, should be brought into the City and euery one possesse his owne house, wherein he dwelt before. This being performed for that day, order being taken for the wounded, the souldiers enriched with spoile, the Citizens in quiet in their houses, diligent watch set at each gate, and a strong guard without in the Tents, for that it drew to night, and their labour required ease, after much ioy, they betooke themselues to their rest. Earely the next morning they forsooke their Pauilions, first appointing certaine scowtes to watch about the borders of the country for the approach of the King of Armenia, which as they suspected would be very shortly: for it was now two moneths since Althesus departed. By that time the day was aged the space of three houres, the inhabitants of Assyria that had liued vnder the subiection and tyranny of the Armenians, hearing of Palyans ouerthrow, and being assured of Persicles safety, which before that, their doubtfull hearts would not beleeue, came by great multitudes to submit themselues vnto their lawfull King: who reioycing thereat, commaunded them in signe of their obedience, to arme themselues, and returne to their owne dwellings, and to destroy all the Armenians that inhabited the Land of Assyria, not suffering neither man, woman or child to liue. It was a wonder to beholde, with what greedinesse the heady multitudes bent themselues to their Enemies destruction, euery one thinking to be foremost, and hee that was last, yet thinking himselfe happy that he could graspe a Sword, to seeke his owne liberty. Which they effected within three dayes, that there was not any of the Armenian Progenie left: for if they chanced to finde an Assyrian man married to an Armenian woman, both shee and all her Children had dyed. And if they found a Woman with child, or hauing any children and that shee could not shew an Assyrian was the Father of them, they had all of them dyed. In the meane while, all those that were Prisoners, were brought foorth. Persicles by the whole consent of all his Nobles, People and Counsell, appoynting them to dye, onely Palian excepted, who likewise had that day abode a shamefull death, if hee had not beene a Kings sonne, being onely committed to safe custody, where he was honourably vsed. These tragicall Stratagems ouerpast, and all things in security, notwithstanding the beauty of the Land was destroyed by the Armenians, yet now the Nobles & Peeres of the land, that for a long time durst not looke ouer the Castle walls, assembled themselues vnto their King, making all preparation they could for his more honourable welcome: the Bels rung for ioy, and the people with exceeding reioycings applauded his victory. Within few dayes Persicles was with great royalty twise crowned King of Assyria, and Montelyon honoured with such exceeding commendation as his worthinesse deserued. Euery one (as of right they should) attributed that honoured victorie to his valour. All men growing into deepe affection towards him, and with reioycing manifest their loue. Of the King of Armenia's arriuall with a new Armie. How Montelyon set Palian at liberty: and of a Peace that was concluded. Certaine of the Spyes had knowledge of the approach of the King of Armenia, and brought newes thereof vnto the Court, which stirred vp a new disquiet amongst them, for then they began on all sides to arme themselues a fresh: but that haste was soone stayed, by the arriuall of certaine Ambassadours from the King of Armenia, who deliuered their message in these words, Persicles of Assyira, the mighty King of Armenia commandeth thee to deliuer his sonne Palian in safety, whom he vnderstandeth thou hast taken prisoner. Withall hee requireth restitution to be made of the Crowne and kingdome of Assyria, which by right of ancient inheritance is his: otherwise he will bring so puissant and inuincible an armie against thee, that shall waste and consume, this Land, not leauing City, Towne nor house vndestroyed by fire: hee will make the Inhabitants perpetuall bondslaues, and he will cause thee to flie, or abiding his comming, hee will take thee captiue, and leade thee into Armenia, where thou shalt remayne his vassaile. This is the summe of that he requireth, therefore let vs haue aunswere. I will not study sayd Persicles , what to say, but thus say to him, His sonne is my prisoner and I will detayne him: as for his threats I feare them not. vtterly denying his false title to my Crowne, which in my absence hee seazed vpon, not by valour, but trecherie. And tell him moreouer, that I demaund restitution for the wrong he hath done mee and my Country, which if he deny, nothing shall make me satisfaction but his sonnes death. And tell him thus, let him with haste returne, least my fury ouertake him, and so he feele the mischiefe he intendeth to me. for I meane to meete him presently, and worke such destruction among his Souldiers, as shall cause them to seeke his death for betraying them into my hands. Persicles spake these words with such fury, as made the Ambassadours assureadly beleeue hee ment it, that with this answere they departed. The King of Armenia little thinking to receiue such an answere, but rather performance of his demaund: was so enraged, that hee commaunded his Souldiers to march towards the City, vowing to redeeme his sonne, or be taken prisoner himselfe. Persicles likewise had collected a mighty band of Persians and Assyrians to meete him, that it was likely this would proue the hottest battell that euer was fought in that part of the world. In the meane time Palian was brought before Persicles , who was seated vpon the Kingly throne in great Maiesty; thus saying to Palian : what canst thou alledge to excuse thy selfe from death, hauing rightly deserued the same? thou knowest that it now resteth in my power to set thee free, or put thee to death: which the iust Heauens haue inflicted vpon thee as a due punishment for thy tyrannie. Palian made this reply, I am a King as absolute as thy selfe: therefore I know thou darest not put me to death: which if thou shouldest presume to attempt, know that the King of Armenia is hard at thy elbow to reuenge the same, whose power thou canst not escape. Therefore I defie thee, and dare thee to doe the same: for I know thee to be of so cowardly a disposition, that if thou once commest within my Fathers sight, thou wilt runne away. The people standing by, hearing him vtter such approbrious words, cryed out, Let him dye, let him dye. It was long before the multitude could be appeased, but at last Persicles thus sayd, standing vp in a great rage: Traytor, darest thou vtter such words in my presence: Thou shalt dye the death, not all the world shall redeeme thee. With that he commanded his guard to hew him in peices: with that they beganne to wound him, but Montelyon stepping betwixt them humbling himselfe vpon his knee, thus sayd. Noble King, vouchsafe to heare me speake, and without offence, let me clayme my right. This knight is my prisoner, therefore to put him to death without my consent, were to doe me wrong: yet although I speake this, pardon me, I challenge not any thing to contradict your will: but I humbly desire your Maiesty to graunt mee this fauour, that as I tooke him so, I may dispose of him. Persicles with haste rose from his seate, and imbraced Montelyon , saying. Were it my Kingdome, my life, or any thing that I esteemed more then both, that you required, I would for euer curse my heart, if it should deny it you: for you haue done mee so much good, and my debt to you is so great, as if I liue a thousand yeeres, I shall neuer pay: therefore I giue him freely vnto you, and his life withall. I humbly thanke your Maiesty, replyed Montelyon , with that he tooke Palian by the hand, and after humble reuerence done, he departed to whom being alone, he vttered these speeches. Noble Prince of Armenia, not expecting reward, nor fearing threates I here giue you liberty. Then did he desire him to make choise of horse and armour, wherewith hee armed himselfe, and so rode discourteously away, his stout heart not suffering him to giue Montelyon thankes. And being come to the Campe, humbling himselfe vnto his Father, and he imbracing him, thus sayd: My deare Sonne, welcome, then strutting vp and downe, said, I thought that dastard Persicles durst not detayne thee: for if he had, his life had paid thy ransome, and shall doe yet for detayning thee; by heauen this night will I fire the Citty about his eares, because I know that the coward dares not come foorth to meet me. Palians heart hearing his Fathers boasting, and considering how vnlikely it was he could performe it, with such a sudden passion of deepe consideration, changed with a sudden alteration, contrary to his former disposition, calling to remembrance how lately he was in danger of death, the force Persicles had about him, the late slaughter he had committed against his Souldiers, the curtesie of Montelyon , but most of all his ingratitude to him, that had freely giuen him his life, thus sayd. My most Noble Father, not the feare of your forces, nor Persicles cowardise (for by his doome I had dyed) hath set me at liberty, but the courtesie of a noble Knight that tooke me prisoner: who when Persicles had appointed my death, and the executioners were seizing vpon me challenged me to be his Prisoner, honourably armed mee, and courteously let me goe. Therefore I beseech you withdraw your Forces, and offer no more wrong to Persicles , who neuer offended you, the Kingdome of Armenia is as good as the Kingdome of Assyria , and better: and it is better to enjoy that with quiet, then both that and this with discontent. If not for that, yet for this, I humbly intreat you to conclude a Peace with Persicles , for your owne safety, for his power is too mighty to be subdued by the small Forces you haue brought. He is now allyed to the Persian, who is not yet your enemy, but onely your Friend: but if these Warres continue long, he will proue your mighty Foe, For if you goe forwards I must stay behind: for it were a great dishonour for me to fight against him that hath so honourably, courteously, and liberally giuen mee my life: If you should be ouercome, how much would it endanger your life, and if your life were in danger, doe you thinke you could escape? Besides, I will rather submit my selfe into the hands of your enemies, or shed my owne blood before your face, then liue to see so dismall a day as that will proue: therefore I humbly desire you to conclude a Peace. The King heard out his speeches with silent vexation, being so inwardly vexed, and with such desire thirsting for reuenge, that his heart was ready to burst with swelling malice: but at last more mollified with despaire of Uictory, then of yeelding to his Sonnes request, he sayd: Let it be as you will haue it, for this time you shall ouer-rule me. Then Palian thus sayd, My Noble Father, I know to conclude this peace will turne to our euerlasting good, and your own content: Persicles is honourable, and neuer offended you, And I know will honourably embrace this peace: therefore I desire you, let it be concluded with your free consent. With that he gaue his consent, willing him to conclude what he thought good, and he would ratifie it. Palian then mounting himselfe, presently departed towards the City, but ere he came there, he met with Persicles mighty band of Souldiers, and desiring to speake with Montelyon , he kindly embraced him, yeelding vnto him so many hearty thankes with such courtesie, loue, affection, and earnest vowes for preseruing his life, as Montelyon wondred at that sudden alteration in him, that before was so rude and discourteous, most kindly welcomming him. Then did Palian vnfold the cause of his comming, with such earnestnes, intreating Montelyon to joyn with him to conclude that peace, that he promised his assistance, and went with him to Persicles . Palian deliuered his message with humble reuerence, and Persicles with as much courtesie receiued it. And so effectually was this wrought, that the Peace accepted, and both the Armies meeting, in stead of blowes, embraced each other: Then did the King of Armenia and Persicles salute each other: First, in strange sort, but afterwards with more familiarity. After many speeches of both sides, Persicles accusing him of wrongs, and he alleadging the contrary, that notwithstanding Palian labouring earnestly to conclude the peace, yet the battell was like to joyn, and often by iterating hot speeches they both grew to exceeding rage, which againe by Palians and Montelyons good perswasions was asswaged: Growing to this Conclusion, a Peace was ratified for two yeares, in which time Ambassadours should be sent to the King of Persia, and Macedonia, to entreat their royall assistance to make an end of this Controuersie: Persicles heart could hardly endure to yeild to his foe any further, or abstaine himselfe from present reuenge, or appoint his rightfull Estate to be determined by the doubtfull course of arbitrement, in his heart scorning the Armenians should haue so much scope limited, as though he had any interest at all in his Kingdome, but rather, that he should then eyther absolutely winne all, or loose all: but regarding how much he had troubled Deloratus and the Persians, who now desired to returne home into their owne Countrey, but most of all, himselfe desirous to trauell in search of his deare Constantia, from whom he had beene long absent: For whose sake hee would haue lost his life, Kingdome and Liberty: whose absence was a continuall griefe to his Conscience, and a restlesse torment to his heart: for whom he had endured many thousand broken steps, vtterly despairing of finding her, but that, nor length of time, nor other ambiguity could cause his heart belieue, that he should finde her, and that she was liuing: therefore he constrained his royall heart to yeeld to any thing. And hauing taken the King of Armenia's Oath, not to interrupt him in his Kingdome, vntill the time prefixed, they parted, Persicles to the City, and the King with his Army into Armenia. Palians heart was linckt in such louing admirations of Montelyons vertues, that he humbly intreated his Fathers leaue to stay in Assiria to beare him company, but he denyed him, reprouing him greatly, and with bitter tearmes checking him: but notwithstanding, within few dayes in disguise he departed. The King would haue sent after to stay him, but that he was earnestly entreated to the contrary by his Nobles. Palian being kindly welcommed of Montelyon , disclosed the cause of his departure from his Father, onely with no other intent, but to enjoy his company, and by shew of duty to doe Persicles Seruice: which proceeded not of any coloured or imaginary dissimulation, but from the depth of a constant resolution. Such a sudden Metamorphosis had the view of Montelyons vertues, and his fathers tyranny wrought in him, that he admired the one, and abhorred the other. Of which he gaue such manifest tokens, that Persicles had no cause to misdoubt him, nor Montelyon to refuse his familiarity. How after the Peace concluded, Persicles left the Government of Assyria vnto Pisor , determining himselfe to trauell in search of Constantia . How they arrived in Persia . Of their honourable entertainement, and of other contrarious Accidents in Love that befell in their Persian Court. After all these troubles were ouerpast, the Persian Souldiers richly sent home into Persia , and Persicles had established his Kingdome, leauing the same to the gouernment of Pisor , he determined to trauell in search of Constantia , making the occasion of his departure, to be to accompany Deloratus into Persia, none but Pisor and Montelyon knowing the contrary. By the way as they went, Cothanes desired them to vouchsafe to visite his Habitation, which the rather they did, to see the roabes that were found about Montelyon . They were honourably welcommed thither, and royally feasted. Cothanes Lady bringing forth the packet, which they opened and well viewed, neyther Deloratus nor Persicles knowing any of them, for they were such as Constantia had in Arabia . Amongst the rest, there was a Iewell of exceeding beauty and richnes, which Montelyon in the presence of them all put about his necke, vowing neuer to part with it vntill he had found out his Parents. Afterwards they departed, Montelyon leauing Cothanes and his Foster-Mother, bewayling his departure with aboundance of teares. Within few dayes they arriued in Persia , the King sending out Troupes of gallant knights to attend them, the Estates Nobles, and Peeres of the Land in rich attire to entertaine them, and himselfe with the Queene, Piera and Lanula his eldest Daughter with a number of other gallant Ladyes forsaking the Court to meet them. The Citizens likewise hearing of their approach, prepared to entertaine them with delightfull showes, the Knights met them some two miles from the City, welcomming Deloratus with reuerence, and the other three Knights with courtesie. Next the Nobles embraced them, and at the City gates they saw the King with royall assembly staying theyr comming, vnto whom Deloratus kneeled, whilest they with teares welcommed his safe returne, and whilest hee embraced Piera , and his sister Lanula , the King and Queene welcomed Persicles : And when hee had left them to speake to Piera , they demanded of Deloratus who those strange Knights were. The one of them quoth hee, is our late reconciled friend Palian , and the other is the most valiant Knight Montelyon , that by his valour hath both preserued our liues, confounded his enemies and wonne himselfe immortall honour. The King of Persia bad Palian welcome into Persia , he likewise imbraced Montelyon , who with humble reuerence kneeled at his feet. All that beheld him, admired that one of such young yeares should be endued with such honoured Chiualry: especially the Ladies with there nice eyes, srveyed each part of his perfect lineamets which they found to bee most exquisite, iudging none like him in comelinesse but Persicles . All tedious salutations being ouerpast, vntill they came to the Court, entring with such royallty, as drave an admiration to the beholders eyes, there might one haue beheld the people with greedy desire by multitudes thronging to beholde them: but especially the White Knight, euery one asking which was he, that he himselfe might heare them, which oftentimes made the bloud reuiue in his cheekes, with such blush, that it might easily haue beene descerned. To rehearse euery particular would be ouer tedious, and to stay long in recitall of their royall entertainement, feasts, speeches and welcomes, would detaine you from the hearing of Constantias misfortune, for such entertainment there was, and euery thing performed with such royalty, as might haue beseemed the greatest Monarch of the world. After supper, the time of rest being come, the aged King and Queene bad good night to their guests, and euery one betooke themselues to theyr seuerall lodgings, remitting conference to the next dayes opportunity. Persicles beeing alone spent most part of that nights rest in studying which way to iourney in search of Constantia, Montelyon in consideration of his vnknowne Parents. Palian surfeitting in loue with Praxentia . She in commendation of Montelyon, Deloratus in pleasure with Piera , and the olde King and Queene in ioyfull remembrance of all theyr safety, euery one possest with a seuerall conceit, vntill slumbring sleepe ouercame their sence: Early the next morning they forsooke their beds, Persicles and Deloratus in conference with the King and Queene, and Piera in the hearing of Praxentia , and diuers other Ladies, rehearsing the warres in Assyria , and the manner of theyr victorie, Montelyon in company of Palian , commended the royalty of the Persians court, and the beauty of the Ladyes. Which speech they entered into by reason of Palian , whose heart could not chuse but vtter his inward thoughts, which had entertained a surfeiting view to Praxentias beauty, which was so exquisite, as it might haue intangled the sences of any man, with their beautious obiect: Onely Montelyon rested as free from, as one that neuer thought of loue, hauing his sences so fully possest with desire to finde his Parents, and search for Constantia , that no other thought could enter his brest. But such a contrariety had blinde Fortune wrought amongst them, that euery one desired a contrary thing: for Palian doted not so much on Praxentias , as shee did on Montelyon , and hee was so farre thinking such a thought, that it was in vayne for her to hope: Palian seeking opportunity to giue her knowledge thereof, and shee expecting when Montelyon should proffer loue to her: and he on the other side, seeking meanes to hasten his departure, which hee would instantly haue done, but that hee could not so soone seeke to leaue the King of Persia, nor his sister: but notwithstanding the King of Persia requested him to stay a moneth, which hee could by no meanes deny, Palian was glad of this, and Praxentia was not sorry, onely Montelyon thought the time would be tedious, because his affections were wholly bent on his iourney. How Praxentia sent her Nurse to Montelyon with a message, the Nurse tooke Palian for Montelyon , and to him discouered her secrets. refusing rest, foode, and company, to study thereon: oftentimes enioying her company, but not the opportunity hee expected, surfeitting with beholding her beauty, and tying himselfe faster in the snares of loue, but finding no hope of comfort. But on a day it thus fell out. Praxentia desiring ease, sent a Damzell to an olde Lady, named Lanula , willing her to come and speake with her, who instantly came, and being alone with Praxentia , hauing this conference. Lanula (quoth shee) I haue occasion to vse your assistance, in a matter of great secresie, which I haue refused to impart to any but your selfe, for the good opinion I haue of you, wherein you onely may doe me pleasure, and euerlastingly binde me to requite the same. The olde Lady was so forward of her selfe, that without further entreating she swore by many oathes, she would faithfully execute whatsoeuer she desired, were the matter neuer so great, yea though she hazarded her owne life thereby, I haue no reason to mistrust you, quoth she, yet I cannot but feare to tell it, and blush at the rehearsall thereof. Lady, quoth shee, will yee pardon me, if I tell you what it is? is it not loue? Yes, quoth shee, it is so, I am in loue, but feare I am not beloued, and him I loue, so honourable a Knight, as the world yeeldeth not his like: but being a stranger and vnknowne, I know he dareth not tell me that hee loueth, because my Father will neuer consent thereto: notwithstanding I could be contented with his estate, were it neuer so meane, might I enioy him. I haue often beene in his company, shewing my selfe desirous thereof, which any but himselfe might perceiue: but I spent that labour in vayne, and shall do still, vnlesse you work some means in my behalfe. Let me know his name quoth Lanula , and before many houres be past, I will by some meanes or other haue conference with him. Hee is the strange Knight Montelyon , say what thou wilt to him, without impeaching my modesty, and I care not: for not being by, I shall not blush, neither care I to hazard any thing for if he once goe from hence, I shall neuer see him agayne. As she had spoken that word she saw him walking alone towards the farther end of the garden, at the entrance into a groue. Yonder he is, quoth Praxentia, Lanula tolde her, she would euen then speake, and to that intent with haste she went downe the staires. Montelyon being come to the farther end of the garden, espyed Palian lying vpon a banke either sleeping, or in a deepe study, passing by him vnseene, for that he desired no company, entring the Groue. Lanula likewise seeking him, espyed Palian , not knowing either, saluted him in stead of Montelyon , Saying, Sir Knight, to you I thinke I haue a matter of importance to discouer, if your name be Montelyon? Palian answered not, but with courtesie bad her say on. There is a Lady of great renowne in this Court that beareth you deepe affection, who committed her counsels to me, but with no intent I should disclose them: yet I pittying her griefe, whome I am bound in all duty to pleasure, and withall wishing your preferment, am thus bold to intercept your meditation: hoping that this newes cannot bee but gratefully accepted. I heartily thanke you (qd. he) assuring you that I am euery way as deeply in loue as any, but with one so farre my better, that feare to offend, maketh me silent: therefore I pray let me know her name. It is Praxentia qd. she. And to her sayd he, I owe my life, loue, affections, and liberty. Sir (qd. she) I am glad hereof, and if you will follow my directions, I will worke so effectually, that you shall enioy her loue, whosoeuer sayth the contrary. I will be wholly ruled by you (qd. he,) neither will I refuse any attempt to attaine the same: therefore I pray you tell mee where I may finde you, and soone in the euening I will repayre to you. My name is Lanula , quoth shee, and you shall haue me in the Lodginges ouer the Posterne in the Priuie Garden. With that she departed, leauing him in a deepe meditation, what to doe to enioy her loue,  & how to doe it without dishonour to himselfe, and iniury to Montelyon , but that he thought impossible: entring into these meditations: how contrary is my hap to all good successe, that maketh me hazard my honour, and to aduenture such a taske as may bring me to perpetuall infamie? How often already hath my life beene hazarded by Montelyons hand? and yet I like a franticke man, forsake my friends to follow him. Could any thing haue fallen out more miserable, then for me to dote on her, that loueth another? and hee the onely man that hath alwayes preuented my good fortune? Shall I then cherish this loue, or roote it out of my heart, as a poyson that will infect my soule? for the King of Persia will neuer yeeld his consent. And that which is worse, she will neuer loue him she hateth. I will therefore leaue off, and salue the wound before it be past recouery: and rather abandon this Court, my Life, Friends, and Country, then sue for loue in another mans name. Reuoluing a thousand of these contrarious thoughts, at last he espyed Montelyon comming backe from the Groue, whom he saluted in this sort. Sir Knight, as I lay slumbring on this Banke, my sences were greatly troubled with your remembrance, and me thought an ancient Lady taking me for you, tolde me that a Lady of great dignity did loue me exceedingly, and that she of purpose came to know how I was affected. Further my dreame continued not, but as I awoke I espyed you, and haue vttered all to you. Now what Lady this should be, I know not; unlesse it be Praxentia . Montelyon made this answere: What this should meane I know not, neyther is it to be regarded. For dreames are but idle Fancies, procured by the conceit or imagination of the Dreamer: thinking that of another that he wished to himselfe, which is more likely: For the Princes were ouer-fond to place her loue on so deiected a stranger as my selfe, and if shee did so, yet it were in vaine & for my Fancies being now at liberty, cannot become bond-slave to Affection, were it to the greatest Princesse in the world, I speake not this, as reiecting her courtesie, but as one that esteemeth himselfe altogether vnworthy thereof. It may be, sayd Palian , though you account your selfe fortunate, yet you dare not trust me, and therefore you conceale it. Not so (quoth he) for I haue vttered all I think, or euer entend. Palian was glad to heare him say so, yet made no show thereof: passing the way betwixt that and the Pallace, in such like communication. How Palian in a disguise had conference with Praxentia , who tooke him for Montelyon . Hauing left Montelyon , he gate himselfe to his Chamber, exceedingly troubled in his thoughts, betwixt a striuing to ouermaster his loue, and yet to loue, and attaine his loue without hazarding his honour: but his affection had the superiority, and those sparks of vertue which were but newly kindled in his thoughts vanished, and hee resolued to try the vttermost issue of that Stratageme, though it were in Montelyons name. Euening now drawing nigh, he remembred his promise, which was to repayre to Lanula , therefore thither he went, but so secretly as might be, where he likewise found her staying for him, of whom he demanded what good newes? Lanula shutting fast the doore, thus sayd to him. After I returned from you in the Orchard, I went to Praxentia , and told her what speeches I had with you, which reuiued her heart with ioy, willing me to let you vnderstand, that it is not lewd desire, immodest loue, nor indiscreet intemperancy that hath procured her to this liking, but the report of your valour, regard of your vertues, and the worke that Nature neuer wrought in her before: therefore she requireth you be constant, secret, and loyall: nor to regard her loue the lesse, for that it was easily wonne, but to impute the same to Destiny, that had ordained him vnknowne to that honour, to be beloued of her, that hath refused to match her selfe to the greatest Emperours in the world. By Heauen (qd. Palian ) my heart is tyed to her in such bands of constant loue, that should she command mee to rip my heart from forth my brest, I would doe it to fulfill her desire, and shew my duty. Few words (qd. Lanula ) are sufficient, therefore know, that by reason of her Fathers displeasure, she dareth not openly conuerse with you, but she hath yeelded to be directed by mee, and therefore late this Night come to my Chamber, and I will get you the habite of a Gardner, in which disguise you may with safety thorough the Garden enter her Chamber. Palyan yeelding her many thankes, departed, whilest she went and certified Praxentia what shee had determined. Whose loue being growne to a setled resolution, and desirous to ease her selfe of disquiet, gladly consented thereto, thinking the time ouer-tedious, company troublesome, and her supper vnsauorie, to taste the sweetnesse of her stolne affection. Palian at the time appoynted went to Lanula , who had already prouided his disguise wherewith he apparelled himselfe, following her directions to finde the entrance to her chamber. Palian being entered the Garden, soone found the doore fast shut but Praxentia hauing a sight of him out of her window came downe her selfe to open the same. His heart was so rauisht with ioy of her presence, that he could not instantly speake: but humbling himselfe vpon his knee, he sayd. Uertuous Lady, I humbly desire you to pardon this my boldnesse, which I would neuer haue vndertaken, had not some former hope animated me thereto: but since it is your gracious pleasure so much to honour my vnworthinesse, I humbly giue my poore heart to your disposition, which shall account it selfe euerlastingly happy to be imployed in your seruice. Good Knight (qd. Praxentia ) had I not beene fully assured of your vertues, I would neuer haue admitted you this fauour: therefore I accept your gift, and in exchange thereof will giue you mine: so that you promise me to vse it honourably. Else let me become the infamous reproach of all the world. let my ioyes be turned into sorrowes, my health into sicknesse, my pleasure into paine, and all that I wish to proue my good, to bee my euerlasting misery. Your Protestations deare Knight, quoth she, are of sufficiencie to ouercome my yeelding heart, that harboureth no misdoubt of your disloyall meaning, but it is fully assured your vertues cannot harbour dissimulation, that is altogether different from vertue: therefore trusting you more then my selfe, I admit you that fauour, I neuer before granted, which is to receiue you as my chosen friend, trusting you will proue as faithfull as I desire, and will not reward my fauour with disloyalty. Which sayd, taking him by the hand, shee led him vp into her chamber, where many speeches past betwixt them, he with earnestnesse entreating her consent to loue him, and she binding him by many vowes to be constant. He durst not vtter many speeches, least it might bewray him: withall his conscience guilty of deceit, withheld him from boldnesse, and though peraduenture shee would haue taken any thing in good part, yet feare to be discouered himselfe, made him thinke no such matter, but his behauiour so neere as hee could, framed himselfe to the estate of Montelyon . Which likewise pleased Praxentia well, who though she were very affectionate her selfe, yet she imputed his coloured modesty to vertue, and his dissimulation to pure honesty, that by this conference he was fully assured of her loue, and she nothing doubting of his loyalty, being constrained by reason of the dayes approach, to breake off their communication, referring their next meeting to Lanulas direction: for that time both parting with many courteous farewels, she fully contented, he somewhat discontented that he had attained that fauour in another mans name which if he might haue claimed as proper to himselfe, he would haue deemed himselfe most happy. Clogged with these cogitations hee gate to Lanulaes Chamber to whome he discouered his fortunate successe, telling her that in the Euening he would repayre to her, to know Praxentias pleasure, and her direction, when, and where to speake with her againe. How Montelyon was in loue with Praxentia . How he was still preuented by Palian , of speaking to her. And how hee in diguise lay with her. Earely the next morning Praxentia forsooke her rest, and although wee had slept but a little that Night, yet she was loath to be accused of sloath, and apparrelling her selfe, framing a more then ordinary kinde of pleasant countenance, for that her minde was more then wontedly contented, shee attended the Queene in company of the Lady Piera . It so fell out that day, that the King of Persia himselfe, with the Peeres of the land, feasted with Persicles, Palian , and Montelyon , which fell out according to Praxentias wish, that she might beholde her beloued Knight with a surfetting view. Palian likewise was no lesse glad then she, that he might beholde her on whom his heart was fixed: and euery one sauing Persicles and Montelyon , had their hearts inclining to disport, onely they two rested sad, heauie, and vnpleasant, which was easily to be espyed, and was chiefly noted of Praxentia with one conceit, and Palian with another. All the dinner time Praxentias eyes were fixed on Montelyon, Palians on her, and his bending downeward with a heauy aspect. Which draue Praxentia into many cogitations: sometimes thinking he disdayned to looke on her openly, who had showne her selfe so affable in priuate: then she thought it was care to discouer her loue, which is easiliest discerned by the eyes: but when againe she saw he made no shew at all of regard to her, her colour often changed, sometimes with griefe, sometimes with anger, sometimes with feare, fixing her eyes stedfastly on him, and then glauncing about to see if any noted her, Palian noted her, and well vnderstood her meaning, as earnestly noting her behauiour, as she did Montelyons : often changing his countenance, sometimes with feare to be seene, then with a iealous conceit: then agayne, with an amorous thought, and againe with accusing of himselfe, for disloyall dealing towards her and him. Pieras minde was most at leisure to note all, which she performed with diligence, but seeing their eyes placed vpon contrary obiects, she thought there was as contrary a Simpathie in their affections, both perceiuing Palians double conceit, Praxentias disquiet, and Montelyons carelesse regard of eyther. By a priuy token vnseene of any, giuing Persicles an instance thereof, who quickly conceited her meaning: and iumpt with her in opinion, all the dinner time noting them. Which being past, and musicke filling the roome with pleasant harmony, Persicles pulling Montelyon by the sleeue, whispered these words softly in his eare. Friend, rowse your selfe from this sad dumpe, doe you behold how you are noted? vpon my life the Princesse Praxentia is in Loue with you: and if it bee so, may you not account your selfe most happy. My Lord, sayd hee, you are disposed to iest, no such good fortune will fall to my lotte: and yet if it did, I know I should neuer enioy it. Why, quoth Persicles , had you but seene so much as I, and noted her lookes, you would thinke so much as I: follow my counsell, doe but try, and you shall finde it so. What if shee were the Empresse of the Universall World, would you not venture? and were shee not the better to be beloued? and you the lesse cause to dispaire, if shee should refuse your loue, all the doubt you haue, is her Fathers dislike: neither feare that, Time may bring things vnthought of, to good effect. Doe but follow my counsell for this time, and after I will tell you more. By this time the musicke was ended, and euen with that Montelyon cast his eye on Praxentia , who stedfastly looked on him, her heart being so much grieued with contrariety of thoughts, that the water was ready to ouerflow her eye- lids. When Montelion , saw that, he presently beganne to conceiue hope, and by little and little, loue stole the possession of his heart. Withall hee remembred what Palian had before sayd to him: all which seemed likelihoods that it was so. Whilest he continued in these thoughts, and with more boldnesse had viewed her well (whose eyes was neuer off him) the Musicke beganne to sound againe, and the olde King of Persia, being pleasant and merry with feasting, tooke the Queene by the hand to daunce. Persicles seeing that, tooke Piera . Then sayd the King is there none will make a third? With that Piera desirous to shew Montelyon any fauour, desired him to doe it: but hee with mildnesse and low courtesie made a refusall, in regard of his duty to the King of Persia. But suddenly Palian stept vppe, and tooke Praxentia to dance with him, who being of a milde behauiour, refused not, and the rather that none should note her affection to Montelyon , which shee assured her selfe, he could not call in question. Montelion was exceedingly vexed to be so preuented, yet smothering the same with a pleasant countenance, the measures being ended, the K. of Persia with the Q. departed leauing them to theyr recreation: Then Palian began to be disquyet with feare, least Montelion by conference with Praxentia would make knowne his last deceyt, and he by that meanes be preuented of all future hope, that he vsed such meanes, that Montelyon could haue no conference with her, which he by reason of his feare durst not with boldnesse seeke, nor she greatly expect, thinking to haue a time of more conuenience to meete. All this time Montelyon did but intangle himselfe faster in the snares of affection, still looking to like, and liking to loue, and the more hee looked, the more he loued, being for that time onely contented to looke, for other hope hee attayned not, by reason of Palians preuention, and his owne feare to be accounted ouerbolde, which she thought she might well impute to his meane estate. The time of departure being come, and euery one ready to bid adiew, Praxentia gaue him a signe of her loue, with a gentle and kinde loue, and he her of his duty with a low courtesie. Euery one parted, Praxentia troubled with doubt of she could not well tell what: for waying his behauiour, she could not compare it to bee like the behauiour of an assured Louer: neither could she account it disdaine nor want of gouernment, for she knew him wise, nor want of audacity, for hee was bolde enough in other matters, nor to inconstancy, for shee could not perceiue his lookes bent vpon any other. Troubled with a multitude of these passions, by reason of her little suspect of the truth, she made the best construction of all things, wishing Palian had been further off that day, whom she thought of purpose intercepted their conference. But to ease her of these troubled thoughts, Lanula comes in with a message from Palian , who as soone as the company was parted, went to her, and noting with what little respect Montelyon had that day regarded her, he thought some misconceit might crosse his purposed intent: and fearing withall, least she should send to him, he sent this message: that with all humility, he desired her not to misconceiue his meaning for the little respect he gaue to her, was with no other intent, but to auoyde suspition, his heart being entirely bound in all dutie to her commaund. This message pleased her well, and vanished all mists of care from her heart, deuising with Lanula , for a conuenient time to haue conference with him. Montelyon likewise had taken such a view of her beautie, that he now yeelded to be Loues thrall, and according to his distempered minde could be pleased with nothing but solitarynesse, in silence to meditate vpon his fortune, on his loue, and on his likelyhood to attaine thereto, on Palians preuention, on his vnknowne estate, and on his vowed iourney in search of Constantia , troubled with such contrarieties, that he could not resolue himselfe of any comfort: tyring his sences with meditation, wearing his heart with griefe, and weakening his body with abstinence, voyd of hope, meanes, or comfort and yet neyther able to dispaire, nor scarce daring to goe forward, then he thought to write, but he wanted a secret messenger: then he thought himselfe to speake with her, but he feared a denyall would be his reward, and that would be worse then death? Thus troubled in minde, he betooke himselfe to his rest, scarce able to giue his eyes one minutes rest vntill morning: and then agayne as voyde of comfort, as if he dreamed of a thousand impossibilities, neyther able by the counsell of Persicles , nor otherwise, to deuise a meane to speake to her: for his loue was now so violent, that it could not be permanent, Fortune intending quickly to ouerturne the same: for Palyon by indirect pollicy dealt so cunningly, that by often recourse vnto her, hee at the last wonne her to such an absolute consent, that she rested wholly at his disposition, neuer comming to her but in secret, and so late, that all lights were out: besides Lanula being olde, first taking him for Montelion , neuer made question but that it was he: by which meanes, he passed still vndiscryed, and betrayed the secrets of her heart to his priuity, that whatsoeuer hee desired, she would performe, and whatsoeuer hee counselled her vnto, was but to preuent all meanes of discouering his disloyalty: perswading her to keepe her chamber for many dayes, which shee likewise performed. That contrary to her expectation, with distemperature of watching, and keeping her selfe in the close Chamber, shee beganne indeed to waxe sickly, which Lanula made knowne to him, appoynting him the next day to come to her, and hee should know when agayne to visite her: in the meane time, she had wrought so with the King and Queene, that they had appoynted her to bee her Keeper, and none might come at her, but by her sufferance, which pleased Praxentia well. Night being come, Palion gat him to Lanulas chamber, where he found her of purpose to meete him, declaring all that had hapned, appointing him that night to come thither. Lanula returning to Praxentia , would not make knowne his comming to her that night, with no other intent but that Praxentia should not breake her sleepe. At the time appointed, Palian was in the Garden, and Lanula ready to receiue him, conducting him by the stayres of Praxentias Chamber, who was in her bed and fast a sleepe. Palian seating himselfe close by her, although the Lights were extinct, yet by the light of the Moone, which with her cleerest light shone vpon the Bed, hee might take a perfect view of her: who by reason of the heat, lay with all the Curtaines folded, and the couering that lay vpon her so thin that the full proportion of her delicate body might easily bee discerned, the same being turned downe beneath her wast, with her necke naked, and her Iuory brests passing description, laying foorth theyr beauties, her armes spred the one aboue her head, the other downe by her side. Palian beheld this pleasant sight, which was able to rauish the sences of a most modest beholder, wherewith his heart was so enflamed, that he had much a doe to abstaine from touching that beauty. After, he had not stood long, but Praxentia being distempered with some slumbring motion, awaked and espying one so neare her bedside, was ready to giue a shrike, but with more regard marking his habite, she knew him, shrowding her selfe from his sight, vntill hee entreated her to pardon his boldnesse, Protesting his intent was not to disquiet her. Neyther am I disquieted quoth she, now I know you, but I maruell I was not acquainted with your comming, it is Lanulas doing hath thus immodestly vsed me. I humbly beseech you (qd. he) take no offence thereat, but pardon vs both, the greatest fault being mine, for which I am contented to bide any punishment. Your punishment (quoth shee) can not be great, your offence being done to me, that loue you more then my selfe, hauing giuen my selfe to you, that if I haue discouered modesty will not permit, yet the offence being procured by you, you may pardon it. The sight qd. he, can procure no offence, for that it hurteth not, therefore in seeing I committed not iniury: but where there is mutuall loue, and consent in loue, there nothing can breed offence but disloyalty which is as far from me, as impossibilities: therefore I trust I can offend no way but in that, and in that I will neuer offend. All this quoth she, may be graunted in you but not in me. For I count it a great offence to be immodest, and nothing more contrary to perfect vertue. You cannot offend in that quoth he, to me, for hauing giuen your selfe mine, why should I not both see, touch and enjoy you? the first being granted, the last cannot be denyed. It is not the outward action that vniteth the heart, but the inward consent. I deny not (quoth she) all that I haue is yours, by mine owne gift and free consent, yet you must forbeare possession vntill the bargaine be confirmed by witnesse: otherwise your Title is not good. Yes (quoth he) my title is better by your gift, then by a thousand witness: for if you deny, they cannot auaile me: therefore since you cannot deny me interest, yeeld me possession. These words were intermingled with many kisses and embracings, able to stir affection in sencelesse creatures; so that Praxentia vnderstood his meaning more by his behauiour then by his words, that she said. Deare Knight, I vnderstand your meaning, which I will not, nor cannot grant, but in any thing else you shall command me, onely I desire and am resolued to preserue my Uirginity without blemish: therefore good Knight request not that, hauing so much as you cannot desire more, my selfe, my company, my loue, my life, and all are at your disposition, onely I challenge you (as you are a Knight) not to blemish my vertue. Notwithstanding he so much preuailed with her at the last, that she gaue her consent he should the next night be joyned to her in marriage, by such meanes as she would compasse, and then hee should without denyall attaine his desire. This contented him not, but he grew to such importunate requests, intermingled with such Oathes and Protestations, being such, as no reasonable creature, but one of a shamelesse disposition would haue vttered or requested: withall framing in himselfe such a kind of desperate behauiour, that she could not tell well how to deny him: that at last she called Lanula vnto her, whispering a few words in her eare: whereupon she presently drew the Curtaynes, and went out of the Chamber. Palian seeing that, put off his apparell, and layd himselfe downe by her, folding her delicate body in his armes, with sweet embracings, expressing both their loues, but Praxentia kept her word, for notwithstanding he did what else hee desired, yet she reserued her Uirginity undissolued. Assuring him by so many entreaties to leaue that vnattempted, and often intermingling her words with such effusion of teares, that the hardest hearted, and most remorselesse creature in the world would haue yeelded vnto: Promising him if she did not compasse her marriage the next night, yet he should assuredly attaine his desire, though she hazarded her selfe to accomplish it. In these and such like speeches, the night was vnawares to them ouerpast, and the necessity of the time enforced his departure, so that taking his leaue of her with many ceremonious farewels, he apparelled himselfe, and left her to meditate on that which had past betwixt them. How Montelyon discovered Palians deceit, and how hee was in some sort revenged. Hasting Persicles to depart in search of Constantia . It fortuned that Montelyon that Morning was earely vp, and more earely then any vsed, possessed with a troubled head, and a Loue-sicke heart, and walking vp and downe the Gardens, at last in a heauy dumps he sate downe in an Arbour right ouer against Praxentiaes Lodging, euen at such time, as Palian departed, who seeing one in secret come from thence, he priuily followed him, till Palian came to his Lodging. Montelyon then began verily to thinke that it was some Messenger, eyther sent from her to Palian or returned with answere of some Message he had deliuered, or that it might be Palian himselfe, whom he resembled in proportion, though not in habit. The day now waxing aged, he found out Persicles , with whom he kept company all the day, thinking indeed it was Palian himselfe that he had seene, for that he kept his Chamber most part of the day: when it grew towards night he againe disguised himselfe, and gyrding his Sword to his side, he entred the Garden, and as he walked by the doore, with purpose to take vp his standing in the Arbour Lanula was come downe by that way, to bring a Fryer in, which should secretly knit vp the marriage, according to the agreement betwixt her and Praxentia , and espying one goe by, shee thinking it had beene he that appoynted to come, called, saying; who is there, Montelion ? Hee hearing that, sayd, it is I. You come too soone, quoth she, the Fryer that should marry you to Praxentia , is not yet come, whom I am now going to seeke. Montelyon was halfe amazed: but thinking to finde out the truth, said, What shall I then doe? Returne to your Chamber, quoth she, and change your Apparell, for if you come in this, she will be offended, for she is very fearefull, and many troubled thoughts haue possest her head this day: she did fall out with me wonderfully, for bringing you in the last night, when shee was in bed, but when she bad me draw the Curtaynes, and be gone, I thought you would haue pleased her ere yee parted: but in faith tell me, was she not kinde? Had you not that you would haue? Montelyon blusht to heare her immodest questions, making no answere, soothing her vntill her clattering tongue had bewrayed all the mischiefe her selfe was guilty of. Well, quoth shee, stay hereby till I am returned, and then you shall goe in with mee, for I dare not let you in before. Montelion wondring at this accident, by the circumstance of that he had heard, assuring himselfe, that some man in his name had attained Praxentias loue, which fretted his heart with such vexation, that he was ready to runne mad with griefe: but calling himselfe to better remembrance, he sayd: you may saue that labour, I haue dealt with a faithfull friend to that effect, who promised to meete me here within this houre, therefore returne to Praxentia , my selfe will stay his comming. Lanula thought nothing, but went in, telling Praxentia why shee returned so soone. Montelyon couering his Face, as priuily as he could from being discryed, walking vp and downe by the doore, and within short space espyed Palion comming, asking, who was there. Are you Montelyon ? I am he, answered Palian : I am the Fryer (qd. he) that am appoynted to marry you to Praxentia . with that Palyon embraced him, desiring him to make no question, but with all speed to dispatch the thing he had vndertaken. I will doe it, quoth he, out of hand: being both together come to the doore, and by Lanula brought vp into the Chamber, Praxentia embraced Palion saying: Welcome my deare Knight Montelyon , this ioyfull houre shall make vs both happy, which I haue with great desire wished for. I cannot, quoth he, yeeld you more then hearty thankes, vowing by heauen and earth neuer to deale disloyally with you, in thought, word, nor deede: therefore according to your pleasure, let it be done: Montelyon so well as he could, counterfeited the Fryer, desiring to haue a light. My friend quoth Palian, it may discouer vs. Shall I then, quoth he, marry I know not whom. Lanula said, neuer feare to be discouered, for on my life, there is none suspecteth it: with that she lighted a candle, setting it a farre off on the table. With that he said to Praxentia , this is not Montelion , but some villayne, that hath betrayed you: and discouering his face, both knew him. Praxentias heart with sudden griefe, feare and amazement, was ready to burst, he with a pale and dismayed countenance, stood as one transformed; and Lanula with feare and aboundance of teares, stood wringing her hands. Praxentia could not speake a word with griefe to be so deceiued by him the most hated: and he with very shame, stood as one sencelesse: whilest Montelyon sayd, What disloyall and dishonourable dealing is this in a Prince, whose minde should harbour nothing but vertue, can dissimulation take such deepe roote in a royall brest, then well may base-borne Peasants be excused for barbarous and faithlesse dealing: vnworthy to bee so worthy of that name: Was there none to exercise your detested practise vpon, but the daughter of a Royall King, and in the name of a strange Knight, that by his deeds seeketh honour: what impiety can bee compared to this, or who can hope for vertue in that breast that harboureth such deceit: Indeede such an Acte desireth obscurity: therefore you did well to deny vs light: for were it day, the Sunne would blush, or withdraw her bright splendor amongst the mysty cloudes to behold it. Well may he liue, but for euer will he be hated, that seeketh to fulfill his content by such dishonoured impiety. Base fellow quoth Palyon , presumest thou vpon my lenitie to abuse me: I count it not dishonour to winne the loue of so beautifull a Lady, by any hazzard: yet it grieueth mee, that I was compelled to name my selfe after him that I account my inferiour, I quoth Praxentia , you are inferiour in birth, but not in vertue. By heauen quoth Montelyon , thou hast so much dishonoured this Lady, and iniured him, that thou art not worthy to liue, and were it not for offending her sacred eyes with slaughter, she should behold thy massacre. With that he drew his sword. Nay good friend, quoth shee, stay thy hand, indeed it will offend me: Therefore let him goe, and liue to his dishonour and my shame: for I will not be guilty of his death. And I beseech thee as thou fauourest vertue, not to disclose this to any, least hearing it spoken by others, it procure my death, as for him, I thinke shame of himselfe will withhold him from blazing his owne and my reproach: for Lenula she hath done me wrong against her will. For my part deare Lady, quoth he, it shall neuer passe my lips, whilest life doth last, for I so much abhorre the fact, that I hate to speake of it. Palian seeing his pollicy disclosed (though it was now no time of recantations: for he well perceiued Praxentia absolutely hated him) was so ouercome, that hee stood as a liuing creature transformed to a sencelesse picture; whilest Praxentia puld from of her necke a rich Iewell which she gaue Montelyon , in consideration of his paines, withdrawing herselfe from their company. Palian what with shame and griefe went thence in a rage, ready to runne madde, spending his time in such anguish, studyes, plots and deuices, which was to winne her Loue, that before many dayes hee became so sicke, that all men expected nothing but his death. Montelyon , casting off the affection he had entertained, with conceit that Palian had dishonoured her, as hee might well suppose by Lanulas speeches, hasted Persicles in search of Constantia , not once discouering why he had so suddenly altered his minde, resoluing neuer to set his fancy on any Ladyes beauty, which did but disquiet the minde, and make it vnapt to practise vertue: purposing neuer to leaue searching, though it were through all the world to finde his parents, and ayd him in search of Constantia . The day prefixed being now come, they armed themselues, none knowing the intent of their departure but Piera . Taking their leaues of the King and Queene with great solemnity, the hearty loue of thousands of Persians , wishing them good successe, many seeming dead with griefe for their departure, who with their Tilt, Turneyes & Tryumphs, had delighted the eyes of the beholders. Persicles was armed in blacke armour, with all his furniture correspondent: and Montelyon in an armour of silver, without any deuise at all therein, with his Steed and furniture as white as Snow, that by their difference, they might easily be knowne from all men. Of certaine strange adventures that befell Persicles and Montelyon , by which they were parted. And the conference that Persicles had with Delatus , which contayneth the History of Delatus misfortunes. And how Persicles by Delatus counsell returned into Assyria . Being without the City, and parted from all company, they trauelled directly towards Arabia , spending many dayes journey witheut aduenture, and ouerpassing the tediousnesse of theyr trauaile in conference of sundry matters, but especially Persicles desciphered the fauour, proportion, beauty, and countenance of Constantia : that Montelyon might (if he came in their company vnknowne) the better know her. With tedious trauell they arriued in a pleasant Ualley, through the middest whereof, ran a most pleasant Riuer, whose chrystall streames ran with great swiftnesse, washing the Peble Stones in her bottome so cleare, that they might easily be discerned, riding along by the Riuers side, they beheld a farre off two Damzels all in white on horsebacke, crossing the Medow with such swiftnesse, that they were both soone out of sight, Montelyon desiring to know what they were, desired Persicles to stay his return. With that he spurd his Steed, who ranne so swiftly, that the earth seemed to shake vnder him: he rode a mile before he could ouertake them, but so soone as they espyed him, they turned backe, and before he could aske the question, one of them sayd: as you are a Knight and fauour the distresse of wronged Ladyes, pitty vs, and vouchsafe your ayde to redeeme our Mistresse, that euen now was taken away from vs by three mighty Giants. Faire Uirgins, quoth he, I professe Armes, and to my vttermost will I ayde you, else were I not worthy the name of a Knight: therefore let me know her name. She is daughter to Amphiador Duke of Ila , her name is Philotheta , for beauty, vertue, modesty, shape, courtesie, humility, temperance, chastity and wisedome, not to bee equalled, therefore the more to be pittyed, and succoured in distresse: we are posting backe to bring this heauy Newes to the Court, and whilest we stay here, she runneth in farther danger. Which way went they quoth he, Directly by the way we came sayd they, whom we would haue followed further, but that we durst not venture ouer the Riuer after them. With that Montelyon turned backe, declaring to Persicles what he had heard. If report lye not sayd Persicles , the Damzels haue not flatteringly praised her, I haue before this heard of her. Then both of them hasted to follow her, passing the Riuer with much danger of drowning, by reason of the depth: They had not rode aboue two houres, but after they met a Country Swaine, running forwards and looking backwards so fearfully, as if he had beene neerely pursued. Fellow, sayd Persicles , what aylest thou? O sir, quoth he, I met with three the monstrous Creatures that euer I beheld, carrying a Lady that made wonderfull Lamentation. Hearing that, they posted downe the way which was beaten plaine: at last the same parted into two wayes, being doubtfull which of them to seeke, at last they concluded to part, embracing each other, as if they should not meet againe: Persicles on the right hand and Montelyon on the left. Of whose seuerall aduentures, strange accidents befell. Persicles rode on with great swiftnesse, not once able to set eye on them, for that way they went not, therefore he spent much labour in vaine, vntill it drew to night, and then he thought it vaine to seeke them, wandring along to seeke some conuenient place to rest in which he could not doe, for those Desarts were vninhabited. At last drawing neere vnto a rocky hill, he might espye a glimmering light, as it were to shine through the hollow Cliffes thereof, and thitherwards he drew, perceiuing it to be some poore Habitation, he alighted, tying his Horse to a bush, and knocking at the doore, which of it selfe opened, he espyed an aged old man sitting ouer a little fire in which he was busily turning of Rootes which he rosted. Who casting vp his eyes, and espying Persicles , sayd to him: Come in good Knight, Distresse I know hath brought you hither, else would you not walke those Desarts so late. Pardon me good Father, quoth he, this bold intrusion: You guesse aright of my estate, for I haue wandred out of my way, and sought long for some habitation, but was frustrated, vntill I was drawne hither by the sight of your Candle, Sir (sayd the old man) you are welcome, and I would I were able to comfort you in some good sort, but such as this my poore habitation yeildeth, if you please to stay this night, shall be at your command. Neyther are you the first that hath beene entertained thus by me, therefore disdaine me not, nor my good will. Father, quoth he, I gratefully accept your good offer, and thank you for this kindnes, that exceedeth my desert, or meanes to requite: and the rather I desire your company and conference, for that I am but a stranger in these countries, and would gladly heare something thereof by your report. Sir quoth the old man, first sit downe, and take such spare dyet as my store affordeth, and afterwards I will be ready to declare what I can to satisfie you. Which when they had done, the Hermite thus began. Sir, I shall first discouer what I am, and the cause of my liuing in this desolate obscure place: and withall discouer those things that (you may suppose) are beyond my knowledge: For no want, misfortune, nor feare of being discouered, hath made me chuse this kind of life, but mine owne voluntary fancy, which perswadeth I can no other way liue, so well agreeing with my vnfortunate disposition: neither would I haue you thinke I intend to fill your eares with idle prattle or repetition of toyes, but as I intend to ease your heart of some of the care it possesseth: So I desire you by hearing my misfortune, and ayding my estate, to ease me, or at least, to comfort me with some hope of your fauourable assistance: for I know your name, your Countrey, your cause of trauell, your meanes of remedy, and your successe hereafter: which I will declare vnto you, after your patience hath heard out my tragicke History, which I can not chuse but vtter first. Persicles wondred to heare his speech, little thinking he could performe what he promised, but yet determining to try him, and desirous of comfort, he intreated him to proceed, for he was desirous to heare his discourse. Sir, sayd the Hermite, my name in my flourishing estate was called Delatus , my dignity the Dukedome of Ila , which I enjoyed many yeares in great quiet being both enriched in the guifts of Fortune, and of Nature; for in my youth I chanced to set my affection on the beauty of Alsala , Daughter vnto a Gentleman of Antiochia , not for her possessions, but for her beauty, which surpassed all the Ladies of the South parts of this Continent. I sued long and at last attained her consent, maryed her, and brought her into Ila , where I liued with her a yeare in great quiet and content: being within that space enriched with a Daughter, naming her Philotheta , in her Infancy shewing that more yeares would performe in her more exquisite beauty, which is the Uirgin that you now trauell in search of. Liuing in this blissefull content, there chanced a Knight named Amphiador to take a view of my faire Alsalaes beauty, which at the first sight pierced so deepe that he was entangled therewith, and laboured by all means to grow into Familiarity, thereby to enjoy more fully her sight, and company: Fortune and my selfe so fauouring him, that I esteemed so well of his company, that I thought my selfe not well when he was from me: He on the other side seeming so much to affect me that I admired his kindnesse. All this time did he insinuate himselfe into Alsalaes company, she likewise esteeming so honourably of him, that by reason of the loue betwixt him and me, & her owne little suspect of his disloyall dealing, she at all times admitted him her company, and vsed him so kindly and familiarly, that she made him priuy to most of her secret counsels. Notwithstanding, all this, he durst not manifest his loue to her, seeing indeed her vertues to be such, that he thought it impossible to attaine it, thinking it better rather to liue in silence and enjoy her company, then by vttering his affection to be depriued of all comfort. Upon a time likewise, as he did, there arriued at my Castle an other Knight, named Pallesus , whom in the same manner that he had done, surfeited on my Alsalaes beauty, and was both admitted mine and Amphiadors company: both of vs esteeming well of him for many honourably qualities, that he was endued withall. He as little suspecting Ampiadors loue as he did his, nor I myselfe, nor Alsala once thinking any such matter, for that one kindnes bred in vs familiarity, that many passionate and amorous actions might be acted: and yet on no side suspected. Thus did I liue in great content some two yeares, spending the time in Hawking, Hunting, and other pastimes, as voyd of disquiet as heart could wish, thinking my selfe happy in their kindnesse, but most in my faire Alsalaes loue. They with coloured courtesie seeming to liue by enjoying my good company and familiarity, and she as much as I esteeming them for their loue. But at last this pleasant Summer began to turne to winter, and our sweet content to discontent, for Pallesus loue burst into a flame, which he was unable to restraine, that in secret sort he gaue my Alsala knowledge thereof, which was as delightfull for her to heare, as it is for one to heare that he hath drunke poyson: but notwithstanding, her mind being endued with courtesie, and her Soule with Uertue, in kind sort she reprooued him, wishing him not to prosecute any such matter, for she would neuer yeeld thereto. Notwithstanding her courteous denyall bred in him no remorce, but rather a hope of comfort, that continually he followed his sute, which bred an exceeding trouble and disquiet in her heart, that whereas she was before delightfully pleasant, she became oftentimes so melancholy and sad that I wondred thereat, but could not learne the cause thereof, thinking it had beene rather some Sicknesse then passion of mind. Being long in this sort troubled with his loue, she began to deuise how to be rid of it, but so as it might not come to my knowledge: for vertuous loue made her loth to disquiet me, relying vpon Amphiadors vertues, she thought by his assistance to rid her selfe of Pallesus : and therefore on a time, being with him alone in secret, she declared the whole circumstance of all to him, declaring his counsell and disswade Pallesus from intending me such dishonour. Amphiadors heart was suddenly possest with a jealous conceit against the sayd Pallesus : but withall he meant by that meanes to attaine his desire, therefore comming to Pallesus , he told him what Alsala had made him priuy vnto, not disswading him, but counselling him to persist therein, promising he would by all the meanes hee could further the same. Pallesus was somewhat comforted therewith, and Alsala was more cheerefull, as hoping by Amphiadors meanes to be rid of her Louer. Amphiador one day, being alone with mee in my Forrest, first vsing many intreaties to me to be secret, and binding me by many oathes, without his aduice, not to declare it to any: he told me that Pallesus did make loue to Alsala , and that it was likely she would yeeld thereto, giuing me knowledge that oftentimes they met in secret, and withall counselling me but to note their glances and behauiours, and I should finde that to be true which I then least thought of: Protesting that meere loue to me, regard of mine Honor, and his owne duty, bound him to discouer that, which otherwise he would neuer haue reuealed. With this my mind was much disquieted, neuerthelesse I would not too rashly giue credit to his speeches, before I had obserued their behauiour some time, which I found to be somewhat familiar, on deepe affection on his part, but on hers, with a contrary intent, lest her countenance should bewray his loue to me, which she knew would breed my disquiet: by reason of Amphiadors perswasions, who continually augmented my suspicion, I verily began to suspect them, and grew to extreame jealousie, assuring my selfe they dealt disloyally with me, purposing to worke reuenge against them, but then he began to perswade me to be well aduised, and not to condemne them without manifest proofe: as much perswading me from thinking so, as he had before done to perswade me thereto: but then nothing could alter my mind, my vehement suspect neither suffering me to be quiet, nor yet to find his deceit: So that one day being alone, I complained against my hard Fortune, and her disloyalty: in midst of which complaints he found me out, intending by my ouerthrow to worke his owne desire. I seeing him so neare me, after much conference desired him as a Friend to counsell me the best way to salue these euils, to be assured of the truth, and yet to doe it without mine owne reproach, or her scandall: for that I was loth to accuse her without just proofe. If I may quoth he, presume to counsell you, thus would I aduise you to doe: the King is now sicke, and hath sent for many of his nobles to come to him: say you likewise that you haue receiued Letters from him, and that you must three dayes hence depart towards the Court: By this you shall easily find out the truth hereof, & at the time of your departure, desire Pallesus to beare you company: which if he refuse you may then iudge of him accordingly: Myselfe will then accompany you vnto my Castle, wherein you shall remaine in secret some certaine dayes, and I in a disguise, vnknowne of any, will returne and by my faithfull diligence, will from time to time note their behauiour, and so find the truth thereof. I liked well of his counsell, and followed the same, making my departure knowne to Alsala , who with a heauy heart lamented to heare of my absence, which then by reason of my suspect I esteemed to be dissimulation. Amphiador in the meane time went to Pallesus , and told him that I intended by reason of some conceit or suspicion, I had lately conceiued, to carry him with me vnto the Court: and therefore he willed him to be absent at that instant. The time of my departure being come, I thought to try Pallesus , but he was gone, which augmented my suspicion to a resolution: but intending to try the vttermost of all, and trusting to Amphiadors faithfull dealing, I went with him vnto his Castle, staying there some three dayes: in the meane time (I thinking he had beene returned to my Castle) he went to an Enchanter named Penthrasus , and brought him to my Castle, shewing him Philotheta , promising him, that if he would but worke meanes to rid me away, that I might neuer returne, when she came to yeeres, to procure her to consent to his loue. Penthrasus at the first sight liked the proffer, and promising to vndertake the same, taking a solemne oath neuer to discouer the same. Now fearing least some other should preuent him, and to auoyd his Wiues suspition, who had great knowledge in Negromancy, and often by her skill, crost his practises, and withall vnwilling to be any way guilty of blood, after I was deliuered to him, he brought me into this place, casting such charmes and incantations vpon me, that I shall neuer be released: which when he had done, he told me the cause why he had done it, and withall Amphiadors practice against me, I then intreated him to release me, promising him to fulfill whatsoeuer Amphiador had promised him: but no perswasion could preuaile, for he told me he had bound himselfe by a solemne vow to performe it, which he could not breake, for if he did, with that he should loose the vertue of his Art. Then did I lament my Misfortune with bitter exclaimes: but he told me it was in vaine, and so departed. Here did I liue many yeares, vntill I was quite past all hope of comfort, thinking to end my dayes in this place, without euer hearing of them againe: but at last Penthrasus came to me againe, rehearsing the sequell of this History as followeth. Amphiador being sure enough of me, returned to my Castle, and comming to Alsala , after long circumstance and protestations, told, that the day that I went from thence, Pallesus hauing before complotted such a Stratagem, had set vpon me with an ambush of men, and slaine me, telling the same with such protestations and probabilities of truth, that Alsala could not chuse but beleeue him, counselling her in secret to apprehend him, and cast him in Prison. Alsala had much adoe to keepe life within her body, hauing scarce breath enough to command her Seruants to apprehend him, whilest Amphiador laboured with such as were about her to keepe life in her. The rumour of my death was soone spread abroad, and my Seruants beleeuing the same, some posted to the Court, some searched for my body, neyther finding me aliue nor dead, for which Amphiador still had an accusation: ready to satisfie any doubt, Pallesus hearing that it was Amphiador accused him, and for no lesse matter then my death, according as he well might, denyed the same, by often intreaties desiring Alsala , to let him be admitted to his tryall: but she ouerswayed by Amphiadors perswasions, being before troubled with Pallesus loue, whereby he sought to dishonour mee that was his friend, which bred a perswasion in her, that to attaine that, he sought my life, would giue no credit to him: but resolued he would dye, And within few dayes apparrelling her selfe, her seruants, and all her attendants in mournefull weedes, she departed towards the Court, crauing justice of the King against Pallesus for murdering me: the King told her she should haue justice, Pallesus was brought before the King, and there accused by Amphiador , he alleadging what false accusations he could, and the other still pleading his innocency, that in the end Amphiador desired the King to graunt him the Combate against Pallesus , which should end the doubt of this Controuersie. The King granted it, and appoynted a day for the tryall. In which cruell fortune so ordered the issue, that Pallesus was slaine, and all men accounted him guilty, and me dead, yeelding much honour to Amphiador , and the King in recompence of his supposed loyalty to me, and for that I dyed without an heyre, created him Duke of it, yet reseruing the liuing to Alsala , during her life. This being done, Alsala returned towards Ila and Amphyador with her, but very sore Wounded: of whom he had a most especiall care, tendring him as her selfe, for the Loue he had showne her in becomming her Champion for reuenge of my Death. After he had recouered his Wounds, he continued many dayes with her, not once motioning any Loue to her, seeming with her to mourne for my losse: But as all things by Time weare out of Remembrance, so did her sorrow of mee, and she beganne to conceyue well of him: Which he perceiuing, prosecuted his Loue with such successe, that in the end he married her, and euer since hath liued with her: Which when Penthrasus declared vnto me, it attained my heart with deadly griefe. Then I desired him to release me from that misery. Neyther doe I intend to clayme the performance of Amphiadors promise, for that Philotheta was Fayre, Chaste, and Uertuous: Neither will I reueale this secret to any but your selfe, nor shall you depart from hence, vntill the aduenture of the enchanted Tower be ended, built by Helyon , wherein he hath shut Constantia , Daughter to the King of Persia , and betroathed Wife to Persicles King of Assyria : Who shall be the first Knight that shall arriue in this place: Neither shall that Enchauntment be ended by any but Persicles Sonne, begotten of Constantia : For (qd. he) the date of my Life is neare an end: and at such time as Persicles arriueth here (Will him, when he hath heard this report) to returne into Assiria , to establish his Kingdome in Peace: For it will be in vaine for him to spend his Dayes in trauell to Redeeme her, the finishing thereof must be by his owne Sonne. When he had spoken these words he vanished, appoynting me to a certaine bound which I cannot passe, nor any yet came into but onely your selfe, which assureth me that you are Persicles , and trauell in search of Constantia . You haue (said Persicles ) filled my heart with Feare, Hope, and Comfort. the one striuing to ouer-master the other feare, that the Enchaunter dissembled: For that I haue as yet no Sonne, nor neuer shall haue by Constantia : for she being still Enchaunted, how shall I attaine her company? Yet againe I am somewhat comforted, that he could as well tell who should finish the Enchantment he had made, as of my comming to this place: for I am the most forlorne King of Assiria, that shall neuer enioy comfort vntill she be released, which doubt perswadeth me will neuer be: For if I must now returne into Assyria , how shall I hope to finde comfort? Yet be of good comfort, quoth Delatus : for hope hath preserued my life many yeares: assuring me selfe that Penthrasus tolde me nothing but what was true, and shall assuredly come to passe, both your comfort, and my long looked-for Releasement beeing appoynted both to one houre, Why should you then despayre more then I, since both our comforts resteth on her release? But according to his counsell, trauell no further, for it were vayne to doe that which can yeeld no hope of comfort. In doing that (quoth Persicles ) I shall both dishonour my selfe, and leaue my Friend vnkindly, whose deserts hath bound my life to requite his Loue; he hath onely for my sake vndertaken to trauell in Constantias search: the cause of whose departure from me, was in search of your Daughter Philotheta , that is reputed Daughter to Amphiador , who was this day stolne from Ila , by certayne Gyants: Then he declared how they came to knowledge thereof. It did him good to heare that she was liuing, insomuch that he reioyced exceedingly thereat: Withall, enquiring of him what Knight that was, that was gone in her rescue. Persicles then said, it were too tedious to make Recitall of him: for then I should rehearse the discourse of my misfortunes. Were it not (quoth Delatus ,) troublesome to you, I would earnestly require your fauour to heare it. To requite your kindnesse (quoth he) I will rehearse the same, which yet I haue concealed from all men but Montelyon . With that hee declared the whole Historie, from the beginning of his first Loue to Constantia , vntill that houre. Which when he had heard, his heart was filled with Admiration, who that Knight Montelion should bee, his Fancie perswading him hee should end the Enchantment, had not the doubt that he was Persicles Sonne giuen likelyhood of the contrary. The night was spent in these discourses, and bright Phoebus lightned the darkenesse of that Desart, Persicles neither willing to depart nor stay: Sometimes minding to finde out Montelyon , and to bid him Farewell: but at last perswaded by Delatus , taking his leaue of him with many Farewels, he mounted his Steede, and so departed directly towards Assyria . Of a Combat Montelyon fought against three Gyants, and how he rescued Philotheta . And what befell them in an Hermits Cell. pace after Philotheta , still hauing intelligence which way they went, by such as met them: he ouertooke them about the setting of the Euening: vsing few words vntill he had dealt some blowes, running at the hindermost with so fierce a carriage, that he ouerturned him with his heeles vpwards, the other two looking behinde them, beganne to laugh at theyr fellowes fortune, thinking that he had receyued that fall by chance: but looking further, then espyed Montelyon running so violently against the second, that had he not auoyded the point of his Launce, he had seconded his fellow, or light on worse fortune. With that one of them sayd: This fellow is very bolde now, but hee will trust to his heeles anon. This sayd the first that was ouerthrowne, ran towards Montelyon , offering such a forcible blow at him, that had he not spurd his Steed to auoyd him, he had eyther slayne him or his horse, but he knowing it better, to fight on foot then on horse-backe, alighted, whilst the Gyant came towards him agayne, thinking at one blow to beat him in peices: the other two seeing him on foote, went away laughing, but the Gyant missing his ayme, by reason of Montelyons nimblenesse, was ready to turne about, with the Force of his compasse blow: in which time Montelyon leapt within him, and thrust his Sword so farre into his Body, that he fell downe dead: the other two hearing that, one of them came running backe to rescue him, whom Montelyon soone espyed, being ready to receiue him: and seeing no more ods, but one to one, thought his Combat was not vnequall. The Gyant seeing the other dead, thought at once to end Montelyons life that he drove at him with all his force, but he auoyded his blow not yet daring to come within him, vntill he was somewhat out of breath, being furious for reuenge, but more mad to misse so many blowes, he strooke so full and violently at Montelyon , that his massy Clubbe stucke in the earth, which whilest he laboured to pull out, Montelyon strooke him so full a blow on the arme, that he cut the same quite from his body, wherewith hee gaue such an exceeding groane, that all the place rung with the noyse thereof, running away as fast as he could towards Montelyons steed, whom he affrighted much with his grisly and blustering approach, that he brake in sunder the reynes of his bridle, and ranne away with great swiftnesse: Montelyon was exceedingly vexed for want of his Steed, not knowing for want of him what to doe: and by reason of the nights approach he still pursued the Gyant, keeping him within sight so long as he could, which at last he lost: Seeing himselfe so disappoynted, and vnhorst, he began to study what to doe: at last being past hope of eyther finding them, or recouering his horse, by reason of the darknes of the night, he went wandring vp and downe to seeke a place of rest, and by chance lighted on a wood into which he entred, but fearing to rest, least some wilde beaste might deuoure him, he wandred on, with purpose to passe through the same, where suddenly he heard the sound of a big voyce, which made him stand still  & listen, & with soft stepps drawing thitherwards, he perceiued it was the Gyants, that curst and band him for crossing their iourney. What shall wee doe, qd. one of them, shall we stay here, or no? Wee shall wander I know not whether, a plague vpon that white diuell that haunted vs. I am sure he is no man, for we are men, and one man should be as good in fight as another, but you two like Cowardly slaues, haue suffered such a wretch to haue aduantage against you. Hold thy prating qd. the other, thou couldest haue done no more then we: thou needest not vexe me, I am vext enough with the losse of mine arme. Let vs rest here vntill it be day, and then we will away, for he hath worke enough to find his horse. Philotheta was so affrighted with feare, that she lay like one in a dead traunce, to whom one of them sayd. Sweet Philotheta , bee not discomforted nor offended with mee, I haue loued thee long, and long expected this happy houre to enioy thee: be content to lodge on the cold earth one night for my sake, that haue lost many a nights sleepe for thine: neyther shalt thou lye on the earth, for my bodie shall be thy bed, whilest mine armes imbrace thee: Then did he take her in his Armes, bestowing many a loathsome slauering kisse vpon her, but she for feare durst not cry, being almost dead with griefe. Montelyon stood and heard all their vnreuerent vsage, wishing it were day, that be might reuenge theyr disloyalty. They had not laine long, but first the one and then the other fell fast a sleepe, which Montelyon easily perceyued by theyr routing, thinking it no discredit to slaughter such miscreants that delighted in no knightly action, but in wrong and oppression: there with drawing vnto them, Phylotheta espyed him, and at the first sight by reason of his white armour knew him: desirous she was to speake to him, but feare to awake her Keeper withheld her, and yet she knew the care of her affright, detained him from reuenge: At the last, so boldly as she durst, she lifted vp her hand beckning Montelyon to her, and poynting to the gyant: Montelyon vnderstanding her meaning, thrust his sword into him that had her foulded in his armes, who striuing with the pang, gaue her liberty to leape from him, roaring foorth such a groane, as all the wood rung therewith, and his fellow halfe amazed, started vp ready to run away, but Montelyons sword ouertaking his hindermost legge, at one blow cut in sunder the sinewes, and he fell downe, holding vp his hands for mercy: Montelyon with the next blow pierced his braines, and so he dyed a most miserable death. The other had receyued no deadly wound, for the point of his sword lighting vpon one of his ribbes, was stayed from ending his life: who whilest Montelyon was slaughtering the other, had recouered his staffe, bending a full blow at Montelyon , who by good Fortune and Philothetaes shrike, turned about, and espying the same comming, broke halfe the force, and running in withall, ran his sword quite through his aduersaries body, and with the bruise he had receiued, fell downe himselfe in a traunce. Philotheta thought he had beene dead, running to him with great striuing, with her tender hands to vnbuckle his Beauer, and vnlace his Helmit to giue him breath: which though long, yet at last she attained, but in vaine: for hee lay as a man quite bereft of life: her Lamentations were such as would haue turned reuenge to remorse, and those sencelesse trees into teares, yea the Birds hearing her moane, left off their pleasant notes to listen her complaints, the very Earth seemed to weepe to receyue her moystned teares, and all the empty ayre resounded, as repleat with her waylings. Aye me vnfortunate creature (quoth she) to be the cause of so worthy a Knights death: How shall my vnhappy life make recompence for his losse? It had beene better these sauage and inhumane monsters had deuoured me, then this Knight should haue lost his life in my rescue: better it had beene that I had dyed in my cradle, then to liue to see this dismall day, though he be a stranger to mee and I haue had no tryall in his vertues, yet his actions shew the honour of his minde: his valour, his noble education, and his courtesie, his worthy birth: I know by his armour he is not of Arabia , his honourable minde, not hope of requitall, procuring him to venture his life in my rescue, which he hath too vntimely both hazarded and lost: which no doubt, will be as great a losse to his Country and friends, as euer any endured. Were he once reuiued, I would not care what became of my selfe, nor needed I to care, for his vertuous Ualour would shrowd me from iniuries, and be as safe a harbour as security can affoord. Her Lamentations could not so end, but she lengthened them sometimes with weeping, sometimes with lamenting: and then againe ready to drowne her sorrowfull heart in salt teares. Aye me (said she) what shall now become of me? How shall I escape further miserie? Here I am left alone ready to be deuoured of wilde beasts, yet what neede I feare any mischiefe, when so great miserie is befalne mee, as greater cannot be. Her laments conducted the steps of an aged Hermit that dwelt in those woods, vnto the place where she lay weeping ouer Montelion . She suddenly espying him, being halfe affrighted, said. If thou be a man pitty me, and helpe mee to reuiue this Knight. If thou beest a Ghost thinke not to affright me, for I am already full of feare, and if thou beest neither, then tell me what thou art? Damzell, said he, feare not. for I am a liuing creature, as thou art, I pitty thy distresse, and will doe my best to helpe you. With that he kneeled downe by Montelyon rubbing his cheekes, and laying his hand vpon his brest, felt some signe of life in him, and seeking for an hearbe which presently he found, he bruised the same, letting the iuyce fall into his Nostrils. with the vertue whereof his vitall sences returned to their former operations, and his eyes receyued theyr sight: With that raysing himselfe vp vpon his arme, he sayd: I perceyue I haue troubled you, and as it were halfe ashamed of himselfe, he destied her not to be disquieted with his misfortune. Philothetaes heart reioyced to see him reuiued, now he was reuiued, not so well knowing what to say, as she did when he was in his Trance, but her vertue and his desert constraining her, she could doe no lesse then vtter these speeches. Sir Knight, your courtesie so farre beyond my desert, bindeth me to yeeld you thanks, and thanks is an vnsufficient requitall for your paines, although I know you not, nor neuer said you vntill this day, yet your valour and courtesie in deliuering me from Captiuity, hath bound me to become gratefull, and deserueth more recompence then I am able to yeeld. Lady, (said Montelyon .) the Heauens haue assisted you, not my Ualour: which I haue attempted without expectation of recompence: If you thinke well of my paines, it is all the reward I craue. The olde Hermit perceiuing some strange accident had brought them thither, desired them, for that Montelion was sore bruised, and she much affrighted and disquieted, to accept of his Cell to rest them in, vntill they could take better order for their safety. Montelyon thanked him (saying, he was pleased, so it liked the Lady) With that they began to goe, but Montelyon , by reason of his sore bruise, with much a doe could stand: The Hermit taking him by the arme, supported him, whilest he with griefe, that his misfortunes had brought him to such a low estate, said: It ill beseemeth Youth to be supported by Age: but no man can preuent Destiny. Philotheta offered to lend him her arme, but he desired her not to trouble her selfe. Sir said the Hermit, refuse not her courtesie, for in time of neede it is not good to be curious. With that she lent him her arme, but hee tooke her hand, and that he thought too much boldnesse, as the other trouble, striuing against the weaknes he had receiued by his bruise, to goe vpright: she likewise wondred that Nature had wrought such a familiar regard in her, towards him she knew not: often accusing herselfe of Lightnesse, and blushing when he grasped her tender hand, that with feare, and Fancies striuing moystned his Palme: thinking with her selfe. How is my estate altered, that too day was free from care, and so suddenly brought to Bondage, and from bondage to this disquyet, and all in a moment? I am now like one that is content with misery, and yet discontented with that Content: I could wish my selfe from hence and yet were I gone, I should wish my selfe euen here againe, because I desire this Knights Welfare: and yet me thinkes I should not be too Familiar, and yet I know he hath deserued much more courtesie then I can proffer. My minde is affected with a regard of his welfare, and yet am perswaded I should not doe so: and if I should not doe it, he might accuse me of discourtesie: and if I be too kinde, he may deeme me too affable. I would faine know my disquyet, and yet me thinkes I am not disquieted, feeling my minde troubled and know not why, desiring to shake it off, but not knowing how: it is regard of him, not of myselfe that troubleth me, and yet I neither know how to thinke well of him without my owne disquyet, nor how to be quyet without him: many such like cogitations possest her fancie: that and other things for her part shortning the way to the Cell, where they arriued: The Hermit giuing Montelyon a Potion of certaine commixed Drugges, which comforted him greatly, and Philotheta , a cup of Greekish-Wine, which reuiued and quickned her affrighted heart: There was no light in the roome: therefore as yet neither of them had seene each other: Montelyon wisht the day would appeare, that he might behold her Beauty: and shee, that she might beholde whether his person were agreeable to his prowesse: and the Hermit desiring to see what guesse he had entertayned. Seeing them both silent, the one abstained for griefe, the other for Modesty: after he had seated them on soft Rushes and Flagges, he sayd: As it seemeth to me, you are eyther of you Strangers to each other, which maketh me desirous to know what accident hath befallen you? Father (replyed Montelyon ) indeed we are so: for as yet I neuer beheld this Ladyes countenance, yet I know her name is Philotheta , Daughter to the Duke of Ila : Which knowledge I got by this meanes: As then I and another Knight were Trauelling in search of a Lady, that hath long time bin missing, we chanced to espye two Damzels clad in white, passing by vs with great speed, with whom I entred communication, and they told me that this Lady Philotheta was taken away from them by three Gyants, I returned to my Friend with this newes, and both of vs posted after them, vntill at a Crosse-way we parted, thinking if they went eyther way, we should ouertake them, but it was my good fortune to light on them, and by theyr deaths to free this Lady, thinking my labour well bestowed to redeeme her from theyr treachery. Philotheta refrained her speech, onely thanking him, fearing, lest she should seeme more courteous then modesty would permit, or more coy then vertue required. Sir, sayd the Hermit, I know those Gyants, and the manner of their life to be most inhumane, and wicked, whose habitation is not farre off in the Desart of Arabia , by whose death, this Country is freed from much outrage, which they haue, and would dayly haue committed. Sir quoth Montelyon , I pray what Country is this? It is sayd he, Arabia . Doth not Helion sayd he, raigne as King? Sir quoth he, he did raigne as King, but whether he be now liuing or no, it is doubtfull: for some suppose he is dead, others say, he is Enchanted in a Tower he built himselfe, scituate not farre hence, from which he cannot be released, vntill the Enchantment be ended, which many Knights of strange Countryes haue aduentured, but none could finish: the cause of building thereof, as yet no man can tell. Philotheta hauing before heard thereof, weary with that dayes trauell, whilest they were in communication, fell asleepe, which Montelyon perceiuing, remitted their communication till the Morning, being vnwilling to awake her with theyr noyse. The first that awaked was the Hermit, who went out to gather certaine hearbes, leauing them both sleeping, who both at once awaked, at the first blushing at each others sight, he wondring at her exceeding beauty, and she at his exquisite person, he comparing the Damzels report to her beauty, and her other gifts thereto, which he supposed beyond conceit. And she comparing his valor with his youth, and his courtesie with both, thought her eye neuer beheld his equall: standing as it were both enchanted with the other, neither being able long to withhold their eyes from each others sight, both noting each others behauiour, till Montelyon arose, and she did the like, he first breaking silence, vttering these speeches. Faire Lady, now that the Sun hath vanished the misty Cloudes of night, you need not feare any mishap, for your enemies being dead. I thinke there is none liuing of so inhumane a disposition, that would disquiet you. For my selfe, my life, and all that I haue, resteth at your command. Sir Knight, replyed she, I thanke you for your kindnesse past, and now proffered, which hath rid me from that I was in, and out of feare of other mishap to come, for your Uertues haue authority against wicked actions, and your valour a sufficient defence against your enemies. Before any further speeches past, the Hermit came, bringing in his hand the hearbs he had gathered, some of which he stamped into juyce, and strained, giuing Montelyon to drinke, others he boyled on the fire, making thereof a most dainty dish, which when they had tasted, the Hermite: Though I know you find your selfe of sufficient strength, yet by my counsell trauell not this day, for that therby you may much impaire your health. Myselfe so pleaseth this Lady, will send a Messenger to Ila , to report her safety in this place. Not so replyed Montelyon , my selfe (so please her to accept of my seruice) will attend her thither: which if it please her I will presently doe. Sir said she, I would not haue you endanger your health for my sake that am in safety, vntill such time as you are perfectly recouered. Then sayd the Hermite you shall not in this place want any thing, nor feare disquiet, for here hath security dwelt many dayes, being myselfe glad my poore Cell can yeeld you any content. The Hermit went forth to get Prouision, leauing them together in his Cell, whose eyes were drunke with a surfetting suruay of each others perfections, her beauty being such, as might not be equalled by any: And his proportion besides his youths beauty, and other comelinesse of such forme, as would please any Ladies eye, which superficiall view of the eye, conducted an instance of Loue into each others part, which setled it selfe in that vertuous harbour with such constancy, that it was impossible to be remoued: neither deeming each others so fortunate, to agree in such a sympathy of Loue, he thunking she would not loue, and she perswading her selfe he had already setled his Loue on that Lady he went in search of. He not knowing which way to frame his sute on so small acquaintance, nor she, how to shew him fauour without further tryall. She first breaking silence with a heart-breathing sigh bred from the depth of meditation, whereupon he tooke occasion to say. Lady, that sigh bewrayeth some disquiet of mind that troubleth you, the occasion whereof, my small acquaintance and vnworthinesse to be so bold, withholdeth me from enquiring, but if you would yeeld me such fauour as impart your secrets to me, I would proue so faithfull and diligent to pleasure you, that you should commend my willingnesse though not my ability: For my heart wisheth my tongue to vtter that which my Fancy perswadeth me from: not for that they disagree, but for that my heart harboureth that which my fancy biddeth me not vtter, because it feareth you will not beleeue it, and yet you might belieue it if it were of more antiquity: for it is commonly holden for truth, that all things of Antiquity are permanent, which neuer would haue beene if they had not first begun in youth, youth being the first foundation, the foundation is then constant, then things though young of growth containe circumstancy, which being cherished grow to perfection. So Lady, if I might without your misconceit, discouer the constant zeale of your perfections that is rooted in my heart, and finde some sparke of your gentle fauour to comfort it, it would grow to such setled resolution, that nothing should remoue it, but if in the first Spring it be blasted with Disfauour, it will then spread it selfe into all parts of my Sences, tormenting euery part of me, vntill it be cherished by the dew of your kindnesse. I cannot protest, nor vow, nor sweare, that I haue loued long, yet if your suspect conuert not the truth of my well-meaning Words into distrust, I durst protest, vow, and sweare, that loue to your Perfections is setled in my heart and nothing can remooue it. Syr (replyed she) should I credit your Words, or impart my secrets to you, it might be accounted too much credulity: yet without blame I might, it relying on your Uertues: or should I grant it were as you say, that Loue began in a moment, being the roote, is the substance, and therefore permanent, yet how would you thinke of one, if vpon so small probabilitie, I should thanke you for your good will, and accept thereof, not measuring me by your selfe, if you are constant, but measuring me by inconstancie, would judge me light, as I may well account your words of course, yet as much good Will as may grow in so short an acquaintance I beare you, measuring the same by your owne: for if you finde cause to loue me, I haue more cause to be thankfull vnto you for your kindnes that haue receiued good by you. But neither esteeme me light, for being so familiar, nor easily to be won because I am courteous: for should I be coy, you might account me vnmannerly, and not worthy to be assisted as I haue beene by you. Lady, replyed Montelyon , would I harbour a thought that might impeach the least title of your compleat vertue, I were worthy to be hated: For I know that truth is plaine, and needeth no coloured Phrases nor curiositie: which animateth me to enter into this bold conference with you, not framing my words of course, but of true deuotion, trusting that your vertue will pardon my boldnesse, and your courtesie censure my meaning aright: for I finde in my selfe an vnwonted alteration, which desire to be gracious in your sight, hath bred in me (Nature nor Art framing it) which I neither know how to manifest, nor dare by reason of the small continuance know, though my soule knoweth my hearts purity and consent thereto, fearing to be misconceiued of you: yet if you will vouchsafe to make triall of me, and grant me but to be your seruant, in time to be tryed and censured according to my truth, I shal account my selfe most fortunate, that yet hope may be anchor of my comfort, one day to be gracious in your sight. Sir (replyed she) how could I but blame myselfe, if I should yeeld you any fauour other then for your late paines, which shall bind me to requite it to my power: but loue, being another subject, how should I giue you any credit being a stranger, altogether vnknowne to me? Lady, said he, you may doe it, if your gentle heart will yeild thereto, though I am a stranger both to you, and to myselfe, vnknowne: for that I am you can witnesse, but who are my Parents the Heauens haue yet concealed. My name if euer you heard thereof, is Montelyon : My cause of comming into this Countrey, was with Persicles King of Assyria , in search of Constantia , daughter to the King of Persia , his betrothed wife, by misfortune lost many yeares since: all that I know of my selfe I haue told you, & I would I had neuer knowne my selfe, vnlesse you fauour me. Philotheta remembred that Amphiador in reciting the Warres twixt Persicles , and the King of Armenia , had made ample report of his valour, so much the more with that report louing him, yet she concealed the same from him, thinking though he were neuer so valiant, yet he might be vnconstant: making vnto him this answere. Sir, because you shall not altogether accuse me of discourtesie, I will not quite deny your sute, nor in any respect grant it, vntill more conuenient time to make tryall thereof, neyther shall you name your selfe my Seruant, for that you haue deserued to be better rewarded, which hereafter you shall find: Lady, quoth he, one fauour absolutely granted, would now more comfort my heart, then many in suspence, nor that I misdoubt your performance, but that long lingring paine in the meane time will pinch my heart: Therefore without misdoubt of truth, gratitude and constancy, inrich me but with one, though the least comfortable answere. Sir Knight, replyed she, what in vertue I can grant, I will yeeld you, though you may account me already prodigall in Fauour, and gentle in reply: yet should I be ingratefull, you might blame me, or too profite you might condemne me: but as much good will as in so short continuance may be, I beare you, and you shall finde me performe, for my heart would neuer suffer me till this, to conceiue so well of any as I doe of you: in vrging me further you shall make me suspect you: consideration of my late Misfortune, rather willing me to regard my returne to my Parents: but you may see your vertues haue ouermastered my mistrust, and a good opinion of you, hath made me trust my selfe in your Custody. How Amphiador arrived neere the Cell, and of the doubt that Phylotheta was driven into: And of the displeasure that arose betweene Montelyon and Amphiador: and Phylothetaes strange departure. As soone as she had ended these words, the Hermit came in, which broke off their communication, and telling them how that Amphiador with a many followers were come into the Wood, where the Giants lay dead. Philotheta then thought all care past, but suddenly remembring she must part from Montelyon , her heart fainted with griefe, and her sences were exceedingly troubled, for she knew well Amphiador was so rude and suspicious, that he would neither thanke him for his paines, nor inuite him to his Castle, for he had with like jealous conceits disgraced others that had sought her loue. Montelyon on the other side, studyed what meanes to vse, still to enjoy her company, and yet he thought it would turne to his dishonour to follow loue, and leaue Persicles search for Constantia , and the knowledge of his Parents. But to rid them both out of their troubled thoughts, there entred three Knights in greene Armour, and without speaking a word, two of them tooke Philotheta betwixt them, and led her out of the Cell. Montelyon started vp and vnto his sword, and following to rescue her, but the third of them without speaking strooke at him, wherewith began a cruell combat. At last the greene Knight sayd: Thou striuest in vaine, she is past recouery. With that Montelyon looking about, saw them quite out of his sight, maruelling they could so suddenly conuey her thence: If thou wilt finde her (quoth he) thou shalt find her amongst the Hesperian Nymphes: which sayd, he went away so fast, that Montelyon thought it vaine to follow him. By this time Amphiador and his company were come to him: amongst whom he espyed one leading his steed, vnto whom he went and said: Sir, this is my Steed, I pray thee deliuer him me: the Fellow denying him, he strooke him a second blow with his fist and ouerthrew him. Amphiador seeing that, sayd: What art thou that so boldly strikest my Seruant? Montelyon being vexed with the losse of Philotheta answered, I will not now tell thee. Amphiador being likewise vexed with his scornefulnesse, without more words drew his Sword, and strooke at him: Montelyon thought to reuenge it, but suddainly remembring himselfe, he sayd: Wert thou not Father to Philotheta , I would make thee repent thy selfe: Amphiador hearing him name Philotheta , would haue spoke to him againe, but Montelyon mounting his Steed rode away. The Hermit seeing them at such variance, came to Amphiador , giuing him knowledge of all that had hapned: But he rather beleeuing it was but some meere coloured excuse for her escape, caused his Seruants to bind the Hermit, intending by tortures to make him confesse more then he could. Montelyon remembring himselfe when he had rode a good way, how ingratefully he had left the Hermit, turned backe, which he had no sooner done, but he espyed him bound amongst Amphiadors men, which vexed him so much that he drew his sword again, and set vpon them, wounding some of them, and slaying others, that therewith Amphiador with his sword drawn strooke him againe. By heauen, qd, Montelyon , strike me the third time and thou diest. Notwithstanding his words. Amphiador vexed for the death of his Seruants, strooke him againe, wherewith Montelyon not onely defended himselfe, but offended him so much that he had sore wounded him, and had not his Seruants with some of their liues borne off some blowes, he had ended his life: but notwithstanding, he left him in a miserable case, that his Seruants had much adoe to keepe life in him, vntill the brought him home. How Montelyon in his travell arrived at the Flower of the Hesperian Nymphs. How every one of them gave him a severall gift and how they named him Knight of the Oracle . kindnesse, departed with so heauy a heart, that he could scarce speake for griefe, trauelling he knew not whether, hauing so many occasions of care, that he knew not what to doe, nor which way to direct his steps. All the rest of that day he rode forth-right in this discomfortable sort, vntill it grew to bee Night, neyther caring for Meat nor Lodging, but turning his Horse loose to feed, he layd himselfe downe vnder an Oake, whose spreading branches were as a large Canopy ouer his head, clogged with so many diuersities of cares that his heart was dulled with their confusion, and his Sences so ouergrowne with conceit, that they brought him into a dead sleepe. In middest whereof, he suddenly awoke, being called by a Uirgin that appeared vnto him, who standing before him sayd, Knight, arise, and follow me. Montelyon maruelling what she should be, arose and followed her, she leading the way he thought, through many by-pathes, and crosse-wayes, hils, dales and Woods, vntill such time as the sunne arose, she vanished out of his sight, and left him in the middest of a pleasant greene Meadow, beautified with all sorts of fresh blowne flowers, whose beauty delighted the eye, and sweet smell affected the Sences, looking round about him, he saw the same encompassed with Springs, or Groues young Trees, and in the middest thereof, an Arbour framed of fresh blooming Roses, made with such Art, as he admired the same: comming neere thereto, he espyed the floore strowed with greene rushes, and vpon them, all sorts of flowers nipt from the stalkes: he stood a while with admiration beholding the same, and casting his eye aside, he espyed a Table with these Uerses written thereon. What ere thou be that shalt behold this Writ, Abstaine from entring to this sacred place, A company of comely Nymphes heere sit, That rule the Hesperian Oracle of Grace: Be not too bold, lest thou repent too late, Thy rash attempt, and hard divining Fate. Which when he had read, he stood in a deepe study, arguing their ambiguity, when suddenly he heard the sound of most sweet Musicke drawing neare him, turning his eyes that way, he espyed a troupe of Damzels, attyred in most rich Ornaments, with Garlands of Roses, mixt with diuers coloured flowers vpon their heads, some of them playing vpon Instruments, others bearing in theyr hands a Bowe, and at their backe, a sheath of Arrowes. Amongst them there was three taller, more beautifull, and richly adorned then the rest, wearing Crownes of Palme: amongst them he espyed the Damzell that brought him thither, which made him with more boldnesse stay their comming, they passed by him continuing their Melody, vntill they came within their Pauilion, then two of them came forth, saluting him with most courteous and gentle behauiour, leading him to the Pauilion, vntill he came neare to the place where they were all seated, and the three principallest in the midst, Montelyon disarming his head, kneeling vpon his Knee, did them reuerence, when presently he heard a voice vttering of these words. Most noble Knight, the Nymphes of the Hesperian Oracle , pittying thy cares and troubles, haue brought thee hither to comfor thee with our assistance: vnto which place neuer any man was yet admitted: therefore reueale not to any what thou hast seene: with thy Sword maintaine their honour, and name thy selfe, Knight of the Oracle . Thy parentage is Noble, thy father not knowing he hath a Sonne, and your mother not thinking to see either. Father or Sonne, yet all of you shall most happily meete: thy Fortune shall be good, thy misfortune great, that which thou louest best, shall trouble thee most: What thou thinkest thy selfe nearest, thou shalt be farthest off: thy professed Friends, thy greatest foes. Thou wert begotten in Persia , borne in Arabia , and brought vp in Assiria . Be constant in Loue, true to thy Friends, patient in misery, and lowly in prosperity. Farewell, and be both happy and vnfortunate. The Uoyce ceasing, the Nymphes came round about him, one vngyrding his Sword, another vnlacing his Helme, and a third vnbuckling his Armour: Others taking of his Gantlets, and euery one busied to disarme him. Which done, one of the chiefest of them presented him with a most rich & curious ingrauen Armour, wrought of the best and purest Lydian -steele, enamelled all ouer with greene, richly beset with Dyamonds, Saphyrs, Iaspires, and Rubyes, the like whereof, for Strength and Richnesse, neuer Knight possest: Which when they had Armed him withall, the second gaue him a Shield, agreeable thereto in Richnesse, with this deuise thereon: A Knight kneeling incompassed with Nymphs, Crowning him with a wreath of Roses. And vnderneath, these Words written in Gold: The Knight of the Oracle ; The third presented him with a most rich Sword, which she gyrded to his side, Another, a paire of Gantlets: another a Plume: another a Speare: another a paire of Spurres, and euery one something to expresse their kindnesse. When he was adorned with this rich furniture, which made him most beautifull to beholde, euery one of them gaue him a courteous Farewell, and departed againe the same way they came from the Groue, with theyr Musicke: the Damzell that brought him thither, came to him, vttering these words: Knight, the Ladyes of this Oracle , pittying the hard Aduentures you are to vndertake, haue bestowed these Armes vpon you, which shall oftentimes preserue your life: and haue honoured you so much, as to choose you for their Knight. They haue likewise appoynted me to bring you backe to the place where I found you: Therfore let vs depart, my selfe will giue you a Steed, whose equall for goodnesse cannot be had. Which when she had said, she led the way, and hee followed on, vntill they came to a Castle, vnto which the Damzell entred, willing him to stay till shee returned, leading in her hand a Steed, blacke of colour, but of such goodly proportion, that his eyes had neuer beheld the like before: when he was mounted, the Damzell sayd unto him, Knight of the Oracle , farewell, prosper, and be fortunate, which she had no sooner spoken, but straight shee vanished from his sight before he could haue respite to yeeld her thanks for her courtesie. Being parted from her, he entred into these meditations, which shortned the way as he rode. How farre am I blest beyond my desert, hauing receyued such fauour and gifts of Nymphes, as yet neuer any man did, insomuch that they haue elected me to the high honour of being their Knight: and yet for all this, I feele my heart so much troubled, that nothing can rid me from disquiet, onely for the absence and losse of Philotheta , whom I had thought to haue found amongst those sacred Nymphes but was frustrated, which assureth me, my trauels in seeking her will be tedious, yet I shall endure them, although they last to the end of my life. I haue lost the noble King Persicles , who by this time accuseth me of discourtesie for not finding him out: but how can I doe that when I haue lost my selfe and Philotheta : and in her my essence, being, and substance: which of these is dearest vnto me, I know not: myselfe I loue by nature, him for his honour, and her by affection. Which then should I first goe in search of, since they are both so deare vnto me, as I thinke my selfe depriued of comfort, missing either of them: my estate is also so vncertaine, and the place where to finde them so doubtfull, that I cannot assure my selfe of confidence in either, but must take my fortune as it falleth, and arme my selfe with patience to endure the most hardest tryall of extreams: the intricacie of his hopelesse meditations, would haue lengthened his speech, but casting off effeminate lamentation, he quickned his sences with reuiued comfort, though his trauels would be long, yet his reward (if he might finde his loue) would a thousand times counteruaile them. Then hee beganne to study which way to trauell, being as ignorant of the place that Philotheta was, as he was vnacquainted in those walkes: riding along in those and suchlike solitarie dumpes, he at length lighted in a plaine faire beaten path, in the furrowes of whose dust, he might perceiue the footing of Horses that had newly gone that way, which put him in some comfort that it would not be long before he should finde some company: He had not rode about an houre, but the way into which he had entred, ascended a high mountaine, whose lofty top discouered to his sight the faire turrets of the Enchanted Tower, which glistered as if they had beene framed of massie gold, which draue him into an admiration: but viewing well the scittuation thereof, he discerned the valleyes round about ouerspred with tents, as if the same had beene encompassed with a Host of enemies. Thither he intended to trauell, forsaking the gallant prospect, to be acquainted with the cause of that assembly, making the more haste, for that it grew towards night: but ere hee could attaine thither, it grewe to bee darke: therefore for that night, hee tooke vp his lodging vnder the couert of a tuske of trees, pleasantly seated in the middest of a greene Meadow. Of the conference betweene Constantia and Philotheta in Penthrasus Castle. The historie hath long discontinued to speake of the Lady Constantia that remained enchanted, and of Helyon , that likewise lay theyr inthralled in great misery, rightly rewarded for his treacherous dealing. Her eyes shedding continuall teares for the abscence of Persicles , on whom she continually meditated, resoluing that nothing but death should abolish his remembrance, that had not Ila comforted her with promises of her release, the extremity of her sorrow had soone ended her life: withall thinking that Persicles and her young sonne might both be in safety, and yet shee by no meanes could heare thereof: which also added some comfort to her heauie heart. Oftentimes she would intreat her to behold the valiant aduentures of noble Knights, that hazarded their owne Persons in the aduenture for to attayne her loue, and in priuate tryalls amongst themselues, with whom they were deeply in loue. onely with the sight of her Picture, but she still refused it, accounting it no pleasure to her to see their misfortune, that spent their labour in vain, for in the continuance of so many yeares as she had beene there inclosed, the fame of her beauty was spred into most parts of those countryes and many thousand Knights had beene there to trie theyr Fortunes, but all failed: the recitall whereof would be ouer tedious, but many of them lay theyr imprisoned by the Enchantresse, who now being in dispaire of her owne safety, sought to bring all to misery, as well as her selfe: At such time as Philotheta was carried from Montelyon in the Hermits Cell, Constantia remained in such extremity of sorrow, that had not Ila wrought that deuice to bring Philotheta thither to accompany her, it had beene impossible her sences could haue ouergrowne the extremity of the passion tormeted her: but sitting alone in a darke corner, best fitting her sad disposition, she vttered such lamentations as would haue turned the flintiest heart of a most cruell Tyrant to remorse: but suddenly espying Ila entred, and with her so beautifull a Damzell, with cheekes bedewed with christall teares that in aboundance trickled down her face: with that obiect she left her owne laments to pitty hers,  & seeing them draw nigh to her, she arose after a sad sort saluting their sad aproach. Ila without speaking a word, left them together. Though they were both women, yet both admiring each others beauty, eyther thinking the other to excell all, and yet had they beheld their own perfections, they might inwardly haue conceyued as well of themselues, as they did of the outward obiect. Constantia being more familiar with sorrow then Philotheta was, first brake silence, saying Lady, I perceyue by your teares that constraint, not your consent, hath brought you to this place, beautifull to the eye, but filld with discontents, which long experience hath taught me: therefore if you want a companion in care. accept of my company: but if you seeke for comfort abandon me, for my chiefest solace is sorrow and my very thoughts & meditations of nothing but discontent I haue not (said Philotheta ) beene long subiect to this misfortune: but being now plunged therein, I know not how to release my selfe or how to shun the same: neyther knowing who is cause thereof, where I am, or when I shall be released, that my sorrowes are such as may well entertaine a sorrowfull companion, accepting your proffered kindnesse, with hearty thanks. Lady (said Constantia ) as you vouchsafe me your company, so let me know what misfortune hath brought you hither, which will shorten some of the tedious time that we are like to ouerpasse to this place: which done, you shall know to whom you haue imparted your minde, the recitall whereof will be tedious. Philotheta sitting downe by her, vttered these speeches. My name is Philotheta , daughter in law to Amphiador : Upon a day as I was walking in my Fathers garden, vpon what pretence I know not, three Gyants surprized me, and by force carried me thence, none to my knowledge seeing theyr cruelty: when they had trauelled with me vntill it waxed late, a knight armed all in white, gallantly mounted, came to my rescue, & entred combate with the Giants, his valiant heart not refusing to cope with all three of them. But one of them thinking himselfe too strong for him, stayed to combate him, the other two with haste carrying me away, but in short space one of them ran backe to rescue his fellow whom the knight had slayne, himselfe likewise returning with losse of one of his armes, haling me forwards with violent force, vntill they came into the midst of a wood, where they meant to stay that night. This Knight directed by good fortune, alighted on the place where they lay, and by his valour and policie slue them both, yet so sore hurt himselfe, that he lay breathlesse vpon the earth, which affected my heart with sorrow, fearing his death, that I could not comfort him in ought by my teares and laments, accounting it more misfortune for me to be the cause of so worthy a Knights death, then if I my selfe had been still prisoner to those monsters: the heauens fauouring my sorrowes & his mishaps, directed an old Hermit to the place, who with the iuyce of certaine hearbs recouered him, & with my weake assistance brought him to his Cell, within short space curing him. In which time, I noted euery part of his perfections, and found them such as I want skill to decipher comparing thereto his behauiour, which bred a perswasion in mee, that as he was valiant, so he was vertuous and as he excelled all that euer I beheld in person, so he did in courtesie. Much conference past betwixt vs, which I omit: The subiect whereof was Loue, which he auerred to be as constant in him, though new begun, as it was in any by long continuance. Amongst the rest of his speeches, he told me, that he knew not his Parents, his name wsa Montelyon : the cause of his trauell was in search of a Lady named Constantia , betrothed Wife to Persicles King of Assiria , who parted from him that day he rescued me in Arabia. Constantia hearing such good newes of the safety of Persicles , could not withhold her selfe from bewraying what shee was: but taking Philotheta by the hand said, deare Lady, this newes addeth much comfort to my dispayring heart, I am that vnfortunate Constantia , that till this time haue dispayred of euer seeing that noble King againe, accounting my selfe so much bound to you, for being the happy reporter of this welcome newes, that I protest my selfe your euerlasting Friend, assuring you, that if that worthy Knight that rescued you be companion to Persicles hee is indued with all heroicke vertues: but I pray you tell me out the rest. The worthy Knights speeches (said shee) wrought so effectually with me, that I could haue beene contented to haue liued there with him for euer. In the end the Hermit brought in newes that Amphiador was hard by in my search, at which newes I was very glad, yet also displeased, with knowing his rude behauiour would not suffer him to vse the strange knight kindly. Whilst I was in this thought, three knights in greene armour entred the Cell, two of them without speaking a word, by force carrying me foorth, whilest the third stayed the Knight in combate, who hastily followed to my rescue: but of a sudden, before I could bethinke me what they should be, I was within this garden, where I met her that brought me vnto you, who willed mee to feare nothing, for here I should remaine in safety. With that such a floud of teares gushed from her eyes, that they stopt the passage of her speach, turning the same into silence. Lady (said Constantia ) to adde more care to my heart, would ouerwhelm it with griefe, therfore I will omit the relation of my tragicke Historie till another time, neither fearing nor feeling care, now I heare of my Lords safety, who will set me at liberty from the thraldome I haue here endured almost these twenty yeares. Ila comming to them brake of their conference, After supper conuaying them to a Chamber, where they both lay, continuing some dayes in much conference of theyr estate, which for breuity sake is omitted. How Montelyon Knight of the Oracle arriued at the enchanted Tower, called Penthrasus Pallace . And of the controuersie that fell betweene him and the Knights that were come to try the aduenture. The Knight of the Oracle , as it is before said, hauing lodged all night in the wood, early the next morning before golden Phebus had beautified the earth with his brightnesse, mounted his steed with an earnest desire to know whose tents those were, and what Tower it was they had encompassed, hee had not rode halfe an houre, but he approached neere vnto them, passing amongst them without stay, because he met none to conferre withall, he drew towards the entrance of the bridge, where Constantiaes Picture hung, which when he had well viewed, he iudged by the outward shew thereof, what perfections were adherent to the Lady, that was owner thereof, thereby calling to remembrance his Philothetas perfections, which in his conceit farre surpassed that, but yet the Spell that Ila had cast thereon, wrought so with him, that had not the vertue of his Armour and other giftes the Nymphes had bestowed on him, which had power against all Enchantments preuayled, hee had surely doted thereon: when he had read the verses, an earnest desire possest his heart to redeeme that Lady, that neither regarding danger nor omitting opporunity, he tooke the horne and winded the same, the sound thereof made many Knights start from foorth their Tents, being but euen then vp, and newly armed: the first, that was mounted, and came to the Bridge: was a noble Knight of Parthia, named Menon , who calling to the Knight of the Oracle , sayd, Knight enter no farther before thou know whom thou hast offended by thy bold intrusion. He hearing his words turned hie steed saying, if I haue offended any it is more then I know, but yet I am resolued to try the aduenture who so euer sayes no. Menon sayd thy strangenesse doth priuiledge thee, because thou knowest not what is concluded amongst the Knights that are here assembled. Sir said he, whatsoeuer agreeth with the Law of armes I yeeld vnto, and whatsoeuer courtesie bindeth me to, I will performe: therfore let me know what it is I must performe before I passe further? By this time he was incompassed with Armed Knights: and one of them named Linseus , of Arabia , that thought himselfe too good for all, and vanquished many that had Combated with him, said. Before thou passe further, thou must combat vs: For the meanest of many that are here assembled, thinketh himselfe able to performe as much as thee. The Knight of the Oracle wondring at theyr rudenesse, and moued with his discourteous words, said: I am not to be controlled by any, but stand free in mine owne choyse, to doe what I thinke good: therefore if thou or any here be offended with that I haue said or done, Challenge me. And I doe challenge thee said Linseus , and I, said Menon : and after them many other, euery one desirous to deale with him first. The Prince of Parthia , (named Nessus ) stept foorth and said. Fellow Knights, wee being all professors of Armes, and euery one a Partner in this Quarrell, let vs cast Lots, and to his share that the Lot, first falleth, let him beginne, and the rest follow: With that they all agreed. The Knight of the Oracle thought hee should not be Idle, reioycing that he had so good occasion to make tryall of his Ualour. The lot fell to Arnon of Persia to beginne. The place, a goodly Plaine, in the full view of the Tower: and the time, was within an houre. This being agreed vpon, the Knight of the Oracle in the meane time rode about the Tower, to behold the beauty and Scituation thereof, which hee admired, and casting his Eye vp, he beheld on the Battlement a farre off, three Ladyes walking together, whom he could scarcely discerne: much lesse if he had beene acquainted with them, know. These Ladies were Constantia, Philotheta , and Ila , that came to beholde the Tylts  & turneys that were daily acted betweene many and diuers Knights before the Tower. Constantia , hearing of Persicles safetie, and of his being in that Countrey, hoping thereby in time to be released, desired to beholde the Combatants, which before she had alwayes refused to doe. The Knight of the Oracle little thinking Philotheta had beene one of the three, after he had a while stood to beholde them, returned to the appoynted place of Combate, where Arnon was then but newly entred with great pride, and the sound of Trumpets, and a number of followers. Whom the Knight of the Oracle , (notwithstanding all his brauerie,) ouerthrew at the first Encounter, to Arnons amazement, and his owne glory. That done, the next that encountred him, was Linseus , who held out two courses, but at the third, both he and his Steed lay on the earth. The Knights that beheld this, commended his Ualour, yet enuyed his Fortune. After that he encountred three Knights of Ægypt . Then came Nessus Prince of Parthia , thinking to recouer that his Precedents had lost, but his Fortune prooued so bad that he lost both his styrrops, and had he not hung on the Saddle-bowe, he had layne on the ground. The Day by this time drew to an end, which caused them to remit their further tryall till the next Morning. Constantia and Philotheta , beholding the valour of this one Knight, according to her desire, deemed it was Persicles , the other Montelyon : desiring Ila , to send a Messenger to know his Name: Who returning, told them he was called the Knight of the Oracle . Then it is not Persicles (sayd Constantia .) No, nor Montelyon , sayd Phylotheta . Their hearts now fainting with care, that before were reuiued with Hope. The Knight of the Oracle that Night lodged with a Knight of Persia , named Thymus , in his Tent, who in courteous sort intreated him thereto. Earely the next Morning, he againe entred the Field, ready for him that should next Encounter him, who came gallantly mounted, hauing likewise trauelled many Miles to trye his Fortune in the Aduenture: but before he came to try himselfe therein, he receiued so great a Discharge, by Encountring the Knight of the Oracle , that in a desperate moode, and ashamed of his foyle, he departed. The Knight of the Oracle being endued with an extraordinary Wit, as receiuing the Essence thereof from two such goodly Princes as he was sprung of, began in his thoughts to condemne the fondnesse of those Knights, that comming to make tryall of the Aduenture, spent their time in priuate Quarrels, still omitting that which principally they had sought, his Minde being so troubled with the losse of Phylotheta and Persicles , desired not to linger there, but to hasten in their search. Therefore parting towards the Knights, who were assembled on a heape studying which way to worke his disgrace, he sayd to them. Worthy Knights, my comming to this place, was not to try my Fortune against you, but in the Aduenture, and your priuate Enuy hath hitherto hindred me, not regarding into what priuate Quarrels you enter, and causelesly troubling me, that haue not offended you: Therefore because businesse of more importance then to answer your Spleene, vrgeth my departure, I wish you, not fearing my ability to answer you, to remit this priuate Contention vntill another time: and if any of you eyther enuiously condemne me, or repine at my good Fortune, I will be ready to answer your seuerall Quarrels in Persia , at the time that is appointed for the meeting of the Kings of Assyria , and Armenia : for the cause of your approach, being to release this Ladyes imprisonment, weaken not your force in priuate contention: for in the Tryall thereof, you shall finde occasion enough to exercise your Armes. Hearing his words they consented thereunto, yet contending who should first try the Aduenture. In the end they agreed to cast Lots: in which the last fell to the Knight of the Oracle : euery one hauing a Dayes respit for the finishing thereof. Thus did they make tryall of themselues: Some with such labour attaining the Bridge, but then forced by vertue of the Enchantment to yeeld, and so were imprisoned in most Lamentable wise, by the Enuy of Ila , who desired the Enchantment might neuer end, but that she might liue there for euer. Others with feare ran away. Many dayes it was before it came to the Knight of the Oracles turne: In the end, all being eyther fled or imprisoned, he alone was left to try his Fortune, neyther hauing Friend to succour him, Foe to Enuy him, nor any to behold him: for the Enchantresse had made such desolation among the Tents, by casting fires amongst them, that all the Seruants to those Knights, fled as amazed, reporting from place to place their Masters misery, and the cause of their owne terror. Notwithstanding, nothing could affright or discourage the valiant heart of the Knight of the Oracle , but he rested as resolute to goe forwards, as if there had bin no danger incident to the attempt. Constantia seeing how many Knights were at that instant imprisoned, all their Tents destroyed, and no man as she thought left, began to discomfort her selfe, vtterly despayring of releasment, desiring Ila to let her view the Knights that were imprisoned, fearing that Persicles was amongst them: but her requests were in vaine, for Ila fretted with extreame feare of the end of her Enchantment, in a mad rage flung from them, studying which way to lengthen the date thereof, which tormented poore Constantiaes heart, that had been so long in misery, and terrified kind Philothetaes minde with extreame feare of further calamity. Both she and Constantia all that Night bewailing their misery. How the Knight of the Oracle finished tht Enchantment. And how Ila departed with Philotheta . Early the in Morning, the Knight of the Oracle , suruaying the setuation of the Bridge, which way he might eyther aduantage himselfe, or disaduantage his Foe, winded his Horne, wherewith there was such an exceeding Earthquake within the tower, that the foundation thereof shooke as if it would haue ouerturned her stately Turrets. At which first sound of the horne, one of the Gyants came foorth without speaking, striking at him, but he defended himselfe a great while on Horsebacke, vntill the Gyant pressed so hard vpon him, that he was driuen to withdraw him to light. Which when he had done, he againe assayled him, giuing him many a deepe wound, and receiuing many a sore bruise, that had not his good Armor preserued him, it had brought him in great danger: but in the end he preuayled so much by the death of the first Gyant, that he attayned the first and second Fortification of the Bridge. And at the third he was so violently set vpon by the other Giant, that he was only compelled to ward his blowes, in the end likewise espying such aduantage that he ran his Sword quite through his body. By which means, he entred the first large Court, where he beheld the Armors of such Knights as had fayled in their sundry attempts, hanging about the Wals, hearing their hollow voyces, which by imprisonment had endured much affliction. Ila now knowing that the date of her glory in that place should end, in furious sort came running to the place where Constantia and Philotheta were, taking Philotheta with violence from out the Arbour, and by force of her Enchantment, compelling her to follow her, vntill she came to the Court where the Knight of the Oracle was, he suddenly beholding Phylotheta , at the first sight knew her: and seeing them so passe by him, towards the Entrance, he stept after them to speake to her, when presently there rusht vpon him a number of armed men that layd vpon him with such swiftnesse, that they had no power to styrre from the place where he stood. They suddenly vanished, and he stood so amazed with the sight, and perplexed with such doubt, that he could not tell what to doe: Sometimes thinking to follow Philotheta : then perswading himselfe it was but an illusion: and thinking to cast off that doubt, and go forwards, his minde was possest with such desire to see her againe, that he stood as a man without sence. When suddenly such a Myst darkened all the place, that he could scarcely see his hands, which continued by the space of halfe an houre. Whilest he remained in such thoughts, sometimes of perswasion it was Philotheta , which troubled his very heart to thinke what should be become of her, that he seemed to haue lost his sences by the sight of her: remaining in many meditations, the Myst vanished, and the Sun with exceeding splendor, disclosed the beauty of Penthrasus Pallace. When he saw no further expectation of danger approaching, he entred further, towards the three Gates of Brasse, beholding the curious works thereof, through which he entred into the Court, which drew his minde into much admiration thereof. Entring the Hall, he beheld the two Lyons (which kept the Passage) that with a faire prospect discouered the beauty of the Garden. The Lyons no sooner espyed him, but they presently made such a noyse with their Roring, that all the Pallace rung thereof. And Constantia hearing the same, cryed out, as exceedingly affrighted. The Knight of the Oracle attempted to passe by them, expecting no other but cruell resistance: yet contrary to his thoughts, they laid themselues downe at his feet (as it were) reuerencing him: Which when he beheld, of his owne inclination, he loosed both their Chaines, and they ran forth of the Pallace with exceeding swiftnesse, which amazed him to behold. Passing through the Hall, he entred the Garden, looking round about, to behold the beauty thereof, when suddenly he began to wonder, that he had beheld neuer a liuing creature since he entred, which draue him into an exceeding Admiration, maruelling that he could not behold the Lady of whose Picture he had beheld at the entrance, so that finding himselfe ouer-wearyed with labour, purposing to rest his Bodie, he returned into the Hall, and there seated himselfe in a most rich and costly Chayre. Constantia being in the Arbour, beheld when he entred the Garden, and when he went backe, maruelling what he should be, and little thinking the Enchantment was ended, not daring her selfe to goe forth of the Arbour, her heart was so possest with amazement, desired one of the Damzels, if she loued her, to goe see what he was and learne the cause of that vprore, which they had heard in the Pallace. One of the Damzels being more hardy then the other, told her, how for the Loue she bare her, she would aduenture, though it cost her her life. Passing on towards the Pallace, with such hasty steps, as if something had pursued her, and yet going forwards. As if an euill had beene before her, that she could neyther tell whether, wherefore, nor why she went: vntill of a sudden she mounted the passage into the Hall, and was right before the Knight of the Oracle : Whom when she saw, she stood looking vpon him, trembling as if she had bin distraught. The Knight of the Oracle , rising from his seate, sayd: Damzell, feare not, I will defend you from danger, here is none intendeth you harme. The Damzell hearing his voyce, was reuiued, saying: Sir Knight, I maruell what strange accident hath brought you hither, where no Knight hath bin these many yeares? Lady (sayd he) Fortune and my good Destinies, that haue bin imployed to set you at Liberty. Syr (sayd she) it is not I, but my Mistris you meane, by whose command I haue aduentured to see what was happened: to whom if you will vouchsafe to goe, I will conduct you. He could remember, it was not her Picture he had beheld, therefore he blusht to be so deceiued, but told her, his comming was to doe her Lady seruice. With that they entred the Garden. Constantia soone espying them, and seeing the Knight come in such peaceable sort with the Damzell, went forth to meet him, he likewise seeing her sheathed his sword, his heart trembling at the first sight of her, by a naturall inclination, bearing such a Reuerend regard to her maiesticall person, that when he came nigh her, he did her reuerence vpon his knee, vttering these words. Most Noble Lady, be not disquieted with feare of restrained liberty, for the date of the Enchantment of this Castle is finished. Constantia stepping to him, tooke him by the hand, desiring him not to kneele to her, who was vnworthy, but rather had cause to vse him with the like reuerence. Most Noble Lady (sayd he) I haue all the Reward I expect: yet grant me one fauor (which is) to tell me your Name. Constantiaes hart at that word leapt within her, which caused an exceeding blush to possesse her cheekes, saying: Most Honourable Knight, I were too blame to deny you so small a Request, my Name is Constantia . Then haue the Heauens (quoth he) made me fortunate with beholding you, whom my heart hath euer honoured. Constantia wondred what he should be, assuring her selfe it was not Persicles , for he would not haue asked her name, yet she thought that sorrow might so much haue altered her in the long time of her separation, that on the sudden he could not know her, that her heart was much troubled with those thoughts, till he interrupted them with these speeches. Lady, it may be you suppose me for other then I am, to rid you of which ambiguity, my name is now Knight of the Oracle , which I haue but lately beene knowne by, for before I was called Montelyon , brought vp in Persia , but whether I was borne there, or who my Parents were, as yet I know not: the cause of my trauell into this Countrey, was in your search, in the company of my Noble Lord Persicles : who for your absence liueth in continuall griefe: Therefore I beseech you reuiue your heart from care, and put your confidence in my fidelity: for I will neuer part from you, vntill I haue brought you to his presence. Constantiaes heart with these words was possest with such joy, as is not to be exprest. And remembring what Philotheta had told her of Montelyon , she sayd: Most honoured Knight, I haue long before this heard of your honourable friendship shown to my deare Lord Persicles , which maketh me without doubt resolue my whole confidence in you, which came to my hearing by the report of a Lady whom you lately succoured in this Country, named Philotheta . With that he fetch a deepe sigh from the bottome of his heart, saying: Indeed I did once enjoy her presence, but whether I shall euer see her againe, or where she is, I know not: Yet if I were not deluded, I did behold her departing out of this Castle. It may be so, sayd Constantia , for she was with me this day, and hath beene here this many dayes, but the Enchantresse in great haste, and by violence tooke her from my company, carrying her I know not whether, by whose kind report of your vertues, I conceiue such comfort in their assurance, that I entreat your promise of assistance,  & with that shall my heart rest as voyd of feare, as if I were in the Court of the King my Father in Persia . My heart, said she, rejoyceth to heare your kind speeches, vowing to imploy my life, and all my being to be at your command. Then they departed into the Pallace, with purpose not to tarry there, but instantly to leaue the same: but comming into the other Court, he remembred, that he had heard the voyces of men that lay in misery his heart willing to succour them: destiring her not to be offended, if he had made some stay to release them out of Bondage, which he might soone doe, when there was none to resist them. She willingly consented, and he in little search found the Keyes that opened the Entrance into the Prison, leauing Constantia in place of security, for that he would not trouble hir sences with the smell of the Prison: being entred he found a great number there inclosed many of them in such poore and distressed estate, that his heart lamented to behold, so fast as he could pulling off their fetters: at last he beheld Helyon , though to him vnknowne, whose flesh seemed to be incorporate with the Earth whereon he lay, from whence he could not rise, vntill he was halpen: who now knew the Enchantment to be finished: repenting himselfe of the folly he had committed: when, he had set them at liberty, and they were come out into the cleare light, they with one assent yeelded him thanks, vowing themselues his perpetuall bounden friends. Constantia likewise seeing them wept with griefe, that so many should be endangered to set her at liberty. They all proffered their seruice vnto her, but shee desiring not to be knowne of any, in courteous sort refused the same, reposing her whole confidence in the Knight of the Oracle , who presently according to her desire, left the Pallace, and without the Bridge found his owne Steed grasing, in company of others that had lost their Riders: amongst them he tooke three, on which he mounted Constantia and her two Damzels, hasting to trauell so farre, as the dayes length would permit from the Pallace, Lodging that Night in a Uillage some sixe Miles distant from the same. The Knights that were released, seeing them departed, likewise betooke themselues to trauell, except Helyon , who was so feeble, that he could not trauell. How the Knight of the Oracle departed with Constantia . How they arrived at Delatus Castle: and how she knew him to bee her Sonne. Knight, that the remained in great quiet, but noting his countenance, she perceiued the same to be darkened with some misty Clouds of discontent, which she supposed to be for the losse of Phylotheta , but yet she concealed her opinion from him: wherein she jumpt right on his infirmity, for his heart was pincht with such care for her losse and safety, that it could endure no quiet. But in the Morning when they should depart, they began to consider which way they should trauell, or whether they should stay to heare of Persicles there, or goe directly into Assyria . Amongst many doubts, they agreed to trauell directly into Assyria , where he told Constantia they should assuredly finde him, for that the time of the appointed meeting of him and the King of Armenia drew nigh: after many dayes trauell they came to the place where he remembred he first saw Philotheta , and parted from Persicles , which he reuealed not to Constantia , as vnwilling to make her priuy to his loue: yet he purposed in his iourney to visite Amphiador , hoping to finde her there, and comming to the Castle, he was welcommed thither by Delatus , that was againe restored to his Dukedome. Sir, sayd the Knight of the Oracle , I had thought this had beene Amphiadors Castle. Amphiador did possesse it, but indeed the right was mine, and though I haue no acquaintance with you, yet I beseech you accept such entertainment as it yeeldeth, and if not longer yet for this night, that I may know whom I haue lodged, and you haue some knowledge of my affection vnto. They both noting with what hearty affection he spake, being weary with trauell, alighted to rest themselues, being kindly welcommed by him and Alsala . After Supper, Delatus began these speeches. Worthy Knight, should I rehearse the whole circumstance of my misfortune, and Amphiadors wickednesse, I should both trouble you with the tediousnesse, and renue my owne sorrowes: onely this, he wrought meanes to depriue me of this Dukedome, and caused Penthrasus to enchant me in the Desart, with purpose I should neuer returne: yet he fauouring me, bound me there no longer then Constantia should remaine Inchanted in the Tower, built by Helyon Prince of Arabia , reuealing vnto mee many secrets that I will hereafter discouer. Not many dayes since, I found my selfe freed from this bondage, whereby he knew that the Enchantment was finished. The same day the Enchantresse Ila fauouring Amphiador , seeing the date of her power grew to an end, came to this Castle, and with her brought Phylotheta not his, but my Daughter, declaring to him my release, with whom hee is fled, carrying Philotheta with them, but whether I know not: Which I feare me will turne to her great sorrow, for his minde is so apt to cruelty and mischiefe, that he careth not to act any villanie to satisfie his owne minde. I rehearse this vnto you, though I know it concernes you not: yet to let you vnderstand that by finishing the Enchauntment I was released: Which Ila knowing, gaue him knowledge of, and that is the cause of his flight: and also I intreat you to graunt me one fauour: That is, to let me know whether your Name be not Constantia ? for my minde giueth mee you are the same. I am (said shee) that most vnfortunate creature, and by this Knights noble Ualour was I set at liberty, to whom I am most infinitely bound. My heart said Delatus reioyceth, that I euer had cause to doe you any courtesie, and that it was my good fortune to see you in this place hauing long wished for your Releasement: not onely for mine owne good, but for that Noble King Persicles sake, who was with me in the Desert where I liued inthralled since his comming into Arabia , who with earnest resolution determined to spend the date of his life in your search: From which I disswaded him; and by my directions he returned into Assyria : for the sequell of your Releasement was reuealed vnto me by Penthrasus himselfe: Which none could atchieue but your owne Sonne, which is this Noble Knight. Nay (sayd hee) doubt not of this, for what he reuealed, and I haue published is true, though it resteth not in my knowledge to dilate the circumstance thereof. They both wondred at his speeches, and the Knight of the Oracle said; Can I be more fortunate, or heare better Newes, or receiue any comfort that can comfort my heart more then this? O Heauens graunt that my ioyfull hope may not be frustrated, but that I may be assured I am discended of such Noble Parents: Which may be true, for Cothanes oft times told me that he found me vpon the top of a Mountaine, lying in swadling cloathes,  & not farre from the body of a Woman, torne and dismembred by Wilde beasts, and many Jewels about me: One of which I haue euer since worne about my Necke: When Constantia saw it, she knew the same embracing him in her arms, and kissing him, whilest he with humble behaviour did her deference. I should be ouer- tedious to recyte their ioyes, and how much Delatus and Alsala made of them, who would not so leaue them, but promised to Trauell with them into Assyria , where they were assured to meete Persicles : but in such sort that none might know them, for that yet Constantia feared her Fathers displeasure. They stayed there but that Night, and earely the next Morning betooke themselues to trauell. Notwithstanding this ioy, the Knight of the Oracle left some sparkes of discontent which troubled all his sences, and turned his quiet into disquyet, which was with remembrance of Philotheta , whose mishap pincht him to the very heart: Who likewise was not free from the like disquiet, fearing neuer to see him againe, little thinking his Name had beene changed, and as little thinking it was hee that ended the Enchauntment: not onely troubled with this Dispaire, but also vexed with Ilaes dealing, who hauing brought her to Amphiador , fled, and was neuer seene of them againe. Amphiador being alone with Philotheta , thought it not good for him to discouer himselfe, least he thereby should hazard his life: but disguising himselfe and Philotheta , he left Arabia , and trauelled into Persia , thinking to liue there vntill his death vndescryed. And finding out an Habitation fit for that purpose, he tolde Phylotheta what he intended, perswading her to abide with him. This troubled her very heart, fearing some greater mischiefe would follow. Which likewise according to her misdoubt, fell out: For now that hee saw no meanes to recouer his Dignitie, nor attaine other Felicity, then to liue in obscurity, his minde being likewise much addicted to Licencious desire, began to dote on Philothetaes beauty, which burst out into a flame, and he reuealed the same in this sort. Philotheta (sayd he) if you knew what I would say, or if you could conceiue my meaning without words, I would refraine to speake: but since there is no hope for me to liue, without I attaine that I desire, I will vtter to you the depth of my good Will, and the thing that I desire so much you should know, which is, that I loue you: this I hope cannot be grieuous vnto you: Neither will you I trust denie to loue me, considering how tenderly I haue alwayes regarded you. Should I not (said she, Loue you) I were to be accounted very ingratefull, and vnworthie to haue found you so kinde, which bindeth me to yeeld you thanks. Then said hee, Let me enioy that Loue, for your Beauty hath pierced my heart, and nothing but the sweete thereof, can ease my torment: Here we may liue together, void of disquyet, enioying each others loue with content, which exceedeth the pleasure that more dignified honour yeeldeth. Philotheta at the first knew his meaning, replying with mildnesse, but her heart so much disdained to yeeld to that he desired, that she could not containe her selfe, but gaue him this bitter answere. Amphiador , Doest thou thinke thy wickednesse can ouermaster my Uertue? or doest thou thinke I can like to heare thy odious speech, that bewraieth the inward rancour of thy heart? or hast thou beheld such loosnes in me, that should animate thee to this dishonourable attempt? or canst thou but conceyue an opinion that I will yeeld to thy wicked lust, which is the fruit of thy ill deuising heart? No, know that I so much abhorre thee, that I shall account the worse of my selfe to haue knowne thee, and curse my cruell destinies, that haue made me to see thee, and rather will end my life most desperately, then suffer my sences, to conceiue one good thought of thee. Then leaue off where thou hast begun, for thou shalt rather see me massacre my selfe, then yeeld to the least part of thy desire. How Amphiador, Philotheta , and Praxentia met. How the two Ladies preuenting Amphiadors lust, and departed towards Assiria . of a distressed Lady, who vttered these words: What misery am I brought into by mine owne doting folly, vpon that vnknowne Knight, which neither regardeth me, nor I shall neuer see him againe: Fond woman that I am, thus to abandon my Fathers Court to liue in obscurity, where I was renowned for vertue: For who heard the name of Praxentia , that did not adore the same? And who was more reuerenced then my selfe that now haue brought my honour into disgrace? and for the loue of a stranger haue refused the loue of so mighty a Prince as Palian ? O Persicles , thee may I curse, for by thy meanes is he thus absent, and thou hast lost him, or left him where he will neuer returne: Amphiador wondred much to heare her name Persicles, Palian , and Praxentia , which seuerall names he knew, maruelling who that should be: but seeing her silent, he drew neare to her, saying: Lady, hearing your laments, I could not chuse but pitty you: which maketh me thus bold to approach into our company, proffering my assistance to aid you in what I can. My friend said Praxentia , against my will you are priuy to my estate, which if you doe pitty, then also succour me, for I am brought low by too much griefe, and weak for want of sustenance, Lady, qd. he, my habitation is not farre hence, whether I will bring you, where you shall not want any thing you will desire. Being come thither, they found Philotheta drowned in teares, the cause whereof he well knew, but Praxentia wondred at it, containing another inward sorrow, to see so sweet a creature in such sadnes. Phylotheta likewise maruelled what she was, hoping by her company to receyue some comfort, which might hinder his practise. He on the other side went foorth againe to meditate, leauing them together, meaning nothing lesse then to pitty either of them, but deuising meanes to attayne both theyr loues, which he was fully resolued to enioy, though the deede were neuer so wicked, and the meanes neuer so hainous. Praxentia hauing well refresht her selfe with such good food as she had receiued, demaunded Philothetaes cause of sorrow. Aye me, said she, none so miserable as I, this Tyrant that brought you hither, is my Father in law, whose minde is so wicked that he attempteth to win me to his lust, which addeth much sorrow to my heart, as I am wearie of my life: my name is Philotheta , daughter to the Duke of Ila , whom all men had thought to haue been since dead, but he being informed of the contrary by the Enchantresse, fled, bringing me hither by force, where he intendeth to keepe me as his bond-slaue, but the Heauens I hope will ordaine some succour to my distresse, your helpe I cannot desire, for that I suppose your selfe in the same state I am in (that is) in distresse: to remedy which euill, you are fallen into a place, that yeeldeth no content, but rather contrarily to insnare me in more misery. Before Praxentia could reply, Amphiador came in, entertained her with many counterfeit courtesies, comforting her with many faire speeches, protesting so many seruices, duties, and promises, as none but one of so impudent a disposition could haue found occasion on such a sudden to proffer: the intent of which words Praxentia as forewarned, well vnderstood, fearing some further mischiefe would follow thereon. That day she could haue no farther conference with Philotheta , for hee was still in theyr company. That night they thought to haue lodged together, but hee ordered the contrary, by which meanes, both that night, and for some three dayes after, they could find no opportunity to vtter their minds each to other. In the meane time he was neuer out of one of their companies, perswading Philotheta to yeeld her liking, so that he had proffeted, and vsing such speeches to Praxentia , as might draw her to a good opinion of him: which when he thought he had affected: one night when Praxentia little thought of such treachery, being ouerwhelmed in drowsie sleepe, hee entred her chamber by a secret way, and comming to her bed side perceiuing her sleepe so soundly, without any more adoe, crept into the bed to her: she feeling one in the bed, was so amazed and affrighted, on the sudden, that before he could embrace her, as he intended, shee leapt out on the other side, and running to the doore, opened the same, to whom he called, saying, I beseech you stay, I meant you no harme by heauen I will not offer you iniury. What villaine art thou, said she, that seekest my dishonour? or what wicked pretence driues thee hither at such vnseasonable time, & in such audacious sort to affright me? neither intending your dishonour, nor vnder other pretence then vertuous, came your poore seruant Amphiador into your presence, but onely with thankefulnes, to make manifest vnto you my hearts true affection: therfore I beseach you shun me not, nor suspect me not, for my heart will sooner see it selfe torne in pieces, then think a thought to wrong your worthines: would I be so madde as trust thee, said she, thou mightest well repute me for immodest, and well might I blame my selfe if I sustayned wrong: therfore for this time I will leaue thee. With that she made fast the doore, and hasted to Philothetaes lodging, knocking very hastily, withall calling aloud Philotheta, Philotheta , let me in, that she being a sleepe, was halfe amazed with the noyse, not daring at the first or second call to open the doore: but when she perceyued it was a womans voyce, she opened the doore, which was no sooner open, but Praxentia stept in, desiring to make fast the same againe. Which done, feare made Praxentia so mute, that vntill she had reassumed her memoriall sences to theyr proper vse, she could not speake a word. Whilest Philotheta with much sorrow beheld her extasie, of demaunding the cause thereof: At last, she declared how Amphiador had vsed her. O most detestable Uillaine, sayd Philotheta , will the Fates suffer him to proceed in his lewdnes and not cut him off? Or can we deuise no good meanes to auoyd his intent? Lady, said Praxentia , doe but ioyne with me, and you shall soone see, that betwixt vs we will rid our selues out of his tyranny, O Lord, said Philotheta , I shall thinke my selfe the most happiest woman liuing, and for euer honour you, if by your counsell and helpe I may attaine this felicity. Then said Praxentia , doe but this next night by some meanes conuay his swords into my Chamber, and there hide your selfe in secret vntill I come, in the mean time I will deale so with him this day, that he shall againe come to my chamber, without suspect of our intent, but with meere hope to attaine my loue: where, when he is come, I will so worke with him that eyther we will by cunning out-reach him, or sheath the same into his bowels. All this sayd Philotheta , will I constantly performe. Earely the next morning Philotheta fetcht Praxentiaes apparell, which when she had put on, she went downe where she knew Amphiador was: who espying her, presently came to her, desiring her to pardon his last nights ouersight. Syr, sayd she, I was disquyeted therewith more then I needed, considering you meant me no violence, as you protest: but it was a great folly in you to come at so vnseasonable a time, and not make the party acquainted therewith, Pardon me, I humbly desire you, said he, and withall pitty me that am ensnared in the bands of loue to your beauty, which will bee most pleasing to my sences, and preserue my life, and whatsoeuer you shall demaund mee in recompence thereof, I will performe. Many such speeches he vsed, and she counterfeited many faint denials, which yet was intermingled with such hope, that he perceyued she would yeeld: and therefore hee the more earnestly intreated, vowed, swore, and protested to winne her consent, which at last according to her appoyntment, she graunted, but with such conditions as furthered the purpose of their intended reuenge. He ioyfull thereof left her, and she went to Philotheta declaring euery circumstance, how she had dealt with him. When night approached, hee left theyr company and went walking abroad, to meditate on his ensuing pleasure, thinking by that he returned, they would be parted to their seuerall Lodgings. In which time Philotheta conuayed into the chamber two swords, which was all the weapons which was in the house, and hid her selfe closely from being seene. When hee thought it time, he came to the chamber doore, where he found Praxentia very ready to let him in, whose heart faintly trembled with feare at the sight of him, but yet she shooke it off with as much courage as might be in a Woman. When he was entred and the doore made fast, hauing first embraced her with a lasciuious kisse, which she patiently endured, voyd of doubt by reason of her promise, he went to Bed, whilest she stood trifling, as if she had been most busily vndressing her selfe. When she saw him in Bed, she came to the bed-side, giuing him a betraying kisse, vttering these words. Amphiador said shee, How much doe I now differ from Chastity, that must yeeld to violate the same without the holy Rites of Marriage, wherein I shall cast away myselfe, and make my Name in Oblique in the whole World, if you forsake me, of whose faith I haue no assurance? Tush (qd. he) feare not, but come to bed, and then I will make thee so faithfull a Promise, that thou shalt rest therewith contented. That were (said she) to yeeld possession before, and afterwards repent. By my soule (said he) I will not doe so much as touch you before I be licensed by your free consent. Then (said she,) for my better assurance let mee binde your hands, and then I will without delay come to you. He accounted that request to proceed from bashfull Feare, not from pollicie: thinking though his Hands were bound, he should be good enough for her with his Leggs, he granted it. Then she tooke a scarfe which she had brought of purpose, and therewith bound his hands so fast, that it was impossible for him to vndoe them. Which done, Phylotheta stept foorth, deliuering one of the Swords to Praxentia , and holding the other against his Brest, said: Now Amphiador , What hath thy lewdnes brought thee vnto, but to miserie: thinkest thou (that hadst no mercy in seeking our dishonour) shalt finde Remorse in vs to worke reuenge? Nay villanous traytor said Praxentia , should we suffer so vile a miscreant to liue, we should doe a wicked deed: for a man of thy impious condition will infect the World. Art thou so treacherous as thou carest not what lawes thou violatest, and yet so simple to be ouerreacht by a silly Woman? yet know whom thou hast offended, and to whom thou wouldest haue done violence. Know I say traytor that my name is Praxentia , Daughter to the King of Persia , that will worke reuenge vpon thee, worthie thy hainous acte. Philotheta maruelled when she heard her Name, and he lay confounded with shame, his Coward heart fainting with such feare, that with little violence it would haue beene ouercome. To make him more sure the one of them bound his feet, whilest the other stood ready to stab him if he styrred: Which done, they withdrew themselues, consulting which way to be rid of him. Most Noble Lady (said Philotheta ) your Prudence hath set vs at liberty from this Tyrant, whom (so it please you) we will leaue in this place, and not staine our Innocent hands, with shedding such impure bloud. But said Praxentia , how shall we escape from hence? Easily (sayd she) for leauing him fast bound, there is none to pursue vs, but we may with safety trauell whether it please you. When they had thus concluded, Praxentia came to him, vttering these speeches. Amphiador , we cannot as yet resolue how to worke sufficient Reuenge vpon thee, therefore make no exclamation, but with patience abide our will, which will be too fauourable: for if we heare thee but once open thy mouth, we will in such sort vse thee, that thou shalt wish thou hadst followed our directions. Which said, locking fast the doores, they left him. Then they beganne to consult, what to doe, Praxentia saying; Lady, it may be your determination is to returne into Arabia , which will be an occasion of our separation, For my purpose is to iourney into Assiria , vpon an occasion that concerneth me no lesse then my life: which I shall reueale vnto you, vpon your promise of secresie. I were not worthy to liue (said she) would I reueale your Counsell. Then did she repeat to her, her Loue to Montelyon , and how Palian crost the same, vntill his departure with Persicles, Philothetaes heart melted within her to heare that speech, fearing to be disappoynted of her intent, and misdoubting his Constancie, being troubled with extreame anguish that so great a Princesse should be her corriuall: sometimes dispairing with a conceit that Montelyon did not esteeme her according to his speech, and her owne perswasion, but that he proffered his loue to her of a customable common courtesie, to try her, not of affection. Many other cogitations suddenly concurred in her braine, but seeing Praxentia expect a Reply, without further meditation she made this replie. Most Noble Princesse, if you will accept of my company, I will in regard of your courtesie vndeseruedly showne to me, venture my selfe with you, and doe my best to further you in attaining your desire Praxentia was glad thereof. And with this resolution in the morning they left that place, trauelling directly towards Assiria , chaunging theyr over- Garments, to Palmers-gray, the best meanes to passe without molestation. How the Knight of the Oracle, Constantia , and the rest, hearing a lamentable cry, found Amphiador starved to death. himselfe they meant him no harme, and againe adding doubt to that perswasion, because of Praxentia : but when it grew to be Night, he maruailed that they came not againe: then he began to suspect that which was true indeed, that they were departed, which vexed him so much, that he would haue destroyed himselfe if he could haue found meanes: continuing the length of that discomfortable Night in cursing his owne Fortune and Folly, that had brought him to that misery: thinking to his greater discomfort, eyther to starue there without food, or to preserue his Life by eating his owne flesh, and so dye a lingring death. Some foure dayes after, Fortune so brought things to passe, that the Knight of the Oracle, Delatus, Constantia and Alsala , with many others in their company, hauing lost their way, lighted on this discomfortable place, where Amphiador lay for want of food, making such outragious lamentation, that it pierced the Eares of the Knight, who first hearing the same, set spurs to his Steed, entring the house, the doores whereof, he found open, and drawing his Sword, he found the Chamber from whence that pitteous cry proceeded, fast lockt, which he brake open, and found Amphiador in such a lamentable plight, that the Water stood in his eyes. Amphiador seeing him, cryed out to him for meat, as the thing he most wanted. What art thou sayd he? My Name, qd. he, is Amphiador , wicked Amphiador , that for my sinne endures this punishment. The Knight of the Oracle presently vnbound him, and went with him downe to search for Uictuals, which Amphiador soone found. By this time Delatus and the rest were entred, and Amphiador suddenly espying Alsala , whom he knew, was so astonisht, that he fell downe dead. Farewell said the Knight of the Oracle , haddest thou dyed sooner, then should not some haue had cause to complaine of thy tyranny. They made short tarriance in this place, for that it yeelded so little comfort, but againe trauailed towards Assyria . How the Emperour of Persia and Macedonia met, to conclude the Peace betweene Persicles and the King of Armenia . How Persicles erected a Pavilion to entertaine all strangers. And how the Knight of the Oracle and Constantia arrived there: How Persicles discouered them: and of the exceeding ioy was made for their safety. And how Persicles , knew the Knight of the Oracle to be his owne sonne, and was afterward married to Constantia . The Emperours of Persia and Macedonia , according to the Peace ratified betwixt Persicles and the King of Armenia , met at the City of Pisos , where they were receiued by Persicles in such honourable, bountifull, and courteous sort, as is not to be described. This City Pisos bordereth on the vtmost Confines of Assyria , not aboue a furlong distance from Armenia , on the edge whereof likewise stood the City of Lisar , rich and populous where the King of Armenia then lay: betweene those two Cities, was so large a Ualley of Plaines, that the faire prospects of both the Cities lay open to each others view: in the midst of this Ualley were the royall Tents of Persia and Macedonia pitcht, and about them a number of Tents of gallant Knights, that came to beare them company: the Cities were both of them fortified with Garrisons of Souldiers, to preuent all occasion of iniury that might be offered on eyther party. The Emperour of Macedonia likewise brought with him his three sons. Mentus, Drurus , and Thetus , his Empresse, his faire Daughter Sabina , in whose company were the choyce Ladies of Macedonia . And such Troupes of valiant Knights, that all the Ualley was filled with their Tents and Pauilions. Persicles trusting to the assurance Delatus had giuen him of Constantiaes release, caused all the beautifull damzels in Assyria to be brought before him, electing out of them a hundred, for whom he caused most costly attyres of White to be prepared and deliuered to each of them. He caused also a most stately Pauilion to be erected in the view of all the rest, of such costly and curious worke, that all that beheld it admired the rare Workemanship thereof. Ouer the doore of this Pauilion were these Uerses written in Letters of Gold. Honour, Valour, and Vertue, guard this place, Where Harbour is for all that those embrace: An absent Knight of honoured guifts and fame, Shall be their Host, Montelyon is his name. Here boldly enter, rest, repose, and feed, For love to him, made Persicles doe this deed, Who so he be, can tell where he remaines, Shall have a principall guift to quite his paines. Persicles entent in doing this was, that whatsoeuer Stranger came, that had not good prouision of his owne, should there finde Entertainment in honour of Montelyon : in whose memoriall, he had built the same, as a remembrance of his loue and fauour. His intent being to draw all strangers thither, by whose report (hoping he might heare some Newes of his beloued Friend Montelyon : Trauell within few dayes had brought the Knight of the Oracle , and his Company into Assyria , where they met with an Assyrian of whom the Knight of the Oracle , demanded whose Tents were those they beheld. He declared so much as he knew: Where may we haue Lodging sayd he? Not within a City, answered the Assyrian , for thither are none permitted to come without examination? But in the midst amongst those Tents there is one Pauilion, the most beautifullest that euer Eye beheld, built in remembrance of the Noble Knight Montelyon , that freed our Country from the Armenians oppression: in which place all that are strangers, and without prouision of their owne haue Entertainement in his remembrance. Wilt thou direct vs thither (sayd he) and I will reward thee? I will sayd he. When they were come thither, according to the Assyrians report, they were honourably entertained, and Lodged in such sort as themselues desired. And for that it was very late, euery one departed to their place of rest, remitting conference vntill the next Morning. Earely in the Morning the Knight of the Oracle , Arming himselfe, mounted his Steed, and rode vp and downe vntill it was noone to behold the Tents, and beautifull scituation of those two Cities, and some Tilts & Turneys that were performed by certain Knights Returning at noone to conferre with Constantia his Mother about the discouery of them to Persicles, Persicles hearing that many strangers were in Montelyons Pauilion, that day he disguised himselfe into the Habite of one of his owne men, onely to view them, and to see whether his seruants vsed the so honorably as he intended they should. And comming into the roome where Constantia , the Knight of the Oracle, Delatus and Alsala was, at the first sight he knew Delatus and Montelyon , which was called the Knight of the Oracle , and viewing well Constantia , he likewise at the first sight knew her: Then did he immediately beleeue that the Knight of the Oracle had released her, which was Montelyon : which Delatus told him should be finished by his owne Sonne. These ioyes concurring, fild vp his sences with such delight, that he was inforced to withdraw himselfe from being discouered, which at that time he would not be. Altering his disguise againe, and without further deliberation, he went to the King of Persiaes Tent, and finding him in a conuenient place, he vttered these kind words. Most renowned King, the Friendship and helpe I haue receiued by your fauour, without any merit of mine owne, hath made me the most infinitely bound to your Excellency: yet neuerthelesse, I must request one further fauour at your hands, which you may with more safety grant, then deny, and thereby also make me and your selfe happy. My louing Friend, sayd he, whatsoeuer it be, I will not deny it you, I make the more doubt, sayd he, because I haue heard you vow the contrary, and yet should you performe that vow, it would procure you much discontent. A rash vow, sayd he, may be broken, and therefore let me know your request, and it may be I will dispence therewith. My desire is, you would pardon Constantia your Daughter, and remit the offence committed by her, and him that caused her to leaue the Persian Court. Why my Lord qd. he, doe you know where she is? First, I beseech you grant my request, and then I will reueale vnto you all that I know. For your sake, sayd he, I will freely accept her into my fauour. Then I most humbly thanke you sayd he, both for her and my selfe: For it was my most vnhappy selfe, that was the cause of her departure, but since that time I haue not seene her vntill this day. For going to the Pauillion, which is named by Montelyon : this day I espyed her there, in company of Montelyon , which is called Knight of the Oracle : The King of Persia reioyced to heare that Newes, which pleased him so well, that he could not chuse but reueale it to the Empresse, who was ready to run foorth of her Tent to see her. The Emperour and Empresse with a goodly Traine, accompanyed by Persicles , who had sent for the hundred Damzels, and most of the Peeres of Assyria , to welcome Constantia , with great royalty, went to Montelyons Pauilion, the Emperour and Empresse going before, and he comming after: that when their greetings were past, he might haue the more liberty to embrace Constantia . They entring the roome where Constantia was, conferring with Montelyon , knew her, and she them, and falling prostrate on her knees before them, whilest they Welcommed her with such kindnesse, as if they had neuer conceiued offence against her. Whilest they welcommed the Knight of the Oracle, Persicles embraced Constantia , each weeping for joy. Oh God, sayd Persicles , neuer was I blest whilest this good happy houre, after so much sorrow, to enioy such pleasure. Montelyons approach brake off his speech, who kneeled before him. Nay my deere Friend sayd Persicles , kneele not for I am not worthy to be so honoured. My Lord (sayd Delatus ) well may he doe it, for hee is your owne Sonne, which you need not doubt of, for he freed his Mother, which none but himselfe could haue done. More Honour, Ioy, Comfort and Content, sayd Persicles , could neuer haue happened to any Mortall man then doth this day to me, to find a Father, a Wife, and a Sonne, that this day knew not I had eyther Father, Wife, or Sonne: one so honourable and magnificent, the other so vertuous, beautifull, and louing, and the last so valiantly vertuous, magnanimous and prudent, that all the Worlds wealth cannot counteruaile my riches. And turning to the Emperour, kneeling downe with them, he sayd. Renowned Emperor, I beseech you accept vs three as your Children, and into your fauor, remitting all displeasure conceiued against vs. Then did the Emperor and Empresse, and Deloratus and Piera all embrace them, shedding teares of joy for this happy meeting. The Nobles welcomming the Knight of the Oracle , and the Lady Constantia , and such ioy was made on euery side as is not to be exprest. And parting from thence towards the City in great royalty, they were Welcommed thither by the Citizens, Nobles, Marchants, and Artizans, with great Royalty, where the Emperor vsed these speeches. See here my Friends of Assyria , your Liege Lord and Soueraigne, the Son of Constantia my Daughter, and your Lord Persicles : How may you applaud the bounty of Heauen, prouiding for you such a Noble Prince: Then taking Constantia by the hand, he sayd: Here Persicles take my daughter, I giue her thee, as freely as the Heauens gaue her me, that Marriage may ioyne hands, as true Loue hath vnited your hearts many yeares since. He tooke that gift with as great joy, and in as high estimation, as if he had deliuered him the whole Worlds Monarchy, saying: Most mighty Emperor I know not how to render sufficient thanks, in that your Highnes is pleased to enrich and honour me with your worthy daughter which is the onely thing I alwayes desired: For which, I hope to shew such deserts hereafter, as neither she shall be discontented, nor your Majesty repent your gentle deed. How the two Ladyes Philotheta and Praxentia arrived at the Pavilion, and how Phylotheta discovered to Montelyon, Praxentiaes Love to him, to make tryall if hee loved her, whom she her selfe most entirely loved. The end of this dayes joy had brought the two Ladies Praxentia and Philotheta after long trauell vnto the Citty Walles, where (in their Palmers Weeds) they heard the Newes, and saw the Triumph, where the Knight of the Oracle bare away the prize, whom they were informed to be Montelyon , and Sonne to Persicles and Constantia : This newes affected both their hearts with exceeding joy. Praxentia hoping to enioy his Loue, and Phylotheta purposing to liue no longer, then to liue in hope to doe the like: taking the Entertainment of the Knight of the Oracles Pauilion, which yeelded them such security as they desired. Praxentia bethinking her selfe of a course to effect her desire, brake her mind to Philotheta in these Words. Lady Philotheta , I am more beholding vnto you for vndertaking this trauell for my sake, then I shall euer liue to requite: Notwithstanding, for that my passions craue pitty and your good helpe, I beseech you ayde me in this extremity, I haue made my Name and Fortunes known vnto you, and how it will be in vaine for me to stay, for should I manifest my loue, it would turne to my euerlasting dishonour, I will therefore onely make my being here knowne to none but the Knight of the Oracle , which shall be done by this meanes, if you will for my sake vndertake it. In this habit you may as safely goe withou being knowne, as if you had neuer beene seene, and finding him out, giue him knowledge of my being here, of my loue, and of the Misery I haue endured for his sake, vttering the same in such forme of words, as shall best like you: this will be the meanes to bring me comfort: and if for my sake you will take this paines, I will hereafter prostrate my life at your feet. Phylotheta promised her that she would doe it the next day, whatsoeuer ensued thereon, as faithfully as she did desire, and if it were but to try his Constancy. Earely in the Morning, Philotheta disguising her selfe so cunningly that she could by no meanes be knowne, left the Pauillion to seeke opportunity to deliuer her Message: and comming to the City-Gates with a premeditated excuse, if she were examined, where she found no resistance, but comming to the Pallace, she entred into the great Hall, where she stayed to see the royalty of the Court, vntill she espyed the Knight of the Oracle , onely attended by his Page. passe by into the Garden, her Mayden feet treading chast steppes after him, vntill he looking backe, espying a Palmer follow him, stayed, with courteous speech demanding if he would speake with him. Who said: Knight of the Oracle . I haue a matter of secresie to deliuer vnto you. The most vertuous, beautifull, and constant Lady Praxentia , whom you well know, hauing euer since she saw you first, loued you, though without comfort, enduring much sorrow for your absence, regarding more her loue to you, then her owne life, Parents, and Country, and hath for your sake, left her Pompe  & dignity to liue in sorrow and misery to finde you out, who remaineth now in the Pauillion, where for your sake all strangers are harboured, in such sorrow and anguish, as did you but behold the same, your vertuous mind could not chuse but pitty her. This am I told to vtter vnto you, not sent hither, but in pitty of her, and to doe you good, she being the onely Daughter of the mighty Emperor of Macedonia . Palmer, said he, I commend thy good meaning, and wish that I could follow thy counsell, which bringeth much disquiet to my heart: I pitty her more then she doth her selfe, and could wish not to haue beene borne, rather then she should doe her selfe wrong, for my sake: she is worthy to be beloued, and I not the Honour she intendeth me: yet can I not without as great and greater torment (then she endureth) alter my affections that are already setled, where I yet reape no hope of comfort, and am kept from by many difficulties, that maketh me equall to her in sorrow. I speake not this with intent you should tell it her, for that were to make her more desperate, if your words be true: but I feare me, you are sent by her, which if it be so, you shall doe me wrong, and her no good, therefore I pray you disswade her if you can, for a strangers counsell in such matters may preuaile much: and if you can bring me Newes that she hath reuolted from this Loue, I shall thinke my selfe most happy. Syr, sayd the Palmer, I would returne to you againe, if I knew which way I might conueniently come to speake with you: I will be (sayd he) to morrow without the City about this time, hoping to heare better newes of her by thy perswasions: Then giuing the Palmer a Rich Iewell for his paines, they parted. Philotheta out of the Pallace, and he into the Garden, meditating on that which he had heard. Philotheta by this time was returned to the Pauillion, vttering the whole summe of the conference she had with the Knight of the Oracle vnto Praxentia : With which she was so grieued, that Philotheta expected when she would haue yeelded vp the Ghost, fearing that she would haue run mad, which to preuent, she sayd. Be not so impatient, but hearken to my counsell, I haue appointed to come to him to Morrow, at which time I will deale so effectually with him, that he shall come and speake with you. When seeing your Laments, there is no doubt but he may be won to consent. This somewhat satisfied Praxentia , yet her Mind was so full of griefe and vexation, that her Eyes could take no rest, with such affection she expected the next Newes. Philotheta was not voyd of care, as she had good cause, vndertaking a matter against her selfe, yet to make assured tryall of his Constancy, she did it, but being alone, she Meditated on the doubtfull issue of this attempt, which would bring her eyther much Ioy, or Sorrow: sometimes perswading her selfe, it was her selfe he loued that he was constant and that no perswasions could alter him: yet she thought Praxentiaes birth, beauty, & laments, might ouercome him, and the rather for that he had no assurance of her Loue, nor euer to see her againe. Thus did this faire Lady torment her selfe with contrarieties of doubts, longing as much, or rather more then Praxentia , for the next Mornings speech. Of the Treasons practised against the Knight of the Oracle . The King of Armenia seeing such a league concluded by meanes of this marriage betweene the Emperours of Persia , and Persicles , enuying his good, thought that he was likely to preuaile nothing against him by meanes thereof, called vnto him a Knight, whom he most fauoured, and had alwayes beene counselled by, named Cisor , and vnto him he vttered his discontent, who presently counselled him to breake the peace, and suddenly to surprize the City. The King liked not that counsell, but rather desired by some secret meanes either to poyson Persicles and the Knight of the Oracle : or else to set some discord betweene them and the Emperour of Macedonia, by which meanes the peace might be broken, and the ambiguity of the doubt be left vnended, whereby hee might renew his warre. Cison promised to performe some thing to that effect: who presently, finding out Palian , vttered his mind to him in these wordes. Noble Prince, I maruell that you suffer your glory to be darkned by this vpstart Knight, that nameth himselfe of the Oracle . Can it be that so honourable a minde as yours should brooke such indignities? is not Assyria yours by right, are you not more noble by birth? are you not euery way as worthy to be as famous as he is? You liue here in security, suffering him and his father that scorneth you, to carry away the Palme and prize of honour. Are all the Knights in Armenia too weake to cope with him? doth not his behauiour shew that he scorneth you? hath hee not alone crost your good fortune, then liue not to be laught at, but to reuenge. Ioyne you with the Emperour of Macedonias sonnes, who are of the same minde I am, and I will lay you downe such a plot as shall abate his brauery. If these Knights and such as are now come out of Macedonia and Persia, cannot foyle them, then shall you liue in contempt of the World, and be accounted theyr inferiour. Cisor said he, thou renuest my griefe a fresh, for I haue drunke so much of sorrow in that kinde of odiscontentment, that my heart is ouercome therewith, and would faine worke my releasement. If you would bee secret, and sweare to assist mee, I should reueale you the whole depth of my heart: vpon his protestations, hee reuealed his loue to Praxentia , and how he was crost by Montelyon , and withall, what had past since, and of her escape out of Persia , which shee did onely for his loue that regarded her not, and how much he desired meanes of reuenge: his minde being apt to entertaine any complot were it neuer so dishonourable. Cisor then said, confer with the Emperours Sonnes, and discouer to them with what earnestnesse Praxentia hath sought his loue, and receiuing scorne for her affection, and disdaine for her good will, hath in a desperate sort (ashamed to be so reiected) stole from the Court of the king of Persia , eyther to destroy herselfe, or wilfully to liue in perpetuall exile: when they heare this, their hearts will easily be wonne to reuenge her wrong: which done, let them alone to meditate thereon. Cisor hauing in this sort whetted him on, left him, which so much preuailed, that he put the same in practise with the Emperours sonnes, that they began mortally to hate Montelyon . Agreeing to arme themselus in such Armour as none but Cisor should know them, and for some few dayes to lodge in the Pauilion, and there to deuise which way to worke him some disgrace. Upon this conclusion they parted, euery one to prouide themselues of armour for that purpose. How the Knight of the Oracle , arrieud at the Pauilion, disguised to satisfie Praxentia . How he was discouered by Palian , how Palian and the King of Macedonias sonne would haue murdered him. How he slew one of them, and was accused by Praxentia of a Rape, which brake the concluded League. The time being come, and Philotheta not failing, met the Knight of the Oracle to doe her message. How now Palmer said he, doest thou bring me newes that Praxentia hath giuen ouer her loue? if thou hast tell me, if not I pray thee trouble me not. My Lord, said Philotheta , she rageth most extreamely, and I feare me, will doe her selfe some violence vnlesse you pitty her. That cannot I doe said he, although it pincheth my heart to heare of her sorrow: what should I say more? or what wouldest thou wish me to doe, to ease her and yet reserue my loyalty? Sir, replyed Philotheta , may you consider that she is honourable, vertuous, fayre, and the Daughter of a King, worthy to be beloued, and it may be the Lady whom you loue, is not comparable to her in any of these giftes: No, nor in loue, which may peraduenture loue another, and then shall you wrong your selfe and iniury her, expecting that which you haue no assurance of. Peace Palmer qd. he, if my fortunes proue so bad, the greater will be my misery: therefore tell me what thou wouldest haue me doe: my L. said she, had I not promised her to bring you to speake with her, she would haue destroyed her selfe ere this: therefore vouchsafe me such fauour, that I may performe my word, which may be a meane to end this mallady. Didst thou know, qd. he, how vnwilling I am to doe it, I thinke thou wouldst not request it: but to satisfie her of that, which peraduenture she will not credit by thy report, and at thy request, I will come to her this euening. Till then farewell qd. he. Philotheta being parted from him, by the way vttered these speeches. O that fortune would fauour me so much, and blesse me with that felicity, to be the party this worthy Knight so constantly loueth. By this she was come to the Pauilion, where euen then there entred foure Knights in black armour, gallantly mounted, by theyr outward habite portended some fatall stratagem: which were Palian  & the 3. sonnes of the King of Macedon, who had vowed eyther secretly or openly to plot the death of Montelyon : taking vp theyr Lodging there to complot their treason. The day being past, which the Knight of the Oracle ouerpast in many solitary meditations, to the great griefe of Persicles and Constantia , who wondred thereat, he went to his chamber, apparelling himselfe in the habit of one of the kings seruants, onely gyrding his sword to his side, went vnto the Pauilion, concealing himselfe as closely as he could, but the heauens ordaining him to endure some misery, and the eyes of enuy and suspition, discouering him to Palian , who espied his comming thither, and being entred the Pauilion, he was met by Philotheta , who with such carefulnesse expected his comming, conducting him into the place, where Praxentia was, which went so sore against her heart to doe, that with very griefe shee was ready to die: whither treacherous Palians eyes watched him. Praxentia espying him, could not abstaine from blushing exceedingly, her owne heart accusing her of immodesty, to reueale that which she would haue concealed. Hee saluted her, vttering these words. Most noble Princesse, to fulfill your desire, and shew my gratitude vnto you for your friendshippe bestowed on him that is not worthy thereof. I am come to you, desiring you not to misconceiue of me, nor condemne me of inhumanity, that am not mine owne, and therefore I cannot giue my selfe vnto you I haue vttered vnto the Palmer that which I will now conceale as loath to offend you, yet constrained thereto, desiring you to command my life, if you please, for that shall be at your disposition, other wise I cannot imploy my selfe to your liking. I haue long since knowne of your good will to me, which Palian by his subtilty increased, of whose loue and proceedings I know so much, that I thinke I shall wrong him to fulfill your request: my selfe was the man that should haue ioyned your hands, when he tooke my habit and name vpon him, which I presume here to vtter, that thereby you may remember my innocency in that complot, and how constantly I haue vowed my selfe to another. Praxentia what with anger, shame, and griefe, stood like one mute, vexed that he knew of Palians act, shame to make loue contrary to the property of her kinde, and grieued to be disappoynted: all which together not suffering her to speake, vntill at last these passions, and her burning loue so ouercame her, that kneeling downe she said. Good knight blame me not, nor doe not condemne me of immodesty, but grant pitty to my torment. He taking her vp, desired her not to kneele to him that was not worthy thereof, nor able to deserue it: then taking him by the hand, she desired him to sit downe by her vpon the bed, beckning to Philotheta to depart the roome. To repeat what manner of behauiour Praxentia vsed, and the words she spake, would haue made any modest eare to blush to heare of: but seeing that nothing would preuaile, rage and lust so ouerruled her, that in bitter exclaimes she cryed out: Inhumane, disloyall, & dishonourable knight, doest thou requite my loue with this disdaine? or thinkest thou I will liue to beare the blot of thy refusall? At the conclusion of which words, Thetus entred the roome, & with his sword drawne, ran at him, who by good fortune beholding him, started aside, otherwise he had beene slaine, yet he was sore wounded, wherewith he drew his sword, striking at Thetus , and at euery blow wounding him. Philotheta hearing the noyse, came in & seeing the Knight of the Oracle wounded, with feare grief, and amazement cryed out, helpe, helpe, the Kings son will be murdered. The Eccho of her shrill voyce sounded throughout the whole Pauilion, and both the seruants and other Knights came running thither, but before they came, he had gotten Thetus , and ouerthrowne him, thrust his sword into his body. By this time Palian and his two brethren came in, who seeing Thetus slayne cryed out: Stay the Traytor, hee hath murdered Thetus , son to the King of Macedonia. Praxentia hearing that, tore her hayre, rent her garments, and disfigured her face in such sort as was Lamentable to behold. Some began to lay hands on the Knight of the Oracle , but his fathers seruants knowing him stood in his defence: Then began there a hote combat on both parts, and many were slayne. Praxentia being now discouered, was knowne to Palian and her two brethren, to whom shee cryed, Reuenge my shame, and my brothers death on this wicked Knight, who seeketh by violence to dishonour me, hath slaine my brother? What griefe was this to Philotheta you may iudge: and how much it vexed him to be thus betrayed, cannot be vttered: standing in his owne defence, against such as would haue apprehended him, that knew him not, vntill he was grieuously wounded, and many of them slaine, in which time newes thereof was come to the hearing of Persicles , the Emperour of Persia , and the King of Macedonia , who with all haste came thitherwards: The Souldiers likewise hearing of the Knight of the Oracles distresse, brake the conditions of the concluded peace, and by multitudes ran foorth of the Citie to preserue them. Persicles first entred the Tent, next him the Kings of Persia and Macedonia , giuing commandement vpon paine of death, that no man should strike a blow. Yet notwithstanding, rashnes and heavy force so ouercame them, that it was long before they were appeased. And the Emperour seeing Praxentia there, in such sort disfigured, demanded if any could tell the cause of that mischiefe: First Praxentia spake being most guilty, yet first thinking to excuse her selfe: Noble Emperour, my brother you see is slaine in rescuing me from that knights violence. The Knight of the Oracle kneeling downe before the Emperour, sayd: My noble Grand-father, I slew him in mine owne defence: neyther did I know what hee was, being my selfe trained hither to my death. More he would haue sayd, but the Souldiers hauing entred the Pauilion, rested not vntill they had gotten vnto him, and he to satisfie them, and auoyde further mischiefe, departed with them to the Citty. Then did the Emperour and Persicles comfort the King of Macedonia , but he vexed with his Sonnes death, and his Daughters disgrace, and vrged by his other Sonnes importunacy, said: Emperour of Persia , I am now much wronged, and too much abused by thee and thy Progenie, by whose falsehood I see my Children lye dead before my face: How should I then be contented? By Heauen I sweare, I will reuenge this villany. King of Macedonia (said Persicles ) I defie thee, for accusing me or mine of any dishonour, and thou shalt see and finde this Accusation is false; why else are thy sonnes here disguised, with my enemy Palian ? by whose Complot this mischiefe, was pretended against my Sonne, though the punishment lighted vpon themselues. Of the griefe Philotheta endured for this misfortune. How shee was taken, and carried to the Armenian Hoste. Of Raleas misfortune: And the message she deliuered to the Knight of the Oracle . selfe out of sight, and in bitter exclaimes lamented her hard fortune, but most of all, that she was the cause of Montelyons comming thither, which had so neere endangered his dearest life. Therefore she shrowded her selfe vntill it was night, which being come, she trauelled further into the Country, and there by selling a Iewell, and good fortune, not being discryed she altered her old habit into her right forme staying, certaine dayes in a Uillage, some six miles distant fro the Citty of Pisos , in the house of an ancient Lady named Ralea , to whom she related her misfortunes, procured by Amphiador , concealing her Loue to Montelyon , which she durst not commit to her secresie. This Ralea being a woman of great wisedome, vsed Phylotheta wondrous kindely, promising in words, and her deeds shewing it, that if she would stay with her, she would as dearely tender her, as her owne daughter, whom she caused continually to accompany Philotheta . She reioyced at this good fortune, and being alone she vttered these speeches. Praxentia , thee onely may I accuse for this miserie, for whom I vndertooke a taske, which my heart euen then abhorred, and now repent, not so much intending to procure thee that thou desiredst, as to satisfie my owne disquyet sences, by the same meanes hauing drawn the most loyall knight into danger of his life, whose blood thou didst seeke to spill, else wouldest thou not so dishonorable  & falsly haue accused him. The consideration of which stratageme, drew such a floud of teares from her eyes, that she could not stop theyr passage. Which Ralea espying, demanded the cause thereof, but seeing Philotheta make no reply, she sayd Philotheta , I pitty your estate, and would gladly know the cause, that I might vse my indeauour to comfort you, Philotheta trusting to vertue, disclosed to her the loue he bare to Montelyon , and all that had passed twixt her and Praxentia , as is before rehearsed. Ralea thereby noting her beauty, commended the same: promising her, that if with patience she would quiet her selfe some few dayes, she would vse all meanes possible to comfort her. Montelyon hauing recouered his wounds, gathered together a mighty hoste, and brought them vnto the City of Pisos , whither were assembled the choyse souldiers, noblemen, knights, and gentlemen of Persia , to fight in theyr Emperours behalfe, who entrencht themselues without the City. The King of Macedonia and Armenia likewise had gathered together so mighty an Army, as might haue beene thought able to make a conquest of the World, who pitched their Tents about the City in Armenia , where the King of Macedonia and Armenia lay, Montelyons heart was fired with desire to driue backe their foes, not staying to giue them leaue to make the first challenge but humbling himselfe vpon his knee, before the Emperour and his Father, vttered these speeches. Most mighty Emperour, and my noble Father, I haue already I hope satisfied you of my innocency, being trained by some subtilty to my intended death, by Praxentia and her brethren: but for that mine honour hath beene blemished by that infamous accusation, and the common people rest vnsatisfied, and my loss vnreuenged, I humbly craue your licence, that I may send defiance to my false accusers, and by challenge acquite my selfe, which am constrained thus hastily to desire, for that my heart will abide extreame torture vntill it bee finished. The Emperour reioycing at his forwardnesse, and seeing Persicles willing to haue it so, gave his consent. Which done Montelyon left them and arming him himselfe in an armour of white, which he had caused to be made of purpose, that no man should know him, rode into the field betwixt both Campes, and by a Herald sent defience into the Campe of the Armenians . King of Armenia , there is a Knight whom you may behold in the field, that hath sent defiance to all the knights in this Armie, especially to Pallian , whom he accuseth to bee a most disloyall and dishonourable Knight, not worthy to be named a Knight, that he most falsly sought to betray Montelyons life, and withall he offereth by combate to proue against all Knights, that Montelyon is a Knight both honourable and vertuous, and that Praxentias accusation is most false and vntrue. This message was no sooner deliuered, but thousands of Knights made sute to combat him first: but Palian to whom it principally belonged, to defend his owne honour, desired his fathers consent, and obtained it, presently arming himselfe, and gallantly mounted, rode into the field, to him. Montelyon desirous of reuenge, and his heart inwardly tormented with griefe, met Palian with a furious encounter, he answering him with the like, breaking theyr lances with great comelinesse: then drawing theyr swords, began the combat, which was soone ended for within few blowes, Montelyons sword burst, that hee was enforced to close with Palian , with such force wrinking his sworde from him and with the pummell thereof striking him so violently on the head, that he bruised his head and ouerthrew him, euery one thinking he had been dead. Which was no sooner done, but Mensus eldest son to the King of Macedonia , being ready armed, greeted Montelyon with these words. Knight, thou hast vndertaken a tedious taske to Combat all the Knights in this Campe, yet I hope thou shalt neuer doe that, for myselfe will abate thy courage. If they were as many more quoth Montelyon , I feare not all: if thou commest to combat me hold thy tongue, and bestirre thy hands, for I will haue a bout with thee. With that they gaue each other many cruell blowes and receyued some wounds, till Montelyon againe ouercharging his sword with his vnmeasurable strength, brake the same, which so vexed him, that he rusht vpon Mensus to haue closed, but hee knowing his intent, auoyded him, and before he could turne about, gaue him some blowes, which pierced so his armour and flesh, the bloud ranne downe. Montelyon hauing the hilt of his broken sword still in his hand, flung the same with such violence, that lighting short on Mensus horse head, strooke him downe dead, his master hauing much adoe to get from him without harme: whilest Mensus was mounting himselfe on a fresh Steed, Montelyons Squire had brought him the Sword was giuen him by the Hesperian Nymphes, which when he grasped, he sayd: Had I armed myselfe with thee, my Foes had felt some smart, and my selfe lesse disgrace. Meeting againe, such cruell blowes were dealt, that their Armour was mangled and the bloud appeared in many places, but Montelyon charged his Foe so hard, that in short space he got the vantage, and wounded Mensus so sore, that had he not beene rescued he had eyther dyed, or beene forced to yeeld: that Montelyon returned with victory, to the great reioycing of the Assyrians , especially of the Emperour and Persicles . Ralea that day left her house, according to her promise to Philotheta , to try whether Montelyon did affect her or no, comming to the Court at such time as Montelyon was newly vnarmed, and had his few wounds drest, a messenger giuing him knowledge of her comming. Being come to him, and all auoyded the Chamber, she sayd: Noble Prince, I come to bring you newes, that not many dayes since, there hapned to come to my house a Lady in disguise of a Palmer, desiring that I would for certaine dayes entertaine her, vntill the Wars were ended, for that she had a message to deliuer vnto you from a Lady in Arabia , named Philotheta , which she thought good to conceale for a time, vntill you had better leasure to heare it, and to performe that which she requested. Notwithstanding, for that I honour you aboue all men, and would shew my duty to you in any respect, I haue aduentured to giue you knowledge thereof without her knowledge, being ready to bring her vnto you at any time, if you please to heare the same. Montelyons heart was exceedingly comforted to heare Phylotheta named, much more that she had sent to see him, and most of all what the message should be, how she could tell where he was, or how she could remember him, that had neuer but once seene him: sitting in a deepe and silent meditation, but before he had ended the same, a stranger and Seruant of Raleaes entred, vttering these words. Madam since you departed much sorrow hath befalne vs, for certaine companies of the Armenian Hoste haue ransackt your house, stoln your Cattell, carryed away the Lady, and consumed all your Goods with fire. Ralia with that fell downe in a deadly Trance, [illeg.] couered, vttered these Words. My noble Lord sayd she, that Lady is the most beautifull Phylotheta , that hath long honoured you with a constant Loue, it was she that in the disguise of a Palmer came as a Messenger to you from Praxentia , who was guiltlesse of that intended practise, her Modesty with- holding her from vttering what she was, and vndertaking that for Praxentia , to make tryall of your vertue, and which way your affections were bent. Redeeme her my Lord, if it be possible, for she is the most vertuous Lady liuing: these words ended, she dyed, which were sufficient to set Montelyons heart on fire, being ready to arme himselfe, but Raleaes seruant seeing it, told him it was too late pursue them, for by that time they were in the Hoast. How the King of Armenia sent Phylothetaes Picture to Delfurno Emperour of Almaigne , who promised to ayde him against Persicles . Of divers combats that Delfurno maintayned in defence of her beauty. beauty, was presently carryed by the Captaine to the Tent of the King of Macedonia , who no sooner saw her, but hee presently thought her a present fit for the greatest Potentate in the World, and withall fearing their Forces were too weake for the puissant Army of their Foes, consulted with the King of Armenia about it, and at last concluded to send Ambassadors vnto Almaigne vnto Delfurno , that then newly succeeded his Father in the Empire, being a Prince of great valour: which Embassage was committed to two Noblemen, one of Armenia , the other of Macedonia The contents whereof was to treat with him of ayde and withall, to proffer him that Lady, whose Picture they carried with them, being drawne by an exceeding cunning workeman. The Embassadors departed, and being arriued, were admitted to Delfurnoes presence, one of them vttering their Message in these words. Most renowned Emperour, the Kings of Armenia and Macedonia , send friendly greetings to your Highnesse, desiring your ayde against their mighty Foes, the King of Assiria and Persia , who are now ioyned together with oppression, and vniust warre to offer them iniurie, the son of Persicles , hauing in most dishonourable sort deflowred Praxentia , and slew Thetus her Brother, seeking her rescue: Besides, my Lords, hauing nothing of more worth then a most beautifull and vertuous Lady, who surpasseth all the Ladies that euer eye beheld, present her vnto you, as being fit for none, but a man of such honour and dignity as your selfe: whose counterfeit imperfectly drawne, we present vnto your Highnesse, desiring your assistance to the ayds of vertue, and suppressing of wrong, which agreeth with your magnaminity. Delfurno hearing of these speeches, and viewing the Picture well, for a while stood in a study. At last he made them answer thus. I know not vpon what ground I should warre against Assyria and Persia , that neuer did me wrong, yet I would willingly assist your Lords, not drawne thereunto by this present, that I esteeme not, but for the loue I beare them, and to punish such dishonour as their Foe hath showne: Therefore returne your Lords this answere, that within three Moneths I will be in Armenia , and bring with me such a power as shall vanquish their foes, and set them in peaceable possession of their rights. The Embassadors after they were honourably entertained, and sumptuously feasted, departed with this joyfull newes, which added both comfort and resolution to the Armenian Hoast. Delfurno being alone, commanded the Picture to be brought into his Chamber, which he viewed and reviewed, beholding the counterfeit with such a surfeiting eye, that he began to affect the absent Lady, by beholding her present Picture. Afterwards calling before him the ancientest Captaines and Commanders that were imployed in his Fathers warres, he commanded them to Muster an Army of forty thousand strong, of the best Souldiers in his Empire, and with all speed to conduct them to the Hoast in Armenia , neither staying his comming, nor expecting other command from him for he would be there before them. This done, he caused a most rich and costly Armour to be wrought of exceeding strength wherewith he armed himselfe, causing a Squire that ended him, to couer the Picture with a rich Uaile: he departed vnknowne of any, with this entent, by combat to make all knights he met, to confesse his Ladies beauty surpassed all others, vntill he came into Armenia , where he determined to challenge all Knights whatsoeuer in that behalfe. Where being vnknowne, and carrying the Picture couered, he arriued sending his Squire with this Message vnto the Generall. Noble Generall, my Master being a Knight of a strange Countrey, hauing trauailed many Miles in search of Aduentures, happening to arriue neare this Hoast, being neyther foe to this Country, nor friend to Persicles , desireth that with your fauour he may make tryall of his valour against the Knights of this Campe, which he will vndertake in defence of his Ladyes vertue, beauty and worthinesse, whom he will maintaine in single combat against all commers, to exceed all others. The King returned this answer. Tell thy Master, he is welcome, and shall haue our free consent to that he requireth: but withall let him take this friendly warning from me, that he be ware what he vndertake, lest the valour of these Knights turne him to repentance. The Squire returned with this answer to his Master, who presently hung the vayled Picture vpon the body of a faire spreading Oake, himselfe resting thereby as a Guardiant, and ready to combate him that came next. The Knights of Armenia and Macedonia hearing of this strange Knights braue Challenge, prepared to joust with him, and the first was a young Knight of Armenia , named Tellutus , who loued Brisa Daughter to the Duke of Linsus , who supposed her beauty by reason of his entyre loue, to excell all, but his Fortune was crost, and he at the second course ouerthrowne. The second that jousted was Arnon , a Knight of Macedonia , that maintayned three courses against him with great agility, but at the fourth he was vnhorsed. Diuers other Knights Iousted him, and had the like Fortune, and his valour bare away the Prize from them all. How the Knight of the Oracle leaving his Parents in disguise, was entertayned by the King of Armenia . Now it fell out that Montelyon hauing heard of the Damzels carrying away from Raleaes house by the Enemy, which he little thought it had beene Philotheta , studied how to redeem her: first he thought it best to be attempted by force of Warre, but that course seemed too tedious: then he bethought himselfe of some speedier meane, for long delay would pinch his heart. These contrarious thoughts driuing him to his wits end: When he had long studyed and yet could resolue of nothing, he mounted his Steed, and in an Armour vnknowne, girding the good sword he loued so well to his side, he rode forth at a Posterne gate so secretly as he could, not as yet resolued what to doe, riding towards the Armenian Host, but a contrary way, as if he had not come from the Assyrian Campe: being come to the Watch, they apprehended him, and he yeelded, desiring to be carryed to their Generall, where being come, the Generall demanded of whence he was? I am qd. he of Arabia , hauing trauailed many yeares in search of strange aduentures. What is your name Sir, qd. he, my name is Honorius . Will you qd. he, serue me against my Foe the Assyrian ? I will sayd he, if your quarrell be just, serue you faithfully, and spend my life to punish disloyalty. With that the Generall repeated the History betweene him and Persicles , shewing the Title and claime he had to the Assyrian crowne, and amongst many other falshoods, accusing Montelyon for Praxentiaes rape, and Thetus death. This vexed Montelyon exceedingly, hoping one day to worke reuenge for all, vsing such behauiour and speech as was most fit for the time, so that he was well entertayned of the Generall, and granted such priuiledge as the rest of the Knights had, being neyther knowne, nor once suspected to be the man he was. How Delfurno arrived at the Armenian Hoast. The next day the Almaine Forces arriued in Armenia , and assuring himselfe that Delfurno would not be long behind, caused Phylotheta to be adorned with most costly and rich Roabes, and to be well attended by a gallant traine of faire Damzels, which he did to please and delight him with her beauty. Philotheta supposed his entent in doing her so much honour, had beene eyther that he pretended Loue to her himselfe, or did it in the behalfe of Palian , which besides the aboundant cares that possest her heart, bred a fresh disquiet in her, resoluing not to loue any but Montelyon . The same day Delfurno likewise, seeing no more would combat him, came to the Court, and discovered himselfe to the King of Armenia and Macedonia , yet desiring to conceale the same, who with great honour and courtesie entertained him: and the more to please him, conducting her to the Pallace, where the Queenes of Macedonia and Armenia were, accompanied by Praxenita , but all in mournfull weedes: and Philotheta glistering in gold, dazeling the eyes of the beholders. Which when Delfurno beheld, at the first view his heart was attainted with louing admiration, euen then vowing his heart her thrall, and of that sudden becomming so bounden a subject to Loue, as his Heart, Hands, Eyes, and euery Member, were deuoted to her seruice. After salutations to all the rest, (who yet knew him not) forgetting longer to conceale himselfe, he came to Phylotheta , saluting her with these speeches: Lady blame me not for vndertaking to be the Champion of your Beauty: I am the Knight that haue these many dayes held Combate against all Knights in your behalfe, not hauing discouered to any your Name, as fearing thereby to offend you: the originall of my attempt, being the earnest zeale and loue I beare to you. Sir, replyed she, your labour was greater then your reward, and more then you needed to haue vndertaken, and little pleaseth me: therefore I pray leaue off to doe so, and then I shall thinke my selfe more beholden to you, the subject not answering the Protestation. Delfurno was nipt with her reply, and so much rauished to heare her heauenly voyce, that he was to seeke of a reply, standing so long in deepe study, that she turned from him, and he started as ashamed of that ouersight, comming to the Kings of Armenia and Macedonia , to whom he sayd: This Ladyes beauty surpasseth all that euer I beheld, I pray tell me of whence she is? Her name quoth Armenia , is Phylotheta , Daughter to a Duke in Arabia , whom if it please your Hignesse to accept of, she I know will yeeld to any honourable request. I like her well indeed quoth Delfurno , and doe me that fauour I may enioy her, and I will binde my selfe your euerlasting Friend. Many other speeches past betwixt them, both of them promising to effect his desire with speed, especially the King of Armenia , who presently left him, and finding her out; he vttered these speeches to her. Fayre Lady, such happinesse may befall you at this instant, if you will be ruled by my counsell, which if your refuse this, and liue many thousand yeares after, you shall neuer light on the like, for the Mightiest Emperour in the world seeketh your Loue with honourable resolution to make you his Wife,  & renowne you with the Title of Empresse: this Knight that euen now offered his seruice to you is he, the Emperour of Almaigne , named Delfurno , that hearing of your beauty, came purposely into this country to behold you, and doe you seruice. Philotheta hearing so old a man become so earnest a soliciter, being neither pleased with his campany nor counsell, gaue him this short answere. Your proffers are as great as liberall: yet neyther pleasing nor acceptable to me, for I liue in this place by constraint, not by consent, by which meanes my minde can thinke on nothing, but to be released from hence, desiring to liue in an other place. How the Knight of the Oracle [illeg.] Phylotheta , and how she was by the King of Armenia committed to his charge. such time as Phylotheta came to goe into the Garden, with a gallant traine of Damzels attending her. Montelyon noting her well, suddenly remembring he had seene her, felt such a Passion oppresse his heart, that he thought it melted within him: When she was past he demanded what Lady that was, that was so gallantly attended? Her name (quoth one) is Philotheta , Daughter to a Duke in Arabia , that was so lately surpriz'd in Assyria , and brought thither with intent to be married to Delfurno the Emperour. Montelyon hearing that, held his peace, getting from the company into a solitary place, where being alone, he vttered these Meditations. And can it be that Phylotheta was in Assyria in her own person, and an others name to bring a Message to me? That need I not doubt of, for Raleaes speeches confirmed it: but may it not be that she sent some other? that cannot be, for they tell me she was surprized in Assyria : Moreouer, Ralea told me, that she came in the Disguise of a Palmer, which Palmer I am assured was euen the very same that trayned me to Praxentiaes presence, Whom I now presently remember, had the selfe-same countenance of Phylotheta , which made me affect him so much These remembrances, may be assurances that she rather hateth then loueth mee, for otherwise I cannot be perswaded, and then the taske I haue vndertaken ouer-tedious: for it will be in uaine to seeke her loue that regardeth me not. Besides, did she loue me, yet hauing thrust my selfe amongst such a multitude of mine Enemies, that if they knew me would end my life: it is impossible for me to make my Loue knowne to her, yea, or so much as to speake to her: What hope is there then left for me, but to Despaire, or returne to my Parents, seeke to win her possession by force of Armes. Whilest he yet continued in these Meditations, he espyed the King of Armenia comming towards him, to whom he vsed great Reuerence. The King suddenly seeing him, as soone remembred he told him he was of Arabia , which made him vtter these speeches. Well met Honorius , I thinke thou toldest me thou wert of Arabia , and therefore it commeth in my minde, that thou art the onely man mayest pleasure me, if thou wilt vndertake for me, being a matter of small labour, but much importance: Which if thou wilt but vndertake, and with secrecy conceale, thy reward shall be so great as thy heart can wish. My Lord (quoth he) whatsoeuer it be, I will vndertake it, doing my vttermost indeauour therein, with such secrecy and diligence, as you shall like of. I doe both trust and beleeue thee (sayd he) for in thy face I see the sparks of Honour: therefore this it is. There is in my Court a Lady of thy Countrey, named Philotheta , whom I had thought to haue matched with the Emperour Delfurno , but now my Minde is altered, and I purpose to enjoy her my selfe: and for that thou art her Countrey man, I thinke thou mayst preuaile more to perswade her then any other: therefore I haue chosen thee as my Friend, yea my deare friend, to sollicite my sute vnto her: But thou must not be knowne but that thou doest onely speake in the behalfe of Delfurno : for so will I tell him. This is that I would haue thee performe: therefore tell me, art thou Resolued to doe it? Were the Taske farre greater, I would vndertake it, but in this I thinke my selfe exceedingly honoured by your Highnesse, hoping to preuaile so much, that you shall attaine your desire. Then come with me (qd he.) Then did he bring him to Philothetaes Lodging, whether she was newly returning, and vttered these speeches to her. Lady, for that you are a stranger, sollitary, and vnacquainted with the Armenians guise, I haue brought this Knight, not to be your Guardiant, for I make you no prisoner, but to accompany you, and to defend you if any should offer you wrong, whom I hope you will accept of. Philotheta liked his profter well, hoping he would proue a meanes for her to escape by, accepted his proffer with hearty thankes. Of the first Conference betwixt Philotheta and the Knight of the Oracle . being now her Keeper that he so dearely loued, thought himselfe most fortunate, doing humble reuerence to Philotheta : Who demaunded his name. My name sayd he, is Honorius . Then did she demaund whose son he was? for which he had not an answere ready, but stood silent, not caring to be taken in a lye, for that he was vnwilling to maintaine a lye. Phylotheta seeing that, said, I perceiue I shall haue small comfort by thy company, for I see you are not of Arabia . Lady, sayd he, whatsoeuer I am, I rest wholly to doe whatsoeuer you shall commaund me. Then should you not quoth shee, please him that brought you to me, for his minde and mine are quite contrary, else would he not haue trusted you. Admit I did quoth he, yet hauing no intent to doe it, but thereby to enioy your presence, you haue no cause to suspect me. Yet I thinke you are deceyued in his intent, for none but my selfe knoweth it, which I care not to reueale to you, if you will conceale it from him, for I came hither to doe you pleasure, not to further him, Tell it me, quoth shee, and I promise you I will conceale it. Thus it is, whereas hee with great earnestnesse hath sued vnto you in the behalfe of Delfurno , he hath appointed me to be a more earnest solicitor in his behalfe: for that hee himselfe is deeply in loue with you, but hee intendeth that Delfurno shall thinke I am onely imployed to pleasure him. Which when he imparted vnto me, and willingly vndertooke, not to doe it, but to doe you all the humble seruice and duty that I can being neyther of this Court, nor of Arabia , but a Knight of Assiria , that haue vowed neuer to leaue searching vntill I had found you: the occasion whereof was this. Upon a day walking in a Groue, adioyning to the Pallace Garden, I heard a Knight whome afterwards I well knew, making much lamentation for your absence that nothing but newes of your safety could ease his heart. I disclosed my selfe vnto him, and for the loue that I bare him, vowed to trauell in your search, first arriuing in this Court, where to my exceeding ioy I haue found you, with all humility, faith, and constancy, proffering you my seruice, being ready to vndertake any Taske, and vndergoe any perill to doe you seruice, I know not how to trust thee quoth shee, considering thou regardest not to breake thy Word to the King of Armenia , therefore I feare thou wilt doe the like to me: yet if fayre words may deceiue me I shall be deceiued in thine. I would trust thee but I cannot, and yet blame me not, for hauing found no friendshippe nor truth in many, I know not how to trust any. My Fortune was euer yet aduerse, and therefore I am without hope of better: then leaue me for this time, and if you can find in your heart to be true to helpe me, I may hereafter be better aduised to beleiue and imploy you: which words ended, they parted. Of the sorrow that was made in the Assirian campe for the Knight of the Oracles absence. Now let vs returne to speake of Persicles , who missing Montelyon , within short space after his departure, went to his Chamber to seeke him, and from thence, from place to place, but all in vayne, vntill at last he heard newes by a seruant, that there was a knight departed that day at a Posterne gate, armed at euery point. Persicles hearing that, returned to the Emperour, and certified him, and Constantia of his departure: both of them being strooken with sudden griefe, especially Constantias heart was ouercome with such passion, that vntill the time of his returne, shee could neuer shake it off. Newes likewise was brought, that the Emperour of Almaigne was arriued with forty thousand souldiers in ayde of the Kings of Armenia and Macedonia . Then beganne the Emperour of Persia and Persicles to assemble all the Nobility together to determine what to doe. A generall conclusion being agreed vpon, within two dayes to bid them battle. But the Souldiers hearing of Montelyons departure, seemed to haue lost their former courage, and to haue beene without comfort. Of the scret practises of the King of Armenia , and the Emperor of Macedonia to deceiue each other of Phylothetaes loue, which they imparted to Honorius Knight of the Oracle . then they were for his absence: After hee had spent all the Night in sadde meditations, he arose earely with purpose to reueale himselfe and his loue to Philotheta , whatsoeuer ensued thereon: yet fearing eftsoone to disquyet her, he walked downe into a garden, where he had not stayed long, but he was saluted by Delfurno , who came to him of purpose to know if he had yet motioned his sute to Philotheta . Who answered him, that he had had much conference with her the last night about it, and how shee had deferred him for that dayes answere. Thereupon Delfurno promised him great rewards, and he as much fidelity, as being contented with his speeches he departed: He was no sooner gone, but the King of Macedonia came in, whose heart was grounded vpon a new subiect that Montelyon thought not off, for he determined, that none should enioy Philotheta but onely himselfe, and therefore came to make tryall whither this supposed Honorius would condiscend to be ruled by him: which if he would doe, then hee thought to conuey Philotheta secretly into Macedonia , so as neither Delfurnio , nor the King of Armenia should haue any suspect therof, To this effect hee communed with Honorius , first binding him to be secret, then by gifts inticing him, and lastly, dealing by intreaty, vntill he had vttered the depth of his mind, which he promised to effect, vsing such words as pleased the King, wherewith hee went away contented. Whilest Montelyon and the King of Macedonia were thus in conference, the King of Armenia was entring the Garden, but seing them in such discoursing he withdrew himselfe vntil they were departed and then he came in, demanding what good newes he had for him. My Liege, replyed he, the last motion you made to her about her marriage to Delfurno hath hindred your owne for I had much a doe to perswade her that you had any intent at all to loue her, that were so earnest for another: but notwithstanding that, I hope soon to alter her, and bring her to a better liking of your affection. The Emperor hath beene with me already, earnestly soliciting me to prosecute his suite with efficacie. Likewise hath the King of Macedonia , with many promises, desired me to vse what perswasions I could in the Emperours behalfe: but for that by your Maiesty I am so honourably esteemed of, I will trie the vttermost of my skill to pleasure you: I thanke thee good Honorius , quoth he, and I will for thy kindnesse yeeld thee so large a recompence as thy heart can wish. Which said, he departed. What an office haue I vndertaken, said Montelyon , to vndertake to sue for three others, that dare not speake for my selfe, and yet contrary to my liking am enforced to vse it, onely to ridde my selfe from griefe. Yet because the time affordeth me opportunity to worke mine owne weale, I will try whether she doth pitty me or no. How the Knight of the Oracle discouered himselfe to Philotheta : And how by a stratageme hee conuayed her thence in safetie. And what ioy was made for both their safeties. VVhich when he had said, he presently went to Philothetaes Lodging, whom he found in a sad and heauy meditation, but she suddenly espying him comming towards her, turned herselfe from him, refusing to heare him speake, as supposing his speeches would haue tended to perswade her to the loathed liking he had motioned the day before. He seeing her vnwillingnes to heare knew the cause thereof, but yet emboldning himselfe he said. Uertuous Lady, pardon my boldnesse, and withall vouchsafe to heare my speach which shall not offend you: for I haue vowed not to vtter a word contrary to your liking. You will then qd. she, proue perjur'd, for I know your message before you vtter it,  & that wil displease me. No deare Lady, said he, I come not now to aske pitty for an other, but for my selfe, that sometimes haue beene better knowne of you, I am the most vnfortunate Montelyon , that haue aduentured thus farre amongst my Foes to seeke you out, my heart hauing honoured you, euer since my first sight of you in the Hermits Cell in Arabia : Now I desire you to pitty me, for without your fauour I am not my selfe, and in your fauour I shall account my selfe most fortunate. Philotheta noting him, remembred perfectly, it was he, which reuiued her heart with ioy, saying, Most noble knight I account my selfe more then happy, in that you haue me in custody, whose vertuous minde I know will shelter me from dishonour: should I not yeeld you thanks for deeming so well of me, that am not worthy. I might be condemned of rudenesse: therefore most humbly I thanke you, and withall desire you to pitty my estate, that is now rackt vpon the Wheele of dispaire. Deare Lady, said he, I am most willing to doe you seruice, and I desire nothing more then to imploy my selfe to doe you good, for my life is yours, and all that I possesse with it, I humbly prostrate at your sacred feet, Desiring to conuay you hence into Assiria , where your Parents liue in safety, inwardly sorrowfull for your absence. Whether if you will be directed by mee I will conuey you with safety. Sir, replyed Phylotheta , your vertuous kindnesse hath deserued more at my hands then I can yeild thanks for, then how should I behaue my selfe to the thing you desire, which is already fixed in my heart: I will rest so farre to be directed by you, as that my mind shall bee agreeable to yeeld to any request you shall make. Then deare Ladie, said he, I will before to morrow this time, see you safe in my Fathers Court, for much mischiefe is pretended by these Kings of Macedonia and Armenia : both of them haue beene with me this day, and hired me to motion their loues to you, both of them seeking to enioy you, but so as the other shall not know thereof, each seeking to preuent the other, and both of them the Emperour, which they haue reuealed vnto me: but may I haue your licence, I will by that meanes deliuer you from theyr custody. I most humbly desire you to doe it, quoth she, referring my selfe to your good directions, and committing all to your wisedomes election. Which said, Montelyon emboldning himselfe gaue and receyued so sweete a kisse, as seemed to breath forth a sweet exchange of each others Soules. Hee going to find out the King of Armenia , and shee into her priuate chamber. Montelyon hauing found out the King of Armenia , tolde him how that the King of Macedonia went about to conuay Philotheta from thence, rehearsing all the conference that had past betwixt them: and withall, quoth he, the Emperour was with me this day, promising me great rewards, if I would doe the like for him. Now my Lord, my loue and duty to you, bindeth me onely to doe you seruice, and I haue vowed that my best endeuours shall be imployed onely to your good liking. The King hearing that both of them went about to deceiue him raged exceedingly, but trusting his Fidelity, he was quieted: asking what he should doe to preuent them both. My deare Lord (quoth he) this Euening you may effect your desire, or els neuer: at which time, giue me but directions, whether I may conuey her to a place of security, or where we may meete you, and I will aduenture my life, but I will doe it: and by this meanes you shall deliuer your Signet vnto me, for our quyet passage foorth at the Citie Gate, and then may we meete you where you will appoynt vs. And that shall be quoth he at Fryer Barnards Cell without the Citie, if you know it, and there is my Signet. Thither will I conuay her (quoth he) at twelue a Clocke. Farewell then (quoth the King) be but Faithfull, and thou shalt find my friendship such, as shall highly reward thy paines. Montelyon hauing effected this, presently went to the King of Macedonia , telling him how the Emperours importunacie was such, that it was high time, (either then, or neuer) to conuay Phylotheta thence, whom he found willing to yeeld thereunto. Hee hearing that, desired his counsell, promising well to reward him, intreating him to doe it for him, and both himself and his Kingdome should be at his commaund. Deliuer me (quoth Montelyon ) your Signet for my Passe, and appoint the place and Time, and I will bring her thither. There is my Signet (quoth hee) the place, at Fryer Barnards Cell, and the time, one of the Clocke. After many other speeches they parted. Montelyon without stay went to the Emperour, with submisse behauiour, telling him how that Philotheta did greatly affect him, and had sent him to make an humble request vnto him: which was, that we might be conuayed in secresie from the Campe, for that manie dangers did inuirone her in that place, and that of such importance, as did concerne his life, whereon her safety depended: which for that they were of weight, she would reueale to none but himselfe, desiring him not to come to her, for that his person might thereby be indangered. Delfurno hearing this, was exceedingly troubled in his minde, yet glad to heare that she esteemed him, said: Honorius , I would as gladly effect any thing to content her, as I would to saue mine owne life, yet doe I not know how, vnlesse by thy directions: therefore doe but counsell me, and I will yeeld to that which thou shalt aduise. My noble Lord, quoth he, the safest way is, this night secretly to conuay her through the gate where your Souldiers lye, and I will bring her to Fryer Barnards Cell, about eleuen of the Clocke, where you may be ready to receiue her, and with a sufficient Guard of Knights to convay her into Almaigne , or any place of security. Moreouer, my Lord, she willed me to assure you, that both the king of Armenia and Macedonia , hauing disloyally forgotten their promise to you, seeke to win her loue to themselues, which dishonour she cannot endure to be done against you. Delfurno was much grieued to heare that, yet hoping to preuent them both, hee quieted himselfe, deliuering his Signet to Montelyon , with many thankes and much intreaty, desiring him to be carefull, that nothing might preuent their purpose. Montelyon being glad of this, thought not so to end, but presently went to the Queene of Macedonia , telling her the Kings complot, for conuaying of Philotheta thence, shewing her his Signet: which when shee beheld, exceeding griefe possest her heart, to thinke of his disloyalty. Montelyon seeing that, said. Notwithstanding, hee hath attempted this, I know the Ladyes vertues to be such, as shee will rather suffer the extreamest misery in the world, then yeeld thereto: and for my self, though hee hath promised me great rewards, I respect more mine owne honour, then to be the agent in so wicked an Act, therefore to assure, that I entend it not, I yeeld you his Signet, whereby I should haue past the Campe, to meete at Bernards Cell. I thanke thee gentle Knight quoth shee: and for this deede commaund me any thing, and thou shalt obtaine it. My selfe will meete him there, and by that meanes. I hope to make him giue ouer the like attempts. Montelyon being gone from her, went to the Queene of Armenia , telling her the like, and indeed the truth of her Lord, both deliuering her his Signet and all other directions for her to meete him by: leauing her so mad with rage and iealousie, that she was ready to teare her hayre: yea euen with bitter exclaime, to reueale her minde but that she referred it vntill she might surprize him with a guilty conscience at Barnards Cell. By this time it grewe so be night, and after supper, was ended, both Delfurno , the King of Armenia , and of Macedonia , making more then wonted haste to breake companie, each being glad that the other was so willing to part, which the two Queenes noted, as priuie to theyr drifts. Montelyon likewise got him to Philotheta , telling her, that he had so preuailed with Delfurno , that he had gotten his Signet, as their warrant to passe through the Campe, entreating her to bee in a readinesse to goe with him, desiring her to feare no daunger, for his life should shield her. She granted to goe with him, desiring him to stay there, vntill the time appoynted which hee performed, passing the time in priuate conference with her, to both their likings. The time being come, and all things silent, Montelyon armed himselfe, leading Philotheta out of the Court, passing all the guards, watches, and garrisons, by shewing the Emperours Signet, and comming where the Souldiers lay, they likewise let him goe, vntill they were without the Citie gates. Montelyon hauing without daunger effected this, turned his steppes directly towards his owne City, which was not farre off, and therefore with ease they gate thither. Being come to the Citie gates, the watch espying them, demanded who was there. Montelyon bad them come downe and see: they came downe and tooke them in, beginning to examine them: but Montelyon discouered himselfe as loath to stay there, yet commanding them to conceale it, and to carry him as a prisoner to Delatus which they performed, where they knocked, and were let in. Delatus and Alsala knowing him, did him humble reuerence, reioycing in their hearts to see him so safely returned. But Montelyon vnuailing Philotheta, Alsala presently knew her, with teares of ioy welcomming her, whilest the old Duke melted with passion to behold his Daughter, whom from her infancy he had not seene: embracing her in his armes, and a thousand times kissing her tender cheeke. These embracings being past, Montelyon sayd, Lady, since you are now in safety with your parents, my promise is performed, desiring you to haue regard to the passions I endure, which time will not now permit me to vtter, but leaue to your courteous consideration: therfore I beseech you in mine absence, let my loyalty be regarded, and your gentle heart willing to pitty me. Which said, with a second kisse he left her, to submit himselfe to his parents. Of the discord that befell betwixt the Emperour of Almaigne , the Emperour of Macedonia , and the King of Armenia , about Philothetaes departure. Of a merry iest that befell the two Ladyes. Aud of the desolation of the Armenian Hoast. First the Emperour chusing vnto him some few trusty Knights that he meant should conuay Phylotheta into Almaigne , secretly went vnto Bernards Cell, where he shrowded himselfe vnder a tuft of Cipresse trees, staying the comming of Phylotheta , but it was an houre before any came, and the first was the Qu. of Macedonia , who attended by one Gentleman, came towards the Cell, whom when Delfurno beheld, he alone stept vnto her, saying. My deare Philotheta , I am sorry that for my sake you should take such paines as at this vnseasonable time to be abroad, for which I render all the thanks that a constant heart can. She hearing that, taking him to be her Lord, yeelded him many thanks, purposing to try the vttermost conclusion, before she reuealed her selfe saying: Had I not assured my selfe of your Loue, I would not haue come hither: but being here, I rest at your disposition: Delfurno then embraced her oft times kissing her, and being of a quicke conceit, presently bethought himselfe if she would condiscend, to call vp the Fryer and be married. Lady (qd. he) since you haue vouchsafed to grant me Loue, enrich me also with possession, which the more lawfully to effect, we will be marryed by Fryer Bernard . My L. replyed she, I am contented: then did he call at the Fryers Cell, who arising, Delfurno taking him aside, told him what he was, and the cause of his comming: who hearing that, presently ioyned their hands. Delfurno then purposed not to conuey her thence, but returne to the Campe, which he performed. They were no sooner gone, but the K. of Macedonia commeth to the Cell, and ere he could turne him about, the Q. of Armenia , according to Montelyons directions, came thither. The King himselfe taking her for Philotheta , at the first meeting embraced her with a sweet Congee , vttering many speeches to the setting foorth of his loue, which she answered as kindly, that he grew so bold, as he would haue had present possession of her loue, but she denyed that, alleadging that he had a Queene, who hearing of his Loue to her, would seeke her death. Feare not that, deare Loue, qd. he, for ere long I meane to make her sure enough for euer troubling of you, therefore deny me not, but yeild me the fruition of thy loue, I will not, qd. she without further assurance, for my mind presageth some ill. Here is, qd. he, a Fryer hard by, will you consent that he shall marry vs? To that she agreed, and he called vp the Fryer the second time, who much maruelling thereat, demanded the cause of his comming. Fryer, quoth he, the cause of my comming is to be marryed to this Lady, therefore I pray thee doe it without delay. The Fryer thinking that some mad spirits were abroad, or that some franticke dreame had ouercome his sences, without asking any more questions marryed them, and sent them away. The King of Macedonia , carryed her into his Tent in the field, for that he durst not goe to the Pallace, for feare of his wife, where he stayed with her all night. Last of all the K. of Armenia , premeditating what speeches to vse to set forth his loue, resting himselfe vpon a banks side, hard by Bernards Cell, staying their comming the space of an houre, with great patience, but when an houre was past  & then another, & a third neare ended, he waxed impatient, fearing to be disappointed, but seeing they came not, at last he misdoubted he had mistaken the time, and stayed too long, that being much troubled he knockt at Bernards Cell, who started from his Bed, as one affrighted, wondring what accident had driuen so many to his Cell that night. And comming to the doore, the K. of Armenia demanded, if there had bin a Lady that night. Yes, qd. he, here hath bin two, but what they were I know not. It was assuredly Phylotheta , and with her Delfurno , to whom I marryed her: but what the other two were I know not: The King hearing that, in a rage ran backe to the K. of Macedoniaes tent, desiring to speake with him, the Guard knowing him, let him in, and he standing by his beds side, sayd. Brother of Macedon , the lady whom we determined to marry to Delfurno is this Night fled, and for that deed we shall loose his friendship for euer. The K. of Macedonia hearing that, lay as one halfe amazed, not knowing what to say, and the Q. hearing her husband there. whom she thought she had embraced, trembled with feare. The K. of Macedonia seeing there was no remedy, but that his deed must of necessity be discouered, sayd, King of Armenia , it is so, I haue Phylotheta in my custody, and her I will enjoy, for she lyeth folded in mine armes. By heauen qd. the K. of Armenia , thy life shall not satisfie the dishonour thou hast done vs. With that he drew his sword, and he starting from his bed to reach his to defend himselfe, in which time the K. of Armenia catching hold on her as she lay, drew her foorth into the floore, where beholding her he was then much more enraged, being ready to kill her, but that the K. of Macedonia preuented him: who likewise seeing her, stood as one amazed, whilest she hasted to apparell her selfe, and ran from thence vnto the Pallace. The King of Armenia vowing reuenge, went from the Macedonian Tent, and presently caused his Drum to strike vp alarum, and commanded his Souldiers to destroy the Macedonians , who according to his command, suddenly set vpon them, that there began an exceeding slaughter amongst them. The Emperor hauing newes thereof, supposing the cause had bin for the losse of Phylotheta , commanded 2. of his Knights to go vnto eyther of them, and desire them to be pacified vntill they had discouered their griefes to him, which he could easily remedy, if not he would become a friend to one of them. The Messengers found them both together in single combat, & deliuered their Message, but it was long before eyther of them would goe to him, yet at last they went both: To whom Delfurno sayd: My Lords, I beleeue your strife ariseth from the losse of Philotheta , if that be the cause contend no longer, for as you were both willing I should enjoy her, so I haue this night had possession of her loue, being lawfully married vnto me at Bernards Cell. The King of Armenia what with rage and jealousie, not well knowing what he did, drew the Curtaines, and discouered their viewes, the Queene of Macedonia , who seeing her Honour so betrayed, lay quite bereft of sence, but comming againe to her selfe she cryed out for pardon, alleadging she was betrayed: but there was now no time of parley, for all of them were enraged, and as well Delfurno as the rest, betooke themselues to Armes. But the Queene of Macedonia humbling her selfe at her husbands feet. sayd: Both you, my selfe, and all of vs are deceiued: Honorius yesternight declared vnto me, that you intended priuily to carry Phylotheta from hence. I requested him to counsell me how to preuent you, whereupon he told me, that you had appointed to meet with him and her at Bernards Cell, and for his Passe he had receiued your signet, which at my earnest intreaty he deliuered me, I thinking to surprize you there, came thither, where the Emperour as I now perceiue met me whom I tooke to be your selfe, and he taking me to be Philotheta , that went to Bernards Cell, I still concealed my self, thinking I had not offended, but now I see I am betrayed. Lady qd. he, I willingly pardon this fault, hauing committed the same with the Q. of Armenia , & in the same manner deceiued by Honorius . The Emp. hearing that, sent a Messenger to see if Philotheta were in the Court, but he returned Newes, that both she and Honorius were not to be found, The Emperour then sayd, that Knight hath deceiued vs all, therefore let vs be friends. Contented qd. the King of Macedonia . By heauen qd. the King of Armenia , I will not beare this dishonour, but be reuenged to the full, and cause thee repent that euer thou offeredst such dishonour to Armenia . The K. of Macedonia could not brooke his words, but in a rage made this reply. I know, qd. he, thou art a tyrant, and regardest not the lawes humaine nor diuine, as may be seene by the vniust title thou layest to the Crowne of Assyria , which is forged, and were it not to reuenge my Daughters dishonor & Sons death, I would not haue offered armes against that worthy King. Therefore since thou art so peremptory, do thy worst, for I regard thee not. The K. of Armenia went from thence setting vpon the Macedonians . And the K. of Macedonia forsooke his Tents to defend himselfe. The Emp. presently commanded his Forces to march forth of the City. How the Knight of the Oracle and Persicles , suddenly issuing out, destroyed the whole Armenian Hoast. policie, after he had submitted himselfe to his Parents and the Emperor, he armed himselfe in the armour which was giuen him by the Hesperian Nymphs ,  & presently mounted himselfe leading his sixety thousand Souldiers foorth of the City, which likewise he performed before the Emperor or Persicles heard thereof: who at last being certified, sent for him to know the cause: this night qd. he, shall we surprize our Enemies, who are now together by the eares within themselues. Persicles thereupon armed himselfe, and Deloratus, Pisor, Cothanes , & many other Knights of great esteeme marching thitherwards, where they heard such cruell alarums, as though the City had bin vtterly destroyed. And being come neere the City, they beheld the Emperor in the field, to whom Persicles sent a Herald, to certiffe him that Persicles was neuer foe to the Almaigns and therefore sent to know if Delfurno had any quarrel against him. Delfurno returned answer, that he was neuer Foe to Persicles. Montelyon was the first that entred the City, and set vpon his Enemies with such fury, that many of them lost their liues, and the day being light, discouered such a cruell slaughter as eye hath not beheld. The K. of Armenia and Macedonia were then in cruell combat together, betwixt whom, Montelyon stept, saying: Striue not to destroy one another, but defend your selues, for I am come to doe that. They knowyng him to be the Knight of the Oracle , were so amazed, as if they had beene surprised with a sudden trance, running seueral wayes to call backe their Souldiers from destroying one another, to defend themselues: but before they could set themselues in any good order, the Assyrians were so intermingled amongst them, that before they were aware they lost their liues. Palian seeing themselues so ouertaken, perceiued it was in vaine to striue for victory, stole forth of the City to Delfurno , intreating him not to forsake them: but he knowing disaduantage had seized on them, refused, letting him returne without comfort, & entring into the City, he found his father grieuously wounded and ready to yeeld to Montelyons sword, at whom he ran with such fury, that he wounded him in the thigh: Montelyon seeing that and knowing him, let driue at him with great courage, & continued cobat against him, whilest the K. of Armenia began to withdraw himselfe, Montelyon seeing that, strooke so forcible a blow at Palian , that he astonisht him, and with that ouertooke the King, at the first blow cutting in sunder his wrist which had lost his Gauntlet, & at the next thrusting his Sword quite through his body. Palian by this recouered himselfe, & looking about him, beheld his fathers tragedy, ayming himselfe to reuenge. Montelyon seeing him comming welcomed him with so cruell a blow, that his Armour flew in pieces. Palian would haue done the like, had not Montelyons Armour beene of vnwonted strength. But in the end he fled, finding himselfe too weake to resist him. Persicles and Deloratus all this while ranged vp and downe, destroying such as they met, vntill at last they encountred the King of Macedonia , and his two sons, accompanied with 4. other Knights of Macedonia that made exceeding slaughter where they went. Persicles ran at the King, and in the encounter ouerthrew him, but his eldest sonne stept to his rescue, and with an vnlucky blow wounded Persicles on the thigh: then began an vnequall combat betwixt them for those sixe set upon Persicles and Deloratus , who continued Combat against them by the space of an houre, till both sides were grieuously wounded, especially Persicles & Deloratus had bled so much, that they were ready to faint. Montelyon came most fortunately to their rescue, who espying his Father and Deloratus in such danger, was so inraged, that he ran at one of them with such force, that he slew him, and within few blows, left another bereft of sence, and offending a third with such puissant blowes, that he could not tell, whether he might stay or run away. An other seeing that, joyned himselfe in combat with him, continuing it but a short space, for he was soone so sore wounded, that he was not able to resist Persicles being sore wounded before, yet so valiantly behaued himselfe, that one of them lay dead at his feet, and the other fled from Montelyon : then began a desolation in the Hoast, for the Armenians cryed flye, flye, and the other kill, that of a sudden the massacre was so hote, that the Chanels of the City, began to run with bloud, and none could hardly ride or passe on foot for dead carkasses. Then began the Citizens to run on heapes, the two Queenes betooke themselues to flight with Praxentia , but were taken by Pisor. Palian was taken prisoner by Deloratus , and the King of Macedonia , and his two sonnes by Persicles and Montelyon . The souldiers that were left, fled forth of the City and hid themselues in the fields, and the Citizens, so many as could escape the sword, vpon their knees intreated Persicles to spare their liues, who yeelded vpon condition they would pay to euery common Souldier a 100. Crowns and to euery Leader 500. which they performed. Persicles then sounded retreat, and drew his Forces out of the City, appointing Garisons to keep the same to his vse. Delfurno at his return met him, and offered to conclude a league of amity with him, which he kindly accepted, riding together to the City of Pisos , where they were receiued with exceeding ioy, especially Montelyon to whom all men attributed the glory of that victory. After this victory atchieued, to the great and exceeding applaud of Montelyon. Persicles caused all the dead bodyes to be buryed, those that yeelded to be pardoned, the maymed to bee carryed to Hospitals to be cured, and euery Souldier to be sent away well rewarded, and highly contented. And within few dayes after the Emperours
