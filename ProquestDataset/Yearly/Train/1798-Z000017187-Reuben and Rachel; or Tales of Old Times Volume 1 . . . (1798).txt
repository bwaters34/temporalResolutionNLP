It is therefore an irk[s]ome ta[s]k to be obliged to write, what will neither call up the attention, nor intere[s]t the feelings of tho[s]e who may peru[s]e the book; and yet, irk[s]ome as the ta[s]k is, I find my[s]elf nece[s][s]itated to perform it. I am con[s]cious that [s]ome apology ought to be made to the public, for the length of time that has intervened [s]ince I fir[s]t awakened their curio[s]ity by announcing my intention of publishing the pre[s]ent work. In excu[s]e for this tardine[s]s, I mu[s]t allege [s]everal months of ill health, during which time I was incapable of pur[s]uing my favourite amu[s]ement of writing; and [s]ince my health has been re-e[s]tabli[s]hed, an avocation of a more [s]erious nature has employed every hour, and almo[s]t ab[s]orbed every faculty of my mind. When I fir[s]t [s]tarted the idea of writing " Tales of Old Times ," it was with a fervent wi[s]h to awaken in the minds of my young readers, a curio[s]ity that might lead them to the attentive peru[s]al of hi[s]tory in general, but more e[s]pecially the hi[s]tory of their native country. It has ever been my opinion, that when instruction is blended with amu[s]ement, the youthful mind receives and retains it almo[s]t involuntarily. The fir[s]t volume of the pre[s]ent work was written before I had entered on the arduous (though inexpre[s][s]ibly delightful) ta[s]k of cultivating the minds and expanding the ideas of the female part of the ri[s]ing generation. If I was before careful to avoid every expre[s][s]ion or [s]entiment that might mi[s]lead the judgment, or corrupt the heart, what was then inclination became now an indi[s]pen[s]able duty. And though none of my characters are [s]o very [s]aultle[s]s as to occa[s]ion the young reader to neglect imitating them at all, becau[s]e they de[s]pair of attaining the [s]ame degree of perfection, yet they di[s]cover [s]uch an innate love of virtue, [s]uch [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-009.jpg) \- external link  - Page iv. ] a thorough contempt of vice, that the uncontaminated mind will contemplate with plea[s]ure the beauty of the one, and [s]hrink with abhorrence from the deformity of the other. As a noveli[s]t, I think it is more than probable that I have made my la[s]t e[s][s]ay. Flattered and encouraged as I am in my pre[s]ent undertaking, in having the education of [s]o many young ladies entru[s]ted to my care by their re[s]pectable parents, it [s]hall henceforward be my [s]tudy con[s]cientiou[s]ly to di[s]charge the tru[s]t repo[s]ed in me; and whil[s]t I endeavour to cultivate their ta[s]te, and improve their under[s]tandings, implant, with the utmo[s]t solicitude, in their innocent minds, a love for piety and virtue. To this end, I [s]hall devote my lei[s]ure hours to preparing a [s]et of progre[s][s]ive le[s][s]ons in reading, for the youth of my own [s]ex; from five years old to ten or twelve; after which period, there are a multiplicity of books, better calculated to forward the great de[s]ign of education than any my pen could produce: It is ob[s]ervable, that the generality of books intended for children are written for boys: even Mrs. Barbauld's Le[s][s]ons, which are the be[s]t productions of the kind I ever met with, are addre[s][s]ed to a boy. And as for the generality of little books which children are permitted to read, they are [s]uch a jumble of incon[s]i[s]tencies, that though they may a[s][s]i[s]t the child to learn to read with propriety, they do not convey one idea to the head that is worth retaining. Mrs. Trimmer, and [s]ome few others, are exceptions to this remark, having laboured to correct this fal[s]e idea, that it was nece[s][s]ary to excite the young mind to the pur[s]uit of learning by tales wonderful and indeed impo[s][s]ible, and have di[s]played to their view the real wonders and beauties of nature. For my own [s]ex only I pre[s]ume to write; and if hereafter one woman [s]hould think her[s]elf happier or wi[s]er from the fruits of my endeavours, I [s]hall be overpaid for the time or pains bestowed in writing and arranging them. An old fa[s]hioned Widow. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page 001. ] It was about the middle of the fifteenth century that the lovely and amiable I[s]abelle found her[s]elf a widow, reduced from ea[s]e and affluence to a very confined income. Though her circum[s]tances were altered; her mind elevated, her [s]pirit noble and independent, was [s]till the [s]ame. I[s]abelle was a native of Spain, of noble parentage, expanded heart, [s]uperior [s]en[s]e, and highly fini[s]hed education. The beauty and elegance of her per[s]on, though [s]triking, were but [s]econdary objects of the e[s]teem and admiration [s]he was [s]ure to excite wherever [s]he was [s]een or known. In the prime of life, having [s]carcely reached her 35th year, [s]uddenly deprived of a valuable and beloved hu[s]band, [s]he retired from a court of which [s]he had been a principal ornament, to a ca[s]tle romantically [s]ituated on the borders of Wales. Among[s]t her hu[s]band's va[s]t po[s][s]e[s][s]ions, this only had e[s]caped the rapacious hand of his enemies. It was an antique ca[s]tle which formerly had been de[s]igned for defence, as well as a habitation; but the fortre[s]s had been for many years totally neglected, and the ca[s]tle it[s]elf, in many places, was fallen to decay. The ground belonging to it con[s]i[s]ted of but a few acres, and tho[s]e few were uncultivated and rude; a few clumps of old oaks were here and there [s]cattered on the [s]ides of the hill, on the [s]ummit of which the ca[s]tle [s]tood; and immediately [s]urrounding it, was a [s]mall patch which once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] had been u[s]ed as a kitchen garden. The very trifling value annexed to this [s]mall deme[s]ne and its retired solitary [s]ituation, made it no object to the enemies of Arundel; and thither I[s]abelle, with her only child Columbia, retired. An old female [s]ervant, a native of South-America, who[s]e name was Cora, and Matthias, a veteran [s]oldier who had grown old in the [s]ervice of her hu[s]band's father, with a lively little girl particularly attached to Columbia, compri[s]ed the whole of her hou[s]ehold. Mina was the daughter of a pea[s]ant in the neighbourhood of London. The little Columbia, when quite a child, walking with her maid on the banks of the Thames, [s]aw Mina gathering [s]ome dry [s]ticks, which [s]he carefully tied in a bundle, and, dropping a curte[s]y as Columbia pa[s][s]ed, cried, "Ble[s]s you, [s]weet little lady." Mina was ju[s]t nine years of age, her complexion clear olive, a profu[s]ion of jetty hair waved in glossy ringlets over her neck, and partly [s]haded her expressive countenance; her full black eyes beamed unutterable [s]oftne[s]s, as taking up her bundle of [s]ticks [s]he gazed after Columbia, and cried, "Ble[s]s you, my [s]weet little lady!" And "ble[s]s you, my pretty girl," [s]aid Columbia; "why do you carry that heavy bundle?" "'Tis wood to make a fire for mammy who is [s]ick." "Where does your mammy live?" "There, in that little cottage by the road [s]ide." Columbia, though not eight years old, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a heart glowing with the [s]tronge[s]t feelings of humanity; [s]he darted forward, and in a moment was at the door of Mina's cottage. "You mu[s]t not go in, Mi[s]s," [s]aid the [s]ervant; "if the woman [s]hould be [s]ick of any contagious di[s]order, and you [s]hould catch it, what would my lady [s]ay?" "What would [s]he [s]ay (replied the child) if I pa[s][s]ed by the hou[s]e without inquiring what ailed the poor woman? I will go in, and then I can tell my mother, who will, I am [s]ure, give me [s]ome money to bring to her to-morrow." Opposition was u[s]ele[s]s; the benevolent child entered the cottage, and beheld a [s]cene of mi[s]ery, which, though [s]he did not fully comprehend, [s]he on her return home [s]ufficiently explained to her mother, to obtain [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] immediate relief for the poor cottager; and Mina was taken into the family and promoted to the honour of waiting entirely on her little benefactre[s]s. When the lady I[s]abelle retired to Au[s]tenbury Ca[s]tle, Columbia was eleven years old. It was her mother's chief amu[s]ement to cultivate an under[s]tanding naturally good, but where [s]ometimes the [s]hoots of female vanity impeded the progre[s]s of tho[s]e virtues, which nature with a liberal hand had implanted in her heart. Remarkably lovely in her per[s]on, [s]he would frequently decorate her hair with field flowers, at the [s]ame time placing garlands of them in fanta[s]tic drapery about her dre[s]s; and then, having admired her[s]elf in the natural ba[s]on, which ornamented their little garden, fly to her mother, and exclaim with tran[s]port, "Only [s]ee how beautiful!" When Mina, who thought her young mi[s]tre[s]s almo[s]t a divinity, would rapturou[s]ly cry, "Don't [s]he, my lady, look like an angel?" I[s]abelle, though delighted to ob[s]erve the unbounded vivacity of her daughter, and the grateful affection of her little dependant, was fully [s]en[s]ible of the nece[s][s]ity there was for checking tho[s]e ebullitions of vanity, which, if [s]uffered to pa[s]s unnoticed, would effectually throw a [s]hade over the really valuable qualities of good [s]en[s]e, good nature, and benevolence, with which the [s]oul of her daughter was amply [s]tored. Her reflections on this [s]ubject were often painful in the extreme. Secluded from the world, [s]he had no friend with whom [s]he could advi[s]e. Severity ([s]he would [s]ay within herself) will but teach my child to con[s]ider me as a frigid monitre[s]s, her heart will contract and hide its thoughts from an eye that beams only with reproach! No; I mu[s]t watch the favourable moment, and effectually eradicate this error, by convincing her under[s]tanding of its folly. I would be the guardian of my child's morals; I would be her friend, and direct her in the way mo[s]t likely to [s]ecure her pre[s]ent and future happiness; but for the univer[s]e I would not forfeit the exqui[s]ite plea[s]ure of participating every thought, every wi[s]h of her innocent heart.---No; let me not, by ill timed har[s]hne[s]s, drive her guilele[s]s and un[s]u[s]pecting nature [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] to mean [s]ubterfuge and artifice; had [s]he a thou[s]and errors, [s]he is [s]till my child, and though it is my duty to correct, it is al[s]o my duty to conceal and palliate faults, which reflection tells me, are but the offspring of human nature. It was ever the care of I[s]abelle to impre[s]s on the mind of her daughter a proper [s]en[s]e of a wi[s]e, benignant, overruling Power; to whom [s]he was indebted for her being, and to whom [s]he was accountable for her words and actions; but this was done more by example than precept. Calumny was a [s]tranger to her lips; to perform every good work of peace and mercy was the delight of her heart. She wor[s]hipped her Creator with [s]incerity and fervor; no appointed hour, no [s]et form of prayer; every ble[s][s]ing was received with thankfulne[s]s, every correction [s]ubmitted to with patience. Among[s]t the mo[s]t heinous offences [s]he reckoned the mi[s]u[s]e or neglect of time, and the total abu[s]e or perver[s]ion of God's good gifts. Every hour of her life was u[s]efully employed, and [s]he dealt by every human being, as [s]he wi[s]hed them to deal by her. It was a fine evening in the middle of September, when Columbia a[s]ked her mother to partake of [s]ome fruit in a neat arbour Matthias had dre[s][s]ed by the [s]ide of the pond. "You forget, my dear mother, ([s]aid [s]he) that this is the day I always devote to joy and playfulness. This is the day on which you relieved poor Mina's mother, and brought that good girl home to live with me; and [s]he has been [s]o affectionate, [s]o grateful, that to-day I am determined [s]he [s]hall be queen of the fea[s]t. You do not know how charming it will be! Matthias has got us [s]ome peaches, and Cora has provided cream, with baked apples and wheat cakes; and whil[s]t you refre[s]h your[s]elf, Mina and I will [s]ing and dance to divert you." I[s]abelle cla[s]ped the intere[s]ting child in her arms, and repaired to the appointed [s]cene of infantile fe[s]tivity. After the collation was over, at which Mina was made to pre[s]ide, Columbia told her mother, that [s]he could never repay the plea[s]ure her fir[s]t acquaintance with that little girl had given her; "For," [s]aid [s]he, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] "before I [s]aw her di[s]tre[s]s, and you, my beloved mother, gave me the means to relieve it, I had no idea of happine[s]s beyond my[s]elf; but that ble[s][s]ed day taught me, that to confer happine[s]s on another, gave the mind [s]en[s]ations a thou[s]and times more exqui[s]ite than any other enjoyment the world affords." She then, with the [s]wiftne[s]s and light bound of an antelope, [s]prang from her mother's embrace, and ran toward the ca[s]tle; but [s]oon returned with Mina, decorated in all the finery they could put together. The jetty hair of Mina hung loo[s]e and unadorned about her neck and [s]houlders, whil[s]t her little white jacket and petticoat were richly ornamented with orange lilies, poppies and blue iris. The fine auburn tre[s][s]es of Columbia were bound up with a garland of corn flowers, and autumnal dai[s]ies, who[s]e glowing tints vied with the colour, whil[s]t the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of their becoming effect gave an additional brilliancy to her eyes. Her dre[s]s, which was compo[s]ed of light grey [s]atin, [s]he had lightly and elegantly ornamented with fe[s]toons of oak leaves, who[s]e dark native green was at this period of the year enlivened by the bright yellow, and glowing [s]carlet hue, they had caught from the chilly breath of autumn. Light as the go[s][s]amer they bound over the turf, dancing to the notes of their own harmonious voices. The evening was [s]erene; the glowing [s]un ju[s]t touched with his broad di[s]k the we[s]tern ocean, whil[s]t as he [s]unk beneath the [s]hades of night, the moon, emerging from her watry bed, reflected his departing beams, and tinged the cold ea[s]tern [s]ky with [s]affron hue, whil[s]t here and there a [s]cattered cloud, dark in it[s]elf, caught her pale rays, and brightened by degrees to high-wrought [s]ilver. Fatigued with the exerci[s]e of dancing, Columbia pau[s]ed upon the margin of the [s]tream; its [s]urface was [s]mooth and even as the poli[s]hed mirror;---her elegant form, becoming dre[s]s, and angel countenance were reflected in the water. She [s]topped and gazed. A beam of exultation [s]hot from her eyes. It was the moment I[s]abelle had [s]o long wi[s]hed for. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] "And what does my child [s]o intently gaze at?" ([s]aid [s]he, approaching her daughter.) Mina [s]tood at a little di[s]tance; her own beauty was to her[s]elf unknown, her whole [s]oul was wrapt in admiring the beauty of her young lady. When the lady I[s]abelle [s]poke, [s]he drew near and li[s]tened with attention. She loved her with grateful affection, and instruction from her lips [s]unk directly to her heart. "And what does my child [s]o intently gaze at?" [s]aid I[s]abelle, "is it the lovely form with which nature has bountifully endowed her; and which the unruffled [s]urface of the water [s]o beautifully reflects to her admiring eyes? Alas, my child, if that is the object of your admiration, how fragile is the plea[s]ure you receive! What is it you contemplate? A [s]hadow; nay, le[s]s than a [s]hadow; for beauty it[s]elf is but a [s]hadow, [s]carce [s]een before it is gone; and that fair [s]emblance you there behold is but the [s]hadow of a [s]hade. Behold, my child," continued [s]he, throwing [s]omething into the water, "[s]ee that beauteous figure, how deformed, how di[s]gu[s]ting; every trait of loveline[s]s is gone." Columbia turned from the [s]tream with an involuntary [s]hudder. I[s]abelle continued---"Or [s]ee, my love, the[s]e flowers, with which but a few hours [s]ince you decorated your hair; they were then fresh-blooming and beautiful beyond de[s]cription; behold them now! their [s]weets are all exhaled, their vivid tints are flown, and no longer valuable, you would throw them from you with neglect and abhorrence. Even [s]o, my dear Columbia, is it with the frail beauty which you [s]o ardently admire. One breath from the creative Power that gave you being, might level you with the du[s]t. Sickne[s]s, misfortune, poverty, might deprive your eyes of their lu[s]tre, your [s]kin of its glo[s][s]y hue, and [s]teal the luxuriant tre[s][s]es from your head. Nay, even at this moment, the cold hand of death might [s]ink you into nothing; and tho[s]e who to-day looked at you with admiration, would to-morrow turn from you with di[s]gu[s]t and terror. Like the[s]e poor flowers you would be thrown upon the earth, be trod under foot and forgotten." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] Mina, dropping her garland on the ground, [s]eized her young lady by the arm, as though [s]he would [s]ave her from [s]o di[s]graceful an end. Columbia looked at her with affection, gently freed her[s]elf from her gra[s]p, and, looking at the faded flowers, with eyes [s]treaming with tears a[s]ked her mother, "Am I, then, of no more con[s]equence than the[s]e flowers, and may I be as ea[s]ily de[s]troyed? Shall I be as [s]oon reduced to nothing?" "No, my beloved girl, ([s]aid I[s]abelle) you are of a thou[s]and times more value than the faire[s]t flower that ever bloomed, or the riche[s]t gem that ever decked the brow of royalty. Look round, my love, behold this va[s]t, this glorious univer[s]e; what beauty, what order! How does the mind expand with wonder and delight as we contemplate the fields of ripened grain, the loaded fruit trees, verdant plains and maje[s]tic mountains, who[s]e [s]ummits [s]eem to ki[s]s the face of heaven. Observe how grand, how [s]trikingly [s]ublime, appears the orb of day, ju[s]t [s]inking in the we[s]tern [s]ky, which flames with crim[s]on, burni[s]hed gold and purple; and [s]ee, as he retires, the placid moon a[s][s]umes her [s]ilent reign, whil[s]t millions of [s]tars compo[s]e her [s]plendid train, and glitter in the va[s]t expan[s]e of ether. Stupendous, great and wonderful as the[s]e appear, believe me, my child, one pure, virtuous human [s]oul is of more value in the [s]ight of the Creator, than all that you behold. They [s]hall fade away, [s]hall vani[s]h as a dream, and be no more remembered; but the [s]oul, [s]tudious to perform its duty, beneficent to its fellow creatures, and glowing with grateful, humble affection to the great Fir[s]t Cau[s]e of all, [s]hall [s]tand [s]ecure amid the general ruin, and ri[s]e triumphant from a [s]inking world." Thus did I[s]abelle endeavour to in[s]pire her daughter with a thorough contempt for all frivolous pur[s]uits, and to give her a ju[s]t [s]en[s]e of the value of mental acquirements. From this time [s]he fully comprehended of how much more con[s]equence was the embelli[s]hing of the mind, than the trifling decorations of the person. Be[s]ides, having been informed of the immortality of the [s]oul, [s]he was anxious in inquiry for the means by which [s]o invaluable a ble[s][s]ing might be pre[s]erved; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] and to hint to her the danger of forfeiting [s]o great a privilege, was always [s]ufficient to deter her from any thing that was wrong. It cannot be imagined that a woman like I[s]abelle could pa[s]s at once from the court to the cottage, and be [s]uffered to glide unnoticed into ob[s]curity. Among[s]t the friends and intimates of her days of [s]plendor, were [s]ome, tenderly attached to her from principle, and others, whom the united beauties of her mind and per[s]on had in[s]pired with a wi[s]h, to lead her again to the altar of Hymen. But I[s]abelle had drank too deeply of the bitter cup of affliction to [s]uffer love ever again to enter her bo[s]om. Faithful to the memory of her regretted lord, her heart could receive no [s]econd impre[s][s]ion. "Our love," [s]he would [s]ay, "was unfortunate, but he has left me an ine[s]timable pledge behind; [s]hall I give the daughter of my adored Arundel another father, or by extending my family duties have le[s]s time to be[s]tow in rendering my child worthy of the name [s]he bears? No; the [s]incere[s]t proof I can give of my affection to her father, is to live a widow for her [s]ake." This re[s]olve of I[s]abelle being once known, and [s]he [s]till per[s]i[s]ting in [s]ecluding her[s]elf from the world, [s]he was [s]oon forgotten, almo[s]t as much as if [s]he had been dead; for love cannot long exi[s]t without hope, and the gay and thoughtle[s]s [s]oon forget tho[s]e on whom the [s]un of pro[s]perity no longer [s]hines. She was left in peace to enjoy her retirement, and to cultivate unmolested the mind of her lovely daughter. The Dangers of Greatne[s]s. As Columbia increa[s]ed in years, her affection for her mother daily [s]trengthened. It was an affection actuated by the enthu[s]ia[s]tic fervor of youth, yet [s]weetly tempered by a friend[s]hip which might have become maturer years. I[s]abelle was to her daughter, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] mother, [s]i[s]ter, friend; every tender connexion combined in one. Never did child more love or fear a parent; yet her fear did not proceed from the apprehen[s]ion of punishment or [s]evere correction. But to [s]ee her mother frown, to be told [s]he had offended her, and to be [s]poken to with coldne[s]s, gave her [s]uch inexpre[s][s]ible anguish, that the thought at any time was [s]ufficient to fill her eyes with tears. As [s]he advanced towards womanhood, [s]he could not but ob[s]erve the extreme pen[s]ivene[s]s of her mother's di[s]po[s]ition; the pur[s]uits and plea[s]ures of childhood gradually lo[s]t their charms, [s]he more frequently [s]ought the [s]ociety of I[s]abelle, and when [s]ometimes [s]he surprised her in tears, [s]he would [s]ink on her knees before her, and, folding her arms round her wai[s]t, cry, "Why, my beloved mother, will you confine your [s]orrows to your own brea[s]t, why not repo[s]e them in the bo[s]om of your child? Let me [s]hare them, my mother, and in [s]haring [s]oothe them." I[s]abelle would faintly [s]mile at the[s]e effu[s]ions of her daughter's tenderne[s]s, and as [s]he ki[s][s]ed the affectionate girl tell her, it was too early in life for her to be acquainted with [s]orrow, though [s]he could feel it only from the tenderne[s]s of her nature, leading her to compa[s][s]ionate the [s]ufferings of others. "I am not [s]o happy as I formerly was, my dear Mina," [s]aid Columbia to her attendant one evening as they were walking in the garden; "I [s]ee my mother daily [s]inking under the weight of afflictions I can neither comprehend or alleviate. Ye[s]terday I tremblingly a[s]ked her, if I was the cau[s]e of her [s]orrow; [s]he pre[s][s]ed me to her heart and [s]aid, in [s]ome mea[s]ure I was. Alarmed, I inquired what I had done to offend her. Nothing, [s]he replied; you are my only comfort, my greate[s]t ble[s][s]ing, and I cannot but lament---Her tears at that moment impeded her words, and when [s]he recovered her voice, [s]he bade me leave her. I obeyed; but [s]till I have a weight upon my heart, an anxious, re[s]tle[s]s wi[s]h to know, how without offending I can cau[s]e her [s]o much affliction." Mina could not [s]atisfy her young lady's curio[s]ity: [s]he could only ki[s]s her hands, and in a voice rendered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] exqui[s]itely [s]oft by grateful affection, declare it was impossible her dear little benefactre[s]s could offend any one! But though Mina was ignorant of the cau[s]e of Isabelle's tears, Cora, the Indian [s]ervant, was not equally [s]o. She [s]aw Columbia partook of her mother's depression, without under[s]tanding the cau[s]e; and the loquacity naturally prevalent in per[s]ons of an advanced age, made her eagerly watch for an opportunity to inform the innocent girl of all [s]he knew. The moment long [s]ought at length arrived. Columbia had frequently observed her mother weeping over papers which [s]he took from a private drawer in an e[s]critoire which [s]tood in her bed chamber, and which in no other part was locked, except that which [s]he mo[s]t wi[s]hed to explore. One day coming [s]uddenly into the room, [s]he [s]aw her gazing at a portrait which [s]he pre[s][s]ed to her lips, rai[s]ing her eyes toward heaven with a [s]ort of reverential awe. "May I not, my dear mother," [s]aid [s]he, "behold the object that [s]eems at once to excite both grief and exultation." I[s]abelle turned the portrait towards her; it was an Indian maid habited in the manner of her country; but in habiliments that be[s]poke her of elevated rank. Her jetty hair, which flowed in profu[s]ion round her face and over her neck, was ornamented with a coronet of pearl and gold; her thin white robe was cla[s]ped at the bo[s]om with [s]tuds of the [s]ame valuable materials, and her arms, which were naked to the [s]houlders, were in [s]everal places bound with bands of [s]ilver and coral. "This," [s]aid I[s]abelle, as [s]he pre[s]ented it to her daughter, "is the portrait of your grandmother; by birth a queen , the only child of a monarch who[s]e wealth had no bounds, and who, far from the haunts of tho[s]e who call them[s]elves civilized people, reigned unmole[s]ted, till the adventurous [s]pirit of your great ance[s]tor Columbus prompted him to [s]eekin di[s]tant [s]eas for unknown worlds. Oh, [s]ublime and too daring [s]pirit," [s]he continued, whil[s]t her rai[s]ed eyes gli[s]tened with the tear of extorted remembrance, "why wert thou endowed with qualities, which [s]erved but to [s]tir up in the brea[s]ts of thine enemies the malignant fiend Envy. Why! whil[s]t thou wert [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] labouring to benefit and enlighten po[s]terity, wert thou [s]ealing thy own ruin!" The portrait dropped from her hand, and her head re[s]ted on the [s]houlder of her child. "Oh! my daughter," cried [s]he enthu[s]ia[s]tically, as her tears [s]ub[s]ided, "whil[s]t I glory in the qualities with which it has plea[s]ed Heaven to endow your mind and per[s]on, I cannot but tremble for your future fate; for to po[s][s]e[s]s [s]uperior beauty, [s]en[s]e or genius, is but to excite the wonder of the ignorant, and the envy of little minds, whil[s]t tho[s]e who are wi[s]e, or great in their own conceit, will wound your feelings with contempt or ridicule, which your own good nature and [s]en[s]ibility will not permit you to retaliate. I cannot proceed, my child; my powers are not at pre[s]ent adequate to the ta[s]k of recounting the misfortunes of your family." I[s]abelle pau[s]ed for a moment, then tenderly ki[s][s]ed Columbia, and leaving the portrait in the hands of her child, pa[s][s]ed from the apartment. Sinking upon the [s]eat her mother had left unoccupied, one hand [s]upporting her head as her elbow re[s]ted on the e[s]critoire, the other which held the portrait fell on her knees, her eyes immoveably fixed on tho[s]e of the inanimate face [s]he contemplated, Columbia [s]at immoveable as a [s]tatue, till rou[s]ed by the voice of Cora. "Look there," [s]aid [s]he, putting the miniature towards the aged [s]ervant; "[s]ee! my mother [s]ays it is the picture of my grandmother." "It is, it is," cried Cora, dropping on her knees and ki[s][s]ing the picture with rapture; "it is the figure of my queen, my mi[s]tre[s]s, in the dre[s]s [s]he wore on the day [s]he was e[s]pou[s]ed by Don Ferdinando. Oh fatal day! unhappy hour! by that union [s]he [s]ealed her own wretchedne[s]s, the ruin of her father, the [s]lavery of his people, and brought destruction on the heads of her adored hu[s]band and his respected parent! Ah! my [s]weet young mi[s]tre[s]s, I can no longer forbear; I mu[s]t tell you the fatal [s]tory of your father's wrongs." "Do [s]o," [s]aid I[s]abelle, who at that moment returned to her apartment; "do [s]o, my good Cora; and let it be a warning to my child how [s]he quits the quiet paths of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] retirement to enter on the gay or bu[s]y [s]cenes of life. Here, take this key; what your memory cannot furni[s]h toward the recital, the papers you will [s]ind in that drawer will a[s][s]i[s]t. Li[s]ten with attention, my dear child, and learn that content builds her dwelling in [s]olitude, and peace [s]preads her pinions over the cottage of the humble; whil[s]t the paths of ambition are [s]trewed with thorns, and the dwellings of the great are the habitations of mi[s]ery." An Old Woman's Tale interrupted. " It is many years ago," [s]aid Cora, [s]eating her[s]elf in an ea[s]y chair, her right hand [s]pread out, as commanding attention, and every feature of her aged countenance beaming with the [s]atisfaction which the liberty of repeating tales of old times gave her; "it is a great many years ago, I was then [s]carcely eight years old, when your great-grandfather Columbus arrived in our country; I never [s]hall forget it: for I can remember things which happened when I was a child much better than tho[s]e which pa[s]s now daily. Time [s]teals away our memory, but tho[s]e things which either frightened, or [s]urpri[s]ed us when we were young, are the la[s]t which we forget. So as I was [s]aying"--- "Stay, my good Cora," [s]aid Columbia, "let us examine the papers; there may be letters which may [s]erve to elucidate your relation, and explain events which happened antecedent to the time of your remembrance."--- "I do not think you will find any worth reading," [s]aid Cora, impatiently. "We will [s]ee," replied Columbia, mildly, as [s]he opened the drawer. "You may look," cried Cora [s]omewhat petti[s]hly, "but I am [s]ure there is nothing worth attending to, till the time of Don Ferdinando's arrival in Peru and becoming enamoured of my royal mi[s]tre[s]s Orrabella." "Hu[s]h, hu[s]h, my kind friend," [s]aid Columbia. "Here is a letter [s]igned Columbus; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] there are [s]everal in the [s]ame hand writing; they mu[s]t contain facts nece[s][s]ary for me to know, or they would not be thus carefully pre[s]erved. Be [s]ilent, and I will read them to you. Cora [s]at her[s]elf back in the ea[s]y chair, and [s]hutting her eyes in token of attention, remained [s]ilent. Columbia opened the letter. October, 1490. I AM parted from you, my adored Beatina; but painful as the parting is, I feel it is for our [s]uture advantage. I am convinced, my beloved wife, that there are worlds beyond the narrow bounds which our natural philo[s]ophers at pre[s]ent pre[s]cribe. I have [s]tudied much, my lovely friend, and am almo[s]t certain, that were I [s]upplied with ve[s][s]els, men, provi[s]ions, and every thing nece[s][s]ary, I [s]hould make di[s]coveries that would occasion my name to be revered in after ages; and tho[s]e who blamed my lovely Beatina for giving her[s]elf to her Columbus, [s]hall [s]ay, "You did right, Beatina; Columbus has an enterpri[s]ing [s]pirit that will carve out a fortune, even from a barren wa[s]te. For is not the ocean a barren wa[s]te? and yet even from that do I mean to carve out for my [s]oul's idol an empire, where [s]he [s]hall reign queen over all, as [s]he does over my heart. Why, why, my be[s]t beloved, are you not endowed with [s]trength of frame, that your friend[s]hip might increase my fortitude in danger, and [s]hare the glorious triumph of unexpected [s]ucce[s]s? Yet why [s]hould I wi[s]h you to lo[s]e the [s]weet feminine [s]oftne[s]s which fir[s]t won, and [s]till holds captive my heart? I know not what I wi[s]h, Beatina. You [s]o entirely po[s][s]e[s]s my thoughts, that whil[s]t I [s]earch this va[s]t globe for unknown worlds, to lay them at your feet when found, I would have the fame, the glory of the di[s]covery all your own. And will it not be yours? Yes! [s]urely yes; for you in[s]pired the thought, prompted the [s]earch, and are the magic charm that actuates all my endeavours.

Sweet Beatina, do not grieve at this our long [s]eparation; when I return, I will return worthy of your love; I will make my charmer wor[s]hipped by tho[s]e who now hold her in contempt. I am about to lay before the king of Portugal a plan for making tho[s]e di[s]coveries, you have [s]o frequently heard me mention as more than probable. If he li[s]tens to me, my fortune is certain; if he treats my propo[s]als as chimerical, the offspring of a di[s]ordered imagination, I will apply to [s]ome other power. Deare[s]t, have courage; the per[s]evering [s]pirit mu[s]t in time conquer. Believe I but exi[s]t, whil[s]t abfent from you, and think that exi[s]tence [s]carcely worth pre[s]erving but for your [s]ake. Heaven ble[s]s my Beatina. C. COLUMBUS. "That letter was written before my remembrance," [s]aid Cora. "Very likely," replied Columbia, scarcely noticing the date, in her eagerne[s]s to open another. January, 1491. I HAVE been di[s]appointed, my [s]weet friend, but be not you di[s]heartened. Thanks be to Heaven, I left you and my darling boy in a [s]afe retreat, where, though not enjoying all the advantages your rank in life might demand, you have at lea[s]t all the comforts nece[s][s]ary to the real pleasures of life. But think not, my beloved, my e[s]teemed friend, I would wander forth in [s]earch of adventures, and leave the wife of my choice and the offspring of her affection to langui[s]h out many years, nay, perhaps their whole lives, in ob[s]curity. No! no! Columbus labours not for his own advantage, but for the advantage of tho[s]e [s]o nearly, [s]o dearly connected with him. I will leave you, my love, whenever I quit my native land, in a [s]tate of honour and opulence, or my [s]cheme [s]hall be totally abandoned.

I leave my native land to-morrow, in order to [s]olicit Ferdinand of Spain to grant me the ve[s][s]els and [s]upplies nece[s][s]ary for pro[s]ecuting my intended voyage. I am told the court of Spain is more enlightened than any other court in Europe. I had, previous to my quitting you, found means to lay my plans before the Briti[s]h throne; but I fear they were treated as the project of a vi[s]ionary; for though my brother undertook the charge, I have received no an[s]wer. Alas! Beatina, how hard it is to combat any received prejudice. The wi[s]e and learned men of pa[s]t ages have held it impo[s][s]ible for mariners to find a pa[s][s]age, or proceed, without incurring immediate death, beyond certain boundaries which their confined knowledge has marked out. But I will not be withheld from the experiment. If I [s]ucceed, after ages will revere my name; if I fail, it will [s]ink quietly into oblivion; or perhaps [s]ome future genius, enterpri[s]ing and [s]anguine as my[s]elf, [s]hall drop a tear to my memory, and as he laments my fate, tremble for his own. Adieu, my friend, my lovely comforter. I am more yours than my own. C. COLUMBUS. After this, [s]everal letters were peru[s]ed by Columbia, which contained little more than a repetition of his attachment to Beatina, and accounts of his un[s]ucce[s]sful applications to Ferdinand, the then reigning king of Spain. At length the following called up all her attention. May, 1492. CONGRATULATE me, my lovely friend; I am at length [s]ucce[s]sful! How have I counted the tedious months that kept me from my [s]oul's idol; and how often have I feared that my per[s]everance would be of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] no avail, and that I had [s]acrificed ages of real happiness (for hours are ages to the heart that loves as mine does) to the vi[s]ionary hopes of future greatne[s]s. But I am [s]ucce[s]sful. I [s]hall explore tho[s]e di[s]tant [s]eas, with which my [s]tudies have [s]o well acquainted me, and in [s]ome unknown world [s]eek out a kingdom of which my Beatina [s]hall be queen. Yes, you [s]hall be queen; for what[s]oever world I find, be it the faire[s]t, greate[s]t, or the be[s]t the [s]un ever [s]hone on, no man [s]hould ever claim a right to govern it. For it is to a woman I owe the means of making the great attempt. I am [s]o overjoyed I cannot proceed methodically; yet I know you langui[s]h to learn every particular that concerns your Columbus. I have in former letters informed you of my hitherto fruitle[s]s [s]olicitations. Wearied by attendance on ministers and creatures, who hung about the king like bees upon the [s]weet [s]cabious, draining it of its vital moi[s]ture till its very root decayed, when they returned to their hives laden with the precious [s]tore, regardle[s]s of the dying [s]tate of the flower from which they had extracted both life and health; di[s]gu[s]ted with their unmeaning profe[s][s]ions, their hypocri[s]y and [s]tupidity, I had nearly relinqui[s]hed the undertaking, when I one morning received an order to attend the queen's private drawing room. You may [s]uppo[s]e I did not he[s]itate to obey the [s]ummons. The royal I[s]abelle received me with affability and encouraging [s]weetne[s]s; [s]he conde[s]cended to confer with me on my intended voyage, and on the [s]tudies which led me to hope for [s]ucce[s]s. She listened with attention to my rea[s]ons, and bade me attend the levee next morning. I went. My royal patrone[s]s urged my [s]uit to the king with all the earne[s]tne[s]s of per[s]ua[s]ive eloquence. He li[s]tened; but it was with cold, almo[s]t contemptuous [s]ilence. Yet was [s]he not di[s]mayed; her fine features glowed with enthu[s]ia[s]m, as [s]he expre[s][s]ed a prophetic a[s][s]urance of [s]ucce[s]s. Her intercessions were fini[s]hed with this heroic declaration:--- "If your maje[s]ty," [s]aid [s]he, "conceives the plan too wild, too eccentric to be countenanced, by ordering this enterpri[s]ing man the nece[s][s]ary [s]upplies from the public [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] trea[s]ury; and if your own private pur[s]e will not at pre[s]ent allow of [s]o large a di[s]bur[s]ement, [s]uffer me to rai[s]e the money on my own per[s]onal jewels. I be[s]eech your maje[s]ty do not [s]ay me nay. I want no ornaments to render me plea[s]ing to my [s]overeign, and will cheerfully part with them, to benefit his [s]ubjects, or add to his territories." Struck with the magnanimity of the propo[s]al, Ferdinand could no longer refu[s]e; he gave immediate orders for the equipment of a fleet, in which I am to proceed on my intended di[s]covery; and a [s]um of money is to be paid to me from the trea[s]ury, to provide every nece[s][s]ary for the voyage. I fell at the feet of the royal I[s]abelle, and ki[s][s]ed, with grateful tran[s]ports, the hem of her garment. She graciou[s]ly rai[s]ed me, and with a [s]mile of heavenly benignity a[s][s]ured me, that you, my Beatina, and our darling Ferdinando, [s]hould be taken under her immediate protection. Ha[s]ten then, my deare[s]t, on the receipt of this; ha[s]ten to Spain, and let me introduce you to our augu[s]t queen. I know you will partake my joy; and if a tear does [s]tart at the thought of parting, I al[s]o know you will wipe it off un[s]een, le[s]t it [s]hould unman the heart of your adoring COLUMBUS. "Undaunted [s]pirit of my ance[s]tor," cried Columbia, as [s]he clo[s]ed the letter, "may you ever inhabit the bo[s]oms of his de[s]cendants." "But what is the next letter?" [s]aid Cora. She opened it, but it was only a farewel to Beatina, when he was ready to [s]ail from Cadiz; and by it Columbia di[s]overed that lady and her [s]on were retained in the Spani[s]h court under the immediate protection of I[s]abelle. The next was a large packet, and of [s]uch a nature as could not be ha[s]tily or [s]lightly pa[s][s]ed over. Columbus. February, 1493. THOU be[s]om friend of the brave[s]t man that ever lived, thy queen now claims thee as her friend and sister. I[s]abelle is in affliction, and calls on Beatina to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] comfort her. Yet how can I a[s]k comfort from you, when I have none to offer in return? I cannot [s]ee you, le[s]t you cur[s]e the hand that [s]upplied the means for this ill-[s]tarred voyage. Our Columbus, the man who[s]e name [s]hall be revered while time endures, is no more! He [s]leeps in the va[s]t ocean; but his memory [s]hall live forever. Did I [s]ay I had no comfort to offer? Alas! my regrets for his lo[s]s were [s]o great, I forgot that he triumphed ere he died. He found the wondrous unknown world he [s]ought; but his own words will be[s]t tell his [s]ucce[s]s. The inclo[s]ed was brought to our court this morning by a [s]ea captain, who, whil[s]t yet far from the Spani[s]h coa[s]t, [s]aw [s]omething floating on the waves; and feeling an awakened curio[s]ity prompt him, went a little out of his cour[s]e to take it up. It was a ca[s]k painted white. On opening it, they found this [s]ad te[s]timony of our fatal lo[s]s, inclosed in a cake of wax, and [s]urrounded by a quantity of cork, in order, as is imagined, to facilitate its swimming. I am inadequate to the ta[s]k of adding more; only to [s]ay, when you can [s]ee me without di[s]tre[s]s to your[s]elf, come to me, and let us mingle our tears together. Bring Ferdinando with you; henceforth he is my [s]on. Farewel. ISABELLE. Inclo[s]ed in the foregoing. -  , December, 1492. Royal and revered Lady , THE mo[s]t humble and grateful of your fervants addre[s][s]es you at a moment, when he much fears he [s]hall never again behold you. I am, with my little convoy, in a boi[s]terous and almo[s]t unknown [s]ea, at a [s]ea[s]on of the year when [s]torms prevail, and the inclemency of the weather renders our [s]afety extremely precarious. The clouds hang low; the atmo[s]phere is thick; the hollow murmuring [s]ea, and bleak wind that whi[s]tles through the rigging, portends an approaching [s]torm.

The new, the hitherto unexplored world, of which I fondly dreamed [s]o many anxious years, is at length di[s]covered! I [s]hall annex to this the cour[s]e by which I [s]teered, the [s]oundings as we approached the land, and every requi[s]ite direction for mariners to find the place where I have left a little colony of forty men. Our voyage from Spain was tedious in the extreme, and tho[s]e who had not the [s]ame internal a[s][s]urances, which my inten[s]e [s]tudy had given me, of our being in a right cour[s]e, were almo[s]t tempted to mutiny, to confine me, and, taking command of the fleet, return to Spain; but to my inexpre[s][s]ible joy, when even my own [s]pirits began to fail, nor could I longer have silenced the fears of the mariners, on the morning of the 12th of October, I di[s]covered land. We made for the [s]hore, and on the 13th landed and took possession of a beautiful fertile i[s]land, in the name of your augu[s]t con[s]ort Ferdinand. I ki[s][s]ed the ground as I landed, and called it St. Salvadora, in honour of my gracious patrone[s]s; for her bounty relieved me when I was in utter de[s]pair of ever making the attempt of a di[s]covery, and the [s]ight of this i[s]land pre[s]erved me from the vengeance of a di[s]appointed, terrified [s]et of [s]eamen, who thought I had fooli[s]hly dragged them from their friends and country to peri[s]h on the ocean. I found the inhabitants humane, [s]ocial, and tractable; and left our little colony in a [s]tate of greater comfort than could have been expected. But the impo[s][s]ibility of obtaining proper provi[s]ions for the long voyage before us, and the very fragile [s]tate of our barques to combat [s]eas unu[s]ually tempe[s]tuous at this [s]ea[s]on, renders me fearful I [s]hall never again [s]ee Spain, or kneel at the feet of my royal mi[s]tre[s]s. The i[s]land I have di[s]covered yields plenty of gold du[s]t; pearls are found in the rivers; and from what I could ob[s]erve, diamonds and other precious [s]tones are ea[s]ily procured. For the natives not only wear them in their hair and about their necks, but decorate their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] temples with them, intermixed with gold and [s]ilver. The[s]e temples are in general dedicated to the Sun , which is their chief object of adoration. The [s]acred duties are performed by prie[s]te[s][s]es, who vow eternal virginity. Their men are tall and well proportioned; the women beautiful in the extreme. Thus have I [s]lightly touched on the many charms to entice my [s]overeign to make this territory her own. Oh may the wealth its mines contain, enrich her above all her cotemporaries; may the colony [s]he plants increa[s]e and flouri[s]h; there may [s]he found a new, a glorious world, that after ages [s]hall at once admire and fear. And now that life perhaps is near its clo[s]e, will my benignant queen permit her [s]ervant to recommend once more to her protection, my wife and child? Ferdinando is now fifteen. When he attains the age of manhood, let him pur[s]ue the path I have marked out, and fini[s]h what his father but begun; and [s]hould his [s]earches meet with the [s]ucce[s]s my [s]pirit prophe[s]ies, let the new world be called Columbia . It will unite the name of Beatina with Columbus, perpetuating her loved name with mine. I would have wrote to my beloved wife, but what could I [s]ay? My heart bleeds for what [s]he will [s]uffer. You, my gracious mi[s]tre[s]s, will not for[s]ake her. Comfort her, con[s]ole her; tell her that Beatina will be the la[s]t [s]ound that trembles on my lips. Pardon me, sovereign lady, my [s]tyle grows familiar; but the grave levels all di[s]tinctions, and I am now [s]tanding on its brink. A few more hours, and I plunge into a va[s]t eternity! If the [s]torm increa[s]es, my ve[s][s]el cannot much longer brave its fury; if mine cannot, what will become of the poor little caravels that accompany me? Their fate is certain! Royal I[s]abelle, farewel. While life lingers in this frail tenement, gratitude for thy munificence can never be extinct in the heart of thy [s]ervant, COLUMBUS. "Noble, brave commander," cried Columbia, giving way to a flood of tears; "and was this thy untimely [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] end?" "No, no," [s]aid Cora interrupting her; "he made [s]everal voyages after that, or el[s]eshow [s]hould he carry Don Ferdinando to Peru? He did not die till after the birth of Chri[s]topher and a [s]i[s]ter of your mother, who was chri[s]tened I[s]abelle, after the queen of Spain. He lived to a good old age, and was hearty and well till misfortune overtook him; then he moped and pined; nay, I have [s]een him weep like a baby, and he died at la[s]t broken hearted." "More [s]hame for tho[s]e who could wound a heart [s]o noble," [s]aid Columbia, whil[s]t resentment, as it crim[s]oned her cheek, dried up her tears; and [s]he proceeded to the next letter. It contained an account of Columbus's [s]afe return. After having encountered innumerable perils, he landed at Palos, in Spain, on the 15th of March, 1493. After which, [s]everal other letters announce another voyage, in which he was more [s]ucce[s]sful than the fir[s]t, returning laden with ingots of gold, with pearls, with diamonds, and immen[s]e plates of [s]ilver. But his [s]ucce[s]s and the homage the populace [s]eemed inclined to pay him, awakened a [s]pirit of envy in tho[s]e who had at fir[s]t oppo[s]ed, or treated as the chimeras of a di[s]ordered fancy, his plans for the di[s]covery of a distant continent. They had not time to bring their plots to ripen, before he again embarked for America, with a large company of volunteers, gentlemen of the fir[s]t rank in Spain; among[s]t which was his own [s]on, Don Ferdinando. A farewel letter from this young gentleman to his mother, was the fir[s]t that awakened Cora's attention. It was dated in June, 1498. "That was the time," [s]aid [s]he, "that was the very voyage, which I [s]o well remember." "Were you eight years old then, Cora?" [s]aid Columbia. "Yes, I was indeed," replied Cora, "but I remember every circum[s]tance, as well as if it had pa[s][s]ed but ye[s]terday!" "Then do tell me, dear Cora," [s]aid Columbia, "tell me all; for in li[s]tening to the recital of a per[s]on who was pre[s]ent whil[s]t the events they relate happened, it [s]eems as if you were tran[s]ported to the very [s]cene, and witne[s]s to the incidents recited." New Scenes, new Men, new Manners. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] " It was on the fir[s]t of Augu[s]t," [s]aid Cora, drawing her[s]elf forward, whil[s]t memory [s]eemed upon the [s]tretch to recal events [s]o long pa[s]t; "it was, as near as I can recollect, about the beginning of Augu[s]t, when my mother, who was chief attendant about the royal children of Orrozombo, king of Peru, was ordered to attend the queen and her children to a palace newly built on the [s]ea coa[s]t, a great di[s]tance from the capital. I [s]hall never forget it; it was as fine a morning as ever [s]hone. The prince[s]s Orrabella was the olde[s]t of five daughters; for my royal ma[s]ter never had a [s]on, and [s]he was looked upon as our future queen. I was then, as I told you, but eight years old, quite delighted with our new habitation. I followed the prince[s]s, with whom I was a great favourite, from one apartment to another, till we reached the top. There, as we [s]tood looking toward the [s]ea, we [s]aw a mon[s]trous fi[s]h or bird, for it was impo[s][s]ible to tell which it was; its body was black, its wings white; it was coming quick toward the [s]hore. The prince[s]s [s]hrieked. The king and queen had, from a lower apartment, ob[s]erved the [s]ame mon[s]ter ha[s]tily approaching; and ordering forth the guards, bade them draw up on the beach, and as it drew near di[s]charge their arrows at it. But, Oh terrible, if I was to live a thou[s]and years, I never [s]hall forget how frightened every creature was, when the huge mon[s]ter, drawing quite near, [s]topped on a [s]udden, and dropping all its wings, a bur[s]t of fire and [s]moke i[s][s]ued from its [s]ide, with tremendous noi[s]e. Many fell to the earth with terror, as this dreadful phenomena was repeated three times. When our fears were in [s]ome mea[s]ure abated, we plainly [s]aw living creatures move upon it, and [s]oon a [s]maller fi[s]h of the [s]ame kind, only without wings, came from its [s]ide, and [s]everal men were borne by it quite to the [s]hore. The guards affrighted, dared not di[s]charge their arrows, but let their bows fall, and gazed in [s]ilent wonder. The king, the queen, and all the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] royal children were [s]tanding on the [s]hore. The princess Orrabella was ever brave and undaunted; [s]he [s]tood leaning on my mother's arm, the foremo[s]t of them all. I had hid my face in her robe; but though afraid to look long on the terrifying object, I now and then drew it a[s]ide to peep at a creature [s]o wonderful. "But, my good Cora," cried Columbia, rather impatient at the old woman's prolixity, "if you are thus particular, you will never get to the end of your [s]tory. This mon[s]ter, as you de[s]cribe it, I [s]uppo[s]e was the [s]hip that bore the great Columbus to the Peruvian coa[s]t; and the little fi[s]h you mention was the boat in which he landed." "Well, I know that," replied Cora, angrily; "but I like to tell a [s]tory my own way. If I am not allowed to tell all the particulars, I [s]hall never be able to tell it at all." Columbia [s]miled and was [s]ilent. Cora again began, but [s]he [s]o often interrupted her[s]elf telling the [s]ame incidents [s]everal times over, and dwelling on each with a tire[s]ome minutene[s]s, that Columbia, though anxious, could [s]carcely command her attention to the end of the [s]tory. From it [s]he gathered the following circum[s]tances. Columbus, though he had made two voyages before, one when he di[s]covered St. Salvadora, and another with relief and [s]upplies for the colony he had left there, had not di[s]covered the part of the American continent of which Cora was a native, till his third voyage; when many noblemen and cavaliers from the court of Spain accompanied him in his expedition, in hopes of [s]haring at once the glory and emolument the di[s]coveries were likely to produce. Among[s]t the gallant group of gentlemen was Ferdinando, only [s]on of Columbus. He landed with his father, both richly habited and followed by a train of cavaliers equally gay. With white flags waving, and their drawn [s]words pointed towards the earth, they advanced to the party de[s]cribed by Cora to be a[s][s]embled on the [s]hore. Orrabella, [s]truck with the maje[s]tic yet conciliating mien of Columbus, perhaps more with the per[s]onal beauty and elegant deportment of Ferdinando, who advanced at his right hand, pre[s][s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] forward to meet them; and with a countenance at once expre[s][s]ive of wonder, admiration and timidity, her right arm extended [s]eemed a barrier to prevent their approaching her parents and [s]i[s]ters, whil[s]t laying her left hand on her brea[s]t [s]he knelt to the ground, rai[s]ing her fine eyes in token of [s]upplication. Ferdinando rai[s]ed her, laid his [s]word at her feet, and throwing a [s]tring of beads about her neck, told her, in the language of nature, which is alike under[s]tood in all nations, that [s]he had nothing to fear. Orrozombo, a[s][s]ured of their friendly intentions, received them cordially, and [s]hewed them every mark of ho[s]pitality. They re[s]ided on the continent many months, collecting ingots of pure gold, bars of [s]ilver, with pearls, diamonds and coral, forming the mo[s]t wealthy cargo ever borne into a Spani[s]h port. During the time Columbus and his followers tarried at the Peruvian court, Ferdinando had numberle[s]s opportunities of improving the favourable impre[s][s]ion his fir[s]t appearance made on the lovely Orrabella. He [s]oon instructed her in the Spani[s]h tongue; and with equal facility, became him[s]elf a proficient in her native language. He found her po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]trong powers of mind, quick perception, ready wit; in [s]hort, an understanding capable of the highe[s]t improvement. The mutual pa[s][s]ion that [s]ub[s]i[s]ted between them was early di[s]covered, and encouraged by their parents. Columbus looked forward to the union as a mean of in[s]uring wealth and power to his po[s]terity, and Orrozombo imagined, by re[s]igning his daughter to this young [s]tranger, he [s]ecured to him[s]elf a powerful friend and ally in Columbus. For the Spaniards had taught his [s]ubjects many of the u[s]eful arts; and Science, by their means, began to unfold her beauties to the delighted monarch and his court. Upon their marriage, Orrozombo gave up part of his territories to Columbus, as a portion for his daughter; and a colony was begun, where every thing was regulated according to the Spani[s]h form of government. This being [s]ettled to the [s]atisfaction of all parties, the adventurers prepared to revi[s]it their native land; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] and the royal bride of Ferdinando determined to go with her hu[s]band. Several of her attendants were appointed to accompany her; among[s]t whom was the mother of Cora, who at the prince[s]s's reque[s]t took her daughter with her. With many tears did Orrabella quit her parents and [s]i[s]ters; tears which [s]eemed to forebode they would never meet again. Alas! Avarice had di[s]covered this new world was an inexhau[s]tible mine of wealth; and, not content to [s]hare its ble[s][s]ings in common with the natives, came with rapine, war and deva[s]tation in her train: And as [s]he tore open the bowels of the earth to gratify her in[s]atiate thir[s]t for gold, her [s]teps were marked with blood. Ingratitude and Perfidy. The [s]hip in which Ferdinando and his bride embarked was de[s]tined to proceed immediately to Spain; but Columbus him[s]elf, in a [s]mall caravel, determined to cro[s]s over to Hi[s]paniola, and vi[s]it a colony which now began to wear a very flouri[s]hing appearance. Many families had emigrated from Spain, [s]ome of considerable di[s]tinction; and Columbus had, previous to his embarkation, [s]olicited the government of this colony for an indigent friend, hoping he might in the new world retrieve his ruined fortunes. It was partly a wi[s]h to [s]ee how his intention [s]ucceeded, that prompted him to vi[s]it Hi[s]paniola at this time. The reception he met with, and the manner of his return to Spain, Columbia found in the following letter. -  1499. THY father is returned, my dear [s]on, returned to his native land. But how? Not as an enterpri[s]ing [s]pirit who[s]e plans had proved [s]ucce[s]sful, [s]hould return; but as a traitor to his king, loaded with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] ignominious chains. Oh! my brave boy, I [s]ee thy noble [s]pirit fire at the intelligence. But beware; conceal the workings of thy hone[s]t [s]oul. To pro[s]per in this ungrateful world, you mu[s]t wear the ma[s]k of hypocrisy; wear the [s]emblance of humility, hone[s]ty, patrioti[s]m, till you have obtained [s]ome favourite point, then throw them a[s]ide as u[s]ele[s]s, and glory in the success of your [s]tratagems. Pardon me, my [s]on, I write from the impul[s]e of a broken heart. I know you would [s]corn [s]uch advice if [s]eriou[s]ly given, even from a father; but I have suffered [s]o much from ingratitude and duplicity, and have [s]een tho[s]e who practi[s]e them mo[s]t, [s]eem to [s]ucceed the be[s]t, that I would willingly [s]hut my eyes on the light of day, and [s]ink into eternal re[s]t. My dear Ferdinando, your father has received a wound no time can heal. Surely we mu[s]t hope, that in the ble[s]t abodes of immortality, the [s]oul retains no remembrance of what pa[s][s]ed in this [s]ublunary [s]tate; el[s]e certain I am, that the delights of paradi[s]e it[s]elf would be alloyed by the retrospect of the ignominy I have endured, and the chains I have worn. And what will that trea[s]ure of my [s]oul, thy adored mother, [s]ay? How will my Beatina bear the degradation of her Columbus? Will not her father, (but lately reconciled to his child) again [s]purn her from him? And will not her haughty brothers and [s]i[s]ters pour their in[s]olent reproaches on the wife of a di[s]graced, a ruined favourite? Your lovely Orrabella too! Alas! I greatly fear, whil[s]t we were ho[s]pitably entertained at her father's court, we were ungratefully paving the way for the introduction of war, rapine and destruction. Yet witne[s]s, ye immortal Powers, I am innocent. I [s]ought not new worlds for conque[s]t, or for power; I felt, forcibly felt, the ble[s][s]ings of Christianity, the comforts re[s]ulting from a commercial intercourse with other nations. I vainly thought tho[s]e blessings through my means might be extended, and earnestly wi[s]hed them participated by the whole world. But I am venting the [s]orrows of my agonize [s]oul, and forget you are a [s]tranger to what has cau[s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] them. Oh! ever, ever, may you remain a [s]tranger to [s]uch angui[s]h. May my [s]on never experience how far beyond all other mi[s]eries which malice can inflict, or human nature [s]uffer, is the torture occa[s]ioned by the poi[s]oned [s]ting of ingratitude. But to my [s]ad tale. Light plea[s]ant gales, and a [s]mooth [s]ea quickly bore the caravel in which I embarked to Hi[s]paniola. A certain emblem of the vici[s][s]itudes of human life; for how often does the [s]un of pro[s]perity gild the horizon, and its delightful airs play around and fa[s]cinate the [s]en[s]es, whil[s]t the [s]torms of adver[s]ity hang unob[s]erved, ready to bur[s]t on our devoted heads. Roldan (whom you mu[s]t remember was appointed through my interce[s][s]ion to the government of this coloony) received me with the grate[s]t marks of re[s]pect, and a profu[s]ion of compliments. I ought to have been upon my guard and [s]u[s]pected his exce[s][s]ive adulation. His profe[s][s]ions of gratitude and attachment pained me; but as I knew the pre[s]ent affluent [s]tate of him[s]elf and family originated from my friend[s]hip, I attributed all to the noble[s]t motives, nor once [s]u[s]pected, that as I held him to my bo[s]om I was enfolding a serpent that waited but an opportunity to [s]ting me to the heart. The morning after my arrival the natives thronged in crowds to [s]ee me, and in the mo[s]t tumultuous manner expre[s][s]ed their joy at my return. Roldan, with an in[s]idious [s]mile, warned me to beware of giving them too much encouragement. "They are," [s]aid he, "an encroaching [s]et of wretches, and will torment you with complaints, which, as they exi[s]t only in their own imaginations, it is not in your power to redre[s]s. You had better [s]peak to them a little [s]ternly, and dismiss them to their homes." "How?" [s]aid I, rather [s]urpri[s]ed, "I do not rightly under[s]tand you. What privilege can the[s]e people solicit from you or me, which they have not a right to demand? Is not this continent theirs by right of nature? and is not the privilege of living here unmolested enjoyed by us through their un[s]u[s]pecting good nature, and the confidence they place in our hone[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] intentions? and [s]hall we abu[s]e this confidence, repay their ho[s]pitality by infringing their natural rights? Heaven forbid! If they have complaints to make, it is our duty to hear, and to the utmo[s]t of our power redre[s]s them." As I [s]poke with fervor, I ob[s]erved the countenance of Roldan change. A livid palene[s]s over[s]pread his face; his eyes gleamed, his lips trembled, and every features expre[s][s]ed a rage which he in vain attempted to conceal by a haggard [s]mile. "All is not as it [s]hould be," [s]aid I mentally; "I will inquire into the nature of the complaints he [s]eems [s]o anxious to evade. If Roldan has made an unju[s]t u[s]e of his power, it is not our pa[s]t friend[s]hip [s]hall [s]creen him from my reproach, or lead me to continue him in a [s]tation he appears inadequate to fill." Full of the[s]e thoughts, I immediately [s]et an inquiry on foot concerning the general conduct of Roldan and his officers. I found they had gro[s]sly abu[s]ed the power intru[s]ted to them; that they had di[s]tre[s][s]ed and treated the natives in many ca[s]es with the utmo[s]t barbarity! and that this arbitrary governor had [s]upported the Spaniards in every act of inju[s]tice or enormity they cho[s]e to commit. Having traced the[s]e grievances to their [s]ource, I reque[s]ted a council might be called; and then, in the mo[s]t forcible language I could think of, yet with temper and mildne[s]s, I repre[s]ented to them all the iniquity of their proceedings, conjured them to redre[s]s the injuries they had committed, and to reform the government. Some few [s]eemed plea[s]ed with my remonstrance, but the greater part heard me in [s]ullen [s]ilence. Roldan thanked me with a [s]arca[s]tic [s]mile for my advice; but at the [s]ame time told me he held his office by a commi[s][s]ion from the royal Ferdinand, and to him only was accountable for his actions. I was thunder[s]truck by his [s]peech and manner, and left the council room in a perturbation of mind not ea[s]ily described. Among[s]t the officers under the command of Roldan in this [s]ettlement, was a young man of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] dissolute manners, named Diego. He was younger [s]on [s]on to a noble family; but having di[s][s]ipated a con[s]iderable fortune, and from being at fir[s]t only weak and fooli[s]h, having become vicious, his friends thought proper to [s]olicit employment for him in the new [s]ettlement, and he was accordingly appointed third in command. This man I found the bo[s]om confidant and privy coun[s]ellor of Roldan. His rapacity knew no bounds; his pa[s][s]ions were his only ma[s]ter; and hurried by them to dreadful exce[s][s]es, he committed crimes at which humanity at once blu[s]hed and trembled. Though the very little knowledge I had of Diego had by no means prejudiced me in his favour, I could not have [s]uppo[s]ed he would have perpetrated crimes of the blacke[s]t die without compunction, or that Roldan would have openly dared to [s]anction his licentiou[s]ne[s]s; but I was at length fatally convinced, that when vice and folly are leagued together, there is no wickedne[s]s, however horrible, at which they will he[s]itate. Bruna was the only child of a venerable Indian, who[s]e po[s][s]e[s][s]ions were exten[s]ive and valuable. I had cultivated a friend[s]hip with the father of Bruna, when fir[s]t the [s]ettlement was formed; and both my[s]elf and followers experienced from him the kindne[s]s and attention which nature, when unadulterated by art, is ever ready to offer to the friendle[s]s, or the [s]tranger. His dwelling was at our [s]ervice; he [s]upplied us plentifully with goat's milk, the fle[s]h of deer, dried maize, and other comforts of life, which, to men who had experienced a tedious and weari[s]ome voyage, were real luxuries. Bruna at this time was a lovely child of about twelve years old; [s]he was wild and untutored; but there was [s]omething [s]o engaging in her manner, [s]o fa[s]cinating in her vivacity, that I could not [s]ee her daily without becoming in[s]en[s]ibly attached to her. Her curio[s]ity was unbounded; and the [s]ure[s]t way to become a favorite with her, was by gratifying a propensity which in general was directed to laudable objects. I was charmed with her artle[s]s thir[s]t for knowledge, and employed my lei[s]ure moments in in[s]tructing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] her. But thought eager to learn, that very eagerne[s]s counteracted her wi[s]hes. She was too ha[s]ty and impetuous to allow her[s]elf [s]ufficient time to become a proficient in any thing; therefore all my attention could do, was to give her a trifling knowledge of the Spani[s]h language. For when I [s]poke to her of the cu[s]toms and manners of the European world, [s]he would laugh, and declare her own country manners were be[s]t; for [s]he could not po[s][s]ibly think any duty obliged us to conceal our thoughts, or that any custom whatever could make it laudable to [s]peak one thing and think another. I give you this [s]light [s]ketch of her character, that you might not be [s]urpri[s]ed at what I have to relate concerning this Indian heroine. It was about ten days after my arrival, as I was walking a few miles from the plantation, and remarking the improvement agriculture had made on the face of this beautiful fertile continent, when in a low-built hovel I [s]aw an ancient Indian [s]eated on the ground; his elbows re[s]ted on his knees, his hands cla[s]ped his forehead, as his head reclined upon them. I [s]topped for a moment to contemplate a figure [s]o [s]triking; and as I pau[s]ed, the [s]ighs that broke from his agitated bo[s]om, went to my very heart. The noi[s]e I undesignedly made as I moved neaxer the hovel, occa[s]ioned him to rai[s]e his head. I was amazed; it was the father of Bruna! He gazed for a moment eagerly upon me; then [s]pringing forward, fell on his knees, ki[s][s]ed my hands, my [s]eet, the very hem of my garments. In vain I attempted to rai[s]e him; he pro[s]trated himself on the earth, and laid my hand upon his head, in token of owning me for his ma[s]ter. Pray ri[s]e, my worthy friend, [s]aid I, and tell me what is the meaning of this humiliation? who has cau[s]ed the change I perceive to have taken place in your circum[s]tances? "Chri[s]tians! Chri[s]tians!" replied he with vehemence, gna[s]hing his teeth as he [s]poke, "they have plundered me of my wealth, torn my child from my arms; but you are come, and I [s]hall be revenged." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] The confidence this poor Indian [s]eemed to have in my integrity, filled my eyes with tears. "Yes," [s]aid I, "tell me who has treated you thus barbarou[s]ly; and if I have the power, you [s]hall have ample re[s]titution." "Alas!" cried the old man, "of what avail will be the re[s]titution of my wealth, unle[s]s you can re[s]tore my child, my darling to my arms pure and un[s]potted?" He then informed me that [s]oon after the arrival of Roldan at the [s]ettlement, an entire change took place in the government; vice was tolerated, private property not in the lea[s]t regarded, but every thing [s]ubjected to the lawle[s]s power of the new governor and his favourite. Diego [s]aw Bruna; her beauty kindled in his bo[s]om an unholy flame; he [s]olicited her love and was rejected. He dared attempt her cha[s]tity, and was repul[s]ed with [s]corn. That moment [s]ealed the ruin of her father. Diego complained to Roldan, that the father of Bruna refu[s]ed to [s]ubmit to the Spani[s]h laws, and had even treated him with contempt and deri[s]ion, who had endeavoured to enforce them. Roldan, glad of an opportunity to gratify his ruling pa[s][s]ion, which was avarice, gave ear to the complaint of his favourite; and driving the unoffending Indian from a home he had inherited from his ance[s]tors, [s]eized on all his valuable property, o[s]ten[s]ibly in the name of the Spani[s]h King, but in reality to enrich his own private coffers. Bruna, unknowing to what danger [s]he expo[s]ed herself, and thinking this piece of inju[s]tice was entirely the act of Diego, flew to the governor for redre[s]s. Her tears, her innocent [s]upplications, had no effect on the obdurate heart of Roldan! he inhumanly rejected her [s]uit, detained her per[s]on, and gave her into the power of Diego. This horrid [s]cene was acted but the day before my arrival. "You [s]hall have ju[s]tice, old man," [s]aid I; "come with me." He followed me to the hou[s]e of the governor. At [s]ight of him, Roldan [s]tarted and turned pale; but [s]oon recovering him[s]elf, he a[s]ked him, in a [s]tern voice, what he did there. "He comes for ju[s]tice," [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] [s]aid I, "he comes to demand re[s]titution of his property, of which he has been robbed, and his daughter, who is unju[s]tly detained from him." "The artful wretch has impo[s]ed on you," [s]aid Roldan fiercely, "but go, [s]lave," turning to the Indian, get from my [s]ight, and be thankful your in[s]olence does not co[s]t you your life. I was preparing to reply in a proper manner to this inhuman tyrant, when Bruna ru[s]hed into the apartment, her hair di[s]hevelled her garments di[s]ordered, and her eyes wild with terror. She threw her[s]elf into her father's arms, and gave way to a violent gu[s]h of tears; but the tenderne[s]s that [s]eemed to overcome her was but momentary. She recovered her[s]elf, and rai[s]ing her head, looked round with a kind of [s]ullen dignity. Her eyes met mine. Perceiving [s]he knew me, I offered her my hand, and was proceeding to comfort her; but with a rejecting motion, [s]he put back my pro[s][s]ered hand, and covering her face with both her own, turned from me. I instantly comprehended the extent of the injury [s]he had [s]u[s]tained, and my [s]oul [s]huddered within me. Roldan's agitation was too great to e[s]cape notice; he attempted twice to [s]peak, but words were denied him. His pale countenance betrayed his guilty heart. At length he he[s]itatingly told Bruna, if that was her father, and [s]he had forcibly been detained from him, [s]he was now at liberty to return home. The poor girl [s]tood for a moment the image of mute despair; then rai[s]ing her hands and eyes to heaven, cried, "Home! No! never! Bruna is the daughter of the cha[s]te Lilah, and was in[s]tructed by the wi[s]e precepts of her father, to prize her honour above her life. Their man[s]ion was the dwelling of innocence, piety, and virtue; and never will their wretched daughter carry pollution thither." Then turning toward her father, [s]he made as though [s]he would have embraced him; but with a kind of involuntary [s]hudder, [s]hrunk again from him, and drawing a dagger [s]he had concealed in her bo[s]om, plunged it in her heart. This [s]udden, unexpected event threw the governor and all his attendants into the utmo[s]t confu[s]ion. The [s]ervants, terrified, opened the doors; and a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] concour[s]e of people, Spaniards as well as natives, ru[s]hed in. The bleeding form of the lovely Bruna, the agonizing [s]orrow of her father, acted like a tali[s]man on the minds of the people; and in a few hours the whole [s]ettlement was in a [s]tate of in[s]urrection. Justice! ju[s]tice! was the cry: Deliver up Diego to our power, or we will extirpate the race of Chri[s]tians from among[s]t us. Roldan in this exigence applied to me to quiet the enraged multitude. I [s]poke to them; I promi[s]ed they [s]hould have ample ju[s]tice! I [s]oothed them by [s]peaking of the virtues of Bruna, and execrating the author of her ruin, and con[s]equent death; and at length per[s]uaded them to depart quietly to their homes; a[s][s]uring them that Diego was in confinement, and [s]hould be made to [s]uffer, to the extent of the law, the puni[s]hment due to his crimes. After a day of [s]uch unu[s]ual agitation, I retired to my apartment. Fatigued in body, and di[s]tre[s][s]ed in mind, [s]leep was a [s]tranger to my eyes, and I was ruminating on the be[s]t means to appea[s]e the irritated natives, when a band of Roldan's guards entered my chamber, and arre[s]ted me as a traitor to my king, accu[s]ed me of being di[s]affected to his government, and inflaming the minds of his [s]ubjects in Hi[s]paniola to rebellion. Re[s]i[s]tance or remon[s]trance was vain; they were the tools of arbitrary power, and I [s]ubmitted in [s]ilence. They manacled my hands and feet, and putting a gag in my mouth, conveyed me on board a ve[s][s]el lying in the harbour. Yes, Ferdinando, your father was chained, and [s]ent to his native country as a traitor. As [s]oon as I was on board, and the guard departed, I found, by the motion of the ve[s][s]el, we were under way; the wind was fair, and [s]he left the [s]hores of Hi[s]paniola with rapidity. About two hours after daylight, the captain entered the cabin where I was, and entreated my pardon for having been obliged to act contrary to his inclinations. "I am but a [s]ervant," [s]aid he, "and mu[s]t obey tho[s]e whom the king has [s]et over me. I am ordered to keep you a clo[s]e pri[s]oner till our arrival in Spain; but here I [s]hall dare to tran[s]gre[s]s my orders [s]o far as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] to relea[s]e you from your chains." He then advanced to take off the in[s]ulting badges of my di[s]grace, but I forbid him. "No, Don Sancho," [s]aid I, "if I am guilty, I will [s]uffer the [s]entence my [s]overeign may think proper to pa[s]s on me with re[s]ignation. If I have been unju[s]tly accu[s]ed, to him do I look for redress; into his pre[s]ence will I go, loaded with the[s]e ignominious bonds, and when my innocence is proved, from his hands only will I accept of liberty." Ha[s]ten then, my dear [s]on, on the immediate receipt of this, to my royal mi[s]tre[s]s and patrone[s]s; deliver to her own hand the inclo[s]ed few lines; and [s]hould [s]he conde[s]cend to reque[s]t it, lay the contents of this letter before her. Comfort and con[s]ole your angel mother ere you leave her. Embrace your charming wife for me. Whil[s]t I live, you [s]hare my heart among[s]t you. The [s]trong [s]en[s]e I have of my pre[s]ent injuries, is only for your [s]akes? for of what con[s]equence would the [s]miles or frowns of princes be to me, were not my wife and children to be involved in my di[s]grace, or exalted by my [s]ucce[s]s and honour. Ha[s]ten, my [s]on, after you have fulfilled this commi[s][s]ion, to the arms of your father; come, my brave boy, and by a filial tear heal the angui[s]h, which at pre[s]ent corrodes the heart of COLUMBUS. Retribution. Columbia could only pau[s]e for a moment to wipe off the tears which, [s]pite of her endeavours to [s]uppre[s]s them, would ru[s]h to her eyes. She then proceeded to the next letter. HAD I a conveyance, [s]wift as my own impatience, to forward to my revered mother the joyful tidings of my father's triumph over his enemies, the wings of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] the wind would be too tardy to bear this to your hands. Yes, my dear mother, Columbus, the great, the enterprizing Columbus, is re[s]tored to all his former dignity, and even fre[s]h honours are heaped upon him. But I know you wi[s]h me to be particular; and how can I be more plea[s]ingly employed than in recounting the noble conduct of a father, and obeying the commands of the be[s]t of mothers? When in obedience to my father's mandate I repaired to court, and reque[s]ted an audience with the royal I[s][s]abelle, I was, within a few hours after the rerequest was made, admitted. An unu[s]ual gloom, almost approaching to [s]everity, was ca[s]t over a countenance, which heretofore had only on me beamed [s]miles of benevolence. It chilled me to the heart. I approached with extreme agitation; and, bending one knee to the ground, pre[s]ented the [s]ealed paper which was inclo[s]ed in my father's letter. The queen pau[s]ed for a moment, [s]eemingly irre[s]olute whether or not to break the [s]eal. My agitation increa[s]ed, my knees trembled, my heart beat violently. My di[s]order did not pa[s]s unnoticed. "Calm your fears, Ferdinando," [s]aid Issabelle, as [s]he at length opened the letter; "your father has, it is true, powerful enemies; but if his innocence is apparent, he will ever find in me a [s]teady, powerful friend." I bowed in grateful acknowledgement of her goodne[s]s, and [s]he in [s]ilence peru[s]ed the letter. A crim[s]on glow over[s]pread her face as [s]he read; it [s]eemed the glow of re[s]entment, as folding the paper [s]he unlocked a [s]mall cabinet, and depo[s]ited it among[s]t [s]ome other writings. "You have a letter from Columbus," [s]aid [s]he, "permit me to [s]ee it." I pre[s]ented it. "Go," [s]aid [s]he, taking it from me, "retire in peace; the [s]ucce[s]s of my hero has awakened the envy of tho[s]e who had not courage to follow his example, he has been traduced to the king; but I[s]abelle will not [s]uffer a man, who[s]e merit [s]he e[s]teems and who[s]e cau[s]e [s]he e[s]pou[s]es, to be injured with impunity." Charmed by the[s]e conde[s]cending expre[s][s]ions, I bowed and retired. In about two hours, I received a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] mandate [s]igned by the queen's hand, ordering me to repair immediately to the port, and conduct my injured father to her pre[s]ence. "Take off his chains," were the words, "and let him come to his [s]overeign, attended with all the re[s]pect and honour a man de[s]erves, who, whil[s]t he was adding new territories to our crown, whil[s]t he had it in his power to heap up mines of wealth for his own coffers, forgot not the cau[s]e of humanity, and rather than countenance one act of tyranny, hazarded the di[s]plea[s]ure of his king, the lo[s]s of his fortune, nay even life it[s]elf. But his [s]overeign [s]hall reward him." Her maje[s]ty's own [s]ervants and mules attended my commands; and quick as it was po[s][s]ible, I pur[s]ued my journey, and flew to the arms of my father. Our meeting was beyond de[s]cription. The agitation of his mind had affected his health; his countenance was pale and dejected; his per[s]on neglected. I offered to take off his fetters, [s]hewed him the queen's mandate, but in vain. "I will go to my royal mi[s]tre[s]s," [s]aid he, "but I will go as I am." When he [s]aw the [s]ervants that attended to conduct him---"Poor pageantry, "[s]aid he, "pitiful recompen[s]e for the injuries I have received! No! no! I will have no attendants. I am a di[s]graced man, and will enter the metropolis with as little noi[s]e as po[s][s]ible; ob[s]curity and [s]ilence [s]uits be[s]t with dishonour. But mark me, my [s]on, as my di[s]grace has been public, [s]o [s]hall be my ju[s]tification." There was [s]uch maje[s]ty in his manner, [s]uch fixed re[s]olution in his looks, I dared not oppo[s]e him. I di[s]mi[s][s]ed the retinue that attended; and with only my own [s]ervant, accompanied my father, by the mo[s]t unfrequented roads, to the court of Ferdinand and I[s]abelle. It was about twelve o'clock when we arrived, and orders were given for our immediate admi[s][s]ion. Never [s]hall I forget the countenance of the royal I[s]abelle, when [s]he beheld her hero enter thus encumbered with the te[s]timonies of his di[s]grace. The king and queen were [s]eated at the upper end of the pre[s]ence chamber, attended by many noblemen and cavaliers, tried friends of my father, and [s]ome whom I knew to be his enemies. Columbus entered the door a few [s]teps, then [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] making a full [s]top, bent his knee to the ground, and rai[s]ing his manacled hands, attempted to [s]peak; but pride, re[s]entment, wounded honour, [s]welled his brave heart nearly to bur[s]ting; and, [s]pite of his endeavours to [s]uppre[s]s them, the [s]calding tears rolled down his pale face. It was a reproach more poignant than words could have conveyed. I[s]abelle ro[s]e from her [s]eat, her own eyes gli[s]tening with the dew of [s]en[s]ibility; and advancing to my father, rai[s]ed him. "Ri[s]e, my brave admiral," [s]aid [s]he, "and let thy queen take off the[s]e fetters, of which [s]he has more cau[s]e to be a[s]hamed than you have." Then leading him to the king, "Royal Sir," [s]aid [s]he, "how [s]hall we recompen[s]e this worthy man for the unde[s]erved humiliation he has received?" "Columbus," [s]aid Ferdinand, "I blu[s]h for the indignities offered you in the per[s]on of my repre[s]entative; but you [s]hall have ample revenge. Go to your wife and friends, indulge awhile in ca[s]e, and recruit your [s]trength and [s]pirits; in the mean time, I will give orders for the preparation of a fleet [s]uperior to any you have yet commanded; in it you [s]hall return to our new colonies, of the whole of which I from this moment create you viceroy, giving you unlimited power to create or di[s]place officers, and di[s]tribute rewards and punishments at plea[s]ure. I know it is a power you will not abu[s]e. Go, valiant chief, and reign over a people, whom you have conquered by practi[s]ing humanity, not the arts of war. But take tho[s]e fetters from my [s]ight," continued he; "that Columbus ever wore them, will ca[s]t a la[s]ting [s]hade on my memory; and ages yet unborn, when they [s]hall hear the tale related, will accu[s]e Ferdinand of ingratitude." "Pardon me, gracious [s]ire," [s]aid my father, placing his foot on the chains as one of the guards attempted to remove them; "the[s]e fetters are mine. I purcha[s]ed them with fatigue and danger, went through many perils by [s]ea and land to obtain them, nor will I lightly part with them. Wherever I go, they [s]hall go with me; I will contemplate them every day, le[s]t pro[s]perity [s]hould make me forget, on what a frail [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] tenure I hold my happine[s]s. I will look at them; and whil[s]t I recollect the angui[s]h I felt when they were imposed on me, learn to be cautious how I attempt to inflict the [s]ame mi[s]ery on a fellow creature. When I am unhappy, I will cheer my heart by the remembrance, that the moment when my royal mi[s]tre[s]s took the[s]e fetters off my hands, was the mo[s]t tran[s]porting moment of my life; for it rein[s]tated me in the good opinion of my [s]overeign, gave my friends cau[s]e for exultation, and covered my enemies with con[s]u[s]ion." Ferdinand was [s]ilent. I[s]abelle [s]miled; it was a [s]mile of triumph. "You mu[s]t do as you plea[s]e," [s]aid [s]he. Then turning to the guard, "convey them to wherever Columbus orders; his intrepid [s]pirit can convert even fetters into badges of di[s]tinction." Their maje[s]ties then left the chamber followed by the court, and in a moment I was locked in the arms of my father, and mingled with him [s]ome of the mo[s]t delicious tears I ever [s]hed. Tell my lovely Orrabella, in a few hours after [s]he receives this, I [s]hall be at her feet. Yes, my revered mother, I [s]hall behold once more all the deare[s]t objects of my affections united in one family circle. I [s]hall [s]ee your dear countenance beam with heartfelt [s]atisfaction; [s]ee my father happy in the bo[s]om of his family; and in the [s]miles of my Orrabella and her [s]weet infant, enjoy every felicity of which human nature is capable. Farewel till we meet. FERDINANDO. The next paper Columbia opened had the appearance more of a manu[s]cript than a letter. It con[s]i[s]ted of [s]everal [s]heets of paper wrote on all [s]ides; it was from the wife of Columbus, addre[s][s]ed to her granddaughter I[s]abelle. -  1520. AS the peru[s]al of the inclo[s]ed letters and papers will no doubt awaken in the bo[s]om of my dear I[s]abelle, a curio[s]ity to learn the events that followed this triumph of Columbus over his enemies; and as I think [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] it nece[s][s]ary to inform her, not only of her de[s]cent from the native kings of Peru, but al[s]o of the [s]ate of her parents, who now, alas! are no more, I have taken up my pen to trace every circum[s]tance that may tend to prove your right to the [s]overeignty of Quito, and the [s]urrounding territories, if hereafter you [s]hould think it worth contending for. But as I leave you, my dear child, in the protection of my own family; and am fully [s]en[s]ible that my nephew, the marquis Guidova, will take [s]uch care of your fortune, (now ample) that by the time you are of age to peru[s]e the[s]e papers, you will be one of the riche[s]t heire[s][s]es in Spain; I fondly hope you will not [s]uffer the vain ambition of bearing the empty title of queen to influence your conduct, or tempt you to throw away the real ble[s][s]ings of life in pur[s]uit of [s]hadows and toys. I am old, my dear I[s]abelle, and have lived to bury all my deare[s]t affections in the [s]ilent grave, except the kindly lambent flame that warms my languid heart when I behold your innocent [s]miles, and li[s]ten to your lively prattle. You are now [s]carcely five years old; I cannot therefore expect to live to [s]ee you enter on the bu[s]y [s]tage of life. Let me entreat you then (and think, as you peru[s]e this, your grandmother [s]peaks to you from the grave) let me entreat you to pay the [s]tricte[s]t attention to the advice of your uncle and his amiable wife. Certain I am, they will never impo[s]e har[s]h commands; and to them I leave the full power of controlling and directing you during the dangerous period of youth. One thing I think it proper you [s]hould know, in the choice of a partner for life, (though I would wi[s]h you to con[s]ult tho[s]e dear friends,) you are entirely your own mi[s]tre[s]s. At the age of 21, your fortune will be put in your own power; but, I[s]abelle, remember the royal race from whence you [s]prang, and do not di[s]grace it by an ignoble alliance. It is not wealth, it is not titles, I would have you [s]eek! no, my child; [s]eek courage, honour, good [s]en[s]e, and poli[s]hed manners. The[s]e con[s]titute true nobility; it was the[s]e [s]o eminently [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] di[s]tingui[s]hed the great Columbus; made him the delight of our [s]ex, the envy of his own. I [s]ay you are your own mi[s]tre[s]s; in every point but one you are [s]o. I charge you, I[s]abelle, as you value your eternal peace, unite not your fate with that of a heretic. Should you unhappily feel a growing inclination for one of tho[s]e impious innovators on the rights and ceremonies of our holy mother church, repel it with your utmo[s]t power; for in that ca[s]e your guardian has my authority peremptorily to refu[s]e his sanction to your union. And [s]hould you form [s]uch a connexion in defiance of his ab[s]olute commands, your fortune, on the in[s]tant of your marriage, becomes forfeit, and will go to the marquis's elde[s]t [s]on. My wi[s]hes to [s]ee you not only temporally but eternally happy, have led me to make this point indi[s]putable; but I tru[s]t it is a needle[s]s caution, [s]ince you will be brought up in the true religion, in the religion of your ance[s]tors; and will feel a ju[s]t abhorrence for tho[s]e licentious wretches, who arrogantly [s]tyle them[s]elves reformers. Of all the European courts, none are [s]o infe[s]ted with this [s]ect as the Engli[s]h. Beware, then; and when you behold a gay, accompli[s]hed Englishman, and many [s]uch vi[s]it the court of Spain, before you venture too nearly to contemplate his [s]eeming virtues and graces, [s]ay within your[s]elf, May not this man be tinctured with the principles I am cautioned to avoid? Think thus, avoid him, and be happy. Return to the new World. " Alas ," [s]aid Columbia, laying down the paper, "I now [s]ee the [s]ource from whence [s]prang all my dear mother's [s]orrow. She was bred in the Catholic per[s]ua[s]ion, and my father tempted her to di[s]obey the rigid commands of her guardian, forfeit her fortune, embrace his faith, and, leaving all her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] connexions in Spain, follow him to England. Poor, bigoted Beatina, little did you think, when making your will, that you [s]igned the mandate for your grandchild's mi[s]ery. For what might not avarice tempt the [s]on of the marquis Guidova to do? Might not he wink at a marriage that was to inve[s]t him with all the va[s]t wealth of the unfortunate I[s]abelle? But perhaps I injure him; he may be innocent of [s]uch an intention; my mi[s]guided parents them[s]elves may be alone to blame. Yet knowing and adoring them as I do, how can I believe that po[s][s]ible?" Thus was Columbia bewildered with conjecture. At length, thinking the manu[s]cript might [s]ati[s]fy her curio[s]ity, and remove her doubts, [s]he again addre[s][s]ed her[s]elf to the peru[s]al of it. "It was the beginning of the year 1500, that the great Columbus embarked on board the fleet which Ferdinand had ordered to be equipped for his [s]ervice, (with all the attendance, ceremonies, &c. cu[s]tomary on [s]uch occa[s]ions,) as viceroy of the new-di[s]covered continent. Ferdinando was appointed governor of the [s]ettlements in Peru. My[s]elf, the prince[s]s Orrabella, and her [s]on Chri[s]topher, embarked with them. The king, queen, and all the court attended us to the water [s]ide; a va[s]t concour[s]e of people crowded the [s]hore, wearying Heaven with prayers for our happine[s]s whil[s]t ab[s]ent, and our [s]afe return. At parting from his augu[s]t patrone[s]s, Columbus knelt to ki[s]s her hand. She rai[s]ed him, and throwing a gold chain over his neck, by which her own portrait was [s]u[s]pended, "Go, my invincible hero," [s]aid [s]he, "go, and enjoy the reward of your labours. And if we never meet again on this [s]ide eternity, let my memory ever be dear to you; for whil[s]t you live, Columbus, you will never find a truer friend than you have found in I[s]abelle." As [s]he [s]ini[s]hed [s]peaking, [s]he inclined her head towards him; he re[s]pecfully [s]aluted her cheek. "Heaven ever ble[s]s and defend my royal mi[s]tre[s]s and her augu[s]t con[s]ort," [s]aid Columbus. "And protect my hero," added the queen. Then turning ha[s]tily to hide her tears, [s]he ru[s]hed into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] the mid[s]t of her attendants, and retired. Yes, my child, the good, the noble-hearted, royal I[s]abelle retired; and we [s]aw her no more. Before we returned, [s]he [s]lept in peace; but her name [s]hall be revered to after ages. The brave and worthy will remember it with gratitude; and the pious tears of millions yet unborn, [s]hall [s]anctify her memory to all eternity. "It was determined at our departure, that the whole fleet [s]hould accompany Ferdinando and Orrabella to her native coa[s]t; and having [s]een him [s]afely [s]ettled in his government, proceed to Hi[s]paniola, and [s]end Roldan and his licentious a[s][s]ociates home in the [s]ame di[s]graceful circum[s]tances in which he had before ungratefully involved Columbus. A fine [s]ea[s]on favoured our voyage; and in le[s]s than two months from our embarkation, we [s]aw the fertile [s]hores of Peru ri[s]e upon our [s]ight. The joy of Orrabella as [s]he beheld her native land was beyond all bounds. "I [s]hall [s]ee my father and mother," [s]aid [s]he, "and embrace my dear [s]i[s]ters; I [s]hall [s]it be[s]ide them for hours, and relate to them the wonders I have [s]een in your world; and only that they know my lips abhor fal[s]ehood, they would think [s]ome of the [s]trange things I have to relate were nothing more than fictions. Then care[s][s]ing her child, [s]he would talk of the joy of her father's [s]ubjects when they [s]hould behold her offspring, whom [s]he fully believed was born to [s]way the [s]ceptre of Peru. "It was on the [s]econd day after we had di[s]covered land, that we reached the de[s]ired harbour. But as we drew near no [s]houts of joy welcomed our approach; no king, no guards, no exulting [s]ubjects appeared to greet us. All was [s]ilent, all was de[s]olate. Our hearts [s]unk within us. "They are at Quito," [s]aid Orrabella; but her pallid countenance and tremulous voice betrayed that [s]he hardly dared hope what [s]he a[s][s]erted. "We will land, however," [s]aid Columbus; accordingly the boat was hoi[s]ted out, and we proceeded to the [s]hore. When within a few yards of the beach, a party of armed men appeared. Their dre[s]s, their arms, be[s]poke them Spaniards. Our fleet bore the [s]tandard of Spain, we could not fear our countrymen as foes. Columbus [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] addre[s][s]ed them from the boat in terms of amity; they returned a haughty an[s]wer. However, they permitted us to land. But Oh! I[s]abelle, what were our feelings, when we di[s]covered this beautiful continent had been invaded by a party of freebooters; its ho[s]pitable inhabitants rifled of all their trea[s]ures, many of them ma[s][s]acred, and the remainder driven into the interior parts of the country. The palace of Orrozombo was converted into a den for the[s]e robbers, where riot and intemperance reigned without control. The [s]ettlers left by Columbus, adhering to the intere[s]t of the king and natives, were driven with them to [s]eek an a[s]ylum in the woods and mountains. The chief of the[s]e banditti was named Garcias, fierce, cruel and vindictive. He received Columbus with a gloomy haughtine[s]s of demeanor, and when que[s]tioned as to his right in the[s]e dominions, he scornfully replied, "By the right of conque[s]t; not by a ridiculous family compact with a [s]avage." Orrabella was pre[s]ent when Garcias thus in[s]ulted her family. "In[s]olent Spaniard," [s]aid [s]he, her eyes darting lightning, her fine face and per[s]on uncommonly animated by the fire of re[s]entment; "in[s]olent Spaniard, the king my father, though you term him a [s]avage, was your [s]uperior in every virtue! What though unpolished, he had but nature for his guide? that nature taught him humanity, honour, patience, fortitude, and Orrozombo would have died rather than deceive a friend, or in[s]ult a fallen foe. Oh my father! my father!" continued [s]he, bur[s]ting into an agony of tears, "where are you now? Where is my revered mother, my poor defencele[s]s [s]i[s]ters? Tell me, barbarian, have you entirely extirpated the race of the children of the [s]un, or do you hold the lawful king of this territory in bondage, whil[s]t you u[s]urp his rights, and riot in the [s]poils of his devoted [s]ubjects? If [s]o, Oh lead me to the dungeon where you have confined him, that I may weep in his arms, and die with grief to [s]ee my king, my father, a [s]lave to the nation he had vainly hoped to have held in eternal bonds of friend[s]hip, and gave his child as a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] ho[s]tage of his faith towards them. Alas! what ho[s]tage did he require to in[s]ure their faith to him? None; his noble heart harboured not deceit, nor could [s]u[s]pect it in another." From the[s]e pathetic remon[s]trances and lamentations of Orrabella, we perceived [s]he [s]u[s]pected Columbus and Ferdinando were knowing to the voyage and consequent inva[s]ion of Garcias and his lawle[s]s band; but in this [s]he was [s]oon undeceived. For Columbus, irritated by the in[s]olence of Garcias, threatened him with [s]peedy vengeance unle[s]s he informed him where Orrozombo and the royal family were. Garcias laughed at his menaces, but on being informed that Columbus was deputed viceroy of all the new-di[s]covered lands on that [s]ide the globe, and being reque[s]ted to do homage to him as the repre[s]entative of his royal ma[s]ter Ferdinand, or expect the puni[s]hment due to a pirate, a traitor and a robber, he became more humble, and many of his followers, under[s]tanding the dangerous predicament in which they [s]tood, declared them[s]elves ready to [s]upport the new viceroy in the di[s]charge of his duty as the king's delegate, and as [s]uch [s]wore allegiance to him. It was then we learnt that Garcias Du Ponty, a Castilian by birth, young, di[s][s]olute and ambitious, having heard of the [s]ucce[s]s of Columbus, and the va[s]t trea[s]ures him[s]elf and followers had brought from the new world, re[s]olved to make an experiment him[s]elf; and having, by promi[s]es of large future reward, and [s]ome rich presents artfully be[s]towed, won over an experienced mariner (who had been the la[s]t voyage with your grandfather, and returned in the [s]hip with Orrabella) to undertake to navigate his ve[s][s]el, and give directions to the pilots of the re[s]t of the fleet how to follow him; Garcias prevailed on a number of young Ca[s]tilian noblemen and gentlemen to embark on the expedition. They applied for no letters of leave from Ferdinand; for had they, it is mo[s]t probable they would have been prevented pur[s]uing this (in the end) ruinous voyage. A large fleet collected from the different ports of Spain, met in the Mediterranean [s]ea many other [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] mariners who wi[s]hed to pur[s]ue their good fortune, and, not being content to wait till another fleet [s]hould be [s]ent out by the king's orders, were eager to embark with the[s]e licentious noblemen, and direct their cour[s]e to the land where they imagined they were to become petty princes, and revel in all the luxuries which nature could afford, or unbounded wealth [s]upply. This fleet was on the ocean at the time Columbus returned from Hi[s]paniola. They had a more [s]peedy voyage than their inhuman de[s]igns de[s]erved; but Heaven often permits the wicked for a while to prosper, that the [s]ucce[s]s of their lawle[s]s plans may become their puni[s]hment, and the rever[s]e of fortune coming unexpected, may fall the heavier on them. And thus it proved with Garcias Du Ponty and his followers. On their arrival on the coa[s]t of Peru, they found the king with his family, as was their cu[s]tom, spending the [s]ummer at their palace on the banks of a river that mingles its waters with the ocean. Garcias and his party landed. Orrozombo, and indeed the Spanish [s]ettlers, believed them to be a party [s]ent by Columbus to bring [s]upplies to the colony, and received them with open arms and every mark of affection. But alas, they were too fatally undeceived, when the[s]e invaders of the rights of nature and the law of nations a[s][s]umed the authority of ma[s]ters, exacting enormous [s]ums as tribute from the king, and forcing his [s]ubjects to labour in the mines, often rewarding tho[s]e labours (when the produce of them was not equal to the inordinate avarice of their de[s]ires) with death. Orrozombo, wearied by their repeated in[s]olence, and terrified by their rapacity, entreated them to leave the continent, offering them immen[s]e trea[s]ures. But they were not thus to be [s]atisfied. They proceeded from one [s]tep to another, till neither age nor [s]ex became a [s]afeguard from their cruelties. The cha[s]te wife and the pure virgin were violated in the pre[s]ence of their parents and protectors, who, confined by the[s]e inhuman mon[s]ters, had not the power to re[s]cue or avenge them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] Human nature, however patient, could not tamely endure [s]uch enormities. The natives and the Spaniards united their forces to endeavour to expel the invaders; but it was too late. They had [s]ent a part of their company to [s]earch the interior country for mines. The[s]e returned, boa[s]ting of the ravages they had commited, and di[s]playing the [s]poils they had gleaned. They had plundered every village through which they pa[s][s]ed, and then [s]et fire to it. Thou[s]ands of innocent families, thus deprived of their homes and all means of [s]upport, fled into the mountains, where many peri[s]hed through famine, and the re[s]t dragged on a wretched life, living on wild fruit, and what game their bows and arrows produced, [s]leeping in caves or rece[s][s]es of the rocks, and too often their mi[s]erable existence was terminated by the fangs of the tyger or the lion. Flu[s]hed with [s]ucce[s]s, the Ca[s]tilians meditated only how to make an entire conque[s]t of the country. Undi[s]ciplined in the arts of war, and though experiencing its effect every hour, [s]till un[s]u[s]pecting of treachery,--- the Peruvians were at this time, by the art of the Spaniards, induced to throw a[s]ide their arms, and agree to terms of peace with Garcias, who a[s][s]umed a graver demeanor, and made [s]ome [s]light conce[s][s]ions to Orrozombo for the mi[s]conduct of his companions, who by a few weeks of quiet regular behaviour lulled him into [s]ecurity; then, when in full confidence of the faith of their enemies, the Peruvians, who had been celebrating the annual fea[s]t of the [s]un at which the[s]e [s]trangers had been admitted to participate; then, when parting from them in amity they tranquilly [s]unk to re[s]t; then did the blood-thir[s]ty Garcias and his dete[s]ted crew ru[s]h on the defencele[s]s victims, and ma[s][s]acre them without mercy and without remor[s]e. Oh thou Power eternal, who[s]e name is a tower of [s]trength, and who[s]e mercy is as infinite as thy wi[s]dom! what [s]hall we [s]ay, that the[s]e barbarians [s]hould call them[s]elves thy [s]ervants, and bear the glorious appellation of Chri[s]tians? Alas, mi[s]taken men, the God you [s]erve delighteth not in blood; his precept and example taught peace, mercy and good will to all mankind. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] But the Peruvians were idolaters! cries the mi[s]guided enthu[s]ia[s]t; and [s]o was Garcias and his followers; their idols were avarice, ambition, luxury, and lawle[s]s passion; to them they bent the knee, and on their altars did they [s]acrifice millions of innocent people.---But I digre[s]s. Du Ponty, though the wretch his actions proclaim him, was hand[s]ome in his per[s]on, gay, lively and gallant; his fair out[s]ide attracted the notice of Alzira, the younge[s]t [s]i[s]ter of Orrabella. Alzira was equally lovely as her [s]i[s]ter, but [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed not that greatne[s]s of [s]oul, that intrepid firmne[s]s which characterized your mother. By nature [s]oft, gentle and complying, when the [s]ubtle Ca[s]tilian, who read her pa[s][s]ion in her admiring eyes, [s]ued for [s]ome token of her favour, [s]he hesitated not to own her love, and confe[s]s, could her father be brought to approve it, to be the wife of Du Ponty would con[s]titute her chief felicity. But Garcias had not an idea of an honourable union; he meant to conquer her father's kingdom; and had it in contemplation to degrade the fair Alzira to the [s]tation of a [s]lave, for the amu[s]ement of his loo[s]er hours. On the night of the horrid ma[s][s]acre, Garcias was purpo[s]ely in the apartment of the prince[s]s, where he was frequently privately admitted after her parents were retired to re[s]t. Alzira, who was listening to the adulating voice of her lover, did not at fir[s]t attend to the confu[s]ed murmur that ran through the palace on the entrance of the Spaniards; but a [s]udden [s]hriek, that [s]eemed to come from the apartment of her mother, rou[s]ed her dormant [s]en[s]es. She [s]tarted, and would have run to the a[s][s]i[s]tance of her parents, whom [s]he imagined were [s]uddenly taken ill, but reiterated [s]hrieks which now i[s][s]ued from every room in the palace, made her pau[s]e, and [s]he became a motionle[s]s [s]tatue of horror. "The palace is be[s]et," cried Garcias, "let me bear you, lovely Alzira, to a place of [s]afety; I will then return to the a[s][s]i[s]tance of your father." "Oh no! now, now re[s]cue him, or let me die with him," was all [s]he could [s]ay, before Du Ponty bore her in his arms, out of the chamber, and down the [s]tairs. At the foot of the[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] [s]tairs [s]he [s]aw (by the light of torches which were every where flaming round) her father dragged by the hair of his head; whil[s]t an inhuman wretch, regardle[s]s of his grey hairs and defencele[s]s [s]tate, plunged a poniard in his bo[s]om. Alzira, driven almo[s]t to madne[s]s at the [s]ight, [s]prang from the arms of Garcias, and threw herself into tho[s]e of the dying monarch. He knew his child, pre[s][s]ed her to his bo[s]om, faintly articulated a blessing on her, and expired. Alzira's [s]en[s]es for[s]ook her. In that [s]tate [s]he was borne to the tent of her betrayer. The [s]cene that followed is too horrid for repetition! Morning dawned, and the ill-fated prince[s]s awoke to a perfect [s]en[s]e of all the mi[s]eries of her [s]ituation. She wi[s]hed for death, but all means of accelerating that period was removed from her. She once conceived the thought of refu[s]ing all food, but had not re[s]olution to per[s]i[s]t. Garcias was attentive and kind; pretended to mourn with her the fate of her parents: She, not fully acquainted with his treachery, li[s]tened to his [s]oothings, was con[s]oled, and endured life for his [s]ake. But uninterrupted po[s][s]e[s][s]ion brought on [s]atiety, and at length indifference and disgust. Du Ponty neglected and treated her har[s]hly. She felt her [s]ituation, but [s]he was now a mother, and more than ever attached to the father of her child; [s]he dragged on a wretched exi[s]tence, without joy, without hope, without even a dawn of comfort. The natives of Peru who had e[s]caped the [s]words of the Ca[s]tilians on that memorable night, failed not to attribute their misfortunes to their unhappy [s]overeign Orrozombo; he had been [s]lack in the ob[s]ervance of [s]ome of the ceremonious devotions directed to be paid to their deity, the Sun; he had even doubted whether their religion was the true religion; he had refu[s]ed to dedicate one of his daughters to the [s]ervice of their god; he had married the heire[s]s of his crown and kingdom to a [s]tranger, who ab[s]olutely denied the divinity of the power they wor[s]hipped, and called their rites and ceremonies, ab[s]urdities and [s]uper[s]titions; and had [s]uffered this [s]tranger to carry her with him to a di[s]tant land. The[s]e, in the eyes of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] unenlightened Peruvians, were heinous offences, and had drawn down the wrath of their deity upon them; and thus, for the crimes of an individual, did they fooli[s]hly imagine a whole nation was puni[s]hed. It was at this period our fleet arrived, but the name of Spaniard and of Chri[s]tian had become hateful to the ears of the natives; not one therefore appeared to espouse the cau[s]e of Columbus, imagining no doubt that they [s]hould but expel one tyrant to make room for another. Some few ventured by [s]tealth to come and [s]ee their prince[s]s; but their [s]pirits were depre[s][s]ed, and their expre[s][s]ions of love and duty con[s]equently cold and languid. When [s]he pre[s]ented her [s]on to them as their rightful king, they would [s]hake their heads, and cry emphatically, "He is a Chri[s]tian and a Spaniard." Whil[s]t Columbus was ardently labouring to reduce the Spaniards to [s]ome degree of [s]ubjection and order, at the [s]ame time [s]triving to draw the natives back to the duty and allegiance they owed the prince[s]s, the treacherous Du Ponty, who had for [s]ome time worn the ma[s]k of friend[s]hip in combination with [s]ome of the leaders of the banditti, had laid an infernal plot to burn our fleet, and then, having the few that might at the time be on [s]hore entirely in their power, oblige them to [s]ubmit to whatever terms they plea[s]ed to offer. But this plot was providentially di[s]covered by a young Peruvian maid, who, detained in the palace by Garcias to attend on Alzira, though too young to become a prey to any of his officers or a[s][s]ociates, was yet old enough to dete[s]t their actions, weep over the ruin of her native country, and pray for [s]ome propitious hour to arrive, when its enemies might be puni[s]hed. She had overheard Du Ponty di[s]cour[s]ing with one of his comrades on their intended plan, on the very night before it was to be put in execution; and, waiting till all was wrapt in [s]ilence, [s]he [s]tole from her apartment, and came to our tent. Having di[s]clo[s]ed what knowledge [s]he had obtained of their de[s]igns, Orrabella told her [s]he [s]hould [s]tay with us, and become one of her attendants; but [s]he laid her hand on her heart and cried, "No! I cannot;" then looking [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] earnestly in the face of the prince[s]s, [s]he cried, "Poor Alzira! [s]he is alive; [s]he is mi[s]erable! I will live or die with her." "Alive! my [s]i[s]ter alive!" [s]aid Orrabella, [s]tarting from her [s]eat; lead me to her; I will deliver her, or [s]hare her fate." The impatience of the prince[s]s was only to be [s]tayed by the remon[s]trance of her hu[s]band and his father. "Your precipitancy, my love," cried Ferdinando, "may ruin all. Our enemies are now wrapt in [s]leep; the time is favourable; we mu[s]t repay treachery with treachery; fall upon them whil[s]t they are unprepared, and make them pri[s]oners." This re[s]olution taken, Ferdinando took a [s]mall boat, and, going to the [s]hips, ordered from them a number of men, who were landed at different times, in [s]everal boats. The officers were informed of Garcias's intended treachery; the private [s]oldiers and [s]ailors were not told of it, left the [s]pirit of revenge might be more powerful than the re[s]pect they bore their commander, and tempt them in the fir[s]t moment of pa[s][s]ion to commit outrages at which they would have cau[s]e to blu[s]h hereafter. Columbus di[s]patched parties to the dwellings of the principal officers; the[s]e parties he took the command of him[s]elf. Ferdinando was appointed with a [s]trong guard to inve[s]t the palace, which Du Ponty had made his own re[s]idence ever [s]ince the night, when he put its unoffending inmates to the [s]word. Ferdinando knew every apartment, every [s]ecret room in it; and the private entrance by which the ill-fated Alzira u[s]ed to admit her lover, was pointed out by the Indian girl. No per[s]ua[s]ions, however urgent, could prevail on Orrabella not to accompany her hu[s]band, who, anxious for her [s]afety, and more [s]o on account of her [s]ituation, (for [s]he almo[s]t daily expected to pre[s]ent him with another pledge of mutual affection) earne[s]tly entreated her not to go, promi[s]ing to conduct her sister in [s]afety to her---but in vain. Orrabella was not ea[s]ily to be per[s]uaded from doing what [s]he conceived a duty. As I found her determined to go, I resolved to accompany her. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] Through a [s]mall gate, at the utmo[s]t extent of the garden, we were all admitted, and about twenty yards from the hou[s]e entered a door that appeared to be fixed in the [s]ide of a green [s]loping bank; this opened into an arched pa[s][s]age, which led to the cellars of the palace, which we traver[s]ed with no little perturbation; and, a[s]cending a flight of [s]tairs, found our[s]elves in a [s]pacious hall; when the young Indian, taking hold of Orrabella's hand, led her to the left, placing her [s]inger on her mouth, in token of [s]ilence. I followed; and, entering a room in the mid[s]t of which glimmered a pale lamp, perceived by its [s]eeble beams, an elegant female habited in the Peruvian dre[s]s, kneeling on the floor be[s]ide a bed, on which lay a [s]leeping infant. Her long hair hung negligently over her neck and [s]houlders; her arms were cro[s][s]ed on the bed, and her head re[s]ted between them. At the moment we entered, her [s]orrows were lulled into forgetfulne[s]s. At the noi[s]e we made, (though it would have been [s]carcely perceptible to another ear, yet mi[s]ery is wakeful, and [s]tarts at every [s]ound) [s]he rai[s]ed her languid head, gazed earne[s]tly at Orrabella, who [s]unk on her knees be[s]ide her. "Si[s]ter! [s]i[s]ter!" [s]aid [s]he; and, throwing her[s]elf into her arms, fainted on her bo[s]om. Whil[s]t we were bu[s]ied with Alzira, Ferdinando and his followers made good u[s]e of their time. The inhabitants of the ca[s]tle were in a deep [s]leep, partly the effects of intemperance; [s]o profound were their slumbers, that many of them felt the chains on their hands and feet, before they could recover [s]en[s]e [s]ufficient to know who had put them on. Some few made a faint re[s]i[s]tance; but the[s]e were [s]oon intimidated into silence; and in [s]uch quiet did every party proceed, that before the dawn of day all the leaders, and a great number of their followers, were in confinement, and at the mercy of Columbus. In the morning, the incidents of the night [s]pread terror and con[s]ternation through all the Ca[s]tilian party; and tho[s]e who were [s]till at liberty, readily vowed [s]ubmi[s][s]ion to the viceroy, in hopes by [s]o doing to secure their lives and fortunes, as they imagined Du [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] Ponty and his officers would be immediately executed, and their trea[s]ures [s]eized on as public property. But in this they were mi[s]taken; Columbus wi[s]hed to [s]ecure his own and followers lives and properties, but he did not arrogate to him[s]elf the right of plunging a multitude of human beings into eternity, becau[s]e they oppo[s]ed his plans, or had been blindly led by an unprincipled commander to perpetrate actions their better rea[s]on would have [s]huddered at. During the remainder of this eventful night, Alzira informed her [s]i[s]ter of the circum[s]tances I have already related to you. Orrabella's [s]oul was in a flame at the thought of her [s]i[s]ter's di[s]honour. She fini[s]hed her melancholy recital in the[s]e words; "When I heard of your arrival, my dear [s]i[s]ter, a gleam of joy [s]hot through my bo[s]om; but reflection told me I had little rea[s]on to rejoice, for I was di[s]honoured, [s]tained! and could I hope to be pre[s][s]ed to the cha[s]te bo[s]om of Orrabella? Oh no! I knew I had for[s]eited all right to your affection, and I re[s]olved [s]edulou[s]ly to [s]eclude my[s]elf from your [s]ight, [s]uffering you to believe I had been [s]acrificed on the [s]ame night with my parents and [s]i[s]ters." "Would to Heaven you had," [s]aid Orrabella, fervently; "for it is a thou[s]and times more afflicting to my heart to [s]ee you thus, dragging on a mi[s]erable life, with public lo[s]s of honour, than to [s]ee you covered with wounds, and breathing out your [s]oul in agony. Oh! my poor ruined Alzira, where was the [s]pirit that was wont to animate the children of the [s]un when the wretch fir[s]t di[s]clo[s]ed his impious propo[s]al? Why had not my [s]i[s]ter rai[s]ed her arm, and [s]truck the mon[s]ter dead?" "Alas!" replied the weeping prince[s]s, "I loved him with [s]uch enthu[s]ia[s]tic fervour, that I would have given my own life to pre[s]erve his. And pity me, Orrabella; for cruel as he has been to me and mine, I [s]till do love him almo[s]t to madne[s]s. I [s]truggle with my pa[s][s]ion, I [s]trive to teach my heart obedience to the dictates of rea[s]on; but in vain." "Weak, unhappy girl," cried Orrabelia, with a [s]tern look, "if your heart is [s]o refractory, en[s]orce its obedience with this;" pre[s]enting her with a dagger, which [s]he always wore in her girdle. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] "Ra[s]h woman," [s]aid I, [s]natching the dagger from her, ju[s]t as the trembling Alzira had extended her hand to receive it; "ra[s]h woman, what is it you do? Have you forgot that the precepts of the Chri[s]tian religion forbid [s]elf-de[s]truction?" "So, ([s]he replied haughtily) does it forbid murder, rapine, fraud, perjury, and oppression. Du Ponty, I think, profe[s][s]es Chri[s]tianity. Oh! madam! madam! the profe[s][s]ors of your religion mu[s]t practife them[s]elves what they would teach others, before you can hope to make [s]incere converts." The argument was unan[s]werable, and I remained [s]ilent. Tranquillity was now in a great mea[s]ure re[s]tored; it was re[s]olved the leaders of this lawle[s]s expedition [s]hould be [s]ent immediately home to Spain. Tho[s]e of their followers, who cho[s]e to [s]ubmit to the laws put in force by the viceroy and governor, were to be permitted to [s]tay; and when all was e[s]tabli[s]hed with [s]ome degree of permanency, your grandfather was to depart for Hi[s]paniola. But whil[s]t we were laying the[s]e plans, it plea[s]ed Heaven, by an awful and unexpected visitation, to break our mea[s]ures, and ha[s]ten our departure from a coa[s]t, where, from our fir[s]t landing, we had been [s]urrounded only by terror, vexation and disappointment. Beatina's Narrative continued. Whilst preparations were making for two of the fleet to return to Europe, that Garcias and his followers might, from the ju[s]tice of a regular court of judicature, receive their [s]entence, your mother pre[s]ented Ferdinando with a daughter, who (by promi[s]e given to the queen of Spain on our leaving that kingdom) was chri[s]tened Ifabelle. It received the bapti[s]mal benediction when but four days old; for the di[s]tre[s]s of mind under which your mother [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] had laboured, had affected the health of the infant, and its life was very doubtful. It was nearly a fortnight from the birth of this daughter, when as Alzira, your father, and my[s]elf, were [s]itting in the apartment of Orrabella, an unu[s]ual drow[s]ine[s]s [s]eemed to affect us all. The atmo[s]phere had been for [s]ome days heavy and oppre[s][s]ive, which at this time had increa[s]ed to [s]uch degree as to occasion [s]omething like a [s]en[s]e of [s]uffocation; the heat too was inten[s]e, though in general the climate is temperate and plea[s]ant. A torpor [s]eized our [s]en[s]es, and we [s]at gazing at each other, without power to [s]peak, and with fearce the faculty of thinking. From this [s]tupor we were arou[s]ed by a tremendous noi[s]e, like the howling of a mighty wind, the ru[s]hing of waters, and the cra[s]h of thunder. In a moment the palace [s]hook to its foundation, and in le[s]s than ten minutes all was again profound [s]ilence. "One [s]hock is pa[s]t," cried Alzira, in breathle[s]s agony; "another, and all is lo[s]t. Oh Garcias! beloved Garcias! let me [s]ave you whil[s]t I can." She caught up her child, who was playing on the floor, and ru[s]hed toward the wing of the palace where Du Ponty was confined. Ferdinando, who had learnt from his wife the nature of the[s]e convul[s]ions of the earth, caught her in his arms; and bidding me ha[s]te and follow him, bore her with precipitation from the palace. The two children, Chriftopher and I[s]abelle, were in an adjoining apartment with their attendants. I ran to the door in hopes to [s]natch them from impending death, when the hou[s]e again began to totter. I [s]aw the apartment fall that held the precious babes, and heard their cries as they were cru[s]hed beneath the ruins. At that moment, my [s]on, who had borne his wife to an open field, returned, and carried me through the falling fabric, which nodded horror on every fide, to the [s]ame place of comparative [s]afety. Two hours of [s]uch tremendous threatenings from gleaming meteors, bur[s]ts of thunder, and contortions of the earth, as could hardly be [s]upported by human nature, we pa[s][s]ed fitting on the ground, expecting [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] every moment it would open and [s]wallow us, when at length nature became more compo[s]ed; the dark mi[s]ts which had ob[s]cured the face of heaven began to diffipate, and the [s]etting fun darted his watery beams acro[s]s the harbour. What then were our [s]en[s]ations, when, added to our terror at [s]eeing the whole fave of the country a univer[s]al wreck, we beheld the harbour empty, not one ve[s][s]el to be [s]een? Columbus had gone on board that afternoon, to give [s]ome orders preparatory to our departure for Hi[s]paniola, and we imagined that the hurricane, attendant on the earthquake, had buried him and his companions in the waves. We ca[s]t our eyes towards the place where lately [s]tood the tents and dwellings of our friends and a[s][s]ociates; nor tent nor dwelling appeared; all was [s]ilence, all was de[s]olation. A va[s]t cavity was [s]een where once the dwellings were, through which impetuou[s]ly ru[s]hed a foaming torrent; which, as it roared along, bore on its [s]urface trees, [s]hrubs, ruins, and bodies of wild bea[s]ts which had peri[s]hed in the tempe[s]t. Oh! what a night of agony we pa[s]t. Yet this rude [s]hock had not affected univer[s]al nature. The dews fell as kindly, the zephyrs blowed as refre[s]hing, and the [s]un aro[s]e with as much [s]plendor, as though the night had pa[s][s]ed in its u[s]ual tranquillity. And why not? The whole world is but an atom floating in infinite [s]pace, and we who crawl on its [s]urface but as emmets, thou[s]ands of which might be accidentally cru[s]hed beneath the foot of the pa[s][s]enger, without deranging, in the lea[s]t, the beauty, order and [s]ymmetry of the univer[s]al whole. When we beheld the de[s]olation which [s]pread far and wide on every [s]ide, de[s]pair had nearly [s]eized our minds; but as the morning advanced, we de[s]cried four of our ve[s][s]els coming with a gentle breeze into the harbour. Columbus landed, and our meeting was [s]peechle[s]s ec[s]tacy. From the deva[s]tation of the night, about forty [s]ouls had e[s]caped, and the[s]e entreated to be allowed to embark and quit the coa[s]t immediately. Columbus having a[s][s]ented to their reque[s]t, and had us conveyed on board his own [s]hip, put immediately to [s]ea. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] then informed us, that hearing the hurricane roar before it came upon him, he cut the cables of his [s]hip, and ordering the [s]ails to be loo[s]ed, prepared to put before it, whichever way it [s]hould drive, as the only hope of [s]aving his ve[s][s]el. Several others followed his example; and providentially the tempe[s]t bore directly out of the harbour. Tho[s]e who caught the fir[s]t moment to put to [s]ea, were [s]aved; three [s]hips remained in port, and were [s]wallowed in the general ruin. Garcias and his whole party were in this dreadful night hurried out of time into eternity. Of all the prince[s]s Orrabella's attendants, only Cora and her mother were [s]aved. Poor Alzira, with the virtuous Peruvian maid who [s]aved us from the vile [s]chemes of the Ca[s]tilians, were buried in the ruins of the palace. On our arrival in Hi[s]paniola, Columbus [s]hewed his commi[s][s]ion and authority to di[s]place Roldan and his officers, and to take upon him[s]elf the reins of government. The natives, and indeed the inhabitants in general, received him with acclamations of joy, and followed the degraded Roldan to the water [s]ide when he embarked, with cur[s]es, [s]houts and hi[s][s]es. Two years from this period pa[s][s]ed on in the utmo[s]t tranquillity. The only alloy to our happine[s]s at this period, was the ill health of your mother, who[s]e delicate frame had received a [s]hock almo[s]t beyond her [s]trength to [s]upport. But time by degrees weakened the remembrance of her [s]evere lo[s][s]es; and as her [s]pirits began to regain their wonted tone, health faintly tinged her cheeks, and enliyened her grief-[s]woln eyes. It was at the clo[s]e of the year 1504, that we received the afflicting intelligence of the death of I[s]abelle of Spain. When Columbus was informed of an event [s]o di[s]tre[s][s]ing to us all, but to him in particular, he pre[s][s]ed her portrait (which he ever wore about his neck) to his lips; "Oh! my royal mi[s]tre[s]s," [s]aid he, "in the grave, with thy virtues, lies buried the [s]ame, the honour, the happine[s]s of Columbus." He [s]poke prophetically; for within [s]ix months from the death of the queen, your grandfather was recalled; and Davilla, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] creature of the king's, and an intimate of Roldan's, was appointed to [s]ucceed him as viceroy. Your father, offended at the indignity offered his parent, re[s]igned all his offices, and we returned to Spain together. Columbus never vi[s]ited the court; but immediately on landing retired to an e[s]tate he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed in Valladolid. Ferdinando attended the levee of the king several times, but he was either entirely overlooked, or addressed in [s]uch terms of chilling coldne[s]s, that his high [s]pirit could not brook it, and he followed his father into retirement. Perhaps your inexperienced mind will wonder how Roldan, but a few years [s]ince poor, and dependent on the friend[s]hip and bounty of Columbus, could have intere[s]t [s]ufficient to di[s]place that valiant commander, and place a favorite of his own in his office. But, my dear girl, the neglected Roldan was poor, the returning governor was rich. And they who in the former [s]ituation treated him with contemptuous neglect, or at be[s]t with cold, [s]upercilious civility, now received him with open arms, applauded every word he [s]poke, and, like [s]ummer flies round a ve[s][s]el which contains honey, [s]warmed with a fond, officious, greedy hum, in hopes to [s]hare the [s]weets that it contains. Roldan was a man of the world; he heard them, received their care[s][s]es, [s]miled internally at their duplicity, made them [s]ub[s]ervient to his purpo[s]es, and then retaliated on them the contumely and [s]corn which he well remembered once to have received. Added to this, I[s]abelle was dead; and Ferdinand, who never cordially loved Columbus, eagerly caught at any opportunity, however frivolous, to di[s]grace a man who[s]e unexpected [s]ucce[s][s]es were a con[s]tant reproach to him. Po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of a princely fortune, beloved by his friends, and (even fallen as he was from power) [s]till feared by his enemies, [s]urrounded by a loving and beloved family, Columbus might have been expected to enjoy many years of uninterrupted tranquillity. But, alas! his noble heart was wounded pa[s]t cure. It was not power he had coveted from the fir[s]t; wealth he de[s]pi[s]ed; titles were beneath his notice; it was honour, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] untarnished and unfullied [s]ame, he [s]ought. The one had been twice involved in [s]u[s]picion, and the other was threatened to be wre[s]ted from him; for many of the creatures that infe[s]ted the court of Ferdinand, pretended that the di[s]eovery of the va[s]t continent now called America, was nothing extraordinary; and that many had [s]poken of it as a thing more than po[s][s]ible long before Columbus attempted it. Be[s]ides this, a report was [s]pread that the continent had been formerly di[s]covered by [s]ome mariners who were [s]hipwrecked on its coa[s]t, and providentially returned to their native country; that the chief of the[s]e mariners, being entertained at the hou[s]e of Columbus's father whil[s]t he was yet a boy, he had li[s]tened attentively to the descriptions he gave of its [s]ituation, latitude, and computed di[s]tance from Europe; that he had trea[s]ured this in his memory, and the old mariner dying [s]oon after, Columbus had impo[s]ed the di[s]covery on the world as his own, the fruit of indefatigable application, and inten[s]e [s]tudy. The[s]e reports, which were maliciou[s]ly circulated by his enemies, preyed on his [s]pirits. His health daily declined; his appetite for[s]ook him, and re[s]t was a stranger to his pillow. He [s]hunned the [s]ociety even of his neare[s]t connexions; he would [s]pend whole days in his clo[s]et, where he had carefully pre[s]erved his chains, and I have often [s]urpri[s]ed him weeping over them like an infant. Life became a burthen to him, grievous to [s]upport, and it plea[s]ed Heaven to relea[s]e him from it on the 20th of May, 1506. What my [s]ufferings were, thus deprived of my fir[s]t and deare[s]t friend and companion, it is impo[s][s]ible to give you any idea of. For many months, I [s]hut myself from the fight of all; even the pre[s]ence of your father and mother were painful to me. Their affliction was [s]carcely le[s]s poignant than mine, and the mo[s]t luxurious moments any of us knew, were when we were recounting the virtues, and weeping over the memory of our departed hero. But from the[s]e tender indulgencies we were arou[s]ed by a furious war breaking out between Spain and the Ottoman Empire. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] Numbers of volunteers, gentlemen of the fir[s]t rank, prepared to repel the[s]e invading Moors. Ferdinando inherited the [s]pirit of his father; his country required his aid, and una[s]ked, he offered it. During a war of [s]even years, your mother and my[s]elf (who remained retired in Valladolid) [s]aw him but three times. His vi[s]its were always [s]hort, and our fears for his [s]afety were [s]o great and multiplied, that the pain of parting more than counterbalanced the plea[s]ures of meeting. His la[s]t rece[s]s from arms was four months, during the winter of 1514. At parting, he tenderly embraced me. On taking leave of his wife, who after [s]o many years again gave him hopes of becoming a father, he entreated her, [s]hould he not return before the birth of his child, and it [s]hould prove a girl, that [s]he would have it chri[s]tened I[s]abelle . "It was the with of our late royal mi[s]tre[s]s," [s]aid he, "that one of our children [s]hould bear her name. She is now no more; but the [s]malle[s]t wi[s]h of the patrone[s]s of my departed father will ever be a command to me." "And to me," [s]aid Orrabella; "if my child is a female, I[s]abelle [s]hall be her name." Your father again embraced us, ble[s][s]ed us, and departed. The war continued with unabated fury on both [s]ides. Ferdinando was in con[s]tant and dangerous [s]ervice. Six months pa[s][s]ed, and no hopes of his return; at the expiration of that period, you, my dear child, were born; and in ten days after, you were baptized by the name of I[s]abelle. Your mother had not left her apartment, when one day as we were [s]itting by the window, we perceived a courier riding full [s]peed up the avenue that led to the hou[s]e. I left the room to take the expre[s]s, my heart foreboding fatal tidings, and wi[s]hing to conceal them as long as po[s][s]ible from your mother. But as I went down the front [s]tairs, a [s]ervant, who had received the packet from the me[s][s]enger, ran up the back way, and delivered it into the hands of the unfortunate Orrabella. She opened it, [s]he read. Ferdinando was no more, and I returned to the apartment ju[s]t time enough to [s]ave her from falling to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] floor. Violent convul[s]ions [s]ucceeded each other; and before morning, my poor little I[s]abelle was an orphan. How I [s]upported my[s]elf through [s]uch accumulated mi[s]ery, Heaven (who no doubt a[s][s]i[s]ted me) alone can tell. It was many days before I could [s]ummon resolution to examine the fatal packet particularly. When I did, I found my brave [s]on had fallen gloriou[s]ly in [s]ingle combat with the heir to the Ottoman [s]ceptre; that he [s]aw his antagoni[s]t fall, and died triumphing in the excellency of his own religion, and exhorting all around him to per[s]evere to the end. I wept at the lo[s]s of my child, but I gloried in his faith, valour and con[s]tancy in the Chri[s]tian cau[s]e. From that time, my life has been a continued blank. I have [s]een but little company. My nephew, the marquis Guidova, [s]on to a brother of mine, the offspring of a marriage that my father contracted after my union with your grandfather, with two amiable young women his [s]i[s]ters, and a charming creature whom he had made his wife, were the only [s]ociety that afforded me any [s]atisfaction. I endure ceremonious vi[s]its, it is true; but I always feel them insupportably tedious, and impatiently look for the moment when the departure of my gue[s]ts would relea[s]e me, and I might either unbend my mind in ob[s]erving your innocent [s]ports, or in deep [s]olitude, by reflection and hope, be again united to tho[s]e departed objects of my affections, Columbus, Ferdinando and Orrabella. In le[s]s than a twelvemonth after the death of your parents, I made my will. For the contents and meaning of that will , I refer you to the beginning of this long epi[s]tle, which, at hours when my [s]trength and [s]pirits would permit the employment, I have been nearly three months in writing. And now, my dear I[s]abelle, I bid you adieu. May you po[s][s]e[s]s all the virtues of your father and grandfather, all the beauty and fortitude of your mother, and be ever exempt from the [s]orrows that have lacerated the heart of BEATINA.

Should [s]he live till you reach the years of maturity, be to her a firm friend; her attachment to your parents, and affection for your[s]elf, has been unbounded; let your gratitude be the [s]ame. Columbia had read, and pau[s]ed, and wept, and read again, till, in her anxiety for the fate of Orrabella, [s]he had forgot what [s]he [s]o earne[s]tly had wi[s]hed to know, concerning the marriage of her mother. The conclu[s]ion of the manu[s]cript, however, brought it fre[s]h to her memory. She turned the paper on all [s]ides; no farther intelligence was to be gleaned from that. But Cora, Cora had been particularly mentioned, as [s]trongly attached to the lady I[s]abelle. No doubt [s]he could inform her of all [s]he wi[s]hed to know. She had no [s]ooner conceived the idea, than, folding the papers which [s]he replaced in the e[s]critoire, [s]he locked the drawer, and ha[s]tily [s]ought the apartment of her aged [s]ervant. Supplication, Rejection, Compliance. " I have read all the papers," [s]aid Columbia, seating her[s]elf be[s]ide Cora, who was taking her evening's repa[s]t; "I have read them all, but they do not give me any account of my father, or how he became acquainted with the lady I[s]abelle." "I did not suppose they would," replied Cora, [s]ipping with affected unconcern [s]ome milk which [s]tood before her, and then breaking into it the remainder of a [s]lice of brown bread, which lay be[s]ide it. "Well, but dear Cora," [s]aid Columbia, laying her right arm over her old [s]ervant's [s]houlder, and looking with [s]miling earne[s]tne[s]s in her face; "but dear Cora, I dare [s]ay you could tell me all about it." "Oh!

I tell a [s]tory [s]o badly, and make [s]o many repetitions, and am [s]o tedious and minute, you would have no patience to li[s]ten; [s]o you and Mina may go and walk, and I'll go to bed, and then, you know, we [s]hall both be [s]atisfied." "Nay but, dear, dear Cora, now don't be angry. Pray forgive me if I was a naughty girl, and impatiently would not give you leave to tell the [s]tory your own way. Only inform me how my mother became acquainted with, and afterwards married to, an Englishman, and a Prote[s]tant, and I will promi[s]e not to interrupt you from the beginning of your [s]tory to the end." "Aye, to be [s]ure," [s]aid Cora, "we are mighty condescending now. O my con[s]cience, there is nothing like curio[s]ity to make a young lady gentle and complying. This morning it was, Be quiet, Cora, and pray hold your tongue. Hold my tongue indeed; why I warrant I could have told you every thing that happened, as well as tho[s]e letters. But you liked reading the letters be[s]t then, and [s]o mayhap you may find [s]ome more to-morrow that will tell you every thing you wi[s]h to know." "'Tis well," [s]aid Columbia, [s]omewhat haughtily, "I will go to my mother. She referred me to you; but [s]ince you do not choo[s]e to comply with her de[s]ires, I will from her mouth reque[s]t a recital of events, which, however the recollection of them may make her own heart bleed afre[s]h, [s]he will, I am [s]ure, recount, to gratify the laudable curio[s]ity of her child. You, Cora, may go to bed and re[s]t; your lady, the daughter of the prince[s]s Orrabella, and her unfortunate offspring, will pa[s]s the night in [s]orrow. She in tears of bitter remembrance, and I in lamenting afflictions I cannot but feel, though I have not the power to alleviate." This was attacking Cora in the mo[s]t vulnerable part. "Stay," [s]aid [s]he, catching hold of Columbia's robe, "[s]tay, my dear young lady, but a few [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] moments, and I will tell you all." "That's my good Cora," [s]aid [s]he, ki[s][s]ing her cheek with affection; "I will now go and take leave of my mother for the night. You [s]hall go to bed, Mina, and I will come and [s]it be[s]ide you. We will put out the candle. For you know the moon [s]hines full into your chamber, and I always think a [s]tory doubly intere[s]ting when it is told by moonlight. This arrangement made, Columbia went to the apartment of her mother, and partook of a [s]light repa[s]t. But little conver[s]ation pa[s][s]ed between them. I[s]abelle was buried in reflection, and the mind of her daughter fully occupied by the events [s]he had been [s]o lately made acquainted with, mixed with a re[s]tle[s]s impatience to repair to the chamber of Cora. Supper fini[s]hed, [s]he reque[s]ted leave to retire; and Mina, being di[s]mi[s][s]ed from her attendance on the lady I[s]abelle, they [s]eated them[s]elves on the [s]ide of Cora's bed, who eagerly began the promi[s]ed recital. "The old lady Beatina died when your mother was not [s]even years old, and [s]o the Marquis Guidova thought it be[s]t only to leave a few people ju[s]t to take care of the hou[s]e and plea[s]ure grounds in Valladolid; and di[s]charging the re[s]t of the [s]ervants, take my young lady with him to Madrid, where he for the mo[s]t part lived. He was a good gentleman, and his lady, Heaven ble[s]s her, was as kind a gentlewoman as ever breathed. They were as fond of your mother as though [s]he had been their own child; but who could help loving her? She was [s]o conde[s]cending, [s]o benevolent, [s]o good-natured, and more than that, [s]o beautiful. So there was ma[s]ters hired to teach her every thing, that ladies of quality generally learn, and they u[s]ed to [s]ay they had no trouble in teaching her; for [s]he under[s]tood every thing they told her in a minute, and never forgot what [s]he had once learnt. "Many cavaliers and gentlemen [s]ought her for their bride before [s]he was fifteen. Not a family in the Court of Spain but would have thought it a high honour to have had her for a daughter-in-law. The young King of Spain u[s]ed to call her a [s]tar of the fir[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] magnitude; a gem fit for the crown of a prince, and many other [s]uch pretty names. But [s]he, [s]weet lady, was never made proud or conceited by the[s]e prai[s]es, but was always the [s]ame humble, affable creature as ever. Then [s]he was [s]o pious! Ah, when [s]hall I [s]ee her equal? Her behaviour was an example, admired by all, but I am afraid followed by very few. "Well, as I was [s]aying, many noble gentlemen fought to win her love, but [s]he was indifferent to them all; and at the age of eighteen, was [s]till unmarried. At that time, Sir Thomas Arundel arrived at the Spani[s]h Court. He was travelling to fini[s]h his education, and came with a de[s]ign of pa[s][s]ing a few months in Madrid. Ah! he was a brave gentleman." "Yes," [s]aid Columbia exultingly, "my father was a brave man, a worthy man, an honour to human nature." "Aye, but," replied Cora, "he was much handsomer then, [s]o tall and graceful, [s]uch fine blue eyes, and [s]uch a complexion, [s]o fair and ruddy, and his beautiful dark brown hair fell in [s]uch becoming ringlets round his face and [s]houlders, that he looked like [s]omething more than mortal." "Why, Cora," [s]aid Mina, laughing, "you de[s]cribe his per[s]on with [s]uch rapture, that I do believe you fell in love with him your[s]elf." "Heaven help me!" cried the old woman, "that would have been a fine [s]tory truly! No, no, I knew my [s]tation better. Besides, I was old enough to be his mother. I could not [s]hut my eyes, you know, and I hope there was no harm in admiring what I [s]aw." "No, to be [s]ure," [s]aid Columbia, "and I dare [s]ay my dear mother admired him as much as you did." "Indeed [s]he did," replied Cora; "he was introduced to the Marquis by the Duke de Medina, and invited by him to a [s]plendid entertainment which he gave to all the foreigners of di[s]tinction at that time re[s]ident at the Court of Spain. Oh! how beautiful did my dear lady I[s]abelle look on that day; her dre[s]s was always plain, but it was always becoming, and more than u[s]ually [s]o at that time. No wonder the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] young Engli[s]hman was captivated at fir[s]t [s]ight. I could have gazed at her for the whole day without being tired; what then mu[s]t he feel, who had never before [s]een a woman [s]o charming? For to excel her, I am [s]ure would be impo[s][s]ible. A ball was given in the evening; Arundel danced with your mother. Every eye was turned upon them as they gracefully and lightly followed the mu[s]ic. Every tongue murmured their prai[s]e. "When the lady I[s]abelle retired for the night, [s]he a[s]ked me if I had [s]een the accompli[s]hed cavalier Arundel, and whether I did not think him very handsome. "I have been deaf to all my lovers as yet," [s]aid [s]he, [s]miling; "but I believe, Cora, if Arundel [s]hould a[s]k my hand, I [s]hould not long withhold it." The next morning, as [s]he was ri[s]ing, the whole of her discourse was on the gallant Engli[s]hman; and [s]he could not help wi[s]hing to [s]ee him again, and wondering whether he thought of her as much as [s]he did of him. Whil[s]t [s]he was prattling on in her lively innocent manner, the Marchione[s]s Guidova entered the apartment. "I[s]abelle, my love," [s]aid [s]he, "I have [s]ome papers in my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, which I blame my[s]elf for not having earlier entru[s]ted to your peru[s]al. Here are [s]ome confidential letters which pa[s][s]ed between your father and his parents; and here is a packet addre[s][s]ed to you, my love. It was written by your grandmother during the la[s]t years of her life. It will inform you of [s]ome particulars in her will, which it is nece[s][s]ary for you to know. You are there [s]trictly forbid to unite your[s]elf to a man who pro[s]e[s][s]es the reformed religion. "The Marquis and my[s]elf could not but ob[s]erve la[s]t night the pointed attentions, and undi[s]gui[s]ed admiration, with which Sir Thomas Arundel addre[s][s]ed you; and I think it is not unlikely but he may reque[s]t you in marriage. Now, my dear I[s]abelle, Arundel is a [s]trict Prote[s]tant. This, you are [s]en[s]ible, will place an insurmountable barrier between you. And fearful that my dear girl might let her heart be allured by an agreeable per[s]on and in[s]inuating addre[s]s before [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] knew the fatal con[s]equences that mu[s]t re[s]ult from [s]uch an indulgence, I would no longer delay requesting you to give a few hours [s]erious attention to the papers I here leave with you, particularly that written by your grandmother." "When the Marchione[s]s had thus [s]poke, [s]he embraced the lady I[s]abelle, who had not once attempted an an[s]wer; and laying the papers on the table, left the apartment. "While the Marchione[s]s was [s]peaking, I had retired, out of re[s]pect, to a window at the mo[s]t di[s]tant part of the room; but I now approached my young lady, and found her pale, trembling, and her eyes brimfull of tears. "My fate, I fear, is fixed, Cora," [s]aid [s]he. "My heart has hitherto been in[s]en[s]ible to the admiration and love I heard numbers daily profess for me; but though [s]o lately acquainted with him, I had, almo[s]t unknown to my[s]elf, [s]uffered a wi[s]h to ri[s]e, that Arundel might be the man de[s]igned to be my hu[s]band. It is true, I never [s]aw him till yesterday; but to his character I am no [s]tranger. Fame [s]peaks highly of his honour, integrity and wi[s]dom. But I am told our fates can never be united. If [s]o, a convent [s]hall be my choice, and I will [s]hut my[s]elf from a world that will, I greatly fear, contain no charms for me, when deprived of the hope of [s]haring the fate of Arundel." "She then ha[s]tily fini[s]hed dre[s][s]ing, and di[s]mi[s][s]ed me; nor did I [s]ee the dear lady again, till noon. Oh! how her [s]weet countenance was altered [s]ince the morning. She was bathing her eyes in water, in hopes to take off the redne[s]s; but it was in vain. The traces of her tears [s]till remained upon her cheeks, and her eyes were [s]unk and heavy. The papers lay open on the table before her; [s]he [s]poke but little to me; and though when [s]he did [s]peak, [s]he forced a [s]mile, I could [s]ee her poor heart was almo[s]t breaking. "The Marquis had rightly judged, that Arundel was enamoured of my lady; for on the very next day, he took an opportunity to call, when he knew the Marquis was at the levee, and going into the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] garden, as he [s]aid to amu[s]e him[s]elf till the Marquis's return, he [s]ent one of the [s]ervants to de[s]ire I would grant him a few minutes' conver[s]ation. I went, you may be [s]ure; for I gue[s][s]ed his errand, and thought it no harm to pity him, and hear what he had to [s]ay on the [s]ubject. So as I was [s]aying, I went, and he a[s]ked me a thou[s]and que[s]tions about the lady I[s]abelle; as whether [s]he was engaged, whether [s]he had ever mentioned him, and whether it was with di[s]like or approbation. Oh! Mi[s]s Columbia, he was a fine [s]poken man; it would have done your heart good to have heard him. "Your lady is an angel, Cora," [s]aid he; "and I [s]hould think my[s]elf but too happy to be permitted to wear out my life in her [s]ervice. I mean to a[s]k her of her guardian; but as I would fir[s]t be a[s][s]ured, that by [s]o doing I offer no violence to her heart, I have written to her. Take this letter, then, my good Cora, and deliver it into the hands of your divine mi[s]tre[s]s. To-morrow I will expect an an[s]wer, and my future conduct [s]hall be regulated by her commands. Be not alarmed, (for I drew back as he offered me the letter) be not alarmed; I [s]wear to you, I have nothing but honour in my thoughts." He then forced the letter into my hand, and with it his pur[s]e, containing about twenty ducats; and at that moment hearing the Marquis's voice in the garden inquiring for Arundel, I could neither return his pre[s]ent, nor tell him of how little effect his letter would be; [s]ince my lady was re[s]tricted from marrying a Prote[s]tant. But the exact terms of the re[s]triction I did not then know. So, as I [s]aid, hearing the Marquis coming, I was glad to avoid meeting him; [s]o turned into another walk, and made the be[s]t of my way to the hou[s]e. "When I gave your dear mother the letter, [s]he chid me for bringing it, [s]he he[s]itated for [s]ome time; but when I told her he promi[s]ed to be guided by her commands, [s]he opened and read it. Then bidding me bring her pen and ink, [s]he wrote an an[s]wer, frequently [s]topping to wipe off the tears that gu[s]hed into her eyes. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] "From this time for above a fortnight, letters passed between them every day. My poor lady grew pen[s]ive, languid, and avoided company; [s]pent great part of every night in writing; and in the day time, every moment when [s]he thought nobody ob[s]erved her, [s]he would read over the letters of Arundel. "At length [s]he told me one evening, that [s]he had promi[s]ed to give him an interview. "He [s]ups here to-night," [s]aid [s]he, "and after [s]upper will retire to the alcove on the ea[s]t [s]ide of the garden, and thither I have promi[s]ed to go to meet him; and you, Cora, mu[s]t go with me." "I felt as though it would be right to per[s]uade her not to go, but did not know how to begin; nor could I rightly comprehend how (as they both wor[s]hipped the [s]ame God) the differing in a few trifling forms and ceremonies could make it [s]uch a crime for them to marry. I thought perhaps the Marquis and his lady might be angry at fir[s]t, but that they loved her [s]o well they would [s]oon be reconciled. After this interview, the whole of which I did not hear, and what I did hear I did not fully under[s]tand, only this I know, that Sir Thomas Arundel [s]poke [s]o finely, that he made me cry more than once; the lady I[s]abelle told him, that by marrying a Prote[s]tant [s]he [s]hould forfeit her whole fortune. "And what of that, my lovely I[s]abelle," [s]aid he, "I have fortune enough for us both, it is your invaluable [s]elf I adore; you flatter me; I am not indifferent to your generous heart; why then does my charmer he[s]itate? Let me call this dear hand mine; and my wealth, which is more than enough for all the comforts, nay, even the elegancies of life, will be happily employed, if it can procure a moment's [s]atisfaction for the idol of my [s]oul." "Take me not thus by [s]urpri[s]e," replied your mother; "give me a few days to reflect [s]eriou[s]ly, and your generous propo[s]al [s]hall have an ingenuous and candid an[s]wer. Believe me, Arundel, I will examine my heart with the minute[s]t [s]crutiny; and if I find its attachment to you unconquerable, I will not in[s]ult the maje[s]ty of Heaven by making profe[s][s]ions with my lips [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] which my [s]oul would refu[s]e to ratify. I will then openly, in the face of the world, avow my choice; and if I do [s]o, we will not have different intere[s]ts in [s]o serious a concern as our everla[s]ting peace in [s]uturity. No, Arundel, if I become your wife, I embrace your religion. Your faith [s]hall be my faith, your God my God." "She then [s]uffered him to ki[s]s her hand, and leaning on my arm, returned to her apartment. "I [s]ay, after this interview, my lady became more compo[s]ed; in [s]ome mea[s]ure regained her wonted cheerfulne[s]s, and the Marquis was plea[s]ed to perceive a [s]adne[s]s wearing off, the [s]ource of which he had been afraid to inquire into. "It was about ten days from this time, that my lady a[s]ked me if I would go with her to England. "For I am re[s]olved, Cora," [s]aid [s]he, "to [s]hare the fate of Arundel. This day I mean to avow my de[s]igns to my guardian, and relinqui[s]h my e[s]tates to my cou[s]in. Will you, then, follow the ruined fortunes of your poor mi[s]tre[s]s?" "Will I?" [s]aid I, throwing my arms round her; "can any thing but death ever [s]eparate me from you?" "It was towards the evening of this day, that the lady I[s]abelle [s]ent me to reque[s]t the Marquis, his lady, and their elde[s]t [s]on, would grant her half an hour's conver[s]ation. They returned for an[s]wer, that they were perfectly at liberty, and awaited her pre[s]ence in the [s]aloon. She then bade me go into the garden, where [s]he knew Arundel was waiting, and bid him come to her. He obeyed the [s]ummons, and they entered the [s]aloon together. It was then your noble mother declared to her guardian and his family the re[s]olution [s]he had taken. "Had you entru[s]ted me," [s]aid [s]he, "earlier with the contents of my grandmother's will, I might have been upon my guard; but my heart was irrevocably gone before I knew it was a crime to love a Prote[s]tant. Having made my election, I do not scruple to confe[s]s, that, deprived of Arundel, I would never unite with any other man. Seclu[s]ion from the world would have been my next choice; but rea[s]on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] and religion told me, that a heart throbbing with all the anxieties of a di[s]appointed pa[s][s]ion, is not a fit sacrifice to be offered to a Being of infinite purity. My fortune I re[s]ign to my cou[s]in, and wi[s]h him as much happine[s]s in the enjoyment of it as I feel in relinquishing it. My per[s]onal ornaments I imagine are my own. To-morrow I [s]hall be[s]tow them and my[s]elf on Arundel; and in becoming his wife, I embrace the Prote[s]tant per[s]ua[s]ion." "When my lady had fini[s]hed [s]peaking, [s]he gave her hand to your father, who [s]poke [s]omething very hand[s]ome, though I can't remember what. But I know the old Marquis raved, his [s]on looked quite happy, the Marchione[s]s cried. One moment embracing lady I[s]abelle, and entreating her to remember her grandmother's la[s]t injunctions, and not forfeit her eternal peace by quitting the bo[s]om of the holy mother church; then [s]he would entreat her [s]on not to enforce the will to its full extent, but to be content to divide the fortune with his cou[s]in. Oh! dearee me, it was a terrible night; for what with the rage of the one and the tears of the other, my poor lady was almo[s]t di[s]tracted. "Well, [s]ure enough the next morning [s]he was married, and in a few days they [s]et off for England. On our arrival in London, [s]he publickly abjured the Romish religion, and would have had me do the [s]ame; but I thought changing my religion once in my life was enough. I was taught by the good lady Beatina, to wor[s]hip one God, and to look for eternal [s]alvation through the merits of a Redeemer; to be humane and charitable to all mankind; and to the extent of my weak power, I have endeavoured to practi[s]e what [s]he taught. And I hope I [s]hall, when I die, go to heaven as well as if I had changed my religion twenty times." "You cannot change for the better, my good Cora," [s]aid Columbia; "yet you mu[s]t not blame my mother." "Blame," cried Cora, ha[s]tily; "no indeed; the lady I[s]abelle never did any thing that de[s]erved blame. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] She had [s]en[s]e and education to under[s]tand what [s]he was doing; but I was weak and ignorant, and feared by renouncing one error, I might perhaps fall into a greater." "Well but, Cora, what was the cau[s]e of my father's ruin? He was a man of family and fortune, and though I perfectly remember him, and recollect that I had not [s]een him for [s]ome months before, I lo[s]t him forever. I [s]hall never forget the day on which I was told he died. My dear mother, who had been ab[s]ent [s]ome days, was brought home in a [s]tate almo[s]t bordering on di[s]traction. She embraced me, called me her dear orphan girl, wept, wrung her hands, and then cla[s]ping them, cried, Oh! my Arundel, you are lo[s]t to me, but I tru[s]t you are reaping the heavenly reward of your faith, con[s]tancy and fidelity. She then [s]ent me from her, and a few weeks after we came to this old Ca[s]tle. I did not half like it, Cora, nor am I quite reconciled to it now. Tho[s]e old ruins at the we[s]t end, the long gallery that leads to it, the great arched gate-way that looks ready to fall down, and the na[s]ty moat full of green water, fill me with terror and disgust; and if it was not for the little garden that Matthias has done up [s]o cleverly, and the pond where we go to fi[s]h, I [s]hould be ready to die with melancholy." "And [s]o [s]hould I," [s]aid Mina, "and with fear too; for they people about here." "Now do be quiet, Mina," [s]aid Columbia, "for it grows late, and I want Cora to fini[s]h telling about my father." Mina was [s]ilent, and Cora continued. "Ah! my dear Mi[s]s, the[s]e were [s]ad times indeed; it was then your dear mother was plunged into poverty; for you know your father was a Prote[s]tant. Well, he was a favourite with our young King Edward the VIth. and greatly beloved by the Protector Duke of Somer[s]et. They favoured the reformers very much. And there was that wicked Bi[s]hop Gardiner, who was for burning and hanging every body that did not [s]ay their prayers ju[s]t as he did. He hated your father; and [s]o he, and [s]everal others as wicked as him[s]elf, laid a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] plan to take away the life of the good Duke of Somerset. They [s]aid he had laid a plan to murder the young King, and accu[s]ed my worthy ma[s]ter, Sir Thomas Arundel, of being an accomplice; and they threw them into pri[s]on, and a great many more good men were confined. And then Gardiner, and the Duke of Northumberland, and others of his enemies, pretended to have a regular trial. But what [s]ort of a trial was that, when the men that accu[s]ed them were the judges? So they condemned them all to [s]uffer death, and all their [s]ub[s]tance was forfeit to the crown, as they called it; but I warrant the[s]e righteous judges had pretty pickings out of them. So your dear father was beheaded on Tower Hill, and all his e[s]tates [s]eized on by the[s]e robbers. For I am [s]ure they de[s]erve no better name; for Northumberland only took away the life of the good Duke of Somer[s]et, that he might [s]upply his place about the per[s]on of the King, and lay a plan for his own advantage. For he per[s]uaded the King to make a will, and appoint the lady Jane Grey, daughter to the Marchione[s]s of Dor[s]et, his [s]ucce[s][s]or; and this he pretended to do out of love to the reformed religion; but it was only becau[s]e [s]he was married to his [s]on, the Lord Guilford Dudley. But Heaven puni[s]hed him for his wickedne[s]s, in the ruin and death of tho[s]e beloved and charming children. "Oh! what a heavenly creature lady Jane was; your mother loved her dearly. She, [s]weet [s]oul, did not wi[s]h to be a queen; and when, on the death of King Edward, they offered her the crown, "I pray you pardon me, my friends," [s]aid [s]he, "and [s]uffer me to decline this honour; it is too much for me, frail mortal that I am. I would [s]eek an eternal, not a temporal crown; and much I fear the cares and anxieties attendant on the one, will prove a hindrance to my doing my duty nece[s][s]ary for the obtaining of the other;" and when urged to comply, [s]he bowed her head in token of a[s][s]ent. She [s]aid to tho[s]e who knelt to do her homage, "Pray ri[s]e, my friends, this is mockery. You think I am a[s]cending a throne; but I [s]ee clearer, and perceive it is a [s]eaffold. Heaven pardon me this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] u[s]urpation, for I feel I have no right to the[s]e honours, and [s]hall be ready, when called upon, to re[s]ign them to my rightful queen." When Northumberland told her it was for the good of the Prote[s]tant cau[s]e that [s]he [s]hould a[s][s]ume the reins of government, [s]he replied, "The God of the Prote[s]tants is all-[s]ufficient for their protection; he will not [s]uffer them to be puni[s]hed or per[s]ecuted, unle[s]s it be for his own wife purpo[s]es, to prove their faith, and bring home more to the fold. He needs not the assistance of my feeble arm. However, my good lord Duke, if you think you are in the way of your duty in heaping the[s]e unrequired honours upon me, I [s]ubmit; and Heaven forgive us both." "I have heard Matthias, who was in London at the time, repeat her words [s]o often, that I cannot be mi[s]taken in repeating them again. So the [s]weet, good lady was proclaimed queen, and nine days after, [s]he was [s]eized, with her hu[s]band and her father-in-law, and [s]ent to the tower, and [s]oon after they were all beheaded. And [s]o I have no doubt but the wicked Duke repented, before he died, of his malice to the good lord Protector and your dear father; and when he came to lay his own head upon the block, I dare [s]ay he wi[s]hed he never had been the means of bringing [s]o many innocent people there. The lady Jane left one [s]on by lord Dudley; he was chri[s]tened Henry; but he bears neither the title, nor inherits the fortune of his father, more [s]hame for them that have wronged him of it." Here Cora cea[s]ed [s]peaking; but Columbia was unable to thank her, or articulate a [s]ingle word. The unmerited accu[s]ation and ignominious death of her father, the untimely fate of the lovely and pious lady Jane, had [s]o oppre[s][s]ed her heart, that it was only by the indulgence of tears [s]he could [s]ave her[s]elf from fainting. At length [s]he recovered [s]ome degree of compo[s]ure, ki[s][s]ed Cora, bade her good night, and taking Mina's hand, retired to her own apartment. An Adventure. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] It was now near midnight. The moon, which had [s]hone [s]o bright on the beginning of the evening, was now enveloped in black clouds. The wind whistled hollow through the branches of the half-naked trees, and the turrets of the old Ca[s]tle echoed its melancholy notes. A cold rain beat again[s]t the casements, that [s]hook in their frames from the violence of the ri[s]ing tempe[s]t, and every thing wore a dreary, [s]ombre appearance. "I declare," [s]aid Columbia, [s]huddering, "my spirits are [s]o depre[s][s]ed, and the apartment looks [s]o gloomy, I almo[s]t wi[s]h I had not put out the candle." "And I'm [s]ure [s]o do I," [s]aid Mina, "for I can't get tho[s]e [s]tories out of my head, that the people, who live round about, tell of this old Ca[s]tle; for I do a[s][s]ure you they wonder how we can live in it, and often a[s]k if we never hear or [s]ee any thing." "What [s]hould we hear or [s]ee," [s]aid Columbia, "more than our own family?" But [s]he [s]huddered involuntarily, and drew nearer to Mina, ca[s]ting a fearful glance round the room. "Nay, I don't know," replied Mina, "I never give much ear to [s]uch [s]tories; but they do [s]ay the Ca[s]tle is haunted; and that a great Baron, who owned it a good many years ago, killed his brother here, that he might win the love of his lady, whom he afterwards [s]educed, and then [s]ent her beyond [s]ea, where [s]he was never more heard of. And they [s]ay the young Baron's gho[s]t often is [s]een about the we[s]tern ruins; and that he walks round the garden, and even [s]ometimes through the long gallery and up the winding staircase that leads to the turret that joins this range of apartments." "I dare [s]ay it is all fancy," [s]aid Columbia, getting into bed, and covering her face with the bed-clothes." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] "Very likely," [s]aid Mina; "for you know we never [s]aw or heard any thing." "No, nor, I will an[s]wer for it, never [s]hall," replied her young lady, "[s]o good night, Mina, for I'm [s]leepy." Mina began to [s]ay, "Good night;" but [s]topping [s]hort, was [s]eized with a univer[s]al [s]hivering; her heart beat violently, and [s]he trembled [s]o that the bed [s]hook under her. "Oh heavens," [s]aid Columbia, "what's the matter?" "Hu[s]h," replied Mina, "li[s]ten." In trembling silence they both rai[s]ed their heads from the pillow, and di[s]tinctly heard human [s]teps a[s]cend the [s]tairs, which led to the turret, and which winded on the [s]ide of their apartment immediately again[s]t the head of the bed. "Perhaps Matthias is not gone to bed," [s]aid Columbia. "Oh! but I'm [s]ure he is," replied Mina, "I [s]aw him take the candle and go into his own room. Be[s]ides, what [s]hould he do up in the old turret at this hour, on [s]uch a di[s]mal [s]tormy night?" "Well, I do believe," [s]aid Columbia, "it was only imagination." Ju[s]t as [s]he [s]poke, they heard the [s]ame noi[s]e repeated, but it was the [s]ound of a per[s]on descending; and pre[s]ently a man's voice was heard, but not loud enough to di[s]tingui[s]h what he [s]aid. At the [s]ame in[s]tant they both [s]prang out of bed, and ru[s]hed into Cora's apartment; there, as they [s]tood trembling and trying to awake her, they di[s]cerned through a window, that looked towards the entrance that led to the long gallery, two figures come from the door; and by the pale glimmer of the moon perceived that one, by his beaver which appeared ornamented with feathers, was a gentleman of rank, the other [s]eemed habited like a [s]ervant. "There, there," [s]aid Mina, "do you [s]ee?" "Yes," [s]aid Columbia; "but there are two figures." "Aye, to be [s]ure," replied Mina; "I dare [s]ay that was his faithful [s]ervant, who was killed endeavouring to preserve his ma[s]ter." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] Columbia, terrified as [s]he was, could [s]carcely help [s]miling at the readine[s]s of her young attendant in thus explaining every thing according to her own fancy. They followed the two figures with their eyes, till they [s]eemed to vani[s]h among[s]t the we[s]tern ruins; and then waking the old [s]ervant, and creeping into her bed, one on one [s]ide and one on the other, related the wonderful appearance they had [s]een, and the [s]ounds they had heard. Cora was [s]trongly tinctured with the [s]uper[s]tition [s]o prevalent at that period in almo[s]t every rank. She fully believed that they had [s]een [s]upernatural beings, and related, as [s]he lay trembling between them, [s]o many horrible [s]tories, that the terrified girls were afraid to open their eyes, left [s]ome gha[s]tly [s]pectre [s]hould meet their view. At length the clock in the great hall chimed three; and Cora, believing that at that hour [s]pirits of every kind returned to their graves, compo[s]ed her[s]elf to [s]leep, as did her young companions. But the [s]pirits of Columbia had been [s]o hara[s][s]ed, that her [s]leep was di[s]turbed by frightful vi[s]ions, and [s]he awoke before the [s]un had cheered the face of day. Glad to behold returning light, [s]he aro[s]e, dejected and unrefre[s]hed; and throwing a mantle over her [s]houlders, walked into the garden, in hopes the morning air would revive her, and take off the appearance of languor which the want of re[s]t had given her, and which the was [s]ure would alarm her mother. There, as [s]he wandered through a walk of filbert trees which had been planted by Matthias near the margin of the pond, [s]he endeavoured to per[s]uade her[s]elf, that the terrors they had experienced in the night, were merely the effects of an imagination previou[s]ly weakened by melancholy recitals, and tinctured by the gloomine[s]s of the weather. The [s]torm was now pa[s]t; the [s]un was above the horizon; the [s]ky was [s]erene; the air ju[s]t [s]harp enough to brace the nerves, and give ela[s]ticity to the [s]pirits. Columbia, enlivened by its vivifying power, had nearly a[s][s]umed her u[s]ual cheerfulne[s]s and [s]erenity, when turning out of the walk towards the hou[s]e, from an arch-way in the ruins [s]he [s]aw, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] advancing towards her, the [s]ame figures [s]he had faintly perceived cro[s]s the court yard in the night. She [s]hrieked, drew her mantle over her face, and fell fainting to the earth. When [s]he recovered, [s]he found her[s]elf [s]upported in her mother's arms, the [s]tranger [s]tanding be[s]ide her. The alarming my[s]tery was now [s]oon di[s][s]olved. This phantom, who had [s]o alarmed Columbia and her attendant, was a material [s]ub[s]tance, Sir Egbert Gorges by name; who, with his [s]ervant, flying from the per[s]ecution of Mary (that cruel oppre[s][s]or and tyrant of her Prote[s]tant [s]ubjects) to the coa[s]t of Wales, in hopes to [s]eek in [s]ome foreign land that liberty of conscience denied him in his own, was benighted, and had lo[s]t his way. Sir Egbert, thus weary and di[s]con[s]olate, wandering over the dreary heath, drenched by the [s]torm, fatigued, cold and hungry, made up to Au[s]tenbury Ca[s]tle, which he perceived at a [s]mall di[s]tance. The ruinous appearance of the we[s]tern wing, which, being next the path he had taken, he fir[s]t entered, gave him little hope to find inhabitants in it. He made his way through the mouldering apartments into the court yard, which he cro[s][s]ed; and in the hope of finding [s]ome room more habitable than any through which he had pa[s][s]ed, he a[s]cended the [s]tairs which lead to the turret. But di[s]appointed in his wi[s]hes, he [s]aid to his [s]ervant as he came down, "This is certainly a desolated ruin, and we had better return to the mo[s]t comfortable place we can find on the other [s]ide the court yard. For this old turret is more di[s]mal and shattered than any thing we have yet [s]een." The[s]e were the foot[s]teps and voices that had [s]o alarmed Columbia. And according to this re[s]olution, they were returning to the we[s]tern wing, when the terrified lady and her [s]ervant [s]aw them from the window. Sir Egbert, and his man Rawlins, having led their hor[s]es into a place of comparative [s]helter, [s]ought for a room that might be be[s]t calculated to guard them[s]elves from the damp nocturnal air. Finding one le[s]s shattered by the hand of time than the re[s]t, they [s]tretched [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] them[s]elves on the floor, and re[s]ting their heads on their [s]addles, compo[s]ed them[s]elves to re[s]t. Hard as the bed was, Sir Egbert, worn out with fatigue and anxiety, [s]oon dropped into a profound [s]lumber; nor was Rawlins long in following his ma[s]ter's example. From this [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility they did not awake till day light [s]tared them in the face, and the all-cheering fun darted his beams through the high-arched windows. Having [s]een that their hor[s]es were [s]afe, they were preparing to explore the whole of the Ca[s]tle, which they now perceived contained [s]ome apartments which wore a face of comfort, and [s]eemed as though lately repaired; when as they came from the ruin, the fir[s]t object that met their eyes was Columbia. Surpri[s]e riveted them to the [s]pot. But her terror on beholding them, her [s]hrick, and con[s]equent fall, made them hurry to her a[s][s]i[s]tance; when ju[s]t as they had rai[s]ed her from the ground, Matthias appeared at the farther end of the garden. He ha[s]tened towards them, helped to [s]upport his dear young lady, and by his loud cries [s]oon alarmed Mina and Cora. The fainting Columbia was borne into the hall, and the lady Isabelle, hurrying to her a[s][s]i[s]tance, had ju[s]t taken her in her maternal arms, when [s]he recovered [s]en[s]e and recollection. The confu[s]ion of this [s]cene had been too great to allow of any explanations on one [s]ide, or que[s]tions on the other; but Sir Egbert [s]eeing the young lady now free from alarm, related, in as concise a manner as po[s][s]ible, the foregoing circum[s]tances, entreating leave to re[s]t for a few days in the Ca[s]tle, whil[s]t he [s]ent Rawlins to the neare[s]t [s]ea-port to inquire for a ve[s][s]el bound for Holland or Germany. To this I[s]abelle a[s][s]ented; and in the cour[s]e of the day Columbia, half a[s]hamed of her terrors, related to her mother and her gue[s]t the adventures of the night. Cheerful and unre[s]trained conver[s]ation begets confidence; and before the hour of re[s]t arrived, Sir Egbert had informed his fair ho[s]te[s]s of the real cau[s]e of his ha[s]ty flight from London, and his re[s]olution to quit the kingdom. I[s]abelle was a[s]toni[s]hed at the account he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] gave of the dreadful per[s]ecutions under which the Prote[s]tants [s]uffered, from the bigotry and cruelty of Mary, and tho[s]e tools of her power, Gardiner and Bonner. Secluded as [s]he was from the world, though [s]he knew they had great difficulties to [s]truggle with, yet [s]he had no idea to what height they carried their barbarity, and that burning, [s]tarving, hanging, and [s]ometimes drawing the victims of their mi[s]guided zeal in quarters, was the method taken to bring back the heretics (as they were called) to the ceremonies and [s]uper[s]titions of the church of Rome. "Ah! my dear child," [s]aid [s]he to Columbia, "how much gratitude ought we to feel toward the divine Di[s]po[s]er of all events, that it has plea[s]ed him, with a correcting hand, to lead us into this happy ob[s]curity, where we can enjoy that liberty of con[s]cience which calms and fortifies the [s]oul, and fits it for all events. Alas! Columbia, had your dear father lived to this day, we might all have [s]uffered at the [s]take together. Then let us be humble and [s]ubmi[s][s]ive to the judgments of our Creator, [s]ince followed by the invaluable ble[s][s]ings of peace, life, and the liberty of wor[s]hipping him in [s]ecurity, according to the dictates of our consciences." Sir Egbert was charmed with the poli[s]hed manners and unaffected piety of the lady I[s]abelle. But the youth, beauty, innocence and vivacity of Columbia had fa[s]cinated his [s]en[s]es. The harmonious trio parted for the night, mutually plea[s]ed with each other; I[s]abelle reflecting, in pious gratitude, on her pre[s]ent happy [s]eclu[s]ion from a court which [s]eemed a [s]cene of murder, and where, perhaps, the morals and principles of her darling child might have been tainted by the bigotry and [s]uper[s]tition of the times, Sir Egbert to ruminate on the intere[s]ting figure, and [s]weet [s]implicity of manner that characterized Columbia, and Columbia her[s]elf to chat with Mina about the hand[s]ome Sir Egbert Gorges. Girli[s]h Chat, Maternal Advice, Departure of a Lover.

[s]aid Columbia. "Yes, indeed I do," [s]aid Mina; "and his man is a clever kind of body." "And you think him very hand[s]ome too, Mina?" "No, not very hand[s]ome; but he has a great deal to [s]ay; and Cora [s]ays he mu[s]t have travelled, for he knows all about her country as well as if he had been there." "But that may be from reading, Mina; for my mother told me to-day, that her father, Ferdinando Columbus, wrote a full account of her grandfather's voyages, during the two years they lived retired at Valladolid. And that at the time my father's papers were [s]eized by his enemies, the manu[s]cript was found, and it has [s]ince been printed." "And [s]o, madam, this fine [s]tranger, this Sir Egbert, is going away to live among[s]t the Dutch people, Rawlins tells me. I'm [s]ure, if I was as him, I would [s]tay where I was." "But that would be improper, Mina; my mother could not po[s][s]ibly entertain a [s]trange knight here above a day or two, as [s]he has neither hu[s]band or [s]on to bear him company." "Well, if [s]he has no [s]on or hu[s]band, [s]he has a daughter; and I warrant Sir Egbert would excu[s]e the deficiency of the one for the [s]ake of the other." "How wildly you talk, Mina; I [s]hall be angry with you pre[s]ently." "What, madam, for [s]uppo[s]ing the hand[s]ome young knight is plea[s]ed with you; nay, now, I don't think you would be very much out of humour if a [s]torm was to detain him at the Ca[s]tle a week or [s]o; for then you know there would be [s]ome excu[s]e for his [s]taying." "Pho! you talk like a [s]impleton, Mina; I wi[s]h you would go to [s]leep." "Well, I wonder how [s]ome folks can be [s]o in[s]en[s]ible; for my part, as [s]oon as I [s]aw him this morning, and found he was real fle[s]h and blood, I [s]aid to my[s]elf, Well, he is a charming cavalier, and if he would but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] fall in love with my lady Columbia, and [s]he with him, we [s]hould have a wedding, and there is always rare doings at a wedding; and then we [s]hould go away from this old Ca[s]tle. And now, if you won't be angry, I'll tell you the truth. I never do [s]ay my prayers, but what I pray that we may [s]oon go away from this [s]hocking old place. Why the arch, at the entrance of the great gate, looks as if it would fall whenever the gate is opened; but to be [s]ure that a'nt very often, we are not much, troubled with hor[s]emen, except when Matthias comes from market, with the old blind crippled creature that brings home our provisions. And then one never [s]ees a young man. I declare, I ble[s][s]ed my eye-fight when I [s]aw Mr. Rawlins: for what with Matthias's [s]tories about the wars, and Cora's earthquakes, and [s]hipwrecks, and [s]torms, and [s]o forth, I am heart [s]ick." "And I'm [s]ure, [s]o am I, Mina, to hear you talk [s]uch a parcel of non[s]en[s]e. However, if you are tired of [s]taying in the Ca[s]tle, you are at liberty to leave it whenever you plea[s]e." "Me leave it, madam? No indeed, madam; if it was ten times more frightful than it is, I would not leave it without you, and my dear lady your mother, for the whole world. No; I meant that if you were married to this hand[s]ome Sir Egbert, we [s]hould go to London again, and have fine dre[s][s]ing and balls and fea[s]ting." "You don't know what you wi[s]h for, Mina. London is no place for Prote[s]tants. London is now the [s]eat of every enormity which is practi[s]ed under the ma[s]k of religion. Queen Mary is determined that every one of her [s]ubjects [s]hall think as [s]he thinks, and tho[s]e who he[s]itate to obey her, are burnt at the [s]take." "And pray, madam, why don't the people burn her? She is but one, and [s]he has multitudes of subjects." "She is their queen, Mina, and they dare not lift the hand again[s]t her." "Queen indeed! Well, I am but an ignorant girl, to be [s]ure; but I can't [s]ee why a queen [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] commit murder without being puni[s]hed for it, any more than other people." "But it is not called murder, when a per[s]on is executed for acting contrary to a queen's commands." "They may call it what they plea[s]e; but if a person is innocent of any real crime, and is only accu[s]ed of not thinking as the queen does, or perhaps they don't preach and pray ju[s]t as [s]he would have them; I do [s]ay, and will [s]tand to it, if [s]he orders them to be hanged or burnt, it is murder. Aye, and I fancy her cruel queen[s]hip will find that out, when [s]he dies." "You are a [s]trange girl, Mina, and are now talking on a [s]ubject we neither of us are competent to [s]peak upon; therefore let me beg you to [s]ay no more. Let us [s]ay our prayers, and be thankful we are, by our [s]eclu[s]ion from [s]ociety, and our di[s]tance from the metropolis, [s]ecure from any fear of her power. And [s]o, Mina, good night." Columbia [s]poke this in [s]o re[s]erved a tone, that Mina did not dare to proceed, though [s]he never felt le[s]s inclined to [s]leep. Yet [s]he endeavoured to obey her young lady, [s]aid her prayers, and addre[s][s]ed her[s]elf to [s]leep. The next morning, Rawlins was di[s]patched to the neare[s]t [s]ea-port, to inquire for a ve[s][s]el, and from [s]ome unfor[s]een accidents, he was detained nearly a week. During this interval, the daily, nay, almo[s]t hourly opportunities Sir Egbert had of conver[s]ing with Columbia, and ob[s]erving her mildne[s]s, mode[s]ty, and under[s]tanding, which had been highly cultivated by the tender and careful hand of maternal affection, inspired him with a pa[s][s]ion ardent as it was [s]incere; and he could not repel the ri[s]ing wi[s]hes of his heart, that this lovely creature might be ordained his partner, to [s]mooth the rugged path of life. Columbia had not been in[s]en[s]ible to the many virtues and graces of Sir Egbert; but [s]he had not learnt to di[s]gui[s]e her thoughts from her be[s]t and only friend. She con[s]idered it no crime to love a worthy and accomplished man, and her mother became the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] confidant of her pa[s][s]ion almo[s]t as [s]oon as [s]he di[s]covered it her[s]elf. "I cannot blame you, my child," [s]aid this indulgent parent, "for the admiration and e[s]teem you feel for Sir Egbert Gorges; but I would wi[s]h my dear Columbia had [s]een a little more of the world, before [s]he [s]elected a partner for life. You are yet [s]carcely eighteen, and Sir Egbert is almo[s]t the fir[s]t man you have [s]een above the rank of a clown. It is to be hoped, my love, we [s]hall not always be [s]ecluded in this [s]olitary Ca[s]tle. I under[s]tand from Sir Egbert, that queen Mary's health is in a declining [s]tate. Should [s]he die without i[s][s]ue, her [s]i[s]ter Elizabeth is next heir to the throne. Elizabeth is her[s]elf a Prote[s]tant, and will no doubt encourage all the profe[s][s]ors of that religion. I [s]hall in that ca[s]e, for your [s]ake, my child, repair to court, and petition for a re[s]titution of your father's lands. I have al[s]o another duty to fulfil. A dear friend of mine, who [s]uffered death a few years after your father, in her la[s]t moments recommended her infant [s]on to my care. Should [s]o fortunate an event take place as the prince[s]s Elizabeth's acce[s][s]ion to the throne, I [s]hall to her protecting care recommend this la[s]t branch of an unfortunate family, the innocent part of which have been the [s]ufferers for the guilty ambition of the re[s]t." "I apprehend madam," [s]aid Columbia, "that you mean the offspring of the Lord Guilford Dudley and lady Jane. Cora informed me of their unfortunate exaltation and confequent death; and I have no doubt but the royal Elizabeth will, [s]hould [s]he ever have the power, re[s]tore to him his rank and the fortunes of his ance[s]tors." "Heaven grant that I may [s]ee the day," [s]aid I[s]abelle. "And now, my dear child, though I would not put any re[s]traint on your inclinations, I could wi[s]h you to decline a union with Sir Egbert Gorges, till quieter and more pro[s]perous times. Enter into no [s]erious engagements with him, which hereafter may cau[s]e you much unea[s]ine[s]s. Mix fir[s]t with the world. The heart is apt to be deceived in its fir[s]t emotions, when little knowledge of the world, and [s]eclu[s]ion from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] [s]ociety, prevents a free election; and the object who, when the only one, appeared to have every attraction, to pro[s][s]e[s]s every virtue, when compared with others of more [s]hining talents, lo[s]es the charm that had at fir[s]t engaged the affections. The di[s]appointment then becomes intolerable, and the unfortunate victim of inexperience pa[s][s]es a life of uncea[s]ing regret and fruitle[s]s repining. I will confe[s]s to you, that Sir Egbert has [s]poken to me on this [s]ubject, and I then advi[s]ed him, as I now advi[s]e you; and I hope my dear child will not find a difficulty in following advice, that can have no other end in view than her happine[s]s." "I cannot he[s]itate a moment, my dear mother," [s]aid Columbia, "to promi[s]e that your wi[s]hes, which to me are commands, will ever be ob[s]erved as laws. Think not, beloved parent, that your child was [s]o weary of your [s]ociety, as to renounce it for that of a [s]tranger, whom [s]he had [s]carcely known a week. Oh no! however partial my heart may be, I could wi[s]h to be better a[s][s]ured of the merits of the object, before I gave my future happine[s]s into his keeping. Let Sir Egbert pur[s]ue his intended voyage; if at [s]ome future period he [s]hould return [s]till con[s]tant to me, I think I can an[s]wer for the [s]tability of my affections." "Make no ra[s]h promi[s]es, my dear child," [s]aid I[s]abelle, Columbia bowed her head a[s][s]entingly, and remained [s]ilent. Rawlins now returned, with intelligence that a vessel for Am[s]terdam would be ready to [s]ail in the cour[s]e of three days. On the morning of the [s]econd day, therefore, Sir Egbert, and his faithful Rawlins, departed; the former having, with many thanks for her ho[s]pitality, taken leave of his fair ho[s]te[s]s, and entreated her permi[s][s]ion for Columbia to accept a [s]mall diamond ring in remembrance of him; which, as it was of trifling value, [s]he allowed, at the [s]ame time presenting him with a plain gold one from her own finger, [s]aying, "I know you will conde[s]cend to accept this in token of amity, for trifles become valuable when we e[s]teem the giver." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] Mina had, at parting from Rawlins, received from him a [s]mall [s]ilver coin, on which with his knife he had marked the initials of his name, and over the letters were two hearts. A puncture was made near the extremity, and a [s]tring being pa[s][s]ed through it, Mina [s]u[s]pended this pledge of affection round her neck. But Mina, though [s]he fancied her[s]elf in love pa[s]t cure, and that [s]he [s]hould be con[s]tant through long ab[s]ence and trials of every kind, was a [s]tranger to her own heart. She was by nature a coquette, fond of admiration, and plea[s]ed with tho[s]e gave it. She loved Rawlins, becau[s]e he had pro[s]e[s][s]ed to love her. But, alas! poor Mina, when [s]he u[s]ed daily pathetically to lament the ab[s]ence of her lover, had [s]he but [s]earched her heart thoroughly, [s]he would have discovered that it was the flattery [s]he mi[s][s]ed; and that food of female vanity, artfully admini[s]tered by any other per[s]on, would [s]oon have effectually bani[s]hed the remembrance of Rawlins, and dried up her tears for his departure. Far differently affected was the heart of Columbia. Her partiality to Sir Egbert was fanctioned by the voice of rea[s]on. She felt that, was [s]he his wi[s]e, [s]he could brave every hard[s]hip with him without repining. For his [s]ake [s]he would then have faced persecution, poverty, famine, nay, death it[s]elf. But at the [s]ame time [s]he forcibly felt, that to de[s]cend in the [s]malle[s]t legree from the re[s]pect [s]he owed her[s]elf, from that nece[s][s]ary pride and dignity of manner which is the [s]afeguard of female honour, would be no longer to de[s]erve him. When engaged in [s]tudies that enriched her mind and expanded her under[s]tanding, [s]he thought [s]uch employment would render her a more plea[s]ing companion to Sir Egbert. He was [s]eldom from her thoughts in her waking hours, and frequently vi[s]ited her dreams; and in her daily devotions were mingled con[s]tant prayers for his [s]afety. Yet Columbia was not totally dive[s]ted of that vanity, which in her childi[s]h years had formed [s]o [s]triking a trait in her character; but it had been [s]o judiciously repelled and corrected by her mother, that no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] more of it remained than [s]erved as a foil to her virtues. She knew [s]he was hand[s]ome, and [s]he [s]tudied to [s]et off that beauty by humility, benevolence, [s]implicity and candour. Confu[s]ion, Di[s]tre[s]s, unexpected Journey. A bove eighteen months after the departure of Sir Egbert pa[s][s]ed in the u[s]ual way, in which time Rawlins had twice been to Au[s]tenbury Ca[s]tle with letters from his ma[s]ter. But the enemies of Gorges, encouraged by Mary, pur[s]ued him with [s]uch unrelenting fury, that he dared not him[s]elf venture to England. It was in the [s]ummer of 1558, that an event took place which had nearly put a period to the life of lady I[s]abelle, and involved her daughter in accumulated mi[s]ery. A report had been circulated, that the child of lady Jane and lord Guilford Dudley was in exi[s]tence, and in the protection of a Prote[s]tant family. The furious zeal of Mary in[s]pired her with the idea, that by getting this infant into her power, and having him educated in the Catholic religion, [s]he [s]hould render Heaven an acceptable piece of [s]ervice, and entirely atone to the child for the death of his parents, the [s]igning of who[s]e death-warrant [s]ometimes lay heavy on her con[s]cience; and in tho[s]e fits of gloomy remorse, [s]he always had recour[s]e to her gho[s]tly confessor for [s]piritual advice and comfort, who upon the[s]e occa[s]ions did not fail to inflame her mind, and render her bigotry more ob[s]tinate. This man, who was in the confidence of Gardiner, bi[s]hop of Winche[s]ter, encouraged the queen in her defire to get young Dudley into her power; and accordingly, diligent inquiry was made after the place of his [s]eclu[s]ion. At length, accident di[s]covered what they had begun to de[s]pair of. Sir James Howard, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] younger branch of the hou[s]e of Norfolk, (a family renowned for their attachment to the Catholic persuasion,) a man in high favour with the queen, and in habits of [s]trict intimacy with Gardiner, Bonner, and the re[s]t of the per[s]ecuting party, having received an invitation to [s]pend the decline of the [s]ummer in Wales, at the [s]eat of Sir Owen Langwylling, and partake of the diver[s]ions of hunting and [s]hooting, in the beginning of Augu[s]t, repaired to the antique man[s]ion of his friend. Sir Owen was young, gay, and fond of di[s][s]ipation and expen[s]ive plea[s]ures, which the [s]mallne[s]s of his paternal inheritance would not permit him to enjoy to the extent he wi[s]hed. Howard was rich in money, as well as in court favour; and Sir Owen invited him into Wales, in hopes the youth and beauty of his only [s]i[s]ter, Winifreda, might catch his affections, and at once [s]ecure an honourable alliance for her[s]elf, and a powerful friend for him. It was during this vi[s]it, that Howard, tired one evening with the rude and turbulent mirth of his ho[s]t and his Wel[s]h a[s][s]ociates, left them to fini[s]h their u[s]ual libations to Bacchus; and mounting his hor[s]e, on who[s]e neck he [s]uffered the reins to re[s]t, giving a loo[s]e to reflection, and intending only to e[s]cape from disgusting [s]ociety, and enjoy the plea[s]ures of retirement and contemplation, he permitted the animal to take what cour[s]e he plea[s]ed. Nor was his attention aroused as to the time he had been ab[s]ent, till, coming suddenly out of a wood into a wide-extended heath, he perceived the [s]un was drawing near the we[s]tern horizon; and turning his hor[s]e with a de[s]ign to mea[s]ure back the path he had trod on the [s]ummit of a hill, he [s]aw Au[s]tenbury Ca[s]tle. The parting beams of the [s]un [s]hone full on the venerable ruin, and his rays gave an uncommon richne[s]s to the [s]urrounding pro[s]pect. Curio[s]ity urged him on, and once more turning his [s]teed, he proceeded at a good pace up the hill. It has been ob[s]erved, that the mo[s]t ruinous part of this Ca[s]tle was that which fronted the heath; and Howard, having led his hor[s]e over a broken [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] drawbridge, which appeared as though it had not been raised for more than a century pa[s]t, fa[s]tened his bridle to a ring which had formerly [s]upported a [s]wing gate, or private entrance to the fortified part of the Ca[s]tle, and proceeded through an aperture in the wall immediately into the garden, the neatne[s]s and cultivation of which convinced him there were inhabitants in the Ca[s]tle. He went forward, and at the extremity of the garden, in the arbour before mentioned as the [s]cene of Columbia's childi[s]h [s]ports and fe[s]tivity, he [s]aw a female, tying up a bunch of reeds in the form of a wheat [s]heaf, and a boy [s]tanding be[s]ide her, apparently about five years of age. As he approached nearer, the beauty of Mina [s]truck him with [s]urpri[s]e. For it was [s]he who had been walking with young Dudley, who was now become an inmate at the Ca[s]tle, and who wanted to go into the water after the reeds, that he might play at reaping. She had gathered a few to divert him, and was employed in binding them up, when Howard approached them. He [s]poke before [s]he [s]aw him. She [s]tarted from her [s]eat, and the blood mounted to her cheeks. But Howard was young, hand[s]ome, and addre[s][s]ed her with [s]uch an air of gallantry, that [s]he [s]oon recovered her[s]elf, and felt more inclined to be plea[s]ed than alarmed at his intru[s]ion. Night was now rapidly approaching, and our knight was chagrined at it. He wi[s]hed to have entertained the pretty, blu[s]hing Mina with expre[s][s]ions of his admiration and wonder, to [s]ee [s]o much loveline[s]s thus buried in [s]olitude; but time would not permit. He a[s]ked, however, a few tri[s]ling que[s]tions, ventured to take her hand and ki[s]s it, care[s][s]ed the child, and presenting Mina with a jewel which he took from his beaver, and which he had ob[s]erved [s]he eyed with attention, reque[s]ted her to meet him there again early the next morning. "But be [s]ure, pretty creature," [s]aid he, "you do not mention having [s]een me to your father and mother." "I have no father and mother, Sir," [s]aid Mina. "Well, then, to your uncle, or aunt, or grandmother." "La! Sir," [s]aid Mina, with [s]imple earne[s]tne[s]s, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] "I have no relations; I am only poor Mina, and live here in the old Ca[s]tle with my lady." "And who is your lady?" "The lady I[s]abelle Arundel." "Well, you need not tell her, or any body, that you have [s]een me; I have a particular rea[s]on for it. I will be here by [s]ix o'clock to-morrow morning." Mina promi[s]ed [s]ilence, and dropping a curtefy, wished him a good night. The thoughts of this [s]imple girl were agitated and confu[s]ed, as [s]he proceeded towards the hou[s]e. She was re[s]olved not to mention the [s]tranger; but then Henry, he might tell the lady I[s]abelle. But to prevent this, immediately on her entering the Ca[s]tle, [s]he put the child to bed, and then repairing to her lady, gave as a rea[s]on for having done [s]o, that he was tired with his walk. The u[s]ual avocations of the evening [s]o entirely occupied Mina, that [s]he had no time to think, till the hour of retirement. No [s]ooner was [s]he in her own apartment, than, drawing the jewel from her pocket, [s]he compared it with the [s]ilver token of Rawlins' honest love. "It is much finer," [s]aid [s]he, delighted with its lu[s]tre; "but then what will poor Rawlins [s]ay, if I [s]hould prove fal[s]e-hearted?" A deep [s]igh, as this reflection pa[s][s]ed through her mind, [s]eemed to tell her, the a[s][s]ignation [s]he had made with the gallant [s]tranger was improper. But Mina po[s][s]e[s][s]ed that unfortunate po[s]ition of di[s]po[s]ition, that unfits its po[s][s]e[s][s]or for opposition of any kind. Her inclination to keep her appointment was [s]trong, and the courtly manner, hand[s]ome per[s]on, and rich pre[s]ent of Howard, had [s]uch an effect upon her deluded [s]en[s]es, as to lead her to imagine [s]he had never loved Rawlins half [s]o well, as [s]he found [s]he was inclined to love him. Had the lady Columbia been pre[s]ent, [s]he would no doubt, notwith[s]tanding her promi[s]e to the contrary, have confided to her the intru[s]ion of the [s]tranger, and her promi[s]e to [s]ee him again in the morning. Indeed, full of her own prai[s]es which [s]he had heard from his lips, and occupied entirely in reflecting on his fine per[s]on and rich dre[s]s, [s]he wi[s]hed for nothing more [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] ardently than an opportunity to repeat it all to her young lady. But Columbia now [s]lept in an apartment by her[s]elf, and the young Dudley partook of Mina's bed; [s]o the [s]ecret was of nece[s][s]ity confined to her own bosom. Its importance in her ideas, was [s]ufficient to bani[s]h [s]leep from her eyes; and [s]he impatiently counted the clock till it [s]truck four. "Well, two hours will be [s]oon pa[s]t," [s]aid [s]he, and immediately began to dre[s]s her[s]elf. But quick as her impatient wi[s]hes led her to imagine they might pa[s]s, when [s]he was anxiously counting every minute, [s]he thought the period an eternity. Having dre[s][s]ed her[s]elf, [s]he de[s]cended to the great hall, and thought to be [s]ure it mu[s]t be near five; but poor Mina was deceived in her calculation, and found it but a quarter pa[s]t four. She li[s]tened, [s]he watched the hand, [s]he could [s]carcely perceive it move; it had certainly [s]topped; her lady would be up, [s]he [s]hould be prevented meeting the [s]tranger. Impelled by this idea, [s]he had walked more than a dozen times from the hall to the arbour and back again, and [s]till it was [s]carcely half-pa[s]t five. At length the long expected [s]tranger was [s]een approaching; for he had been impelled by a curio[s]ity, as re[s]tle[s]s as the new born pa[s][s]ion of Mina, to repair early to the place of a[s][s]ignation. As he had lei[s]urely walked his hor[s]e homeward the evening before, he had reflected on the name of Mina's lady. Arundel! It was [s]urely the widow of Sir Thomas Arundel; if [s]o, the intimate friend of lady Jane Grey. Might not that boy be the long-[s]ought offspring of Dudley? If [s]o, how would it elevate him in the queen's favour, to inform her where the boy might be found! Let no one blame Howard; he thought it right to endeavour to [s]natch the child from the dangers of what he termed an heretical education; he acted from principle; and it were well for every one, who courts the favour of the great, if they could lay their hands on their hearts, and with truth a[s][s]ert the [s]ame. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] In his conver[s]ation with the artle[s]s and infatuated Mina, he drew from her every circum[s]tance he wi[s]hed to know. Her inexperienced heart, fa[s]cinated with his flattery, and thinking him all that was amiable on earth, could not imagine him a Catholic. She thought he profe[s][s]ed the [s]ame religion with her lady and herself. He perceived her error, and [s]uffered it to continue, till he made him[s]elf acquainted with every particular within the knowledge of Mina; and in the end triumphed in the [s]poils of her innocence. For three weeks, an illicit intercour[s]e was carried on between them; during which period Howard had [s]ent intelligence to his friend Gardiner, that the object of their hitherto fruitle[s]s [s]earch was now within their reach. At the name of Arundel, Gardiner felt all his hatred revive towards the widow and child of his departed enemy; and, glad of an opportunity to wreak on them the vengeance which the blood of the hu[s]band and father had not [s]ated, eagerly flew to the queen, and obtained from her an order to oblige the lady Isabelle, and her daughter Columbia, with their young charge Henry Dudley, to repair immediately to London; and in ca[s]e of he[s]itation and reluctance, to bring them away by force. It was morning; breakfa[s]t had been removed; Isabelle and Columbia were employed at their needles. Mina was reading (as was the cu[s]tom of that lady to make either her daughter or her attendant do every morning) [s]ome extracts from a book of devotion. A violent knocking at the gate alarmed them. Matthias, with all the ha[s]te his advanced age would permit, went to open it. In a moment the court was filled with hor[s]emen, [s]olders and friars, and at their head was Sir James Howard, who was appointed to command the party, and conduct the pri[s]oners to London. Mina's heart leaped within her. She thought her lover was come with this noble train, to claim her as his bride, (as he had frequently promi[s]ed he would) and take her with him to London. Lady I[s]abelle turned pale. Lo[s]t! ruined! undone! were all the words [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] could articulate, and [s]he [s]unk almo[s]t lifele[s]s on the neare[s]t [s]eat. The little Dudley was playing in the hall, when Howard and Sir Owen entered. Unu[s]ed to danger, unacquainted with fear, he ran to the brave gentlemen, as he called them, admired their waving plumes and laced doublets; and hanging on the hilt of Howard's [s]word, told him he remembered when he came through the broken wall into the garden. This circum[s]tance, which a variety of other childi[s]h amusements had contributed to efface, had lain dormant in his youthful mind, till the appearance of Howard; who happening to wear the [s]ame dre[s]s then, as when the child fir[s]t [s]aw him, brought it fre[s]h to his memory. Howard took the child in his arms; and, followed by Sir Owen and a number of other gentlemen, entered the apartment of lady I[s]abelle. Though nearly overcome by her fears, the widow of Arundel had [s]till a dignity of manner, a cha[s]te [s]everity of countenance, that awed even the mo[s]t ferocious. Sir Owen Langwylling, a man neither celebrated for his politene[s]s or [s]en[s]ibility, was a proof of this. He met the glances of her penetrating eyes, and [s]unk aba[s]hed behind Howard, mingling in the thicke[s]t of the crowd, his beaver off, and his eyes bent to the earth. I[s]abelle aro[s]e from her [s]eat at their entrance, and bowing gracefully, reque[s]ted to be informed of the cau[s]e of their vi[s]it. Howard was confu[s]ed; he hesitated as he attempted to [s]peak, and at that moment catching the eye of Mina, who [s]tood trembling behind Columbia, he bowed low, to conceal the agitation that prevented his articulating a [s]ingle [s]entence. At length recovering, and ob[s]tinately fixing his eyes in [s]uch a manner as not to be able to catch a glimp[s]e of Mina, he thus addre[s][s]ed the lady I[s]abelle. "Our augu[s]t [s]overeign Mary, queen of England, hearing that Henry Dudley, [s]on and heir to the lord Guilford Dudley, (who [s]uffered with his unfortunate lady for their attempt upon the Briti[s]h crown) is under your lady[s]hip's protection, and wi[s]hing to compensate to the child for the enforced rigour with which [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] was obliged to treat his parents, has commi[s][s]ioned me, James Howard, in conjunction with the[s]e noblemen and eccle[s]ia[s]tics, to bring the boy to her court, that the may re[s]tore to him the title and e[s]tates of his father, and have him educated in the principles of that holy religion, which alone leads to [s]alvation." The full conviction of the imprudence [s]he had been quilty of, and the duplicity Howard had practi[s]ed, how fla[s]hed on the mind of Mina. She gave a faint cream, and [s]unk lifele[s]s to the floor. Cora, whom the general confu[s]ion had brought to the apartment, a[s][s]i[s]ted to rai[s]e her, and [s]he was borne into the open air. It was not till [s]he was quite out of the room, that the lovely form of Columbia attracted the notice of Howard. He beheld her following, with books of the tendere[s]t [s]en[s]ibility, the apparently lifele[s]s form of her [s]ervant, and in a moment every other object was obliterated from his mind. He [s]eemed attentive to the lady I[s]abelle as [s]he [s]poke, but his ears drank not one word of what [s]he uttered; nor was he awakened from his trance of admiration, till [s]he ceased [s]peaking, and prepared to lead her daughter from the room. He then endeavoured to recollect him[s]elf, and a[s]ked, "If [s]he would not accompany her young charge to London?" "I thought I had expre[s][s]ed my intention [s]o to do," replied I[s]abelle, with a look of [s]urpri[s]e; "if you, Sir James, did not under[s]tand me, I here repeat that I will go with him. Not to re[s]ign my precious charge to the queen, but to a[s][s]ert my prior right, the right of friend[s]hip, [s]ealed by a mo[s]t [s]olemn vow, that Henry Dudley [s]hould be educated in the religion of his patents. I know you will tell me there are tortures to enforce obedience to the queen's will; but I have learnt to de[s]pi[s]e them. Happine[s]s and I have long been separated, nor do I hope ever to ta[s]te it more, till, in the realms of bli[s]s, I am again united to my martyred friends and hu[s]band. Think not, then, the threats of death can terrify me. Death is the only period I can look forward to with camlne[s]s, hope and comfort." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] She then [s]lightly bowed her head, and taking young Dudley in her right hand, and leaning on her daughter with her left, [s]he pa[s][s]ed into an inner apartment. In half an hour's time, [s]he [s]ent a me[s][s]age, intimating that [s]he would be ready to attend their orders by four o'clock the en[s]uing morning. In the mean time, [s]he reque[s]ted they would make them[s]elves welcome to whatever her poor habitation afforded. It was late in the day before Mina was [s]ufficiently recovered to be able to quit her apartment. The weather had been [s]ultry, the anxiety of her mind had countributed to enervate her frame; and as [s]he attempted to walk, the univer[s]al debility and weakne[s]s which [s]he experienced alarmed her. She thought the air might refre[s]h her. Pa[s][s]ing from her chamber through the hall the garden, the fir[s]t object that met her view as [s]he de[s]cended the [s]teps, was Rawlins. She trembled, [s]he ga[s]ped for breath; but [s]he recalled her fleeting [s]en[s]es, and ha[s]tily gliding down the [s]teps, catching his hand, in [s]ilence hurried him to an ob[s]cure part of the garden. There, as [s]oon as the tumultuous throbbings of her heart would permit her to [s]peak, in a few words [s]he unfolded to him the unhappy situation of her lady and family; but [s]hame prevented her revealing the unfortunate part [s]he had unintentionally had in their ruin. "If you have any letters," [s]aid [s]he, "give them me quick, and then fly and conceal your[s]elf in the we[s]tern ruins till I can bring you an[s]wers, which you mu[s]t with all [s]peed convey to your ma[s]ter." Rawlins gave her the letters, and would have embraced her; but con[s]cious guilt made her [s]hrink from him, and covering her face with her hand, [s]he waved him toward the place of concealment, and returned to the hou[s]e. She pa[s][s]ed unob[s]erved to the apartment of her lady, and delivered the packet to the hands of Columbia. Fortunately Rawlins had not been [s]een by any of Howard's party; and I[s]abelle, having a[s][s]ured her[s]elf of this, determined by his means to [s]end Henry [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] Dudley into Holland, to Sir Egbert Gorges. She even urged Columbia to fly with the child from the perfecution that awaited them. But that heroic girl refused to de[s]ert her mother in the hour of di[s]tre[s]s. "Besides," [s]aid [s]he, "the [s]afety of Henry will be more certain, when Rawlins has no woman with him, with her fears and her weakne[s]s, to impede his journey." I[s]abelle, anxious to put her plan in execution, at night-fall [s]ent a me[s][s]age to Howard and his followers, craving their excu[s]e, that the preparations for the morning's journey would not permit her to [s]ee them again that night; but that [s]he hoped they would not [s]pare her poor provi[s]ions, and as early in the morning as they plea[s]ed, [s]he would commence her journey. Mina, who delivered this me[s][s]age to them as they were taking their repa[s]t in the great hall, led young Dudley by the hand round to bid them all good-night; then through an apartment, which by a private door communicated with the we[s]tern wing, [s]he conveyed him immediately to Rawlins, who waited till midnight; and then mounting his hor[s]e, with the child before him, proceeded with all po[s][s]ible [s]peed to the neare[s]t [s]ea-port, where the bark he had come over in laying ready, he went immediately on board, and prevailed on the ma[s]ter, by promi[s]es of a large reward, to put directly to [s]ea. The fortitude Mina had been obliged to exert in the execution of this plan was almo[s]t too much for her frame to [s]upport. The facing the perjured Howard, and delivering to him a me[s][s]age from her lady, the taking what [s]he firmly believed to be a la[s]t farewel of Rawlins, were excruciating trials. But [s]he thought the [s]evere[s]t [s]ufferings were too little to atone for the mi[s]chief [s]he had brought on the hou[s]e of Arundel; and the con[s]olatory reflection that [s]he had been the means of [s]aving one innocent victim from the power of Mary, having [s]hed a temporary calm over her [s]oul, [s]he enjoyed a few hours repo[s]e, which in [s]ome degree enabled her to [s]upport the confu[s]ion of the en[s]uing day. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] By three o'clock, Howard and his followers were in motion. I[s]abelle heard them, and awaking Columbia and Mina, who that night both [s]lept in her chamber, they equipped them[s]elves for their journey. Their clothes had been previou[s]ly packed the night before, and [s]ent down [s]tairs. As the clock [s]truck four, the widow of Arundel, with her daughter and attendant, de[s]cended the great [s]tair-ca[s]e into the hall. Howard received them at the foot of the [s]tairs; but not perceiving the child, eagerly inquired for him. "He is gone," [s]aid I[s]abelle, with a dignified compo[s]ure; "but that he has e[s]caped is not your fault. I have [s]ent him out of the reach of bigotry and cruelty, and am now ready to go and answer to the queen for my crime. It is I, I only, that am guilty, if guilt it can be termed. And I do entreat you, Sir James Howard, and you, holy fathers, who[s]e profe[s][s]ion is peace and mercy, [s]uffer not the[s]e children to be in[s]ulted or puni[s]hed for my faults. To you, Sir James, I [s]olemnly commit the [s]afety of my daughter; that young woman is her attendant. Attached to her from almo[s]t infancy, I do be[s]eech you let them not be [s]eparated. Your family is noble, you wear the badge of a [s]oldier; I [s]hould hope you would neither di[s]grace the one or the other by injuring unprotected women, whom ill fortune only has thrown into your power. Now I am ready to [s]et forward, and Heaven be my [s]upport." The maje[s]ty of her manner as [s]he [s]poke, awed them into [s]ilence. Sir James Howard, confounded by the pointed rebuke [s]he had innocently given him, when [s]he recommended her daughter to his protection, had not power to an[s]wer; nor was it till they had proceeded a con[s]iderable way on their journey, that they began to con[s]ider the very fooli[s]h appearance they [s]hould make at the court of Mary without Henry Dudley, who had been the chief object of their excursion. During the journey, which the badne[s]s of the roads and the heat of the weather rendered fatiguing and tedious in the extreme, Howard let no opportunity [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] pa[s]s in which he thought he could effectually pay his court to Columbia. But the confe[s][s]ion of Mina (who on the fir[s]t night after their departure from Austenbury Ca[s]tle, had on her knees to her a[s]toni[s]hed ladies revealed the whole of her imprudence, and Howard's [s]eductive arts) would have effectually [s]teeled her heart again[s]t him, had there been no other motive for her rejection. But with [s]uch a woman as Columbia, the levity and unmeaning gallantry of Sir James Howard could make no impre[s][s]ion on her heart; e[s]pecially when it is remembered [s]he had been previou[s]ly awakened to [s]en[s]ibility by the intrin[s]ic merit of Sir Egbert Gorges. I[s]abelle and her daughter bore the journey better than could have been expected, and on the tenth day from the commencement of it, they arrived in London. Mina had drooped from the beginning, and was on their arrival [s]o ill, from [s]atigue and grief, that there [s]eemed but little hopes of her recovery. The old [s]ervants, Cora and Matthias, were left in the Ca[s]tle, heart-broken for the departure of their kind and beloved mi[s]tre[s]s. Their [s]olitary days were passed in enumerating her virtues, and in offering up prayers for her [s]afe and [s]peedy return. Revolution---Tranquillity re[s]tored. On the arrival of I[s]abelle and her daughter in London, they were committed to clo[s]e consinement; though by the care of Howard, who[s]e power kept the eccle[s]ia[s]tics at a di[s]tance, they were treated with re[s]pect. The en[s]uing morning I[s]abelle was ordered to attend the queen. With a mo[s]t threatening a[s]pect did Mary interrogate her on the [s]ubject of Henry Dudley's escape, and demanded to know where [s]he had [s]ent him. The widow of Arundel was inflexible. She only [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] replied, that [s]he had [s]ent him to a place of [s]afety; that in [s]o doing [s]he only conceived [s]he had performed her duty, [s]ince, being her[s]elf convinced of the errors of the Catholic per[s]ua[s]ion, [s]he had given by letter a solemn promi[s]e to his dying mother, that whil[s]t [s]he lived, Henry [s]hould be carefully in[s]tructed in the tenets of the reformed religion. Irritated beyond expre[s][s]ion by the noble firmne[s]s, which the termed ob[s]tinacy, of the lady I[s]abelle, Mary commanded her from her pre[s]ence; at the [s]ame time giving orders for her to be put to the torture, to force a confe[s][s]ion from her. But Gardiner, who was present, and conceived this would be an impolitic mea[s]ure of the queen's, humbly entreated a few days might be allowed for reflection. "Perhaps, mo[s]t gracious sovereign," [s]aid the de[s]igning prelate, "your royal clemency may have a more powerful effect on the generous mind of lady Arundel, than rigour; and the power of gratitude may draw from her a [s]ecret, which the mo[s]t cruel tortures might not effect. I[s]abelle was preparing to [s]peak again, but Howard, who feared [s]he might too far irritate the queen, and trembling for the fate of Columbia, hurried her out of the pre[s]ence. Having committed her to the guards, who waited to re-conduct her to pri[s]on, he returned to the queen, and informed her of his pa[s][s]ion for the daughter of the haughty I[s]abelle. "She is young, royal madam," [s]aid he, "and if I can judge of her di[s]po[s]ition by her countenance, might be ea[s]ily converted to the true religion; for [s]he appears all compliance, affability and gentlene[s]s. Permit me to try to bring her over to our party. When once convinced of the errors of the faith [s]he now professes, it will become a point of con[s]cience with her to retrieve young Dudley from his pre[s]ent lo[s]t [s]tate." "I [s]uppo[s]e this girl is hand[s]ome?" [s]aid Mary. "I [s]hould call her [s]uperlatively [s]o, had I never [s]een your maje[s]ty," replied Howard, bowing profoundly. Mary, though at this period pa[s]t her forticth year, naturally plain in her per[s]on, and now more than ever [s]o from the ravages of a de[s]ea[s]e which daily gained [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] ground and began to give [s]ome very alarming symptoms, was [s]till open to the voice of [s]tattery. The compliment of Howard had an in[s]tantaneous effect on her temper. She [s]miled, and told him [s]he would [s]ee this paragon. "I will conver[s]e with her my[s]elf," [s]aid [s]he, "and endeavour to draw her by per[s]ua[s]ive arguments to the true faith. But if I fail, let her and her proud mother beware. Her beauty [s]hall not [s]ave them; they [s]hall [s]ubmit to the puni[s]hment appointed for ob[s]tinate heretics." Columbia had [s]uffered almo[s]t a martyrdom in the ab[s]ence of her mother; a thou[s]and fears had distracted her. Sometimes [s]he imagined [s]he [s]hould never [s]ee her again; that the furious queen, provoked by her refu[s]al to di[s]cover the retreat of Henry Dudley, would doom her immediately to the [s]take; then would [s]he wring her hands, and utter the mo[s]t piercing lamentation, in which [s]he was joined by Mina, who[s]e di[s]tre[s]s was the more poignant, as it was mingled with [s]elf-accu[s]ation. At length [s]he beheld her return, and her joy was for a few moments as wild as had been her [s]orrow. I[s]abelle was convinced within her own mind, that the hour drew near in which [s]he would be called upon to [s]eal her faith with her blood, and endeavoured to arm her[s]elf with patience and fortitude for the expected trial. Every ha[s]ty [s]tep [s]he heard, every unusual noi[s]e that i[s][s]ued from the [s]treet, [s]he imagined was the me[s][s]enger of her fate. But [s]he carefully concealed the[s]e thoughts from her daughter, thinking to [s]ave her the mi[s]ery of hourly expecting an event that would leave her an unprotected orphan, and which, however [s]he might lament, [s]he had no power either to prevent or retard. They partook but [s]paringly of a repa[s]t that was brought them, when I[s]abelle endeavoured to divert her own and Columbia's melancholy by conver[s]ation; at the [s]ame time [s]electing tho[s]e [s]ubjects which might tend to [s]trengthen and fortify their minds again[s]t impending misfortune. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] The afternoon was not more than half worn, when Howard arrived with the queen's mandate for Columbia to repair forthwith to the palace. It was then the tender mother had need of all her fortitude. In vain [s]he pleaded to be permitted to go with her child; it was contrary to the commands of Mary. Finding entreaty fruitle[s]s, [s]he embraced her with tenderne[s]s, and [s]aid, "Remember, my child, thy mother's happine[s]s depends on thee. Oh beware! Suffer no temptation, however great, to draw thee from thy duty to thy Creator. No, Columbia, not even to [s]ave the life of thy mother, let thy faith be [s]haken. If I mu[s]t [s]uffer, let me at lea[s]t have the con[s]olation of reflecting, in my la[s]t hours, that my child preferred misery to apo[s]tacy." "Fear me not, beloved parent," replied Columbia, returning her embrace, "I can never forget the noble examples of firmne[s]s and re[s]olution [s]et me by my ancestors; and if the remembrance of tho[s]e [s]hould fail to animate me, I will think that my failure in [s]o important a point would call a blu[s]h into the face of my mother; and that would give me [s]trength to withstand all temptation, however alluring, and de[s]y all threats, all tortures, however terrible to human nature. Pray for me, my mother, pray for your poor child." She [s]ell on her mother's neck, and [s]obbed aloud. Howard re-a[s][s]ured them, by pledging his [s]olemn word, that no evil was intended; and taking her reluctant hand, led her from her mother into the pre[s]ence of the queen. Columbia, though endowed with all the rigid virtues that [s]o eminently adorned her mother, yet had an appearance of more [s]oftne[s]s; and the awe a young per[s]on, totally unacquainted with the forms of courts, as well as of the world in general, might be [s]uppo[s]ed to feel on finding her[s]elf in the pre[s]ence of her sovereign, and that [s]overeign incen[s]ed again[s]t her, gave her an air of timidity and humility highly gratifying to the pride of Mary. The queen que[s]tioned her concerning the departure of young Dudley. "He went away with a [s]ervant [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] belonging to a particular friend of my mother's," [s]aid [s]he, "who wi[s]hed me to have gone too, but my love for the be[s]t of parents, and my con[s]cience, which told me I [s]hould be wanting in filial duty, prevented my embracing the propo[s]al." "Con[s]cience?" [s]aid Mary, fiercely, "the con[s]cience of a heretic cannot be [s]uppo[s]ed very tender; tell me, are you not a heretic?" "I do not under[s]tand the meaning of the appellation," replied Columbia mildly. "I will endeavour to explain it to you," [s]aid the queen; "come, child, be not alarmed. I will talk with you a little on religious matters. Your ignorance is really pitiable, but it is more your misfortune than your fault." "I humbly pray your maje[s]ty to pardon me," replied Columbia; "I am a weak girl, and totally inadequate to the ta[s]k of [s]peaking on [s]o reverend a subject, e[s]pecially before a per[s]on of your maje[s]ty's superior under[s]tanding and exten[s]ive erudition I have hitherto lived a peaceful, happy life, unknowing and unknown; where, to the extent of my abilities, I have endeavoured, [s]trengthened as I was by the example of a re[s]pectable mother, to di[s]charge my duty both to my Creator and my fellow creatures. I be[s]eech your maje[s]ty, [s]uffer me to return to that calm retirement, where the remainder of my days may glide on in obscurity, and my name pa[s]s quietly into oblivion." "I fear," [s]aid Mary, "you entertain erroneous ideas of your duties, both moral and religious. Your faith and mine are different." Columbia was [s]ilent. "I will appoint [s]ome holy men to vi[s]it your mother in her retirement," continued the queen, "and they [s]hall al[s]o in[s]truct you in the tenets of our holy church. Are you willing to be in[s]tructed and converted?" "I am willing to be in[s]tructed by wife and good per[s]ons," replied Columbia; "I will li[s]ten to them with patience; and if my rea[s]on is convinced---" "It mu[s]t, it will be convinced," [s]aid the queen, eagerly, "unle[s]s you wilfully [s]hut your eyes and ears." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] "And that I hope I never [s]hall do," [s]aid Columbia, fervently, "again[s]t the light of truth." Mary was [s]atisfied, and di[s]mi[s][s]ed her, and [s]he was conveyed by the guards to the arms of her impatient and anxious mother. Both Howard and the queen from this interview entertained [s]anguine hopes of converting Columbia. They did not perceive that all her an[s]wers were ambiguous, and might have been explained in a very different [s]en[s]e than the one they took them in. Howard [s]eized the favourable moment of the queen's good humour, to reque[s]t the charge of the pri[s]oners might devolve on him. "I have a hou[s]e, mo[s]t gracious [s]overeign," [s]aid he, "not far from London; [s]ome of the apartments have heretofore been u[s]ed as a [s]tate pri[s]on. Suffer me to convey the widow of Arundel and her daughter thither; I will an[s]wer for their being kept in [s]afe cu[s]tody, with my life. In the mean time, my confe[s][s]or, with whatever other ecclesiastic your maje[s]ty may plea[s]e to appoint, can vi[s]it them every day." "I [s]ee," [s]aid the queen with a half [s]mile, "you wi[s]h to have an opportunity of pro[s]ecuting your [s]uit to the fair daughter of Arundel without interruption. Well, be it as you de[s]ire; into your charge I commit them, and at the hazard of your head," continued [s]he, sternly, "be they forth coming whenever I demand them. For by the crown of my ance[s]tors I [s]wear, they [s]hall not e[s]cape my vengeance, unle[s]s they renounce their heretical opinions, and give up young Dudley to my power." Howard, plea[s]ed that by this manoeuvre he had got the per[s]on of Columbia entirely in his power, thanked the queen for her conde[s]cen[s]ion, reiterated promi[s]es of not permitting them to e[s]cape, and ha[s]tened to the place of their con[s]inement, where he informed the lady I[s]abelle and her daughter, that he had prevailed on the queen to let him remove them to a man[s]ion of his own, not far from London. "You will there," [s]aid he, "have the benefit of the air, and the indulgence of [s]ometimes exerci[s]ing your[s]elf in the garden. But I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] have obtained this favour at the hazard of your displeasure; for I have promi[s]ed the queen that you will daily conver[s]e with eccle[s]ia[s]tics of the Catholic persuasion. Your patience one moment, dear lady," [s]eeing I[s]abelle was about to reply, "it is what you mu[s]t [s]ubmit to if you remain here. Let me on my knees entreat you, then, to [s]uffer me to convey you, and this angel your daughter, out of the reach of the tyranny of Mary. Whil[s]t you remain [s]ecluded in her palace, the in[s]truments of her power may, in the dead of night, ru[s]h in and [s]acrifice you to her vengeance; put under my roof you will at lea[s]t be [s]ecure from [s]udden in[s]ult and [s]urpri[s]e, and [s]hould [s]he menace your precious lives, I will pre[s]erve them at the hazard of my own." "Howard," [s]aid I[s]abelle, "I would [s]ain believe your profe[s][s]ions are [s]incere; but when I remember who betrayed us into the power of the queen, how can I?" This was the fir[s]t moment Howard had [s]u[s]pected that Mina had di[s]covered his frequent vi[s]its at Au[s] tenbury Ca[s]tle. He had [s]trove [s]everal times, during their journey, to draw her apart from her ladies, but in vain. She had always carefully avoided him. But this he thought proceeded from her fears of awakening [s]u[s]picion; nor did he once imagine [s]he would confide an intercour[s]e, that would appear [s]o much to her disadvantage, to the ear of a woman [s]o rigidly virtuous as I[s]abelle. It is true, I[s]abelle was rigid in her own practice; but [s]he always made a ju[s]t di[s]tinction between the errors incident to human nature, and premeditated guilt. For the folly of Mina, [s]he found an excu[s]e in her [s]implicity, and ignorance of the world; but for the art and [s]eduction practi[s]ed by Howard, [s]he felt only contempt and horror. "What reliance," continued [s]he, [s]ted[s]a[s]tly fixing her eyes on his face, "what reliance can I place on the word of a man, who by flattering promi[s]es drew an artle[s]s, innocent girl to her ruin, whil[s]t from the openness of her un[s]u[s]pecting nature, he learnt [s]ecrets, the divulging of which has plunged her only friends and benefactors in unavoidable de[s]truction?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] The cheel of Howard glowed with the crim[s]on tint of [s]hame. The penetrating eye, the forcible voice of I[s]abelle, [s]unk to his heart. "I have been to blame," [s]aid he, in accents scarcely audible, "but do not too ha[s]tily condemn me. Allow [s]omething to the impetuo[s]ity of youthful passion; and if, betrayed by an enthu[s]ia[s]tic partiality to the religion in which I was educated, I ha[s]tened to inform my [s]overeign where [s]he might find the offspring of Dudley and lady Jane, let it be [s]ome expiation of my error, that I am [s]everely puni[s]hed in having unintentionally involved two ladies in misfortune, who, to every grace that can excite admiration, unite every virtue that [s]hould command e[s]teem. Let not, I beseech you, the di[s]covery of my errors blind you to what is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary to your own intere[s]t and [s]afety, nor, by ob[s]tinately refu[s]ing the a[s]ylum I offer, heap fre[s]h guilt upon me, by making me in a manner acce[s][s]ory to your death, and that of your lovely daughter. The beauty and innocence of the fair Columbia have already awakened in the brea[s]t of Mary a malignant [s]pirit, which [s]he will be glad to gratify by [s]acrificing her to her pretended zeal; for your daughter has already expre[s][s]ed her attachment to the reformed religion, in terms too pointed to be overlooked. Another interview with the queen, and [s]he will be lo[s]t beyond recovery." Howard pau[s]ed for an an[s]wer. The mind of Isabelle was in a [s]tate of agony. Her own life would have been nothing; [s]he would have de[s]pi[s]ed the protection of Howard, and undauntedly braved the power of the queen; but her child, her darling Columbia, her fate, perhaps, hung on her an[s]wer. She was within the reach of the bigotted queen, Howard might protect, might [s]ave her. What mother, in [s]uch a ca[s]e, could he[s]itate? I[s]abelle bowed her head, and, in a voice tremulous through fear and [s]tifled indignation, a[s][s]ented to his propo[s]al. A [s]hort time [s]ufficed for preparation, and that very night they [s]lept in the hou[s]e of Howard, at Ham[s]tead, if [s]leep it could be called, when to their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] anxiety was added the di[s]appearance of Mina. came with them to the hou[s]e, retired after they taken [s]ome refre[s]hment, and when the hour of re[s]t , was not to be found. Howard was [s]u[s]pected I[s]abelle, but Howard had departed with the [s]etting , and could not be que[s]tioned. At the fir[s]t appearance of day, Columbia aro[s]e; for the fir[s]t time, eagerly counted the hours that mo[s]t probably intervene before [s]he could hope to Howard. The morning wore heavily away; I[s]abelle dejected and unea[s]y; her daughter endeavoured her own painful [s]en[s]ations, that [s]he might di the anxiety of her mother. About noon, their attention was arou[s]ed by the en of two eccle[s]ia[s]tics, who were appointed by queen to vi[s]it, exhort, and endeavour to convert two pri[s]eners. I[s]abelle heard them in [s]ilence. was [s]everal times on the point of replying; a reproving look from her mother repre[s][s]ed her before her lips could give them utterance. At the conclu[s]ion of the conference, the widow of ventured to inquire of the[s]e religious men they had any knowledge of the fate of Mina; but received from them a [s]tern reproof, and was bid more of eternal and le[s]s of temporal things, de[s]tiny was as yet undetermined, and it remain with her[s]elf whether a few days would rein her in her late hu[s]band's forfeited e[s]tates and , or [s]ign the mandate for her death. When the prie[s]ts left her, the fortitude of I[s]abelle entirely to for[s]ake her. She threw her arms and the neck of her daughter, and gave way to an gu[s]h of tears. Columbia, unprotected, on the bounty, and liable to be en[s]nared by artifice of Howard, was pictured to her imagina in colours [s]o [s]trong, that [s]he could not [s]upport idea. Thus mi[s]erably did day after day wear on, diver[s]i only by the tedious exhortations of the monks, the agonizing feelings of [s]u[s]pen[s]e and apprehen . A fortnight was now pa[s]t, and they had not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] once [s]een Howard. They were attended with respectful a[s][s]iduity; they had but to name a wi[s]h, and it was in[s]tantly complied with. And only that they were not permitted to pa[s]s the boundaries of the garden wall, their [s]ituation might have been thought enviable. The charms of autumn were now beginning to fade, and winter was rapidly approaching, when one evening, after a chilly walk to the extremity of the avenue of ancient elms that fronted the hou[s]e, as I[s]abelle and her daughter were [s]itting down to their repa[s]t, experiencing [s]ome [s]mall degree of comfort, in the neatne[s]s of their apartment, and the cheerful blaze of a wood fire that glowed on the hearth, they were [s]tartled by a loud knocking at the gate, and in le[s]s than two minutes Howard [s]tood before them. Spite of the rea[s]ons they had for di[s]liking him, yet their long [s]eclu[s]ion from all [s]ociety, (except the persecuting zealots who daily vi[s]ited and tormented them) the many comforts they had through his means enjoyed, and the earne[s]t wi[s]h they had to inquire after the fate of Mina, gave to their countenances an air of plea[s]ure that was not altogether foreign to their hearts. Isabelle aro[s]e from her [s]eat as he entered; Columbia advanced two or three [s]teps towards him, and half extended her hand to welcome him. The[s]e tokens of joy at his appearance, thrilled to the enraptured heart of Howard. He eagerly [s]prang forward, caught the half-reluctant hand, and, dropping on one knee, imprinted on it a fervent ki[s]s. The action recalled their momentarily forgotten dignity; the features of I[s]abelle a[s][s]umed their u[s]ual [s]rigidity. Columbia blu[s]hed scarlet deep, and putting him from her with a rejecting motion, "Ri[s]e, Sir," [s]aid [s]he, "nor, by affected humility, in[s]ult your pri[s]oners." Howard now ha[s]tened to inform them, that, anxious only for their [s]afety, he had been a[s][s]iduous in his court to the queen, and, bribing the prie[s]ts to conceal the ill [s]ucce[s]s of their endeavours, he had per[s]uaded Mary that there was more than probable hopes of their conver[s]ion. "But I fear," continued he, "I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] [s]hall not long be able to elude her [s]u[s]picious vigilance. She this afternoon hinted [s]omething of recalling you to London, examining you her[s]elf, and accordingly as [s]he found you inclined, either receive you into the bo[s]om of the church, or give orders for your immediate execution." "Then our fate is inevitable," [s]aid I[s]abelle, with as much firmne[s]s as [s]he could a[s][s]ume. Columbia ca[s]t a look of unutterable tenderne[s]s at her mother, and, ga[s]ping to [s]uppre[s]s the angui[s]h of her heart, cried, "Yes, my mother, we will die together." "Not [s]o," [s]aid Howard, [s]truck with the magnanimity of the two charming women; "not [s]o. My employment at court, which places me almo[s]t immediately about the per[s]on of the queen, gives me an opportunity of knowing her de[s]igns almo[s]t as [s]oon as [s]he conceives them. I will attentively watch her; not a command [s]hall be i[s][s]ued forth of which I will not learn the motive and intent; and [s]hould I find her aim at the lives of my lovely, my e[s]teemed prisoners, I will deliver them from her power, or die in their defence." I[s]abelle ejaculated an expre[s][s]ion of gratitude, and Columbia, in tremulous accents, ventured to inquire after Mina. But Howard, with a look of [s]urpri[s]e, prote[s]ted his entire ignorance of her ab[s]ence in terms [s]o po[s]itive, that it appeared impo[s][s]ible any longer to doubt his veracity. The remainder of the evening was [s]pent in [s]ocial conver[s]e. He inquired if they had all the accommodations they wi[s]hed, and if their commands had been readily obeyed by their attendants? On taking leave, he reque[s]ted them to be con[s]tantly ready for a removal, as he [s]hould take care to give them early notice of impending danger, and provide them with hor[s]es and attendants to facilitate their e[s]cape. After this vi[s]it, their time was pa[s][s]ed in the u[s]ual way, till the morning of the [s]eventh of November; when, ju[s]t before day, Howard arrived, attended by a numerous retinue, and, hurrying I[s]abelle and Columbia from their beds, told them the moment [s]o long [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] dreaded was at hand, and nothing but immediate flight could [s]ave them. They aro[s]e with precipitation, and mounting the hor[s]es that [s]tood ready for them, proceeded, with all the expedition their [s]trength would permit, to the borders of the kingdom next the [s]ea on the coa[s]t of Suffolk, where, in a mutilated fortress, (a very [s]mall part of which was habitable) Howard reque[s]ted them to repo[s]e, till, as he [s]aid, a ve[s][s]el [s]hould arrive, the ma[s]ter of which had orders to meet them there, to convey them in [s]afety to Holland, Germany, or [s]ome place of [s]ecurity. Fatigued, di[s]pirited, and ill, I[s]abelle attended but little to the de[s]olate appearance of their habitation, or the few accommodations they were likely to meet with in this [s]olitary place. A numerous a[s][s]emblage of male dome[s]tics had attended them on their journey; but they [s]aw only one female throughout the whole dreary man[s]ion, and [s]he was almo[s]t in[s]en[s]ible through age and infirmity, being quite deaf and nearly blind. However, [s]he performed the mo[s]t menial offices, and I[s]abelle was too intent on the mi[s]eries of her [s]ituation, and the danger to which Columbia would be expo[s]ed, [s]hould they be di[s]covered and forced back to the court of Mary, to feel any of tho[s]e inconveniencies, which in her more pro[s]perous days would have appeared intolerable. All hope of a departure from England during the winter [s]ea[s]on [s]oon vani[s]hed; the weather became uncommonly tempe[s]tuous, the [s]now fell in great quantities, and the fro[s]t was inten[s]e. Howard was the con[s]tant inmate of their gloomy man[s]ion; for, under pretence that his life was in danger on account of his having aided their e[s]cape, he [s]ecluded him[s]elf with them, and declared his intention to accompany them, whenever the weather would permit them to depart. During the dreary months of December and January, he endeavoured, by amu[s]ing conver[s]ation, and a di[s]play of the various accompli[s]hments of which he was ma[s]ter, at once to divert the melancholy of the lady I[s]abelle, and awaken the attention of Columbia. But he pre[s]ently perceived his endeavours were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] inefeffectual; the de[s]pondency of the mother daily increased, till it almo[s]t bordered on de[s]pair, and every tender emotion of the daughter's heart was excited by hope, fear, and con[s]tant anxiety for the fate of the absent Sir Egbert Gorges. This di[s]covery once made, it became the bu[s]ine[s]s of Howard to undermine a pa[s][s]ion which militated [s]o powerfully again[s]t his [s]ucce[s]s. To this end, he frequently pretended to receive private news from London, and among[s]t other incidents, related one day, in a [s]eemingly carele[s]s manner, that a number of heretics had been executed, naming [s]everal, and at la[s]t Sir Egbert. Columbia was pre[s]ent; he eyed her attentively. She did not [s]hriek, [s]he did not faint; but the blood for[s]ook her lips and cheeks, her heart beat violently, [s]he rai[s]ed her [s]weet eyes mournfully to his face, and attempted to a[s]k a confirmation of the fatal tidings. But the words died upon her tongue; [s]he [s]truggled in vain to give them utterance; her voice was inarticulate. She cla[s]ped her hands, leaned her head on her mother's [s]houlder, and large tears rolled in [s]low and [s]ilent [s]ucce[s][s]ion down her cold cheeks. Such mute grief, [s]uch [s]igns of real angui[s]h, moved the heart of Howard. He attempted to comfort her; but I[s]abelle waved him from the apartment; when taking her daughter tenderly in her arms, [s]he [s]oothed, con[s]oled, and [s]ympathized with her, till her tears flowed more freely, and by degrees [s]he became compo[s]ed. Howard had always been open in his declaration of love for Columbia; it was therefore not [s]urpri[s]ing that he continued his [s]uit, or that, being thus con[s]tantly in her [s]ociety, he [s]hould plead his pa[s][s]ion with more than common fervour. She in general heard him in silence; but if pre[s][s]ed to an[s]wer, her reply was always that her heart was dead to affection. He applied to I[s]abelle; [s]he urged the difference of their religions, even was Columbia inclined to favour him. He promi[s]ed [s]he [s]hould never be di[s]turbed in the free exerci[s]e of her religious duties, according to what [s]he thought right; and I[s]abelle, worn out by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] con[s]tant anxiety, feeling her health daily decline, firmly believing Sir Egbert Gorges dead, and wi[s]hing to [s]ecure for her child a noble and powerful protector, at length [s]eemed inclined to li[s]ten to him, and to plead his cau[s]e with Columbia. The advice and rea[s]onings of her mother ever had due weight with this amiable girl; and though whenever her parent mentioned, that in all human probability, a few months would put a period to her existence, [s]he would mentally offer up a prayer, that her own life might terminate in the very [s]ame moment with that of her maternal friend. Yet as [s]he [s]aw her mother [s]ecretly wi[s]hed to [s]ee her united to Howard, [s]he endeavoured to di[s]po[s]e her mind for [s]uch a union, tacitly con[s]ented to li[s]ten to his [s]uit, and at the commencement of the en[s]uing [s]ummer, to give him her hand. With [s]low and tardy [s]teps winter receded; and [s]pring began to [s]how her [s]miling face, and wreath her mode[s]t brows with [s]now-drops, crocu[s]es, and primroses. All nature [s]eemed to wear a cheerful a[s]pect; but the heart of Columbia partook not of the hilarity the vernal [s]ea[s]on was ever wont to in[s]pire. If at any time [s]he [s]eemed to enjoy a gleam of [s]atisfaction, it was when [s]he was wandering through the woods, remarking the daily increa[s]e of the foliage, or [s]eated on a rock by the [s]ea-[s]hore, li[s]tening to the [s]ullen murmur of the waves, or watching them as they con[s]tantly [s]ucceeded each other, da[s]hing again[s]t the rude crags that hung frowning over their [s]ource. It was about the middle of May; the lady I[s]abelle had declined walking, though the evening was remarkably fine. Howard had been ab[s]ent from the Ca[s]tle two days; his ab[s]ence was a relief to the dejected [s]pirits of Columbia. She took her [s]olitary ramble through the wood. The fragrance of the evening air, the [s]erenity of the [s]ky, the melody of the feathered race who were chanting their ve[s]per [s]ong of thankfulne[s]s, awakened in her bo[s]om [s]omething like cheerfulne[s]s. She [s]trayed to her u[s]ual [s]eat by the [s]ea [s]ide, and indulged in the plea[s]urable [s]en[s]ations the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] surrounding pro[s]pect in[s]pired. Plea[s]ure had long been a [s]tranger to her heart, and [s]he welcomed her return, though in [s]o [s]light a degree, with an emanation of gratitude to the benignant Power, who had ordained that time [s]hould weaken and meliorate the [s]evere[s]t affliction. Entirely occupied by her own reflections, [s]he did not ob[s]erve any per[s]on near her till a young woman addre[s][s]ed her, and inquired the way to the Ca[s]tle. "I want to [s]ee our ma[s]ter," [s]aid [s]he, "for the young lady he put to live with mother be very [s]ick, and mother [s]ays [s]he do think [s]he will die." "I am going to the Ca[s]tle," [s]aid Columbia, ri[s]ing, "and will [s]hew you the way." "Where does your mother live?" continued [s]he; "and how does it happen, that as you call Sir James Howard your ma[s]ter, you do not know the way to his dwelling?" "Why dai[s]y me," replied the young woman, "nobody never lived in that there old place [s]ince I can remember, till ma[s]ter cum'd here la[s]t winter; and to be [s]ure, mother [s]aid, [s]eeing as how Sir James was a [s]ingle man, and wildi[s]h or [s]o, it was be[s]t for brother to go when the lady wanted to [s]end for him; but brother never went only into the kitching, and [s]o never knowed whether there was any ladies there; but mayhap you be cum'd here lately." "How far from the Ca[s]tle do you live, my dear?" [s]aid Columbia, planning in her mind a vi[s]it to the [s]ick lady. "About two miles," replied her companion, "down in a valley near the [s]ea; it be but a poor place, full of rocks, and nobody lives there but fi[s]hermen. But father was afear'd to [s]tay in town, cau[s]e as how queen Mary had ordered all the heretics to be burnt; and father and mother be both heretics, and [s]o we cum'd and lived here; and we had like to a gotten into trouble there. For Sir James be one of Mary's folks; but that's no matter now, [s]eeing that [s]he be dead, and I hope [s]he repented of all her cruelty before [s]he died." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] "Before who died?" [s]aid Columbia; "who are you talking about, my good girl?" "Why about queen Mary, madam." "Is queen Mary dead?" "Laws dai[s]y, yes; [s]he died la[s]t November; and then we [s]hould have gone home, only father was took [s]ick and died, an [s]o mother---" The girl might have run on for an hour. Columbia would not have interrupted her. Mary dead--- dead [s]o long, and Howard [s]till detaining her mother and [s]elf in that [s]olitary place, gave her an idea that his de[s]igns were not laudable or honourable; and then a ray of hope darted into her mind, that he had deceived her in reporting the death of Gorges. She quickened her [s]teps; [s]he longed to cheer her mother with this new-born hope. Be[s]ides, if Mary was dead, no doubt her [s]i[s]ter Elizabeth filled the throne. She a[s]ked the que[s]tion, and was an[s]wered in the affirmative. Her heart bounded at the tidings; [s]he [s]carcely touched the ground, [s]o light and [s]wiftly did [s]he pa[s]s over it. She left her young companion below with the old [s]ervant, and flying to her mother, imparted to her all [s]he had heard, all [s]he [s]u[s]pected, and all [s]he fondly hoped. Change of Scene, Weddings, Burials, and Chri[s]tenings. Isabelle joined her daughter in [s]everely censuring the conduct of Howard, by comparing the time of their departure from Ham[s]tead with that of the late queen's death. They found they were removed on the morning following the night [s]he died. "We are, I fear, in the power of a villain," [s]aid I[s]abelle, "but we mu[s]t exert our[s]elves to [s]hake off this bondage in which he, contrary to the laws of his country, detains us. I will [s]eek the protection of my [s]overeign, nor longer per[s]uade my child to give her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] hand oppo[s]ed again[s]t her heart. Howard is [s]till absent, nor do I think he will return to-night. We will leave his dreary pri[s]on, and, conducted by the young woman you mention, [s]eek an a[s]ylum among[s]t the poor fi[s]hermen; they may perhaps procure us a conveyance to [s]ome neighbouring town from whence we may get to London." "Alas! my dear mother," [s]aid Columbia, "you forget that we have no money." "I have a trifle, my child," [s]he replied, "and we mu[s]t [s]ummon all our fortitude to brave even hardship and danger without [s]hrinking. We are women, it is true, and ought never to forget the delicacy of our [s]ex; but real delicacy con[s]i[s]ts in purity of thought, and cha[s]tity of words and actions; not in [s]huddering at an accidental bla[s]t of wind, or increa[s]ing the unaviodable evils of life by affected weakne[s]s and timidity. How many of our [s]ex are obliged by hard and daily labour, to procure for them[s]elves and children the bare means of exi[s]tence! How many brave the [s]everities of the mo[s]t inclement [s]ea[s]ons, with hardly covering [s]ufficient to keep them from peri[s]hing! I allow that you and I, my beloved child, have been accu[s]tomed to tenderer u[s]age; but we are particularly called upon at this time, to exert the [s]trength and faculties of both mind and body, with which nature has bountifully endowed us." "Oh! my adored mother," [s]aid Columbia, "taught by your bright precept and example, I feel my[s]elf equal to almo[s]t any trial. But ill as you are, to undertake [s]o long, [s]o fatiguing a journey, without the means of procuring either comforts or conveniencies, if you [s]hould [s]ink under it, who then would advi[s]e, con[s]ole and direct your orphan Columbia?" "Courage, my love," replied I[s]abelle; "I am not [s]o ill as your tender anxiety leads you to think I am. Believe me, the agitation of the mind weakens and enervates the whole [s]y[s]tem. The heart, ea[s]ed of a load of angui[s]h, beats lighter, gives a freer play to the lungs, and a [s]wifter circulation to the blood. What is more conducive to health than change of air [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] and exerci[s]e? Be[s]ides, I have now [s]ome object in view, which will give con[s]tant employment to my thoughts. Employment naturally begets cheerfulness. Nothing is more pernicious to the health of mind or body, than indolence and inaction. The faculties become torpid; even the chords of [s]en[s]ibility lo[s]e their fine tone, and the heart it[s]elf grows cold and inanimate as marble. Keep the hands employed, and the mind occupied in [s]ome laudable pur[s]uit, and a [s]weet [s]erenity will diffu[s]e it[s]elf over the [s]oul. The day pa[s][s]es without our noticing the hours, the night brings peaceful and refre[s]hing [s]lumbers, and by throwing the golden chain of indu[s]try over the wings of plea[s]ure, we take the little [s]leeting phantom pri[s]oner, and make it our own forever." Columbia felt the full force of her mother's argument; for, being bu[s]ied in putting a few nece[s][s]aries together for their journey, [s]he was [s]o wholly occupied by the plea[s]ures of anticipation, that every ob[s]tacle [s]eemed to vani[s]h. "Heaven in its mercy guard and [s]upport my dear mother," [s]aid [s]he mentally, "and for my[s]elf I have no fears." The young woman, who[s]e name was Cicely, undertook to conduct them to the cottage of her mother. For the lady I[s]abelle [s]aid, as Sir James was not at home, [s]he would her[s]elf vi[s]it the [s]ick lady, and administer [s]uch con[s]olation as [s]he might find needful. The la[s]t tints of day were fading in the we[s]tern [s]ky, and the moon, in full maje[s]tic [s]plendour, tipped with her [s]ilver beams the lofty and antique trees that surrounded the man[s]ion of Howard, when the[s]e two intere[s]ting women, accompanied by Cicely, entered the wood through which they were obliged to pa[s]s in their way to her mother's habitation. In [s]ilence they pur[s]ued their way. Columbia and her mother could conver[s]e but on one [s]ubject, and on that one, prudence forbade them to [s]peak in the pre[s]ence of a third per[s]on; and Cicely, though [s]o communicative to the daughter, was awed by the pre[s]ence of the mother. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] At length they reached the cottage; it was [s]mall and meanly furni[s]hed, but withal [s]o clean and neat, that it [s]eemed the habitation of comfort and content. A middle aged woman, decently clad in home-[s]pun [s]tuff, met them at the door, and looking at the strangers with an air of [s]urpri[s]e, eagerly a[s]ked for Sir James. I[s]abelle did not give her little guide time to reply, but an[s]wered for her, that Sir James being from home, and [s]he being his particular friend and gue[s]t, had come to vi[s]it the [s]ick lady, and [s]ee if any thing could be done to help her. "Alack a day, my lady," [s]aid the woman, "I believe [s]he be pa[s]t help; I did not think [s]he would have lived till now; but walk into the next room, I believe [s]he is quite [s]en[s]ible yet, and [s]eems to have [s]omething heavy on her mind. I do think the poor [s]oul would die ea[s]ier, if [s]he could tell [s]omebody her troubles." As the loquacious landlady fini[s]hed [s]peaking, [s]he opened the door of the adjoining apartment, and Columbia, with trembling impatience, approached the bed, and [s]oftly put back the curtain. The light, which [s]tood on the table by the be[s]ide, [s]hed its rays full on the face of the invalid, and di[s]covered the features of Mina. A momentary [s]lumber had lulled her in forgetfulne[s]s. Be[s]ide her lay an infant, to all appearance but a few hours old. "My heart foreboded this," [s]aid I[s]abelle. Columbia's eyes [s]treamed as [s]he hung over the pale form of her beloved Mina; [s]he [s]obbed aloud, but was unable to [s]peak. The dying [s]ufferer unclo[s]ed her eyes, [s]he [s]aw, and in[s]tantly recollected her lady and dear benefactress. "Then my prayers are heard," [s]aid [s]he, faintly; "I [s]hall leave my child, the wretched offspring of [s]hame and folly, to the care of an angel." "Oh! my poor Mina," cried Columbia, [s]inking on her knees by the bed[s]ide, and endeavouring to [s]tifle her grief. "Unfortunate creature," [s]aid the lady Isabelle, taking the cold, damp hand of her [s]ervant; "[s]everely ha[s]t thou [s]uffered for thy deviation from the path of rectitude; but do not de[s]pond, my child. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] Your pre[s]ent weak [s]tate, and the depre[s][s]ion naturally attendant on your [s]ituation, makes you think your[s]elf near your end; but we will hope---" "Hope!" [s]aid Mina, rai[s]ing her languid eyes; "yes, I do hope that my [s]ufferings are nearly at an end, and that they have in part made atonement for my errors. I did not, believe me, I did not leave your protection voluntarily. I was forced away and brought to this place; I was taught to believe that you had left England. I have [s]ometimes, [s]ince my [s]eclu[s]ion here, [s]een the author of my ruin; but could not learn from him, that he knew aught concerning you. I was particularly anxious to [s]ee him to-night; for [s]ure I am, my dear lady, I [s]hall never again view the light of day. And I wi[s]hed to have with my own hands committed his child to his care; but I can with more confidence leave it to your protection." Here a [s]udden faintene[s]s, made her pau[s]e. A few drops admini[s]tered, [s]ome what revived her, and [s]he proceeded:---"A few [s]truggles more, and I [s]hall be at peace. My heart, my heart is broken. Yet tru[s]t me, it is not my own [s]ufferings, the [s]lights of the man for whom I [s]acrificed all, or the [s]corn of a contemning world under which I have [s]unk. No! it was the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of lo[s]t innocence; it was the reflection that my lap[s]e from virtue had involved my kinde[s]t, be[s]t friends in ruin, which penetrated deep into my [s]oul. Sleeping or waking, you were pre[s]ent to my thoughts, and I have died a thou[s]and deaths, in daily anticipating yours." The lady I[s]abelle endeavoured to [s]oothe and compose the affectionate, penitent Mina; a[s][s]ured her that what was in her power [s]he would cheerfully promi[s]e to perform; that [s]he would look on her child as an infant given to her protection by the immediate agency of Heaven; and though [s]he [s]hould think it a duty to endeavour to awaken in the brea[s]t of Howard the feelings of a father towards the helple[s]s innocent, yet it would be her care to [s]ee that his health and morals were in no ways neglected. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] "Yes, my dear Mina," [s]aid Columbia, "he [s]hall be my charge. Come, compo[s]e your[s]elf; endeavour to re[s]t. When you are better, we will nur[s]e the little rogue together, and I warrant I [s]hall prove the better nur[s]e." "Ble[s][s]ed---ble[s][s]ed---" [s]aid Mina, gra[s]ping the hand of Columbia (which from her fir[s]t awaking, [s]he had held in her's). Her eyes were ardently turned upward; they gradually clo[s]ed; her fingers relaxed their hold, and her head [s]unk upon the pillow. "She is dropped a[s]leep," [s]aid Columbia, "I hope it will refre[s]h her." "It will," replied her mother, drawing her from the bed-[s]ide; [s]he will awake relieved from all her pain." "Do you think [s]o indeed! my dear mother." "Yes, my child, mo[s]t a[s][s]uredly; for in this world [s]he will awake no more." The feelings of [s]uch a heart as Columbia's, on [s]uch an occa[s]ion, cannot be de[s]cribed. The [s]oul alive to [s]en[s]ibility, can ea[s]ily conceive them; and to the unfeeling, a repetition of her complaints and [s]orrows would be tedious and unintere[s]ting. She took the poor motherle[s]s infant in her arms, and [s]itting down in one corner of the room, baptized it with her tears. The [s]cene became too painful for the lady I[s]abelle; and whil[s]t the landlady and her daughter, a[s][s]i[s]ted by a [s]ervant, prepared the body of the departed Mina for her la[s]t re[s]ting place, [s]he walked in a little garden before the door, [s]eeking, from the cool evening air, a relief from that oppre[s][s]ion on the heart, which the recent [s]cene had occa[s]ioned. The air in a [s]light degree had the de[s]ired effect. She returned to the hou[s]e, and approached the door that led to the apartment of death. The lifele[s]s body was now [s]tretched upon the bed, on the [s]ide of which [s]at Columbia [s]till weeping, and cla[s]ping the infant to her be[s]om. Her [s]orrow was too [s]acred, the le[s][s]on was too important, for her mother to interrupt her. The [s]ound of foot[s]teps called the attention of I[s]abelle from her daughter. She turned to [s]ee from whence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] the [s]ound proceeded, and beheld ju[s]t entering the hou[s]e, Howard. "The lady I[s]abelle," [s]aid he, with a look of astonishment, "by what miracle do I [s]ee you here? and where is my charming Columbia?" "She is here al[s]o," replied I[s]abelle, with a [s]olemn voice. "Follow me; I will lead you to her." They entered the apartment together. Columbia rai[s]ed not her eyes. The heart of Howard beat quick, as, leading him toward the bed, I[s]abelle drew the covering from the death-[s]tamped face of Mina, and pointing to her, [s]aid emphatically, "Behold the works of thy hands, Howard! Here contemplate the fruits of [s]eduction!" At the name of Howard, Columbia [s]tarted; [s]he read the emotions of his [s]oul in his expre[s][s]ive countenance. Ri[s]ing from her [s]eat, [s]he pre[s]ented the infant to him, and laying her right hand on his arm, called his attention from the pale cor[s]e of her lamented servant. "Gaze not there, Howard," [s]aid [s]he; "the injuries of the mother are pa[s]t redre[s]s; but behold your child, make reparation here!" Howard, the gay, the thoughtle[s]s, di[s][s]ipated Howard was [s]truck to the heart. He [s]aw the once lovely, blooming, cheerful Mina, an inanimate ma[s]s. Tho[s]e [s]parkling eyes, that fir[s]t awakened the licentious passion, were clo[s]ed in death; that heart, that had but too much [s]en[s]ibility, too much [s]incerity for its own peace, was cold and [s]till. His [s]eductive powers had hurried an amiable creature out of the world, and introduced into it a helple[s]s being, who, [s]hould he live, through life would blu[s]h for the frailty of his mother, and execrate the licentiou[s]ne[s]s of his father. He took the infant from the arms of Columbia, pre[s][s]ed the hand which [s]he had laid on his arm, attempted to [s]peak, but his voice died away in inarticulate [s]ounds. The bitter tears of [s]elf-accu[s]ation ru[s]hed down his cheeks; he returned the child to her; and throwing him[s]elf be[s]ide the lifele[s]s Mina, gave a loo[s]e to the anguish of his heart. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] I[s]abelle led her daughter from the room; but during the whole night Howard never left it for a moment, and [s]mall was the protion of repo[s]e which any of the inhabitants of the cottage ta[s]ted. By the dawn of day, I[s]abelle wi[s]hed to begin her journey towards London. She [s]ent in a reque[s]t to Howard, that he would grant her a few moments audience. He complied. When he entered the apartment, [s]he thus addre[s][s]ed him. "I [s]ent for you not, Sir James, to irritate your [s]en[s]ibility by un[s]ea[s]onable reproaches, nor to inquire what injury I had ever done you, that you have thus wantonly heaped mi[s]ery on me and mine. I wi[s]h but to tell you, that I am fully [s]en[s]ible how unju[s]tly and on what fal[s]e pretences you have detained me here; and that, knowing myself perfectly free, and [s]afe in the protection of my queen, and the laws of my country, I may travel without mole[s]tation whither[s]oever I plea[s]e. I [s]hall immediately proceed towards London. I al[s]o wi[s]h to inform you, that the poor departed victim, in her dying moments, recommended her infant to my care, and died in the full confidence of my protection and tenderne[s]s being extended towards it during its years of helple[s]s infancy. I am [s]en[s]ible of your prior right; the right of nature is incontrovertible; and I have [s]till [s]o good an opinion of your heart (when left to the dictates of rea[s]on and religion) as to think you will di[s]charge the duty of a parent with con[s]cientious [s]trictne[s]s. But I have to reque[s]t, you will [s]uffer me to be informed where the child may be placed, that in ca[s]e of indi[s]po[s]ition, I may have it in my power to vi[s]it and [s]ee that he is properly nur[s]ed and attended." Howard was for a moment [s]ilent. His proud [s]pirit was humbled to the du[s]t. But Howard, when convinced of an error, knew how to make atonement without de[s]cending from the dignity of man. "Noble lady," [s]aid he, "I have been highly culpable. My heart tells me at this moment, I have forfeited all right to the protecting power of an Omnipotent, by abu[s]ing his good gifts, and deba[s]ing the noblest work of his hands. But I am not [s]o far lo[s]t to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] virtue, as to per[s]i[s]t in error again[s]t the conviction of rea[s]on. I have injured you, lady Arundel, I have wounded the heart of your lovely daughter, by a fal[s]e tale of the death of her lover; but, thank Heaven, reparation here is not beyond my power. My [s]ervants [s]hall attend you; my hor[s]es are at your command; depart when you plea[s]e. You [s]hall have [s]afe conduct to the court of the royal Elizabeth, where you will meet Sir Egbert Gorges, rich in every virtue as well as in the favour of his [s]overeign. Your reque[s]t in regard to the haple[s]s offspring of indi[s]cretion, [s]hall gladly be complied with; his infant wants I will take care [s]hall be amply [s]upplied; I will endeavour, by tenderness toward him, to atone for the injuries I have done his mother. But your friend[s]hip and attention, in directing my cares to a proper channel, will be a valuable acqui[s]ition to him, and an act of conde[s]cen[s]ion toward me. I will [s]ee the lo[s]t Mina repo[s]e on her la[s]t bed, and then conduct my child and his nur[s]e to London, where, making ample provi[s]ion for his [s]upport through life, I will leave him to your protection, and [s]eek, in the cla[s]h of arms and the pur[s]uit of glory, to lo[s]e the remembrance of circum[s]tances which tend at once to my di[s]honour and di[s]quiet." Early in the day, I[s]abelle and her daughter commenced their journey toward the metropolis. Though the [s]pirits of Columbia had received a [s]evere [s]hock from the death of her favourite Mina, yet the bright pro[s]pects that opened to her, in her recovered liberty and the certainty of Sir Egbert's life and [s]afety, contributed in a great degree to di[s][s]ipate her melancholy; and as they drew near the conclu[s]ion of their journey, her heart vibrated with the mo[s]t plea[s]urable [s]en[s]ations. A [s]udden thunder [s]hower, which obliged them to [s]top when within a few hours ride of London, impeded their journey, and they were nece[s][s]itated unwillingly to [s]leep another night on the road. After an early repa[s]t, they retired to their apartment, when ju[s]t as Columbia was going into bed, [s]he mi[s][s]ed her ring from off her finger. "Oh! madam," [s]aid [s]he, "I have lo[s]t my ring; and yet I am [s]ure I [s]aw it on my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] finger ju[s]t before we went to [s]upper." Every part of the bed-chamber was now [s]earched, every article of her attire carefully [s]haken, her pockets turned in[s]ide out, but all in vain. "Perhaps," [s]aid I[s]abelle, "you may have dropped it in the room below." The ho[s]te[s]s was [s]ummoned, and reque[s]ted to look for it, whil[s]t Columbia, too anxious to think of re[s]ting, had (almo[s]t unknown to her[s]elf) again put on her clothes. The ho[s]te[s]s returned. "I have been very fortunate," [s]aid [s]he; "a gentleman who has been [s]eeking game in the neighbouring fore[s]t, being overtaken by night [s]ooner than he expected, entered the hou[s]e ju[s]t as you came up [s]tairs, and being [s]hewn into the apartment you had left, has found the ring, and here it is." Columbia eagerly extended her hand to receive it; but overcome with joy and a[s]toni[s]hment, [s]he gave a [s]udden exclamation of plea[s]ure, and [s]pringing toward the door, was in[s]tantly folded in the arms of Sir Egbert Gorges. It was he, who with Rawlins had been in pur[s]uit of game in the adjacent woods. Entering the apartment Columbia had ju[s]t left, he [s]aw [s]omething glitter on the floor, and [s]tooping, picked up the identical ring which he had placed on her finger at parting. His [s]urpri[s]e was exce[s][s]ive; he had heard that the lady I[s]abelle and her daughter had been in the power of Mary, and it was univer[s]ally believed they had, through Howard's means, e[s]caped; that they were at that moment under the [s]ame roof with him, he had not the mo[s]t di[s]tant idea; but the per[s]on who dropped the ring might probably give him [s]ome information concerning her. He was gazing at it, lo[s]t in conjecture, his bo[s]om throbbing with anxiety to learn her fate, when the ho[s]te[s]s entered the room. "I beg pardon," [s]aid [s]he, "but I come to look for a ring which a lady thinks [s]he has dropped here; I hope if you have [s]een it, gentlemen, you will re[s]tore it; for indeed the poor young lady [s]eems in a [s]ad taking about it." "A young lady?" [s]aid Sir Egbert. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] "Aye, a young lady," replied our loquacious hostess; "and as [s]weet a young lady as eye ever looked on. I warrant it is [s]ome love token. Oh! if you had but [s]een her earne[s]tne[s]s, when [s]he entreated me to come and look for it." "I have found the ring," [s]aid Sir Egbert, his heart throbbing [s]o violently as to render re[s]piration difficult; "here, take it to the young lady, and as you give it her, [s]uffer me to [s]ee her; leave the door partly open as you go in." A golden argument, with which Sir Egbert enforced his reque[s]t, prevented objections, and taking the plain gold ring from his own finger, he [s]ent it to Columbia. It may ea[s]ily be [s]uppo[s]ed, that [s]o happy, [s]o unexpected a meeting, bani[s]hed [s]leep effectually from the eyes of all. I[s]abelle and her daughter returned to the parlour, where inquiry, recital, and unre[s]erved confidence on both [s]ides, occupied the remainder of the night. They learnt that young Dudley was [s]afe in the protection of Elizabeth, who had re[s]tored to him the title and e[s]tates of his father, and promi[s]ed to be his friend and patrone[s]s. Nor was Mina forgot; Rawlins [s]eized the fir[s]t pau[s]e in their intere[s]ting conver[s]ation to inquire after the object of his [s]incere affection. I[s]abelle he[s]itated; [s]he read his tenderne[s]s in the emotions of his countenance. At length the fatal truth was di[s]clo[s]ed, and the piece of [s]ilver which Columbia had taken from around her neck after her decease, was re[s]tored to him. He took it; he gazed on it in [s]ilence. His manly features were tinged with the pale hue of death. He rai[s]ed his eyes to the face of Columbia. The look was expre[s][s]ive; it [s]eemed to [s]ay, "You loved her lady; do you not lament her?" Columbia breathed a [s]igh of commi[s]eration. His heart[s]trings, which were drawn almo[s]t to breaking, were [s]oftened by its balmy influence. He pa[s][s]ed his hand acro[s]s his eyes to di[s][s]ipate the tear, the mournful cata[s]trophe of his beloved Mina had extorted, and putting the piece of [s]ilver into his bo[s]om, ha[s]tily left the apartment. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] The ruddy morn peeped through the ea[s]tern gates, before this happy trio thought of [s]eparating. I[s]abelle and Columbia at length retired to their chamber; but Morpheus was flown beyond recall. Unfeeling deity! he makes his longe[s]t vi[s]its to the ignorant and insensible. The pea[s]ant, whil[s]t he labours among[s]t the corn he [s]ows, [s]trews the [s]omnific poppy; and in return, the leaden-winged power collects its [s]weets, and [s]heds them on his pillow. From the couch bedewed with tears he takes his flight, and when ec[s]tatic joy has [s]trung each nerve, and the exhilarated [s]pirits mount toward heaven, he [s]tands aloof and [s]hakes his heavy wings, nor for one moment will impede the tide of bli[s]s, though courted earne[s]tly by weary nature, who languishes for re[s]t from each extreme, whether of grief or plea[s]ure. Pre[s]ented at the court of Elizabeth, Columbia [s]hone con[s]picuous. Her beauty [s]truck the admiring eye; her affability, good [s]en[s]e and virtue captivated the heart. Her delighted, happy mother be[s]towed her hand on Sir Egbert Gorges with unfeigned satisfaction; and remaining in the capital till Columbia was mother to a [s]on chri[s]tened Ferdinando, and a daughter named Elizabeth, [s]he retired to Au[s]tenbury Ca[s]tle. Her old [s]ervant Cora was no more. Matthias was in his [s]econd childhood; but he experienced all the plea[s]ure of which human nature in its la[s]t [s]tage is capable, in the return of his revered lady. The autumn following, he [s]lept in peace; and before the en[s]uing [s]pring had called forth the primro[s]e, or decked the almond tree in blu[s]hing [s]weets, the lady I[s]abelle, the de[s]cendant of the great Columbus, the daughter of the Peruvian prince[s]s Orrabella , gently declined into the vale of years, and re[s]ted in the hou[s]e appointed for all living. Columbia on this occa[s]ion vi[s]ited the [s]cene of her juvenile plea[s]ures. Her feelings on the departure of her mother were inde[s]cribable. Her tears again consecrated the memory of the unfortunate Mina; and having given orders that the court yard, the filbert walk, the tower and ea[s]tern wing of the Ca[s]tle [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] be kept in con[s]tant repair, [s]he returned to London, where [s]he continued for many years to [s]hine eminently in the characters of wife, mother, and mi[s]tre[s]s of a family. She died in the fiftieth year of her age, after having given birth to five children; Ferdinando, heir to his father's title and e[s]tate; Elizabeth, who was married to lord Henry Dudley; Jane, who died in her infancy; Edward, who, embracing the [s]ervice of his country in a nautical profe[s][s]ion, and in the year 1585 embarking with the brave and enterprizing Sir Francis Drake, peri[s]hed in the attack again[s]t St. Domingo; and Beatina, who married into the ancient and respectable family of the Penns. Sir Egbert Gorges him[s]elf lived to a good old age; and dying, bequeathed his title and e[s]tates to a [s]on, who thought hereditary honour of little value to the po[s][s]e[s][s]or unle[s]s [s]upported by humanity, ju[s]tice and mercy. Sir Ferdinando Gorges regarded the honour of ancestry in no other light than as a [s]timulus to praiseworthy actions. "My father," [s]aid he, "was beloved and e[s]teemed for his virtue, honour and integrity; I will not fully the name I bear, by any action derogatory to the character of a MAN and a CHRISTIAN." Sir Ferdinando Gorges was a gentleman of the old world; [s]hould the character appear unnatural to any of the pre[s]ent time, let them remember that they are reading a "tale of old times," and exculpate the author from the charge of romance and improbability. A certain modern author, a noble author too, (if inheriting a title con[s]titutes nobility) has been at infinite trouble to explain the requi[s]ites nece[s][s]ary to form the character of a fine gentleman; unfortunately, he forgot humanity, truth and religion. Sir Ferdinando Gorges imagined, that to love and wor[s]hip his Creator, to [s]corn to a[s][s]ert a fal[s]ehood, and to do as he would be done by in the mo[s]t minute particular, was to de[s]erve the di[s]tingui[s]hed rank he inherited from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] his ance[s]tors; and it is a moral certainty, that Sir Ferdinando was perfectly right in his ideas of the character of a real gentleman. A Century when pa[s]t is but as a Moment. Sir Ferdinando Gorges took but a [s]mall [s]hare in the active [s]cenes of life, till the unfortunate Earl of E[s][s]ex, favourite to Elizabeth, incurred the cen[s]ure of his [s]overeign by neglecting her commands, and hurried by the impetuo[s]ity of his pa[s][s]ion, in[s]tigated the populace (ever eager for novelty) to arm in his support and defence, which called forth the aid of the loyal [s]ubject in behalf of the queen's di[s]puted power. It was then Sir Ferdinando [s]tarted into notice; he a[s][s]erted the prerogative of royalty, and enforced the commands of his [s]overeign, not as the will of a de[s]potic tyrant, but as the laws of a well-regulated government, nece[s][s]ary to be [s]upported, for the peace, intere[s]t and [s]ecurity of millions who lived under their protection. He was a man remarkable for public [s]pirit; it was the main [s]pring that actuated all his pur[s]uits. Every wi[s]h of his heart, every undertaking in which he engaged, was de[s]igned to promote the general welfare. About the year 1624, a number of per[s]ons having formed them[s]elves into a company for planting and [s]ettling a colony in New England, North-America, Sir Ferdinando was appointed by royal authority one of the directors, and expended great part of his paternal inheritance in promoting the de[s]ign. The [s]pirit of his great and enterpri[s]ing ance[s]tor [s]eemed to revive in him, and nothing but his advanced age prevented him from cro[s][s]ing the Atlantic him[s]elf, in [s]earch of di[s]coveries that might enrich or enlighten the ri[s]ing generation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] Sir Ferdinando had married, at an early age, a lady of family and fortune; but [s]he lived only to give birth to a daughter; and Sir Ferdinando was [s]o firmly attached to her whil[s]t living, and [s]o [s]incerely regretted her untimely departure, that he thought no other woman could [s]upply her place. His [s]i[s]ter Elizabeth was nearly at the [s]ame period left a widow, with only one child, a boy about five years old. To whom could Sir Ferdinando apply to take the charge of his infant daughter, [s]o well as to lady Dudley? And where could the young, the lovely widow find her[s]elf [s]o [s]afe, [s]o [s]ecure from reproach, as in the family and under the protection of her brother? As the children grew up, Henry regarded his little cou[s]in I[s]abelle with more than fraternal affection; but the tenets of the reformed religion forbidding a union between two per[s]ons [s]o nearly related by the ties of blood, neither Sir Ferdinando nor lady Dudley encouraged an affection, which in their ideas was a crime; and with a de[s]ign to prevent its progre[s]s, at the age of nineteen, Henry was [s]ent to travel, and fini[s]h his education by gaining a competent knowledge of foreign courts and manners. Though I[s]abelle Gorges, at the departure of her cou[s]in for the continent, was [s]carcely fourteen years old, yet Henry was fully [s]en[s]ible of the nature of the emotions he felt in her favour; whil[s]t [s]he, the pure child of [s]implicity, had no idea but that [s]he might love him beyond all other terre[s]trial beings, and confess it with impunity. She hung upon his neck at taking leave, be[s]ought him not to forget her, and [s]pent the whole day in tears. Every en[s]uing day [s]eemed [s]till to make his ab[s]ence more intolerable. She thought of him ince[s][s]antly, [s]poke of him often, and when a letter arrived, would hang over her father's [s]houlder with delighted attention whil[s]t he read the contents. Henry Dudley was a man exactly calculated to do honour to the noble race from whence he [s]prang; the letters of his governor to his mother were filled with his prai[s]es. To a brave, undaunted [s]pirit he united a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] [s]oul alive to all the finer feelings of humanity. With an ardent thir[s]t for knowledge, he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed an understanding that directed his [s]tudies and re[s]earches to the mo[s]t u[s]eful, laudable objects; from the gentlene[s]s of his nature liable to error, but open to conviction, and ever ready to make atonement. "He has but one fault," [s]aid his governor in one of his letters, "and that is an impetuo[s]ity of di[s]po[s]ition when in pur[s]uit of any favourite object; his affections are ardent in the extreme, and his pa[s][s]ions, or rather his exce[s][s]ive [s]en[s]ibility, hurry him often beyond the bounds of rea[s]on and di[s]cretion. But this error is like a [s]pot on the [s]un, which may be di[s]cernible whil[s]t his beams are weakened by the mi[s]ts of the morning, but when he [s]hines in full meridian [s]plendour will become imperceptible." "Dear, beloved Henry!" exclaimed I[s]abelle, as [s]he li[s]tened to her aunt whil[s]t [s]he read the pa[s][s]age. "Oh! why is he not my brother? I am [s]ure though, if he were my brother, I could not love him better than I do now; and you, my charming aunt," [s]he continued, throwing her arms round the neck of lady Dudley, "I think I could not love you more than I do now, but yet I [s]hould like to call you mother. I never knew my own mother; you have amply [s]upplied her place. Let me call you mother, dear! dear! mother. Oh! there is [s]omething [s]o delightful in the word, that my heart overflows with tender tran[s]ports as I utter it. What a happy girl I [s]hould be if I could [s]ay, My father, my mother, and my brother Henry." The lady Dudley perceived that the innocence of I[s]abelle was equal to her tenderne[s]s, and that in wishing to call her mother, [s]he meant no more, than that by her being [s]o, Henry would become her brother. Henry continued his travels till he had reached his twenty-third year; it was then thought nece[s][s]ary to call him home; and as in his letters he had never mentioned I[s]abelle only as a relation, Sir Ferdinando hoped ab[s]ence, and a variety of [s]cenes, had totally eradicated the youthful predilection he had conceived [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] in her favour. But in this he was mi[s]taken; the passion which began in childhood had increa[s]ed with his years; and though during his travels various other pur[s]uits had contributed to keep it dormant, it [s]till remained in his heart, and waited only for a re-union with I[s]abelle, to blaze anew with more than its former ardency. During his re[s]idence at the court of France, Henry Dudley formed an acquaintance with Howard Fitz-Howard, grand[s]on to the unfortunate Mina. Sir James Howard had con[s]cientiou[s]ly performed his promi[s]e, in providing [s]plendidly for the education of his [s]on, whom he had chri[s]tened James Fitz-Howard; but as he left him in charge with an eccle[s]ia[s]tic of the Romi[s]h religion, in order to his being brought up in that faith, the lady Arundel could do no more than [s]ometimes vi[s]it him during his infancy. His father died abroad before he was fifteen. Leaving him a very large [s]hare of his e[s]tates, [s]oon after this event his governor removed him to Paris; and from that period, the family of Sir Egbert Gorges were totally unacquainted with his welfare or pur[s]uits. The prie[s]t to who[s]e care he had been entru[s]ted, was a man of [s]trict probity; he paid the utmo[s]t attention to his education, and, uniting the friend and companion with the in[s]tructor, made him love virtue for its own [s]ake; for, beholding its effects in the conversation and manners of his re[s]pected tutor, he grew emulous to copy what appeared [s]o amiable. His father had been well-known to [s]ome of the mo[s]t noble families in France, and Fitz-Howard, at an early age, found him[s]elf in a very elevated circle, care[s][s]ed and e[s]teemed by all. He married the daughter of a rich farmer-general, and Howard Fitz-Howard was the only [s]urviving fruit of the union. This young man was a character compo[s]ed of contrarieties, at once ver[s]atile as the wind, and boi[s]terous as the waves. With [s]carcely a trait of his father's virtues, he inherited the vices of his grandfather, with all that imbecility of mind, that heedle[s]s credulity, which had been the cau[s]e of the ruin of his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] grandmother. Eager in the pur[s]uit of plea[s]ure, a passiomate admirer of female beauty, and ma[s]ter of an affluent fortune, uncontrolled by any, he lavi[s]hed it with a pro[s]u[s]e hand on tho[s]e who flattered his follies, carele[s]s whether they were de[s]erving favour or contempt. It may be thought [s]trange, that a young man like Henry Dudley could form an intimacy with [s]uch a character. But youth is ever un[s]u[s]pecting, and the generous nature of Dudley could not imagine the gaiety and vivacity of Fitz-Howard was almo[s]t the only recommendation he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. At the time Henry was recalled home, Fitz-Howard expre[s][s]ed a wi[s]h to accompany him to England. Madame Fitz-Howard had never, from his infancy, ventured to contradict any wi[s]h of her darling; and, unwilling as [s]he was to part with him, [s]he at length con[s]ented to his going, on condition that the vi[s]it was limited to [s]ix months. Accordingly the two friends, attended by their re[s]pective governors, arrived in England about the middle of November, and with all the [s]peed the mode of travelling then in u[s]e would allow, proceeded immediately to London. The la[s]t rays of daylight glimmered in the we[s]t as they cro[s][s]ed the Thames, and before they reached the man[s]ion of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the family were quietly [s]ettled to the employments of the evening. Sir Ferdinando was reading to his wife and daughter, who were employed in embroidering a dre[s]s, in which I[s]abelle was to be pre[s]ented at the court of James the Fir[s]t, who now filled the throne of the deceased Elizabeth; uniting, by his acce[s][s]ion to the Briti[s]h crown, the two kingdoms of England and Scotland in one. (This monarch was [s]on to the unfortunate Mary, queen of Scots, who was beheaded at Fotheringay Ca[s]tle during the reign of Elizabeth, after having been detained a pri[s]oner there upwards of fifteen years.) I[s]abelle Gorges was now eighteen. Her features were regular, but not at fir[s]t view [s]trikingly hand[s]ome. The radiance of her mild blue eyes did not dart at once upon the heart, taking the a[s]toni[s]hed [s]en[s]es [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] captive; but through the [s]oftening [s]hade of long, dark, [s]ilken la[s]hes, [s]tole imperceptibly on the [s]oul, and made it all her own. Her [s]tature was above the middle [s]ize, yet not [s]o tall as to render her per[s]on ma[s]culine. Her limbs were round, and [s]inely proportioned. A cha[s]te dignity, tempered by the mo[s]t winning [s]oftne[s]s, informed her manners, and rendered her irre[s]i[s]tibly charming. It mu[s]t be remembered, that Dudley had not [s]een her for above four years. Imagine, then, what mu[s]t be his feelings, when he [s]aw the lively, affectionate girl, transformed into the elegant, dignified woman! I[s]abelle had been hourly expecting her cou[s]in, and was too much occupied in anticipating the plea[s]ures of their meeting, to be very attentive to her father's reading; nay, even the work in which [s]he was engaged, though it continued to employ her fingers, did not for a moment occupy her thoughts. Every noi[s]e in the court yard, every quick [s]tep a[s]cending the [s]tairs, made her heart beat quick, and her eyes would glance eagerly toward the door. A confu[s]ed murmur in the great hall had made Sir Ferdinando pau[s]e. "He is come," [s]aid I[s]abelle, dropping her work and [s]tarting from her feat. The door opened, and Dudley was in a moment at the feet of his mother. Relea[s]ed from the maternal embrace, he turned toward his lovely cou[s]in, and received a welcome, which filled the brea[s]t of Fitz-Howard with envy. Recovered from the momentary delirium that ever pervades the too [s]en[s]ible [s]y[s]tem upon a re-union with beloved friends, Dudley pre[s]ented his new friend, who was received with cordiality, and immediately invited to take an apartment in the hou[s]e of Sir Ferdinando, during his re[s]idence in London. A very few days [s]erved to convince the father of I[s]abelle, that the ab[s]ence Henry had been obliged to [s]ubmit to, from his cou[s]in, had acted in the [s]ame manner as a [s]mall quantity of water does when thrown on a fierce fire, gave a momentary damp to its progress, only that it might bur[s]t forth with double [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] violence, de[s]troying every object that attempted to oppo[s]e its fury. I[s]abelle, mode[s]t, timid, and tremblingly alive to feel the [s]malle[s]t infringement on the delicacy of her fex, was yet [s]u[s]ceptible of a pure, ardent pa[s][s]ion for her cou[s]in. Fitz-Howard, an immate in their family, read the workings in the minds of all; for each [s]trove to hide from the other their real [s]entiments. The lady Dudley, and her brother Sir Ferdinando, [s]aw with concern the pa[s][s]ion which con[s]umed their children; but they endeavoured to conceal that knowledge even from each other, [s]till labouring, by various [s]chemes, to divert the attention of I[s]abelle and Henry different ways. Henry, when conver[s]ing with Fitz-Howard, would [s]peak with rapturous eloquence in prai[s]e of his cou[s]in; but if his friend at any time accu[s]ed him of being too partial, he would [s]ay, "Is it not natural for brothers to be partial to their [s]i[s]ters?" "Surely," replied Fitz Howard, "but do you love I[s]abelle Gorges no more than you would love a [s]i[s]ter?" "No more, on my honour," Dudley would reply, and immediately change the conver[s]ation. Lady Dudley, thinking to [s]athom the [s]entiments of I[s]abelle in regard to her [s]on, would [s]peak of him in her pre[s]ence. At the [s]malle[s]t encomium be[s]towed on Henry by his mother, the eyes of I[s]abelle would beam with plea[s]ure; a brighter glow would ornament her cheeks; and her coral lips, half unclo[s]ed by the [s]mile of innate [s]atisfaction, di[s]playing her pearly teeth, would give that cha[s]te animation to her whole countenance, as rendered it [s]carcely a degree below angelic. When on the contrary, [s]hould [s]he hear a [s]yllable of di[s]approbation e[s]cape her aunt, her lips would tremble, her cheek lo[s]e its carnation hue; and her eyes half filled with tears, her brow contracted by the oppression of her heart, would [s]eem to [s]ay, "Do not [s]peak har[s]hly of him, I am certain he does not de[s]erve it." And when lady Dudley has remarked that Henry was an uncommon favourite, [s]he would reply, "Certainly he is, and can you blame me? Is he not your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] [s]on? Surely I may love him for your [s]ake, and you will not contemn me." Thus every per[s]on that compo[s]ed the family of Sir Ferdinando, endeavoured to conceal their real feelings; but Fitz-Howard read them all. From his fir[s]t introduction, he had felt his heart [s]trongly drawn toward I[s]abelle. At fir[s]t, he imagined an in[s]uperable objection would ari[s]e from the pa[s][s]ion of Dudley; but when from various circum[s]tances he learnt that the parents of neither party approved that pa[s][s]ion, he conceived the idea of ingratiating him[s]elf with lady Dudley, and leading her, by imperceptible degrees, to approve his own preten[s]ions. He fore[s]aw that the difference of religion would prove an almo[s]t insurmountable ob[s]tacle; but Fitz-Howard had not been educated in a manner, that would lead him to think either religion or morality was of any very great consequence, when oppo[s]ed again[s]t his own inclinations. In order to accompli[s]h this de[s]ired end, he in turn made him[s]elf the friend and confidant of all. He listened attentively to Sir Ferdinando's account of new di[s]coveries, and approved all the plans he had formed for the extending of the ble[s][s]ings of navigation and commerce over the whole habitable globe. With Dudley, he joined in extolling the beauty, virtue and accompli[s]hments of I[s]abelle, and without pretending to perceive the extent of his attachment, encouraged the affection he [s]eemed to di[s]approve. To the lady I[s]abelle he was another character; talked of the different opinions that were adopted by the people of England in regard to religious matters; mentioned his own faith, not as oppo[s]ing it to the faith of the pious, enthu[s]ia[s]tic lady Elizabeth; but appearing to wi[s]h in[s]truction in the right way, as desiring to have his own errors corrected. Nor was this conduct entirely the re[s]ult of art; it was chiefly the effect of nature. For Fitz-Howard could never maintain his own opinion again[s]t [s]trong argument. Indeed, he could hardly be [s]aid to have an opinion of his own; and had he conver[s]ed four [s]ucce[s][s]ive days with per[s]ons of four different religions, he would, at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] the end of that period, have been per[s]uaded that he with whom he conver[s]ed la[s]t, was certainly mo[s]t right. Thus ver[s]atile by nature, it cannot be wondered at, that, finding this ver[s]atility likely to forward his mo[s]t favourite views, he took no pains to correct it, but gave free indulgence to a di[s]po[s]ition, which, whil[s]t it rendered him agreeable to every [s]eparate branch of the family, promi[s]ed him ample gratification in the favour of the aunt of I[s]abelle. To I[s]abelle her[s]elf he was tender, a[s][s]iduous; in [s]hort, all that love could in[s]pire, or friend[s]hip wi[s]h. She rode, [s]he walked, [s]he danced and chatted with Fitz-Howard without re[s]traint; though at the [s]ame time [s]he would have preferred the company of Dudley. But if his company gave her mo[s]t plea[s]ure, it was a plea[s]ure [s]o mixed with anxiety, [s]uch fear of offending, [s]uch trembling apprehen[s]ion and embarrassment, that it became no longer de[s]irable, and [s]he evidently avoided giving him any opportunities of entertaining her, except in the pre[s]ence of her father and lady Dudley. Fitz-Howard po[s][s]e[s][s]ed but little penetration, but a very competent [s]hare of vanity [s]upplied its place. He imagined that the apparent preference I[s]abelle [s]hewed him, was the effect of real liking, and that [s]he was captivated by his per[s]on, manners and fortune. Buoyed up by the[s]e ideas, he made propo[s]als to her father, offered to become a pro[s]elyte to the reformed religion, and in every other re[s]pect his alliance was unexceptionable. Sir Ferdinando, flattering him[s]elf that I[s]abelle was not altogether aver[s]e to the union, referred Fitz-Howard to his [s]i[s]ter for a final an[s]wer; and lady Dudley, prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed in his favour by his [s]pecious manners, eager to confirm him a convert to the Prote[s]tant cau[s]e, and wi[s]hing to put an end at once to the hopes of her [s]on, approved his [s]uit; and that very evening, as they were [s]itting conver[s]ing together in an uncon[s]trained, confidential manner, declared to her niece the approbation [s]he had given to the propo[s]als of Fitz-Howard, and advi[s]ed her [s]eriou[s]ly to think of him as the man de[s]tined to become her hu[s]band. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] A[s]toni[s]hment for [s]ome moments kept her [s]ilent; at length [s]he told her aunt, that [s]he was by no means partial to the man [s]he [s]o warmly recommended, nor did [s]he wi[s]h to alter her [s]tate; [s]he was perfectly contented with her pre[s]ent condition. Happy in the affection of her father and lady Dudley, [s]he wi[s]hed not to quit their protection for that of a [s]tranger, and begged leave to decline the propo[s]ed union. "I am much afraid, I[s]abelle," [s]aid that lady, "that you nouri[s]h improper, nay, criminal wi[s]hes. I fear you indulge chimerical hopes of a future union with Henry Dudley. But do not deceive your[s]elf, my child; whil[s]t I live, tho[s]e hopes can never be realized, without incurring the [s]evere[s]t malediction of an offended parent." "If I know my own heart, madam," [s]aid I[s]abelle, [s]omewhat piqued by her aunt's peremptory prohibition, "it never yet has indulged improper hopes or criminal wi[s]hes. Its every emotion has been regulated by your precepts, and I tru[s]t it will never dishonour its noble in[s]tructre[s]s. But if to love and prefer your [s]on above all other human beings con[s]titutes guilt, I am in [s]ome mea[s]ure guilty. I am [s]en[s]ible of the barrier cu[s]tom, and perhaps you will [s]ay, religion, has placed between us; I have no wi[s]h to break through that barrier; but whil[s]t I am [s]atisfied with loving him only as a brother, I [s]ee no rea[s]on why I [s]hould be compelled to become the wife of another." "Nor [s]hall you be compelled, my deare[s]t cou[s]in," [s]aid Dudley, who being in the adjoining apartment (the door of which had been accidentally left ajar) had overheard the whole conver[s]ation; "no divine ordinance forbids our union; then why [s]hould superstition impo[s]e [s]uch [s]hackles on us? Have we not reason to direct us? Why then [s]hould we [s]ubmit blindly and implicitly to the opinions of others? Madam, look not thus angry on me," continued he, turning toward his mother. "You have heard from her own lips the preference with which my charming cou[s]in honours me; then give her to me freely, and with her be[s]tow your maternal benediction. For here, in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] the [s]ight of Heaven, I vow [s]olemnly to have no wife but her, to live but for her [s]ake, and may that moment put a period to my exi[s]tence, in which [s]he is [s]eparated from me." It was in vain lady Dudley attempted to interrupt him before the [s]olemn vow had pa[s][s]ed his lips; in vain [s]he entreated him to recal it. He repeated it with a vehemence that made her tremble; and turning from him in di[s]plea[s]ure, [s]he took the hand of the affrighted I[s]abelle, and led her from the apartment. Di[s]gui[s]e had now become u[s]ele[s]s to all parties. I[s]abelle, daily tormented by the a[s][s]iduities of Fitz-Howard, admonished by her aunt and threatened by her father, felt exi[s]tence a burthen. The time [s]he was obliged to pa[s]s in company [s]he laboured under the mo[s]t cruel con[s]traint, and her hours of retirement were [s]pent in [s]ighs, tears, and unavailing complaints. Dudley no longer made one of the family. He had removed to a hou[s]e of his own, where he had [s]olicited his mother to pre[s]ide; but her affection for her brother had prompted her at fir[s]t to decline the propo[s]al, and the rea[s]on may ea[s]ily be conceived, why Henry now cea[s]ed to urge his reque[s]t. Fitz-Howard too had quitted the hou[s]e of Sir Ferdinando, for apartments where, being him[s]elf ma[s]ter, his actions were not [s]o [s]trictly [s]crutinized as they were liable to be in the family of a man virtuous from principle, and [s]incerely pious, without being either a bigot or an enthu[s]ia[s]t. Though Dudley was no longer an inmate in the family, he was a daily vi[s]itant at the hou[s]e of his uncle, and found [s]ufficient opportunities to forward his [s]uit with I[s]abelle; per[s]ecuted on one [s]ide, and earnestly [s]olicited on the other, where is the wonder that [s]he [s]hould li[s]ten to the [s]yren voice of honourable love, and, be[s]towing her hand on him who had long possessed her heart, become the wife of Dudley? Secretly, and by his own chaplain, was the ceremony performed. They waited a favourable moment to [s]upplicate a paternal ble[s][s]ing, and, fearful of a premature discovery, became more circum[s]pect in their behaviour towards each other; their interviews were conducted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] with the utmo[s]t caution, and [s]u[s]picion was again lulled a[s]leep. But Fitz-Howard [s]till per[s]i[s]ted in his addre[s][s]es, though treated with the mo[s]t contemptuous coldne[s]s by the object of his adoration. The [s]pring was now rapidly advancing, and the lady Dudley removed with her niece to an elegant seat [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed near Wind[s]or. Sir Ferdimando, fully occupied in the laudable de[s]ign of extending the blessings him[s]elf enjoyed, to di[s]tant, unenlightened nations, [s]eldom quitted the capital, except for an hour or two, to breathe the fre[s]h air, and enjoy the plea[s]ure of beholding his beloved child. In this retirement, Dudley often vi[s]ited his wife; and unfortunately, Fitz-Howard, who had taken up his [s]ummer re[s]idence at Wind[s]or, [s]aw him come from the garden of lady Dudley one morning at four o'clock. That a [s]on [s]hould be [s]een coming from the dwelling of his mother, was in it[s]elf nothing [s]urpri[s]ing; but Fitz-Howard know there was a coolne[s]s between them, and [s]hrewdly [s]u[s]pected to whom the[s]e early visits were paid. His chief knowledge of the [s]ex being formed from his acquaintance among the mo[s]t unworthy part, he had always affirmed that every woman may be won, however [s]eemingly virtuous. Impressed with this idea, he imagined I[s]abelle had forgot the re[s]pect due to her[s]elf, and, whil[s]t his brea[s]t [s]welled with envy at the [s]uppo[s]ed good fortune of Dudley, he re[s]olved to [s]hare her favours with him. To this end he became more a[s][s]iduous in his vi[s]its; and one evening having followed her into the garden, informing her fir[s]t with his knowledge of Henry's visits, he addre[s][s]ed her in terms that made the cha[s]te [s]oul of I[s]abelle congeal to an icicle. Swelling re[s]entment for a moment kept her [s]ilent, and when her words found vent, that laudable re[s]entment added keenne[s]s to her reproof. Her pointed rebukes, which [s]hould have effectually repul[s]ed his pa[s][s]ion, [s]erved but to inflame it; he caught her in his arms; [s]he [s]hrieked; her voice caught the ear of her hu[s]band, who had ju[s]t entered the garden by a private door, to keep an appointment he had made with her the preceding day. Again [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] [s]he [s]hrieked; he redoubled his [s]peed, and entering the arbour, [s]truck the a[s][s]ailer of his honour to the earth, before his [s]tep had been heard approaching. I[s]abelle was a woman po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]trong fortitude; but terror, joy, apprehen[s]ion at once a[s][s]ailed her, and [s]he [s]unk fainting upon the earth. Her hu[s]band stooped to rai[s]e her, and the cowardly Fitz-Howard, meditating only revenge, recovered from the blow which had for a moment [s]tunned his faculties, [s]natched a stiletto from his [s]ide, where he con[s]tantly wore it, and plunged it into the bo[s]om of Dudley. The cries of I[s]abelle had reached the ear of her aunt, and [s]he had [s]ent out [s]ervants in que[s]t of her. They approached the arbour with torches, at the very moment this bloody deed was perpetrated, and in the confu[s]ion that en[s]ued, Fitz-Howard e[s]caped. The apparently lifele[s]s bodies were rai[s]ed, and borne into the hou[s]e. I[s]abelle in a few moments recovered, but the [s]oul of Dudley was fled forever. The de[s]pair of his mother was great, yet was it not to be compared with the angui[s]h of heart under which the unfortunate I[s]abelle [s]uffered; for to the lo[s]s of the being [s]he prized mo[s]t on earth, was added the reproaches of her aunt, and the re[s]entment of her father. In the fir[s]t moments of her [s]orrow [s]he di[s]clo[s]ed the [s]ecret of their marriage, and lady Dudley, far from blaming her[s]elf as the author of the fatal cata[s]trophe, told the heart broken I[s]abelle, it was a ju[s]t puni[s]hment (no doubt [s]ent from Heaven) for her di[s]obedience and unlawful love. Sir Ferdinando forbade her his pre[s]ence, and [s]he was driven from the hou[s]e of her aunt by repeated taunts and upbraidings. As the widow of Dudley, [s]he was in affluent circum[s]tances; but of what value is wealth to the po[s][s]e[s][s]or, "When each fond affection is fled, "And each [s]en[s]e of plea[s]ure lies cold." She could not be [s]aid to live; it was barely existence; exi[s]tence not worth pre[s]erving, yet obliged to be endured. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] At length [s]he became a mother, and the tenderne[s]s, the cares and plea[s]ures naturally attendant on the maternal character, awakened her dormant [s]en[s]ibility. Her feelings were not dead, only benumbed; as the limpid [s]tream, arre[s]ted in its cour[s]e by the chilly hand of winter, becomes [s]tagnant, nay, almo[s]t an impenetrable ma[s]s, till the infant [s]pring, with genial warmth, gradually di[s][s]olves the frigid [s]pell; when it again proceeds in its u[s]ual meanders, beautifying and fertilizing every meadow through which it pa[s][s]es. So the mind of I[s]abelle, awakened from its torpid [s]tate by her infant [s]on, expanded to receive the new-born plea[s]ure of rearing and in[s]tructing him. Every fond affection of her [s]oul centered in him, and if [s]he studied to improve her mind, it was ever with the delightful hope of tran[s]mitting that improvement to the mind of her child. From the day of Henry's death, the lady Dudley had declined, and [s]he died without forgiving I[s]abelle. Sir Ferdinando's re[s]entment had been powerful, but his affection towards his daughter was greater; and when there was no longer any one to keep the former awake, it grandually died away, and the latter revived with all its primitive [s]ervor. He [s]ent for his daughter, was reconciled to her, and breaking up his own hou[s]ehold, became an inmate in her man[s]ion. His grand[s]on amu[s]ed his [s]olitary hours, and made the chords of [s]en[s]ibility vibrate in delicious harmony; whil[s]t I[s]abelle, with cheerful, unaffected, filial piety, [s]oftened the pillow of declining age, and [s]trewed the path that leads but to the grave, with flowers [s]o [s]weet, its rude de[s]cent was [s]carce perceptible; nor did one thorn or briar appear, to impede the journey or to wound the [s]oct, that mu[s]t per force pa[s]s over it. Young Dudley was chri[s]tened Edward; "For alas!" [s]aid his mother, "Henry was an unfortunate name. Care[s][s]ed, almo[s]t idelized by his grandfather, and educated immediately under his own eye, Edward almo[s]t imperceptibly imbibed the enterprizing [s]pirit that had characterized his ance[s]tors. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] He delighted in conver[s]ing with Otooa, a native of North-America, who was a [s]ervant to Sir Ferdinando. His little heart would bound with tran[s]port at the de[s]cription of va[s]t oceans, immea[s]urable continents, and climes as yet unexplored by Europeans; and, [s]eized with an irre[s]i[s]tible de[s]ire to vi[s]it the new world in America, in the year 1632, embarked for New-England. His inquiring nature found ample gratification, in ob[s]erving in this novel [s]eene, the various flowers, plants, [s]hrubs, infects, birds and animals, to which the European world were [s]trangers. Simple in his manners, rational in his opinions, and truly sincere in his profe[s][s]ions of piety, Edward Dudley became a favourite in the colony. And when the death of his grandfather called him home, he was parted with unwillingly, and with [s]incere regret. He married in the year 1644 the lady Arrabella Ruthven; and the troubles in England [s]oon after increasing, on account of the per[s]ecution of di[s][s]enters, who[s]e religious tenets Dudley favoured, he [s]old his e[s]tates; and, purcha[s]ing a ve[s][s]el, which he loaded with provi[s]ions, farming uten[s]ils, and [s]ome merchandize, him[s]elf and lady, (who from that time was styled dame Arrabella) with an exten[s]ive hou[s]ehold, embarked for New-Hamp[s]hire, and landed, after a fatiguing voyage, in October, 1645, in tolerable health, and mo[s]t excellent [s]pirits. Bidding the tranced fancy fly O'er oceans va[s]t from [s]hore to [s]hore. Dudley and his fair companion having transported over, in the ve[s][s]el with them[s]elves, the frame, and every material nece[s][s]ary to form a complete habitation, immediately on landing, employed workmen to [s]et it up; but the cold coming on more rapidly than they expected, but little progre[s]s could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] be made that winter, and Arrabella [s]uffered much inconvenience from the want of tho[s]e indulgencies to which, from her birth, [s]he had been accu[s]tomed. But [s]he was not a woman to complain for trifles, or, having once embarked in a cau[s]e, ea[s]ily to be frighted from pur[s]uing it. The inclemency of the winter was accordingly pa[s][s]ed over with patience, and as [s]oon as the enlivening [s]un relaxed the [s]prings and called the tender herbage forth, two apartments in their new hou[s]e being rendered habitable, [s]he exerted her utmo[s]t endeavours to add a degree of neatne[s]s and elegance to what was ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary for comfort. All the accompli[s]hments [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, were at her lei[s]ure hours exerted to embellish and render their dwelling plea[s]ant. It was situated above ten miles from the [s]ea. Dudley had, on his fir[s]t arrival, purcha[s]ed a large tract of uncultivated land. Having got a [s]mall portion of it clear, immediately [s]urrounding his habitation, Arrabella, both by her ta[s]te, and knowledge in agriculture, a[s][s]i[s]ted in rendering it at once plea[s]ant and [s]erviceable. Part of it was converted into a kitchen garden, to the cultivation of which Arrabella was particularly attentive. With her own hands would [s]he weed, water, or tran[s]plant the young vegetables; and having [s]own a few flower [s]eeds which [s]he had brought with her from Europe, the watching a plant as it advanced in growth, or a bud as it gradually di[s]clo[s]ed the opening flower, afforded her the mo[s]t innocent [s]atisfaction; and from this con[s]tant attention to her garden, [s]he gleaned at once employment, health and amu[s]ement. But Arrabella did not neglect her needle; and when the en[s]uing year produced them a [s]mall quantity of flax from their own land, with what exulting pride did [s]he purcha[s]e a wheel, and [s]et about manufacturing it into linen for her family u[s]e! Delightful age of primitive [s]implicity, when the mother of a numerous family did not blu[s]h (though [s]urrounded by affluence) to [s]et the example of industry to her daughters; when [s]he would pre[s]ide among[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] them, whil[s]t they were converting the produce of their father's flocks and fields into clothing for the family. And with what a laudable pride did [s]he look round on her hu[s]band, her children and [s]ervants, and [s]ay, "That cloth, that linen, tho[s]e gowns, are all of our own manufacturing." Their wants were few, and tho[s]e few were amply [s]upplied; plenty pre[s]ided at their board, and cheerfulness was a con[s]tant inmate in their dwellings. But indolence introduced luxury with her innumerable train of artificial wants. Though at fir[s]t repul[s]ed, [s]till would the forcere[s]s return, varying her [s]hape to gain her favourite point; to pride, [s]he took the form of nece[s][s]ity; to the voluptuous, [s]he wore the [s]emblance of indulgence; to each [s]he appeared in [s]ome [s]eductive form, and none but the truly indu[s]trious hand and contented heart could bid defiance to her arts. Alas! the number was but [s]mall that e[s]caped the contagion [s]he [s]pread through all ranks of people, till at length the fa[s]cination became univer[s]al. By her magic power [s]he threw a mi[s]t over the di[s]cerning optics of even the mo[s]t rational; they [s]aw not the deformity [s]he concealed under her gorgeous robe, but blindly worshipped, whil[s]t [s]he led them to the very brink of ruin. A few years rendered the habitation of Dudley and Arrabella extremely delightful, and, added to other numerous comforts and ble[s][s]ings which they enjoyed, was a ri[s]ing family of beautiful children. How did this family at once increa[s]e the plea[s]ures and the cares of their re[s]pectable mother! Anxious not only for their pre[s]ent but future happine[s]s, [s]he laboured to cultivate their under[s]tandings, and point out to them [s]ources of mental plea[s]ure, that would delightfully fill up every moment when employment pau[s]ed. The morning walk, the evening ramble, [s]till afforded [s]omething to in[s]truct and improve. Non was the winter evening [s]terile or unprofitable. Edifying conversation, books and needle-work, charmingly diversisied the [s]cene, blending the u[s]eful with the agreeable. It was in the [s]ummer of 1661, the elde[s]t child of Dudley, a [s]on named William, who was about fifteen [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] years old, and his younge[s]t, a daughter called Rachel, [s]carcely two, when [s]ome di[s]agreements having fallen out between the native Indians and the Engli[s]h [s]ettlers, the former frequently made inroads on the latter, plundering and burning their habitations, and either massacreing the inhabitants, or taking them pri[s]oners and carrying them up the country, where they often exercised on them the mo[s]t wanton barbarity; [s]calping, maiming and disfiguring them, if at la[s]t they [s]uffered them to e[s]cape with life. But what could be expected from the untaught [s]avage, who[s]e territories had been invaded by [s]trangers, and who perhaps had suffered, from the cruelty of the invaders, in the per[s]on of a father, brother, [s]on, or [s]ome near connexion. Revenge is a principle inherent in human nature, and it is only the [s]ublime and heavenly doctrine of Christianity that teaches us to repel the impul[s]e, and return good for evil. The morning was fine. Cheerful had Arrabella aro[s]e, and, [s]urrounded by her little family, joined with their father in their morning adorations to the Giver of all good. This indi[s]pen[s]able duty performed, Dudley went to [s]uperintend his mowers; and his wife, calling her girls, to the number of five, together, began the u[s]ual ta[s]k of in[s]truction. But the little Rachel was not inclined to be quiet; [s]he was more inclined for play than [s]itting [s]till. She climbed up in her mother's lap, ki[s][s]ed her, and in childi[s]h [s]port threw the book on the floor. "It is impo[s][s]ible to attend [s]eriou[s]ly to any thing," [s]aid her mother, "whil[s]t this little mad-cap is here. Do, William, take her into the garden. William obeyed, and from the garden [s]trayed into an adjoining wood, where, intent on a book which his father had de[s]ired him to peru[s]e with attention, he [s]uffered the little prattler to play round, pluck flowers, and catch gra[s]shoppers. Arrabella was pur[s]uing her employment, with all the delight a fond mother can feel, who marks the daily improvement of her children, and [s]ees them eagerly [s]triving who [s]hould foremo[s]t reach the goal of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] perfection, when an old [s]ervant, the only male then about the hou[s]e, ru[s]hed into the apartment, exclaiming, with looks of horror, "The natives! the natives!" Starting from her [s]eat with precipitation, [s]he turned towards the window, and [s]aw a band of [s]avages crossing through a field of corn, not very far from the hou[s]e. "Fly! fly! my children," [s]he cried, taking the two younge[s]t by the hand; and followed by the elde[s]t, they ru[s]hed out of a door that led a contrary way to the road the [s]avages were coming. There was in the very wood where William had wandered with his infant [s]i[s]ter, a cavern formed by the cunning hand of nature, the rece[s][s]es of which Arrabella had in days of happine[s]s frequently explored. Her pre[s]ence of mind in this terrifying exigence did not for[s]ake her. With ha[s]ty, yet trembling [s]teps, [s]he led her children thither; nor was it till re[s]ting on the ground in its remote[s]t winding, when [s]he felt her five children hanging about her, that [s]he recollected William and Rachel. "Oh! my children! my children!" exclaimed [s]he, [s]uddenly [s]tarting up. "We are all here, mother," they an[s]wered with united voices. "But where! Oh where!" cried [s]he franticly, "is your brother William, and your [s]i[s]ter Rachel?" "Oh! my poor brother, my dear, [s]weet little [s]i[s]ter," [s]aid the children [s]everally; "let us go back, mother, let us go back and look for them." "No, my darlings, no!" [s]he replied, [s]inking again on the ground, and drawing them clo[s]er towards her; "that would indeed be to [s]uffer you to run into the very claws of the de[s]troyer. The great God of heaven and earth in[s]pired me with the thought of bringing you here for [s]afety; he will, I tru[s]t, protect us; and his power to protect and [s]ave, even from the jaws of death, is equal throughout this wide-extended universe. He can guard all your brothers, your [s]i[s]ter, and your father too. Let us kneel, my children, and implore his mercy." At the mention of their father, and the recollection of their brothers, Charles, James and Chri[s]topher, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] were in the field with him, the girls wept aloud. Arrabella poured forth her [s]oul in fervent prayer, and the kneeling innocents, in broken accents, [s]obbed amen . The female [s]ervants, terrified at the approach of the [s]avages, in their eagerne[s]s to elude them ran directly into their power, and in[s]tantly became victims to their fury. They di[s]patched them with their tomahawks, and, [s]tripping off their [s]calps, kept them as proofs of their endeavours to extirpate the Engli[s]h from among[s]t them. The man who had alarmed his mi[s]tre[s]s ran out of the hou[s]e by the [s]ame way [s]he had taken; but thinking it would be right to alarm his ma[s]ter, in[s]tead of following her, made the be[s]t of his way to the field where the mowers were at work. The [s]avages having rifled the hou[s]e of provi[s]ions, wearing apparel, and every thing which they conceived would be any ways [s]erviceable to them[s]elves, [s]et fire to it, and then departed, with horrid yells of exultation at having done all the mi[s]chief in their power to an Engli[s]h family. William was, at the moment the flames bur[s]t forth, ju[s]t returning with his little [s]i[s]ter. His father's hou[s]e on fire, and a band of Indians in frantic rage ha[s]tening towards them, was a [s]ight that filled with the mo[s]t horrid pre[s]ages the brea[s]t of William. He [s]aw there would be no way to e[s]cape them; [s]o, cla[s]ping the infant Rachel in his arms, he knelt on the ground, fear almo[s]t [s]u[s]pending every faculty. One of the foremo[s]t of the [s]avage troop had rai[s]ed his tomahawk to di[s]patch the boy; but the child, with one arm clinging to her brother's neck, extended the other little innocent hand as if to ward off the blow, and [s]creaming, cried, "Don'tee, don'tee." At that moment a [s]quaw, who held a papou[s]e at her brea[s]t, threw her[s]elf before the [s]uppliant children, and [s]aid in their own language, "You [s]hall not kill the infant." The attempt [s]eemed to have been the impul[s]e of the moment, for it required but little per[s]ua[s]ion to turn the Indian from his purpo[s]e; he dropped the instrument of death; William [s]tarted from the ground, ran to the kind hearted woman, ki[s][s]ed her hands, bathed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] them with his tears, and pointing to the [s]ky, gave her to under[s]tand, that the Power who dwelt above that azure firmament would reward her. Her own infant being returned to her back, (the mode in which the Indian women in general carry their children) [s]he took Rachel in her arms; and William being made to a[s][s]i[s]t in carrying their plunder, they proceeded on their march; a weary march it was to the poor little captives. Otawee, for that was the name of their protectre[s]s, did all [s]he could to make little Rachel ea[s]y, but [s]he continued at intervals to cry for her mother; and William, his feet lacerated by the [s]harp flints and thorns he encountered in the rugged paths through which he was obliged to pa[s]s, his heart bleeding for what he thought mu[s]t have been the fate of his beloved parents, brothers and [s]i[s]ters, proceeded as well as he could till towards the evening of the [s]econd day, when, overcome with fatigue, grief and long fa[s]ting, (for he could not eat the food they offered him) he fell fainting to the earth. Fortunately they were now near the end of their march, or it is more than probable the unfortunate boy would have been left to peri[s]h in the woods. As it was, two young Indians bore him between them to the water-[s]ide, put him in a canoe, and Otawee [s]itting down be[s]ide him, threw water on his face, rai[s]ed his head on her knee, and forcing him to [s]wallow a little [s]pirits, he by degrees recovered. This party of plunderers were natives of Narhaganset. Two or three unprincipled and licentious Europeans having made incur[s]ions among[s]t them, plundering their little [s]ettlements, burning their wigwams, and practi[s]ing other enormities, as mu[s]t certainly awaken a [s]pirit of revenge in the bo[s]om of persons better regulated than tho[s]e of untutored [s]avages; [s]everal families who had been particularly injured, formed them[s]elves into a party, and embarking in their canoes, proceeded up Connecticut river, landing wherever they thought there was no fear of oppo[s]ition, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] and wreaking their vengeance on the unguarded and innocent inhabitants. Dudley had, from his fir[s]t [s]ettlement, been a man of peace; happy in his family, fully employed in cultivating and improving his little domain, he [s]tepped not out of his own dome[s]tic concerns, except it was to a[s][s]i[s]t a neighbour, (for any European family, [s]ettled within twenty miles, was at that early period termed a neighbour) or to in[s]truct a new [s]ettler in the be[s]t mode of clearing his lands; to which in[s]tructions he ever readily added any help his [s]ervants, hor[s]es, oxen, or even him[s]elf could give. Such a man could hardly be [s]uppo[s]ed an object of enmity to any; but his habitation had been marked by an Indian who had [s]trayed from his companions. Its lonely [s]ituation, its flouri[s]hing appearance, which promi[s]ed plenty of plunder without fear of oppo[s]ition, determined them to attack it; but when they had committed this outrage on a quiet, inoffen[s]ive family, they well knew it would not be long before they were pur[s]ued. They accordingly made all the ha[s]te they could to the place where they had left their canoes, and embarking with the plunder they had obtained, proceeded immediately home. On their way thither, meeting with a party who came from the more ea[s]tern parts; and, fearful that the young captives they had, might, if [s]een, betray them to the Engli[s]h, they [s]old them, and William and Rachel were carried to a greater di[s]tance than it could hardly be believed possible for the Indians to proceed in their little birch canoes. When being landed on a very wild and totally uncultivated place, they were marched three days journey from the [s]ea-[s]hore, and pre[s]ented to the [s]quaw of their [s]achem for [s]ervants. Otooganoo was a man naturally gentle, fond of peace, and eager in his endeavours to promote the welfare of his people. He had ever recommended to them to treat the [s]trangers who were come to [s]ettle among[s]t them with ho[s]pitality; but it was not in his power to re[s]train the impetuo[s]ity of youth, or to curb the licentious hand of the rapacious. When the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] young captives were brought to his wigwam, he rebuked tho[s]e who brought them, and bade William to bani[s]h all his fears; for he would be a father to him, and, if ever opportunity offered, re[s]tore him to his natural parent. His wife was particularly plea[s]ed with little Rachel, and the kindne[s]s of the[s]e two good Indians rendered the lives of the brother and [s]i[s]ter as comfortable as the nature of their [s]ituation would admit of. Real Afflictions. At the alarm given by the [s]ervant mentioned in the preceding chapter, Mr. Dudley, accompanied by his labourers and little [s]ons, made all po[s][s]ible ha[s]te to the hou[s]e; but who can de[s]cribe his feelings, when he beheld the man[s]ion where he had taken his morning's repa[s]t in all the [s]ecurity of con[s]cious innocence of heart, and in which he had left tho[s]e trea[s]ures of his [s]oul, his wife and [s]even children, a heap of smoking ruins? When he beheld, [s]tretched on the earth, the mangled bodies of his female [s]ervants, the fortitude of the man was lo[s]t in the angui[s]h of the hu[s]band and father. He rai[s]ed his hands and eyes in agony towards heaven, his heart was too much oppre[s][s]ed to allow even the relief of tears, and he fell lifele[s]s to the ground. His three [s]ons endeavoured to rai[s]e him, they called repeatedly on his name, and finding he remained totally in[s]en[s]ible, wrung their hands, and wept with convul[s]ive violence. At length nature, which had been only [s]tunned by the [s]uddenne[s]s and greatne[s]s of the affliction, in [s]ome mea[s]ure revived. He rai[s]ed his eyes, he ca[s]t them on his weeping boys, and as if, at the [s]ight of them, recollecting that it was a [s]ignal mercy that they were [s]aved from the general wreck, he endeavoured to repel the [s]en[s]ibility that had overpowered him, and summon re[s]olution to [s]earch round the garden, fields and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] out-hou[s]es, [s]ome of which had e[s]caped the fury of the Indians. But in vain he [s]ought, in vain he repeatedly called on Arrabella and her children; not a ve[s]tige of them could he find. That they e[s]caped out of the hou[s]e before the [s]avages entered, the [s]ervant had informed him; but their weakne[s]s from age and [s]ex, he imagined, would prevent their going far. They might be overtaken in their flight. They might be carried into captivity. A thou[s]and conjectures pre[s]ented themselves to his di[s]tracted thoughts, but none of them glanced towards the right. At length, weary and heart-broken, he was per[s]uaded by his [s]ervants to go, with the remains of his family, to the neare[s]t European [s]ettlement. Accordingly, they put the children in a cart, and Mr. Dudley mounting a hor[s]e, the labourers followed in the be[s]t manner they were able, and late at night they arrived at Plymouth; where the relation of the [s]ad events of the day filled the whole [s]ettlement with alarm. Every one was ready to [s]ympathize with the re[s]pected Dudley, and their [s]ympathy was doubly cordial, as in pitying him, each father of a family felt it might have been his own ca[s]e. But to return to the afflicted mother and her daughters. Never was a day and a night pa[s][s]ed in more agony, never did day and night appear [s]o tedious; the mother, trembling for the fate of her children, and in her own mind certain that her hu[s]band and their father had fallen victims to their [s]avage foe, shuddered at every bla[s]t of wind that howled through the dreary cavern, thinking it was the yell of the Indians. And if, during the long, long night, weary nature paused in momentary forgetfulne[s]s, [s]he would [s]tart with redoubled terror, and call on her children [s]everally, fearing, whil[s]t [s]he had cea[s]ed to watch, they might have been [s]natched from her. Several times did [s]he venture almo[s]t to the mouth of the rece[s]s; but the ru[s]tling of the trees, the [s]ound of animals' feet, which [s]he mi[s]took for human, would make her run back; and nothing but the mo[s]t pre[s][s]ing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] calls of hunger, which her children began to expre[s]s by loud and impatient cries, could have driven her at la[s]t from her retreat. She ventured at la[s]t entirely to quit it, and with feeble [s]teps led her almo[s]t fami[s]hed little group towards the place where their man[s]ion had [s]tood; but alas! no man[s]ion was there. Faint and di[s]pirited, [s]he [s]at down on a rock, and gave free vent to the agony of her [s]oul. "Do not cry [s]o, mother," [s]aid the elde[s]t girl, her own voice almo[s]t choked with [s]obs. "I am very hungry," [s]aid a younger one. "Oh! my children! my children!" cried the distracted mother, "we mu[s]t all peri[s]h together. Your father is no more; your mother has neither bread to give you, or where to [s]helter you from the inclemency of the weather, unle[s]s we return to the cavern, and I fear we are too much exhau[s]ted to reach even that asylum again to-night. "There is the corn-barn, mother," [s]aid one of them, "let us go there." Arrabella con[s]ented; they entered it, and [s]ome few grains of Indian corn being scattered here and there, the children gathered them up, and ate them with avidity. But it was a kind of food, however faint and exhau[s]ted, their mother could not [s]wallow. From the ruins of the hou[s]e they brought part of an earthen pan; this they took to the [s]pring, wa[s]hed it clean, and took it full of water to her. She drank, and was in [s]ome [s]mall degree refreshed. Arrabella had it in contemplation to go to Plymouth; but her own increa[s]ing weakne[s]s, and the extreme youth of two of her girls, made her reject the idea as impracticable; added to which, in the afternoon was a heavy tempe[s]t of thunder, lightning, rain and wind, which would have made [s]uch a journey almo[s]t impo[s][s]ible, even in the be[s]t circum[s]tances. During the whole night, the tempe[s]t continued; and in the morning this unfortunate mother was [s]o reduced by angui[s]h of heart and continued fa[s]ting, added to the damp of the floor on which [s]he lay, which had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] given her a violent cold and [s]tiffened all her limbs, as to find her[s]elf totally unable to ri[s]e. She firmly believed her la[s]t hour was at hand, and recommending her children to the protection of the Almighty, [s]he lay in [s]ilent and uncomplaining expectation of terminating a life, in which [s]he had enjoyed a very large [s]hare of happine[s]s, and which, deprived of its chief comfort in the cho[s]en friend and partner of her heart, had now no longer any charms for her. The elder girls, by [s]earching abroad, had procured [s]ome little [s]u[s]tenance from the fields and hedges; and this they would have gladly [s]hared with their sisters; but alas! poor innocents, they were too far exhausted to be revived by the participation. They lay on the floor be[s]ide their mother, and a faint moan, expre[s][s]ive of their [s]ufferings, was the only [s]ign they gave of exi[s]tence. The third morning dawned from the time of the enemy's inva[s]ion, and [s]till no hope of relief pre[s]ented it[s]elf to the mind of Arrabella; and indeed to [s]uch a [s]tate was [s]he reduced, that hope, fear, every lively sentiment was extinct, and a torpid de[s]pair had taken entire po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of her [s]oul. Dudley, from exce[s][s]ive anxiety, was [s]o very ill as to be unable to leave his bed. The three boys were [s]tationary in his chamber; they hung over him, they admini[s]tered every nouri[s]hment or medicine the doctor pre[s]cribed. Whil[s]t he [s]lept, they waited in trembling [s]ilence, and when he awoke, eagerly [s]trove who [s]hould receive his fir[s]t reque[s]t, and fly to comply with it. But the old [s]ervant and one of the labourers, after taking the matter over one evening, re[s]olved upon vi[s]iting the [s]cene of de[s]olation the en[s]uing morning, to [s]ee if any thing worth pre[s]ervation could be found among[s]t the ruins. It need hardly be mentioned, that in tho[s]e early days, [s]uper[s]tition, (the natural attendant on ignorant minds and contracted educations) pervaded the under[s]tandings of almo[s]t every cla[s]s of people. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] During the walk of old Philip and his companion, from Plymouth to the demain of Dudley, their conversation had turned chiefly on [s]pirits, haunted hou[s]es, and [s]upernatural appearances of every kind. Philip affirmed, that it was his belief, innocent blood was never [s]pilt, but that the [s]pirit of the departed, nightly vi[s]ited the [s]pot where it had been driven from its earthly tabernacle, and called for vengeance on the murderer; nor would it be at peace till that vengeance was executed. "And for my part," continued he with great earne[s]tne[s]s, his a[s]toni[s]hed auditor (who not knowing how to read and write his own name, looked upon Philip, who could, as a wonder of learning) li[s]tening with a[s]toni[s]hment, "for my part, I would no more go to the[s]e ruins after [s]un[s]et, than I would put my hand into a burning fire; for I have no doubt but my poor mi[s]tre[s]s and her dear little ones---" And here he pau[s]ed to give vent to a gu[s]h of tears, and then, as if thinking [s]uch weakne[s]s in a man required an excu[s]e, he added, "She was a good mi[s]tre[s]s; we all loved her like a mother." "Yes, that we did," replied his companion; "I [s]hall never [s]ee the likes of her." "Don't [s]ay that," replied Philip; "I hope there be many as good; but I am morally certain it be an unpossibility to find a better. But as I was [s]aying, I dares to [s]ay, [s]he do walk over the ruins every night, and with her dear little girls. Oh! mercy on me, what's that? Only that it be noon-day, or I [s]hould think---" "As I am a [s]inner," [s]aid the other, "I do [s]ee summat as like little Eliza." They [s]topped, they gazed upon what at the moment they believed a vi[s]ion; it was the elde[s]t daughter of Dudley, who, having [s]trayed toward the road in the hope of [s]eeing [s]ome human being, of whom [s]he might [s]olicit help for her dying mother and [s]i[s]ters, [s]he [s]aw Philip approaching, and in[s]tantly knew him. The exce[s]s of her joy had nearly proved fatal to her, and [s]he [s]unk down among[s]t [s]ome bu[s]hes, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] instantaneously concealing her, the [s]imple clowns imagined [s]he had vani[s]hed. "Well, could not you have [s]worn you [s]aw her?" [s]aid Philip. "Yes, indeed," replied the other, "I would take my bible oath of it." They had now got nearly oppo[s]ite the [s]hrubs which concealed her. The poor child had not entirely fainted; but her languid frame, overcome by the [s]udden flood of tran[s]port that ru[s]hed on her heart at the fight of a human creature, and one [s]he knew, had occasioned a momentary [s]u[s]pen[s]ion of her faculties. She heard their [s]teps as they approached nearer, and rai[s]ing herself on her knees, cried, "Philip, dear, good Philip!" at the [s]ame time extending her hand towards him. Philip trembled, [s]tood agha[s]t, and [s]truggled for breath. His companion covered his face with his hat, and fell on his knees. But Eliza [s]oon di[s][s]ipated their fears, by coming feebly towards them, again repeating, "Philip, dear Philip!" Then earne[s]tly cla[s]ping her hands, [s]he added, "Come, come, and [s]ave my mother." Fearful conjecture was now lo[s]t in joyful certainty. "It is Eliza her[s]elf," cried Philip, catching her up in his arms. "She is alive! Oh! thank God! thank God! And my mi[s]tre[s]s too. How did you e[s]cape the Indians? Oh! this will cure my ma[s]ter; this will make him forget his other lo[s][s]es; they are nothing. A man may build another hou[s]e, but where could he find another wife like my worthy madam Dudley?" They now, directed by Eliza, had reached the place where, [s]carcely exi[s]ting, lay the de[s]pairing Arrabella. One child lay on her left arm, its head re[s]ting on her bo[s]om; another lay at her feet, to all appearance inanimate; a third was [s]eated at a little di[s]tance, supporting in her feeble arms a younger [s]i[s]ter. "Oh merciful!" [s]aid Philip; "good father, what's here? My mi[s]tre[s]s and my [s]weet little ladies all dying. Go run," turning to the labourer, "run back to town, tell them to [s]end a cart, to [s]end victuals and drink, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] and a nur[s]e and a doctor, with bed and a bed[s]tead, and every thing. Good Sirs, what [s]hall I do? Why don't you run? What do you [s]tand for?" In this manner did Philip exclaim, walking backward and forward in wild di[s]order; one moment stopping to gaze at the pale and almo[s]t inanimate form of Arrabella, and the next running from one child to the other, [s]ometimes weeping, [s]ometimes bidding them to be hearty, and frequently [s]earching his pockets, as though he could in them find [s]omething to satisfy their hunger. Extreme [s]en[s]ibility is often not only painful to the po[s][s]e[s][s]or, but prejudicial to tho[s]e whom we may wi[s]h to [s]erve. Philip, with a [s]oul exqui[s]itely formed to dictate all the [s]oft offices of humanity, was not [s]o capable of rendering a real [s]ervice to his di[s]tre[s][s]ed mistress, as was the labourer, who, [s]imply comprehending the nece[s][s]ity of immediate relief being obtained, exerted his utmo[s]t [s]peed to return to Plymouth, where, explaining the nature and urgency of his errand, a [s]hort time only elap[s]ed before, with an ea[s]y conveyance, re[s]torative cordials, and [s]everal women, he again reached the de[s]olated man[s]ion of Dudley. The meeting between Arrabella, her hu[s]band and children, was too pathetic to admit of de[s]cription. The joy [s]uch an unexpected meeting occa[s]ioned, would have been too exqui[s]ite for human nature to [s]upport, had it not been allayed by the certainty that William and Rachel were lo[s]t beyond hope of recovery. With hearts overflowing with tran[s]port, they ble[s][s]ed God that eight of their children were living; and though they acutely felt the lo[s]s of two, yet gratitude tempered affliction, and prevented their repining at the decrees of Him, who[s]e judgments ever go hand in hand with his mercies. When Dudley's health was in [s]ome mea[s]ure restored, he began to think of preparing another habitation before the approach of winter; but no per[s]ua[s]ion could prevail on him to [s]uffer another hou[s]e to be erected on the [s]pot where he had formerly lived. He even took a di[s]like to the whole colony of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] New-Hampshire, and [s]elling his lands, he joined a number of persons, at that time about to make a [s]ettlement at Casco-Bay. It was in vain Arrabella repre[s]ented to him the difficulty of clearing and cultivating a new [s]pot; his mind had never regained its firmne[s]s after the [s]hock it had received, and he per[s]i[s]ted in removing, from the bo[s]om of his friends, to an uncultivated wilderne[s]s. But Arrabella was no longer in her prime. The brilliant genius and indu[s]trious hands which had contributed to improve and embelli[s]h their former dwelling, debilitated by [s]ickne[s]s and [s]orrow, had [s]unk into inanity. For fifteen years, Dudley and his wife [s]uffered almost every [s]pecies of affliction which human nature can endure and live. The throat-di[s]temper raged, and in ten days [s]wept off all their children; the cold Arrabella had contracted in the cavern, and [s]leeping on the damp floor of the corn-barn, had given her a rheumatic complaint, which often confined her eight months out of the twelve. Dudley [s]ought, in the society of his neighbours, a relief from reflection; and his intellectual faculties were [s]o weakened, that he ea[s]ily became the dupe of the artful or avaricious, and his [s]ixtieth birth-day beheld him poor in pur[s]e, depre[s][s]ed in [s]pirit, and devoid of health. "And if virtue, piety and integrity are thus overwhelmed with mi[s]ery," (a[s]ks the man who profe[s][s]es infidelity) "who can believe in an over-ruling Power, who puni[s]hes the evil doer, and rewards the good according to their works?" "All mu[s]t, all do, who do not wilfully harden their hearts, and [s]hut their eyes again[s]t the light of Heaven," replies the humbly hoping Chri[s]tian; "for as the man[s]ion of an earthly king is adorned by gold seven times tried, [s]ilver purified by fire, and precious [s]tones, which, ere they attain a proper brilliancy, mu[s]t [s]ubmit to the knife, the [s]aw, or chi[s][s]el of the artist; [s]o mu[s]t tho[s]e [s]ouls, de[s]tined to [s]hine in the everlasting man[s]ion of the King of kings, pa[s]s through the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] fiery ordeal of affliction, be purified, and poli[s]hed by the correcting finger of the great Source and Fir[s]t Cau[s]e of all [s]ymmetry and beauty." William and Rachel. In the year 1674, the war between the native Americans and the European [s]ettlers raged with uncommon fury. William Dudley, who had, with his little [s]i[s]ter, been carried into captivity in 1661, had now become a per[s]onage of great con[s]equence among[s]t them. Otooganoo, the [s]achem to whom he had been pre[s]ented, po[s][s]e[s][s]ing talents naturally good, and thirsting for knowledge, yet unable to attain it, [s]oon learnt, from his conver[s]ations with William, that he could in [s]ome mea[s]ure gratify this very laudable de[s]ire to be in[s]tructed. William, though young, had, by attention to the documents of his father and the milder instructions of his mother, obtained a very decent knowledge of reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and hi[s]tory. Otooganoo no [s]ooner made this di[s]covery, than William became to him the mo[s]t valuable thing he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. "I will certainly re[s]tore him to his European friends," [s]aid he, "but he [s]hall fir[s]t teach me all he knows. In the mean time, I will be kind to him, nor [s]hall his little [s]i[s]ter ever want a friend or protector; as [s]oon as he has imparted to me his [s]tock of knowledge, I will certainly [s]end him to his friends." Thus argued Otooganoo. But, alas! human nature will be human nature; and when the period arrived that he had gleaned all the knowledge poor William had to impart, his heart was [s]o attached to him, his [s]ociety had afforded him [s]o many days, months, years of real felicity, that he made to his own con[s]cience daily fre[s]h excu[s]es for not [s]ending him from him. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] William him[s]elf, though he frequently [s]poke of them, and expre[s][s]ed a wi[s]h to [s]ee his parents, no longer felt that ardent de[s]ire to return to them, which he experienced in the early days of his captivity. He had become in[s]en[s]ibly attached to Otooganoo; and as, from the effects of his in[s]tructions, his protector had made rapid advances towards civilization, had entirely lo[s]t his natural ferocity, and attained [s]uch a degree of rational information as made him a plea[s]ant companion, William felt that attachment daily increa[s]e. Otooganoo had a daughter. Oberca was full five years younger than William; [s]he was tall, [s]traight, and finely formed. She was, at the time of his arrival among[s]t them, a lively girl of ten years old, wild as the rein-deer, that with fleet [s]teps bounds over the frozen plains of Lapland, and untutored as it is po[s][s]ible for a human being to be. Her looks, her words, her actions, were the genuine impul[s]es of nature. As the little Rachel increa[s]ed in years, it was the employment of her brother's lei[s]ure hours, to in[s]truct her in the Engli[s]h language in the be[s]t manner possible. The book he had with him, on the morning of his capture, was of infinite a[s][s]i[s]tance to him, as by looking at that, he was enabled to form a very tolerable alphabet upon bark, u[s]ing [s]ome of their [s]trong dye instead of ink; and this alphabet [s]erved alike, Otooganoo, Rachel and Oberea, who delighted in partaking their le[s][s]ons, and profited daily by his in[s]tructions. Educated under the immediate eye of a woman like Arrabella, it may naturally be [s]uppo[s]ed, William, though young, had imbibed very [s]trong and ju[s]t ideas of female delicacy and decorum, and the[s]e ideas he laboured ince[s][s]antly to impre[s]s on the mind of his [s]i[s]ter. Oberea li[s]tened attentively, and trea[s]ured every [s]entence he uttered in her heart. She had heard him tell his [s]i[s]ter, that his country-women were the mo[s]t charming women in the world, and Oberea early formed the wi[s]h of being thought charming in the eyes of William. This wi[s]h was a powerful tali[s]man to correct the bad effects of habit, and at the age of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] seventeen, [s]he was [s]o much [s]uperior in manner to her uncivilized a[s][s]ociates, that William, without being aware of it, adored the lovely [s]tatue his art had animated. He was not [s]en[s]ible of the exce[s]s of his tenderne[s]s for the charming Indian, till an accident, by nearly depriving him of her, convinced him at once how necessary [s]he was to his happine[s]s. Some Indians, who dwelt in the town with them, having by traffic with the Europeans, who inhabited the [s]ea-coa[s]ts, procured two or three mu[s]quets, one was brought and presented to Otooganoo, who being mightily plea[s]ed with the pre[s]ent, loaded it, with a de[s]ign of going out in pur[s]uit of game; but not putting his de[s]ign in immediate execution, it was left [s]tanding in one corner of the wigwam. A young [s]avage, particularly attached to Oberea, took it up to examine it, and not understanding how to handle it properly, touched the trigger. It went off, and the contents were lodged in the right [s]ide of Oberea. William heard the report, and the in[s]tant cries of his [s]i[s]ter; he flew to them, and entering, [s]aw both his [s]i[s]ter and her he now found he loved equal with her, lying on the ground, which was covered with blood. The young man, frantic at what had happened, told what he had done, and that he feared he had killed both the girls; but Rachel's fall was the effect of sudden [s]urpri[s]e, and it was [s]oon di[s]covered [s]he was not in the lea[s]t hurt. But Oberea wounded, to all appearance dying, was an object di[s]tracting to William. He rai[s]ed her in his arms, called aloud for help, and having a[s][s]i[s]ted his [s]i[s]ter and an old [s]quaw, to [s]taunch the blood, and bind up the wounds, which were chiefly in the fle[s]hy part of the arm, and having [s]een her open her eyes, and [s]ign to him that [s]he knew him, he walked backwards and forwards, watching her as [s]he dozed, [s]ometimes applying a feather to her mouth to be [s]atisfied [s]he [s]till breathed, and often kneeling down to ki[s]s her hand, which lay motionle[s]s on the out[s]ide of the bed. Otooganoo, during the time [s]he was thought in danger, ob[s]erved the extreme [s]olicitude of William, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] and when [s]he was perfectly recovered, thus addre[s][s]ed him. "You have been to me, young Engli[s]hman, a friend, a companion, an in[s]tructor, now above eight years. I love you with [s]incerity, and I believe you love me." "Do you doubt?" a[s]ked William eagerly. "No, I do not for a moment doubt your [s]incerity. But I have al[s]o di[s]covered that you love my daughter. Your coun[s]els and in[s]tructions have rendered her unfit to match with any of her own countrymen; you are now almo[s]t become one of us; take her, then, to wife; and when age, infirmity or death [s]hall occa[s]ion me to cea[s]e from the cares of life, [s]upply my place, govern my people, direct them by your wi[s]dom, teach them the real value of well-con[s]tructed laws, encourage them in [s]tudying the arts of war; yet lead them, by your example and forbearance, to cultivate a [s]ocial and commercial intercour[s]e, and to pre[s]erve peace with your countrymen, who are become their neighbours, as long as they can pre[s]erve it with honour." William, weaned from his natural friends, tenderly attached to Oberea, perhaps not altogether in[s]en[s]ible to the charms of power, and harbouring a fond hope, that by this union with the family of a [s]achem, he might promote the intere[s]ts of his countrymen in general, and be the cement to bind them in bonds of lasting amity, li[s]tened with delighted attention, plighted his vows of love and con[s]tancy to Otooganoo, and in a few days ratified tho[s]e vows, by binding him[s]elf, by the mo[s]t [s]acred of all ties, to protect and love through life his charming Oberea. Otooganoo lived to [s]ee his [s]on-in-law equally beloved and re[s]pected with him[s]elf, to embrace a grand[s]on whom William called Reuben: "For," [s]aid he, "I have been a bondman and a [s]ervant unto my wife's father, and this my fir[s]t born [s]hall pay my ran[s]om." As the old [s]achem felt his hour approaching, he called his chiefs, and the olde[s]t men of his tribe, about him; and taking the little Reuben in his arms, whil[s]t Oberea, William and Rachel [s]tood on his right hand, thus addre[s][s]ed them: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] "Warriors and Chiefs, Natives and undoubted Lords of this va[s]t country, li[s]ten to your departing father. I have ruled over you now above forty years; I have ever found you obedient to my commands, and affectionate to my family. But the great Spirit who[s]e throne is on the loftie[s]t mountain, and who[s]e breath pa[s][s]ing over the great lake, can make it rage even as the wild tyger, when, [s]uddenly [s]pringing from his secret hiding-place, he tears and mangles his defencele[s]s prey; or [s]oftly moving over its broad [s]urface, renders it [s]mooth, beautiful and enticing as is the [s]yren, who charms but to de[s]troy; this wondrous, incomprehensible Spirit, who gave me life and motion, recals the precious gift, and in a [s]hort time I [s]hall be du[s]t." Otooganoo pau[s]ed; his whole [s]oul was filled with the [s]ublimity of the BEING of whom he had been [s]peaking, and a moment was given to feelings beyond expre[s][s]ion exqui[s]ite. Recovering the firmne[s]s of his voice, he thus proceeded: "Friends, Countrymen, Children, had I a [s]on, I well know your unanimous con[s]ent would nominate him my [s]ucce[s][s]or. Behold, then, the [s]on of my choice, the friend of my [s]oul, the hu[s]band of my daughter. He is brave, he is wife, he is humane! alike competent to pro[s]ecute war with vigour, or preserve peace with honour. He is, you will [s]ay, a [s]on of our invaders, of our common enemy. But con[s]ider them as enemies no longer. Bury the warhatchet twenty feet under ground, and [s]moke the great pipe of peace, who[s]e fragrance may a[s]cend even to the heaven of heavens. Hail the[s]e Europeans as brethren, and follow henceforth their precept of doing as you would be done by." "We will! we will!" they all exclaimed; when Otooganoo thus continued: "Chiefs, Elders and brother Warriors, in recommending to your choice this young man, I mean not to relinqui[s]h the affection you have ever [s]hown my family. No. Behold this child, the [s]on of my daughter; in him you [s]ee your rightful [s]achem. But I am [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] pa[s][s]ing from this world to the land of [s]pirits, and this infant is incompetent to [s]upply my place. Who then [s]o able, who [s]o worthy as his father, to govern and direct you, and in[s]truct the young [s]achem how to guard your liberties, and pre[s]erve your love inviolate." Otoogano cea[s]ed, and an old warrior thus replied: "The offspring of Otooganoo, the [s]on of Oberea, will ever be honoured and re[s]pected. We are content to receive, during his childhood, the Engli[s]hman William, and to adopt the new faith thou ha[s]t lately taught and practi[s]ed. As the Europeans deal by us, [s]o deal we by them, and the great Spirit judge us both." Otooganoo [s]urvived this conference but a few days; he pa[s][s]ed (to u[s]e his own expre[s][s]ion) to the land of [s]pirits, and William Dudley was cho[s]en [s]achem in his [s]tead, by the unanimous voice of the whole tribe. "As the Europeans deal by us, [s]o deal we by them, and the great Spirit judge us both." This was the oath they took, and mo[s]t religiou[s]ly did they keep it. But if the profe[s][s]ors of Chri[s]tianity practi[s]e not themselves what they would teach to others, who can blame the [s]avage, who (in [s]eeking his own gratification, or promoting his own intere[s]t, regards not the happine[s]s or intere[s]t of a fellow creature) follows but the example [s]et him? The new [s]ettlers made daily encroachments on the native inhabitants, drove them from their lands, robbed them of their wives, and made their children prisoners. Was it in human nature to bear the[s]e injuries tamely? No; they re[s]ented them. And even William him[s]elf, though his heart bled at what mu[s]t be the con[s]equence, could not attempt to repel the [s]pirit of ju[s]t vengeance that actuated the minds of all. War was declared on both [s]ides, and pur[s]ued with unremitting fury. Among[s]t the young warriors that lived under the government of William, was Yankoo. He was intrepid, bold, and daring. He hated the Europeans; yet, [s]pite of that hate which [s]eemed inherent in his nature, his heart was [s]u[s]ceptible of tenderne[s]s for one of the race. The beauty of Rachel had penetrated his [s]oul. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-170.jpg) \- external link  - Blank Page. ] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] experienced for them not being extinct in his bo[s]om, he felt his heart divided between two [s]eparate intere[s]ts; and if at any time a [s]kirmi[s]h took place, he would think that, perhaps, among[s]t the killed or wounded of the enemy, he might have to lament a father or a brother. And whil[s]t he was publickly obliged to appear rejoiced at the [s]ucce[s]s of the Indians, he would privately lament the defeat of his own countrymen. The [s]oul of Rachel was equally agitated. Alas! who can de[s]cribe the feelings of a heart thus divided? She dared not pray, for to which party could [s]he wi[s]h [s]ucce[s]s? "Oh! [s]ave, protect and [s]upport my father," [s]he would cry; then in a moment recollecting, [s]he would wring her hands and cry, "Oh! poor Yankoo." It is angui[s]h only to be felt, it is impo[s][s]ible to convey the [s]malle[s]t idea of its excruciating tortures, to any who have not experienced the agonizing effects of divided affection. The Engli[s]h had been driven to the very borders of the [s]ea; the Indians had pur[s]ued them with unremitting fury, ravaging the habitations, and, giving the unoffending inmates a quick pa[s][s]port to eternal re[s]t with their tomahawks, nor command nor entreaty could re[s]train their impetuo[s]ity. William had followed a party led by Yankoo, to a hou[s]e [s]ituated in a deep wood. As they approached, a cry of terror i[s][s]ued from the dwelling. The heart of William throbbed with anxiety; he quickened his [s]teps, and arrived at the door ju[s]t as Yankoo had dragged forth by his venerable locks, a man, whom he no [s]ooner beheld than he recognized the features of his father. The arm was rai[s]ed that was meant to destroy him. "Hold, mon[s]ter! barbarian!" exclaimed William, and throwing him[s]elf on the body of his father, received the falling weapon on his own [s]houlder. It fell heavy, it [s]unk deep, and the blood i[s][s]ued in a torrent from the wound. Yankoo recoiled with horror; he beheld his ruler, his friend, and more than tho[s]e, the brother of Rachel, weltering in gore, wounded even unto death, and by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] his hand. He knelt upon the ground, he took his hand. "Oh! brave warrior," [s]aid he, "why did you throw your[s]elf in my way?" William rai[s]ed himself, and pointing to old Mr. Dudley, cried, "To [s]ave a father." The old gentleman, in [s]ome mea[s]ure relieved from his fright, endeavoured to ri[s]e from the earth; but hearing the expre[s][s]ion of father from the lips of one whom he [s]uppo[s]ed an Indian chief, the truth began to dawn upon his mind. He knelt be[s]ide the dying [s]achem, and taking his hand, looked earne[s]tly in his face, and cried, "Is it indeed po[s][s]ible? are you my [s]on?" "Your own [s]on William," replied the bleeding warrior. "But alas!" [s]aid the old man, "you are, I fear, mortally wounded." "And if I am," replied the heroic William, "it is a glorious wound; for I give my life to pre[s]erve the life of him from whom I received it." As he fini[s]hed the[s]e words, he fell back and his eyes clo[s]ed. The whole party were now a[s][s]embled round their wounded chief; they rai[s]ed him from the earth, and bore him into his father's cottage, where, confined by infirmity, was the unfortunate patient Arrabella. She had heard the exclamations of her hu[s]band; her heart had not yet become callous to mi[s]ery. The beholding her long-lo[s]t [s]on, was double agony, [s]ince [s]he but beheld his clo[s]ing [s]cene. He recovered a moment after they had laid him on the bed, gazed on the countenance of his mother, faintly articulated her name, and his la[s]t breath pa[s][s]ed in imploring a ble[s][s]ing on her. The news of their [s]achem's death, and by whom, [s]oon reached the tribe William had governed, and they repaired to the place of his decea[s]e, vowing revenge on his murderer; for in that light they looked upon Yankoo. But when they ru[s]hed furiou[s]ly into the hou[s]e, intending to wreak their vengeance on him, the mute [s]orrow depicted on his face, as with his arms folded on his bo[s]om he [s]tood contemplating the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] mangled form of his departed friend, for a moment disarmed their rage. He [s]aw them enter, and advancing intrepidly towards them, "Friends, Countrymen, and brother Warriors," [s]aid he, with a firm voice, "that I have incurred your hatred, that your rage is ju[s]tly excited, is a truth I pretend not to evade or deny. I have de[s]erved death at your hands, and behold, here I [s]tand prepared to meet it. Strike; I will not flinch; or lead me forth, and let me experience the mo[s]t cruel tortures, I will not complain; nor [s]igh nor groan [s]hall e[s]cape my lips. Alas! if torture could wring them from me, how loud would my lamentations now be! The chief whom we all loved, the man we all revered, is gone to the land of [s]pirits; is gone to that Father, that great Fir[s]t Cau[s]e, of whom we have [s]o often heard him [s]peak. He is pa[s][s]ed from us, and my hand gave the pa[s][s]port, [s]igning it with his blood." He pau[s]ed, and his untamed [s]pirit [s]welled even to his eyes; but he repelled the tokens of his [s]en[s]ibility, that were almo[s]t bur[s]ting from the gli[s]tening orbits, and [s]truggling for a moment to recover the firmne[s]s of his voice, proceeded: "Thou art gone, brave chief! (turning as he [s]poke towards the body of his friend) thou art gone; and where [s]hall thy equal be found to [s]upply thy place? Thou wert bold and daring as the young lion, and like him, generous and noble, exerted not thy power again[s]t the feeble and defencele[s]s. Firm and un[s]haken in asserting the rights of innocence, as the mountain who[s]e foundation is in the centre of the earth, and who[s]e top reacheth unto the clouds; yet gentle as the [s]outh-we[s]t breeze on an evening in the blo[s][s]om [s]ea[s]on, and complying as the willow, that inclines its head as the breeze pa[s][s]es. Thy voice was the voice of wi[s]dom. Thy words taught le[s][s]ons, which thy example enforced. But thou art gone! and where [s]hall thy equal be found to [s]upply thy place? Thou wert glorious as the [s]un at his upri[s]ing, mild and beautiful as the beams of the moon, when it dances on the bo[s]om of the lake which the wind gently agitates. In the cha[s]e, fleet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] as the young [s]tag, and the arrow from thy bow never mi[s][s]ed its aim. Thou did[s]t [s]peak, and none could refuse to believe; thou did[s]t command, and none but were eager to obey. The bad loved, whil[s]t they feared thee; the good adored, and endeavoured to imitate thee. Under thy wi[s]e government we re[s]ted in peace, on matts made of ofiers; our wigwams were improved, our bows better [s]trung, our corn was multiplied an hundred fold, and our [s]kins dried with more care. In peace thou wert as the dew of the evening, refreshing and invigorating all who lived beneath thy influence; and in war terrible as the tempe[s]t that breaks the tall pine, roots up the [s]tubborn oak, and makes the fore[s]t tremble, as it ru[s]hes with tremendous fury through it. Thy enemies beheld thee, and fear [s]hook their [s]ouls; thou wert the father of thy people, Oh! valiant [s]achem. But thou art gone---by my hand gone! and where [s]hall thy equal be found to [s]upply thy place?" The numerous affecting images he had called together, whil[s]t [s]peaking the eulogium of the decea[s]ed, had now awakened feelings too powerful to be repressed. The afflictions of his heart bur[s]t forth in loud lamentations. The rage of his countrymen was totally [s]ubdued. They dropped their tomahawks, and joined him in piercing cries and groans, repeating at intervals, "Our chief, our warrior, our friend is gone, and who can [s]upply his place?" Arrabella had not lived [s]o many years in the very bo[s]om of America, at different times obliged to have [s]ome kind of intercour[s]e with the natives, without attaining a con[s]iderable knowledge of their language. She li[s]tened whil[s]t Yankoo was [s]peaking, and as he enumerated the virtues of her [s]on, [s]he felt that, among[s]t the tears of regret that fell for his death, were [s]ome of exultation that he had de[s]erved [s]uch an eulogium, and her heart was con[s]oled. But who can paint the angui[s]h, the di[s]tre[s]s of Rachel, or the di[s]traction of Oberea? When they heard the fatal tidings, they [s]ought the body of their Husband, Brother, Chief. But here nor tears, nor cries [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] declared their [s]orrow. When the [s]oul is too full, language is of little u[s]e. There are no words capable of expre[s][s]ing real affliction. Oberea led her [s]on Reuben (now nearly [s]ix years old) to the bed on which lay the cor[s]e of his father, and pointing to the body, pronounced in a tone deeply mournful, "Behold!" "My father!" [s]aid the boy, and, terrified at his gha[s]tly appearance, cla[s]ped his arms round his mother, and hid his face in her bo[s]om. She [s]eated herself on the [s]ide of the bed, folded her arms round her child, and re[s]ting her head on his [s]houlder, appeared the mute image of de[s]pair. The feelings of Rachel would have been equally poignant, had they not been directed to another channel. She had, as [s]he entered the apartment, faintly articulated the word brother . Arrabella caught the [s]ound, and calling her daughter by name, Rachel was folded in a moment to her bo[s]om, and in the embrace of a new-found mother, felt a relief from her [s]orrows. Dudley ki[s][s]ed his daughter with tenderne[s]s, but the lively affection he had once experienced towards his children was now almo[s]t extinct. It had indeed for a moment revived when he heard the voice of William, but the icy finger of death had [s]ilenced that voice forever, and the heart of Dudley could no more vibrate with the exqui[s]ite delights [s]pringing from paternal love. By the united efforts of Rachel and Arrabella, Oberea was at la[s]t arou[s]ed from that [s]tate of apparent in[s]en[s]ibility into which [s]he had fallen. Rachel released her arms from the neck of her child, and drew her gently towards her mother, who [s]oothed, care[s][s]ed, and called her her dear daughter, the relic of her beloved William. At the name of William, [s]he [s]tarted. Arrabella perceived [s]he had awakened her attention, and from her own [s]on, made a quick tran[s]ition to the [s]on of Oberea. She begged her to call forth her fortitude, to exert the faculties of her mind, and as [s]he loved [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] her hu[s]band, for his [s]ake, live, to protect and in[s]truct his [s]on. "I am his mother," [s]aid [s]he; "have I not rea[s]on to lament the lo[s]s of a [s]on [s]o worthy? But that he was worthy is my comfort.. Had he not a thou[s]and virtues? and will you not [s]trive to live, to teach his [s]on to emulate his father, to be as good, as great, as wi[s]e as he was?" Oberea ca[s]t her eyes on her child, then [s]uddenly covering her face with part of her garments, [s]he wept aloud. The de[s]ired end was now attained. Acute [s]en[s]ibility being relieved by the effu[s]ion, Arrabella was [s]ilent, and leaving nature to its cour[s]e, waited till the fir[s]t rude [s]hock was pa[s]t before [s]he attempted, by reasoning, to convince her of the inutility of grieving. Alas! it was a le[s][s]on (hard as it was) which Arrabella had long [s]ince learnt; but it is what the children of sorrow all learn. Repeated di[s]appointment fir[s]t blunts the keenne[s]s of our feelings; corroding [s]orrow, from overstraining, weakens the chords of [s]en[s]ibility, and at length age and infirmity, creeping by chilling yet almost imperceptible degrees through the whole [s]y[s]tem, totally relaxes every fibre, whil[s]t the heart becomes cold and impenetrable as the ice on the highe[s]t summit of the Andes. The Indians mourned with [s]incerity for their departed [s]achem. The chiefs and elders a[s][s]embled, declared that Reuben, when of a proper age, [s]hould fill the [s]eat of government, till when they entreated Dudley to take the charge of his education. In the mean time, they prepared to inter the remains of their chief, with every mark of re[s]pect and honour. But on the very day when the [s]olemnity was to be performed, the Europeans made an unexpected [s]ally on them, routed the main body, killed many, and took the remainder pri[s]oners. Among[s]t tho[s]e who fell was Yankoo. He fought, defending the hou[s]e where lay the body of William, and died exhorting his companions to conquer or die. Dudley, his wife and daughter, with Oberea and Reuben, were conducted to an Engli[s]h [s]ettlement, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] where the former [s]unk into a [s]tate of debility nearly approaching [s]econd childhood, and in a few months re[s]ted from all his [s]orrows. When this event took place, Arrabella determined to return to England, partly from the hope of her native air acting as a re[s]torative to her health, and partly in the wi[s]h of [s]ecuring to Reuben the e[s]tates of his great-grandfather, Sir Ferdinando Gorges; be[s]ides which, [s]he knew that in Europe [s]he could procure him to be properly educated, which the very imperfect [s]tate of literature in America, at that early period, would not allow her to hope, [s]hould [s]he continue there. Rachel of con[s]equence accompanied her mother; and Oberea, attached to them by every tender tie, would not be left behind. "The mother and the [s]on of my William," [s]aid [s]he, "I will follow to the furthermo[s]t part of the earth." It was early in the [s]pring of 1680, when the widow Arrabella Dudley, her daughter, daughter-in-law and grand[s]on arrived in England, from which [s]he had been ab[s]ent about thirty-four years. Internal feuds and di[s]contents had driven her[s]elf and hu[s]band at fir[s]t from their native land, and the[s]e feuds in [s]ome mea[s]ure [s]till continued. Arrabella found it would be in vain to [s]olicit for any part of the property of Sir Ferdinando. Him[s]elf and family in general had been attached to the royal party, and during the years Dudley had been ab[s]ent from England, the e[s]tates had pa[s][s]ed through [s]o many different hands, that it was almo[s]t impo[s][s]ible to trace them; or could [s]he have done [s]o, [s]he would have found it difficult to make Reuben be received as the heir. His dark complexion, the nature of his father's marriage with Oberea, which in law would have been termed illegal, all militated again[s]t [s]ucce[s]s, [s]hould any [s]uit be commenced again[s]t the pre[s]ent po[s][s]e[s][s]ors; and Arrabella wi[s]ely determined to con[s]ider them as inevitably lo[s]t. She her[s]elf inherited, from the beque[s]t of an aunt, a [s]mall e[s]tate in Lanca[s]hire, and thither [s]he retired, where, devoting one half of its produce to the education of Reuben, [s]he made the other half [s]erve all the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v1&image=329-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] purpo[s]es of life; and this e[s]tate was worth but three hundred pounds per annum. Yet Arrabella was contented, and enjoyed not only the nece[s][s]aries, but the comforts of life. Her own appearance and that of her daughters was always neat, always re[s]pectable; and their countenances ever [s]erene, if not cheerful. But their hands were con[s]tantly employed, and indolence and luxury were alike [s]trangers in their dwelling. A return to her native climate, added to the tranquillity [s]he enjoyed, in a great mea[s]ure re[s]tored the health of the widow Arrabella. Rachel, true to the fir[s]t impul[s]e of her heart, refused to marry, though her beauty and [s]weetne[s]s had attracted many [s]uitors. "I may," [s]he would [s]ay, "find men more accompli[s]hed, who will talk with more eloquence, are more poli[s]hed in their manners; but where [s]hall I find the equal to Yankoo for sincerity?" Rachel preferred a [s]tate of "[s]ingle blessedness." Oberea lived to [s]ee her [s]on attain his twenty-third year, to [s]ee him beloved and re[s]pected by all who knew him; [s]he then fell a victim to an autumnal fever. She had lived beloved, and died univer[s]ally lamented. About eighteen months after the decea[s]e of his mother, Reuben became acquainted with Ca[s][s]iah Penn. Ca[s][s]iah was tall, well [s]haped, not [s]o fair as to be pale, nor dark enough to be termed brown; it was a beautiful mixture of the white ro[s]e and carnation that glowed on her forehead, tinted her cheeks, and gave animation to her dark hazel eyes. Her face, which was elegantly [s]triking, without being regularly beautiful, received much improvement from a few curls of bright che[s]nut hair, which e[s]caped, here and there, from the confinement of a pinched cap (for Ca[s][s]iah was a Quaker.) Reuben [s]aw and loved the fair maiden. An intimacy had taken place between their parents, and by conver[s]ation it was di[s]covered, that the father of Ca[s][s]iah was a de[s]cendant from Beatina Gorges, the younge[s]t daughter of Sir Egbert and Columbia. It was a kind of relation[s]hip that [s]anctified friend[s]hip in [
