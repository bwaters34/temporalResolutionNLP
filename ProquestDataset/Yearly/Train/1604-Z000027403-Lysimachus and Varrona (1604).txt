 of mine interests, ouerrule my thoughts and resolutions, in hazarding the entertainment thereof, at your fauourable courtesie, and construction. And if I may perceiue that your Lordship affoords the countenance, to grace my papers with the demonstration, of the extreamest degree of good liking, I shall be emboldned to raise my Muses note, that now yeelds harsh musick, to an higher key, a fairer fruite, of my better ordered vacant houres, and manifest my dutie to your Honour, in some matter of greater import, then a superficiall toy. But fearing to grow offensiue through tediousnes, I commit this simple work to your Lordships patronage, and your Honour to the Almighties protection: for the preseruation of which, I will pray continually. I ende. Your Lordships most firmely deuoted in all seruiceable endeuours. I. H. worke attempted to winne your fauours, but to discouer mine own ignorance, in that raunging in a large field of copious matter, and being engulphed in an Ocean of conceit, I lye there ouerwhelmed. If my methode be nothing pleasant, yet presuming vpon your curtesies, I doubt not but you will smoother it vp with patience: and the vertue of your affectio I trust will stand in the front as a strog fort of defence, to shield me from the descanting verdits of such vnfriendly Readers, which conceiting the Authors entent amisse, may wrest his meaning by wrong coiectures: and from the sowre censures of the ouer-curious Moralists of our age, which glory to be tearmed the new vprearers of the long agoe confuted Stoicall Apathy . Howsoeuer the case standeth, I looke for no praise for my labour, but pardon for my good will: it is the greatest reward that I dare aske, and the least which may be offered: I desire no more, I deserue no lesse. Thus Gentlemen, committing these my labors to your friendly view, and submitting my selfe to your curteous censures, I end: wishing to you all seuerall good fortunes. Farewell. I. H. R.  Take but this simple trauaile in your view, As in a mirrour there is deeply taught, The wanton vices of proud fancies crew: There is depainted by most curious art, How loue and folly iumpe in euery part. This little Pamphlet more conceit combines, Then wanton Ouid in his art did paint: And sharper Satyres are within his lines, Then Martiala sung proud Venus to attaint. Sith then his art doth plainly yeeld such gaines, Read it, and thanke the Author for his paines. Ro. Bacchus.  Make Coronets of Floraes proudest flowers, As gifts for him, for he must haue the praise, And taste the deawes that high Parnassus shewers: As hauing leapt beyond old Ouids straine, In taunting Louers for their fruitlesse paine. Tho: Talkinghame , Gentleman. Syllanus Duke of Hypata in Thessalia . In Thessalia , when Nature hath made the soyle proude with the beawtie of Floras riches, as though she meant to wrap Teilus in the glorie of her vestments, there dwelled a Magnifico , a man of most honorable parentage, whome Fortune had graced with many fauours, and Nature honoured with sundrie exquisite qualities, so beawtified with the excellencie of both, as it was a question whether Fortune or Nature were more prodigall in desciphering the riches of their bounties. This Knight thus enricht with vertue and honour, surnamed Syllanus , had to ioy him in his age a daughter of great beawtie, so exquisite in her exteriour feature, as no blemish might eclipse that which Nature had bestowed in her lineaments. This Damsell whose name was Varrona , dayly vsed to trauerse the plaines wherein her fathers sheepe were kept, partly to preuent inconueniences which through idlenesse might haue annoyed her health, and partlie to ply the care of her fathers folds: (for she knew that the eyes of the maister feedes the cattell) which with such diligence was performed, as that she seemed with labour to enter armes against want, and with her hands thrift to preoccupate her hearts griefe. Using thus dayly the walks of Thessalia , the Shepheards not a little delighted at the view of so excellent an obiect, held their eyes fortunate when they might behold her feature, accounting him happie that could lay his flocks neerest vnto her walks. Amongst these that fed their thoughts on her fauours, there was one called Lysimachus , a yong youth, that had the pride of his yeeres triumphing in his countenance, a man, whose parentage though it were worshipfull, yet was it not indued with much wealth, insomuch that his wit was better then his reuenewes, and his industrie more beneficiall then his substance. This Lysimachus trauailing amongst the lawnes, no sooner had a glaunce of her beawtie, but set downe his staffe, resoluing either to perish in so sweete a laborinth, or in time happily to stumble out with Theseus: In which extasie he shall remaine, till we haue described the cause why he left Macedonia his natiue countrey, and the perilous euents which hapned during his voyage hither into Thessalia . This youth was one of the sonnes of Alexandro , who hauing passed the prime of his youth in sundry battailes against Astolpho king of Lydia , at last (as the date of time hath his course) grew aged, his haires were siluer hewed, and the map of his age was figured on his forehead, in such sort, as that all men might perceiue his glasse was run, and that nature of necessitie challenged her due. Alexandro that knewe the tearme of his life was now expired, hauing two sonnes by his wife Olympias , the very pride of his forepassed yeeres, thought now, seeing death by constraint would compell him to leaue them, with wholesome admonitions and louing perswasions for the increasing of their ensuing amitie, to distribute in their portions the substance of his wealth for the countercheck of pouertie. All which being done, to the end that they might not forget his axioms, he gaue them a scroule, wherein they might reade what their father dying, willed them to execute liuing. At which Alexandro shrunke downe in his bed, and gaue vp the ghost. Whose death was greatly lamented of his two sonnes, and bewayled of all his friends, especially of his fellow warriours, who attended on his funerals, which were performed with great solemnities. His obsequies done, Valentine caused his Epitaph, with the contents of the scrowle to be pourtrayed out, which were to this effect. 1 Let Gods worship be your mornings worke, and his wisedome the direction of your dayes labour. --- 2 Rise not without thanks, neither sleepe without repentance. 3 Choose but a few friends, and try those, for the flatterer speakes fairest. 4 If you haue discreet wiues, make them your Secretaries, else lock your thoughts in your hearts, for women are seldome silent. 5 If they be faire, be not iealous, for suspition cures not womens follies. 6 If they be wise, wrong them not: for if they loue others, they will loath you. 7 Let your childrens nurture be their richest portion: for wisedome is more precious then wealth. 8 Be not proud amongst your poore neighbours: for a poore mans hate is perillous. 9 Nor too familiar with great men: for presumption wins disdaine. 10 Neither too prodigall in your fare, nor dye indebted to your bellies, enough is a feast. 11 Be not enuious, least ye fall in your owne imaginations. 12 Vse patience, mirth, and quiet: for care is an enemy to health. Valentine hauing thus set vp his schedule, & hangd about his fathers coffin many passionat poems, that al Macedonia might suppose him to be passing sorrowfull, clad himselfe and his younger brother Lysimachus all in blacke, and in such sable suites discoursed his griefe: But as the Hiena when she mournes is most guilefull, so Valentine vnder the shew of dolour shadowed his heart full of contented thoughts: The Tyger though he hide his clawes, will at last discouer his rapine: The Lions looke are not the maps of his meaning, nor a mans phisnomie the display of his secrets. Fire cannot be hid in straw, nor the nature of a man so conceald, but at last it will haue his course: nature and arte may do much, but that Natura naturans which by purgation is engraffed in the heart, will be at last perforce predominant. Euen thus and no otherwise fared it with Valentine , for after a quarter of a yeeres lamentation was ended, he entred into consideration how he might extort from his yonger brother the substance bequeathed him by his father, if not defraud him vtterly of his due, yet make such hauock of his legacie, as it should be a great deale the lighter, whereupon he began thus to meditate with himselfe. Now Valentine , loue and fortune haue brought thee into a Laborinth, thy thoughts are like Ianus pictures, that present both peace and warre, and thy mind like Venus anuile, where is hammered both feare and hope. Sith then the chance lyeth in thy owne choice, do not with Medea see and allow of the best, and then follow the worst; but of two extreames, if they be Immediata , choose that which may haue least preiudice  & most profit: intreate thy brother in fauours, and entertaine him with loue, so shalt thou haue thy conscience cleere, and thy renowne excellent. Tush, what words are these, far vnfit (if thou be wise) for thy honour. What though thy father at his death talked many friuolus matters, as one that doated for age, and raued in his sicknes, shall his words be so authenticall, as thou wilt in obseruing them preiudice thy selfe? No, no, sick mens wils that are paroll, hauing no hand or seale, are like the lawes of a Citie written in dust, which are broken with the blast of euery wind. What man, thy father is dead, and he can neither help thy fortunes, nor measure thy actions, therefore burie his words with his carkasse, and be wise for thy selfe: what, tis not so old as true, Non sapit, qui sibi non sapit But vnhappie Valentine , whither doest thou roue? Do thy vertues increase like the pace of a Crab, who creepeth backward? Hast thou in the cradle bin continent, and wilt thou in the saddle be impudent? Now I see, that albeit vertue hath bridled thy youth with chast thoughts, yet vanitie hath inchanted thy yeeres with fond resolutions, resembling the Nettle, which may be handled in the bud, but stingeth in the flower: Art thou so well skild alreadie in thy fathers precepts, as that thou meanest to buy folly and cheapen repentance? Are not we sonnes of one father, siens of one tree, birds of one nest? and wilt thou become so vnnaturall as to rob him, whom especiallie thou oughtest to relieue? Did not thy father tell thee, that brothers amitie is like the drops of Balsamum , that salueth most dangerous sores? Did he exhort vnto concord, and wilt thou shew thy selfe carelesse? Fie vpon these friuolous words, which rather then they should in such sort be preiudiciall vnto my prosperitie, as detaine me from raigning sole Lord ouer all my fathers possessions, I would not onely in forswearing the remembrance of them, violate naturall affection, but with mine owne hands worke my vtter confusion: for loth would I be depriued of so triumphant an expectation. In this humour Valentine left his Chamber, vowing the performance of these diuellish resolutions. Thus for two or three dayes being very pensiue, and full of many passions, it chanced that as he walked thus in his muses, fetching the compasse of his conceit beyond the Moone, he met with two beggerly fellowes, who as their custome was, began their Exordium with I pray good Maister, and so forth, hoping to finde the Gentleman as liberall, as he was full of gratious fauours: neither did they misse of their imagination, for he thought them likely to be drawne on to the execution of his purpose, conceipted thus, that gold was as good as glew to knit them to any practise whatsoeuer, and therefore out with his purse  & greased the in the hands with a brace of angels. This vnaccustomed reward made the more franck of curtesies, that euery rag reacht the Gentleman a reuerence, with promise of many prayers for his health. He that harped on another string tooke ye men by the hands, & sitting down vpo the greene grasse, discourst vnto them fro point to point the beginning of his sorrowes, & how by no meanes (except by them) he could rest satisfied. The beggers desirous to do the Gentleman any pleasure, said they were readie to take any paines that might redound to his content, whereupon he replied thus. Then my good friends, ye shall run into yonder towne (pointing to Idomena ) making solemne exclamations that if present remedy be not adhibited, there will be no question but that the destruction of a certaine person in this wood wil be vnfallible, being sorely opprest by a desperat ruffian: if ye can cunningly  & closely thus conuay vnto the officers the tenour of your minds, I will so highly gratifie you, as neuer afterwards ye shalbe found to exercise your old occupation. These hell-hounds glad of this large proffer, promised to venter a ioynt, but they would further him in his enterprise: whereupon he dispatcht them away, whose minds were so fixed on this liberall condition, that they bestirred their stumps till they came vnto the towne: where notice of their aduertisement being taken, assisted by the Magistrate they made to ye wood: who no sooner were come within the reach of Valentines eye, but puffing & blowing, as though all would haue split againe, he posted vnto them, charging the vpon their alleageance they bore to their soueraigne Lord their King, that they should not spare to execute the rigour of the lawe vpon his brother, who esteeming gold sufficient honour, became so deafe against my fathers philosophicall harmonie, and made more value of profit then of vertue, as to the end that he might strip me out of my possessions, came rushing in, and laid such violent hands vpon me, as had not the sight of your approaching hither terrified his vnnaturall stratagem, he had ere this bereaued me of life. Whereupon seeing his notorious villanie which so long lay hid in the ashes of pretended simplicitie, thus discouered, and after this sort detected, for his better securitie betooke himselfe to his heeles, whome if you follow downe along this vale towards my house, he cannot possiblie escape your hands. Fortune that saw how Lysimachus valewed not her deitie, but held her power in scorne, thought to haue about with him, and brought the matter to passe thus. Lysimachus as his vsuall maner was, walked before his brothers house in a valley betweene two high mountaines (topt with trees of maruellous verdure, whereby ran a fountaine pleasant, as well for the murmur of the streames, as for the sweetnes of waters) with his Boare-speare vpon his neck, where hauing stroken a Deere, and but lightly hurt, he packed downe by the groue in great haste expecting his fall: from whence he might espie his brother accompanied with a crue of armed men following him: amazed at this sight, as he stoode gazing, his nose on a sodaine bled, which made him coniecture (as it was indeede) that there was some dangerous euent pretended. As soone as they were come within his reach, Valentine commanded the officers without further examination, to carry him to prison. Lysimachus smiling both at the enuious treacherie, and cowardize of his brother, brookt all the iniuries of fortune with patience. Lying in prison all night, the next morning as soone as the day brake, taking a Cytterne in his hand, he warbled out this mournefull Sonnet. That wrap my ioyes in folds of endlesse woes, Tire on my heart, and wound it with your spight, Since Time and Fortune prooues my vtter foes. Farewell my hopes, farewell my happie dayes, Welcome sweet griefe, the subiect of my layes. Mourne heauens, mourne earth, your seruant is forlorne, Mourne times, and howers, since bale inuades by bowre, Curse euery tongue, the place where I was borne, Curse euery thought, the life which makes me lowre. Farewell my hopes, farewell my happie dayes, Welcome sweet griefe the subiect of my layes. Yet drooping, and yet liuing to this death, I sigh, I sue for pittie at his ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) at the Lord of hostes,   ] shrine, Whose mightie power can quicklie comfort breath, And make my selfe thus not in woes to pine. Farewell my hopes, farewell my happie dayes, Welcome sweet griefe the subiect of my layes. Meane while my sighes yeeld truce vnto my teares, By them the winds increase and fiercely blow: Yet when I sigh the griefe more plaine appeares, And by their force with greater power doth glow. Farewell my hopes, farewell my happie dayes, Welcome sweet griefe the subiect of my layes. Fortiter ille facit qui miser esse potest. Hauing thus chaunted ouer his Sonnet, he heard the prison doore open, whereupon he grew passing melancholie, and not without cause, for the Iayler certified him that the Burgomasters of the towne were assembled in the common hall, to heare how he could cleere himselfe of the accusations which were laid to his charge. At this Lysimachus taking heart of grace, being imboldned with his innocencie, he boldlie went with the officers vnto the hall, with whom (as the nature of man is desirous of nouelties) came a great prease of people to heare the matter throughlie canuased. When Lysimachus was thus brought before the barre, Valentine his brother who had suborned these retchles roagues solemlie to depose that they saw him preiudicially bent, began his inuectiue thus. I am sory graue citizens and inhabitants of Idomena , that this day I am come to accuse my brother Lysimachus , whose vertues hitherto haue woon him many fauours and the outward shew of his good qualities hath been highlie applauded of all men: but my conscience constraineth me, not to conceale such hainous sinne, and the rigour of the law chargeth me not to smother vp so great an offence without rebuke. This considered, I am forced to discouer a wicked deede that this Lysimachus hath committed, and that is this. It chanced (as I walked solitarie downe my woods to see if any of my Ewes and Lambs (as it is my ordinarie custome) were stragled downe to the strond to browze on sea Iuie, whereof they take especiall delight to feede) that my brother hauing concealed a secret resolution of some desperat plot, and could no longer hide fire in the flaxe, nor oyle in the flame (for enuie is like lightning that will appeare in the darkest fog) and seeing now opportunitie answerable to the performance of a mischiefe, thought best not to let it slip, but assaulted me with such violence, redoubling his stroakes with such courage, that had not the arriuall of the officers been speedie, my death had been sodaine. For proofe hereof, these men (pointing to the beggars) shall heere before you all make present deposition, and with that he reacht them a Bible, whereon being sold vnto sinne, and sworne to wickednes, they swore that Lysimachus was most preiudicially bent. At which oath the people that were Iurors in the cause, belieuing the protestations of Valentine , and the depositions of the roages, presentlie found him guiltie, and Valentine and the rest of the Burgomasters gaue iudgement, that he should the next day at the Market place loose his head. As soone as Lysimachus heard the censure, he appeald for no mercy, nor abasht any whit, as one desirous of fauour, but lifting vp his eyes to heauen, only said thus. O God, which seest the secrets of all hearts,  & knowest all things before they come to passe, which discernest the very inward thoughts, and triest the hearts & reines: Thou knowest that my brother hath slandered me with a crime , whereof I was neuer guiltie, that he hath produced these two men by a sinister subornation to periure themselues in a fault, whereas not so much as in thought, I committed such a fact; he hath to satisfie his malitious mind, without cause deuised this false crime. I confesse O Lord my selfe to be a most grieuous offender, and to deserue far greater punishment; but not for this deede. Heare then my prayer, and let the innocencie of my case pleade before thy diuine maiestie: if it be thy will preuent his practises, confound his counsels, and let him which hath digged the pit for others, fall into the snare himselfe. Thou hast neuer as yet o Lord left the succourlesse without help, but hast deliuered them which feare thee, from all aduersitie. Nay, who hath trusted in thy mercie, which hath come to mishap or who hath put his hope in thee, and hath suffered harme? So o Lord if it be thy will, thou canst disclose the deuise of this my brother Valentine , and vnfold the follies of these false witnesses, help thou  o Lord, for in thee is my trust . The peeple hearing the solemne protestations of sorrowful Lysimachus , thought he had spoken these words to excuse his fault, but not that he was guiltlesse of the fact, giuing more credit to the speeches of Valentine , and to the oathes of the men countenanced out by the Bourgomasters , then to the yeares of a yong man, supposing his speeches were more of custome to choake his follies, then of conscience to cleare himselfe of that crime, returned him backe againe to prison, till the day assigned for his punishment. Where beeing deeply grieued, and yet smothering his sorrowes with patience, he lay the rest of the day. When night was come, Fortune that was carefull of her champion began to smile, and brought it so to passe, that as Lysimachus was walking vp the battlements of the Castell wherein hee was prisoner, he espied from whence he might leape downe without hurt, and so escape away with securitie. Glad of this as a man most valiant, and trusting to his fortunes, couragiouslie skipt downe with little preiudice, which being performed, he trudged amaine to the sea shore, where boording a Foist which by chance there lay at Ancour, hee hoised vp Sayle, as hauing the winds somewhat benigne, purposing thither to direct his course, whither Fortune and Æ olus would conduct him, whom for a while we will leaue, and returne againe to Valentine . The morrow was the day of punishment, and Valentine was so desirous to see the execution performed, that he passed the night with little sleepe: but as soone as Phoebus had vayled the curtaine of the night, and made Aurora blush with giuing her the Bezolas labras in her siluer couch, he got him vp, and dispatcht an officer to the Iaylor to produce his prisoner to execution, who returned him this answere, Non est inuentus . This newes draue Valentine into a great melancholie, that presentlie he went to the Sheriffes, giuing them to vnderstand of this information, whose hearts were so set on fire, that they straight raised all the countrie, and made hue and crie after him. But Lysimachus knowing full well the secret wayes that led vnto the sea coast, stole away priuilie through a part of the Prouince of Mygdonia , and escaped safe to the sea. Valentine seeing himselfe thus brought into a fooles paradize, despairing of his brothers recouerie, as a man carelesse what should become of him, tooke horse and rode home, where he trusted (seeing the stop was remoued which galled him to the quicke) to end the currant of his yeeres in all contented quietnes: hauing heaued vp to promotion those two vassailes of sinne, whose lamentable fortunes, together with the principall member, shall at large hereafter be declared. These vnexpected accidents compelled Lysimachus to leaue his natiue countrie Macedonia , and in forreine places to purchase more fauourable fortunes, with whome, wee will nowe begin. Lysimachus hauing for the space of three or foure dayes sayled without descrying land, sole Lord ouer the vessell, as hauing none to comfort him, at last he might discouer the coast of Thessalia , whereon (as a man ioyfull of land) he was cast: vpon which fastening the Pinnice, he chanced on a path that led into the thick of a Forrest, where wandring without meate, he was almost famished, at last hunger growing on so extreame, like a mad man he ranged vp and downe the woods, seeking to encounter some wilde beast with a Iauelin which he made at his entrance into the thicket. He had not gone far, but he espied a Shepheard, desirous therefore to be relieued by his fauours, he saluted him thus. Shepheard, for so far thy attire warrants me: courteous, for so much thy countenance imports: if a distressed person whom fortune hath wronged, and the seas haue fauoured (if I may count it fauour to liue and want) may without offence craue so far ayd, as to know some place where to rest my wearie and weather-beaten bones, thanks thou shalt haue as thy due, and more thou canst not haue, for my abilities deny me to perfourme a deeper debt. But if any wayes it please thee to command me, vse me as far as the power of a poore Gentleman will stretch. The Shepheard hearing him speake so grauely, made him this answere. Stranger, your degree I know not, therefore pardon if I giue lesse title then your estate meriteth: Fortunes frownes are Princes fortunes, and Kings are subiect to chance and destinie. Mishap is to be salued with pittie, not with scorne, and we that are fortunes darlings are bound to relieue them that are in distresse: therefore follow me, and you shall haue such succour as a Shepheard may affoord. Lysimachus was passing glad and Procyon (for so was the Shepheards name) led the way, who being desirous to infer some occasion of parly, began his prattle thus. If thou be a man of such worth as I valew thee by thy exteriour lineaments, make discourse vnto me what is the cause of thy present misfortunes, for by the furrowes in thy face thou seemest to be crost with mishaps: but whatsoeuer or whosoeuer, let me craue that fauour to heare the tragick cause of thy estate. Lysimachus seeing by the Shepheards lookes that he was desirous to heare the discourse of his fortunes, briefly shaped him this replie. In that your lookes sees my griefe, and your thoughts pittie my woes, my tongue shall giue you thanks (the bountie of sorrowes tennant) and my heart pray that the gods may be as friendlie to your flocks, as you are fauourable vnto me. How I arriued here gentle Shepheard inquire not, least it be tedious for thee to heare it, and a double griefe for me to rehearse it. Procyon not willing to occasionate offence, as hauing affection pourtrayed in his visage, he conueyed him home to his house, as soone as he was arriued there, he began at the doore to entertaine him thus. Sir, this is my cottage wherein I liue content, and your lodging, where (please it you) you may rest quiet. I haue no rich clothes of Æ gipt to couer the walls, nor store of plate to discouer any wealth, for Shepheards vse neither to be proud nor couetous. You shall find heere cheese and milke for dainties, and wooll for clothing, in euery corner of the house Content sitting smiling, and tempering euery homely thing with a welcome: this if you can brooke and accept of (as allow the meanest hospitalitie) you shall haue such fare as Philemon & Baucis gaue to Iuppiter. Lysimachus thankt him hartily, and going into his house found what he promised. After that he had sat a litle by the fire & well warmed him, he went to supper, where Lysimachus fed well, as one whom the sea had made hungrie, and so plied his teeth that all supper he spake not one word. After he had taken his repast, Procyon seeing him wearie, and that sleepe chimed on to rest, let him see his lodging, and so gaue him the good night. The Sunne was no sooner the next morning stept from the bed of Aurora but the Shepheard got him vp and went to his folds, where letting foorth his sheepe, after he had espied where they should graze, he returned home, and looking when his guest should rise, hauing slept ill the last night, went roundlie to his breakefast: by that time he had ended his de suine , Lysimachus was gotten vp, against whose rising Odrisa Procyons wife had shewne her cookerie, and the Shepheard tired in his russet iacket, no sooner had espied his guest comming out of his Chamber but bade him good morrow, with a looke not so much vnfeigned as affectionate: whom after breakefast was ended, Procyon led foorth to see his folds, plodding thus ouer the greene fields, at last they came to the mountaines where his flocks grazed, and there he discoursed vnto him the pleasures of a countrie life, thus. Did you but (Sir) liue a while in this condition, you would say the Court were rather a place of sorrow then of solace. Here shall not fortune thwart you, but in meane misfortunes, as the losse of a few Sheepe, which as it breedes beggerie, so it can be no extreame preiudice, the next yeare may mend all with a fresh increase. We drinke without suspition, and sleepe without care, enuie stirres not vs, we couet not to climbe, our desires mount not aboue our degrees, nor our thoughts aboue our fortunes. Care (as I said) cannot harbour in our cottages, nor do our homely couches know broken slumbers: as we exceede not ill diet, so we haue enough to satisfie. The Shepheard made Lysimachus so much in loue with the countrie life, that euery day he led foorth his flocks with such delight, that he held his exile happie, and thought no content to the blisse of a countrie cottage. Lysimachus vsing thus daylie with bag and bottle to goe a field in more pleasant content of minde then euer he was in his owne countrie with Valentine his brother, it chanced on a day being inforced by the heate of the Sunne to seeke for shelter, as he sate vnder the shadow of Limon trees, fortune (who is like the Camelion) variable with euery obiect, and constant in nothing but in inconstancie, thought to make him a mirrour of mutabilitie, and therfore still crost him contrarilie. Thinking to recouer his cottage, it fell out that certaine rascalls (who after they had forraged in the Thessalian confines) espying Lysimachus , and taking a generall suruey of his extraordinarie lineaments, thought that he was very like for the performance of some bold attempt, and in time of necessitie no small assistance vnto their enterprises: wherevpon thus resolued, they came rushing in, and laid violent hands vpon him, who seeing that all hope of libertie should be taken away if he yeelded, thought rather to die in his owne defence, then any way be depriued of such an especiall priuiledge, and therefore dealt such blowes amongst them with his weapon, as he did witnesse well vpon their carcases that he was no coward. But as ne Hercules quidem contra deos , so Lysimachus could not resist a multitude, hauing none to second him: so that he was not only batted, but sore wounded, and to be briefe perforce hoysed a Ship-boord, where for the space of a day or two being with the Pirates carried into the huge Ocean, at length the Fates setting downe in their Sinode to make Lysimachus happie, ordered so the matter, that maugre their beards (by a tempest which sodainely arose) they were cast againe vpon the borders of Thessalia . This aduerse wind fatally sent for the purchasing of Lysimachus enfranchisement continued thus contrarie three moneths, the violence whereof, with the strange accidents that during the continuance thereof befell, I referre to the Annales of the Thessalians , which dilate not a little of it. These Pirates thus by a stormie constreint being sore against their wills compelled to lye quiet at rode, at length through long continuance necessitie began to haue eminencie, swaying all things with a check, and constraining them as tributorie to yeeld the soueraignetie vnto her supremacie. Whilest thus they were taxed with want, they bethought themselues how that the present season exacted a warme coate, and a hot chimney, and therefore deemed it not vnbehoueable, if by the diligece of two or three, that want might be supplied. Which being concluded, our weather-beaten souldier Lysimachus was inioyned (seeming that way desirous) to adde in that exploit his indulgece: who putting vp all abuses with patience by the outward appearance, seemed so content with that present codition, as that little mistrust of reuenge in him was perceiued. Well, being come into the wood, Lysimachus thinking it hie time to put in triall the assay of his redemption, heaued vp a forrest bill which he had on his neck, and the first he stroke, had neuer after more neede of the Phisition, charging his blowes with such magnanimitie, that the slaues were amazed at his valour, so yt in short time he had slain two,  & left the third in such sort sore wounded, as that there was none or very litle hope of his recouerie. Hauing rid his hands of these his welwillers, he had not so much care of executing his iniunction, as he had of escaping away with safetie, which as he performed with great diligence, so it wrought his future contented happines. The Pirates after long expectation waited (but all in vaine) for the returne of their adherents, whom when they perceiued that euery houre they were more slack in hastening homewards, misdoubted (and not amisse) least some vnexpected casualtie might befall them, which when by their arriuall in that place they found true, seeing Lysimachus was absent, imagined that through his meanes these horrible deedes were brought to passe, but not daring to make pursuit after him, for feare of leaping ouer the shooes in transgressions, they rested patient, bearing vnto their galley three dead carkases (for by this time the suruiuer had yeelded nature her due) to solemnize their funeralls with a watrie buriall: what afterward betead of the I cease to relate, in that I neither esteeme the persons, nor valew their actions. By this time Lysimachus was come within the view of his host Procyons cottage, vnto which he made with such celeritie, as the recouerie thereof was speedie: being entred, he found the Shepheard and his wife at dinner, whome after this manner he saluted. Gentle Shepheard, and courteous, tempered with the beautie of affabilitie, and the lineaments of thy face graced with the fauours of clemency, as many good fortunes to you and your wife, as your selues can desire or imagin. Procyon hearing one so superfine, looking backward perceiued that it was his guest Lysimachus , whom (sodainly rising from the table) he entertained with as many fauours, as he tollerated his absence with dolours, whereupon he tooke him by the hand, and bade him welcome, willing him to sit downe in his place, and in his roome not only to eate his fill, but as Lord of the house to thinke himselfe welcome: well, to be short, he fell eagerly to his victuals, and feasted himselfe with such cates as they had. As soone as he had victualled the campe, the Shepheard and his wife were desirous to heare what hard fortune compelled him to be so long absent, requested Lysimachus to discourse (if it were not any wayes preiudiciall vnto him) the cause of his so long discontinuance. Lysimachus (desirous to satisfie the courtesie of his fauorable host, first beginning his Exordium with a volee of sighes, and a few luke-warme teares) prosecuted his discourse, and throughlie informed them of his misfortunes, how as he was sitting vnder a couert most pleasantlie scituated, which with the thicknes of the boughes so shadowed the place, that Phoebus could not prie into that arbour, so vnited were the tops of so thick a closure, that Venus there in her iollitie might haue dallied vnseene with her deerest paramour. Fast by to make the place more gorgeous, was there a Font, so Christaline and cleere, that it seemed Diana with her Driades and Hemadriades had that spring as the secret of their bathings. In this glorious arbour (I say) as I sate, it chanced that certaine rascalls comming a bootehailing into those parts discouered me, being discouered, haled me on ship-boord, whither being haled, I had iourneyed with them had not the winds in being more fauorable forbad our course with their prosperous opposition. Lying thus still (quoth he) two moneths, at length necessitie grew powerfull amongst vs, which willed vs with labour to supplie those things that else by propagation would be perilous, whereupon my selfe with three more being charged to vndergo this enterprise, I supposed it not amisse being in a desert place, if I made hay while the Sunne shined, and tooke opportunitie by the forelocks, and thereupon betooke my selfe to my weapon, minding in this resolution either to escape away with safetie, or valiantly to die immediately, rather then I would be returned back and kept in such seruile subiection, as though I were the sonne of some countrie vassaile, from whom as you see I am deliuered, and that with little preiudice. When Procyon heard this he fell on the neck of Lysimachus , being exceeding ioyfull for his safe arriuall, being thereto moued by reason that (for sundrie vertues which he sawe shine in his honest simplicitie) he loued him exceedingly, and tooke an intimate delight in his company: wherefore with these words of true friendship he did embrace him. Lysimachus , let not thy brothers vnkindnes which thou hast felt, the inclemencie of thy kinne that I doubt hereafter thou shalt finde, nor the miseries whatsoeuer thou hast either passed, or doest endure, further appale thy spirit, then may be recouered by thy friends comfort. Thou knowest how deerely I haue held thee, and what care euer since thy first sight I receiued of thy well doing, I had rather in action make knowne my loue, then in words but wearie thy hearing: and albeit my abillitie cannot counteruaile my desire, yet in affection I will not be wanting any wayes vnto you. Lysimachus in a suddaine passion surprised with this rare piece of friendship, after the recouerie of a little traunce, yeelded him most humble thanks: adding moreouer, that if euer fortune tyed her fauours in the top of his crest, he would not wound the remembrance of these his extraordinarie courtesies with obliuion. Resting thus in the house with the shepheard, to auoyd tedious conceits, he framed himselfe so to countrie labours, that he oft times would leade the flockes to the field himselfe, and being drest in homely attire, seemed like amorous Paris courting Oenone . Neere to this place dwelt the aboue-named Gentleman Syllanus , of great worship, greater possessions, but of greatest perfections, so that it was doubted, whether he was more indebted to his parents for petigree, to nurture for pietie, or to fortune for prosperitie, yet most chiefly he thought himselfe beholden to Nature, that had in his decaying yeeres, and decrepit old age, bestowed on him so precious a pearle and deere iewell as his yong daughter Varrona , admired at that time as the onely Paragon and Phoenix of Thessalia : which thing this good old sire perceiuing, made him as carefull to breede her, as ioyfull that she was borne, thinking within himselfe that as she was notable for her beautie, so should she be noted for her honestie: and seeing Nature had inuested her with so pleasing a personage, Nurture should not denie her as plausible behauiour, and that she should be as sweete in manners, as seemely in making, which through his diligent performance afterwards came to passe. This Varrona was the very picture and patterne of incomparable comelinesse, the perfect peece in whom nature played her prize against arte, and in whome her silent oratorie pleaded both for pricke and price. This Paragon seemed to surpasse the perfection of the rest amongst whom she was sorted, and amongst whome she shined as an orient pearle opposite to pebles, or Cynthias golden beames obscuring the twinckling starres: None erst looked on her, but loued her. Her stature was tall, and her golden wiered tresses wherewith her comely head abounded, were infolded with Unions and Onches, with Diamonds and Chrysolites, sauing some lawlesse locks amongst the rest hung loosely adoring her temples, being all prettily frisled, crisped, and tusked. In her high forehead wherein no wrinckle appeared, Cupid had placed his Iuorie Bowe, on which her iollie eye-browes resembled Venus , beautified by the neere opposition of her black bearded Vulcan . What shall I stand in describing her eyes, those celestiall lamps, or her cheekes like damaske roses sprinkled with morning deaw? in whose dimples were the Graces dwellings? What shall I recount her corall, daintie chinne, and allablaster neck? each part deserued praise, each member admiration. In sweete eloquence she resembled Cornelia: her lookes were chearefull, yet chaste: merrie, yet modest: courteous, not contemptuous. Hercules Gallus had all mens eares linked in the chaine which he held in his hand, but Varrona held both their eares, tongues, and hearts, all men pratled of her, all praysed her. First, gazed they at the heauenlie hewe of her beautie, then at the excellencie of her brauerie, then wondred they at the rarenesse of her courtesie, then they admired her passing good graces, then were they amazed at the specialitie of her fine behauiour, the the twinckling of her eies did so dimme their lesser lights, that they could neither sustaine to behold her, or abstaine fro beholding her. This Uirgin, or rather Goddesse, euery day vsed to view the plaines wherein her fathers sheepe were kept (as it hath bene alreadie mentioned) in a skarlet peticoate, defending her face from the heate of the Sunne, with no other vaile, but with a garland made of boughes and flowers: which attire became her so gallantly, as that she seemed to be the Goddesse Flora her selfe for beautie. On a day as Lysimachus sat amongst the shrubs, by chance fixing his eies on the glorious obiect of her face, he noted her tresses in such sort, that whereas heretofore he was a contemner of Venus , was now by the wilie shaft of Cupid so intangled in the perfectio & beauteous excellencie of Varrona , as now he swore no benigne Planet but Venus , no God but Cupid , no exquisite Deitie but Loue. Being thus fettered with the pliant perswasions of fancie, impatient in his new affections, as the horse that neuer before felt the spurre, he could not bridle his new conceiued amours, but before he came to Procyons house where daily he did continue, he endured such a Metamorphosis in his mind, that he was constrained to crosse himselfe with these or the like contrarieties. But stay: what newe motions are these Lysimachus ? what heauie conceits, what dumpish thoughts possesse thee? what strange and vnacquainted fits disquiet thee? what furie, what fiend torments thee? by whome, where, when did it come Lysimachus ? Ah Varrona, Varrona , heauenlie Varrona , and nothing but Varrona! why how now? hast thou so long escaped the snares of beautie, and must thou now tast of the baite? hast thou gazed on so many faces, & none but this could fit thy fancie? accompanied heretofore so many gallants, yet none could please thee? descried so many behauiours, viewed so many vertues, and none could delight thee, none could entice thee? yea but stay Lysimachus , runne not too fast, least thou loose thy breath: wade not too farre sith thou art sure to sinke: yeeld not to loue, as thou louest thy life: kill it in the roote, or breake it in the bud, beware of the blossome, as thou tenderest thy safetie. Thou hast bene alwaies accompted the despiser of fancie, and wilt thou now be noted the desirer of beautie? thou which hast trod Venus vnder thy feete, wilt thou wrap therein thy heart? earst reiecting them as sluttish ragges, and now regarding them as the garments of a Goddesse? But Varrona , Oh sweete Varrona , the very patterne of Uertue, beauties liuely grace, the onely Idea of Iupiters dreame, and paragon of natures perfection. By this time he was come home, and casting himselfe immediately on his bed, on a suddein started as one in an extasie, surprised with the notable view of some rare singularitie, or drowned as it were in a deepe sea of surpassing delight, and wholy contemplating the substance of Varrona , which he alreadie most curiously had shadowed in his heart, he began to fall into a slumber, but loue impatient of delaies and controlment, bestowed a sharpe arrow vpon him to aggrauate his sore that alreadie was vncurable, which made him with a new supplie redouble his griefs, with this passionate part. I see there is no stopping of the streame, but to force the greater flowing: no killing the vine by cuting it: the repressing of Cupids rage, is the more to kindle affection. Ah cursed Cupid , ah vniust dieitie, the restrainer of libertie, the maister of follie, the ouerthrow of honestie, a ruine of youth, an arch nemie to the whole world: hast thou none to pricke, none to poison, but poore Lysimachus ? then would I he were not Lysimachus , or else as he hath bene Lysimachus . But alas must I needs shake hands with libertie, and bid freedome farewell, must my quiet weale become a malecontented warre? must my pleasures be passions, my songs sighes and sobs, my mirth melancholy, my moderate thoughts amorous conceits? Then farewell discretion where desire dwelleth: farewell wit, if will beare sway: and farewell counsaile, if loue be the Lawier. But why doest thou argue with loue, seeing thou hast not thy loue? assay rather to enioy thy loue, so that any way thou maiest ease thy loue. Ah but whom doe I loue? Varrona , easie to be wonne if she were not Varrona . But infortunate Lysimachus , if he winne not Varrona: yea but what hope cast thou haue of her amitie, with whome as yet thou hast no acquaintance? Cease therefore to surmise that which surpasseth thy sense, die rather with desire then liue for disgrace, for well maist thou loue Varrona , but neuer be liked of Varrona . Lysimachus hauing thus tented his wound, and finding the hurt so desperate, yeelded his maymed mind as a patient to be cured by Varronas onely mercie: perswading himselfe that there was none so daintie, none so loftie, and none so cruel, but loyaltie with constancie might make them courteous. Houering in this hope he began to take heart a grace, assuring himselfe almost of that gaine that was not so lightly gained, but when he mustered in his conceits how Varrona was discended, how womens ears are not their tuchstones, but their eies, and how a dram of honour weighs downe a pound of wit, how their hearts reacheth to the pulses of their hands, and let a man rub that with gold, and tis hard but they will prooue his hearts gold, he was presently driuen into such dampes, and being as it were in a laborinth of thoughts, was faine to cease thinking. At the last comming to himselfe, he tooke it not amisse, if the next day he walked abroad to see if the fields would further his desires, or minister some matter to mittigate his maladie: but comming into the aire, the ague of loues disease began to shake him afresh, and made him sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes in hope, and sometimes in feare; and thus at euerie step in a contrarie thought, he heard the Nightingale record in her song as he surmised his passionate sorrowes, and applying his tune to her note, he began to beare his part. Should I accuse mine eies that boldly gazed On that faire obiect not to be obtained? Or, blame the worth in Europs wonder blazed, That them to looke, and me to loue constrained? Eyes for excuse alleadge preuailing reason, Heart in extreames on fancies wrong exclaimed: Hopes Sun shine clowded like obscurest season, Yeelds to dispaire, at my misfortunes aymed. Nature too lauish, outward graces planted, Vertue too friendly, inward bounties sowed, Yet those faire eyes of courteous lookes are scanted, And Angels hue on tygers thoughts bestowed. Tush, loue with griefes which did oppresse me sore Is cause that I my death like life deplore. When Lysimachus had warbled out those words, and wrested the consideration of Varronas disposition, Venus willing to bestow vpo him the benefit of that friedly aspect, which he most desired, ordered so the matter yt Varrona according to her vsuall manner did frequent the leas wherein her fathers sheepe grazed, who with two other damosells sat vnder the side of an hil, making a garland of such homely floures as the fildes did affoord. This sight so reuiued his spirits that he drew nigh, with more iudgment to take a view of her singular perfection, which he found to be such, as in that countrie attire she stained all the countrie dames of Thessalia : while thus he stood gazing with piercing lookes on her surpassing beautie, Varrona cast her eie aside, and espied Lysimachus , as yet altogether vnknowne vnto her, which sodaine sight made her to blush, and to die her christall cheekes with a vermilion red, which gaue her such a grace as that she seemed farre more beautifull. And with that rising vp, Lysimachus , (that could well skill to court all kind of degrees, least he might then be thought to haue little manners) encountred them thus. Ladyes beleeue me, loue is of more force then warres, and the lookes of women pierce deeper then the stroke of the lance, there is no Curtlax so keene, but armour of high proofe can withstand: but beauties arrowes are so sharp, and the darts that flie fro womens eyes are so piercing, as the Corslet tempered by Vulcan for Didoes paramour, holds not out the violence of their strokes. The gods tremble when Mars shaketh his launce, but he feareth when Venus casteth a frowne. Alexander neuer tooke notice of the legions of his enemies, but he stood frighted at the beautie of the Amazon . Then sweete saints of Thessalia , meruaile not if I were driuen into a maze at the sight of such beauteous creatures, whose faces are Venus weapons wherewith she checketh the pride of ouer-daring warriours. I cannot (Ladies) court it as your gallant yongsters, that tye their wits to their fancies, nor fill your eares with amorous discourses, as Cupids apprentices, that spend their time in such louing philosophie. Nor can I faine conceited supposes of affection, to prooue my selfe loue-sicke by poetrie, but as a blunt shepheard new come from the folds, I offer my selfe a deuout seruant to your beauties, swearing to defend your honours against all men with the hazard of my bloud, and in pawne thereof, generally to you all, but specially to one (as loue hath his vnitie) I desire to be entertained as a dutifull seruant to the Lady Varrona. Lysimachus hauing thus boldly boorded these louely virgins, the Ladies seeing with what affection he offered his seruice to Varrona , began to bite the lip, and she to blush, who seeing her selfe toucht to the quick, made this answere. I know not (shepheard) how to answere of loue, because as yet I neuer knew loue: ignorant of his forces, because neuer acquainted with his fortunes. Vesta forbids vs virgins to name Venus , as they of Ephesus hatefull Erostratus. Diana deeles not in Paphos , nor suffers she any of her maydens to hunt in Erecynus , least meeting with Venus meacocks, they skip with Calisto , and so seeke after losse. The lesse you are priuate to loues passions, the more welcome to our presence: for rather had we fill our eares with shepheards sonnets, then with loues follies, and sweeter are the teares that grow from the losse of a fewe sheepe, then a smile from a comicke tale of fancie. For your seruice (gentle swaine) finding my selfe vnworthie, I craue pardon, but if it please you to be accepted as a worthie Shepheard, and my fathers friend, looke for such fauour as my honour and virginitie can affoord. Lysimachus hearing the plausible answere of Varrona , although her first insinuation seemed to answere for his purpose, as preferring the lawnes of Diana , and fires of Vesta , before loues holy temples, yet she concluded so sweetly as might stand with the modestie of her honour, he therefore made thus his replie. In that Madame we are but nouices in loue, the simpler are our thoughts, and the neerer should be the simpathie of our affections. Doues match when they are yong, siens are graffed when they are sprigs, the one part not but by death, nor are the other seuered but they perish. Shepheards are like Uirgins, the one striuing to liue vertuous, the other to die patientlie, both enemies to loue, while they wait on those which brooke not loue, I meane labour, and Vesta . But both must loue, as hauing hearts, and thoughts, eyes to see beautie, and eares to iudge of vertue: I Madame, while I thought none greater then Pan , was vowed to Pan , but seeing womens wits are more powerfull then he, I haue resigned ouer my fortunes at his shrine, and meane to make proofe of the sweetnes of loue: glad that in my first entrance I haue the patronage of your gratious fauour, armed with the which, Mars well may frowne, but not conquer. But sir (quoth Varrona ) I graunted my fauour to Lysimachus the Shepheard, not to Lysimachus the louer. And so (Madame quoth he) I accept of it, for I am a Shepheard to do you seruice, and a louer despight of my selfe. Varrona being a Lady of passing merrie disposition, hearing him thus to reason prettilie, thought to sift him in this manner. I see well (Shepheard) that as women haue their fauours, so men haue their sayings, the one prodigall in graces, the other politick in deceits, being as cunning to dissemble loue, as we charie to discharge loue. We thought to haue found you a flat Shepheard, as ignorant in loues, as we of fancies, but how closely soeuer you couer the flame, the fire will be knowne by the smoake. For your talke so sauours of loues principles, as we iudge you are as cunning in faining a passion, as in folding sheepe, and can as soone deceiue a woman with a pen, as adde a cure to a diseased lambe. This will make vs to take you for a day friend, and what we like in you present, to disalow to morrow, swearing if you bring amongst vs Venus roses, we will beate you with Vestaes nettles: and therefore if you will be admitted as our Shepheard, we either forbid you to say no more of loue, or else you shall be out of our fauours. If ( Varrona ) said he, thou hadst enioyned me as Iuno did to Hercules most dangerous labours, I would haue discouered my loue by obedience, and my affection by death: with that pulling forth his Pipe, began after some melodie to carroll this Madrigall. What are my Sheepe without their woonted foode? What my life except I gaine my loue? My Sheepe consume, and faint for want of blood, My life is lost, vnlesse I grace approue. No flower that saplesse thriues, No turtle without pheare. The day without the Sunne doth lowre for woe, Then woe mine eyes vnlesse they beawtie see, My Sunne Varronas eyes, by whom I know Wherein delight consists, where pleasures be. Nought more the heart reuiues, Then to embrace his deare. The starres from earthlie humours gaine their light, Our humours by their light possesse their power: Varronas eyes fed by my weeping sight, Infudes my paines or ioyes, by smile or lower. So wends the source of loue, It feeds, it failes, it ends. Kind lookes, cleare to your ioy, behold her eies, Admire her heart, desire to tast her kisses: In them the heauen of ioy, and solace lies, Without them euery hope his succour misses. Oh how I loue to proue, Whereto this solace tends. Scarce had the Shepheard ended this Madrigale, but Varrona began to frowne, saying, he had broken promise. Lysimachus alleadged if he vttered any passion, twas sung, not said. Thus these two in an humorous descant of their prattle, espied a farre off other Shepheards comming towards them, so that he leauing the Gentlewomen, taking his leaue friendlie of them all, but specially with a pittifull glancing looke towards Varrona , as crauing some fauour for his farewell, he stole to his Sheepe, & the damosels incontinently went home, who by the way recalled to mind the proportion of Lysimachus , his not vulgar behauiour, adding besides that his gate was more stately then ordinarie Shepheards: moreouer, a kind of maiestie that remained in his lookes, the seemelines of which did so shine farre aboue the rest, that all Thessalia supposed that he was Coridon , or one more fine then Coridon , sweet Phyllis her good man. Whe Varrona was come home, she tooke leaue for a while of her two friends, and stealing into her closet, she began to remember the diuine perfection of the Shepheard, Cupid waiting to spie this Uestall at aduantage, seeing her halfe at discouert, vnlosed a shaft, headed with desire,  & feathered with conceit, which piercing the tender brest of this yong mayden, he made her shrinke at the blow, and so breath out this complaint. Ay me, now I see, and sorrowing sigh to see, that Dianas lawrels, are harbourers of Venus doues, that there trace as well through the lawns, wantons, as chast ones, that Calisto be she neuer so charie will cast an amorous eie at courting loue, that Diana her selfe will change her shape, but she will not honour loue in a shadowe: maidens eies, be they as hard as diamonds, yet Cupid hath drugs to make them more pliable then waxe. See Varrona how fortune and loue haue interleagued themselues to be thy foes, and to make thee their subiect or else their obiect, haue inueigled thy sight, with a most glorious obiect. Of late thou heldst Venus for a giglet, not a Goddesse, now thou shalt be forced to sue suppliant to her deitie: Cupid was a boy and blind, but alas his eie had aime enough to pierce thee to the heart. I haue heard them say, that loue lookes not at lowe cottages, that Venus iets in robes, and not in rags, that her sonne flies so high, as that he scornes to touch pouertie with his heele. Tush Varrona these are but old wiues tales, and neither authenticall precepts, nor [illeg.]ble principles: for experience tels thee, that pesants haue their passions as well as Princes: that swaines, as they haue their labours, so haue they their amours, & loue lurkes assoone about a sheepcoate as a pallace. And for those dames that are like Diana , that affect Ioue in no shape, but in a shewer of gold, I wish them husbands with much wealth and little wit, that the want of the one may blemish the abundance of the other. It should staine the credit of a shepheards life to set the end of passions vpon pelfe. Loues eies looke not so low as gold, there are no fees to be paied in Cupids courts, and in elder times the shepheards loue gifts were apples and chestnuts, and their desires were loyall, and their thoughts constant. As she was thus debating the passions of her mind, one of her acquaintance interrupted her disquiet with his approach from the Duke her father presently to come to him; where for a while I will leaue her, and returne againe to tell you how the matter stood with Lysimachus . Such was the inconstant sorrowe that he sustained to thinke on the witte and beautie of Varrona , as that he began to loose his woted appetite, to looke pale and wan[illeg.] in stead of of mirth, to feede on melancholie: for countrie meriments, to vse cold dumps. In so much that not onely Procyon and his wife Odrisa , but all the whole village began to maruaile at his suddaine alteration thinking that some lingring sicknes had brought him to this state. Wherefore they caused Physitions to come, but Lysimachus neither would let them minister, nor so much as suffer them to see his vrine: but remained still so oppressed with passions, as he feared in him selfe a further inconuenience. His pouertie wished him to cease from such follies, but loue forced him to followe fancie, yea and in despight of pouertie, she wonne the conquest so that her hot desires caused him to find new deuises. For he pl[illeg.]ntly enterd his chamber, where he began to put downe the passions of his pen to this effect. hath arrested my loues affection, I leaue it to your sweetest sense to coinecture. But this I feele (although benummed in euery part) that some strange accident hath taken possession in the chiefest part of my heart, vowing there to continue vntill he hath conquered euery motion of mind, and sworne them to doe fealtie to your selfe, as their right soueraigne, and true mistresse. Although I denied him not the alleagence of a most louing and faithfull subiect, yet such was his rigorous iustice executed vpon me, that I should not enioy my former libertie, and wounding my thoughts with the piercing rayes of your heauenlie [illeg.]linesse, [illeg.]ettered my conceites in the giues of best liking, permitting me to liue, onely to thinke on you. The bondage of my slauerie did not so greatly dislike me, as the beholding of young beautie did euerie way delight me: neither the straightnesse of my fetters did put me to so great paine, as the rememberance of my thought did procure my displeasure. As honour Varrona is it then a prison? nay a paradice: to serue Varrona is it captiuitie? nay rather a heauenly brauerie. Content (quoth I) I like, I loue, I honour Varrona . I feed, I liue, I die for Varrona . Your louing captiue and true subiect, Lysimachus . When Lysimachus had written out his passionate fancies he carried the paper to the messenger, which he for that purpose had prepared, desiring him to vse the best regard in deliuerie of it, wishing him not to present his mistresse therewith vntill he saw her in some pleasent vaine, for he was in great feare least Varrona would rather rend then read it. Toxeus (for so the messenger was called) expecting oportunitie, espied a time as he thought most conuenient, Varrona and two or three Gentlemen merrilie discoursing of amorous phylosophie, this messenger almost marueiling to see her so pleasant, thought it now the fittest time to make deliuery of his message, gaue her Lysimachus letter, who perusing it to the first period, perceiued the practise of all, and beautifying her face with modest blushing, was halfe angrie with Toxeus that he made himselfe messenger of so vaine a matter, yet considering it came from that worthie shepheard, she vouchsafed it, and wished the messenger in the euening to come for an answere. Varrona immediately vpon her man Toxeus departure pervsed it a thousand times, and a thousand times kissed it, till at last wrapping it in a white silke scarfe, she gaue it a place amongst her iewels of price: very glad therefore that Lysimachus had giuen the onset, she determined to counterbuffe him in this manner. blusht at mine owne thoughts, and sorrowed at thy fortunes. I search not the cause of thy loue, for it sufficeth me thou doest loue, if it lay in me, either to grant thy desire, or satisfie thy passions. Thy comelinesse ( Lysimachus ) knockes at the closet of my heart, thy exquisitie feature sue for their maisters libertie: thy loyaltie enters pele mele with my thoughts, and giueth a sore assault to my setled resolution: all these put in their pleas, doe purchace fauour for young Lysimachus . But Uesta , hard hearted Uesta ; that makes her virgins pliant to her owne properties, commaunds that I shut mine eares against such alluring Syrens I count my selfe greatlie fauoured with the loue of so worthie a swaine, and euer will Varrona couet to prooue as thankfull, as he affectionate: onely in loue pardon me, for that I neuer mean to fall into that predicament. Wade not therfore where the foord hath no footing, barke not with the wolues of Syria against the Moone, looke not to climbe to Olympus , way not at impossibilities, but pacifie that with patience, which thou canst not obtaine being passionate. If thou thinkest these denialls be but words of course, and perswadest thy selfe that women will be first coy, and then courteous, as the marble that drops of raine doe piere, thou shalt (sweete heart) deeply deceiue thy selfe, and highly wrong me. In a word, I wish quiet to thy thoughts, and an end to thy loues. Thine euer but in loue, Varrona . Varrona hauing thus ended her letter, she deliuered it to Toxeus , who sending him speedely to Lysimachus lodging, found him very melancholy, and all God wot was about Varrona. Lysimachus hauing receiued the letter, entered into his Chamber, and read the contents. No sooner had he viewed and reuiewed ouer her cruell determination, but in a great extasie of minde he cried out ( Dulcier est mors qu am amor: ) and with that slinging out of his Chamber, he fell into bitter, and extreame sorrowes. Procyon grieuing at his friends hard fortune, sought with plausible perswasions to appease his furious melancholie, wishing him whatsoeuer Varrona wrote, still to thinke her a woman, that would one while thrust out fancie with a finger, and streight entertaine loue as a friend: that either time, or his constancie would make her stoope to the lure of his desires. Thus sought the Shepheard to wrest him from his passions, but in vaine, for her answere confirmed with such perswasiue determinations so quietted the conceit of his hope, that going melancholie to his bed, loue left him to his quiet slumbers which were not long, for as soone as Phoebus shaking his deawie lockes on the mountaines, had posted from the watry cabbin of Nereus , summoning plow swaines to their handie labour, Lysimachus rose, and with Procyon went into the fields, where vnfolding their Sheepe, they sate them downe vnder on Oliue tree, both of them diuersly affected, Lysimachus ioying in the excellencie of Varrona , and Procyon sorrowing for the griefes which Lysimachus susteined, not quiet in thought till he might heare of his health. As thus both of them sate in their dumps, they might espie where Varrona with her two Gentlewomen tript amongst the lawnes. At this sodaine spectacle, as a man metamorphosed, he lightly sprang from the ground, desiring to salute the sole mistres of his thoughts: wherefore willing the Shepheard to expect his returne, he boorded her with this kind of greeting; giuing her likewise the Boniorno thus. Gentle Nymph, all hayle, and as prosperous be you in your enterprises, as you happie in content. If I be blunt in discouering my affections, and vse little eloquence in leuelling out my loues, I appeale to the shrine of veritie which knoweth no subtilities, to frame my selfe therefore to your countrie fashion, with much faith, and little flatterie. Know beawtifull Varrona , that before I saw you I knew not loues cumber, but held affection as a toy, not as a maladie, vsing fancie as the Hiperborej do their flowers, which they weare in their bosomes all day, and cast them into the fire for fuell at night. I liked all, because I loued none, and who was most faire, on her I fed mine eyes, but as charilie as the Bee, that as soone as she hath suckt hony from the Rose, streight flies to the Marigold. Liuing thus at my owne list, I wondred at such as were in loue, and when I read their passions, I tooke them only for poems that flowed from the quicknes of their wit, not the sorrowes of the heart. But now faire Nymph loue hath taught me such a lesson, that I must confesse his deitie and dignitie, as there is nothing so pretious as beautie, so there is nothing more piercing then fancy. For since my eye tooke a curious suruey of your excellence, I haue been so fettered with your beautie and vertue, as (sweete Varrona) Lysimachus without further circumstance loues Varrona . I could point out my louely desires with long ambages, but seeing in many words lies mistrust, and that truth is euer naked, let this suffice for countrie wooing, Lysimachus loues Varrona , and none but Varrona . Although these words were most heauenlie harmonie in the eares of the Nymph, yet to seeme coy at the first courting, and to disdaine loue, howsoeuer she disdained loue she made him this replie. Ah Lysimachus , though I seeme simple, yet am I more subtile then to swallow the hooke, because it hath a painted bait: as men are wise, so women are warie, specially if they haue that wit by others harmes to beware. Do we not know Lysimachus , that mens tongues are like Mercuries pipe, that can inchaunt Argus with an hundred eyes? and their words as preiudiciall as the charmes of Circes , that transformed men into monsters? If such Syrens sing, we poore women had neede stop our eares, least in hearing we prooue so foolish hardie, as to belieue them: and so perish in trusting much, and suspecting little. Lysimachus Piscator ictus sapit , he that hath bene once poisoned, and afterwards feare not to bowse of euery potion, is worthie to suffer double penance. Giue me leaue to mistrust, though I do not condenme. Lysimachus is now in loue with Varrona , he a Shepheard of meane parents, she a Lady of great parentage: he poore, she honourable. Can loue consist of contrarieties? Will the Faulcon pearch with the Batresse? the Lion harbour with the Wolfe? Will Venus ioyne roabes and rags together? or can there be a sympathie betweene a King and a begger? Then Lysimachus , how can I beleeue that loue should vnite our thoughts, when fortune hath set such difference betweene our degrees? But thou likest of Varronas beawtie. Men in their fancie resemble ye Waspe, which scornes that flower fro which she had fetcht her wax: playing like the inhabitats of the Iland Tenerifa , who whe they haue gathered the sweet spices, vse the trees for fewell: so men, hauing glutted theselues with the faire of womens faces, hold them for necessarie euils, and wearied with that which they seemed so much to loue, cast away fancie, as children do their rattles: and loathing that which so deeplie before they liked, especially such as take loue in a minute, and haue their eyes attractiue like iet, apt to entertaine any obiect, are as readie to let it slip againe. Lysimachus hearing how Varrona harpt still on one string, which was the doubt of mens constancie, he brake off her sharp inuectiue thus. I grant Varrona (quoth he) many men haue done amisse, in proouing soone ripe, and soone rotten, but particular instances infer no generall coclusions: and therfore I hope, what others haue faulted in, shall not preiudice my fauours. I will not vse sophistrie to cofirme my loue, for that is subtilitie: nor long discourses, least my words might be thought more then my faith: but if this will suffice, that by the trust of a Shepheard, I loue Varrona , and woe Varrona , not to crop the blossomes, & reiect the tree, but to consummate my faithfull desires in the honourable end of marriage. At this word marriage, Varrona stood in a maze what to answere, fearing if she were too coy, to driue him away with her disdaine: if she were too courteous, to discouer the heate of her desires; in a dilemma thus what to do, at last this she said. Lysimachus , euer since I saw thee, I fauoured thee, I cannot dissemble my desires, because I see thou dost faithfully manifest thy thoughts, & in liking thee, I haue thee so far as my honour holds fancie still in suspence, but if I knew thee as vertuous as thy actions do pretend, and as well qualified whereof you make demonstration, the doubt should be quickly decided, but for this time to giue thee answer, assure thy selfe thus, I will either marrie with Lysimachus , or still liue a virgin, & with this they streined one anothers hand. He hauing his answer, gaue a curteous adew to them 3. but specially to Varrona , & so playing loth to depart, he went to Procyon , who all this while attended his comming, vnto whom Lysimachus made a true relation of all those things which passed betweene them, aduertising him of the lenitiue remedies which she applied vnto his maladious spirit, whom we will for a time permit to meditate on his singular expectations, and returne vnto Syllanus, Varronas father. He hauing intelligence of the secret meetings which these two louers daily vsed, being exceeding much displeased, vpo a day as he walked into his Garden, by chance he met with Varrona; accompanied with diuers Gentlewomen, whom saluting very gratiously, he passed by them, and taking his daughter by the hand, walking aside with her into an open greene walke, fell into this talke with her. Why huswife (quoth he) are you so idle tasked that you stand vpon thornes vntill you haue a husband? are you no sooner hatched with the Lapwing, but you wil run away with the shel on your head? soone pricks the tree that wil prooue a thorne, and a girle that loues too soone wil repent too late. What a husband? why the maydes of Rome durst not looke at Venus temple till they were 30, nor went they vnmasked till they were maried, that neither their beauties might allure other, nor they glance their eyes on euery wanton. Egipt is plagued with a dearth, I tell thee fond girle when Nilus ouerfloweth before his time, the trees that blossome in February, are nipped with the frosts in May: vntimely fruits had neuer good fortune,  & yong Gentlewomen that are wooed and wonne ere they be wise, sorrow and repent before they be old. What seest thou in Lysimachus that thine eye must choose, and thy heart must fancie? Is he beautiful? why fond girle, what thy eye liketh at morne, it hateth at night: loue is like a bauen but a blaze: and beautie, how can I better compare it then to the gorgeous Cedar , that is onely for shewe, and nothing for profit? to the apples of Tantalus that are precious in the eye, and dust in the hand? to the starre Artophilax that is most bright, but fitteth not for any compasse: so yong men that stand vpon their outward portrayture, I tell thee are preuidiciall: Demophoon was fayre, but how dealt he with Phillis? Æneas was a braue man, but a dissembler: all but little worth if they be not wealthie. And I pray thee what substance hath Lysimachus to endue thee with? hast thou not heard that want breakes amitie, that loue which beginneth not in gold, doth end in beggerie: that such as marrie but to a faire face, tie themselues oft to a foule bargaine? And what wilt thou doe with a husband that is not able to maintaine thee? buy forsooth a dram of pleasure with a pound of sorrowe, and a pinte of content with a whole tunne of preiudiciall displeasures? But why doe I cast stones in the ayre, or breath my words into the wind, when to perswade a woman from her will is to rowle Sisyphus stone: or to tie a head-strong girle from loue, is to tie furies againe in fetters. Therefore huswife as you tender my affection I commaund you to surcease those vaine and idle matters, which please me as much as the stinging of a waspe: and shall profit you as little, as fire to coole your thirst. And with that in a rage he flung away not admiting her replie. Varrona perceiuing her fathers good will thus alienated from her, fearing a further inconuenience, did in humilitie submit her selfe to his disposing, not vsing any longer her accustomed walkes. Which Lysimachus perceiuing, mused greatly what should become of his loue; somewhile he thought she had taken some word vnkindly, and had taken the pet, then he imagined some new loue had withdrawne her fancie, or happilie she was sicke, or detained by some great businesse of Syllanus . These coniectures did Lysimachus cast into his head, who hauing loue in his heart, proued restlesse, and halfe without patience that Varrona wronged him with so long absence: for loue measures euery minnit, and thinkes houres to be daies, and dayes to be monethes, till he feeds his eies with the sight of his desired obiect. Thus perplexed liued poore Lysimachus , while on a day siting with Procyon in a great dumpe, he was crediblie informed by Toxeus of those sorrowfull accidents: at which being sodainely surprised with griefe, and fixing his eyes on the starrie concaue, began thus in their presence to vtter passionate coplaints, not limiting his lamnets with distinct clauses, for his moane admitted no methode. Iniurious heauens (quoth he) hath your influence effected this misfortune? iniust gods, haue you in enuying this my prosperitie, depriued me of the view of that wherein I imagined my whole felicitie should consist? vngentle Cupid hast thou deeming my Varrona fairer then thy Pshyche , thwarted thus my doating humour? I will wander through the earth augmenting the springs with streames of my teares, filling the woods with rebounding Ecchoes of my woes, tracing the plaines with my restlesse steps. O that I might equall Orpheus in art, as I excell him in anguish! the powerful vertue of his heauely tunes amazed furious beasts, staied fluet streames, raised stones, assembled trees, mouing sense in senselesse things. Descending to the silent vaults of Asheron , he caused ghostes to groane, shadowes to sigh, effecting releting thoughts in hels remorslesse iudges. But were I his pheere in that profession, I would do more, enforcing Syllanus her father not touched with such a sympathie, to leaue his suspition, and grant me my loue: whither do I wander? Is this to rest: leaue Lysimachus : nay proceed Lysimachus : cease to suppose, begin to sorrow: Ay me, wretched me, haplesse, hopelesse, what meanes can I now conceit, what deuise may now be potted? Hereat he stopt, and opening the flood-gates of his eyes, distilled a shewer of teares, supplying his speeches with deepe sighes: But resoluing to proceed, he was interrupted by the shepheard: who hearing the words of his complaints, lamented at the occasion of his sorrowes, & sought by all meanes to extirpate out of his memorie the rememberance of these causualties, assuring him that time being the touchstone of loue, would no doubt sort all things for his content: and so (quoth he) you see it is time to fold our flockes, with that they put their sheepe to their coates and went home: but he poore soule that had loue his loadstar, and his thoughts set on fire with the flax of fancie, could take no rest, but began to ruminate daily vpon the iniunction which Varrona had receiued from her father. Remaining in this pitifull plight, feeding on nothing but heauie dispaire, he became so changed in his bodie and soule, as though they had bene now departing. But by good hap his mourning being ouerheard by the good shepheard, and finding him so transformed, most speedelie informed Varrona thereof. She hauing taken diligent notice of this his information, admired greatly at the constancie of his affection, and seeing her father vpon vrgent affaires was rode to the Court, she deemed it not amisse herselfe to goe and visit him. Who calling vpon Lysimachus with a shrill voice, recouered him better with her words, then with all the potions or hot drinkes she could deuise to giue him. Lysimachus staring her in the face, muttered (as it seemed) to himselfe, but remained speechlesse, but she with great care comforted him (as a woman want no good words in such a case) and brought him againe to the vse of his tongue, wherewith he foultred out these words. Ah Varrona ! cruell dispaire hath so mangled my sweete hope, that vnlesse I finde some speedie remedie, the wound will growe incurable, and willing to goe forward his breath failed him. Lysimachus (quoth she) as I am ignorant of the cause, so I am sorrowfull for thy disease: and I would I had as much power to heale thy extremitie, as will to performe it, if it shall not preiudice the glorie of my credit, or blemish my honour; therefore if it be in my hands to better thee, assure thy selfe to enioy the benefit, the honour of my name alwaies excepted. Lysimachus pawsing a while thought it best to discouer himselfe, and presently to receiue the conset to life, or the reply to death (for his life & death did depend in her answere) & praying the rest to depart, with a sighing spirit, and trembling cheere, disclosed himselfe. At my sweete Varrona , in whose answere is seated my heauen or hell; to recount to you my sorrowes, or repent my loue, can neither ease me of the one, or further me in the other, seeing your selfe shall appeare a witnesse in them both. Although that reason did somewhat prefer me, by the benefit of seemely gouernment, keeping in subiection the vntamed appetite of furious affections, yet confirming it by my owne eyesight, the manifold graces wherewith dame nature hath mightily enriched you, I found my thoughts so fiercely assaulted, that either I must yeeld to be your captiue, or else die in the combat. Yea the glistering beames of your heauenly perfections so pierced my heart, that I was forced to forsake reason, to followe affection: and to forgoe libertie, to liue in bondage: if it may be tearmed bondage, to serue with loue such rare excellencie. Hauing tasted so much of fancies cup, and the drinke dispiersing it selfe into euery part, I felt such passions in mine vnacquainted conceits, that nothing but the rememberance of your sweetest sake, could procure my ease, fully resolued to serue, loue, and honour Varrona , till the destinies of death should denie me. Tumbling in the extremitie of these straunge passions, and hearing that thy fathers suspition, or rather iealousie of our late vnited simpathie, doth watch like Argus ouer Io , vnwilling that thou shouldest passe beyond the reach of his eye, vnlesse as the thinkes thou shouldest ouerreach thy selfe, my contents were turned into delayes complaints, and my pleasure wrapt in this laborynth of grieuous lamentations: but now noting the exrtemitie of thy fortunes, I find that Venus hath made this constant to requite my miseries, and that where the greatest onset is giuen by fortune, there is strongest defence made by affection. Thus I doubt not but thy father in watching thee, ouer-waketh himselfe, and (I hope) profiteth as little, as they which gaze on the flames of Æ tna , which vanish out of the sight in smoake. Varrona throughlie vnderstanding his rare and ruthfull discourse, with weeping eyes, and sorrowfull cheere, embracing him in her armes, after a sugred kisse, gaue him this sweete comfort. The heauens Lysimachus by their miraculous working haue taken truce with our affections, whose diuine influence, I thinke by some secret contemplation do seeme to conclude our loues. It may be I haue been liked of some, and flattered of many, but neuer deserued of any, but only of thee Lysimachus , whose life, loue, and loyaltie, may iustly claime an interest in the fauourable consent, and constancie of thy Varrona. Lysimachus hearing this heauenlie harmonie, was so rauished betweene ioy and feare (for he feared least it had bin but a dreame) that he was not able to vtter one word, but at last sensibly perceiuing that it was no vision, but the veritie of his desires, staying himselfe by her hand, concluded thus. Ah sweete Varrona , the only reuiuer of my dying spirit, although neither heauen nor earth can affoord me thanks sufficient to requite thine honourable fauour, yet shall the zealous truth and tried loue of Lysimachus affections encounter the glorie of Varronas beawtie. And I vow by the heauens, that when Lysimachus shall let his eye slip from thy beawtie, or his thoughts from thy qualities, or his heart from thy vertues, or his whole life from euer honouring thee, then shall heauen cease to haue starres, the earth trees, the world elements, and euery thing reuersed shall fall to their former Chaos . Hauing thus plight their troth each to other, seeing they could not haue the full fruition of their loue in Thessalia , for that Syllanus consent would neuer be granted to so meane a match. Varrona determined as soone as time and opportunitie would giue her leaue, to prouide a great masse of money, and many rich and costly iewels for the easier carriage, and then to transport themselues and their treasure into Thracia , where they would leade a contented life, vntill such time as either she should be reconciled to her father, or else by succession, (being the sole child her father had) come to the Dukedome. This deuise was greatlie praised of Lysimachus , for he feared, if the Duke her father should but heare of the contract, that his furie would be such, as no lesse then death would stand for painment. He therefore told her that delay bred danger, that many mishaps did fall out betweene the cup and the lip, and that to auoyd anger it were best with as much speede as might be to passe out of Thessalia , least fortune might preuent their pretence with some new despight. Varrona , whom loue pricked forward with desire, promised to dispatch her affaires with as great haste as either time or opportunitie would giue her leaue, and so resting vpon this point after many imbracings and sweete kisses they departed. Varrona hauing taken her leaue of her best beloued Lysimachus , went immediately home, her merrie countenance giuing no suspition of mistrust at all. Lysimachus poore soule was no lesse ioyfull, that being a Shepheard, fortune had fauoured him so, as to reward him with the loue of a Ladie, hoping in time to be aduanced from that condition, to be the husband of a rich Princesse. So that he thought euery houre a yeare, till by their departure they might preuent danger, not ceasing still to go euery day to his Sheepe, not so much for the care of the flocke, as for the desire he had to see his loue, and sweete heart Varrona , who oftentimes when opportunitie would serue priuately repaired thither (albeit her fathers prohibition to the contrary) to feede her fancie with the sweete content of Lysimachus presence. And albeit she neuer went to visit him but most secretly, yet her oft repaire made her not only suspected, but knowne to diuers of their neighbours, who for the good will they bare to old Procyon , told him secretly of the matter, wishing him to aduertise Lysimachus of it, that he would if it were possible restraine his libertie. In the meane time Varrona was not slacke in her affaires, but applied her matters with such diligence, that she prouided all things fit for their iourney. Treasure and Iewels she had gotten great store, thinking there was no better friend then mony in a strange country: rich attire she had prouided for Lysimachus , and because she could not bring the matter to passe, without the help and aduise of some one, she made the old seruant of hers called Toxeus , who had serued her from his childhoode priuie to her affaires, who seeing no perswasions could preuaile to diuert her from her setled determination, gaue his consent, and dealt so secretlie in the cause, that within short space he had gotten a Ship readie for their passage. The Mariners, seeing a fit gale of wind for their purpose, wished Toxeus to make no delayes, least if they pretermitted this good weather, they might stay long ere they had such a faire winde. Toxeus fearing that his negligence should hinder the iourney, in the night time conueighed the Trunkes full of treasure into the Ship, and by secret meanes let Lysimachus vnderstand, that the next morning they meant to depart: he vpon the newes slept very little that night, but got him vp earely and went to his sheepe, looking euery minute when he should see Varrona . Now see the valiantnes of a virgin, or rather consider the force of loue, which maketh the weake strong, the witlesse wise, the simple subtile, yea, and the most cowards most couragious. For that morning Varrona attired her selfe in one of her Pages apparell, and trudged out of the towne, as if she had been sent on some message, and so fast as her faint legges (but strengthened by loue) could carrie her, she hasted through the woods to the fields, where the saint whom she only honoured was readie to receiue her: who though at the first he knew her not, but thought she had been Cupid or Mercurie fallen from the heauens, yet at length by her louing lookes cast vpon him, he knew who it was, and embracing her fast in his armes, said; If Iupiter (sweete wench) should see thee in this Pages apparell, no doubt but he would forgoe his Ganymede , and take thee vp into heauen in his steede. O most soueraigne Ladie and Mistres, what seruice shall I be able euer to do you, which may counteruaile this kindnes? what dutie can be a due recompence to this good will? If I by any meanes can requite this curtesie, I neuer doubt to be deemed vngratefull while I liue. But accept (good Ladie) I beseech you, that which is in me to performe, which is, the faithfullest heart that euer was vowed to Ladie, which when it swerueth from you, let the torments of Tantalus, Tytius, Sysiphus , and all the ruthfull rout of hell be heaped vpon me. Varrona hearing him so earnest, said. Few words (most worthie Lysimachus ) are enough to win credit to a matter alreadie belieued: for only vpon confidence of your constant  & faithfull heart towards me, I haue thus vnaduisedly aduentured mine honour as you see, desiring you not sinisterlie to thinke of this my attempt, being boldned thereto by the great loue which I bare towards you, & by the loyaltie which I looke for of you towards me. Ah (said Lysimachus ) if I should make any ill interpretatio of your vertuous loue and sincere affection towards me, I were the veriest villaine on earth: for I take God to witnes, I take your forward will for such friedly fauour, that I doubt my deserts will neuer be able to answer thereto as I desire: and with that he aptly ended his talk vpo her mouth. Now fro thence they posted to the hauen where the Ship lay, not daring any longer to stay for feare of apprehesion by posts which should be sent after the. Whither so soone as they were come, the Mariners were readie with their Cock-boate to set them aboord, where being coucht together in a cabbin, they hoisting their maine sailes weighed anchor, and haled into the deepe, hauing a lustie gale in the poope which draue them gallantly forward. But on the next morning about the breake of the day, the aire began to be ouercast, the winds to rise, the seas to swell, yea presently there arose such a fearefull tempest as the Ship was in danger to be swallowed vp with euery sea, the maine mast with ye violece of the wind was throwne ouer-boord, the sayles were torne, the tackling went in sunder, the storme raging still so furiously, that poore Varrona was almost dead for feare, but that she was greatly comforted with the presence of Lysimachus . The tempest continued three daies, all which time the marriners euery minute looked for death, and the ayre was so darkened with cloudes, that the maister could not tell by the compasse in what coast they were. But vpon the fourth day about nine of the clock, the wind began to cease, the sea to waxe calme, and the skie to be cleere, and the marriners descryed the coast of Arcadia : shooting off their ordinace for ioy that they had escaped such a feareful tempest. Lysimachus hearing that they were arriued at some harbor, sweetly kissed Varrona ,  & bad her be of good courage, being set on land, and rewarding the marriners bountifully for their paines, they soiourned in a little village a mile distant from the sea, where after they had rested for a day, they made prouisio for their mariage, which according to the sacred rites was solemnely celebrated: which being performed, putting on pilgrims aparrell, they went hand in hand, and heart in hart, wailfully and wilfully wandring in that vnknowne countrie Arcadia , to auoide further punishment and displeasure. See (gentlewomen) the lamentable lot of loue which draue Varrona from her pleasant pallace, from her flourishing friends, from her traine of seruants, from her sumptuous fare, from her gorgeous garments, from varietie of delights, from secure quietnesse: yea from heauenly happines, to wilde wildernesse: to desart dens, to careful caues: to hard cheere with hawes and hippes, to pilgrims pelts: to perill of spoiling, to danger of deuouring to miserie of mind, to affliction of bodie, yea to hellish heauinesse. O pittiles parent! to prefer his own hate before his childs loue, his owne displeasures, before his childs pleasures, to forget that himselfe was once yong and subiect to loue, to measure the firie flames of youth by the dead coals of age, to gouerne his child by his owne lust, which now is, not which was in times past To seeke to alter his naturall affection from his daughter vpon so light a cause, shewing himselfe a rebell to nature, to vndo the destinies, and disappoint the appointment of the Gods, shewing himselfe a traytor to them. Two or three dayes being passed, and noe newes heard of Varrona, Syllanus assured of her escape, cryed out as a man halfe lunatick, he was by Lysimachus robd of his onely iewel, wherevpon in a dispairing furie he cmomanded Procyon to be sent for in al hast. Who maruailing what the matter should be, began to examine his owne conscience, wherein he had offended the Duke, but imboldned with his inocencie, couragiously went to the pallace: whither assoone as he came, he was not admitted vnto the presence of Syllanus , but presently sent to prison. Many passionate thoughts came into his head, till at last he began to fall into consideration of Lysimachus follies, and to meditate with himselfe: leaning his head on his hand, and his elbow on his knee, full of sorrow, grief, and disquieted passions, be resolued into these tearmes. Unhappie Procyon , whome too much courtesie hath led to these misfortunes, and vaine credulitie wrapt in the maze of these calamities. Now I see, but alas too late, that the smoothest tales for the most part haue put small truth, that the fowlest skin is couered with faire paintings, that vice lieth obfuscated in the cinders of honest simplicitie. Woe worth the day wherein my eie offended in the prodigalitie of her sight: woe worth that I pittied his destresses, relieued his wants, tooke compassion of his necessities, succoured his state, entertained him, fauored, affected him, and approued his behauior. All these I greatly feare, will if not ruinate my selfe, yet make shipwracke of my credit and liking with the Duke, so that by liuing I shall die to want, & by death purchase such a name of infamie as neuer shal be forgotten: be penitent, & assign thy life some penance to discouer thy sorow, & pacifie his wrath. In the depth of this his passion, he was sent for to the duke, who with a looke that threatned death, intertained him & demanded of him where his daughter was. Procyon made answere, that indeede Lysimachus was too familiar with Varrona his daughter; wherevpon I fearing the worst (quoth he) about 3. or 4. daies past verie sharply rebuked him for his saucinesse: adding moreouer, that if it were not left, he would bring both vpon himselfe extreme preuidice, and eternall confusion vpon me and my wife: now the next morning after, I neither heard of him or sawe him. Syllanus perceiuing the mans vnfained simplicitie, let him depart without incurring further displeasure, concealing such secret griefe for his daughters retchlesse follie, that she had so forgotten her honour, and parentage by so base a choice, to dishonour her father, and discredit her selfe, that with verie care and thought he fell into a quartain feuer, which was so vnfit for his aged yeares and complexion, that he became so weake, as the Phisitions would not grant him no life. And one day being in his agonie he breathed out his griefs in this sorrowfull sort. If nature by the diuine prouidence of God, did not moue vs to the maintenance of mankind, surely the charge of childre is such a heauie burden, that it would feare men from entring into the holy state of matrimony. For to omit the inconuenience of their infancy, which are infinite, when they drawe once to mans estate, what time they should be a stay to our staggering age, good God with what trouble do they torment vs? with what cares do they consume vs? what annoyes doe they afflict our decaying yeares withal? They say we are renued and reuiued as it were in our ofspring, but we may say we die daylie in thinking of the desperate deedes of our children. And as the spider feeleth if her webbe be prickt but with the point of a pinne: so if our children are touched but with the least trouble that is, we feele the force of it to pierce vs to the heart. But how well this tender care is by them considered, alas it maketh my heart bleede to thinke. If we looke for obedience of them, and that they should followe our counsaile in the conueigh of their affaires, why they imagine we doate, and their owne wits are farre better then ours. If we warne them to be warie and thriftie, they thinke it proceedeth rather of couetousnesse then of kindnesse: if we prouide them no marriages, it is because we will depart with no liuing to them: if we perswade them to marriage, it is because we will haue them to forsake all good fellowship, and liue like clownes in the countrie by the plough-taile: if we perswade them to learning, it is, that they might liue by it without our charge: if we perswade them to one wife rather then an other, it is because the one is richer then the other. If we looke seuerely to them, we loue them not: If we vse them familiarly, we feede them with flatterie, because we will giue them little: and so of all our louing deeds they make these lewd deuises: yea when we haue brought them vp with great care and cost, when we haue trauailed all our time by sea and by land, earely and late, in paine and in perrill, to heape vp treasure for them, when we haue by continuall toyle shortned our owne liues, to lengthen and inlarge their liuings and possessions, yet if we suffer them not to royst and to ryot, to spill and to spoyle, to lauish and to consume, yea and to follow the furie of their owne frantick fancies in all things, this forsooth is our recompence, they wish an end of our liues, to haue our liuings. Alas, a lamentable case, why hath not nature caused loue to ascend as well as descend? why hath she indued the Storke with this propertie, to feede his damme when she is old, and men with such malice to wish their parents death when they are aged? But I speake perchaunce of my owne proper griefe, God forbid it should be a common case: for my daughter (why doe I call her daughter) hath not onely wisht my death but wrought it. She knewe she was my onely delight: she knewe I could not liue, she being out of my sight: she knew her desperate disobedience would driue me to a desperate death. And could she now so much doate on a poore shepheard, to force so little of her louing father? Alas a husband is to be preferred before Father and Friend but had she none to fixe her fancie on but a Swaine, the sonne of I knowe not whome? Alas loue hath no respect of persons: yet was not my good will and consent to be craued therein? alas she sawe noe possibilitie to obtaine it. But now alas, I would grant my good will, but it is too late, her feare of my furie is too great euer to be found, her fault is too great, euer to looke me in the face any more, and my sorrow is too great, euer to be salued. And thereupon got him to bed very heauilie affected, dayly bewayling the losse of his daughter Varrona , with whom I do now begin. The Sunne soiourning in his winter mansion had disrobed Arcadia of all her pleasures, and disgarnished Vestaes mantle of delights variable choice, wherewith Flora had in plentie powdred the freshnes of her earst greene hue. Night suted in a duskie robe of pitchie darkenes, besieged the globe with long shadowes, while Phoebus wanting wonted vigour, did by darting his scarce reflected beames, affoord small comfort to the earths increase, so that Arcadia earst the soueraigne seate of all content, and sole place of worlds perfections, seemed now a patterne of the ancient Chaos , wherein all things (if things) were confounded. Fields flowerlesse, trees leauelesse, ground heatelesse, brookes streamelesse, springs vnhaunted, groues vnhalowed, augmented this hue of horrour, blemish of Europs paradice. The mayden huntresse Arcadiaes patronesse, did seldome trace the plaines guarded with her troupe of virgin knights, to fixe shafts on the flying beasts, whose wont was in time of heauens more milde aspect, to grace the fields with her daily presence, and when her brothers scorching heate tired her limbs with faintnes, to bath her chast bodie in some pleasant brooke. Nor did the wanton Satyres lightlie skipping on the painted meades, (painted I meane by natures workemanship) vaunt their bodies agilitie to the fairie wood-Nymphs. Pan , Arcadiaes president, pend vp himselfe in his winter lodging, and the other rurall powers seeing their glories date ended for that yeere, shrouded themselues in the place of their wonted repose. In this season, a season well fitting their melancholie thoughts distracted with moodie passions, Varrona and Lysimachus , the maps of fortunes mutabilitie, left their countrie, wandred in middest of winters rage surcharged with sorrow, the extremitie whereof made them haplesse abiects, while rough Boreas winters henchman mustering legions of stormes, scourged the plaines with a troupe of tempests, and aimed his violent blasts at the tallest trees to lop their heights pride, and combatting with his companions, filled the aire with dreadfull noyse of their tumultuous encounter; these infortunate louers, in whose minds loue martialled millions of striuing passions, thus wandring, whom fancie tost in a boundlesse Ocean of perplexing thoughts, ceased not their trauaile till the weathers intemperate furie calmed by heauens milder influence, tooke truce with time, and sealed the attonement with a sodaine change. But when Phoebus renuing his yeerely taske, and denying longer residence to stormie winter, had pierced earths entrailes with comfortable warmth, opening a frutefull passage for the issue of her wombe, to cloath Pomonaes branches with natures bountie, and diapre her owne mantle with Floraes sense-alluring pomp; Lysimachus and Varrona entred the maine continent of Arcadia , where seeing the late hue of horrour turned to an heauen of eyes happines, they redoubled many sighes drawne from the depth of their wofull hearts centre: for remembring that Tellus was earst dismantled, the trees bereaued of their blossomes beautie, earths naturall defects anatomized by time, in the place where frostie Hyems had displaied her ycie trophies, they lamented to thinke that these tokens of worlds mutabilitie, had recouered their former flourish by the yeeres timely alteration, but their desperate fortunes (as they imagined) had no hope of any happie spring to calme the winter of their woes. Drowned in these deepe meditations, they proceeded pensiue, but they had not walked farre, when they espied a faire broad Oake, whose spatious branches enuironed the ground lying vnderneath with a shadie circle. There they determined to rest a while their bodies wearied by long iourneis, and somewhat disburthen their soules by displaying their sorrowes. As thus they were discoursing of their fortunes, they beheld as they looked back an Arcadian, and by his habit seemed a Shepheard, who ouer-hearing the last words of their complaints, and aiming (though amisse) at the occasion of their sorrowes, thought that being strangers he lameted ye losse of their way, to which imaginatio applying his words, he began thus. Friends (for so I may tearme you without offence) the day is almost spent, and the night being dangerous for such as you are, or at least seeme to be, I meane strangers: accept then a simple lodging in my cottage, with such homely fare as Shepheards houses yeeld, and when to morrowes Sunne shal display his bright (though late forcelesse) beames, ye may prosecute your intended iourney, wherein if my directions may further you, ye shall find me readie to affoord them. They wondering at such rare humanitie harboured in those contemptible weeds, made a log pause as if they had enioyned their mouthes to perpetuall silence, at last Lysimachus shapt him this replie. Friend (for so your proffered courtesie bindes vs to tearme you) muse not that sobs interrupt my words, or sorrowes season my discourse, which onely comfort my fates haue assigned me. What we were we list not now to repeate, what we are, you see we grieue: a lodging in your cottage we gladly accept: your countrie fare we wil thankfullie receiue; your directions wil be needlesse, for we wander thus vp and downe to light on some cottage, where I and my wife, with this our seruant may dwell, for we purpose to buy some Farme, and a flock of sheep, to become shepheards, meaning to liue low, & content vs with a countrie life: for I haue heard some say that they drink without suspition, & sleepe without care. And if this double fauour do proceed fro you, then in requitall of your courtesie, first, we beseech Iupiter Xenius the patron of hospitalitie, and protectour of strangers, to blesse our labours, prosper our attempts, and enrich your store with hoped plentie: next, we vow by that bright lamp heauens ornament, that if fortune (as she is neuer stable) raise vs fro so low an ebbe to the wonted height of our good hap, we will remunerate your kindnes with most ample recompence. Alexis (such was the Shepheards name) seeing maiestie in their lookes, grauitie seated in disguise, royaltie suted in base attire, gathered by these probable coniectures, that they could be of no meane degree; mooued therefore with a deeper remorse, he courteouslie intreated them to repaire to his simple lodging, and remaine there till fortune should conuert her frownes into fauours, protesting that though he could not entertaine them as the qualitie of their condition required, yet he would supplie in good will the disabling defects of his low estate; and for the buying of a Farme (quoth he) come in good time, for my Landlord intends to sell both the Farme, hill, and the flocke I keepe, and cheape ye may haue them for readie mony: which wrought such cheerefulnes in their hearts, that they yeelded him millions of thanks, and accompanied him to his house. Into which when they entred, they found it not gorgeously embost, yet gailie trimmed: not courtlie, yet comely: though homely, yet handsome: and they were kindlie welcomed by Alexis wife, who greeted them with a merrie countenance, being by her husband certified of their fortunes. The next morne they lay long in bed, as wearied with the toile of vnaccustomed trauaile; but as soone as they got vp, they resolued there to set vp their rest, & by the help of Alexis , swapt a bargaine with his Landlord, and so became maisters of the Farme, & of the flock, her selfe putting on the attire of a Shepherdesse, and Lysimachus of a yong swaine, both esteemed famous amongst ye Shepheards of Arcadia . Liuing thus iointly together, they began to be as Ciceronicall, as they were amorous, with their hands thrift coueting to satisfie their hearts thirst,  & to be as diligent in labours, as they were affectionate in loues, so that the parish wherein they liued so affected them for the course of their life, that they were counted the very mirrours of a Democraticall methode. Liuing thus in a league of vnited vertues, fortune enuying their prosperitie, raised vp one Maechander to race & beate down if it were possible, the firme foundation of their faithfull building, and biding together. For this Maechander glauncing his gazing eyes on the blazing beautie of Varrona receiued so deepe an impression of her perfection in his heart, that immediately he fixed his fancie vpo her comely corps. And being the chief ruler of the citie, he perswaded himself that there was none in that town so stout, but would stoupe at his lure: nor any so faire, but would faine imploy theselues to pleasure him: but one the other side, the renowned vertue of Varrona came to his mind, which perswaded an impossibilitie to his purpose: and floating thus betweene hope and dispaire, he entred into these tearmes. O miserable wretch that I am, to whom shall I addresse my complaints? Is it the heauenly power & gods of loue that haue depriued me of my senses, & shewed their diuine working in me? Or is it the hellish hags, and spirits of spight, that bereaued me of reason, & executed their crueltie on me? Is it loue that leadeth me to this lust? or is it hate yt haleth me to this hurt & mischiefe. No, no, the Gods guide vs to goodnes, the furies of hell they force vs to filthines: neither doth that any way deserue the name of loue, which bringeth such torment to my troubled minde, yt all the diuels in the world could not performe the like. But see my rashnes, why am I so blindly bold, beastly to blaspheme against yt which proceeds altogether from nature, which nature hath imparted to all men, and which I ought to follow without repining or resisting? for so long as I follow nature as my guide, I cannot doe amisse, & seeing nature hath taught vs to loue, why should I not rather proue her precepts, then rebuke that which by natures lore is allowed? And touching torment of mind, or other inconuenience that it bringeth, is it all able to impaire the least comfort which I shall enioy in embracing my Varrona ? Is it not meete that he which would reape, should sowe, he that would gather frute, should plant trees, he that would reach the sweete rose, should now and then be scratched with the sharpe briers? I meane, is it meet, if I purpose to possesse so proper a peece as Varrona is, yt I should eschew labours, or refuse any perrill in the purfute thereof? And herevpon he determined to follow the furie of his fancie, what pangs or danger soeuer he thereby indured, & hauing resolued many waies in his mind how he might aspire to his purpose, at length he resolued vpon this, to institute a sumptuous banket: whereto he inuited the chiefe of the citie, amongst whom Lysimachus & his wife Varrona were not forgotten, the onely authours of the feast. Now for the more royall receiuing of his guests, he met them at the entrie into his pallace, and gaue them this greeting. Faire Ladies, as I am right ioyfull of your presence, so am I no lesse sorrowfull for the paines you haue taken, in vndertaking so great a iourny this darke and mistie euening, for the which I must account my selfe so much the more beholding to you, by how much greater your labour was in coming, and by how much lesse your cheere shall be able to counteruaile it now you are come. And taking Varrona by the hand, he said softlie vnto her. I pittie the paines of these gentlewomen the lesse, for that you were in their company, whose piercing eyes, as celestiall starres, or heauenly lamps, might serue for lights in the darke, whose sweete face might perfume the aire from all noysome smells which might annoy them, & beholding your liuely looks, & perfect shape, they might take such delight, that the wearinesse of the way could nothing molest or grieue them. Varrona hearing her selfe so greatly praised of so great a personage as he was, could not keepe the roses red out of her alablaster cheekes, & thinking no serpentine malice to lie hid vnder these merrie & sugred words, she gaue him this courteous answere. If sir the company had made no better prouision for lights, and other things necessarie, then such as you speake of, they might soone haue slipt into the mire: but as I perceiue by your words, you are disposed to iest, and be merrie, so I am content for this once to be made the instrument thereof, thereby to ease some part of the paines which you are like to take in receiuing such troublesome guests as we are: and for our cheere you neede take no thought, for it shall be so much too good for vs, by how much lesse we haue deserued any at all your hands. After this amorous encounter, he caused the company to sit downe to the banquet, and so disposed the matter that Varrona sat at the table right ouer against him, whereby he freely fed his eyes on that meat which couerted rather to the norishment of sicknes, then to wholesome humors of health. For as the finest meats, by one in extremitie of sicknes, resolue not to pure blood, to strengthen the bodie, but to watrish humours to feed the feuer and disease, so though her face and lookes were fine and sweet, and brought delight to all the beholders eies, yet to him they wrought onely torment & vexation of mind. And notwithstanding he perceiued her beauty to breed his bane, and her lokes to procure the losse of his libertie, & that as the Cocatrice by sight only slaieth, so she by curteous countenance only killed & wounded his heart, yet would he not refraine his eyes from beholding hir, but according to the nature of the sickly patient, which chiefly desireth that which most of all is forbidden him, he so incessantly threw his passionate glaunces towards her, that his eyes were altogether bleared with her beautie, and she also at the length began to perceiue his louing looks towards her, which made her looke pale, in token of the little pleasure she tooke in his toyes, & of the great feare she had least some other shuld mark them, wherby her good name might come in question. The banquet being ended, euery one of the prepared themselues to heare a stage play, which was the readie to be performed: But Maechander being able to play but one part, which was of a poore distracted louer, determined to goe forward with the tragedie alreadie begun betweene Varrona and him, and seeing her set out of her husbands sight, placed himselfe by her, and entered into reasoning with her, to this purpose. If (faire Varrona ) this simple banquet had bene so sweet and pleasant to your seemely selfe and the rest, as your sight is delightfull to me, I am perswaded you would not haue changed your cheer for Nectar and Ambrosia , which the Poets faine to be foode of the gods, but seeing there was no cause of delight in the one, & the other containeth that in it which may cotent the Gods theselues, I shal desire you in good part to accept the one, and courteously to accept me worthy to enioy the other. And though I haue not heretofore by dutifull seruice manifested vnto you the loyaltie of my loue, yet if my poore hart could signifie vnto you the assaults which it hath suffered for your sake, I doubt not but that you would confesse, that by force of loue I had woon you, & were worthy to weare you. For albeit by humane lawes your husband onely hath interest in you, yet by natures lawes, which being more ancient, ought to be of more authoritie, he ought to enioy you, which ioyeth most in you: which loueth you best, & endureth most paine for your sake. And for proofe of natures lawes, may it please you to consider the qualitie of the she wolfe, who alwaies chooseth that wolfe for her make, who is made most leane and foule by following her: besides that, my tytle marcheth vnder the ensign of iustice, which is a vertue: giuing to euery one according to his deserts: & that the reward of loue, is onely loue againe, I know you are not ignorant. For all the Gods in the world are not able to requite good will, the one belonging to the mind, the other incident to the bodie: but from the equitie of my cause I appeale to your good grace & fauour: and at the barre of your beautie, I humbly hold vp my hands, meaning to be tryed by your owne courtesie, & my owne loyaltie, & minding to abide your sentence either of cosent vnto life, or denial vnto death. Varrona hearing this discourse, looked one while read for shame, another while pale for anger: neither would disdain let her make him answer, nor grief giue her leaue to hold her peace: but stading in a maze, betweene silence and speaking, at length she brake of the one, and burst out into the other in this sort. If (sir) your banquet had bene no better, then this your talke is pleasant vnto me, I am perswaded the dishes would haue bene taken whole from the table without touching: but as the one was far better the the company deserued, so the other, for a far worse woman might more fitly haue seemed:  & if your sweet meat haue such sower sawce, the next time you send for me I will make you such an answere as was made to Craterus the Emperour by Diogenes , when he sent for him to make his abode with him in his court: who answered, he had rather be fed at Athens with salt, then to liue with him in all delicacie: so for my part, I promise you, I had rather be fed at home wt bread & water, the pay so deerly for dainty dishes. Touching the paines you haue endured for my sake, I take your words to be as false towards me, as you wold make my faith towards my husbad; But admit they were true, seeing I haue not bin ye cause of the, I count not my selfe bound in conscience to counteruaile them, only I am sory they were not bestowed on some more worthie your estate, and lesse worthie an honest name then my selfe, which being the chiefe riches I haue, I meane most diligently to keepe. The interest which cauellingly you claime in me, as it consisteth of false premises, so though they were true, yet the conclusion which you infer thereof followeth not necessarilie. For were it so that your loue were greater towards me then my husbands (which you cannot induce me to beleeue) yet seeing he by order of lawe hath first taken possession of me, your title succeeding his, your succession & sute must needs be cold & naught: for as your selfe saith of lawes so of titles, the first are euer of most force, and the most ancient of most authoritie. Your woluish example though it shew your foxely braine, yet doth it inforce no such proofe to your purpose, but that by my former reason it may be refelled, for that the wolfe is free from the proper possession of any: but therein truly you obserue decorum , in vsing the example of a beast in so brutish a cause: for like purpose like proofe: like man like matter. Your manly marching vnder the ensigne of iustice, if reason be your Captaine generall to leade you, I doubt not but soone to turne to a retire: for if it be good will which you beare me, I must needes grant you duly deserue the like againe, but when you are able to prooue it good will to deflowre my chastitie, to bereaue me of my good name, to dispoile me of my honour, to cause me to transgresse the bonds of honestie, to infringe my faith towards my husband, to violate the sacred rites of Matrimonie, with other innumerable enormities, when I say you are able to prooue these to proceede from affection, then will I willingly yeeld consent to your request. But see the vnreasonablenes of your suite, would you haue me in shewing courtesie towards you, commit crueltie towards my selfe? Should I in extending mercie to you, bring my selfe to miserie? Should I place you in pleasure, and displace my selfe of all ioy? For what solace can a woman purchase, hauing lost her chastitie, which ought to be the ioy, iewell, and iemme of all Gentlewomen of what calling and countenance soeuer? Your appeale from your owne cause to my courtesie, bewrayeth the naughtinesse thereof: for if it be not ill, why stick you not too it? if it be good, why appeale you from it? But seeing you haue constituted me iudge in this case, you know it is not the part of a iudge to deale partially, or to respect the man more then the matter, or to tender more my owne case then your cause: therefore indifferently this sentence definitiue I giue, I condemne you henceforth to perpetuall silence in this suite, and that you neuer hereafter open your mouth herein, being a matter most vnseemely for your honour, and most preiudiciall to my honestie: and in abiding this sentence (if you can be cotent with honest amitie) for the courtesie which I haue found at your hands, and for the good wil which you pretend to beare me, I promise you, you shal enioy the second place in my heart, and you shall finde me friendly in all things, which either you with reason can aske, or I with honestie grant. M aechander hauing heard this angell thus amiably pronouncing these words, was so rapt in admiration of her wisedome, and rauished in contemplation of her beautie, that though she had not inioyned him to silence, yet had he not had a word to say: and least his lookes might bewray his loue, and his countenance discouer his case, he secretly and sodainely withdrew himselfe into his chamber, to studie what face to set on the matter: and casting himselfe vpon the bed, after he had dreamed a while vpon his doating deuises, at length he awaked out of his wauering thoughts, and recouering the possession of his senses againe, he sung this mournefull Dittie. Amongst the great and mightie gods soiourne: And eke that present art with terreine wights, To cause their hearts with louers lawes to burne. To thee O God, whose bowe and golden shaft Doth wound both gods, and men alike: And causest euery one, to yeeld themselues to thee, And subiects to become, for all Dianaes spite. To thee I make, and sweare my fixed vowe, If I by help of thee, my wished ioyes attaine: Then must I onely praise thy mighty bowe, And subiect will to thee alwayes remaine. By this time the Play was ended, and his guests readie to depart, whereupon he was driuen to come forth of his chamber, to take leaue of them: and bidding his mistres good night, he gaue her such a looke, that his very eyes seemed to pleade for pittie: so that what his tongue durst not, his eyes did. His guests being gone, he disposed himselfe to rest, but loue willed him otherwise to employ that night, which was in examining particularly euery point of her answere. And though the first part seemed somewhat sharp and rigorous, and the second conteined the confutation of his cause, yet the third and last part seemed to be mixt with mettall of more milde matter, which he repeated to himselfe a thousand times, and thereupon, as vpon a firme foundation, determined to raise vp his building againe, which the two former parts of her answere had vtterlie ransackt to the ground. But mistaking the nature of the soyle whereon the foundation was laid, his fabrike (as if it had been set in the sand) soone came to ruine: for by that promise of friendship, which she kindlie made him, he sinisterly conceiued hope of obteining that, which she neither with honour could promise, nor with honestie performe: and feeding himselfe with that vaine hope, in great brauerie, as in a manner assured of the victorie, he wrote vnto her to this effect. are at libertie to bewray the secrets of my heart: and though you haue taken my heart prisoner, yet my head hath free power to pleade for release and reliefe. Neither would I you should count me in the number of those cowardly souldiers, who at the first Canon that roareth, giue ouer the siege: for I haue been alwayes setled in this opinion, that the more hard the fight is, the more haughtie is the conquest: and the more doubtfull the battaile, the more doughtie the victorie. And as it is not the part of a politike Captaine to put himselfe in perill, without hope of gaine or praise: so to winne the bulwarke of your brest, I count it a more rich bootie, then C aesar had in ransacking so many Cities: and a more rare praise, then euer Alexander had in subduing so many nations. And though my presumption may seeme great in assaulting one as is your sweete selfe, yet seeing in all degrees of friendship equalitie is chiefly considered, I trust you will cleare me of crime that way: neither would I you should thinke my flight so free, as to stoope at euery sta[illeg.]e For as the haughtie Hawke will not pray on carion, so neither will courtlie silks practise countrie sluts. But because I know that to be in you, which both concerneth my calling and consenteth with my fancie, I haue chosen you for the goddesse of my deuotions, humbly beseeching you, that it may not be said your name hath bin called vpon in vaine [illeg.]ereby you may loose that honour which I in zeale do owe vnto you. The benefit which you bestow on me, [illeg.] granting me the second place in your heart, as I must acknowledge, though somewhat vnthankfullie, so must I craue a greater, though somewhat imp[illeg.] For seeing [illeg.] whole heart and bodie are yours, me thinks [illeg.] of your [illeg.] amends. Weigh the matter[illeg.] vpright [illeg.] cast courteouslie, and take compassion on me spee[illeg.]en [illeg.] Yours altogether M aechander. My boate doth passe the straights of seas incenst with fire: Fild with forgetfulnesse, amidst the winters night: A blind and carelesse boy, (brought vp by fond desire) Doth guide me in the sea of sorrow and despight. For euery oare, he sets a ranke of foolish thoughts, And cuts (in stead of waue) a hope without distresse, The windes of my deepe sighes (that thunder still for nought,) Haue split my sailes with feare, with care and heauinesse. A mightie storme of teares, a blacke and hideous cloud, A thousand fierce disdaines, Doe slacke the tacklings oft, Till ignorance doth pull, and errour hale the shrowd, No starre for safetie shines, no Phoebe from aloft. Time hath subdued art, and ioy is slaue to woe, Alas (loue-guide) be kind, what, shall I perish so? Varrona hauing receiued and read this letter, was assayled diuersly: sometimes with sorrow, in thinking on the time she first saw him, or he her: sometimes with repentance of her former promise made him: sometime with pittie on his part: sometimes with pitie on her owne: but at length pittie vanquished pittie, and caused her to send this rough replie to his letter. honestie. little care you haue to satisfie that which I gaue you in charge. You would ill haue done as the knight Virle did, who at the comandement of his Ladie Lisia forbeare the vse of his tongue, and remained dumbe the terme of three yeares. But as you subtilly think to discharge your selfe of my iniunction, by writing, and not speaking, so by writing I simply do you vnderstand, that fro henceforth you looke for no more fauour at my hands, then at strangers, I will not say an enemies. For seeing my promise was but vpon codition, the codition being violated, my promise is void. And seeing you haue plaied the pelting marchant venturer, to hazard that good will and credit you haue had with me, to get more, the tempest of my iust displeased mind hath driuen your sute against the rough rockes of repulse, and you haue made shipwracke of al. Your couragious persisting in your purpose, proueth you rather a desperate sot then a discreet souldier: for to hop against the hill,  & stride against the streame, hath euer bene counted extreme folly. Your valiant venturing for a pray of value, proceeds rather of couetousnes then of courage: for the valiant souldier seeketh glory, not gaine: but therein you may be fitly resembled to the caterpiller, which cleaueth onely to the good friute: or to the moath, which most of al eateth the best cloth: or to the canker, which comonly breedeth in the fairest rose. The equalitie which you pretend to be betweene vs, is altogether vnequall, for both you exceed me in degree, and I excell you in honesty: so yt neither in calling or quality, ther is any equality between vs. Wheras you haue chosen me for your goddesse, I beseech you suffer me to remaine an earthly creature: and serue you that God which can bridle your wanton desires, and giue you grace to giue your neighbours leaue to liue honestlie by you, least you take his name in vaine, who will verily punish your vanitie at the length, though for a time he suffer you to wallow in your wickednes. For it is the prudent policie of God, to suffer the sinfull long time to swim in their sinne, to make their downfall more hideous, by their sodaine shrinking from prosperitie to aduersitie. For that is euer most bitter vnto him, who hath long time liued in prosperitie: neither must you thinke that that which is deferred is taken way. For as your selfe or any other, that oweth mony, though you defer your creditor for a time, yet you defraude him not altogether of his due: so, though God take daies with you for a time, yet assure your selfe he will pay you at the length: yea and perchance with large vsurie, besides the due debt. And this good counsaile take of me, as the last benefit which you shall euer receiue at my hands. Yours nothing at all, Varrona . M aechander hauing seene this rigorous resolution of his mistresse, went another way to worke, he suborned an old woman of the citie, wel seene in soliciting such sutes, to go vnto her and present her from him with many rich iewells, all which (he wiled her to tell) he would willingly bestow for one simple consent of her good will. The old woman bedlame (beldam I would haue said) hauing done his shameful message, said of her selfe in this sort. Surely mistresse Varrona , if the experience which old yeares haue giuen me, might craue credit for the counsaile which I shall giue you, I would not wish you to refuse the friendship of such a one as is Maechander , who is able to fil your purse with pearles, and fulfill you with pleasures euery way. Neither is it wisedome for you to spend your golden yeares, but in a golden pleasure, and not to be tied to one diet which bringeth sacitie and loathsomnesse, but to haue choice of change which bringeth appetite and lustinesse. The chast eares of Varrona not able to endure this base discourse, she cut of her ghostly counsel with these inuectiue words. Gentlewoman if you were endued with as many good conditions as you haue liued yeares, you would neuer haue vndertaken so shamefull a message: and were it not more for reuerence of your yeares, then in respect of your errand, I would make your filthie trade of life so famous, that you should euer hereafter be ashamed to shew your face in any honest companie. What doe you thinke, though mony can make you a bawd, that it can make me an harlot? and though you for gaine flee no filthynesse, that I for glorie follow no faithfulnesse either towards my spouse and husband, or towards my Lord and God? Doe you iudge me so couetous of coine, or so prodigal of my honour, that to get the one, I wil lose the other? Or doth he that sent you thinke so obiectlie of me, that gaine may more preuaile with me then good will, mony more then a man, iewells more then gentlenesse, pearles more then troubles which he hath endured for my sake? No let him vnderstand, if any thing could haue caused me to swarue from my duetie, loue not lure should haue allured me theretoo. But as I am fully resolued, faithfully to keepe my vowe, and promise made to my husband, so I beseech him not to bestow any more labour in attempting that, vnto which he shal neuer attaine: for before this my resolution shall be reuersed, he shall see the dissolution of my bodie into dust. But if he will not thus giue ouer his sute, he will cause me to make those priuie to his dealings, who will make him ashamed of them: and for your part, packe you hence with this your trumperie, to those which measure their honour by the price of profit, and their glorie by the guerdon of gaine. This good old subaudi gentlewoman being gone away with a flea in her eare, Varrona began to thinke on the matter with aduised deliberation, and entered into reasoning with her selfe in this sort. What fearefull follie is this in me to contemne the friendship of so great a Lord, whom the brauest Ladie in this land would willingly receiue for husband, and I rigorouslie refuse for seruant? What is that honour whereupon I stand so stiffely? Shall it not rather increase my dignitie, to haue so noble a seruant? And what is that chastitie which I seeke so charily so keepe? Do not some men say, that women alwayes liue chastly ynough, so that they liue charily ynough: that is, so that they conueigh their matters so couertly, that their doings be not commonly knowne: for otherwise to incontinencie were added impudencie; likewise for a woman to enter in conuersation with a rascall of no reputation, cannot be but a great blemish to the brightnesse of her name: for a foule adulterer, is euer worse then adulterie it selfe. And is it not a great signe she loatheth her husband, when she liketh one better, which is euery way worse? But to haue a friend of reseruation whose very countenance may credit her husband, methinks cannot be no great dishonour, either to the one, or to the other. What discredit was it to Helen , when she left her husband Menelaus and went with Paris to Troy? did not the whole glorie of Greece to her great glorie goe in armes to fetch her againe? And if she had not been counted a peece of price, or if by that fact she had defaced her honour, is it to be thought the Gr aecians would haue continued tenne yeeres in warre continually to win her againe? But to leaue honour and chastitie, and come to commoditie and safetie, what do I know what perils will follow of this repulse? Is it likely Maechander will put vp this reproch patiently? May I not iustly looke to haue his loue turned to hate, and that he will either by tyrannous meanes seeke the subuersion of my husband, or by treacherous designements worke the ouerthrow of me, and my good name? For the first, Edward a King of England may serue for an example, who when the Countesse of Salisbury would not consent to content his incontinent desire, he so raged against her parents and friends, as that the father was forced to perswade his owne daughter to folly, and the mother as a bawde to prostitute her to the Kings lust, and bring her to his priuie chamber. For the second, the Earle of Pancaliar may serue for testimonie, who when the Dutchesse of Sauoy would not yeeld to his lasciuious lust, wrought such wiles, that she was condemned for adulterie, and iudged to suffer most shamefull death by burning. Now to preuent either of these perils, it lieth in my power: and seeing of euils the least is to be chosen, I thinke it better then to hazard life, liuing, or good name, to loose that which shall be no great losse to my husband or my selfe: for as the Sunne though it shine on vs here in Arcadia , yet it giueth light likewise to those which are in England , and other places, so is there that in me wherewith Lysimachus may be satisfied, and M aechander sufficed. And this encourageth me thereto the rather, for that I see by experience in most of my neighbours, that those are euer most made of, who that way deale most falsely with their husbands. Besides that, how openly soeuer they deale in these affaires, their husbands neuer heare of it: and though they do, yet will they not hearken vnto it: and albeit they do in a manner see it, yet will they not beleeue it: and though thereto they giue credance, yet will they loue them the better, to haue them leaue it the sooner. Againe, what know I whether my husband deales falsely with me, and rowe in some other streame, which if it be so, I shall but saue his soule in paying his debts, and exercise the vertue of iustice in requiting like for like. And touching the corruption of my bloud, I thinke it made more noble, in participating with one of more dignitie then is my husband. But canst thou harlot call him husband whom thou meanest so wickedly to betray? Am I in my wits to vse these senselesse words? Is it my mouth that hath vttered this blasphemie? or was it the Diuell within me that deliuered it foorth? No if I were guiltie but in thought hereto, I would restore the fault with criminall pennance: yea if I felt any part in me apt to any such euill, I would cut it off, for feare of infecting the rest of the body. Good God whither now is honour fled, which was euer wont to be the fairest flower in my garland? whither now is chastitie banished, which hath been alwaies the chiefest stay of my state? shall the sunne of my shining life be now eclipsed with an act so filthie, that the very remembrance thereof is no lesse grieuous then death? Why was Helen for all her heauely hew any other accounted then a common harlot? and was it not onely to be reuenged on her, and on her champion Paris that the Grecians continued their siege so long? And touching the inconueniences which may incurre by this refusall, is any euill worse then dishonestie? Is there any thing to be feared more then offence? Is not the losse of goods lesse then of ones good name? Is not an honorable death to be preferred before an infamous life? And touching the Countesse before rehearsed, had she euer married with the King if she had not cotinued in her constancie to the end? And for the Dutchesse of Sauoy , what hurt susteined she by that false accusation? did it not make her glorie and vertue shew more splendentlie to the view of the whole world? yes no doubt of it. For like as streames the more you hinder their current, the greater is the deluge, or as the hearb Camomile, the more it is suppressed, the more it spreadeth abroade: euen so vertue and honestie, the more they are wronged with enuie, the more they eleuate and extend their flourish: for honour euermore is the reward of vertue, and doth accompany it as duly as the shadow doth the body. And as the Sunne though it be vnder a cloude keepeth still his brightnesse, albeit by vs it cannot be discerned: so vertue though it be darkened with diuelish deuises, yet it reserueth her power and vigour still, though to vs it seeme vtterly to be extinguished: so that so long as I remember vertue and honestie, I neede not care what man, what malice, or the diuell can deuise against me. No, no, sweete husband, I will not make thee ashamed to shew thy face amongst the best of them: and I will let thee vnderstand the villanie which that viper M aechander indeuoureth to do thee. And shall I deale so fondly indeede? Is not the repulse punishment ynough, vnlesse I bewray his doings to Lysimachus , and so procure him further displeasure? yea, I might thereby be occasion to set them together by the eares, whereby it might fall out (as the euent of battaile is alwayes doubtfull) that my husband might be hurt, or slaine, and the common report would be (as the people are euer prone to speake the wrost) that I, being an ill woman, had conspired his confusion and set Maechander to sley him. And though no such thing chaunced (as God forbid it should) yet this at least I should be sure to get by it, that my husband euer after would be iealous ouer me, and right carefull would he be to keepe that which he sawe others so busily to seeke. And (such is the malice of men) perchance he would iudge some light behauiour in me to be the cause that encouraged Maechander to attempt my chastitie. For men haue this common opinion amongst them, that as there is no smoake but where there is fire, so sieldome is there any feruent loue, but where there hath been some kindnes shewed to kindle ones desire. Moreouer, this toy may take him in the head, that it is a practise betweene vs two to preuent suspition, and cloake our loue: and with the firme perswasion of my inuincible chastitie, to lull him a sleepe in securitie, and then most to deceiue him, when he least suspected guile. And if at any time he heare of it by others, I may stop his mouth with this, that I my selfe told him of it, which if I had meant to deale falsely with him, I would not haue done. Yea what know I whether he will like the better or worse of me, for breeding such a bees nest in his braine? Lastly, I should derogate much from my owne chastitie, and in a manner accuse my selfe of pronenesse to fall that way, as though I were not strong ynough to withstand his assaults without the assistance of my husband. Yes God, in whom I repose my trust, shall fortifie me against the furie of my foes, and giue me grace with wisedome to escape his wiles, with charinesse to eschew his charmes, and with pietie to resist his prauitie. Now to returne to Maechander: so soone as that old bawde had related vnto him at large the answere of his mistres, he fell from the place where he sate, flat vpon the ground, and lay in a traunce a great while: and now those sparkes which before loue had kindled in him, were with continuall sighes so blowne, as it were with a paire of bellowes, that they brake forth into fierie flames, & that which before was fancie, was now turned into furie. For being come to himselfe, or rather being quite past himselfe, with staring lookes, pale countenance, with fierie eyes with gnashing teeth, with trembling tongue, in rage he roared forth these words. And shall I thus be frustrate of my desire? shall I with words and workes, with prayers and presents, pursue the good will of a daintie disdaining dame, and receiue but labor for my loue, and greefe for my affection? But oh franticke foole, why doe I in a furie rage against her, who is the most faire and courteous creature vnder heauen? No, it is that churle Lysimachus that soweth the seed of my sorrow, it is his seueritie towards her, that causeth her crueltie towards me, the feare which she hath of him, is the cause, she dareth not take compassion on my afflictions. And shall he swim in blisse, and I lie drencht in deepe dispaire? shall he be ingorged with pleasure, and I pine away in paine? No I will make him feele that once, which he maketh me feele a-thousand times a day. And herevpon determined with himselfe by some meanes or other, to procure the death of Lysimachus , thinking thereby the sooner to obtaine his purpose of his wife. And calling vnto him one of his swearing swash-buckler seruants, he layde before him the platforme of his purpose, and told him plainly if he would speedily dispatch Lysimachus out of the way, he would giue him a thousand crowns in his purse, to keepe him in another country. His seruant though altogether past grace, yet for fashion sake began to aduise his master more wisely, saying. For my owne part it maketh no matter, for an other countrie is as good for me as this, and I count any place my country where I may liue well and wealthily: But for your selfe, it is requisite that extraordinary care be added, in regarde that your loue towards Varrona is kowne to diuers of this cittie, by reason wherof, if I should comit any such fact, it must needs be thought that you are accessarie thereto, which will turne, though not to your death, (for that none hath authoritie aboue you to execute the rigour of the lawes vpon you) yet to your vtter shame and reproach it cannot but conuert. Tush (said his maister) the case is light where counsaile can take place: what talkest thou to me of shame, that am by iniurious and spitefull dealing depriued of the vse of reason, and dispossessed of my wits and senses. Neither am I the first that haue played the like part. Did not Dauid the chosen seruant of God, being blasted with the beautie of Bersheba , cause her husband Vrias to be set in the vanward to be slaine, which done he maried his wife? And why is it not lawfull for me to doe the like? But I know the worst of it, if thou wilt not take it vpon thee, I will either performe it my selfe, or procure some other that shall. The man seeing how his maister was bent, both to satisfie his mind, and to gaine so great a summe of mony, consented assoone as opportunitie would giue him leaue to murther Lysimachus: wherewith Maechander remayned somewhat appeased, hoping now to be inuested into the throne of his delights. But the ground of this vnnaturall deuise was most strangely detected. For all their consultations were ouerheard by Conscionato , an other of Maechanders men, but more religiously addicted, being then resident in a chamber neere adioyning vnto that place wherein those things were thus debated. He vtterly condemning his maisters too much luxurious thoughts, and greatly misliking his fellowes impudent promise, but especially affecting Lysimachus as a man in whom the true sparkes of vertue were eminent, made manifest incontinently the whole conspiracie, which Maechander for the loue of his wife had deuised against him, desiring him not to account him a traytor for bewraying his maisters counsel, but to thinke that he did it for conscience: hoping that although his maister inflamed with desire, or incensed by lust, had imagined such causelesse mischiefe, yet when time should asswage his desires, and moderate his affections, that then he would count him as a faithfull seruant, that with such care had kept his maisters credit. Lysimachus had not fully heard the man tell forth his tale, but a quaking feare possessed al his limmes, thinking that there was some plot wrought, and that the fellow did but shadowe his craft with these false colours; wherefore he began to wax in choller, and said that he doubted not Maechander , sith he was his friend, and there had neuer as yet bene any breach of amitie: he had not sought any wayes to wrong him, with slaunderous speeches to offend him, by sinister reports to molest his patience: but in word and thought he rested his at all times: he knewe not therefore any cause that should moue Maechander to seeke his death, but suspected it to be a compacted knauerie of some, to bring the gentlewoman and him at oddes. Conscionato staying him in the middest of his talke, told him, that to dallie with suspected friends, was with the Swans to sing against their death: and that if some had intended any such secret mischiefe, it might haue bene better brought to passe, then by reuealing the conspiracie: therefore he did ill to misconsture of his good meaning, sith his intent was to hinder murther, not to become a murderer: and to cofirme his promise, if it pleased him with his wife to flee out of Arcadia for the safegard of his life, he would goe with him, and if then he found not such a practise to be pretended, let his imagined treacherie be repayed with most monstrous torments. Lysimachus hearing the solmne protestation of the seruant, attributed credit thereto, willing him to abide at his house a day or two, that thereby the man which should accomplish this stratageme being discouered, he might with more securitie auoide the ensuing danger. Now when the day was growne by many houres aged, Conscionato who had giuen Lysimachus to vnderstand of this intended purpose might espy where his fellow Christophero de mala mente came posting to his house amaine, which thing after Lysimachus had knowne, arming himselfe for the purpose, as hauing a sword obscured by the couerture of his cloake, walked downe a groue, which Christophero perceiuing, and seeing none neer for his succour, with his cutlax violently rushed vpon him: but Lysimachus hauing euermore an eye vpon him, with facilitie auoided the blowe, and with such courage threw him to the ground, falling vpo his chest with so willing a waight, that Christophero yeelded nature her due, and Lysimachus the victorie. He forthwith informed the chiefe officers of the cittie of these accidents, who examining very effectually the matter, found Maechander a doating leacher, wherupon they not only amersed him a great fine to be paid to Lysimachus and Varrona , but put him for euer after from bearing any office in that cittie. Thus where these two louers deliuered from their enemies, and reckoned now famous for their vertues through all Arcadia . This strange euent spread abroade through all the countrie, and as fame flies swift and farre, so at length it came to the eares of Syllanus , who hearing by sundry reports the fame of their forwardnesse, how Lysimachus coueted to be most louing to his daughter, and she most dutifull to him, and both to striue to exceed one another in loyaltie, and glad at this mutuall agreement, he fell from the furie of his former melancholy passion, and satisfied himselfe with a contented patience, that at last he directed letters to his sonne in law, that he should make repaire to his house with his daughter. Which newes was no sooner come to the eares of this married couple, but prouiding for all things necessarie for the furniture of their voiage, they posted as fast as they could to the sea coast. Where taking shippe, and hauing a prosperous gale, in a day and a night they were set on shore in Thessalia : who speedily arriuing at their fathers house, found such friendly entertainment at the old mans hand, that they counted this smile of fortune able to counteruaile all the contrarie stormes that the aduerse Planets had inflicted vpon them. Syllanus for ye safe recouery of his daughter, surprised with exceeding great ioy, writ the last end of his liues leged. Lysimachus after the death of his father in lawe was created Duke of Hypata , and being willing to recompence old Procyon , of a shepheard made him a knight. Toxeus was preferred into the kings seruice, being substituted Captain of his guard: and because I will not blot from your thoughts the remembrance of all those actions. Conscioanato by act of parliament was made Baro of Cypera ,  & their farme in Arcadia made sure to Alexis , Et h aeredibus suis in perpetuu . These two louers thus floating in the top of louers gallantise, transtreated the sea of their life in so peaceable a calme, turning all their actions with the sweet consents of mutuall amitie, that they were accounted the onely presidents of married gouernment. What should I say? they liued a mirrour to men, a wonder to women, and a maze to all, which when it changeth expect for newes. Now to close vp this comicall Catastrophe with a tragicall stratageme, I will relate vnto you the historie of Valintine , brother to Lysimachus , and the fortunes of those two suborned villaines, as in the beginning hereof I promised. thought himself so surely seated, as no sinister chance or dismal influence might remoue. She that is costant in nothing but inconstancie, began in a faire skie to produce a tempest thus. It fell out as he frequented the court of Diocles King of Macedonia , that he fixed his eyes on the face of a noble gentlewoman, named Fuluia , daughter of Hermodius . And as the mouse mumpeth so long at the baite, that at length she is taken in the trap: so he bit so long at the baite of her beautie, that at length he was caught in Cupids snare. And on a time as she was at cardes in the presence chamber, this youth Valentine stood staring in her face in a great studie, which Fuluia perceiuing, to bring him out of it, prayed him to reach her a bowle of wine, which stood vpon a cupboord by: and as he approached therewith to the place of her presence, his senses were so rauished with the sight of her sweete face, that he let the bowle fall foorth of his hands, and retiring back with seemely shamefastnes, went for more, and being come therewith, she thanked him for his paines, saying, I pray God that the fall of the wine hinder not my winning, and bring me ill luck, for I know many that cannot away to haue salt, or drinke, or any such like thing fall towards them. Madame (said Valentine ) I haue often heard it disputed in Schooles, that such as the cause of euery thing is, such will be the effect, and seeing the cause of this chance was good, I doubt not but the effect will follow accordingly: and if any euill doth ensue thereof, I trust it will light on my head, through whose negligence it happened. Fuluia answered, as I know not the cause, so I feare not the effect, and in deede as you say, hitherto you haue had the worst of it, for that thereby you haue been put to double paines. If that be all (said he) rather then it shall be said any euill to haue ensued of this chance, I will perswade my selfe that euery paine which you shall put me to, shall be double delight, and vnto me treble contentation. You must vse (quoth she then) great eloquence, to perswade you to such an impossibilitie. Oh if it please you (said he) there is an Oratour which of late hath taken vp his dwelling within me, who hath eloquence to perswade to a farre greater matter then this. If (said she) he perswade you to things no more behoofefull for your selfe then this, if you will admit of my admonition, you shall not giue him house- roome long. Madame (replied he) it is an assured signe of a free and friendlie minde to giue good counsaile, but it is hard for one in bondage, and out of his owne possession to follow it. For what knowe you whether he hath alreadie taken entire possession of the house wherein he is, which if it be so, what wit is able to deuise a writ to remooue him from thence? If sir (said she) he entred by order of lawe, and paid you truly for it, it is reason he enioy it: mary your folly was great to reteine such a tenant: but if he intruded himselfe by force, you may lawfully exclude him by strength. Indeede (said he) he entred vi & armis , forcibly, but after vpon parley, I was content he should remaine in peaceable possession, mary as yet he paid me nothing, but he promiseth so frankly, that if the performance follow, a house with beames of beaten gold, and pillars of precious stones, will not counteruaile the price thereof: yet if I were placed in quiet possession of it, I would thinke my selfe richer, I will not say then the King, but which is more, then God himselfe, who ruleth heauen and earth. And as the hope of obteining the effect of that promise heaueth me vp to heauen, so the doubt to be deceiued thereof driueth me downe to hell. And what iollie fellow (said she) is this that promiseth so franklie? will he not promise golden hils, and performe dirtie dales? Would to God (said he) your seemely selfe were so well acquainted with him as I am, then would I make you iudge of the worthinesse of the thing he hath promised, for that you know the goodnes thereof, none better. The Lady smelling the drifts of his deuises, and seeing the end of his talke seemed to tend to loue, and that touching her owne selfe, thought not good to draw on their discourse any longer, but concluded with this answere. As I am altogether ignorant what your obscure talke meaneth, so care I not to be acquainted with any such companie as is your Landlord, for so (me thinks by you) I may more fitlie call him, then tearme him your tenant: and so departed away into her lodging. Valentine likewise his mistres being gone, gate him to his Chamber to entertaine his amorous conceipts, and being alone, brake foorth into these words. O friendly fortune, if continually hereafter thou furiouslie frowne vpon me, yet shall I all the dayes of my life count my selfe bound vnto thee, for the onely pleasure which this day thou hast affoorded me, in giuing me occasion to talke with her, whose angels voice made such heauenly harmonie in my heauie heart, that where before it was plunged in perplexities, it is now placed in felicitie: and where before it was oppressed with care, it is now refreshed with comfort. Yea euery looke of her is able to cure me, if I were in most deepe distresse of a most dangerous disease: euery sweet word proceeding from her sugred lips, is of force to fetch me from death to life. But alas how true do I try that saying, that euery commoditie hath annexed vnto it a discommoditie? How doth the remembrance of this ioy put me in mind of the griefe, which the losse of this delight will procure me? yea it maketh all my senses shake, to thinke that some other shall enioy her more woorthie of her then my selfe: and yet who in this court, nay in all Christendome, nay in the whole world, is woorthie of her? No, if she neuer haue any, vntill euery way she haue one worthie of her, she shall neuer haue any. And shall I then, beeing but a poore Gentleman, seeke to insinuate my selfe into a place so high? Shall I by my rude attempt purchase at least the displeasure of her friends and parents, and perchance of hers also, whome to displease would be no lesse offensiue vnto me then death? Alas, and must loue needes be rewarded with hate? must curtesie be counteruailed with crueltie? must good will be returned with displeasure? Is it possible that bountie should not abide, where beautie doth abound? and that courtesie should not associate her comelinesse? Yes, I am sure at the least she will suffer me to loue her, though her yong yeeres, and high estate will not suffer her to affect me: and though she will not accept me for an husband, yet I am perswaded she will not reiect me for a seruant: and though she will not receiue my seruice, yet I doubt but she will affablie take the tendring thereof vnto her. And touching her parents displeasure, what care I to procure the ill will of the whole world, so I may purchase her good liking. Yea, if I should spend the most precious bloud in my bodie, in the pursuite of so peerelesse a peece, I woulde count it as well bestowed, as if it were shead in the quarrell of the Gods, my Prince, or countrie. For she is ye Goddesse whom with deuotion I will adore: she is the prince, whome with dutie I wil obey: she is the countrie in whole cause I will spend my life, liuing, and all that I haue. Neither is there such cause why her friends should much storme at the matter: for my lands and reuenewes are such, as that they will not suffer me to want any thing pertaining to my estate and degree. Why Alearne a youth like my selfe, being inamoured with Ardalesia daughter to the mightie Emperour Otho stole her away, and married her: and do I sticke to attempt the like with one of farre meaner estate, though of farre more worthinesse? And albeit frowning Fortune tossed him for a while in the tempestuous seas of aduersitie, yet at the length he arriued at the hauen of happie estate, and was reconciled to the good grace of the Emperour againe. And though at the first my ship be shaken with angrie blasts, yet in time I doubt not but to be safely landed on the shore, and haue my share of that which the shewers of shrewde fortune shall keepe me from. He is not worthy to suck the sweete, who hath not first sauoured the sower: And as the beautie of a faire woman, being placed by a foule, blazeth more brightly, so each ioy is made more pleasant, by first tasting some sower sops of sorrow. Did not the perrill which Leander ventured in the Ocean, and the paine which he tooke in swimming, make his arriuall to the hauen of his heauenly Hero more happie and pleasant? yes no doubt of it: for besides the feeling of the present pleasure, the remembrance of the danger past delighteth. Besides that, by how much more a man hazardeth himselfe for his mistresse sake, by so much the more he manifesteth the costancie of his soule, and meriteth solace at her hands the more worthily. This saying also is no lesse tried then true, that fortune euer fauoureth the valiant: & things the more hard, the more haughtie, high & heauenly: neither is any thing difficult to be by him accomplished which hardly enterpriseth it. With that he tooke a Lute in his hand and played a note to a dittie which he sung as followeth. I would thou wert not faire, or I were wise, I would thou hadst no face, or I no eyes: I would thou wert not wise, or I not fond, Or thou not free, or I not so in bond. But thou art faire, and I cannot be wise, Thy sunlike face, hath blinded both mine eyes: Thou canst not be but wise, nor I but fond, Nor thou but free, nor I but still in bond. Yet am I wise to thinke that thou art faire, Mine eyes, their purenesse in thy face repaire: Nor am I fond, that doe thy wisedome see: Nor yet in bond, because that thou art free. Then in thy beautie onely make me wise, And in thy face, the Graces guide mine eyes: And in thy wisedome onely see me fond, And in thy freedome keepe me still in bond. So shalt thou still be faire, and I be wise: Thy face shines still vpon my cleared eyes: Thy wisedome onely see how I am fond: Thy freedome onely keepe me still in bond. So would I thou wert faire, and I were wise: So would I thou hadst thy face, and I mine eyes: So would I thou wert wise, and I were fond, And thou wert free, and I were still in bond. With these, and such like sayings, encouraging himselfe, he purposed to pursue his purpose, and fayled not daily to attend vpon his mistresse with all dutie and diligence, & sought all occasions he could to let her vnderstand his loyal loue, and great good will towards her: which she perceiuing, disdayned not to acknowledge by her amiable and courteous countenance towards him, wherewith he held himselfe as well satisfied, as if he had bene made Monarch of the whole world. And though he were oft determined in words to present his sute vnto her, yet when it came to the point he should haue spoken, feare of offending her altogether disappointed his purpose, and made him mute in the matter which he minded to vtter. But at length perceiuing that delay bred danger, for that she had many other suters, and feeling by experience, that as fire, the more it is kept downe, the more it flameth vp: so loue, the more he sought to suppresse him, the more fiery forces within him he expressed: he beganne to set feare aside, and to force a supply of courage in his faint heart, and seeing his mistresse sit in the presence alone, he entred into reasoning with her in this manner. Madam, for that I see you without company, I am the bolder to presume to prease in place, whereof though I be altogether vnworthy, yet am I willing to supply it: and if my company may content you, as well as your sight satisfieth me, I doubt not but you will accept it in good part: and so much the lesse I hope my copany shall be cumbersome vnto you, for that you are busied about nothing whereso my presence may be preiudiciall. And verily when I consider the common course of life, which your sweet selfe, and other maydes of your estate leade, me thinkes it is altogether like the spending of your time at this present, which is (with your leaue be it spoken) idly, vnfruitfully, without pleasure, without profit. And if my credit were such with you, to craue beleefe for that which I shal speake, I would not doubt but to perswade you to another trade of life; more commendable to the world, more honorable amongst all men, and more acceptable in the sight of God. For beleeue me I pittie nothing more then virgins vaine pittie, who thinke they merit reward for liuing chastly, when in deed they deserue blame for spending their time so wastly. Sir (said she) as your company contenteth me well enough, so your talke liketh me but a little: for though I must confesse I sit at this present without doing any thing, yet in my fancie it is better to be idle, then ill imployed as your selfe is now, in reprehending that state of life which excelleth al others, as farre as the Sunne doth a star, or light darknesse: and wherin I meane, for my part, to passe the pilgrimage of this my short life, if either God dispose me not, or my friends force me not to the contrary. God forbid Madame (said he) you should continue your time in any such trifling trade of life, which indeed is to be counted no life at all, as the Grecian Ladies can truely testifie, who (as Homer reporteth) reckon their age from the time of their marriage, not from the day of their birth: and if they be demaunded how old they be, they begin to number from their marriage, and so answere accordingly: for then onely (say they) we begin to liue, when we haue a house to gouerne, and may commaund our children and our seruants. Tush (said the Ladie) this is but the sentence and proper opinion of our peculiar people, who perchance by nature of their countrie or otherwise, are more desirous of husbands then other: neither is it any more reason that we should be tied to their example, then they bound to follow our virgin Vestals: or other, who consume the whole course of their life without contaminating their corps with the company of man. Nay rather (said he) without receiuing their perfection from men, according to the opinion of Aristotle . But Madame I did not produce that example as necessarie for all to follow, but as profitable to prooue and shew, what base account they made of virginitie, which you is highly esteeme of. But to leaue particular opinions, and come to generall constitutions and customes, I meane both natural, humane, and diuine lawes, and you shall see them all to make against you. And first if you consider natures, which in the doings of creatures without reason are plainely set downe, you shall behold no liuing wight in the world vniuersall, but that so soone as by age they are apt thereto, applie themselues to that life whereby their kind may be conserued, and number increased. Behold the high flying Falcon, which soareth so high in the aire, that a man would thinke she should neither stoupe to lure or lust: yet she is no sooner an Entermurer, or at the farthest a white Hawke, but that of her owne accord she commeth to the call of the Tersell-gentle her mate. Likewise the Doe, which flingeth so freely about the woods, as though she made no account of the male, yet she is no sooner a forressister, but that she seekes the societie of the Bucke. Yea if it would please your seemely selfe to enter into the consideration of your owne nature, or if your courtesie would deeme me worthie to haue the examination of your secret thoughts, I doubt not but you would confesse your selfe to feele a fierie force of that naturall inclination which is in other creatures: which being so, you must graunt to deale vnnaturally in resisting that motion which cannot be ill or idle, because nature hath planted it in you. For God and nature do nothing vainely, or after a vile manner. And in that some do amisse in rebelling against her, their owne scrupulous nicenesse is the cause, when they will impose vpon themselues heauier burdens then they are well able to sustaine, and refuse those which nature hath appointed them to beare, being indeede but light. What talke you sir (said she) so much of nature, and of creatures without reason, as though we ought to follow either the instinct of the one, or the example of the other. I haue been alwayes taught, that reason is the rule whereby our actions ought to be directed, and that we ought to lay before vs the deeds of creatures indued with reason to follow and imitate. For if you stick so strictly to the example of brute beasts, you should vse the company of women but once or twice at the most in a yeere, as most of them do with their females, whereto I am sure you would be loth to be tyed. Madame (replied he) a Gentlewoman of this citie hath alreadie answered this obiection for me. Why then (quoth she) will you condemne their doings in some points, and place them for patternes to be practised by other some? Yea why not (said he) otherwise you might generally take exception against the example of men, for that some men in some matters do amisse. The good euer is to be vsed, and the euill reiected. Doth not euery man so soone as his daughter is arriued to ripe yeeres, trauaile to bestow her in marriage, whereby she may enioy the fruites of loue, and participate with pleasures incident to that estate? whereby they plainely shewe that the cause why they beget them with pleasure, and bring them vp with paine, is to haue them enter into that trade of life, wherein not onely themselues may liue happily, abounding in all pleasure, but also by the fertill fruite of their bodie make their mortall parents immortall, that when they shall be blasted with age, and withered away, the issue of their seede may begin greenely to growe, and flourishly to spring, to the great comfort both of father and daughter. For what pleasure the Grandfather taketh in the sporting pastime of his proper daughters prettie children, I thinke you partly vnderstand: and what delight the mother taketh in the toyes of her little sonne, you soone shall perfectlie perceiue, if it please you freely to followe the friendlie counsaile which I frankly pronounce vnto you. For do you thinke, if virginitie were of such vertue, that parents would not rather paine themselues to keep their daughters modest maydes, then straine themselues and their substance to ioyne them in Iunoes sacred bond? Yes perswade your selfe, if your mother were so assured, she would rather lock you vp close in her closet, then suffer any to enioy the soueraigne sight of your beautie, or once aspire to your speech, whereby you might be perswaded to some other kind of life. But the experienced by yeeres knoweth what is best for your behoofe, and would you should follow hee example, and make no conscience to loose that which she herselfe hath lost, which except she had, we had mist so rare a iewell as your seemely selfe is, which what a detriment it had been to my selfe, I dare not say, least you should count vertue vanitie, and truth trifling flatterie. But to our purpose, you perceiue (as I said) your parents pleased with the accesse of Gentlemen vnto you, whereby you may conceiue their minde is you should accept such seruice as they profer, and partake with those pleasures which they prefer vnto you. Why sir (said she) you altogether mistake the meaning of men in this matter: for when fathers tender marriages to their daughters, it is not for any minde they haue to haue them married, but onely for feare least they should fall to follie other waies: for knowing the fickle frailtie of youth, and our propensities to grauitie, and weakenesse, they prouide vs marriages to preuent mischiefes: and seeing of euils the least is to be chosen, they count wedlock a lesse euill then the lightnes of our life and behauiour. Alas good Madame (said Valentine ) why do you so much prophane the holie state of Matrimony, as to count it in the number of euils, whereas the Gods themselues haue entred into that calling, whereas Princes pleasantly passe their time therein, whereas by it onely mankind is preserued, and amitie and loue amongst men continued, of the woorthinesse whereof I am not sufficient to open my lips. Sir (said Fuluia ) I speake it not of my selfe, but according to the opinion of the most wise and learned Philosophers that euer liued, amongst whom one Aminius so much misliked of marriage, that being demanded why he would not marrie, answered, because there were so many inconueniences incident to that estate, that the least of them is able to sley a thousand men. Why Madame (replied he) you must consider there is nothing in this mortall life so absolutely good and perfect, but that there be inconueniences as well as commodities thereby incurred: by that reason you may take the Sunne out of the world, for that it parcheth the Sommer greene, and banisheth away the beautie of those that therein blaze their faces. But to leaue naturall and humane lawes, and come to diuine precepts proceeding from Gods owne mouth, doth not God say, It is not good for a man to liue alone , and therefore made Eue for an help and comforter? Likewise in diuers places of Scripture he doth not onely commend marriage vnto vs, saying, Marriage, and the bed vndefiled are honourable , but also commaundeth vs to it, saying, You shall forsake father and mother, and follow your wiues . Why sir (said she) and doth not God say, It is good for a man not to touch a woman? And if thou be vnmarried, remaine so . But why alleadge you not this text, It is better to marry then to burne? whereby is plainely shewed, that marriage is but a meane medicine for the burning in concupicence and lust. But bicause we entred into these misteries, I could refer you to an historie, where it is reported that in heauen Uirgins chiefely serue God, and set foorth his glorie. And Mahomet the great Turke, when he was in heauen, said, he sawe there Uirgins, who if they issued from heauen would lighten the whole world with their brightnes, and if they chanced to spit into the sea, they would make the whole water as sweete as hony: but here is no mention of married folkes. Belike (said he) those Uirgins are like your selfe, and then no maruaile though God be delighted with the sight of them, which perchance is the cause he hath them in heauen to attend vpon him, as first Hebe and after Ganymedes did vpon Iupiter . But generally of women, the histories record, that by bringing foorth of children they shall be honoured, and inioy a place in heauen, which must be by marriage, if honestly. But because I am perswaded that it is only for argumet sake that you disalow marriage, and that you pretend otherwise in words, then you intend to do in works, I am content to giue you the honour of the field, and thus far to yeeld my consent to your opinion, that virginitie considered of it owne nature, simply without circumstance is better then matrimony: but because the one is ful of perill, the other fraught with pleasure: the one full of ieopardie, the other full of securitie: the one as rare as the blacke swanne, the other as common as the black crowe: of good things, I thinke the more common, the more commendable. If (said she) I haue gotten any conquest thereby, I thanke mine owne cause, not your courtesie, who yeelds when you are able to stand no longer in defence. Nay Madame say not so (quoth he) for in that verie yeelding to your opinion, I proued marriage better then virginitie, for that it is more common: neither would I haue you turne my silence in this matter in lacke of knowledge, or reprehend me, if I spare to inforce further proofe in a matter alreadie sufficiently prooued: no more then you would rebuke the spanniell, which ceaseth to hunt, when he seeth the hawke seazed on the partridge. But you may maruaile madam what is the cause that maketh me perswade you thus earnestly to marriage, which as mine owne vnworthynesse willeth me to hide, so your incomparable courtesie encorageth me to disclose, which maketh me thinke that it is no small cause which can make you greatly offended with him, who beareth you great good will, and that what sute soeuer I shall prefer vnto you, you will either graunt it, or forgiue it: pardon, or pittie it. Therefore may it please you to vnderstand, that since, not long since, I tooke large view of your vertue, and beautie, my heart hath bene so inflamed with the bright beames thereof, that nothing is able to quench it, but the water which floweth from the fountaine that first infected me: and if pittie may so much preuaile with you, as to accept me, I dare not say for your husband, but for your slaue and seruant: assure your selfe, there shal no doubt of danger driue me from my duetie towards you, neither shall any Ladie whatsoeuer haue more cause to reioyce in the choice of her seruant, then shall your selfe, for that I wil account my life no longer pleasant vnto me, then it shall be imployed in your seruice. Fuluia dying her little cheekes with vermilion red, and casting her eyes on the ground, gaue him this answere. As I am to yeeld you thanks for your good wil, so am I not to affoord consent to your request: for yt I neither mind to marrie, nor thinke my selfe worthie to retaine such a seruant. But if I were disposed to receiue you any way, I thinke the best manner meane enough for your worthinesse. Immediately hereupon there came company vnto them, which made them breake off their talke, and Fuluia being got into her chamber began to thinke on the sute made vnto her by Valentine: and by this time Cupid had so cunningly carued and ingraued the idoll of his person and behauiour in her heart, that she thought him worthie of a farre more excellent wife then her selfe: and perswading her selfe by his words and lookes, that his loue was loyall without lust: true without trifling, and faithfull without faigning, she determined to accept it, if her parents would giue thereto their consent. Now Valentine nothing dismayed with her former deniall, for that it had a courteous close, so soone as opportunitie serued, set on her againe in this sort. Now Madame you haue considered my case at leisure, I trust it will stand with your good pleasure to make me a more comfortable answere. I beseech you sir (said she) rest satisfied with my former resolution, for other as yet I can make you none. Alas Madame (quoth he) the extremitie of my passion will not suffer long prolonging of remorse, wherefore I humbly entreat you, presently to passe your sentence either of bale or blisse, of saluation or damnation, of life or death: or if the heauens haue conspired my confusion, and that you meane rigorously to reiect my good wil, I meane not long to remaine aliue to trouble you with any tedious sute: for I account it as good reason to honour you with the sacrifice of my death, as I haue thought it conuenient to bestow vpon you the seruice of my life. Alas (quoth she) this iesting is nothing ioyfull vnto me, and I pray you vse no more of it, for the remembrance of that which you vtter in sport, maketh me feele the force thereof in good earnest: for a thousand deaths at once cannot be so dreadfull vnto me, as once to thinke I liue to procure the death of any such as you are. If (said he) you count my words sport, iest, and daliance, assure your self it is sport without pleasure: iest without comfort: and daliance without delight, as tract of time shall truly manifest. But if you loue not to heare of my death, why like you not to giue me life? which you may doe onely by consent of your good will. Why sir (quoth she) you know my consent consisteth not in my selfe but in my parents, to whom I owe both duetie and honour, therefore first it behooueth you to demaund their consent. Why Madame (quoth he) shall I make more account of the meaner parts then of the head, you are the chiefe in this election, and therefore let me receiue one good word of your good will, and then let heauen and earth doe their worst. It is not the coyne, countenance or credit of your parents that I pursue: for to purchace such a treasure as is your good will, I could be content all the dayes of my life to be obnoxious vnto all calamities, so that you be mainteyned according to your desire and worthinesse. Well (said she) seeing I am the onely marke at which you shoote, assay by all meanes to get my friends good liking, and if you leuell any thing straight, me you shall not misse. Valentine vpon this procured the Kings letters (for in his fauour he was highly interested) to her father in this behalfe, who hauing pervsed them, said, he trusted the King would giue him leaue to dispose of his owne according to his pleasure, and that his daughter was too neere vnto him, to see her cast away vpon one, who for lacke of yeeres wanted wisedome to gouerne her, and for lacke of lands, liuing to mainteine her. And calling his daughter before him, he began to expostulate with her in this sort. Daughter, I euer heretofore thought you would haue been a solace and comfort to my old yeeres, and the prolonger of my life, but now I see you will increase my hoarie haires, and be the hastner of my death. Doth the tender care, the carefull charge, and chargeable cost which I haue euer vsed in bringing you vp, deserue this at your hands, that you should passe a graunt of your good will in marriage without my consent? Is the pietie towards your parents, and the duetie of a daughter towards her father, so vtterly forgotten, that you will prefer the loue of an vnthrift, before my displeasure; and to please him care not to offend your parents, who trauaile to bestowe you vpon one worthie your estate and ours? No, neuer thinke Valentine shall inioy you with my good will, and neuer take me for your father, if you graunt him your assent thereto. Fuluia hearing this cruell conclusion of her father Hermodius , with bashfull countenance and trembling tongue framed her answere in this fourme. I beseech you good father not to thinke me so gracelesse a childe, as once to imagin, much lesse to do any thing which may heape your heauinesse, or hasten your death, the least of which two, would be more bitter vnto me then death. For if it please you to vnderstand, I haue not granted my good will to any, vnlesse yours be thereto gotten. Neither haue I as you see preferred the loue of an vnthrift before your displeasure. But as I cannot let that noble Gentleman Valentine to loue me, so can I not, to confesse the truth, but loue him, mary in heart onely, for my bodie as you gaue it me, so shall you haue the disposing of it. And as I faithfully promise you by the loue which of duetie I owe you, that I will neuer haue any husband without your approbation, so I humbly begge of you, for the affection which by nature you beare me, that you will neuer force me to any without my good liking. For if for the transitorie life you haue giuen me, you make me pay so deerely, as to be linked with one against my will, I must needes count it a hard peniworth, and well may I wish that neuer I had beene borne. I beseech you (Sir) consider the inconueniences alwayes incident to those marriages, where there is more respect of money, then of the man: of honours, then of honestie: of goods, then of affection of the parties each to other. What strife, what iarres, what debate at bed, and at boord, at home, and abroade, about this, about that, neuer quietnes with contentation, neuer merrie countenance without counterfaiting, neuer louing deeds without dissimulation? And whence, but from this rotten roote springeth so many dishonest women, so many euill liuing men? Is it not the loathing of neuer liked lips, that maketh women stray from their husbands, to strangers? And is it not either the difference of yeeres, or the diuersitie of manners, or disagreement of natures, that maketh the husband forsake the wife, and follow other women? And where are any of these differences, or inequallities betweene the married, but where the force of friends, not libertie of loue, linketh them together. These things by your wisedome considered, I trust as you restraine me from one whom I loue, so you will not constraine me to any whom I loue not: in so doing doubt not but you shall find in me modestie meete for a mayd, vertue fit for a virgin, dutie beseeming a daughter, and obedience becomming a child. Her father hauing mildly heard her modest talke, told her, he meant not to force her to any, but would prouide her a husband, whom he doubted not should like her better euery way then Valentine did, and therefore willed her to race out of her minde the liking which she had conceiued of him: and so gaue her leaue to depart. And being in her Chamber, she began to deuise all the meanes she could to roote out of her heart the loue which she bare vnto Valentine , and reuoked to her memorie her fathers displeasure, and her owne preferment, with many other discommodities that way arising. But nothing preuailed, for as ye bird caught in lime, the Deare in a foyle, the more they striue, the faster they sticke, so the more diligentlie she laboured to get out of the laborinth of fancie, the more doubtfully was she therein intricated: and as one climbing on high, his feete failing, and he in danger to fall, more firmely fastneth his hold then before he did: so Loue, seeing himselfe readie to be dislodged out of her brest tooke such sure hold, and fortified himselfe so stronglie within her, that no vigour was of force sufficient to fetch him from thence. Which the good Gentlewoman perceiuing, thought best for her case and quiet, to yeeld the summons of loue, to be disposed at his pleasure, wherein no doubt she had reason. For as the swift running streame if it be not stopped runneth smoothly and without noise, but if there be any damme or locke made to stay the course thereof, it rageth, and roareth, and swelleth aboue the banks, so Loue, if we obey his lore, and yeeld vnto his soueraignitie: dealeth with vs gentlie, and like a louing Lord raigneth ouer vs, but if we withstand his force, and seeke to stay the passage of his power, he rageth ouer vs like a cruell tyrant. Which this Gentlewoman (as I said) perceiuing, without any more resistance determined in her heart to loue Valentine onely and euer. Now Valentine notwithstanding the angrie looke of the father, the frowning face of the mother, and the strange counterfait countenance of the daughter, followed his suite so effectuallie, vsed such apt perswasions to the maide, and in short time insinuated himselfe so farre into her familiaritie, that her parents lowred not so fast, but she allured as much, and thought she receiued no other contentation in the whole world but in his companie, which her parents perceiuing, and besides dreading the Kings displeasure, thought as good by their consent to let them goe togither, as by seueritie to keepe them asunder, whom the Gods seemed to ioyne togither: and so much the rather they were induced thereto, for that they sawe their daughter so affected to Valentine , that the hearing of any other husband was hatefull, and vnto her hurtfull. And hereupon the marriage was concluded, and consummated, and to this bargaine only the fancie of Valentine forced him. Now behold the nature and condition of fortune: for she hauing salued these men (namely Valentine , and the two rogues) a long while with roses, meant now to whip them with nettles, and hauing presented them with the brightnes of her fauours, now she crost them with many frownes. They that did thinke themselues the most fortunate amongst men, may now account theselues the most distressed of all men. For they hauing carelesly floated in the seas of voluptuousnes, and retchlesly reigned in the lazie seas of lawlesse libertie, where they fed on nought but loosenes and licentiousnes, whereby most prompt to wickednes, were wrapt in the performance of most desperate designements. For one of them named Delfridus was by the furies of hell so set on fire in libidinous lust towards his mistres Fuluia , that he sought all the meanes possible to win her to his wicked will, not much vnlike Maechander aboue mentioned: the other called Insolainder , was so instigated on with arrogancie, that he daily aucupated after the destruction of him who was the cause of his eleuation vnto prosperitie, vtterly casting behind them the remembrance of their former state and condition. This Insolainder was so blinded with promotion, that vpon hope of a little commoditie purchased by his maisters death, sought as (I said) by all meanes to worke his ruine: which being perceiued (for God will not suffer such vilde attempts to be practised) Valentine prosecuted the matter so earnestly against him, that hee was throwne into prison, where for shame of his deede, and dread of deserued punishment, he did himselfe desperately to death. Now Delfridus seeing his mistres too firmely fortified in vertue to be by consent vanquished by villanie, determined also by death to remoue the obstacle. And as nothing is so impossible which frantike furie will not enterprise, nothing so shamefull which vnbridled desire will not vndertake, nothing so false which fleshly filthines will not forge, so to bring his purpose to passe, as Valentine on a time (in ill time) passed through a blinde lane of the citie, he shrowded himselfe in a corner, and as he came by, shot him thorough with a Pistoll, which done, he forthwith repaired home, making grieuous lamentation (but in a counterfait manner) for the cruell murder of his most louing and affectionate maister as he tearmed him. Fuluia hearing of this vnnaturall deede, and by circumstances knowing Delfridus to be the authour thereof, tearing her haire, scratching her face, and beating her bodie against the ground, so soone as the flouds of teares had flowen so long that the fountaine was drie, so that her speech might haue passage which before the teares stopped, she began to crie out in this carefull manner. O God, what iniustice is this, to suffer the earth to remaine polluted with the bloud of innocents? Didst thou curse Cain for killing his brother Abell? and wilt thou not crucifie Delfridus for slaying Valentine? Is thy heart now hardened that thou wilt not, or are thy hands now weakened that thou canst not preserue thy seruants from the slaues of Satan? If there be no safetie in innocencie, wherein shall wee repose our selues? If thou be not our protector, who shall defend vs? If the wicked vanquish the vertuous, who shall set foorth thy honour and glorie? or who will so much as once call vpon thy name? But what meane I wretched wight to exclaime against God as the authour of my euill, whereas it is onely my selfe that am guiltie of my husbands death? It is I that pampred vp my beautie, to make it glister in the sight of euerie gazing eye, in the thriftlesse threed whereof this miscreant was intangled, that to vnwinde himselfe thereout, hee hath wrought all this mischiefe. It is I that would not detect his doings to the view of the world, whereby the perill which hung ouer my husbands head might haue beene preuented. And seeing I haue beene the cause of his death, shall I (beeing a murderer) remaine aliue? Did Halcyone seeing the dead carkasse of her husband Ceix cast on shore, willinglie cast her selfe into the Sea to accompanie his death? and shall I see my sweete beloued true Valentine slaine, and not drinke of the same cup? Did true Thisbe goare her gorgeous bodie with the same sword wherewith princely Pyramus had prickt himselfe to the heart? and are not my hands strong ynough to do the like? Did Iulietta die vpon the corps of her Romeo , and shall my bodie remaine on earth, Valentine being buried? No gentle death come with thy direfull dart, and pierce my painefull soule, and with one death rid me out of a thousand at once. For what thought do I thinke on my Valentine , which doth not procure me double death? What thing do I see belonging to him, which is not a treble torment vnto me? But it is cowardlinesse to wish for death, and courage valiantly to take it. Yes I can and will bestow my life for my Valentines sweete sake. But O God, shall the varlet remaine aliue to triumph in his treacherie, and vaunt in his villanie? Shall I not see his fatall day before my finall end? It is his blood that will be a most sweete sacrifice to the ghost of my Valentine: and then can I end my life contentedly, when I haue offred vp this acceptable sacrifice. And vntill such time as I haue opportunitie hereto, I will prolong my wofull dayes in direfull griefe, and only the hope of reuenge shall heauilie hold my loathsome life and sorrowfull soule together. For other cause why I should desire life I haue not, for that I am vtterly depriued of all ioyes of life. For as the bird that is bruised with some blow lieth aloft in the leaues, and heares his fellowes sing, and is not able to vtter one warbling note out of his mournefull voice, but rather hates the harmony which other birds do make, so I, my heart being broken, sit solitary alone, and see some hang about their husbands necks, some closely clip them in their armes, some trifle with them, some talke with them, all which redouble my paine, to thinke my selfe destitute of those pleasures: yea, to a wretched wounded heart that dwels in dole, euery pleasant sight turnes to bitter anguish, and the onely obiect which shall euer content my eyes, shall be the destruction of that Iudas which hath brought me to this desolation. Now Delfridus thinking that time had taken away her teares and sorrow, and supposing that neither she, or any other had suspected him for the murder of Valentine , began to enter into the lists of lust againe, and with a new encounter of incontinencie to set vpon her. But she so much abhorred him, that if she had but heard his name, it caused her nature to faile in her, and all her senses to faint: so that when he sawe no possibilitie to impell her to impietie, he meant to sollicite her in the way of marriage, and caused her neere kinsfolks and friends to moue his suite vnto her (for he was a man well countenanced of many) who laboured very earnestlie in the matter, and were so importunate vpon her, that no answere would satisfie them. Now Fuluia seeing she could not be rid of her friends, and foreseeing that by this meanes she might be freed from her enemie, agreed to take him to husband. And the day of solemnizing the marriage being come, they went togither to the temple of Diana , where all things according to custome being consummated, the Bride-wife (as the vse was) dranke to her husband in wine as he thought, but indeed in poison which she had prouided of purpose: and when she saw he had drunke vp his death, she said vnto him, Go now, and in steed of thy marriage bed get thee a graue, for thy marriage is turned to murder, a punishment iust for thy outragious lust, and mercilesse designement: for vengeance, asketh vengeance, and blood, blood, and they that sowe slaughter, shall be sure to reape ruine and destruction. Now Delfridus hearing these words, and feeling the force of the poison to worke within him, assayed all the remedies he could to heale himselfe, but all in vaine. Fuluia also feeling the poison to preuaile within her, fell vpon her knees before the aulter of Diana vttering these words. O Goddesse, thou knowest how, since the death of my sweete husband, this life hath been most loathsome and sowre vnto me, and that the onely offering vp of this sacrifice hath kept me from him, which now in thy presence being performed, I thinke my selfe to haue satisfied my duety, and purchased thereby a pasport to passe to the habitation and paradice where my husband hath his dwelling. Immediately vpon this, so well as she could, she crawled home to her house, where she was no sooner, but tidings were brought her that Delfridus was dead, wherewith with great ioy she cast her selfe downe vpon her bedde, and called her little sonne which she had by Valentine , whom blessing and bussing, said. Alas pretie impe, who shall now defend thee from thy foes, who shall redresse thy wrongs? Thy father is gone, thy mother is departing, and thou poore soule must abide behind, to endure the brunt and bitter blastes of this wretched world.
