 Hauing spent manie yeres in studying how to liue, and liude a long time without money; hauing tyred my youth with follie, and surfetted my minde with vanitie, I began at length to looke backe to repentaunce,  & addresse my endeuors to prosperitie: But all in vaine, I sate vp late, & rose early, contended with the colde, and conuersed with scarcitie; for all my labours turned to losse, my vulgar Muse was despised & neglected,   [  Discite qui sapitis, cum hec quae scimus inertes: Sed trepidas acies, & fera bella sequi. ] my paines not regarded or slightly rewarded, and I my selfe (in prime of my best wit) layde open to pouertie. Whereupon (in a malecontent humor) I accused my fortune, raild on my patrones, bit my pen, rent my papers, and ragde in all points like a mad man. In which agonie tormenting my selfe a long time, I grew by degrees to a milde discontent: & pausing a while ouer my standish, I resolued in verse to paynt forth my passion;   [  Est aliquid fatale malum, per verba leuare. ] which best agreeing with the vaine of my vnrest, I began to complaine in this sort. Why ist damnation to dispaire and dye, When life is my true happinesse disease? My soule, my soule, thy safetie makes me flye The faultie meanes, that might my paine appease. Diuines and dying men may talke of hell: But in my hart, her seuerall torments dwell. Ah worthlesse Wit,   [  Ingenio perij. qui miser ipse meo ] to traine me to this woe, Deceitfull Artes that nourish Discontent: Ill thriue the Follie that bewitcht me so, Vaine thoughts adieu, for now I will repent: And yet my wants perswade me to proceede,   [  Paupertas impulit audax vt versus facerem ] Since none takes pitie of a Schollers neede. Forgiue me God, although I curse my birth, And ban the aire, wherein I breathe a Wretch: Since Miserie hath daunted all my mirth, And I am quite vndone through promise-breach. Oh frends!   [  Pol me occidistis amici. ] no frends, that then vngently frowne, When changing Fortune casts vs headlong downe. Without redresse complaynes my carelesse verse, And Mydas eares relent not at my moane:    [  Hei mihi, quum paucos haec mea dicta mouent. ] In some farre Land will I my grieues reherse, Mongst them that will be moou'd when I shall groane. England (adieu) the Soyle that brought me foorth, Adieu vnkinde, where skill is nothing woorth. These Rymes thus abruptly set downe, I tost my imagination a thousand wayes to see if I coulde finde anie meanes to relieue my estate: But all my thoughts consorted to this conclusion, that the world was vncharitable, and I ordained to be ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Miser est quicunque aerumnam suam nequit occultare. ] miserable. Thereby I grew to consider how manie base men that wanted those parts which I had, enioyed content at will, and had wealth at commaund ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Miser est quicunque aerumnam suam nequit occultare. ] : I cald to mind a Cobler, that was worth fiue hundred pound; an Hostler that had built a goodly Inne, and might dispende fortie pounds yerely by his Land;   [  Fortuna fauet fatuos. ] a Carre-man in a lether pilche, that had whipt out a thousand pound out of his horse tayle: and haue I more wit than all these (thought I to my selfe)? am I better borne? am I better brought vp? yea, and better fauored?   [  Meritis expendite causam. ] and yet am I a begger? What is the cause? how am I crost? or whence is this curse? Euen from hence, that men that should employ such as I am, are enamoured of their owne wits, and thinke what euer they doo is excellent, though it be neuer so scuruie, that Learning (of the ignorant) is cared after the value of the inke and paper; and a Scriuener better paid for an obligation, than a Scholler for the best Poeme he can make; that ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Scribimus indocti doctique poemata passim. ] euerie grosse brainde Idiot is suffered to come into print, who if hee set foorth a Pamphlet of the praise of Pudding pricks, or write a Treatise or Tom Thumme , or the exployts of Vntrusse ; it is bought vp thicke and three folde; when better things lye dead. How then can wee chuse but be needie, when there are so manie Droanes amongst vs? or euer proue rich, that toyle a whole yeare for faire lookes? Gentle Sir Philip Sydney , thou knewst what belongd to a Scholler,   [ Cultor & Antistes, doctorum sancte virorum. ] thou knewest what paines, what toyle, what trauell conduct to perfection: well couldst thou giue euerie Uertue his encouragement, euerie Arte his due, euerie Writer his desert; cause none more vertuous, wittie, or learned than thy selfe. But thou art dead in thy graue,   [  Heu rapiunt mala fata bonos. Fluctibus in medijs nauim Palinure relinquis. ] and hast left too few successors of thy glorie, too fewe to cherish the Sonnes of the Muses, or water those budding hopes with their plentie, which thy bountie erst planted. Beleeue me Gentlemen (for some crosse mishappes haue taught me experience) there is not that strict obseruation of Honour, which hath been heretofore. Men of great calling take it of merit, to haue their names eternisht by Poets; and whatsoeuer Pamphlet or dedication encounters them, they put it vp in their sleeues, and scarce giue him thankes that presents it. Much better is it for those golden Pennes to raise such vngratefull Peasants from the Dung-hill of Obscuritie, and make them equal in fame to the Worthies of olde; when their doating selfe loue shall challenge it of dutie, and not onely giue them nothing themselues, but impouerish liberalite in others. This is the lamentable condition of our Times, that men of Arte must seek almes of Cormorants, and those that deserue best, be kept vnder by Dunces: who count it a policie to keep them bare, because they shuld follow their books the better; thinking belike, that as preferment hath made themselues idle, that were earst painfull in meaner places, so it would likewise starken the endeuours of those Students that as yet striue to excell, in hope of aduauncement. A good pollicie to suppresse superfluous liberalitie. But had it been practised when they were promoted, the Yeomandry of the Realme had been better to passe than it is, and one Droane should not haue driuen so manie Bees from theyr honie-combes. I, I, wele giue loosers leaue to talke, it is no matter what Sic probo and his pennilesse companions prate, whilst we haue the gold in our coffers: this is it that will make a knaue an honest man, and my neighbour Cromptons strippling a better Gentleman than his Grandsier. O it is a trim thing when Pride the sonne goes before, and Shame the father followes after. Such presidents there are in our Comon-wealth a great manie: not so much of them whome Learning and Industrie hath exalted: (whome I prefer before Genus & proauos ) as of Carterly vpstarts, that out-face Towne and Countrey in their veluets, when sir Rowland Russet-coat their dad, goes sagging euerie day in his round gascoynes of white cotton; and hath much a doo (poore pennie-father) to keepe his vnthrift elbowes in reparations. Marry happie are they say I, that haue such fathers to worke for them whilst they play, for where other men turn ouer manie leaues to get bread and cheese in their olde age, and studie twentie yeares to distill golde out of incke: our yong masters doo nothing but deuise how to spend and aske counsaile of the wine and capons, how they may quickliest consume their patrimonies. As for me, I liue secure from all such perturbations: for (thankes bee to God) I am vacuus viator , and care not though I meete the Commissioners of New-market- heath at high midnight, for anie Crosses, Images, or pictures that I carrie about mee more than needes. Than needes quoth I, nay I would be ashamde of it, if Opus and Vsus were not knocking at my doore twenty times a weeke when I am not within: the more is the pittie, that such a franke Gentleman as I, should want: but since the dice doo runne so vntowardly on my side, I am partly prouided of a remedie. For whereas those that stand most on their honour haue shut vp their purses, and shift vs off with Court holly-bread: and on the other side, a number of hypocriticall hot- spurres, that haue GOD alwayes in theyr mouthes, will giue nothing for Gods sake: I haue clapt vp a handsome Supplication to the Diuell, and sent it by a good fellow, that I know will deliuer it. And because you may beleeue mee the better. I care not if I acquaint you with the circumstance. I was informd of late dayes, that a certaine blinde Retayler called the Diuell, vsed to lend money vpon pawnes or anie thing, and would let one for a need haue a thousand poundes vppon a Statute Merchaunt of his soule: or if a man plyde him throughly, would trust him vppon a Bill of his hand without anie more circumstaunce. Besides, hee was noted for a priuie Benefactor to Traytors and Parasites, and to aduaunce fooles and asses farre sooner than anie, to be a greedie pursuer of newes, and so famous a Politician in purchasing, that Hel, which at the beginning was but an obscure Uillage, is now become a huge Citie, whervnto all Countreys are Tributarie. These manifest coniectures of Plentie, assembled in one Common-place of abilitie; I determined to clawe Auarice by the elboe, till his full belly gaue me a full hand and let him bloud with my pen (if it might be) in the veyne of Liberalitie: and so (in short time) was this Paper-monster Pierce Penilesse begotten. But written and all, here lies the question, where shall I finde this old Asse that I may deliuer it. Mas thats true, they say the Lawyers haue the Diuel and all: and it is like enough he is playing Ambodexter amongst them. Fie, fie: the Diuell a driuer in Westminster-hall, it can neuer be. Now I pray what doo you imagine him to be? Perhaps you thinke it is not possible he should be so graue. Oh then you are in an errour, for hee is as formale as the best Scriuener of them all. Marry hee doth not vse to weare a nightcap, for his hornes will not let him: and yet I know a hundred as well headed as he that will make a iolly shift with a Court-cup on their crownes, if the weather bee colde. To proceed with my tale, to Westminster hall I went, and made a search of Enquirie, from the blacke gowne to the buckram bag, if there were anie such Serieant, Bencher, Counsailer, Atturney or Petifogger, as Signior Cornuto Diabolo , with the good face. But they all (vna voce) affirmed, that he was not there: marry whether hee were at the Exchange or no, amongst the ritch Merchants, that they could not tell: but it was likelier of the two, that I should meete with him, or heare of him (at the least) in those quarters. I faith, and say you so quoth I, and Ile bestow a little labour more, but Ile hnt him out. Without more circumstance, thether came I: and thrusting my selfe (as the manner is) amongst the confusion of languages, I askt (as before) whether he were there extant or no? But from one to another, Non noui D aemonem was all the answere I could get. At length (as Fortune serude) I lighted vppon an olde straddling Usurer, clad in a Damaske Cassocke, edgde with Fox-furre; a paire of trunke slops, sagging down like a Shoomakers wallet; and a short thrid bare gown on his backe, fac't with moatheaten budge; vpon his head he wore a filthy course biggin, and next it a Garnish of nightcaps, with a sage butten cap of the forme of a Cow sheard, ouerspred verie orderly: a fat chuffe it was (I remember) with a grey beard cut short to the stumps, as though it were grymde, and a huge worme-eaten nose like a cluster of grapes hanging downwards. Of him I demaunded, if hee could tell me anie tidings of the partie I sought for. By my troth quoth he strip'ing, (and then he cought) I saw him not lately, nor know I certainly where he keepes: but thus much I heard by a broker a friend of mine, that hath had some dealings with him in his time, that hee is at home sicke of the goute, and will not be spoken withall vnder more than thou art able to giue, some two or three hundred Angels if thou hast anie sute to him: and then perhaps hele straine curtesie with his legges in child bed, and come forth and talke with thee: but otherwise Non est domi , he is busie with Mammon and the Prince of the North howe to build vp his kingdome, or sending his sprites abroad to vndermine the maligners of his gouernment. I hearing of this colde comfort, tooke my leaue of him very faintly, and like a carelesse malcontent that knewe not which way to turne, retyred me to Paules to seeke my dinner with Duke Humfrey: but when I came there the olde Souldiour was not vp; hee is long a rising thought I, but that's all one: for he that hath no money in his purse, must goe dine with sir John Best-betrust at the signe of the Chalke and the Post. Two hungry turnes had I scarce fetcht in this wast gallery, when I was encountred by a neat pedanticall fellow, in forme of a Cittizen: who thrusting himselfe abruptly into my companie like an Intelligencer, began very earnestly to question with mee about the cause of my discontent, or what made me so sad, that seemed too young to bee acquainted with sorrow. I nothing nice to vnfold my estate to any what soeuer, discourst to him the whole circumstance of my care: and what toyle and paynes I had tooke in searching for him that woulde not bee heard of. Why sir (quoth hee) had I beene priuie to your purpose before, I could haue easd you of thys trauell: for if it be the deuill you seeke for, know I am his man. I pray sir how might I call you?   [  Non bene conducti vendunt periuria testes. ] A Knight of the post quoth he, for so I am tearmed: a fellow that will sweare you any thing for twelue pence; but indeede I am a spirite in nature and essence, that take vppon mee this humaine shape, onely to set men together by the eares, and send soules by millions to hell. Now trust mee a substantiall trade; but when doe you thinke you coulde sende next to your Master? Why euery day; for there is not a Cormorant that dyes, or Cut-purse that is hang'd, but I dispatch letters by his soule to him, and to all my friends in the Low-countreys: wherefore if you haue anie thing that you would haue transported: giue it me, and I will see it deliuered. Yes marry haue I (quoth I) a certayne Supplication here to your Master, which you may peruse if it please you. With that he opened it, and read as followeth. king of Acheron, Stix & Phlegeton , Duke of Tartary , Marquesse of Cocytus , and Lord high Regent of Lymbo: his distressed Orator Pierce Pennilesse , wisheth encrease of damnation and malediction eternall, per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum . Most humbly sueth vnto your sinfulnesse, your singlesould Orator Pierce Pennilesse : that whereas your impious excellence, hath had the poore tennement of hys purse any time this halfe yeere, for your dauncing schoole, and he (notwithstanding) hath receyued no penny nor crosse for farme, according to the vsuall manner ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  No ile be sworn vpon a booke haue I not. ] : it may please your gracelesse Maiesty to consider of him, and giue order to your seruant Auarice, he may be dispatched; in somuch as no man heere in London can haue a dauncing schoole without rent, and his wit and knauery cannot be maintayned with nothing. Or if this be not so plausible to your honourable infernalship, it might seeme good to your helhood, to make extent vpon the soules of a number of vncharitable Cormorants, who hauing incurd the daunger of a Pr aemunire , with medling with matters that properly cocerne your owne person, deserue no longer to liue (as men) amongst men, but to bee incorporated in the society of diuels. By which meanes, the mightie controller of fortune, and the imperious subuerter of destiny, delicious gold, the poore mans God, and Idoll of Princes (that lookes pale and wanne through long imprisonment) might at length be restored to his powrefull Monarchie, and eft-soones bee sette at libertie, to helpe his friends that haue neede of him. I knowe a great sort of good fellowes that woulde venture far for his freedome ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  .i. for the freedome of gold. ] , and a number of needy Lawyers, (who now mourn in thred-bare gownes for his thraldome) that woulde goe neere to poyson his keepers with false Latine, if that might procure his enlargement: but inexorable yron detaines him in the dungeon of the night, so that now (pure creature) hee can neither traffique with the Mercers and Taylers as he was wont, nor dominere in Tauernes as hee ought. Famine, Lent and dessolation, sitte in Onyon skind iackets before the doore of his indurance, as a Chorus in the Tragedy of Hospitality, to tel pouertie theres no releife for them there; and in the inner part of this vgly habitation, stands Greedinesse, prepared to deuoure all that enter, attyred in a Capouch of written parchment,   [  The description of Greedinesse. ] buttond downe before with Labels of waxe, and lin'd with sheepes fells for warmenesse: his Cap furd with Cats skinnes, after the Muscouy fashion, and all to be tasseld with Angle-hookes in stead of Aglets, ready to catch hold of all those to whom hee shewes any humblenesse: for his breeches they were made of the lysts of broad Cloaths, which he had by letters pattents assured him and his heyres, to the vtter ouerthrow of Bowcases and Cushion-makers, and bumbasted they were like Beere barrels, with statute Marchants and forfeytures. But of all, his shooes were the strangest, which being nothing else but a couple of Crab shells, were toothd at the toes with two sharp sixpenny nailes, that digd vp euery dunghill they came by for gold, and snarld at the stones as hee went in the streete, because they were so common for men, women, and Children to tread vpon, and he could not deuise how to wrest an odde fine out of any of them. Thus walkes hee vp and downe all his life time, with an yron Crow in his hand in stead of a staffe, and a Sariants Mace in his mouth, (which night & day he still gnaws vpon) and eyther busies himself in setting siluer lime-twigs to entangle young Gentlemen, and casting foorth silken shraps to catch Woodcocks, or in syuing of Muck-hills and shop-dust, whereof he will boult a whole Cart load to gain a bow'd Pinne. On the other side, Dame Niggardize his wife,   [  The description of dame Niggerdize. ] in a sedge rugge kirtle, that had beene a matte time out of minde, a course hempen rayle about her shoulders, borrowed of the one ende of-a hop, bag, an apron made of Almanackes out of date (such as stand vpon Screenes, or on the backside of a dore in a Chandlers shop), and an olde wiues pudding pan on her head, thrumd with the parings of her nayles; sate barrelling vp the droppings of her nose, in steed of oyle to sayme wooll withall, and would not aduenture to spit without halfe a dozen of porrengers at her elbow. The house (or rather the hell) where these two Earthwormes encaptiued this beautifull Substaunce, was vast, large, strong built, and well furnished, all saue the Kitchin: for that was no bigger than the Cooks roome in a ship, with a little Court chimney, about the compasse of a Parenthesis in Proclamation print: then iudge you what diminutiue dishes came out of this doues-neast. So likewise of the Buttrie: for whereas in houses of such stately foundation that are built to outward shewe so magnificent, euerie Office is answerable to the Hall, which is principall; there the Buttrie was no more but a blind Cole- house vnder a paire of stayres, wherein (vprising and downe lying) was but one single single kilderkin of small beere, that would make a man with a carrouse of a spoonefull runne through an Alphabet of faces. Nor vsd they anie glasses or cups (as other men) but onely little farthing ounce boxes, whereof one of them fild vp with froath (in manner and forme of an Alehouse) was a meales allowance for the whole houshold. It were lamentable to tell what miserie the Rattes and Myce endured in this hard world, how when all supply of victualls fayled them, they went a Boot-haling one night to Sinior Greedinesse bed- chamber; where finding nothing but emptinesse and vastitie, they encountred (after long inquisition) with a cod-peece, well dunged and manured with greace, (which my pinch fart penie father had retaind from his Bachelorship, vntill the eating of these presents). Uppon that they set,  & with a couragious assault rent it cleane away from the breeches, and then carried it in triumph like a coffin on their shoulders betwixt them. The verie spiders and dust weauers, that went to set vp their loomes in euerie windowe, decayed and vndone through the extreame dearth of the place (that affoorded them no matter to worke on) were constrained to breake against their wills, and goe dwell in the countrey, out of the reach of the broome and the wing: and generally, not a flea nor a cricket that caried anie braue minde, that would stay there after he had once tasted the order of their fare. Onely vnfortunate golde (a predestinate slaue to drudges and fooles) liues in endlesse bondage there amongst them, and may no way be releast, except you send the rot halfe a yeare amongst his keepers, and so make them away with a murrion one after another. O,   [  The complaynt of Pryde. ] but a farre greater enormitie raigneth in the heart of the Court: Pride the peruerter of all Uertue, sitteth apparailed in the Merchants spoyles, and ruine of yong Citizens; and scorneth Learning, that gaue their vp-start Fathers, titles of Gentrie. All malcontent sits the greasie sonne of a Cloathier,   [  The nature of an vpstart. ] and complaines (like a decayed Earle) of the ruine of ancient houses; whereas the Weauers loomes first framed the web of his honour, and the locks of wooll that bushes and brambles haue tooke for toule of insolent sheepe, that would needs striue for the wall of a fir-bush, haue made him of the tenths of their tarre, a Squier of low degree; and of the collections of their scatterings, a Iustice Tam Marti quam Mercurio, of Peace and of Coram. Hee will bee humorous forsooth, and haue a broode of fashions by himselfe. Somtimes (because Loue commonly weares the liuerie of Wit) hee will be an Inamorato Poeta, and sonnet a whole quire of paper in praise of Ladie Manibetter, his yeolowfac'd Mistres, and wear a feather of her rain-beaten fanne for a fauour, like a fore-horse. All Italionato is his talke, and his spade peake is as sharpe as if he had been a Pioner before the walls of Roan . Hee will despise the barbarisme of his owne Countrey, and tell a whole Legend of lyes of his trauayles vnto Constantinople . If he be challenged to fight from his delaterie dye-case, hee obiects, that it is not the custome of the Spaniard or the Germaine, to looke back to euerie dog that barkes. You shall see a dapper Iacke, that hath beene but once at Deepe, wring his face round about, as a man would stirre vp a mustard pot, and talke English through the teeth like Iaques Scabd-hams , or Monsieur Mingo de Monstrapo ; when (poore slaue) he hath but dipt his bread in wylde Boares greace, and come home againe; or been bitten by the shinnes by a Wolfe: and saith, he hath aduentured vppon the Barricadoes of Gurney or Guingan, and fought with the yong Guise hand to hand. Some thinke to be counted rare Politicians and Statesmen,    [  The counterfeit politian. ] by beeing solitarie: as who should say, I am a wise man, a braue man, Secreta mea mihi: Frustra sapit, qui sibi non sapit: and there is no man worthie of my companie or friendship: when, although he goes vngartred like a male-content Cutpursse, and weares his hat ouer his eyes lyke one of the cursed Crue; yet cannot his stabbing dagger, or his nittie loue- locke keepe him out of the Legend of fantasticall cockscombes. I pray ye good Mounsier Diuell take some order, that the streetes be not pestered with them so as they are. Is it not pitiful thing that a fellow that eates not a good meales meat in a weeke, but beggereth his belly quite and cleane, to make his backe a certain kind of a brokerly Gentleman: and nowe and then (once or twice in a Tearme) comes to the eighteene pence Ordenarie, because hee would bee seene amongst Caualiers and braue Courtyers, lyuing otherwise all the yeere long with salt Butter and Holland Cheese in his Chamber, shoulde take vppe a scornfull melancholike course in his gate and countenance, and talke as though our Common-wealth were but a mockery of gouernment, and our Maiestrates fooles, who wronged him in not looking into his deserts, not imploying him in State matters, and that if more regard were not had of him very shortly, the whole Realme should haue a misse of him, and he would go (I mary would he) where he should be more accounted off. Is it not wonderfull ill prouided, I say, that this disdainfull Companion is not made one of the fraternitie of Fooles, to talke before great States, with some olde moth-eaten Polititian, of mending high waies, and leading Armies into Fraunce. A young Heyre or Cockney,   [  The prodigall young Master. ] that is his Mothers Darling, if hee haue playde the waste-good at the Innes of the Court or about London, and that neither his Students pension, nor his vnthrifts credite will serue to maintaine his Collidge of whores any longer, falles in a quarrelling humor with his fortune, because she made him not King of the Indies , and sweares & stares after ten in the hundreth, that nere a such Pesant as his Father or brother shall keep him vnder, hee will to the sea and teare the gold out of the Spanyards throats but he will haue it byrlady: And when he comes there, poore soule hee lyes in brine in Balist, and is lamentable sicke of the scuruyes, his dayntie fare is turned to a hungry feast of Dogs and Cats, or Haberdine and poore Iohn at the most, and which is lamentablest of all, that without Mustard. As a mad Ruffion on a time, being in daunger of shipwrack by a tempest, and seeing all other at their vowes and praiers, that if it would please God of his infinite goodnesse, to deliuer them out of that imminent daunger, one woulde abiure this sinne wherunto he was adicted: an other, make satisfaction for that vyolence he had committed: he, in a desperate iest, began thus to reconcile his soule to heauen. O Lord, if it may seeme good to thee to deliuer me from this feare of vntimely death, I vowe before thy Throne and all thy starry Host, neuer to eate Haberdine more whilst I liue. Well so it fell out, that the Sky cleared and the tempest ceased, and this carelesse wretch that made such a mockery of praier, ready to set foote a Land, cried out: not without Mustard good Lord, not without Mustard; as though it had been the greatest torment in the world, to haue eaten Haberdine without Mustard. But this by the way, what pennance can be greater for Pride, than to let it swinge in hys owne halter? Dulce bellum inexpertis, theres no man loues the smoake of his owne Countrey, that hath not been syngde in the flame of an other soyle. It is a pleasant thing ouer a full pot, to read the fable of thirsty Tantalus: but a hard matter to disgest salt meates at Sea, with stinking water. An other misery of Pride it is,   [  The pride of the learned. ] when men that haue good parts, and beare the name of deepe scholers, cannot be content to participate one faith with all Christendome, but because they will get a name to their vaineglory, they will set their selfe-loue to study to inuent new sects of singularitie, thinking to liue when they are dead, by hauing theyr sect called after their names, as Donatists of Donatus, Arrians of Arrius: & a number more new faith-founders that haue made England the Exchange of Innouations,  & almost asmuch confusion of Religion in euerie Quarter, as there was of tongues at the building of the Tower of Babell . Whence, a number that fetch the Articles of their Beleefe out of Aristotle, and thinke of heauen and hell as the Heathen Philosophers; take occasion to deride our Ecclesiasticall State, and all Ceremonies of Diuine worship, as bugbeares and scar-crowes, because (like Herodes souldiers) we diuide Christs garment amongest vs in so manie peeces, and of the vesture of saluation make some of vs Babies and apes coates, others straight trusses and Diuells breeches: some gally gascoynes or a shipmans hose like the Anabaptists and adulterous Familists, others with the Martinists a hood with two faces to hide their hypocrisie: and to conclude, some like the Barrowists and Greenwoodians, a garment ful of the plague, which is not to be worn before it be new washt. Hence Atheists triumph and reioyce, and talke as prophanely of the Bible, as of Beuis of Hampton. I heare say there be Mathematitians abroad, that will prooue men before Adam, and they are harboured in high places, who will maintayne it to the death, that there are no diuells. [  The deuill hath children (as other men) but fewe of them know their owne father. ] It is a shame (senior Belzibub ) that you shoulde suffer your selfe thus to be tearmed a bastard, or not approue to your predestinate children, not only that they haue a father, but that you are hee that must owne them. These are but the suburbes of the sinne we haue in hand: I must describe to you a large cittie, wholy inhabited with this damnable enormitie. In one place let me shewe you a base Artificer,   [  The pride of Artificers ] that hath no reuenues to bost on, but a Needle in his bosome, as braue as any Pensioner or Noble man. In an other corner,   [  The pride of Marchats wiues. ] Mistris Minx a Marchants wife, that will eate no Cherries forsooth, but when they are at twentie shillings a pound, that lookes as simperingly as if she were besmeard, & iets it as gingerly as if she were dancing the Canaries: she is so finicall in her speach, as though she spake nothing but what she had first sewd ouer before in her Samplers, and the puling accent of her voyce is like a fained treble, or ones voyce that interprets to the puppets. What should I tell how squeamish she is in her dyet, what toyle she puts her poore seruants vnto, to make her looking glasses in the pauement? how she wil not goe into the fields to cowre on the greene grasse, but shee must haue a Coatch for her conuoy: and spends halfe a day in pranking her self if she be inuited to anie strange place? Is not this the excesse of pride signior Sathan? Goe too, you are vnwise, if you make her not a chiefe Saint in your Calender. The next obiect that encounters my eyes,   [  The pride of pesants sprung vp of nothing. ] is some such obscure vpstart gallants, as without desert or seruice are raised from the plough to be checkmate with Princes: & these I can no better compare than to creatures that are bred Sine coitu, as crickets in chimnyes, to which I resemble poore Scullians, that from turning spit in the chimney corner, are on the sodaine hoysed vp from the Kitchin into the wayting Chamber, or made Barons of the beanes, and Marquesses of the mary-boanes: some by corrupt water, as gnats, to which we may liken Brewers, that by retayling filthie Thames water, come in few yeres to be worth fortie or fiftie thousand pound: others by dead wine, as little flying wormes, and so the Uintners in like case: others by slime as frogs, which may be alluded to Mother Bunches slymie ale, that hath made her, and some other of her fil pot familie so wealthie: others by dirt, as wormes,  & so I know manie gold-finders and hostlers come vp: some by hearbs as cankers, and after the same sort our Apothecaries: others by ashes as Scarabes , and how else get our Colliers the pence? Others from the putrified flesh of dead beasts, as Baes of Bulls, & Butchers by fly- blowne beefe, waspes of horses, and Hackney-men by selling their lame iades to hunts-men for carrion. Yet am I not against it, that these men by their mechanicall Trades should come to be Sparage Gentlemen,   [  Sparagus, a flowre that neuer groweth but through mans dung. ] & chuff-headed Burghomasters: but that better places should bee possessed by coystrells, and the Coblers Crowe for crying but Aue C aesar, be more esteemed than rarer birds that haue warbled sweeter notes vnrewarded. But it is no meruaile: For as Hemlocke fatteth Quayles, and Henbane Swine, which to all other is poyson: so some mens vices haue power to aduaunce them, which would subuert anie else that should seeke to clymbe by them: & it is inough in them that they can pare their nayles well to get them a liuing, when as the seauen Liberall Sciences and a good legge, wil scarse get a Scholler bread and cheese. These whelpes of the first lytter of Gentilitie, these Exhalations, drawen vp to the heauen of Honour, from the dunghill of abiect fortune, haue long been on horsebacke to come riding to your Diuelship: but I know not how lyke Saint George they are alwaies mounted, but neuer moue. Here they out-face Towne and Countrey, and doo nothing but bandie factions with their betters. Their bigge limbes yeeld the Common-wealth no other seruice but idle sweate, and their heads like rough hewen Gloabes, are fit for nothing but to be the blockhouses for sleepe. Raynold the Fox may well beare vp his tayle in the Lyons denne, but when he comes abroad, he is afraide of euerie dogge that barkes. What curre will not bawle and be readie to flye in a mans face, when he is set on by his master, who if hee bee not by to encourage him, he casts his tayle betwixt his legges, and steales away like a sheepe-byter. Vlisses was a tall man vnder Aiax shield: but by himselfe hee would neuer aduenture but in the night. Pride is neuer built but vppon some pillers: and let his supporters faile him neuer so little, you shall finde him verie humble in the dust. Wit oftentimes stands in stead of a chiefe Arche to vnderprop it, in Souldiers strength, in Women beautie Drudges that haue no extraordinarie giftes of bodie,   [  The base insinuating of drudges, & their practise to aspyre. ] nor of minde, filche themselues into some Noble mans seruice, either by bribes or by flatterie, and when they are there they so labour it with cap and knee, and ply it with priuie whisperinges, that they wring themselues into his good opinion ere he be aware. Then doo they vaunt themselues ouer the common multitude, and are readie to braue anie man that stands by himselfe. Their Lords authoritie is as a rebater to beare vp the Peacockes tayle of their boasting, and anie thing that is said or done to the vnhandsoming of their ambition, is straight wrested to the name of treason. Thus doo weedes grow vp whiles no man regards them, and the Ship of Fooles is arriued in the Hauen of Felicitie, whilest the Scoutes of Enuie contemne the attempts of anye such small Barkes. But beware you that be great mens Fauorites: let not a seruile insinuating slaue creep betwixt your legs into credit with your Lords: for pesants that come out of the colde of pouertie, once cherisht in the bosome of prosperitie, will straight forget that euer there was a Winter of want, or who gaue them roome to warme them. The son of a churle cannot choose but prooue vngratefull like his father. Trust not a villaine that hath been miserable, and is sodainly growen happie. Uertue ascendeth by degrees of desert vnto Dignitie: golde and lust may lead a man a nearer way to promotion; but he that hath neither comelinesse nor coyne to commend him, vndoubtedly strydes ouer time by stratagems ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  As by carrying tales or playing the douty Pandor. ] , if of a moale-hill hee growes to a mountaine in a moment. This is that which I vrge, there is no frendship to be had with him, that is resolute to doo or suffer any thing rather than to endure the destenie whereto he was borne: for he will not spare his owne Father or brother, to make himselfe a Gentleman. Fraunce, Italy, and Spaine, are all full of these false hearted Machiuillians :    [  The pride of the Spanyard. ] but properly Pride is the disease of the Spaniard, who is born a Braggart in his mothers womb: for if he be but 17. yeares olde, and hath come to the place where a Field was fought (though halfe a yeare before) hee then talkes like one of the Giants that made warre against Heauen, and stands vpon his honor as much, as if he were one of Augustus Souldiers, of whom he first instituted the order of Heralds: and let a man sooth him in this vayne of kilcowe vanitie, you maye commaund his heart out of his belly to make you a rasher on the coales, if you will next your heart. The Italian is a more cunning proud fellow, and hides his humor farre cleanlier,   [  The pride of the Italia ] and indeed seemes to take a pride in humilitie, and will profer a straunger more curtesie than he meanes to performe. Hee hateth him deadly that takes him at his word: as for example, if vpon occasion of meeting, he request you to dinner or supper at his house, & that at the first or second intreatie you promise to be his guest he will be the mortalst enemie you haue: but if you deny him, he will think you haue manners and good bringing vp, and will loue you as his brother: marry at the thirde or fourth time you must not refuse him. Of all things he counteth it a mightie disgrace to haue a man passe iustling by him in hast on a narrow causey, and aske him no leaue, which hee neuer reuengeth with lesse than the stab. [  The pride of the french man. ] The Frenchman (not altered from his owne nature) is wholly compact of deceiuable Courtship, and for (the most part) loues none but himselfe and his pleasure: yet though he be the most Grand Signeur of them all, he will say, A vostre seruice et commandemente Monsieur, to the meanest vassaile he meetes. He thinkes he doth a great fauour to that Gentleman or follower of his, to whom hee talkes sitting on his close stoole: and with that fauour (I haue heard) the Princes wonted to grace the Noble men of Fraunce ; and a great man of their Nation comming (in time past) ouer into England, and being here verie honorably receiued, hee in requital of his admirable entertaimnent, on an euening going to the priuie (as it were to honour extraordinarilie our English Lords appointed to attend vpon him) gaue one the candle, another his girdle, and another the paper: but they (not acquainted with this newe kinde of gracing) accompanying him to the priue dore, set downe the trash, and so left him; which hee (considering what inestimable kindnesse he extended to them therein more than vsuall) took very hainouslie. [  The pride of the Dane ] The most grosse and sencelesse proud dolts (in a difference from all these kindes) are the Danes: who stande so much vpon their vnweldie burliboard souldierie, that they account of no man that hath not a battle axe at his girdle to hough dogs with, or weares not a cocks fether in a thrumd hat like a Caualier: briefly, he is the best Foole Bragart vnder heauen. For besides, Nature hath lent him a flabberkin face, like one of the foure windes, and cheekes that sagge like a womans dugges ouer his Chin- bone, his apparaile is so puft vp with bladders of Taffatie, and his backe (like biefe stuft with Parsley) so drawne out with Ribands and deuises, and blisterd with light sarcenet bastings, that you would thinke him nothing but a swarme of Butterflyes, if you saw him a farre off. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) [  If you know him not by any of these marks, look on his fingers & you shall bee sure to find halfe a dozen siluer rings worth three pence a peece. ] Thus walkes hee vp and downe in his Maiestie, taking a yard of ground at euery step, and stampes on the earth so terrible, as if he ment to knock vp a spirite, when (foule drunken bezzle if an englishman set his little finger to him, he falls like a hogs-trough that is set on one end. Therfore I am the more vehement against them,   [  The Danes enemies to al learning. ] because they are an arrogant Asse-headed people, that naturally hate learning, and all them that loue it: yea, and for they would vtterly roote it out from amongst them, they haue with-drawen all rewards from the Professors thereof. Not Barbary it selfe is halfe so barbarous as they are. First, whereas the hope of honour maketh a Souldior in England ; Byshopricks, Deanries, Prebendaries, and other priuate dignities, animate our Diuines to such excellence. The ciuill Lawyers haue their degrees and consistories of honour by themselues, equall in place with Knights and Esquiers: the common Lawyers, (suppose in the beginning they are but husbandmens sonnes) come in time to be the chiefe Fathers of the Land, and many of them not the meanest of the Priuie Counsell. There the Souldiour may fight himselfe out of his skinne,    [  No rewards amongst them for desert. ] and doe more exployits than hee hath doyts in hys purse, before from a common Mercenary, hee come to bee Corporall of the mould Cheese: or the Lieftennant gette a Captainship. None but the sonne of a Corporall must bee a Corporall, nor any be Captaine, but the lawfull begotten of a Captaines body. Byshops, Deanes, Prebendaries, why they know no such functions: a sort of ragged Ministers they haue, of whom they account as basely, as waterbearers. If any of the Noblemen refrayn three howers in his life time from drinking, to study the Lawes, he may perhaps haue a little more gouernment put into his hands than an other: but otherwise, Burgomasters and Gentlemen beare all the sway of both swords, Spiritual and temporall. It is death there for any but a husbandman to marrie a husbandmans daughter, or a Gentlemans childe to ioyne with any but the sonne of a Gentleman, mary thys the king may well banish, but he cannot put a Gentleman to death in any cause whatsoeuer, which makes them stand vppon it so proudly as they doe. For fashion sake some will put their children to schoole, but they set them not to it till they are fourteene yeere old: so that you shall see a great boy with a beard learne his ABC, and sit weeping vnder the rod, when he is thirty yeeres olde. I will not stand to inferre,   [  What it is to make labour with out hope. ] what a preiudice it is to the thrift of a florishing State, to poyson the groth of Glory, by giuing it nought but the puddle water of penury to drinke: to clippe the wings of a high touring Faulcon, who whereas she wont in her feathered youthfulnesse, to looke with amiable eye on her gray breast, and her speckled side sayles, all sinnowed with siluer quilles, and to driue whole armies of fearfull foules before her to her masters table; now shee sits sadly on the ground, picking of wormes, mourning the cruelty of those vngentleman- like idle hands, that dismembreth the beauty of her trayne. You all know that man (in so much as hee is the Image of God delighteth in honour and worship, and al holy Writ warrants that delight, so it bee not derogatory to any part of Gods owne worship: now take away that delight, a discontented idlenesse ouertakes him. For his hyre, any handicraft-man, be he Carpenter, Ioyner, or Paynter, will ploddingly do his day-labor: but to adde credit and fame to his workmanship, or to winne a mastery to himselfe aboue all other, hee will make a further assay in his trade than euer hitherto hee did, hee will haue a thousand florishes, which before he neuer thought vpon, and in one day rid more out of hand, than erst he did in ten: So in Armes, so in Arts, if tytles of fame and glory bee proposed to forward mindes, or that any souereigntie (whose sweetnes they haue not yet felt) bee set in likely view for them to sore too, they will make a ladder of cord of the links of their braines, but they wil fasten their hands as wel as their eies, on the imaginatiue blisse, which they already enioy by admiration. Experirience reprooues me for a fool, for delating on so manifest a case. The Danes are bursten-bellied sots, that are to be confuted with nothing but Tankerds or quart pots, and Ouid might as wel haue read his verses to the Getes that vnderstood him not, as a man talke reason to them that haue no eares but their mouthes, that which they swallow downe their throates. God so loue mee, as I loue the quick witted Italians, and therfore loue them the more because they mortally detest this surley swinish Generation. I neede not fetch colours from other Countryes to paint the vgly visage of Pride, since her picture is set foorth in so manie painted faces here at home.

They will blow their nose in a box, and say it is the spettle that Diogenes spet in ones face: who being inuited to dinner to his house, that was neate and braue in all poynts as might be deuised, and the grunting Dog somwhat troubled with the rheume (by meanes of his long fasting and staying for dinner more than wont) spet full in his Hosts face: and being askt the reason of it? said, it was the foulest place he could spie out in all his house.

And hence comes it, that proud men repine at others prosperitie, and grieue that anie should be great but themselues.

Sotericus the Surgeon was cholericke at the sight of Sturgeon.   [  The nature of the Irish man. ] The Irishman will draw his dagger, and bee readie to kill and slay, if one breake winde in his companie: and so some of our English men that are Souldiers, if one giue them the lye: but these are light matters, whereof Pierce complaineth not.

One while, the Parson sueth the parishioner for bringing home his tythes: another while, the Parishioner sueth the Parson for not taking away his Tythes in time. I heard a tale of a Butcher,    [  A merry tale of Butcher & his Calues. ] who driuing two Calues ouer a Common, that were coupled together by the neckes with an Oken Wyth. In the way where they should passe, there lay a poore leane Mare with a galde backe, to whome they comming (as chance fell out) one of one side, and the other of the other, smelling on her (as their manner is) the midst of the Wyth that was betwixt their necks, rubd her and grated her on the sore backe, that shee started and rose vp, and hung them both on her backe as a beame, which being but a rough plaister to hir raw vlcer, she ra away with them (as she were frantick) into the Fens, where the Butcher could not follow them, and drownde both her selfe and them in a Quagmyre. Now the owner of the Mare is in law with the Butcher for the losse of his Mare, & the Butcher enterchangeably endites him for his Calues. I pray ye Timothie Tempter, be an Arbitrator betwixt them, & couple them both by the neckes (as the Calues were) and carrie them to Hel on your backe, and then I hope they will be quiet. The chiefe spur vnto wrath is Drunkennes, which as the touch of an Ashen bough, causeth a gidinesse in the Uipers head, and the Batte lightly strooke with the leafe of a Tree, loseth his remembrance: so they being but lightly sprinckled with the iuyce of the Hop, become sencelesse, and haue their reason strooken blind, as soone as euer the Cup sealeth the Fortresse of their Nose. Then run their words at random like a dog that runnes after his master, and are vppe with this man and that man, and generally inuey against all men: but those that keepe a wette corner for a friend, and will not thinke scorne to drinke with a good fellowe and a Souldiour: and so long doe they practise this traine on the Ale-bench, that when they are sober they cannot leaue it. There be them that gette their lyuing all the yeere long, by nothing but rayling. Not farre from Chester I knewe an odde foule mouthde    [  A tale of one Fryer Charles, a foule mouthde knaue. ] knaue, called Charles the Fryer, that had a face so parboyled with mens spitting on it, and a backe so often knighted in Bridewell, that it was impossible for any shame or punishment, to terrifie him from ill speaking. Noblemen hee would liken to more vgly things than himselfe: some, to After my most hearty commendations, with a dash ouer the head: others, to guilded chines of beefe, or a shooemaker sweating, when hee pulles on a shooe: another, to an olde verse in Cato , Ad consilium ne accesseris, antequam voceris: an other, to a Spanish Codpisse: an other, that his face was not yet finisht, with such like innumerable absurd allusions: yea, what was he in the Court, but he had a comparison in stead of a Capcase to put him in. Upon a time being challengde at his owne weapon in a priuate Chamber, by a great personage, (rayling I meane) he so farre outstript him in villainous words, and ouer-bandied him in bitter terms, that the name of sport could not perswade him patience, or containe his furie in anie degrees of iest, but needes hee must wreake himselfe vpon him: neither would a common reuenge suffice him, his displeasure was so infinite, (and it may be common reuenges he tooke before, as farre as the whipcord would stretch, vpon like prouokements) wherefore he caused his men to take him, and bricke him vp in a narrow chimney, that was Neque maior neque minor corpore locato, where he fed him for fifteene dayes with bread  & water through a hole, letting him sleepe standing if he would, for lye or sit he could not: and then he let him out to see if he could learne to rule his tongue anie better. It is a disparagement to those that haue anie true spark of Gentilitie, to be noted of the whole world so to delight in detracting, that they should keepe a venomous toothde Curre, and feede him with the crums that fall from his table, to doe nothing but bite euery one by the shins that passe by. If they will needes be merrie, let them haue a foole, and not a knaue to disport them, and seeke some other to bestow their almes on, than such an impudent begger. As there be them that rayle at all men, so there be them that rayle at all Artes, as Cornelius Agrippa De vanitate Scientiarum, and a Treatise that I haue seene in dispraise of Learning, where he saith, it is the corrupter of the simple, the schoolemaster of sinne, the storehouse of treacherie, the reuiuer of vices, and mother of cowardize: alleadging manie examples, how there was neuer man egregiouslie euill but hee was a Scholler; that when the vse of letters was first inuented, the Golden World ceased, Facinusque inuasit mortales ; how Studie doth effeminate a man, dimme his sight, weaken his braine, and engender a thousand diseases. Small learning would serue to confute so manifest a scandale, and I imagine all men like my selfe so vnmoueablie resolued of the excellence thereof, that I will not by the vnderpropping of confutation seeme to giue the idle witted aduersarie so much encouragement, as he shuld surmize his superficiall arguments had shaken the foundation of it: gainst which he could neuer haue lifted his penne, if herself had not helpt him to hurt herselfe. With the enemies of Poetry I care not if I haue a   [  A inuectiue against the enemies of Poetry. ] bout, and those are they that tearme our best Writers but babling Ballat-makers, holding them fantastical fooles that haue wit, but cannot tell how to vse it; I my selfe haue beene so censured among some dull headed ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Absit arrogantia, that this speech should concerne all diuines, but such dunces as abridge me of their lawfull lyberty, and care not how vnprepared they speake to their Auditory. ] Diuines: who deeme it no more cunning to write an exquisit Poem, than to preach pure Caluin, or distill the iuice of a Commentary into a quarter Sermon; Proue it when you will, you slow spirited Saturnists, that haue nothing but the pilfries of your penne, to pollish an exhortation withall: no eloquence but Tantologies, to tye the eares of your Auditory vnto you: no inuention but heere is to be noted, I stole this note out of Beza or Marlorat : no wit to moue, no passion to vrge, but onely an ordinary forme of preaching, blowen vp by vse of often hearing and speaking; and you shall finde there goes more exquisite paynes and purity of wit, to the writing of one such rare Poem as Rosamond, than to a hundred of your dunsticall ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Such Sermons I meane, as our sectuaries preach in ditches and other Conuenticles when they leape from the Coblers stall to their pulpits.

New Herrings new we must cry, euery time we make our selues publique, or else we shall be christned with a hundred newe tytles of Idiotisme.; Nor is Poetry an Art, whereof there is no vse in a mans whole life, but to describe discontented thoughts and youthfull desires: for there is no study, but it dooth illustrate & beautifie. How admirably shine those Diuines aboue the common mediocritie, that haue tasted the sweet springs of Pernassus ? Siluer tongu'd Smith , whose well tun'd stile hath made thy death the generall teares of the Muses,    [  Encomium H Smithi. ] queintlye couldst thou deuise heauenly Ditties to Apolloes Lute, and teach stately verse to trip it as smoothly, as if Ouid & thou had but one soule. Hence along did it proceede, that thou wert such a plausible pulpit man: before thou entredst into the wonderfull wayes of Theologie, thou refinedst, preparedst, and purifiedst thy wings with sweete Poetrie. If a simple mans censure may be admitted to speake in such an open Theater of opinions, I neuer saw abundant reading better mixt with delight, or sentences which no man can challenge of prophane affectation, sounding more melodious to the eare or piercing more deepe to the heart. To them that demaund what fruites the Poets of our time bring forth,   [ The fruits of Poetry. ] or wherein they are able to approue themselues necessarie to the state. Thus I answere. First and formost, they haue cleansed our language from barbarisme, and made the vulgar sort here in London (which is the fountaine whose riuers flowe round about England ) to aspire to a richer puritie of speach, than is communicated with the Comminaltie of anie Nation vnder heauen. The vertuous by their praises they encourage to be more vertuous; to vicious men they are as infernall hags to haunt their ghosts with eternall infamie after death. The Souldiour in hope to haue his high deedes celebrated by their pens, despiseth a whole Armie of perills, and acteth wonders exceeding all humane coniecture. Those that care neither for God nor the diuell, by their quills are kept in awe. Multi famam (saith one) pauci conscientiam verentur .  1 Let God see what he wil, they would be loath to haue the shame of the world. What age wil not prayse immortall Sir Phillip Sidney, whom noble Salustius (that thrice singuler french Poet) hath famoused: together with Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, & merry Sir Thomas Moore, for the chiefe pillers of our english speech. Not so much but Chaucers host, Baly in Southwarke, and his wife of Bath he keepes such a stirre with, in his Canterbury tales, shalbe talkt of whilst the Bath is vsde, or there be euer a badde house in Southwark. Gentles, it is not your lay Chronigraphers,   [  The disprayse of laie chronigraphers. ] that write of nothing but of Mayors and Sheriefs, and the deare yeers, and the great Frost, that can endowe your names wyth neuer dated glory: for they want ye wings of choyse words to flye to heauen, which wee haue: they cannot sweeten a discourse, or wrest admiration fro men reading, as we can: reporting the meanest accident. Poetry is the hunny of all flowers, the quintessence of all Scyences, the Marrowe of Witte, and the very Phrase of Angels: how much better is it then to haue an eligant Lawyer to plead ones cause, than a stutting Townsman that loseth himselfe in his tale, and dooth nothing but make legs: so much is it better for a Nobleman or Gentleman, to haue his honours story related, and his deedes emblazond by a Poet, than a Cittizen. Alas poore latynlesse Authors, they are so simple they knowe not what they doe; They no sooner spy a new Ballad, and his name to it that compilde it: but they put him in for one of the learned men of our time. I maruell how the Masterlesse men, that sette vp their bills in Paules for seruices, and such as paste vp their papers on euery post, for Arithmatique and writing schooles, scape eternitie amongst them; I beleeue both they and the Knight Marshals men, that nayle vp Mandates at the Court gate, for annoying the Pallace with filth or making water, if they set their names to the writing, will shortly make vp the number of the learned men of our time, and be as famous as the rest. For my part I do challenge no praise of learning to my selfe, yet haue I worne a gowne in the Uniuersity, and so hath caret tempus non habet moribus: but this I dare presume that if any Mecoenas binde mee to him by his bounty, or extend some round liberalitie to mee worth the speaking of, I will doe him as much honour as any Poet of my beardlesse yeeres shall in England . Not that I am so confident what I can doe, but that I attribute so much to my thankfull mind aboue others, which I am perswaded would enable me to worke myracles. On the contrary side, if I bee euill intreated, or sent a way with a Flea in mine eare, let him looke that I will rayle on him soundly: not for an houre or a day, whiles the iniury is fresh in my memory: but in some elaborate pollished Poem, which I will leaue to the world when I am dead, to be a lyuing Image to all ages, of his beggerly parsimony and ignoble illiberaltie: and let him not (what soeuer he be) measure the weight of my words by this booke, where I write Quicquid in buccam venerit, as fast as my hand can trot: but I haue tearmes (if I be vext) laid in steepe in Aqua fortis , and Gunpowder, that shall rattle through the Skyes, and make an Earthquake in a Pesants eares. Put case (since I am not yet out of the Theame of Wrath) that some tyred Iade belonging to the Presse,    [  I would tell you in what booke it is, but I am afrayde it would make hys booke sell in hys latter dayes, which hetherto hath lien dead & bin a great losse to the Printer. ] whome I neuer wrongd in my life; hath named me expressely in Print (as I will not doo him) and accused me of want of learning, vpbraiding me for reuiuing in an epistle of mine the reuerend memorie of Sir Thomas Moore, Sir Iohn Cheeke , Doctor Watson, Doctor Haddon, Doctor Carre, Master Ascham ; as if they were no meate but for his Masterships mouth, or none but some such as the sonne of a ropemaker were worthie to mention them. To shewe how I can rayle, thus would I begin to rayle on him. Thou that hadst thy hood turnd ouer thy eares when thou wert a Batchelor, for abusing of Aristotle , and setting him vp on the Schoole gates painted with Asses eares on his head: is it anie discredit for me, thou great Baboune , thou Pigmee Braggart , thou Pamphleter of nothing but ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Looke at the chandlers shop, or at the Flax-wiues stall, if you see no tow nor Sope wrapt vp in the tytle page of such a Pamphlet, as Incerti AuthorisIo Paean. ] Paeans, to bee censured by thee, that hast scorned the Prince of Philosophers; thou that in thy Dialogues soldst Hunnie for a halfepenie, and the choycest Writers extant for cues a peece; that cam'st to the Logick Schooles when thou wert a Fresh-man, and writst phrases; off with thy gowne and vntrusse, for I meane to lash thee mightily.

Gentlemen, I am sure you haue heard of a ridiculous Asse, that manie yeares since sold lyes by the great, & wrote an absurd Astrologicall Discourse of the terrible Coniunction of Saturne and Iupiter , wherein (as if hee had latelie cast the Heauens water, or been at the anatomizing of the Skies intrayles in Surgeons hall) hee prophecieth of such strang wonders to ensue from starres distemperature, & the vniuersal adultry of Planets, as none but he that is Bawd to those celestiall bodies, could euer descry. What expectation there was of it both in towne & country, the amazement of those times may testifie: and the rather because he pawned his ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Which at home iwis was worth a dozen of halters at least for if I be not deceiud his father was a Rope-maker. ] creditd vpon it, in these expresse tearmes; If these things fall not out in euerie poynt as I haue wrote, let mee for euer hereafter loose the credit of my Astronomie . Wel so it happend, that he happend not to be a man of his word; his Astronomie broke his day with his creditors, and Saturne and Iupiter proou'd honester men than all the World tooke them for: wherevpon, the poore Prognosticator was readie to runne himselfe through with his Iacobs Staffe, & cast himselfe headlong from the top of a Globe (as a mountaine) and breake his necke. The whole Uniuersitie hyst at him, Tarlton at the Theater made iests of him, and Elderton consumed his ale-crammed nose to nothing, in bear-bayting him with whole bundells of ballets. Would you in likely reason gesse it were possible for anie shame-swoln toad to haue the spet-proofe face to outliue this disgrace? It is deare brethren, Viuit, imo viuit, and which is more, he is a Uicar. Poore Slaue, I pitie thee that thou hadst no more grace but to come in my way. Why, could not you haue sate quyet at home, and writ Catechismes, but you must be comparing me to Martin ? and exclayme against me for reckning vp the high Schollers of worthie memorie? Iupiter ingeniis pr aebet sua numina vatum, saith Ouid : Seque celebrari quolibet ore sinit . Which if it be so, I hope I am Aliquis, & those men quos honoris causa nominaui are not greater than Gods. Me thinks I see thee stand quiuering and quaking and euen now lift vp thy hands to heauen, as thanking God my choler is somewhat asswag'd: but thou art deceiued, for howeuer I let fall my stile a little to talk in reason with thee that hast none, I doo not meane to let thee scape so. Thou hast wronged one for my sake (whom for the name I must loue) T. N. the Master Butler of Pembrooke Hall, a farre better Scholler than thy selfe (in my Iudgement) and one that sheweth more discretion and gouernment, in setting vp a sise of Bread, than thou in all thy whole booke. Why man, thinke no scorne of him, for he hath held thee vp a hundred times, whiles the Deane hath giuen thee correction, and thou hast capd and kneed him (when thou wert hungry) for a chipping; But thats nothing, for hadst thou neuer beene beholding to him, nor holden vp by him, he hath a Beard that is a better Gentleman than all thy whole body, and a graue countenance like Cato, able to make thee run out of thy wits for feare, if he looke sternly vpon thee. I haue reade ouer thy Sheepish discourse of the Lambe of God and his enemies, and entreated my patience to bee good to thee whilst I read it: but for all that I could doe with my selfe, (as I am sure I may doe as much as an other man) I could not refrayne, but bequeath it to the Priuie, leafe by leafe as I read it, it was so vgly, dorbellicall, and lamish. Monstrous, monstrous, and palpable, not to be spoken of in a Christian Congregation: thou hast skumd ouer the Schoole men, and of the froth of theyr folly, made a dish of diuinitie Brewesse, which the dogges will not eate. If the Printer haue any great dealings with thee, he were best get a priuiledge betimes, Ad imprimendum solum , forbidding all other to sell waste paper but himselfe, or else he will be in a wofull taking. thou art, for else I doubt thou wilt be driuen to leaue all and fall to thy fathers occupation, which is, to goe and make a rope to hange thy selfe.

Redio ad vos mei Auditores, haue I not a indifferent pretty veine in spurgalling an Asse? if you knew how extemporall it were at this instant, and with what haste it is writ you would say so. But I would not haue you thinke that all this that is set downe heere, is in good earnest, for then you goe by S. Gyles, the wrong way to Westminster: but onely to shew how for a neede I could rayle, if I were throughly fyred. So hoe, Honiger Hammon, where are you all thys while, I cannot be acquainted with you? Tell me what doe you thinke of the case, am I subiect to the sinne of Wrath I write against or no, in whetting my penne on this block. I know you would faine haue it so, but it shal not choose but be otherwise for this once. Come on let vs turne ouer a new leafe, and heare what Gluttony can say for her selfe, for Wrath hath spet his poyson, and full platters doe well after extreame purging. The Romayne Emperours that succeeded Augustus,    [  The complaynt of Gluttonie. ] were exceedingly giuen to this horrible vice, whereof some of them would feede on nothing but the tongues of Phesants and Nightingales: other, would spend as much at one banquet, as a Kings reuenues came too in a yeare; whose excesse I would decypher at large, but that a new Laureate hath sau'd me the labor: who for a man that stands vpon paines & not wit, hath perform'd as much, as anie Storie dresser may doo, that sets a new English nap on an olde Latine Apothegs. It is enough for me to licke dishes here at home, though I feed not mine eyes at anie of the Romane feasts. Much good doo it you Master Diues here in London: for you are he my pen meanes to dine withall. Miserere mei, what a fat churle it is? Why, he hath a belly as big as the round Church in Cambridge , a face as huge as the whole bodie of a base viall, and legs that if they were hollow, a man might keepe a mill in either of them. Experto crede Roberto, there is no mast like a Merchaunts table. Bona fide it is a great misture, that we haue not men swine as well as beasts, for then wee should haue porke that hath no more bones than a pudding, and a side of bacon that you might lay vnder your head in stead of a bolster. It is not for nothing, that other Countreyes whome wee vpbrayd with Drunkennesse, call vs bursten-bellyed Gluttons: for we make our greedie paunches powdring tubs of beefe, and eate more meate at one meale, than the Spaniard or Italian in a month.

A stranger that should come to one of our Magnificoes houses, when dinner were set on the boord, and he not yet set, would think the goodman of the house were a Haberdasher of Wylde-fowle, or a Merchant venturer of daintie meate, that sells commodities of good cheere by the great, and hath Factors in Arabia, Turkey, Egipt, and Barbarie, to prouide him of straunge Byrdes, China mustard, and odde patternes to make Custards by. Lord, what a coyle haue we with this Course and that Course, remoouing this dish higher, setting another lower, and taking a way the third. A Generall might in lesse space remoue his Camp, than they stand disposing of their Gluttonie. And whereto tends all this gurmandise, but to giue sleepe grosse humours to feede on, to corrupt the braine, and make it vnapt and vnweldie for anie thing. The Romane Censors if they lighted vppon a fat corpulent man, they straight tooke away his horse, and constrayned him to goe a foote; positiuely concluding, his carkasse was so puft vp with gluttonie or idlenes. If wee had such horse-takers amongst vs, and that surfet swolne Churles, who now ride on their foot-cloathes, might bee constrayned to carrie their flesh budgets from place to place on foote, the price of veluet and cloath would fall with their bellies, and the gentle craft ( alias the red herrings kinsmen) get more  & drink lesse. Plenus venter nil agit libenter, & plures gula occidit quam gladius . It is as desperate a peece of seruice to sleep vpon a full stomacke as it is to serue in face of the bullet: a man is but his breath, and that may as wel be stopt by putting too much in his mouth at once, as runing on the mouth of the Cannon. That is verified of vs, which Horace writes of an outragious eater in his time, Quicquid qu aesierat ventri donabat auaro, Whatsoeuer he could rap or rend, he confiscated to his couetous gut. Nay, we are such flesh-eating Saracens, that chast fish may not content vs, but we delight in the murder of innocent mutton, in the vnpluming of pullerie, and quartering of calues and oxen. It is horrible and detestable, no godly Fishmonger that can digest it. Report (which our moderners clepe flundring Fame) puts mee in memorie of a notable iest I heard long agoe of Doctor   [ A rare wittie iest of Doctor Watsons. ] Watson, verie conducible to the reproofe of these fleshly minded ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Or rather belly-alls, because all theyr mind is on theyr belly. ] Belials . He being at supper on a fasting or fish night at least, with a great number of his friends and acquaintance, there chanced to be in the companie an outlandish Doctor, who when all other fell to such victuals (agreeing to the time) as were before them, he ouerslipt them; and there being one ioynt of flesh on the table for such as had meate stomackes, fell freshly to it. After that hunger (halfe conquered) had restored him to the vse of his speach, for his excuse he said to his friend that brought him thether, Profecto Domine; ego sum malissimus piscator, meaning by piscator , a Fishman: (which is a libertie, as also malissimus , that out-landish men in their familiar talke doo challenge, at least vse aboue vs.) At tu es bonissimus carnifex, quoth Doctor Watson, retorting very merily his owne licentious figures vpon him. So of vs may it be said we are Malissimi piscatores, but bonissimi carnifices . I would English the iest for the edification of the temporaltie, but that it is not so good in English as in Latine: and though it were as good, it would not conuert clubs and clowted shoone from the flesh-pots of Egipt , to the Prouant of the Low countreyes; for they had rather (with the Seruing-man put vp a Supplication to the Parliament house, that they might haue a yard of pudding for a penie, than desire (with the Baker) there might bee three ounces of bread sold for a halfe penie. [  The moderation of Fryer Alphonso, king Phillips Confessor. ] Alphonsus King Philips Confessor that came ouer with him to England , was such a moderate man in his dyet, that he would feede but once a day, and at that time hee would feed so slenderly and sparingly as scarse serued to keep life and soule together; one night importunately inuited to a solempne banquet, for fashion sake he sate downe among the rest, but by no entreatie could be drawne to eate any thing: at length frute being set on the boord, he reacht an apple out of the dish, aud put it in his pocket; which one marking, that safe right ouer against him, askt him. Domine cur es solicitus in crastinum? Sir, why are you carefull for the morrowe? Whereto he answered most soberly, Imo hoc facio mi amice, vt ne sim solicitus in crastinum : No, I doo it my friend, that I may not be carefull for the morrow : as though his appetite were a whole day contented with so little as an apple, and that it were enough to pay the morrowes tribute to Nature.

Upon a day entring into a deepe melancholie by himselfe, hee fell into a discoursiue consideration, what this world was, how vaine and transitorie the pleasures thereof, and how manie times he had offended God by surfetting, gluttonie, drunkennes, pride, whoredome, & such like, and how hard it was for him that liu'd in that prosperitie that he did, not to bee entangled with those pleasures: whereupon he presently resolu'd twixt God and his owne conscience, to forsake it and all his allurements, and betake him to the seuerest forme of life vsed in their state. And with that cald all his Souldiers and acquaintance together, and making knowen his intent vnto them, he distributed his lyuing and possessions (which were infinite) amongst the poorest of them: and hauing not left himselfe the worth of one farthing vnder heauen, betooke him to the most beggerlie new erected Order of the Frier Capuchines. Their Institution is, that they shall possesse nothing whatsoeuer of their owne, more than the cloathes on their backes, continually to goe barefoote, weare haire shirts, and lye vpon the hard boords winter & summer time: they must haue no meat nor ask any but what is giuen them voluntarily, nor must they lay vp any from meale to meale but giue it to the poore, or els it is a great penaltie. In this seuere humilitie lyues this deuout Countie, and hath done this foure yeare, submitting himselfe to al the base drudgerie of the house, as fetching water, making cleane the rest of their chambers, insomuch as he is the Iunior of the Order. O what a notable rebuke were his honourable Lowlines to succeeding Pride, if this prostrate spirit of his were not the seruaunt of Superstition: or hee misspent not his good workes on a wrong Faith! Let but our English belly-gods punish their pursie bodies with this strict penaunce, and professe the Capuchinisme but one month, and Ile be their pledge they shall not grow so like dry fats as they doo. O it will make them iolly long winded to trot vp and downe the Dorter staires and and the water-tankard will keepe vnder the insurrection of their shoulders, the haire shirt will chase whoredome out of their boanes, and the hard lodging on the boards take their flesh downe a button hole lower. But if they might be induced to distribute all their goods amongst the poore, it were to be hoped Saint Peter would let them dwell in the suburbes of heauen, whereas otherwise they must keepe aloofe at Pancredge , and not come neere the liberties by fiue leagues and aboue. It is your dooing ( Diotrephes Diuell) that these stall-fed cormorants to damnation, must bung vp all the wealth of the Land in their snaphaunce bags, and poore Scholers and Souldiers wander in backe lanes, and the out-shiftes of the Citie, with neuer a rag to their backes: but our trust is, that by some intemperance or other, you will tourne vp their heeles one of these yeares together, and prouide them of such vnthrifts to their heyres, as shall spend in one weeke amongst good fellowes, what they got by extortion and oppression from Gentlemen all their life time. From Gluttonie in meates,   [  The complaint of Drunkennes ] let me discend to superfluitie in drink: a sinne, that euer since we haue mixt our selues with the Low-countries, is counted honourable: but before we knew their lingring warres, was held in the highest degree of hatred that might be.   [ Drinking super nagulum, a deuise of drinking new come out of Fraunce: which is, after a man hath turnde vp the bottom of the cup, to drop it on hys nayle and make a pearl with that is left, which if it slide & he cannot mak stand on, by reason thers too much, he must drinke againe for his penance. ] Then if wee had seene a man goe wallowing in the streetes, or line sleeping vnder the boord, wee would haue spet at him as a toade, and cald him foule drunken swine, and warnd all our friends out of his company: now he is no body that cannot drinke super nagulum , carouse the Hunters hoope, quaffe vpsey freze crosse, with leapes, gloues, mumpes, frolickes, and a thousand such dominering inuentions. He is reputed a pesaunt and a boore that will not take his licour profoundly. And you shall heare a Caualier of the first feather, a princockes that was but a Page the other day in the Court, and now is all to be frenchified in his Souldiours sute, stand vpon termes with Gods wounds you dishonour me sir, you doo me the disgrace if you doo not pledge me as much as I drunke to you: and in the midst of his cups stand vaunting his manhood, beginning euerie sentence, with When I first bore Armes, when he neuer bare anie thing but his Lords rapier after him in his life. If he haue been ouer and visited a towne of Garrison, as a trauailer or passenger, he hath as great experience as the greatest Commander and chiefe Leader in England . A mightie deformer of mens manners and features, is this vnnecessarie vice of all other. Let him bee indued with neuer so manie vertues, and haue as much goodly proportion and fauour as nature can bestow vpon a man: yet if hee be thirstie after his owne destruction, and hath no ioy nor comfort, but when he is drowning his soule in a gallon pot; that one beastly imperfection, wil vtterly obscure all that is commendable in him: and all his good qualities sinke like lead downe to the bottome of his carrowsing cups, where they will lye like lees and dregges, dead and vnregarded of any man. Clim of the clough, thou that vsest to drinke nothing but scalding lead and sulphur in hell, thou art not so greedie of thy night geare. O, but thou hast a foule swallow, if it come once to carrowsing of humane bloud: but thats but sildom once in seauen yeare, when theres a great execution, otherwise thou art tyde at rack and manger, and drinkst nothing but the Aqua vit ae of vengeance all thy life time. The Prouerbe giues it foorth, thou art a knaue, and therefore I haue more hope thou art some manner of a good fellowe: let mee intreate thee (since thou hast other iniquities inough to circumuent vs withall) to wype this sinne out of the catalogue of thy subtilties; helpe to blast the Uynes that they maye beare no more grapes, and sowre the wines in the cellars & Merchants storehouses, that our Countrey-men maye not pisse out all their wit and thrift against the walls.   [  King Edgars ordinance against drinking. ] King Edgar, because his subiects should not offend in swilling and bibbing, as they did, caused certaine yron cups to be chayned to euerie fountaine and wells side, and at euerie Uintners doore, with yron pins in them, to stint euery man how much he should drinke: and he that went beyond one of those pins forfeyted a pennie for euerie draught. And if Stories were well searcht, I beleeue hoopes in quart pots were inuented to that ende, that euerie man should take his hoope, and no more. I haue heard it iustified for a truth by great Personages,   [  The wonderfull abstinence of the Marquesse of Pisana, yet liuing. ] that the olde Marquesse of Pisana (who yet liues) drinkes not once in seauen yeare: and I haue read of one Andron of Argos, that was so sildome thirstie, that hee trauailed ouer the hot burning sands of Lybia, & neuer drank. Then why should our colde Clyme bring foorth such fierie throates. Are we more thirstie than Spaine and Italy, where the Sunnes force is doubled? The Germaines and lowe Dutch, me thinkes should bee continually kept moyst with the foggie ayre and stincking mystes that arise out of theyr fennie soyle: but as their Country is ouer-flowen with water, so are their heads alwayes ouer-flowen with wine, and in their bellyes they haue standing quag-myres and bogs of English beere. One of their breede it was that writ the Booke De Arte bibendi: a worshipfull treatise, fitte for none but Silenus and his Asse to set forth: generall rules and iniunctions, as good as printed precepts, or Statutes set downe by Acte of Parliament that goe from drunkard to drunkard; as still to keepe your first man, not to leaue anie flockes in the bottome of the cup, to knock the glasse on your thumbe when you haue done, to haue some shooing horne to pul on your wine, as a rasher of the coles, or a redde herring, to stirre it about with a candles ende to make it taste better, and not to holde your peace whiles the pot is stirring. Nor haue we one or two kinde of drunkards onely, but eight kindes.   [  The eight kindes of drunkennes ] The first is Ape drunke, and he leapes, and sings, and hollowes, and daunceth for the heauens: the second is Lion drunke, and he flings the pots about the house, calls his Hostesse whore, breakes the glasse windowes with his dagger, and is apt to quarrell with anie man that speaks to him: the third is Swine drunke, heauie, lumpish, and sleepie, and cries for a little more drinke, and a fewe more cloathes: the fourth is Sheepe drunke, wise in his own conceipt, when he cannot bring foorth a right word: the fifth is Mawdlen drunke, when a fellow will weepe for kindnes in the midst of his Ale, and kisse you, saying; By God Captaine I loue thee, goe thy wayes thou dost not thinke so often of me as I doo of thee, I would (if it pleased GOD) I could not loue thee so well as I doo, and then he puts his finger in his eye, and cryes: the sixt is Martin drunke, when a man is drunke, and drinks himselfe sober ere he stirre: the seuenth is Goate drunke, when in his drunkennes he hath no minde but on Lecherie: the eighth is Fox drunke, when he is craftie drunke, as manie of the Dutch men bee, that that will neuer bargaine but when they are drunke. All these Species and more haue I seene practised in one Companie at one sitting, when I haue been permitted to remayne sober amongst them, onely to nose their seuerall humours. Hee that plyes anie one of them harde, it will make him to write admyrable verses, and to haue a deepe casting head, though hee were neuer so verye a Dunce before. Gentlemen,   [  The discommodities of drunkennes. ] all you that will not haue your braynes twice sodden, or your flesh rotten with the Dropsie, that loue not to goe in greasie dublets, stockings out at the heeles, and weare ale-house daggers at your backes, forsweare this slauering brauerie, that will make you haue stinking breathes, and your bodies smell like Brewers aprons: rather keepe a snuffe in the bottome of the glasse to light you to bed withall, than leaue neuer an eye in your head to lead you ouer the threshold. It will bring you in your olde age to be companions with none but Porters and Car-men, to talke out of a Cage, rayling as dronken men are wont, a hundred boyes wondring about them; and to dye sodainly as Fol Long the Fencer did, drinking Aqua vit ae . From which (as all the rest) good Lord deliuer Pierce Penilesse . The nurse of this enormitie (as of all euills) is Idlenes   [  The complaint of Sloth. ] or Sloth, which hauing no painefull Prouince to set him selfe a worke, runnes headlong with the raynes in his own hand into all lasciuiousnesse and sensualitie that maye bee. Men when they are idle, and know not what to do, saith one let vs goe to the Stilliard and drinke Rhenish wine. Nay, if a man knew where a good whorehouse wer saith another, it were somwhat like. Nay saith the third, let vs goe to a dicing house or a bowling alley, and there we shall haue some sport for our money. To one of these three, (at hand quoth pick-purse) your euill Angelship master mani-headed beast conducts them, Vbi quid agitur betwixt you and their soules, be it, for I am no Drawer, Box-keeper, or Pandar, to bee priuie to their sports. If I were to paint Sloth, (as I am not seene in the sweetnings) by Saint Iohn the Euangelist I sweare, I would draw it like a Stationer that I knowe, with his thumb vnder his girdle; who if a man come to his stall to aske him for a Booke, neuer stirres his head, or looks vpon him, but stands stone still, and speakes not a word: only with his little finger poynts backwards to his boy, who must be his interpreter,  & so all the day gaping like a dumbe image he sits without motion; except at such times as hee goes to dinner or supper: for then he is as quicke as other three,   [ Videlicet before he come out of his bed, then a set breakfast, the dinner, then after noones nunchings, a supper, & a rere-supper. ] eating sixe times euerie day. If I would raunge abroad, and looke in at sluggards key holes, I should finde a number lying a bed to saue charges of ordinaries, & in winter when they want firing, loosing halfe a weeks Commons together, to keepe them warme in the linnen. And hold you content, this Summer an vnder-meale of an afternoone long doth not amisse to exercise the eyes withall. Fat-men and Farmers sonnes that sweate much with eating harde cheese and drinking olde wine, must haue some more ease than yong boyes that take their pleasure all day running vp and downe. Setting iesting aside,   [  Which is better of the idle glutton, or vagrant vnthrift. ] I hold it a great disputable question, which is a more euill man, of him that is an idle glutton at home, or a retchlesse vnthrift abroad? The glutton at home doth nothing but engender diseases, pamper his flesh vnto lust, and is good for none but his owne gut: the vnthrift a broad exerciseth his bodie at dauncing schoole, fence schoole, tennis, and all such recreations, the vintners, the victuallers, the dicing houses, and who not, get by him. Suppose he lose a little now and then at play, it teacheth him wit: and how should a man know to eschue vices, if his owne experience did not acquaint him with their inconueniences? Omne ignotum pro magnifico est: that villanie we haue made no assayes in, we admyre. Besides, my vagrant Reueller haunts Playes, and sharpens his wits with frequenting the companie of Poets; he emboldens his blushing face by courting faire women on the sodaine, and lookes into all Estates, by conuersing with them in publique places. Now tell me whether of these two, the heauie headed gluttonous house doue, or this liuely wanton yong Gallant, is like to proue the wiser man, and better member in the Commonwealth. If my youth might not be thought partiall, the fine qualified Gentleman, although vnstaid, should carie it clean away from the lazie clownish droane. Sloth in Nobilitie, Courtiers, Schollers, or anie men,    [  The effects of Sloth. ] is the chiefest cause that brings them in contempt. For as industrie and vnfatigable toyle raiseth meane persons from obscure houses to high throanes of authoritie: so Sloth and sluggish securitie causeth proud Lordes to tumble from the towers of their starrie discents, and bee trod vnder foote of euery inferiour Besonian. Is it the lofty treading of a Galliard, or fine grace in telling of a loue tale amongst Ladies; can make a man reuerenst of the multitude? no, they care not for the false glistring of gay garments, or insinuating curtesie of a carpet Peere; But they delight to see him shine in Armour, and oppose himselfe to honourable daunger, to participate a voluntarie penny with his souldiours, and relieue part of theyr wants out of his own purse. That is the course he that will be popular must take, which if hee neglect, and sit dallying at home, nor will be awakt by anie indignities out of his loue dreame, but suffer euery vpstart groome to defie him, set him at naught, and shake him by the beard vnreuengd, let him straight take Orders, and bee a Church-man, and then his patience may passe for a vertue: but otherwise, to be suspected of cowardise, and not car'd for of anie.   [  The means to auoyde Slouth. ] The onely enemie to Sloth, is contention and emulation; as to propose one man to my selfe, that is the onely myrrour of our Age, and striue to out-goe him in vertue. But this strife must so be tempred, that we fal not from the eagernes of praise, to the enuying of their persons: for then we leaue running to the goale of glorie, to spurne at a stone that lyes in our way; and so did Atlante in the midst of her course stoup to take vp the golden apple her enemie scattered in her way, and was out runne by Hippomenes . The contrarie to this contention & emulation, is securitie, peace, quiet, tranquillitie, when we haue no aduersarie to pry into our actions, no malicious eye, whose pursuing our priuate behauiour, might make vs more vigilant ouer our imperfections, than otherwise we would be. That State or Kingdome that is in league with all the World, and hath no forreyne sword to vexe it, is not halfe so strong or confirmed to endure, as that which liues euerie houre in feare of inuasion. There is a certaine wast of the people for whom there is no vse, but warre: and these men must haue some employment still to cut them off: Nam si foras hostem non habent, domi inuenient, If they haue no seruice abroad, they will make mutinies at home. Or if the affaires of the State be such, as cannot exhale all these corrupt excrements, it is verie expedient they haue some lyght toyes to busie their heads withall, to cast before them as bones to gnaw vppon, which may keepe them from hauing leasure to intermeddle with higher matters. To this effect,    [  The defence of Playes. ] the policie of Playes is verie necessarie, howeuer some shallow-braynd censurers (not the deepest serchers into the secrets of gouernment) mightily oppugne them. For whereas the after-noone being the eldest time of the day; wherein men that are their owne masters, (as Gentlemen of the Court, the Innes of the Court, and the number of Captaines and Souldiours about London ) doo wholly bestow themselues vpon pleasure, and that pleasure they deuide (how vertuously it skills not) either into gameing, following of harlots, drinking, or seeing a Play: is it not then better (since of foure extreames all the world cannot keepe them but they will choose one) that they should betake them to the least, which is Playes? Nay, what if I prooue Playes to be no extreame, but a rare exercise of vertue? First, for the subiect of them (for the most part) it is borrowed out of our English Chronicles, wherein our forefathers valiant actes (that haue lyne long buried in rustie brasse and worme-eaten bookes) are reuiued, and they them selues raysed from the Graue of Obliuion, and brought to pleade their aged Honours in open presence: than which, what can bee a sharper reproofe, to these degenerate effeminate dayes of ours? How would it haue ioyd braue Talbot (the terror of the French) to thinke that after he had lyne two hundred yeare in his Toomb, he should triumph againe on the Stage, and haue his bones new embalmed with the teares of ten thousand spectators at least, (at seuerall times) who in the Tragedian that represents his person, imagine they behold him fresh bleeding. I will defend it against anie Collian, or club fisted Usurer of them all, there is no immortalitie can be giuen a man on earth like vnto Playes. What talke I to them of immortalitie, that are the onely vnderminers of Honour, and doo enuie anie man that is not sprung vp by base Brokerys like themselues. They care not if all the auncient Houses were rooted out, so that like the Burgomasters of the Low-countries they might share the gouernment amongst them as States, & be quarter-masters of our Monarchy. Al Arts to them are vanitie: and if you tell them what a glorious thing it is to haue Henry the fifth represented on the Stage leading the French King prisoner, and forcing both him and the Dolphin sweare fealtie. I, but (will they say) what doo we get by it? Respecting neither the right of Fame that is due to true Noblitie deceased, nor what hopes of eternitie are to be proposed to aduentrous minds, to encourage them forward, but onely their execrable lucre, and filthie vnquenchable auarice. They know when they are dead they shall not bee brought vpon the Stage for any goodnes, but in a merriment of the Usurer and the Diuel, or buying Armes of the Herald, who giues them the Lyon without tongue, tayle, or tallents, because his master whom he must serue is a Townsman, and a man of peace, and must not keepe anie quarrelling beasts to annoy his honest neighbours. In Playes,   [  The vse of Playes. ] all coosonages, all cunning drifts ouerguylded with outward holinesse, all stratagems of warre, all the canker- wormes that breede on the rust of peace, are most liuely anotomiz'd: they shew the ill successe of treason, the fall of hastie climbers, the wretched ende of vsurpers, the miserie of ciuill dissention, & howe iust God is euermore in punishing of murther. And to prooue euerie one of these allegations, could I propound the circumstaunces of this play and that play, if I meant to handle this Theame other wise than obiter . What should I say more? they are sower pills of reprehension wrapt vp in sweete words. Whereas some Petitioners to the Counsaile against them obiect, they corrupt the youth of the Citie, and withdrawe Prentises from their worke;    [  The confutation of Cittizens obiections against Playes. ] they heartely wish they might bee troubled with none of their youth nor their prentises; for some of them (I meane the ruder handicraftes seruaunts) neuer come abroad, but they are in danger of vndooing: and as for corrupting them when they come, thats false; for no Plays they haue, encourageth anie man to tumults or rebellion, but layes before such the halter and the gallowes; or prayseth or approoueth pride, lust, whoredome, prodigalitie, or drunkennes, but beates them downe vtterly. As for the hindrance of Trades and Traders of the Citie by them, that is an Article foysted in by the vintners, alewiues, and victuallers, who surmise if there were no Playes, they should haue all the companie that resort to them, lye bowzing and beere-bathing in their houses euerie after-noone Nor so, nor so, good brother bottle-ale, for there are other places besides where money can bestow it selfe: the signe of the smocke will wype your mouth clean; and yet I haue heard ye haue made her a tenaunt to your tap-houses. But what shall he doo that hath spent himselfe? where shall he haunt? Faith, when dice, lust, and drunkennes, and all haue dealt vppon him, if there bee neuer a Playe for him to goe too for his peny, he sits melancholy in his chamber, deuising vpon felonie or treason, and how hee may best exalt himselfe by mischiefe. In Augustus time (who was the Patrone of all wittye sports) there hapned a great Fray in Rome about a Player, insomuch as all the Citie was in an vproare: whereupon, the Emperour (after the broyle was somwhat ouer-blown) cald the Player before him, and askt what was the reason that a man of his qualitie durst presume to make such a brawle about nothing. He smilingly replide, It is good for thee O C aesar, that the peoples heads are troubled with brawles and quarrels about vs and our light matters:   [  A Players witty answere to Augustus. ] for otherwise they would looke into thee and thy matters . Read Lipsius or anie prophane or Christian Politician, and you shall finde him of this opinion. Our Players are not as the players beyond sea, a sort of squirting baudie Comedians, that haue whores and common Curtizans to play womens   [  A comparison twixt our Players and the Players beyond the Sea. ] parts, and forbeare no immodest speach or vnchast action that may procure laughter, but our Sceane is more stately furnisht than euer it was in the time of Roscius, our representations honorable, and full of gallaunt resolution, not consisting like theirs of a Pantaloun, a Whore, and a Zanie, but of Emperours, Kings and Princes: whose true Tragedies (Sophocleo cothurno) they doo vaunt. Not Roscius nor  Æsope those Tragedians admyred before Christ was borne, could euer performe more in action, than famous Ned Allen .   [  The due commendation of Ned Allen. ] I must accuse our Poets of sloth and partialitie, that they will not boast in large impressions what worthie men (aboue all Nations) England affoords. Other Countreyes cannot haue a Fidler breake a string, but they will put it in Print, and the olde Romanes in the writings they published, thought scorne to vse anie but domestical examples of their owne home-bred Actors, Schollers and Champions, and them they woulde extoll to the third and fourth Generation: Coblers, Tinkers, Fencers, none escapt them, but they mingled them all in one Gallimafry of glory. Heere I haue vsed a like Methode, not of tying my selfe to mine owne Countrey, but by insisting in the experience of our time; and if I euer write any thing in Latine, (as I hope one day I shall) not a man of any desert heere amongst vs, but I will haue vp. Tarlton, Ned Allen, Knell, Bentley , shall be made knowen to Fraunce, Spayne, and Italie: and not a part that they surmounted in, more than other, but I will there note and set downe, with the manner of their habites and attyre. The child of Sloth is Lechery,    [  The seauenth & last complaynt of Lechery. ] which I haue plac't last in my order of handling: a sinne that is able to make a man wicked that should describe it; for it hath more starting- holes, than a siue hath holes, more Clyents than Westminster-hall, more diseases than Newgate . Call a Leete at Byshopsgate ,  & examine how euery second house in Shorditch is maintayned: make a priuie search in Southwarke , and tel mee how many Shee-Inmates you finde: nay, goe where you will in the Suburbes, and bring me two Uirgines that haue vowd Chastity, and Ile build a Nunnery. Westminster, Westminster, much maydenhead hast thou to answere for at the day of Iudgement, thou hadst a Sanctuary in thee once, but hast few Saints left in thee now. Surgeons and Appothecaries, you know what I speake is true: for you liue (like Sumners) vppon the sinnes of the people; tell me, is there any place so lewde as this Lady London? not a Wench sooner creepes out of the shell, but she is of the Religion. Some wiues will sowe Mandrake in theyr gardens, and crosse-neighborhood with them is counted goodfellowship. The Court I dare not touch, but surely there (as in the Heauens) bee many falling starres and but one true Diana . Consuetudo peccandi, tollit sensum peccati . Custome is a Lawe, and Lust holdes it for a Lawe, to liue without Lawe. Lais that had so many Poets to her Louers, could not alwaies preserue her beautie with their prayses. Marble will weare away with much rayne: Gold wil rust with moyst keeping:  & the ritchest Garments are subiect to Times Moath-frets; Clitemnestra , that slewe her husband to enioy the Adulterer Ægistus, and bathde herselfe in Milke euery day to make her younge againe, had a time when shee was ashamed to viewe herselfe in a looking-glasse, and her bodie withered, her minde being greene. The people poynted at her for a murtherer, yonge children howted at her as a strumpet: shame, misery, sicknesse, beggery, is the best end of vncleannesse. Lais, Cleopatra, Helen , if our Clyme hath any such, noble Lord warden of the Wenches & Anglers, I commend them with the rest of our vncleane sisters in Shorditch , the Spittle, Southwarke, Westminster, and Turnbull streete, to the protection of your Portership: hoping you will speedily carry them to hell, there to keepe open house for all yonge deuills that come, and not let our ayre bee contaminated with theyr sixpenny damnation any and longer. Your Diuelships bounden execrator. Pierce Pennilesse . A supplication calst thou this, (quoth the Knight of the post) it is the maddest Supplication, that euer I saw; me thinkes thou hast handled all the seauen deadly sinnes in it, and spared none that exceedes his limits in any of them. It is well doone to practise thy wit, but (I beleeue) our Lord will cun thee little thanke for it. The worse for mee (quoth I) if my destenie be such, to lose my labour euery where, but I meane to take my chance be it good or bad. Well hast thou any more that thou wouldest haue me to doe (quoth he?) Onely one sute (quoth I) which is this, that sith opportunitie so conueniently serues, you would acquaint me with the state of your infernall regiment: and what that hell is, where your Lord holdes his throne; whether a world like this, which spirites like outlawes, doe enhabit, who being banisht from heauen, as they are from their Countrey, enuy that any shall be more happie then they: and therefore seeke all meanes possible that Wit or Arte may inuent, to make other men as wretched as themselues: or, whether it be a place of horror, stench, and darknesse, where men see meat, but can get none, or are euer thirstie and ready to swelt for drinke, yet haue not the power to tast the coole streames that runne hard at theyr feete: where ( permutata vicissitudine ) one Ghost torments an other by turnes, and hee that all his life time was a great fornicator, hath all the diseases of lust continually hanging vpon him, and is constrayned (the more to augment his misery) to haue congresse euery howre with hagges and olde witches: and he that was a great drunkard heere on earth, hath his penance assignde him, to carouse himselfe drunke with dishwash and Uineger, and surfet foure times a day, with sower Ale and small Beere: as so of the rest, as the vsurer to swallow moulten gold, the glutton to eate nothing but toades, and the Murtherer to be still stabd with daggers, but neuer dye: or whether (as some phantasticall refyners of phylosophy will needes perswade vs) hell is nothing but error, and that none but fooles and Idiots and mechanicall men that haue no learning shall be damnd, of these doubts if you will resolue me, I shall thinke my self to haue profited greatly by your companie. Hee hearing me so inquisitiue in matters aboue humane capacitie, entertained my greedie humor with this answere. Poets and Philosophers that take a pride in inuenting new opinions, haue sought to renoume their wits, by hunting after strange conceits of heauen and hell; all generally agreeing, that such places there are, but how inhabited, by whom gouerned, or what betides them that are transported to the one or other, not two of them iumpe in one tale. We that to our terror and griefe doo knowe their dotage by our sufferings, reioyce to thinke how these sillie flyes play with the fire that must burne them. But leauing them to the Laborynth of their fond curiositie, shall I tell thee in a word what Hell is? It is a place where the soules of vntemperate men, & ill liuers of al sorts, are detayned and imprisoned till the generall Resurrection, kept and possessed chiefly by spirites, who lye like Souldiours in Garison, ready to be sent about any seruice into the world, when soeuer Lucifer theyr Lieftenaunt Generall pleaseth. For the scituation of it, in respect of heauen, I can no better compare it than to Callis and Douer: for as a man standing vpon Callis Sands may see men walking on Douer Clyffes, so easely may you discerne Heauen from the farthest part of hell, and behold the melodie and motions of the Angels and Spirites there resident, in such perfect manner, as if you were amongst them; which how it worketh in the mindes and soules of them that haue no power to apprehend such felicitie, it is not for me to intimate, because it is preiudiciall to our Monarchie. I would bee sorrie (quoth I) to importune you in anie matter of secrecie: yet this I desire, if it might bee done without offence, that you would satisfie me in full sort and according to truth, what the Diuell is whom you serue? as also how he began, and how farre his power and authoritie extends? Persie beleeue me thou shryuest me verie neere in this latter demaund which concerneth vs more deeply than the former, and may worke vs more damage than thou art aware of: yet in hope thou wilt conceale what I tell thee, I wil lay open our whole estate plainly and simply vnto thee as it is: but first I will begin with the opinions of former times, & so hasten forward to that manifeste verum that thou seekest. Some men ther be that building to much vpon reason, perswade themselues, that there are no Diuells at all, but that this word D aemon is such another morall of mischiefe, as the Poets Dame Fortune is of mishap: for as vnder the fiction of this blinde Goddesse we ayme at the folly of Princes and great men in disposing of honors, that oftentimes preferre fooles and disgrace wise men, and alter their fauors in turning of an eye, as Fortune turnes her wheele; so vnder the person of this olde Gnathonicall companion called the Diuell, we shrowd all subtiltie masking vnder the name of simplicitie, all painted holines deuouring widowes houses, all gray headed foxes clad in sheepes garments; so that the Diuell (as they make it) is onely a pestilent humour in a man, of pleasure, profit, or policie, that violently carries him away to vanitie, villanie, or monstrous hypocrisie: vnder vanitie I comprehend not onely all vaine Arts and studies whatsoeuer, but also dishonorable prodigality, vntemperate venerie, and that hateful sinne of selfe-loue, which is so common among vs: vnder villany I comprehend murder, treason, theft, cousnage, cut-throat couetise, and such like: lastly, vnder hypocrisie, al Machiauilisme, puritanisme, & outward gloating with a mans enemie, and protesting friendship to him that I hate, and meane to harme, all vnder-hand cloaking of bad actions with Common-wealth pretences; and finally all Italionate conueyances, as to kill a man, and then mourne for him, quasi vero it was not by my consent, to be a slaue to him that hath iniur'd me, and kisse his feete for opportunitie of reuenge, to be seuere in punishing offenders, that none might haue the benefite of such meanes but my selfe, to vse men for my purpose  & then cast them off, to seeke his destruction that knowes my secrets: and such as I haue imployed in any murther or stratagem, to set them priuily together by the eares, to stab each other mutually, for fear of bewraying me; or if that faile, to hire them to humor one another in such courses, as may bring them both to the gallowes. These and a thousand more such fleights hath hypocrisie learned by trauailing strange Countries. I will not say she puts them in practise here in England, although there be as many false brethren  & crafty knaues here amongst vs as in any place: witnes the poore Miller of Cambridge, that hauing no roome for his hen-loft, but the Testor of his bed, and it was not possible for anie hungrie Poultrers to come there, but they must stand vpon the one side of it, and so not steale them but with great hazard; had in one night notwithstanding (when hee and his wife were a snorting) all the whole progenie of their Pullerie taken away, and neyther of them heard anie sturring: it is an odde tricke, but what of that, we must not stand vpon it, for wee haue grauer matters in hand, than the stealing of Hennes. Hypocrisie I remember was our Text, which was one of the chiefe morrall Diuels our late Doctours affirme to be most busie in these dayes, and busie it is in truth more than anye Bee that I know: now you talke of a Bee, Ile tell you a tale of a Battle-dore. The Beare on a time beeing chiefe Burgomaster of all the Beastes vnder the Lyon gan thinke with himselfe how hee might surfet in pleasure, or best husband his Authoritie to enlardge his delight and contentment. With that hee beganne to prye and to smell thorough euerie corner of the Forrest for praye, to haue a thousand imaginations with himselfe what daynetie morsell he was master of, and yet had not tasted: whole heards of sheepe had he deuoured, and was not satisfied; fat oxen, heyfers, swine, calues, and yong kiddes, were his ordinarie vyands: he longed for horse flesh, and went presently to a medowe, where a fat Cammell was grazing, whom fearing to encounter with force, because he was a huge beast and well shod, he thought to betray vnder the colour of demaunding homage, hoping that as he should stoop to doo him truage, he might seaze vpon his throate and stifle him, before he should be able to recouer himselfe from his false embrace: but therin hee was deceiued; for comming vnto this stately Beast with this imperious message, in stead of dooing homage vnto him, he lifted vp one of his hindmost heeles, and stroake him such a blowe on the forhead that he ouer-threwe him. Thereat not a little moou'd and enrag'd that he should be so dishonored by his inferiour as he thought, he consulted with the Ape how he might be reuenged. The Ape abhorring him by nature, because he ouer-lookt him so Lordly, and was by so manie degrees greater than he was, aduised him to dig a pit with his pawes right in the way where this big boand Gentleman should passe, that so stumbling and falling in, he might lightly skip on his backe, and bridle him, and then hee come and seaze on him at his pleasure. No sooner was this perswaded, than performed: for enuy that is neuer idle could not sleep in his wrath, or ouer-slip the least opportunitie, till he had seene the confusion of his enemie. Alas goodly Creature, that thou mightst no longer liue. What auaileth thy gentlenes, thy prowesse, or the plentifull pasture, wherein thou wert fed; since malice triumphs ouer al thou commandest? Well may the Mule rise vp in armes, and the Asse bray at the Authors of thy death: yet shall their furie be fatall to themselues, before it take holde on these Traitours. What needeth more words? the deuourer feedes on his captiue, and is gorged with bloud. But as auarice and crueltie are euermore thirstie, so far'd it with this hungrie Usurper: for, hauing flesht his ambition with this treacherous conquest, he past along through a groue, where a Heard of Deare were a ranging; whom when he had stedfastly surueyed from the fattest to the leanest, hee singled out one of the fairest of the company, with whom he meant to close vp his stomacke in steed of cheese: but because the Wood-men were euer stirring there-about, and it was not possible for one of his coate to commit such outrage vndescried, and that if he were espied, his life were in perill; though not with the Lion, whose eyes he could blinde as he list, yet with the lesser sort of the brutish Comminaltie, whom no flattry might pacifie. Therefore he determined slylie and priuely to poyson the streame, where this iolly Forester wonted to drink;  & as he determined, so he did: whereby it fell out, that when the Sunne was ascended to his height, & all the nimble Citizens of the Wood betooke them to their Laire, this youthfull Lord of the Lawnds, all faint and malcontent (as prophecying his neere approaching mishap by his languishing) with a lazie wallowing pace, strayed aside from the rest of his fellowship, and betooke him all carelesly to the corrupted fountaine that was prepared for his Funerall. Ah, woe is mee, this poyson is pitiles. What need I say more, since you know it is death with whom it encounters. And yet cannot all this expence of life, set a period to insatiable Murther: but still it hath some anuyle to worke vpon, and ouer-casts all opposite prosperitie, that may anie way shadow his glorie. Too long it were to reherse all the practises of this sauadge blood- hunter, how he assailed the Unicorne as he slept in his den, and tore the hart out of his breast ere he could awake: how he made the lesser beasts lie in wayt one for the other, and the Crocodyle to coape with the Basiliske, that when they had enterchaungeably weakned each other, hee might come and insult ouer them both as he list. But these were lesser matters, which daily vse had worne out of mens mouths, and he himself had so customably practised, that often exercise had quite abrogated the opinion of sinne, & impudence throughly confirmd an vndaunted defiance of vertue in his face. Yet newfangled lust, that in time is wearie of welfare, & will bee as soone cloyed with too much ease and delicacie, as Pouertie with labour and scarcitie, at length brought him out of loue with this greedie bestiall humour: and now he affected a milder varietie in his diet: he had bethought him what a pleasaunt thing it was to eate nothing but honnie another while, and what great store of it there was in that Countrey. Now did he cast in his head that if hee might bring the husbandmen of the soyle in opinion, that they might buy honey cheaper than being at such charges in keeping of Bees, or that those bees which they kept were most of the drones, & what should such idle Drones doo with such stately hyues, or lye sucking at such precious honni-combes; that if they were took away from them, and distributed equally abroad, they would releeue a great manie of painfull labourers that had need of them, and would continually liue seruiceable at their commaund, if they might enioy such a benefite. Nay more, let them giue Waspes but onely the wax, and dispose of the honnie as they thinke good, and they shal humme and buzze a thousand times lowder than they, and haue the hiue fuller at the yeres end (with yong ones I meane) than the Bees are wont in ten yere. To broach this deuice, the Foxe was addrest like a shepheards dogge, and promist to haue his Pattent seald, to bee the Kings Poulterer for euer, if hee could bring it to passe. Faith quoth he, and Ile put it in a venter, let it hap how it will. With that he grew in league with an old Camelion, that could put on all shapes, and imitate anie colour, as occasion serued; and him he addrest sometime like an Ape to make sport, & then like a Crocodile to weepe, sometime lyke a Serpent to sting, and by and by like a Spaniel to fawne; that with these sundrie formes, (applyde to mens variable humors) he might perswade the world he ment as he spake, and only intended their good, when he thought nothing lesse. In this disguise, these two deceiuers went vp & downe, and did much harme vnder the habite of Simplicitie, making the poore silly Swaines beleeue they were cunning Phisitions, and well seene in all Cures, that they could heale anye malady, though neuer so daungerous, & restore a man to life that had been dead two dayes, only by breathing vpon him: aboue all things they perswaded them, that the honny that their Bees brought foorth, was poysonous and corrupt, by reason that those floures and hearbs out of which it was gathered and exhaled, were subiect to the infection of euerye Spider and venimous Canker, and not a loathsome Toade (how detestable soeuer) but reposde himselfe vnder theyr shadow, and lay sucking at their rootes continually: wheras in other Countries, no noisome or poisnous creature might liue, by reason of the imputed goodnes of the Soyle, or carefull diligence of the Gardners aboue ours, as for example, Scotland, Denmarke, & some more pure parts of the 17. Prouinces. These perswasions made the good honest Husbandmen to pause, and mistrust their owne wits verie much, in nourishing such dangerous Animals, but ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Interdum vulgus rectum videt, et vbi peccat. ] yet I know not how antiquitie and custome so ouer-rulde their feare, that none would resolue to abandon them on the sodaine, til they saw a further inconuenience: whereby my two cunning Philosophers were driuen to studie Galen anew, and seeke out splenatiue simples, to purge their popular Patients of the opinion of their olde Traditions and Customes: which how they wrought with the most part that had least wit, it were a world to tell. For now nothing was Canonical but what they spake, no man would conuerse with his wife, but first askt their aduise, nor pare his nayles, nor cut his beard, without their prescription: so senseles, so wauering is the light vnconstaunt Multitude, that will daunce after euerye mans pype; & sooner prefer a blinde harper that can squeake out a new horne-pipe, than Alcinous or Apolloes varietie, that imitates the right straines of the Doryan melodie. I speak this to amplify the nouel folly of the headlong vulgar, that making their eyes and eares vassailes to the legerdemaine of these iugling Mountebanks, are presently drawne to contemne Art and experience in comparison of the ignorance of a number of audacious ideots. The Fox can tell a faire tale and couers all his knauerie vnder conscience, and the Camelion can addresse himselfe like an Angell whensoeuer he is disposed to worke mischief by myracles, but yet in the end their secret driftes are laide open, and Linceus eyes that see through stone walls, haue made a passage into the close couerture of their hypocrisie. For one daye, as these two Deuisers were plotting by themselues how to driue all the Bees from their Honnicombes, by putting wormwood in their Hyues, and strewing Henbane and Rue in euerie place where they resort, a Flye that past by, and heard all their talke, stomacking the Foxe of olde, for that he had murthred so manie of his kindred with his flayle-driuing taile, went presently and buzd in Linceus eares the whole purport of their malice, who awaking his hundred eyes at these vnexpected tidings, gan pursue them whersoeuer they went, and trace their intents as they proceeded into action, so that ere halfe their baytes were cast foorth, they were apprehended and imprisoned, and all their whole counsaile detected. But long ere this, the Beare impatient of delayes, and consumd with an inward greefe in himselfe, that hee might not haue his will of a fat Hinde that out- ran him, he went into the woods all melancholy, and there dyed for pure anger: leauing the Foxe and the Camelion to the destinie of their desert, and mercie of their Iudges. How they scapte I know not, but some saye they were hangd, and so weele leaue them. How lik'st thou of my tale friend Persie ? Haue I not described a right earthly Diuell vnto thee, in the discourse of this bloodie minded Beare? Or canst thou not attract the true image of Hypocrisie, vnder the description of the Foxe and the Camelion. Yes verie wel (quoth I) but I would gladly haue you returne to your first subiect, since you haue mooued doubts in my minde, which you haue not yet discust. Of the sundrie opinions of the Diuel thou meanest, and them that imagine him to haue no existence, of which sort are they that first inuented the Prouerbe, Homo homini D aemon: meaning thereby, that that power which we call the Diuell, and the ministring Spirites belonging to his Kingdome, are tales and fables, and meere bugge-beares to scare boyes: and that there is no such essence at all, but onely it is a terme of large content, describing the rancor, grudge, & bad dealing of one man towards another; as namely, when one friend talkes with another subtilly, and seekes to dyue into his commoditie, that hee may depriue him of it craftily: when the sonne seeks the death of the father, that he may be infeoffed in his wealth: & the stepdame goes about to make away her sonne in-law, that her children may inherit: whe brothers fall at iarres for portions, & shall by open murther or priuy conspiracie, attempt the confusion of each other, only to ioyne house to house, and vnite two Liuelihoods in one: when the seruant shal rob his Master, and men put in trust start away from their oathes and vowes they care not how. In such cases & many more, may one man be said to bee a deuill to an other, & this is the second opinion. The third is that of Plato, who not only affirmeth that there are diuells, but deuided them into three sorts, euery one a degree of dignity aboue the other; the first are those, whose bodies are copact of ye purest ayerie Element, combined with such transparant threds, that neither they doo partake so much fier as should make them visible to sight, or haue any such affinitie with the earth, as they are able to be prest or toucht: & these he setteth in the highest incomprehensible degree of heauen. The second, he maketh these whom Apuleius dooth call reasonable Creatures, passiue in minde and eternall in Time, being those Apostata spirites that rebelled with Belzebub: whose bodies, before their fall, were bright and pure all like to the former; but after their transgression, they were obscured with a thicke fiery matter, and euer after assigned to darknes. The third, he attributes to those men, that by som diuine knowledge or vnderstanding, seeming to aspyre aboue mortallitie, are called D aemona, (that is) Gods: for this word D aemon contayneth eyther, and Homer in euery place dooth vse it, both for that omnipotent power that was before all things, & the euill spirite that leadeth men to error: so dooth Syrianus testifie, that Plato was called D aemon, because he disputed of deepe Common wealth matters, greatly auaylable to the benefit of his Countrey: and Aristotle , because he wrot at large of all things subiect to mouing and sence. Then belike (quoth I) you make this word D aemon, a capable name of Gods, of men and of deuills, which is farre distant from the scoape of my demand: for I doo only enquire of the Diuell, as this common appellation of the Diuel, signifieth a malignant spirit, enemie to mankinde, and a hater of God and all goodnes. Those are the second kinde said he, vsualy termed detracters or accusers that are in knowledge infinite insomuch as by the quicknes of their wits & agreeable mixtures of the Elements, they so comprehend those seminarie vertues to men vnknown, that those things which in course of time, or by growing degrees Nature of it selfe can effect. They by their Art and skil in hastning the works of Nature, can contriue and compasse in a moment, as the Magitians of Pharao, who whereas Nature not without some interposition of time, and ordinarie causes of conception brings forth frogs, serpents, or any liuing thing els, they without all such distance of space, or circumscription of season euen in a thought assoone as their King commanded, couered the Land of Egipt with this monstrous encrease. Of the originall of vs spirites, the Scripture most amply maketh mention, namely that Lucifer (before his fall) an Archangel, was a cleere bodie compact of the purest, and brightest of the ayre, but after his fall, hee was vayled with a groser substance, and tooke a new forme of darke and thicke ayre, which he still reteineth. Neither did he onely fall, when hee stroue with Michael , but drewe a number of Angels to his faction; who ioynt partakers of his proud reuolt, were likewise partakers of his punishment, and all thrust out of heauen together by one iudgement: who euer since doo nothing but wander about the Earth, and tempt and enforce frayle men to enterprise all wickednes that may bee, and commit most horrible and abhominable things against God. Meruaile not that I discouer so much of our estate vnto thee: for the Scripture hath more than I mention, as S. Peter where he saith that God spared not his Angels that sinned: and in an other place wher he saith that they are bound with the chains of darknes, and throwen headlong into hell: which is not meant of any locall place in the earth, or vnder the waters: for as Austin affirmeth, wee doo inhabite the Region vnder the Moone, and haue the thick aire assigned vs as a prison, from whence we may with small labour cast our nets where wee list: yet are we not so at our disposition, but that we are still commanded by Lucifer (although we are in number infinit) who retaining that pride wherewith he arrogantly affected the Maiestie of God, hath still his ministring Angels about him, whom he employes in seuerall charges, to seduce  & deceiue as him seemeth best: as those spirits which the Latins call Iouios and Antemeridianos, to speake out of Oracles, and make the people worship them as Gods, when they are nothing but deluding Diuels that couet to haue a false Deitie, ascribed vnto them,  & draw men vnto their loue by wonders and prodegies, that els wold hate them deadly, if they knew their maleuolence and enuie. Such a monarchizing spirit it was, that said vnto Christ, If thou wilt fall downe, and worship me, I will giue thee all the Kingdomes of the earth: and such a spirit it was that possest the Libian Sapho, and the Emprour Dioclesian, who thought it the blessedst thing that might be, to be called God. For the one being wearie of humane honor,  & inspired with a supernaturall folly, taught little birds that were capable of speach, to pronounce distinctly Magnus Deus Sapho, that is to say A great God is Sapho : Which words when they had learned readely to carroll, and were perfect in their note, he let them flie at randome, that so dispersing themselues euery where, they might induce the people to account of him as a God. The other was so arrogant, that he made his subiects fal prostrate on their faces, and lifting vp their hands to him as to heauen, adore him as omnipotent. The second kind of Diuels which he most imployeth, are those Northerne Marcii, called the spirits of reuenge,  & the authors of massacres, & seedsmen of mischiefe, for they haue commission to incense men to rapines, sacriledge, theft murther, wrath, furie, and all manner of cruelties, & they commaund certaine of the Southern spirits (as slaues) to wait vpon them, as also great Arioch, that is tearmed, the spirite of reuenge. These know how to dissociate the loue of brethren, and to break wedlock bands with such violence, that they may not be vnited, & are predominant in many other domestical mutinies: of whom if you list to heare more, read the 39. of Ecclesiasticus . The prophet Esay maketh mention of another Spirit sent by God to the Egiptians, to make them stray and wander out of the way, that is to say, the Spirite of lying, which they call Bolychym . The spirits that entice men to gluttony, & lust are certaine watry spirits of the West, and certaine Southern spirits as Nefrach and Kelen , which for the most part prosecute vnlawfull loues, and cherish all vnnaturall desires: they wander through lakes, fish-ponds and fennes, and ouerwhelm ships, cast boates vpon ankers and drowne men that are swimming; therefore are they counted the most pestilent, troublesome and guilefull spirits that are: for by the helpe of Alynach a spirit of the West, they will raise stormes, cause earthquakes, whirlwindes, rayne, haile or snow in the cleerest day that is: and if euer they appeare to anie man, they come in womens apparell. The spirits of the aire will mixe themselues with thunder & lightening, and so infect the Clyme where they raise any tempest, that sodainly great mortalitie shal ensue to the inhabitants, from the infectious vapors which arise from their motions: of such S. Iohn maketh mention in the ninth of the Apocalips; their patrone is Mereris, who beareth chief rule about the middle time of the day. The spirits of the fire haue their mansions vnder the regions of the Moone, that whatsoeuer is committed to their charge, they may there execute, as in their proper consistorie, from whence they cannot start. The spirits of the Earth keepe for the most part in Forrests and woods, and doo hunters much noyance, and sometime in the broad fields where they lead trauelers out of the right way, or fright men with deformed apparitions, or make them run mad through excessiue melancholy like Aiax Telamonius, & so proue hurtfull to themselues, & daungerous to others: of this number the chiefe are Samaab and Achymael spirits of the East, that haue no power to doo any great harm, by reason of the vnconstancie of their affections. The vnder-earth spirits, are such as lurk in dens & litle cauernes of the earth, and hollow creuises of mountaines, that they may dyue into the bowels of the earth at their pleasures: these dig metals, and watch treasures, which they continually transport from place to place, that non should haue vse of them: they raise windes that vomit flames, & shake the foundation of buildins, they daunce in rounds in pleasant Lawnds, and greene medowes, with noises of musick and minstralsy, and vanish away when any comes nere them; they will take vpon the any similitude but of a woman, and terrefie men in the likenes of dead mens ghosts in the night time: and of this qualitie & condition the Nigromancers hold Gaziel, Fegor , and Anarazel, Southerne spirits, to be. Besides, there are yet remaining certaine lying spirits (who, although all be giuen to lye by nature) yet are they more prone to that vice, than the rest, being named Pythonists, of whom Apollo comes to be called Pythaeus : they haue a prince aswel as other spirits of whom mention is made in the 3. book of Kings, when hee saith he will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all Ahabs prophets: from which those spirites of iniquitie doo little differ, which are called the vessels of wrath, that assist Belial (who they interpret a spirite without yoake or controuler) in all damnable deuises and inuentions. Plato reports them to be such as first deuised Cardes and dice, and I am in the mind, that the Monke was of the same order, that found out the vse of Gunpouder, and the engines of warre therto belonging. Those that writ of these matters, call this Beliall Chodar of the East, that hath all witches and coniurers spirits vnder his iurisdiction, & giues them leaue to helpe Iuglers in their tricks, & Simon Magus to doo miracles; alwaies prouided they bring a soule home to their Master for his hyre. Yet are not these all, for there are spirits called spies & tale-cariers, obedient to Ascaroth , whom the Greekes call Daimona , & S. Iohn, The accuser of the brethren: also tempters, who for their interrupting vs in al our good actions, are cald our euill Angells. Aboue all things they hate the light, and reioyce in darknes, disquieting men maliciously in the night,  & sometimes hurt them by pinching them or blasting them as they sleepe: but they are not so much to be dreaded as other spirites, because if a man speak to them, they flee away and will not abide. Such a spirit Plinius Secundus telleth of, that vsed to haunt a goodly house in Athens that Athenodorus hired; and such another Suetonius describeth to haue long houered in Lamianus garden where Caligula lay buried, who for because hee was onely couered with a fewe clods, and vnreuerently throwne amongst the weedes, hee meruailously disturbed the owners of the garden,  & would not let them rest in their beds, till by his Sisters returned from banishment, he was taken vp, & entoombed solemnly. Pausanias auououcheth (amongst other experiments) that a certaine spirit called Zazilus doth feed vpon dead mens corses, that are not deeply enterred in the earth as they ought: which to confirme, there is a wonderfull accident set downe in the Danish historie of Asuitus and Asmundus, who being two famous frends (well knowen in those parts) vowd one to another, that which of them two outliued the other, shuld be buried aliue with his frend that first died. In short space Asuitus fell sicke and yeelded to nature, Asmundus compelled by the oath of his friendship, took none but his horse and his dog with him, and transported the dead bodie into a vast caue vnder the earth, and ther determined hauing victualed himselfe for a long time) to finish his dayes in darknes, and neuer depart from him that he loued so dearlie. Thus shut vp, and enclosed in the bowels of the earth, it hapned Eritus King of Sweueland to passe that way with his Armie not ful two moneths after, who comming to the toombe of Asuitus , and suspecting it a place where treasure was hidden, caused his Pioners with their spades and mattockes to dig it vp: whereupon was discouered the loathsome body of Asmundus , al to besmeaxed with dead mens filth,  & his visage most vgly and fearfull; which imbrued with congeald bloud, and eaten and torne like a raw vlcer, made him so gastly to behold, that all the lookers on were afrighted. Hee seeing himselfe restored to light, and so many amazed men stand about him, resolued their vncertaine perplexitie in these tearmes. Why stand ye astonisht at my vnvsuall deformities? when no liuing man conuerseth with the dead, but is thus disfigured. But other causes haue effected this alteration in me: for I know not what audacious spirit sent by Gorgon from the deep, hath not only most rauenously deuoured my horse and my dog, but also hath laid his hungrie pawes vpon mee, and tearing downe my cheekes as you see, hath likewise rent away one of mine eares. Hence is it that my mangled shape seemes so monstrous, and my humane image obscured with gore in this wise. Yet scaped not this fell Harpie from mee vnreuengd: for as he assaild me, I raught his head from his shoulders, and sheathd my sword in his body. Haue spirits their visible bodies said I, that may be toucht, wounded, or pierst? Beleeue me, I neuer heard that in my life before this. Why quoth he, although in their proper essence they are creatures incorporal, yet can they take vpon the the induments of any liuing body whatsoeuer, and transforme themselues into all kinde of shapes, whereby they may more easily deceiue our shallow wits and senses. So testifies Basilius that they can put on a materiall forme when they list. Socrates affirmeth that his Daemon did oftentimes talke with him, & that he saw him & felt him many times. But Marcus Cherronesius (a wonderfull discouerer of Diuels) writeth, that those bodies which they assume, are distinguisht by no difference of sex, because they are simple, and the discernaunce of sex belongs to bodies compound: yet are they flexible, motiue, and apt for any configuration, but not al of them alike; for the spirits of the Fire and Aire haue this power aboue the rest. The spirits of the water haue slow bodies resembling birds and women, of which kinde the Naiades & Nereides are much celebrated amongst Poets. Neuertheles, how euer they are restrayned to their seuerall similitudes, it is certaine that all of them desire no forme or figure so much, as the likenesse of a man, & doo thinke themselues in heauen, when they are infeoft in that hue: wherfore I know no other reason but this, that man is the neerest representatio to God, in so much as the Scripture saith, He made man after his own likenesse and Image: and they affecting by reason of their pride, to bee as like God as they may, contend most seriously to shroud themselues vnder that habit. But I pray tell mee this, whether are there (as Porphirius holdeth) good spirites as well as euill. Nay certainly (quoth he) we are al euill, let Porphirius, Proclus, Apuleius, or the Platonists dispute to the contrary as long as they will which I will confirme to thy capacity by the names that are euerie where giuen vs in the Scripture, for the deuill which is the Summum genus to vs all, is called Diabolus quasi deorsum ruens, that is to say, falling downward, as he that aspyring too high, was thrown from the top of felicitie to the lowest pit of despayre and sathan, that is to say, an Aduersary, who for the corruption of his malyce, opposeth himselfe euer against God, who is the chiefest good. In Iob, Behemoth and Leuiathan, and in the 9. of the Apocalips, Apolion, that is to say a Subuerter: because the foundation of those vertues, which our high Maker hath planted in our soules, hee vndermineth and subuerteth. A Serpent for his poysoning, a Lyon for his deuouring: a Furnace, for that by his malyce the Elect are tryed, who are vessels of wrath and saluation. In Esay , a Syren, a Lamia, a Scrich-oule, an Estridge. In the Psalmes, an Adder, a Basiliske, a Dragon. And lastlie, in the Gospel, Mammon, Prince of this world, and the Gouernour of darknes: so that by the whole course of condemning names that are gyuen vs, and no one instance of any fauorable tytle bestowed vppon vs, I positiuely set downe that all spirits are euill. Now, whereas the Diuines attribute vnto vs these good and euill spirits, the good to guide vs from euill,  & the euil to draw vs from goodnesse, they are not called spirites but Angells, of which sort was Raphaell , the good Angell of Tobias, who exilde the euill spirite Asmodius into the desart of Ægipt , that he might bee the more secure from his temptation. Since we haue entred thus far into the deuills common-wealth, I beseech you certefie me thus much, whether haue they power to hurt granted them from God, or fro themselues; can they hurt as much as they will. Not so quoth hee, for although that diuells be most mightie spirits, yet can they not hurt but permissiuely, or by some speciall dispensation: as when a man is falne into the state of an out-law, the Lawe dispenseth with them that kils him, & the Prince excludes him from the protection of a subiect; so, when a man is a relaps from God and his Lawes, God withdrawes his prouidence from watching ouer him, & authorizeth the deuil as his instrument, to assault him and torment him, so that what soeuer he dooth, is Limitata potestate, as one saith: insomuch as a haire cannot fall from our heads, without the will of our heauenly Father. The diuell could not deceiue Achabs Prophetes till he was licensed by God, nor exercise his tyrannie ouer Iob til he had giuen him commission, nor enter into the heard of swine til Christ bad them goe. Therefore need you not feare the diuell any whit as long as you are in the fauour of God, who raineth him so straight, that except he let him loose he can doo nothing. This manlike proportion which I now retaine, is but a thing of suffrance granted vnto me to plague such men as hunt after strife, and are delighted with variance. It may bee so verie well, but whether haue you that skill to foretell things to come, that is ascribed vnto you? We haue (quoth he) somtimes, not that we are priuy to the eternall counsel of God, but for that by the sense of our ayrie bodies we haue a more refined faculty of foreseing, than men possibly can haue, that are chained to such heauie earthly moulder; or els for that by the incomparable pernicitie of those ayrie bodies, we not onely out-strip the swiftnes of men, beasts and birds wherby we may be able to attain to the knowledge of things sooner, than those that by the dulnes of their earthly sense come a great way behinde vs. Herevnto may we adioin our long experience in the course of things from the beginning of the world, which men want and therfore cannot haue that deep coniecture that we haue. Nor is our knowledge any more than coniecture: for prescience only belongeth to God,  & that gesse that we haue, proceedeth from the compared disposition of heauenly & earthly bodies, by whose long obserued temperature, we doo diuine manie times, as it happens, & therefore doo we take vpon vs to prophecy, that we may purchase estimation to our names, & bring men in admiration with that we doo, and so be counted for Gods. The myracles wee work, are partly contriued by illusion, and partly assisted by that supernaturall skill we haue in the experience of nature aboue al other creatures. But against these illusions of your subtiltie and vaine terrors you inflict, what is our chiefe refuge? I shalbe accounted a foolish Diuel anone, if I bewray the secrets of our Kingdome, as I haue begun: yet speak I no more than learned Clarkes haue written, and asmuch as they haue set downe will I shew thee. Origen in his Treatise against Celsus saith, there is nothing better for him that is vexed with spirits, than the naming of Iesu, the true God; for he auoucheth, he hath seen diuers driuen out of mens bodies by that meanes. Athanasius in his booke De variis questionibus saith, The presentest remedie against the inuasion of euill spirits, is the beginning of the 67. Psalme, Exurgat Deus, & dissipentur inimici eius . Cyprian cousailes men to adiure spirits onely by the name of the true God Some hold that fire is a preseruatiue for this purpose, because when any spirit appeareth, the lights by little and little, goe out as it were of their owne accord, and the tapers are by degrees extinguisht. Others by inuocating vpon God, by the name of Vehiculum ignis superioris, and often rehearsing the Articles of our faith. A third sort are perswaded that the brandishing of swords is good for this purpose, because Homer faineth, that Vlisses sacrificing to his mother, wafted his sword in the aire to chase the spirits fro the bloud of the sacrifice. And Sibilla conducting  Æneas to hell begins her charmes in this sort.  Procul, O procul, este prophani: Tuque iuvande viam, vaginaque eripe ferrum. Philostratus reporteth that he and his companions meeting that diuel which artists entitle Apolonius as they came one night from banquetting, with such termes as he is curst in holy writ, they made him run away howling. Manie in this case extoll perfume of Calamentum p aeonia, Menta palma Christi, and Appius . A number prefer the carying of red Corrall about them, or of Arthemisia hypericon, Ruta verbena: & to this effect manie doo vse the iyngling of keyes, the sound of the harp, and the clashing of armor. Some of old time put great superstition in characters, curiously engraued in theyr Pentagonon, but they are all vaine, & wil doo no good, if they be otherwise vsed than as signes of couenaunt betweene the diuell and them. Nor doo I affirme all the rest to be vnfallible prescriptions, though sometime they haue their vse: but that the onely assured way to resist their attempts is prayer and faith, gainst which all the diuells in hell cannot preuaile. Inough gentle spirit I wil importune thee no farther, but commit this Supplication to thy care: which if thou deliuer accordingly, thou shalt at thy returne haue more of my custome: for by that time I wil haue finished certain letters to diuers Orators and Poets, dispersed in your dominions. Thats as occasion shal serue, but now I must take leaue of you, for it is Terme time, and I haue some busines. A Gentleman (a frend of mine that I neuer saw before) stayes for me, and is like to be vndone if I come not in to beare witnes on his side: wherefore Bazilez manus, till our next meeting. Gentle Reader tandem aliquando, I am at leasure to talke to thee. I dare say, thou hast cald me a hundred times dolt for this senseles discourse: it is no matter, thou dost but as I haue done by a number in my dayes. For who can abide a scuruie pedling Poet to plucke a man by the sleeue at euerie third step in Paules Churchyard, and when hee comes in to suruey his wares, theres nothing but purgations and vomits wrapt vp in wast paper. It were verie good the dog-whipper in Paules would haue a care of this in his vnsauerie visitation euerie Saterday: for it is dangerous for such of the Queenes liedge people, as shall take a viewe of them fasting. Looke to it it you Bookesellers  & Stationers, and let not your shops bee infected with any such goose gyblets or stinking garbadge, as the Iygs of newsmongers, and especially such of you as frequent Westminster hall, let the be circumspect what dunghill papers they bring thether: for one bad pamphlet is inough to raise a dampe that may poyson a whole Terme, or at the least a number of poore Clyents that haue no money to preuent il aire by breaking their fasts ere they come thether. Not a base Iack-dropper or scuruie plodder at Nouerint, but vailes his asses eares on euery poast  & comes off with long Circumquaque to the Gentlemen Readers, yea the most excrementarie dislikers of learning are growne so valiant in impudence, that now they set vp their faces (like Turks) of gray paper to be spet at for siluer games in Finsburie fields. Whilst I am thus talking, me thinkes I heare one say, What a fop is this he entitles his Booke A Supplication to the Diuell ,  & doth nothing but raile on ideots, and tells a storie of the nature of spirits. Haue patience good sir, and weele come to you by and by. Is it my Title you finde fault with? Why, haue you not seene a Towne surnamed by the principall house in the Towne, or a Noble man deriue his Baronrie from a little village where he hath least land? So fareth it by me in christening of my booke. But some will obiect, where too tends this discouerie of diuels, or how is it induc'd? For sooth, if thou wilt needs know my reson, this it is. I bring Pierce Penilesse to question with the diuel, as a yong nouice would talke with a great trauailer: who carying an Englishmans appetite to enquire of news, will be sure to make what vse of him he may, and not leaue any thing vnaskt, that he can resolue him of. If then the diuell be tedious in discoursing, impute it to Pierce Penilesse , that was importunate in demanding: or if I haue not made him so secret or subtill in his art, as diuels are wont, let that of Lactantius be mine excuse lib. 2. cap. 16. de Origenis errore, wher he saith, the diuels haue no power to lie to a iust man: and if they adiure them by the maiesty of the high God, they will not onely confesse themselues to be Diuels, but also tell their names as they are. Deus bone, what a vaine am I fallen into? what, an Epistle to the Readers in the end of thy booke? Out vpon thee for an arrant blocke, where learndst thou that wit? O sir, hold your peace: a fellon neuer comes to his answere before the offence be committed. Wherefore if I in the beginning of my Book should haue come off with a long Apologie to excuse my selfe, it were all one, as if a theefe going to steale a horse, should deuise by the way as he went, what to speake when he came at the gallowes. Here is a crosse way, and I thinke it good heere to part. Farwell farewell, good Parenthesis, and commend me to Ladie Uanitie thy mistres. Now Pierce Peniles if for a parting blow thou hast ere a tricke in thy budget more than ordinarie bee not daintie of it, for a good Patron will pay for all. I where is he? Promissis quilibet diues esse potest . But cap and thanks is all our Courtiers payment: wherefore I would counsell my frends to be more considerate in their Dedications, and not cast away so many months labour vppon a clowne that knowes not how to vse a Scholler: for what reason haue I to bestow any of my wit vpon him, that will bestow none of his wealth vpon me. Alas, it is an easie matter for a goodlie tall fellowe that shines in his silkes, to come and out-face a poore simple Pedant in a thred bare cloake, and tell him his Booke is prety, but at this time he is not prouided for him: marrie about two or three daies hence if he come that way, his Page shal say he is not within, or els he is so busie with my L. How-call-ye-him, and my L. What-call-ye-him, that he may not be spoken withall. These are the common courses of the world, which euery man priuately murmures at, but none dares openly vpbraid, because the most Artists are base minded: like the Indians, that haue store of gold  & precious stones at commaund, yet are ignorant of their value, and therefore let the Spaniards, the English-men, & euerye one load their ships with them without molestation, so they enioying and possessing the puritie of knowledge (a treasure farre richer than the Indian Mynes) let euerie proud Thraso be pertaker of their perfections, repaying them no profit; and gyld himself with the titles they giue him, when he wil scarce return them a good word for their labor: giue an Ape but a nut, and he wil looke your head for it; or a Dog a bone, and hele wag his tayle: but giue me one of my young Masters a booke, and he will put off his hat and blush, and so go his way: yes, now I remember me I lye, for I know him that had thankes for three yeares worke, and a Gentleman that bestowed much cost in refining of musicke, & had scarse Fidlers wages for his labor. We want an Aretine here among vs, that might strip these golden asses out of their gay trappings, and after he had ridden them to death with rayling, leaue them on the dunghil for carion. But I will write to his ghost by my carrier, & I hope hele repaire his whip, & vse it against our English Peacockes, that painting themselues with Church spoyles, like mightie mens sepulchers, haue nothing but Atheisme, schisme, hypocrisie, and vainglorie, like rotten bones lurking within them. O how my soule abhors these buckram giants, that hauing an outward face of honor set vpon them by flatterers & parasites, haue theyr inward thoughts, stuft with straw and fethers, if they were narrowly sifted. Farre bee it bright starres of Nobilitie, and glistring Attendaunts on the true Diana , that this my speach should be anie way iniurious to your glorious magnificence: for in you liue those sparkes of Augustus liberalitie, that neuer sent any way emptie: and Science seauenfold throne welnigh ruined by ryot and auarice, is mightely supported by your plentifull largesse, which makes Poets to sing such goodly Hymnes of your praise, as no enuious posteritie may forget. But from generall fame, let me digres to my priuate experience, and with a tongue vnworthie to name a name of such worthines, affectionately emblazon to the eyes of wonder, the matchles Image of Honor, & magnificent rewarder of vertue, Ioues Eagle- borne Ganimede, thrice noble Amintas . In whose high spirit, such a Deitie of wisdome appeareth, that if Homer were to write his Odyssea new (where vnder the person of Vlysses, hee describeth a singular man of perfection, in whome all ornaments both of peace  & war are assembled in the height of their excelence) he need no other instance to augment his conceipt, than the rare cariage of his honorable minde. Many Writers and good wits, are giuen to commend their Patrons and Benefactors, some for prowesse, some for policy, others for the glorie of their Ancestrie and exceeding bountie and liberalitie: but if my vnable pen should euer enterprise such a continuate taske of praise, I would embowell a number of those wind-puft bladders, & disfurnish their bald pates of the periwigs Poets haue lent them, that so I might restore glorye to his right inheritance, and these stolne Titles to their true owners: which if it would so fall out, (as time may worke all things) the aspiring nettles with their shadie tops shall no longer ouer-dreep the best hearbs, or keep them from the smiling aspect of the Sunne, that liue and thriue by comfortable beames, none but Desert should sit in Fames grace, none but Hector be remembred in the chronicles of Prowesse, none but thou most courteous Amyntas bee the second musicall Argument of the Knight of the Red-crosse.  Oh decus atque aeui gloria summa tui. And here (heauenly Spencer ) I am most highly to accuse thee of forgetfulnes, that in that honourable Catalogue of our English Heroes , which insueth the conclusion of thy famous Fairie Queene, thou wouldest let so speciall a piller of Nobilitie passe vnsaluted. The verie thought of his farre deriued discent, and extraordinarie parts wherewith hee astoineth the world, and drawes all hearts to his loue, would haue inspired thy fore wearied Muse with new furie to proceede to the next triumphs of thy stately Goddesse, but as I in fauor of so rare a Scholer, suppose with this counsaile he refraind his mention in this first part, that he might with full saile proceede to his due commendations in the second. Of this occasion long since I happened to frame a Sonnet, which being wholy intended to the reuerence of this renoumed Lord, (to whom I owe all the vtmost powers of my loue and duetie) I meant here for varietie of style to insert Perusing yesternight with idle eyes, The Fairy Singers stately tuned verse: And viewing after Chap-mens wonted guise, What strange contents the tytle did rehearse. I streight leapt ouer to the latter end, Where like the queint Comaedians of our time, That when their Play is doone doe fall to ryme, I found short lynes, to sundry Nobles pend. Whom he as speciall Mirrours singled fourth, To be the Patrons of his Poetry; I read them all, and reuerenc't their worth, Yet wondred he left out thy memory. But therefore gest I he supprest thy name, Because few words might not coprise thy fame. Beare with mee gentle Poet, though I conceiue not aright of thy purpose, or be too inquisitiue into the intent of thy obliuion: for how euer my coniecture may misse the cushion, yet shall my speech sauour of friendship, though it be not allied to Iudgement. Tantum hoc molior, in this short digression, to acquaint our countrymen that lyue out of the Eccho of the Courte, with a common knowledge of his inualuable vertues, and shew my selfe thankfull (in some part) for benefits receyued: which since words may not counteruayle, that are the vsual lyp-labour of euery idle discourser, I conclude with that of Ouid .  Accipe per longos tibi qui deseruiat annos, Accipe qui pura nouit amare fide. And if my zeale and duety (though all to meane to please) may by any industry, be reformed to your gracious liking, I submit the simplicitie of my endeuours, to your seruice, which is, all my performance may profer, or my abilitie performe.  Praebeat Alcinoi poma begningnus ager, Officium pauper numeret studiumque fidemque. And so I breake off this endlesse argument of speeche, abruptly.
