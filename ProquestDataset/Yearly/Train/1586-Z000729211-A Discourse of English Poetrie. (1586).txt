VV. printed pamphlets; wherewith thys Countrey is pestered, all shoppes stuffed, and euery study furnished: the greatest part I thinke in any one kinde, are such as are either meere Poeticall, or which tende in some respecte (as either in matter or forme) to Poetry. Of such Bookes therefore, sith I haue beene one, that haue had a desire to reade not the fewest, and because it is an argument, which men of great learning haue no leysure to handle, or at the least hauing to doo with more serious matters doo least regarde. If I write something, concerning what I thinke of our English Poets, or aduenture to sette downe my simple iudgement of English Poetrie, I trust the the learned Poets will giue me leaue, and vouchsafe my Booke passage, as beeing for the rudenesse thereof no preiudice to their noble studies, but euen (as my intent is) an instar cotis to stirre vppe some other of meete abilitie, to bestowe trauell in this matter: whereby I thinke wee may not onelie get the meanes which wee yet want, to discerne betweene good writers and badde, but perhappes also challenge from the rude multitude of rusticall Rymers, who will be called Poets, the right practise and orderly course of true Poetry. It is to be wondred at of all, and is lamented of manie, that whereas all kinde of good learning, haue aspyred to royall dignitie and starche grace in your English tongue, being not onelie founded, defended, maintained, and enlarged, but also purged from faultes, weeded of errours,  & pollished from barbarousnes, by men of great authoritie and iudgement: onelie Poetrie hath founde fewest frends to amende it, those that can, reseruing theyr skyll to theselues, those that cannot, running headlong vppon it, thinking to garnish it with their deuises, but more corrupting it with fantasticall errours. VVhat shoulde be the cause, that our English speeche in some of the wysest mens iudgements, hath neuer attained to anie sufficient ripenes, nay not ful auoided the reproch of barbarousnes in Poetry: the rudenes of the Countrey, or basenesse of wytts: or the course Dialect of the speeche? experience vtterlie disproueth it to be anie of these: what then? surelie the canckred enmitie of curious custome: which as it neuer was great freend to any good learning, so in this hath it grounded in the most, such a negligent perswasion of an impossibilitie in matching the best, that the finest witts and most diuine heades, haue contented them selues with a base kinde of fingering: rather debasing theyr faculties, in setting forth theyr skyll in the coursest manner, then for breaking custome, they would labour to adorne their Countrey and aduaunce their style with the highest  & most learnedst toppe of true Poetry. The rudenes or vnaptnesse of our Countrey to be either none or no hinderaunce, if reformation were made accordinglie, the exquisite excellency in all kindes of good learning nowe flourishing among vs, inferiour to none other nation, may sufficiently declare. That there be as sharpe and quicke wittes in England , as euer were among the peerelesse Grecians, or renowmed Romaines, it were a note of no witte at all in me to deny. And is our speeche so course, or our phrase so harshe, that Poetry cannot therein finde a vayne whereby it may appeare like it selfe? why should we think so basely of this? rather then of her sister, I meane Rethoricall Eloquution, which as they were byrth Twyns, by kinde the same, by originall of one descent: so no doubt, as Eloquence hath founde such fauourers, in the English tongue, as she frequenteth nor any more gladly: so would Poetrye if there were the like welcome and entertainment gyuen her by our English Poets, without question aspyre to wonderfull perfection and appeare farre more gorgeous and delectable among vs. Thus much I am bolde to say in behalfe of Poetrie, not that I meane to call In question the reuerend and learned workes of Poetrie written in our tongue by men of rare iudgement and most excellent Poets: but euen as it were by way of supplication to the famous and learned Lawreat Masters of Englande, that they would but consult one halfe howre with their heauenly Muse, what credite they might winne to theyr natiue speeche, what enormities they might wipe out of English Poetry, what a fitte vaine they might frequent, wherein to shewe forth their worthie faculties: if English Poetrie were truely reformed, and some perfect platforme or Prosodia of versifying were by them ratifyed and sette downe: eyther in immitation of Greekes and Latines, or where it would skant abyde the touch of theyr Rules, the like obseruations selected and established by the naturall affection of the speeche. Thus much I say, not to perswade you that are the fauourers of Englishe Poetry but to mooue it to you: beeing not the firste that haue thought vpo this matter, but one that by cosent of others, haue taken vppon me to lay it once again in your wayes, if perhaps you may stumble vppon it, and chance to looke so lowe from your diuine cogitations, when your Muse mounteth to the starres, and ransacketh the Spheres of heauen: whereby perhaps you may take compassion of noble Poetry, pittifullie mangled and defaced, by rude smatterers and barbarous immitatours of your worthy studies. If the motion bee worthy your regard it is enough to mooue it, if not, my wordes woulde simply preuaile in perswading you, and therefore I rest vppon thys onely request, that of your courtesies, you wyll graunt passage, vnder your fauourable corrections, for this my simple censure of English Poetry , wherein if you please to runne it ouer, you shall knowe breefely myne opinion of the most part of our accustomed Poets, and particularly in his place, the lyttle somewhat which I haue sifted out of my weake brayne concerning thys reformed versifying. amysse if I speake something generally of Poetrie, as, what it is, whence it had the beginning, and of what estimation it hath alwayes beene and ought to be among al sorts of people. Poetrie called in Greeke ![](/images/inline/rbrgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif)  beeing deriued from the Verbe ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , which signifieth in Latine facere in English, to make, may properly be defined, the arte of making: which word as it hath alwaies beene especially used of the best of our English Poets, to expresse ye very faculty of speaking or wryting Poetically: so doth it in deede containe most fitly the whole grace and property of the same, ye more fullye and effectually then any other English Verbe. That Poetry is an Arte, (or rather a more excellent thing then can be contayned wythin the compasse of Arte) though I neede not stande long to prooue, both the witnes of Horace, who wrote de arte Poetica , naturall property thereof may sufficiently declare: The beginning of it as appeareth by Plato, was of a vertuous and most devout purpose, who witnesseth, that by occasion of meeting of a great company of young men, to solemnize ye feasts which were called Panegeryca , and were wont to be celebrated euery fist yeere, there, they that were most pregnant in wytt, and indued with great gyfts of wysedome & knowledge in Musicke aboue the rest did vse commonly to make goodly verses, measured according to the sweetest notes of Musicke. containing the prayse of some noble vertue, or of immortalitie, or of some such thing of greatest estimation: which vnto them seemed, so heauenly and ioyous a thing, that, thinking such men to be inspyrde with some diuine instinct from heauen, they called them Vates . So when other among them of the finest wits and aptest capacities beganne in imitation of these to frame ditties of lighter matters,and tuning them to the stroake of some of the pleasantest kind of Musicke, then began there to growe a distinction and great diuersity betw eene makers and makers. Whereby (I take it) beganne thys difference: that they which handled in the audience of the people, graue and necessary matters, were called wise men or eloquent men, which they meant by Uates : and the rest which sange of loue matters, or other lighter deuises alluring unto pleasure and delight, were called Poeta or makers. Thus it appeareth, both Eloquence and Poetrie to haue had their beginning and originall from these exercises, beeing framed in such sweete measure of sentences & pleasant harmonie called [illeg.] of wordes or clauses, drawing as it were by force ye hearers eares euen whether soeuer it lysteth: that Plato affirmeth therein to be contained perswade them anie thing whether they would or no. And h eere hence is sayde, that men were first withdrawne from a wylde and sauadge kinde of life to ciuillity and gentlenes, and ye right knowledge of humanity by the force of this measurable or tunable speaking. This opinion shall you finde confirmed throughout the whole workes of Plato and Aristotle. and that such was the estimation of this Poetry at those times, that they supposed all wisedome and knowledge to be included mystically in that diuine instinction, wherewith they thought their Uates to bee inspyred. Wherevpon, throughout the noble workes of those most excellent Philosophers before named, are the authorities of Poets very often alledged; And Cicero in his Tusculane questions is of that minde, that a Poet cannot expresse verses aboundantly, sufficiently, and fully, neither his eloquence can flowe pleasauntly, or his wordes sounde well and plenteously, without celestiall instinction: which Poets themselues doo very often and gladlie witnes of themselues, as namely Ouid in 6\. Fasto: Est deus in nobis Agitante calle scimus illo. &c . Wherevnto I doubt not equally to adioyne the authoritye of our late famous English Poet, who wrote the Sheepheards Calender, where lamenting the decay of Poetry, at these dayes, saith most sw eetely to the same. Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wytt, And whence thou camest flye backe to heauen apace. &c. Whose fine poeticall witt, and most exquisite learning, as he shewed aboundantly in that p eece of worke, in my iudgment inferiour to the workes neither of Theocritus in Greeke, nor Virgill in Latine, whom hee narrowly immitateth: so I nothing doubt, but if his other workes were common abroade, which are as I thinke in ye close custodie of certaine his fr eends, we should haue of our owne Poets, whom wee might matche in all respects with the best. And among all other his workes whatsoeuer, I would wysh to haue the sight of hys English Poet, which his freend E. K., fl. 1573 did once promise to publishe, which whether he performed or not, I know not, if he did, my happe hath not beene so good as yet to s ee it. But to returne to the estimation of Poetry. Besides ye great and profitable fruites contained in Poetry, for the instruction of manners and precepts of good life (for that was cheefly respected in the first age of Poetry) this is also added to the eternall commendations of that noble faculty: that Kinges and Princes, great and famous men, did euer encourage, mayntaine, and reward Poets in al ages: because they were thought onely to haue the whole power in their handes, of making men either immortally famous for their valiaunt exploytes and vertuous exercises, or perpetually infamous for their vicious liues. Whereupon it is said of Achilles, that this onley vantage he had of Hector, that it was his fortune to be extolled and remowned by the heauenly verse of Homer. And as Tully recordeth to be written of Alexander, that with natural teares he wept ouer Achilles Tombe, in ioy that he conceiued at the consideration, howe it was his happe to be honoured wyth so diuine a worke, as Homers was. Aristotle, a most prudent and learned Philosopher, b eeing appointed Schoolemaster to the young Prince Alexander, thought no worke so m eete to be reade unto a King, as the worke of Homer: wherein the young Prince being by him instructed throughly,found such wonderfull delight in the same when hee came to maturity, that hee would not onely haue it with him in all his iourneyes, but in his bedde also vnder his pyllowe, to delight him and teache him both nights and dayes. The same is reported of noble Scipio, who finding the two Bookes of Homer in the spoyle of Kyng Darius, est eemed them as wonderfull precious Iewelles, making one of them his companion for the night, the other for the day. And not onely was he thus affected to ye one peece or parte of Poetry, but so generally he loued the professors thereof, that in his most serious affayres, and hottest warres against Numantia and Carthage, he could no whitte be without that olde Poet Ennius in his company. But to speake of all those noble and wyse Princes, who bare speciall fauour and countenannce to Poets, were tedious, and would require a rehearsall of all such, in whose time there grewe any to credite and estimation in that faculty. Thus farre therefore may suffice for the estimation of Poets. Nowe I thinke most m eete, to speake somewhat, concerning what hath beene the vse of Poetry, and wherin it rightly consisted, and whereof consequently it obteyned such estimation. To begin therefore with the first that was first worthelye memorable in the excellent gyft of Poetrye, the best wryters agr ee that it was Orpheus, who by the sw eete gyft of his heauenly Poetry, withdrew men from raungyng vncertainly, and wandring brutishly about, and made them gather together, and keepe company, made houses, and kept fellowshippe together, who therefore is reported (as Horace sayth) to asswage the who was the first that caused Citties to bee builded, and men therein to liue decently and orderly according to lawe and right. Next, was Tyrt aeus, who began to practise warlike defences, to k eepe backe enemies, and saue themselues from inuasion of foes. In thys place I thinke were most conuenient to rehearse that auncient Poet Pyndarus: but of the certaine time wherein he flourished, I am not very certaine: but of the place where he continued moste, it shoulde s eeme to be the Citty of Thebes, by Plinie who reporteth, that Alexander in sacking the same Cittie, woulde not suffer the house wherein he dwelt to be spoyled as all the rest were. After these was Homer, who as it were in one summe comprehended all knowledge, wisedome, learning, and pollicie, that was incident to the capacity of man. And who so liste to take viewe of hys two Bookes, one of his Iliades, the other his Odissea, shall throughly perceiue what the right use of Poetry is: which indeede is to mingle profite with pleasure, and so to delight the Reader with pleasantnes of hys Arte, as in ye meane time, his mind may be well instructed with knowledge and wisedome. For so did that worthy Poet frame those his two workes, that in reading the first, that is his lliads, by declaring and setting forth so liuely the Grecians assembly against Troy, together with their prowesse and fortitude against their foes, a Prince shall learne not onely courage, and valiantnesse, but discretion also and pollicie to encounter with his enemies, yea a perfect forme of wyse consultations, with his Captaines, and exthortations to the people, with other infinite commodities. Agayne, in the other part, wherein are described the manifold and daungerous aduentures of Vlisses, may a man learne many noble vertues: and also learne to escape and auoyde the subtyll practises, and perrilous entrappinges of naughty persons: and not onely this, but in what sort also he may deale to knowe and perceiue the affections of those which be n eere vnto him, and most familiar with him, the better to put them in trust with his matters of waight and importaunce. Therefore I may boldly sette downe thys to be the truest, auncientest and best kinde of Poetry, to direct ones endeuour alwayes to that marke, that with delight they may euermore adioyne commoditie to theyr Readers: which because I grounde upon Homer the Prince of all Poets, therefore haue I alledged the order of his worke, as an authority sufficiently proouing this assertion. Nowe what other Poets which followed him, and b eene of greatest fame, haue doone for the moste parte in their seuerall workes, I wyll briefely, and as my slender ability wyll serue me declare. But by my leaue, I must content my selfe to speake not of all, but of such as my selfe haue seene, and beene best acquainted withall, and those not all nor the moste part of the auncient Grecians, of whom I knowe not how many there were, but these of the Latinists, which are of greatest fame and most obuious among vs. flourished in Gr eece, at least wyse not left behynd them any notable memoriall, before the time of Homer. And Tully sayth as much, that there were none wrytt woorth the reading twyce in the Romaine tongue, before ye Poet Ennius. And surely as the very summe or ch eefest essence of Poetry, dyd alwayes for the most part consist in delighting the readers or hearers wyth pleasure, so as the number of Poets increased, they styll inclyned thys way rather then the other, so that most of them had speciall regarde, to the pleasantnesse of theyr fine conceptes, whereby they might drawe mens mindes into admiration of theyr inuentions, more then they had to the profitte or commoditye that the Readers shoulde reape by their works. And thus as I suppose came it to passe among them, that for the most part of them, they would not write one worke contayuing some serious matter: but for the same they wold likewise powre foorth as much of some wanton or laciuious inuention. Yet some of the auncientest sort of Grecians, as it seemeth were not so much disposed to vayne delectation: as Aristotle sayth of Empedocles, that in hys iudgment he was onely a naturall Philosopher, no Poet at all, nor that he was like vnto Homer in anything but hys m eeter, or number of feete, that is, that bee wryters, who compyled theyr workes in a better stile which continued not long, before it was expelled by penalty, for scoffing too broade at mens manners, and the priuie reuengements which the Poets vsed against their ill wyllers. Among these was Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophenes, but afterward the order of thys wryting Comedies was reformed and made more plausible: then wrytte Plato, Comicus, Menander, and I knowe not who more. There be many most profitable workes,of like antiquity, or rather before them, of the Tragedy writers: as of Euripides, and Sophocles, then was there Phocitides and Theagines, with many other: which Tragedies had their inuentio by one Thespis, and were pollished and amended by Æschitus. The profitte or discommoditie which aryseth by the use of these Comedies and Tragedies, which is most, hath b eene long in controuersie, and is sore vrged among vs at these dayes: what I thinke of the same, perhaps I shall breefely declare anon. Nowe concerning the Poets which wrote in homely manner, as they pretended, but ind eede, with great pythe and learned iudgment, such as were the wryters of Sheepeheards talke and of husbandly precepts, who were among the Grecians that excelled, besides Theocritus and Hesiodus I know not, of who the first, what profitable workes he left to posterity, besides hys Idillia, or contentions of Goteheards, tending most to delight, and pretty inuentions, I can not tell. The other, no doubt for his Argument he tooke in hande, dealt very learnedly and profitably, that is, in precepts of Husbandry, but yet so as he myred much wanton stuffe among the rest. The first wryters of Poetry among the Latines, shoulde s eeme to be those, which excelled in the framing of Commedies, and that they continued a long time without any notable memory of other Poets. Among whom, the cheefest that we may see or heare tell of, were these. Ennins, Caecilius, Naeuius, Licinius, Attilius, Turpitius, Trabea, Luscius, Plautus, & Terens, Of whom these two last named, haue b eene euer since theyr time most famous, and to these dayes are esteemed, as greate helpes and furtheraunces to the obtayning of good Letters. But h eere cannot I stay to speake of the most famous, renowned and excellent, that euer writte among the Latine poets. P. Virgill, who performed the very same in that tongue, which Homer had doone in Gr eeke: or rather better if better might as Sex Propert in his Elegies gallantly recordeth in his praise. Nescio quid magis nascitur Iliade . Under the person of Æneas be expresseth the valoure of a worthy Captaine and valiaunt Gouernour, together with the perrilous aduentures of warre, and polliticke deuises at all assayes. And as he immitateth Homer in that worke, so dooth he likewyse followe the very steps of Theocritus, in his most pythy inuentions of his Æglogues: yet more grauely, and in a more decent style. But not withstanding hys sage grauity and wonderfull wisedome, dyd he not altogether restrayne his vayne, but that he would haue a cast at some wanton and skant comely an Argument, if ind eede such trifles as he fathered vppon him were his owne. There followed after him, very many rare and excellent Poets, wherof the most part writt lightmatters, as Epigrammes and Elegies, with much pleasant dalliance, among whom may be accounted Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus, with diuers whom Ouid speaketh of in diuers places of his workes. Then are there two Hystoricall Poets, no lesse profitable then delightsome to bee read: Silius Captaines, one enemie to the other, that is, Scipio and Haniball: the other likewise, the fortitude of two expert warriours (yet more lamentably then the other because these warres were ciuill) Pompey and C aesar. The next in tyme (but as most men doo account, and so did he himselfe) the second in dignity, we well adioyne Ouid, a most learned, and exquiste Poet The worke of greatest profitte which he wrote, was his Booke of Metamorphosis, which though it consisted of fayned Fables for the most part, and poeticall inuentions, yet b eeing moralized according to his meaning, and the trueth of euery tale beeing discouered, it is a worke of exceeding wysedome and sounde iudgment. If one lyst in like manner, to haue knowledge and perfect intelligence of those rytes and ceremonies which were obserued after the Religion of the Hea- then, no more profitable worke for that purpose, then his bookes De fastis . The rest of his dooinges, though they tende to the vayne delights of loue and dalliavnce (except his Tristibus , Wherein he bewayleth hys exile) yet surely are mixed with much good counsayle and profitable lessons if they be wisely and narrowly read. After his time I know no worke of any great fame, till the time of Horace, a Poet not of the smoothest style, but in sharpnesse of wytt inferiour to none, and one to whom all the rest both before his time and since, are very much beholding. About the same time were Iuuenall and Persius, then Martial, Seneca a most excellent wryter of Tragedies, Boetius, Lucretius, Scatius, Val: Fiaccus, Manilius, Ausonius, Claudian, and many other, whose iust times and seuerall workes to speake of in this place, were neither much n eedefull, nor altogether tollerable, because I purposed an other argument. Onely I wyll adde two of later times, yet not farre inferiour to the most of them aforesayde, Pallengenius, and Bap: Mantuanus, and for a singuler gyft in a sweete Heroicall verse, match with them Chr. Oclan, the Authour of our Angloium pr aelia But nowe least I stray too farre from my puopose, I wylcome to our English Poets, to whom I would I were able to yeelde theyr deserued commendations: and affoorde them that censure, which I know many woulde, which can better, if they were nowe to write in my st eede. I know no memorable worke written by any Poet in our English sp eeche, vntill twenty yeeres past: where although Learning was not generally decayde at any time, especially since the Conquest of King William Duke of Normandy, as it may appeare by many famous works & learned bookes (though not of this kinde) wrytten by Byshoppes and others: yet surelye that Poetry was in small price among them, it is very manifest, and no great maruayle, for euen that light of Greeke and Latine Poets which they had, they much contemned as appeareth by theyr rude versifying, which of long time was vsed (a barbarous vse it was) wherin they conuerted the naturall property of the sw eete Latine verse, to be a balde kinde of ryming, thinking nothing to be learnedly written in verse, which fell not out in ryme, that is, in wordes whereof the middle worde of eche verse should sound a like with the last, or of two verses, the ende of both should fall in the like letters, as thus. O mal e viuenles, versus audite sequentes. Propter h aec et alia dogmata doctorum, Reor esse melius et magis decorum: Quisque suam habeat, et non proximoram. This brutish Poetrie, though it had not the beginning in this Countrey, yet so hath it b eene affected heere, that the infection thereof would neuer (nor I thinke euer will) be rooted vppe againe; I meane this tynkerly verse which we call ryme: Master Ascham sayth, that it first began to be followed and maintained among the Hunnes and Gothians, and other barbarcus Nations, who with the decay of all good learning, brought it into Italy : from thence it came into Fraunce, and so to Germany, at last conueyed into England, by men indeede of great wisedome and learning, but not considerate nor circumspect in that behalfe. But of this I must intreate more heereafter. Henry the first king of that name in England, is wonderfully extolled, in all auncient Recordes of memory, for hys singuler good learning, in all kinde of noble studies, in so much as he was named by his surname Beaucleark, as much to say, as Fayreclerke (whereof perhappes came ye name of Fayreclowe) what knowledge hee attained in the skyll of Poetry, I am not able to say, I report his name for proofe, that learning in this Country was not little est eemed of at that rude time, and that like it is, among other studies, a king would not neglect the faculty of Poetry. The first of our English poets that I have heard of, was Iohn Gower, about the time of king Rychard the seconde, as it should s eeme by certayne coniectures bothe a knight, and questionlesse a singuler well learned man whose workes I could wysh they were all whole and perfect among vs, for no doubt they contained very much deepe know- ledge and delight: which may be gathered by his freend Chawcer who speaketh of him oftentimes, in diuer places of hys workes. Chawcer, who for that excellent fame which hee obtayned in his Poetry, was alwayes accounted the God of English. Poets (such a tytle for honours sake hath b eene giuen him) was next after, if not equall in time to Gower: and hath left many workes, both for delight and profitable knowledge. farre exc eeding any other that as yet euer finie hys time directed theyr studies that way. Though the manner of hys stile may seeme blunt & course to many fine English eares at these dayes, yet in trueth, if it be equally pondered, and with good iudgment aduised, and confirmed with the time wherein he wrote, a man shall perceiue thereby euen a true picture or perfect shape of a right Poet. He by his delightsome vayne, so gulted the eares of men with his deuises, that, although corruption bare such sway in most matters, that learning and truth might skant bee admitted to shewe it selfe, yet without controllment, myght hee gyrde at the vices and abuses of all states, and gawie with very sharpe and eger inuentions, which he did so learnedly and pleasantly, that none therefore would call him into question. For such was his bolde spyrit, that what enormities he saw in any, he would not spare to pay them home, eyther in playne words, or els in some prety and pleasaunt couert, that the simplest might espy him. of his verse, and m eetely currant style, as the time affoorded comparable with Chawcer, yet more occupyed in supersticious and odde matters, then was requesite in so good a wytte: which, though he handled them commendably, yet the matters themselues b eeing not so commendable, hys estimation hath beene the lesse. The next of our auncient Poets, that I can tell of, I suppose to be Pierce Ploughman, who in hys dooinges is somewhat harshe and obscure, but ind eede a very pithy wryter, and (to hys comm eendation I speake it) was the first that I haue seene; that obserued ye quantity of our verse without the curiosity of Ryme. time of kyng Henry the eyght, who as ind eede he obtayned the Lawrell Garland, so may I wyth good ryght yeelde him the title of a Poet: hee was doubtles a pleasant conceyted fellowe, and of a very sharpe wytte, exceeding bolde, and would nyppe to the very quicke where he once sette holde. Next hym I thynke I may place master George Gaskoyne, as paine full a Souldier in the affayres of hys Prince and Country, as he was a wytty Poet in his wryting: whose commendations, because I found in one of better iudgment then my selfe, I wyl sette downe hys wordes , and suppresse myne owne, of hym thus wryteth E.K. vypon the ninth Æglogue of the new Poet. late rymers, who and if some partes of learning wanted not (albeit is well knowne he altogether wanted not learning) no doubt would haue attayned to the excellencye of those famous Poets. For gyfts of wytt, and naturall prompt nes appeare in him aboundantly. I might next speake of the dyuers workes of the olde Earle of Surrey: of the L.

D. and many others, but to speake of their seuerall gyfts, and aboundant skyll shewed forth by them in many pretty and learned workes, woulde make my discourse much more tedious. I may not omitte the deserued commendations of many honourable and noble Lordes,and Gentlemen, in her Maiesties Courte, which in the rare deuises of Poetry, haue b eene and yet are most excellent skylfull, among whom, the right honourable Earle of Oxford may challenge to him selfe the tytle of ye most excellent among the rest. I can no longer forget those learned Gentlemen which tooke such profitable paynes in translating the Latine Poets into our English tongue, whose desertes in that behalfe are more then I can vtter. Among these, I euer est eemed, and while I lyue, in my conceyt I shall account, Master D. Phaer: without doubt the best: who as ind eede hee had the best peece of Poetry whereon to sette a most gallant verse, so performed he it accordingly, and in such sort, as in my conscience I thinke would scarcely be doone againe, if it were to doo again. Notwithstanding, I speak it but as myne own fancy, not preiudiciall to those that list to thinke otherwyse. Hys worke whereof I speake, is the englishing of Æneidos of Virgill, so farre foorth as it pleased God so spare him life, which was to the halfe part of the tenth Booke, the rest b eeing since wyth no lesse commendations finished, by that worthy scholler and famous Phisition Master Thomas Twyne. labour in englishing Ouids Metamorphosis, for which Gentleman, surely our Country hath for many respects greatly to gyue God thankes: as for him which hath taken infinite paynes without ceasing, trauelleth as yet indefatigably, and is addicted without society, by his continuall laboure, to profit this nation and sp eeche in all kind of good learning. The next, very well deserueth Master Barnabe Googe to be placed, as a painefull furtherer of learning: hys helpe to Poetry besides hys owne deuises, as the translating of Pallengenius. Lodiac. Abraham Flemming as in may prety Poetis of hys owne, so in translating hath doone to hys commendations. To whom I would heere adioyne one of hys name, whom I know to haue excelled, as well in all kinde of learning as in Poetry most especially, and would appeare so, if the dainty morselles, and fine poeticall inuentions of hys, were as common abroade as I know they be among some of hys fr eendes. I wyl craue leaue of the laudable Authors of Seneca in English, of the other partes of Ouid, of Horace, of Mantuan, and diuers other, because I would hasten to ende thys rehearsall, perhappes offensyue to some, whom eyther by forgetfulnes, or want of knowledge, I must n eedes ouer passe. And once againe, I am humbly to desire pardon of the learned company of Gentlemen Schollers, and students of the Uniuersities, and Innes of Courte, yf I omitte theyr seuerall commendations in this place, which I knowe a great number of them haue worthely deserved, in many rare deuises, and singuler inuentions of Poetrie: for neither hath it b eene my good happe, to haue seene all which I haue hearde of, neyther is my abyding in such place, where I can with facility get knowledge of their workes. One Gentleman notwithstanding among them may I not ouer slyppe, so farre reacheth his fame, and so worthy is he, if hee haue not already, to weare the Lawrell wreathe, Master George VVhetstone, a man singularly well skyld in this faculty of Poetrie: To him I will ioyne Anthony Munday, an earnest traueller in this arte, and in whole name I haue s eene very excellent workes, among which surely, the most equisite vaine of a witty poeticall heade is shewed in the sweete sobs of Sheepheardes and Nymphes: a worke well worthy to be viewed, and to bee esteemed as very rare Poetrie. With these I may place Iohn Graunge, Knyght, VVylomott, Darrell, F.C. F.K. G.B. and many other, whose names come not nowe to my remembraunce. This place haue I purposely reserued for one, who if not only, yet in my iudgement principally deserueth the tytle of the rightest English Poet, that euer I read: that is, the Author of the Sh eepeheardes Kalender, intituled to the woorthy Gentlemen Master Phillip Sydney: whether it was Master Sp. or what rare Scholler in Pembrooke Hall soeuer, because himself and his fr eendes, for what respect I knowe not, would not reueale it, I force not greatly to sette downe: sorry I am that I can not find none other with whom I might couple him in this Catalogue, in his rare gyft of Poetry: although one there is, though nowe long since, seriously occupied in grauer studies, (Master Gabriell Haruey) yet, as he was once his most special fr eende and fellow Poet, so because he hath taken such paynes, not onely in his Latin Poetry (for which he enioyed great commendations of the best both in iudgment and dignity in thys Realme) but also to reforme our English verse, and to beautify the same with braue deuises, of which I thinke the cheefe lye hidde in hatefull obscurity: therefore wyll I aduenture to sette them together, as two of the rarest witts, and learnedst masters of Poetrie in England. Whose worthy and notable skyl in this faculty, I would wysh if their high dignities and serious businesses would permit, they would styll graunt to bee a furtheraunce to that reformed kinde of Poetry, which Master Haruey did once beginne to ratify: and surely in mine opinion, if h ee had chosen some grauer matter, and handled but with halfe that skyll, which I knowe he could have doone, and not powred it foorth at a venture, as a thinge betweene iest and earnest, it had taken greater effect then it did. As for the other Gentleman, if it would please him or hys fr eendes to let those excellent Poemes, Whereof I know he hath plenty, come abroad, as his Dreames, his Legends, his Court of Cupid, his English Poet with other: he shoulde not onely stay the rude pens of my selfe and others, but-also satisfye the thirsty desires of many which desire nothing more, then to see more of hys rare inuentions. If I ioyne to Master Haruey hys two Brethren, I am assured, though they be both busied with great and waighty callinges (the one a godly and learned Diuine, the other a famous and skylfull Phisition) yet if they lysted to sette to their helping handes to Poetry, they would as much beautify and adorne it as any others. If I let passe the vncountable rabble of ryming Ballet makers, and compylers of sencelesse sonets, who be most busy, to stuffe euery stall full of grosse deuises and vnlearned Pamphlets: I trust I shall with the best sort beheld excused. For though many such can frame an Alehouse song of five or sixe score verses, hobbling vppon some tune of a Northen Iygge, or Robyn hoode, or La lubber &c. And perhappes obserue iust nuber of sillables, eyght in one line, sixe in an other, and there withall an A to make a iercke in the ende: yet if these might be accounted Poets (as it is sayde some of them make meanes to be promoted to ye Lawrell) surely we shall shortly haue whole swarmes of Poets: and euery one that can frame a Booke in Ryme, though for want of matter, it be but in commnendations of Copper noses or Bottle Ale, wyll catch at the Garlande due to Poets: whose potticall poeticall (I should say) heades, I would whyshe, at their worshipfull comencements might insteede of Lawrell, be gorgiously garnished with fayre greene Barely in token of their good affection to our Englishe Malt. One speaketh thus homely of them, with whose words I wyll content my selfe for thys time, because I woulde not bee too broade wyth them in myne owne sp eeche. In regarde (he meaneth of the learned framing the newe Poets workes which writt the Sh eepheardes Calender.) I scorne and spur out the rakehelly rout of our ragged Rymers, (for so themselues vse to hunt the Letter) which without learning boaste, without iudgment iangle, without reason rage and fume, as if some instinct of poeticall spyrite had newlie ravished them, aboue the meanesse of common capacity. And beeing in the midst of all their bravery, suddainly for want of matter or of Ryme, or hauing forgotten their former conceyt, they seeme to be so payned and trauelled in theyr remembraunce, as it were a woman in Chyldbyrth, or as that same Pythia when the traunce came vpon her. Osrabidum fera corda domani &c. iudgement concerning those Poets, with whom for the most part I haue b eene acquainted through myne owne reading: which though it may seeme something impertinent to the tytle of my Booke, yet I trust the courteous Readers wyll pardon me, considering that poetry is not of that grounde and antiquity in our English tongue, but that speaking thereof only as it is English, would seeme like vnto the drawing of ones pycture without a heade. Nowe therefore by your gentle patience, wyll I wyth like breuity make tryall, what I can say concerning our Englishe Poetry, first in the matter thereof, then in the forme, that is, the manner of our verse: yet so as I must euermore haue recourse to those times and wryters, whereon the English poetry taketh as it were the discent and proprietye. English Poetry therefore b eeing considered according to common custome and auncient vse, is, where any worke is learnedly compiled in measurable speeche, and framed in wordes contayning number or proportion of iust syllables, delighting the readers or hearers as well by the apt and decent framing of wordes in equall resemblance of quantity, commonly called verse, as by the skyllfull handling of the matter whereof it is intreated. I spake somewhat of the beginning of thys measuring of wordes in iust number, taken out of Plato: and indeede the regarde of true quantity in Letters and syllables, seemeth not to haue b een much vrged before the time of Homer in Gr eece, as Aristotle witnesseth. The matters whereof verses were first made, were eyther exhortations to vertue, dehortations from vices, or the prayses of some laudable thing. From thence they beganne to vse them in exercises of immitating some vertuous and wise ma at their feastes: where as some one shoulde be appointed to represent an other mans person of high estimation, and he sang fine ditties and wittie sentences, tunably to their Musick notes: Of thys sprang the first kinde of Comedyes, when they beganne to bring into these excercises, more persons then one, whose speeches were deuised Dyalogue wise, in aunswering one another. And of such like exercises, or as some wyll n eedes haue it, long before the other, began the first Tragedies, and were so called of [illeg.] , because the Actor when he began to play his part, slewe and offered a Goate to their Goddesse: but Commedies tooke their name of [illeg.] comessatum ire , to goe a feasting, because they used to goe in procession with their sport about the Citties and Uillages, mingling much pleasaunt myrth wyth theyr graue Religion, and feasting ch eerefully together wyth as great ioy as might be deuised. But not long after (as one delight draweth another) they began to inuent new persons and newe matters for their Comedies, such as the deuisers thought meetest to please the peoples vaine: And from, these, they beganne to present in shapes of men, the natures of vertues and vices, and affections and quallities incident to men, as Iustice, Temperance, Pouerty, Wrathe, Uengeaunce, Sloth, Ualiantnes There grewe at last to be a greater diuersitye betw eene Tragedy wryters and Comedy wryters, the one expressing onely sorrowfull and lamentable Hystories, bringing in the persons of Gods and Goddesses, Kynges and Queenes, and great states, whose partes were cheefely to expresse most miserable calamities, and dreadfull chaunces, which increased worse and worse, tyll they came to the most wofull plight that might be deuised. The Comedies on the other side, were directed to a contrary ende, which beginning doubtfully, drewe to some trouble or turmoyle, and by some lucky chaunce alwayes ended to the ioy and appeasement of all parties. Thys distinction grewe as some holde opinion, by immitation of the workes of Homer: for out of hys Iliads, the Tragedy wryters founde dreadfull euents, whereon to frame their matters, and the other out of hys Odyssea tooke arguments of delight, and pleasant ending after dangerous and troublesome doubtes. So that, though there be many sortes of poeticall wrytings, and Poetry is not debarred from any matter, which may be expressed by penne or sp eeche, yet for the better vnderstanding, and breefer method of thys discourse, I may comprehende the same in three sortes, which are, Comicall, Tragicall, Historicall. Under the first, may be contained all such Epigrammes, Elegies and delectable ditties, which Poets haue deuised respecting onely the delight thereof: in the seconde, all dolefull complaynts, lamentable chaunces, and what soeuer is poetically expressed in sorrow and heauines. In the third, we may comprise, the reste of all such matters, which as indifferent betw eene the other two, doo commonly occupy the pennes of poets; such, are the poeticall compyling of Chronicles, the freendly greetings betweene freendes, and very many sortes besides, which for the better destinction may be referred to one of these three kindes of Poetry. But once againe, least my discourse runne too farre away, wyll I buckle my selfe more neerer to English Poetry: the vse wherof, because it is nothing different from any other, I thinke best to cofirme by the testimony of Horace, a man worthy to beare authority in this matter: whose very opinion is this, that the perfect perfection of poetrie is this, to mingle delight with profitt in such wyse, that a Reader might by his reading be pertaker of bothe, which though I touched in the beginning , yet I thought good to alledge in this place for more confirmation there of some of hys owne wordes. In his treatise de arte Poetica , thus hee sayth. Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poet ae, Aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere vit ae. As much to saie: All Poets desire either by their works to profitt or delight men, or els to ioyne both profitable & pleasant lessons together for the instruction of life. And againe. Omni tulit punctum qui miscuit vtile dulsi, Lectorum delectando pariterque monendo. That is He misseth nothing of his marke which ioyneth profitt with delight as well delighting his Readers, as profiting them with counsell. And that whole Epistle which hee wryt of his Arte of Poetrie, among all the parts thereof, runneth ch eefelie vppon this, that whether the argument which the Poet handleth, be of thinges doone, or fained inuentions, yet that they should beare such an Image of trueth, that as they delight they may likewise profitt. For these are his wordes. Ficla voluptatis causa sint proxima veris . Let thinges that are faigned for pleasures sake, haue a n eere resemblance of ye truth. This precept may you perceiue to bee most duelie obserued of Chawcer: for who could with more delight, prescribe such wholsome counsaile and sage aduise, where he s eemeth onelie to respect the profitte of his lessons and instructions? or who coulde with greater wisedome, or more pithie skill, vnfold such pleasant and delightsome matters of mirth as though they respected nothing, but the telling of a merry tale; so that this is the very grounde of right poetrie, to give profitable counsaile, yet so as it must be mingled with delight, For among all the auncient works of poetrie, though the most of them incline much to that part of delighting men with pleasant matters of small importaunce, yet euen in the vainest trifles among them, there is not forgotten some profitable counsaile, which a man may learne, either by flatte precepts which therein are prescribed, or by loathing such vile vices,the enormities whereof they largelie discouer. For surelie, I am of this opinion, that the wantonest Poets of all, in their most laciuious workes wherein they busied themselues, sought rather by that meanes to withdraw mens mindes (especiallie the best natures) from such foule vices, then to allure them to imbrace such beastly follies as they detected. Horace speaking of the generall dueties of Poets, sayth, O, tenerum pueri balbumque poeta fugitas , and manie more wordes concerning the profitte to be hadde out of Poets, which because I haue some of them comprised into an English translation of that learned and famous Knight, Sir Thomas Elyot, I wyll set downe his wordes. The Poet fashioneth by some pleasant meane, The speeche of children stable and vnsure: Gulling their eares from wordes and thinges vncleane, Guiding to them precepts that are pure: Rebuking enuy and wrath if it dure: Thinges well donne he can by example commend, To needy and sicke he doth also his cure To recomfort if ought he can amende. Therefore poetrie, as it is of it selfe, without abuse is not onely not vnprofitable to the liues and studies of menne, but wonderfull commendable and of great excellencie. For nothing can be more acceptable to men, or rather to be wished, the sw eete allurements to vertues, and commodious caueates from vices? of which Poetrie is exceeding plentifull, powring into gentle witts, not roughly and tirannicallie, but as it were with a louing authoritie. Nowe if the ill and vndecent prouocations, whereof some vnbridled witts take occasion by the reading of laciuious Poemes, bee obiected: such as are Ouids loue Bookes, and Elegies, Tibullus, catullus, and Martials workes, with the Comedies for the most part of Plautus and Terence: I thinke it easily aunswered. For though it may not iustlie be denied, that these workes are ind eede very Poetrie, yet that Poetrie in them is not the essentiall or formall matter or cause of the hurt therein might be affirmed, and although that reason should come short, yet this might be sufficient, that the workes themselues doo not corrupt, but the abuse of the vsers, who undamaging their owne dispositions, by reading the discoueries of vices, resemble foolish folke, who comming into a Garden without anie choise or circumspectio tread downe the fairest flowres, and wilfullie thrust their fingers among the nettles. And surelie to speake what I verelie thinke, this is mine opinion: that one hauing sufficient skyll, to reade and vnderstand those workes, and yet no staie of himselfe to auoyde inconueniences, which the remembraunce of vnlawfull things may stirre vppe in his minde, he, in my iudgement, is wholy to b ee reputed a laciuious disposed personne, whom the recitall of sins whether it be in a good worke or a badde, or vppon what occasion soeuer, wyll not staie him but prouoke him further unto them. Contrariwise, what good lessons the warie and skylful Readers shall picke out of the very worst of them, if they list to take anie heede, and reade them not of an intent to bee made the worse by them, you may see by these fewe sentences, which the foresayd Sir Thomas Elyott gathered as hee sayth at all auentures, intreating of the like argument, First Plautus in commendations of vertue, hath such like wordes. Verely vertue doth all thinges excell, For if liberty, health liuing or substaunce, Our Country our parents, and children doo well, It hapneth by vertue: she doth all aduaunce, Vertue hath all thinges vnder gouernaunce: And in whom of vertue is founde great plenty. Any thing that is good may neuer be dainty. fashions of harlots, before the eyes of young men. Thus sayth Parmeno. In thys thing I tryumphe in myne owne conceite, That I haue found for all young men the way, Howe they of Harlots shall know the deceite, Their witts and manners: that thereby they may Them perpetuallie hate, for so much as they Out of their owne houses be fresh and delicate, Feeding curiously: at home all day Lyuing beggerlie in most wretched estate. And many more wordes of the same matter, but which may be gathered by these fewe. Ouid in his most wanton Bookes of loue, and the remedies thereof, hath very many pithie and wise sentences, which a heedefull Reader may marke, and chose out from ye other stuffe. This is one. Tyme is a medicine if it shall profitt, VVine gyuen out of time may be annoyaunce. A man shall irritat vice if the prohibitt, VVhen time is not meete vnto his vtteraunce. Therefore if thou yet by counsayle are recuperable, Fly thou from idlenes and euer be stable. Martiall, a most dissolute wryter among all other, yet not without many graue and prudent sp eeches, as this is one worthy to be marked of these fond youthes which intangle theyr wytts in raging loue, who stepping once ouer shoes in theyr fancyes, neuer rest plunging till they be ouer head and eares in their follie. If thou wylte schewe bitter aduenture, And auoyde the annoyance of a pensifull hart, Set in no one person all wholly thy pleasure, The lesse maist thou ioy, but the lesse shalt thou smart. These are but fewe gathered out by happe. yet sufficient to shewe that the wise and circumspect Readers may finde very many profitable lessons, dispersed in these workes, neither take any harme by reading such Poemes, but good, if they wil themselues. Neuertheles, I would not be thought to hold opinion, that the reading of them is so tollerable, as that there n eede no respect to be had in making choyse of readers or hearers: for if they be prohibited from the tender and vnconstant wits of children and young mindes, I thinke it not without great reason: neyther am I of that deuillish opinion, of which some there are, and haue beene in England, who hauing charge of youth to instruct them in learning, haue especially made choyse of such vnchildish stuffe, to reade vnto young Schollers, as it shoulde seeme of some filthy purpose, wylfully to corrupt theyr tender mindes, and prepare them the more ready for their loathsome dyetts. to reade none of it then all of it, so thinke I that these workes are rather to be kept altogether from children, the they should haue fr ee liberty to reade them, before they be meet either of their owne discretion or by heedefull instruction, to make choyse of the good from the badde. As for our Englishe Poetrie, I know no such perilous peeces (except a fewe balde ditties made ouer the Beere potts, which are nothing lesse then Poetry) which anie man may vse and reade without damage or daunger: which indeede is lesse to be meruailed at among vs, then among the olde Latines and Greekes, considering that Christianity may be a state of such illecibrous workes and inuentions, as among them (for their Arte sake) myght obtaine passage. Nowe will I speake somewhat, of that princelie part of Poetrie, wherein are displaied the noble actes and valiant exploits of puissaunt Captaines, expert souldiers, wise men, with the famous reportes of auncient times, such as are the Heroycall in Latine: which workes, comprehending as it were the summe and grounde of all Poetrie, are verelie and incomparably the best of all other. To these, though wee haue no English worke aunswerable, in respect of the glorious ornaments of gallant handling: yet our auncient Chroniclers and reporters of our Countrey affayres, come most n eere them: and no doubt, if such regarde of our English speeche, and curious handling of our verse, had beene long since thought vppon, and from time to time beene pollished and bettered by men of learning, iudgement, and authority, it would ere this, haue matched them in all respects. A manifest example thereof, may bee the great good grace and sweete vayne, which Eloquence hath attained in our speeche, because it hath had the helpe of such rare and singuler wits, as from time to time myght still adde some amendment to the same. Among whom I thinke there is none that will gainsay, but Master Iohn Lilly hath deserued moste high commendations, as he which hath stept one steppe further therein then any either before or since he first began the wyttie discourse of his Euphues, Whose workes, surely in respecte of his singuler eloquence and braue composition of apt words and sentences, let the learned examine and make tryall thereof thorough all the partes of Rethoricke, in fitte phrases, in pithy sentences, in gallant tropes, in flowing sp eeche, in plaine sence, and surely in my iudgment, I thinke he wyll yeelde him that verdict, which Quintilian giueth of bothe the best Orators Demosthenes and Tully, that from the one, nothing may be taken away, to the other, nothing may be added. But a more n eerer example to prooue my former assertion true, (I meane ye meetnesse of our speeche to receiue the best forme of Poetry) may bee taken by conference of that famous translation of Master D. Phaer with the coppie it selfe, who soeuer please with courteous iudgement but a little to compare and marke them both together: and weigh with himselfe, whether the English tongue might by little and little be brought to the verye maiesty of a ryght Heroicall verse. First you may marke, how Virgill alwayes fitteth his matter in hande with wordes agr eeable vnto the same affection, which he expresseth, as in hys Tragicall exclamations, what patherall sp eeches he frameth? in his comfortable consolations, howe smoothely hys verse runnes? in his dreadfull battayles, and dreery byckerments of warres, howe bygge and boystrous his wordes sound? and the like notes in all partes of his worke may be obserued, Which excellent grace and comely kind of choyse, if the translatour hath not hitte very neere in our course English phrase iudge vprightly: Wee wyll conferre some of the places, not picked out for the purpose, but such as I tooke turning ouer the Booke at randon. When the Troyans were so tost about in tempestious wether, caused by Æolus at Iunoes request, and driuen vpon the coaste of Affrick with a very n eere scape of their liues: Æneas after h ee had gone a land and kylled plenty of victuals for his company of Souldiours, hee deuided the same among them, and thus louinglie and sweetely he comforted them. Æn. Lib. 1. \- et dictis moerentia pectora mulcet O socij (neq ignari sumus ante malorum) O palsi grauiora: dabit deus his quoq' finem. Uos et scyll aeem rabiem, penitusq sonantes, Accestis scopulos: vos et cyelopea saxa Experti, reuocate animos, mastumque timorem Mittite, forsan et h aec olim meminisse inuadis. Per varios casus, per lot discrimina rerum, Tendimus in Latsum: sedes vbi fata quietas Ostendunt, illic fas regna resurgere troi ae. Durate, et vosmet rebus seruate secundis. Talia vace refert, curisq ingentsbus ager Spem vuliu fimulat, premit altum corde delorem. Translated thus. choyse wordes it is pithily described, both by the Poet and the translator in the beginning of the fourth booke. At Regina graui iamdudum saucia cura Uulnus alit venis, es caco carpitur igni, &c. And in many places of the fourth booke is the same matter so gallantly prosecuted in sw eete wordes, as in mine opinion the coppy itselfe goeth no whit beyond it. Compare them likewise in the woefull and lamentable cryes of the Qu eene for the departure of Æneas, towards the ende of that Booke. Terq, quaterque manu pectus percussa decorum, Flauentesque abscissa comas, prob Iupiter, ibit? Hic ait, as noctris illuserit aduena Regnis? &c. And a little after preparing to kyll her owne selfe. Nowe likewise for the braue warlike phrase and bygge sounding kynd of thundring sp eeche, in the hotte skyrmyshes of battels, you may confer them in any of the last fiue Bookes: for examples sake, thys is one about the ninth Booke. It clamor tot u per propugnacula muris, Intendunt acries arcus, amentaque torquent. Sternitur omne solum telis. tum scuta caueq, Dant sonitum fisctu galea: pugna asper surgit? &c. They strike, they bend their bowes, they whirle from strings sharp shoting showres. All str eetes with tooles are strowed, than helmets, skulles, with battring marrd, Only one comparison more will I desire you to marke at your leysures, which may serue for all the rest, that is, the description of Fame, as it is in the 4. booke, towardes the end, of which it followeth thus. Monstrum horrendum ingens eni quot sant corpore pluma Tot vigilos oculi &c. But what n eede I to repeate any more places? there is not one Booke among the twelue, which wyll not yeelde you most excellent pleasure in conferring the translation with the Coppie, and marking the gallant grace which our Englishe speehe affordeth. And in trueth the like comparisons, may you choose out through the whole translations of the Metamorphosis by Master Golding who (considering both their Coppyes) hath equally deserued commendations for the beautifying of the English sp eeche. It would be tedious to stay to rehearse any places out of him nowe: let the other suffice to prooue, that the English tongue lacketh neyther variety nor currantnesse of phrase for any matter. I Wyll nowe spaake a little of an other kinde of poetical writing, which might notwithstanding for the variablenesse of the argument therein vsually handled, bee comprehended in those kindes before declared: that is, the compyling of Eglogues, as much to say as Goteheardes tales, because they bee commonly Dialogues or sp eeches framed or supposed betweene Sheepeheardes, Neteheardes, Goteheardes, or such like simple men: in which kind of writing, many haue obtained as immortall prayse and commendation, as in any other. the very same, is Virgill in Latin. After Virgyl in like sort writ Titus Calphurnius and Baptista Mantuan, wyth many other both in Latine and other languages very learnedlye. Although the matter they take in hand s eemeth commonlie in appearaunce rude and homely, as the vsuall talke of simple clownes: yet doo they indeede vtter in the same much pleasaunt and profitable delight. For vnder these personnes, as it were in a cloake of simplicitie, they would eyther sette foorth the prayses of theyr freendes, without the note of flattery, or enueigh grieuously against abuses, without any token of bytternesse. altogether so poeticall. But nowe yet at ye last hath England hatched vppe one Poet of this sorte, in my conscience comparable with the best in any respect: euen Master Sp: Author of the Sheepeheardes Calender, whose trauell in that p eece of English Poetrie, I thinke verely is so commendable, as none of equall iudgment can yeelde him lesse prayse for hys excellent skyll, and skylfull excellency shewed foorth in the same, then they would to eyther Theocritus or Virgill, who in mine opinion, if the coursenes of our sp eeche (I meane the course of custome which he woulde not infringe) had beene no more let vnto him, then theyr pure natiue tongues were vnto them, he would haue (if it might be) surpassed them. What one thing is there in them so worthy admiration, whereunto we may not adioyne some thing of his, of equall desert? Take Virgil and make some little comparison betw eene them, and iudge as ye shall see cause. Virgil hath a gallant report of Augustus couertly comprysed in the first Æglogue: the like is in him, of her Maiestie, under the name of Eliza. Virgil maketh a brave coloured complaint of vnstedfast fr eendshyppe in the person of Corydon: the lyke is him in his 5\.  Æglogue. Agayne behold the pretty Pastorall contentions of Virgill in the third Æglogue: respect of hys owne great learning, he may well were the Garlande, and steppe before ye best of all English Poets that I haue s eene or hearde: for I thinke no lesse deserueth (thus sayth E. K., fl. 1573 in hys commendations) hys wittinesse in deuising, his pithinesse in vttering, his complaintes of loue so louely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly, his Pastrall rudenes, his Morrall wysenesse, his due obseruing of decorum euery where, in personages, in season, in matter, in sp eeche, and generally in all seemely simplicity, of handling hys matter and framing his wordes. The occasion of his worke is a warning to other young men, who being intangled in loue and youthful vanities, may learne to looke to themselues in time, and to auoyde inconueniences which may breede if they be not in time preuented. Many good Morall lessons are therein contained, as the reuerence which young men owe to the aged in the second Eglogue: the caueate or warning to beware a subtill professor of fr eendshippe in the fift Eglogue; the commendation of good Pastors, and shame and disprayse of idle & ambitious Goteheardes in the seauenth, the loose and retchlesse lyuing of Popish Prelates in the ninth. The learned and sweete complaynt of the contempt of learning vnder the name of Poetry in the tenth. There is also much matter vttered somewhat couertly, especially ye abuses of some whom he woould not be too playne withall: in which, though it be not apparant to euery one, what hys speciall meaning was, yet so skilfully is it handled, as any man may take much delight at hys learned conueyance, and picke out much good sence in the most obscurest of it. His notable prayse deserued in euery parcell of that worke, because I cannot expresse as I woulde and as it should: I wyll cease to speake any more of, the rather because I neuer hearde as yet any that hath reade it, which hath not with much admiration commended it. One only thing therein haue I hearde some curious heades call in question : viz: the motion of some vnsauery loue, such as in the sixt Eglogue he s eemeth to deale withall, (which say they) is skant allowable to English eares, and might well haue beene left for the Italian defenders of loathsome beastlines, of whom perhappes he learned it: to thys obiection I haue often aunswered and (I thinke truely) that theyr nyce opinion ouershooteth the Poets meaning, who though hee in that as in other thinges, immitateth the auncient Poets, yet doth not meane, no more did they before hym, any disordered loue, or the filthy lust of the deuillish Pederastice take in the worse sence, but rather to shewe howe the dissolute life of young men intangled in loue of women, doo neglect the freendshyp and league with their olde freendes and familiers. Why (say they) yet he shold gyue no occasion of suspition, nor offer to the viewe of Christians, any token of such filthinesse, howe good soeuer hys meaning were: wherevnto I oppose the simple concepte they haue of matters which concerne learning or wytt, wylling them to gyue Poets leaue to vse theyr vayne as they see good: it is their foolysh construction, not hys wryting that is blameable. Wee must prescrybe to no wryters, (much lesse to Poets) in what sorte they should vtter theyr conceyts. But thys wyll be better discussed by some I hope of better abillity. One other sorte of Poeticall wryters remayneth yet to bee remembred, that is, The precepts of Husbandry, learnedly compiled in Heroycall verse. Such were the workes of Hesiodus in Greeke, and Virgils Georgickes in Latine. What memorable worke hath b eene handled in immitation of these by any English Poet, I know not, (saue onely one worke of M. Tusser, a p eece surely of great wytt and experience, and wythal very prettilye handled) And I thinke the cause why our Poets haue not trauayled in that behalfe, is especially, for that there haue b eene alwayes plenty of other wryters that haue handled the same argument very largely. Among whom Master Barnabe Googe, in translating and enlarging the most profitable worke of Heresbachius, hath deserued much commendation, as well for hys faythfull compyling and learned increasing the noble worke as for hys wytty translation of a good part of the Georgickes of Virgill into English verse. Among all the translations, which hath b eene my fortune to see, I could neuer yet finde that worke of the Georgicks wholly performed. I remember once Abraham Flemming in hys conuersion of the Eglogues, promised to translate and publishe it: whether he dyd or not I knowe not, but as yet I heard not of it. I my selfe wott well I bestowed some time in it two or thr ee yeeres since, turning it to that same English verse, which other such workes were in, though it were rudely; howe beit, I did it onely for mine owne vse, and vppon certayne respectes towardes a Gentleman mine especiall freende, to whom I was desirous to shewe some token of duetifull good wyll, and not minding it should goe farre abroade, considering howe slenderly I ranne it ouer: yet since then, hath one gott it in keeping, who as it is told me, eyther hath or wyll vnaduisedly publishe it: which iniury though he meanes to doo me in myrth, yet I hope he wyll make me some suffycient recompence, or els I shall goe neere to watch hym the like or a worse turne. But concerning the matter of our Englysh wryters, lett thys suffice: nowe shall ye heare my simple skyl in what I am able to say concerning the forme and manner of our Englyshe verse. The most vsuall and frequented kind of our English Poetry hath alwayes runne vpon, and to this day is obserued in such equall number of syllables, and likenes of wordes, that in all places one verse either immediatly, or by mutuall interposition, may be aunswerable to an other both in proportion of length, and ending of lynes in the same Letters. Which rude kinde of verse, though (as I touched before) it rather discrediteth with any comely ornament: yet b eeing so ingraffed by custome, and frequented by the most parte, I may not vtterly dissalowe it, least I should seeme to call in question the iudgement of all our famous wryters, which haue wonne eternall prayse by their memorable workes compyled in that verse. For my part therefore, I can be content to est eeme it as a thing, the perfection whereof is very commendable, yet so as wyth others I could wysh it were by men of learning and ability bettered and made more artificiall, according to the woorthines of our speeche. The falling out of verses together in one like sounde, is commonly called in English, Ryme, taken from the Greeke worde ![](/images/inline/Rgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which surely in my iudgment is verye abusiuelye applyed to such a sence: and by thys, the vnworthinesse of the thing may well appeare, in that wanting a proper name, wherby to be called it borroweth a word farre exc eeding the dignitye of it, and not appropriate to so rude and base a thing. For Ryme is properly, the iust proportion of a clause or sentence, whether it be in prose or meeter, aptly comprised together: wherof there is both an naturall and an artificiall composition, in any manner or kynde of speeche, eyther French, Italian, Spanish, or English: and is propper not onely to Poets, but also to Readers, Oratours, Pleaders, or any which are to pronounce or speake any thing in publike audience. The first begynning of Ryme (as we nowe terme it) though it be some what auncient, yet nothing famous. In Greece (they say) one Symias Rhodias, because he would be singular in somthing wryt poetically of the Fable, contayning howe Iupiter b eeing in shape of a Swanne, begatte the Egge on Leda wherof came Castor, Pollux, and Helena whereof euery verse ended in thys Ryme, and was called therefore ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ὃ ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  : but thys foolyshe attempt was so contemned and dispysed, that the people would neither admitte the Author nor Booke any place in memory of learning. Since that it was not hearde of, till ye time ye But howsoeuer or wheresoeuer it beganne, certayne it is, that in our English tongue it beareth as good grace, or rather better, then in any other: and is a faculty whereby many may and doo deserue great prayse and commendation, though our sp eeche be capable of a farre more learned manner of versifying, as I wyl partly declare heereafter. There be thr ee speciall notes necessary to be obserued in the framing of our accustomed English Ryme: the first is, that one meeter or verse be aunswerable to an other, in equall number of feete or syllables, or proportionable to the tune whereby it is to be reade or measured. The seconde, to place the words in such sorte, as none of them be wrested contrary to the naturall inclination or affectation of the same, or more truely ye true quantity thereof. The thyrd, to make them fall together mutually in Ryme, that is, in wordes of like sounde, but so as the wordes be not disordered for the Rymes sake, nor the sence hindered. These be the most pryncipall obseruations, which I thinke requisite in an English verse: for as for the other ornaments which belong thereto, they be more properly belonging to the seuerall gyfts of skylfull Poets, then common notes to be prescribed by me: but somewhat perhaps I shall haue occasion to speake heereafter. Of the kyndes of English verses which differ in number of syllables, there are almost infinite: which euery way alter according to hys fancy, or to the measure of that m eeter, wherein it pleaseth hym to frame hys ditty. Of the best and most frequented I wyll rehearse some. The longest verse in length, which I haue seene vsed in English consisteth of sixteene syllables eache two verses ryming together, thus. Thys kynde is not very much vsed at length thus, but is comonly devided, eche verse into two, whereof eche shal containe eyght syllables, and ryme crosse wyse, the first to the thyrd, and the second to the fourth, in thys manner. Great wealth is but a bayted hooke, VVhere vertue wants, and vice aboundes: VVhich men deuoure before they looke, So them in daungers deepe it drownes. An other kynd next in length to thys, is, where eche verse hath fourt eene syllables, which is the most accustomed of all other, and especially vsed of all the translatours of the Latine Poets for the most part thus. Which may likewyse and so it often is deuyded, eche verse into two, to first hauing eyght sillables, the second sixe, wherof the two sixes shall alwayes ryme, and sometimes the eyghtes, sometimes not, according to the wyll of the maker. My minde with furye fierce inflamde, Of late I knowe not howe: Doth burne Pernassus hyll to see, Adornd wyth Lawrell bowe. There are nowe wythin this compasse, as many sortes of verses as may be devised differences of numbers: wherof some consist of equall proportions, some of long and short together, some of many rymes in one staffe (as they call it) some of crosse ryme, some of counter ryme, some ryming wyth one worde farre distant from another, some ryming euery thyrd or fourth word, and so likewyse all manner of dytties applyable to euery tune that may be sung or sayd, distinct from prose or continued sp eeche. To auoyde therefore tediousnesse and confusion, I wyll repeate onely the different sortes of verses out of the Sheepeheardes Calender, which may well serue to beare authoritie in thys matter. verses, which differ eyther in length, or ryme, of destinction of the staues: but of them which differ in length or number of sillables not past sixe or seauen. The first of them is of tenne sillables, or rather five f eete in one verse, thus. Thys verse he vseth commonly in hys sw eete complayntes, and mornefull ditties, as very agreeable to such affections. The second sort hath naturally but nine syllables, and is a more rough or clownish manner of verse, vsed most commonly of him if your mark him in hys satyricall reprehensions, & hys Sheepeheardes homelyest talke, such as the second Æglogue is. The number of nine sillables in thys verse is very often altered, and so it may without any disgrace to the same, especially where the sp eeche should be most clownish and simple, which is much obserued of hym. The third kynd is a pretty rounde verse, running currantly together, commonly seauen sillables or sometime eyght in one verse, as many in the next, both ryming together: euery two hauing one the like verse after them, but of rounder wordes, and two of them likewyse ryming mutually. That verse expresseth notably, light and youthfull talke, such as is the thyrde Æglogue betw eene two Sheepheardes boyes concerning loue. Thomalin why sitten we so The fourth sort containeth in eche staffe manie vnequall verses, but most sw eetelie falling together: which the Poet calleth the tune of the waters fall. Therein is his song in prayse of Eliza. doo bathe your brest, at my request. helpe me to blaze her woorthy praise The fift, is a deuided verse of twelue sillables into two verses, whereof I spake before, and s eemeth most meete for ye handling of a Morrall matter, such as is the praise of good Pastors, and the dispraise of ill in the seauenth Æglogue. The first kinde, is called a round, b eeing mutuallie sung betweene two: one singeth one verse, the other the next, eche rymeth with himselfe. The seauenth sorte is a verie tragicall mournefull measure, wherein he bewayleth the death of some fr eend vnder the person of Dydo. such cause of mourning neuer hadst afore: matter of myrth now shalt thou haue no more. Dydo my d eere alas is dead. Dead and lyeth wrapt in leade: O heauie hearse O carefull vearse. These sortes of verses for breuities sake haue I chosen foorth of him, whereby I shall auoide the tedious rehearsall of all the kindes which are vsed: which I thinke would haue b eene vnpossible, seeing they may be altered to as manie formes as the Poets please: neither is there anie tune or stroke which may be sung or plaide on instruments, which hath not some poetical ditties framed according to the numbers thereof: some to Rogero, some to Trenchmore, to downe right Squire, to Galliardes, to Pauines, to Iygges, to Brawles, to all manner of tunes which euerie Fidler knowes better then my selfe, and therefore I will let them passe. Againe, the diuersities of the staues (which are the number of verses contained with the diuisions or partitions of a ditty) doo often times make great differences in these verses. As whe one staffe containeth but two verses, or (if they bee deuided) foure: the first or the first couple hauing twelue sillables, the other fourteene, which versifyers call Powlters measure, because so they talle their wares by dosens, Also, when one staffe hath manie verses, whereof eche one rimeth to the next, or mutuallie crosse, or distant by thr ee, or by foure, or ended contrarye to the beginning, and a hundred sortes, whereof to shewe seuerall examples, would bee too troublesome: nowe for the second point. The naturall course of most English verses s eemeth to run vppon the olde Iambicke stroake, and I may well thinke by al likelihoode, it had the beginning thereof. For if you marke the right quantitie of our vsuall verses, ye shall perceiue them to containe in sound ye very propertie of Iambick feete, as thus. u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u ¯ I that my slender oaten pipe in verse was wont to sounde: For transpose anie of those f eete in pronouncing, and make short either the two, foure, sixe, eight, tenne, twelue sillable, and it will (doo what you can) fall out very absurdly. Againe, though our wordes can not well bee forced to abyde the touch of Position and other rules of Prosodia, yet is there such a naturall force or quantity in eche worde, that it will not abide anie place but one, without some foule disgrace: as for example try anie verse. as thys. u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u ¯ Of shapes transformde to bodies strange I purpose to intreate. Make the first sillable long, or the third, or the fift & so foorth: or contrariwise make the other sillables to admitte the shortnesse of one of them places, and see what a wonderfull defacing it wilbe be to the wordes as thus. u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u     ¯     u ¯ Of strange bodies transformd to shapes purpose I to intreate. So that this is one especiall thing to be taken h eede of in making a good English verse, that by displacing no worde bee wrested against his naturall propriety, where vnto you shal perteyne eche worde to be affected, and may easilie discerne it in wordes of two sillables or aboue, though some there be of indifferencie, that wyll stand in any place. Againe, in chouching the whole sentence, the like regarde is to be had, that wee exceede not too boldly in placing the verbe out of his order, and too farre behinde the nowne: which the necessitie of Ryme may oftentimes vrge. For though it be tollerable in a verse to sette wordes so extraordinarily as other speeche will not admitt, yet heede is to be taken, least by too much affecting that manner, we make both the verse vnpleasant and the sence obscure. And sure it is a wonder to see the folly of manie in this respect, that vse not onely too much of thys ouerthwart placing, or rather displacing of wordes, in theyr Poemes and verses, but also in theyr prose or continued writings: where they thinke to rolle most smoothlie, and flow most eloquently, there by this means, come foorth theyr sentences dragging at one Authors tayle as they were tyde together with poynts, where often you shall tarrie (scratching your heade) a good space before you shall heare hys principall verbe or speciall word, leaste hys singing grace, which in his sentence is contained should be lesse, and his sp eeche seeme nothing poeticall. The thyrd obseruation is the Ryme or like ending of verses: which though it is of least importance, yet hath won such credite among vs, that of all other it is most regarded of the greatest part of Readers. And surely as I am perswaded, the regarde of wryters to this, hath b eene the greatest decay of that good order of versifying, which might are this haue beene established in our speeche. In my iudgment, if there be any ornament in the same, it is rather to be attributed to the plentifull fulnesse of our speeche, which can affoorde ryming words sufficient for the handling of any matter, then to the thing it selfe for any beautifying it bringeth to a worke: which might bee adorned with farre more excellent collours then ryming is. Not withstanding I cannot but yeelde vnto it (as custome requireth) the deserued prayses, especially where it is with good indgement ordered. And I thinke them right worthy of admiration, for their readines and plenty of wytt and capacity, who can with facility intreate at large, and as we call it extempore , in good and sensible ryme, vppon some vnacquainted matter. The ready skyll of framing anie thing in verse, besides the naturall promptnesse which many haue there vnto, is much helped by Arte, and exercise of the memory: for as I remember, I reade once among Gaskoynes workes, a little instruction to versifying, where is prescribed as I thinke thys course of learning to versifye in Ryme. When ye haue one verse well setled, and decently ordered which you may dispose at your pleasure, to ende it with what word you wyll: then what soeuer the word is, you may sp eedilie runne ouer the other wordes which are aunswerable therevnto. (for more readines through all the letters Alphabetically) whereof you may choose that which wyll best fitte the sence of your matter in that place: as for example: if your last worde ende in Booke, you may straight wayes in your minde runne them ouer thus, Brooke, Cooke, crooke, hooke, looke, nooke, pooke, rooke, forsooke, tooke awooke &c. Nowe it is twenty to one, but alwayes one of these shall iumpe with your former worde and matter in good sence. If not, then alter the first. And ind eede I thinke, that next to the Arte of memory, thys is the readyest way to attaine to the faculty ryming well Extempore, especially if it be helped with thus much paynes. Gather together all manner of wordes especially Monasillables, and place them Alphabetically in some note, and either haue them m eetely perfectly by hart (which is not verye laboursome matter) or but looke them dilligently ouer at some time, practising to ryme in indifferent often, whereby I am perswaded it wil soone be learned, so as the party haue withall any reasonable gyft of knowledge and learning, whereby hee want not bothe matter and wordes altogether. What the other circumstances of Ryming are, as what wordes may tollerably be placed in Ryme, and what not: what words doo best become a Ryme, and what not, how many sortes of Ryme there is: and such like I wyll not stay nowe to intreate. There be many more obseruations and notes to be prescribed, to the exacte knowledge of versifying, which I trust wilbe better and larger laide forth by others, to whom I deferre manie considerations in this treatise: hoping that some of greater skill will shortlie handle this matter in better sorte. Nowe the sundry kindes of rare deuises, and pretty inuentions which come from ye fine poeticall vaine of manie in strange and vnacustomed manner, if I could report them, it were worthie my trauell: such are the turning of verses: the infolding of wordes: the fine repititions: the darklie conueying of contraries, and manie such like. Whereof though I could sette downe manie: yet because I want bothe manie and the best kindes of them, I will ouerpasse: onelie pointing you to one or two which may suffice for example. Sheepheardes Calender, where you shall s ee a singuler rare pact, sleep, augment, which are most prettilie turned and wounde vppe mutually together, expressing wonderfully the dolefulnesse of the song. A deuise not much vnlike vnto the same, is vsed by some, who taking the last wordes of a certaine number of verses, as it were by the rebound of an Echo, shall make them fall out in some prettie sence. be not long I wyll rehearse one. If feare oppresse howe then may hope me shielde? Denyall sayes, vayne hope hath pleased well, But as such hope thou wouldest not be thine, So would I not the like to rule my hart. For if thou louest it bidds thee graunt forthwith Which is the ioy whereof I liue in hope. H eere if you take the last worde of euerie verse, and place them orderlie together, you shall haue this sentence: Shielde well thyne hart with hope. among some of the finest Poets this day in London: who for the rarenesse of them keeps them priuelie to themselues, and will not let them come abroad. A like inuention to the last rehearsed, or rather a better, haue I s eene often practised in framing a whole dittie to the Letters of ones name, or to the wordes of some two or three verses which is very witty, as for example this is one of W. Hunnis, which for the shortnes I rather chusde then some ye are better. If thou desire to liue in quiet rest, Gyue eare and see, but say the best. These two verses are nowe as it were resolued into dyuers other, euery two wordes or sillables being the beginning of an other like verse, in this sort. If thou   delight in quietnes of life, ------ Desire   to shunne from brawles, debate and strife: To live   in loue with GOD, with freend and foe, In rest   shalt sleepe when other cannot so. Gyue eare   to all, yet doo not all beleeue, ------ And see   the end and then thy sentence gyue: But say   For trueth of happy liues assignde The best   hath he that quiet is in minde. Thus are there infinite sortes of fine conueiances (as they may be termed) to be vsed, and are much frequented by versifyers as well in composition of their verse, as the wittines of their matter: which all I will referre to the consideration of euerie pleasant headded Poet in their proper gifts: onelie I sett downe these fewe sortes of their formes of versifying, which may stand in ste`ede to declare what manie others may be deuised in like sorte. But nowe to proc eede to the reformed kind of English verse which manie haue before this, attempted to put in practise, and to establish for an accustomed right among English Poets, you shall heare in like manner my simple iudgment concerning the same. I am fully and certainlie perswaded, that if the true kind of versifying in immitation of Gr eekes and Latines, had beene practised in the English tongue, and put in vse from time to tyme by our Poets, who might haue continually beene mending and pollyshing the same, euery one according to their seuerall gifts: it would long ere this haue aspyred to as full perfection, as in anie other tongue whatsoeuer. For why may I not thinke so of our English, seeing that among the Romaines a long time, yea euen till the dayes of Tully, they est eemed not the Latine Poetrie almost worth any thing, in respecte of the Greeke, as appeareth in the Oration pro Archia Poeta : yet afterwardes it increased in credite more and more, and that in short space: so that in Virgilles time, wherein were they not comparable with the Gr eekes? So likewise, now it seemeth not currant for an English verse to runne vpon true quantity, and those feete which the Latines vse, because it is straunge, and the other barbarous custome, beeing within compasse of euery base witt, hath worne it out of credite or estimation. But if our wryters, beeing of learning and iudgment, would rather infringe thys curious custome, then omitte the occasion of inlarging the credite of their natiue speeche, and theyr owne prayses, by practising that commendable kind of wryting in true verse: then no doubt, as in other partes of learning, so in Poetry, shoulde not stoupe to the best of them all in all maner of ornament and comlinesse. But some obiect that our wordes are nothing resemblaunt in nature to theirs, and therefore not possible to bee framed with any good grace after their vse: but cannot we the as well as the Latines did, alter the cannon of the rule acording to the quallity of our worde, and where our wordes and theyrs wyll agree, there to iumpe with them, where they will not agree there to establish a rule of our owne to be directed by; Likewise, for ye tenor of the verse might we not (as Horace dyd in the Latine) alter their proportions to what sortes we listed, and to what we sawe wold best become the nature of the thing handled, or the quallity of the words; Surely it is to be thought that if any one, of sound iudgment and learning, shoulde putt foorth some famous worke, contayning dyuers formes of true verses, fitting the measures; according to the matter: it would of it selfe be a sufficient authority without any prescription of rules, to the most part of Poets, for them to follow and by custome to ratify. For sure it is, that the rules and principles of Poetry, were not precisly followed and obserued of the first beginners, and wryters of poetry, but were selected and gathered seuerally out of theyr workes, for the direction and behoofe of their followers. And ind eede, he that shall with heedefull iudgment make tryall of the English wordes, shall not finde them so grosse or vnapt, but that they wyll become any one of ye most accustomed sortes of Latine or Greeke verses meetely, and run thereon somewhat currantly iudgment, haue ventured on a fewe, which notwithstanding the rudenes of them may serue to shewe what better might b ee brought into our speeche, if those which are of meete abilitye woulde bestowe some trauell and endeuour thereuppon. But before I sette them, downe, I wyll speake somewhat of such obseruations as I could gather necessary to the knowledge of these kinde of verses, least I should seeme to runne vpon them rashly, without regarde either of example or authority. The speciall poyntes of a true verse, are the due obseruations of the f eete, and place of the feete. The foote of a verse, is a measure of two sillables, or of thr ee, distinguished by time which is eyther long or short. A foote of two sillables, is eyther simple or mixt, that is, of like time or of diuers. A simple foote of two sillables is likewise twofolde, eyther of two long sillables called Spondaeus, as---goodnesse, or of two short called Pyrrichius as u u hyther. A myxt foote of 2\. sillables, is eyther of one short and one long called Iambus as u -dying: or of one long and one short, called Choreus as -  u  gladly. A foote of 3\. sillables in like sorte is either simple or myxt, The simple is eyther Molossus, that is of thr ee long, as \---forgiuenes: or Troch aeus, that is of 3\. short, as u u u  merylie. The mixt is of 6. diuers sortes, 1. Dactylus, of one long, and two short, as- u u happily. 2.  Anapaestus, of two shorte, and one long, as u u  -tauelers. 3. Bacchius, of one short, and two long, as u \---remembrers. 4. Palimbachius, of two long, and one short, as --- u accorded. 5. Creticus of a long, a short, and a long, as--- u -daungerous, 6. Amphibrachus, of a short, a long, and a short, as u \---  u reioyced. Many more deuisions of f eete are vsed by some, but these doo more artificially comprehende all quantities necessary to the skannning of any verse, according to Tallaeus in hys Rethorique. The place of the f eete is the disposing of them in theyr propper roomes, whereby may be discerned the difference of eche verse which is the right numbring of the same. Now as for the quantity of our wordes, therein lyeth great difficultye, and the cheefest matter in this faculty. For in truth there being such diuersity betwixt our words & the Latine, it cannot stande ind eede with great reason that they shoulde frame, wee beeing onelie directed by such rules as serue for onely Latine words, yet notwithstanding one may well perceiue by these fewe, that these kinde of verses, would well become the speeches if so bee there were such Rules prescribed, as woulde admitt the placing of our aptest and fullest wordes together. For indeede excepting a fewe, if our Monasyllables, which naturally shoulde most of them be long, we haue almost none; that wyll stande fitlie in a short foote: and therfore if some exception were made against the precise obseruation of Position, and certaine other of the rules, then might we haue as great plenty and choyse of good woordes to furnish & sette forth a verse, as in any other tongue. Likewise if there were some derection in such wordes, as fall not within the compasse of Gr eeke or Latine rules, it were a great helpe, and thereof I had great misse in these few which I made. Such as is the last sillable in these wordes, able, noble, or possible and such like: againe for the nature and force of our W. of our th, of our oo, and ee, of our wordes which admytte an e in the ende after one or two Consonantes, and many other. I for my part though (I must n eedes confesse) many faultes escaped me in these fewe, yet tooke I as good heede as I coulde and in trueth did rather alwaies omitt the best wordes and such as would naturally become the speech best, the I wolde committe any thing, which shoulde notoriously impugne the Latine rules, which herein I had onely for my direction. Indeede most of our Monasyllables I am forced to make short, to supply the want of many short wordes requisite in these verses. The Participle A, being but the English article adioyned to Nownes, I alwayes make short , both alone & in coposition, and likewise the wordes of one sillable ending in E. as the, when it is an article, he, she, ye,  &c, we I thinke should n eedes be alwayes long because we pronounce continually VVe. I, beeing alone standing for the Pronowne Ego, in my iudgment might well be vsed common: but because I neuer sawe it vsed but short I so obserued it. Words ending in ye I make short without doubt, sauing that I haue marked in others one difference which they vse in the same, that is to make it short in the ende u of an Aduerb, as  gladly, and long in the ende u of an Adiectiue as goodly: but the reason is as I take it, because the Adiectiue is or should be most commonly written thus goodlie. O, beeing an Aduerbe is naturally long: in the ende of wordes both Monasyllables and other I thinke it may be vsed common. The first of Pollisyllables I directed according to the nature of the worde, as I thought most aunswerable to Latine examples, sauing that somewhere I am constrayned to straine curtesy with the preposition of a worde compounded or such like, which breaketh no great square: as in defence or depart, &c. The myddle sillables which are not very many, come for the most part vnder the precinct of Position, whereof some of them will not possibly abide the touch, and therefore must n eedes be a little wrested: such are commonly ye Aduerbs of three sillables, as mournfully, spyghtfully and such like words, deriued of this Adiectiue, full: and therfore if there be great occasion to vse them, they must be reformed by detracting onely (l) & then they stand meetely currant, as mournfuly. The last sillables I wholly directed so neere as I could to the touch of common rules. which consisteth of sixe f eete, wherof the first foure are indifferently either Spondaei or Dactyli, the fift is euermore a dactyl, and the sixt a Spond ae, as thus. ¯     u     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u ¯     ¯ Tyterus happily thou liest tumbling vnder a beetchtree . Thys kinde of verse I haue onely s eene to be practised in our English speeche: and indeede wyll stand somewhat more order lye therein then any of the other kindes, vntill we haue some tolleration of wordes made by speciall rule. The first that attempted to practise thys verse in English, should seeme to be the Earle of Surry, who translated some part of Virgill into verse ind eede, but without regard of true quantity of sillables. There is one famous Distichon. which is common in the mouthes of all men, that was made by one Master VVatson, fellowe of S. Iohns Colledge in Cambrydge about 40, y eeres past, which for the sweetnes and gallantnes therof in all respects doth math & surpasse the Latine coppy of Horace, which he made out of Homers wordes, qui mores hominum. &c . ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u ¯     ¯ All trauellers doo gladlie report great praise of Ulisses : ¯     u     u     ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u ¯     ¯ For that he knevve manie mens maners, and savv many citties . Which two verses if they be examined throughout all the rules and obseruations of the best versifying, shall bee founde to attaine the very perfection of them all. There bee two other not much inferiour to these, which I found in ye Glosse of E. K. vppon the fift Æglogue of the newe Poet: which Tully translated out of Gr eeke into Latine, Hac habui qu ae edi &c. All that I eate did I ioy and all that I greedilie gorged . ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯ As for those manie goodlie matters left I for others . places, yet perhappes some English rule which might wyth good reason be established, would make them currant enough, and auoyde that inconuenience which is very obuious in our wordes. The great company of famous verses of thys sort, which Master Haruey made, is not vnknowne to any and are to be viewed at all times. I for my part, so farre as those examples would leade me, and mine owne small skyll affoorde me, haue blundered vppon these fewe, whereinto I haue translated the two first Æglogues of Virgill: because I thought no matter of mine owne inuention, nor any other of antiquitye more fitte for tryal of thys thing, before there were some more speciall direction, which might leade to a lesse troublesome manner of wryting. Vnder the personne of Tityrus Vyrgill beeing figured himselfe, declareth to Melibeus an nother Neateheard, the great benefittes that he receyued at Augustus hand, who in the spoyle of Mantua gaue him hys goods and substaunce againe. Tityrus , happilie thou lyste tumbling under a beech tree, All in a fine oate pipe these sweete songs lustilie chaunting: VVe, poore soules goe to wracke, and from these coastes be remooued, And fro our pastures svveete: thou Tityr, at ease in a shade plott Makst thicke groues to resound vvith songes of braue Amarillis. O Melib aeus, he vvas no man but a God vvho releeude me: Euer he shalbe my God: from this same Sheepcot his alters Neuer, a tender Lambe shall vvant, vvith blood to bedevv them. This good gift did he giue, to my steeres thus freelie to vvander, And to my selfe (thou seest) on pipe to resound vvhat I listed . Grutch thee sure I doo not, but this thing makes me to vvonder, VVhence comes all this adoo: vvith griceuous paine not a little Can I remooue my Goates: here, Tityre skant get I forvvard Poore olde crone, tvvo tvvyns at a clappe ith boysterous hasilles Left she behind, best hope i'my flock laid hard on a bare stone. Had not a lucklesse lotte possest our mindes, I remember VVarnings oft fro the blast burnt oake vve savv to be sent vs. Oft did a left hand crovv foretell these thinges in her hull tree, But this God let vs heare vvhat he vvas, good Tityre tell me . That same Cittie so braue vvhich Rome vvas vvont to be called, Foole did I thinke, to be like this of ours, vvhere vve to the pastures VVonted vvere to remooue from dammes our young prettie Cattell. Thus did I thinke young vvhelpes, & Kids to be like to the mothers, Thus did I vvont compare manie great thinges vvith many little. But this aboue all tovvnes as loftily mounteth her high head , As by the lovve base shrubbes tall Cypresse shooteth aboue them . And vvhat did thee mooue that needes thou must goe to see Rome ? Freedome: vvhich though late, yet once lookt backe to my pore state, After time vvhen haires from my beard did ginne to be vvhitish: Yet lookt back at last and found me out after a long time. VVhen Amarill vvas once obtainde , Galatea departed: For (for I vvill confesse) vvhilst as Galatea did hold mee, Hope did I not for freedome, and care had I none to my cattell. Though manie faire young beastes our folde for the aulters aforded And manie cheeses good fro my presse vvere sent to the Cittie: Seldome times did I bring anie-store of pence fro the markett . O Amarill, vvherefore, to thy Gods (very much did I meruaile) Heavilie thou didst praie: ripe fruites vngathered all still: Tityrus is not at home: these Pyne trees Tityre mist thee. Fountaines longed for thee: these hedgrovves vvisht: thy return home VVhat vvas then to be doone? from bondage could not I vvind out: Neither I could haue found such gentle Gods any vvhere els. There did I see (Melibae) that youth vvhose hestes I by course still Fortnights whole to obserue on the Alters sure will I not faile. Thus did he gentlie graunt to my sute vvhen first I demanded. Keepe your heardes poore staues as erst, let bulles to the makes still . Happy olde man, then thou shalt haue thy farme to remaine still, Large and large to thy selfe, others nought but stonie grauell: And foule slymie rush wherewith their lees be besprinkled. Heere no unwoonted foode shall grieue young theaves who be laded, Nor the infections foule of neighbours stocke shall annoie them. Happie olde man. In shaddowy bankes and coole prettie places, Heere by the quainted floodes and springs most holie remaining. Here, these quicksets fresh which lands seuer out fro thy nighbors And greene willow rowes which Hible bees doo reioice in, Oft fine whistring noise, shall bring sweete sleepe to thy sences. Vnder a Rock side here will proyner chaunt merrie ditties. Neither on highe Elme trees, thy beloude Doues loftilie sitting, Nor prettie Turtles trim, vvill cease to crooke vvith a good cheere . First, therefore swift buckes shall flie for foode to the skies ward, And from fish vvith drawn broade seas theselues shal auoid hence: First, (both borders broke). Araris shal run to the Parthanes, And likewise Tygris shall againe runne backe to the Germanes: Era his countnaunce sweete shall slippe once out from my hart roote . VVe poore soules, must some to the land cald Affrica packe hence. Some to the farre Scythia, and some must to the swift flood Oaxis. Some to Britannia coastes quite parted farre fro the whole world. Oh these pastures pure shall I nere more chance to behold yee? And our cottage poore with warme turves couerd about trim. Oh these trim tilde landes, shall a rechlesse souldier haue them? And shall a Barbarian haue this croppe? see what a mischiefe Discord vile hath araisde? for whom was our labour all tooke? Novv Melibas ingraft pearie stocks, sette vines in an order. Now goe (my braue flocke once that were) O now goe my kidlings. Neuer againe shall I now in a greene bowre sweetelie reposed See ye in queachie briers farre a loofe clambring on a high hill. Now shall I sing no Iygges, nor whilst I doo fall to my iunkets. Shall ye my Goates, cropping sweete flowres & leaues sit about me . Yet thou maist tarrie heere, and keepe me companie this night, All on a leauie couch: good Aples ripe I doo not lacke, Chestnutts sweete good store, and plentie of curddes will I set thee. Marke i' the Towne how chimnie tops doo beginne to be smoaking, And fro the Mountaines high how shaddowes grow to be larger. Virgill in the personne of Corydon as some thinke, complayneth that he is not so gratious with Augustus as he would bee: or els it is to be referred to a youth Alexander , which was given him of Asinius Pollio , whom he blameth for the vnstedfastnes of his witt and wandring appetite, in refusing the freendly counsayle which he vsed to giue him. All his masters deare: and nought had he whereby to hope for. Onely in beechen groues, and dolesome shaddowy places. Dailie resorted he: there these rude disordered outcryes, Hylles and desert woodes throughout thus mournfully tuned. O hard harted Alex, hast thou no regard to my sweete song? Pyttiest me not a whitt: yea makst me nowe that I shall dye. Yet doo the beastes find out fine shades and trim pretty coole plottes, And fro the sun beames safe lie lyzardes vnder a bush tufte: And for workmen toughe with boyling heate so beparched, Garlick sauery sweete and coole hearbes plenty be dressed. But, by the scorcht banke sydes i'thy foote steppes stil I goe plodding. Hedgerowes hott doo resound with Grashops mournfully squeaking. O had I not ben better abyd Amarillis her anger? And her proude disdaine? yea better abyde my Menalcas? What though brown did he seeme? yea what though thou be so gallant O thou fine chery cheekt child trust not t' much to thy beauty. Black violetts are tooke when dayses white be refused. Me thou dost despise vnknowne to thy selfe yet Alexis: What be my riches great in neate, in milke what aboundance. In Sicill hylles be my Lambes of which there wander a thousand. All times, colde and hoteyet fresh milke neuer I wanted. Such be my Musicke notes, as (when his flockes he recalling) Amphion of Dirce did vse on shore Aracynthus. Much mishapt I am not for late in a bancke I behelde me, VVhen still seas were calme, to thy Daphnis neede not I giue place No, though thou be the iudge, if pictures haue any credite. O were thou content to remaine with me by the downes heere, In these lodgings small, and helpe me proppes to put vnder, And trym kydling flocke with me to driue to the greene fieldes: Pan in singing sweete with me shouldst brauely resemble: Pan, was first the inuenter, pypes to adioyne in an order: Pan, poore flockes and Sheepheardes to most duly regardeth. Those fine lips thou needst not feare to bruse with a sweete pype: VVhat did Amynt forsake i'this excerise to be cunning? One pype with seauene sundry stops matcht sweetly together. Haue I my selfe, Dam aetas which ats death he bequeathd me, And sayd, heere, thou art now the second which euer hath ought it. So sayd Damaetas: but Amyntas spightfully scornde it. Also, two pretty small wyld kyddes, most goodlie bespotted Haue I, that heere i'the dales doo runne skant safe I doo feare me. Twyce in a day two teates they suck: for thee will I keepe them. Wondrous faine to haue had them both was Thestylis of late: And so she shall: for I see thou scornst whatso-euer I giue thee. Come hyther O thou sweete face boy: see see, to thy selfe heere How fayre Nymphes in baskets full doo bring manie Lillies: White violets sweete Nais plucks and bloomes fro the Poppies, Narcyss, and dyll flowres most sweete that sauoureth also. Casia, broade mary Goldes, with pancyes, and Hyacinthus. And I my selfe rype peaches soft as silke will I gather. And such Chestnutts as Amarill was wont to reioyce at. Ploms wyll I bring likewise: that fruite shall be honored also. And ye O Lawrell twygges shall I croppe, and myrte thy selfe next. For ye be wont, (bound both in a bunch) most sweetely to fauour. Thou art but a Clowne Corydon: these gifts esteemes not Alexis: Nor by thy gifts to obtaine art meete to incounter Iolas. VVretch,(ahlas) whats this that I wish? south blasts to the yong flowers Or cleere crystall streames with loathsome swyne to be troubled? Ah mad boy from whom doost runne? why Gods ithe woods dwelt: And Paris erst of Troy: Pallas most gladly reioyseth, In these bowres: and in trym groues we all chiefely delight vs. Grym Lyonesse doth course curst wolues, so wolues doo the kydlinges. And these wanton Kyddes likewise these faire Cytisus flowers. Thee Corydon (O Alex) some pleasure euery wight pulles. See these yoked steeres fro the plough nowe seeme to be lett loose. And these shaddowes large doo declare thys sun to depart hence Styll I doo burne in loue. What meane in loue to be lookt for? Ah Corydon Corydon, what raging fury dooth haunt thee, Halfe cropt downe be thy vynes and broade brauncht elmes ouerhang them. Rather about some needefull worke now busy thy selfe well, Either on Osyers tuffe or bulrush weaue pretty basketts. And if Alexis scorne thee still, mayst hope for another. I durst not enterpryse to goe any further with this rude translation: b eeing for the respects aforesayd a troublesome and vnpleasant peece of labour: And therefore these shall suffice till further occasion shall serue to imploy some profitable paynes in this behalfe. consisteth of foure f eete & two od sillables: viz: the two first f eete, eyther Dactyli or Spond aei indifferent, the one long sillable: next two Dactyli and an other long sillable ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯ u     u     ¯     u     u     ¯ some doo measure it in this sorte (and more truely yet not so readily to all) accouting first two indifferently either Dactyli or Spond aei, then one Spond aei & two Anapaesti. But it commeth all to one reckoning. Thys verse is always vnseperably adioyned vnto the Hexameter, and serueth especially to the handling of loue and dalliances, whereof it taketh the name. It will not frame altogether so currantlye in our English as the other, because the shortnesse of the seconde penthimimer will hardly be framed to fall together in good sence, after the Latine rules. I haue not s een very many of them made by any: and therefore one or two for example sake shall be sufficient. Ingenium quondam suerat pretiosius auro, At nune barbaria est grandis habere nihil . Learning once was thought to be better then any gold was, Now he that hath not wealth is but a barbarian, Omnia sunt hominum tenui pendentia filo: Et subito casu qu ae valuere ruunt . Tis but a slender thread, which all mens states do depend on: And most goodly thinges quickly doo fall to decay. tryall in them: but the Sapphic I assure you, in my iudgment wyl doo very pretty, if ye wants which I speake were once supplied. For tryall of which I have turned the new Poets sw eete song of Eliza into such homely Sapphick as I coulde. third verse be sette one Adonium verse, which consisteth of a dactyl and a spond ae. It is more troublesome and tedious to frame in our sp eeche by reason they runne without difference, euery verse being a like in quantity throughout, yet in my iudgement standeth meetely well in the same. I pray looke the Coppy which I haue translated in the fourth Æglogue of the Sheepheardes Calender: ye song of Colins the name of Eliza. doo bathe your brest: at my request: helpe me to blase her worthy praise that blessed wight: in princely plight. so sprang her grace, of heauenly race, The Saphick verse. ¯     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     u     ¯     ¯ ¯     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     u     ¯     ¯ ¯     u     ¯     ¯     ¯     u     u     ¯     u     ¯     ¯ ¯     u     u     ¯     ¯ at my request nowe. mounteth aboue farre, now let vs all pray. cannot aproche her. brauely bes eeming. ioyfull a sight ist. haue y ee the like seene? like who remembreth: Ph aebus once p eept foorth with a goodly guilt hewe, it did amaze him. for to be vanquisht. thou art in a dump dasht? other a warning.

And the deluce flowre. One verse there remaineth vntranslated as yet,with some other of this sorte, which I meant to haue finished, but by reason of some let which I had, I am constrained to defer to some other time, when I hope to gratify the Readers with more and better verses of this sort: for in trueth I am perswaded a little paine taking might furnish our sp eeche with as much pleasaunt delight in this kinde of verse, as any other whatsoeuer. Horace, first gathered by Georgius Frabricius Cremnicensis : which I thought good to annex to thys Treatise, as very necessary obseruations to be marked of all Poets. straunge, or monstrous. For a womans head, a horse neche, the bodie of a dyuers coloured Byrd, and many members of sundry creatures compact together, whose legges ending like a Fyshes tayle: this in a picture is a wonderful deformitie: but if there be such diuersitye in the frame of a speeche. what can be more vncomely or ilfavoured? 2\. The ornaments or colours must not bee too many, nor rashly aduentured on, neither must they be vsed euery where and thrust into euery place. 3\. The proprietie of sp eeche must bee duely obserued, that wayghty and great matters be not spoken slenderly, or matters of length too briefly: for it belongeth much both to the comlinesse and nature of a matter: that in big matters there be lykewise vsed boysterous wordes. 4\. In Poeticall descriptions, the sp eeche must not exceede all credite, nor any thing fainedlie brought in, against all course of nature. 5\. The disposing of the worke must be such, that there be no offence committed, as it were by too exquisite dilligence: for many thinges may be oft committed, and some thing by too curious handling be made offenciue. Neyther is it in one part to be well furnished, and in another to be neglected. Which is prooued by example of a Caruer, who expressed very artificially the heade and vpper part of a body, but the rest hee could not make an ende of. Againe, it is prooued thus, that a body should not be in other partes beautifull, and yet bee deformed in the crooked nose: for all the members in a well shapen bodie must be aunswerable, sound, and well proportioned. 6\. He that taketh in hande to write any thing must first take h eede that he be sufficient for the same: for often vnwary fooles through their rashnes are ouertooke with great want of ability. 7\. The ornament of a worke consisteth in wordes, and in the manner of the wordes, are either simple or mixt, newe or olde, propper or translated. In them all good iudgment must be vsed and ready wytt. The chiefest grace is in the most frequented wordes, for the same reason holdeth in wordes, as doth in coynes, that the most vsed and tried are best est eemed. 8\. The kinde of verse is to be considered and aptly applied to the argument, in what measure is most m eete for euery sort. The most vsuall kindes are foure, the Heroic, Eelegiac, lambick, and Lyric. 9\. One must vse one kynde of sp eeche alike in all wrytings. Sometime the Lyric ryseth aloft, sometime the comicall. To the Tragicall wryters belong properly the bygge and boysterous wordes. Examples must be interplaced according fitly to the time and place. 10\. Regarde is to be had of affections: one thing becommeth pleasant persons, an other sadde, an other wrathfull, an other gentle, which must all be h eedefully respected. Three thinges therefore are requisite in verses, beauty, sweetnes, and the affection. Theophrastus sayth that this beauty or delectablenesse is a deceyt, and Aristotle calleth it [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif)  [illeg.] a momentany tyrrany. Sw eetnesse retayneth a Reader, affection moueth him. 11\. Euery person must be fitted accordingly, and the sp eeche well ordered: wherein are to be considered the dignity, age, sex, fortune, condition, place, Country, &c, of eche person. 12\. The personnes are eyther to be fayned by the Poets them selues, or borrowed of others, if he borrow them, then must hee obserue ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , that is, that he folow that Author exactly whom he purposeth to immitate, and whereout he bringeth his examples. But if he fayne newe personnes, then must he k eepe his ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , that is equallie: so bringing them in eche place, that it be alwayes agr eeable, and the last like vnto the first, and not make one person nowe a bolde boaster, and the same straight waies a wise warie man, for that is passing absurd. Againe, euery one must obserue ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , agreeable euery where, a man to be stoute, a woman fearefull, a seruant crafty, a young man gentle. 13\. Matters which are common may be handled by a Poet as they may be thought propper to himselfe alone. All matters of themselues are open to be intreated of by any man: but if a thing he handled of some one in such sort, as he thereby obtaine great prayse, he maketh it his owne or propper to himselfe, as many did write of the Troiane war, but yet Homer made matter. which was common to all, propper to himselfe. 14\. Where many thinges are to be taken out of auncienter tongues, as the Latines tooke much out of the Gr eekes, the wordes are not so preciselie to be followed, but that they bee altered according to the iudgment and will of the Immitator, which precept is borrowed of Tully, Non verbum verbo necesse est reddere. 15\. The beginning must not be foolishly handled, that is, straungly or too long. 16\. The proposition or narration let it not be far fetched or vnlikely, and in the same forget not the differences of ages and persons. 17\. In a Comedie it is needfull to exhibite all the actions openlie, as such as are cruell, vnhonest, or ougly, but such thinges may better b ee declared by some meete and hand- some wordes, after what sorte they are supposed to bee doone. 18\. If a Commedye haue more Actes then fiue, it is tedious, if fewer, it is not sufficient. It fytteth not to bring in the personnes of Gods, but in verie great matters. Cicero sayth, when the Tragedy wryters cannot bring theyr matters to good passe, they runne to God. Let not more personnes speake together then foure for avoyding confusion. admonished, or reprehended, or counsayled vnto vertue. Such matter must bee chosen for the Chorus, as may bee m eete and agreeable to that which is in hand. As for instruments and singing, they are Reliques of olde simplicitye. For the Musicke commonlye vsed at Theaters and the licenciousnesse of theyr songes, which together wyth theyr wealth increased among the Romaines, is hurtfull to discipline and good manners. 19\. In a Satyr the clownish company and rurall Gods, are brought in to temperate the Heauinesse of Tragedies, wyth some myrth and pastyme. In iesting it must be obserued that it bee not lacyuious or Rybaldlike, or slaunderous, which precept holdeth generallie in all sortes of wryetynges. of the personnes: as of Bacchus, Silenus, or the Satyres. Againe of the vnm eetnesse or inconuenience of the matter, and of the wordes that they be fitted according to the persons: of Decorum, that he which represented some noble personage in the Tragedie, b ee not some busy foole in the Satyr: finallie of the hearers, least they bee offended by myring filthy matters with iestes, wanton toyes wyth vnhonest, or noysome with merry thinges. 20\. The f eete are to be applied propper to euery kinde of verse, & therin a Poet must not vse too much licence or boldnes. The aucient writers in Iabick verses vsed at first pure Iabicks: Afterwards Spond aeus was admitted into Locos impares , but at last such was the licentious custome, that they woulde both Spond aeus where they listed, and other f eete without regarde. 21\. In compyling of verses great care and circumspection must be vsed. Those verses which be made Extempore, are of no great estimation: those which are vnartificiall, are vttely repelled as too foolish. Though many doo lightlie regard our verses, yet ought the Carelesnesse of the hearers to bee no cause in vs of errour and negligence. Who desireth to make any thing worthy to be heard of learned eares, let hym reade Gr eeke Authors heedefullie and continually. 22\. Artes haue their increasinges euen as other things, b eeing naturall, so haue Tragedies which were first rudely inuented by Thespis, at last were much adorned by Æschylus: at the first they were practised in Uillages of the Countrey, afterwardes brought to stages in great Citties. 23\. Some Artes doo increase, some doo decay by a certayne naturall course. The olde manner of Commedies decayde, by reason of slaundering which therein they vsed aginst many, for which there was a penaltie appointed, least their bitternes should proceede too farre: In place of which among the Latines came the Satyres. Aristophanes, of the middle sorte, Plato Comicus, of the last kinde Menander, which continued and was accounted the most famous. 24\. A Poet should not content himselfe onely with others inuentions, but himselfe also by ye example of old wryters sholde bring something of his owne industry, which may bee laudable. So did they which writte among the Latines the Comedies called Togat ae, whose arguments were taken from ye Gr eekes, and the other which wrytt the Pretextatae, whereof the arguments were Latine. 25\. H eedefulnesse and good composition maketh a perfecte verse, and that which is not so may be reprehended. The faculty of a good witte exceedeth Arte. 26\. A Poet that he may be perfect, hath neede to haue know ledge of that part of Philosophy which informeth ye life to good manners. The other which pertaineth to naturall thinges, is lesse plausible, hath fewer ornaments, and is not so profitable. 27\. A Poet to the knowledge of Philosophie shoulde also adde greater experience, that he may know the fashions of men and dispositions of people. Thys profit is gott by trauelling, that whatsoeuer he wryteth he may so expresse & order it, that hys narration may be formable. 28\. The ende of Poetry is to wryte pleasant thinges, and profitable. Pleasant it is which delighteth by b eeing not too long, or vneasy to be kept in memory, and which is somewhat likelie, and not altogether forged. Profitable it is, which styrreth vppe the mindes to learning and wisedome. 29\. Certaine escapes are to be pardoned in some Poets, specially in great workes. A faulte may bee committed either in respect of hys propper Arte, or in some other Arte: that a Poet shoulde erre in precepts of hys owne arte, is a shamefull thing, to committe a faulte in another Arte is to be borne withal: as in Virgill, who fayneth that Æneas comming into Affrica slew with hys darte certaine Stagges, whereas ind eede Affrica hath in it none of those beastes. Such errours doo happen eyther by vnh eedefulnes, when one escapeth them by negligence: or by the common fragility of man, because none there is which can know all thinges. Therefore this last kinde of errour is not to be stocke vppon. 30\. A good Poet should haue respect to thys, how to retaine hys Reader or hearer. In a picture some thing delighteth b eeing sette farre of, something neerer, but a Poet should delight in all places as well in sunne as shaddowe. 31\. In a Poet is no meane to be admitted, which if h ee bee not he of all is the worst of all. 32\. A Poeme if it runne not sw eetely and smoothly is odious: which is proued by a simile of the two senses, hearing and tasting. as in sw eete and pleasaunt meates. And the Poem must bee of that sorte, that for the sweetnesse of it may bee acceptable and continue like it selfe vnto the ende, least it wearye or driue away a Reader. 33\. H ee that would wryte any thing worthy the posteritye, let him not enterprise any thing wherevnto his nature is not agreeable. Mercury is not made of wood (as they say) neyther doth Minerua fauour all studies in euery one. In all Artes nature is the best helpe, and learned men vse commonly to say that A Poet is as well borne as made a Poet. 34\. Let no man est eeme himselfe so learned, but that he may submytte hys wrytinges to the iudgments of others, and correct and throughly amend the same himselfe. 35\. The profitte of Poetry sprang thus, for that the auncient wyse men set downe the best things that pertained to mans life, manners, or felicity, and examining and proouing the same by long experience of time, when they were aged they published them in wrytinges. The vse or Poetry what it was at the first, is manifest by the examples of the moste learned men: as of Orpheus 36\. In an artificiall Poet thr ee thinges are reqisite, nature, Arte, and dilligence. 37\. A wryter must learne of the learned, and he must not sticke to confesse when he erreth: that the worse he may learne to auoyde,and knowe howe to follow the better. deceiue his posterity, he confessed certayne errours, as it well became an excellent minded man, and one of great credite. For (as sayth Celsus) light witts because they haue nothing, wyll haue nothing taken from them. 38\. In making choise of such fr eendes as should tell vs the trueth, and correct our wrytinges, heedefull iudgment must bee vsed: least eyther we choose vnskylfull folke, or flatters, or dissemblers, The vnskilfull know not how to iudge, flatterers feare to offende, dissemblers in not praysing doo s eeme to commende 39\. Let no man deceiue himselfe, or suffer himselfe to be deceiued, but take some graue learned man to be iudge of his dooing, and let him according to hys counsayle change and put out what h ee thinketh good. 40\. He which wyll not flatter and is of ability to iudge, let him endeuour to nothing so much, as to the correction of that which is wrytten, and that let be doone with earnest and exqisite iudgment. He which dooth not thus, but offendeth wilfully in breaking his credite too rashly, may be counted for a madde, furious, and franticke foole. 41\. The faultes commonly in verses are seauen, as either they be destitute of Arte, of facility, or ornament: or els, they be superfluous, obscure, ambicious, or n eedelesse. 42\. An immitation should not be too seruile or superstitious, as though one durst not varry one iotte from the example: neyther should it be so sencelesse or vnskilfull, as to immitate thinges which are absurde, and not to be followed. 43\. One should not altogether treade in the steppes of others, but sometimes he may enter into such waves as haue not beene haunted or vsed of others. Horace borrowed yeIambick verse of Archilocus, expressing fully his numbers and eleganty, but his vns eemely wordes and pratling tauntes hee moste wyshlye shunned. 44\. In our verses we should not gape after the phrases of the simpler sorte, but striue to haue our writings allowable in the iudgments of learned menne. 45\. The common peoples iudgments of Poets is seldome true, and therefore not to be sought after. The vulgar sort in Rome iudged Pacuuious to be very learned, Accius to bee a graue wryter, that Affranius followed Menander, Plautus, Epicharmus: that Terence excelled in Arte C aecilius in grauity: but the learned sorte were not of this opinion. There is extant in Macrobius ( I knowe not whether Angellius) the like verdite concerning them which wryt Epigrammes, That Catullus and Caluus wrytt fewe thinges that were good, N aeuius obscure, Hoitensius vnconiely, Cynna 46\. The olde wryters are so farre to be commended, as nothing be taken from the newe: neyther may we thinke but that the way lyeth open styll to others to attaine to as great matters. Full well sayd Sidonius to Eucherius, I reuerence the olde wryters, yet not so as though I lesse est eemed the vertues and desertes of the wryters in this age. 47\. Newnes is gratefull if it be learned: for certaine it is, Artes are not bothe begunne and perfected at once, but are increased by time and studie: which not withstanding when they are at the full perfection, doo debate and decrease again. Cic. de orat. There is nothing in the world which bursteth out all at once, and commeth to light all wholly together. 48\. No man should dare to practise an Arte that is daungerous, especially before he haue learned the same perfectly: so doo guyders of Shyppes: so doo Phisitions: but so did not manie Romaine Poets (yea so doo not too many English wryters) who in a certaine corragious heate gaped after glory by wryting verses, but fewe of them obtayned it. 49\. A Poet should be no lesse skylfull in dealing with the affectes of the mynde, then a tumbler or a Iuggler should bee ready in his Arte. And with such pyth shoulde he sette foorth hys matters, that a Reader should s eeme not onely to heare the thing, but to see and be present at the dooing thereof. Which faculty Fabius calleth ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif)  [illeg.] and Aristotle [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif)  . 50\. Poets are either such as desire to be liked of on stages, as Commedie and Tragedie wryters: or such as woulde bee regestred in Libraries. Those on stages haue speciall respect to the motions of the minde, that they may stirre bothe the eyes and eares of their beholders. But the other which s eeke to please priuately with the walles, take good aduisement in their workes, that they may satisfy the exact iudgments of learned men in their studies. 51\. A Poet shoulde not bee too importunate, as to offende in vnseasonable sp eeches: or vngentle, as to contemne the admonitions of others: or ambicious, as to thinke too well of hys owne dooinges: or too wayward, as to thinke, reward enough cannot be gyuen him for his deserte, or finally too proude, as to desyre to be honoured aboue measure. 52\. The emendations of Poemes be very necessary, that in the obscure poyntes many thinges may be enlightned, in the baser partes many thinges may be throughly garnished. Hee may take away and put out all vnpropper & vnseemely words, he may with discretion immitate the auncient wryters, he may abridge thinges that are too lofty, mittigate thynges that are too rough, and may vse all remedies of speeche throughout the whole worke. The thinges which are scarce seemely, he may amende by Arte and methode. 53\. Let a Poet first take vppon him, as though he were to play but an Actors part, as he may b ee esteemed like one which wryteth without regarde neyther let him so pollish his works, but that euery one for the basenesse thereof, may think to make as good. Hee may likewyse exercise the part of gesturer, as though he seemed to meddle in rude and common matters, and yet not so deale in them, as it were for variety sake, nor as though he had laboured them thoroughly but tryfled with them, nor as though he had sweat for them, but practised a little. For so to hyde ones cunning, that nothing should seeme to bee laborsome or exquisite, when not withstanding, euery part is pollished with care and studie, is a speciall gyft which Aristotle 54\. It is onely a poynt of wysedome, to vse many and choyse elegant wordes, but to vnderstand also and to set foorth thinges which pertaine to the happy ende of mans life. Whrerevppon the Poet Horace, calleth the Arte poeticall, without the knowledge of learning and philosophy, a prating vanity. Therfore a good and allowable Poet, must be adorned with wordes, plentious in sentences, and if not eqall to an Orator, yet very n eere him, and a speciall louer of learned men. FINIS. which I haue compyled, not as an exquisite censure concerning this matter, but (as thou mayst well perceiue, and) in trueth to that onely ende that it might be an occasion, to haue the same througly and with greater discretion, taken in hande and laboured by some other of greater abilitie: of whom I knowe there be manie among the famous Poets in London, who bothe for learning and leysure, may handle this Argument far more pythilie then my selfe. Which if any of them wyll vouchsafe to doo, I trust wee shall haue Englishe Poetry at a higher price in short space: and the rabble of balde Rymes shall be turned to famous workes, comparable
