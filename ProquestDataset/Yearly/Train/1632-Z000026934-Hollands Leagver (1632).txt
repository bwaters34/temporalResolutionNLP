 OR, AN HISTORICAL Discourse of the Life and Actions, of Dona Britanica Hollandia , the Arch-Mistris of the wicked Women of Eutopia . dedicated to the World, whither all discourses wander, to the reformation of vice, which is Good mens wishes, and to the aduancement of vertue, which is the ayme of all honest affections, so that making my summe iust with mine account, I doubt not but I shall discharge my selfe, of that which I owe to posteritie, to the ruine of sinne, and the immortall safe-guarde of piety. But you will tell me, to detect sinne is to teach sinne, the discouery of vice like Hydras heads, doth rather increase then decrease the vitious, for vertue is seldome found to spring from Lacedemonian Tables, and chastity much lesse from Aretines pictures; that wicked persons, and wicked actions, should rather bee damn'd in obscuritie, then preserued for eternity, that it is a sinne against piety, to giue wickednesse any life of memory, for so the villaine became lost that set fire on Diana's Temple, and Manlius was forgot in Rome , that did iniury to Rome : wicked names dishonour fayre report, and if by compulsion the pen must glance vpon them, they ought euer to be accompanied with curses, and execrations; vnrepentant sinne is the Deuils Godsonne, and when we talke of capital wickednes, we ought to giue it no other name but deuill; Yet Brutus and his confederates are not forgot in Liuie; Sinon liues in Virgil , and Pandarus in Homer , we haue a Layis memorable in Corinth , a Lamia in Athens , and a Lestrigon in great Brittaine , why should we then loose this Eutopian Legend of Britanica Hollandia , who exceeds all in insolence, instructs all in impudence, and runnes through a World of damnable actions, with improuidence; no, as she is without parallel in her profession, so I wil striue to delineate her to the life, that she may euer liue hatefull to all after succession. In the Kingdome of Eutopia , nere the fayre citie of Maugsun , some fewe Leagues distant, their liued a Gentleman of indifferent Fortunes , neither so high that ambition did assaile him, nor so low that contempt might follow him; but Anchoring in a smooth low tyde, and a safe harbor, made himselfe content only with things necessary; he marryed a wife sutable to his estate, and agreeable with his affections, for shee had comelinesse enough to content an honest eye; cleanlines sufficient for a chast bed, or a frugall Table, and discretion at will to gouerne and dispose all things committed to her Steward-shippe;    [ Hollandia her birth. ] These had issue one daughter whom they named Britanica Hollandia , by reason of some neere allyances betwixt them and the Neather-lands . A mayd in the time of her innocence, and ignorance, so accomplished and accomodated with all the ornaments of Nature and education, that shee farre surpassed all those of her rancke, and might without the offence of modesty challenge equalitie with those which were accounted excellent; for shee had a fayre Eye; full of strong inchauntment; a modest cheeke, rich with bashfulnesse; and a face so generally clothed with beauty, & blushes, that there was an infinite promise of much ensuing vertue: her stature was but low, yet compos'd with such true Cymetrie, and so agreeable with euery other lineament through the whole Fabricke of her body, that had Appelles beheld her, he would haue forsworn his Idol to haue made her his goddesse ; but to leaue off all further circumstance, let it suffice me to say shee was truely handsome, exceeding hopefull, and had not the Deuill beene too ambitious, shee might have bin most happy, but where the house is cleanest, there Sathan desires to entersoonest; and if the guard of Grace be Idle or vnwatchfull, repentance may follow, but it cannot prevent surprizall, and so it fares with this Creature, for as heaven had bestowed vpon her all outward imbelishments to attract vertue vnto her, so had some sinister power, or the corruption of her owne flesh married to those bodily beauties, such a wicked spirit, that all goodnes became to her an vtter stranger; shee was of such a proud, haughty, and disdainfull nature, so Masculine in her disposition, and so mad to encounter any crosse to her best loued cogitations, that like the Spider, which turneth all things to poyson which it tasteth, so she became an vtter Athiest , and would acknowledge no God but her own pleasure; She had from mens prayses, womens envies, and her glasses plain- dealing, her parents tendernesse, her friends carefulnes, and her companions amazednesse, got such a true knowlege of her handsomnesse, that she did not onely beleeue it, and loue it, but mightily doated vpon it: neither did this foolishnesse of selfe-affection so bind her to the admiration of her owne beautie, as a proud and furious conceite of the excellency of her wit, (aboue the sphere of other womens capacities) did bind and slaue her to imbrace to her selfe this conclusion that she only was excellent. Now she begins to grow in hate with her fathers house, the Country is vnpleasant, vnhabitable, obscure and durtie, that house-wifely imployments, were slauish ingagements; to live with parents, was but to lye with bondage, that al commandements were curses, and obedience only a figure of simplicitie, and ignorance; shee would often say within her selfe, what is beautie, if not seene, what seene, if not admired, what admired, if not desired, and what any, or all if not enioyed; and where shall these bee gathered from the blossomes of trees, heaps of stones the ouerflowes of fountains, or the dul rabble of Clownes and heards-men? No, it is the City that is the spheare of beauty, there are her Temples, there live her votaries, and there burnes her sacrifice, the Countrie is but a rotten chest that conceales holy reliques, let me live in the Citie, where if I cannot out-shine all, or at least equall all, yet a tworst I shall be hidde in an handsome Cabinet. Vpon these, and the like resolutions she throws her-selfe into a deepe melancholie: all meates are but course for her dyet, shee forsakes them; sleepe is too neere a kinseman to death, she hates it; all company seemes rude, shee loathes it; all discourses are vnpollish't, her eare will not receiue them; and to conclude, as an exanimated carcasse, she walks with no soule, and but halfe a motion. Her parents quickly perceiue this alteration, and like noble Phisitians labor to find out the cause to make the cure more easie, more speedie, more certaine; but she that had a lockt vp soule in a sort impregnable, what through disdaine, the handmaid of Pride, & Pride it selfe the Lord of stubborne resolution, she became so impenitrable, that sooner might they bring the Poles together, then separate her from one tittle of her private resolution, so that finding her fixed, they leaue to molest her, onely obserue all occasions, and all circumstances, euery passage, and euery Action, that might give any light to those designes on which shee laboured with such difficultie; in the end, finding her set one day in a priuate Roome, without any companion, but solitude & her owne thoughts, her Father stealing within the distance of her speeches, might heare her vtter these wordes. O life, which hast deceiued so many, seduced so many, blinded so many, thou art nothing at thy beginning, thy light is nothing but a shaddow, thou art but smoake at thy height, thou art sweet to fooles, thou art bitter to the wise, who loueth thee, knowes thee not, who knoweth thee, contemnes thee ; and here with a deepe sigh shee made a full period, when her father pressing vpon her, demanded the cause of this quarrell betwixt her and life, vrging her with much ingratitude, to condemne that, from which her selfe had receiued so much luster, applying her beauty, her youth, her wit, and all her inward, and outward faculties, as vnrefellible arguments of infinite beholdingnesse to life, who had brought them into the World,  & made them beloued of the World; but she with a silent bashfulnesse (fuller of deceit then innocence) forbearing to reply gave him occasion to assaile her with all the strength that nature, loue, & a fathers authority could collect together, and did so vrge her to display, and lay open the Cabinet of her deerest counsells, that she either vnwilling to loose so faire an opportunity, or to apparel her envious griefe in the robes of obedience, with a seeming vnwilling willingnesse, did disburden her heart of that loade of griefe, which so long had afflicted her: yet not without many disguises, and false habits, as not being weary of the Countrey for it's solitude, but carefull to discharge him of much cost, and incumbrance; that the City was more hopefull for her aduancement, because the two columbes of posteritie, honorable Mariage, and wealthy imployment had there a setled residence, and threw away their fauors blindfold, like the children of Fortune . [  Her comming to the City. ] There did need small debatement, When both the parties did agree vpon one proposition, for he seemed to outrun her in willingnes, and as if their thoughts had bene cast in one mould, an equall diligence made preparation for her speedy departure, the mothers consent was not wanting, so that all drawing by one linke without hinderance, strife or aduantage, the work was in a trice effected, the daughter was brought to the City, and setled in an honest Magnificos seruice. Here, after the expence of some small time, liuing as it were in a Burse of resort, where men and their minds were continually trucking for new commodities, it was impossible for this rich Iewell, which was without foyle; because it knew no Art, and without fraud by reason of an innocent ignorance, should either stand gaping for a chap-man, or like an idle prentise, with his hands hid in his cap, cry, Sir, what lacke you ; No, vnsullied beauty like the Sunne will giue light to a whole Hemyspheare . and this damosell had so shot her beames through euery corner of the City, that her Suitors were like Coriscas smockes, infinite in number, many in good opinion, and but one at one time in imployment, yet with such seuerity she gouerned her passions, that the strictest eye of modesty could hardly detect her gouernment, and she was the rather induced to this Austerity, by beholding the pictures of two famous Curtezans , which did hang in her Masters Gallery ; the first, which vvas lesse faire, but more fortunate, had this inscription, Si non Caste tamen Caute , the other which vvas farre beyond all for beauty, and inferiour to none for Miserie , had vvritten ouer her. Nec caste, Nec caute , on these two plaine songs her resolution made sundry descants, but the close of euery strain was, That to sinne wisely, was to sinne safely, that after- thoughts vvere foolish, and had I wist childish; hence it came that amogst the vn-numbred number of her Suitors, she chose one whom shee knevv honest,    [ Her marriage. ] by all mens report, frugall in her owne experience, industrious in his affaires, and painefull in euery circumstance of his profession, one that was handsome enough to loue, and stout enough to controle, yet such an Idolater to her beauty, & such a slave to her commandements, that neither his eyes, nor eares could carry credit beyond her sufferance; of this man she made a husband, and had not the deuill and womans vveakenesse conspir'd to make ship vvracke of her vertue, they might have liued and dyed vvith faire reputation; but novv shee shakes handes vvith bashfulnes, and feare, & the manlinesse of her courage,   [  Her falling from vertue. ] meeting vvith the libertie of a bold wives rudenes, she dare both intice and lend an eare to inticements. 'Tis true, that loue in her friends, made them call impudence an high spirit, and losenesse a pleasant behauiour, but those which had beene brought vp in the same schoole where shee learnt her complement, knew that the gate was wide enough, and the way plaine enough which leade to the ruine of her vertue. [  Her subtiltie. ] Many assault were giuen to this faire Fort, but some she with-stood, to gaine an opinion of goodnesse, and they were great ones; some she durst not entertaine for feare of after repentance, and they were loose ones, some she held at a distance to draw on benefit, and they were the rich ones, and some she scorn'd, and they were fooles, Fidlers, or base ones: But behold, at last, the deuill himselfe fearing to lose so rich a prize, which hee knew would not come to his kingdome alone with her owne lading, but with the spoyles, and triumphs of a world of vnfortunate creatures of both sexes, he sent to assaile her one Ignatius a Puritane Iesuite ;    [  The first that made her a whore. ] a fellow, whom Lucifer had so instructed, and adorned with all the deceiuable qualities and inchauntments of a seeming goodnesse, that vertue herselfe could hardly have discouered him, without the vse of her diuinest spectacles; he had al the amiablenesses of a good face, and a well-shap'd body, which he made more glorious with grauity  & good cloathes, he had an excellent wit, prompt and ready, which he witnessed in his discourses, being full of delight and learning, he was full of Bounty , and liberalitie ; a world of poore deceiued people (especially women) maintaining his exchequor, and when the fire of lust was kindled in him by the deuils bellowes, he was so full of delicate Petulance , and inchaunting dallyance, that a cold halfe buried Anchorite would haue ingendred a flame from his embers. This great General for Hel (not alone in this, but in a world of other damnable actions) com's with his Legions of inchantments to besiege this Redoute , or weake Sconce , euen at the time when there was a mutynie raised betwixt her and her best souldiers; for indeed, Modestie was in disgrace, and accus'd for a Coward, Chastity was scorn'd as a shaddow  & no substance, Bashfulnesse was reputed weake and childish, Honour a Chimera, Good-fame a dreame; and indeed, all the Vertues stood cashired as enemies vnto Pleasure ; so that there was left none to withstand him but Frailtie , a Cannon-law , and a Penall Statute . Against these hee rais'd such a battery of sweet discourse, and inchanting perswasions, that she stood amazed, and staggering at the first on-set, till feare of the Law , and a little loue to good report , stept betwixt her and the enemy, and beat him backe with these, or the like arguments. First, that her Reputation (not God or his Iudgements) were so deare and tender vnto her, that she durst not give eare to his sorceries: but he with a smile (wherein a good eye might haue discerned scorne) asked her what Reputation was; She told him it was the very Manna , and Nepenthe of generous Spirits , the Goddesse of great courages, and the triumph of all Noble Actions ; she sayd it was a thing so delicate, so pure, and so vnspotted, that the least excesse did blemish it, any vniust action dishonour it, indiscretion, negligence or Idlenesse deface it, but Prostitution that did wholly ruine it; it is a constant friend that will follow and go with any good action , but if once forsaken, no inquisition , no search, no prayers, or teares, can euer againe find it: Beleeve it Sir, (said she) there is no such misery as to out-live Reputation , nor any follies like that vvhich puts it in hazard. But he, to whom Blasphemy was familiar,  & Atheistical propositions more frequent, then holy sentences, had soone brought her to a Non-plus ; so that forsaking her guardians, she vvas content to hearken to composition. This capitulation assuring him of future conquest, he now began to sing his owne triumph; and to make his conditions more glorious, the assurance of her affections more serious, and his laciuious pleasures, of a long liv'd indurance, he began to discourse vnto her the liues & Legends, (but not the deaths and disasters) of divers famous and renowned Courtezans ;    [   The tale of Loloca Paulina .   ] but especially aboue all the rest, and as a History best agreeing, and paralelling with her owne Fortunes, as also seeking to couer his owne luxurious wickednes, and the wickednesse of his owne coate and calling, vnder a greater mans wantonnesse, he insisted most vpon the life and fortunes of Lollea Paulina , the greatest Courtezan , the basest Whore , and the deceitfullest Bawds , that euer Rome did acknowledge; But here you must vnderstand, that this subtile Enginer , playd but the flattering Historian , for he only toucht at her felicities, but either forgot, or leapt ouer her infintie miseries; he shewed how she was borne in the City of Fano   [  Rome. ] in Italie , of good, but poore parentage: how after her Fathers death, necessitty brought her to seeke shelter; being accompanied with nothing but a diuine beauty, an vnmatchable personage, a boundlesse wit, and an infinite spirit. Here Hipolito the great Cardinall of Est , and brother to the Duke of Ferara , beholding her, grew enamored on her, bought her at an infinite price, and maintained her aboue the ranck of the greatest Princes: Insomuch that at an enterview of Ambassadors, before the Pope , in Mounte Angelo (being by torchlight) she came amongst the Ladies so couered, and ouer-couered with Dyamonds, and the richest Iewelry, that excepting her face, (which the Sun it selfe was not able to darken) there could nothing be discerned but a mouing flame of most glorious fire; and those which had skill did value her at more then a Million . It is not to be exprest with what greedines of spirit, and earnest delight, Britanica's eares drunke in this Story, for she was infinitly couetous; not as Misers to cram her chests, but as a discreete Prodigall to fill her pockets, placing her delight in giuing, and spending, Ryot, Reuels, Playes, Feasts , and all manner of wastful delights , were to her such deare companions, that rather then loose them, she would lay both life and soule in pawne for their ransome; nay, she was such a true admirer of pleasure, that albe shee knew there was no true pleasure vpon earth, and that only Griefe Went vp  & downe, couered in pleasures out-side, yet was her soule so rauisht with delight, that she became dead flesh, and would not feele vexation as long as her eyes stood fixt on Pleasures garments . This Ignatius saw, this he knew, and finding her Spirits take fire at his words, he againe pursued his Story , and shewed her how Paulina hauing nothing but the reuenue of Lustre , a little beautie, was three times the richest, the greatest and the most respected Lady of all Rome ; and here he paus'd, for had he followed the truth of the Story , it would have shewed him that she was three times also the poorest, the most deiected  & basest, miserable, despised creature that Rome , or the world had euer reserued for memory: nay, so exceeding hatefull was her condition ,  & so infinite her contempt , that she gaue her body in prostitution to the common hang-man, for one meale to sustaine her; aud in the end dyed without pitty, and was buried without Ceremonie , had he amplified any thing vpon this Text, he had mar'd his owne market, and made a Conuertite : But they were vvhites beyond his Ayme; confusion was only within the reach of his Arrow, and that he hit, for his wordes did so vvell please her, and his rich promises so assure her, that freely she gaue him her body in possession; and he inioyed her for some short space, vvithout competitor. But Lust is a Gangrene ,  & hauing once poisoned a member,   [  Her multiplicity of prostitutions. ] neuer leaues spreading till the vvhole body be cofounded, she hath now broken one linke in the golden chaine of Chastity , and she cares not though all the rest be molten with confusion; hence it com's that she entertaines more deuils, variety is pleasant, one ship yelds small custome, great Nauies fil large Treasures,  & her reuenues came in with such full Tydes, that false Pleasure made her beleeue there would neuer come ebbing . In this vnchast Progresse , she took an essay or tast of all degrees , all professions , and all conditions , from the Noble , to the Gentile , from the Camp to the City , her eares had heard al languages, her purse had receiued all Coynes , and had not her fortune bin more fauourable then her affections, her body had bin confounded with all manner of putrifactions. [  She determines to turne Bawd ] But in the end, looking back into her selfe, and beholding into what a crasie and rotten Barke she had shipt her selfe, on a rough and tempestuous Sea , where infinit diseases lay gaping vpon her, the torrour of the lawes ready to deuoure her, shame and beggerie striuing to ouertake her, and lastly the cursse of all curses , to make her last will on a dunghill, or at the best in a Spittle , this did so perplexe her, that being cloyd with saciety, and sin as weary of her, as she was weary of sinning, she began to turne ouer the leafe of her wickednesse, and though she had no thought of amendment, yet she wil take a new course for the safety of her health and person. She will no more be a Layis , but a Lena , no more a bewitching Whore , but a deceiuing Bawd , the Sinnes of others shall maintaine her Sinne , she will no more trust her-selfe on the Surges , but wil traffique by Factours , and according to the wealth of her Wares , so shalbe the encrease or decrease of her Reuenues . She had no sooner setled her selfe in this resolution, and sealed it before Hell and her owne evill Conscience , but presently she puts it in execution, and that she might frame all accomodations sutable to her deseign; she lookes forth for a better house, for her owne wanted elbow roome, she must haue many Meanders , and many passages, many holes, and many hides, deedes of darkenesse doe euer require many darke corners. At last she lights vpon an old ruined Castell newly repaired , so commodiously placed both for her home-bred customers and Forreine visitants, as well for the Hawke , or Buzzard , that Flyes by day, as the Owle , or Bat , that flutters in the night, that her heart could not wish a place of better convenience; The Sea on one side did beate against the walles, and both tall Shippes, Flye-boates , and Pinnaces , might there Anchor in a safe Harbour; on the other side, it had some sleight intrenchments, which albe they were but weake and assayleable, yet the Sea vpon all assaults, did grant her both Munition, victual , and avoydance . And that a good Name might patronize her many euill actions , she caused it to bee called by a good old Dukes Title .    [   As we say Dukes place Duke Humfrey , or the like.   ] Of this house by contract, she got possession, and her purse being well filled, and wide open, emptied it selfe to giue it adorment, there wanted nothing for State , nothing for Magnificence , nothing for Delight , nothing for Beauty , nothing for Necessity , howsoeuer the bones that lodg'd in it were rotten and vnwholsome, yet the Monument it selfe was wondrous Gaudie , and hansome; there was nothing now for her to search for, but liuing furniture , and that she diuided into three stations . [  A Bawdes furniture. ] The first, a stout Ruffian to guard her, the second, lustie strong Queans , to supply offices, and the third, petulant painted, and halfe guilt Mimicks , to giue entertainment; The first of these shee saued from the Gallowes , the second she hired from the Stews , and the last, she had bought vp by whole sale from the Countrey : there needed not much search, sin is found in euery corner, and these creatures like troublesome water-men plying a rich fare, will thrust themselues into the deuills armes beyond hope, beyond redemption. [  With whom she trades. ] There was not a Carrier that had a crackt piece, but she had coyne to exchange it, there was not a Poulterer , that brought vp a yong or tender pullet , but it was bought for her dyet, she had charmes to intice the simple , money to bewitch the needy, rich clothes to adorne proud spirits , ease for Idlenesse , pleasure for wantons , and indeed any thing, or all things to keepe her Common-wealth from falling. Being thus accommodated, and her Mart proclaimed, there was no doubt of customers, euery man hath a penny for a new Tauerne , and euery Letcher hath a Dollor for a renowned Brothell , and then this , there was none so famous; and her visitants came flocking so fast for entertainment, that her Kitchin was like Æ tna , euer flaming, her Hall was like Augeus stable, euer stinking with broken meate, and Mary-bones , her dining-roome , was like Babell , a mixture of nothing but confused noyses, and her inward and priuate Lodgings , like Hell it selfe, where wicked creatures lay bathing themselues in Lust , as the damned soules doe in Sulphur , thus she continued her ryot for a long season, boasting her-selfe in the strength of her wickednesse, and not grieuing for any thing more, then that she could bee no more wicked. [  Her sinnes calling in question. ] But there are Iudgements Registred aboue, and shame and disgraces preserued belowe, and when either the one, or the other falls, Woe to the offender ; Iudgment may forbeare, and Iustice may sleepe, but neither will pardon, it is only to rayse the Arme higher, that the Thunder may fall with greater furie; And now the noyse of these offences haue awakened Authority and that ioyning with piety, both send forth their Ministers to apprehend her; At first she playes the Rebell, and withstands their Summons, but finding her selfe at last inuyroned on all sides, and that neither Sea , nor Land , affoorded her safety, how-euer vnwilling, yet with a seeming willingnesse, she yeelded vp her-selfe and her retinue, into the hands of Mercie ; From thence they were brought to the barre of Iustice, where her Ruffian was perpetually condemned to labour at the Hempe-beetle ;    [  A place like our houses of correction. ] The rest whom she had seduced, were sent foreuer to the house of Repentant Strumpets ,    [   A place like Bride-well .   ] only her selfe, who was the chiefe author and framer of all this Iniquitie , she was sent to the loathsome dungeon of Capitoll offenders ,    [  A place, like Newgate. ] there to remaine till her cause were heard, and due punishment put in execution. [  Her carriage in prison. ] All this as it was decreed, so it was performed, and each one went to their seuerall place of sadnesse , but Britanica , who although shee ranne in a superlatiue way of wickednesse, yet did she not want friends, neither was shee without her dayly visitants, for there is a correspondencie amongst the worst, and wicked ones are sayd euer to hold together. She had Counsailes of all manner of creatures, Quirks to avoid Statutes, Quillets to defraud Iudgements , and Demurres to protract and put off the dayes of her Tryall ; Shee wanted no Suitors to pleade for compassion, no aduocate to blanch her offences, and make her blacke sinnes white ones, there did need no teares , she commanded more Crocodils then Nilus , and for bribes , her Coffers were full, and she was willing to vnloade them: But all these and a World of others, being bound vp together in a Bundle , and put in the scale against her intollerable mischiefes, were so light and vnvaluable, that but dispaire and disgrace she could find no comforters; Finding her selfe thus hard beset, she now begins to call vnto her the strength of a womans wit, and concludes in her selfe, that as the Serpent deceiued the first woman with his flattery, so he may (for amends) giue her some reliefe with his subtilty, and indeed her cause was so foule, that there was no hope but in stratagem , and to that course she onely now bends her study , and in this sort she effects it. [  Her escape from prison. ] Some few dayes before her tryall, there came to visit her a Gentleman of very grave and portly carriage, one that had in his looks and behauiour, both reuerence and Authority, hee salutes her by the name of Neece , and she with low humilitie, and a riuer of well coind teares, blushing that shee could not blush faster, returnes his Salutations, with the name of an Vnckle , she casts downe her countenance as ashamed to looke vpon him, he giues her comfort, but so mixt with seuere and bitter counsell, that the standers by might perceiue he came neither to flatter nor deiect her; these complements finished, they fell to priuate discourses; those ended, according to the custome of those places, and the vse of such visitants, he calls for Beere , for Ale , for Wine , and a World of other Iunkets , there is no spare of cost, his gold flies, the Keeper carouses, his seruants supplie things wanting, and no man neere them, but hath busie imployment. After this conflict ended, and the Gentleman preparing for his departure, he bestowed vpon the Keeper , a Ring of pretty valew, vpon his seruants Gold , and on the poorer sort of prisoners a Bountifull Larges , descending downe the staires he offers to take his leaue of his Neece , but she will attend him as farre as the limits of the house vvill giue her sufferance, and so shee brings him downe to the lowest hall, then offering to leaue him, hee told the Keeper how sorry hee was to depart with drye lippes, and calling to mind a Tauerne that stood at the next doore, he woes the Keeper there, by all meanes, to take another Pottle . The Keeper is willing to attend him, and why (quoth the Gentleman ) may not my Neece take share with vs? for mine owne part, I know not her Trespasse , therefore I dare not vrge vnlawfull fauour. Sir, (quoth the Keeper ) her offence is neither Fellony , nor Treason , shee is neither lyable to Bond , nor Execution , and therefore my selfe will bee her Guardian , and shee shall waite vpon you; and so together they goe all three to the Tauerne ; the Vncle calls for Pottle vpon Pottle , the Neece fills bowle vpon bowle, and the Keeper drinkes them vp as if his thirst could never be quenched; In the midst of these quaffings, the Keeper and the Vncle , fall into a discourse of such seriousnesse, that they neglected all things but their owne speeches; Britanica taking aduantage at this Obliuion , rises from the Table, and as if the Wine had stird in her some Office of secret occasion, steales out of doores, and knowing that at the very entrance of the backe doore, stoode a Monasterie of Gray Fryers, looking backe, and seeing her Argus more and more inchaunted with Mercurie , like light Salmacis hauing her heeles at libertie, away she runs, and finding the doore of the Monasterie open, like a poore affrighted Doue , shotte from the Talents of an eager Faulcon , In she enters for safety; to the first Brother she meets, shee falls vpon her knees, and hauing taught her eyes to weepe at her owne pleasure, shee deliuers him so pitifull a story of her misfortune, that had he bin as cold as his profession, yet it would haue mooued in him a Flame of infinite Compassion , hee takes her vp, and beeing, as all his Order are, faithfull and helpefull to womens afflictions, hee promises her all reliefe, all safetie, which done, hee conueies her through the darke corners, and intricate passages of their cloyster, whether he shewed her his owne Cell or no, it is vncertaine; But it is an apparant trueth, that he neuer forsooke her, till hee had placed her in that safety, which her selfe desired. By this time her Vncle and the Keeper hauing tyred themselues with needlesse complements, began to giue their tongues a little ease, that their eyes might with more liberty looke about them. The Vncle perceiuing that his worke was effected, faynes occasion of hastie departure. The Keeper supposing his prisoner had beene with the Mistris of the house, conducteth him to the doore, and there shakes handes till their next meeting; then calling for his Charge , he findes that she is vtterly missing; it is vaine to trouble your eares with the Keepers amazement, his furie, his fretting, and his inquisition, let it suffice shee is gone; her escape is knowne, the Monastery stands vpon Priuiledge, and had the Keeper all the charmes of Medea , or Circes , they were too weake to open one boult in those places. Britanica being thus escaped, and by the helpe of her Confessour , brought to the place of her owne safetie, she there lyes hid like the Minataure in the Laborinth , yet howeuer her body lay concealed, her mind was full of Action, and busie molestation, and now shee sets all her Emmets , and labouring acquaintance on worke to sue, if not for a pardon, yet at least for some faire composition; and hauing the experience of former occasions, shee knew there was no way so safe or speedy as that of Bribes , therefore like a prodigall she casts away her wealth, and would not suffer any man to bee imployed for her, but his pockets were fild with gold by her; In the end her Proiect prooued prosperous, and vpon strong Securitie of a new life to come, and a true Repentance for Crimes past, her peace was made, but yet at so deare and high prized conditions, that looking into that infinite wealth, of which but little before shee stood possest, shee now found her selfe scarse able to subsist or to bestow one good Meale vppon her Belly . [  Her miseries. ] There was not a Curse , an affliction , a Plague , or what else is more bitter, that euer was foretolde, or predestinate to a Strumpet , but she had her share thereof in a downe-pressed and ouerflowing measure; shee saw her kindred loathe her, her Friends forsake her, her Companions mocke her, her Slaues commaund her, and which is an Hell aboue all other, none but her enemies to pittie her. [  A new falling. ] These afflictions, euery one thought to bee Adamants , powerfull enough to draw her Soule to heauenly Meditations ; But the effect proued quite conry, for she euer carried the Deuils Balme in her Bosome , and could annoint ouer euery disaster of Fortune , with, what will be shall be; She had got this Adage , in her mouth, Things past cure, past care , and whether it were Enuie , or Furie , or both, shee became so desperate, that shee cared not to trust her selfe in the Seas , on a hurdle. After some small time thus spent in languishment, looking at no marke, but the old one, (for she could with the least trouble hit it) shee labours all her Spirits , all her Imaginations , puts her Friends, Flatterers , and Companions , to the Test , leaues no way or meanes vnassayed, how shee might aduaunce and set vp againe her old occupation; shee hath framed to her selfe, new lawes of seuerer condition, shee will haue Taxes of a higher, and more profitable Nature , shee will haue Ryot clothed in Frugalities shaddow , her Wine , though more in Measure , yet shall be drunke in lesse Glasses ; her Musique shall speake sharply, and sweetly, but not loud; her Wenches shall be faire and handsome, yet but few in number; for when Supplies are wanting, shee knowes how to fetch them from places of fayre Reputation ; her Ordinary seruants, shal be comely and industrious, and when extremity comes vpon her, shee will haue disguises to make them appeare halfe Angels ; In briefe, her old Common-wealth shall bee turned topsieturvie, and this new one, made so strong and permanent, that it shall be to all the Impudent creatures of the earth, an everlasting president. Vpon these Resolutions , shee thought her worke was halfe finished, till looking better into her designe, she found the Base and ground worke whereon shee was to build the foundation of her proceedings, was yet to find out, and vtterly beyond both her reach and compasse, and that was a convenient house; shee will no more trust Old Ruines , or Religious Neighbors , the one will endure no Batterie , the other will abide no Badde dealing ; Shee will haue a house of Strength , a Fort , a Bulwarke , a place so impregnable , that when all shall bee vanquisht, it shall stand in defiance; and that she might attaine such a safetie, she ranges through euery part, and promising place of the Citty , but all in vaine, those buildings are so linkt one to another, that all are to be surprised; She then survayes the Suburbes , but findes none to content her; at last she betakes her selfe to the Sea , and makes a discouery vpon the water; there shee findes many Rockes , many Islands ; to which, Nature had lent much Strength , but Art must bee imployed, and that was too costly; halfe tyred with her search, and thinking to returne, she is informed of a place fit for her purpose,    [  Like the Banck side. ] beeing wonderous commodiously planted for all accomodations; it was out of the Citie , yet in the view of the Citie , only divided by a delicate Riuer , there was many handsome buildings, and many hearty neighbours, yet at the first foundation, it was renowned for nothing so much as for the memory of that famous Amazon, Longa Margarita , who had there for many yeeres kept a famous infamous house of open Hospitality . Shee no sooner heard this report but presently turning her Sailes, shee made for that coast, where shee found such aboundance of Naturall and Arteficiall intrenchments , that euer the house seemed to be in it selfe a little City . [  The site of her house ] Heere shee enquires, what strong holde , or Fort , was to bee let for yeerely Reuenue, and presently shee was brought to a Fort, Citadell , or Mansion House , so fortified, and invyroned with all manner of Fortifications , that had Impregnable Rhodes taken thence it's patterne, neither the Turkes wealth, nor the Traytors wit could euer haue betrayed it, for e're any Foe could approach this, hee must march more then a Musket-shot , on a narrow Banke , (where three could not goe on Brest) betwixt two dangerous ditches; then enter a Port, bulwarked on euery side, and crosse immured both before and behinde, with deepe ditches, a Draw- bridge , and sundry Pallysadoes , then another passage, in all poynts like the former, Sluced with ditches, and Baracadoed with strong Rampiers . Then another ditch of of much larger continent then any before spoke of, which ranne like a circumference, and girded in it's Armes all the whole Mansion , then a World of other Bulwarkes, Riuers; Ditches, Trenches , and Outworkes , which hem'd in the Orchards, Gardens, Base-courts , and Inferiour Offices , making euery one capable of a seuerall fight, and euery fight able for many houres to play with an Armie ; when shee had taken a full survay of this Forcelet , and seene how commodious and fit it was for her purpose, shee then inquires what other benefits were appertaining vnto it, as Neighbour-hood, pleasant walks, Concourse of Strangers, and things of like Nature, in all which she receiued a full satisfaction; especially, and aboue all the rest, she was most taken with the report of three famous Amphytheators , which stood so neere scituated, that her eye might take view of them from her lowest Tarret , one was the Continent of the World , because halfe the yeere a World of Beauties , and braue Spirits resorted vnto it; the other was a building of excellent Hope , and though wild beasts and Gladiators , did most possesse it, yet the Gallants that came to behold those combats, though they were of a mixt Society, yet were many Noble worthies amongst them; the last which stood, and as it were shak'd handes with this Fortresse, beeing in times pasts, as famous as any of the other, was now fallen to decay, and like a dying Swanne , hanging downe her head, seemed to sing her owne dierge; With these reports, Dona Hollandia was rauisht beyond measure, so that fearing to loose the instant opportunitie without further debatement, she presently stroke vp the Bargaine , possession is giuen, the Keyes deliuered, and when she please she may enter. [  Her new preparations. ] After these proceedings, shee returned home to prepare Men, and Munition for defence, Wenches for vse, and victuall for mainteinance, as for houshold Ornaments, those shee intended to increase, according to the strength of her Coffers . Her desires were so great, that her haste in the execution could not bee little, shee will not loose a minute, but (according to the old saying) running from post to piller, and making Hay in the Sunne-shine, shee fore-slowes no occasion, till she haue all things fit for her new worke; which obtained, she imbarkes her selfe, and makes for her wished harbour, where in a little space of time shee landed with one Ruffian , whose name was Cerberus , and rightly, for he was monstrous both in shape and condition, and to him shee gaue charge of the gate, the Draw- bridge and Percullis , she had foure wantons, the first Beta Breslonia , a huge Bona-Roba , one impudent aboue measure, and insolent beyond comparison; the next Eliza Caunce , for by chance her father got her, by chance he forsooke her, by chance shee turned Whore , and by chance this Bawd light vpon her, she was yong, little but a wondrous wanton, she had a white skin  & a wel shapt foot, only her haire was Corral , but couered with a white Periwig , the third was Longa Maria , a wench of a good handsome carriage, not so Rampant as the rest, not so rude in behauiour, but being seasoned with better education, she could boast of some good parts, for she had a good voyce, and could touch the Vyoll; the last was Maria Petit , a small handfull of woman, yet pleasant and witty she was all Motion, and Action, nothing was more irkesome to her then sleepe and silence, for by her will shee would be euer dancing, or singing; She had three houshold Officers, a Cooke -wench, a Laundrey-lasse , and a Girle Scullian. Beeing thus landed with this Luggage, shee presently placed euery one in their true equipage, gaue them their seuerall charges, read them the Lawes, and Ordinances of the house, Proclaiming a strickt penalty for the breach of euery condition; this done, shee hangs foorth her Flagge for custome, Proclaimes her preparations, and invites all the world to a generall entertainement. Did you euer see Eagles prey on dead carcasses, Crowes feede vpon carrion, or hungry dogges deuouring filthie intrailes, in double that aboundance, came creatures of all qualities to be vndone by her, only the empty purse was expulsed, and could get no admittance, nay a reasonable stocke many times perished in the mid-way, and could not get to the end of his purpose, her Taxes and customes were so many, and so mighty: for Cerberus at the first port had a double impost, one for the gate, another for the Draw-bridge , the houshold officers had Fees for the Hall, for the dining-roome, and the withdrawing chamber, the rest which were peculiar to the Bawd her selfe, report hath affirmed they are sans number: thus euery day came some tall Ships, some Fly-boats , some Caruils , and some Frigots , wealthily laden, but at their returne, they had not so much as Ballast, but came forth poore and emptie. All her entertainments had a Protean condition, full of variety and changes, and shee would euer suite them to the nature of him that was entertained; if hee were of worth and respect, hee was respectiuely vsed, if otherwise, besides the expence of his coyne, his clothes were forfaited for his rude behauiour,  & diuers haue bin seene to returne from thence, both day and night halfe naked. [  Her new wealth ] These mil-dewes could not chuse but breed her an infinite world of hony, and true it is, that her baggs were so many, and so massy, that she had scarce chests enowe to containe them, this wealth made her proud, and pride taught her to be curious, she will not now liue at so low a rate as she hath done, but as shee hath plenty of meanes, so she will have plenty of attendants, and hereupon presently shee contracts and hyres sundry retayners; as first, a Surgeon that tooke care of her Spittle , then a Tyre-woman of Phantasticall Ornaments, a Sempster for Ruffes, Cuffes, Smocks, and wast-coates, and a Taylor for cloathes, of all shapes, and all fashions, and these haue confest their liuings only to come from her Coffers. [  The cause of new vprore. ] But this Sunne-shine must not bee without some clouds, for now the crue of those Queanes whom she hath cast off, and consumed, the accusations of those whom she had robbed, and reuiled, and the detestable enormities which spring from such wicked examples, come all with one voyce before the throne of Iustice , appealing for satisfaction; The plaint is receiued, approued and pittied, and presently potentes sent out for her apprehension, and the razing downe of her Castell [  She is besieged. ] A corporall is forthwith chosen, and a stoute band of Halberders and Bil-men ,    [  A Corporall in war is a Constable of peace. ] sent to beleaguer this fortres; she stands vpon her guard, hangs out a Flagge of defiance, and bids them enter at their peril; They which had a double Armor a good cause, and lawful authority, scorning to be out-braued, prepare for an assault, she on the other side with her man deuill,  & her she furies, stand to receiue them, and to make her triumph more glorious, she sets ope the gate, puts downe the Bridge , and drawes vp her Percullis , the enemy brauely enters, and comming on in good order, they were no sooner on the Bridge , and had fil'd it from one end to the other, but by a secret deuice which shee concealed, downe fell the Bridge , and the Corporall and his souldiers were halfe drowned in the water; where, to see how they lay plunged in mud and myre, how one to helpe another, became worse and worse incumbred, but aboue all, to heare her scoffes, her Whores taunts, and her dogs reuilings, and recount them, would make a Tracte double this volume, to tell the difficulty of their escape, their tedious and durty passage to safety, what shame they felt in themselues, and what mocks they receiued from others, would be pleasant to fooles, but in wisemen it would stirre vp anger. [  The continuance of the Leaguer. ] The Corporall complaines of this defeate, but yet still continues the Leaguer, when presently a Prouost   [ A Prouost is called Prouost Marshall. ] is sent with new supplyes to assist him, but shee is as carelesse of him, as of the other, drawes him into as great daungers, and derides him past sufferance, past measure, dayly new forces come to their ayd, but all in vaine, they dare not assault her, she is held halfe immortall, and it is thought of her enemies, (that were they surviuing) she was able to encounter with Bradamant, Marphysa , and Clardana ; To conclude, they dare no more assault her, but with a continuall Leaguer , meane to tyre her out, or famish her, how things will proceed, is vncertaine, only it is supposed, that if this Leaguer last not so long as Troy , yet it will far exceed Ostende in continuance, and so in this martiall businesse, I must leaue her, concluding her
