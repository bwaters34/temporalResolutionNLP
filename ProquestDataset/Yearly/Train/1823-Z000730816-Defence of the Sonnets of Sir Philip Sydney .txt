 No more, my dear, no more these counsels try; O give my passions leave to run their race; Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace; Let folk, o'er-charged with brain, against me cry. Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye; Let me no steps, but of lost labour, trace; Let all the earth with scorn recount my case--- But do not will me from my love to fly. I do not envy Aristotle's wit, Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame; Nor aught do care, though some above me sit; Nor hope, nor wish, another course to frame, But that which once may win thy cruel heart, Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art. School'd only by his mother's tender eye; What wonder then, if he his lesson miss, When for so soft a rod dear play he try? And yet my Star , because a sugar'd kiss In sport I suck'd, while she asleep did lie, Doth lour, nay chide, nay threat, for only this. Sweet, it was saucy Love , not humble I. But no 'scuse serves; she makes her wrath appear In beauty's throne---see now, who dares come near Those scarlet judges, threat'ning bloody pain? O heav'nly Fool, thy most-kiss-worthy face Anger invests with such a lovely grace, That anger's self I needs must kiss again. I never drank of Aganippe well, Nor ever did in shade of Tempe sit, And Muses scorn with vulgar brains to dwell; Poor lay-man I, for sacred rites unfit. Some do I hear of Poets' fury tell, But (God wot) wot not what they mean by it; And this I swear by blackest brook of hell, I am no pick-purse of another's wit. How falls it then, that with so smooth an ease My thoughts I speak, and what I speak doth flow In verse, and that my verse best wits doth please? Guess we the cause---what is it thus?---fye, no. Or so?---much less. How then? sure thus it is, My lips are sweet, inspired with Stella 's kiss. Of all the kings that ever here did reign, Edward, named Fourth, as first in praise I name, Not for his fair outside, nor well-lined brain--- Although less gifts imp feathers oft on Fame. Nor that he could, young-wise, wise-valiant, frame His sire's revenge, join'd with a kingdom's gain; And, gain'd by Mars, could yet mad Mars so tame, That Balance weigh'd what Sword did late obtain. Nor that he made the Floure-de-luce so 'fraid, Though strongly hedged of bloody Lion's paws, That witty Lewis to him a tribute paid. Nor this, nor that, nor any such small cause--- But only, for this worthy knight durst prove To lose his crown rather than fail his love. O happy Thames, that didst my Stella bear, I saw thyself, with many a smiling line Upon thy cheerful face, Joy's livery wear, While those fair planets on thy streams did shine; The boat for joy could not to dance forbear; While wanton winds, with beauty so divine Ravish'd, stay'd not, till in her golden hair They did themselves (O sweetest prison) twine. And fain those Ã†ol's youth there would their stay Have made; but, forced by nature still to fly, First did with puffing kiss those locks display. She, so disshevel'd, blush'd; from window I With sight thereof cried out, O fair disgrace, Let honour's self to thee grant highest place! Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be; And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet, Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet, More soft than to a chamber melody,--- Now, blessed You, bear onward blessed Me To Her, where I my heart safe left shall meet, My Muse and I must you of duty greet With thanks and wishes, wishing thankfully. Be you still fair, honour'd by public heed, By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time forgot; Nor blamed for blood, nor shamed for sinful deed. And that you know, I envy you no lot Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss, Hundreds of years you Stella 's feet may kiss. Of the foregoing, the 1st, the 2d, and the last sonnet, are my favourites. But the general beauty of them all is, that they are so perfectly characteristical. The spirit of "learning and of chivalry,"---of which union, Spenser has entitled Sydney to have been the "president," --- shines through them. I confess I can see nothing of the "jejune" or "frigid" in them; much less of the "stiff" and "cumbrous"---which I have sometimes heard objected to the Arcadia. The verse runs off swiftly and gallantly. It might have been tuned to the trumpet; or tempered (as himself expresses it) to "trampling horses' feet." They abound in felicitous phrases--- O heav'nly Fool, thy most kiss-worthy face--- 8th Sonnet . \---Sweet pillows, sweetest bed, A chamber deaf to noise, and blind to light, A rosy garland, and a weary head. 2d Sonnet . \---That sweet enemy---France--- 5th Sonnet . But they are not rich in words only, in vague and unlocalised feelings--- the failing too much of some poetry of the present day---they are full, material, and circumstantiated. Time and place appropriates every one of them. It is not a fever of passion wasting itself upon a thin diet of dainty words,  2 I have dwelt the longer upon what I conceive the merit of these poems, because I have been hurt by the wantonness (I wish I could treat it by a gentler name) with which a favourite critic of our day takes every occasion of insulting the memory of Sir Philip Sydney. But the decisions of the Author of Table Talk, &c. (most profound and subtle where they are, as for the most part, just) are more safely to be relied upon, on subjects and authors he has a partiality for, than on such as he has conceived an accidental prejudice against. Milton wrote Sonnets, and was a king-hater; and it was congenial perhaps to sacrifice a courtier to a patriot. But I was unwilling to lose a fine idea from my mind. The noble images, passions, sentiments, and poetical delicacies of character, scattered all over the Arcadia (spite of some stiffness and encumberment), justify to me the character which his contemporaries have left us of the writer. I cannot think with Mr. Hazlitt that Sir Philip Sydney was that opprobrious thing , which a foolish nobleman in his insolent hostility chose to term him. I call to mind the epitaph of Lord Brooke, to guide me to juster thoughts of him; and I repose upon the beautiful lines in the "Friend's Passion for his Astrophel," printed with the Elegies of Spenser and others. You knew---who knew not Astrophel? (That I should live to say I knew, And have not in possession still!)--- Things known permit me to renew--- Of him you know his merit such, I cannot say---you hear---too much. Within these woods of Arcady He chief delight and pleasure took; And on the mountain Partheny, Upon the chrystal liquid brook, The Muses met him every day, That taught him sing, to write, and say. When he descended down the mount, His personage seemed most divine; A thousand graces one might count Upon his lovely chearful eyne. To hear him speak, and sweetly smile, You were in Paradise the while. A sweet attractive kind of grace; A full assurance given by looks; Continual comfort in a face , The lineaments of Gospel books \--- I trow that count'nance cannot lye, Whose thoughts are legible in the eye. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Above all others this is he, Which erst approved in his song, That love and honour might agree, And that pure love will do no wrong. Sweet saints, it is no sin or blame To love a man of virtuous name. Did never Love so sweetly breathe In any mortal breast before: Did never Muse inspire beneath A Poet's brain with finer store: He wrote of Love with high conceit, And Beauty rear'd above her height. Or let any one read the deeper sorrows (grief running into rage) in the Poem, ---the last in the collection accompanying the above,---which from internal testimony I believe to be Lord Brooke's,---beginning with "Silence augmenteth grief,"---and then seriously ask himself, whether the subject of such absorbing and confounding regrets could have been that thing which Lord Oxford termed him.
