 or coresie to his heart, but , To sell all and follow Christ, this was the stinger that made him thus to hang down his head, to looke droopingly, and to fling away thus inwardly wounded and discontented. And hath not this yong man to many followers and successours in this age of ours? or, are there not Israelites enow among vs readie to giue any thing to the golden Caulf, and repining at euery thing that they should depart withall to the good of Gods Church? Doe we not see before our eyes, howe he that can hardly be drawen to spare a penie in the Church, can yet willingly and chearefullie afoord both pence and teasters enow for himself and others at a play? Nay more, are there not some that neuer gaue groate in their liues to the furtherance of any good cause without grudging, and yet to feede and foster themselves in their vanities and superfluities, haue full gallantly spent themselfs and their patrimony in all maner of riot and licentiousnes? The Lorde lay not this sinne to their charge but humble them to repentance before the day of his wrath. This treatise therfore of that thrice Reuerend man Maister D. Rainoldes, against stage Plaies (beeing a notable looking glasse for such cold Christians as these, and comming from a man of those rare and incomparable giftes, envied and yet admired of his very ennemies for his learning, iudgement, and pietie) falling by Gods providence into my handes, I thought it not my part, good Reader, (though it should be in some respect offensiue to th' Author himself) to conceale and keepe backe from thee in regard of the publike benefite that may thereby arise to the Church of God: And so much the rather, in that the matter herein laied down, is handled in another sort by way of controuersie, and farre otherwaies canvased both by sound argumentes, diuine and humane authorities, then to my knowledge hath bene done by any man that euer wrote in that cause before. His aduersarie Maister D. Gager is likewise, I vnderstand, a man of giftes, a good Schollar, and an honest man, and (as it should seeme by Maister Rainoldes his seuerall aunsweres and replies) hath saied more for the defense of Plaies then can bee well saied againe by any man that shall succeede or come after him. So that the cause beeing thus wittely and schollerlike maintained on th'one side, for, and in defense of plaies, and yet in the end all this rampier of defense quite ouerthrowne and laied flatte to th'earth by an vnresistable battery of profound and vnaunswerable argumentes and resolutions on th' other side, this must needes make the case more cleare and evident in th'eies of any man of iudgement, then if it had not bene gaine saied or withstoode at all. I haue bene informed also that Maister Gager himselfe vpon the last rejoinder of Maister Rainoldes hath let goe his hold, and in a Christian modestie and humilitie yeelded to the truth, and quite altered his iudgement. If it bee so (good Reader) and that so graue and learned a man hath chosen rather with that auncient father humile peccatum, then superbam ignorantiam, be not thou for thy part willfull and obstinate in thy conceite, whosoever thou art, but ponder the reasons and argumentes on th'one side, consider the dangers and inconveniences on th' otherside. And if thou haue bene bewitched with his vanitie heretofore, see whether th'advised perusall of this excellent treatise may happely by Gods mercy vnwitch thee againe. And take this with thee for a generall lesson and observation while thou livest , That whatsoever thy fleash, according to the common course of carnall men, delighteth in, suspect thou there is mischief in it, though thou be able to defende it by thy reason. Surely for mine owne part, I am perswaded if this present discourse bee read, marked, and disgested as it should bee, the gentlewoman that sware by her trouth , That shee was as much edefied at a play as ever she was at any sermo,  &c. will, ere she die, be of another minde, though it may be shee saied true then, in regard of her owne negligence and backwardnes in not giving eare to the word of God with reverence. The like may fall out also to those men too, that haue not bene afraied of late dayes to bring vpon the Stage the very sober countenances, graue attire, modest and matronelike gestures & speaches of men & women to be laughed at as a scorne and reproch to the world, as if the hypocrisie of Iudas (if it were brought vpon the stage) could any whitt disgrace the Apostles of our Saviour Christ, and yet if these men had but thus farre exceeded, kept themselues there, and gone no farther to the foule prophaning and abusing of the holy Scriptures of God, their sinne had not bene half so great as it is. Well to heale, if it may be, or at least, to correct the bad humour of such humorists as these (who in their discouery of humours doe withall fouly discover their own shame and wretchednes to the world) here is now laied before thee (good Reader) a most excellent remedie and receipt, if thou canst be so happie to make thy profitte of it. Reade it therefore and disgeast it, and, if thou find good thereof, giue God the glory, and blesse his Name, for so worthy an instrument. Thine in the Lord. sights, Stage-playes,  &c. your Tragedie : the more, for that you haue enlarged the answer to Momus (as you signifie) because you vnderstood that I & others should aske Why those thinges were not aunswered which were obiected . In deed, as our Savior 3 when he was smitten by one for speaking nought but reason, saide, If I haue spoken evill, beare witnesse of the evill; but if well, why doest thou smite me ? so they, whose obiections against playes you attributed to the person of Momus ,  & thereby noted them as vniust reproovers, might iustlie say in my iudgement; If our reasons be naught, discover their naughtines; if good, why doe you Mome vs ? And what so euer others had cause to thinke of them selues, yet I must needes thinke my self touched therein: although I should yeeld vnto your request (which I most gladlie doe) in that you pray me, not to mistake your meaning ; protesting your intent is not to note any man, but onely Momus . For  4 I did reprove our Theater-sights & Stage-playes , as  5 hurtfull and pernicious , many yeares agoe: and this yeare, ere your Momus , or any of your Enterludes came vppon the stage, I had (in letters written to our good friend Maister D. Thornton ) alleaged those reasons, which you make Momus vse, against them. Now Æ sopes tale of Momus (as  6 Aristotle sheweth in that your selfe mention of his reproving nature for setting bulles hornes vpon their heades, not vpon their shoulders ) was devised to checke such as reproue vniustlie the best and perfitest works of the most wise and skilfull. To the which purpose sith you rehearse it also, and inferre vpon it, that the man who taunteth playes with 7 the rascall reproches there specified, offendeth in the same sorte : how can it bee avoided, but I, who had vttered those things against playes, though deeming them sounde reasons, not rascall reproches , must thinke my selfe charged vnder the name of Momus ? vnlesse I should be so vnwise as to suppose, that my frende a lawier, saying, If Sempronius borow a horse of Seius, and ride him a mile farder, then Seius was content he should, 8 he comitteth theft , the speech doeth not charge me with theft, though I had done so, because the lawier meant not to charge me, whom he loueth, nor knewe perhaps that I had done it; but his meaning was to charge Sempronius onelie. Wherefore albeit you meane not to note any man but onelie Momus , as you protest, and I beleeue you: yet you meane withall (I trowe) the same that  9 Tullie , when having reprooved the couetousnes of Chieftaines and Gouuernours of their warres, I (quoth hee) name no man; Wherefore no man can bee angie with me, vnlesse he will confesse first of him selfe . Which I doe not mention to proove that I haue cause of being angrie with you (be it farre from me,) although I confesse my selfe to haue written those things which they, who speake, are stained with Momus name by you: but onely to shewe that by your speach against Momus , notwithstanding your intent to note no man but him, yet you note vs all, in him, as vniust reproovers of playes, who soeuer inveigh against them as hee doeth. And this your selfe can not choose but see and graunt, if you call to minde your verses ad Zoilum , and Epistle ad Criticum . For you will professe (I hope) that your intent is not to note anie man but onely Zoilus and Criticus : Yet, if anie finde such fault with your Tragedie , as you controll them for: you will not denie but you meane to note him as a malitious Zoilus , and a carping Criticke . Your wordes inforce so much, in that you tell the Criticke , that who so carpeth at the basenes of your matter and style, doeth not blame you but Homer; And who so blameth Homer, he must needes be a Zoilus . I must pray you therfore, not to misdeeme of mee, that I mistake your meaning, when I thinke you purposed to note generallie all reprovers of playes, as vniust reproovers: and so doe take my selfe, though not intended by the Censurer , who did not aime at mee; yet touched by the censure , whiche in event doeth light vppon mee. As for that you adde, that upon confidence of your owne conscience, and the trueth of the thinges them selves, you assure your selfe, that I can not bee displeased : I will assure you also that I mislike nothing in your entitling Momus vnto our reasons of reproofe, or in your answere to them, if, as you approoue your cause of confidence on the one parte, so you shall on the other. For your protestation of your own conscience doeth binde me by the law of charitie to thinke that you haue done this in singlenesse of heart, without spite and malice. But the trueth of the thinges themselves, that you chalenge, belongeth to the reasons fathered on Momus , not to your aunswere, in my opinion. Whereof, least you suspect it to proceede rather from a conceited fansie, then a sound iudgement, I will open to you my groundes and inducements: requesting you the same that  10 Horace did a frende of his; Si quid novisti rectius istis, Candidus imperti; si non, his utere mecum . And, because in weighing your aunswers with the reasons I shall bee occasioned to name this or that part, by circumstances, of your playes, as Antinous, Eurymachus, Hippodamia, Melantho , the rest of Penelopes wooers, or her maides, Phemius, Irus, Rivales, Ph aedra, or her Nurse : I must pray you to deale with me in this case, as you desired to bee dealt with, that is, to take my wordes, as spoken of Histrio (to faine a person like your Momus ) with no intent to note any of your players; no more, then if they had not seene the stage at all, but  11 Roscius & Æ sopus had played those parts, not Christ-church-students . Whom, and you for them, I shall finde the readier to grant this, I trust: because both my conscience doeth beare me witnesse before God, that I beare none of them evill will, nay, I wish vnto them all as to my selfe; and I assure you I know not who they were that played any of those partes, nor what their names be. To the first reason then (for I will take them in your owne order) that Stage- players are infamous by the civill lawe , you aunswere that  12 they are not all, but onely such as play for gaine sake : which you avouch is proved by the Pr aetors wordes. But that which you make the Pr aetor say, as distinguishing, Qui sui spectaculum Mercedis erg o praebet, infamis siet ; the Pr aetor saith not. Nay, contrariwise  13 he saith without all distinction, generallie and simplie: Infamia not atur, qui artis ludicr ae, pronuntiandive causa, in scenam prodierit . And Ulpian (whose  14 place you quote for proofe thereof) doeth report him so, with these verie words: Ait Pr aetor, Qui in scenam prodierit, "infamis est." But Vlpian , expounding these wordes of the Pr aetor , citeth some  15 lawiers saying, that they are infamous, qui qu aestus causa in certamina descendunt, & propter praemium in scenam prodeunt : and hereof you conclude, that  16 they, who come not foorth into the stage for gaine sake, are not infamous . By which kinde of reasoning one might conclude likewise, that sith by  17 the scripture a woman taking mony for prostituting her body to men is infamous: therefore she is not so, who doeth it freelie; much lesse, who giveth mony to haue her lovers companie; whom yet  18 the scripture counteth most infamous of all. Howbeit, had those lawiers, in adding, qu aestus causa , intended your conclusion; which I knowe not whether they did, but admitte it: neverthelesse you know that a  19 lawier also, perhaps more learned then they, hath made this note thereon, Imm o & qui sine quaestu. omnes enim scenici probrosi. August. lib. 2. de civit. Dei, cap. 11. & tribu moveri soliti. Livius lib. 7\. wherein, as hee gathereth, that such as come vpon the stage without gaine, are prooved by S. Augustin and Livie to be infamous, because S. Austin and Livie doe shewe that all stage-players (free players not excepted) were branded with a marke of infamie  & dishonestie, disfranchised in a sort: so he confirmeth hereby (which was and ought to bee the drift of his note) that by law the players without gaine are infamous, not onelie such as playe for gaine sake. And this doe their wordes, whom hee alleageth, implie, if they bee vnfolded and weighed indifferentlie, according to the rules of lawe for douts thence rising: to weet, that  20 custome is the best interpreter of lawes ; and,  21 autoritie of thinges still iudged of alike hath the force of law . For S. 22 Augustin groundeth his  23 generall conclusion vpon the ancient practise and order of the Romans testified by  24 Tullie : who saith that their auncestours, counting all kinde of stage playes shamefull and dishonest, agreed that such persons should not onely want the honour of other citizens, but also be disfranchised by the controlment and checke of Censors . Neither were they checked with this reproch and ignominie of olde time alone, but in Livies age too; yea, before, and after; at least, with the blemish and staine in mens opinion, though not with the punishment. 25 Cornelius Nepos saieth, that to come on the stage & be a spectacle to the people, was couted no dishonestie or shame among the Graecians; among the Romans it was. Laberius , a gentleman of Rome , taking pleasure in writing of poemes,  26 when C aesar prayed him to playe them him selfe vpon the stage, he yeelded as constrayned by the Princes request; but signified so much in his prologue, and declared withall what a blott it was vnto him: Ego bis tricenis annis actis sine nota, Eques Romanus e lare egressus meo, Domum revertar mimus: nimirum hoc die Uno plus vixi, mihi quam vivendum fuit .  27 Iuvenal , rebuking men of noble parentage tainted with like dishonor, doeth touch them vnder Lentulus name, with this censure: Laureolum velox etiam bene Lentulus egit, Iudice me dignus vera cruce . So shamefull a matter seemed it to him for Lentulus to play the parte of Laureolus (one, who in a Tragedie was fained to be hanged, as Melantho in yours) that he thought him woorthie to be hanged in earnest for it. Moreouer, he prosequuteth the point in such sorte, that hee cutteth off all opposition and replie, whereof else a shewe, but shewe alone, might be made against this testimonie and the former. For the Grecians spoken of by Cornelius Nepos did come vpon the stage for gaine, at least  28 some of them: though his speech concerning them (in the braunch I cited) bee generall, like  29 Tullies , without that limitation; and so must contrariwise be meant touching the Romans. Laberius had a ring and money giuen him by C aesar : though he shewe sufficientlie, that whereas no ambition, 30 no reward ever, no feare, no force, no authoritie, could make him a stage- player in his youth; much lesse should it haue done in his olde age at three score yeares: it was necessitie onelie, euen C aesars request , that is, constraint , which brought him to it. The men of noble parentage, whom Iuvenal rebuketh, were hired, as  31 himselfe noteth; and the storie of  32 Nero , who bought those needie squires to doe that seruice, recordeth: though Iuvenal adiudgeth them vnworthy of life, not onelie in respect that they played for their fee, but euen that they played too; as may appeare by that which foloweth, Nec tamen ipse Ignoscas populo: populi frons durior huius, Qui sedet & spectat triscurria patriciorum, Planipedes audit Fabios ridere potest qui Mamercorum alapas . For seeing that he findeth fault with the people, who sate & beheld the fowle misorders & scurrilities (such as your Antinous & other wooers practise) of persons nobly borne; who heard the race of Fabius resembling  & couterfaiting such base ridiculous things as are expressed in Irus ; who could abide to laugh at blowes  & whirrets, giuen to the Mamercians , as you would say vnto Ulysses . he sheweth that the verie action it selfe, all regard of lucre, or what soeuer motiue had brought them to it, sett apart, was dishonorable  & shamefull in his iudgement. But his like or sharper inveighing against Nero , touching whom he addeth,  33 that it was no marvell if noble men were stageplayers whe the Prince was a minstrell , doeth put the matter out of doubt: in as much as he, comparing Nero to  34 Orestes , both murderers of their mothers, maketh Nero worse in manie respectes, and this amongst them: In scena nunquam cant aevit Orestes . Wherein, by cantavit , he meaneth not onely that Nero played a minstrels part vpon the stage, as Phemius on yours: but also that he played the partes of men and women, perhaps with song alone, as your Hippodamia ; perhaps with song and speech both, as Eurymachus ; but partes of Men and Women certainlie. This, obscurelie signified by Iuvenal himselfe, mentioning the 35 tragicall habit of Thyestes, Antigona, Menalippe , worne by the ofspring of 'Domitius , that is, by Nero ;  36 Suetonius maketh playner; saying, Tragoedias cantavit personatus ; and, Inter c aetera cantavit Canaeen parturientem, Orestem matricidam, Oedipodem excaecatum, Herculem insanum. In the last of which tragedies it is reported that a yong souldier (one of Neros gard) being sett to keepe the entrie, when hee sawe Nero attired and bound with Chaines, as the argument required, hee ranne to him to helpe him ; thinking (poore freshwater creature) that his maister had bene chained in earnest. Another, better acquainted then hee with stage matters, and having served longer,  37 when Nero played the firste of them, namely Canace , the souldier beeing asked by some who mett him in the citie what the Emperour was doing, Hee is travailing with childe , quoth hee. The singing then vsed vpon the stage by Nero , for which Iuvenal counteth him worse then Orestes , was his playing of mens and wemens partes in tragedies. But Nero never played for gaine: nay, he was so farre from it, that, when a Pr aetor , who did sett foorth playes, offered him  38 about eight thousand pound to be an actor, he tooke the paines,  39 refused the mony, disdaining to doe ought for hire. Iuvenal therefore counteth all stage-players infamous, not onelie such as played for gaine. And what should I adioyne the testimonies of others, learned, vnlearned; both sortes declaring what Roman citizens thought hereof? For beside Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio, &c who hath written of Nero that hath not attainted him with this reproche? the common people, euen souldiers, reckened his stage-playing among his vitious acts: as,  40 in a conspiracie that was made against him, hee heard to his great grief; when Subrius Flavius , a Tribune, beeing demanded by him why he had sought his death, aunswered, Oderam te, nec quisquam tibi fidelior militum fuit, dum amari meruisti; odisse c aepi, postquam parricida matris, & vxoris, auriga, historio, & incendiarius extitisti : and Sulpitius Asper , aunswering more brieflie to the same demande, saide, Non aliter tot flavigitiis ejus subveniri posse . Neither was it the basenes thereof in comparison of his imperiall Maiestie, that they detested onelie, as his chariot-driving vpbraided him withall might giue cause to thinke, were it not a whelpe too of 41 the same litter: but the dishonestie and lewdnesse, which, accompanying commonly that trade, by many occasions incident into stage-playes, made such men infamous; and therevpon was noted, though as a more eminent fault in him then others, yet as a fault in others also. Pecuniam ob delicta dedit , saith  42 Tacitus , telling how Nero brought those poore decayed gentlemen of noble houses to the stage: and blaming  43 him, that hee did not rather giue them mony to keepe them from offending (so hee termeth stage-playing of it selfe without gaine) then to driue them to it . And Dio , a Senatour of Rome , well acquainted with their lawes and orders by  44 sundry great offices of state borne among them,  45 amplifying that iniurie done to more also, and to meaner persons then Tacitus speaketh of, nether all rewarded like them peradventure, sure Dio giving no inkling of that as the shame of it, saith,  46 it was most shamefull and grievous that they entred, some willing, some marvelous vnwilling, but they entred, 47 as the most infamous persons, to the stage, and played both tragedies & comedies . Wherefore sith the practise and iudgement of the Romans noted all stage-players generally with infamie, not onely such as played for gaine: it foloweth that the meaning of their lawe was generall, and so all stage- players to bee infamous by the civil law. Which lawe, if it deserue, though not the title of  48 the best applyed to it by your Momus , yet of  49 good and godly , giuen it by you in the rehearsall of his wordes, as you will graunt it doeth: I leaue it to your owne consideration, what credit your apologie of those playes deserveth. Chieflie seeing Nero , whom that law condemned, might haue vsed the same defense against his Momus , that you against yours, and knit it vp with the same wordes; Quis h ic rogavit sportulam, vel quis dedit? Cui non patebant sponte sine lucro fores ? And thus farr of your aunswer to the first reason. To the next, drawen from the best law indeed, euen the lawe of God  50 which forbiddeth a man to put on Womans raiment ; a thing though not distaining all stage-playes, yet welnigh all, and there amongst all yours: you answer that  51 it is not vnlawfull simply and alwayes, as if one doe it to saue his life, to benefit many ;  & hereof you conclude, that to do it in playes is not vnlawfull. Of the which enthymeme (to call the triall of your argumentes to the touchstone of Logicke) the consequution doutlesse is vnsound and naught, whatsoever the antecedent bee: and the antecedent, although in the balance of humane reason it may seeme to haue weight, yet if it be weighed in the  52 skales of the sanctuarie, will proove vnsound and light too. For the holy Ghost , the Spirite of trueth teacheth vs that  53 it is not lawfull for vs to doe evill, that good may come thereof . When 54 Christ on a Sabbat day went through the corne, and his disciples were an hungred, they began to plucke the eares of corne and to eate . The Phariseis reprooved them for it; but vniustlie: because it was not evill to woorke vpon the Sabbat day in such a case. For by evill is  55 sinne meant.  56 Sinne is the transgression of the law. The 57 law allowed Priestes to worke on the Sabbat day in offering sacrifices . And  58 sacrifice did not please God in comparison of mercy.  59 Therefore to doe that worke of mercie and charitie for the reliefe of hungrie bodies vpon the Sabbath day, was not euill. Contrariwise, when Peter 60 being in danger of trouble and vexation, if he had bene known to be of Christes disciples,  61 did therevpon denie that hee knew him , or had bene with him : he was put in minde by Christs 62 wordes  & 63 deedes, and he did acknowledge by  64 his owne teares, that hee should not haue done so. Why? Because he lyed, and 65 to lye is euill; not allowed in any case by  66 our Lawgiuer , no  67 not for the defense of the glorie of God, much lesse for the safetie of man a 68 Woorme . By conference and laying of which thinges together we are taught this difference betwene the morall law, and the ceremoniall, that the ceremoniall was not enioyned to be kept absolutelie and simply; and therefore 69 when it could not bee kept without the breach af the morall lawe, the law of loue and charitie it yeelded therevnto: but the morall lawe is simply and absolutely enioyned to be kept, as a paterne of that holinesse which God requireth in  70 his children,  71 Be yee holy, for I am holy ; and therefore,  72 who so breaketh any part thereof, though to keepe an other parte, doeth defile himselfe, and displease the Highest. Now, the prohibitio of men to be attired as wemen, wemen as men, belongeth to the morall, not to the ceremoniall law. For  73 Christ hath delivered vs fro the keeping of the ceremoniall. So that, were this difference of attire a ceremonie, then Christian men and wemen might ech cotinuallie weare the others rayment: as lawfully; as they may  74 weare a garment made of linen  & wollen; sow their field with maslin;  75 plow with an oxe and an asse ;  76 eate of swines slesh; of 77 blood; of strangled : if not more lawfullie rather then these last, which 78 the Apostles did forbid the Gentiles for a time, in respect of the Iewes. But they may not weare ech the others raiment: as the generall precepts absolutelie giuen in  79 the new testament touching the distinct and severall attire of both sexes, shew. It is a comandment therfore of the morall law, that wemen shall not attire them selves like men, nether men like wemen. And hereof it foloweth that if a man might saue his life, or benefit many, by putting on womans raimet, yet ought he not to do it, because it is euill. Nay (which addeth greater weight vnto the reason) it is a notorious and detestable euill: as  80 the Spirite sheweth by the words ensuing, For all that doe so are abomination to the Lord thy God . And seeing that himself hath giuen this censure, God forbid but we should thinke it most true and iust: although our weake eyesight could discerne no cause, why so small a matter, as flesh and blood might count it, should be controlled so sharpelie. Howbeit, if wee marke with iudgement and wisedome, first, how this precept is referred by learned Divines to the comandment  81 Thou shalt not commit adulterie , some  82 expreslie making it a point annexed therto, some impliedlie, in that either 83 they knit it to modestie, a parte of temperance, or  84 note the breach of it as ioyned with wantonnesse and impuritie: next, among the kindes of adulterous lewdnesse howe filthie and monstrous a  85 sinne against nature mens naturall corruption and vitiousnes is prone to; the Scripture witnesseth it in  86 Cananites, 87 Iewes, 88 Corinthians, 89 other in other nations,  & 90 one with speciall caution, Nimium est quod intelligitur : thirdlie, what sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of wemens attire on men may kindle in vncleane affections, as  91 Nero shewed in Sporus, 92 Heliogabalus in him selfe; yea certaine, who grew not to such excesse of impudencie, yet arguing the same in causing their  93 boyes to weare long heare like wemen: if we consider these things, I say, we shall perceiue that hee, who  94 condemneth the female hoore and male, and,  95 detesting speciallie the male by terming him a dogge , reiecteth both their offeringes with these wordes that they both are abomination to the Lorde thy God , might well controll likewise the meanes and occasions whereby men are transformed into dogges, the sooner, to cutt off all incitements to that beastlie filthines, or rather more then beastlie. But whether this were part of the cause that moved the Spirit of God, or no: it is cleere and certaine that hee pronounceth them abominable in his sight, or (as the Hebrues speake more forciblie) abomination , whosoeuer put on the different sexes raiment. And so, it being simplie and absolutelie vnlawfull, because it is forbidden by the morall law, and proved to be evill, a fowle abominable evill in Gods sight: the Christian faith instructeth vs that wee may not doe it for any good to come thereof, no not for the saving of honor, wealth, or life, of others, or our selues. The argumets, whereby you striue to proue the contrarie, are drawen from two exaples: One of the Macedonians , whose king Amyntas entertaining Persian ambassadors,  & having at their request broght noble wemen to the banket, when the embassadours dalying with them did touch their brests, & offred some to kisse them;  96 the kings sonne, misliking their lascivious actions, desired the to giue the wemen leaue to go forth, preteding they should returne neater, & so by his directio there came in their steed yong men, attired like them, with daggers vnder their garmentes, who slew the embassadours as soone as they offered to touch them: The other of Achilles , whose mother Thetis , at the time of the Troian warre, knowing (as Po ets faine) that hee should dye at Troy , if he went thither with the Grecians , did thervpon attire him (they say) as a woman, and committed him as her daughter to Lycomedes king of Scyros, 97 there to bee kept safe from that danger. For hence you conclude that a man may lawfully putt on womans raiment to benefit others, to saue his life; because the Macedonians , by their young Princes motion, and Achilles did so. Which argument if it holde, then may a man lye to saue his life, or benefit others, because  98 David did so: then may a man forsweare to saue his life, or benefite others, because  99 Peter did so. For the examples of  100 Prophets and  101 Apostles are surer groundes to build on, then of Achilles or Macedonians . But you will not say that wee may forsweare, nor lye(I hope) for any cause; sure the Scripture will not, neither the  102 best Divins ; no not  103 Schoolemen , or  104 Canonistes , which yet in many points are farre beneth the best. you must remember therefore that wee are to liue by lawes, not by examples: and regard in Macedonie , and Greece , as in  105 Rome, not what is done there, but what ought to bee done there . Else, by these verie examples that you stand on, not onelie kinges, but also their sonnes may put to death; and that, for wanton touching, not onelie for adulterie; nor their owne subiects alone, but forein embassadours; yea, their servants also, though innocent and giltlesse; and make a bootie of their cariage, their treasure, their furniture; all against the kinges advise and commaundement: for  106 so did the sonne of Amyntas . And a man, whose countrie doeth need and craue his seruice in lawfull warre against their enemies, may, for feare of death, vse  107 Vettienus his shifts to keepe at home; a youth, that is in loue, may put on maidens raiment, as  108 Ch aerea did the Eunuches for his Pamphilaes sake; a sonne may obey his mother, not  109 in the Lord, but against the Lorde, and by her commaundement behaue him selfe vnduetifullie, cowardlie, wantonlie: for  110 so did the sonne of Thetis . Wherein by the way you may obserue too, both what inconvenience and danger of vncleannesse cleaveth to this practise: and how Heathen men by the light of nature did descry the shamefulnesse of it and condemned it. For as hee whose fact  111 your selfe adiudge wicked Clodius I meane,  112 did satisfie his vilanous lust with C aesars wife by cladding him selfe in womans raiment: semblably Achilles deflowred Deidamia , king Lycomedes daughter, by the same occasion. And Statius , who reporteth the storie (so to terme it with  113 you) most exactlie, saith  114 that Chiron , the instructer and bringer vp of Achilles , would not haue suffered his mother to haue had him away, Si molles habitus & tegmina foeda fateri Ausa foret : that Calchas the Prophet , being filled wth Apollos spirit, cryed out, O scelus, en flux ae veniunt in pectora vestes; Scinde puer, scinde, & timidae ne crede parenti : that Achilles him selfe did say vnto Deidamia, Neque ego hos cultus, aut foeda subissem Tegmina, ni primo te visa in littore ; and  115 vnto his mother, Paruimus genitrix, quanquam haud toleranda jubebas, Paruimus nimium ; and vnto Ulysses , that Maternum nefas had caused him to put on indecores, fatorum crimina, cultus . The wich resolutions and speeches being attributed to heathen men by an heathen, and him an excellent Poet, who so well discerned what was fitt and seemely for every one to speak and thinke, that in this respect he is preferred by a  116 learned iudicious autor before Homer ; doe argue and declare, that wise  & vertuous persons, represented in Chiron , would not haue a man for safegard of his life vndergoe the shame of wearing womans raiment; that religious folke having the Spirit of God , as Calchas is imagined, accounted it a heinous crime, and wished children to rent such raiment when it were put on, and therein disobey their parents; that ingenuous valiant youths, like Achilles , may be ensnared for loue sake to weare it, not for life; and doo it for reuerence of parents, though with griefe; and lay the fault afterward vpon their mothers, and the destenies, that they were tainted with such dishonour. Thus is it apparant euen by the example which your selfe commende, that, as S. 117 Paul obserueth on the like occasion, nature and scripture teach the same: and the moral law of God, and law of nature, agreeing both in one, doo prooue it to be simply vnlawfull and evill for men to put on wemens raiment. But suppose it were not vnlawfull simply  & alwayes, because a  118 great Diuine saith it is a great question whether a man may do it to deliuer his countrie from an enemie , though  119 him selfe seeme to approoue the negatiue; and a certaine  120 Schoolman, affirming it to be euill and naught of it selfe , saieth that it may neuerthelesse be done for necessitie , perhaps  121 vpon I know not what conceit of somewhat ceremonial in it; but suppose a man might doe it for the sauing of his life or countrie: yet your reason faileth in the consequution, that a man may therefore doe it-to play a part in comedies or tragedies.  122 Dauid , when he was hungry, did eate the shewbread, which was not lawfull for him to eate : and our Sauiour sheweth that he did well therein. But if he hah done it in sport and of a meriment, when no neede enforced: the law, which 123 condemned a man for gathering stickes vpon the Sabbatday , would haue condemned him too. The graue Athenian Iudges, Areopagit ae did never punish any (I trow) for killing quailes to supply his want. But,  124 whe a lewd boy did picke out quailes eyes of a wanton humor, they iudged him worthy of death for it. Good Emperours haue  125 allowed men to doe their workes of tillage and husbandrie on the Soonday , when other dayes the season serveth not. What? to haue stage-playes vpon the Soonday therefore, or running of horses, or bearebaytings? No: they  126 disallowed it. He that should spende his life as  127 Samson did, in avenging him selfe of the Philistines , might haue the same testimonie of faith which  128 Samson had. But if one should spende it to shewe men Theater-pastime, as 129 that fellowe did who played Icarus before Nero , and falling down neere to his chamber, sprinkled him with blood ; wel might he earne the praise of Icarus . Wherefore albeit a man for the performance of necessarie dueties might putt on womens raiment: yet would it not folow thereof, that he may doe it to play a part in Enterludes; Much lesse will that conclusion followe, which in steede hereof you sett downe generallie, thereby to fetch about this hidden coclusion. For you doe inferre, as proved by those examples with the contrarie of Clodius , that  130 it is no fault for young men to weare womens raiment, but to doe it (as Clodius) with a lewde intent of committing whoredome, beguiling, and deceyving: neither doeth anie apparell, but the minde, make a man dishonest . And so assuming hereto, that  131 none of your young men , who were attired like women, had anie such intent or meaning ; you implie by consequence that it was no fault for them to be attired so; and therefore men may lawfully put wemens rayment on to play. But what a foundation this frame is built vpon, the consequence in religion and reason both will shew. The Scripture saith that  132 wemen, praying, or prophecying, ought to haue a veile or couer on their heads in token of subiection: but 133 men ought not to haue so . Nowe, what if a man thould preach or pray in the Church with such a veile as women beare in this respect; with a calle (for examples sake) or with a French hoode: should he offende, or no? Your inference sayeth, Nay, vnlesse he weare it with a lewde intent, as Clodius did. For no apparell, but the minde, doeth make a man dishonest : and therefore  134 it is no fault for a man to pray with a French hoode on his head. But Saint Paul sayth otherwise: and, though he would graunt the wearing of it with Clodius minde to be a greater fault; yet a fault would he iudge it to weare it with Penelopes , because the verie wearing of it, is forbidden. The  135 Ciuill lawe , speaking, of Mens and Womens garmentes, some peculiar to either, some common to them both, defineth those to bee common, which both may weare without reproofe; peculiar, which both may not . Women shall haue no garmentes peculiar nowe to them, if your speach be true. For men may weare their peticoates, kirtles, and whatsoeuer else without reproofe: beeause it is not any apparell, but the mind, that makes a man blame-worthie. The  136 Prophetes reprehend the people of Iurie and Ierusalem , for vanitie in apparell. The  137 Apostles require modestie and decencie therein. The  138 Fathers , instructing folke of seuerall sexes, estates, and professions, giue speciall preceptes of the same. The  139 Philosophers, and  140 Statemen, haue thought some rayment comelie for honest personages, some vncomelie. All greatlie overseene, if it be no shame for what so euer person to goe attired how so euer; and euerie one may weare of anie matter, facion, colour, price hee list. But if they were not overseene all, whiche for some of them wee are sure they were not: then must wee acknowledge, that, as in meates and drinkes  141 that which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man ; yet, if men drinke too much  142 wine , they are defiled by their intemperance and riott: likewise in apparell, that which cometh vpon the backe, dishonesteth not the man; yet, if men weare costlier garmentes then they ought, they are dishonested by their riotous and vnmodest behaviour. And so, if anie man doe put on Womans raiment, hee is dishonested and defiled, because he transgresseth the boundes of modestie and comelinesse, and weareth that which Gods lawe forbiddeth him to weare, which mans lawe affirmeth hee can not weare without reproofe: though otherwise a Womans raiment of it selfe doeth neither discommende or commende the wearer; no more than  143 meate maketh vs acceptable to God ;  144 For the kingdome of God is not meate, nor drinke (I may adde, nor apparell) but righteousnes and peace and ioy in the holy Ghost . Wherefore you had done better service to the trueth, if, in steede of your egre knitting vp of this point with this epiphonema, 145 Cursed is the glosse that corrupteth the good text , you had obserued rather as  146 Tertullian doeth, that the good text you speak of, I meane, the holy Scripture specifieth not any apparell  147 Cursed by God, but onely womans worne by man ; and had applied it also against mens wearing of it in stage-playes, as  148 hee doeth. At least I could haue wished your censure had bene milder, if not in regard of a younger Preacher, who did so expound that text in a godly Sermon before your booke was printed: yet in consideration of that ancient Father, with  149 many other worthy men, whose learned writinges doe glosse it in the same sort; and of a  150 generall Councell, which noteth mens wearing of wemens, raiment though in playes, as a heinous crime. But if our glosse be cursed, who say that in the general sentence of the Scripture, All men are abomination that put on wemens raiment , the speciall is comprised, Players are abomination that put on wemens raiment ; a thing which your Law-glosses obserue vpon your 151 lawes, as standing with reason, and therevpon doe gather (agreeablie to a  152 rule of law) that he, who fordiddeth the generall, will not haue the speciall practised ; and, every speciall is suspended, whe the generall is suspended : what maner a glosse is yours, which deduceth out of the generall affirmatiue a particular negatiue, that is, a flat contradictory;  & turneth, Al are , into, Some are not ; and delivereth as a rule that it is no dishonestie for a man to weare whatsoever apparell, if his minde be chast? Yet the third reason, wherein playes are charged, not for making young men come foorth in hoores attire, like  153 the lewde woman in the Proverbs ; but for teaching them to counterfeit her 154 actions, her  155 wanton kisse, her impudent face, her  156 wicked speeches and entisements; should haue bene allowed even by your owne glosse and exposition of the text: sith  157 you say vpon it, that different behaviour becommeth different sexes, and, it beseemeth not men to folow wemens maners. 158 Thetis taught Achilles howe to play the woman in gate, in speech, in gesture: Sic ergo gradus; sic ora, manusq nate feres, comitesqacute; modis imitabere fictis . And because his mother had not taught him enough, or he was but a bad scholer:  159 Deidamia gaue him farder advertisements, how he must hold his naked brest, his hands ,  & so foorth. These are wemens maners vnseemelie for Achilles to imitate: he should not haue done it. How much lesse seemely then is it for young men to danse like wemen, though like  160 those, who praised God with danses: and much lesse seemelie yet to danse like vnhonest wemen, like  161 Herodias ? whereby what a flame of lust may bee kindled in the hearts of men, as redie for the most part to conceue this fire, as flaxe is the other, 162 Christian writers shewe in parte by Herodes example: but a  163 Heathen Po et more fullie by his owne experience; affirming that hee was not ravished so much with his mistresses face, though marvellous faire and beautifull, nor with her heare hanging downe loose after the facion about her smooth necke ; nor with her radiant eyes, like starres ; nor with her silkes ,  & outlandish braverie; as hee was with her galant dansing . And greater reason is it you should condemne all stage-playes, wherein young men are trained to play such wemens partes, because, vnto Momus terming the stage a  164 schoole of scurrilitie and wantonnesse , you reply, that  165 mery things are called wanton by him , and that  166 hee is not able to alleage one worde savouring of scurrilitie . As if you had saide, that, could hee make proofe of the least scurrilitie or wantonnes therein, your selfe would condemne them: according both to Christian pietie, by the  167 Apostles , and to civill honestie by the  168 Philosophers precept. Which sheweth that you acknowledge it vnseemelie also for men to play such mens parts, as defile their mouthes with vnmodest speeches; much more, as staine their bodies  & mindes with wanton deedes.  169 When Critobulus kissed the sonne of Alcibiades , a beautifull boy, Socrates saide he had done amisse and very dangerously: because, as  170 certaine spiders, if they doe but touch men onely with their mouth, they put them to wonderfull paine and make them madde: so beautifull boyes by kissing doe sting and powre secretly in a kinde of poyson, the poyson of incontinencie , as  171 Clemens Alexandrinus speaking of vnholy and amatorie kisses, saieth: Amatorie  172 embracing goeth in the same line with amatorie kissing, if not a line beyond it. Amatorie dansing is, in  173 Homers wantons, as oile vnto the fier: and the  174 commendation that  175 Tullie giueth it in bankets, S. 176 Ambrose giueth it in stage-playes. Herewithall if amatorie pangs be expressed in most effectuall sort: can wise men be perswaded that there is no wantonnesse in the players partes, when experience sheweth (as wise men haue observed) that men are made adulterers and enemies of all chastitie by comming to such playes? that 177 senses are mooved, affections are delited, heartes though strong and constant are vanquished by such players ? that  178 an 179 effeminate stage-player, while hee faineth love, imprinteth wounds of love ? Moreover, sith of like things you must needes iudge alike: you disallow the practising of other vices also, as well as of wantonnes and scurrilitie. Which I presume the rather, because  180 you say of your actors, the yong men of your house, that they are ingenuous, learned, chaste, well nurtured, and vertuously disposed . For if, vpon this praise giuen them by you, I should reply, as  181 Phocio the Athenia did, who, when the king of Macedonie (his countries secret enemie) sent him a hundred talents, and he demading of the bringers why among so great a number of the Athenians , the King sent that to him alone, they aunswered that the King thought him alone an honest man; Then let him suffer me both to seeme and be such a one , quoth Phocio : I assure my selfe you would reioyne that you wish them to seeme  & be such as you avouch they are; and therefore that you would no more haue them doe any thing, whereby they might hazard the losse of any other of those good qualities, or the credit thereof, then whereby of chastitie. Now, within the compasse hereof doth the playing of sundry parts in Comedies fall, as of coosening varlets, base parasites, and the rest, reproued by S. 182 Cyprian : of sundry partes in tragedies, as of ambitious, cruell, blasphemous, godlesse caitiues, and such as  183 Horace noteth, Sponsi Penelop ae, nebulones, Alcinoiq In cute curanda plus aequo operata inventus : in a woord of all such parts in what soeuer playes, as  184 Saluianus censureth with that  185 text of Scripture,  186 The foole doth committ wickednes in pastime ;  & the  187 Scripture teacheth they are no better then madd men, As a madde man casteth firebrands, arrowes, and mortall thinges; so is he that deceyueth his neighbour, and saith, was I not in sport ? For, the care of making a shew to doe such feates, and to doe them as lively as the beasts them selues in whom the vices raigne, worketh in the actors a maruellous impression of being like the persons whose qualities they expresse and imitate: chiefly when earnest and much meditation of sundry dayes and weekes, by often repetition and representation of the partes, shall as it were engraue the things in their minde with a penne of iron, or with the point of a diamond. In which cosideration the Spirit of God instructeth vs, that we ought to  188 imitate, resemble,  189 folow God, and 190 Godly men, and 191 that wich is good ;  192 not any euil thing, but good onely; and 193 meditate, 194 exercise those things . And the Paynim Romans, though  195 bound to haue stage-playes by their superstition in honour of their Deified deuils , Yet  196 destroyed Theaters once as vnprofitable, & likely to breede publike 197 corruption of maners . And the  198 Lacedemonians , by their ancient orders, might not heare comedies nor tragedies : because they would not haue their lawes gainsaid, though in iest . Neither would the  199 Massilias suffer any stageplayers to come amongst the: least the custome of beholding euil things represented should breed licentiousnes of folowing them . And  200 Solon , when Thespis , the first tragedie-player, being demanded by him if he were not ashamed to vtter such lyes before so great a company, said it was no harme to speake and doo such things in sport ; the graue old man, striking the ground with his staffe, But shortly (saith he) we, who doo commend and approoue this sport, shall finde it in our earnest contracts and affaires . This if that discreete Athenian lawgeuir, if the Romans , the Lacedemonians , the Massilians feared in the beholders  & hearers, and feared not without cause, as  201 experience taught: how much greater outrage of wickednes and iniquitie are the actors & players them selues likely to fall into? Seeing that diseases of the mind are gotten farre sooner by counterfeiting, then are diseases of the body: and bodily diseases may be gotten so, as appeareth by  202 him, who, faining for a purpose that he was sicke of the gowte, became (through  203 care of counterfeiting it) gowtie in decde. So much can imitation & meditatio doe. Wherefore, in my iudmet considering what your selfe doo grant, or must by consequece, such playes as bring in wooers masked, and dansing, vsing much vnmodest behauiour in woordes and deedes; young men in wemens raiment, and supposed to be gentlewemen, dansing with them; Eurymachus kissing of Melantho , and Melantho bewailing the case that no more kissing, nor dansing now , when she must be hanged; Riuales fond,  & amarous; mariners beastly dronken; Ph aedra incestuously embracing, and endevouring to inflame her sonne Hippolytus with loue-speeches; the Nurse , and a new Nymph thereto, bringing fewell enough to heale and melt a heart of yse or snow; with other thinges haply, which, as  204 Æ schines said of Demosthenes, What if you had heard him selfe ? so they who were present, and beheld the playes, can better tell then I: such stageplayes, I say, you ought in my iudgement acknowledge to bee iustly charged and condemned by the thirde reason. But  205 you, proposing it briefly, that much time was lost and misspent about them , make answere that there was not ;  & adde sundry argumets to iustifie the spending of time and paines therein. S. 206 Cyprian writing of a stageplayer who made boyes effeminate by instructing then how to play the wemen, and to expresse  & counterfeit vnhonest wanton gestures, saith,  207 he was a maister not of teaching but spilling children . Whose words put me in minde that the losse of time should not haue bene obiected so much against your playes: seeing some of the players (if they were like the youthes whom Cyprian speaketh of) might reply as  208 Ph aedria ; when Parmeno did tell him that his gift bestowed on Thais would bee lost, Ego quoque vn a pereo, quod mihi est carius: ne istuc tam iniquo patiare animo. There was no more time spent about them (  209 you say) then vseth to bee spent in sports, sleepe, talke, and learned releasing of the minde from studie . It may bee that there was: euen some time that should haue bene spent in hearing Sermons the very day that your Ulyssis redux came on the stage. But if a student haunting a dicing house or taverne with vs, or stewes at Rome , should say hee spent no more time thereat, then others doe in sports, sleepe, talke and learned releasing of the minde from studie: were this sufficient proofe that hee did not misspend his time? you adde that  210 your actors can shewe greater fruite of their time well spent, then any that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can . I pray God they may. Sure they shall the better if they bee informed that this which you terme the discipline of Momus , is not his, but  211 Cyprians , who entitled the stage  212 a stewes of publike shame ; or rather the  213 holy Ghosts , who willeth vs to abstaine from all appearance of evill : and that the contrarie, for the loue whereof you would disgrace this, hath to great affinitie with the  214 strumpets discipline , mentioned in the Proverbs . You demand  215 whether wee dare despise learned Po etrie . No. For S.  216 Paul hath sanctified (as 217 Tertulian well saith) a verse of Menander : and  218 citing other Poets doth shewe that there is good vse of them. But S. Paul who did not despise Menanders comedies could haue deemed it vnmeete for a 219 Timothee to play the midwifes part, or Darus , or Dromo , in  220 his Andria or Perentia . you aske  221 Whether we thinke it a losse to recite Seneca . Not I: who haue recited sundry of his verses vpon occasion in my Lectures. But it is one thing to recite; an other thing to play: as you may learne by  222 Iuvenal , who dispraised not Poets for  223 reciting comedies, yet thought a  224 ma ought rather choose to dye the play them: by Plinie , who esteemed (no dout) of stage-playing like a Roman ; yet  225 prayed others to recite, or  226 praised them for doeing it, and  227 did it him selfe; by  228 Scaliger , who reporteth out of the same Plinie that a Latin comedie endited in such sort as the olde comedie of the Greeke was  229 recited in his time at Rome , but not played. And if your tragedie had bene recited onely, as by the  230 title a stranger might conceue, who knew not that it had bene played: surely for mine owne parte I would haue accounted it no more losse of time to haue heard you pronounce it then my selfe to reade it. But it beeing played as  231 Terences were: a looser Poet then Terence would controll my iudgement and very iustly might, if seeing there is in it a  232 Sweete Melantho, a lewde queane , I should not thinke there came hurt by the playing of it. For you know what  233 Plautus saith of his captiue , that  234 it would be good for them to heare and see that enterlude played, because it was not made like others, it had no filthy verse, nor perjured bawde, nor wicked hoore, nor boasting souldier . Finally you say that  235 there is a time for sports, playes, danses, a time for earnest studies: and, man consisteth not of one part alone; he hath a body as well as a minde . Time of recreation is necessarie, I graunt: and thinke as necessarie for scholers that are scholers in deede, I meane, good students, as it is for any. Yet in my opinion it were not fit for them to play at stoole ball among wenches; nor at Mum-chance or Maw with idle loose companions, nor at trunkes in Guile-hals, nor to danse about Maypoles, nor to rifle in alehouses, nor to carowse in tavernes, nor to steale deere, nor to robbe orchardes. Though who can deny, but they may doe these thinges, yea worse, even those S. 236 Paul meant by chambering and wantonnes, and that in the most heinous degree, euen of incest, if your generall speech concerning recreation be not better limited? For to goe no farder then your owne Phoedra , the same reason serveth her vnto Hippolytus: 237 Quod caret alterna requie durabile non est: H aec reparat vires, fessaq, membra levat. Arcus, & arma tuae tibi sint imitanda Dianae: Si nonquam cesses tendere, mollis erit . Good verses, and a holesome lesson: fit for chast Hippolytus to think of  & remember. But as he had learned by the light of nature, that albeit rest and recreation is needfull, yet the thing which Phoedra laboured to perswade him vnder pretense of rest and recreation, was execrable: so students are instructed by  238 folowers of the same light (to goe no higher for this matter) that all sports and playes are not expedient, honest, seemely, some savour of dishonestie. Of which kinde danses are, as the Gentiles sawe by the same light also: those danses, that you speake of, if you speake to purpose; not  239 Davids dansing, which S. 240 Ambrose doeth well distinguish from them, but danses of Penelopes wooers, of Melantho ; of other of her maides, and simplie all stage-dansing. In so much that the  241 Romans , whom Nero enforced, if they could doe no other service on the stage, to danse there at least,  242 pronounced the dead happy, who by departure out of life had escaped that shame. The  243 Philistines accouted it a meet dishonor for their greatest enemie, when they put Samson to it: if yet the playing  & sporting before them, which they put him too, were so ignominious. All auncient lawes almost (as a  244 learned man doeth note vpon occasion of that cocerning Samson ) yea, and reason it selfe doe brande with a marke of dishonestie and infamie, those that daunse publikelie; and persons of such showes and spectacles. Wherefore the needfulnes of a time for sportes, for playes, for recreation, as well as for studie, doeth not prooue the lawfulnes of your Theatricall sports, and playes; of the daunses mentioned; of young mens womanlie raiment; of Melanthos kissing; of Ph aedras furious rage; her Nurses and the Nymphes bawdrie of wantonnes and scurrilitie shewed in sundrie speeches, actions and gestures; of the loose and beastlie behauiour of the mariners, with the rest of like qualitie. Nay, your owne argument that man consisteth not of one part alone, he hath a minde as well as a body, confuteth all such sportes; because, as recreation is needfull in regard of the body, so vertuous recreation in regard of the minde: and vertue more necessarie much then recreation, by howe much the minde is of more excellencie then the body; or rather by how much more profitable it is for minde and body both, sith hee who wanteth  245 vertue,  246 is blinde, and,  247 godlines hath the promise both of the life present & of the life to come , and  248 without peace and holines, no man shall see the Lord. Now, these things standing thus, what need I spend wordes in prooving of the fourth reason, namelie, that the charge of setting foorth such playes is mony cast away, and addeth wastfulnes to wantonnes, when your owne aunswere doeth strengthen it sufficientlie? For in that you say,  249 there is a time of sparing, a time of honest spending , you graunt that vnhonest expense is still vnlawfull: as you haue cause to doe, seeing it is of 250 riott condemned by our Sauiour in the prodigall sonne. Wherefore, vnlesse that vnthrift might haue aunswered Christ or anie other reproouer, Thou blamest me for wasting, but I wast none of thine; thou maist drinke with mee scotfree, if thou be a good fellowe, and welcome: I see not how  251 your aunswere to Momus can be iustified, Thou sayest the charge is great; but thou mayest come, and looke on, Momus, and paye nothing, no man doeth aske thee a penie . And that which  252 hee obiecteth, that it had bene better bestowed on the poore , is as weaklie mett with; in that you replie,  253 The charge, great to him, is meane & moderate to you; none will giue the lesse to the poore for that none would haue giuen the more without it . For  254 Nero , being tickled with desire of prayse, and louing to heare men approoue his playing on the stage with clapping of their hands, and crying out, Excellent, excellent , did choose a lustie bande of valiant youthes to doe it, whose Captaines hee gaue  255 three hundred pound a piece, or better. This, if we consider  256 the millions that he wasted in prodigall giftes, was lesse charge to him, supposing it amounted to three thousande pound, or foure, or fiue, or more, then three or fower, or fiue, or a fewe more shillings is to some of yours. Yet the storie noteth it as part of his wastfulnes: and Nero peradventure was either lesse able or lesse willing to helpe the poore, by reason of that moony giuen for a Plaudite . But you tell Momus , that  257 their speech, who saide ,  258 what needed this waste? is evill . An evill speech in deede, as  259 Iudas and others vsed it, because that was no waste, 260 it was a good worke 261 done for the preparing of Christ to his buriall . But neither is it a good woorke or seruice vnto Christ, to spende thirtie pound in trimming vp a stage and borowing roabes out of the revils, for the feeding of that humour whiche 262 Horace , though an Epicure , condemned of great  263 lightnes in the people of Rome: and  264 Chrysostome , but what speake I of a Christian Bishop, who may be thought to rigorous? a  265 heathenish Lacedemoniaa , seeing much cost bestowed on a stage at Athens , saide they were much to blame for wasting thinges of woorth on toyes ; And 266 Tullie with the learned (whose iudgemet he relieth on) doe giue such expense the note of  267 prodigalitie . The more sorie am I, that you conclude your answere to this and all the former reasons with alleaging  268 the iudgement of our Uniuersitie ; yea, with asking vs, whether we set nothing by it . Wherein first you doe the Vniuersitie wrong, in charging the body thereof with allowing that, which some were not present at, because they disallowed it, some disallow it who were present: as in part I knowe by a graue learned man, your good friend and mine, who shewed me his dislike of the representation of amorousnes and drunkennes, in Rivales both; the former, not in Rivales onely: in parte I coniecture by that I vnderstande that certaine who came thither, came eue pressed to it by great importunitie; and as my selfe by such meanes haue bene ouerintreated to doe that sometimes which I repeted afterward, so I thinke of others, men subiect to the like passions that I am. Next, you doe vs iniurie, who dissent from them that approue and like it, in that you entwite vs as setting nothing by their iudgement: when you should rather thinke, by the rule of charitie, that we dissent from them as  269 Augustin did from Cyprian , whose iudgement notwithstanding he reverenced and made account of. But to them I say, with  270 Paul , to the Philippians, If yee bee otherwise minded, God shall reveile euen the same to you , and I assure my selfe, they will take in good part, that I preferre before them the iudgement of the Church in so manie Councells, what Generall, what Provinciall, of  271 Constantinople ,  272 Laodicca, 273 Carthage, 274 Arles , and  275 Aquisgranum ; to pretermitt the Fathers, of whom what one is otherwise minded? To your selfe I say farder, that in steed of your question proposed vnto vs, Academi ae tu judicia nihili facis? I propose you an other vpon a 276 surer ground, though in a verse like yours, and God graunt you may thinke religiouslie, wiselie, & fruitfullie thereof, Ecclesi ae ta iudicia nihili facis? Thus haue I shewed you what mooveth me to thinke that the trueth belongeth rather to the reasons fathered vpon Momus , then to your aunsweres: Which I haue strained my selfe to doe the sooner amiddest my great busines, that as you were desirous by a common friend of ours to satisfie mee, with protestation of your heartie affection and good will: so you might perceyue I am as careful to approove my iudgement vnto you, my good will at least, if you shall notwithstanding mislike of my iudgement. And if you will signifie to me what you mislike in anie of the pointes, which I haue stoode vppon or touched by occasion; you shall finde me as willing to learne, by Gods grace, as I am readie to teach, according to Saint  277 Basils counsell. For as the loue I beare to you, and to others, enforceth me the  278 later, not to conceale through envie any thing I knowe; so the loue I beare to former, not to bee ashamed to learne that I knowe not. The Lord fill our heartes with his holy Spirit, and haue vs in his gracious protection for euer. At Queenes Colledge. Iul. 10\. 1592. Yours in the Lord Iohn Rainolds. forbeare, Maister Rainoldes did reioine as followeth. writing, and by word of mouth in priuate coference informe you, if you haue greatlie erred in any part of your answer; brought into my minde  280 the Philosophers censuring and checking of such as offered sacrifice for health, and at their very sacrifizing did banket riotouslie against health . For that which I wrote concerning things, the stage-playes, you draw vnto the persons, who played on the stage at Christchurch, as if I went about to make the and your house most vilanouslie infamous: and partlie by concealing, partly by perverting the drift  & substance of my speeches, you seeke to smoother vp and suppresse the trueth. Which being done in writing by you with care and diligence, not to be imparted vnto me alone, but to others also, as your selfe doe signifie: if I should note the fault thereof by worde of mouth, my plaister would be lesse a great deale then the wound, and therefore neuer reach to heale it: for woordes haue wings, and flie away, mens writings doe remaine. But as farre as possiblie I may without neglect of the duetie I owe to God and to his Church, I yeelde to your request: that is, I will endeuour to make plaine vnto you the iniuries and wrongs that your aunswer doth me, as brieflie as the necessarie clearing of the truth, and scattering of the mistes whereby you goe about to darken it, will permit. The point that is in question betweene vs touching stage-playes, was generallie mooued: to weet, whether such as play them doe offende, or such as reprooue the playing of them. You vndertooke to shewe that the reproouers are faultie: I, that the Players. And least the dissension of opinions heerein should breed exulceration of mindes betwene vs, if that, which either of vs said touching the matter, should be taken odiously as meant against the persons whom it might concerne: you, with protestation of your good will to mee-ward, desired mee not to thinke that you meant to note me by the name of Momus ; I prayed you the like with like protestation in respect of your players;  & that with greater reason why you should haue yeelded to it in my opinion, sith neither one of their names, Phemius for example sake, doeth signifie a lewd player, as Momus doeth an vniust reproouer; neither did I know who played that part and others, as you knew my mislike of playes. Now, I condescended to your desire most gladlie: your selfe acknowledge it, and hartilie thanke me for it. I would to God I might haue likewise thanked you: whereof you haue giuen me so litle cause, so great cause to the contrarie, that I must needes coplaine you haue forgotten the lesson which a  281 heathen Emperour had learned of Iewes or Christians , and marueilouslie loued it, Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris . For whereas you had said that stage-players were not counted infamous by the civill lawe, but onely such as played for gaine; and I, to refute this, declared that the Romans , whose iudgement and custome doeth best interpret their owne law, counted Nero infamous for playing, though freelie; which, least you perhaps through ambiguitie of a  282 worde, should except against, that it was not stage-playing of Mens and Womens partes, I opened it by the examples of your Hippodamia, Eurymachus , and Phemius: you replie hereon, that this is my arguing; Many noble men, and Nero him selfe were infamous for playing, though freelie, mens and womens partes, and specially Nero for singing like a fidler on the stage; Ergo, scholers and the students of Christ-church are to be noted with a marke of infamie, for playing, though gratis, such partes as they did in Ulysse reduce; and namely the Master of our Choristers for playing Phemius; notwithstanding for his honestie, modestie, and good voice, he is as worthie to be deliuered from infamie, as Phemius him selfe is fained to bee saved from death, for his excellent skill in Musicke, to say nothing of the rest . And not content to wrest mine argument from my drift, and racke it to my sentence from the Ciuill lawe , to Christ-church players from the Roman , you shutt vp your tale with this morall: I dare not denie this argument, because it is yours; I referre it to the charitable iudgement of my betters. 283 Hast thou appealed to C aesar? to Caesar shalt thou goe , quoth Festus . Euen so am I contented, good Syr, that our betters doe iudge of mine argument, and your charitable vsage of it. To the which intent I beseech you hartilie, that, with the next play you publish, you will set foorth my letters, and your answere to them. In the meane season, I thinke, that when omitting the force of mine argument against your distinction of playing for gaine,  & freelie, you drew in the mention of the Maister of your Choristers, his honestie, his modestie, his good voice, his Musicke, and of the rest of the Scholers & students of Christ-church: your purpose was to shewe a peece of that art, that Servius Galba did. Who, being endited of a  284 great offence, whereof he could not cleere him selfe, and therefore  285 slipping from it, comended to the iudges both his owne children, and the child of his kinsman, a most woorthie citizen, that being lately dead, had left him gardian to his childe: so to save him selfe by the peoples mercie and commiseration of the boyes, which he could not haue done by the desert of the cause and his owne innocencie. For if the good qualities of the Maister of your Choristers, or of your Scholers and Students, doe prooue that the Romans couted it no infamie for such to be stage-players, howe soeuer they counted it for Nero: then  286 Tullie spake absurdly, when he said that Roscius both for his skill in playing seemed alone worthie to come vpon the stage, and for his 287 vertue and honestie, seemed alone worthie not to come vpon it . And how can the charitable iudgement of your betters; nay, howe can your owne, charge me as offending for setting downe that of the Romans , which by consequent toucheth the Maister of your Choristers credit, and others of Christchurch: where your self acknowledge, that your invectiue against Momus , doeth consequently fal on me, on the Preacher, on whosoever else reproove playes, and yet you may haue written it without offence, you trust? But in this matter your fault is the lesse, because you had some colour thereof by mine exemplifying in three of your players: nor did the Romans alwayes count them so infamous but that the best of them were sometime well esteemed of, as  288 Tullies great acquaintance with Roscius and Æ sopus argueth. In the next you doe me so much the greater iniurie, by how much both the turpitude and vilanie is greater wherwith you beare your Students in hande that I charge them: and I was farder off from giuing cause to be so dealt with, hauing refrained purposelie from naming any of yours in opening of the point. For being to proove that the prohibition of men to put on womens raiment ( in Deuteronomie ) belongeth to the morall law, and therevpon declaring how it is referred by learned Divines, to the commaundement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie: I said that they had reason to referre it so, because, among the kindes of adulterous lewdenes, mens naturall corruption and vitiousnes is prone to monstrous sinne against nature, as the Scripture witnesseth in Cananites, Iewes, Corinthians , other in other nations, one with speciall caution Nimium est quod intelligitur ; and the putting of womens attire vpon men, may kindle great sparkles of lust thervnto in vncleane affections, as Nero shewed in Sporus, Heliogabalus in him self; yea certaine, who grew not to such excesse of impudencie, yet arguing the same in causing their boyes to weare long heare like women. This, in your examining the sense of Moses wordes, wherevnto I vsed it, you passe ouer wholly; without mention of the iudgement of the learned Diuines, or of my reason giuen for it. But in the point following, where I handled other inconueniences and discommodities of playes, with speciall applyinge thereof vnto yours: We pray you Syr (say you) to make a great difference betweene vs and Nero with his Sporus , or Heliogabalus with him selfe , or the Cananites, Iewes, Corinthians , or them that cause their Pages to weare long heare like women, or any such dogges: we hartilie abhorre them. You say out of Quintilian , Nimium est quod intelligitur: and I may say , Nimium est quod dicitur. Wee thanke God, our youth doe not practise such things, they thinke not of the, they know them not: neither ca any ma liuing the rather for our playes charge any one of vs with the least suspicion of any such abomination. I haue bene often mooved by our playes to laughter, and sometime to teares: but I can not accuse either my selfe, or any other, of any such beastlie thought stirred vp by them. And therefore we should most vncharitablie be wronged, if our putting on of womanly rayment, should either directlie or indirectlie be referred to the commandement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie . All these are your owne wordes. In which that you may see, what your dealing is, beholde a paterne of it. There was a certaine Preacher, who catechizing his hearers in the principles of faith, and deliuering to them  289 Christes exposition of the law, Thou shalt not committ adulterie ; tolde them that the verie looking vppon women, whereby men are occasioned to thinke or lust vnchastlie, is a breach thereof. He prooved it by the examples of  290 Putiphars wife, who cast her eyes on Ioseph , and fell in love with him; of  291 Iob , who therefore made a couenant with his eyes, least hee should thinke vpon a maide ; of  292 Dauid, who looking on Bethsabe from his house toppe , did lust incontinentlie after her. And because the parties, whom he taught, were schollers, well read in forein writers, he added howe the learned Heathens had declared that  293 love doeth enter in by the eyes ;  294 faire persons seene, haue made men madd ; and in them also is that verified, 295 Uritq videndo F aemina ; as  296 Xenophon recordeth Cyrus to hauc noted; and  297 Propertius found by triall in him selfe. Now, among the companie to which the Preacher spake, one, not evill minded, yet loving good felowship, and a more remisse, or welnigh loose kinde of living, fearing least by the credit  & force of this doctrine, certaine of his friendes whom he had made acquainted with beautifull wiues, or handsome maides, should growe into suspition of wantonnes and lightnes, rose vp and said vnto the Preacher; We pray you, Syr, to make a great difference betweene vs, and them whom Cyrus speaketh of, or Propertius him selfe; or Putiphras Wife , Iob, Dauid, or such as let their eyes bee porters unto loue, and dote by seeing faire persoons: Wee hartilie mislike them. You say out of Virgill, Vritq, videndo Foemina, and I may say, Vritq, loquendo Masculus. We thanke God, our youth doe not practise such thinges, they thinke not of them, they know them not: neither can anie man liuing, the rather for our looking on handsome maides, or beautifull Wiues, charge any one of vs with the least suspicion of any such vncleannes. I haue bene delited often with their sight, and sometime mooved to pitie: but I can not accuse either my selfe, or any other of any such wicked thought stirred vp thereby. And therefore we should most vncharitably be wronged, if the casting of our eyes on wives, or on maides, should either directlie or indirectlie be referred to the comaundement, Thou shalt not commit adulterie . What thinke you of this man, Maister D. Gager? Did hee not the Preacher wrong? Certainlie, if you haue the spirit wherwith  298 David answered Nathans parable, you will confesse, he did. And what ensueth, you see: I neede not adde, You are the man . But this I must adde, that the wrong you doe me is so much more palpable, then was this carpers of the Preacher, because I saide, that the putting of Womens attire vpon men, may kindle sparkes of lust in vncleane affections: I saide not, in all mens affections, but in some; not in sanctified, but in vncleane. What? And doe you graunt, that you, and your youth, haue vncleane affections, to the intent you may blame my speech? If not, why tell you me, that the putting of womanlie raiment vpon men, hath not stirred any such beastlie thought in any of you; whe I spake expreslie of vncleane affections? Besides, can you accuse your selfe, or anie other, of anie wanton thought stirred vp in you by looking on a beautifull Woman? If you can; then ought you beware of beautifull boyes transformed into wome by putting on their raiment, their feature, lookes and facions. For men may be ravished with loue of stones, of dead stuffe, framed by cunning grauers to beautifull womens likenes; as, in  299 Poets fables appeareth by Pygmalion , by  300 Venus Gnidia in stories: and  301 Ch aerea , araied like an Eunuch onely, did moove the beastlie lust of him who was lasciviouslie giuen in the Comedie. If you can not: then doe you both me, your selfe and others, iniurie in cocluding, that therefore you should most vncharitably be wronged, if your putting on of Womanly raiment, should either directlie or indirectlie be referred to the commaundement, Thou shalt not comit adulterie . For my speech was generall, that the cladding of youthes in such attire is an occasion of drawing  & provoking corruptlie minded men to most heinous wickednes, & therefore should be wiselie cutt off by the faithfull: as if, in a Sermon to the vniversitie, expounding that of Iob, 302 I made a covenant with mine eyes , I should tell the Students, that though he name a maide , wee must extende the lesson farder; by  303 the mans example, whom a worthie governour, in  304 other wordes to like effect, admonished of making a covenant with his eyes, for saying; O puerum pulchrum Pericle . Wherevppon if anie should tell his acquaintance of this, or that College, Tutour, or other, accustomed to cast his eyes on such children as God had adorned with comelines of body, that I went about to make them suspected of most horrible lewdenes, he should doe both them and me notorious iniurie. Albeit, as our Sauiour, saying to his Disciples,  305 Take heede What you heare , did purpose to stirre them vp to marke diligentlie that which he delivered,  & faithfullie to performe it; yet codemned them not as retchlesse or vnfruitfull hearers of his worde: so I would acknowledge that in saying likewise, Take heede what you see , my meaning were to stirre vp both Tutours, and all other, to carie them selues chastlie, euen in their lookes also, least death come in by their windowes, though I meane no more to make them suspected by this admonition, then I doe my selfe. Which if you, who touch me so bitterlie, and often, for doeing you or yours vncharitable wrong, had charitably marked: I should haue lesse cause of wishing you to play the  306 Physician better,  & first to heale your selfe. This I say not onelie of my generall speeches sett vpon the racke to make me odious to your Studentes: but of the particular too, that may be thought to concerne them specially. As namelie that I mentioned Eurymachus kissing of Melantho: a thing which I gathered to haue bin done by  307 her own words: sith they were both inteded to be alone secretlie, when he had 308 fowle vnmodest lascivious talke with her; and the musicke  & daunsing,  309 whereof she speakes withal, was represented on the stage. But I named them onelie for example sake; my drift being generall against such playes as expresse such actions: whether sett foorth presentlie by you, as your Rivales, in which some of the wooers perhaps kissed Phoedra ; or heretofore, as  310 that of Plautus , in which  311 Ph aedromus kissed Planesium without perhaps. Wherefore sith you defende your former playes as well as these, and in that respect commende by name Plautus , as you haue great reason, comparing any Comedie of his with your Rivales: what aymed you at in saying, that, for the daunger of kissing beautiful boyes you know not howe the suspicion should reach vnto you, because it is vntrue that Eurymachus kissed Melantho ; vnlesse your meaning were to practise that malice (so  312 learned men doo iustlie terme it) of rhetorike , I meane, by restraining my generall intent vnto your present players, to draw me into their hatred? Else, when you enquired of the parties them selves, Whether any such action were used by them, and they (you say) denyed it constantly: why did you not enquire also of Plautus , whether it were vsed by Ph aedromus , & Planesiu , and of the ancients of your house, whether Phoedromus and Planesium came euer on your stage? Sure you should haue take this course by the equitie of that which semeth reasonable to you in your own cause. For, spying by mine answer, that your example of Achilles wearing womans raiment, did not serue your turne: you replie, that we may imagine such a one as will serue it, with change of a circumstance . And this in your defense must goe for sufficient. But the case is altered, when it toucheth me: yea, although my purpose may be prooved by true, not by imagined, examples. So indulgent commonly are men vnto them selues: so rigorous vnto others. Howbeit, I should not complaine of this rigour, but for the taile of it, and the sting of breeding euill will among brethren, which doeth lurke therein. The venome and poyson whereof goeth about to spred it selfe abroad through more partes of your body, then Phemius, Eurymachus ,  & the players of women; by meanes that you likewise instill the same humour, at least seeke to instill it as much as in you lieth, into the rest of all your players, their teachers and instructors, and in conclusion your whole house. For whereas the third branch of our reasons, set downe by you in Momus his name against playes, had avouched not onelie their time to be misspent who were employed therein, but some of their persons, their mindes, corrupted also; and I, to shewe how cunninglie you, encountring this proposed the losse of time alone and not of men, did declare that Cyprian writing of a stage- player, who made boyes effeminate by instructing them howe to play the women, and to expresse and counterfeit vnhonest wanton gestures, saith, he was a maister not of teaching but spilling children ; and thereof did inferre, that the losse of time should not haue bene obiected so much against your playes, seeing some of the players (if they were like the youthes whom Cyprian speaketh of) might replie as Ph aedria , when Parmeno did tell him that his gift bestowed on Thais would be lost, Ego quoque un a pereo, quod mihi est carius; ne istuc tam iniquo patiare animo: beholde, with how charitable applying of my wordes you come in thus vpon me, The saying of Saint Cyprian against a stage-player, or of Ph aedria of him selfe to Parmeno, can not be iustlie used against vs. For he should doe vs great contumelie, that should thinke, or say, that either we are maisters not of teaching, but spilling children; or that both time and our young men were cast away altogether by those exercises . And to make a deeper impression in your young men that I doe them this contumelie, with an other also brought for proofe hereof: you goe forward thus: But it is no marveile that you imply so ill a coceite of them, if you doubt that, as I answered Momus, our actors can shew greater fruit of their time well spent, then any that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can. For you pray God that they may: as doubting it is not so . Wherein, first and formost, if your conscience tell you, that your selfe (for whom else you associate to you by we are maisters , I know not) are touched in Saint Cyprians reproofe of the stage-player: I can no way helpe it, saue with that of Scripture,  313 If your heart condemne you, God is greater then your heart, and knoweth all thinges . But whether I might not alleadge Saint Cyprians wordes, to shewe that somewhat more then time is cast away and spilt by such stage-playes as make boyes effeminate: let our betters iudge. Who, I trust, will not condemne the poore swalowes for chattering and vsing their voice, agreeably to nature, because  314 Bessus surmised they cried against him that he had killed his father. Next, in that you charge me with insinuating of your young men, that both time and them selues are cast away altogether by those exercises , and adde, it is no marveile that I imply so ill a conceyte of them: truelie, it is marveile, that you, professing so much good will to mee as you doe, should in so fewe wordes vse so manie trickes of calumniation to breed a misliking of me in your yong men. One, by making me to speake of them at large, and indefinitlie: whereas I noted onelie such as played the Women, and of them such onelie, as were taught to counterfeit vnhonest wanton gestures, that is, as played vnchast women. An other, by adioyning the particle  315 Altogether , as if I had iudged them dead, dead, past all recouerie: whereas the  316 termes I used imported that they were in spilling, not spilt, much lesse spilt altogether, but like  317 the thinges in Sardis which were redy to dye . A third, by suppressing the meanes of their spilling, to weet, the making of them effeminate , which I specified; and by setting downe a woord of more honest and common signification in steed thereof, to weet,  318 exercises: as who say that peremptorie sentence had bene giuen of all, euen them who played mens partes, yea the best mens; where I censured onelie the filth of playing wanton queanes so with Cyprian . A fourth, by rehearsing it as absolutelie pronounced: where I with a  319 codition restraining the sentence, did manifestlie shewe that I affirmed it not, except they tooke like harme with those whom Cyprian speaketh of; and therefore drew my speach from your speciall players, to the generall question. A fifth, by making proofe thereof, as good and sound, as the thing proved; in saying, It is no marveile that I imply so ill a conceit of them, if I doubt that your actors can shew greater fruit of their time well spent then anie that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can: and yeelding this reason to perswade the young men that I doubt it is not so , because I pray God that they may . Which reason if it holde: then our Oxford Preachers haue a badd opinion of the Uice-chancelour, the Doctours, the Proctors, the Heades of houses: for they are wont to pray that we may be good; and therefore by your inference they doubt we are not so. And will not your Christ-church Preachers be discredited hereby with your Studentes, as much as I am: seeing they pray commolie as well for the Studentes, as for the Deane and Probendaries? Questionlesse your selfe would thinke, hee did you iniurie who should say you beleeue not an article of your faith, the forgiuenesse of sinnes . Yet you are accustomed to pray,  320 Forgiue vs our sinnes , when notwithstanding  321 hee that doubteth, faileth in beleefe. And for mine owne part, if to one comending the French most Christian King , that he can looke wiselie inough to his owne safetie against both open force,  & secret fraude of the Leaguers, I should aunswere (in like sorte as I did to you) I pray God hee may; sure he shall the better if hee neuer trust them, nor anie of that brood of the whore of Babylon: I would be vnderstoode, both hartilie to wish, and reasonablie to hope, that hee shall meetelie well be able to doe it; although the more able, if hee vse this caution. Or, if some presumptions moved you to dowt whether I meant thus, or worse: you should haue remembred the  322 rules of your law for  323 gentle construying of things doubtfull . But suppose that I had even denied also, not onely doubted, that your actors can shewe greater fruit of their time well spent then anie that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can: is it therfore likelie that I imply so ill a conceit of them as that they are altogether cast away? Yea, you say. And why? Because they could doe little, if they could not doe so much, and a great deale more, and better, when soever they shall be tryed. For what is the discipline of Momus, but the schoole of carping, nipping, depraving, and reprehending of everie good thing? Wherevpon you adde, to amplifie the straunge iniquitie of my dealing, that of all other things you thought I would not, or could not haue taken anie exception to that speech of yours . In deed if I had taken the discipline of Momus in that sense you give it; your so ill collection of my so ill conceit should haue some probabilitie. But I had declared that by the name of Momus you noted all reproovers of playes. And howsoever that be, wherof more hereafter: dowtlesse I meant scholers trained vp by such in godlinesse and good learning, when I prayed that your actors might shew greater fruit of their time well spent, then any that is bredde vp by Momusses discipline can . Which is plaine and evident by the words following, in that I affirmed, that this which you terme the discipline of Momus, is not his but Cyprians, or rather the holy Ghosts . For God forbid that you should proceede from evill to worse in such excesse of sclandering, as to tell your actors, that I say, the discipline of the holy Ghost is the schoole of carping, nipping, depraving, & reprehending of every good thing . Now, though my coceit of them be so good, that I am perswaded, or rather knowe in part, they can shew great fruit of their time well spent, and haue in triall done it: yet I know withall some of so great towardnes brought vp by the other, that, if all your actors think they can shew greater fruit the any of these, they will make mee thinke their good conceit of themselves is worse the mine ill. And see of how different opinions you and I are about this matter. I know sundry scholers of rare expectatio and hope in other Colleges, for whom my prayer is they may shew as great fruit of their time well spent as some of these can: and yet in my iudgement I haue no ill conceit of them. You, vnlesse I thinke that your Christ-church actors can shew much greater fruit, doe iudge, and giue sentence, that my conceit of them is ill: so ill, beyond all huy and cry, that it is a token I imply in couert speech (expounded charitably) that they are cast away, yea, cast away altogether, and irrecoverably lost. Lesser is the wrong, yet a wrong also, that of your actors likewise you say, they are condemned by me to hatefull infamie, a thing to all honest mindes more intollerable then death it selfe: and farther, that your house, your selfe, and many honest towardly young men, your frendes, whom for good causes you hartely loue, are charged with open infamie . It may be, the circumstance noted herewithall, in that you adde it greeveth you and them not a litle, that they should in private, but much more in publike, bee charged with such infamie: hath reference to the Sermon rather which was preached in the publike audience of the vniversitie, then to letters written in private vnto you. Howbeit, whethersoeuer of vs it toucheth more, your complaint is somewhat partiall to your selfe: who take in euill parte, that wee by word or writing should teach or mainteine ought wherof there may grow infamie by consequent to you; yet would haue vs take it well and patientlie, that you haue set foorth and published that in print, whereof there may grow infamie by consequent to vs. But the wrong I meant you doe mee in those clauses of your accusation, concerneth both the matter of crime, and the persons: the matter, for aggravating the qualitie of the note of infamie, whiche they are charged with, by terming it hatefull, open, more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe: the persons, for extending it from a few members to the whole bodie, from the players to your house. Concerning the later (to begin with it) beside that you say that in aunswering my writing you defende your house , not onelie the particular players, from infamie: you adde that they are charged therewith to the generall reproch of your house, if so hard a censure should be by men of note enforced and perswaded . And why should you more interpret our action to the generall reproche of your house, because wee reproved that by worde or writing which some of Christchurch had practised: then wee interpret yours to the generall reproche of our house, because you defended that by printed treatise, which some of Queenes college had reprooved? If the reason bee, for that wee are men of note who worke the discrediting of you: they are men of note too, whose verses you hauing prefixed before your book, doe countenance your disgrace of vs. Nether doe I see what reason else you bring, or can, but that wee shall meete you in the same (speake of consent, or what you list) to wring out of the speciall reproche of your players the generall of your house. As for the former concerning the infamie, the qualitie whereof not content to amplifie with termes that may bee common to all infamie in a so [illeg.], you name it more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe: whether doe you meane the infamie they are charged with by the Civil law , in the first reason; or that which lighteth on them by the lawe of God, in the reasons folowing? If by the civill law: then belike a chast and honestlie minded woman, who having lost her husband doeth marrie within twelue moneth after his decease, had rather shee were dead: and her father likewise, who placeth her so in mariage, had rather he were dead with her. For both these are noted with infamie by the 324 civill law: 2nd that in such degree, as may be more intollerable and greevous vnto them, for ought that I saide, then vnto your players. If by the law of God: doe you not know that  325 infamie being opposit to  326 good fame, and nothing being counted of  327 good fame,  328 praeseworthy , but that which is honest, iust, pure, vertuous ; every fault hath infamie, annexed therevnto; not everie fault a litle degree and height of infamie, but everie fault infamie? Doe you not thinke that all your players haue some fault: and account the shame thereof to bee more tollerable a great deale, then death? Doe you not confesse (though tempering it with saying it may be so perhaps ) that they haue in their playing picked out as it were quailes eyes of a wantonnes, and offended in some small matter? What needed then your tragicall exaggeration of hatefull open infamie, more intollerable to all honest mindes then death it selfe: when al that I enforced against them was but infamie? whom sought you to make hatefull by that patheticall speech, tending to compassion of Ulysses in shew, to somewhat else in deede: Unhappy Ulysses, to whom as it was fatall ever to be in trouble in his life, so is he more hardly dealt withall after his death, that his person may not honestly bee resembled without note of infamie to the actor? Howe skilfull an inveigling is this of your players, to thinke themselves defamed most odiouslie for euer, when he who played Ulysses parte, one of the best, and therefore least of all touched with that note, is said to bee so touched with it, that all the troubles of Ulysses are nothing to his shame? Nay, the shame inflicted on him who played Ulysses , is such a vexation to Ulysses himselfe, that hee is more hardly dealt withall herein (poore soule) after his death, then while in his life time  329 his sweete wine was drunke, his men were eaten vp, two at a meale, by Polyphemus ; himself escaped hardlie through Polyphemus rammes helpe out of his clouches, not without great feare, I know, when Polyphemus talked with the ramme; and beside the danger to bee soonke and drowned by the top of a mountaine that Polyphemus hurled at him,  330 hee was tossed in the sea, vpon broken peeces of his shippe, beeing wracked, ten nights and nine dayes, saue one wherin he stucke fast to a wild figtree growing in Charybdis ; whereof, and of a great deale more  331 such woe, he tasted, by  332 his mens vnhappie letting out of the windes, which Æ olus had giuen him bound vppe in a leathren bagge or satchell. To make an end of this point, I am to request your Students and your house, because you constraine me (that I may vse the  333 Prophets phrase) to restore that which I tooke not away , that they wil consider how the note of infamie, which I did enforce, I enforced it against the partes played by Histrio , not against the Christchurch parties who played them; against Roscius & Æsopus , not against the Maister of your Choristers; I meane against players, not against those players: as  334 Tullie saith of Piso , that when the  335 Romans gaue him the office of the Æ dileship, they gaue it to Piso, not to this Piso ; meaning that in committing such place of honour to him they respected the dignitie of his name and stocke, not the qualities of his person. For as this Piso , the particular man, was lewde, base, dishonorable; yet Piso , the kinred it selfe, whereof hee came, was honorable and renowmed: semblablie may players, the generall that I spake of, bee esteemed infamous; and yet the same infamie, as small as it is in comparison of the capitall markes you fasten on it, be lesse or none at all in the speciall persons of your house, of those players. Which, if it be lawfull for me to compare lesser things with greater (as I, by the example of  336 our Sauiours parables alwayes thought I might,  & neuer heard them called incomparable comparisons till you controlled mee with this taunt and the like for vsing them) I shall make plaine vnto you by the cleere euidence  & light of both those laws, whence they are charged. For  337 wicked persons are infamous;  338 idolaters are wicked; they, that offer incense, as  339 Paynims did, are idolaters.  340 Certaine Christian souldiers, not knowing what such offering of incense did import, were by the conveyance of Iulian the apostata brought to offer it. Who, when they were afterward informed, what they had done, returned backe to Iulian, professing and protesting them selues to be Christians, persisting in the faith, and praying they might die for it. Were these infamous for that fact? No: because their hande did offend through ignorance (saith the  341 Ecclesiasticall historie) their minde was pure and guiltlesse . And although their ignorance of  342 the law was faultie, the mother of their errour: yet  343 mans constitutions bearing with souldiers that way, and  344 God forgiving his servants greater ouersights, who dare condemne them for their fall? Those monsters of nature, which  345 burning in their lust one toward an other, men with men worke filthines, are as infamous, as  346 Sodome: not the doers onelie, but the  347 sufferers also. A  348 yong Italian Gentleman, named Cosmus Cherius, had that horrible villanie wrought through force vpon him by Petrus Aloisius Pope Paul the thirds sonne . Was he infamous for his suffering? No more then  349 Lucretia for violence done by Tarquin , how soeuer he died for sorowe and shame of it: the law of  350 God and  351 man both will acquitt him. In a woord,  352 all impious and vnhonest wretches, namelie the vnrighteous, fornicatours, adulterous, theeves, covetous, drunkardes, raylers, extortioners, are infamous. The  353 Corinthians had bene such, but they repented. Were they infamous for their vices? A  354 natural man might sticke hereat in  355 some part: but Saint Paul denieth it. For  356 he saieth, they were sanctified, holy, washed, iustified: and such as are cleansed from the filth of sinne, are cleansed from the blemish  & reproch thereof; no iust and holy man is infamous. In the like sorte therefore may a note of infamie remayne vpon players: and yet bee removed as farr from your players, as is the East from the West. For what if some of them knew not this point of law? and were of such  357 age too (which they were all perhaps, at least the players of wemens partes) as the  358 lawe excuseth for ignorance therof? What if others were commanded to play by their superiours, whom they durst not displease; and so were in a maner  359 inforced therevnto; excused by 360 Tullie for  361 necessitie? What if a third sorte, or more, euen these also, haue since repented their playing, and thereby washed them selues, and made them selves cleane? Or if neither ignorance, nor force, nor repentance, had either diminished that ignominious blott, or cleane abolished it; the contrarie whereof  362 I am perswaded by the good nature, and honest ingenuitie of such of the parties as I knowe; but if they had not: yet I being taught to presume the best by him who sayeth that  363 charitie beleeueth all things, hopeth all things , was to deeme they had, and so I doe still. Yea, although you saye it greeueth them not a little that they should in private, but much more in publike, be charged with infamie , I beleeue and hope so much the better of them: knowing that there is a  364 griefe to repentance , which the Lorde worketh in his by such reproofes; and it was well with  365 Peter , whe he wept bitterlie . Wherefore hauing this perswasion of your players, euen of them for whose partes I charged playes most, namelie Hippodamia, Melantho , the Nyph, Ph aedra , & her Nurse ; if I should haue noted them as infamous, them I saye, not their partes, these players and not players; I should haue taken on me the iudgement that belongeth vnto the searcher of heartes and reines, and spoken against mine owne conscience. Which if you haue made them beleeue I loue them so ill, by reason of the bad conceit I haue of them, that I would doe of spite and malice to discredit them: yet lett me intreat them to thinke I loue my selfe better, then that I would through their sides wounde mine owne; who, when I was about the age that they are, six and twentie yeares since, did play a womans parte vpon the same stage, the part of Hippolyta . As for you, who pretending in your proposition you would assay to shewe that the trueth in this controuersie belongeth rather to your aunswers, then to the reasons fathered on Momus , doe afterward endeuour in your confutation to obscure  & darken the trueth with mistes of pitie and humane affectios, inculcating that it would be a contumelie to this or that youth with manie, vnlesse the cause be wonne on your side: lett mee intreat you likewise to regard hereafter, if not my most reasonable petition and desire, yet your owne conclusion; who, saying you may graunt without offence, you trust, that your censure of Momus in the generalitie lighteth vpon me , doe adde these woordes to proove it; For the maine matter is not, whether you had occasion to thinke your self to bee touched in the generalitie , or no, being of that opinion you are, but whether the opinion bee iustifiable , or no. Which point if you remember in your next replie, though next replie rather I need not much to feare if this point be remembred, no more then Cato needed to feare Galbas aunswere, who had bene condemned except he had vsed boyes & teares , as  366 Cato wrote; but, had you remembred it in your last replie: you might haue induced me the more easilie to hearken vnto your advise and request, that I should rather deale with you by private conference then by furder writing, if you had greatlie erred in any thing. For the trueth and equitie of that which I said in defense of the reasons fathered on Momus to the reproofe of playes, is so vndoubted and manifest of it selfe; that men of vnderstanding and sense, who should compare your replie with it, must (though I kept silence) needes perceyue your stomake was sick of that  367 hunger, which for an inordinate appetite it breedeth,  368 Physicians call  369 the dogged appetite: more greedily disposed to deuoure and swallow vp all that it mett with, then able to concoct or to retaine well ought that it had taken. A proofe heereof you giue in your verie beginning by crossing of my proeme. Wherein I hauing thanked you for that by enlarging your aunswere to Momus, you shewed why you thought our reasons to be naught, sith that your reprooving thereof did touch mee also, who tooke them not to bee rascall reproches, as you termed them, but sound reasons: euerie braunch hereof you carpe and checke. But how? First, where I had written, that as our Saviour, when he was smitten by one for speaking naught but reason, saide, If I haue spoken evill, beare witnesse of the evill; but if well, why doest thou smite me? so they, whose obiections against playes you attributed to the person of Momus, might iustlie saye in my iudgement, If our reasons be naught, discouer their naughtines; if good, why doe you Mome vs? You replie, that no man can rightlie say to you, If our reasons bee naught, discouer their naughtines; if good, why doe you Mome vs? as Christ might truely say, If I haue spoken euill, beare witnes of the evill; but if well, why doest thou smite me? because he vndoubtedlie had said nothing but reason, and therefore was most vniustlie smitten; but the obiections in your case and against you, are most vntrue, and there is no man smiten by you . Then which speech of yours (I pray you be not offended with me for my plainesse) I neuer read anie, to my remembrance, more voide of reason. For our Sauiours dilemma (according to  370 the naturall force of that argument) was made to apprehend and holde fast his aduersarie whether soeuer him selfe had spoken, euill, or well. So that, when the  371 two theeues, who suffered with Christ, and  372 deserued death, were brought into iudgement, in case the iudge had offered to giue sentence against them  373 before they heard why, they might haue iustlie saide, If we haue robbed any, beare witnesse of our robberie; if not, why doe you condemne vs? Wherfore when, to reproove the former part of my dilemma , you affirme that no man can rightlie saye vnto you, If our reasons bee naught, discouer their naughtines, because Christ vndoubtedlie had saide nothing but reason: vndoubtedly your selfe doe speak beside all reason. As much in a manner, as beside the trueth, when to reprooue the later part thereof you adde, that you doe Mome no man . For so must I interpret your wordes of smiting no man: or else you speake beside all reason herein too, when vpon my citing Christes wordes, Why doest thou smite me , by way of similitude to your Moming vs , you say, no man is smitten by you . But that some are smite by you with Momus name, euen all reproovers of playes, and so (which is the next branch you plucke at) my selfe; I shewed by the meaning of the tale of Momus , opened out of Aristotle , ioyned with your applying thereof vnto a person who chargeth playes as we doe. To the refutation whereof it maketh nothing, that when you declared you did enlarge therefore your aunswer vnto Momus, because I and others had asked why the thinges by him obiected were not answered , you say that by others you meant some of your friends , not reprovers of playes: and that you had no purpose to touch me in particular, nor knew, when you conceyued and penned the devise of Momus , that I had reprooved them. For was it the man in the moone, trow we, whose  374 rascall reproches , or (as you correct it) triviall and common, you put in the mouth of Momus , and made your Epilog controll them? Or was it some on earth, whose speeches, being noted by you as commo and taunting, doe argue that they had one or more authours, not friendes, but adversaries of playes? Moreouer, when you tell me, that till you vnderstoode it by me and by a Preacher of late, you neuer thought that either I, or anie other, in the Universitie had abbetted Momus obiections: doe you not confesse, that, ere you wrote this, you vnderstood it of vs two? And can you perswade your selfe that we twoo alone, and no body else, are abbetters of them? Nay, doe you not signifie that you see there are more, when, speaking of others , you saye you meant not such, as you perceyue by me there are, who should mislike your playes ; and by way of opposing me and them to Many , you name vs One or a Few? You acknowledge then, that notwithstanding your selfe meant not these by others , yet certaine such there are. Neither can your vsing the devise of Criticus & Zoilus in like maner to rebuke the carpers of your owne Tragedie as curious and malitious, permit you to denie with anie colour of probabilitie that you meant to note these by Momus name. Chieflie nowe that you haue expreslie fastened it on them in your replie: saying in excuse of the time, the Sunday, whereon your Tragedie was played, that some of them, it may bee, who misliked your playes, were worse occupied then your actors were on the same night, playing Momus part in good earnest before you, which you did afterward but for pastime . Wherefore your complayning that you knowe not whom, nor very well what, I meane by They & Us , in that I said, They whose obiections, and, Why doe you Mome vs , is frivolous and idle, to say no worse of it: frivolous, because you know I meane the Preacher, my self, and all abbetters of Momus his obiections: idle, because albeit you knew not whom I meane, yet my speech is sound, that, They, whose obiections against playes, you attributed to the person of Momus, might iustlie say in my iudgement, If our reasons be naught, discouer their naughtines; if good, Why doe you Mome vs? More idle and frivolous is your labouring to perswade me, that I had no iust occasion to suspect that your purpose was therein to touch me, to taxe me in particular ; both by discoursing that those two inducements, to weet, my reproving of Theater-sights and stage-playes in the Preface of my Thesis, and my reasons giuen thereof in letters to D. Thornton, which I (so you affirme) did chieflie alleadge to proove my coniecture, are not enough to proove it, in as much as you had not read the one of the, nor heard of the other: and by most earnestlie avouching coram Deo (as if an  375 oath needed to cleare you from my wrongfull opinion and surmise) that your meaning onely was to moove delite in the auditorie, with the noveltie of the invention, and the person; and to obiect those things against your selues by your selues, Which might abate all suspicion of vaine glorie or selfe-pleasing in you; and so by this meanes, as it were with a slight, to shift of all occasion of others ill speaking, whe you had prevented them with as ill as mought be . I saye, this is more idle and frivolous then the former, because I was so farre from making any shew of suspecting my selfe to be touched purposely by you in particular: that contrariwise I signified I thought my self touched, not so, but in generall; by the censure lighting, not in your intent, but in event, vpon me. And for this respect alone, not for the other, did I alleadge those writings of mine , whiche you mention; to proove, not a coniecture thereby, but a cettaintie, that I was a reproover of playes; and therefore sith you meant to note all such reproovers vnder the name of Momus , as I shewed withall, must needes thinke my selfe to bee touched therein. Which also I deliuered with such care of plainesse and perspicuitie, distinguishing eftsoones your intent of noting no particular man from your generall note touching mee by consequent, that as on the one parte you could not choose but graunt that I had occasion to thinke my self touched in the generalitie; likewise of the other, you were enforced to see, that I gaue no token of anie way suspecting you to haue intended particularlie to taxe me. In so much that your selfe, encoutring as it were your discourse thereof, acknowledge it expresselie with these very wordes; But that I had no purpose by Momus side to wound you, according to the law of charitie, vpon my former protestation, you doe most gladly credit mee, as you write ; and with these, The matter is cleered in your good minde ; thus your selfe commende mee, and hartily thanke mee for it . A strange kinde of dealing to charge a man with thinking amisse of your purpose, who, by your owne confession, thinketh rightly of it; to touch him as breaking the lawe of charitie through false surmises, who keepeth it in your owne iudgement; to take the name of God for effecting with him by new protestation, that which your former protestation, your selfe saye, had obtained of him; by manifest misconstruction to presse out of his writing a point whereof hee writeth the contrarie, as your selfe witnesse; to controll a thing as misdeemed by him vppon erroneous coniecture, which your owne conscience testified to you, and your owne mouth to others, that it is cleered in his minde ; finally to pretend, that being assaulted by one who sought your life, you were compelled to enter a long combat with him, when you graunt straightwayes vpon the ende thereof that no man did assault you; it was a post onelie, whereon you sett a helmet to make it seeme a man, that so by valiant foyning at it, and hacking of it, you might gett the creditt of having slaine an enemie, and left him in the place as dead as a doore naile. The  376 Physicians note, that such as are diseased with that kinde of hungrie sicknes, which I mentioned, haue a greedy appetite to bee eating still: but being vnable to keepe that they haue eaten, doe cast it vp by vomit; and then eate more, and vomit againe; and eate eftsoones, and vomit. How like a distemper you are fallen into, through desire of swalowing vp  & contradicting all that I had written, which yet your want of strength to hold and maintaine doeth force you to regorge and yeelde: your going onward in this course bewrayeth farder. For I, to shew how all reproovers of playes are noted as vniust reproovers by your tale of Momus , declared out of Aristotle , that it was devised to checke such as reprooue vnjustly the best and perfitest workes of the most wise and skilfull . You reply that you brought him not in so much in that sense that Aristotle speaketh of, as a reproover of the best and perfitest workes of the most wise and skilfull; for I never tooke (say you) either our selves, or our playes to bee such: but as wee commonly take him as a carper, and a pincher at all thinges that are done with any opinion of well dooing . Wherein with one breath you overthwart, and graunt, the purport of my speech. You overthwart it in saying that you brought Momus in, as we comonly take him ;  & opposing this point to the point I mentioned, Not in that sense that Aristotle speaketh of, but thus: You graunt it in confessing that you brought him in also in that sense, though not so much in that sense: which I said not you did so much, but only that you did it. And albeit herein by gainesaying me with your, Not , and But , you may seeme to charge me with saying that you brought him in so much in that sense: yet you meant rather by cunning interlacing of those words, so much , closely to discharge your mouth of a morsel, which you had taken in, and felt it overhoott and burning. For having alleaged  377 the very same that Aristotle , howe Momus carped Nature, the Creatour of all things , that is, God, I trow, the most wise and skilfull framer of the best and perfitest workes: you adde, that  378 after this sort, Momus (whom you bring in) though dooing nought him selfe, yet carpeth at the best; and hath with these and these tants declaimed against your playes . So, whereas your reason, that you never tooke your selves or your playes to be such , should import that you brought him not in at all in that sense; and then had I affirmed amisse, that you rehearsed the tale to such purpose: your ground thereof alayed with the termes, so much , implieth that you grant, that the thing it self, which I affirmed, is true, and that you were disposed to playe by this conveyance a iugling tricke of fast and loose. Againe, whereas I noted that you called our reasons, attributed to Momus, rascall reproches , vsing the English words to expresse your Latin, probra arrepta ex triviis: first you wish I had not so tanslated it, for that the wordes in Latin naturally sound not so hardly ; yet afterward you graut that you know the words may be so properly translated . Wherof in the later how manifestly you cast vp that which you swalowed in the former, appeereth by your labouring to cofirme the former, what with  379 Alciats saying, that wordes must bee generally taken so farre foorth as their proprietie may beare ; what with your owne denying that  380 probra arrept ae ex triviis doe most properly and principally signifie rascall reproches. Most properly, and principally ; a like feate in adding to the worde properly, most, and principally , as before in thrusting in the termes, so much: sith neither in the clause, which answereth to this, you ioyne most with naturally ; nor say out of Alciat , that wordes must be taken as their most principall proprietie may beare (though by an  381 other note of his,  382 displaced cunningly, and racked herevnto, it seemeth you would faine imply it) but as their proprietie . Howbeit, if I list to presse you therein also, perhaps the same phrase, arripere maledictum ex trivio , vsed by  383 Tullie , and compared with Alciats meaning of most proper and principall signification , would proue that probra arrepta ex triviis doe most properly and principally signifie rascall reproches . Sure they haue bene deemed skilfull of both languages, who taking on them to deliver the principall and most proper signification of Latin wordes, haue Englished maledictum arreptum ex trivio, 384 a reproche or tant, which is commonly spoken by every railing knaue , or, 385 that is common in euerie verlets mouth: and what doeth this, I pray you, differ from rascall? But sith your selfe acknowledge that wordes naturally doe sound and signifie that which they signifie properly , and that these in question may bee translated properly as I did translate them: you shew that in affirming they doe not naturally sound so hardly , you controlled as false that which your selfe knew to be true, yea, which you needes must so acknowledge. In like sort doe you crosse me, nay, you crosse your selfe, when in an other enditement that you drawe against me for the same Englishing of your Latin, to weet, that though the wordes may bee so properly translated, yet not to your minde so properly , that is, not so gently as you meant them , and therefore I did mistranslate them: you say that in lawe and reason they are ever to bee interpreted according to their natural and proper signification, vnlesse we coniecture that hee who speake them meant otherwise ; and no man can iustly coniecture that you meant to vse any honest man with so ill termes, when you meant no man at all . See the pitifull taking of such as seeke devises to bolster out vntruths for their credits sake: who by those very shifts, by which they hope to scape, are oftentimes entangled, and as it were with nettes or chaines entrapped faster. Your owne affirmation, that you meant no man at all , doeth giue mee iust cause of coniecturing that you meant to vse the terme of rascall, as well as of reproches , be they never so ill. For in that you say, that you meant no man at all , you intend your former speech, that you meant Momus onely. Nowe you charged Momus with a 386 filthie toung, an 387 ougly face, a 388 stinking breath, an 389 ill favored gastly rammish bush of heare: and can no man iustly coniecture that you meant to vse him with so ill termes, as rascall reproches? You called him a 390 spirit, an impious carper of the Gods, of men, and of nature, a person therefore odious and detestable to the Gods, and to the best men: and can no man iustly coniecture that you meant to vse him with so ill termes, as rascall reproches? You reported of him that  391 hee defileth all thinges with the vncleane touch of his toung ; that  392 he is vnskilfull, dull, or sottish rather: & can no man iustly coniecture that you meant to vse him with so ill termes, as rascall reproches? But what doe I reason out of your former writing that I had cause to thinke so: when your selfe, in this, doe giue most euident  & cleere tokens that you meant so? For you say expressely that you made Momus to speake as ill as mought be; neither cared greatly what you made him say, as thinking any such thing became him well inough: nor talked otherwise of him, then as of a carper, a nipper, a depraver, and a reprehender of every good thing . And can you deny that your meaning was to speak of his reproches as rascall, base and contemptible, whom you made purposely to speak as ill as mought be, and cared not what you made him say? or dare you affirme you meant to vse him gently, whom you accuse of carping, nipping, depraving, and reprehending all good thinges , and doe rough hewe him in such sorte? You tell me that how words are to be taken in charitie I know better then you: but in law and reason they are to bee interpreted with this rule of the speakers meaning Belike because you weened that you had prooved herby, (chieflie having quoted thereto a  393 lawiers text,) that, look in what sense you say you meant your wordes, in that I must interpret them by law and reason: you thought that I was likewise in charitie bound to thinke that you meant them so, in as much as the scripture saieth,  394 Charitie beleeueth all things . But you should haue marked that the scripture saith also,  395 A foole beleeueth every thing: and he who exhorteth the faithful to be charitable, dehorteth them from doeing foolishlie,  396 Walke not as fooles, but as wise . A sure demonstration, that charitie is said to beleeue all things , not properlie, but in a figure; not simplie all, but a number; euen all that a good man in wisedome may beleeue. And to 397 beleeue vntruthes, is a point of follie; repugnant, as to wisedome, so consequentlie to charitie: which in the  398 same parcell of scripture is saide, not to reioyce in iniquitie, but to reioyce at the trueth . Wherefore seeing reason doeth shew by sundrie circumstances, that you say vntrulie, You meant not to vse so ill and hard termes, as rascall reproches ; and this is the naturall and proper signification of your Latin wordes, which therefore must be so interpreted by law: it were to be wished, that you learned better what charitie requireth, before you raise vncharitable suspicions of others as sinning against it whe they doe not; and then it might bee hoped you would no more pretend the name of law or reason, to plaister your vnreasonable and vnlawfull blaming of things deliuered rightlie according both to law and reason. 399 Pindarus sayth, that men who take workes in hande, must sett them forth with beautifull forefrontes and entrees . The lesse doe I marvell that you who make so badd a beginning of your worke, deale worse, if worse might be, and more perverslie in the rest. Whereof to reserue for their severall places the proofe that in a maner all the particulars yeeld; two generall kindes of seelie evasions and shiftes may serue for the first taste: one, that when you see your argumentes refuted, you denie them to bee yours; an other that you say, you vsed them not to vs, but to Momus ; and by this fine devise you neither aunswere Momus , nor vs. For examples sake, whereas to the obiection made out of the worde of God against your playes, that it is vnlawfull for men to put on womens raiment , you replied that it is not vnlawfull simply and alwayes, as if one doe it to save his life, to benefitt manie: I shewed that this reason is vnsound and naught:; A ma to saue his life or countrey, may doe it; He may doe it therefore to play a parte on a stage . Herevnto you answere, that you doe not thus argue, It is lawfull in such and such cases to putt on womens raiment; Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in playes: but thus; ergo it is not simplie vnlawfull so to doe . And did you argue thus in deed, neyther concluded you, that it is lawfull therefore to doe it in playes? Certes then you disputed valiantlie against Momus, who  400 reprooved playes because young men are cladde like maidens therein. But your whole discourse doeth argue that this argument whereof you are ashamed (well, if you would also ingenuouslie confesse it) was intended by you. For you professed that albeit you thought Momus rascall reproches against playes worthier to bee laughed at, then to bee refuted: 401 yet the weightiest of them you would in fewe wordes shake out of their ragges ; or whosoeuer you will translate your excutere , applied to those rascalls. Now by what consequence doeth your aunswer shake that reproche of his, vnlesse it conclude that men may be lawfully cladde in playes like wemen? Or who is so blinde that reading your reply, perceyueth not your  402 second Ergo , I say your second, For the  403 first (I graunt) concludeth, that it is not simply vnlawfull so to doe ; but the seconde Ergo , with the  404 assumption following, and the  405 Epiphonema , directlie do imply a contradicting of Momus ; and therfore a concluding out of the former point, that, because it is lawfull in such and such cases to put on Wemens raiment, Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in playes? What? And when you saide that  406 no apparell but the minde doeth make a man dishonest , meant you not that men may weare womens raiment with honestie in playes? Whe you concluded that 407 You list not wash away other things which Momus spake against you: did you not imply that heerein you had mett with his blaming you for young men made maidens on the stage? When you begged a  408 second Plaudite of the beholders, that the guttes of Momus might burst for spite asunder: sought you their approbation of Achilles changing his sexe to saue his life; or of Melanthos dooing it to feede theatricall humours? In the  409 Greek Epigrammes we read of two deafe men impleading one the other before a deafe iudge. Amongst whom when the plaintife obiected to the defendant, that hee ought him fiue moneths rent for his house, and the defendant answered that he was grinding corne at the mill that night: What a Gods name , quoth the iudge, what needeth this contention? Hath not eche of you a mother? Let eche finde his owne . I am glad, Mr D. Gager , that by your appealing to the iudgement of our betters, wee haue agreed on iudges who heare well inough. For they, vnderstading how your Ulysses redux is penned and was played, will iudge that you are not deafe: as  410 their like at Athens hauing heard Oedipus Coloneus read, a tragedie written by Sophocles , gaue sentence that he was not a sott or doting man. And therefore, though you tell them that in your reply, of grinding at the mill, you meant to proove onely that you hurt not Momus by seeking of his life or purse that night on Salsbery plaine: yet they, considering wiselie that you professed to aunswer his bill of complaint touching the fiue moneths rent, will think you argued thus against him; I was grinding corne at the mill that night, Ergo I owe him not fiue moneths rent for his house . Neither can I doubt but they will in like sort mislike your other practise, of saying that you spake not to vs but to Momus , and so slipping away with answering neither him, nor vs. As when you asked vs in Momus person, (so I tooke it) Dare ye despise learned poetrie? secretlie to inferre thereby your maine conclusion, that if learned poetrie may not be despised, your students may be actors of learned Poets playes ; and I out of St Paul did refell this argument: you reply that you asked not of me, or them, or any man but Momus, any such question . Which thing you doe not onely avouch vpon your word, affirming that you should be beleeued: but you cite your writing also to prove it, An tu Po esin despicere doctam audeas? Vrging that you said not, An vos ; but An tu . Manie greeuous panges of that hungrie sickenes, which, for the ymptomata of eating still and vomiting, Physicians (as I shewed) doe name the dogged appetit , appeare in your whole reply. But none more greeuous in any part thereof, then here, where, through the sharpnes and outrage of your humour, you fulfil that proverb, (your  411 intemperance forceth me to be more cruell, I meane, to vse more lothsome  & displeasant speeches then otherwise I would, speciallie to persons of your state and qualitie) you fulfill, I say, that proverb of Salomon, 412 A dogg returneth to his vomit . Yea, in so much worse sorte doe you suppe this againe vp, whiche you vomited before, of meaning neither mee nor anie other man in your reproofe of Momus: because you adde such reasons to proove you meant not vs in asking that questio, as your selfe must needes know you vttered but a sicke mans dreame. For (to beginne with the later, which is the stronger of them) your selfe doe acknowledge vpon my proofe thereof out of your owne wordes, that in  413 your reproofe of Criticus and Zoilus, whosoever findeth such fault with your Tragedie, as you controll them for, him you meant to note as a malitious Zoilus, and a carping Criticke . Yet the Criticke you speake to in the singular number, as well as to Momus: You answere to his sundrie checkes of your epistle, Rect e tu quidem ista, Critice, si scriberem epigrammata: you say not vos , but tu. You note him for his  414 wittie railing at your Tragedie, Profect o ipsum te esse Criticum oportet: you say not vos , but te. You detest his foolish  & quarelsome wranglings, Emoriar si amem lites, saltem criticas, id est futiles, id est tuas, Critice: you say not vestras , but tuas . You come vpon him eftsoones, againe, and againe, with  415 tu , and  416 tu , and tu ae ; and, Critice , as to one still: you saye not vos Critici, vos Critici , and vestr ae . Wherefore if notwithstanding your forme of speech to one in the singular number, you intended it to all, as curious carpers, who will be picking quarells at your Tragedie-writing: alas, What was become of your wittes and senses, when by such a cavill you thought to convince me, that, because you said not An vos , but An tu , you meant not  417 your speech to me and all others, as vniust reproovers, who will be finding fault with your enterlude-playing? Those  418 idole-pastors of the Church,  419 evill beastes, and slow-bellies, who  420 haue mouths, and speake not; eyes, and see not; feete, and goe not; who  421 feede themselves and not their flockes, but  422 take their ease in Sion ; doo seeke with faces harder then brasse, and hearts then adamant, to besott themselves, and perswade others, that  423 Christs reproofe of the wicked servant, which employed not the moony he receved as his maister charged him in trade and traficke to his advantage, belongeth not to them. But amongst their wretched excuses and defenses of their non-residence , though as lewde and brainesicke many, as this is, yet never heard I this; that Christ speaketh not to them; but to a losell who laid vp his mony in a napkin, because his wordes are, of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, o evill servant ; he saith not, of your own mouths, but of thine ; not, I will judge you, but thee . The covetous engrossers of wealth  & slaves of Mammon, who  424 ioyne house to house, and lay field to field, till there bee no place; whose 425 hope is their gold; whose  426 godlines their gaine, whose  427 meditation, What shall I doo? I will pull down my barnes and build greater, and therein will I gather all my fruits and my goods; and I will say to my soule, Soule, thou hast much goods laid vp for many yeares; liue at ease, eate, drinke, and be mery: these worldlings faine would flatter themselues with assurance of many yeares life, and much would they giue for a lease thereof. But I thinke they are not so full of  428 Nabals qualitie, that the Lords advertisement  429 o foole, this night shall thy soule be fetched away from thee , they will reiect by noting hee saith, thy soule from thee , he saith not, yours from you: and therevpon imagin they are not tenants at will, nor may bee turned out of their  430 houses of clay vpon an howres warning, nay vpon no warning giuen them at all. 431 Tullie maketh mention of some witty lawiers, who, because they found the name of Caia set downe for example sake in some autours bookes treating of a certaine solemnitie in betrothing, they thought that everie woman so betrothed and maried should be called Caia . A conceit, that seemed ridiculous to Tullie: yet coming farre behinde that which yours implyeth, that no other woman but Caia alone was meant in the treatise, and therefore none but shee might bee so betrothed. By consequence whereof if you had lived in those dayes, you must haue mainteined that it was not lawfull for any to bee maried but onely Iohn and Ioane , I would say Caius and Caia . For  432 the maner was that they, who brought the bride into the bridegromes house, did bid her vse this speech, Ubi tu Caius, ego Caia: not making any mention of Lucius and Lucia, Sempronius and Sempronia , but of Caius and Caia ; neither saying nos, & vos , but tu & ego . Nowe if the stronger of your reasons hinder not but your demande might bee made to vs: much lesse doeth the weaker. For whereas you tell vs, that you demanded not of me, or them, or any man but Momus, any such question, if you may be beleeued; as, why you should not, you see no cause: first how prooue you this, that you see no cause, why you should not bee beleeued? Forsooth because you were as sure (you say) that I or any learned man did not despise po etrie, as you were certaine that Momus did . O miserable blindnesse shall I say? or madnes, wherewith your humorous greedines of crossing me distracted you. As who say you had not so much the greater reason to aske vs such a question, because you were sure that wee did not despise poetrie. Else you must affirme that when Christ demanded,  433 What man shall there be among you that hath a sheepe, who, if it fall on a Sabbat day into a pit, will not take hold of it, and lift it out? Hee asked not any such question of the Phariseis , or Scribes , or any man, but your Momus brethren, that is, the men whom fansies imagine in the cloudes: because hee was as sure that the Phariseis or any wise man would not suffer his sheepe to lie in the pitt on the Sabbat day , as hee was certaine that the cloudes would. For if you perceaue that Christ , to make the Phariseis confesse that it is lawfull to heale a man on a Sabbat day , had reason to demand whether they would not lift vp their sheepe out of a pitt then, which hee knewe they would; that by granting this they might discerne the better they must needes graunt that: how could you choose but see, that your purpose being to make vs confesse, that comedies  & tragedies may bee lawfully played, you had like reason to aske whether wee did despise learned poetrie, which you were sure we did not; that by graunting this (you thought) wee might the rather be forced to graunt that. Wherefore sith even herein there was cause sufficient to make mee imagin that you did demande the question of vs: you should conclude rather that your sight was naught, who saw not so much, then that, because you saw it not, you should bee beleeued affirming the contrarie. Moreover, to admitt there was no cause herein why you should not be beleeved, yet might there bee in somewhat else: and such, as you should also haue easily espied, vnlesse the inordinate passion of your minde had daseled your sight. For your  434 law informed you that they, who are unconstant and light in their testimonies, must not be beleeued: Now, though you perceue not your own fault therein, as  435 Aristotle saith, Physicians beeing sicke can not discerne the trueth touching their owne diseases because of their distemper, and therefore doe they vse the helpe of other Physicians: the events of your hungry sicknes, which I noted, doe manifestly argue, that you wauered much in saying and vnsaying the same when you wrote to me. And how small account of yeelding to the trueth you make in these matters, you had shewed before when  436 you tolde Criticus , that  437 you know not whether those things be true , which hee obiecteth; and perhaps they are not farre from beeing true: yet are you disposed to goe against them, to crosse them . You might see cause therefore why you should not bee beleeved in that you affirme you demanded not of vs, or any man but Momus, any such question . Howbeit granting this, which you so wrastle for, what say you then to Momus ; I meane to the argument implied in your demaunde to him, and prooved by mine aunswere to bee naught and defectiue? Nay, not a worde to that. Onely, as if you would say that you were disposed to spurre him idle questions, and not to reason against him; or that, although the reason meant therein were naught, yet good enough for him whom you make a Mome and faine to your selfe a foolish adversarie, a thing that  438 Quintilian misliketh in declaimers; you say that you asked it of no man but of Momus . Thus in these generall and common kindes of miserable evasions and shifts through the mist whereof you would scape away: our iudges will acknowledge (I hope) that your intent was rather to seek corners for hiding of your fault, then to confesse your oversights and yeelde the victorie to the truth. Surely, for mine owne parte, your dealing doeth perswade mee that when you resolved to reply vpon mee, you thought with your selfe the same that you vttered in your epistle vnto Criticus: I know not whether these thinges bee true which he writeth; and perhaps they are not farr from being true ,  439 yet am I disposed to haue a crash against them. Yea, even for the branches and points wherevnto you stand in the particulars, the fower heades of reasons, neither denying their drift, the marke they armed at; nor excusing them as faire against Momus, though they come nothing neere the marke: albeit you deale with greater probabilitie, and therefore cary your selfe the bolder, yet deale you like your selfe, and lay still the colours of probabilitie on sophistrie. For whereas in the first, concerning the iudgement of the ancient Romans holding all stage-players infamous by their lawe, you saide that the Pr aetor pronounced none infamous but such as played for gaine sake, and I prooved the contrarie by the Pr aetors words: you reply that the Pr aetor meant the same that you say, though his wordes were generall of stage-players without distinction. This in the formost ranke, if it will prevaile. If not; you adde thereto, that the actors of your playes are no stageplayers. But how false both these thinges are, and how fraudulently sought to bee avouched: our betters, if it please them to compare my proofes with your reply, shall see. For Tullie , as I shewed, affirmeth that the Romans counting all kindes of stageplayes shamefull and dishonest, agreed that such as played them should not onlie want the honour of other citizens, but also bee disfranchised . Which, for the last note of infamie, beeing also witnessed by Livie , and S. Austin having therevpon observed that the Romans counted all stage-players infamous: Gothofredus knowing that the edict of the Pr aetor did expresse the iudgement and law of the Romans , and marking that the words of the edict were generall touching all stage-players, saith in the interpreting thereof that both players for gaine sake and without gaine were helde infamous by it, according to S. Austin and Livie . And this to haue bene truely saide by Gothofredus , I declared agreeably to the grounds of law by testimonies of the Romans ; of Cornelius Nepos, Laberius, Iuvenal, Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio , and others. As for that Vlpian (whose wordes you cited as the Pr aetors ) and Pegasus with Nerva , doe say that such as play for gaine sake are infamous , I aunswered that it foloweth not that therefore they thought free players not infamous: sith the Scripture likewise counteth a woman infamous who prostituteth her body vnto men for mony; yet counteth her infamous too who doeth it freely. Or if they thought the Pr aetors edict to haue that meaning, which perhaps they did: then they come too short of his meaning somewhat, and are well corrected therefore by Gothofredus . Now you, to proove the contrarie and disproove my proofes, affirme that  440 Nerva and Pegasus adde those words  441 for gaine sake to distinguish players for gaine from free players, which, you say, is manifest: and againe as manifest, you say, that Vlpian doeth approove their distinction . But if you thought good to confirme this point, whereof I shewed onely what cause I had to dout, I denied it not: you should bring strong arguments to convince they doe so, not idle affirmatios that it is manifest they doe. For what if a wealthie and lasciuious courtisan should say that  442 Moses mentioneth the hire of the whoore, to distinguish mercenarie whoores fro free and franke dames , as it is manifest: and againe, as manifest that the  443 Prophets doe approove his distinction? were there any weight in this to perswade vs that Moses and the Prophets mention the whoores hire to distinguish hired whoores fro defilers of them selues without hire; vnhonest from honest; infamous from prayse-worthie: and not to note rather that such as play the whoores doe it for hire commonlie? You adde, that Glossa communis, Baldus, Petrus de Castro (would you not say Paulus? for Petrus I can not heare of) and all whom you haue seene vpon that text of law doe so vnderstand it . This is an argument yet: though not strong enough. For all, who you have seene, vnderstand it so. It may be. But others, who have seene more law- bookes, perhaps can tell you of many that vnderstand it otherwise. My selfe, as few as I haue seene, can tell you of two;  444 Bud aeus , and an Autour of a Greeke abridgement of the Civill law , whom Bud aeus citeth. For the Greeke authour doth expound it thus, That all, who trie masteries in solemne games for gaine sake, are infamous: 445 and also they who come vpon the stage for prayse sake . And Bud aeus moving a question and doubt how these wordes of the text, that all who come vppon the stage 446 for reward, are infamous; should be vnderstoode, whether that they be not also infamous who come vpon the stage 447 for vaineglorious ostentation , answereth and resolveth out of St Augustin, and Livie, 448 that all stageplaying was counted infamous at Rome, and all stageplayers were wont to be disfranchised by the Censors . Whose interpretation in a point of this qualitie deserveth more credit then a hundred such as Paulus de Castro: so meanlie seene in the text he treateth of, that he giueth the word, stage , a different meaning from that in the Pr aetors edict, which it expoundeth; and saith, it speaketh of other games. An argument much stronger in shew, in substance weaker, you fetch out of the text: that in certamen descendere, and in scenam prodire, doc (as they saye in your lawe) ambulare aequis passibus, in the same places of the same title, De his qui notatur infamia; but it is most evident, that 449 qui de scendit in certamen depugnaturus cum bestijs dentatis, ac feris, virtutis ostendend ae no mercedis causa, non est notatus; Ergo qui prodit in scenam pronuntiandi gratia sine praemio & quaestu, non est notatus . Which syllogisine of yours if you allow for good: what say you vnto this, that (me seemes) is like it? In certamen descendere and in scenam prodire doe ambulare aequis passibus in the same places of the same title; but it is most evident, that  450 qui descendit in certamen lucta aut cursu certaturus cum hominibus non facit artem ludicram; Ergo qui prodit in scena pronuntiandi gratia non facit artem ludicra . The major is your owne. The minor as true as yours: Yet the conclusio false; which  451 the same places of the same title shew. And seeing by my syllogisme you perceiue, I trust, that the manlie exercises of wrastling and running doe farre out-runne stageplaying, as it is meete they should: you see that the major of your syllogisme fayleth, and that certamen and scena doe not walke with eve passe , but are coupled togither as a quick greyhound and a lazy curre. Farder is it from reason that you adioyne a reason of the favourable parte of the distinction out of the  452 Code ; or rather adioyne it not, but say that you thinke it may be gathered thence: because the games of wrastling, runing, and such like be permitted to them who desire and offer to beare the charge thereof . When neither doeth it follow that because these games are allowed by Emperours to willing bearers of the charge, 453 not imposed on the vnwilling , therefore free stageplayers are approved by Vlpian: and it is a wandring fansie to imagin why it should be so, when the question is whether it bee so or no. The reason of the other side which I sett downe to shew that the distinction can not be enforced out of Ulpians words, because the scripture likewise condemneth them of wickednes who play the hoores for hire, yet acquitteth not free hoores; you confute as soundly, as you confirme your owne. For you say it is simply evill to play the hoore, either freely or for reward; but not simply evill to come vpon the stage, because the law alloweth it if it bee done sine qu aestu: which is a plaine begging of the point in question. And yet having tolde mee that I must evict that it is simply a sinne for any prodire in scenam, as it is for a woman to prostitute her body ; (I cut off your superfluous words, as namely, vile , in adding which epitheton to sinne you double a fault corrected by your selfe before when you said, that I assume that the one is as greevous a sinne, as the other, or at the least as absolutely a sinne: ) but having tolde me this, you pleade againe the same sophisme, avouching that your consequence, Prodire in scenam qu aestus causa, infamat; ergo prodire in scenam sine quaestu, non infamat , is a good consequence, because the law so distinguisheth . How much greater reason had you to be perswaded, that sith I had evicted it to be simply evill, because simply infamous by the Pr aetors sentence, that is, by the law; Vlpian , with his autours, interpreters thereof, did insert those wordes not for distinction sake, but to note the common cause why it was practised, the loue of reward. Chiefly seeing otherwise it must needes folow there is ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  betwene the texts of your law, and one of them doeth crosse an other. Which if the lawiers whom you haue seene thereon, had as wel observed by S. Austin and Livie , as Bud aeus had: perhaps they would haue thought that all sortes of stage- players, even such as shew them selves for applause to please men, are therein noted also, as Bud aeus did. But I, who thinke there may be repugnancies in your textes, and had an eye to the point in question betwene vs, to weet, whether the Pr aetor , whose  454 edict expressed the ancient Romans law, pronounced all stage-players infamous; not whether Vlpian thought so, who lived in later age after greater and longer corruption of maners, and consequentlie of opinions; in so much that hee would exempt a  455 sort of fruitlesse game-servers from infamie, whom neither  456 ancient Romans , though Heathens, did before him, nor  457 Christian Emperours after: I (as you acknowledge) did admit they thought so, but vrged that the Pr aetor affirmed the same that I doe, and they mistooke his meaning, as Gothofredus prooveth in his note thereon. To the which assertion, after a preferring of them before Gothofrede , if not in learning, yet authoritie, needelesse to bee stoode on; (for though hee were not better learned then they were, yet might he see by S. Austin and Livie that they saw not; neither is it autoritie, but learning, that must teach vs what the Pr aetor meant:) you say that in some sense his short, but quicke note, Imm o & qui sine quaestu, hurteth not you at all . Well. In some sense then it hurteth you, in some it doeth not. And doth that sense, wherin he meant it, hurt you or no? If no: why say you afterward, Gothofrede doeth gloze against a manifest law without giuing any reason of his so doing? If yea: what spirit of wrangling had bewitched you to construe an autours words as not gainesaying you, which in his own meaning you knew made flat against you? For after you had saide, If hee meaneth thereby to taxe Laberius, Lentulus, Nero , and such like, that did exercere histrioniam, though gratuitam, his exception maketh not against your text ; and had given a reason thereof, beside the text cleane, neither agreeing to Laberius , whom yet by your forenaming him it should haue touched: you come in with these wordes, But Gothofrede in deede foundeth his sharpe note vpon a saying of S. Austin, Omnes enim scenici probrosi; and of Livie, Et tribu moveri soliti . So you doe confesse that Gothofrede in deede, although you sensed him as if he taxed onely them who played to satisfie their dissolute and lewde humours , that so hee might not seeme to make against your text, your sense thereof at least; yet in deede he counteth all stage-players infamous , according to the sayinges of S. Austin and Livie , whereon he foundeth his note. In deede Maister Gager , you are much to blame, who, to shew that you can obscure a most cleere truth with pretense of lawe, and a distinction of some sense , doe hazard the shipwracke of a good conscience, and wastfully employ your witt and time both, in bolstering out by writing that which your selfe see and knowe to bee vntrue. I did say before, that I gathered by your dealing that when you resolved to reply against me, you thought with your selfe: I know not whether these things be true which he writeth; yet am I disposed to haue a crash against them . Now I must in part correct that my saying. For you shew that somewhere in your reply you thought; I know that this thing, which he writeth, is true: 458 yet haue I a lust to contradict it. True it is therfore that by Gothofredes iudgement the Pr aetor accounted all stage-players infamous; and they, who tooke the Pr aetor otherwise, mistooke him. Whereof although I did not alleage Gothofredus for the chiefest proofe, but principally cited him to satisfie you, a lawier by a lawier, and prooved it by the best interpreter of the lawe, the practise and consent of the ancient Romans , which he doeth ground on also: yet you having answered him (you say) already as it were by the way , doe adde that by him the rest of my autorities and all mine examples also may receve their true, though short aunswer . The autorities then of Tullie , of Nepos , of Laberius , of Liuie , of Iuvenal , of Suetonius , of Tacitus , of Dio , and of S. Austin ; the examples of Nero, Lentulus , and the rest, whom not such autours onely but the people of Rome too did esteeme infamous for their stage-playing, were it freelie, or for gaine; may bee aunswered by your answere to Gothofredus . And how? For hee (you say) glozeth against a manifest lawe without giuing any reason of his so doeing . Why? Doeth not he giue a reason in these wordes, Omnes enim scenici probrosi, & tribu moveri soliti , prooved by S. 459 Austin and  460 Livie? But S. Austin and Livie could never dreame of your text , you say; and so their autorities serve not to interpret it . As who say Gothofredus brought them to interpret your text, that is, Vlpian: not rather to interpret the Pr aetors edict , &to correct your text thereby. For thus doth he reason in effect: Vlpian expounding the Pr aetors edict, saith that, they onely, Who play vpon the stage for gaine sake, are infamous: but the Pr aetor meant that they, who play without gaine, are infamous also, even generally all stage-players ; as it is apparant by S. Austin and Livie: therefore Vlpian misseth in expounding the Pr aetors edict . And, I trust, an older writer may be cited to correct a younger, of whom he could not dreame: or else your selfe doe evill to cite Vlpian against me, of whom hee could not dreame you wote well. Though S. Austin also might haue dreamed of Vlpian, 461 for ought that I know. But you saye farder that S. Austin and Livie are to bee vnderstoode against Histriones: and so their autorities serve not to this of your text . Wherein I must confesse I vnderstand not what you meane. For I can not imagin you should bee so absurd as to say that they speake not against players on stage, because they speake against Histriones . Onely as 462 Socrates ; beeing asked what hee thought of a certaine booke of Heraclitus , aunswered, Those things which I vnderstood in it are excellent, and so, I thinke, are those to which I vnderstood not: semblably may I say touching these branches and partes of your reply, that what I vnderstand therein maketh nothing against the point that I did conclude by Gothofredus ; no more, I thinke, doeth that which I vnderstand not. Nay, I say too litle when I say I thinke . For seeing histriones signifieth stage-players;  &c stage-players are such as come 463 vpon the stage to play or pronounce , whom the  464 Pr aetor speaketh of: I know, that what soeuer your meaning be therein, it can haue no force to ouerthrow that wich I concluded by Gothofredus . So this with the former distinctionlesse distinction of a sense he meant not, being all the answer that you make to him: the rest of my authorities and examples all are so farre from beeing answered by him, that your answerlesse answer doth rather leaue both him and them as vnanswerable. But you go forward, and, to ouerthrow them both an other way, you deny that the Romans euer iudged. Omnes scenicos infames , And why? Because playes (say you) were sometime instituted, as in a common plague, ad placandos Deos, and were prouided by great officers of the common treasure: and so they are referred ad religionem & deuotionem. Sometime they were sett out at the priuat cost of them that sued to the people for great offices, or generally for the honor and solace of the citie: and so they are referred to magnificence. For magnificentia is a goodly vertue, & versatur circa sumptus amplos, non turpes aut infames, because it is a vertue, but circa quaecunque in Rempublicam honestae laudis studio conferuntur: among the which 465 Aristotle reckeneth Ludos splendid e facere. Neither is it to be thought that Æsopus & Roscius, being both men of that fame, favour, wealth, and entire familiarity with the best and wisest in their times, were reputed as infamous persons. What should I speake of so many Circi, Theatra, Amphitheatra, builded by the greatest and bravest Romas with so huge charge & sumptuousnes? Which though they were once vpon fowle abuses, or some other occasion, as you write, overthrowne by the Romans themselues: yet even those playes for which they were abolished were ex eo genere of whom they might haue said (as 466 Tacitus doeth of Astrologers) quod in civitate nostra, & vetabitur semper, & retinebitur. Howsoever; I can not thinke that either they would haue suffered such things to bee done at all, if they had iudged them evill: or to be performed by infamous persons, being matters of that state and magnificence, and, as they thought, of that devotion and necessitie . Thus farre your owne wordes. In which, to shew that you doe not deny without cause that the Romans ever iudged all stage-players to be infamous , you make two proofes thereof: one, that Æ sopus & Roscius were not reputed as infamous persons ; an other, that the Romans would not haue suffered such things to be perfourmed by infamous persons, being matters of great state & magnificence , and; as they thought, of great devotion and necessitie . Such proposition, such proofes. The proposition savouring of a strange boldnes (to vse no harder terme) that you, who scarse are fourtie yeares old, if yet fourtie, in a questio of fact, of a thing done fifteene, sixteene, or seuenteene hundred yeares ago, which a number of witnesses, that liued the same time, men of good credit, affirme to haue bene doon, should presume to saye, I deny that it was done . For Tullie reporteth that the Romans counting all kindes of stage- playes shamefull and dishonest, did iudge accordingly of the players. Nepos, Laberius, Livie, Iuvenall, Tacitus , the rest, whom I cited, both of the learned sort, and of the common people, doe testifie the same. Neither can you denie but their wordes alleadged by me, doe clearlie argue that they iudged thus of free players also, not onely of players for gaine. Yet you harden your face to say against them all: I denie that the Romans ever iudged all stage- players to bee infamous . Yea, for proofe hereof you produce two reasons, which imply that they thought no stageplayers infamous, no not players for gaine: and so you avouch an evident vntrueth against your owne confession, your owne conscience. For Roscius and Æ sopus played for gaine: as  467 Plinie and  468 Macrobius shew. Their wealth, which you metion, was gotte by that trade. Now your text of  469 Ulpian with Pegasus and Nerva , sayeth that all who play for gaine, are infamous ; as you confessed before; adding that you sawe no cause to mislike it, lesse durst dispute against it . Wherefore in saying that Æ sopus and Roscius were not reputed as infamous persons , your owne mouth and heart codemne you of gainsaying an vndoubted trueth. Much more when you inferre the same of other stage-players, euen of the rascalls, the most vile among them, in the reason following. For although the same, the favour, the wealth of Roscius and Æ sopus , should no more haue mooved you to washe away all staine from their credit, then from  470 Flora and  471 Phryne , who were whoores of great fame, favour, wealth: yet their familiaritie with the best and wisest might probably perswade you, that they were not reputed as infamous persons. Howbeit, had you weighed, how  472 the best and wisest so wel acquainted with them, had shewed in  473 one of the, that  474 other things brought him to such estimation, his  475 stage-playing was some staine vnto him: you should haue perceyued that in this respect their credit might bee tainted, notwithstanding the acquaintance, whereto, by meanes of other partes approoved in them, they grew in processe of time with the best and wisest. But your next reason saith as much for the vilest and most beastlie stageplayers, as for Æ sopus and Roscius . For in certaine playes, called  476 the playes of Flora , the  477 players were not men, but women, and those lewde ones, professed whoores and strumpets: which, besides all wanton filthines of words, did shew them selues naked also to the people, and vsed most shamefull motions and gestures. These playes were instituted (to vse your own words) ad placandos Deos, 478 that Flora , as the Goddesse of flowers, might bee entreated not to hurt the corne, nor any thing that bloweth and blossemeth: and so they are referred ad religionem & devotionem . The  479 officers that had the charge to set them out, did sett them out at their private cost, to gett the peoples favour for the obtaining of greater offices: and so they are referred to magnificence . The  480 stages and theaters, wherein men behold them, Were builded by the greatest and bravest Romans with huge charge and sumptuousnes . Wherefore sith the Romans would not haue suffered such things to bee perfourmed by infamous persons, being matters of great state and magnificence, and, as they thought, of great devotion and necessitie: it foloweth, by your reason, that they did not iudge professed whoores and strumpets to be infamous persons. Now, if this consequent touching whoores bee false, as your Plaw sheweth it is: then is the consequution of your reason faulty. Which your self may see by the other branch thereof, avouched ioyntlie, to weet, that the Romans would not haue suffered such things to be done at all, if they had iudged them evill: and by him, whose sentence, that it is a vertue 481 to sett out playes bravelie , you adde for the gracing and countenancing of your reason, I meane, even by Aristotle . For he, in reckening it among magnificent actions  482 if any where men thinke they ought to sett out playes bravelie (so he qualifieth his sentece with a circustance of moment omitted by you in alleaging it,) respecteth the opinions and customes of the Grecians: who thought it an honorable thing to be at charges with furnishing and decking companies of Musicians, of Dansers, of Players, in their solemne feastes,  & vsuall processions celebrated to their Gods. As among the Athenians , for example sake,  483 Demosthenes , when no man of his tribe was willing to beare the charge thereof, did promise of his owne accorde that he  484 would beare it, and therevppon provided golden crownes and costlie garments for a companie  485 in the feast of Bacchus . This feast  486 had as filthie matters represented, though by an other sexe, in the shewes  & playes belonging thervnto, as that of Flora had. Yet, such was the brutish superstition of Heathens, that  487 Aristotle him selfe, one of the best among them, banishing all vnseemely speeches and spectacles out of his commo wealth,  488 excepteth such as these, done in the honour of their Gods, according to their lawe,  489 which  490 allowed that beastlinesse in many cities then . In like sort the Romans , albeit they iudged the things to be evil which the players did in the feast of Flora , so euill that  491 the refuse  & dregges of the people durst not for shame desire to haue the sight thereof while Cato was present: yet did they allow; and by publike order provide for the dooing of them,  492 because they thought them pleasant to their divelish Goddesse, whose wrathfull plagues they feared, if they should omitt them. And thus, for the rest of their playes also, whether made to pacifie  493 the mother of their Gods, or  494 any of her childr e, they thought it a necessarie devotion to sett them out, a statelie magnificence to sett them out bravelie; yet did they repute the players thereof infamous, as Tullie, Livie , the Pr aetor, Vlpian , all consent; though withall discrediting thereby both Gods and playes, as  495 Austin and  496 Tertuluian note. How much the more strange doeth your boldnes seeme, not onelie to pronounce that the Romans would not have suffered such things to be performed by infamous persons; but to say, as bringing a proofe thereof too, that you can not thinke it, I can not thinke that they would haue suffered it . And can you thinke that this is a seemely thing, or tolerable, in a matter of fact, prooved by the vniforme consent of so many and so worthy witnesses, for you to contradict it with these kindes of speeches: I deny that the Romans ever iudged all stageplayers to be infamous; It is not to be thought that they deemed Æsopus and Roscius infamous; I can not think that they would haue suffered their playes to be performed by men infamous? Can you thinke without blushing, how the ancient Fathers conclude by the confession of the Romans themselues,  497 one, that playes are evill, because the Pr aetor noted the players with infamie; an  498 other, that such Gods should not bee worshipped, because such men were counted infamous who perfourmed the playes that they required: and you, of the cotrarie, denie that such men were couted infamous by the Romans , or noted by the Pr aetor ; a thing, that no Heathen, amongest all their adversaries (whom I haue ever read of) durst? Can you thinke your students of Christ-church, and others, with whom you haue communicated this reply of yours, to be so weak eye-sighted, that they perceiue not, that your selfe, in citing & applying Tacitus his wordes touching Astrologers to the point in question, doe confute your selfe, as if God had bereft you almost of common sense, when you went about it? For if you thinke that the Romans would retaine Astrologers alwayes in their citie, yet forbid them alwayes: can you not think that they would haue suffered such things to bee done at all, if they had iudged the evill? And if you thinke playes to be of that kinde, of which they might haue saide as Tacitus doth of Astrologers: can you thinke that they who  499 iudged Astrologers worthie of greater punishment, would haue iudged players worthie a note of infamie? I would to God you could thinke,  & think vpo your bedde (as the  500 Prophet exhorteth) of your offense herein, your  501 loving of vanitie, your seeking of lyes . Then would you bee still, and quietlie acknowledge that by Tullie, Nepos, Laberius, Livie, Iuvenal , and other auncient Romans , stage-players were taken to bee infamous persons, euen all, whether they played freelie, or for gaine: and therefore not onely the hirelinges, but the free too, are comprised and noted in the Pr aetors wordes. Then would you rather observe in the reading of your  502 Glossa communis , that though certaine lawiers tooke the Pr aetor otherwise , yet certaine tooke him so as well as Gothofredus . Then would you devise more and better reasons for the generall doctrine out of  503 Iustinians Code , and  504 Theodosius both, then now for the favourable part of your distincto you did out of Iustinianus ; omitting and neglecting that, in  505 the same title, whence that seelie single reason was inforced, stage-players are termed 506 vile, 507 vnhonest persons , without all distinction. It may bee that your coscience felt some pricke hereof; or at least your knowledge informed you that this would not holde water. Else, why adioyne you a new point of defense, that the actors of your playes are no stage-players? Whereas  508 before your onely answere to this point was, that you played freely: nor needed there more in your desire to bee short (which you pretend often) if you thought it certaine the lawe comprised not free players. But what soeuer you thought, when you resolved of having two stringes vnto your bowe: this newe string is worse a great deale then the old was; the hempe is naught whereof you made it. For whereas you denie; that you, who come on the stage once in a yeare, or two, in seauen, or in tenne, or sometime twentie yeares, are to be termed 509 stage-players; as he is not a Wrastler that sometime to proove his strength, trieth for a fall or two; nor he a fenser, that sometime taketh vp the cudgells to play a venny: First make these similitudes perfitt with adding 510 that which answereth to  511 the stage, that they bee not similia dissimilia , (as  512 Tullie calleth them,) and then hee is a  513 Wrastler who to proove his strength on that stage, as it were, doeth trie for a fall or two ; and a  514 Fenser likewise, who commeth once thither, though he neuer come againe; and so are they stage-players, who play vpon the stage once in a yeare or two. Next, the law doeth cutt off all strife about the name, by noting him with infamie,  515 Who commeth on the stage to play, or pronounce . So that when you acknowledge that yours come on the stage to this intent and ende, you shewe that both you wrangle and trifle in denying they are to be termed stage- players. As for that you adde, that you doe differ from them, whom I mentioned, in the maner of your playing, in the ende, effectes, & other circumstances, as in the examination of mine exaples shall appeare ; "the which as I haue alleaged to illustrate mine authorities, as being the men whom they properly speak against; so if you shew that you are not to be likened to them, neyther mine authorities, nor mine examples shall touch you: the drift of your speech is to proove, even for the thing too, that you are cleare from that which the lawe disgraceth; but with what sinewes of arguments you doe it, I will (by a more perfitt similitude the yours were) endevour to make plaine vnto you:  516 Maximinus , a savage Emperour, a man of a huge, tall, and strong body, tooke a most sottish and proude conceit thereof that he could not be killed. Wherevpon a certaine man said in his presence; He that can not be killed by one, is killed by many: The Elephant is great; yet is he killed: The Lion is strong; yet is hee killed: The Tyger is swift; yet is he killed: Beware of many ioyned, if single ones you feare not. The autour of this speech meant to reason thus, by way of a syllogisme: Every living creature may be killed: Maximinus the Emperour is a living creature: Therefore hee may bee killed . And least Maximinus through his proud conceit should object against it, that every living creature, who could be overmatched by one, might be killed; but it was impossible for any one to match him: the autour saide, that such as could not be killed by one, might by many ; adding for proof thereof that Elephants, Lions, Tigers, bee they never so great, strong, and swift, are killed . Here suppose that he had withall, in hope of better perswading Maximinus , tolde him that  517 Tullie saith all living creatures may bee killed: which to bee true in all absolutely and simply , yea even such as no one can lightly overmatch,  518 Tullie sheweth farder; and  519 Xenophon, 520 Polybius ,  521 Livie, 522 Plinie, 523 Plutarch , doe witnesse by sundry stories of those beasts. Now, if Maximinus had given eare thereto, and answered that him selfe did differ from those beasts in the maner of his strength, in the end, effectes, and other circumstances, as it should appeare in examination of the examples; which as the man had cited to illustrate his autorities, as being the creatures whom they properly speake of, so if Maximinus had shewed that he was not to be likened to the neither the autorities, nor the examples should touch him; what should the felow haue done, who did make that argument? Should hee haue denyed that Maximinus differed from Elephants, Lions, Tigers, in the maner of his strength, and the rest of your circumstances? How could he? when he might haue bene controlled straight by Maximinus saying: They haue no man to their subiects: I rule the whole world; they want helpes to shield them from wounds; I weare armour: they can holde no swordes, or other weapons; I can: they are of low stature; I am eleven foote high . Should he haue graunted that because it appeareth by those and the like differences, that Maximinus was not such a living creature as those beasts were, therefore he was no living creature: nether could hee be touched either by the examples or by the autorities? That had bene to bewray either feare, or ignorance, and to betray the truth: sith the autorities reached to the thing in generall; and so the examples brought to illustrate them did touch Maximinus also by consequent. Then belike, albeit the differences, that he might alleage against the autours reason had bene true all, yet had they all bin idle; as neither disprooving the major, nor the minor, whereof the conclusion doeth necessarily follow. This is the condition and state of your differences, Mr. D. Gager ; they are not all true, and they are all idle. They are not all true. Nay, is there any of them not vntrue in part? Doutlesse not the first: wherein you affirme that you differ from them altogether in furniture, & maner of setting out playes: they did it with excessiue charge: you thriftily, warily, and almost beggerly . For, I hope, as Irus came beggerly in with you; so  524 they would haue clothed him in ragges too, and could: and such clokes as they vsed to borow for brave wooers, cost  525 them no more the fetching, then yours out of the revils: and excesse in charges is measured by abilitie, as  526 Aristotle sheweth; the  527 widow giving two mites, gaue more then all the rest: and you in spending pence might be more excessiue then they in spending poundes. Not the second difference, touching the maner of action; whereof you say that they acted their playes in an other sort then you doe, or can or well know how: but so exquisitly and carefully, that you may seeme compared with them either for skill, or diligence, rather Recitare, which I doe not dislike, then Agere . For other sort of playing you fansie without ground, saying you know not what of thinges perfourmed you know not how: I weene you know not, neither why they who played vnwilling and had small list to learne it, should bee more skilfull and diligent then yours: sure if yours should seeme rather recitare , which I mislike not, then agere ; none of yours played  528 drunken, nor  529 daunsed, nor  530 hurled footestooles, nor  531 put on wemens raiment. Not the third difference, which you set in this, that they came on the stage of a lewde, vast, dssolute, wicked, impudent, prodigall, monstrous humour; you contrarywise doe it to sundry good intents , as namely (for example) to conforme your youth to convenient action . For neither came they all with such a disposition; witnesse is Laberius , witnesses are others alleaged out of Dio ; so that you speake herein as if Maximinus had said that those beasts, which the felow mentioned, are of low stature, a thing vntrue in  532 Ele phants: nor is it more true that you frame your youth to convenient action , framing some of them to the action of wooers, some of knaves, some of parasites, some of clownes, some of drunkards, some of bragging souldiers, or of the like to these, then that  533 Maximinius was eleven foote high. Not the fourth difference, wherein (to make a farder profit of the circumstance that before you vrged against the name of stage-players) you say that they frequented the stage; you doe it seldom, sometime not in seven, ten or twenty yeares . For how doe you proove that they whom Iuvenal, Tacitus, Dio note, frequented it more then some of yours haue? and Laberius did it but once in  534 three score years, who yet both called himself a stage-player for that doeing, and counted it a staine vnto him. The fifth offendeth lesse, affirming that they did it on the publike theater not of the citie onely, but of the whole world: you in a privat house, and to a few, men of vnderstanding . Yet looke by what reason you name the Roman theater, the theater of the whole worlde , your should be the theater of England, France , and Ireland , if not of whole Europe: and why say you that you did it to men of vnderstanding? as if in Rome wemen also had bene present who might behold the lusty motions of the players, and vnderstand not what they spake;  535 none such on your stage. In the sixth you lavish more then in the fourth, saying that they were men growne, one of them three score yeares olde , Knights, of noble houses, Patricii, & one of them Emperour of the world: in you being young men, boyes, poore Scholers, all these things are quite contrary . For, touching age, among  536 them who were compelled by Nero to become stage-players, the stories, which I cited, doe record (quite contrary to your quite contrary ) that there were not onely  537 men growne , and  538 olde , but young too; and some of your players came on the stage as olde as  539 Nero , your great Emperour: touching wealth, the beggerie of those needy squiers, whom out of Iuvenal and Tacitus I specified, hath small contrarietie vnto poore scholers state: touching birth, and gentrie, you forgott your self, when, in saying elswhere, The gentleman that played Ulysses , and setting  540 his verses before your booke, you shewed that your players are not quite contrarie to Patricii ; vnlesse you thinke so meanlie of his name, and stocke, that a  541 smokie Lentulus , or Fabius , or Mamercus , doeth passe it in nobilitie; yea, though it haue learning and Scholership ioyned with it; neither onely passe it, but passe it so farre, that not content to make it differ in degree, you make it quite contrarie, as if it were of the basest of the rascalitie. And seeing these things, specially this last point, wherein you must beare with me, if farthermore being taught by  542 Tullie , that Lentulitas , what shall I terme it? the Lentulusnes of noble parentage is 543 nothing in comparison of vertue ; nay, being taught by him, whom Tullies 544 light came from, even by the  545 Father of lightes, that 546 they are most noble who most excell in godlines and graces of the spirit , I account all Christian Scholers and Studentes, as good and noble gentlemen, as the Heathen Lentuli ; but seeing these differences doe square so fro the trueth: the rest, which are the same, enlarged and applyed to particular comparisons of certaine of your players with certaine of theirs, must needs be enroled in the same predicament. Howbeit you doe vtter them in such a  547 sort, as if you did not onely meane to haue it though, that there is lesse resemblance, and therefore greater difference betwene their players  & yours, whom I notwithstanding had compared as like: but also that I should be forced to acknowledge it by mine own confession, and graunt that I was wonderfully overseene therein. For you aske of me (to sett downe your owne wordes:) Who ever would resemble our Melantho with your Laureolus? the one represented by an ingenuous boy, and for her lewdnes imagined to bee hanged within: the other acted by Lentulus, a man nobly descended, expressing perhaps openly on the stage the same punishment: What likenes is there betwene our young men, putting on the persons of Antinous, and the rest of Penelopes Wooers: and betwene gentlemen of the noble race of Fabius, in their owne persons, not so much counterfeiting others, as expressing their own scurrilities? Such as our Antinous and the rest of the wooers can not be iustly charged with: no not our Irus, or Vlysses. Againe, what resemblance is there betweene our Hippodamia onely singing, Eurimachus onely saying, Phemius both singing and saying, all three represented by such as they were: and betwene Nero, playing mens, wemens, and minstrels parts vpon the stage in Rome? Beholde A marvelous case, that I should compare and resemble players together so absurdly, as no man would ever haue done besides me: and that I should affirme them to bee like one an other, betwene whom there is no likenes, no resemblance , as your sharpe vrging doeth emply. But perhaps your stomake is the more egre against my comparisons, because of our dissension about the stage and playes. The partie, that spake in the presence of Maximinus , spake  548 vpon the stage, and was a  549 player himselfe: it may be you would haue vsed him more gentlie. For else, had you bene there, and loved Maximinus you might (which I marvell if you thinke not absurd) haue aunswered thus in his behalfe. Who ever would resemble Maximinus to an Elephant? the one, a man well featured, and feeding very daintily within doores in his palace: the other a beast, a 550 thicke skinne, having a 551 nose an 552 ell long, and 553 cating grasse perhaps without doores on the mountaines. What likenes is there betwene him, our Emperour, a most gratious personage, and of sweete conditions: and betweene a Tigre, a 554 cruell savage beast, wearing 555 heare of sundry coolours, speckled, spotty? Such as our Emperour hath none vpon his body: no, nor the like pawes, or 556 taile. Againe what resemblance is there betweene him, excelling in all three things, greatnes, strength, and swiftnes: & betwene an Elephant , great and strong onely; a Tigre, strong and swift; a Lion having litle to trust to, beside strength? Thinke you that you had spoken with any graine of salt, Mr. D. Gager , if you had spoken thus? Though I haue disadvantaged my self in this similitude: because both your Melantho was a great deale liker to Iuvenals Laureolus , your wooers and the rest to those degenerat gentlemen, then Maximinus was to beastes: and I haue scarse put one false difference in mine, of Maximinus sweete conditions; you haue put many in yours. For, to passe over the ingenuousnes of the boy that represented Melantho , opposed to the noblenes of Lentulus who did act Laureolus , the vnlikenes whereof in noblenes, and acting, is disprooved already; chiefly sith 557 thinges that are not the same, may bee like: first, what proofe haue you, that 558 they, whom Iuvenal noted vnder the name of Fabii , did not so much counterfeit others , which your wooers did, as expresse their owne scurrilities? When contrariwise some of them would haue hid their faces with 559 visours, for shame, that they might not be knowne, as counting the infamie thereof worse then death: a very great presumption, that they did abhorre from expressing their own scurrilities on the stage, whom it greeved so much to come on the stage at all. Next, what wrong is it to charge your Antinous , and other of the whoores, with such scurrilities , as theirs? were not the  560 playes that they played made of like arguments, in like sort, to yours? Is not Antinous sett foorth by  561 Homer , as a malapert  562 knave? to speake in  563 Horaces phrase , of him and his complices. Doe  564 you not followe Homer , and expresse Antinous with the rest accordinglie, both in their misbehaviour of wordes  & of deedes? Thirdlie, doe you know what is meant in Iuvenal by planipedes Fabios , when I having said that the race of Fabius resembled & counterfaited such base ridiculous things as are expressed in Irus , you denie that hee may bee iustlie charged with such? And if you know that they, who were termed  565 planipedes , counterfaited such things as  566 Laberius did when he put on the person of a bondslaue whipped: are you not ashamed to deny that such are expressed in Irus , a begger buffeted, throwne down, and  567 haled out by the feete, the wooers laughing thereat? Finally, why are not the blowes , in your tragedie, given to Vlysses , like the  568 Mamercians whirrets that Iuvenal speaketh of? you thinke them not so badde. I thinke them worse rather. For whirrets, that hee speaketh of, were given with the hande. Your Ulysses is  569 strooken with Melanthius heele, and  570 with Antinous foote-stoole: vnlesse Antinous hurling it did misse the marke, and played not his part as you appointed him out of  571 Homer . Thus are your differences all vntrue, in part: in whole, a number of them. But suppose they were true. Yet are they all idle: because, as in the felowes speech to Maximinus , the maior being prooved that all living creatures may bee killed , whether one or many bee able to surprise them; the minor apparant, that hee was a living creature ; the conclusion folowed, notwithstanding whatsoever differences betweene him, and them, whose examples were brought to proove the maior: likewise in my reason, the maior being prooved, that all stage-players are infamous by the civill law, whether they play for gaine, or freely ; the minor apparant, that they who play your playes on the stage, are stage-players; the conclusion foloweth, notwithstanding whatsoever differences betweene yours, and them whose examples for proof of the maior I produced. Nay, I say farder, that as some true differences betwene Maximinus , and the beastes, doe sharpen the edge of the conclusion against him; for if  572 greater, stronger, and swifter creatures are killed, how much more might he be? so for you to be stage-players it is more shamefull then for the olde Romans , sith they were  573 ignorant, 574 infidels, 575 without God in the world ; you are Scholers, Christians, chosen to be trained vp vnto the Ministerie; and  576 vnto whom much is committed, the more shall be required of him ;  577 they who haue many sinnes forgiven them , should loue much ; it is a great offence  578 to giue the Nazarites wine to drinke , though to  579 drinke wine be not vnlawfull. Wherefore that of Terence wherewith you conclude, saying that you thinke it was a fowle shame for noble men and Nero to play, but to play noble men or Nero it is no shame for you; as 580 hee saith in the Comedie, Duo quum idem faciunt, s aepe, vt possis dicere, Hoc liceti mpune facere huic, illi non licet; Non quod dissimilis res sit, sed qu od is qui facit: although you straiten the point (whether for shame, or for the figure?) when you speake of playing noble men and Nero , your purpose being to iustifie the playing of the  581 basest, drunkards,  & 582 whooers too; but if Terences saying would fitt the point in question, the vse thereof must bee to proove that they might lawfully come on the stage , you may not. The truth is that it cannot bee applyed hereto, because  583 the law speaketh generally of stage-players , as it doeth of bawdes , of theeves , with the like; and common sense doeth teach vs, that  584 Wee may not distinguish where the lawe distin guisheth not . Else, if I should say that by the same law our English theeves , who robbe on Gaddes hill , are infamous; one of their abbetters might aunswer, No not so: for the Law speaketh of such as 585 Lucius Tubulus, men of wealth and state, who robbed the whole worlde repairing vnto Rome; not of poore good felowes that robbe a few Kentish men travailing to Graves-end: and I thinke it was a fowle shame for rich men and Tubulus to robbe; but to robbe riche men and Tubulus, it is no shame for vs: as he saith in the Comedie, that oftentimes, you may say, when two men doe the same thing, the one is not blameworthy for it, the other is, not as if there were difference in the thing it selfe, but in the man that doeth it . Which Comicall sentece, though it might be as well applied by Iustice Graybeard to the excuse of theft in poore men, as by Terences 586 Mitio it is to the excuse of whoordom in a young man; yet were it vniustly applied there-vnto: because the law condemning theft in whomsoever without respect of persons, bee they rich or poore, doeth count it none of those things which fall within the compasse of Terences 587 oftentimes . So considering, stage-players are spoken of in like sort, as theeves, by the law: you see how Terences saying may be applied vnto them. But if we might apply it vnto them iustly, wee must inferre thereof that it was no shame for Nero & his mates to come on the stage, for you it is: as S. Paul commandeth vs  588 not to eate with any that is called a brother, if he be a fornicatour ; which,  589 with an infidell committing the same filthines, he doeth not forbid. And thus while you endevour to vnwind your selfe out of the nett of ignominie and infamie cast vpon you by the civill lawe, you are bound faster in it: to the fulfilling of that proverbe, which I wish you had marked in the  590 Comedie rather, if not in the  591 Scripture, It is hard to kicke against prickes. In the second head, to a reason drawn out of the law of God for the reproofe of stage-playes as now you handle it, denying that you made it to proove that men may lawfully put on wemens raiment therein, as I tooke it; though howe iust cause I had to take it so, I haue declared; but vnto this reason grounded on the  592 law of God in Deuteronomie, Whatsoever man doeth put on womans raiment, he is abominable to the Lord; But men did put on wemens raiment in your playes; you must acknowledge therefore that you were iustly blamed: you reply in like sort as vnto the former of the civill law; first, that the prohibition of men to weare wemens rayment is not generall, but toucheth certaine cases onely; next, that your players did not weare wemens raiment. And because in treating of the prohibition I shewed out of the Scriptures , that it doeth belong not to the ceremoniall law, but to the morall; and no parte of the morall law may bee transgressed, no, not for the saving of honour, wealth, or life: my proofes hereof beeing so cleere, strong, and pregnant, that you durst not deny the thing to bee prooved, you moue a dout, as your terme is, out of wordes of mine; in deede you reason thus against it. I pray you giue mee leaue to propose my contrary dout. The morall law, as you truely say, is the law of loue and charitie; to the which wheresoever the ceremonial law is repugnant, there it giveth place to the morall. The morall law therefore is never contrarie to loue and charitie, in commanding or forbidding any thing. But the place of Deuteronomie, being taken strictly, absolutely, and in the rigor of the letter, may sometimes hinder the actions of loue and charitie, both towards our selves and others; as in those cases, which both you and I propose. Ergo in that strictnes it belongeth rather to the law ceremoniall, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law morall, and so it is perpetually and simply to bee observed . Nowe, I haue given you leaue to propose your contrary dout. I pray you giue me leaue to propose my contrary question. In the same booke of Deuteronomie it is written,  593 Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adulterie . These precepts beeing taken strictly, absolutely, and in the rigor of the letter, may sometimes hinder the actions of loue and charitie, both towardes our selves and others ; as appeereth by the example of Ioseph , and of David: Ioseph , who  594 lost his libertie and put his life in hazard, because  595 he refused to committ adulterie with his Maisters wife; David , who  596 cast his folowers and him selfe into sundry dangers and distresses, because 597 he would not kill Saul . Herevpon I aske you, whether you thinke, that seeing the morall lawe bound Ioseph & David to  598 loue their neighbours, & themselves , therefore they should haue made no scruple of adulterie and murder, in these cases, in which the forbearing thereof did hinder the actions of loue toward them selves and others: but ought to haue iudged those precepts in that strictnes to belong rather to the law ceremonial, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law moral, and so it is perpetually and simply to be observed. Which if you thinke not, as God forbid you should, and you will professe (as I am perswaded) that you detest such thoughts: then doe you acknowledge that it came rather of a lust to crosse and contradict my speech, then of any dout you had within your selfe, that you say, a precept, which beeing strictly kept might breede some disadvantage to our selves or others, must in this respect bee counted ceremoniall, and not be kept strictly, because the morall law is never contrarie to love and charitie in commanding or forbidding any thing . And sure you might haue reason to take it not well, if I should suppose you to be so ill catechized, as that you knew not that the moral law commandeth vs to 599 loue God aboue all things, and man after him; that  600 our loue to Godward is prooued by the obseruing and keeping of his commandements; that if by keeping of them we should seeme to hate man, we must 601 hate him rather, then not performe our loue to God: that it foloweth not hereof the law is contrary vnto loue neither , because to hate man so is to 602 loue him lesse then God, in comparison, and not in deede to hate him, nay, it is to loue him, sith it is to wish him and worke him  603 greater good by losse of lesse good which he can not retaine therewith. Howbeit, had you doubted, yet might you haue found enough to resolue you, if you had read my writing rather with a minde to learne, then to gainesay, in as much as I shewed by Scripture touchinge Peter , that hee should not haue lyed to avoid the daunger of whatsoeuer trouble: because to lye is evill; not allowed in any case by our law-giver, no not for the defense of the glorie of God, much lesse for the safetie of man, a worme . Or, if, notwithstanding all that this could teach you, there might some occasion of doubting still remaine: should you not haue rather sought to be resolved by me in private conference, then publikelie in writing (made common with many, even in the country also, not onely in our Vniversitie) to affirme a point implying flat atheisme, that wee are no farder to keepe Gods commaundements, then standes with our commoditie? and so conclusivelie to vouch it with an Ergo , as if it did folow necessarilie, that all the lawes of God (for your reason holdeth by consequent in all) must be sett aside, like ceremoniall matters, when our owne, or other mens, honour, wealth, or life, cometh in question with them? and to adde that the equitie thereof yet pertayneth to the law moral, and so they are perpetuallie and simplie to be observed? which semeth by distinguishing their equitie from strictnes to stregthen them in sound meaning; in deede destroyeth them by teaching their transgressors how to defend most grosse iniquitie: as idolaters, for example, when, if  604 Nabuchodonosor doe threaten he will burne al who worship not his golden image , they may say, that albeit in Deuteronomie God saith, 605 Thou shalt not bowe downe to them, nor worship them, yet sith the morall law is never contrary to loue in forbidding any thing, and the place of Deuteronomie, being taken strictlie, would hinder now mens actions of love toward them selues; Ergo in that strictnes it belongeth rather to the law ceremoniall, though the equitie thereof pertaineth to the law morall, and so it is perpetuallie and simplie to be observed . A sentence so vngodlie, that when Peter onely touched it a farre off, or rather lesse then touched it, speaking of a particular case, no generall law; nor Ergoing against it, nor terming the keeping of it strictnes , nor plaistering the breach of it with equitie: but when he tended towards it by saying to our Saviour,  606 Maister, pitie thy selfe, this shall not bee vnto thee , our Sauiour answered him, Gett thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offense vnto me, because thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men. Sutable to this new argument of yours is the defense of your olde (the onely one you pressed before) from two examples. For whereas you had reasoned thus, Some men of Macedonie, mooved by Prince Alexander, did putt on Wemens raiment to save the honor of Ladies; the like did Achilles, the sonne of Thetis, to save his life; Ergo it is lawfull to doe it in such cases ; and I made answer thereto, that the reason is naught, because we are to live by lawes, not by exaples; neyther may we lye or forsweare our selues to save our lives, or benefitt others , though David & Peter did so, men worthier to be folowed then Macedonians , or Achilles: you reply, that the reason is good (this must you meane by saying that the examples are alleadged to good purpose in the circumstances that you apply them for , or else you delude vs with an other sophisme;) and why? For Alexanders fact is commended (say you) as proceeding from a most noble, and true heroicall minde; and because it was better that the Persian Embassadors were slaine, then that the chastities of so many great Ladies should so dishonorably be either overthrowne, or so much as assailed: and Thetis might well hide her sonne Achilles in a maidens apparell in respect of motherlie love & pitie which shee was to beare her sonne, knowing, as shee did, that hee should be slaine in that iourney to Troy, whether he was requested to accompanie the other Grecian Lords . Touching the former wherof, to admitt, that Alexanders fact proceeded from a noble true heroicall minde , and that it was better the Persian Embassadours were slaine then the chastities of so many great Ladies should so dishonorably be overthrowne, or assailed: yet doeth it not folow that men might therefore lawfullie put womens raiment on to kill them; the thing might be covenient and good to be done, the meanes of doeing it not good. As  607 it is better that a person guiltie should bee left vnpunished, then a person guiltlesse should be condemned: and  608 he, whose saying this was, spake it of a noble true h eroicall minde. Yet were the meanes naught to procure by bribes or by false witnesses the escape or acquittall of a guiltie person: and if any man, who had vsed such dealing, should be commended for it, he should bee commended amisse in that respect, as Alexander is by you. Now, for the later, how proove you that Thetis might well hide her sonne Achilles, as shee did? You say, that you thinke not but she might doe it well . So, Your reason then is: I thinke shee might doe it well; Ergo she might . A common kinde of argument with you; but thinne, and leane: nor likely to proove better at the length in triall, of whatsoever plight it seeme in your writing. For let it fare as it may in Topickes , in Analytickes it must fast: it can not away with moode and figure . And what if you thinke not that shee might neither? as I thinke you doe not; vnlesse you thinke contraries, or speake otherwise then you thinke. For your selfe affirme, that the putting on of wemens rayment which is termed an abomination to the Lord in the place of Deuteronomie, is the wearing of it ordinarily, so to converse among men and wemen, against the course of all naturall and civill regard . But Thetis , intending thereby to hide Achilles , did clothe him to converse so ordinarily among men and wemen: even longer, then he would endure to converse so; though  609 he endured for certaine yeares. Therefore that, which shee did, you thinke to bee abominable: yea, pronounced in Scripture an abomination to the Lorde . The lesse materiall is it whether that be true which by the way I noted, that Statius the Poet making Chiron, Calchas , and Achilles himselfe to reproove the putting of that raiment on him, meant that men of wise, vertuous, religious, ingenuous, valiant mindes, did iudge the thing simply in any case vnlawfull by the light of nature. Though I wish our iudges, vnto whose arbitrement I referre the matter, whether you controll me therein well, or no, to marke that for Chiron , in whom are represented wise and vertuous persons, albeit you affirme hee had a furder reache then his words outwardly import: yet in setting down that reache you adde, perhaps , as staggering at your owne conceit; and withall acknowledge that his words outwardly , whereof you can not proove an other inward meaning, import as much as I said. Beside that they may iustly suspect your partiall censure, because, where I had likewise noted by the way that the fact of Achilles , deflowring Deidamia by meanes and occasion of his conversing so with her, doeth shewe what inconvenience and danger of vncleannes cleaveth to the cladding of men in wemens raiment: you doe overthwartly  & wrongfully crosse my note by saying that hee was likely to doe as much in his owne likenes any where else . For let malefactours bee never so ready to practise any wickednes of their owne corrupt and lewde inclination: the circumstances of maner, season, place, and so foorth, commodious to performe it doe more entise them therevnto. Weapons them selves (saith  610 Homer) doe draw men to sight: and  611 opportunitie maketh theeves . The force whereof in this thing I said enough to open by that, as  612 Ch aerea could not haue defiled Pamphila no not in Thais house, without his Eunuches raiment: so, if womans rayment had not come on  613 Clodius, C aesar should not haue put away his wife Pompeia so soone as he did; perhaps never. Or are you of opinion that with vs it skilleth not whether scholers lodge in Colleges  & Halls, or in townesmens houses? Yea, although they bee neither so much conversant, nor go in like attire, as Achilles vsed with Lycomedes daughter? Our Saviour said to his Disciples,  614 If thy foote cause thee to offend, cutt it of; if thine eye cause thee to offend, plucke it out: meaning that wee must sever our selves from thinges and persons that are most deare vnto vs, if they be an occasion vnto vs of sinne, and hinder vs in the way of life. Yet a man that had heard him with your disposition, might haue said, What needes it? seeing though we cutt off one foote, or plucke out one eye, the other is likely to cause vs to offend . Vpon Moses wordes in Genesis , touching Dina , that  615 shee went out to see the daughters of that country, and Sichem ravished her, 616 godly learned interpreters observe that her wandering and idle curiositie is noted and reprooved as an occasion of the vilanie that was done vnto her. Yet a gadding humour and wanton eye of maidens loth to folow S. 617 Paules rule and keepe at home , might say that such teachers are puritans, who can not abide whitson-ladies: for Sichem was likely to doe as much to Dina , though shee had kept at home in her fathers house, and never come in Sichems sight. The very fact in question, whereon you mislike that I made this note of such occasions and entisements, hath the same observed therein by the  618 Poet, the wise reporter of it: namely, that Achilles lust was first kindled by seeing Deidamia ; afterwarde encreased by conversing with her; and finally accomplished by coming through the falacie of his attire, like a woman,  619 whither else in likenes of a man hee could not. But whatsoever Statius iudged of the matter, or others shall iudge of that I noted by the way; you graunt it was abominable by the lawe of God, for Thetis to put womans raiment on her sonne Achilles , as shee did. And so you haue rather confirmed, then confuted, mine aunswere to your argument from the two examples of Macedonians and Achilles . You come in now anew with halfe a dozen more: three of men, attiring them selves in wemens raiment; three of wemen, in mens. And quoting  620 their names onely in your margent, you say that if you had thought that these two examples should not haue bene taken in your meaning, that is, onely in the circumstance for the which you alleaged them, you could haue vsed many true stories of both sexes, to the which no such exceptions could haue bene taken . Wherein, to passe over, that by giving the name of true to those stories , you make it very probable that you meant  621 before vnder the name of stories , the fable of Achilles , as I supposed you did by the drift of your wordes, (speaking first in generall of  622 stories prooving  623 two points; then bringing  624 one in speciall to proove the one of them,  625 Achilles to proove the other) which yet you deny to haue bene your meaning, and charge mee with vntruth in effect for saying it: you doe farder charge me that I haue not taken those two examples in your meaning . No haue? Why? Meant you not by them to conclude, that a man may lawfully put on womans raiment, to saue his life, or benefite many, because in such cases Achilles and the Macedonians did put on such raiment? And haue not I expressely set this reason downe, affirming it to be your reason, and making mine aunswere accordingly thereto? yes: but I haue also in mine aunswer to it noted other circumstances of the same examples, therby to make plainer the badnes of your reason: and so I haue not taken them in your meaning, that is (as you expound it) onely in the circumstance for the which you alleaged them . You are a mery man, and not much vnlike in this respect to one, who when hee had taken vp a waster and buckler in Cheapeside at London to play with an apprentice,  & the apprentice rapped him, sometime vpon the head, sometime vpon the elbow, or shoulder, or side, hee cast them downe againe; saying, that if he had thought that the apprentice would not haue stroken vpon his buckler still, he would not haue played with him . Yet in this you vary from the vaine of his speech, that you say you could haue vsed many true stories of both sexes, to the which no such exceptions could haue bene taken . Though you helpe your selfe no more by this varying, then if his skill had served him to haue warded all the blowes with his buckler; his weaknes being neverthelesse vnable to resist, but that he might haue had his buckler beaten about his eares. For what if no such exceptions could be taken against your six examples? Doeth not the same aunswer that I made to your reason from the Macedonians example, and Achilles , beate downe these also to the ground: sith none of them is equall to David , or to Peter , whose actions notwithstanding are no sufficient warrants for vs? Moreover, as in beheading of noble personages, that are traitours, the executioner, having cutt of their heads, doeth hold them vp in his handes,  & shew them to the people: so I, having thus beheaded, as it were, these your six examples, I meane, the reason drawne from them, perhaps (notwithstanding your confident assertion that no such exceptions can bee taken against them ) might hold them vp in my handes, and shew that they are dead, by the like or more absurd consequutions from other circumstances thereof. For example, in one or two, the chiefest of them, the first of eche sexe, Euclides , and Euphrosyna ; the storie of Euclides is, that when the  626 Athenians , hauing their neighbours of Megara in great hatred, had decreed that if any of the men of that citie were found within Athenes , he should suffer death: Euclides being of it, and loth to lose the benefit of the schoole of Socrates , with whom hee vsed to be at Athenes and to heare him, before that law was made, did cloth himselfe in womans attire towardes evening; went from his house in Megara to Athenes , vnto Socrates ; enioyed his speech and conference some parte of the night time; and when day approched, returned home againe a litle more then twentie miles in the same attire. Now, if this were lawfully done, because he did it: then  627 William Bishop of Ely , who, to saue his honour and wealth, became a  628 greene-sleeues, going in womans raiment lesse way then twenty miles, from Douer castle to the Sea side, did therein like a man; although the wemen of Douer , when they had found it out by plucking downe his muffler  & seeing his new-shauen beard,  629 called him a monster for it: then with vs a scholer, who thinketh of some man, as Euclide did of Socrates , and can not well frequent his house in the day time for suspitio of lewdnes with his Xanthippe , or of Poperie, may come like a maiden thither in the night: then our Vniuersitie Statute of night-walkers would be taken away, or qualified at least; and if our Proctors meete one like a woma at midnight, they must not be suspicious; some studious youth, it may be, come from Wickam or Beaconsfield , and daring not to trauaile by day for theeues through Shotouer, is going to some learned man. In like sort, touching Euphrosyna , a maide of Alexandria , (of Antioche ; you name her, by slippe of penne or memorie) the storie is, that  630 she, desiring much to liue in an Abbay like a monke,  631 forsooke not onely her father, who had brought her vp to be a staffe in his olde age,  632 comfort in his weaknes to him; but also a  633 worthy, noble, vertuous gentleman, to whom she was betrothed; clad in mans apparell she came vnto the Abbat; and being asked of him who she was, from what place, & for what cause she came , she answered, that  634 her name in deede was Smaragdus, and she was of the Emperours Court, and came to that Abby to leade a holy life, if she might be admitted ; and so finding fauour to be admitted as a man, she liued there  635 eight and thirty yeares in mans apparell. Whereof if you inferre againe, as you doe, Euphrosyna did it, Ergo lawfull ; a better proofe, I grant, then Achilles did it, or Mocedonians did it , because they were profane men,  636 Euphrosyna is a Saint; but as you reason thus: likewise may an other in the same moode and figure; Euphrosyna , through a desire of moonkish perfection, refused to honour her father; Ergo 637 Christ did wrongfully checke the Scribes and Pharises for breaking Gods commandements to keepe traditions of men: Euphrosyna chose rather to be with others then with him to whom she was betrothed; Ergo Moses erred in teaching that a 638 maide bethrothed is a 639 Wife, & that 640 the wife should cleaue inseparably to her husband: Euphrosyna lyed for a vantage; Ergo St. 641 Iohn was a precisian, who condemneth all lyes: Euphrosyna conuersed in mens apparell, amongst men, eight and thirty yeares; Ergo D. Gager mistooke the place of Deuteronomie, when he gaue it this meaning, that to goe attired so ordinarily: is abomination to the Lord  . See you now what maner if true stories , of true all, you could haue vsed of both sexes? and how bold you were in saying that no such exceptions could be taken to them , as to the former? The which notwithstanding, were it as you say, you doe no more helpe your argument thereby, then if a traitour being beheaded, whom you favoured, you staied the executioner from holding vp his head, and sowed it on againe your selfe to his body with close and hansom stitches. For although no such exceptions could be taken to any of your examples, yet had I beheaded with the 642 the swoord of Gods woord the reason drawne from them: and with Iustinians swoord too, in that I adioyned for your sake out of your law, that we are to liue by lawes, not by examples: and to 643 looke, not so much what is done any where, as what ought to be done. Hereunto you adde an other new argument to shew that the place of Deuteronomie toucheth certaine cases onely, not generally forbiddeth a man to put on womans raiment: and that is, the opinion and iudgement of Diuines . For after you had deliuered these expositions of it, as liked by your selfe, that to weare such raiment of a lewde intent, the rather thereby, & the more safely to be in the company of wemen to bring some bad purpose about; or of an effeminate minde to suffer his heare to grow long, or to frizell it; or in speech, colour, gate, gesture, and behaviour to become womanish; or ordinarily so to conuerse among men and Wemen, against the course of all naturall, and civill regard, is abomination to the Lord: and noted it moreover to be expounded by other thus, that Wemen are forbidden to put on the armour of men, and men the raiment of wemen, because at that time it was superstitious, in as much as among the Gentiles wemen woare mens armour in the sacrifices of Mars, and men woare wemens ornaments and instruments, as distaffe, spindell, and such like, in the sacrifices of Venus; and therefore is it added that he who doth so is abominable to God because abomination is taken in the Scriptures commonly for idolatrie, or some thing belonging to idolatrie: but after you had sett downe these expositions, you say that all the Divines Whom ever you talked with of this matter, doe affirme the true meaning of that place to be conteined in these senses rehearsed . Wherein by alleaging the consent of all Diuines that euer you talked with hereof, as making for you, first, you grant your self never to haue talked here of with S. Cyprian, Chrysostome, Procopius, Thomas Aquinas, Liranus, Calvin, Hyperius, Beza, Bishop Babingto ; who making it a point annexed (as I shewed) to the seventh commandemet, doe imply the meaning thereof to be larger then your rehearsed senses: neuer with  644 Clemens Alexandrinus, 645 Gulielmus Parisiensis, 646 Dionysius Carthusianus, 647 Ferus, 648 Fagius, 649 Dan aeus ; who by handling it in like sort as the former, doe testifie their agreement with them in the conclusion: neuer with Tertullian ,  650 Lactantius, 651 Austin , the Bishops assembled in the sixth generall councell to the number of aboue two hundred and twenty: who partly by vrging that place against stage-players partly by condemning the thing it speaketh of, as lewde, doe evidently argue that they are of a different minde from you concerning it. Or sith you hauing had the most of these quoted in my letters to you, doe grant, for Cyprian namely  & the generall concel, that they make against you, & therefore seeme, in citing all that euer you talked with , to meane not such as you haue read and perused, but whom you haue asked thereof by woord of mouth: then, why should you more enforce against mee the sayings and iudgment of all that euer you talked with , then I against you the sayings and iudgements of all that euer I talked with? For as you report of them whom you talked with that they are very godly and excellently learned: in like sorte may I of them whom I talked with. And of mine you can not but the rather beleeue me, because I named you one, of whom your selfe answer, that you esteeme him to be a good man, a good scholer, and a good Preacher: you name me none of yours. Againe, there hath not any of yours in publike place, where men doe speake with greater advise to Christian auditories, avouched that which you hold: he, whom you commend, and commend iustly, hath preached the same that I teach. But, you say, he could not iustifie his speech, vttered so publikely, if it should come to due triall . But, I say, this speech of yours so publikely vttered is come to due triall, and you can not iustifie it. For he, hauing opened the woords of his text, 652 Let me not wander from thy commandements ,  & begonne to shew what a cotrary course vnto the Prophets practise we take now a daies, did prosequute it thus. To lett passe other things, let stage-playes in the Vniuersitie, and Maygames in the towne, speake whether these things be so. In 653 Deuteronomie the precept is, The woman shall not put on mans raiment, nether shall a man putt on Womans raiment; for all that doe so are abomination to the Lord: And it is the 654 Apostles precept to abstaine from all appearance of evill. Whether the former precept be broken in all playes, I know not. Sure very few or none there are, wherein either the one, or both, is not broken: either through the vile scurrilitie of the matter oftentimes vnbeseeming chast eares; or thorough the time for the preparing for them; or through the vnnecessarie charges about them; or through the manifold daungers comming both to actors, and spectators, by them . Herevpon, having added somewhat touching maygames, he made this exhortation. The Prophet prayeth vnto the Lorde, that hee may not Wander from his commandementes. His action ought to be thine instruction: and art thou so farre from folowing him that thou treadest his law under thy feete, and castest his Wordes behinde thee? Take heede, feare, and tremble; thou hast not to deale with man, but with God: who hath left thee his law, not to dally withall, or cunningly to deceve thy selfe with thine owne glosses vpon the same, but to bee the Witnesse of his will, and rule of thy life . This is the same speech, and all, that hee did vtter so publikely hereof, set downe in writing by him selfe before hee vttered it: a speech, that in this present triall betweene vs is already iustified, and shall bee declared farder to be  655 gold, silver, pretious stones , in the day of great triall . So shall the same doctrine delivered by S. Cyprian , the sixth generall councel, and other worthy men: when of the contrary side your Wood, hay, stubble , shal be consumed by fire . In the meane season your self doe lay open your own corrupt affections,  & blaze your own shame sundry wayes. One, in that you say, that you trust you shall not seeme to any man to wrong S. Cyprian & the rest if you folow the opinio of others both very goldy & excellentlie learned, who do interpret that text of Deuter. otherwise then hee, or they doe: specially in a case that toucheth you so neere, Wherin you are to defende your scelfe and many your good frends from the reproch of open infamie . For you speake therein, as if the question beeing of an other text,  656 Thou shalt not giue to vsurie unto thy brother, 657 which some newer writers expound against vnmercifull and cutting vsurie, as they terme it; not against all vsurie, as Austin with a number of aucient Fathers doeth; an vsurer should saye: I trust I shall not seeme to any man to Wrong S. Austin and the rest, if I folow the opinion of others, both very godly and excellenly learned, who doe expound that text otherwise then hee, or they doe; specially in a case that toucheth mee so neere, wherin I am to defend my selfe, and many my good frendes, from great discredit and discommoditie . An other, in that you adde, that you well wote it litle becommeth you to say, Da veniam Cypriane . In deede, for my selfe, whom in this you glance at, I must confesse I thought that it did become  658 me to saye, Da veniam Cypriane , vpon the circumstances that I said it: which, if it were a fault, though D. 659 Fulke thought otherwise, but if it were, it was of errour; and I will recant it, if you confute the  660 reasons that mooved me to thinke it did become mee so to say. But you, who wote well (by your owne confession) it litle becommeth you to say, Da veniam Cypriane doe thereby acknowledge, that although you are perswaded, as you pretend, the proper naturall sense of the worde of God to bee on your side, not on Cyprians ; in trueth you are not so. For else you would thinke that it should become you very well to say, Pardon mee, O Cyprian: sith you know, I hope, that it became the Apostles very well to say,  661 Wee ought rather to obey God then men . And if it doe litle become you to saye, Pardon mee, O Cyprian , when yet you dissent from him and contradict him: then you glozed in saying that with all humblenesse you reverence his autoritie ; seeing, to craue  662 leaue and pardon , in dissenting, is a signe of reverence . And if to vse so milde words, Pardon mee, O Cyprian, it become you little: how much lesse, to say, as in effect you doe,  663 It is a cursed glosse, O Cyprian, which thou makest? And if vnto Cyprian alone it litle becommeth you to say so much: how greatly vnbeseeming is it for you to say it vnto such a number, both of olde,  & new interpreters, besides him? Finally, for an vpshoote, where you say that he, as a godly man, was caried with a vehement & a perfit hatred against the detestable abuses of the heathen spectacles in his time: you graunt that the spectacles of playes sett foorth by you haue detestable abuses in them ; sith the  664 tragedies , the playing whereof he detesteth, are such as your Ulysses ; the  665 Comedies , as your Rivales: and so, how litle care you haue of being godly , who are not only not caried with an hatred , I say not, with a vehemet & perfit hatred, against them , but also dote vpon them, & write defenses of the. I iudge you not, your own mouth iudgeth you. As for those godly and learned Divines , who being talked withall by you touching the true sense of the place of Deuteronomie , did make that answer which you mention: what if they, misliking your resolute intent, did folow the example of Mich aeas the Prophet? 666 who being asked by king Achab Whether he should go against Ramoth Gilead to battell, or leaue off ; did answer him, Go vp, & prosper; & the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king . What if in a meriment, knowing why you asked it, they spake vnto you, as Cassellius a lawier vnto a certaine Roman? 667 Of whom, when Vatinius having had stones throwne at him by the people, to whom he was odious, did purpose to set forth a spectacle of fensers, and had gotten the magistrates to make proclamation that no man should cast ought into the place of spectacles saving an apple onely; Cascellius beeing asked, whether a pine apple were an apple, If thou meane to hurle it at Vatianus, it is , quoth he. What if you mistooke the summe of their answer, or a worde therein? they telling you perhaps that the true meaning of the place of Deuteronomie doeth containe those senses which are rehearsed by you; and you misconstruing them as if they had said that the true meaning thereof is contained in those senses rehearsed, and so may in no case bee extended farder . Of which three coniectures (you force me to divine of them, and betweene them, because you would not name the parties whom you cite, that by them selves I might learne what they said, and why,) the last in my opinion seemeth most probable: considering it is likely that godly learned men would looke what had bene written vpon the place by interpreters, and the interpreters, whose wordes, even translated by you in a maner, are an evident token what your Divines tolde you, doe specifie those thinges as meant, in such sort, that they deny not but more might bee meant; yea most of them affirme the generall to be meant also. For, of five particulars (so many you set down) Strabus , the autour of the ordinarie Glosse , hath two: namely that a man 668 must not become womanish in colour, gate , and so foorth; not  669 suffer his heare to grow long, or frizill it . The other three, that hee may not put on womans raiment ,  670 thereby the more safely to be in wemens company, to bring about some bad purpose; nor 671 ordinarily so to converse among men and wemen, against the course of naturall & ciuill regard; nor 672 to be womanlike in the sacrifices of Venus: these hath Gulielmus Alvernus , Bishop of Parise , and Carthusianus after him; Aquinas , and Liranus too, the last of them. Now Strabus saith not that those two thinges alone are meant: the rest doe say that so much more is meant then the other three, as prooveth my assertion. For the  673 Bishop of Parise , cited and abbridged by Dionysius Carthusianus , among sundry causes why the lawe of God should forbid a man to put on womans raiment, giveth this for one,  674 that a great occasion of provoking men to lust might be taken away. For 675 the appareil of wemen (saith he) is a great provocation of men to lust and leacherie: because a 676 Womans garment beeing put on a man doeth vehemently touch and moue him with the remembrance & imagination of a woman; and 677 the imagination of a thing desirable doth stirr up the desire . The same in 678 fewer words Aquinas doeth affirme. And Liranus farder, having declared what mooved him to preferre the last exposition (rehearsed by your self, though somewhat confusely, which I was bolde to mend in the recitall of it, the better here to be vnderstoode) saith, that if the text be meant of common apparell, 679 then is such an vse or rather abuse forbidden, because it is an occasion of wantonnes and lust . Wherein he hath relation to that, whereas the  680 word, used in the former branch of the sentence touching mens furniture not to be worne by wemen , doeth sometime signifie common apparell, sometime armour; he had said, that this place, he thought, the signification of armour fitted best: induced therevnto because he had read that wemen in the sacrifices of Mars did beare armour ; and the reason added, for all that doe so are abomination to the Lord , might wel enough agree, sith matters of idolatrie are commonly in the Scriptures termed abomination . But seeing it appeareth not by sufficient proofe that wemen woare mens armour in the sacrifices of Mars , or men woare wemens distaffes, spindles, and such like, in the sacrifices of Venus ; and the later branch of the law forbidding a man to put on womans 681 raiment , doeth shew that common apparell is meant in the former, as S. Hierome also in the vulgar 682 Latin translation hath noted: it foloweth that Liranus resteth and resolveth vpon the generall sense and exposition as truest. By consequence whereof the worde, abomination , must not be restrained to matters of idolatrie, but taken in his naturall meaning: according to the like vse therof in like places, where the  683 law condemneth those execrable villanies, to which this change of raiment provoketh and entiseth. Thus seeing that no one of all those interpreters, by whom the expositions, which you rehearse, are sett down, denieth that the law extendeth farder then your specialties,  & most of them affirme it: I feare it were a fault in me to beleeve you, that godly learned Divines , with whom you talked thereof, should all avouch vnto you the thing you father on them. Howbeit, if they did, and you will needes enforce their testimonie against me; mine aunswer made to Cyprian , to them I must apply: The law forbidding men to put on wemens raiment, saith that all who doe so are abomination to the Lorde. What? And haue godly learned Divines said otherwise? Pardon me, ye godly & learned Divines; I would beleeve you gladly, but that beleeving you I should not beleeve the word of God . And I assure my selfe so much of their modestie, that though you, with  684 Gregorie Martin , doe taunt me for my presumptuous saying, Pardon mee O Cyprian: yet, sith  685 Austin thought hee might, without any disgrace vnto Cyprian , allow of Tychonius the Donatists exposition as better fitting a place of scripture, then his did; they will not take it hardly that I preferre the iudgement of Cyprian , with Austin , and such, so many other both olde and new interpreters, before theirs in this point. But you, to cutt the cable of my cheefest anker,  686 the sacred anker , as they terme it, which is, the generalitie of the lawe it selfe, pronouncing all abominable who change their raiment so, betake your selfe at the last to this desperate refuge, that though the proposition be a generall affirmatiue, All men are abomination who put on womans apparell , yet in your cases it suffereth exception . I call this refuge desperat, because your owne handling thereof doeth seeme to argue, that when you came vnto it, you did treade on thornes; and felt that you should bee pitifully pricked, if you stoode long vpon it. For when, vnto the rules of law which I cited, that every speciall is suspended when the generall is suspended, and hee who forbiddeth the generall will not haue the speciall practised , you had replied that these rules are to bee understoode of those generals that absolutely command, and necessarily comprehend their specials sub potestate sua, not those which must endure controlment as it were, & suffer exceptions to restraine their power ; you giue this reason of it: For generall propositions, both in Divinitie, and Law, doe usually admitt particular exceptions and limitations, qu ae derogant generalitati: of which sort this proposition, that we haue in hand, is; as there are many mo of like nature, which you could alleage (you say) to illustrate these rules, but that they are plaine to me, and you are weary already, and haue a great way yet to goe, and feare that I am starke tyred with your tedious discourse . It is recorded by  687 historians that the Parthians vsed to flye fr o their enemies, & withal to strike the with arrows shot backward. Whervpo  688 Horace, affirming that he wrote no verses at al, when he wrote many , doeth compare himself to  689 them, who fought most, when they preteded flight. You resemble the Parthias in your 690 couragious flying: you will not seeme to withdraw your selfe, as overcome, but as weary with killing,  & having other exploits to doe, and taking pitie of me. Only you differ fro them, in that you shoote no arrowes while you are flying away; which else I might be afraid of, as  691 Horace saith their  692 souldiers were. For your axiome vrged in maner of a proofe, that generall propositions both in Divinitie, and Law, doe vsually admitt particular exceptions ; prooveth iust nothing: vnlesse peradventure you thinke that in good Logicke this argument will hold: Some generall propositions , for the word vsually betokeneth some not all; some therfore doe admit particular exceptions; Ergo the proposition we haue in hande doeth to . A shaft to vnshapen without head or feather, that although the stele, I meane the antecedet therof, be wel wrought,  & many examples might you alleage to illustrate it , if need were: yet your self durst not as much as make a shew of nocking, and drawing it, to shoote it of with an Ergo . But I of the contrary side will so encounter this devise of yours, that there shall no more life be left therein, then there was in  693 Achab the evening after he was wounded. And that by meanes of this argument. No particular exception is good against a generall proposition in Divinitie , saue onely such as Scripture maketh and warranteth. But your asseveration, that men may put on wemens raiment in stage-playes, is a particular exception not warranted by Scripture, against the generall proposition that all who doe so are abominable . Therefore mens wearing of wemens raiment on stages can not bee good in Divinitie. The major of which syllogisme the Lawe (to goe no farder) matched with Divinitie by your selfe in this case of rules and limitations, propositions & exceptions, wil approove vnto you. For if against a generall rule and proposition, as for example sake, that  694 right ought alwayes to bee done, a man of 695 C aesars minde should by way of exception and limitation say, that it ought in deede, save when a kingdome may bee gotten by doeing injurie and wrong: must wee allow this exception? No. And why? Because it is not warranted by any text of Lawe. Hence is it that  696 Bartolus , and Glossa communis after him, affirming absolutely that where the law distinguisheth not, we may not distinguish , doe shew that they meane this, not of any one lawe, but of the whole body, to weete, that  697 Wee may not distinguish, vpon a law, vnlesse that law by some other law be so distinguished . Likewise, in Divinitie , if against the doctrine of  698 doeing righteousnes at all times (to presse the same example) a woman like 699 Iezabel , or men like the Elders and Governours , whom shee wrote to, should say that generall rules may admitt exceptions, and righteousnes is requisit to be done at all times, save when land may bee gotten by suborning false witnesses, or a king pleased by shedding innocent blood: this might be very iustly called a  700 cursed glosse , because the Scripture doeth not teach in any place that it is lawfull to doe evill for advantage, or gratifying of Princes. Neither could the  701 Apostle rightly praise the Scripture , as serving to furnish a man of God perfitly vnto all good workes , if a worke therein commanded or forbidden generallie, as good or naught, were contrariwise abominable or allowable in particulars not declared by Scripture . Which mooved S. Austin , among lessons given for the right expounding therof, to make this one, that  702 doutfull points of Scripture ought to be cleared by the Scripture it selfe, because 703 all such thinges as touch faith and maners are sett downe plainly in the Scripture . True it is therefore that no particular exception, in Divinitie, may be admitted against a generall proposition, vnlesse the Scripture warrant it: which was the first parte of my syllogisme. The next, that your assertion touching mens wearing of wemens raiment in stage-playes, is a particular exception not warranted by Scripture against a generall proposition : must needes be graunted also. Specially by you: who, having talked therof with Divines , both many, and excellently learned , perceaue that none of them could bring foorth any warrant out of Scripturo for it. Wherefore, the conclusion, against your stage-play-wemen, may cause both them and you to dye your faces with that colour, which a  704 Philosopher termed well  705 the colour of vertue : and I pray God it doe. So the commandement, that a man shall not put on womans raiment , being prooved to reach vnto all in generall, even such, as for the saving of honour, wealth, or life, doe it, much more whom nothing moveth thereto but a playing humour: it foloweth to be sifted whether there bee truth and weight in that you adde, that your players did not weare wemens raiment . A thing avouched by you in like sort almost, as if  706 Achab being wounded to death with an arrow sticking in his side, should haue said, I am not hurt . But this, which, if hee had brought reason to perswade men, he might haue seemed desirous to bee madde with reason, you labour to confirme, saying that you may not in deede be said at all to weare wemens apparell, because wearing implieth a custome and a common use of so doing: whereas you doe it for an hower, or two, or three, to represent an others person, by one that is openly knowne to be as hee is in deede . For aunswer wherevnto, first, passing over your idle addition concerning the  707 ende and  708 circumstance of your vsing it; which I terme idle , because if men should vse it still to whatsoever ende, and openly knowne to be the same they are, as 709 Sporus was, they may indeede bee said to weare it, you will graunt : but first if it be onely for an hower, or two, or three , that you doe it; where are your wemen dressed? by whom? at what time? all at the same moment they come vpon the stage? and hath none bene dressed at noone, to play at night? and hath it not bene towards midnight, ere some playes ended? Next, if it be true, that wearing implieth a custome and a common vse of so doeing : then belike it may not be said that Nero the Emperour did ever weare any garment. For  710 hee did never put on any garment twise, as 711 Suetonius writeth: and therefore had no custome and common vse of any . Furthermore, suppose that you might not bee said to weare wemens apparell ; yet are you not the neerer to that which you intend: sith the Scripture saith, that a man shall not put on womans raiment , and you doe put it on (I trow) when you play, whether you weare it, or no. Finally, the Prophets 712 word, betokening this in the originall text, is the very same with that whereby  713 the armour of Saul is described to haue bene put on David . Now if David who put off Sauls armour by and by, within halfe an howre, a quarter, or lesse much; yet had it put on, after the phrase of Scripture : may it not be said, that they, who went in wemens raiment certaine howres, did that which Scripture speaketh of, English it as you list, put on, or weare such raiment? Alas,  714 in how miserable plight is he , saith  715 Tullie, who can not deny that, which to confesse it is most shamefull ? I, with a litle change of his sentence, must lament your case, who dare not confesse that which to deny it is most shamefull. For how many hundreds are there of eye-witnesses, that your Euryclea, Melantho, Penelope, Phoedra, Nais , others, did weare wemens raiment? Howe many did obserue, and with mislike haue mentioned, that Penelopes maides did not onely weare it, but also sate in it among true wemen in deed, longer then David woare Sauls armour? neither were more knowne to them to bee men, then Achilles was at firste to Deidamia ; vntill they suspected it, seeing them entreated by the wooers to rise and danse vpon the stage. I wish there had not bene so bad a token to convince you; nor so many beholders to testifie thereof: though I am glad withall that they had such mislike of the thing testified. And this commoditie by it besides, that I might feare else, least you, who did before deny that men playing on your stage, are stage-players; and doe deny here that the players of wemens partes weare wemens raiment; would at length deny that you had any playes at all; and so accuse me of slaundering your friendes for being on the stage, when they were in their studies. The third head of reasons, knit vp vnder the title of losing time in  716 your speech, but containing losse of better things then time, I declared the strength of, chiefly by this argument. To imitate and resemble wantonnes, scurrilitie, impudecie, drunkennes, or any other misbehaviour, is a thing vnlawfull: But sundry misbehaviours were imitated and resembled by Penelopes wooers, her maides, Rivales, mariners, Ph aedra, the Nurse, the Nymph, and others in the playing of your tragedies and comedie: The playing therefore of them is to bee misliked . Whereagainst you say not much for the maior. Onely, for as much as I, beside a number both of divine autorities, and humane, avouching it, alleaged your owne consent too, in that you affirme that  717 it beseemeth not men to folow wemens maners : you say your meaning was, that it doth not beseeme them to folow wemens maners in the common course of life, to the perverting of the law of nature, honestie, and comelines; or for any evill purpose; yet a boy, by way of representation onely, may, not indecently, imitate maydenlie or womanlie demeanour . Which aunswer though it seemeth to deny your approoving of my reproofe in part, about young mens imitating of the maners of wemen: yet the greatest part thereof doeth it approoue. For I founde most fault with imitating the manners of strumpets and bawdes, Melantho, Ph aedra , the Nurse : and, I trust, you will not say that the demeanour of such vnmaidenly maidens,  & vnwemenly wemen, is either maidenly or womanly . But whatsoever you say touching your owne sentence, and after your common course of distinguishing interpret it as meant in the common course of life, to the perverting of the law of nature, honestie, and comelines, or for any evill purpose : it sufficeth mee, that you durst not apply these distinctions to the Scriptures, Fathers, or forein writers, by which I confirmed the major of mine argument and you acknowledge it to be truly confirmed. The minor is the hedge, whereat, as the lowest, you were in hope that you might leape over with lesse difficultie. And in this confidence you aske What proportion there is betweene those thinges, which I enlarge in my maior; and those thinges which in particular application against you, are vsed in my minor ? To the which question I will make no aunswer, till you haue considered and tolde me what proportion there is betwene an Elephant , and Maximinus the Emperour . But the minor of mine argument, whereto I must holde you, and not giue you leaue thus to runne at riott vpon every wandring conceit of proportions; the minor of mine argument, I say, is most certaine, & true, in every branch thereof. Though neither is your cunning and arte, by the way, to bee passed over, that wheras I having in generall disclosed the hurt of amatorie dansing, did note in particular your wooers dansing with their minions : you reply that they dansed onely two solemne measures, without any lighter galliard ; and herevpon you aske me, What Herod could be inflamed! What Propertius ravished? What flame of lust kindled thereby in mens heartes? What wounds of loue imprinted? whose senses could bee moved, or affections delited more then ought to bee, or may honestly bee? What enemies of chastitie made by this sight? what strong or constant heart vanquished; nay, what reede shaken thereby? What so much as flaxe or towe sett on fire ? Great crye, and litle wooll: as who say that I had applied all these things to dansing alone; and not diverse of them to amatorie kissing, amatorie embracing, and amatorie pangs expressed in most effectuall sort, togither with it. Or, as who saye farther, that none could be touched with anie sparke of lust by seeing the supposed gentlewemen danse so small a time, so grauelie with galant lustie yoonkers; because you, a marvellous indifferent iudge,  & well seene in thinges of this qualitie, doe pronounce that none could.  718 Lactantius , controlling a sentence wherein  719 Tullie had magnified the force of fortune, and giuen edge thereto with an interrogatio,  720 Who knoweth not that Fortune is of great force both wayes, either to prosperitie, or to adversitie? forsooth , saieth hee, I know it not . In like sort they whose iudgement herein is so much sounder, lesse daseled with affection and preiudice, then yours, as in matters touching God and true Religion, Lactantius was then Tullies , may answer your demaundes, that manie Herods might be inflamed, many a Propertius ravished thereby . For your partialitie and weaknes of sight doeth bewray it selfe, in that, where I had noted how your new Nymph , by liuely expressing of amorous panges, brought fewell enough to heate  & melt a hart of yce or snow: you reply, that shee hath bene woorse reported of to me a great deale, then shee did deserue, as I and the world shall one day see . Now shee was so reported of to mee by Lactantius , I meane, a man whose woord I offer you no wrong if I beleeue before yours; a man, that deserueth to be as well esteemed of, as he, for sundrie causes,  & for some, better; a man, who did report it, not surmise, but of knowledge; not of heare-say, but of sight; not of that which might be, but which had hapned in senses and affections mooved and tickled with it. And the thing which the world and I should one day see , whereby your meaning shewed in the wordes ensuing, is, that shee did profer honest, lawfull, vertuous, mariage-meaning love , as  721 her speech committed now to print declareth; doeth not proove that he reported worse a great deale to me of her expressing those panges, then shee deserved . For that very  722 action, which shee did insinuate her selfe to be  723 enraged  & 724 burne with desire of, is  725 honest , and lawfull , belonging vnto vertuous and mariage-meaning loue . Yet if one should say, that the open dooing of it, like a  726 Cynicke , or vsing of sweete woordes and gestures tending to it, like  727 Bacchus and Ariadne, can not shake a reed , much lesse surprise or wound a strong and constant heart: hee might seeme vnwoorthie to be talked withall by men of ingenuous modestie and iudgement. Wherefore sith the profer of nothing else but honest and mariage-meaning love, made in woords only by a hansom boy apparelled like a woman did ravish a Propertius , and inflame an Herode ; notwithstanding you thought that it could not possibly worke anie such effect, as I and the world also should perceive: your thicke interrogations wherewith you come vpon mee, as with so manie foines and prickes of a sword, to make me yeelde that youthes attired in wemens raiment,  & dansing a few solemne measures like 728 Sempronia, can not set flaxe on fire ; in shewe they doe brave it, as if no way but one; in deed they drawe not so much blood, as a needle would. But be it as be may, for the forcible operation and working of the poyson, which neither I affirmed to be altogether so quicke in every branch of the minor, concerning your players, as in some alleadged for proofe of the maior; nor doe you rightlie iudge of, who acknowledging it to be as poyson in the major for bad effects of such playes , would haue it triacle in the minor for good effectes of yours : the minor of mine argument, as I saide, is certaine and true in euery braunch thereof. One alone, amongst all that I specified, you take exception at; which is the Nymphes part. And therein I mistooke a circumstance, I graunt. How be it I must tell you withall that I mistooke it so, and such a circumstance, that the righting of it doth not onely not diminish the certaintie and truth of my minor, but rather much encreaseth it. For when the graue and godly man, whom I spake of, had shewed me his mislike of amorousnes and drunkenes expressed in your playes; and namely, for the former, had noted the mischief of the representing those pangs so effectually by the Nymph , a new part inserted into Seneca : I not being farder inquisitiue thereof, did thinke that you supposing the person of a bawde was not set foorth lively and skilfully enough by Seneca in Ph aedras Nurse , had brought in a Nymph to perswade Hippolytus that which the Nurse could not; and therevpon I mentioned the Nurses and the Nymphes bawderie . Nowe, by your publishing of that which you inserted, I perceave you added a new bawd in deed, but a man bawde, Pandarus ; and gaue the Nymph an other part almost as shamefull: so that, I confesse, I was, through some negligence, doubly overseene; first, in naming Titius , or rather Titia , for Scius ; againe, in imagining one naughty part added by you vnto Seneca , whereas you added two. For, whatsoever you say of your Nymphes wooing and profer to Hipolytus: S. 729 Ambrose , on the  730 Scripture touching Rebeccas spousals, saith that a woman should giue vnto her parents the choise of her husband, 731 least shee bee reputed too malapert and wanton, if she take vpon her to make her owne choise :  732 for shee must rather seeme to be desired by a man, then to desire a man her selfe . And you should haue noted, that  733 Erasmus words, alleaged by your selfe to iustifie the Nymphes action, are, Si res honesta est matrimonium, & procum agere honestum est. Procum agere , hee saith, of the masculine gender; not of the feminine, Procam . A thing, from allowing whereof hee was so farre; much more from terming them tetrica ingenia & ab omnibus Gratiis aliens , who doe disallow it; though you, not contented to adioyne this also, enlarge it with comparison of your speech to Momus ; as if Erasmus likewise blamed vs for  734 accounting all matters touching love, and pleasant mirth, vnchast , iumpe as your selfe doe for  735 calling that vnhonest and wanton, which is merry and light : but Erasmus was so farre from allowing a maide to bee a wooer, or wooesse, what shall I name it? that in expresse wordes  736 he disalloweth it as  737 vnseemely . By the iudgment therefore of your owne witnesse it was a misbehauiour in Nais to be wooing. What? And was it not a misbehaviour also in her to be railing? to say vnto Hippolytus , that his mother was a 738 tiger, his father was a 739 bull, him selfe a 740 proud, a cruell, a barbarous savage man ? to banne him? to curse him? to wishe him the most horrible kind of death that might be? and all because he would not leave his lawfull libertie to satisfie her lust? Or would your Erasmus haue reprooved me as  741 rigorous, to say no more, for blaming this in a maiden; and him selfe haue liked it,  742 who misliked in men that they faine and spread lewde reportes of such as yeeld not to their wooing ? Truelie, for mine owne part, albeit Nais had not transgressed anie dutie with so fowle language, and might without impeachment of maidenly modestie, haue sued to be Hippolytus bedfellow: yet should I haue thought it a thing vnbeseeming a youth of tender yeares to be inured, and taught, how hee may by amorous speeches, lookes, and gestures, wooe for a husband, or a wife. But seeing she did that which can not be cleered of wantonnes and scurrilitie: my minor (notwithstanding the circumstance I mistook) is most true and certaine for the branch concerning her. Yea, it is as certaine and true, with alteration of the name only, even for the very crime too wherewith I charged her in steede of her brother Pandarus : that is to say, for bawderie . Which worde why you should censure by terming it the brode name of bawderie , I know not: sith the Latin wordes, leno , and lena , haue none in our English correspondent to them (for ought that I know) but a bawde ; and lenocinium, bawderie . How commeth it to passe then that my vse of the English name should be faultie: where  743 you doe vse the  744 Latin without fault, I trust, and that in the person of modest, chast, Hippolytus ? The truth is that I should haue spoken broder, so to terme it, and vsed wordes of greater eagernes and sharpnes. For his practise is bawderie, who entiseth any to single fornication. What is it farther to adulterie? What farther yet, to incest? And to doe this simply, as incestuous  745 Amnon did, were abominable. What, to doe it in such sort, as the  746 Nurse in Seneca ? but chiefly as your  747 Pandarus ? My speech was too minsing, when I named bawderie . If I had termed it most filthy beastly bawderie , my wordes had bene broder, though not brode enough yet. But to returne to mine argument, the maior and the minor beeing thus confirmed, the conclusion foloweth necessarily, and should haue bene graunted by you in my iudgement. So many heads, so many wittes: your fansie lead you an other way. And therefore, according to the young Scholers axiome , that alwayes when both the pr aemisses are true, the conclusion must be denied : You deny that the playing of your tragedies and comedie is to bee misliked and censured as vnlawfull. To the fine perswading whereof you take advantage by somewhat that I said: and the point of my sworde, which pearceth through the heart of your defense of playes, you striue (though in vaine, for want of strength) to draw out, and turne against my selfe. For, because I amplified the vnlawfulnes of the thing by the inconvenience and hurt which it breedeth, principally to the actors , in whom the earnest care of liuely representing the lewde demeanour of bad persons doeth worke a great impression of waxing like vnto them; next, to the spectators , whose maners are corrupted by seeing and hearing such matters so expressed: you encounter mee herein with two disputes; one, that neither the spectators of your playes, nor the actors, could receve any hurt thereby ; an other, that no evill affections could bee stirred vp thereby, but rather good . Which points it is a worlde to see how you struggle to proove by shewes of reason; and it will not fadge. Besides, were they prooved: my conclusion standeth neverthelesse entier, because neither of them doeth touch a heare of the pr aemisses . The shewes of reason firste, wherby you would proove that neither the spectators, nor actors could receue any hurt by your playes , are these, that for your penning you are base and meane, as I see , (so you tell mee) and specially for Womanly behaviour you were so carelesse, that when one of your actors should haue made courtsie like a woman, hee made a legge like a man; and your spectators could not greatly charge your actors with any such diligence in meditation and care to imprint any passions . Of which three assertions the last is already disprooved in part by Nais : and your selfe, qualifying it with the worde greatly , declare that in your conscience your actors might bee charged with earnest meditation and care to imprint passions , though not greatly charged . The middest, of one actor forgetting his woman hoode, doeth no more argue that you were carelesse for womanly behaviour, and for other also, but specially for womanly : then the oversight of a  748 Greeke stage-player , who, when he said, O God , pointed to the ground; when he said, O earth , cast vp his hand to heaven ward, doeth argue that the Romans, Roscius, Æsopus , but specially the Greekes , were carelesse for seemely gesture on the stage. The formost, like the rest; and worthy to bee their ringleader for vntruth, or trifling. For neither doe I see, that in your penning you are base and meane , if you speake of all, and comprise loue-speeches too, as  749 that of Nais : neither if you were so, is it any proofe that you could not hurt; for base and meane writers may vtter evill speeches,  & 750 evill speeches corrupt good maners : and, beside your owne, you played Seneca too, whose penning neither  751 Scaliger , nor  752 Lipsius , nor  753 your selfe, doe vilisie as base; so that the very stile of somewhat, which you played, might worke strong impressions by your own verdict. Wherefore when of those three assertions you inferre, that neither the spectators, nor actors, could receaue any hurt by your playes : you dispute in like sort, as if to controll  754 Suetonius and  755 Tacitus , who say, that, when Rome was burnt in Neros time, some did of purpose fire it, one should reason thus: The stuffe which those incendiaries did vse, was 756 towe and firebrands scarse kindled, as you see: and specially for certaine of them, who brought that stuffe, they were so carelesse of setting fire on houses, that 757 they fell to pillage, carying things away out of houses vnburnt; & such as they robbed and spoyled with sword and fire could not greatly charge them with any such diligence in paines and care to burne the citie: and so neither the citie suffred hurt by them, nor they did any hurt . Strange, that Suetonius and Tacitus should say the contrarie. But sometimes good Homer him selfe will fall a slumbering . Now as you haue prooved thus, that neither actors nor spectators could receiue hurt by your playes : semblably you proove that no evill affections could be stirred vp therby, but rather good . For in Ulysse reduce (say you) who did not love the fidelitie of Eum aeus, and Philaetius, towardes their maister; and hate the contrary in Melanthius? Who was not mooved to compassion to see Ulysses, a great Lord, driven so hardly, as that hee was faine to be a begger in his owne house? Who did not wish him well, and all ill to the wooers; and thinke them woorthily slaine for their bloody purpose against Telemachus, and other dissolute behaviour, not so much expressed on the stage, as imagined to bee done within ? And so you goe forward with a troupe of questions, urging it as certaine that all your spectators did admire the constancie of Penelope, and dispraise the lightnes and bad nature of Melantho, and thinke her iustlie hanged for it; all did prayse the patience, wisedome and secrecie of Ulysses, & Telemachus his sonne; all were glad to see Vlysses restored to his wife, and goods, and his mortall enimies ouerthrowne and punished : againe, that in Rivales, all might be delited to see the fond behaviour of country-wooing, expressed by civill men , or the vanitie of a bragging souldier; all might detest drunkennes by seeing the deformitie of drunken mariners actions : that in Hippolytus likewise all yong men did wish them selues to be as chast as Hippolytus was; all the spectators detested the love of Phoedra; approved the grave co usell of the Nurse to her in secret; none of them could be the woorse for her wooing Hippolytus in so generall termes; all did wish that Theseus had not bene so credulous: and were sory for the cruell death of Hippolytus . The most of which things you affirme they did, not meaning to pronounce of their secret thoughts, but that your playes were naturallie to woorke these effectes: as appeareth by that in some of the branches you say that the spectators might doe so, or so; yea, could not be the worse . And the same appeareth farther, by that you adde, that these & such like passions were, or might be mooved in your playes without hurt, at the least, to any man: as in other tragedies, who doeth not hate (say you) the furie of Medea; the revenge of Atreus; the treason of Clyt aemnestra, and Ægysthus; and the crueltie of Nero? Contrariwise who doeth not pitie the rage and death of Hercules; the calamitie of Hecuba and her children; the infortunat valour of Oedipus; the murder of Agamemnon; the banishment of Octavia; and such like ? You take your selfe therefore hereby to haue prooved that no evill affections could bee stirred vp by your playes in any: at the least, no evill; and many good perhaps . But why in the particular point touching Hippolytus , in which it most behooved you (because of your new peece of Pandarus and Nais ) to shewe that good affections might be stirred vp by his part in all, and no evill in any: Why demanded you, What young man did not wish him selfe to bee as chast, as Hippolytus was, if he were not so already ? Why asked you not generally, as in the rest, who did not ? was it because you thought, that some elder men did not wish them selves as chast, as hee was: but were stirred vp by Ph aedras pangs, and Pandarus reasons, to wish the like motion had bene made to them? Or, that any maidens were vpon the stage, who could haue bene contented to become vnchast in yeelding to Hippolytus that which he would not graunt to Nais 758 chastlie? As for the young men of our Vniversitie who were present at it, I am hartilie glad if they were so minded: and doe reape my self the greater comfort of it, the more  759 I haue commended his example to them. But if they wished so, when they saw your play: it came more of somewhat which they brought thither, then which they found there. For, by your instruction, the death of Hippolytus should haue serued to teach them, that they must never denie vnto a Nais , or Phoedra , such requestes: as  760 your self tell them, on speech concerning wemen; Quas ne quis vnquam spernere dehinc audeat, Hippolytus ecce horribile documentum dedit; Impun e temnat nemo terrestres Deas . And what if all, who were present, not the young men only, did admire the constancie of Penelope ? Could no evill affection bee therefore stirred in anie by seeing a boy play so chast a part? Happy would Lucretia then haue thought her selfe. For shee was not inferiour in chastitie to Penelope : and when Tarquin saw her, he saw  761 her employed as a  762 most vertuous woman. Yet, for all the wonderment he had of her vertue: he was more inflamed with loue of her beautie. Yea,  763 the very sight of her chast behauiour stirred vp his wicked lust. Moreouer, if Vlysses begging in his owne house, did move all the spectators to have compassion of him , and thereby grew no hurt to them: yet into the actor might there grow some hurt by acquainting him self with hypocriticall faining of  764 lyes,  765 hunger, beggerie,  766 wrath, and shedding of blood. As  767 Æ sopus 768 playing the part of Atreus in a tragedie (one of your examples of passions mooved, without hurt, at the least, to any man ) grew to such a rage by thinking and advising how he might wreake his anger, and be revenged on Thyestes ; that with  769 his Mace royall hee strooke one of the servants running by, and slew him. And beside this hurt that possibly might grow, there did grow the suffering of such things at Melanthuis and Antinous handes, or  770 one of their heeles rather, as a  771 poore wretch in Terence thought too contumelious and base for him to suffer; & a  772 Parasite in Plautus counted a peece of his trade. Which reprochfull patience if you thinke, I say not, that all who saw it, praised it (in saying so you blemish your spectators much ;) but, that is was no hurt vnto your actor of Ulysses , because (as you distinguished on  773 Iuuenals wordes thereof) hee is a poore Scholler : you are not of  774 Tertullians , and  775 Nazianzenes minde, who note it for a staine in  776 what soeuer players, even in rascall Heathens; how much more would they, if not in Scholers, yet in Christians , whom Saint Paul exhorteth to  777 doe only those things which 778 adorne & set them out with coomly gravitie ? Now, if some might be the woorse for beholding or playing of the best partes, the partes of Vlysses , and Penelope : what harme might they receaue by the parts of the Wooers , of Melanthius , of Melantho, of a bragging souldier , of the drunken mariners , of the Nurse , of Phoedra ? In some of which number your generall propositions, that all the spectators must needes bee mooved thus or thus thereby , are vntrue. In the rest, nay, in these too, manifest is the weaknes of your particular conclusions, that because good thoughts might be stirred vp in all the spectators by this or that part, therefore those parts could hurt no man . Besides, if by those partes no hurt could come to any, yet might there much by other which here you mention not: and so you come short of your conclusion generall, that no hurt could come to any by the passions that were mooved in your playes . Your generall propositions doe faile in the wemen: of whom you speake in such sort, that as  779 some by putting away a good conscience, made shipwracke of their faith : so it may bee feared that you, by putting trueth and singlenes away, will hazard the shipwracke of common sense and reason. For when maried women doe committ adulterie, all are not displeased with their lightnes and bad nature, nor thinke them woorthie of death for it. David had an other opinion of Bathseba , in the  780 sacred storie; the foole in the  781 Proverbes , of the strange woman ; the Trojans , in  782 your Homers, 783 Ilias , of Helena : and in his  784 Odyssea , the supposed Gods , that is to say, great persons, specially Mercurie , thought otherwise of Uenus . How can it bee then, that all should not onelie dispraise the bad nature and lightnes of Melantho , an vnmaried harlot, but also account her iustlie hanged for it ? whom it is more likely that some would haue stepped foorth to begge from the gallowes, at least the loving wooer, who had said vnto her,  785 O most faire Melantho, 786 O sweet Melantho ; if hee had thought that shee should haue bene hanged in earnest. Like probabilitie hath it, that all would approove the Nurses grave counsell given to Phoedra in secret : when the counsell giuen openlie to men, by the  787 Prophetes , by the  788 Apostles , yea, by  789 Christ him selfe, wherwith this  790 hypocrites counsell deserveth not for gravitie to be named the same day, was not approved by all . As for that concerning Phoedra you demaund, who could be the worse for her wooing Hippolytus in so generall termes : aske 791 Caracallus the Emperour ; in whose sight when his stepmother Inlia , being madde with the same love to him-ward, that Phoedra to Hippolytus , did vncover and make bare, as it were through negligence, the most of her body, his heart conceived fyre straight,  792 his toung disclosed it; and by her wooing of him  793 in more generall termes, then Phoedra wooed Hippolytus , his consent was woon to her incestuous lust. But of all absurd speeches in this matter, that may beare the bell, that having asked who could be the woorse for her wooing Hippolytus in so generall termes , you inferre thereon: The drift whereof if it had bene to procure an honest honorable mariage, as it was covertlie to allure him to incest, he might very well haue listned to it . As if one of them, vnto whom  794 Salomon attributeth this speech, Cast in thy lott among vs, wee will all haue one purse, should say that none could bee the worse for his entising in so generall termes: the drife whereof if it had bene to draw men to lawfull warre against enemies, as it was to vnlawfull spoiling of the innocent, they might very well haue listned to it . Your particular conclusions doe faile both in the women (for a surplusage of your former default concerning them)  & in the men also. For although Melanthos lightnes and bad nature had bene dispraised by all : yet some might be corrupted by Melanthos loosenes and 795 bad lascivious talke, vnlesse Saint  796 Paul erred. And the graue counsell given vnto Phoedra by the Nurse in secret , might hurt vnwarie lovely youthes, as doeth a scorpion, with the 797 taile thereof. And Phoedras generall termes might bee as  798 Ioabs right hand , wherewith he tooke Amasa by the beard to kisse him : when her speciall drift being no more covered the Ioabs sword was, might in the meane season wound Amasa to death, and shed his bowells to the ground . The same is apparant in the scurrilitie of Melanthius , the lewde or fonde trickes of the wooers, the vanitie of the bragging souldier, the beastlines of the drunken mariners . For  799 Aristotle wishing a lawe to be made in all well ordered cities, that  800 young men should neither see tragedie played, nor Comedie, vntill in riper yeares they be past danger of being hurt thereby , groundeth his advise on reason and experience; because things which young men receave, doe sticke fast by them: and therefore sith principall care ought to bee taken that they may proove vertuous,  801 they should be kept fro hearing any ill speeches, and seeing any ill deedes; chieflie such deedes and speeches, as are lewde or hatefull. So that, where you tell vs in defense of the spectacle of your drunken mariners , that it Was not possible that anie man should be provoked to drunkennes thereby : albeit this were true, whereof yet I doubt, or rather I dout not, considering that many are overprone to folow anie vice or evill, which they see or heare, as an  802 autour praised by your selfe observeth out of dailie experience in childre swearing great oathes, and speaking lascivious and vncleane wordes by such example of other ; but if it were true, there might neuerthelesse a deaw of that poyson , which Aristotle mentioneth, infect some tender buddes, and anoy their fruit by the drunken songs, by the drunken speeches, by the drunken gestures of those drunken beastes. The greater is your fault, who say, the Lacedemonians are commended for causing their slaves, beeing drunke in deede, to be brought before their children, that they seeing the beastlie vsage of such men, might the more loth that vice: but you much better expressing the same intent, not with drunken, but with sober men, counterfeiting such vnseemelie manners, are the lesse therefore to be reprehended . Wherein how overthwarthly you affirme your selues to haue done much better then the Lacedemonians , whose fact is commended; and yet conclude that you are the lesse therefore to be reprehended , as if your conscience tolde you that either your fact is not like to theirs, or hath some notable difference whereby it is made worse and woorthy of reproofe, though of the lesse reproofe, the liker it is to theirs in part: we shall the more easilie perceaue, if we consider how the commender of it (why signified you not his name, or place?) Plutarch, 803 doeth likewise by and therevpon comend them for that  804 they neither heard Comedie, nor Tragedie, least they should in earnest, , or iest, lende eare to those who gainsaid the lawes . For hereby I gather, that they did not purposely make their slaves drunken; against  805 their lawes had that bene: but  806 when the slaves were drunke, they turned the example to their childrens benefite, that, by seeing swine wallowing in the myre of vomit, and so foorth, they might detest drukennes. As with vs when theeves are hanged, or hoores carted, we shew them to our children, to breede a detestation of theft and hoordome in them. Wherevpon if Seius should say, it were much better that true men should faine them selves to be theeves, display some theevish pranke of theirs vpo a stage, and seeme to be hanged for it; or that chast maidens and yong men should couterfeit the misdemeanour of hoores  & knaves, and openly representing the filthy act of their vncleannes, bee taken in it, and putt to shame: your selfe, I am perswaded, would iudge his better to be woorse ; at least in the latter point of knaves and hoores, because the shame, that lighteth on the after the fact done, may profit the beholders; but the doeing of it, and of things tending to it, hath turpitude that may corrupt them. Which censure if you will apply to your fact compared with the example of the Laced aemonians , you may see their drunken slaves doe little helpe to iustifie your mariners: because the  807 rotton or stinking talke (as  808 Scripture termeth it) which your mariners vsed before and at their quaffing, would not haue bene suffered among the Laced aemonians to be soong or said in their childrens hearing, no not by enterlude-players. Neither haue you greater reason to commende and extoll the woorthy play-felowes of your mariners by Catos name and credit, in that you aske; What Cato might not bee delited to see the fond behaviour of Country-wooing expressed by civill men, or the vanitie of a bragging soldier? For Cato , not the younger, whose Stoicall austeritie  809 Tullie findeth fault with, but whom without such note  810 he prayseth, the elder,  811 did put out of the number of Senatours one Manilius , because in the day time he had kissed his wife in his daughters sight:  & him selfe tooke no lesse heed of speaking filthy woords in his sonnes presence, then he would haue done in presence of the Vestall virgins ; nor ever would enter into the bathe with him, least his sonne should see him naked. And can you thinke that any of this mans disposition, what delite soever him selfe might haue taken in that which could not taint his gravitie and constancie, would haue bene delited, delited? nay, contented to beholde the filth of your country-wooers in the mouthes  & actions of Scholers like his sonne, before so great a companie both of sonnes and daughters; in whose  812 eares, & eyes, a  813 Po et , no way comparable with Cato for severitie and care of vertuous nurturing  & training vp of youth, detesteth the expressing of any one such foolerie, as your country-wooers did expresse a number? As for the vanitie of your bragging souldiour, I marvell that intending to proove there could no evill affection hee stirred vp thereby in anie , you durst mention Cato : whe I had shewed that  814 Plautus , a farre looser person, and better experienced in matters of this kinde, doeth note that  815 mens maners are woont to be corrupted and made worse by playes which haue a bawde, or hoore, or bragging souldier in them. The dissolute behaviour of your courtly-wooers, you say, was not so much expressed on the stage, as imagined to be doon within. Not so much on the stage: much on the stage therefore; and in deed too much. Yet this would proove, I graunt, that small harme could be done by the playing of their partes, vnlesse that were true which the Scripture saith:  816 How great a pile of wood how litle fire kindleth? Melanthius alone of all the sotts, or varlets, whom you namelie specifie, hath no amplification of Laced aemonians , or Cato ; no extenuation of not so much on the stage , to grace the vngratiousnes of his fowle scurrilitie. The likelier is Aristotles sentence and autoritie to prevaile with you, that yong men might be stained by hearing of his railing, his  817 Iambicall speeches, as Aristotle termeth them. At least Syr Thomas Eliots 818 wordes of playing at footeball , that therein is nothing but beastly furie, & extreeme violence, whereof proceedeth hurt, and consequentlie rancour & malice doe remaine with them that be wounded , may moove you to thinke that there was daunger of anoying our youth by Melanthius action,  819 striking and girding (like Silenus 820 asse) at Vlysses with his heele . For boyes affecting footebale, will argue peradventure, that seeing such horseplay was vsed by Melanthius & he might strike Vlysses body with his foote; more lawfull should it bee for them to strike a ball so: and what Cato would not be delited to see them breake one an others shinnes? or who was that vicechancellour, what a convocation, that made our Vniversitie statute to the contrarie? Thus are your particular conclusions overthrowne, euen by those passions which the parties mentioned might imprint in others. How much more in themselues? Whose mindes in what danger they are of infection, by meditating and studying sundrie dayes, or weekes, how to expresse the manners of wantons, or drunkards, or country-wooers lively, the seeing wherof played but an hower, or two, might taint the spectators: I wish with all my hart, that I may rather seeme in vaine to have feared, then they should by experience feele. Your conclusion generall faileth more and more yet, because evill affections might be stirred vp by other partes then these: as namelie, by your new parts of Pandarus and Nais . The former, after a sort confessed by your selfe, in that you demaund; who could be the woorse for Phoedras wooing Hippolytus in so generall termes ? For this doeth insinuate that through Pandarus wooing him in speciall termes, so speciall , that incestuous  821 Myrrha went no farder (as  822 Ovid thought fitt to describe it) not in her secret  823 thoughts, some might be the woorse. The later, most evident by that which is 824 recorded to haue come to passe in the Citie of Abd era . Where, when at midsummer, in very hott weather, Andromeda (a Tragedie of Euripides ) being played, manie brought home a burning ague from the theater: about the seventh day folowing, they were ridde thereof, some by much bleeding, some by sweating, but all, as soone as they were abroade out of their beddes, did fall into a strange distemper and passion of a light phrensie. The which exciting them to say  & cry aloude such things as were sticking freshly in their memorie, and had affected most their minde,  825 they grewe all to Tragedie-playing, and full lustilie they sounded out  826 Iambicall speeches : their toungs harping chieflie on Euripides, Andromeda , and the  827 melodious woords of Perseus touching love. So that the whole citie was full of pale and thinne folke, pronouncing like stage-players, and braying with a loude voice, But O Cupido, prince of Gods and men , with the rest of that part: vntill at length the winter and colde, waxing great, asswaged their distemper, and eased them of their frantike follie. A  828 woorde to a wise man is enough. That speech, But O Cupido, Prince of Gods and men , vttered vnder Perseus , that is, a mans person, was of all likelyhoode lesse pearcing and patheticall, then yours, O quam iuvaret igne tam pulchro mori , vttered by Nais , a woman, and a Nymph . It was well that shee played in winter, not in summer. For  829 Perseus loved Andromeda in the way of mariage too, as Nais did Hippolytus . But the force of love-pangs, and the care of lawfulnes, ioyne not their dwelling houses together still in all heartes. Wherefore you are so farre off from having prooved that no evill affection could bee stirred vp in anie by your playes : that I can hardlie remember any evill affection, which might not be stirred vp thereby in many; not onely in the actors, but the spectators also. And I thinke your selfe, if you peruse advisedly this whiche I haue written, and diligentlie compare it with your Vlysses redux, Rivales, and Hippolytus , will take time of respitt before you name as much as one inordinate passion; whereto I shall not quote, at least one players part, perhaps two, or three, that may be as oile vnto the fire. Howbeit, had you prooved the contrarie hereof, yet is my conclusion entier, as I said, and your playes vnlawfull: because it is vnlawfull to imitate and resemble any misbehaviour; and your selfe can not denie but sundry lewdnesses were imitated and resembled in eche of your playes. Herein is that confuted withall by the way, which otherwhere you mention as an intent sufficient to iustifie  & warrant your coming on the stage : namely that you doe it to practise your style, either in prose or verse; to bee well acquainted with Seneca, or Plautus; honestly to embolden your youth; to trie their voices, & cofirme their memories, to frame their speech; to conforme them to convenient action; to trie what mettall is in everie one, and of what disposition they are . For although you aimed at all these things, and hitt them, which as I haue shewed in one branche to bee false, so must you graunt it in some other; vnlesse you will saye, that to arme a youth with a  830 whoores forehead, is honestly to embolden him ; or, by trying what mettal is in every one , you meane the occasioning of the to giue proofe whether their 831 browes bee made of brasse ; but admitting all were even as you pretend: yet your stage-playing being convicted of vnlawfulnes, your preteses for it are grinded all to powder;  832 iust is their damnation, who say, Let vs doe evill that good may come thereof . Our great and first parents,  833 seduced by the serpent, did eate of the fruit of the forbidden tree: to the intent that they might become like to God, and knowe both good and evill . The  834 knowledge of good and euill, is to be wished: but because the  835 meanes was ioyned with disobedience, it had bene better for them to haue lacked that knowledge. Among the Laced aemonians, 836 boyes by their publike order were instructed, and through want of vittalls were provoked to steale meat: that being occasioned thereby to watch at night, while others were sleeping, and to lye in wait by day time for their pray, they might be the skilfuller to circumvent & spoile their enemies in warre. The end good and commendable, as he who  837 taught David to fight , assureth vs: but  838 David was not taught it by pilfering and stealing. Parmeno in  839 Terence telleth what commoditie Ch aerea might purchase by coming into Thais house: to bee acquainted with the nature and manners of harlots, that knowing them betime he might for ever hate them . To hate the, is a qualitie 840 beseeming vertuous persons: but who so by acquaintance with them doe seeke to hate them, are likelie to be evill qualified; for  841 can a man goe vpon coales, and his feete not be burnt ? But here you will reply percase that in Ch aerea , beside the good effect which Parmeno did boast of, some bad effects might fall out,  842 through the seeing of Jupiters picture with Dana e , and being neere to Pamphila : which in your playes canot be feared. But I have prevented this reply by shewing that  843 your Danaes picture with Melanthos talke may breede some bad effectes in a Ch aerea too, though he were a beholder onely of your playes, much more if he be a player him selfe. Wherefore if a dead flye doeth cause the sweet ointment of the Apothecarie to stinke , as the  844 wise man saith: what a lothsome savour must needs so great store of such caraine breed in the perfume of eloquence, into the which you cast it? Beside that, to come neerer you, the ointment and perfume it selfe commended by you, hath a rammish smell, and stinketh like a goate: as a good Apothecarie, and of verie quicke sent,  845 Quintilian , I meane, acknowledgeth and avoucheth. For he,  846 requiring  847 chieflie that young and tender mindes 848 should not onely learne such things as are well vttered, but, & that much rather, such things as are honest ; forbiddeth them to reade at all any po emes of 849 amatorie fansies, at least, 850 till they bee growen to greater maturitie of yeares, and strength of age . In which sort hee alloweth them to reade Menanders Comedies also, and others, 851 whethey be past daunger of having their manners corrupted . And their  852 style he willeth to be exercised in commo places, either against vices , or touching doubtfull questions; in praysing good, dispraysing evill: in reporting trueth; in defense of innocencie; and the like matters that may serve an  853 honest man in vse of life. Their  854 memorie he wisheth to be cofirmed by learning without booke, sometime somewhat of their owne, well penned; but principally, places elected and chosen out of orations, or stories , or other kind of 855 writings worthy that care and studie; that they 856 may accustome themselves to the best, and have their style holpen manie wayes thereby . Finallie, for  857 framing of speech, voice, and gesture , he would not haue them imitate the voice of Women, or old men; nor expresse the fautes of drunkennes; nor be taught to play the slaves; nor learne the affection and passion of love, of couetousnes, of feare. Which things are neither necessarie , saith he,  858 for an oratour; and 859 they doe corrupt the minde, in childhoode specially, while it is tender yet and vnacquainted with things; because 860 such as those are whom we imitate much, such our selves become . Behold the great difference betweene a heathen mans conceit of the instructing of oratours for civill causes:  & yours, of Christian Preachers, or what soeuer place your Studentes shall be called to in Church or Common weale, at least of honest men and Christians. Hee would haue no amatorie po emes , neither Comedies , no not  861 Menanders , that is, the  862 best of all to be read by his youth: you, as if Ph aedras amorous speech expressed by Seneca were nothing without a peece of menstruous cloth sowed to it, doe occasion yours to make them selves familiar and well acquainted with Plautus, 863 one farre beneath the best. He would haue his youth to practise their style in good things, as in 864 weapons, which they may vse when neede shall be : you practise yours in speeches entising men to Venerie , to ribauderie, to scurrilirie, to hoordom, to incest, to other abominations. He would haue his youth to commit most excellent thinges and wordes to memorie; you pester yours with filth, such filth in Rivales (I am ashamed to reherse it) as can not be matched, I thinke, sure very hardly, throughout all Plautus . Hee would not haue his youth  865 to counterfeit a womans voice: you procure Minerva, Penelope, Euryclea, Antono e, Eurynome, Hippodamia, Melantho, Phaedra , the Nurse , the Nymph , besides I know not whom in the vnprinted Comedie , to bee played by yours. Hee would  866 not have his youth to represent the faults of drunkennes : yours must flant it out in most vnmodest guise, with vnseemely barbarous carousing songes and speeches, and be defended too by the brave example of Laced aemonian slaves. Hee would  867 not haue his youth to bee imbrued and tainted with slavish behaviour : for yours it is an ornament to play the goteheard Melanthius , or a bragging souldier, or a clownish wooer. In fine, hee would  868 not haue his youth to learne the passion of amorousnes and loue;  869 nor to bee stage-player-like in action and gesture : you breede yours in stage-playing, as conforming them to convenient action ; and teach them to resemble the panges of loue in maner of most amorous Nymphes , with  870 burning exclamations, and  871 fansies of Po eticall fables. S t 872 Austin reprooving the course of the world which traineth vp their children in Po ets wanton tales of Iupiters adulteries , and vseth to defend their custome by saying, Hence are wordes learned, hence is eloquence gotten: forsooth , saith hee, belike wee could not know these wordes, imbrem aureum , and gremium , and fucum , and templa c aeli , and the rest there written, vnlesse 873 Terence had brought in a lewde young man proposing Iupiter to him selfe for an example of hooredome, while hee beholdeth on the wall a certaine painted table, wherein was this picture; how Iupiter sent a 874 golden shower, they say, of olde time into the 875 lappe of Dana e, 876 vnder the colour thereof to beguile a woman. And see how he stirreth vp himselfe to lust as it were by the instruction of a heavenly maister. But what God? saith hee. Even that God which shaketh 877 the sanctuaries of heaven with thunder. Should not I, who am a mortall wretch, doe the same? Yes indeed I did it, and gladly. 878 No, no , saith S. Austin, those wordes are not learned the more conveniently by meanes of this dishonestie: but this dishonestie is wrought the more confidently by meanes of those wordes . Thus did that discreete and godly Father iudge of causing such devises of Po ets to bee learned by children yea although the Poets were as good as Terence and the childre as well inclined as himselfe. For him selfe it is, of whom  879 hee confesseth that  880 hee learned many profitable wordes in vaine, Po eticall fansies; but such as both may bee learned in thinges not vaine, & that is a safe way wherein children ought to walke . On which consideration sundry men of note in our memorie also, not onely among professors of purer religion, but even among the Papists, haue advised Scholemasters & instructors of youth either not to read Terence to their Scholers, or if they will read him, not to read him all. 881 Ludovicus Vives , having declared in generall out of  882 Plutarch touching the reading of Po ets , that, vnlesse you vse it most warily, it hurteth; and therefore, if a childe may be allowed to meddle with it, their writinges would be purged first, & filthy matters be wholly cut out of them : Doth wish the same concerning Terence in speciall for those thinges which might defile the mindes of children with such faultes and vices, as naturally wee are prone to. Ignatius Loiola , a man no worse minded in certaine pointes then were the olde Iewish 883 Pharises , whose  884 sect in his ofspring of Iesuits hee hath renued,  885 did forbidde Terence to bee reade in schooles (vnlesse he were purged) least hee should more anoy their maners by his wantonnes, then by his Latin helpe their wittes. 886 Georgius Fabricius , not seeing how he may be well purged to this purpose, because the conditions of fond or bad persons, as of lovers, hoores, murmurers, mizers, fretters, ruffians, varlets, flatterers, boasters, bawdes, and sycophants , that is, the most of those things which Comedies entreate of, belong to stronger mindes, and to an age confirmed and stayed with some judgement, not to vnskilfull children, before whom they are better omitted and concealed; Fabricius therefore grounding him selfe vpon the iudgement of  887 Aristotle , and  888 Quintilian , both applyed to Terence , resolveth that hee is not to bee read at all to youths of tender yeares . Wherevnto a light of our vniversitie and country, D. Humfrye , subscribeth and agreeth, in that vpon occasion of shewing how Noblemens children and Gentlemens should bee brought vp in learning,  889 he saith that they may haue Terence reade vnto them, but then, when they shall be growen in age and iudgement . Though douting least even then too the 890 poyson of his filthines may be more forcible then the couter-poyson to be vsed against it he addeth that hee would not graunt him this place neither in their education, but that Tullie had made good account of him, and profited in eloquence by him . Now the same reasons, that, in choise of autours to be read by vs, exclude so fine a Po et, and send vs vnto purer fountaines of good literature: doe likewise in the practise of style, the frame of speech, and imployment of memorie, exclude such points and matters as Terence is excluded for, and commend vnto vs more commendable arguments to exercise our wittes, our tounges, our pennes in. Which the wise Founders and Governours of the worthy Colleges and companies of Students here among vs did very well consider: taking order therefore that by rendring and rehearsing of Aristotle ; or Tullie ; by writing, pronouncing, declaiming, disputing, of questions in sundry faculties and artes, the vse whereof may serue them afterward to purpose, young men should bee made the readier and fitter to confirme the truth, to confute errours, to dehort from evill things, and instruct to good. Neither doeth your suttle matching and comparing of these scholasticall exercises with enterludes and playes, in as much as you tell mee that if I had but said that your playes are toyes, vnnecessarie, vaine it had bene no more perhaps then is, in strictnes, true, because 891 vnum mod e necessarium; and hee, that had tried all things, of his owne wise experience pronounceth, 892 vanitas, vanitatum, & omnia vanitas, yea, even learning, and wisedome, and all thinges else, except the feare of God which endureth for ever, & you haue heard a godly & a learned Preacher in the pulpitt affirme, that our declamations, oppositions, suppositions, and such scholasticall exercises, are no better then vaine things : but these three autorities, wherein you saw not strength sufficient to perswade you that your playes are certainlie vnnecessarie and vaine , (your speech cocerning them you lay in water with perhaps ;) doe not convince in deede our disputations, declamations , with the like exercises , to be so. For when our Saviour said that  893 one thing is needfull , speaking of  894 the good part which Marie had chosen in that  895 shee heard 896 his preaching, the word of God preached by him : he did not by commending the needfulnes of the ende, condemne the meanes, as needlesse, wherby the ende is attained to. Nay, hee did imply rather that the meanes are consequentlie needfull: as if a naturall man should say, We must liue , his meaning were that wee must haue sustenance to live by. And how shall men  897 heare the word of God preached, vnlesse there be Preachers to expound it? How can Preachers expound it, vnlesse they learne the way of  898 cutting it aright and applying it ? How can they learne the way ordinarilie: vnlesse they be trained vp in Logike and Rhetorike? The necessarie vse whereof for the sound interpreting of Scripture, it may be that you heard  899 me shewe against the Brownists , as well as you heard the Preacher whom you speake of: or if you did not, Saint  900 Austin , or  901 Hyperius , may serve to informe you. The artes then of Rhetorike & Logike are requisit to preaching of the woord. And the exercises of declaiming, answering, opposing, doe helpe to breede ripenes in those artes. Our Saviours sentence therefore that one thing is needfull , argueth not these exercises to be vnnecessarie. No more doth Salomons saying that all things are vanitie , proove them to be vaine . For out of  902 those all things him selfe doeth except, the 903 feare of God (as you note) and (as you should haue noted) the keeping of Gods commaundements . Wherefore sith our Students be commaunded by God  904 to employ the pieces of moony that hee hath given them, in trade and traficke as it were, to make gaine therof; and the trade, wherein they must employ their time, is, to gett them selves all instrumentes of learning, by whiche they  905 may be able to 906 exhort with whole some doctrine; and 907 convinc[illeg.] such as gainsay it : their practise of exhortatorie and convincing faculties, of declamations, of elenches, of oppositions and suppositions , can not be condemned, as vaine , by his woord, by whom  908 the evill servant is condemned as  909 vnprofitable , for  910 hyding his talent in the earth . Well may you haue heard a Preacher in the pulpitt affirme that which you mention: but I doubt whether you vnderstoode him well. For you alleage him so, as if he had pronouced those exercises simply,  & in them selves, vaine . Which it were iniurious to thinke, that a learned and a godlie Preacher (such doe you report him, and I, not knowing who it was, doe beleeve you) should purpose to affirme: seing Christ,  911 whose mouth was never defiled with toy or anie vaine thing ; vsed certaine of them, as oppositions namely. For what are  912 oppositions but arguments obiected against a point in question? What was it but an argument obiected so by Christ , when against the  913 Sadduces, denying the resurrection, 914 he vrged a text of Moses ? and against the  915 Pharises , holding no more of Christ but that he was Davids sonne , a  916 testimonie of David. Yea, in this later he did that which of all things in our disputations might seeme to be most vaine , obiect  917 against a trueth, although with purpose for the trueth. It is not to be thought then, that the Preacher, terming our exercises vaine , meant that they are such simply and in them selves; but as they are vsed by vs, by many of vs , to sundry fruitlesse endes, not to make vs fitter for the  918 good and  919 needfull edifying of men : nor to advance  920 godlines profitable for all things , but to encrease or make a shew of  921 that knowledge , which therfore is called  922 vanitie by the wise man, because it hath  923 no permanent and lasting commoditie,  924 nor bringeth vs salvation and eternall life. Whereof it doeth no more folow that the exercises are vaine, as you conclude; then if one should reason that the feare of God , (which you except) is vaine , vpon that place of Esay, 925 Their feare toward me is taught by the precept of men . For, if, notwithstanding that  926 the Iewes worshipped and feared God in vaine, fearing him amisse according to the precepts of men , not to his woord, yet the feare of God is most beneficiall, and  927 was to some among the Iewes too: then may declamations, supposititions, oppositions, and such scholasticall exercises be profitable & fruitfull , even vnto some among vs also, though many of vs make them vanitie of vanities , as vaine as that  928 strife is which Saint Paul reprooveth, I meane, both  929 voide of wholesome iuice,  & 930 ful of poyson. But to what purpose are these discourses, will you say, of exercises fitt for scholers, and Terence not to be read vnto them, till they be of riper yeares  & iudgement? To let you vnderstand, that whereas you tell vs, you come vpon the stage to practise your style, to acquaint your selues with Plautus, to embolden your youth, to trye their voices, confirme their memories, frame their speech and action ; you are so farre from iustifying your playes by this defense, that you condemne the more. For if the tale of Iupiter with Dana e , in Eunuchus , should not be read to such as your Melantho and Nais : much lesse should they be taught the same tale  931 vrged farther, in Vlysses redux ; and lesse yet another tale of  932 wanton Salmacis 933 with her boy ; in Hippolytus . If they should not as much as salute Terence , the finest Comicall Po et, for purenes of the Latin toung in  934 Tullies iudgement: much lesse should they be made well acquainted with Plautus ; and lesse yet with Rivales . If they should not be suffered to peruse writings of base  & filthy qualitie, nor to cast their eyes, as it were, vpon them: much lesse should they engraue them by heart in their remembrance, expresse them with voice, commend them with action, deliver them with boldnes. If they should not exercise their style, their speech, their memorie, but in honest, vertuous, and commendable matters, which in vse of life may serve them to good purpose: much lesse should they meditate how they may inflame a tender youth with loue; entise him to daliance, to hoordom, to incest; inure their mindes and bodyes to vncoomly, dissolute, railing, boasting, knavish, foolish, brainsicke, drunken conceits, woordes, and gestures. Wherefore to the Timothees , that are among your Students, I must say in like sort as Saint Paul to Timothee :  935 Consider what I say; and the Lord giue you vnderstanding in all things. Now, the inconveniences and mischiefes of your playes being so notorious and manifold, as I haue shewed: the rest of mine answer opposed to your reasons devised for their defense, will easilie deliver it selfe from your cavills. For where you having said that your Students did not misspend their time therein, because they spent no more time then vseth to be spent in sports, sleepe, talke, and learned releasing of the minde from studie ; and having added thereto that, sith there is a time for sportes, playes, danses, and man consisting not of one part alone doeth neede recreation, therefore you may be stage-players ; I answered to the former, that by the like reason a student haunting a dicing house, or taverne, or stewes, might proove that he did not misspend his time thereat ; to the later, that recreation is necessarie for Schollers, yet would it not beseeme them to play at stoole-ball amonge wenches, nor at Mumchance or Maw with idle lost companions; nor at trunkes in Guile-halls, nor to danse about Maypoles, nor to rifle in alehouses, nor to carowse in Tavernes, nor to steale Deere, nor to robbe Orchyards : you reply that to compare your playes to these things, it exceedeth the compasse of any tollerable resemblance ; and therevpon eftsoones you surname them hard and incomparable comparisons . Wherein howe incomparably you lavish out of measure, and exceede the compasse of any reasonable speach, you may quickly see, now that I haue prooved your playes to be evill: sith these things being likewise evill and disorderlie, and so agreeing with them in a generall point, it is cleere they may be resembled therevnto. The Scripture compareth  936 our Saviour to an  937 vsurer , who desireth gaine by the moony hee lendeth;  938 the children of light to an vniust steward , who maketh him selfe frendes with his maisters goods against a time of neede,  939 the coming of the Lordes day to a thiefe in the night , who cometh suddenly and vnlooked for. Comparisons not tollerable, if the speciall qualities of vsurers, of vniust men, of theeves , should bee meant: but very good and fitt, if wee marke the generall points that they are matched in. Or, if Scripture-eloquence, which yet S t  940 Austin magnifieth, seeme base in your eyes; though, seeme it never so base, I trust you will not say that to compare our Saviour , and so foorth, to these things, it exceedeth the compasse of any tolerable resemblance : but the eloquence, the learning, the autoritie of Homer, whose witt (  941 you say)  942 enlightned both men and Gods together, whose 943 maiestie you worshippe with  944 prayer and 945 thankesgiuing , to  946 whom you with eternall glorie , and call him  947 the eternall olde man , will suffice to open your eyes and stoppe your mouth. For he compareth  948 valiant Aiax to an asse, that being in a corne-field will not bee driven out with any cudgels of boyes till he haue filled his belly; the 949 Grecians and Troians about Sarpedons carkasse, to flies about a milke-paile in a warme spring-time , all busy and loth to leaue it. There are  950 who finde fault with these comparisons. I graunt, as overbase and abiect: but your adoration of Homer doeth perswade me, that you will make more of  951 his censure, who, for the generall drift thereof, approoveth them. At least you shall be forced to yeeld by your owne wordes, in as much as having compared our reproofe of your expense in playes to  952 their speech who saide of the costly ointment powred vpon Christes head, what needed this wast ? and being tolde the difference of that fact from yours; you say, that though you knowe there is an infinite difference betwene yours and the action against the which it was hypocritically first vsed: yet you thinke it may also bee applyed against, either the niggardise, or the hypocrisie of any Momus, that shall condemne all expense as cast away, that is sometimes moderatly bestowed vpon honest sports and pastimes . For how can it be chosen but to compare your charges on playes to those on Christ , must needes exceede the compasse of any tolerable resemblance : vnlesse things agreeing in a generall point, as you suppose (though falsly) these to doe in honestie , may be very well resembled eche to other? And 953 why should you reproove it in me as a hard incomparable deede : when you thinke it comparable and soft in your own case? Chiefly, sith you know , that even in the degree of honest matters too , whereon expenses are made, there is an infinite difference betwene the actions , which you match: I can not say so of those that I compare. Nay, some of the thinges that I compare your stage-playes with, are lesse evill; as namelie, for scholers to play at stooleball among wenches : which to doe by day light, in open streetes, in their owne likenes, were not so vnmeete and inconvenient for them, as to be attired in wemens raiment, by wemen, within doores, in the night time, to goe to and fro, and come vpon the stage, and play Melantho , or Nais . Contrariwise, the action wherewith you match yours; was infinitely better , as your selfe acknowledge: and had, as you must also acknowledge,  954 lesse bestowed thereon, then yours had. So that your consequution doeth halt here againe; It was no wast to bee at lesser cost in woorking a good woorke on Christ; Ergo it is no wast to bee at greater charges in setting foorth of playes . But mine is vnreprooveable; It beseemeth not scholers to play at stooleball among wenches, though modest and chast; Therefore it beseemeth them not to play wanton wemen on the stage . The same may I say of the two comparisons, which herewithall you checke; the former, alleaged out of Salvianus , or out of Scripture rather; the later, adioyned by mee for illustrating and opening the former: to weete, that with the players of lewde and naughty parts it fareth as with a foole committing wickednes in pastime; and they are like a mad man, who casteth firebrands, arrowes, and mortall thinges, and saith, was I not in sport? For a mad man casting firebrandes , and the like, endangereth bodies onely: the players of lewde parts doe endanger sowles. And a foole commiting wickednesse in pastime hath seldome many admirers and folowers to hurt: the players haue as many, as a great Theater holdeth, and can heare them say, But O Cupido , or, O qu am juvaret . Wherefore when you amplifie herevpon, and tell me, you could haue wisht that such comparisons had bene forborne, if not for the playes them selves, though also they ought for the playes them selves, being thinges that savour of some witt, learning, and iudgement; yet in respect of the actors, your whole house, the spectators, approovers, autours, writers ; all which points you loade with patheticall circumstances otherwhere entreated of: you force me to say I could haue wisht also that you had forborne these Galba- trickes of seeking to preiudice the trueth and equitie of causes with partiall affections and respect of persons , a  955 thing condemned by Scriptire ; and that you had considered that if playes savouring of some witt learning, and indgement, ought not to be compared to such things as I mentioned , then your selfe did ill in praysing and allowing that part of my discourse, wherein the foole and mad man served for comparisons . For you gaue testimonie therof, that I had written copiously and truly against the bad effects of stage-playes in generall . Yea, specifying the proofes that I made by sundry examples and autorities, among which the autoritie of Salvianus was, you soothed it as containing a truth, and well handled . But the stage-playes spoken of by Salvianus , did savour of some witt, learning, and iudgement : as what play doeth not? at least of all those that any ancient Po et wrote. Your reason therfore brought from the savour of witt; learning, and iudgement , to crosse my comparisons; doeth crosse your owne allowance of that which you acknowledged to be well spoken against the bad effects of stage-playes in generall . And thus, as 956 Lycurgus the Thracian imagining that hee was hewing downe a vine with his hatchet, is said to have slaine his sonne, and maimed him selfe: likewise you intending to shew that my comparisons are hard and incomparable, and exceede the compasse of any tolerable resemblance, and should haue bene forborne , haue wounded vnawares your eternall olde man , and your selfe greevously. A more greevous wound haue you giuen your selfe in saying that you presumed your playes to be lawfull , when you made your simple assertion (so you terme it) that there is a needfull time for sports . For this is in effect as much as if you saide, that you played the  957 Sophister, 958 begging the point in question, and taking it as granted . The which kinde of dealing, if it had any sinewes to graple with an adversarie, the Iesuits might trooble vs, by saying that the Catholike faith must be kept; and they presume that Poperie is the Catholike faith . Likewise the meanest advocate in a court of law might speede all his clients, by saying that such as haue wrong offered them, ought to be releeved; and hee presumeth his clients haue so . Neither had you needed to write so long a reply of twelue leaves to me: twelue wordes might haue sufficed, that you presume my cause is naught, and naughty things must not be credited . But your selfe acknowledge that this prooveth not the lawfulnes of your playes . So that, in affirming you did presume them to bee lawfull , and calling it a simple assertion which you avowed concerning sports , you speake more trueth then you intended. For it is a simple assertion in deede to say that sports are needfull , against a mans arguments who saith that stage-playes are vnlawfull . And hee may be iustly noted of presumption , who, beeing vnable to proove a thing he fansieth, condemneth them as Momes that are minded otherwise and bring found proofe against it. Howbeit, had you kept your selfe within the compasse of such oversights, you were more excusable. But it is a greater fault to play the sclanderer by falsifying mens wordes, and fathering vpon them an erroneous sentence, which never came into their mindes, nor fell out of their mouths or pennes. And what doe you else, when having saide that I vse many wordes against dansing , you reply that you loue to see honest dansing ; and, you see no cause in reason, charitie, or Christian libertie, why dansing should simply be condemned . For hereby you insinuate, or pronounce rather, that I condemned dansing simply, and honest dansing : whereas my wordes were that danses of Penelopes wooers, of Melantho, of other of her maides, and simply all stage- dansing do savour of dishonestie . Which differeth as much from that you father on me, as the speech of Christ, 959 Destroy ye this temple, & in three dayes I will raise it vp againe , meaning of his body , did differ from that which  960 the false witnesses affirmed him to haue said of the temple of God, 961 the temple made with handes . Nay, it surpasseth that of the false witnesses : it differeth as much as if, where Christ saide, that  962 all vngodly men shall perish , they had fathered on him that all men shall perish . And your crime herein is the more blamewoorthy, because I had so plainly excepted certaine dansing, that you can not seeme to haue mistaken my wordes, and reade all dansing , for all stage-dansing ; but wilfully and advisedly to haue misreported mee. For I said expressely, I meant those danses that I specified, and not 963 Davids dansing, which S t  964 Ambrose doeth well distinguish from them . Now S t Ambrose  saith that Davids religious and godly dansing is decent: but 965 the dangerous dansing practised by players, and the 966 foolish toyes, the dotages, of the stage ;  967 are faultie even in youth too . So both mine owne woords, and the aucourt I cited, doe manifestlie shew, that whe you tooke vpo you to prayse honest dansing , and said you saw no cause in charitie or reason why dansing should simply be condemned , you could not but in reason and charitie see cause, why you should have dealt more simply and honestly , then so calumniouslie to raise a false surmise of me. You know what creature it is, whom the  968 scripture nameth a  969 calumniatour. Beside, as you offend in charging me with that I said not: so in going about to overthrow that which I said. For whereas I affirmed that dansing of Penelopes wooers with her maides, and simply all stage-dansing , is disallowed by the light of nature ; and for proofe thereof did alleage the testimonies, of Romans putt by Nero , of Philistines putting Samson to it, and of all ancient lawes in a manner, yea of reason it selfe , as Arias Montanus noteth : you, avouching two mens opinions to the contrarie, doe adde, that to apply, either the dansing of those noble Romans, whom Nero enforced to danse so publikely ; or, Samsons dansing among the Philistines ; or, the note of Arias Montanus , against your dansing onely of two sober measures, is a comparison without all measure . Wherein first, through negligence of marking my words, or desire of crossing them before you vnderstood them, you misreport my drift: and say that I applyed those thinges against your dansing onely of two sober measures , (you meane, the wooers dansing with the maides,) which I applyed not against it alone, but against the rest of your stage-dansing also , that is, all your stage-playing. For this did I betoken by the name of stage-dansing , the better to expresse the sentence, that I had in hand, of Saint Ambrose , who by  970 dansing noteth all histrionicall motions and playings on the stage , in like sort as  971 Horace saith,  972 one was requested to danse Polyphemus , meaning to play his part; and  973 Plancus dansed Glaucus, in 974 Uelleius storie; and  975 stage-players dansed Oedipus, and Hercules, in 976 Macrobius ; and  977 Arnobius speaketh of  978 dansing Europa, Leda, Ganymedes . Neither was it hard for you to perceiue that I meant thus much, if you had better weighed the branches of my speech,  & proofes therto answering, concluded with the note of Arias Montanus , touching not onely dansers , but persons of such shewes & spectacles . Chiefly if you had looked on the autour him selfe, and marked that in the persons of such shewes and spectacles , he compriseth stage-players ; as the  979 generalitie of his wordes, exemplified by Nero , maketh plaine. An other iniurie is it, that you terme those proofes of mine, a comparison ; and (which is more) a comparison without all measure . What  980 measure you did vse in the meting out hereof, I can not guesse: vnlesse peradventure, because that you had heard that comparisons are odious , you hoped you should make all my proofes odious by naming them comparisons . For I, having noted, against your argument drawne from sports and recreations , that sports by the light of nature, are accounted vnseemelie, bad, infamous, and so is all stage-dansing; did alleage the iudgements of Romans , of Philistines , of ancient lawes well nigh all , and of reason it selfe, as testimonies to proove that proposition by; not as comparisons, but as testimonies. And therefore in the note of Arias Montanus , I did omitt that he saith of  981 the law of God condemning stage-playes likewise, because that might goe higher then the light of nature . Otherwise, you may be sure that I, who cited him for mens lawes , a thing of weaker proofe, would not have omitted the lawe of God , his strongest argument. But if I had ioyned supernaturall light to the light of nature , and had produced testimonies of the Scripture also: would you have replied, that, to alleage the Scripture, is a comparison without all measure ? You must by like reason. And what should stay you from it? All would have espied that it were no comparison. Why more, then the note of Arias Montanus ? which yet, when you had cast my allegation of the Romans and Philistines in such a mould, that it could not appeare I brought them in as testimonies; you named with them for company a comparison too. Though, seeing you are greeved with my applying of it against your stage-dansing , and that induced you to call it a coparison : me thinks you should have fastned that odious name rather on the proposition prooved by those testimonies. For the proofes reach not you immediatlie, they fight not nigh at hande: the proposition doeth; as being the maior of that argument, wherof your stage-players make the minor. And the proposition, condemning all stage-dansing , doth giue a deadlyer wound; nether can it choose but light on your stage-dansing: the proofes might seeme to be more easilie avoided; or, comming so farre off, to raze the skinne onely. Againe, my applying of the proposition to you, by the assumption, would deserve more woorthily the name of a comparison: and the assumption being particular, or singular; the proposition vniversall; were not this applying of all against some, a comparison without all measure ? The third iniurious part offered me in this point, is, that you alleage the iudgement of Homer and Syr Thomas Eliot , as making for that dansing, which I did reproove. And bringing in the former of them by a  982 figure , saying, To omit Homers iudgment thereof ; him self you call an excellent observer of decorum in all things , and quote for his iudgement 983 the eight booke of his Odyssea . Now, better had it bene for you to omit him without a figure in deede: sith he, describing there the life of King Alcinous , and of his people, the Ph aeacians , saieth, that  984 they tooke pleasure continually in feasting, and musicke, and daunsing, and braverie of apparell, and hott baths, and chambering : wherein a livelie paterne of a wanton, riotous, voluptuous, Epicures life, being sett foorth by Homer , as  985 Horace, 986 Athen aeus, 987 Eustathius may teach you: if I should not haue blamed dansing in your playes, because such an excellent observer of decorum saith the Phoeacians vsed it; then must the  988 belly bee your players God, because such an excellent observer of decoru saith the Phoeacians served it. Moreover seeing that the Musicke which the minstrell gave the to their dansing , was a  989 song of Mars taken in adulterie with Venus Vulcans wife ;  & you commend in dansing the number of the footing wel expressing, answering, and as it were acting the measure and meaning of the Musike : you see what good instructions you give men by extolling your excellent observer of decorum in all things . Adde therevnto that he, so good an observer of decorum , maketh the Phoeacian actors danse with  990 others of their owne sexe, or  991 single. Which how much,  & why, it is more allowable, then men and women to danse together: I wish you to consider, by weighing, with examples mentioned in  992 Scripture , the iudgement of  993 Divines thereon. So shall you perceiue, that Homer in the eight booke of his Odyssea , hath no sufficient warrant for Melantho to danse together with Eurymachus , the maides with the wooers ; no not though they were maides and Melantho in deede; much lesse for boyes attired like Melantho, & maides , to danse with men vpon a stage. The later of your autours you alleage directlie; and, that learned Knight Syr Thomas Eliot , say you, among other things that he writeth in a booke of his, in the prayse of dansing, compareth the man treading the measures, to Fortitude, and the woman on his hande, to Temperance . You adde, that you have seene the booke, and you remember hee vseth this comparison in it . But did you not remember the name of the booke too? or was it for some speciall cause that you concealed it? your woordes might giue a man occasion to thinke, that he had written a booke in the praise of dansing : which that he did, I  994 finde not. I guesse you meane therefore his booke entituled the Governour . Wherein  995 he prayseth Dansing , and vttereth somewhat like to that avouched by you, and  996 treateth of circumstances (a point you touch also) which being all observed, dansing may be honestlie and honorably vsed : But his speech of Fortitude and Temperance represented by men and maidens in a danse , commeth nothing neere your maides and wooers measures , whereto you would stretch it. For, among diverse maners and kindes of dansing vsed in ancient time , he rehearseth one, wherein (as  997 Lucian saith, translated: woord for woorde by him in a maner)  998 dansed young men and maidens; the man going before, and expressing 999 such motions as he might afterward vse in warre; the maiden following him modestly and shamefastlie; so that it represented a pleasant coniunction of temperance & fortitude . Now those warlike motions were (as  1000 Plato sheweth, speaking of the like danse) gestures which resembled, partlie the avoiding all sortes of woundes and blowes by 1001 bending aside, by 1002 going backe, by 1003 leaping vp, by 1004 bowing downe; partlie the enforcing of enimies by shooting 1005 arrowes, and casting 1006 dartes at them, and giving them 1007 all sortes of wounds . Wherefore this being it, that represented Fortitude in the danse described by Syr Thomas Eliot : farre was it fro his meaning to make your measures, your sober measures, warlike motions; or compare a wooer treading them , to Fortitude . As farre, as to compare a boy doeing the same in maidens likenes, to Temperance . Which, if you had otherwise expressed his sense rightlie, yet should you haue forborne to apply to yours for the observing of decorum , a thing that you commend so in Homer , and your selfe aime at: sith those maides and wooers , intended both by Homer and you, to be wantons, must vse lascivious danses; and the man (if you will needes haue such resemblances) bee compared rather to Mollitude , or Cowardnes , the woman to Incontinencie . Beside that, the praise which that learned Knight geveth vnto dansing , he giveth it not simply; (for he saith  1008 some danses, doe corrupt the mindes of them that danse, and provoke sinne :) but with limitation, to weete,  1009 being vsed and continued in such forme, and with such observations and rules , as hee specifieth. Whereof the first (to name one for example) is, that, by the curtesie or reverent inclination made at beginning of dansing, the dansers and beholders should marke and remember this to be signified, that at the beginning of all our actes, we should doe due honour to God, which is the roote of prudence . And in deede if dansers in treading of their measures had such regards and meditations: then not Syr Thomas Eliot onely, but the Fathers would praise dansing too . For, when godly Bishops assembled in the Councells of  1010 Laodicea , and  1011 Ilarda , decreed that Christians ought not to danse at mariages ; when S t 1012 Chrysostome blamed women for so doeing, as being a staine vnto their sexe ; when S  t 1013 Ambrose cited and averred that of  1014 Tullie , that such as danse are drunke, or madde ; when S  t 1015 Austin said that it were better to spend the Sabbat day in digging & delving, then in dansing : they meant not to restraine men from marking, and remembring, that at the beginning of all their actes, they should doe due honour to God ; but they thought that dansers haue commonlie their mindes on thinges of an other qualitie. Which if your wooers and maidens also had; as (I am perswaded) them selves will not deny, and you seeme to have thought by touching so nicely, or rather scarcelie touching, the circumstaces that you say should be observed in dansing : you abuse the name of that learned Knight , in vrging his prayse of a good danse that might bee, against my disprayse of an ill danse that is. It had bene more reason, that when his conceit caried him a litle out of the way sometimes, as in that  1016 he prayseth Lucians stage-danser, who dansed the adulterie of Mars and Venus with resembling of 1017 every act therein , (which I hope, your selfe would not allow on your stage;) you should haue acknowledged that through too great a love of dansing, he liked too well of Lucians treatise: though otherwise he fansied not the autour much; as  1018 he well declareth by noting of  1019 his ribaudrie , and his too much scorning ; and by saying farther, It were better that a childe should never read any part of Lucian, then all Lucian . Or, if the sentence of a Knight, so woorthy, had such credit with you; why did you not consider  1020 his religious wish, that the names of idoles, of Paynim Gods and Goddesses, were not vsed at this day in balades and dities, to the corupting of many good wittes with godlesse fantasies ? For though his reproofe doe specially touch the most vile idoles, Venus, and Bacchus, remembred so in dansing-songs as if the danse were to their honour and memorie; a matter most abhorring from Christes religion, and savouring of the ancient errour of Paganisme : yet as the  1021 Scripture, the ground of his reproofe, doeth generallie condemne such naming of other Gods , semblably he sheweth, that, if you had attributed so much to his iudgement, you should haue eschewed that fault in your tragedie. At least, wher the woords are vttered as it were in your owne person: as  1022 those of  1023 the Gods enlightned or beautified by Homers fables are. Perhaps, where players of other mens persons also speake: as  1024 Ulysses , and  1025 Eum aeus , adoring spirits of  1026 Devills, or of dead  1027 men, and  1028 women, with sacrifices and prayers;  1029 Telemachus 1030 swearing by Iuppiter ;  1031 Phil aetius , first  1032 blaspheming GOD vnder Iuppiters name, then  1033 confessing to him that there are Gods in heaven . Chieflie seeing that these speeches are delivered by the flower of those persons, by whose partes (you say) no hurt could come to any man : and Syr Thomas Eliot thought that such speeches, savouring of Paganisme , might corrupt good wittes . But howsoever you shall distinguish your Po eme from the balades and dities , in which he controlleth this irreligious custome of giving the honour of God to vile idoles : your selfe doe beare witnesse that he commedeth not the dansing of Eurymachus & the rest of your wooers with their Melanthos on the stage. For among the partes of their dissolute behaviour imagined to be doon within , you rehearse their  1034 dansing : and that in the person, not of a carping Momus , but of wise 1035 Telemachus . Now looke what was imagined to bee doon within , the same was expressed on the stage in part, by your owne confession: as Telemachus also saith, that in  1036 their maners at home they kept their wont , Their dansing on the stage then, your self acknowledge, was vnhonest dansing. And the dansing praysed by Syr Thomas Eliot is honest dansing, you say . Therefore you doe manifest wrong vnto vs both, in alleaging him as praysing that which I dispraysed. 1037 When the Laccd aemonians had accused the Thebans of manie and greevous matters: In deed , quoth Epaminondas, 1038 these have made you give over your short forme of speaking . I wishe I might be short, as were the Laced aemonians ; but you constraine me to be long: you deale so Theban -like continually with me. A doubtfull woord being vsed in a question of yours,  1039 whether we account it a losse recitare, to recite Seneca ; Wherevnto I answered that it is one thing 1040 to recite, another thing 1041 to play , as I declared by sundrie writers; and added that I would have bene content to heare your tragedie recited; had it bene recited or pronounced onely ; you reply that the woord is vsed in Quintilian; not onely de scripto, but also memoriter recitare; and therefore you might vse it indifferentlie, for agere, in a generall acceptatio ; moreover, that as Horace and Persius doe scoffe bitterly at recitatores also, and the law in the generalitie of the terme noteth also with imfamie, them , qui pronuntiandi, that is properly , recitandi causa in scenam prodeunt: so! the Universitie would have thought it a more absurd thing to have heard you, or any other, openly reading your Vlysses to them, then to have seene it acted as it was . Wherein to the intent you may see how you play the Theban , I will vse a comparison, and that within some measure I trust.  1042 Plutarch hath written a dialogue to proove that brut[illeg.] beastes haue reason as well as men haue : in iest peradveture, seeing he maketh it to be avouched by  1043 Gryllus : or meaning, that they haue a naturall sagacitie and vnderstanding like to reason, not reason capable of Religion, as in the  1044 conclusion he seemeth to insinuate, and a  1045 certaine Christian writer hath mainteined, though speaking not so fitlie in saying they have reason , sith the  1046 Scripture termeth them  1047 Creatures voide of reason . But suppose that some man being of Gryllus minde, (or let vs call him Gryllus for more perspicuitie, and make Sempronius likewise his adversaries name;) suppose then that Gryllus having asked this question,  1048 Doe you thinke that animal, a living creature indued with sense, wanteth reason? Sempronius answered him, that animal is one thing, and a beast an other, as  1049 Tullie declareth, affirming a  1050 man (whom he calleth animal) to be full of reason , whereof he saith, that 1051 no beast at all is partaker . If Gryllus should reply that the woord is vsed in 1052 Ovid for 1053 all things that have life and sense, not for men onely, and therfore he might use it indifferently for beasts in a general acceptatio : would not they, who see, that belike he meant to comprehend men also vnder that generall woord, thereby the more closely to fetch in beastes with them; and that, restraining it to beasts, his question must bee, Thinke you that beastes want reason ? which were an idle question, and openly implying a begging of the point in controversie; would they not, I say, condemne him as a wrangling and contentious Sophister ? Now, if in the same vaine, or rather in a woorse, he should adde moreover, that as  1054 Horace and  1055 Persius speake scoffingly of mad men too, and the 1056 law appointeth gardians for idiots, that is properly, for men wanting the vse of reason; so the grave Athenian bench of Areopagus would iudge it more absurd to say that men haue reason, then that beasts haue it, chieflie certaine beastes, as 1057 horses and oxen dansing vpon stages in a more exquisit maner then men are lightlie able : would not this speech of Gryllus shew that he deserveth a sharper commendation, then Plutarch by praysing  1058 his sophistrie meant vnto him? Here your vsuall dealing causeth mee to feare that you will aske Whether I make you a Gryllus . As  1059 when a Catholike Bishop, being rebuked by an Arian Emperour for standing alone with Athanasius against the whole worlde , said that the doctrine of faith was not impeached though he alone mainteined it, seeing that of olde time 1060 three alone were found who stoode against the Kings commandement : What? quoth an Eunuche, 1061 doest thou make our Emperour a Nabuchodonosor ? But, I pray you, leave this Eunuches odious practise in racking my coparisons: and marke the maine point whereat I aime in them, and which I seeke to open by them. For, as in Gryllus question, and verse , framed like yours, the circumstances giue, that he vsed the generall woord comprising man, thereby to breed a fansie that if this kinde of animal haue reason, why not the other ? In like sorte your expresse mention of  1062 reading , I say, of reading , not of playing , in shewing what a iewell you take the reciting of Seneca to be; maketh it probable that you meant to doe by the generalitie of the woord recitare . The more, because you vsed it not onely in your verse , where your excuse might serve, that it stoode better then agere would in that place ; as Gryllus might say likewise for versifying animal rather, then bestiam : but in your prose also, the 1063 title of your tragedie ; as if Gryllus , setting downe the point controversed betweene him and Sempronius , should make it, vtrum animal sit rationis expers ; where the woorde  1064 bestia , would serve as fitlie in prose; nay, (if plaine dealing were meant) a great deale more fitlie. And if you intended not to make that reason which I supposed you did, it is no losse to recite Seneca, Ergo no losse to play him : but meant to vse the generall woorde for the speciall, and to aske Momus onely, Thinke you it a losse to play Seneca ? the you begged at Momus hand, or tooke as graunted, the point you should haue prooved; sith the playing of Seneca was condemned by him, and you vndertooke to confute his arguments. Againe, as Horace, Persius, the law, alleaged by Gryllus , doe shew that certaine men want the vse of reason , but neither proove that beasts haue it, nor that mankind wanteth it; and his presumed testimonie of the Areopagus , brought in with a particle of similitude, So , as hitting iumpe with Horace, Persius , and the law , is too too absurd: in like sort the same autours, alleaged by your selfe, doe shew that some reciters are misliked by them, but neither prove that players are liked, nor all reciters misliked; and the Vniversities testimonie which you bring in with the same particle, as hitting iumpe with those autours, I can not say you bring it altogether as Gryllus , but you bring it strangely. For  1065 Horace scoffeth at them, who  1066 recite their writings out of due place or time, and are 1067 importunatlie displeasant :  1068 Persius, at 1069 wantons reciting 1070 wanton verses, with an 1071 effeminate voice, and a 1072 vainglorious minde. The law noteth with infamie such as come vpon the stage to recite : belike, for their vaine-glorious desire of  1073 being seene, and  1074 getting mens applause , which Persius iesteth at. Now in that you adde hereto the Universitie, , and make vs ioyne with the former in opinion, saying; So the Vniversitie would have thought it a more absurd thing, to have heard me , or any other, openly reading my Ulysses to them, then to have seene it acted, as it was : what meane you by this terme, So ? That if you , or an other, had read your Vlysses openly vnto them, it had bene done out of due place, or due time ? or, they should haue heard wanton verses read ? or wantonly ? or by a wanton ? or with a vaine-glorious minde ? or on the stage ? In deede, they should haue heard  1075 some wanton verses , I graunt: and both out of due place , and time , if you had read it  1076 where ,  & 1077 when it was acted . Neither doe I doubt but the Universitie would haue thought such open reading , of such stuffe, on such a day, absurd : though, whether more absurd, then to haue seene it acted as it was , I know not. But whatsoever they would haue thought in this comparison, wherein the 1078 law , that you cite, noting both with infamie , should giue (mee thinkes) a deeper print thereof to acting then reading , all things weighed: you are farre from hitting the marke, whereat you shoote; namely, from covincing by the Universities testimonie, and iudgement, my sentence as absurd, that if your tragedie had bene recited onely, I would have accounted it no more losse of time to haue heard you pronounce it, then my selfe to reade it . For, I did not meane, if it had bene recited as those were, which the autours by you alleaged, doe reproove: but as  1079 Horace vsed to  1080 recite his owne writings ; as  1081 po emes were recited to Quintilius Uarus ; as  1082 Persius did recite his booke vnto Cornutus , before he published it. Whereof if you pronounce (as you doe, if you speake to purpose) that our Universitie would haue thought it a more absurd thing, then to have seene it acted as it was : you deale in like maner with our Vniversitie, as Gryllus with the reverend bench of Areopagus , if he should abuse their name and estimation, to perswade that brute beastes have more reason, then the wisest men have. Hereto would be annexed that, which in the fourth and last head of reasons, you vrge againe concerning our Universities iudgement for the approbation of your playes in generall: if your interlaced defense of wastfull cost in setting foorth therof (the onely point remaining besides) were discussed. And this is easilie done, considering what hath bene alreadie prooved against you touching the inconveniences and mischifes of your playes . For having made Momus obiect the great charges ; which how great they were, you know better then I, who summed them perhaps too much beneath the due whe I did mention thirtie pound ; but having made him say that it should have bene bestowed on the poore rather , you take him vp with three answeres: one, that the mony was your own, not his ; an other, that the charge, though great to him, was meane to you ; the thirde, that none would give the lesse to the poore for that, none would have given the more without it . All the which I shewed to be of no force for warrating of expeses on things of that qualitie, because, both vnhonest spending of a mans owne, is wastfulnes & riott, condemned by our Saviour in the prodigall sonne : and, as Nero giving much to gett a Plaudite, was the lesse able to help the poore by so much, and the lesse willing too perhaps ; in like sort may you be. Herevpon you demand of me, What similitude is there , or can there be, betweene the prodigall sonne, that in such a sort, as he did, spent all, and brought him selfe to the extreemest miserie; and betweene your expense ? A question, which you would not have pressed, as you doe; for your vnlikenes to him in that he wasted all, and brought him selfe to extreeme miserie thereby : if you had considered that  1083 woord in the originall text of the Gospell, whereto my quotation for  1084 riott did direct you. For vsually it noteth the qualitie of expenses made by loose  & wanton persons on their pleasures, as in forein writers,  1085 Aristotle and  1086 Tullie ; so in  1087 Scripture likewise: and, to that effect in the same parable of the prodigall sonne is it said  1088 afterward, that he devoured his goods 1089 with harlotts . Now, in Rome , of olde time, there were common 1090 harlots to be hired for 1091 two pence halfe-peny . The price in our dayes, by reason of the  1092 tribute, which they are to pay the Pope , may bee enhaunsed. But if one, desirous of an harlots company, could have her so cheape, and should pleade for him self that the moony he spendeth on her is his owne, & the charge not great, neither would he geve the lesse vnto the poore for that, nor more without it : were this a lawfull barre to stay vs from accusing him of  1093 riott , I meane, of wastfull and vnhonest spending; (give it a fitter English name, if you know any; I tooke that which our best interpreters agree on;) but might we not accuse him thereof vpon the same ground that Scripture doeth the prodigall sonne ? Or, if some Preacher, more severe then 1094 Cato , should deale so strictly and rigorously with him; might he aske what similitude there is, or can be, betweene his expense of two pence half-peny, and the prodigall sonne, who in such a sort, as he did, spent all, and brought himselfe to the extremest miserie ? Much fault have you found with my hard incomparable comparisons and similitudes ;  & some of them are  1095 hard in deede, though none incoparable : but I must say thereof, as the Apostle of his boasting, 1096 you haue compelled me . For when I tooke a softer and more gentle course, as here, to encounter that aunswere made to Momus, Thou saist the charge is great; but thou mayst come, and looke on, Momus, and pay nothing, no man doeth aske thee a peny, I resembled it to an aunswere which the prodigall sonne might thus haue made to his reproover, Thou blamest me for wasting, but I wast none of thine; thou mayst drinke with me scotfree, if thou be a good felow, & welcome : albeit the very woord, wasting, might haue shewed I meant vnhonest spending, (for 1097 thinges spent honestly are not wasted,) chiefly sith I vsed it in respect of the riot noted by our Saviour; and in the vnthrifts speech, drawing good felowes to drinke with him , I pointed to his lusty, excessive, dissolute 1098 drinkings with lewde companions like himselfe; yet you did reply, that, if hee had bene as moderate and thrifty in spending at his boord, as you were at your playes, he might well enough have said to any niggard, that should haue vnwisely found fault with him, as much as I make him say, not with the note of a prodigall, but with the commendation of an ingenuous and liberall disposition . Whereby you make mee see, to what reprochefull contumelies of a niggardly minde , and want of wisedome and discretion, I should haue laid my selfe open, if I had still endevoured to disclose vnto you the weaknes of your aunswers by gentle similitudes. That similitude therefore of mine, the tender smoothnes whereof occasioned you to mistake my meaning, and intertaine it so coursly, I have now corrected with substituting a rougher, which may deliver you from errour, and me from such tantes. For seeing you perceve this to be my meaning, that the threefold answer made by you to Momus is like as if  1099 Gallonius , or some other Epicure , reprooved by a Stoike for going to the stewes, should answer him; Thou blamest me for spending two pence half- peny on a wench, but I spend none of thine; thou maist goe with me thither, if thou be a good felow, & I will giue her as much for thee too; the charge, though it seeme great to thee, is small to me; neither will I bestow a dodkin lesse upon the poore for that, nor more without it : you will not reply, that if Gallonius had bene as moderate and thrifty in his spending at his bedde, as you were at your playes , (they cost a number of you more, you wote, in severall, then twise two pence halfe-peny;) hee might well enough have said to any niggard, that should have vnwisely found fault with him, as much as I make him say, not with the note of a prodigall, but with the commendation of an ingenuous and liberall disposition . And so, by the other similitude likewise mended, and as it were rough hewen, you may the better learne to discerne my drift, and spare your owne replying. For when, to discover the povertie of your aunswere touching the poore, I said, that Nero peradventure was either lesse able, or lesse willing to helpe the poore, by reason of fiue or sixe thousand pownd given for a Plaudite; which charge notwithstanding he might better beare, then some of your students may five or six shillings : you replyed, that, if Nero could haue as well spared such huge summes of moony, which hee spent that way often, as your House, with the company in it, and belonging to it, can once in many yeares thirty powndes: Nero should haue bene wronged greatly, being an Emperour, to haue bene noted of wastfulnes ; and, if ever hee had any such good minde, hee mought neverthelesse haue releeved the poore . Nowe, altering and changing Neros charge on Plaudite into  1100 his charge on Acte (a harlot whom hee loved better then his wife,) and telling you that he was lesse able, or lesse willing (nay, both) to helpe the poore, by reason of 1101 gifts bestowed on her : I shall not heare, I trust, that, if Nero could haue as well spared the sundry summes of moony which he spent that way often, as your House, with the company in it, and belonging to it, can once in many yeares thirty powndes: Nero should haue bene wronged greatly. beeing an Emperour, to haue bene noted of wastfulnes . No, not, though in adding that clause, being an Emperour , you seeme to allude to  1102 Aristotles saying, that  1103 Princes are not termed wastfull, or prodigall . For therin he respecteth 1104 the abundance of their wealth, which Nero could hardly exceede in gifts and expenses : not the  1105 qualitie of the matters that they spend their wealth on, wherin as prodigall persons may and doe wast , so Nero . Neither will you affirme that Nero mought neverthelesse haue releeved the poore ; for feare least you cause your reader to suspect you of shamelesnesse, or sophistrie. Shamelesnesse, if you say, that, whatsoever it were which Nero gaue to Acte , he had no whit the lesse in his coffers to giue others. Sophistrie, if by the woorde neverthelesse , you meane, notwithstanding . For Phoedria in the  1106 Comedie , mought haue helped Parmeno , notwithstanding the moony that he spent on Thais . Yet  1107 the greater charge he was at with his harlot, the lesse had he remaining to giue his poore seruant. And your dout, if Nero had ever any such good minde , will bee as badly opposed vnto my speech of his lesse willinglesse . For both him selfe,  1108 having so good a minde once, became  1109 worse minded afterward, when he was growen  1110 wastfull such wayes, yea, simply wastfull, prooving that to bee possible which Aristotle iudgeth  1111 not easy to bee done: and if he had alwayes bene equally ill-minded, yet commeth it otherwise to passe in mans nature, as you might haue learned by C aesar and Plutarch . Of whom the one, beholding certaine rich strangers and foreiners, at Rome , carying whelpes of dogges and apes in their bosomes, and making much of them, did aske, Whether wemen brought not foorth children in their countries :  1112 the other saith that C aesar herein gaue a woorthy and princely admonition to them 1113 who doe consume & wast, vpon beasts, the naturall affection and loue due to men . Both, evidently shewing, that the more wee spend on thinges of lesse value, the lesse we are disposed to spend on thinges more pretious; sith, 1114 as a mans loue is, so is his willingnes to spend for loue sake: and the loue of apes and dogges may better stande with the loue of Children, 1115 eche of them beeing to bee loved, though not alike; then expenses on playes may with releeving of the poore,  1116 the Lorde accounting mercy had vpo the poore , as had vpo him selfe,  & mony spet on playes, being as mony spent on harlots. Wherfore, if you wil be sutable to your self, & as you deale for playes, so for the loue of apes & dogges, for which you may more reasonably; your threefold answer against Momus in your own defense, is quicklie turned against C aesar & Plutarch , for those strangers: The loue, which they did beare to the whelpes of dogges and apes, was their owne loue, it was not C aesars, or Plutarchs; great might it be to Caesar and Plutarch, meane to them; neither would they loue children the lesse for that, nor more without it . And as you assaulted Momus with the Scripture, telling him that Iudas his speech, who said, what needed this wast? is an evill speech ; and nowe, notwithstanding the difference betwene your playes and Christ ; vs and Iudas , doe thinke that it may also be applyed against either the niggardise, or the hypocrisie of any Momus, that shall condemne all expense, as cast away, that is sometime moderatly bestowed vpon honest sportes and pastimes, and not vpon the poore : so, what letteth you to thinke that it may also bee applyed against either the clownishnes, or the hypocrisie of C aesar and Plutarch, who condemned all loue, as cast away, that is sometime, moderatly bestowed vpon sweete whelpes of dogges and apes, and not vpon children ? For, if you should answer, the case is vnlike because you can not proove that mens colling and dandeling of such whelpes is seemely, which C aesar and Plutarch sawe good cause to reproove: you must bee remembred that yet you may say, the thing is seemely, though say it onely, and deny their reproofe to bee iust, though not refute it; as you avouch against mee that your playes were honest and lawfull recreation, whatsoever is rather obiected then prooved to the contrary . Nay, if C aesar , or Plutarch , had, beside their reasons to proove it vnseemely, alleaged sundry testimonies of Romans and Grecians so esteeming it, as I did the iudgements of a Lacedemonian , of Horace , of Tullie of other learned men , to shew that they deemed such cost, as you were at, to bee vaine and wastfull: yet, as you reply to me that all Paynim and heathen iudgement you haue answered in the defense of your first reason ; so might you to them, that all the testimonies which they bring, you haue aunswered in the  1117 prologue of your last play. I haue read  1118 that whe the Spaniards invincible navie mett with ours, about some five yeares since, vpon the narow seas, it was published in print, at Parise , by Mendoza the Spaniards procurement, that they gott a brave victorie, wherein my Lorde Admirall of England, with sixteene of the Queenes great shippes, were sunke to the bottome of the sea, and the rest put to flight with the Vice-admirall Francis Drake . But, God bee thanked, wee saw my Lord Admirall of England alive at her Maiesties late being here with vs: and now may the Mendozians picke out of their owne  1119 Mercurius Gallobelgicus , that neither any one shippe of the Queenes navie , were it great, or small, was sunke by the Spaniards , nor the Vice- admirall put to flight. And thus at length approching vnto the conclusion, I come to your maintenance of that which you obiected concerning the iudgement of our Vniversitie . Wherewith (least I passe any thing of weight in your reply, as you doe many in mine) I will ioyne that elswhere you touch about the woorshipfull, & sometimes honorable presence at your playes; and those reverend, famous, and excellent men, for life, and learning, and their places in the Church of God, who haue bene not onely writers of such things them selves, but also actors, and doe thinke well of them (as you affirme) to this day . Our Vniversities iudgement therefore you avow that you produced rightfully to the approoving of your playes, because the greater part of the Universitie did with their harty applause approove them . An argument, that neither layeth sound foundation, nor buildeth therevpon to purpose. For how proove you, first, that the greater part did with their harty appause approove them ; seeing you acknowledge that many, some absent, some present, disallowed them ? Forsooth, you say, you are sure of it . But your bolde avouching thinges, you are not sure of, doeth make mee dout of your assurance. For, vpon my speech that certaine who came thither were pressed therevnto by great importunitie , you wish they had more truly, and more charitably, for dansing, kissing, and other demeanour, reported to me of your playes, with such a minde as you will forbeare (you say) to speake of . Wherein you doe charge them, how charitably , iudge your selfe; but questionlesse, most vntruly , with making false reports of your playes to me, to whom they made no report at all thereof. Yea, you take vpon you to pronounce of their thoughts: and say they did it with such a minde , as in your  1120 figurative forbearing to speake of , you speake most bitterly of, and raise a very wrongfull and vile suspicion of them. Againe, where I tolde you how the grave and learned man, our common friend, shewed me his dislike of the representation of amorousnes, and drunkennes; in the Comedie, both; the former, not in it onely : you say, that you know how farre hee did somewhat dislike some Comicall action; but you are sure he commended much the playes to you, & would be sorry that any speech of his should bee, by mistaking, alleaged against you . And doe you not in assuring vs after this sort that hee did like of your playes , saving a litle in the Comedie , imply that hee disliked nought in any tragedie? Or breede you not a sclanderous surmise of his integritie, as if hee had commended to you the very same, which vnto me he discommended? Or seeke you not to make men thinke that I mistooke him, in fathering that vpon him; when him selfe hath sithence acknowledged vnto mee, that I mistooke him not; and (as I am perswaded) hath certified you no lesse too? Wherefore your pronouncing, that you are sure the greater part did with their hartie applause approoue your playes , may rather proove you to bee rash, then your assertion to be true. Chieflie, sith you mention, not onely their applause , a thing that sense might iudge of; but their harty applause , a circumstance presumed by your conceit peradventure. For as they did  1121 clappe their handes after your playes, so  1122 after the appendix thereof touching Momus . Which yet some approovers of your playes approoved not: as them selves haue signified. How can you then be sure, that all, who did clappe their handes , did it with liking; and that the applause , which they gave, was hartie ? Beside that, if their hearts ioyned with their handes, how can you be sure they approoved your playes by such applause , and not somewhat else? As  1123 Tullie declareth that the Romans vsed it to shew their loue of gratious persons: and in  1124 one of your playes  1125 you wished it to be geuen to her gratious Maiestie. Nether is it impossible, but that, as a  1126 number gaue it to the  1127 apparell and furniture of the stage at Rome: so lighter bodyes might with you. And what if the grauer sort did shew the liking of your paines and charges employed for their delite sake? or of the better parts; not of wantons, of drunckards,  & of the whole playes? Now, suppose the greater part of the Vniversitie approoued them with their harty applause : might you therefore lawfully vrge the Universities iudgment as making for them? Yea, say you, if the greater part may denominate the whole , Nay, by your leaue, euen so too will you come short still, vnlesse you adde, that iudgement and harty applause is all one: which  1128 he, who affirmed that  1129 the people of Rome was lead with affection sometimes, not with iudgement , did put a difference betweene. And though the greater part denominate the whole , comonly,  & alwayes may, if the woord, greater , be well expounded: yet there fall out cases when the lesser part in number shall denominate it, and the greater shall not. For example sake,  1130 there were in the primitiue Church certaine Christians (as in ours there are) who, having lost sowewhat, would goe to a wisard, or a setter of figures, or other such soothsayer, to knowe how it went from them, or by what meanes they might recover it.  1131 One of the generall Councells spake against this: and called it  1132 a pernicious and an heathenish custome . The number of Bishops assembled in that Councell was lesser of all likelyhoode (amounting  1133 not to twelve score) then the number of Christians , who either vsed that practise them selves, or liked it in others. Yet, in my opinion, the Churches iudgement did controll it: and to say the contrary, because the greater part denominateth the whole , were most iniurious to the Church. Or, if this example satisfie you not,  1134 the same Councell made a decree, that  1135 no man should put on womans raiment . Whereto, being pressed by me, whe you reply that the voice of the Church therein may be interpreted by them who are of your minde ; you acknowlege, that, taking it in the right sense, it is the Churches iudgement . And the sense thereof by  1136 your interpretation of putting on, or wearing , must be that none may doe it commonly . So, the Councell speaking of doeing it in playes , you graunt that the Churches iudgement is against it as common players vse to practise it. But greater assemblies of Christians then that Councell, allow it in common players: the Curtaine and Theater can tell so much. Neither will you say, that common players are approoved by the Churches iudgement. For, the Churches iudgement you professe obedience too: yet  1137 comon players you condemne. The lesser part therefore in number may sometime denominate the whole ; and the greater may not . Which if wee apply to the case in question, it is playne you should not have vrged the Universities iudgement for your playes, although the greater part thereof had approoved them. For, the chiefest cause that moved the governours of our Vniversitie , the Vicechancellour and Convocation , to forbidde by statute the vse of common playes among vs, was,  1138 least the younger sort should be spectators of so many lewde and evil sports as in them are practised . Now, reason doeth give, that men of vnderstanding, who, through a godly care of the good training vp of youth, restrayned them from seeing those playes, because of such sportes ; must thinke it inconvenient for them to see such sportes in what soever playes, even in your Rivales . And, if inconvenient to see such sportes onely, much more to play and represent such: the representing of them beeing so farre woorse, then the beholding, in  1139 Platos iudgement, that 1140 they would be seene and knowne , hee sayeth, because their contraries, honest things and serious, can not be knowen without them, if one intend to bee wise; but 1141 practise both them, and their contraries, it is impossible, if one intende to have as much as a sparke of vertue . Our gouvernours might thinke more hopefully, then Plato , that vertuous youths may doe them both: and Plato peradventure meant by impossible, very hard , as  1142 Tullie 1143 elswhere doeth interpret him. But the duetifull reverence, which I owe vnto them, will not permitt me to iudge of them, that where Plato suffered his citizens to see sportes of folly and scurrilitie, yet none 1144 beside bondslaves & mercenarie strangers to imitate and expresse them : the guides of our Universitie should deeme it convenient for youths to be actors of loose and wanton prankes, whereof to be spectatours . they have pronounced it vnmeete and hurtfull for them. Wherefore, what soeuer the greater part approoved with their harty applause , I am perswaded still that you did wrong in vrging the Universities iudgement as making for your playes. No lesse in a manner, then if one beholding a great number of Scholers playing in winter time at footeball, should saye, the Universities iudgement doeth approove it . Which I contrariewise should be so farre from thinking, that if any graver man were looking on them, or touched the ball with his foote, I would take it rather to savour of affection borne to some playing thereat, then of iudgement. As for the worshipfull, and sometimes honorable presence at your playes , you might seeme to presse it against me with more credit, if honorable and worshipfull persons never vsed to grace any playes, saue onely yours, with their presence . But if they be present at common playes also, such as our Vniversitie-statute banisheth hence, and your selfe make offer that  1145 you will ioyne with me in writing against the players thereof, if I will : consider with your selfe what you would aunswere to this argument alleaged by those players, and let the same serve on my behalfe to yours. For a supply whereof I adde, that worthy personages, who, vpon intreatty, become your spectators, perhaps thinke with Plato , that the seeing of Comedies played can doe no harme, of tragedies may be dangerous; perhaps incline to Aristotle , that they both may safely bee seene by elder folke, not by younger: and so, though them selves beholde one, or both, yet doe they warrant neither of the pointes you strive for; I meane, that either students of Christ-church may bee actors , or the youth of Oxford spectators of your playes.  1146 There were at Vienna , in the time of Traian the Emperour , by some bodyes last will and testament, certaine solemne games and shewes sett foorth yearely:  1147 the which , as Plinie saith, had stained the maners of the inhabitants of that citie, in like sort as the games & shewes sett foorth at Rome had stained the maners of all the world . This corruption of maners was not bredde by other exercises and masteries tried, in those games, but by the stage-playes , as a  1148 learned man of your profession iudgeth: and  1149 Plinies owne speech, concerning sundry kindes of games among the Romans , maketh it most probable, that he meant, the corruption grew from stage- playes chiefly, if not from them alone. But when the Viennians playes were taken away by Trebonius Rufinus , a governour of theirs, and he was accused to the Emperour for it: Iunius Mauricus , a graue and faithfull Counseller, being asked by the Emperour , what he thought thereof, said,  1150 it was not meete the playes should be restored againe to the Viennians ; adding,  1151 I would to God they might be taken away at Rome too . Which corollarie of his sentence touching playes at Rome , it may bee, that as  1152 Plinie liked very well of, so the Emperour did: albeit he gave order for the not restoring of the Viennians onely; and yet shewed great mislike of playes therein also, forbidding that to bee done which by ones  1153 testament was required. Deceve not your selfe, Maister D. Gager , with a vaine conceit, as if, because a Prince , farre and farre more excellent then Traian , though surnamed  1154 most vertuous , with Her counsellers and Nobles more honorable then Mauricus , did vouchsafe the last yeare to see that Comedie played, which being played a few moonths before I reprooved, therefore you had gained against me the matter in question betwene vs. Her Maiestie with their Honors, & Commons of the realme , having made an Act of Parlament 1155 long since, and  1156 sith that time renewed it, that common players in enterludes, not licensed by speciall autoritie to goe abrode, shall bee adiudged rogues and vagabonds , hath taken away more playes, and in more places, then Traian did by giving order that they should not bee vsed againe at Vienn ae . Whether the taking of them away at Oxford too , haue bene wished by any of the Counsellers , who might bee notwithstanding present with her Highnes , as Plinie & Mauricus of likelyhoode were with Trajan at the playes in Rome : you and I are not so neere of their counsell, that we can define. But thus much I may say, and say it vpon knowledge, that, if your Comedie had still as homely speeches (to say no worse) as it had when your  1157 prologue praysed it, there is greater cause why you should feare the checke which  1158 Augustus gaue one (were not our Augusta the more gratious to vs) for presuming to play it before a presence of such honour: then why you should mention to the credit of your playes, and to my discredit, that they are thinges done by you, in a worshipfull, and sometimes honorable presence. But reverend, famous, excellent men, for life, and learning (you say) and for their places in the Church of God, have bene not onely writers of such thinges them selves, but also actors; and to this day doe thinke well of them: to whom it were a great reproche (thus you amplifie it) at any time to have bene acquainted with things of so vile & base qualitie; & much more, still to allow of the. 1159 When the Donatists praysed S  t 1160 Cyprians life, and learning , and spake of  1161 his place in the church of God , to countenance their errour by the reputation of such a Bishop and Martyr: S. Austin , answering the, said that  1162 the autoritie of Cyprian did not dismay him, because the humilitie of Cyprian did relieve him . Which as Austin saide, considering how  1163 Cyprian had sett down in writing, that Peter, whom the Lord chose his 1164 first Apostle, and 1165 vpon whom he built his Church, did not, when 1166 Paul afterward grew to question with him touching circumcision, take proudly on him selfe, to say that hee had the prerogative of beeing first, and that new-sprong and later-come ought rather to obey him; neither despised he Paul for 1167 having bene a persequuter of the Church before, but yeelded to the advise of truth, and easily approoved the right full way, which Paul contended for; giving vs a lesson of peaceablenes, and patience, that wee should not obstinately loue our owne conceits; but such things as sometimes are profitably and holesomly shewed vs by our brethren and felowes in office, those should we account of as our owne rather, if they bee true and rightfull: whervnto Paul having a carefull eye also, and Christianly providing for concord and peace, said, 1168 Let the Prophets speake, two or three, and let the rest iudge; and if any thing be reveiled to an other that sitteth by, lett the first holde his peace; teaching therein that many things are reveiled better to particular persons; and that every one, if any thing bee found better and more profitable, ought gladly to embrace it, not obstinately to striue for that which hee hath once conceived and mainteined : as these points (I say) noted thus by Cyprian made  1169 Austin bee perswaded of him, that seeing he knew, he might more easilie erre then Peter, he would haue bene very well content to change his minde, if any man by 1170 Scripture had prooved him to be overseene, or 1171 the Church had sifted the truth in a generall Councell, and agreed of it ; so the knowledge of the same engraven in those learned and godlie men, whom you speake of, induceth me to thinke that when they shall haue weighed what grounds of Gods woord, what consent of the Church , what Councels , what Fathers , impugne their opinion, they will not approove your obstinat striving for it. It may bee, that they will mislike of your art too, in that, for the surer vniting of them to you, and stirring them vpp against mee, you doe not onelie affirme that they are exceedinglie tainted in honour, if playes , which they allow of , bee iustlie disallowed by mee: but also, that it were a great reproche to them , though not so exceedingly great , as is the other, yet a great reproch, at any time to haue bene acquainted with things of so vile and base qualitie . For why? Is the writing of Comedies , or tragedies , but what speake I of writing? in mentioning whereof your art appeereth farther, sith I condemned it not: is the playing of them made by mee a thing of so vile and base qualitie, as persequuting, or blaspheming? Yet Saint Paul thought it no great disgrace for him, 1172 in former time to have bene a blaspemer, and a persequuter , when  1173 he was now become a faithfull minister of Christ : no more then for the Romans 1174 to haue bene slaves of sinne , when they did now obey the doctrine of the Gospell ; or for Abraham 1175 to haue bene in the land of Chald aea & served other Gods there; when  1176 he came now to Chanaan , and  1177 served there the Lord . Not,  1178 to haue bene evill, is a reproche ; but to bee. Againe, what reason have you to say that a much greater reproch it were to them, still to allow of playes : when you commend S  t Cyprian as a man of singular godlines, and zeale, 1179 who did more then allow , an other maner of matter then playes , even rebaptizing of men baptized by heretikes ? For as he folowed  1180 his predecessors in this errour, and therfore was the more excusable: so had the reverend men, whom you alleage, their predecessors that trained them to the liking of playes. Neither is it probable that they have bene advertised of their oversight by any such mans writing, as Cyprian was by  1181 Stephanus . And  1182 Cyprian continued in his errour still, notwithstanding that advertisement: howe knowe you that they haue not changed their opinion? Or, if they have not changed it, they may ere they dye: which none is able to say that Cyprian did, for ought that  1183 Austin could finde, a man most likely to haue found it, had there bene ought that could haue shewed it. Wherefore it savoureth stronglie of a bad qualitie, that you would perswade them, they must by my iudgement bee noted and disgraced with a fowle exceeding great reproche and infamie, if they allow of playes still . Much woorse doeth it favour, that you beare them in hand, although their mindes should alter and thinke hereof when they praye,  1184 Remember not, O Lord, the sinnes of my youth , it must bee neverthelesse a great reproche vnto them, at anie time to have bene acquainted with the writing and playing of such matters . But what qualitie , nay, what canker shall I say it savoureth of, that, vnto the Prophets , whose iudgement and autoritie the 1185 spirits of these Prophets were likely to be mooved with, I meane, vnto the Fathers and Councels laid in balance by me against your testimonies, you reply, that, if they be rightly vnderstoode, their forces are not bent against you ; Whereas your owne penne telleth you, that you know the contrary. For, the first and greatest Councell that I quoted, is  1186 that generall Councell of Constantinople , which (grounding it selfe vpo the place of Deuteronomie) noteth mens wearing of wemens raiment in playes as a heinous crime .Now this to make against you, euen being rightly vnderstoode , your selfe did acknowledge whe I alleaged it afore: in so much that you opposed therevnto the opinion of others interpreting that text otherwise then the councell doeth . The same did you likewise confesse of sundry Fathers vpon the same occasion,  & namely of Saint Cyprian ; whom here notwithstading you doe namelie mention as making not against you: yea, whom you moreover doe sett downe for a speciall paterne of the rest, to inferre the generall, that none of all the Fathers or Councells doe reproove your playes. For, Saint  1187 Cyprian (say you) inveigheth most eloquentlie and godly against the abuses of the 1188 tragike buskin in his time. So hee doeth also against the evills of warre, of iudgement seates, of iudges, of advocates, of golde, and riches. Shall we therefore conclude there should bee no warre, no tribunals, no iudges, no advocates, no golde, no riches; and likewise no tragike buskin in any sort ? Wherevpon you adde; No doubt the Fathers, as holy men of God, both in their Councelles, and in their bookes, have decreed, and written, many zealous & most godly things against the theatricall sightes of their times: but distinguish the times, the places, the qualities of the sights & actors, and the vse from the abuse; and it is evident by that which is said before, that we and our playes are not reproched by them . Thus labour you to face it out that your playes are not reproched by the Fathers , as dealing forsooth, iust like Saint Cyprian against the abuses of playing tragedies, not the vse ; when yet you had graunted that  1189 he condemneth  1190 the attyring of boyes in womens raiment, and teaching them to 1191 play the women , the self same thing he doth in the  1192 place you quote: so that your tragedie-playing is reprooved by him in your owne conscience, because of your Melantho and Nais played by boyes, although it were true that hee inveigheth onely against the abuses thereof, as you distinguish. The trueth is that he distinguished not so, neither for tragike buskin , nor for comike stertvp , but inveigheth against stage-playing it selfe: in like sort as he doeth against the games and sights of  1193 fensers , or sword-players , and of  1194 beast-players (so to terme them) wherewith he matcheth this of  1195 stage-players . So that the absurd conclusion which you frame, of no warre, no iudges, no advocates, no riches, if no tragike buskin , is framed amisse on errour, and would have reason enough if it were framed rightlie, as it should be, thus. that, if no stage-playing ought to be allowed by Saint Cyprians iudgement, then ought there no 1196 vniust warres, no perfidious advocates, no 1197 corrupt iudges, no 1198 covetous encrochers on the poore, to be allowed: because he inveigheth as well against the iniquitie, treacherie, briberie, and miserie of these, as he doeth against stage-playing . Or, if you will needes have him to reproove the abuses onely of stage-playing , not the thing: then by like reason he reprooveth not the blooddy sport and game of beast-players , or of sword- players , but the abuses of it. Which, I hope you will not affirme to be his meaning, no not for the former, sith  1199 the Church condemned it , as  1200 Epiphanius witnesseth:  1201 it, I say, the thing, not the abuses of it, as if it had a right vse , allowed by the Church . At least you will not make it his meaning for the later; which Emperours , lesse severe then that holie Martyr, even 1202 Constantine, 1203 Theodosius, 1204 Honorius , and  1205 Iustinian , tooke absolutely away by edictes and lawes , as a thing faulty of it selfe. Though, when I consider your speech, above rehearsed, of so many Circi, Theatra, Amphitheatra builded by the greatest & bravest Romans with huge charge; and of games sett out therein, referred by Aristotle to magnificence, a goodlie vertue : Your professed desire of approoving the Romans iudgement so farre foorth, as serveth for the necessarie defense of your owne dooings , causeth mee to dout that seeing in  1206 Theatra, condemned by the Church , you distingush abuse from vse, you will in  1207 Circi also, and  1208 Amphitheatra ; and therefore say that Cyprian reprooveth not the vse , but the abuses onely of beast-playes , yea of swoord-playes , vnlesse there come some other shift into your minde for severance of your stage- playes from them. And sure if one possessed with  1209 Machiavells humour and loue of blooddy sacrifices , as helping by the sight thereof to make men valiant, should wish for blooddy games of swoord- players in like respect: he might, by your example, not onely chalenge them from the marke of infamie wherewith the Romans branded them, (for  1210 Iuvenal, 1211 Suetonius ,  1212 Tacitus , and so foorth, doe reproche noble men and Knights for swoord- playing , not base folke;) but also defende them from the reproofe of Cyprian and all the rest of the Fathers. For  1213 Cyprian inveigheth most eloquently and godly against the abuses of swoord- playing in his time. So 1214 he doth also against the evills of warre, of iudgement seates, of iudges, of advocates, of gold, and riches. Shall wee therefore conclude there should be no warre, no tribunals, no iudges, no advocates, no gold, no riches, and likewise no swoord-playing in any sort? No dout the 1215 Fathers, as holy men of God, haue written many Zealous and most godly things against the amphitheatricall sights of their times: but distinguish the times, the places, the qualities of the sights and actors, and the vse from the abuse; and it is evident by that which Machiavell saith, that swoord-playes of our age are not reproched by them . A very true sentence, that, no dout the Fathers have written many zealous and most godly thinges against those sights of both sorts : and likewise true, no dout, that it is as evident by Machiavels discourse , that, if such swoord-playes should now be vsed in London , as were then at Rome , the Fathers checke them not; as it is by yours, that the Fathers doe not repoche the same stage-playes of Plautus, Terence, Seneca , or woorse (which comparison Rivales may well beare) played here, of late, among vs. Wherefore it had bene better for your credit to conteine your selfe within generalities, by saying that men mistake the Fathers : as Machiavell contented him selfe to say in grosse, that base and cowardly wretches have misse-interpreted our religion . For then I could not haue blamed you about particulars; your policie had prevented me, as it hath in Chrysostome : whose testimonie,  1216 quoted by mee against your wastfull expenses on such toyes, you make no aunswer to, no more then to  1217 others whom I quoted not. Now, when you affirme that Cyprian , and the rest, writing against the theatricall sights of their times, doe not write against such as in our time are vsed : I must needes tell you, that you shew lesse conscience and singlenes in your writing, then to whom you ought and easily might excell in all religious duties, Bodinus , and Lipsius . Of whom 1218 the one, declaring what neede there is for Censors for theaters of our time , alleageth sundry Fathers, and namelie Cyprian , against them: yea, that very epistle of  1219 Cyprian , which you specifie; and wring to the contrarie. The  1220 other, observing how the Fathers have inveighed against games, as 1221 springes of lust, and crueltie ; pointing, in the terme of lust, vnto theaters ; of crueltie , vnto amphitheaters ; doeth argue that swoord- playes if they were vsed in our time, might bee as well denied to bee reproched by the Fathers , as stage-playes of our time are. But, with whatsoever cunning or boldnes, you blinde the eyes of children, and make them beleeve that these ancient Prophets write not against your fansie: the praise given by you to our owne Prophets , those reverend and famous persons now living, causeth me to feare I was too faint when I said, They will not approove your obstinate striving for it ; I should haue said, They will not approove your bare opinion : or this, will , is also too faint; They doe not approove it . For, being excellent men in life , they love modestie, and yeeld vnto the knowen truth. Beeing excellent in learning , they know that your theatricall sights are of the same kinde, that the Fathers have decreed in their Councells, and written in their bookes against. The thinges which the Fathers have decreed and written, are not only Zealous , but also most godly , as you say. Most godly ; therefore consonant to the holy Scriptures : on the ground whereof it is expressely noted by  1222 Epiphanius likewise that  1223 the churches doctrine and ordinances were framed . And how can it bee thought then with any likelyhoode, that those reverend persons doe approove your stage-playes : which, by all presumptions, and your own verdict, they know that the Church, the Fathers, the Councels, the Scriptures have condemned? In deede if they were Papists, and such as would rather put on the shamelesse forehead of the hoore of Babylon , then confesse them selves to have bene overseene: a man might haue reason to think, that their owne doeings they would still allow of. For, wheras the profane and wicked toyes of Passion-playes , playes setting foorth Christs passion , procured  1224 by Popish Priests , who, being  1225 corrupted from the simplicitie that is in Christ , as they have transformed the celebrating of the Sacrament of  1226 the Lords supper into a  1227 Masse-game , and all other partes of Ecclesiasticall service into  1228 theatricall sights ; so, in steede of  1229 preaching the word , they caused it to be played; a thing  1230 put in practise by their flowres, the Iesuits , among the poore Indians ; but whereas these bables were reprooved by  1231 Vives : the  1232 Purgatorie-censors commanded  1233 that reproofe of his to be defaced; and the  1234 Divines of Lovan have razed it out accordingly. Yea, though  1235 some Italian Bishops in a Councell , vnder their Archbishop Cardinall Borrhom aeus , have  1236 ordoered , for their Province, that the Passion shall not bee played hereafter any where : yet (for feare of breeding a scruple in mens mindes that their Church might erre ) they say,  1237 it was a custome religiously brought in . So loth are ambitious spirits to acknowledge their oversights and faults. But seeing that our reverend Pastors and Doctors haue an other spirit , as  1238 he saith of Caleb , and professe a purer religion then Papists : you must give mee leave to suspect rather that you charge them wrongfully, then that men of excellent godlines and wisdome doo allow and thinke well of so manifold evills, as in your playes I haue disclosed. And thus, a great deale later then my desire and hope was, but as soone as sicknes and busines would permit, haue you that performed, which in your conclusion, by woords, you request me to forbeare the doeing of; in your whole discourse, by deedes, you haue induced and vrged mee to vndertake. The reason added by you to move mee to forbeare it, namely, that I have some thing else to doe, then to trouble my selfe, and my better studies. With a matter of this nature and moment ; I knowe not whether it would haue seemed sound to others, sure to mee it did not. For, if I had lived among the Iewes at that time, when  1239 the priests neglecting the service of the altar, and sacrifices of the law, made hast to be partakers 1240 of vnlawfull games in the wrastling place : I should of all studies have deemed that the best , which the Lord requireth at his Prophets hands, 1241 to rise vp in the gappe , and keepe out  1242 the enemie striving to enter in thereby. What studie therefore could I account so good, as this, to spend my vacant time in, when Christians, 1243 anointed by God, 1244 an holy Priesthood , make hast from spirituall sacrifices and service to be partakers of stage-players ; that is, of more vnlawful games then were 1245 those exercises in the wrastling place , as  1246 the thing it selfe,  &your own  1247 law may teach you? Againe, the  1248 vertuous training vp of youth among vs, aud the  1249 godly life of all sorts of persons, are matters of great moment and weight in his sight,  1250 who without respect of person iudgeth everie man according to his woorke . Now, what hurt it is for youth to bee seasoned with a liking of stage- players ; I say not, to bee stage-players them selves, which is woorse, but to have a liking and love of such onely; the autour of 1251 the dialogue (were it Tacitus , or Quintilian) touching the decay of eloquence among the Romans , doeth shew by  1252 their example. And, how the maners of all spectators commonlie are hazarded by the contagion of theatricall sights, I made plaine vnto you in my former letters by the testimonies of learned men and noble nations; all granted by your selfe, or as good as granted, in that you haue either not answered them at all, or vnsufficientlie. Wherefore, considering S. 1253 Aust . zealous care to reclaime Alipius (a young man who he loved, a worthy Bishop afterward) from  1254 the vaine delite that he tooke in seeing games of chariot-drivers : I could not but esteeme it a thing of price, and woorth, to seeke to reclaime from a farre more vaine and dangerous delite the Students of your house, among whom there are many no lesse deere to me then Alipius was to Austin , and as likelie (by Gods grace) hereafter to proove well. With whom I have also greater cause to hope that I shall prevaile, then he had with Alipius , because your selfe tell me, that you doe and ever will most gladly embrace, not onely my good will, but also my iudgement in this cause so farre as I write in the generall against stage-players . For I am perswaded that their opinions of me are as kinde as yours: and then doe they agree with me in a maner about the point wee treate of. They will agree wholy, if they weigh advisedlie one rule , which  1255 you can teach them, and I would I might entreat you so to doe: namely, that 1256 the generall doeth evermore comprise the speciall . The Lord behold both them, and you, in his mercy: and giue you all his grace to know the way that leadeth vnto life eternall, and to walke therein. At Queenes College , the 30th of May . 1593. Yours in the Lord Iohn Rainolds. Non feres, opinor,  aegre, missa haec a me in vulgus, quae unum habent, &alterum aliter, atque tu senseris, & docueris. Neque enim ego contra te stare volui, a quo steti semper, & Deo faciente stabo: sed adversus alios disputavi, quos sequi non potui: eos etsi tu sequereris, &ad probares. Rogavite coram de utraque quaestione: nec tamen audire a te nisi nudam sententiam tuam valui. Petii etiam a communi amico nostro Errico Cussio, ut de te ipsum hoc sciscitaretur, si mihi autor esses, ut commentationes istas typis mandarem. Sed aut te convenire ille non potuit: aut accepit nihil, quod responderet. Audi, mi Rainolde: quaestionem de histrionibus publice ego tractavi antea quam tibi haec quaestio cum altero esset. Itaque ipsam demere nunc de corpore reliquo, honestum non fuerit. Imo ad me spectare videtur, defendere semper jus civile, quod profitcor, &quod semper iustissimum observavi. In vestras autem si sedesq veni, non solum tutari conatus sum nostras: tu illud nosti iuris esse, quando & tu invisere nos in nostris sedibus voluisti. Quanquam de te ego cogitare nequivi, qui post meam commentationem ingressus es istam disceptationem: at moralia, & politica sacrorum librorum aut nostra existimavi, aut certe communia nobis, & theologis: & vero etiamnum versor in eadem opinione. Vale, vir clarissime. Et de meis his chartis, et literis sic facies, vt te in opere, quod nunc aggrederis, arduo, et summo, ne tantillum quidem morentur: neque enim tanti sunt. Jul. 7. lubens ambo concedo: alterum, ne aegre feram commentarium a te in lucem editum, quimeam sententiam de Samuele pythonissae, &histrionibus oppugnet; alterum, ut literas chartasque tuas sic accipiam, ne me in opere, quod aggredior, vel tantillum morentur. Cur enim ego tibi magis irascar, quod de Samuele adversus  1257 Augustinum, aliosque theologos a 1258 me citatos disputes; aut quaestionem de histrionibus publice tractaris antea quam ego de iis cum altero controversarer: quam tu succenseas mihi, quod probationes opiniones tuae a 1259 Bellarmino propositas iam pridem convellerim; & a pestibus scenicorum spectaculisque theatralibus  1260 nostros dehortatus sim, prius quam tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares. Nihil autem esse quamobre me chartae tuae remorentur, verissimo colligis argumento: Neque enim tanti sunt, inquis. Huc accedit, quod actum agere vetamur proverbio. Et ego, in meis adversus Bellarminum de Samuele praelectionibus, rationes omnes, quibus  1261 contendis Samuelem ipsum a pythonissa evocatum, satis superque refutavi. Binis porro literis, quas ad familiarem tuum de ludis ludiombusque, uti scis, scripsi, ea quae ex Platone, Aristotele, Tertulliano, Augustino, Aquinate, aliisque citas, aut falso, aut frustra urgeri, planum feci. Quin & ipse, quum fabularum, quales Terentianae sunt, verbis factisque inhonestis & improbis aspersae, actores pronuntias jure improbari, sententiam meam astruis. Nam Vlysses redux, Hippolytus, & Rivales (de quibus amici tui Momus hanc quae nobis est litem excitavit) non minus illis vitiis laborant, quam nonnullae, immo Rivales multo magis quam ulla, Terentii. Itaque licet quaedam  1262 addas refutatu forsitan non indigna, ut quod mimos asseris habitu muliebri egisse personam viri, lenonis, adulteri, temulenti, ne temulenti in Rivalibus eorum similes videantur; & 1263 Theophrasti exemplo, qui in schola docens, ita omnes gestus rei, quam tractabat, congruentes. adhibuit, ut exerta lingua labra circumlinxerit quam heluonem describeret, histrioniam oratori concludas esse necessariam: tame cum hoc redarguat  1264 Quintilianus, illud  1265 Macrobius, alia alii, quorum ad fontes digitum intendi; & operam in minus firmis refellendis, qui firmiora fregerim, a me sumi nolis; obsequor voluntati tuae. Ac eo quidem facio libentius quae cupis, quoniam impetrare a te vicissim aveo, ut, si qua deinceps typis excudes, in iis duarum rerum maiorem habeas rationem; pietatis, & modestiae. Pietatis dico, non tam ob eam causam quod theologoru autoritate in rebus religionis te valde moveri dicas, in rebus morum non valde; quanquam ob eam quoque; nam  1266 theologia, ut fidei, sic vitae est magistra: quam quod histrioniam colendam esse statuis, non tanquam rem honestam, sed tanquam necessariam naturae depravatae & medendis hominum vitiis. Et sicut nec medici a mendacio refugiunt officioso, nec alii ulli (tua haec sunt verba) quod  1267 alias explicavi; & mendacium res omnium turpissima est tame: ita hic medici isti ab his indecoris imitationibus non subtiahent se: Et morbos corporis per spectacula curari scribit Hippocrates. Vbi, cum  1268 fides doceat non facienda mala ut eveniant bona, primum, doleo te, quem fidei causa exulare ferunt, & mendacium rem turpissimam esse confiteri, & emolumenti gratia mentiendum contendere. Deinde, nullos esse qui officiosum mendacium refugiant, nullos, non modo medicos, sed nec alios ullos, nollem dixisses: ne cui videaris memoriam  1269 eius renovare, qui, impurus ipse, persuasissimum habuit neminem hominem pudicum, aut ulla corporis parte purum esse; verum plerosq; dissimulare vitium, & calliditate obtegere. Praeterea, quum adiungis te alias hoc explicasse, amandas nos ad similem  1270 commentationem, in quaid confirmas Heliodori, gravis scilicet autoris, iudicio, & isto Poetae nescio cuius versu, Quum vitia prosunt, peccat qui recte facit. Qua sententia quid potest fingi flagitiosius, impurius, execrabilius? Et tamen quo magis eam, eiusque scopum, adversus Dei verbum, cuius memini, praemunias, Scito (inquis) in tota hac disputatione non me ullibi dicere mala facienda ut bona adveniant, sed abusum malorum malum non esse, at bonum. Ita, quia mendaciis curantur melancholici, ut ibidem adiicis, quemadmodum hic & morbos per spectacula curari notas: distinguis, hunc abusum, quem vocas, mendacii bonum esse, non malum; neque verbo Dei disputatione tua contradici. Quo genere argutiolae, stuprum, adulterium, incestum, & quid non? defendere licebit. Nam  1271 Antiochus, Seleuci filius, contrahendis incestis cum noverca nuptiis, e gravissimo evasit morbo: ac licet incestus sit malus, nec committendus ut adveniat bonum; tamen abusus malorum (ut tu doces) malus non est, sed bonus. Hujusmodi fundamenta impietatis & nequitiae vehementer peto ne amplius nobis iacias; praesertim in operibus quae typis evulgabis; idque in Academia nostra; & viro clarissimo, insigni ecclesiae lumini, dedicatis; ac ita dedicatis, ut etiam eius filio, lectissimo, & summae spei puero, Tobiae, legenda commendentur. Vides enim quanto cum dedecore nostro fama, a comitiis nostris, quoquoversum perlatura sit, pueros, quibus maximam deberi reverentiam profanus 1272 poeta sensuit, in nostra Academia publice doceri ut de rebus morum quid theologi sentiant non magnopere curent; neque vereantur mentiri quum erit commodum; immo peccare se putent, si, quum vitia prosunt, recte faciant; & malorum quidem usum Dei verbo condemnari credant, sed abusum malorum malum esse negent, bonum contendant. Modestiae vero plus in tuis scriptis idcirco desidero, quod  1273 Deuteronomii locum interpretatus aliter ac theologi, ac patres, ac concilia, quemadmodum declaravi, concludis hoc epiphonemate: Nihil facit lex illa Dei adversus histrioniam; & minus nihilo aliud, quicquid theologi afferunt. Dixeras paulo prius te theologorum autoritate in rebus religionis moveri valde: & scripturarum interpretatio res est religionis. Quanto consultius veterum Romanorum laudatam a M.  1274 Tullio consuetudinem sequutus esses, ut arbitrari te diceres etiam quae scires, quam ut tam fidenter quod nescis affirmares. Nam, quod legem Mosis, Non induetur mulier veste virili, nec vir utetur veste faeminea, interpretaris, contra omnes theologos, non proprie, sed figurate; non de vestibus, sed de flagitio retectis vestibus commisso: hujus rei probationem, etsi petitione principii tantum nixam, tamen fidenter item asseris percunctando; Nam additur ibi, inquis, Abominabilis apud Deum est, qui facit haec; quod autem scelus hic est, ut sit abominatio? Minime quidem miror, te, quem theologorum autoritas non movet in re religionis, in qua te permultum illis tribuere profiteris verbo, atque adeo in scriptis modo affirmaveras; ita eorum disputationes de histrionia, re nimirum morali, floccifacere, ut quicquid theologi contra eam afferunt, id omne minus nihilo esse asseveres. Quamquam hoc minus nihilo esse aliquid, familiaris tuus, tametsi tuis istis magnis multisque adiutus, suo fortasse ad meas literas, vel responso docebit, vel silentio. Sed utut haec sese habeant, modestiam quidem certe in pronuntiando maiorem ut adhibeas, praesertim quum de rebus religionis agis, tua te ipsius experientia, in rebus morum, immo iuris admonere debet. Qui, cum affirmes, atque ex  1275 Tacito doceas, in theatro publico vel orationes, vel carmina recitare, probrosum Romae visum: satis demonstras te  1276 Praetoris verba, Infamis est qui artis ludicrae pronuntiandive causa in scena prodierit, nimis sicco pede (quod aiunt) transnsse. Nam, ut concedatur quod Alciato tribuis, artem non facere eum, qui semel, iterum, quid artis facit: at pronuntiandi causa in scenam prodit, qui prodit semel tantum; ac proptera notam & metuit Laberius, & subierunt de quibus Tacitus, tametsi gratis recitarent. Vale: & meam admonitionem eodem quaeso animo, quo ego munusculu tuum, accipias, id est, grato, candidoque. Iul. 10. 1593. Neque grato, candid ove animo munusculum meum accepisti, neque quidquam est in literis tuis non longe, lateq positum a veritate. Quid enim tu me impietatis, & nequitiae aicis architectum in quaestione de mendacio officioso, in qua ipsum hoc non intelligis, quid sit officio sum mendacium? Etenim meministi, recensuisse te Petri illud in officiosis, quod contra omne officium fidei, & religionis fuit. Quid me impurissimo assimulas principi, siim o reliqui nullum tibi in eadem quaestione scriptorem extra theologos, at alios omnes nec sine theologis mecum facere explicavi? Te ad epistolas meas amaendo: caeteros ad libros magis, quam ad commentationes, de iure belli; quos exituros aliquando, praemonui dedicatione prima ad illustrissimum Comitem: &, Deo volente, edam brevi. Tuae enim istiusmodi admonitiones non tenent me, quem aut in ea parte non improbant viri in Ecclesia, & republica vestra clarissimi, & laudatissimi. Quid me modestiae laesae facis tu reum, qui nunc ex papistico spiritu arces me a tractatione librorum sacrorum: Et, quod Erastus ait similibus tui, non vides, tentare haec te cis, annos istos septuaginta? Non vides, te cum eo sic agere imperiose, qui Papae imperium contempsit, & exulare patria potuit, & universo regno Papali? Verissima ferunt, qui haec ferunt: et in his tu vinceris a me, qui pro pietate me obiurgas tamen. Communes sunt sacri libri; & in his, quae spectant ad secundam tabulam, nostri magis, quam vestri. Sic ut, autoritati theologorum valde nos tribuere hic, minime necesse sit. Doce contrarium tu, si potes. Noli calumniari, me pueros docere, ut de rebus morum non magnopere curent, quid sentiant theologi. nam de me, de iurisconsulto scripsi, & re politica. De re religionis quod scripsi, id sentio: & in ea serio theologorum valde tribuo autoritati. Sed res religionis quid est? Scripturarum interpretatio omnis, aut omnium, non est res religionis. Theologia fidei, & virae magistra est. sed non omnis vitae. nec omnis pars sermonum. Dei in solidum vestra est. Ostende diversum, audiam. De rationibus theologorum in quaestione ista de histrionibus sic census, ut quas contra histriones illos publice mercenarios, & indignarum fabulaerum actores habent, cae nihili non sint. Sed quae sunt adversus omnem histrioniam, eas minus nihilo esse, asserui, & vero etiamnum assero. Pudet earum me, quas Tertullianus, quem unum e nostris iurisconsultis opinantur, adfert adversus cothurnos tragicos, & fictas scaenicorum personas. Quam etiam obtrudere pro Potentissima videtur, esse nihili, demonstravi. Nec fidenter (ut tu ais) adfirmo, quod nescio: sed tu reprehendis confidentissime, quae non capis. Audi, audi. Quae in histrionia vitari peccatae negotio nullo saepe solent, & possunt semper; ea nihil contra histrioniam faciunt. Sed peccatum illud, si quod est, promiscui vestimentorum usus vitari s aepe solet, & semper potest. Ergo. Qui sensus bonarum aliarum legum est prohibentium hunc usum vestium, idem verisimiliter est & bonae legis Dei. Sed aliarum legum sensus nihil facit contra histrioniam. Abominatio ubi dicitur in Scripturis, ibi peccatum significatur, quod facile superet flagitia pleraque omnia. Sed hoc vestimentorum non est tale. Ergo ubi dicitur abominatio, ibi hoc peccatum non significatur. Et ubi propria significatio non accipitur, ibi figurata fuerit, vel aliter impropria. at in lege illa Dei propria significatio non accipitur. Quae autem figurata locutio sic exponitur, ut verae sententiae convemat, & aliis similibus locis stabiliatur, ea bene exposita est. Sed sic exponitur a me figurata illa locutio. Utinam, utinam sic contenderes, & non reijceres argumentis bonis fabulas non bonas semper: quibus illudere pueris potes, nobis non potes. De Augustini sententia, & de sententia Aquinatis ad eundem locum, quas recitavi, & falso, aut frustra urgeri adfirmas, nihil nunc dico, quando tu me ablegas ad scripta tua Anglicana: nisi illud tacendum non sit, ex sententia utriusque adfirmarique, peccatum vestiarium non esse flagitiosissimum. Mea sunt reliqua. Et ea (falleris) non dixi nihili esse, quae tu nunquam refutaveris, si tibi sententiam non pronuncias: sed qua aut te, aut me, aut alium morari ab operibus maioribus tantillum non debeant. Nec morabitur me sane quaestio haec. Itaque nec a te literas alias de ea expecto, nec expeto. Ego cupiam a te iterum audire, quae a te primo conviciae audivi in vita? cupiam illa ? priusquam tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares. Ego ludios non laudo, sed tu cum convicio ludis genere istoc loquendi laudatissimo, & per suasorias Senecae persuasissimo tibi. Ego cathedram istam non occupo, quam bonis adprobantibus teneo de principis optima, & humanissimae largitate: & in qua sic doceo, ut benignitatis suae reginam serenissimam, iudicii reliquos non paeniteat. Magna ego horum nomina defendo in commentatione mea de histrionibus. Si enim Tobias Matthaeus, si alii tot viri gravissimi, & religiosissimi ist haec iuventutis aut exercitamentae, aut ludos adprobarunt, praefecti, &moderatores collegiorum, atque totius lumina academiae: si princeps sanctissima, religionis summum praesidium, & aulici eius, viri spectatissimae saepientia praesentia sua honestarunt ludos: ludos tu apellare pestes qui vales? Hic enim de Tertulliano rectissime , Cur liceat videre, qu ae facere, flagitium est? Et de nostris in eodem preposito , par est culpa, spectacula edere,  & spectare spectacula. Neque h ic me damnabit Matthaeus. neque enim sic contaminavi nomen eius, ut putas tu, dedicatione libelli mei: ne q; filium malis imbui volo, praeceptionibus a lectione commentationis meae. Ne quaeso, ne te Matthaeum inter & me ponas non vocatus. Tota haec tua epistola, praeter maledicta, aut his constat, quae ad te non spectant: aut his, quae non spectant ad me: aut, quae non ad rem, quae in manibus est: aut si quid habet aliud, id vnum est, quod tu meae commentationis verba non legisti, aut non expendisti bene. Nec enim scripsi ego, oratori necessariam histrioniam, sed poematibus: & ita argumentatus sum, Si eius, quod leve, & importunum est in oratoria, ut est actio, habetur ratio tanquam necessarii: cius etiam, quod leve, &importunum est in poetica, habenda ratio est tanquam necessarii. hoc autem histrionia est. Ergo in poetica habenda sic est ratio histrioniae. Rursus dum docui ex Alciato, eum non facere artem, qui semel, iterum quid artis facit, sic argumentor, Ars notata est edicto. Sed unaproditio non est ars. Ergo una proditio non est notata. Alciato ego illud non tribuo: quanquam est erratum in subnotato capite, quod esse debuit C C V  I I. De Laberio plus satis. De oratoribus, & vatibus subieci, ut mores illius populi antiquos magis ostenderem: de quibus sane illi apud Tacitum disceptabant: & secundum quos visum etiam crimen maiestatus laesae, si magistratus pro concione legisset vel codices (m male memini) eorum, quae ad magistratus spectabant tamen. Sed & dixi, in scaena fuisse eos oratores, & vates. Sed & pretii, aut praemii spe, atque fiducia recitationibus incubuisse, persuasum est mihi. Itaque, tribus his convenientibus, censura a patriis moribus, recitatione in scaena, & spe praemii, notati. Itaque falsum tu colligis, notatos semper omnes qui etiam gratis recitarent. An sicco (quod exprobras) sicco nimis pede transi, praetoris edictum, an tu in sicco es? Vale. Rogo autem, atque obsecro te, si ad aures tuas a me accidit nunc insolens aliquid, ut sciaes, ad meas etiam accidisse insolentissimum a te: &ad tanta crimina patientem esse non oportere. Et vale iterum. Londini. Idib. Iul. Non me continere possum, quin de meis libris bellicis tibi, argutiolam dicenti, quod de abusu mali in commentationibus adnotavi, exscribam Augustini unum hoc , In nuptiis est bonus usus mali, hoc est bonus usus concupiscenti ae carnis. Ne qu aeso, ne hominem tui studiosissimum sic tractaris pessime, immerito . Vitia non sunt, quibus recte uti licet. hoc Lactantius. Sic possumus concupiscentia carnis. sic mendacio, &c. Vale tertium. rex magnus: & beatos pronuntiat discipulos suos  1278 Christus, quum homines conviciis eos affecerint immerentes, ipsius causa. Quo aequiore animo, benevolentiae erga te meae, & veritatis eorum quae scripsi, mihi conscius, tuam, Alberice, inhumanitatem ac maledicentiam, iniquissime iustissimam amicissimam que admonitionem vellicantes, fero. Etenim, nec grato candidove animo munusculum me tuum accepisse asseris: nec quicquam est in meis literis non longe lateque positum a veritate. Quorum alterius nullam certiorem habes probationem, quam Galatae habuerunt malevolentiae Pauli;  1279 Num inimicus factus sum vobis, dum vera vobis loquor? alterum falso dici, tuum de mimis alusque multis silentium est indicio; nisi forte dubium sit quin ea falsi convicturus fueris, si quidem potuisses, qui, quae non potes, conatis. Atque (ut caetera, quae confuse carpis, ordine percurram) quaed ego commemoravi me a pestibus scenicorum spectaculisque theatralibus nostros dehortatum, prius quam tu cathedram istam, ex qua ludios laudas, occupares; ut hinc commonefieres, tibi, qui sententiam tuam in vulgus editam negabas aegre ferre me opo[illeg.]tere, quod quaestionem de histrionibus publice tractasses antea quam ego de iis cum altero controvertsarer, pari ratione ferendam aegre non esse meam a sententia tua dissensionem, quod mihi periculosos videri ludios docuissem prius quam hic tibi locus laudandi cos foret: in eo vociferaris te a me convicia, quae nunquam a quoquam prius, audivisse. Quid ita? Quia cathedram istam (ut ais) non occupas, sed tenes de Principis humanissimae & optimae largitate. Ita, cum vocabula, tenere, & occupare, idem significent, quemadmodum ex  1280 Plauto,  1281 Virgilio,  1282 Cicerone, observavit  1283 Nonius; atque hoc sensu ego (quod sancte affirmare possum) illud usurparim: tu absurdam mihi calumniam affingis, ac si dixissem te professionis locum, non Reginae nostrae beneficio, sed vi, aut fraude, aut nescio quo modo, possidere. Similiter affirmas te ludios non laudare, sed me cum convicio ludere genere istoc loquendi laudatissimo, & persuasorias Senecae persuasissimo mihi. In quo quid istoc loquendi genere significes, fateor, non intelligo: dicturus alioqui ad illud quod e Seneca vitio mihi vertis. Sed errarunt turpiter in laudationis tractatione & nomine  1284 viri eruditi, si tu non laudas ludios: quos poematum perfectioni, quos oratoriae facultati, quos & corporum morbis, & animorum vitiis medendis necessarios esse asseveras. Quaeris, cum Praefecti collegiorum, viri gravissimi, approbarint ludos; cum sanctissima Princeps, aulicique eius, viri spectatissimi, sua praesentia honestarint ludos, ludos appellare pestes qui valeam: hic enim, ut rectissime Tertullianus, Cur liceat videre, quae facere flagitium est? ita & de nostris dici posse asseris, Par est culpa spectacula edere & spectare. Parem esse culpam non ausim tecum dicere. Nam  1285 Tertullianus ibidem, & rectissime, Cur liceat audire, quae loqui non licet? Neque tamen arbitror aeque peccare cum qui maledico aut scurrae praebet aures, ac maledicu & scurram ipsum. Sed ego ad illorum luminum approbantium spectantiumve ludos iudicia, & exempla, familiari tuo dudum  1286 respondi: ut, si tibi rursum respondeam, actum agam; quod me facturum negavi. Tu, qui possis ludorum, Rivalibus nostris (ut docui) puriorum, non actores solum sed etiam autores iure improbatos pronuntiare, ipse videris: cum scias spectatores fuisse Rivalium sanctissimam Principem caeterosque; & in pari culpa cos, qui spectant talia, cum iis qui edunt, ponas. Nam quod tu Terentii similiumque fabulas verbis factisque inhonestis & improbis aspersas esse scribis, ideoque earum actores iure improbas propter corruprelam &contagionem: idem ego, pestes scenicorum nuncupans, per metaphoram dixi. Et mihi figurate id exprimere nefas est, quod tibi proprie enuntiare ius est? Affirmanti tibi, non esse tanti tua scripta quae remorari me deberent, assensi. Hic me falli ais: nec enim te dixisse ea esse nihili, quae ego nunquam refutavero si mihi sententiam non pronuntiem; sed quae me morari ab operibus maioribus non debeant. Quid ego aliquando refutavero aut refutaverim, iudicent alii aequiores: nec mihi ius ferendae hac de re sententiae assumo, nec tibi defero. Verum nihili esse tua scripta non dixi: tantum repetii tuum argumentum, Neque enim tanti sunt; ac ex eo intuli, nihil esse (an inde emersittuum nihili?) quamobrem ab opere, quod eram aggressurus, me distinerent tua scripra. De familia liberata, inquit  1287 Cicero ad Terentiam, nihil est quod te moveat. Non dicit familiam liberatam esse nihili: sed nihil esse cur res ea moveat Terentiam; neque enim erat tanti. Nihil esse cur iuris interpres historias legat cognoscatve,  1288 te ipsum scribere meministi. An quod sentires eas esse nihili? Absit. Nam & 1289 sacras divinasque historias eo nomine te complecti indicas. Caeterum, nihilesse cur iuriusconsultis in illis tempus conterat, significatum voluisti. Porro, quod adieci te Theophrasti exemplo histrioniam oratori necessariam esse concludere, ais me tuae commentationis verba non legisse, aut non expendisse bene: nec enim te scripsisse oratori necessariam histrioniam, sed Poematibus. Itane vero? Poematibus tantum, non item oratori? Cur igitur, postquam dixeras posse mulieris partes a viro, servi a libero, ebrii a sobrio, impuri ab honesto, belluae ab homine, agi aliquatisper utilitatis & ioci causa, haec verba subtexuisti. Oratori sunt omnes illae personae induendae saepius, nec cum dedecore, quia necessario:  1290 referunt Theophrastum & docentem in scholis gestu omnia dicta comitari solitum, etiam quum de ebrio, similiue oratio incidisset? Cur, quod de oratore nominatim dicis, non doces quemadmodum ad poemata referri accommodarique volueris, & non ad oratorem? Cur omnem mentione exempli Theophrasti, qui oratorio genere sermonis usus est, non poetico, in reprehensione dicti met supprimis? Atque (si permittis ut hoc a te quaeram more censorum) Ex animi tui sententia; nonne quum Athenaeus in cius exemplo, non ebrii qui vino, sed  1291 heluonis & gulosi qui cibo se ingurgitat, mentionem faciat; tu, mutata voce, nominasti ebrium, ut, qui ebriorum egerunt partes in Rivalibus, nihil aliud fecisse quam fecit Theophrastus, & oratores facere convenit, viderentur? Ad illud quod asserui, non solum fidei sed etiam vitae magistram esse theologiam; quo magis me optare, ut, qui theologorum autoritate in rebus religionis te valde dixeris moveri, ne adiunxisses, in rebus morum non valde: respondes theologiam magistram esse vitae, sed non omnis vitae, communes esse sacros libros, & in his, quae spectant ad secundam tabulam, vestros magis quam nostros; ut autoritati theologorum mulcum vos tribuere hic, non sit necesse; meque iubes contrarium docere, si possim. Sane, si non possem: tu tamen satis causae, cur mihi sententia tua displiceret, fuisse docuisses. Nam si theologiam magistram vitae iudicas, licet non omnis vitae: debeas ergo multum theologoru autoritati in rebus morum tribuere, tametsi non in rebus morum quibuscunque. Verum, universae vitae magistram esse theologiam, tum docui, quum asserui, si animadvertisses: notatis ad marginem  1292 duobus Scripturae locis. Quorum ex priore id confirmant omnes ecclesiae Christianae: quum in  1293 cathechismo theologis committunt explicationem totius decalogi, non primae solum tabulae; neque sensum a iuriscosultis peti iubent. Ex posteriore, scriptor tui ordinis, Chassanaeus, a 1294 te laudatus: quum,  1295 distinguens alias cunctas scientias, in iisque vestram, a nostra, Theologia (inquit) inserit virtutes, docet facienda, & omnia ad salutem pertinentia. 2. ad Timotheum. Quin & 1296 ipse, quum Baldum, Bartolum, Accursium, comentariis ius universum illustrasse perhibes, doces nullam partem sacrorum libroru (quid enim in Scripturas Baldus, caeterique?) vestri iuris esse. Quid? Quum contendis  1297 nullam literaru Graecarum peritiam in iurisconsulto requiri;  1298 ex dialectica posse plurimum detrimenti & incommodi ad vos venire, nihil boni; 1299 ne historias quidem quicquam conferre: nonne sacros libros relinquis nobis integros, ad quorum cognitionem  1300 Hebraea quoque lingua, non modo Graeca, opus esse, ac  1301 historiam, & 1302 dialecticam plurimum adiuvare, declarat Augustinus? Mihi vero videris hoc animo fuisse, quando, solis libris prudentiae civilis, iurisconsultos  1303 hortatus ut vacarent; id  1304 te de solis Iustinianeis libris, & horum interpretibus, Accursianis & Alciateis intelligere demonstrasti. Teque existimo, cum  1305 ius canonicum Canonistis, ut suam messem assignaris; ac cos a Legistis, a Theologis autem utrosque distinxeris: omnino, sicut illis totum corpus iuris, alteris civiles, alteris canonici; ita nobis totum corpus Bibliorum attribuendum censuisse. Quod si iam in aliam sententiam transiisti, & in his quae pertinent ad secundam tabulam Scripturas non tam nostras esse putas quam vestras: ostende mihi, quaeso, ubi eius tabulae lex ultima,  1306 Non concupisces, a iurisconsultis pertractetur; ut, utrae ecclesiae, reformatae, an Pontificiae, saniorem tradant de concupiscentia doctrinam, ex vestris, ad quos huius rei disquisitio magis quam ad nostros pertiner, intelligam. Quia non sine magna multorum injuria falso affirmaras, nec medicos, nec alios ullos a mendacio officioso refugere; ut mihi videreris monendus ne memoriam Neronis renovares, qui alios ex se aestimans persuasissimum habuit pudicum esse neminem: impuro Principi te conferri, licet iuste, si injuste homines traducas, quod a te factum res docebit, veruntamen indignaris; meque negas intelligere quid sit officiosum mendacium; quippe qui  1307 Petri illud recensuerim in officiosis, quod contra omne officium fidei & religionis fuit. Equidem ignorantiam hac in re meam tantam esse fateor, ut ne aifsit quidem officiosum ullum mendacium cognoscam, immo nec esse credam: ne tu me mireris quid sit id nescire. Sed, ne magni criminis loco mihi exprobres hanc imperitiam, scito Senecam aliosque veterum Romanorum pari inscitia, in re majori, laborasse. Nam,  1308 quum Aterius (libertinum reum defendens, cul obijciebatur quod patroni cocubinus fuisset, dixisser, Impudicitia in ingenuo crime est, in servo necessitas, in liberto officiu: res in jocos abiit, Non facis mihi officium; &, Multum ille & hic in officiis versatur; ex eo impudici & obscaeni (inquit Seneca) aliquandiu officiosi vocitati sunt. Ecce tibi distinctio impudicitiae in criminosam, necessariam, & officiosam: cujus pars ultima quid esset, ignorarunt isti; immo nec esse ullam officiosam impudicitiam rati sunt. Itidem mendacium, nescio  1309 quis primus,  1310 quod fit nocumenti causa, perniciosum; quod ludi, jocosum; quod autem utilitatis, officiosum vocavit. Ego vero, qui efficium esse id quod fieri debeat sum edoctus, unde nomen ipsum ab efficiendo ductum  1311 sunt qui notent nullum mendacium officiosum puto: quia  1312 nullum mendacium est ex veritate, ut ait  1313 Deus mentiri nescius; & 1314 deposito mendacio veritatem quisque jubemur loqui proximo suo;  1315 mendaciumque peccatum esse, etiam quum redundat in Dei gloriam, edocemur. Sed, ut tu mendacium utile commodumque officiosum nominasti, in ista conclusione, 1316 Si ad utilitatem sermo datus est, ut censet  1317 Aristoteles; quaeso, num improbemus mendacium officiosum? ita illud Petri, qui utilitatis, non joci, aut nocumenti, causa est mentitus, in officiosis recensui: ut & 1318 periurium eius (ex tua ratione) officiosum dixerim, quia sermo datus est ad utilitatem, ut censet Aristoteles; &, Iusiurandum rei servandae, non perdendae, conditum est, inquit  1319 Plautus. At Petri mendaciu contra omne officium fidei & religionis fuit. Scio. Et omne mendacium (sicut docui) est contra aliquod officium: nullum igitur officiosum. At officii nostri est ut iuvemus alios, dices fortasse: itaque officiosum mendaciu te vocare quod hoc officium praestet. Esto. Sed ita & incestum Antiochi officiosum appellaveris. Nam officii quoque nostri est ut nostra ipsorum vitam tueamur. Quare, licet scirem Petri mendacium perniciosum, & esse, & haberi a tractatoribus officiosi mendacii: tamen quia definiunt mendacium officiosum, quod est pro salute & commodo alicuius; aut, quod ordinatur ad aliquod bonum utile; quo intenditur iuvamentum alterius, ut ait 1320 Thomas, vel remotio nocumenti; perniciosum autem, quod fit ex malignitate; aut, quo nocumentum alterius intenditur; tu me doceas velim quemadmodum sibi constent, aut cur debuerim secus de Petro sentire ac scripsi. Neque enim fecit ex malignitate, aut nocumentum alterius (nam cuius tandem?) intendit: sed, timore lapsus, utilitatem, commodum, salutem spectavit suam, & intendit nocumenti, periculi nempe imminentis si ex Christi discipulis esse agnosceretur, remotionem ac depulsionem. Iam iniuriose & falso tibi excidisse, nullos improbare officiosum mendacium, tua ipsius confessio testis est. Etenim theologos, quorum, in quaestione de iure divino, unius autoritatem pluris aestimare, quam centum iuris humani peritorum  1321 debes; theologos, & quidem cos theologos, quorum  1322 hunc maximum appellas,  1323 illum summum,  1324 alios praestantes esse non negabis; theologos plerosque omnes, tametsi solos, m[illeg.]cum facere concedis. Immo hoc quoque falso & iniuriose, quod solos theologos; testantur epistolae tuae, ad quas me amandas. Quippe Iustum Lipsium, &Tassum, mecum esse, ibi agnoscis. Aristotelem negas de nostro loqui mendacio, quum  1325 ait mendacium per se malum esse & vituperabile, sed de arroganti, vano, versuto, pravo, & id genus, aliis. Arqui de mendacio in genere eum loqui, &propterea de nostro, t[illeg.]m ex iis apparet quae de viro bono &veritatis amante subijcit: tum ex eo ipso quod ait, per se malum; ut te docere potest 1326 is quem summu  1327 nominas philosopho theologum. Ciceronis dicto,  1328 cadit in virum bonum mentiri emolumenti sui causa? nihil minus: opponis alia eius tanquam repugnantia, quae minime repugnant, ut  1329 de Socrate simulatore, dissimulatore Q. Maximo. Nam Socratis ironia, quemadmodum ab  1330 eo tractatur in facetiis, & 1331 Quintilianus docet in figuris, non fuit mendax sermo, sed  1332 figurate verax. Quinti autem Maximi disssimulatio celautis erat, &tacentis, ut Cicero exponit: quam nos  1333 laudandam ducimus. Canonici iuris professores ex me sciscitaris utrum nominem, an rideam: qui, Iacobum a mendacio immunem divinae obtentu concessionis pronuntiatum, in titulo de divortiis legerim. Ego sane serio illos nominavi: a 1334 quibus tradi video magno consensu, ne pro vita quidem hominis servanda mentiri fas esse. Tu per iocum forsitan id de Iacobo citas e titulo de divortiis: nisi furtum, homicidium, adulterium officiosum, aeque ac mendacium, iis probari velis. Namque, ut Iacob  1335 illic, a mendacio: sic Israelitae, a furto; Samson, ab homicidio; Patriarchae, & alii viri iusti, ab adulterio excusari dicuntur. Plures autores eiusdem sententiae contra te producere magis proclive est quam necessarium. Quor enim censes extitisse similes illius apud  1336 Iuvenalem, qui mendacium, quod videri posset officiosissimum, inhonestum &a viri boni officio alienum reputans, in haec erumpit verba: Quid Romae faciam? mentiri nescio: libru, Si malus est, nequeo laudare, &poscere. Atque haud scio an medicorum exempla, melancholicos scilicet mendaciis curantiu, aeque falso 1337 cites in tuam sententiam, ac Q. Maximi. Certe curationes tales quales iudicas, a 1338 magno medico notatae, in factis positae, non in dictis carent signorum abusu: quem  1339 nos in mendacio, uti scis, damnamus. Verum, cum habeas poetas, philosophos. Canonistas, theologos, ac plerosque horum te ipso cofitente, tibi repugnantes: ignosce mihi si Neronis cote ad majorem medestiam &cautionem te acuere volui; ne errati hujus toties admonitus, rursum non modo medicos, sed etiam alios omnes, mendacii,  1340 rei turpissimae, patrocinio inquinares. Quod eo magis opus fuisse ut facerem jam sentio &cerno, quia, quae mihi maxime omnium capitalis sententia videbatur, nempe, abusum malorum non esse malum, sed bonum: eam tu significas te in libris bellicis denuo defensurum; &ita defensurum, ut ab argutiolae, quam dixi, opprobrio distinctionem tuam vindices Augustini &Lactantii autoritate. Quid igitur? An argumentum meum, quo stuprum, adulterium, incestum, &quodvis facinus ac flagitium ea argutiola defendi posse docui, Augustini etiam atque Lactantii autoritate profligabis? Omnino, tanquam aliquid tale cogitares, postquam ex corum altero notasses, bonum in nuptus esse usum mali concupiscentiae carnis; ex altero, vitia non esse quibus recte uti licet: Sic, inquis, uti possumus concupiscentia carnis; sic mendacio; &c. Vbi, si particula ista, &c. non referatur ad incestum, &caetera mala a me commemorata; quod (opinor) abominabere; quanquam quae ad alia referatut, non video; sed siad ea non referatur: argumentum igitur meum ab exemplo Antiochi &novercae, ita solidum &firmum, ut ne attingere quidem illud ausus sis, satis adhuc habet ad mei dicti veritatem de vanitate argutiolae tuae comprobandam. Veruntamen, ut idem Augustini quoque, testis a te ipso &pro te citati, autoritate corroborari scias: lege doctissimam gravissimamque  1341 eius disputationem, qua tanquam ex professo tuam de malorum abusu (quem vocas) sententiam refelleus, quum ex ea consequens esse demonstrasset, nec falsum testimonium, nec furtum, nec adulterium, nec ullum malum opus malum fore, sed bonum, si bona intentione, bono fine, perpetretur; Quis ista dicat, inquit, nisi qui res humanas omnesque conatur mores legesq subvertere? Clarissimum documentu quam iniuriose, ne quid dicam gravius, &Patrum testimonia &Scripturas tractes. Nam  1342 Augustinus ait eos concupiscentiae malo bene uti qui licite procreandis liberis operam dant,  1343 ut pede vitiato recte quis utitur quum ad aliquod bonum claudicando pervenit: nec propter claudicationis malum mala est illa perventio, nec propter illius perventionis bonum bona est claudicatio. Tu bonum esse mali usum sic contendis, ut malum mendacii, ceu claudicationis, malum esse neges, quum eo quis ad bonu pervenit; &eum, cui Deus pedes dedit integros, se mutilare iubes, ut aliquo accedat quo nulli nisi claudo fortasse datur aditus.  1344 Lactantius, ad errorem quorundam minuendum qui affectus vitia esse concedunt, sed ea mediocriter temperant: assignandi, inquit, fuerunt affectus certis temporibus, &rebus, &locis: ne vitia sint quibus recte uti licet. Tu vocabulum eius, recte, ad omnes circumstantias relatum, de quibus  1345 Aristoteles quum distinguit iusta ab iis quae iuste fiunt, &virtutis naturam aperit, ad unicam restringis: &mendacia in rectum finem destinata, (quo modo possunt periuria, sacrilegia, blasphemiae,) recte fieri dicis, eoque non esse vitia.  1346 Apostolus ait non facienda mala ut eveniant bona: concedens posse bona intentione fieri quae tamen mala sint, ut  1347 Saul exemplo suo docuit. Tu mala esse negas quae fiunt ut eveniant bona: eum enim esse abusum malorum; &abusum malorum malum non esse, at bonum. Ac lectorem mones te in tota  1348 illa disputatione non dicere ullibi, mala facienda, ut bona adveniant: in qua tamen laudas istam poetae antiqui sententiam, Quum vitia prosunt, peccat qui recte facit. Haec si fundameta non sint nequitiae & impietatis; si te, quem fidei causa exulare ferunt, atque, ut respondes, vere ferunt, deceant; si ecclesiae lumini rite dedicentur, ut illius quasi luce lucentia acceptiora sint in vulgus; denique si nihil contineant veneni, quin pueris haurienda propinari possint: errarim ego qui immerito, te, ne talibus, talia, sub talis viri nomine deinceps commendes &excudas typis in Academia nostra, rogandum mili censui.  1349 Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri. Sed noli asserere me calumniari in eo quod pueros a te doceri dixi ut de rebus morum quid theologi sentiant non magnopere curent. Immo vero, inquis, de me, de jurisconsulto scripsi, &re politica. De te? de jurisconsulto? Atqui, &Petrus, quum  1350 subduxit sese ac separavit a Gentibus, respondere potuit se respectu sui, Iudaei, id fecisse: cui tamen Paulus dixit, Cur Gentes cogis Iudaizare? quod iis exemplo suo hac in re praeiret; ut tu, nec solum exemplo, sed etiam verbo, pueris. De politica autem re, quid tibi vis? aut qui hoc ausus dicere? cum 1351 verba tua typis excusa sic habeant; Ego ut theologorum autoritate in re religionis valde moveor, ita in re morali, aut politica non valde: Adeone mei reprehendendi aestu te transversum abripi, ut in eo mihi notam calumniae, in quo calumniaris ipse, inuras? Locum scripturae de veste viri a foemina, foeminae a viro non induenda, quem theologi omnes interpretantur proprie, figurate, a te exponi mirabar eo magis: quod theologorum autoritate in rebus religionis te valde moveri dixeras; &scripturarum interpretatio res est religionis. Hic tu scripturarum interpretationem omnem, aut omnium, rem religionis esse inficiaris. Omnem, quorsum addis? Nam ne legum quidem interpretatio omnis res est jurisprudentiae: sed ea, cuius gratia,  1352 scribis Canonistas, maiorum nostroru tempore, ad Legistas remisisse auditores suos, si incideret argumentum ex legibus componendum. Et talis est quam nos quaerimus: non qualem adhibeant qui a te ridentur, quod nunc, benigniori scilicet coelo nati, non modo utriusque iuris doctores existunt, sed &Medicinae periti, &Theologiae. Quum autem is inficias Scripturarum omnium interpretationem rem esse religionis, &ad facultatem theologicam spectare: perinde mihi loqui videris, acsi quis diceret, non omnes leges vestras &totum ius civile ab Accursianis aut Alceiateis interpretibus exponi oportere. Sed, ut hoc absurdum tibi visum iri dialogi tui docent: ita &illud debuit. Quod, si mihi non credis, crede  1353 Petro Martyri, quem theologorum maximum  1354 appellas: &ab  1355 eo disce facultatem nostra a vestra distinguere. Ac vide quam scienter huic scripturae loco, cuius exponendi ius, abiudicatum nobis, tibi vindicas, sensum figuratum &improprium affingas.  1356 Ne esto instrumentum virile super foeminam, inquit Moses, neque induito vir vestem foeminae: nam abominationi est Iehovae Deo tuo quisquis facit ista. Hac lege, Ne induito vir vestem foeminae, tu, per nescio quam figuram orationis, vis nefarium illud scelus denotari, quod Moses  1357 alibi verbis proprie sumptis damnans abominationem vocavit: &, sicut in Levitico, verbo  1358 retectionis quasi vestimentorum significantur talia flagitia; ita in lege hac, simili loquendi modo, par crimen proponi. Satis id quidem duriter, ut idem plane sonet induere vestem, ac retegere: &hoccine est quod ais expositionem tuam similibus locis stabiliri? Verum exponendam ita esse legem confirmas hunc in modum. Vbi significatio propria non accipitur, ibi figurata fuerit, vel aliter impropria. At in lege illa Dei non accipitur propria significatio. Quid ita? Quoniam, inquis, Vbi abominatio dicitur in scripturis, ibi peccatum significatur, quod facile superet flagitia pleraque omnia. Sed hoc vestimentorum non est tale. Ergo ubi dicitur abominatio, ibi hoc peccatum non significatur. Ac non esse tale hoc vestimentoru, affirmari ais ex sententia 1359 Augustini. Quem, si consideratius animum attendisses ad inexcusabiles in quas ait decidi posse turpitudines hac lege negligenda: vidisses minus causae subesse, quam putabas, cur pro te citares. Sed unde tandem colligis, ubicunq;, id enim sonat tuum ubi, aut nihil agis; ubicunque igitur abominatio in scripturis dicitur, ibi significari peccatum quod facile flagitia pleraque omnia superet? Nam  1360 abominationi Iehovae esse dicitur argentum &aurum, de quo idola facta sint: &quicunque infert illum in domum suam, rem inferre dicitur abominabilem.  1361 Abominationi Iehovae esse dicitur bovis aut pecudis ullum habentis vitium immolatio. De quibus, si volueris tibi constare, &sententiam ei quam de  1362 nostra lege  1363 tulisti, ferre similem, rogabis mirabundus: Quod tantum scelus hic est, ut sit abominatio, si, cui desunt opes, aliquid e Baalis auro aut argento in usum suum accipiat? si, qui meliorem victimam non habet, claudam, aut caecam Deo offerat? Quod si prudentius & religiosius dices haec merito pro flagitiosissimis habita fuisse, quod insignis sceleris, id est, impietatis, aut occasiones erant, aut indicia: idem tibi puta responsum de muliebri vestitu in viro, abominandi sceleris illecebra &fomite, ut e Neronis Sporo &Heliogabalo  1364 amicum tuum monui. Relinquitur idcirco sensum legis proprium, non figuratum esse: ut omnes theologi, non ut tu exponis. Quod tuo quoque ipsius aliud agentis dicto comprobatur, dum ais, qui sensus bonarum aliarum legum est prohibentium hunc usum vestium, eundem verisimiliter esse &legis Dei. Nam aliae bonae leges  1365 Canonicae,  1366 Civilesque, a teipso notatae, loquuntur de vestitu non figurate, sed proprie, ut scis &confiteris. Legem autem illam Dei nihil facere adversus histrioniam, quod fidentius aequo a te dictum censui, conaris astruere duobus argumentis. Quorum alterum superiore nixum fundamento, vitiose adiicit, sensum aliarum bonarum legum nihil facere contra histrioniam; ergo neque bonae illius legis Dei. Nam primo lex canonica, a 1367 multo ampliore synodo sancita, quam  1368 quae a te notatur, vetat in ludicris eum usum vestium, ut  1369 alibi declaravi. Civili vero jure idem interdictum existimasse videtur  1370 Augustinus, ad histriones accommodans quod jure infames &intestabiles haberi, qui muliebri habitu se ostentant, dixerat. Atque adeo 1371 Tatiani verba reprehendentis vestem muliebrem in scenicis actoribus, ut indignam viro,  1372 Cujacius arbitratus est cum vestrorum jurisconsultorum sensu congruere, &post Cuiacium  1373 Gothofredus. Deinde, etiamsi aliae bonae leges diuturniorem &graviorem abusum tantummodo vetarent, quem  1374 ne lege quidem coerceri voluit Tiberius Imperator: tamen lege Dei, multo meliore, notari possent &coargui, qui levius, quomodocunque, &quantulocunque tempore, in ea re delinquerent. Nam  1375 aliae bonae leges negant furtum animo posse committi, sine contrectatione: 1376 lex Dei vel affectu solo flagitia perpetrari asserit. Itaque errarunt  1377 Iosephus & 1378 Dauid Kimhi, post  1379 Scribas &Pharisaeos, quimalos animi motus &cogitationes peccata non putarunt, nisi in opus exeant: quod de legibus hominum, non Dei, si dixissent, nequaquam lapsi essent. Ac ipse verisimiliter tantum, non certo eundem legis Dei atque aliarum sensum esse ais. Quamobrem adhuc salva est assertio mea, consultius te facturum fuisse, si modestius, de re quam opinaris, non feis, pronuntiasses. At altero argumento iugulasti hominem. Nam quae in histrionia (inquis) vitari peccata negotio nullo saepe solent, &possunt semper: ea nihil contra histrioniam faciunt. Sed peccatum illud, si quod est, promiscui vestimentorum usus, vitari saepe solet, & semper potest. Ergo. Quid Ergo? Cur reliquum non attexis, Ergo nihil facit lex illa Dei adversus histrioniam? Hoc enim erat concludendum. Ac utinam, quod assumis vetari saepe solere promiscuum usum vestium, eius rei testis fuisset nostra scena: viamque meliore, qua vitari semper possit, ostedisses, quam mimas &scenicas inter histriones introducendo:quod dedecus foeminei pudoris ac verecudiaepeius esset paene remediu ipso malo. Sed cuiusmodi syllogismo causam tua fulcias, agnosce ex consimili, ad aliam Dei legem,  1380 nequis liberos suos idolis sacrificet. Quae in idololatria vitari peccata negotio nullo saepe solent, & possunt semper: ea nihil faciunt contra idololatriam. Sed peccatum illud comburendorum filiorum &filiarum, vitari saepe solet, & semper potest. Ergo nihil facit lex illa Dei adversus idololatriam. Propositiogermana est & gemina tuae: non lac similius lacti. Assumptio, luce clarior e varia Papistarum idololatria. Conclusio tamen falsa videtur omnibus theologis: quorum hac in causa, ad primam legis tabulam spectante, autoritas, per  1381 Prophetas saltem, assensum tuum impetrabit. Quapropter, cum ex veris nil nisi verum consequatur, restat falsam esse propositione: & posse peccatum in idololatriam hanc aut illam cadere, quod in omne tamen idololatriae genus non cadat. Ego quidem certe hoc iudicio fui, quum ob latriam imaginibus Christi & crucis delatam, Papistas arguere idololatriae. Nam ipsi saepe solent idololatriam committere, & semper possunt, absque imaginum cultu. Et tu, qui histriones mimas habere & scenicas scripsisti, videris aliquatenus idem sensisse. Cur enim non aeque putemas histrioniam, etsi non omnem histrioniam, perstrictam a 1382 Tertulliano mimas notante: ac tu asseruisti histriones mimas habere & scenicas, etsi non omnes histriones habeant? Sed quia iam hoc tibi discrimen ita displicet, ut me confidentissime reprehendere, quae non capio, propterea affirmes: docebis nos fortasse, exemplum  1383 Ezckiae, serpentem aeneum confringentis quod filii Israelis incensum ei adolerent, nihil facere contra Pontificiorum,  1384 qui incensum adolent rebus similibus, idololatriam; quoniam est quaedam idololatria, puta, liberos suos idolis immolantium, quae hoc peccato vacet. Quin & 1385 Ieremiam, istud Iudaeorum peccatum in Baale colendo increpantem, nihil adversus idololatriam corum dixisse: quoniam Papistae,  1386 invocantes ligneam crucem ut Deum, & 1387 sacrameto cultum latriae exhibentes, committunt idololatriam, nec tamen suos cremant liberos. An quaestuariorum item histrionum, quorum contagio & lues apud nos nuper est grassata, negabis actiones histrioniae nomine traduci oportere, quoniam exerceri potest histrionia, ut  1388 tandem a Roscio, sine quaestu? Luculenter vero probasti scholasticos, a quibus apud nos fabulae aguntur, nullam labem contrahere, tametsi contra legem muliebribus vestiantur, ut loquitur  1389 Tertullianus: quoniam ostendisti posse foeminarum partes a mimis, scenicisque foeminis, sine viris, agi. Perinde quasi dixisses nullam labem contrahi ab 1390 immorantibus apud vinum, nec iis  1391 ebrietatem merito exprobrari; quoniam esse potest  1392 ebrietas sine vino. Atque hoc modo rationem illam, quam Tertullianus obtrudere videtur pro potentissima, nihili esse demonstrasti. Porro, minus nihilo esse quicquid aliud adversus histrionia afferunt theologi, quod mihi minus item modeste visus es asserere, tu contra rursum asseris: &demonstras etiam, opinor; sed quemadmodum? Pudet me, inquis, earum rationu quas Tertullianus affert adversus cothurnos tragicos & fictas scenicorum personas. Age. Sint  1393 eius rationes leves contra histrionicum istum ornatum: rem adeo putida &insulsam, ut nullas rationes ad eam explodendam desiderarint nostri, sed sua sponte rejecerint. Etenim cothurnis (cuiusmodicunque demum id genus fuit calceoru) efferebatur tragoedi quo altiores apparerent; & fictis ad eorum, quos agebant, speciem personis tegebatur: ut  1394 Sarmenti scurrae jocus in Messium docet; quem immani corporis proceritate, &foeda cicatrice in facie deformem, rogabat Sarmentus ut Polyphemum ageret; Nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis. E nostris autem nemo in scenam cothurnatus & larvatus prodit. Quid igitur? An quia te pudet rationem quas Tertullianus affert adversus ineptias histrionicas, quarum tragoedos & scenicos nostros pudet: idcirco minus nihilo est quicquid aliud adversus histrioniam Tertullianus affert? Ac, ut Tertullianus, unus e multis, hallucinatus sit: idcirco minus nihilo est quicquid aliud adversus histrioniam afferunt theologi? Quanto te magis pudere debuit conviciorum, quae in me effundis; quia; ut modestiam in pronuntiando maiorem adhiberes, praesertim quum de rebus religionis agis, amice te admonui? Sed praeclare 1395 Cato: Nae simul pudere, quod no oportet, caeperit; quod oportet, non pudebit.. Me namque ex Papistico spiritu a librorum sacrorum tractatione te arcere ais: &haec cis annos istos septuaginta, quod Erastus ait similibus mei, tentare: &imperiose cum eo sic agere, qui Papae imperium contempsit, &exulare patria potuit, &universo regno Papali: atque adeo, etiamsi in his a te vincar, obiurgare tamen te pro pietate: denique argumentis uti eiusmodi, quibus illudere pueris possim, vobis non possim. Bene factum, quod te ipsum longe a Papismo abesse profiteris. Nam ego multo minus te arceo a sacrorum librorum tractatione, quam tu jurisconsultum, cui  1396 praecipis, ut nihil nisi ex Theologi praescripto enuntiet de re Theologica; & folis prudentiae civilis libris vacet, reliquis omnibus valedicat.  1397 Erastus, notans quosdam quos ait petivisse ut alii professores iuberentur a Theologorum schola abstinere; Si hoc fuisset, inquit, ante sexaginta annos petitum, tolerabile videri poterar. Ego, ex animo tibi exoptans ut scholam Theologorum magis frequentes, adhortor tantum ut memineris, quod ante mille annos  1398 Gregorius Nazianzenus observandum tradidit, idque ex  1399 Apostolo, non omnia Christi membra iisdem facultatibus, & donis esse praedita. Imperiose autem quid a me factum? Nisi ut  1400 arguere cum omni imperio ministros Dei decet. Neque putaram idcirco non licere mihi te arguere, quod in nonnullis rebus me anteas. Nam David item praestitit Nathani, Petrus Paulo:  1401 Davidem tamen Nathan, & 1402 Petrum Paulus reprehendit. Obiurgandi verbum haud scio an asperius sit, quam mea meruit admonitio. Quanquam obiurgandos etiam amicos, non monendos solum, autor est  1403 Cicero: & ego te amicum meum opina condona mihi hunc errorem. Argumenta vero mea qualia sint, utrum ad falsum, an verum; malum, an bonum; cum viris, tum pueris persuadendum facta: iudicium penes arbitros aequiores esto. A quibus animadverti & expendi velim epiphonema tuum, post tua argumenta (quae nostris, uti spero, ne pueris quidem illudent) his subtextum verbis: Vtinam, utinam sic contenderes, & non reiiceres argumentis bonis fabulas non bonas semper. Ecce, argumenta mea esse bona confiteris ipse, accusator meus; & tua, e contrario, mala. Nimirum lingua lapso (ut est in  1404 Graecorum proverbio) verum dicit. Postremo, quia  1405 verba edicti Praetoris, sic a te exposita, ac si unius tantum rei, nempe artis ludicrae, non duarum, id est artis ludicrae, pronuntiandine, disjuncte, mentionem facerent, nimis sicco pede te dixi transiisse: quaeris, an ego in sicco sim, qui hoc dixerim. In sicco sane adhuc: &aqua tibi haeret, qua, ne in sicco essem, conatus es me inundare. Nam ad testimonium Alciati, a te citatum, artem non facere eum qui semel, iterum, quid artis facit; respondi, ut concedatur hoc quod illi tribuis, pronuntiandi tamen causa in scenam prodire qui prodit semel tantum: ac propterea 1406 Laberium, quo primum die prodiit inustam sibi notam infamiae censuisse; &probrosum visum Romanis (apud  1407 Tacitum) vel orationes, vel carmina ita recitare, licet id gratis facerent. Cuius responsionis ut partes, tuo more, quascunque potes carpas, negas te tribuere illud Alciato: haberi enim apud  1408 eum, quamvis in  1409 subnotato capite sit erratum. Ergone tribuere duntaxat ii dicendi sunt qui falso tribuunt: non item qui vere? Profecto tu non  1410 tribuis suum cuique, qui tribuendi verbo significationem istam solam tribuis. Ego vero, quia capite a te subnotato illud non reperi, & posse tamen alibi extare cogitavi: verbo tribuendi de industria usus sum, ut vacarem culpa, seu vere citasses, seu falso. Quanquam iam ex tui errati correctione falso citatum esse deprehendo: teque interpolasse locum Alciati inserta voce, Iterum; cum ille tantum dixerit, 1411 Qui semel quid artis facit. Et quorsum (narra mihi) adjecisti hoc, sterum? An quia te videbas non satis probaturum nullam a ludionibus nostris labem contrahi, si eos tantummodo artis faciendae nota liberares, qui semel quid artis facerent? Quin igitur Alciatum scripsisti affirmare, artem non facere eum qui semel, iterum, tertio, quid artis facit? Nam potuisti eodem iure: & hoc, ad assequendum quod volebas, parum est. At cos saltem qui semel prodeunt, non amplius, immunes esse notae, docuisse te ais ex Alciato, sic argumentando: Ars notata est edicto; Sed una proditio non est ars; Ergo una proditio non est notata. At haec argumentatio vide ne similiter statuminetur, ac si quis ita disputaret: Faemina continetur appellatione hominis; Sed masculus non est foemina; Ergo masculus non continetur appellatione hominis. Nam, ut  1412 foemina quidem appellatione hominis continetur, sed non tantum foemina: ita ars notata est edicto Praetoris, sed non tantum ars. Qued animadvertendum tibi proposui, quam planissime potui in tanta brevitate, ex Praetoris verbis, pronuntiandive causa, cum eo comparatis quod e Tacito citaras, de orationibus carminibusque in scena recitatis. Et, quoniam non distinguit Tacitus mercenarios recitatores a gratuitis, propterea probrosum Romae visum dixi tametsi gratis recitarent: ut tu, qui Praetorem nullos vis notasse nisi quaestuarios, iudicum Romanorum hac in parte etiam a tua commentatione dissidere attenderes. Tu contra affirmas persuasum esse tibi incubuisse illos, de quibus Tacitus loquitur, recitationibus, pretii aut praemii spe atque fiducia: itaque falsum me colligere, qui notatos dicam tametsi gratis recitarent. Nae tu non sine causa syllogismalem (quam  1413 appellas) altercationem a iurisprudentia tua reiecisti, si ea ratione hoc potes lucrifacere ut talia enthymemata, Persuasum est mihi te colligere falsum, Itaque falsum colligis, vim idonearum probationum habeant. Sed quicquid tibi sit persuasum, historia testatur eiusmodi recitatorum, quales ii notabant quorum verba refert Tacitus, nonnullos extitisse qui recitarent gratis: atque hos corum iudicio notatos, a quibus notabantur quicunque in scena recitarent. Tales enim erant & 1414 orationum & carminum recitatores, quorum nemo voluit  1415 coronam accipere, licet de ca contendissent. Talis erat  1416 carminum recitator Nero: quem  1417 mercede quicquam facere dedignatum affirmat, qui  1418 hoc narrat,  1419 Dio. Quid, quod ipse addis visum etiam crimen maiestatis laesae, secundum antiquos Romanorum mores, si magistratus pro concione legisset vel codices (ni male meministi) eorum quae ad magistratus spectabant tamen. Dissimile hoc quidem: &memoriae tuae lapsui fortassis ex parte tribuendum. Nec enim maiestatis laesae accusatus est  1420 tribunus plebis, quod pro cocione codicem legisset; tanqua hoc perindo turpe, immo turpius multo, habitum esset, quam orationes aut carmina in scena recitare: sed quod, adversus intercessionem sui collegae, codicem, quem scriba legere prohibitus est, legisset ipse, itaque violasset legem Corneliam maiestatis. Caeterum, si antiquis Romanorum moribus tanti criminis reum fuisse magistratum, qui vel codices rerum, ad magistratus spectantium pro concione legisset, persuasum habes: fierine potest ut persuasum habeas non iisdem moribus probrosam Romae visam vel gratuitam carminum orationumve in scena recitationem? Nisi forte dices te existimare magistratus eos tantummodo maiestatis crimen admisisse, qui mercedis gratia codicem legerent pro concione Quod mihi persuaderi prorsus non potest persuasum tibi esse. Ita postulanti tibi ut eorum, quae inficiaris, quaedam, si possem, docerem & ostenderem; non in illis solum, sed etiam in caeteris hoc gratificari studui, ut potui. Maturius id facturus, nisi tu, omissa librorum & capitum, in quibus Augustini & aliorum quos citas verba scripta sint, indicatione, coegisses me tempus terere perlegendis nonnullis libris integris, quo loca, quibus certo innixus videreris, explorate cognita compertaque haberem. Auxit meam huius officii praestandi cupiditatem & desiderium tua sententia, sententiam non dissimilem  1421 gravioris autoris in memoriam revocans, ad tanta crimina patientem esse non oportere. Quare, quod mihi obiicis concludens, te a me tractari pessime, immerito, hominem mei studiosissimum; crimen gravissimum omnium, siverum, non modo in amore non respondere, sed etiam malefactis benevoletiam rependere: id immerito mihi a te obiectum esse, tua ipsius voce convinco, & concludo. Nam, quum per epistolam olim me moneres corum quae putabas perperam asserta in meis praelectionibus ad primum Maccabaeorum, his verbis usus es: Æqui bonique haec consules? Certe ea ipsa sunt, quae ego in donis amicorum pretiosissima ducerem; & utinam mihi aliquis contigisset aliquando, qui in meis scriptis praestare tantum voluisset. Vides ne ut ipse te a me non pessime, sed optime tractatum; neque iniuriis affectum, sed donis; & iis non vulgaribus, sed longe pretiosissimis, carissimis, optatissimis, esse fatearis? Quod si plus aloes quam mellis medicamentis meis admiscui, vel cum acrimonia potius maiore tanquam ad secandum &urendum accessi: tamen hoc quoque a 1422 prudente morum magistro scis probari, quum nulla reperitur alia medicina. Ac ego, medicinam aliam saepiuscule in te expertus frustra, hanc unam superesse salutarem duxi; alioqui desperandum. Praesertim cum rursus in pristinum de mendacio male officioso morbum recidisses: idque ita graviter & periculose, ut novo typis excuso opere defenderes, quod in vetere (liberamne amici vocem feres?) pessime affirmaras. Quantum mutatus ab illo, qui mihi esse videbare, quum in epistola quadam hac de re scripta concluderes hoc modo:" In controversia hac sustinere, quantum ad theologos pertinet, deinceps assensionem, in animo est. tibi scilicer, ut debeo, plurimum tribuo, qui me in contrariam vocas sententiam: & cum Tertulliano tandem malim sapere in Scripturis sanctis minus, quam contra.] Atque in alia, ad meam precationem, Qui Petrum erexit ut agnosceret peccatum quum mendacio officioso negasset se noviile Christum, te, ut ipsum recte fecisse sentias, excitet, neque tibi verbis defendendum putes quod piis factis improbaris; respondisti his verbis: Ecce, in fine versor tuarum literarum, nec tuam admonitionem, nec precationem tuam (mihi crede) sine ingenti affectu animi lego; dixerim nec sine lacrymis, certe cordis: Deus me dirigat in viam suam, &ab omni errore sartu tectumq; servet, eo maxime, qui animam spectat, & veram pietatem infuscat.] Et qua ego tande, te, qui aliquando hoc animo fuisti, oratione compellem, nisi qua ecclesiae Ephesinae angelum compellavit Christus?  1423 Memor esto unde excideris, & resipisce, & priora opera facito. Vale. Aug. 5. FINIS.
