 of your Majesties view, much lesse able to adde any thing to your Royall Uertues; Rivers adde nothing to the Maine, yet thither they naturally send the Tribute of their Streames; and if my Loyaltie teach me to doe the like, it will not (J hope) be conceived as done out of an opinion of Merit, but onely out of a desire to discharge the Duty of a Subject to your Majestie . And I am the rather imboldned to this Confidence, because J have formerly adventured the like, when to your Princely View, being then the Second Hope of this Kingdome, I (about eleven yeares since) presented a Translation of a Worke of Monsieur de Refuges , intituled A Treatise of the Court ; the Gratious and Undeserved Acceptance whereof, if it hath inspired me with farther Courage, to present You (now advanced to a greater State) with a greater Jncrease of mine owne Labour, your Majestie will not (J hope) condemne me of groundlesse Presumption. The former three Bookes had the Honour and Happinesse to bee perused by the Judicious Eye of King Iames , your Renowned Father, (of happy Memory) In whose incomparable Judgement they failed not of Approbation, though Dedicated to Inferiour Names; the more am J now incouraged to Inscribe and Intitle the whole Sixe to your Sacred Majesty , as being no lesse Heire of His Uertues, then of His Crowne and Dignitie. And one thing more (arising from the Consideration of the Subject it selfe) made me thinke it a Present not altogether unworthy of your Regall Estate; for the Contents of it being the Execution of Iustice , upon the unnaturall Sinne of Murther , where can it bee more fitly addressed, then to the Great Patron of Iustice among us (God's immediate Vicegerent) by whose Sword (as the Minister of Heaven) such odious Crimes are to bee chastised, and Innocent Bloud justly expiated with Guilty. And it may more fitly sute with your Majesty , who as you excell in the carefull Administration of Iustice upon all Offenders, so especially upon those (most hainous of all others) the Violaters of Gods sacred Image, in the perpetration of wilfull Murther , towards whom Clemencie even changeth her nature, and becomes Cruelty to the Weal-publicke . Never had any Land lesse cause to complaine of too much Indulgencie this way, then ours, as may well appeare, both by the rarenesse of such Occurrences in your Kingdome, and the severe vindication of them, whensoever they happen, or by whom, or howsoever performed. These Histories therefore, which may serve as a Looking-glasse to all Nations, shall to these of Yours be a speciall Ornament and Mirrour of their felicity, and set forth and publish Your Praise, in the peaceable and quiet Government of your People, whose Climate (seldome or never) affords such Tragedies ; nor will doe, whiles Your Christian resolution shall continue to prevent them in the Spring, and to punish the lighter degrees of Bloudinesse with due retaliation. The great Author of Iustice (who is Goodnesse and Iustice it selfe) long preserve your Majesty to Vs, and the Happinesse Wee enjoy in your Sacred Person, so neere resembling Him whose Authority and Image You beare. So prayeth Your Majesties most humbly devoted in all Dutifull Allegiance, last and worst dayes of the world, in which the crying and scarlet sinne of Murther makes so ample, and so bloody a progression: for we can now scarce turne our eare or eye any where, but wee shall be enforced, either to heare with pitty the mournefull effects, or to see with griefe the lamentable Tragedies thereof: as if we now so much degenerated from our selves, of our hearts from our soules, to thinke that  a 1 Christ were no longer our Shepheard: b 2 or we the sheepe of his Pasture: or as if we were become such wretched and execrable Atheists, to beleeve  c 3 There were no Heaven, to reward the Righteous: or Hell, to punish the ungodly . But if we will divert our hearts from Earth to Heaven, and raise and erect our soules from Satan to God, we shall then not onely see what engendereth this Diabolicall passion in us, but also find the meanes to detest and roote it out from amongst us. To which end it is requisite, wee first consider, that our enemies, who oppose our tranquillity in this life, and our felicity in that to come, are neither so few in number, nor so weake in power, that we should thinke our selves able to vanquish, ere we fight with them: for wee have to encounter with the bewitching World, the alluring Flesh, and the inticing Devill: not with three simple Souldiers or poore Pigmies, but with three valiant and puissant Chief- taines, subtill to incampe dangerous to assaile, and powerfull to fight. The World, that it may bewitch us to its will, assailes us with Wealth, Riches, Dignities, Honours, Preferments, Sumptuous houses, perfumed Beds, Vessels of gold and silver, Pompous Apparell, Delicious fare, variety of sweet Musick, Dancing, Maske; and Stage-playes, delicate Horses, rich Coaches, and infinite Attendants, with a thousand other inticements and allurements. The Flesh presents us with Youth, Beauty. The d 4 lust of the eye, and the pride of life: with e 5 inordinate affection and lascivious desires , with a piercing eye, a vermillion cheeke, golden haire, and a slender waste: and although it discover us not all these perfections of nature in one personage: yet, he shewes us most of them in divers, and then if any thing want to captivate our affections, wee shall heare them marry their Syren voices, to their owne Lutes and Vialls, or their dancing feete to those of others: or if this will not suffice, then Perfuming, Powdering, Crisping, Painting, Amorous kisses, Sweet smiles, Suggered speeches, Wanton embracings, and Lascivious dalliance, will uudertake to play a World in love. On the other side, Strength, Nimblenesse, Agility of body, Sloth, Luxurie, Gluttonie, Intemperancie, Drunkennesse, Voluptuousnesse and Sensuality will cast us out so faire (I meane so treacherous) a lure, as if we stoope thereto, we shall buy our pleasure with repentance, and our delight therein, will prove our ruine and destruction. And now, if neither the World, nor the flesh can intangle, or insnare our hearts, Then comes the Devill f 6 that roaring Lyon, who walkes about, seeking whom he may devoure, that mortall enemy, and g 7 Arch-traytor to our soules, that h 8 Prince of darkenesse , whose subtilty is the more dangerous, and malice the more fatall, in that he transformes himselfe into an i 9 Angell of light, thereby to make us heires and slaves of his obscure kingdome: yea, he will proffer us more, then either our tongues can demand, or our hearts desire: for all the pompe, treasure and pleasures of the World, yea, all that is in the World, and  k 10 the world it selfe, hee will prostrate and give us, if we will consent to obey him, and promise to fall downe and adore him; and for a pledge of his infernall bounty and liberality, hee will puffe us up with Pride, Arrogancie, Ambition, Vaine-glory, Ostentation, Disdaine, Covetousnesse, Singularitie, Affectation, Confidence, Security; and if all these allurements will not prevaile to subdue us, hee hath yet reserved Troopes and Forces, and another string to his Bow: for then exchanging his smiles into frownes, and his calmes to stormes, hee will give us Pensivenesse, Griefe of mind and body, Affliction, Sorrow, Discontent, Choler, Envie, Indignation, Despaire, Revenge, and the like. Yea, he will watch us at every turne, and waite on us at every occasion: for are we bent to revenge, hee will blow the coales to our choler: are wee given to sorrow and discontent, hee will thrust and hale us on to Despaire: are wee inclined to Wantonnesse, and Lasciviousnesse, he will fit us with meanes and opportunity to accomplish our carnall desires: or are wee addicted to covetousnesse and honours, hee will either cause us to breake our hearts, or our necks, to obtaine it: for it is indifferent to him, either how or in what manner we inlarge and fill up the empty roomes of his vast and infernall kingdome. Thus wee see how powerfull our three capitall enemies are, yea, what a cloud, nay, what a world of subordinate meanes and instruments they have, not onely to insnare, but to destroy us. yea, not onely to conquer our hearts, but which is worse, to make ship-wracke of our soules? And from hence comes our misery: yea, from these three fatall trees we gather the bitter fruit of our perdition. But against all these temptations and dangers, against all these our professed enemies in generall, and each of them in particular: We may swimme in the Ocean of the world without drowning, and pilgrimage upon the face of the earth without terrour or destruction, if we will consider, and in considering remember that l 11 God is our Creator ,  m 12 Christ our Saviour, and the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier and Comforter: that wee are honoured with the resemblance of God, whose stampe and character we beare, and inriched with immortall and  o 13 living soules: which sacred priviledges and divine prerogatives lift us up by many degrees of excellencie p 14 above the rest of all his creatures, whom hee hath made for our service, and q 15 we onely to serve and glorifie him: That he hath made the world for a thorowfare, and us as Passengers: That r 16 we have no abiding Citie here, but must seeke one in the World to come: That the World is ours but for a season, and Heaven our patrimony and inheritance forever: That the pompe and pleasures thereof are but transitory and temporary, and that the vanity thereof passeth away as dust or s 17 smoake before the wind, whereas those of Heaven are both immortall and eternall: That t 18 our flesh is but like flowers that fade, and grasse that withereth , but a masse of corruption, a tabernacle of clay, and a coffin of dust and ashes: that the best of its beauty is but  u 19 vanity and deformity, and the end of its bravery, but rottennesse and putrifaction: If I say, wee spurne at the vanity of the world, contemne the pleasures of the flesh, and scoffe at the temptations of Sathan, using the first, as if we vsed it not, making the second the Temple of the Holy Ghost, and not the members of a harlot , and that we are so farre from fearing, as we defie the third  x 20 Setting our affections on things that are above, and not on things of the earth: for if we will be heires of the Church triumphant, wee must bee first souldiers of the Militant, and so following the advice and direction of the Apostle, stand against all these our enemies,  y 21 Having the whole spirituall Armour girt about us, as the girdle of Truth, the Brest-plate of Righteousnesse, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit , not to catch at these allurements, or to be caught by them; not to strike sayle, or stoope to these afflictions, or to hang downe our heads, as if wee gave way to them, or were contented that our weaknesse should yeeld to their strength, or our joyes to their afflictions: rather to stand up couragiously, and to expell and resist manfully, considering that wee are not onely heires, but coheires with Iesus Christ, in the participation and felicity of that heavenly Hierusalem , whose joyes are infinite, and glory eternall. I deny not but afflictions, and temptations may befall us, yea, I acknowledge they are subject and incident to the best and dearest of Gods children, whom hee will try in the fire, to see whether they will prove silver, or drosse: yea, hee will come with his Fan and winnow them, to see whether they are Wheat or Chaffe, Corne of Darnell: But the Children of God should b 22 rejoyce in tribulations , and  c 23 account it exceeding joy, when they are tempted: yea, they must consider  d 24 that God tempteth no man with evill: but it is our owne concupiscence that drawes and inticeth us to it. In which respect, wee may justly say, it is a folly to hearken to temptation, but a misery and madnesse to follow and embrace it. For why should discontent cast us into despaire, except wee will resemble the foolish Saylor, who abandoneth the Helme in a storme, when he hath most neede to use it? or the simple fish, that leapes from the pan to the fire; Or those ignorant fooles, who, to shelter themselves from the raine, run into the river? For are we tempted? e 25 The Lord will hold us up by his right-hand , yea,  f 26 hee will not faile those that seeke him: For he is g 27 our Rocke and our fortresse, our shield and our refuge , yea,  h 28 although hee hath wounded us, hee will bind up our wounds . And that wee may yet see a farther benefit, that accrueth to those that are tempted, let us read with joy, and retaine with comfort, that  i 29 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, hee shall receive the Crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised to those that love him: yea  k 30 they that trust in the Lord, shall bee as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever . When therefore (amongst other temptations) choller so farre prevaileth with us, (or rather the Devill with our choller) that wee imagine mischiefe in our hearts, or lift up our hands against our Christian brother; let us then consider what the Apostle tels us from God: l 31 Hee that hateth his brother, walketh in darkenesse, and knoweth not whither he goeth: yea,  m 32 He that loves not his brother, is not of God . Hath any one therefore offended thee? Why, consider hee is a man, and no Angell, and as subject to infirmities as thy selfe; as also, that he is thy brother by Creation and Adoption, by Nature and by Grace, and that hee beares the same Image and Resemblance of God, as thy selfe dost: in which regard thou art counselled,  n 33 Not to let the Sunne goe downe on thy wrath: o 34 That thou seeke after Peace and follow it: p 35 That we forbeare and forgive one another, as Christ forgives us, and q that if we live in Peace, the God of Peace will be with us. But some there are (yea alas, too too many) who are so  r 36 hardned in their hearts and sinnes, and so resolute in their wilfulnesse, as in stead of rellishing, they distaste, and in stead of embracing, reject and disdaine this Christian advice and counsell, opening their thoughts and hearts to all vanities, or rather drawing up the Sluces and Flood-hatches to let in all impiety to their soules, they give way to the treacherous baites of the World, to the alluring pleasures of the Flesh, and to the dangerous and fatall temptations of the Devill, and so cruelly imbrue their hands in the innocent blood of their Christian brethren; and although the murthers of s 37 Abel by Cain out of Envie, of  t 38 Vriah by David for Adultery, of  u 39 Abner by Ioah for Ambition, of  x 40 Naboth by Iezabel for Malice, and of  y 41 Iehu his Sonnes by Athaliah for Revenge (with their severall punishments which God inflicted on them for these their hainous and horrible crimes) are presidents enough fearefull and bloody, to make any Christian heart dissolve into pittie, and regenerate soule melt into teares: yet sith new examples ingender and produce fresh effects of sorrow and compassion, and as it were, leave and imprint a sensible memory thereof in our hearts and understandings, therefore I thought it a worke as worthy of my labour (as that labour of a Christian) to collect thirty severall Tragicall Histories, which for thy more ease, and perfecter memory, I have digested into sixe severall Bookes; that observing, and seeing herein, as in a Christall mirrour, the variety of the Devils temptations, and the allurements of sinne, wherewith these weake Christians (the Authors and Actors hereof) suffered themselves to bee carried away and seduced: Considering, I say, the foulnesse of their facts in procuring the deaths of their Christian brethren, some through blood, others through poyson, as also Gods miraculous detection and severe punishment thereof, in revenging blood for blood, and death for death; yea, many times repaying it home with interest, and rewarding one death with many, that the consideration of these bloody and mournfull Tragedies, may by their examples, strike astonishment to our thoughts, and amazement to our senses, that the horrour and terrour thereof may hereafter retaine and keepe us within the lists of Charity towards men, and the bonds of filiall and religious obedience towards God, who tels us by his Royall Prophet  z 42 that Whosoever makes a pit for others, shall fall into it himselfe: for his mischief will returne upon his own head, and his cruelty fall upon his own pate . Which we shall see verified in these, who seduced partly by sinne, but chiefly by Sathan, who is the Author thereof, forgot the counsell of the Apostle,  a 43 If any one be afflicted, let him pray: and grived,  b 44 to powre forth their hearts before God: not considering  c 45 the efficacie thereof, nor how Moses made the bitter waters of Marah sweet thereby: yea they builded not their faiths on God, and his promises, on Christ and his Church, on his Gospell and his Sacrament, but spurned at all these Divine comforts, and spirituall blessings: yea, and trampled that sweet- smelling Sacrifice of prayer under their feete, which is the Antidote and preservative of the soule against sin, and the Bulwarke to expell all the fiery and bloody darts of Sathans temptations: yea, the very ladder whereby both the aspirations and ejaculations of our soules mount unto God, and his benefits and mercies descend unto us: and this, and only this, was both the Prologue to their destruction, and their destruction it selfe: the which I present unto the view, not only of thine eyes, but of thy heart and soule: because it is a Vertue in us to looke on other mens Vices with hatred and detestation, imitating herein the wise and skilfull Pilot, who mournes to see the Rockes, whereon his neighbours have suffered shipwracke: and yet againe rejoyceth, that by the sight thereof he may avoid his owne: which indeed is the true way, both to secure our safety, and to prevent our destruction, as well of the Temporall life of our bodies in this World, as the Spirituall of our soules in that to come. I must farther advertise thee, that I have purposely fetched these Tragicall Histories from forraine parts: because it grieves mee to report and relate those that are too frequently committed in our owne Countrey, in respect the misfortune of the dead may perchance either afflict, or scandalize their living friends; who rather want matter of new consolation, then cause of reviving old sorrowes, or because the iniquity of the times is such, that it is as easie to procure many enemies, as difficult to purchase one true friend: In which respect, I know that divers, both in matters of this, and of other natures, have beene so cautious to disguise and maske their Actors, under the vailes of other names and sometimes beene inforced to lay their Scenes in strange and unknowne Countries. For mine owne part, I have illustrated and polished these Histories, yet not framed them according to the modell of mine owne fancies, but of their passions, who have represented and personated them: and therefore if in some places they seeme too amorous, or in others too bloody, I must justly retort the imperfection thereof on them, and not thy selfe on mee: sith I only represent what they have acted, and give that to the publike, which they obscurely perpetrated in private. My intent, desire, and prayer is, that if thou art strong in Christ, the perusing and reading of these Histories may confirme thy faith, and thy defiance of all sinnes in generall, and of Murther in particular, or if thou art but weake in the rules of Christian fortitude and piety, that hereby it may incourage and arme thee against the allurements of the World and the Flesh; but especially against the snares and inticements of the Devill, which may stirre thee up either to Wrath, Despaire, Revenge, or Murther: that by the contemplation thereof, thou maist resemble the Bee, and not the Spider, and so draw honey from all flowers, but poison from none. It shall be the felicity of my thoughts, and the glory of my content and labour, if by the sight of these Histories, thou reape any Spirituall comfort or incouragement in this Christian Warfare against the World, the Flesh and the Devill, our three professed and fatall enemies: or if thou wilt bee so wilfully negligent of thine owne good, as to ride poast by other mens sinnes and vices, yet with leisure take a curious and exact survey of thine owne, and in seeing them, not onely endeavour, but strive to reforme them. If this first Booke of my Tragicall Histories worke any good effect in thee, in causing thee to assume and take on a resolution to hate these sinnes in thy selfe, and to detest them in others; then the five other parts which I owe to my promise, and the frontispice to thee, shall not bee kept backe, or with- held thee, but in due time succeed this their elder sister: having purposely enlarged thee this my Preface, because this one shall serve for all sixe bookes, at least, if the rest be so happy to see the world, or I so fortunate, that the World may see them. In the meane time, hoping that thy courtesie and charity will wincke at some defects and imperfections, which may herein have slipt either from my Pen, or the Presse, and whereof the malice of some, or peradventure the ignorance of others may accuse themselves, by condemning me; I recommend these my labours, from their passion, to thy friendship; from their censure, to thy judgement: and us all to the protection of c 46 God, who is our life, and the strength of our dayes .  d 47 To whom be glory for evermore . Thy Christian Friend, Murther to the World, the Title, and my Epistle (to the Reader ) of the first Booke doth apparantly testifie; It is now some ten yeares since that I published the third thereof, since when, my time and leisure hath still beene so interrupted, and (as it were) cut asunder by many different intervening Accidents, that I a long time both doubted and feared that the three last Bookes would have absolutely dyed upon the Designe: But I prayse and blesse God (Hee hath been so favourable to my desires, and so propitious to my intentions and resolutions) that I have cleered that doubt, and secured this feare; for now (by His sacred Assistance and Providence) I have fully and compleatly finished them, and doe here present all Sixe Bookes to thee in one intire Volume. I am not so vaine or presumptuous, to thinke that they deserve to be seene and read of the more Iudicious; for my thoughts aspire to nothing unproportionable to my meane abilities. I knew it was a singular great and excellent poynt of wisedome in Socrates , who (by the Oracle of Apollo ) was doomed the wisest of Men, to confesse and acknowledge to the World, That hee knew but one thing, which was, that hee knew nothing . But here, before I proceed farther, I must let the World know, that I understand there are a generation of people, who have beene so strangely ignorant, as to give out that these my Histories are not Originalls , but Translations , either from Italian or French ; all which (with equall Truth and Modesty) I firmely contradict and deny, whether they regard Matter, Manner , or Method , or Phrase, Place , or Persons ; for contrariwise I found out the grounds of them in my Travells, and (at mine owne leisure) composed and penned them, according to the rule of my weake Fancie and Capacity, they being so farre from Translations , that as I have hitherto refused to imitate any therein, but my selfe, so had I beene so ambitious or vaineglorious to have given way, or consent to it, some Friends of mine in Paris , had long since done the three first Bookes into French , from my first Originall thereof: But knowing Humility to be the fairest Ornament of a Writer, and Modesty best to become Vertuous Mindes, I have hitherto prevented it, and doe still resolve so to doe. Now because as Idlenesse makes some too curious, and Curiosity makes others too idle, so it hath likewise pleased some (not so discreet as forward) to condemne and taxe some of my Histories for being too long, and others for being too short, as if I were bound to observe and please their Fancie, more then the Truth, or mine owne Iudgement, or that in the contriving and penning thereof, J were obliged to delight and content them before my selfe. No, no, as long as I know Men are as different in their Opinions and Censures, as in their Countenances and Complexions, I shall rather connive, and not regard their (worthy to be pittyed) Ignorance, and resolve and content my selfe to contemne and passe by, rather then to esteeme or grieve at it. They will first I hope reade, before they understand; and let mee then request them also, that they will first understand, before they either censure, or taxe any part of what they reade, and so I doubt not, but they will both see, and finde, that (in the penning and publishing of these Histories ) if J am not worthy of their Love , yet (at least) their unjust Envie and Detraction is every way unworthy of mee; and that although many Bookes of these our Times are not particularly approved and liked of for the present, yet it is not impossible for the future both to respect and honour them; and so I leave these uncharitable Zoylists to sleepe standing in the simplicity of their Ignorance, if they will not be rectifyed and reformed by warning: And I will now divert my Pen to the wise and religious Christian Readers , who well know what singular good effects it worketh in their Hearts, first to reade with Understanding, and then to apply with Charity and Prudence, for whose sakes soly J have now added these my three last Bookes of Gods Revenge against the Crying Sinne of wilfull Murther to the three former; For I send them to the publicke good, whereunto all our Endeavours should tend, to the Propagation of Christian Love and Charity among Men, whereat all our Enterprises should ayme, and to the flourishing Advancement of Gods Honour and Glory, to which all the thoughts of our Hearts, and Faculties of our Soules should chiefly aspire and levell. And because Scaliger affirmes, That nothing so soone allures or drawes a Reader to peruse and reade, as a strange Theame and Argument ; Therefore this Path beeing seldome (if ever) troden or beaten by any other, I am so farre from despairing, as I am confident, at least, of thy Acceptance, if not of thy Approbation of these my Labours, and much the sooner, because as thou hast hertofore disburthened my Stationer of the three first of these Bookes, so he (in contemplation thereof) hath now drawne the three last of them from mee to the Presse , with a more then common and usuall Importunitie; and I shall beare this content to my Grave, and I hope from thence to Heaven, that in penning of them all, I shall leave no pernicious Heire behinde me, to infect Youth with Scurrility, or corrupt their Manners and Inclinations with Incentives to Lewdnesse and Uanitie; which as it is the shame of this our Age, so it ought to bee the care of every good man, to shunne that which so many of our lewd and lascivious Pamphlets doe not. In writing heereof, I have consecrated my Pen rather to Instruction then Eloquence, and to Charity rather then Curiosity, and have made it my chiefest Care, Ambition, and Conscience, to profit thy soule, rather then to please thine Eare, and to savour more of Heaven then Earth; Yea, I will affirme (with equall Truth and Boldnesse) that I have written it with so innocent a Penne, that the purest and most unstayned Uirgin shall not need to make her beautifull Cheekes guilty of the least Blush in perusing it all over. It is with no small Cost and Labour, that I first procured, then penned these Histories , and have now polished and prepared them to the Presse , aswell for the extirpating of that Execrable Sinne of Murther (which cryes so loude to Heaven for Uengeance) as also to shew thee Gods sacred Iustice, and righteous Iudgements, in the Vindication of the inhumane Authours thereof; to the end, that (by the knowledge and reading of them) thou mayest become more Charitable, and more hate Crueltie, by their wretched and lamentable Examples, having heerein indeavoured (as much as in mee lyes) to make my Reader a Spectatour, first of these their foule and bloudie Crimes, and then of their condigne and exemplarie Punishments, which (as a dismall Storme and terrible Tempest from Heaven) fell on them on Earth, when they least dreamt or thought thereof. And heere to conclude this my Readvertisement to thee, I religiously from my Heart intreat thee to respect the Matter, not the Wordes, and the Importance and Consequence, more then the Dressing of these Thirty severall Tragicall Histories , whiles I will accompt and esteeme it a farre greater Happinesse for my selfe to learne true Charity, and the true Feare of God in writing them, then to presume of my Ability to instruct and teach others by reading them, because I may justly and truely say with Lipsius , That my Aime and Desire in publishing of them, Is not that I might bee made greater, but better thereby, and (if it please God) others by mee. What Spirituall Fortitude, or Benefit, thou reapest by their Knowledge and Contemplation, I exhort thee, in steed of giving mee any Thankes, to reserve and give them wholly to God, Who is the Giver of all Good things, yea, the Father of Mercie, and the God of all Comfort and Consolation, to whose Grace I commit thee, desiring thee to assist mee with thy favourable Opinion, and daily Prayers to His Throne of Grace, as I shall ever bee ready to requite thee with mine. Thy Christian Friend, being absent from the Presse , and the Presse running farre swifter than my thoughts, it is no marvell if (unwillingly) I have made my selfe guilty of some Errors therein, both of commission and omission; but as I despaire of his excuse and pardon for the same, so yet I neverthelesse hope of thine, because thou knowest that absolute perfection is not to be found in Angels , and therefore much lesse to be expected or hoped for in men, who for the most part are wholly composed of Errours. Those therefore which are materiall and capitall (whereof I here present thee a few) I pray thee (for thine owne content and satisfaction) accordingly to correct and reforme in thy Booke with thy Pen, before thou attempt the reading thereof: And for the Literall ones, if my judgement faile me not, I am confident that thine will esteeme them to bee every way farre more worthy of thy scorne, then of thy care. lin. 2\. the beauty Varina, reade , the beauty of Varina. pag. 60. l. 25. for foreleg, r. his left foreleg. pag. 104. l. 49. for constantly, r. consequently. pag. 132. l. 8. f.

Right Honovrable, your Honour two severall pregnant testimonies, as well of my affection to your service, as of my zeale to your prosperitie, not that I performed those then, or remember them now, in regard of your fortunes, but of your vertues; for I know, that to flatter, is to betray Greatnesse: a vice most ignoble in it selfe, and therefore most improper for your Honours receit, or acceptance, sith your actions still make it apparent to our Sacred Soveraigne , and his most Excellent Majestie to all the World, that you are truely Honourable, truely Noble: and now to second my two former acknowledgements of zeale and dutie to your Honour, with this third, I (though in a lesse serious, yet more publike manner) presume to make you the Worthy and Noble Patron of the first Booke of my Tragicall Histories , (some of the meane observations and collections of my slender Travels,) wherein The Triumphs of Gods Revenge against the crying and execrable sinne of Murther , are so eminent and conspicuous, that (except my hopes betray my judgement) they are made obvious to the sight, and consequently profitable to the soule of a Christian; and not to prophane either your Honours eares, or my penne, with the least sparke or shadow of an untruth; my presumption had not beene so ambitious, to have committed these Histories to the Presse, except with a desire, that in some sort they might thereby represse that hellish sinne, 'gainst which they solely contest and fight, and which in these our dayes (with as much pitie as griefe) makes so bloudie and so lamentable a progression, thereby to serve as stops and preventions, in our England , in imitation of the Cataracts of Nylus , which keepe Egypt from being submerg'd with her Inundation: nor had I aspired to shelter them under the wings of your Honours Patronage and protection, but that thereby they might finde the surer passage, in conversing with the different Opinions, and the safer, in meeting with the selfe-pleasing Censures of the World; and if your Honour please select some few houres from your more serious and weighty Affaires, and vouchsafe imploy them on the different Accidents these Histories report and relate, I (with as much humilitie as confidence) presume, that you will esteeme them, if not profitably lent, yet not prodigally, nor viciously cast away, in the perusall and contemplation thereof. Howsoever, they proceed from his Pen, whose Heart not onely admires and honours your Vertues, but rejoyceth in the Reward thereof, your Fortunes; for I live not, if in the sincerity and candour of my Soule, I wish not that your Honour may still remaine firme to these, and these eternally fixed and constant to You; and from your Honour , successively to your Posterity , transcendently to your Name . Your Honours in all Duty and Service, whole Sixe Bookes ; With the Pages where to finde them. ------ Mermanda to Betanford .    6 Betanford to Mermanda .   7 Grand Pre to Betanford .

Chamberlaine to the King, one of the Lords of his Majesties most Honourable Privie Counsell, and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter. RIGHT HONOURABLE; (of Gods Revenge against Murder ) to your Incomparable Lord and Brother, William Earle of Pembroke (who now lives with God) I therefore held my selfe bound (by the double obligation of my duty and your own generous merits likewise to present this Fourth Booke to your Protection and Patronage, because as England , so Europe perfectly knowes that you are as true an heire to his Vertues, as to his Fortunes, and to his Goodnesse, as to his Greatnesse, and that therfore it may properly be said he is not dead, because they (as well as himselfe) do still survive and live in you, with equall lustre and glory, as having made either a happie Metamorphosis, or a blessed Transmigration into your Noble breast and resolutions, and therefore as it was my sincere respects and zeale to his Honour that then drew me to that ambition; so it is entirely the same which hath now both invited and induced me to this presumption to your Lordship, having no other ends or object in this my Dedication, but that this booke of mine having the honour to be countenanced by so great a personage, and the felicity to be protected by so honourable a Mec aenas , may therefore encounter the more safely with the various humors it shall meet with, and abide more securely the different censures of this our too fastidious age. How these Histories (or the memorable accidents which they containe and relate) will relish with your Lordships palate or judgement, I know not; Only because you are a Noble Son of Gods Church, and an Excellent Servant to your Prince and Countrey, I therfore rather hope than presume, that your Honor will at least be pleased to see, if not delight to know and consider, how the Triumphs of Gods Revenge and punishments doth herein secretly and providently meet with this crying and scarlet sinne of premeditated Murther, and with the bloudy and inhumane Perpetrators thereof, who hereby (as so many mercilesse Butchers, and prodigious Monsters of mankind) doe justly make themselves odious to Men, and execrable to God and his Angels. God hath (deservedly) honoured your Lordship with the favour of two great Earthly Kings your Soveraignes, as first of our royall King Iames , the father, and now of our present most Renowned King Charles his Son, and yet this externall Honour and favour of theirs is no way so glorious to you, as that (maugre the reigning vices of the world) you serve the true God of heaven, in the purity of your heart, and feare and adore him in the integrity of your Soule. And to represent you with naked Truth, and not with Eloquence or Adulation. This Heavenly Piety of yours J beleeve is the prime reason, and true Essentiall cause of all this your earthly Honour, and sublunary Greatnesse, and that this is it likewise which doth so rejoyce your heart, and inrich and replenish your House with so numerous and Noble an Issue, of hopefull and flourishing Children, who (as so many Olive branches of Vertue, and Syents and Plants of Honour) doe both inviron your Bed, and surround your Table, and who promise no lesse than futurely to magnifie the bloud, and to perpetuate and immortalize the Illustrious Name and Family of the Herberts , to all Posterity. Goe on resolutely and constantly (Noble Lord) in your religious Piety to God, and in your Candide and unstained Fidelity to your Prince and Countrey, that your life may triumph o're your death, and your Vertues contend to out-shine your Fortunes, and that hereafter God (of his best favour and mercy) may make you as blessed and as glorious a Saint in Heaven, as now you are a great Peere and Noble Pillar here on Earth, which none shall pray for with more true zeale, nor desire or wish with more reall and unfained affection, than Your Honours devoted and Most humble Servant, Iohn Reynolds .

GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable Sinne of Murther. History XVI.  Idiaques causeth his sonne Don Ivan to marry Marsillia , and then commits Adultery and Incest with her; She makes her Father in Law Idiaques to poyson his owne old wife Honoria ; and likewise makes her owne brother De Perez to kill her Chamber-maid Mathurina; Don Ivan afterwards kils De Perez in a Duell; Marsillia hath her braines dasht out by a horse, and her body is afterwards condemned to be burnt; Idiaques is beheaded, his body likewise consumed to ashes, and throwne into the ayre.  bloud never so wretchedly perpetrated, yet as our Conscience is to us a thousand witnesses, so God is to us a thousand Consciences, first to bring it to light, and then their Authours to deserved punishments for the same, when they least dreame or thinke thereof. For as there is no peace to the wicked, so they shall finde no peace or tranquility here on Earth, either with God, or his creatures, because if they would conceale it, yet the very Fowles of the ayre, yea, the stones and timbers of their chambers will detect it; For the Earth or Ayre will give them no breath nor being, but they shall hang betweene both, because by these their foule and deplorable facts, they have made themselves unworthy of either. A powerfull example, and a pitifull precedent whereof we shall behold in this ensuing History, where some wretched miscreants, and gracelesse creatures, making themselves guilty of those bloudy crimes (by the immediate Revenge and Justice of God) received exemplary and condigne punishments for the same: May we reade it to Gods glory, to the comfort of our hearts, and the instruction of our soules. speech) some tearme Saint Aren , and which (after Lisbon ) is one of the richest and best peopled of Portugall ; there dwelt a Gentleman of some fifty five yeares old, nobly descended, and of a great estate and meanes, named Don Sebastian Idiaques , whose wife and Lady being aged, of well neere fifty yeares, was termed Dona Honoria , and well she deserved that honourable name, for all sorts of Vertues and honours made her youth famous, and her age glorious to all Portugall and Spaine . They had lived together in the bonds of Matrimony almost thirty yeares, with much Honour, content, and felicity, and for the fruits of their affection and mariage, they had two sonnes and foure daughters; but God in his pleasure and Providence (for some reserved reasons best knowne to his All Divine Majesty) tooke from Earth to Heaven all their daughters, and one of their sonnes, so as now they have left them but one sonne, named Don Ivan , a gallant young Gentleman, of some twenty five yeares old, of disposition brave and generous, who after his first youthfull education under his father, had his chiefe breeding under the Duke of Braganza , to whom he was first a Page, and then a chiefe Gentleman retaining to him, whom (in regard of the death of his brother and sisters) his father called home unto him, to be his comfort and consolation, and the prop and stay of his age, as also of the Lady his mother, who had formerly acted a great part in griefe, and a mournfull one in sorrow for the death of her children; and indeed Don Ivan , this sonne of theirs, for all regards of Courtship, was held to be a compleat Gallant, and one of the prime Cavalliers of Portugall . As for Idiaques the father, though in all the course and progresse of his life, and in all the life and conduction of his actions, he bewrayed many morall and generous vertues, yet as one discordant string marres the harmony of the best tuned Instrument, and the concent of the sweetest melody and musicke; and as one foule Vice is naturally subject, and fatally incident to ecclipse and drowne many rich and faire vertues, so (in this his old age, when time had honoured him with white haires) he deboshed himselfe so much, and so sottishly sacrificed his irregular affections to heart-killing concupiscence, and his exorbitant desires to soule-destroying adultery, that hee very often made himselfe a false and inconstant husband to his wife, and a true, yea, too true a friend to Curtisans and Strumpets. His vertuous Lady Honoria extreamly grieves hereat, that now in his later years he should thus lasciviously forget himselfe, both towards her, and towards God. She useth all sweet perswasions, prayers and teares, to diswade and divert him from it, but seeing that all proves vaine, and that he rather prooves worse then better thereat, her discretion makes her brooke it with as much patience as she can, and therefore she seemes not to see, or know that whereof (to her griefe and discontent) she cannot be ignorant; But here comes an accident which will breed both of them, and their Sonne Don Ivan misery of all sides. Some six leagues from Santarem was a wonderfull faire young Gentlewoman being a widdow, aged but of Twenty two yeares, named Dona Marsillia well desended, but by her late deceased Husband left but small meanes, yet she beares out her port bravely, and maintaines her selfe highly and gallantly; and indeed shee is the prime young Lady for beauty in all those parts; Now the base Ambassadors, and Emysaries of Idiaques his beastly and obsc aene lust (the true Vipers and Cankers of Common weales) give him notice of her, and of her singular beauty, as well foreseeing and knowing that it would bee sweet and pleasing newes unto him. He visits and courts her, but as young as she is she puts him off with peremptory refusals, and in vertuous and modest tearmes checks his age for this his lascivious suit and motion to her: But he is as constant in his affection to her, as she is disdainfull to him; for his heart is so insnared and intangled in the fetters of her fresh and delicate beautie, that although shee refuse him, yet he will not forsake her; but after many pursuits and visits, she at last well perceiving that he loved her tenderly and dearly, and that hee still most importunately frequented her house and company, she as a subtill and cunning young Gentlewoman, tels him plainly and privately, that she will acquaint him with a secret of her heart, and a request of her minde and affection, which if hee will cause to be performed, shee then vowes she will for ever be at his disposing and command; Idiaques thinking that she will crave some summe of money of him, or some yearely pension or annuity; he constantly promiseth to grant and performe her request; so she (taking time at advantage) and first swearing him to secrecie, then (with many smiles and blushes) shee tels him, that if ever he thinke to enjoy her love and her selfe, hee must use the meanes to marry his sonne Don Ivan to her, which being effected, shee with much pretended shew of piety and affection, religiously sweares to him, that shee will never have the power or will to deny him any thing, but that his requests shall bee to her as so many commands, and (but onely for himselfe) if his sonne Don Ivan bee her Husband, shee with many imprecations and asseverations sweares, that shee will sacrifice her best bloud and life, rather than distaine his bed, or offer him the least shadow of any scandall or dishonour whatsoever. Idiaques wondreth with admiration, and admires with wonder at this her strange proposition, the which hee findes so knotty and intricate, as measuring Grace by Nature, his Judgement by his Lust and Concupiscence, and his Soule by his Affections, hee knowes not what to say or doe herein; so hee answereth her with more love than wisdome, and for that time leaves her in generall tearme. Hee goes homes, walkes pensively in his Garden, and there consults Pro and Con on this businesse; faine hee would preserve his sonnes honour, and keepe the honour of his bed immaculate, but then the sweet Roses and Lillies of Marsillia's youth and beauty act wonders in his heart, and beares downe all other reasons and considerations before it: Hee visits her againe and againe, but hee findes her inviolably constant in her former resolution. All the favour and courtesie which he can gaine from her, are a few extorted kisses, which so inflame and set on fire his aged heart and affections, as at last like a gracelesse father, hee faithfully promiseth her to use his best art and power to procure his sonne to marrie her. To which end hee takes him aside, and in the softest and sweetest tearmes hee can devise, paints out Marsillia's praises and Vertues to him in the purest and rarest colours, adding withall, that although shee bee not exceeding rich, yet that her personage is so exquisite, and her perfections so excellent, as that shee every way meriteth to bee wife to a Prince. Don Ivan (by what fatall fortune I know not) relisheth this motion of his father, to seeke the Lady Marsillia for his wife, with much delight and joy, and farre the more and the sooner, in regard hee (in divers companies) hath formerly heard the fame of her beauty extolled; and the glory of her Vertues advanced to the Skie, so hee takes time of his father to consider hereof, and rides over sometimes with him to Saint Estiene to visit her; Hee findes her wonderfull faire and beautifull, and wonderfull coy; of a very sweet and Majesticall carriage, and of a delicate and curious speech, fit baits to ensnare the heart, and to betray the judgement of a more solide understanding than that of Don Ivan . Shee acts her part as wisely as he doth amarously and passionately; For the more she makes shew to retire and conceale her affection from him, the more he is provoked to advance and discover his to her; but he cannot be so much enamoured of her beauty, as shee is with the great Estate of Lands and Demaines whereunto God and his father have made him heire. Whiles thus the father privately, and the sonne publikely are seeking to make Marsillia his wife, the old Lady Honoria the mother, by many strong reasons seeks to divert him from her. Shee hath perfect notice of her husbands long and often frequenting of Marsillia's house and company, and therefore fearing the vanity of his age, and doubting the frailty of her youth and chastity, her jelousie and judgement at last findes out and concludes, that his familiarity with her is farre greater than honour can warrant, or honesty allow of; Upon which foundation shee in her discontented lookes and silence, bewrayes unto her sonne Don Ivan , her constant and resolute aversnesse from him to marry her, the which she peremptorily and religiously forbids him upon her blessing, adding withall, that if he marry her, there will infallibly more miseries and calamities attend their nuptials, than as yet it is possible for him either to know or conceive; the which shee prayes him to read in her lookes and silence, to remember it when he sees her not, and to take it as the truest advise, and securest Counsell of a deere Mother to her onely Sonne. Don Ivan ruminates on these speeches and advise of his Mother, as if there were some deepe abstruse mysterie or ambiguous Oracle contained and hidden therein, the which because he hath equall reason as well to feare that this match of his with Marsillia may prove fatall, as to hope and beleeve that it may prove fortunate he makes a stand thereat, as vowing to proceed therein with advisement, and not with temeritie and precipitation; and so forbeares for a month or two to visit her: But the more the Sonne flyes off in his affection from Marsillia , the more doth shee doe the like from his father in requitall, whereat he grieves with discontent, and shee seemes to bite her lippe with sorrow. Idiaques chargeth his son to tell him from whence this his sudden strangenesse and unkindnesse towards Marsillia proceedeth; the which hee answereth with a modest excuse, as favouring more of discretion than disobedience, but yet wholly concealeth his Mothers counsell and advise to him from his Father, the which notwithstanding hee vehemently suspecteth it proceeds from her and her Jealousie. Marsillia is enraged to see her selfe deprived of Don Ivan , whom in her ambitious thoughts, hopes, and wishes shee had already made her Husband; and howsoever Idiaques his Father seekes to conceale and palliate this businesse towards her, yet shee beleeves it is his fault, and not his Sonnes. Shee layes it to his charge, and knitting her browes, shee conjureth him to tell her from whence his Sons unkindnesse to her proceeds: He tels her, he is confident, that it is his old Mother who hath diverted him from her, whereat shee is exceedingly enraged; When seeing this old Letcher so open and plaine with her, shee soothing him up with many kisses, tels him that this old Beldam his wife must first be in heaven, before he can hope to enjoy her, or she his Son here on Earth; when (being allured and provoked by the treacherous suggestions and bloody temptations of the Devill) she proffers him to visit her, and so to poyson her, which hee opposeth and contradicteth; and contrary to all reason  & sense, and repugnant to all Humanity and Christianity, yea, to Nature and Grace, (as a Husband fitter for the Divell, than for this good old Lady his Wife) hee undertakes and promiseth her speedily to performe it himselfe; yea, the Divell is now so strong with him, and he with the Divell, that because hee loves Marsillia , therefore hee must hate his owne deare wife, and vertuous Lady Honoria , and because he hates her, therefore he must poyson her; A lewd part of a man, a fouler one of a Christian, but a most hellish and bloody one of a Husband to his owne wife, who ought to be neere and deere unto him, as being his owne flesh and blood, Yea the other halfe of himselfe. Hee cannot content himselfe to seeke to abuse and betray his Sonne, but hee must also murther the mother, So wanting the feare of God before his eyes, and repleate with as much impiety and Cruelty, as hee was devoyd of all Grace, he is resolute in this his hellish rage and malice against her, and so to please his young Strumpet, hee will send this good old Lady his wife to Heaven in a bloody Coffin, so without thinking of Heaven or Hell , or of God, or his soule, hee procures strong poyson, and acting the part of a fury of Hell, and a member of the Devill, he as a wretched and execrable Husband, administreth it to her in preserved Barbaries, which he saw her usually to love and eat, whereof within three daies after she dies, to the extreame griefe and sorrow of her Sonne Don Ivan , who bitterly wept, for this his mothers hasty and unexpected death, but the manner thereof he knowes not, and indeed doth no way in the world either doubt or suspect thereof. His Father Idiaques makes a counterfeit shew of sorrow and mourning to the world, for the death of his wife, but God in his due time wil unmaske this his wretched hypocrisie, and detect and revenge this his execrable and deplorable murther. Now as soone as Marsillia is advertised of the Lady Honoria's death, she not able to containe her Ioyes, doth infinitely triumph thereat, and within lesse than two moneths after her buriall, Idiaques and Marsillia worke so politiquely with Don Ivan , as hee marries Marsillia although his mothers advise to him in the garden, doe still runne in his mind and thoughts, and now hee brings home his lustfull Spouse and Wife to his lewd and lascivious Fathers house at Sentarem , where (I write with horrour and shame) hee most beastly and inhumanly very often commits Adultery and Incest with her, and they act it so close that for the first yeare or two, his Sonne Don Ivan , hath no newes or inkling thereof, and now Marsillia governeth and rules all, yea her incontinency with her Father Idiaques makes her so audacious and impudent, as shee commands not onely his house, but himselfe, and domineeres most proudly and imperiously over all his Servants. Her waiting maid Mathurina observes and takes exact and curious notice, of her young Ladies lustfull, and unlawfull familiarity, with her Father in Law Idiaques , the which her mistris understanding, shee extreamely beats her for the same; and twice whippes her starke naked in her Chamber, and dragges her about by her haire, although this poore young Gentlewoman, with a world of teares and prayers, beggs her to desist and give over. God hath many wayes and meanes to set forth his glory, in detecting of Crimes, and punishing of offenders, yea he is now pleased to make vse of this young maidens discontent and choller against her insensed Lady and Mistris, for we shall see her pay deare for this cruelty and tyranny of hers towards her, for Mathurina , being a Gentlewoman by birth, she takes those blowes and severe vsage of her Lady in so ill part, and lodgeth it so deepely in her heart and memory, as she vowes her revenge shall requite part of that her cruelty and tyranny towards her; Whereupon (with more haste then discretion, and with more malice then fidelity) she in her hotblood, goes to Don Ivan her young master, tels him of this foule businesse betwixt his young wife and old Father, to the disgrace and shame of nature; and makes him see and know his owne dishonour, in their brutish and beastly adultery and incest. Don Ivan extreamely grieves hereat, yea hee is both amazed and astonished at the report of this unnaturall crime as well of his young wife as aged Father. Hee cannot refraine from choller and teares hereat, to see himselfe thus infinitely abused by her beauty, and betrayed by his lust; and if it be a beastly, yea a prophane part, for one man, and friend to offer it to another, how much more for a father to offer it to his owne, yea to his onely Sonne. Hee expected more goodnesse from her youth and grace from age, but as his wife hath hereby infringed her vow, and oath of wedlocke, so hath his wretched father exceeded and broken those rules and precepts of Nature; yea, he is so netled with the report, and inflamed with the consideration and memorie hereof, that he abhorres her infidelity, and in his heart and soule detesteth his inhumanitie; so as the knowledge hereof doth so justly incense him against her, and exasperate himselfe against him; that resolving to right his owne honour, as much as they have blemished and ruined it, and therein their owne, he scornes to be an eye- Witnesse, much lesse an accessary of this his shame and their infamy: So he here enters into a discreet and generous consultation with himselfe, how to beare himselfe in this strange and dishonourable accident; when perceiving and finding that both his wife and father, had by this their beastly Adultery and Incest, made themselves for ever unworthy of his sight and companie; he here for ever disdaining henceforth to see her, or speake with him, very suddenly (upon a second conference, and examination of Mathurina , who stood firmely and vertuously to her former deposition and accusation against them) takes horse and rides away from Santarem to Lisbone , where providing himselfe of monies and other necessaries, hee takes poast for Spaine , and there builds up his residence and stay at the Court at Madrid , where wee will for a while leave him, to speak of other accidents which fall out in the course of this History. Idiaques seeing the sudden departure of his Sonne, and Marsillia of her Husband, Don Ivan , and being both assured that he had some secret notice and intelligence of their lascivious dalliances and affection, he exceedingly grieves, and shee extremely stormes thereat, because they know that this foule scandall will wholly reflect and fall upon them; and now by this his sudden and discontented departure from them, will be made notorious and apparent to all the world. But how to remedy it they know not; because he hath neither signified him where he is gone, nor when he will returne; the which the more bewrayeth his small respect, and discovereth his implacable displeasure towards them. But as there is no malice and revenge to that of a Woman, so Marsillia assuring her selfe that it was her Maid Mathurina who (to the prejudice and scandall of her Honour) had unlocked this mysterie to her Husband Don Ivan , shee enters into so furious a rage, and so outragious a fury against her, as shee provides her selfe of rods, and intends the next morne e're shee bee stirring out of her bed, to wreake her fierce anger and indignation upon her: But this sharpe and severe resolution of hers, is not so closely carried by her, but Mathurina hath perfect notice thereof, and to prevent this intended correction and crueltie of her incensed Lady and Mistris, shee the night before takes horse, and so rides home to the Towne of St. Saviours to her father; and there, from point to point relateth him all which had past betwixt her Lady and her selfe, and betwixt her Husband, her selfe, and her father in Law; and that now disdaining any more to serve her, as her body, so her tongue is at liberty; for she is not, and she will not be sparing to publish her Mistris, and her father in law's shamefull familiarity and adultery together. But this indiscretion, and licentious folly of her tongue will cost her farre dearer than shee thinkes of, or expecteth. For her late Lady and Mistris, Marsillia , being now perfectly certified of Mathurina's infidelitie and treachery towards her in the point of her dishonour and shame, shee (to salve up her reputation, and to provide for her fame (will not wholly relye upon her owne judgement and discretion herein; but resolves to acquaint Don Alonso De Perez , her owne onely brother herewith, and to crave his ayd and assistance, as also his advice, betwixt whom and her selfe there was so strict a league and simpathy of affection, that (if reports be true) I write it to their shame, and mine owne sorrow, it exceeded the bounds of Nature and Honour, and of Modesty and Chastity; onely the presumption hereof is great and pregnant: for if there had not beene some extraordinary tyes and obligations betwixt them, it is rather to be beleeved than doubted, that for her sake and service, he would ever have so freely exposed himselfe to such eminent feares and dangers, as we shall immediately see him doe; and although (of honour and disposition) he were brave and generous, yet I beleeve he would not have undertaken it. For the Reader must understand that to this brother of hers, Don Perez, Marsillia speedily acquaints the infidelity and treachery of her Maid Mathurina's tongue against her Fame and Honour, which had so unfortunately occasioned her Husbands, Don Ivans , discontented departure from her. Shee protesteth most seriously and deepely to him of her and her father in Law Idiaques innocency in this pretended crime and scandall: Tels him that Mathurina is the onely author and reporter thereof, and therefore till that base and lewd tongue of hers be eternally stopped and silenced, shee shall never enjoy any true content to her heart, or peace to her thoughts and mind either in this world, or this life: When his affection to her makes him to yeeld such confidence to her speeches, vowes, and complaints, that hee holds them to bee as true as Scripture; yea, and the undoubted Oracles of Truth and Innocency; when to please and satisfie her, hee bids her be of good cheare and comfort, and that he will speedily take such order that Mathurina's scandalous tongue shall not long ecclipse her fame, or any further blemish the lustre of her reputation: When this base and bloody Gentleman, De Perez , to make good this his promise to his execrable Sister, he secretly rides over to St. Saviours , and there by night wayting neere her fathers doore, when Mathurina would chance to issue forth; he in a darke night espying her (without any more ceremony or further expostulation) runnes her thorow the bodie two severall times, whereof poore harmlesse innocent soule shee fals downe dead to his feet without once speaking or crying. So De Perez seeing her dispatched, he presently takes horse (which his man there led by him) and poasts away to Santarem , being neither seene nor discovered. And thus this bloody villain most deplorably embrued his guilty hands in the innocent blood of this vertuous young Gentlewoman, who never offended him in thought, word, or deed in all her life; and albeit that her father Signeor Pedro de Castello makes curious enquiry and research for the Murtherer of his Daughter, yet De Perez (mounted at advantage) hath recovered Santarem in safety. But God will in due time finde him out to his shame and confusion; yea, and than when his security and courage little dreames thereof. As soone as he comes to Santarem , hee acquaints his sister Marsillia of his dispatching of Mathurina , who is infinitely glad thereof, and extremely thankefull to him for the same, and how her malice and revenge lookes wholly on her Husband Don Ivan , for offering her this unkind and scandalous indignity of his departure, and for tacitely taxing and condemning her of incontinency with his father Idiaques , which her adulterous heart, and incestuous soule and conscience doth inwardly confesse and acknowledge, though the perfidiousnesse and hypocrisie of her false tongue doe publikely deny it; yea, with her best art and policy, and with her sweetest smiles and kisses, shee hath by this time so exasperated this her bloody brother against him, that (out of his vanity and folly) hee prophanely vowes unto God, and seriously protests and sweares unto her, That if he knew where he were, hee (for the vindication of her honour and innocencie, would ride to him and fight with him, except he would resolve to give him  & her some valuable reparation, and honourable satisfaction to the contrary, which he seales and confirmes to her with many amarous smiles, and lascivious kisses. But as we are commonly never nearer danger than when we thinke our selves farthest from it: So God being as secret in his decrees, as sacred in his resolutions, we shall shortly see De Perez to verifie and confirme it in himselfe; for as in the heat of this his sottish affection to his sister, he is ready to fight with her Husband Don Ivan , if he knew where he was; loe the newes of his residence in Madrid , when he least thinkes thereof, is accidentallie brought him by a Seruant of his owne whom hee purposely sends to Santarem with these two ensuing letters, The one sent and directed from him to his Father the other to his wife Marsillia That to his Father spake thus.  Wife, and was your faith so weake with God, or you so strong with the Devill, that you must therefore make her your Strumpet, because shee was my wife? If Nature would not informe you that I am your Son, yet you are my Father, and it should have taught you to have beene more naturall to me, more honourable to the world, more respectfull to your selfe, and more religious to God, and not to have made your selfe guilty of these foule crimes of Adultery and Incest with her, the least whereof is so odious to God, and so detestable to men, that I want tearmes, not teares to expresse it. For hereby as you have made my shame in finite, so likewise you have made your owne infamie eternall, the consideration whereof gives me so much griefe, and the remembrance sorrow, that holding you for ever unworthy of my sight, and she of my company, I have therefore left Portugall for Spaine , and forsaken Santarem , to live and die here in Madrid . And when hereafter God shall be so mercifull to your soule, to let you see that the winter of your age makes you fitter for your grave than for my bed, and for your winding-sheet, than for my Wife, you will then bold this resolution and proceeding of mine towards you as honourable, as this your crime to me is unnaturall, the which if you henceforth redeeme not with an Ocean of bitter teares, and a world of repentant and religious Prayers to God, I rather feare than doubt, that his Divine Majesty will make you as miserable, as you have made me unfortunate. Don Ivan.  His Letter to his Wife spake this language.  to make thee violate thy vow which thou gavest me in marriage, by committing those damnable sinnes of Adultery and Incest with my naturall father: And if the consideration that I was thy Husband could not in Grace deterre thee from it, yet (me thinks) the remembrance that hee was my father should in Nature have made thee both to abhorre and detest it. And although my tender affection to thee, and filiall obedience to him, made mee expect more goodnesse from thy youth, and Grace from his age, yet God is a just Iudge, and your hearts are true witnesses of these your unnaturall crimes and foule ingratitude towards me, which hath cast so great a blemish and scandall on mine honour, and dashed my joyes with so many untimely afflictions, and immerited sorrowes, that I have abandoned Portugall and Santarem for thy sake, and betaken my selfe to live and die in Madrid in Spaine for mine; where I will strive to make my selfe as contented as discontent can make mee, and so leave this thy enormous crime, and the punishment thereof to God, in whom thou mayest bee happy, but without whom thou wilt assuredly be miserable. And thinke to what just calamities and miseries thine inordinate lusts, and lascivious desires and delights have already deservedly reduced and exposed thee. Sith henceforth I will no more esteeme thee my Wife, or myselfe thy Husband, and that God will assuredly looke on thee with an eye of indignation, and the world, of contempt. Don Ivan.  Idiaques having read and perused that Letter of his sonne, and Marsillia this of her Husband Don Ivan , they are therewith so touched in heart with shame, and stung in conscience with sorrow for their foule crimes of Adultery and Incest, that they blush each at other, and both of them most bitterly curse the name and memory of Mathurina , who was the first authour of this report to him, and which so suddenly incensed him, and occasioned his departure. So to beare up their reputations to the world, and their fames to him, they resolve (without either asking leave or pardon of God) to justifie their innocencie hereof to him, and so to pursue and solicite his returne. To which effect they write and returne him (by his owne servant) their two severall Letters in answer of his, whereof that of Idiaques his father carried this message.  thy wife and me, in so basely taxing us of those foule sinnes of Incest and Adultery, whereof we are as truly innocent, as thou falsely and malitiously deemest us guilty. For I have not abused her nor made her my Strumpet, although not God, but the Devill (in the slanderous tongue of Mathurina ) hath made thee to beleeve so. For Nature hath taught mee more Grace and goodnesse, not so little impiety, for that I know they are sinnes more odious to God, and detestable to the world, than either thy sorrowes can expresse, or thy anger depaint me. Neither have I made thy shame infinite, or canst thou make my infamy visible, much lesse eternall, although herein thou shew me thy indignation, together with thy disobedience, by leaving Portugall for Spaine , and Santarem for Madrid , whereof because thou wilt not make thy duty, I will content my selfe to make thy discretion Iudge betwixt us, If thou have not done me more wrong, than either thy selfe, and the truth right herein, and offered a scandall likewise to thy Wives honour, who made thy company her chiefest joy, as now shee doth thy absence her sharpest miserie and affliction. How then can I goe to my grave with content, when thou forsakest her bed with malice, and my house with disdaine. My innocencie in thy accusation hath no way irritated or offended God, and, if therefore with teares and Prayers thou wilt resolve to aske God, thy Wife, and me forgivenesse for this thy foule crime, and monstrous ingratitude towards us, then mine armes shall bee as open as over they have beene to receive, and my house to welcome thee, and therein thou shalt make thy selfe as truly happy, as thou falsly and uncharitably thinkest that God will make mee miserable. Idiaqves.  The answer of his wife Marsillia to him was couched in these tearmes.  my Vow given thee in marriage, although thou art as far from the truth as from God to beleeve it. But how shall I hope that thy tongue will excuse me of these thy pretended foule crimes of Adultery and Incest, when to my astonishment and griefe I see thou likewise condemnest thy old father to be guilty thereof with me? And if this be any way affection to me, or obedience to him, let all other Husbands judge, and all Sons define and determine. But to returne thee truth for thy falshood; His age expected and deserved more grace, and my youth and Vertues more affection and goodnesse from thee, than to have beleeved those false calumnies and impostures upon the bare report and malitious relation of my hand-maid Mathurina , which are now dead with her, and are as false as thy rashnesse and her revenge makes thee beleeve them true; for it is neither I nor thy father who have any way blemished thine honour, or vanquished thy joyes, but rather thy selfe, and thy too too unkinde and hasty departure from Santarem to Madrid , which (to the prejudice of the truth, and of my content and honour) hath occasioned it. For my heart and soule will testifie both with me and for mee, that my affection and constancy is both as spotlesse, firme, and true to thee, as thy jealousie is false towards myselfe, and therefore as thou leavest my pretended crime, so will I thy reall ingratitude both to time and to God, and if yet thou wilt be so wilfully cruell to live from me, and consequently not to esteeme me thy wife, yet as it is my zeale and duty to begge and pray thee to returne to me, so I will make it my Integrity and Conscience still to hold and love thee for my Husband, and so preserving my heart for thee, as I doe my soule for God, I hope with assurance and confidence that I shall have no cause to feare either his indignation, or the worlds contempt, in regard I have neither merited the one, nor deserved the other. Marsillia.  Upon the writing and contents of these two Letters of Idiaques to his sonne, and of Marsillia to her Husband Don Ivan , the Reader may please to observe and remember with how much policie, and with how little Piety they seeke to over-vaile and deny these their Adulteries and Incest towards him, thereby to make their actions and themselves appeare as innocent, as they are guilty both to him and to God. But God being the Authour of Truth, and the Father of Light, and whose Sacred Throne and Tribunall is environed with more glorious Sunnes than we see glistering Starres in the Firmament; He will one day unmaske this their hypocrisie, and bring their foule sins of Adultery and Incest, both to light and punishment. Now as Marsillia is exorbitantly lascivious in her affection to her brother De Perez , and he reciprocally so to her, so with a world of false sighs  & tears she shewes him her Letter, and her fathers in law Idiaques , which they had sent to her Husband Don Ivan to Madrid , and with many female oaths and asseverations protesteth to him of both their innocencie herein, which her brother beleeves yea, her fained sorrowes and false teares had so farre trenched and gained upon his cruelty, that in contemplation and commiseration of her wrongs, hee was then so vaine and impious, as once hee thought to haue carried these two Letters himselfe into Spaine , and there to have fought with Don Ivan for the separation of his sisters honour. But at last leaving passion to consult with reason, and temerity againe to bee vanquished and swayed by judgement, first that these Letters of theirs should see Spaine , and then to attend his brother in Law Don Ivan his answer to them, and as he shall therein finde him either perverse or flexible to his wives desires, and his fathers expectations, hee will then accordingly beare himselfe and his resolutions towards him, and hereon both himselfe and his sister Marsillia doe joyfully determine and conclude. So Don Ivans owne servant returnes these two aforesaid Letters from Santarem to Madrid to his Master, who breaking up the seales, and perusing them, he doth not a little wonder at his wives impudency, and his fathers impiety, in so strongly denying these their foule crimes to him: But hee is not a little astonished, and withall afflicted and grieved, when he fals upon that point and branch of his wives Letter, which reports the death of her maid Mathurina , for in his heart and conscience he now verily thinks and beleeves, that his wife in her inveterate malice and revenge to her, hath caused her to be murthered, and sent her to Heaven in a bloudy winding sheet. But alas, if it bee so, how to revoke or remedy it he cannot. Once therefore hee was minded to have neglected these their Letters, and so to have answered them with perpetuall oblivion, and a disdainfull silence: But then againe considering with himselfe that this might rather increase than extenuate their hopes of his returne, he betakes himselfe to his Study, where taking pen and paper, he, neglecting his father, traceth his wife this Letter in answer of hers, and againe sends it her into Portugall by his owne servant, which assureth them of his resolution not to returne.  augmented my confidence of my fathers shame, and thy infamy, in your foule sinnes of Adultery and Incest, perpetrated against me, and which is worse, against God, so that I am fully resolved for ever to forsake his house, and thy company, and to live and die here in Madrid , [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) as griefe and disconsolation will permit me; For I prize the (unjust) Apologie of thy (pretended) Innocencie at so low a rate, and value it at so base an esteeme, as I disdaine it for thy sake, and thy selfe for thine owne. I do as much grieve, as I both doubt and feare, thou rejoycest at thy maid Mathurina's death, and as I am ignorant of the manner, so if my father and thy selfe have beene the cause thereof, you have then all the reasons of the world to beleeve, that God (who is as just in his resolutions, as sacred in his decrees) will in the end revenge it to his glory, and punish it to your confusion. Don Ivan.  This Letter of his doth inflame his wife with malice and indignation, for now her father and she see these their lustfull and lascivious crimes seated and confirmed in his beleefe, and his stay in Spaine fixed in his anger, and eternized in his resolution: When as close as they beare it, yet knowing full well that the world will take notice of it, and ere long make it their publike scandall and infamie. He is so devoid of Grace, and shee of goodnesse, that to prevent it, hee wisheth his sonne in Heaven with his mother, and shee her old father in law in grave with her young maid Mathurina . But these vaine hopes of theirs may deceive them, which as yet they two are not so wise to thinke of, nor so cautious or religious to consider, but rather more resembling bruit beasts than Christians, they still continue their obscene and incestuous pleasures, the which I take small delight or pleasure to mention in regard of modesty, or to repeat in respect of Nature and Honour. Here Marsillia againe repaires to her brother De Perez , as to her Oracle and Champion; she shewes him both these two last Letters of her husband to his father and herselfe, and conjureth his best advice and speediest assistance for the recovering of her honour, in that of her husbands affection and company, or else that she were freed from him, and he out of this life and this world, that so her scandall and wrongs might die with him, and for ever bee raked up in the dust of his grave, and buried with him in eternall oblivion and silence. Don Perez (in heart and minde) is so much his sisters, as he is no more himselfe, when making his affection doe homage to her beauty, and his judgement and resolution to pay tribute to his affection, he prayes her to referre this charge and businesse to the care of his discharge; when giving her many kisses, and willing her to read his heart in his eyes, he gives her the good night; and the next morning being impatient of all delayes, he takes one Seignior Gaspar Lopez , a noble Gentleman, and a valiant intimate friend of his with him, and relating him his intent to fight with his brother Don Ivan , and the cause thereof: They undertake this journey of Spaine , and so arrive at Madrid , where Lopez prayes Perez to make him his Second in that Duell; De Perez thanks him for this his affection, but tels him hee will hazard himselfe but not his friend; so writing a Challenge to Don Ivan , hee seales it up, and requesteth Lopez to deliver it to him, and the same night to returne him his answer. Lopez accordingly findes out Don Ivan in his owne chamber, and gives it to him in faire and discreet tearmes, who wondring it came from his brother in law De Perez , but farre more to understand that he was now in Madrid , he no way dreaming of a Challenge, but rather thinking that his wife his sister had sent him thither to him to worke her reconciliation, and consequently his returne to her to Santarem , he hastily breakes up the seales thereof, findes it charged with this language.  and scandalous Letters to her, and Portugall hath read it in thy sudden and chollericke departure from her into Spaine , wherefore considering what she is to thee, and I to her, I hold my selfe bound (both in Honour and Bloud) to make her wrongs and quarrels mine. To which end I have left Santarem to finde thee out here in Madrid , purposely to pray thee to meet me to morrow betwixt six and seven in the morning, at the farthest West end of the Prado , with thy Rapier, a confident Gentleman of thy friends, and thy Chirurgeon, without a Second, where thou shalt finde me to attend thy comming, and relying upon the equity of my cause, and the ingratitude and infamy of thine, I make no doubt but to teach Don Ivan what it is for him (without ground or truth) to cast a base aspersion and wrongfull blemish upon the lustre of his Wife, and my Sister, the Lady Marsillia's honour, whose descent and extraction is as good as thine, and her education and Vertues farre more sublime and excellent. Thy generosity obligeth thee to the honourable performance hereof, and mine honour reciprocally to performe this Obligation. De Perez  Don Ivan having received and perused this Challenge of his brother in law De Perez , and finding his furious resolution to exceed his judgement, hee knowing himselfe innocent, his cause good, and his courage and valour every way to bee superiour to the others, highly disdaining to bee out-braved by any Nobleman or Gentleman breathing, in the point of Honour and generosity, hee with a cheerefull countenance returnes Lopez to his brother De Perez with this accepting answer.  through her treachery and infidelity to mee, and therefore my Letters to her to that effect are as true as she is false in denying it; notwithstanding sith she is thy sister and my wife, I as much approve of thy affection to her, as I condemne thy temerity to me, and thy indiscretion to thy selfe, in making her quarrell thine, and by forsaking Santarem , to fight with me here in Madrid . And because thou shalt see and finde that I have as much courage as innocency, I therefore accept of thy Challenge, and am so farre from learning any point of valour of De Perez , as to his shame and my glory, I hope to teach him, that I have no way cast a false aspersion or blemish on the lustre of her reputation, but she on herselfe, and consequently that I will neither affect her, nor feare thee. For God lending me life, I will to morrow breake fast with thee at thine owne time and place appointed, where my honour and generosity invites me to come, and thine to meet me. Don Ivan.  These two inconsiderate Gentlemen having thus embarqued themselves in the strong resolution of this weake quarrell and rash Duell, which earthly honour cannot as justly approve and allow of, as divine Religion and Christian Piety and charity disavow and execrate. Their malice and revenge each to other is so violent and impetuous, that without any thought either of God or their Soules, or of Heaven or Hell, they passe over the night, if not in watchfulnesse, yet in broken and distracted slumbers, yea the morne no sooner peeped from Heaven through their windowes to their chambers, but they leape from their beds to the Prado, where De Perez with his friend Lopez come first on horse-backe, and immediately after them Don Ivan in his Coach, with a young Gentleman his friend, tearmed Don Richardo De Valdona : So these two Duelists disdaining to be tainted with the least spice of dishonour, or shadow of cowardise, they at first sight of each other, throw off their doublets, and in their silke stockings and pumps, with their Rapiers drawne, they without any further complement or expostulation approach each other; But here before they beginne to reduce malitious contemplation into bloudy action, I hold it fit to informe my Reader with a circumstance that now past betweene them, wherein doubtlesse the Providence of God was most conspicuous and apparant; For as by the Law and custome both of Spaine and Portugall , all Rapiers should bee of one length, yet De Perez curiously casting his vigilant eye upon that of Don Ivan , either his feare, or his judgement, or both, informe him that that Rapier is longer than his, whereat Don Ivan grieves farre more than De Perez can possible either rejoyce or wonder, for he is so farre from any way blemishing his honour with this, or with any other point or shadow of dishonour, as now he gives his Rapier to measure, and to write the truth, his is found one inch longer than that of De Perez , when biting his lip for anger, he (resembling himselfe) proffers to fight with that either of Lopez or Valdona , which was sufficient reason for one Gentleman of Honour to give, and for another to take; but when he sees that this proffer of his will neither secure De Perez feare, nor confirme his content, then as a Noble and generous Gallant, he freely exchangeth Rapiers with him, gives De Perez the longer, and contents himselfe to fight with the shorter, whereat De Perez rests satisfied, and well he may, sith this action and his receit thereof, doth as much testifie Don Ivans glory, as his owne dishonour and shame, and now they againe approach each other to fight. At their first comming up Don Ivan runnes a firme thrust to De Perez breast, but hee (bearing it up with his Rapier) runnes Don Ivan in the cheeke towards his right eare, which drawes much bloud from him, and he in exchange runnes De Perez thorow his shirt sleeve without hurting him: At their second meeting they againe close without hurting each other, and so part faire without offering any other violence: At their third assault De Perez runnes Don Ivan thorow the brawne of his left arme, who in exchange requites him with a deepe wound in his right side, from whence issued much bloud, and now they breathe to recover wind, and to the judgements of Lopez and Valdona , (as also of their Chirurgions) they hitherto are equall in valour, and almost in fortune; so although these spectators doe of both sides earnestly entreat them to desist and give over, yet they cannot, they will not be so easily or so soone reconciled each to other; So after a little pausing and breathing, they (with courage and resolution) fall to it afresh, and at this their fourth encounter Don Perez gives Don Ivan a deepe wound in his left shoulder, and he requites him with another in exchange, in the necke; and although by this time their severall wounds hath engrained their white shirts with great effusion of their scarlet bloud, yet they are so brave, so generous, or rather so inhumane and malitious, that they will not yet give over, as if they meant and resolved rather to make death feare them, than they any way to feare death; But their fifth close will proue more fatall; for now after they had judiciously traversed their ground, thereby to deceive each other of the disadvantage of the Sunne, whiles De Perez directs a full thrust to Don Ivans breast, hee bravely and skilfully warding it, in requitall thereof, runnes him cleane thorow the body, a little below his right pap, when closing nimbly with him, and pursuing the point of his good fortune, hee whips up his heeles, and so nailes him to the ground, when he had the strength to begge his life of Don Ivan , and God knowes he much grieved that it was not then in his power to give it him, for this his last wound being desperately mortall, hee presently died thereof, having neither the remembrance to call on God, much lesse to begge mercy of him for his sinfull soule; but as hee lived abominably and prophanely, so he died miserably and wretchedly: And although I confesse it was too great an honour for him to receive his death from so brave a noble Gentlemans hands as Don Ivan , yet it is a most singular providence, and remarkable punishment of God, that hee died by the hands of his owne lascivious sisters Husband, and which is yet more, by his owne sword, as if God had formerly decreed, and purposely ordained, that the selfe same sword should give him his death, wherewith so lately and so cruelly hee had bereaved that harmlesse innocent young Gentlewoman Mathurina of her life, although in regard of this his foule and lamentable murther, hee (with lesse honour and more infamy) every way deserved to have died rather by a halter than a sword; But Gods Providence is as unsearchable as sacred. Don Ivan having rendred thanks to God for this his victory, he out of his noble courtesie and humanity, lends Lopez his Coach to transport the dead body of his brother in Law De Perez into the City, and taking his horse in exchange, he by a private way gets home to his lodging. But this their Duell is not so secretly carried, but within three houres after all Madrid rattles thereof; who knowing the Combatants to be both of them noble Gentlemen of Portugall , it gives cause of generall talke, and argument of universall envie and admiration in all Spaniards, especially in the nobler sort of Souldiers and Courtiers. When the very day after that Don Ivan had caused this his brother to be decently buried, Lopez repaires to his chamber to him, and in a faire  & friendly manner enquires of him if he please to returne any Letter of this his friends death, and of his owne victorie to Santarem to Don Idiaques his father, or the Lady Marsillia his wife, and that his best service herein shall attend and wait on his commands: Don Ivan thanks Lopez for this his courtesie, but tels him that for some reserved reasons he will send no Letter to either of them, but otherwise wisheth him a prosperous returne to Portugall ; so Don Ivan remaines in Madrid , and Lopez returnes for Santarem , and there from point to point relates them the issue of that Combat, as the victory of his sonne Don Ivan , and the death and buriall of De Perez , adding withall, that he was so reserved and strange, that he would write to neither of them hereof. At the relation and knowledge of this mournfull newes, Idiaques cannot refraine from much sorrow, nor Marsillia from bursting forth into bitter teares and lamentations thereat; for seeing her deare and onely brother thus slaine by the hand of her owne unkinde Husband; by losing him shee knowes she hath lost her right arme, and he being dead shee knowes not to whom to have recourse either for counsell, assistance, or consolation. And yet as much as hee sorrowes and she grieves at this diasterous accident, they notwithstanding are yet so farre from thinking it a blow from Heaven, or from looking either up to God, or downe to their owne sinfull hearts, consciences, and soules for the same, that without making any good use, or drawing any divine or profitable morall thereof, they still continue their beastly pleasures and damnable Adultery and Incest together, as if there were no God to see, nor no deserved torments or miserie reserved to punish it. But they and we shall immediately see the contrary. To the griefe of our hearts, and compunction of our soules, wee have in this History seene wretched Idiaques (by the instigation of the devill) to poyson his wife the Lady Honoria ; and likewise his daughter in Law Marsillia to have caused her brother De Perez to have cruelly murthered her waiting-maid in the street; as also by the Providence of God Don Ivan to have slaine the said De Perez in the field, and our curiosity and expectation shall not goe far, before we shall see the just Revenge and punishments of God condignly to surprise wretched Idiaques , and gracelesse Marsillia for the same; for his Divine Justice contending with his Sacred Mercy, it hath at last prevailed against these their foule and bloudy crimes; so now when they are in the middest, yea, in the height  & jollity of all these their soule delights & security, like an unlooked for storme and tempest, it will suddenly befall them. Life hath but one way to bring us into this world, but death hath infinite to take us from it, and what is this but a true argument & reason of Gods glory and our miserie, of his power, and of our frailty and weaknesse, and therefore because wee are as repleat of sinne as he is of sanctity, and as subject to imperfections, as all perfections are both properly co-incident and subject to him: It will be an act of morall wisdome, and of religious piety in us, rather to glorifie than examine his sacred Providence, and rather to admire than pry into his divine Decrees and resolutions. And because his correction and punishment of all sinnes, especially of this crying and scarlet sinne of Murther, is as Just as secret, and as inscrutable as Just; therefore to draw towards the period of this deplorable History, God is first pleased to exercise and beginne his Judgements on miserable Marsillia , and then to finish it in wretched Idiaques . But his divine Majestie is likewise pleased and resolved both to impose and make as great a difference in their punishments, as he found a parity and conformity in their crimes. It is Marsillia's pleasure (or to say more truly, the providence and pleasure of God) that she rides from Santarem to Coimbra to visit a sicke Gentlewoman her Cousin German, who dwelt there, being only accompanied with her man Andrea on horse-backe, and her foot boy Piscator to attend her, and as shee comes within a small halfe league of that towne, having sent away her man Andrea before, and her foot boy Piscator being a very little distance behinde her, there suddenly starts up a Hare betweene (or close to) her horse legges, which so amazed her horse, (which was as hot and proud as the Gentlewoman his Mistresse whom he bore) as comming off with all foure, he throwes her to the ground, and kicking her with his hinde feet at her fall, hee strikes her in the fore-head, and so dasheth out her brains; God so ordaining, that she had not the power to speake a word, much lesse the grace or happinesse to repent her of her horrible sinnes, Adultery, Incest, and Murther. And thus was the lamentable and fearfull end which God gave to this gracelesse young Lady, the which I cannot as yet passe over, without annexing and remembring one remarkable point and circumstance therein, in which the Justice and Mercy of God to both sexes, and all ages and degrees of people, doth miraculously resplend and shine forth; for that very horse which threw and killed her was the verie same which shee formerly lent to her Brother De Perez , and whereon he rid to Saint Sauiours when he (by her instigation) killed her waiting maid Mathurina . Good God, how just, and wonderfull are thy decrees, Deere Lord, how immense and sacred is thy Iustice. But this is but the forerunner, and as it were but the enterance into a further progression of this History. For as her foote boy Piscator , extreamely wept and bitterly cryed, at the sight of this mournefull and tragicall death of his Lady and Mistris, God had so decreed and provided, that the next that passed by, and who were sorrowfull spectators thereof, were two Corigadors (or Officers of Iustice) of the Citie of Coimbra riding that way in their Coach to take the aire. Whom compassion of the deplorable death of this faire unknowen young Gentlewoman, they descend their Coach, and having enquired and understood of her sorrowfull Foote boy what shee was, they then with much respect and humanity cause her dead Corps to be decently layd into their Coach, which they shut, and so mounting their Servants Horses they returne againe to Coimbra. From whence they send her Man Andrea , in all possible post hast to Santarem to acquaint his Master and her Father in law Don Idiaques with this lamentable death of his daughter in Law Marsillia , and to pray him to repayre speedily thither to them to take order for her Buriall. Andrea is no sooner departed for his Master, but these two Corigadors consult on the fatality of this accident, and very profitably consider for themselves, that the horse who killed her, and all her apparell and jewels, by the custome and royalty of their City were devolved and forfeited to their jurisdiction; to which effect they cause her rings, chaines, and bracelets to be taken from her, and then her pockets likewise to bee carefully searcht for gold and jewels; so as murther cannot be long concealed or undetected; wee may therefore here behold the wonderfull Providence, and singular Justice of God, for in one of her pockets they finde, folded up in a rich cut-worke handkerchiefe, the last Letter which her Husband Don Ivan had written and sent her from Madrid ; at the sight of this Letter one of these Corigadors is desirous to have it read publikely, but the other being more humane and respective to the concealing of Ladies secrets, which many times prove that of their honours) hee contradicts it, till at last God enlightning their judgements, and prompting and inspiring their hearts, that the perusall of this Letter might (peradventure) import and report something which might tend to his service, and conduce to his glory; they fall then on medium betwixt both their opinions, and so withdrawing themselves to a private chamber, they there secretly, o're-reade this Letter, wherein with admiration and amazement they understand of the obscene Adultery and Incest of Don Idiaques with this his daughter in law Marsillia , which was the cause of her Husband Don Ivan his absence from her in Spaine : But at length when they proceed farther therein, and so fall upon these words of Don Ivan to her in this his Letter; I doe as much grieve as I both doubt and feare thou rejoycest at thy hand-maid Mathurina's death, and as I am ignorant of the manner, so if my father and thy selfe have beene the cause thereof, you have then all the reasons of the world to beleeve, that God will in the end punish it to your confusion ; then (led by the spitit of God) they both concurre in one opinion, that this their Adultery, and this Murther of Mathurina did not only firmly reflect, but equally take hold both on Idiaques and Marsillia , and therefore that this her late deplorable and disasterous end, was only a blow from God, and the very true fore-runner, and undoubted Harbinger of his owne to come: When resolving to seize and imprison Idiaques as soone as he should arrive thither to Coimbria ; They hushing up this Letter and businesse in their owne bosomes, doe then hold it fit to send for Marsillia's foot-man Piscator to come to them, which he speedily doth. They carefully enquire of him if his dead Lady had not sometimes a waiting Gentlewoman named Mathurina , hee answered them yes, and that she was lately murthered in the streets of Saint Saviours , and that her murtherers were as yet unknowne: They demand of him againe whose daughter she was; hee informes them that her father is a Gentleman who dwels in Saint Saviours , and that his name is Seignior Pedro de Castello , which being as much as they sought for; putting their seruants to watch ouer this foot-man, that he might not escape to give the least inkling of their demands to his old Master Idiaques , they presently send away poast to Saint Saviours for Castello , and (in honour to Justice) these two Corigadors as Christian Magistrates, having put all things in order for the vindication of the truth of these deplorable matters, that very night Idiaques arrives at Coimbra , and descends from his Coach to the house of one of these Corigadors, where the dead body of his daughter Marsillia lay; at whose mournfull fight, as soone as his passionate griefe and sorrow had caused him to shed and sacrifice many rivolets of teares, when hee least dreames or thinks thereof, these two Corigadors cause him to be seized on, and instantly commit him close prisoner, without acquainting him with the cause hereof; where all that night his guilty heart and conscience (as so many Friends and Furies) assuring him that it was for poysoning of his owne Lady Honoria ; there horror and terrour, griefe and despaire, and sorrow, and anguish, doe act their severall parts upon the Theatre of his soule. The next morne Castello (Mathurina's father) likewise arrives to Coimbra , to whom the Corigadors communicate this Letter of Don Ivan to his wife, which he sent her from Spaine , wherein they tell him the murther of his daughter Mathurina seemes probably and strongly to reflect upon Idiaques , and his daughter in law Marsilla ; when they farther acquainting him with her tragicall death, as also with his imprisonment; Castello (with a world of teares and cries) exclaimes that undoubtedly they were the authours, if not the actors of his daughters lamentable murther, and so very passionately and sorrowfully craves justice of them on Idiaques for the same, which they are as willing to grant and performe, as hee to desire: So after dinner in the publike Tribunall of Justice, they send for Idiaques legally and juridically there to appeare before them; where this sorrowfull father (with much passion, and more teares) doth strongly accuse him for the murther committed and perpetrated on his daughter Mathurina ; the which Idiaques with many high and stout answers denieth; he alleageth many oylie words, and sugred and silken phrases, to justifie and Apologize his innocencie: Which these Corigadors (led by the finger of God) hold rather to be far more ayrie than solide, and farre more plausible than reall or true; so they (still remembring his sonne Don Ivans Letter to his wife Marsillia ) doe (without regard to his quality or age) adjudge him to the Racke. The which Idiaques (fearing infinitely more the murther of his owne Lady Honoria , than that of Mathurina ) endures the tortures and torments thereof, with a fortitude and resolution farre beyond his strength and age, and with an admirable constancie stands firmly to the deniall of this fact and accusation; so seeing the Racke taken away, and himselfe from the Racke, he is therefore very confident and joyfull, that his danger is likewise o're past and o're blowne: But these vaine hopes of his will yet both deceive, and in the end betray him, for as yet his conscience hath not made peace with God. For the griefes  & sorrowes of this mournfull father for this lamentable murther of his daughter, have now made him both industrious in his solicitation, and religious in this his prosecution against Idiaques towards these Corigadors, to whom againe he becomes an earnest, and yet an humble Petitioner, that they will give him eight dayes time more to fortifie his accusation, and that all that time he may still remaine prisoner without Baile or Surety; which they finding reasonable, and consonant to all equity and law, they freely grant him. When Castello having God for his Councellor, and whom in a small time Idiaques shall finde for his Judge, calling to minde some words of his deceased daughter touching the suspition of poysoning her old Lady by her Husband, to make way for this march with Don Ivan , hee doth no more accuse him for murthering of his daughter Mathurina ; but some two dayes after he frames and presents a new Inditement and accusation to his Judges against him, for poysoning his old wife the Lady Honoria . Which these Judges admiring and wondering at, they then partly, nay almost confidently beleeve, that there is some great crime, and foule fact in this businesse against Idiaques , which God will in fine detect and bring to light, by the solicitation and industry of this honest poore Gentleman Castello . So they admit againe of his second Inditement against him, and by vertue hereof convent him before them at their Tribunall of Justice. Idiaques understanding hereof, his guilty conscience now denounceth such thundering peales of feare and amazement to his appalled heart and trembling soule, as they will give no peace either to himselfe or them; and the Devill who had ever heretofore promised him his best aid and assistance, now flies from him, and leaves him to stand or fall to himselfe: And here it is that his courage begins to faile him, and that his feare and shame is almost resolved and ready to proclaime himselfe guilty of this his last and worst accusation, the poysoning of his owne wife the Lady Honoria : But againe the hope of life is yet so sweet to him, as the feare of death is displeasing and bitter, and therefore (with a wretched resolution, and a miserable confidence) he againe artificially endevoureth to bleare the eyes of these his Judges, with his chiefest Eloquence, and sweetest Oratory; who having given him his ful carreer to speake in his owne defence and justification, when they perfectly knew he yet spake not one valuable word or reason, either to defend or justifie himselfe; Then one of these cleere-sighted Corigadors (in the behalfe of both of them) returnes him this grave reply and pious exhortation. That as they have not the will to accuse him, so they have not the meanes or power to excuse him, for being (at least) accessary to both, or either of these murthers of his Lady Honoria , or Mathurina ; that the sudden death of the first, and the violent and untimely one of the last, the voluntary absence of his sonne Don Ivan in Spaine, with his killing of De Perez there, and now the fearefull and lamentable end of his daughter in law, Marsillia (whose body is yet unbursed, and her blood scarce cold) left a dangerous reflexion, and a pernitious suspition on his life and actions at least of Adulterie and Incest if not of Murther (whereof his Sonne Don Ivans Letter which hee writ to his wife Marsillia which they have there to shew, is a most strong and pregnant witnesse) and that the least of these crimes are capable to ruine a greater personage than himselfe. That he could cast no mist of delusion before Gods eyes, though he artificially endevoured and laboured to cast a vaile before theirs. That the shedding of innocent blood was a crying Sinne, which despight of forcery and of Hell would (in Gods due time) draw downe vengeance to Earth from Heauen on their Authors. That if he were guiltie of his accusation, he had no better plea than confession, nor safer remedie than repentance. That contrition is the true marke, of a true Servant of God, and though we fall to Nature and sinne as being men yet wee should rise againe to grace and righteousnesse as being Christians. That to deny our Crimes, is to augment them and consequently their punishments, both in Earth, and in Hell, and that he was not a Christian but an Infidell, who would attempt to save his life with the losse of his soule, with many other religious exhortations concurring and looking that way. But all this, notwithstanding, Idiaques his Faith and Conscience, was yet so strong with Sathan, and therefore so weake with God, that he left no excuse, policy or evasion uninvented to bleare the eyes of these Corigadors, and so to make his innocency to passe current with them. But his eloquence and asseverations cannot prevaile with the solidity of their Iudgements, for God will not suffer them to bee led away with words nor seduced or deluded with shadowes: But from the circumference of circumstances, they now flie to the centre of truth, and to the Authour and giver, yea to the life and soule thereof, God. So they againe adjudge him to the rack for his second accusation of Murther, as they formerly had done to him for his first. At the pronouncing of which sentence, If wee may judge of his heart by his face, hee seemed to be much afflicted, appaled and daunted, which his Iudges perceiving before they expose him to his torments, they in Honour to his Age and qualitie, but faire more to Truth and Iustice (whom they know to be two Daughters of Heaven) they now hold it a point of Charity and Piety to send him two Diuines to his prison to worke upon his Conscience and Soule, which they doe: And God in the depth of his goodnesse, and the richnesse of his mercy, was so mercifully propitious and indulgent to him, that hee added such efficacy to their perswasions and power to their exhortations, as at the very sight of the racke, hee with teares in his eyes, then and there confessed unto them, That hee was innocent of Mathurinaes murther, but guiltie of poisoning his owne wife the Ladie Honoria , for the which he said he most heartily and sorrowfully repented himselfe. Whereupon his Iudges (and the rest present) admiring with wonder and praising God with admiration for the detection of this his foule bloody and lamentable crime, they pronounce sentence against him. That for expiation thereof, hee at eight of the clocke the next morning shall have his head cut off at the place of common execution in that Towne. When Idiaques , who (yet adhered so much to Sathan) that hee could never be devested of his mortall sinnes before he were first deprived of his sinfull life, doth yet still flatter himselfe with some further hope of life, and so hee appeales from the judgement and sentence of this Court of Coimbra to that of Santarem , as being native and resident thereof; as also because he committed his murther there for which they (not his competent Iudges) adjudged him to death: Whereat although the Corigadors of Coimbra for the preservation of the priviledges of their Court and Towne, doe obstinately expose and vehemently contest it, yet at last well knowing, and being conscious with themselves, that smaller Townes and Courts in Portugall are bound and subject to depend of the greater; They therefore making a vertue of necessitie, and contenting themselves to give way to that which they cannot remedie, doe ordaine that Idiaques should bee conveighed and tryed at Santarem . But yet before they suffer him to depart their Towne, they in honour to Iustice, in wisedome to themselves, and in reputation to their Towne and Court, doe seriously and religiously charge him in the name and feare of God to declare truly to them, whether his unburyed Daughter in Law Marsillia were not likewise accessary with him in poysoning his Wife, the Lady Honoria , which at first he strongly denies to them. But then they send away for the two Divines who had formerly dealt with him and his Conscience in Prison, who exhort him to carrie a white and candyd soule to Heaven, and threaten him with the torments of Hell fire if hee doe not. When with sighes and teares, he confesseth that to them, and that it was hee himselfe who administred that poyson to his wife, but that his daughter in Law Marsillia bought it for him. So these Iudges (upon the validity of this free and solemne confession) in detestation of this her lamentable crime, doe reverently resolve to second, and glorifie God in his Iudgements towards her, and therefore they presently condemne her dead body to bee burnt that afternoone in their market street, the common place of execution, which accordingly is then and there performed in presence of a great concourse of people, who infinitly rejoyce that God so miraculously destroyed the life, and their Iudges the body of so execrable a female Monster. By this time we must allow, and imagine that our old Lecher, and new murtherer Idiaques (by vertue of his appeale) is brought to his owne City of Santarem , and I thinke either with a ridiculous hope or a prophane and impious resolution to see whether God will punish him there with death, or the Divell preserve and save him from it. Hee hath many friends in this Court, who are both great and powerfull, and therefore builds all his hopes of life, on this reeling quicksand, this snow, this nothing, that his great estate of money and lands will undoubtedly act wonders with them for his pardon. But still he hopes, because still the divell deceives him, He is arrived here at Santarem , where this faire Citie which might heretofore have proved his delight and glory, is now reserved for his shame and appointed and destined for his confusion; They cannot brook the sight, much lesse the cohabitation and company of such monsters of nature, and divels incarnat of men, who glory in making themselves guilty of these foule sinnes, and crying crimes, Adultery, Incest, Murther. So that Idiaques (who hath made himselfe a principall of this number, and a monster of Art in these sinnes) thinking here in Santarem to find more mercy and pity during his life, shall find lesse of both of them after his death. For the criminall Iudges of this Court who reverence and honour Iustice because Iustice doth daily and reciprocally performe the like to them, doe confirme the sentence of Coimbra , that the next morne he shall lose his head, but in detestation and execration of these his foule and bloody crimes, they adde this clause and condition thereto, that both his head and body shall be afterwards burnt, and his ashes throwne into the ayre, which gives matter of talke and admiration, not onely to Santarem but to all Portugall . And thus most pensively and disconsolately is Idiaques reconveyed to his prison where Church-men are sent him by the Iudges of that court, to direct his soule in her flight and transfiguration from earth to Heaven whom they finde (or at least they make) very humble, mournefull, and repentant. According to which sentence he is the next morning brought to the place of execution, which for the greater example and terrour to others, and of ignominy to himselfe, was before his owne house, wherein he had acted and perpetrated all his enormous crimes. Where the scaffold is no sooner erected, but there flocke an infinite number of people from all parts of the City, to be spectators of this last scene of his Tragedy. He came to the scaffold (betweene two Friers) in a sute of blacke Taffeta, a gowne of blacke wrought tuffe Taffeta, and a great white set ruffe, which yet could not be whiter than his broad beard: At this ascent on the scaffold, his grave aspect and presence engendred as much sorrow  & pity, as his beastly crimes did detestation in the hearts and tongues of the people, to whom (after hee had a short time kneeled downe and prayed) he made a short speech to this effect. That although the poysoning of his owne wife, and his adultery with his sons wife, were crimes so odious and execrable, as had made him unworthy any longer either to tread on earth, or to look up unto Heaven, yet although he deserved no favour of his Judges for his bodie, he humbly repented and begged some of God for his soule, and for the more effectuall obtaining thereof, hee zealously prayed all those who were present to joyne their prayers to his. Hee confessed that it was Marsillia's beauty which first (at the instigation of the devill drew him to that adultery with her, and this poysoning of his owne wife Honoria , whereof from his heart and soule, he now affirmed hee implored remission of God, of the Law, of his sonne Don Ivan , and of all the world, and prayed them all to be more godly and lesse sinfull by his example, and so kneeling downe, and praying a little whiles to himselfe, he rose up, and putting of his gowne, ruffe, and doublet, which hee gave to the Executioner, hee binding his head and eyes with his handkerchiefe, bade him doe his office, which he presently performed, and with one blow of the sword, made a perpetuall double divorce betwixt his head and his shoulders, his body and his soule; when presently according to his sentence, both his head and his body were then and there burnt and consumed to fire, and his ashes throwne into the ayre. And this was the deplorable life and death of De Perez, Idiaques , and Marsillia , of whom the spectators (according to their severall humours and affections) spake diversly, all condemning the bloudy cruelty of De Perez towards innocent Mathurina , and of Idiaques towards his vertuous wife Honoria . Againe, some pitied, and others execrated Marsillia's youth, beauty, and lust; but both sexes, and all degrees of people (as so many lines terminating in one Center) magnified the providence and Justice of God, in so miraculously and condignly cutting off these monsters of nature, and bloudy butchers of mankinde. And if the curiosity of the Reader will yet farther enquire, what afterwards became of Don Ivan ; The reports of him are different, for as first I heard that his discontent and griefe was so great, yea, so extreame for the death of his Parents and wife, that he cloistered himselfe up a Capuchin Fryer in their Monastery at Madrid : So contrariwise I have since credibly beene enformed, that he shortly after these disasters left Spaine , and still lives in Santarem in Portugall in great honour, welfare, and prosperity; But which of these his resolutions are most inclining and adherent to the truth, it passeth beyond my knowledge, and therefore shall come too short of my affirmation. GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable Sinne of Murther. History XVII.  Harcourt steales away Masserina , his brother Vimoryes wife and keepes her in Adulterie; She hireth Tivoly (an Italian Mountebanke) to poyson La Precoverte , who was Harcourts wife; Harcourt kils his brother Vimory , and then marries his widdow Masserina; Tivoly is hanged for a robbery, and at his execution accuseth Masserina for hiring him to poyson La Precoverte , for the which shee is likewise hanged; Noel (who was Harcourts man) on his death-bed suspecteth and accuseth his said Master for killing of his brother Vimory , whereof Harcourt being found guilty, he is broken alive on a wheele for the same.  sinne, yea what an execrable crime is it therefore for one (out of the heate of his malice or fumes of his revenge) to poyson, or murther another, sith Nature doth stronglie impugne, and Grace (with a high hand) infinitely contradict it. Therefore were not our hearts and understandings either wholly deprived of Common sence or our soules of the gratious assistance and favour of God, wee would not thus so furiously and prophanely make our selves guilty of these infernall sins, but rather (with our best endevours) would seeke to avoid them as Hell, and (with our most pious resolutions) to hate and detest them as the Divell himselfe who is the prime Authour and Actor thereof, But some such monsters of Nature, and Disciples of Sathan there are here on Earth. A fearefull and lamentable Example whereof this ensuing History will shew us. The which may all good Christians read to Gods glory, and remember to the instruction of their Soules. Sens in the Dutchy of Burgundy (which is honoured with the title and See of an Archbishop) where (within these few yeares) there dwelt and died an aged Gentleman, (more Noble by birth, than rich in Estate and Demaynes) termed Monseiur De Vimory , who left onely two sonnes behinde him, the eldest named Monseiur De Harcourt , and the second Monseiur De Hautemont , who were two very proper young Gentlemen, excellently well bred and qualified, as well in Arts as Armes, or in any other vertue or perfection which was requisite, both to shew and approve themselves to bee the sonnes of their father. And (to content my Reader with their characters) Harcourt was tall, but not well favoured, but of a milde and singular good disposition; Hautemont was of a middle stature, neatly timbred, of a sweet and amiable countenance, but by nature hasty and head-strong; Harcourt had a light Aubrnn beard, which (like a Countrey Gentleman) he wore negligently after the Ovall cut; Hautemont had a coale blacke beard, which (Courtier-like) he wore in forme of an invaled Pyramides; Harcourt was thirty two yeares of age, very chaste and honest; Hautemont was twenty five, but many times given to women, and ready to bee deboshed and drawne away by any; though but of an indifferent quality and complexion. To Harcourt (the eldest son) their father gave his chiefest Mannor house, with eight hundred Crownes of yearely Revenew, and all his Goods and Chattels. To Hautemont (his second son) he gave his second Mannor house, worth foure hundred Crownes yearely, and fifteene hundred Crownes in his purse, by his Testament: Estates, which though it came short of their bloud, yet it exceeded that of most of the Gentlemen their neighbours, and is held in France at least the double, if not the triple of as much here with us in England . So having neither the happinesse, or the care to be accompanied with any sister or other brothers, they interchangeably sweare a strict league of brotherly love and deare affection each to other, which by their Vertues and Honours they sweare shall never receive end, but with the end of their lives: They many times consult together for the conduction and improving of their Estates, which they promise to manage with more frugality than lustre, and with more solide discretion than vaine ostentation or superfluity, and not to live in Paris , or to follow the Court, but to build up their residence in the Countrey. To which end they cut off many unprofitable mouths, both of servants, horses, and hounds, which their father kept. They likewise vow each to other to bee wonderfull charie and carefull in their mariages, as well fore-seeing and knowing it to be the greatest part of their earthly felicity or misery. So here we may see and observe many faire promises, rich designes and resolutions, and many sweet covenants voluntarily drawne up betweene these two brothers, which if they make good and performe, no doubt but the end thereof will bee successefull and prosperous unto them, or if otherwise, the contrary. But before I wade farther in the streame and current of this History, I must first declare, that by the death of Vimory the father, and by the custome of France , we must now wholly abandon and take away the title of Hautemont from the second brother, futurely to give him that of Harcourt the eldest, and that from Harcourt the eldest, to give him that of Vimory their father, for (by the right and vertue of the premised reasons) these are now become their proper names and appellations, which the Reader is prayed to observe and remember. A yeare and halfe is not fully expired and past away since their father past from Earth to Heaven, but the eldest brother Monseiur De Vimory being extreamly ambitious and covetous of wealth, and understanding that a rich Counsellor of the Court of Parliament of Dijon , named Monseiur De Basigni was dead, and had left a very rich widow, (of some forty yeares of age) named Madamoyselle Masserina , he earnestly seekes her in marriage. Shee is of short stature, corpulent and fat, of a coale-blacke haire, and if fame towards her bee a true and not a tatling goddesse, she hath, and still is, a lover of Venus , and a Votaresse who often sacrificeth to Cupids lascivious Altars and Shrines Harcourt is very averse and bitter against this match for his brother. They have many serious consultations hereon: Hee alleageth him the inequality of her age and birth in comparison of his, her corpulency, the ill getting of her Husbands goods, who was held a corrupt Lawyer, and (as the voyce of the world went) who gained his wealth by the teares and curses of many of his ruined and decayed Clients; and when he saw that nothing would prevaile to disswade his brother from her, he rounds him in his eare, that it was spoken and bruted in Diion , that she was not as chaste as rich, nor so continent as covetous; Vimory is all enraged hereat, and chargeth Harcourt his brother to name the reporters of this foule scandall vomited forth (quoth he) against the vertues and honour of chaste Masserina; Harcourt replies, that hee speakes it wholly upon fame, no way upon knowledge, much lesse upon beleefe; so Vimory being wilfully deafe to his brothers advice and requests, (and preferring Masserina's wealth to her honesty) hee marries her. But shee is so wise for her selfe, as first (both by promise and contract) shee ties him to this condition; that he shall receive all her rents, which are some twelve hundred Crownes per Annum , she to put her ready money to Use into whose hands she pleaseth, and he also to have the one halfe of the interest money, but the principall still to remaine in her owne right, propriety, and possession, and as well in her life as death, to be wholly at her owne disposing. Not long after Harcourt being at a great wedding (of a Gentleman his Cousin Cermaine) at the City of Troyes (in Champagne ) he there at the balles (or publike dancing) espies a most sweet and beautifull young Gentlewoman, whom he presently fancieth and affects for his wife: He enquires what shee is, and findes her to be named Madamoyselle La Precoverte , daughter to an aged Gentleman of that City, tearmed Monseiur de la Vaquery. Harcourt courts the daughter, seeks the father, finds the first willing, and the second desirous; but at last he plainly and honestly informes Harcourt , that his daughters chiefest wealth, are her vertues and beautie; that he hath not much land, and lesse mony; that hee hath two great suits of Law for store of Lands depending in the Parliament of Diion , which promise him store of money, and that he will futurely impart a great part thereof to him, if he will marrie his daughter, the which (for the present) he tels him, he is content to make good & confirme to him both by bond & contract. Harcourt loves his faire young Mistresse La Precoverte so tenderly and dearly, as he is ready to espouse her on those tearmes, but he will first acquaint his brother Vimory therewith, and take his advice therein. Vimory informes his brother Harcourt , that he knowes Monseiur Di Vaquery , of Troyes , to be a very poore Gentleman, that most of his lands are morgaged out, and in great danger never to be redeemed, that his law suits are as uncertaine, as the following thereof chargeable. Harcourt extols the beauty of La Precoverte to him to the skie, Vimory replies, that beauty fades and withers with a small time, and that those who preferre it to wealth, are many times enforced to feed on repentance in stead of content and joy, and to looke poverty in the face in stead of prosperity. But Harcourt having deeply setled his affection on La Precoverte , he rejecteth this true and wholesome dounsell of his brother, and so marries her: When forgetting his former promise to his brother, hee in a small time turnes a great Prodigall, abandoneth himselfe to all filthy vices, and beastly course of life, and as a most deboshed and gracelesse Husband (within one yeare) hee for no cause quarrelleth very often with this his faire and deare wife, then whom neither Champagne nor Burgundie had a more beautifull or vertuous young Gentlewoman; shee was of stature tall and slender, of a bright flaxen haire, a gratious eye, a modest countenance, a pure Lillie-roseat complexion, of a milde nature, and sweet disposition, respectfully courteous to all the world, and exceedingly devout and religious towards God, as perpetually making it her practise, delight, and glory, to consume a great part both of her time and of her selfe in prayer, and in the service of God. And although she were formerly sought for in mariage by many as good Gentlemen as Harcourt , yet she could fancie none, nor affect any man for her husband but himselfe. Never wife was more carefull or more desirous to please a husband than she, and as (for one whole yeare) it was her former content and joy to see him to be a provident, kinde, and loving Husband to her, so now it is her matchlesse griefe and calamity, to see his good nature perverted, his resolutions transported, and his affections drowned in deboshed and vitious company. She leaves no sweet advice, nor courteous requests and perswasions unattempted to reclaime him from these his foule vices of drunkennesse, swearing, dicing, evill company, and whoredome; for of no lesse sinnes in quality, nor fewer in number, she (with extreame griefe and sorrow) sees him to be guilty: But all this will not prevaile, no nor her infinite teares and sighs which many times she spends and sheds to him both at boord and bed, yea, and sometimes on her knees, but still (with a wretched violence, and sinfull impetuosity) he goes on in his vitious courses, and ungodly life and conversation; neither caring for his health, or his estate and meanes, but wilfully neglects the first, and prodigally wastes and consumes the second, whereat she wonderfully grieveth and lamenteth. She often requesteth Vimory his brother, and La Vaquery her father to perswade and divert him from these his ungodly Courses and enormous vices, which threatens no lesse than the vtter ruine, and inevitable shipwracke of all their fortunes: but they likewise cannot preuaile, although his Brother Vimory (with whom they live and sojourne) every houre and time he sees him, doe strongly deale and labour with him to that effect: For now he giving no limits to his vices and prodigalities, he sels away his lands peece-meale, whereat his brother Vimory stormeth and rageth against him, and his vertuous sweet wife most pitifully weepeth and lamenteth. But as a base Gentleman, and a most unkinde and ungrateful Husband, he laughs at her teares, smileth at her sighes, and contemneth  & scorneth both them and her selfe. And it nowfalling out, that La Vaquery her father losing both of his Law suits at Diion , where they (by the votes  & sentence of that Court of Parliament) are adjudged against him, wherby he was utterly ruined both in his hopes and estate for ever; Harcourt he teat soslights  & neglects his wife, as he tearmes her beggers brat, threatneth to send her home to Troyes to her Father, and setting all at randome, cares not what becomes either of himselfe or her, who poore sweet Gentlewoman is so extreamely afflicted, and as it were weighed downe with all these calamities and miseries (especially with the vices and discourtesies of her husband) as in her heart she dayly wisheth, and in her soule hourely prayeth unto God, that she were out of this life, and in Heaven, infinitly lamenting and a thousand times a day repenting that ever it was her hard fortune to see her Husband, and her woefull chance to marry him. But how to remedie or redresse these her miseries shee knowes not. For now doe her Husbands vices and prodigalities make him daily grow poorer and poorer, in so much (as in lesse than three yeeres) hee is become the shame of himselfe, the contempt of his enemies, the pittie of his friends and Kinsfolkes, and the extreame griefe of his sweet and deare wife, so that hee hath well neere spent all, and almost left nothing to maintaine himselfe, much lesse to maintaine her, whose griefes are so great, and sorrowes so infinite, as her roseat cheekes now looke thinne and pale, her sweet eyes are become obscure and dim, yea, and in so pitifull and lamentable a manner, that she fals exceedingly sicke, and her discontent and disconsolation is almost so remedilesse, as she would, but cannot be comforted, for that her Husband whom she thought would have proved the argument of her joy and prosperity, is now become the cause of her endlesse griefe, and the object of her matchlesse calamity and misery. Thus leaving her sorrowes, sighs and teares, to bee diminished through time, or dissipated and defaced by God, The order of our History invites and conjures me now againe to speake of this her base and deboshed Husband, who hath many beastly and bloudy parts to act herein. Whose lewd life and prodigalities enforcing him now to behold poverty, because heretofore he disdained to looke on frugality and providence. Seeing his wealth wasted, his lands either sold or morgaged, himselfe forsaken of his brother and friends, his reputation lost, his debts great, his creditors many, and who now began to grow extreame clamorous and scandalous to him: Hee knowes not which way to looke, or how or where to turne himselfe, to finde out some invention and meanes to repaire the decayes and ruines of these his miserable fortunes, and so to beare up and screw himselfe againe into the eye and repute of the world. When his necessity gaining upon his heart and nature, and Satan upon his Conscience and Soule, he knowing his brothers wife Masserina to be rich and wanton, hee will become so unfaithfull to his owne wife, so ingratefull and treacherous to his owne brother, and so dishonourable and ignoble to himselfe, as to attempt to gaine her affection from him, and to draw her to his owne lewd and lascivious desires, whereon his irregular hopes did more than partly grow confident, because he flatters himselfe with this true, yet foolish beleefe, that as he was seven yeares the younger, so hee was twice seven times a properer man than his brother. When taking time at advantage, as his brother and her husband Timory were rid to Dilon , he finding her in a wonderfull pleasant humour, and exceedingly disposed to be merry, when (God knowes) his owne sweet and sorrowfull wife, was (according to her frequent custome) disconsolutely at her prayers and booke in her owne chamber, and her doore shut to her, then, then I say, hee taking his said sister in law Masserina to a window in a private Parlor, hee there (for himselfe, or the devill for him) breaks his minde to her, and is so farre from shame, as he glories to make her acquainted with his deepe affection,  & lascivious suit to her: Neither doth he faile of his hopes, or they of his voluptuous desires, for he findes this his sister in law so dishonestly prepared, and so lustfully resolved and disposed to grant him his desires, that sealing her affection to him with many smiles, as he did his to her with more kisses, she is so impudent, so gracelesse, as at this his very first motion, she vowes to him she hath not the power to deny him any thing, and therefore most cheerfully and willingly gives him her heart and her selfe, and hee doth the like to her, which they mutually ratifie and confirme betweene them with many private kisses, and amarous daliances, as also with many secret protestations, and solemne oaths: But because Satan is, therefore God will not be present at this their vitious contract, and lascivious combination. Thus Harcourt and his sister in law Masserina , having no regard to their honours or reputations, to their hearts or consciences, to their soules or to God, he pollutes his brothers bed in possessing his wives body, and makes it both his delight and practise to defile and contaminate his glory, in that of her shame, and of his owne infamy. And now his pockets and purse are againe fill'd and cramm'd with coine, for he gives her kisses for her gold, and she returnes him gold for his kisses. Hereupon he puts himselfe againe into new and rich apparell, but yet is so base, unkinde, and ingratefull to his owne sweet and vertuous wife, that hee will give her neither gold nor new apparrell, but permits her to goe in her old. But to adde more miseries to her misery, and more new griefes and calamities to her old (because shee is equally an eye sore both to himselfe and to her) hee will no longer permit her to live with him, that he may the more often and the more freely and securely familiarize with his old sister, or rather now with his new love Masserina: So (without any regard to her birth, or respect to her youth and vertues, or without considering that God had made her his wife, and therefore the other halfe of himselfe) he sends her home to her father at Troyes , giving her but a poore little nagge, and a tagged foot-boy, onely with so much money as could hardly carry her thither, giving her neither money nor apparell, nor any thing else which was beseeming or fit for her, although through the blacke and obscure clouds of his vices and ingratitude, the bright and relucent Sun-beames of her excellent perfections and vertues in her selfe, and of her constant affection to him, will for ever most radiantly resplend and shine to all the world, especially to those who had the honour to know her living, or who shall now or hereafter reade her History after her death. And never were those her sweet perfections and vertues either more conspicuous and glorious in her, than now at her enforced exile, and sorrowfull banishment and departure from her Husband: For although he were cruelly unkinde, or unkindely cruell to her, yet knowing and considering him to be her Husband, shee therefore holds it her duty and conscience still to attend and wait on him as his wife, and not, either so soone or so suddenly to separate her selfe from him. When her eyes see, her judgement knowes, her heart doubts, and her soule feares, that then more than ever his vices wanted her prayers, and his sins her vertues  & presence, to seeke to rectifie and reforme them. But although she descended so low from her selfe to him in her affection and humility, as with bitter sighs and teares to cast her selfe on her knees to begge and request him, that (as by the lawes of mariage and nature, and of conscience and grace) she was obliged and bound, so that she might enjoy the content and happinesse to live and die with him, being infinitely contented, and extreamly desirous, as she then affirmed, (and againe and againe repeated and confirmed to him) to participate and beare her part and share, as well in his poverty as prosperity, yet hee (as an ignoble Gentleman, and a base and vitious Husband) having wholly taken away his heart and affection from this his sweet and vertuous wife La Precoverte , and fully and absolutely given it to his lascivious sister in law Masserina , hee (I say) is so hard hearted, ingratefull and treacherous towards her, as (without any respect to her teares, or regard to her prayers) hee will no way permit her to live with him in St. Symplician or Sens , at his brothers, nor yet vouchsafe to bee pleased to goe and live with her to Troyes at her fathers: But here we may observe his malice in his disdaine, and his disdaine in his malice towards this deare and sweet young Gentlewoman his wife, (of whom God knowes, and the world sees, he is no way worthy) for he will grant her neither of these her two most reasonable  & loving requests, but indeed (rather as a devill than a man, and a tyrant than a Husband) he with thundring looks and speeches, commands her away his sight & presence, without once giving her so much as one poore kisse, as he was bound in affection, or (which is yet lesse) a poore farewell at their parting, as hee was obliged both in conscience and christianity. So this sweet disconsolate Gentlewoman (in a manner breaking her breast with her sighes and drowning her cheeks with her teares) only with her poore little nag and ragged footboy, is by her flinty hearted Husband turned out of his Brother Vimories house at Saint Simplician , and so in this slender manner, and base equipage enforced softly, discontendedly, and sorrowfully to ride home to the poore Gentleman her Father at Troyes , yea and such was the malice, and policy of Harcourt , her cruell Husband, that this sodaine departure of hers was purposely acted when his Brother Vimorye , and his wife Masserina were at another mannour house of his some eight leagues off, to the end, that they might not see, or take leaue of her nor she of them, so allowing our sweet and sorrowfull La Precoverte by this time at Troyes with her aforesaid Father; I will for a time there leave her, to the exercise of her patience, to the pietie of her prayers, and to the pleasure and providence of God. Now doth our disloyall and treacherous Harcourt , at his pleasure frolique it out in Saint Simplician with his lacivious Sister in Law, and Strumpet Masserina , yea they are now growne so impudent, so carelesse, so gracelesse, in these their obsc aene Dalliances, that if Vimorye the Husband and Master doe not, yet his Seruants cannot choose but take deepe notice and exact and perfect Knowledge thereof; Onely he obserues a late alteration in his Brothers fortunes, that he is become farre braver in his apparell then accustomed, and hath more store of Crownes in his pocket at his command then heretofore, both to play and spend at his pleasure. Onely from whence this his golden Myne should proceed hee knowes not; except having heretofore made some progression, and experiments in the Chymicall Science (or mistery of Alchymy) he had now found the Elixar of the Philosophers Stone, but his curiosity in this Qu aere proceeds no further, much lesse his Iudgement, but least of all his Suspition of Ielousie. But the gracelesse Vanity and Ambition of Harcourt will yet flye a pitch and degree higher in the ayre of Ingratitude and treachery towards his Brother Vimory , For a little gold cannot redeeme his Lands, nor make vp the mony and great breaches of his former prodigalities, neither will a few kisses and embraces of that lustfull Dame his Sister Masserina appease his unchaste appetite, or satisfie his insatiable lust, and lascivious desires. Wherefore at one time and cast, to set nature and honour at stake, and so commanding his heart and thoughts to trample on both of them, without any respect or regard to either, he contrives and assumes this vitious and treacherous resolution, that having already taken the actuall possession of her body, hee should then likewise doe so of her gold, yea of all her whole Estate, and so flye away with her, whose Estate (through his long dishonest familiarity with her) hee now knowes to bee great, yea farre greater then his Brother Vimorye her husband either ever knew or dreamt of; Wherefore with much superficiall affection, and artificiall flattery and insinuation, he no sooner breakes this motion to her, but her lustfull heart corresponding with his, and her lascivious desires likewise ayming and intending that way, she freely gives him her consent thereunto, and to that end shee very secretly drawes in all her monies and gold, together with all her plate, Rings, and Iewels most carefully, and privatly packes it up, and so they flye away together; In a morning when her Husband and his Brother was with his servants gone forth a hawling and hunting for all that day, he without ever making his wife, or she her husband once acquainted therewith. Vimorye is amazed, and La Precoverte extreamely perplexed and afflicted at the strangenesse of their (undreamt of) base clandestime departure; And although (in regard of his affection to his wife) he were once resolved, to send and make after them for their stay and apprehension, yet at last, to avoid the vniversall scandall of the world (which thereby insteed of stopping one tongue, would assuredly let loose many,) hee leaves the successe of this treacherous Accident to Time, and the due reward and true punishment thereof to God. Now the first place of safety and shelter which Harcourt and Masserina flye unto, is the strong citty of Geneva (which depends not of France , or Savoye , but of God, and it selfe) where they take two chambers, and live together, having no servant at all to attend or follow them, but only Noell , who for many yeares before had beene, and still was his man. But to live here in Geneva with the more privacy and assurance (because they observe it to be a Citty, exceeding politiquely, vertuously and religiously governed) they finde out this excuse for their stay, that hee is heire to some lands (which by the death of an vnkle of his) is devolved and fallen to him in the estate, and dutchy of Millan (betwixt Pavia and Alexandria ) whether hee goes to sell it away, in regard (as he falsly alleageth) that both this Gentlewoman (whom hee resolves to leave there, and presently upon his returne to marry) and himselfe are Protestants, and for a moneth or six weakes, this false glosse, and true imposture passeth current with those of Geneva , whom all that time they freely permit and suffer to enjoy the lawes and previledges of Hospitality in their city, and the sooner, (and with far lesse suspition  & doubt) because they observe, that they very often frequent their Sermons, and Churches, although in their hearts and devotions, God knowes, they both are directly Roman Catholiques. But at the end of this small time, understanding that the two Syndicks and the rest of the Magistrates of that City beganne to pry more narrowly into their stay, and more neetely into their actions; Then they thinking to mocke with God and their soules, and so to make Religion onely to be a cloake to overvaile their villany, he then and there resolves to marry her before he goe to Millan , (which indeed affords sweet musicke to the heart, and melody to the thoughts and minde of this lascivious dame Masserina the which shee esteemed to be the chiefest felicity she could desire upon earth) excusing the alteration of this his resolution upon her sickenesse and indisposition (which also was as false and counterfeit, as the pretence of their protestant Religion was feigned and hipocriticall) and to that end he acquaints the Ministers and the Ancients of the Church therewith; But they being as regular in their actions as hee was exorbitant, and as pious in their intentions as he was prophane in his, question him to shew some authenticall certificat from that Protestant Church or Churches in Poictou (where they aver they formerly dwelt) that they were both of them Protestants by religion, and that their marriage was honourable and no way clandestine; affirming to him, that it was against the rules of their religion, the Constitutions of their Church, and the lawes of their City, to doe otherwise, either to them, or to any strangers whatsoever; Which Harcourt well perceiving. He now comes too short in his arithmeticke, and having none to shew them in that nature, hee swears under the saddle; and so slackes his importunacy therein, and puts it off with a specious excused dilatory delay; When acquainting his Masserina therewith, they both are equally afflicted and grieved, thus to see their hopes nipt, and their expectations and desires of marriage frustrated, and blasted in the very bud and blossomes; and now they see that their abode and stay in Geneva , neither can, nor must be long. But here betides them another unlooked for accident which will speedily transport them thence; It is the pleasure and mercy of God, that Noell (Harcourts man) is not a little grieved in heart, and afflicted in mind, to see his master guilty of this foule and treacherous crime, in stealing away Masserina his Brothers wife, and entertaining and using her as his owne. Hee knowes how infinitely this their adultery is displeasing to God, and odious to men, and how opposite and repugnant it is to Grace and Nature. Wherefore holding it a trouble to his minde, a vexation to his heart, and a scruple to his conscience any longer to attend and follow them, because he is assured, that the divine Justice and vengeance of God, will never permit them to goe long either undetected or unpunished, He calling to his remembrance the sweet vertues and chastity of his Mistris La Precoverte , and (by opposition and Antitheses) comparing them to the foule vices and whoredomes of Masserina , hee out of his duty to the first, and detestation to the second, though a bad Servant to his Master, yet was a good Christian to God, gives his Mistres La Precoverte very secret intelligence, of his masters lascivious residing and living here in Geneva with Masserina , whereof he sends her word, he is a very sorrowfull and unwilling eye witnesse, and so leaves the reformation thereof, first to God, and then to her selfe. Our vertuous sweet Gentlewoman La Precoverte , is wonderfully afflicted and grieved, at this foule crime of adultery betwixt her Husband, and his Sister Masserina , whereat her chaste heart towards him, and her pure and religious soule towards God, makes her send many teares to earth, sighes to heaven. Once she thought to acquaint her brother Vimory herewith, but then fearing that his just choller might peradventure exasperate him against her Husband, she againe as soone forsakes that opinion and intent, as holding it more discretion and safety to be silent herein towards him. And yet consulting her griefes and afflictions with God (whose sacred advise and assistance how to beare her selfe in this action and accident, shee religiously implores) she at last deemes it a part both of her affection, duty, and conscience, to use her best zeale and endevours to reclaime them from this their abhominable, and beastly course of life. And in regard her poverty, weaknesse, and sicknesse will not (according to her desires and wishes) permit her to ride over to them in person to Geneva , shee therefore commits and imposeth that charge to her pen, to write both to her Husband Harcourt , as also to his lewd Sister, or rather his lascivious Strumpet Masserina , to see if her letters (by the permission and providence of God) may prevaile with their hearts and soules to reforme and draw them home, the which she purposely, and expressly sends by a confident messenger, and with the greatest secresie she possibly can devise. Her Letter to her Husband intimated this?  displeasing to God, as I cannot but wonder that his divine Iustice wil permit Geneva , or any other place of the world to containe you without punishing you for it; yea when in this foule crime of yours, I consider her by my selfe, and you by your Brother Vimorye , I finde that his griefe proves my shame, and my shame his griefe, and that you and her are the true causes of both. I have examined my thoughts and actions, my heart and soule, and cannot conceive that I have any way deserved this your ingratitude towards me, and therefore faile not to certifie me why and wherefore you have undertaken this vitious and lewd course of life, which in the end will assuredly produce thy misery, as now already it doth your infamy, except your contrition to God, doe speedily redeeme it. And in regard that you are my Husband, and that I both hoape and beleeve it to be the first fault in this kinde and nature, I therefore hold you more worthy of my pitty than of my hatred, and of my prayers then of my curses. So if you will abandon your deboshed Sister, and come home and live with me who am thy chaste and sorrowful wife, my armes and heart shall bee as open as ever they were, both to receive and forgive you, yea, I will wholly forget what is past, and prepare my selfe to welcome you home, with a thousand Smiles and Kisses, if you will resolve and remember henceforth to love mee as much, as formerly (without cause or reason) you have neglected and hated me. La Precoverte.  Her Letter to Masserina , bewrayd these passions.  abuse thine owne Husband, but that thou must likewise bereave me of mine, who is his owne and onely Brother, as if a single sinne and ingratitude, could not content thy lascivious lust, or satisfie thy inordinate desires: but that thy impiety to God, and prophanenesse and obscenity to thy selfe, should make thee guilty of so foule a crime as Adultery; and which is worse, of such a foule and base Adultery as comes very neere to the worst kinde of Incest; wherof thy thoughts and heart can informe thee, and thy conscience and soule assure thee, it will hereafter make thee as truely miserable, as now thou fasly thinkest thy selfe happy. Wherefore triumph not, to have made my griefe thy glory, and my affliction thy felicity, for God (who is as just, as powerfull) will requite my wronges in thy Person, and when thou least dreamest thereof, his Divine punishments will sharpely scourge and revenge thy lascivious pleasures, except thou deject and prostrate thy selfe at the feet of his sacred mercy with true contrition, and at the Altar of his saving Grace with unfeined repentance for the same, by restoring my Husband to me, and thy selfe to thine, and by making thy peace with God, whom so highly and hainously thou hast therein offended, which if thou doe, thou mayest then reestablish thy fortunes, and redeeme thy reputation, or els for ever assuredly ruine both them and thy selfe. So if I see thee to imbrace this chaste, and to follow this vertuous and religious course, I will againe assume the name of a Sister and leave that of a Strumpet towards thee, yea, I will wholly forget these thy (almost unpardonable) wrongs and disgraces which thou offerest mee, and for ever bury them in perpetuall silence, and eternall oblivion. La Precoverte.  Her Messenger arriving at Geneva , he first findes out Noell , and then secretly delivers these two Letters to Harcourt and Masserina , who much musing and more wondring thereat, withdrawing themselves into their Inner Chamber, they there breake up the seales and peruse them; Whereat their hearts galled, and their Consciences so netled and stung as they cannot refraine from blushing for meere shame, and then againe, from not looking pale with meere anger thereat. Thus looking stedfastly each on other, their owne guiltinesse doth for the time present somewhat afflict and perplex them. Harcourt wondereth at his wifes boldnesse in writing to him; and Masserina is not a little dismaid and daunted to see that her husband hath not written unto her. Harcourt is discontented with his wifes peremptory Letter, Masserina is apprehensive and fearefull of her husbands silence, when againe changing their conceits and thoughts which inconstantly alter, and extravagantly range, without any intrinsicall peace, or tranquility. Harcourt thinking of his Brother Vimoryes silence, attributes it to contempt and hatred, and Masserina contemplating and ruminating on her sister La Precovertes choller, reputes it to extreame griefe, sorrow and Indignation; But at last consulting together hereon, they both of them concurre and fall upon this resolution; that to colour out their lascivious life, they by their answers to her, must overvaile it with much seeming chastity, and pretended sanctity and piety. And the better to prevent any danger which may proceed from Vimories silence, or revenge, they must remove from Geneva and speedily resolve to forsake and leave it; When feare giving life to their despaire, and despaire adding wings to their feare, they call for pen and paper, and each returne La Pecoverte their severall answers by her owne messenger, who had strickt charge and command from her to see them, but not to dare once to speake or exchange a word with either of them, the which (according to his duty) hee very honestly and punctually performed, onely to shew her gratefulnesse to honest Noell , she gave precise order to him to render him many hearty thanks from her for his true respect and fidelity towards her, which shee would never forget nor leave unrecompenced, and yet all this while neither Harcourt nor Masserina were any way suspitious that it was their man Noell which gave La Precoverte intelligence of their residence in Geneva . Harcourts Letter to his wife was in these tearmes.  absence, for thou shalt finde as much joy thereof at my returne, as now thou beleevest and fearest the contrary. I have vowed to accompany my sister in law Masserina to our Lady of Loreto , which is the best Saint of the best Countrey of the world, Italy , (where we are now setting forwards from this towne of Geneva ;) to which holy Lady and blessed Saint, her Oraisons for her Husband, and mine for thee, are and shall be as repleat of pure affection and pietie, as thou imaginest they are of iniquity and prophanesse. True it is, I committed an errour in not acquainting thee with my departure, which I perceive thou esteemest a crime; but when shortly I shall be so happy to enjoy thy sweet company and presence, then my just reasons will justly enforce thee both to know and acknowledge, that that pretended crime of mine is lesse than an errour, and this errour lesse than nothing. And if thou wilt yet be farther inquisitive why, or from whence our journey was first derived, I pray let these generall tearmes content thy feare, and satisfie thy jealousie, that it was her devotion and conscience to God, not my desire or affection to her which gave life and birth to it; therefore I hold it rather an unmerited cruelty, than a condign penance, either for my heart to be tied to aske forgivenesse of thee, or my soule of God for this thy pretended crime of mine, whereof I am as innocent as thy feare and jealousie deemes me guilty. Therfore I allow of thy piety, I accept of thy prayers, yea, and I rejoyce in thy affection to entertaine, and thy resolution to welcome me home with thy smiles and kisses when I come, the which shall be, if not so shortly as thou expectest or I desire, yet as soone as reputation and goodspeed shal permit. Harcovrt.  Masserina's Letter to her sister in law carried these lines.  abused thine, for it is my pure zeale to God, and not any lascivious lust in my selfe which drew me to this devotion to see Loretto , and him (through his goodnesse) to the resolution honourably to accompany me thither, and therefore my heart defies that foule sinne of Adultery, and my soule detests that odious one of Incest, whereof I am farre more innocent than thou thinkest me guiltie. I am sorry for thy griefe, and I grieve for thy affliction, and am so farre from triumphing in the one, or glorying in the other, as I have given that to my thoughts with passion, and this to my minde with compassion, although I confesse I have small reason to place it so neere me, in regard thy jealousie is the sole authour, and my fidelity and chastity no way the cause thereof: wherefore I am so farre from fearing, as I love Gods justice, because as in other sinnes I have offended his Divine Majestie, so I am sure that in this I have no way incurred or merited his indignation, and doe most freely referre my fortunes and reputation to his sacred pleasure, but not to thy secret discontent, and ill grounded choller, from which (by the plea of a just proviso) I have all the reasons of the world to appeale, as also from that foule scandall and infamous Epithite of a Strumpet, which I thought thee too vertuous once to conceive, much lesse to name, but least of all for one sister in law (without cause or reason) to give to another: But thou art La Precoverte , therefore I forget this ingratefull crime of thine, and I am Masserina , therefore I freely and absolutely forgive it, and to doe thee as much right as thou hast done me wrong, I will silence it in eternall obscurity and oblivion. Masserina.  And is it not worthy of our observation, or rather of our detestation, to see how impiously these prophane wretches deny this their Adultery towards God, and also to La Precoverte , whom they have so hainously offended therewith, and which to Heaven and Earth, to God and his Angels, and to their owne hearts and consciences are neverthelesse as apparant as the Sunne in his brightest Meridian, yea, had they not wilfully fled from God, and presumptuously abandoned themselves to Satan, to contrive such irreligious excuses, and to frame such ungodly Apologies, for these their foule crimes and offences, and so to make Hypocrisie the veile of their Adultery, and the cloake to cover it from the light and sight of the world: And is it not a resolution worthy of a halter in this world, and of Hell fire in that to come, to attempt mariage, when the wife of the one, and the Husband of the other, are in perfect strength, and full of life and health, (especially Masserina's Husband Vimory ) as but right now to their shame, not to their glory, they understand by La Precovertes Letters to them. To the Magistrates of Geneva they are firme Protestants, and as they pretended, so they then (as they constantly affirmed) intended to live and die. To La Precoverte in their Letters they are sound Roman Catholikes, and in the sublimity and singularity of their zeale travelling towards the Lady of Loreto in devotion. O wretched Christians, or indeed rather O miserable wretches, thus with your hypocrisie to think to deceive God, when therein you onely deceive your owne selves and soules. For can there be a greater misery found by us on earth, or sent us by the devill from hell, to make Religion (which of it selfe is a precious and soveraigne Antidote) to become a fatall drugge, and a pernitious ingredient to poyson, not to preserve our soules, and so only to delight our earthly humours and affections, and to please our carnall desires and concupiscences? Of all sorts of men (after the Atheist and the murtherer) the Hypocrite is the veriest devill upon earth, and hee is so much the more wretched and execrable, in that he guilds over his speeches, life and actions with the seeming shew of piety and devotion, when God and his ulcerated conscience know, that he is nothing lesse. To be luke warme in religion, is to bee prophane, not religious: And as wine mixt with water is neither wine nor water, so he that is of two religions is of neither. For God who is still jealous of his owne honour, and of our salvation, will not onely have our soules, but our hearts to serve him, and not only our hearts, but also our tongues to glorifie him, that is to say, all our actions, and all our affections, not a peece of our heart, but he will have our whole heart, and not an angle or corner of our soule, but our whole soule: For in matters of his divine worship aud service, (which consists in that of our faith, and of his glory) he will not admit of any Rivall or Competitor, nor bee served in any other manner, than as he hath taught us by his sacred Word and Commandements, and instructed us by his holy Prophets, and blessed Apostles. But againe to Harcourt and Masserina , whose lascivious hearts and lewd consciences not permitting them to rest in assurance, or reside in security any where, the very day after they had dispatched the messenger with their Letters to La Precoverte , (holding Geneva no place for them, nor they for Geneva ) they trusse up baggage, and so with much secrecie leave it, and direct their course to the great and famous Citie of Lyons , (some two and twenty leagues thence) and which is the frontier Towne of France , and there they thinke to shrowd themselves among that great affluence and confluence of people which inhabite and aboord there from divers parts, and they make choice to live in this frontier Citie, because it is neere to Savoy , where if any danger should chance to betide or befall them, they might speedily and safely retire themselves there, and so lay hold on the law and priviledge of Nations, which is inviolable throughout all the world. At their arrivall at Lyons they take their chambers and residence neere the Arsenall, though for the two first nights they lie in Flanders-street. They have not beene in Lyons fifteene dayes, but there befell them an accident very worthy both of our observation, and of their remembrance, which was thus; A Gentleman of the City of Tholouse named Monseiur De Blaise , having some five dayes before treacherously killed his elder brother Monseiur De Barry , in the high way as they travelled together upon a quarrell which fell out betweene them, for having deboshed and clandestine stollen away his said elder brother De Barry's wife from him, and conveyed and transported her away with them: There was a privie search then made in Lyons , when that same night Harcourt and Masserina were upon suspition apprehended for them, and laid in sure keeping. But the next morning before the Seneschall and Procureur Fiscall, they justified their innocencie, by many who knew De Blaise , and so were cleared; but yet it gave them both a hot Camisado and fearfull Alarum, and left an ominous impression in their hearts and minds, whereof (for the conformity of the circumstances of this action with their owne) had they had the grace to have made good use, they had not (hereafter) made themselves so famously infamous, nor consequently this their History so prodigiously deplorable. Harcourt and Masserina whiles they stay here in Lyons (as guilt is still accompanied with feare) doe seldome goe forth their lodgings, and when they doe, they (for their better safety) disguise themselves in different apparell, and for her part shee goes still close masked, and muffled up in her Taffeta coyffe. Yea both of them make it their practise to frequent the fields often, but the Churches and streets seldome, as if their foule crime of Adultery had made them unworthy the communion of Gods Saints, and consequently all good company too worthy for them. He exceedingly feares his brother Vimory's silence and revenge, and she highly envieth and disdaineth her sister in law La Precovertes jelousie, and still that disgracefull word of Strumpet (which she upbraided her with, and obtruded to her in her Letter) strikes  & sincks deeply in her heart and remembrance, in such sort, that it so possesseth her thoughts with malice, and takes up her minde with choller & fierce indignation, as she vowes to her selfe not thus to let it passe in silence, or to vanish and die away in oblivion, quite contrary to that which her late Letter to her sister La Precoverte promised and spake. And here it is that the devill first begins to take possession of her heart, and by degrees to seize upon her soule, and to make her wholly to forsake God. For knowing La Precoverte to be wife to her brother in law and lover Harcourt , (whom she affects a thousand times dearer than her owne Husband, yea, than her owne life) shee is therefore so great a beame to hereye, so sharpe a thorne to her heart, and so bitter a corrasive to her content, as shee not onely assumes bad thoughts, but bad bloud against her: For vowing that none shall share with her in his affection, shee forgetting her Conscience and Soule, Heaven and God, is speedily resolved to cause her to be poysoned, her inraged malice being capable of no other excuse or reason but this, that it is impossible she can reape any perfect felicity or content in earth, till she have dispatch't and sent her to Heaven . To which end she insinuates her selfe into the acquaintance of two Apothecaries of that City, and deales with them feverally and secretly to effect this hellish businesse, for the which she promised either of them a hundred crownes of the summe in hand, and as much more when they have effected it, and fifty more to defray the charge of their journey, But the devill hath made her so crafty and subtile, as she still retaines from them, the name Masserina and the place Troyes where the party dwelt; There are good, and bad men of all countryes, faculties, and professions, these two Apothecaries are as honest as she is wretched, and as religious and charitable as shee is prophane and bloody, so the one denies her request with disdaine and choller, and the other with charity and compassion, alleaging her many pious considerations and reasons to divert and disswade her from this foule and bloody act, the execution whereof, though tacitely, yet infallibly threatneth (saies hee) no lesse than the utter subversion of her fortunes, and the ruine and confusion of her life in this world, if not likewise of her soule in that to come; So shee being hereat a little galled and stung in Conscience, to see that this great City of Lyons affoords poyson but no poysoners, to act and finish this her bloody project; The devill hath yet notwithstanding, made her so curious in her malice, and so industrious, and resolute in her revenge, as enquiring whether there were any Italian Empericke or Mountebancke in that City, (whom she thought might bee made fit and flexible to her bloody desires and intents) she is advertised, that there departed one hence some eight daies since, who is gone to reside this spring of the yeare at the Bathes at Pougges , a mile from the city of Nevers , his name being Signior Baptista Tivoly (whom I conjecture may derive his surname from that pleasant small towne of Tivoly , some twenty small miles from Rome, wherein there are many Cardinalls, country Pallaces, or houses of pleasure) being very skilfull in Mineralls, and in attracting the spirits and quintessence of divers other vegitives; Of a vaine glorious, and ambitious humour and disposition, and yet of a very poore estate and meanes, and such a one, as indeed Masserina holdes every way a fit agent and instrument for her turne and purpose. She is glad of this advertisement, and will neither give nor receive any truce from her heart, or her heart from her revenge before she have seene and spoken with Tivoly . The which to effect shee to Harcourt pretends a sodaine ach in her right arme, and so upon good advise tells him that she is very desirous to goe to the Bathes of Pougges by Nevers , there to stay some fifteene or twenty dayes at farthest; Harcourt (no way once dreaming, of her inveterate malice, and farre lesse of her revengefull and bloody intents towards the safety and life of his wife La Precoverte ) approves of her resolution and journey, but intreats her to be wonderfull carefull of her selfe, her health and safety, and proffereth to accompany her himselfe: she with many kisses, deerely thankes him for his care of her and affection to her herein; answereth him that his stay in Lyons will make her journey the more safe  & short, so she accepts of the man for the master, and only takes Noell along with her, who respects her so well, as he cares not for her fight, much lesse for her company: She arrives at Nevers , and (impatient of all delay) the next morning findes out Tivoly at Pougges , being a very tall man, of a cole blacke beard, and of a wanne and sullen countenance, shee by his Phisiognomie judgeth that her hopes will not be deceived of him; The second day she breakes with him about her hellish businesse and findes him tractable to her devillish intents: They proceed to this lamentable bargaine, and shee is to give him one hundred Crownes in hand, and a faithfull promise of a hundred and fiftie more when he hath effected it as also fiftie Crownes for the Charge of his journey, the which she limits at fifteene dayes, so having settled this her businesse, she now names the party to Tivoly whom she will have him to poyson, La Precoverte , to be the woman who resides and dwels with her Father Monseiur La Vaquery , a poore Gentleman in the Citie of Troyes in Champagne , and shee a young Gentlewoman of some twentie yeares of age, of a flaxen haire, and very sickly. When giving him a small Saphir Ring from her Finger, she therewith sweates him both to the performance, and to the secrecie of this murther, the which, armed by the Divell hee doth. When being exceeding glad of this his bloody imployment, which brings him store of gold, the which hee esteemes the Elixar of his heart, and the felicitie and glory of his life, and which indeed, was the maine businesse that brought him on this side the Alpes, from Italy to France . Thus without any feare of God or thought of Heaven or Hell, these murtherous and damnable miscreants have concluded and shut up this their bloody bargaine. Our poore sweet La Precoverte , having received her Husbands Letter from Geneva , and considering the contents thereof, as also that of her Sister in Law Masserina , she knowes not what to thinke either of their Letters or of themselves: she sees her letter to promise much zeale and devotion to God, and his much affection to her, and yet remembring his former unkindenesse, I may say crueltie, towards her, as also the manner of their base and clandestine departure, then she thinks the first to be false, and the second feigned, and therfore conceives she hath far more reasons to dispaire than to hope either of their Innocencie, or their returne; But this is her resolution, Harcourt , is her Husband, therefore shee will still love him dearely; She is his wife, and therefore shee will for ever pray for him, and his prosperitie religiouslie. Thus hoping and many times (with many heavie sighes and bitter teares) wishing and desiring his happy returne, and vertuous reformation, she in his absence lives pensively and sorrowfully with her Father, rather as a widdow than a wife, and such is her miserable Estate; and poore and sorrowfull fortune, that she well knowes not, whether she may more grieve or reioyce that God hitherto hath given her no Childe: For ah me, she is so invironed with afflictions, so incompassed with calamities; so assaulted with sicknesse, and so weighed downe with sadnesse and disconsolation, as shee reputes her life worse than death, and either wisheth her Husband at home with her, or her selfe in Heaven with God. But Alas, alas, deere sweet young Gentlewoman; little doest thou thinke or dreame (now thou desirest death) what a hellish plot there is contrived and intended against thy life by these two bloody Factors and Agents of the Devill, Tivoly , and thy Sister Masserina : O Masserina Masserina , the disgrace of thy name, the infamy of thy family, the shame of thy time, and the scandal of thy sexe. O how I want words not teares, to condemne thy cruell rage, and to execrate thy infernall malice and fury, thus to resolve to imbrue thy guilty hands in the innocent blood of thy chast and vertuous Sister in Law La Precoverte ; for was it not sinne and lust enough for thee to have heretofore bereaved her of the love and presence of her Husband, but that thou wilt now be so wretched and inhumane, as likewise to rob her of her life. O griefe, O shame, O pittie, that thou shouldest once dare to thinke thereof, much lesse to attempt it, I meane so lamentable a crime, and so bloody a fact, which assure thy selfe as there is a God in Heaven will never goe long unpunished in Earth. But I must proceed in this our sad and mournefull History, and therefore with an unwilling and trembling resolution, I am enforced to declare that this limbe of the Divell Tivoly , rides away to Troyes , where he speedily and secretly makes profession of his Empery. When understanding that Monseiur de la Vaquery is constantly in the Citie he (with an Italian impudence and policy) soone skrewes and insinuates himselfe into his Company. And as it is the vanitie of our times, and the weakenesse and imbecility of our Iudgements, (in any profession whatsoever) stil to preferre and respect strangers, before our owne Countreymen, so Monseiur de la Vaquery , hearing this Italian to devoure Latine at his pleasure, and rather to vomit than utter forth whole Catalogues of phisicall phrases which hee had stollen, not learnt from Aristotle, Galen , and Parecellsus , His ignorance beleeves him to be very learned, and therefore hee holdes him a most fit Phisitian, to cure his Daughter La Precoverte of her consumption, whereinto (as before) she was deeply and dangerouslie fallen, by the unparalleld griefes and sorrowes which she conceived, for her husbands former unkindnesse to her, but more especially, for his present absence and flight with his lascivious Sister Masserina . So (in a most unhappie hower) Her Father La Vaquery mentioneth it to Tivoly ; Which (being the only occasion and opportunitie hee gaped for) he freely promiseth him his best art and skill for her recovery, and the next day goes home to his house with him,  & visiteth his daughter; He findes her to be weake, leane, and pale, the which serves the better for his turne, to coulour out this his bloody purpose to her. When (if there had been any humanity in his thoughts, any Grace in his heart, or any sparke of religion or pietie in his Soule) the very sight of this sweet, this harmelesse, this beautifull young Gentlewoman would have moved him to compassion, and not with hellish crueltie to resolve to poyson her. But his sinnefull heart, his seared Conscience, and his ulcerated and virulent soule had (in favour of gold) made this compact with the Divell, and therfore hee will advance, and not retire in this his infernall resolution. Hee feeles her pulse, casts her estate in an Vrinall, receives thirty Crownes of her Father for her cure, and so bidding her to be of good comfort, he administreth her two pills, three mornings following, whereof (harmelesse sweet Gentlewoman) within three dayes after, shee sodainly dyes in her bed by night; Tivoly affirming to her sorrowfull Father and Friends, that before hee came to her, the violency, and inveteracy of her consumption, had turned all her blood into water, and exhausted and extenuated all the radicall humours of her life, which opinion of this base and bloody Italian Mountebanke past current with the simplicitie of his beliefe and their Iudgements: So he burieth his daughter and with her his chiefest earthly delight and ioy: Within three daies after that this sorrowful and lamentable tragedy was acted, This monster, this Divell incarnate Tivoly , leaves Troyes , and poasts away to Nevers , where he ravisheth Masserina's heart, with the joyfull newes and assurance of La Precovertes death and buriall, of whom he receives his other hundred and fifty Crownes, the which according to her promise shee failes not presently to pay him downe. And heere againe they solemnely sweare secrecie each to other of this their bloody fact. Wretched Masserina feasting her heart with joy, and surfeiting her thoughts with content to see the rivall and competitor in her loves, La Precoverte thus dispatched and sent for heaven, Shee now thinking to domineere alone in her Harcourts heart and affection esteemes her selfe a degree neerer to him in marriage, that so of his Sister shee may become his Wife. For this is the felicity and content whereat her heart aymeth, and the delectation and ioy wherein her desires and wishes terminate. But her Husband Vimories life doth dash these ioyes of hers in peeces, as soone as she conceives them, and strangles them if not in their birth, yet in their cradle. She finds Nevers to bee a pleasant Citie and Pougges a delightfull little place to live in and when the Spring is past and the great confluence of people retired and gone home, to bee a place of farre more safety for them than Lyons . Yea, and shee affects and loves it farre the better, because here it was she first heard and understood of La Precovertes death, which as yet for a time she closely conceales to her selfe; Wherefore shee sends Noell (her man) to Lyons to his Master, and by her letter prayes him speedily to come and live with her at Nevers , which shee affirmes to him is a pleasant City, and that there she attends his arrivall and company with much affection and impatiencie. Harcourt , to please his Sweet-heart-Sister Masserina , leaves Lyons and comes to her at Nevers , where with thankes and kisses, she ioyfully welcomes him, telling him that these bathes of Pougges , have perfectly freed her of her ache; but in her heart and mind, shee well knowes, it is the death of La Precoverte , and not those bathes, which hath both cured her doubts and secured her feares. They have not lived in Nevers and Pougges above three weekes since his arrivall, untill they there (but by what meanes I know not) understand of La Precovertes death, whereat hee seemes nothing sorrowfull, but she extreamly glad and ioyfull. And by this time, which is at least a whole yeare since their flight and departure from Saint Simplician and Sens , they in their Travells and other gifts and expenses, have consumed and expended a prettie Summe of their money. In all which time, wee must understand that Vimory hates his wife and Brother so exceedingly, as hee (in contempt of their crymes and detestation of their trecherous ingratitude) scornes either to looke or send after them; but the only revenge which he useth towards him in his absence he pretends a great Summe of money to bee due to him from him, and in compensation thereof, seizeth upon the remainder of his lands, and by Order of Iustice gathereth up, and collects his rents from his Tenants, to his owne use and behoofe. Which extreamely grieves Harcourt , and afflicts Masserina , who (by this time) seeing in what obscurity and considering in what continuall feare and eminent danger they live in, As their lascivious affections, so their irregular desires, and irreligious resolutions, looke one and the same way, which is to send her Husband, and his Brother Vimory to Heaven, after his wife La Precoverte , yea so resolute are they in this their bloody intentions and desires, as they wish and pray for it with zeale, and desire it with passion  & impatiency. And now their malice is growen so resolute, and their resolution so gracelesse in the contemplation and conceiving of this bloody fact, as they bewray it each to other. Masserina vowes to him that she can reape no true content either in her life or conscience, before, of his sister he make her his wife; Nor I replies Harcourt before my brother Vimorie be in Heaven, and I marry thee & be thy husband here in earth. When (as a bloody Courtisan and Strumpet) she gives him many thanks and kisses for this his affection to her, and malice to his Brother Vimory for her sake; when (working upon the advantage of time, occasion and opportunity) Shee tells him, that in her opinion, the shortest and surest way is to dispatch him by poison. Harcourt dislikes her judgement and plot, as holding it no way safe in taking away his brothers life, to entrust and hazard his owne at the courtesie of a stranger (at which speech of his, shee blusheth and palleth as being conscious and memorative of what she had lately caused to be perpetrated by Tivoly ) Therefore he thinks to acquaint and imploy his owne man Noell in this bloody businesse, and profereth him two hundred Crownes, and fortie more of yeerely pension during his life, if hee will pistoll his Brother Vimory to death as he is walking in the fields. But Noell is too honest a man, and too good a Christian to stabbe at the majesty of God, in killing man his creature and Image, and so absolutely denies his Master, and although he be a poore man, yet he rejects his offer, as resolving never to purchase wealth, or preferment at so deere a rate, as the price of innocent blood; whereat his Master bites his lip for discontent and anger. So he conjures him to perpetuall secrecie and silence of this proposition and businesse, which Noell promiseth but sweares not; Hereupon Harcourt to approach neerer to Sens , He and Masserina leave Nevers , and very secretly by litle Iournies (and the greatest part by night) come to Mascon , and there his heart strikes a bargaine with the Divell, and the Divell with his soule and resolutions, to ride over himselfe to Sens , and there with his owne hands to pistoll his Brother Vimory to death in the fields, or if his Bullets misse him, then to finish and perpetrate it with his owne Sword. O wretched Gentleman, O execrable Brother, thus to make thy Hope and Charitie prove bankrupt to thy Soule, and thy Faith unto God. But nothing wil prevaile with Harcourt , to diswade him from this bloody busines; Whereunto the damnable treacherie and malice of Masserina impetuouslie precipitates and hastens him onwards, although it be against her owne Husband. So he leaves Mascon , and in a disguised beard, and poore sute of apparell, comes to Saint Symplician purposely leaving Sens , a litle on his left hand. Where waiting for his Brother Vimory , at the end of a pleasant wood of his, a litle halfe mile from his house where he knew he was accustomed to walk alone by himselfe solitarily; He personating and acting the part of a poore begging Souldier, and counterfeiting his tongue aswel as his beard and apparel, with his hat in his hand (espying his Brother) he goes towards him with an humble resolution, and requesteth an Almes of him. Which Vimory seeing and hearing, hee in meere charitie and compassion of him, because he saw him to be though a poore, yet a proper man,  & which is more a Souldier, drawes forth his purse and whiles he lookes therein for some small peece of silver; Harcourt (as a Disciple of the Devill) very softly drawes out his litle pistoll out of his left sleeve (which he covered with his hat) and having charged it with two bullets, hee lets flie at him, and so shootes him in the truncke of his body, a little under the heart, of which two wounds he presently fell dead to the ground, being as unfortunate in his death, as his brother was miserable  & diabolicall in giving it him, for he only fetched two groanes, but had neither the power or happinesse to speake one word. And the Divell (in the catastrophie of this mournefull Tragedie) was so strong with Harcourt , as his malice towards his Brother Vimory , exceeded not onely malice but rage and fury it selfe, for fearing he was not yet dead, he twice ran him thorow the body with his sword. When leaving his breathlesse body all goring in his hot reeking blood, he with all possible celeritie takes his horse (which he had tied (out of sight) to a tree not farre off) and so withall possible speed gallops away to his now intended wife Masserina at Mascon , who triumphs with ioy at his relation of this good newes, the which to her, yea to them both, is equally pleasing and delectable. But God will not permit that these wretched joyes and triumphes of theirs shall last long. This cruell murther of Monseiur Vimory is some two houres after knowne at his house and Parish of Saint Symplician as also in the City of Sens , and so dispersed over all Burgundy , and the murtherers narrowly sought after, but in vaine; Harcourt and Masserina meet with these reports at Mascon , but yet they hold it discretion and safetie, a small time longer, to conceale themselves secretly in that Towne, and so to suffer the heate of this newes to passe over, and bee blowne away. But at the end of two moneths, Harcourt (setting a milke white face upon his bloody fact) arrives at Sens and from thence to his mannor house of Saint Symplician , which now by the death of his Brother Vimorye , who died without issue, wholly devolved and fell to him. Who having formerly plaid the Devill in murthering his said Brother, he now as infernally plaies the Hypocrite in mourning for his death making so wonderfull an outward shew and demonstration of sorrow for the same, as he and all his servants being dighted in blackes. A moneth after hee sends for his good Sister in Law Masserina , who comes home to him, and they seeme so absolutely strange each to other, as if they had never seene one another during all the long time of their absence, and shee likewise seemes to drowne her selfe in her teares, and is likewise all in blackes for the death of her Husband; But God in his due time will pull off this their false maske, and detect and revenge both their horrible Sinnes of Adulterie and Murther. Now as close as they conceale this their dishonourable fleight and departure, yet it discovered and found out, and held so odious, so foule, to all the Gentlemen and Ladies their neighbours (who yet know nothing of their murthers) as they disdaine to welcome them home, or (which is lesse) to see them, which they both are inforced with griefe to observe, as holding it to be the reflection of their owne disgrace and scandall, the which henceforth to prevent: they within two moneths after, sends for their Ghostly fathers, as also for two Iesuites, and the Vicar of their parish, and acquaint them with their desires and resolutions to marry: But these Ecclesiastiques affirme it to be directly opposite to the Rules and Canons of the holy Catholique Roman Church, for one Brother to marry the widdow of another, as also against the written law of God; and therefore they utterly seeke both to perswade and diswade them from it, as being wholly unlawfull, and ungodly, and so refuse to Consent thereto, much lesse to performe it without a dispensation from the Pope, or his Nuntio now resident at Paris . They cause the Nuntio to be dealt with about it, but hee peremptorily refuseth it; But in favour of money, and strong friends, within three monethes they procure it from Rome, and so they are speedily marryed, now thinking, and withall, beleeving and triumphing, that this their nuptiall knot, hath power to deface and redeeme all their former Adulteries, and now wholly wiped off their disgrace and scandall with the world. And therefore in their owne vaine and impious conceits, are secure, and abound in wealth delight, and pleasure; But as yet they have not made their peace with God. Come we therefore first to the detection and discovery of these their bloudy crimes of murther, and then to the condigne punishments which they received for the same: Whereof the manner briefly is thus. It is many times the pleasure and providence of God, to punish one sinne in and by another, yea and sometimes one sinne for another, the which wee shall now see apparant in this bloudy and hellish Itallian Mountebancke Tivoly , who repayring to the great Faire of Sens , and there beginning to professe his Emperie to a rich Goldsmithes wife of that City named Monseiur de Boys , hee the third day stole a small casket of Jewels and Rings from him out of a cupboarde, (the locke whereof he cunningly pickt, and shut againe) vallued at foure thousand Crownes, and the same night fled upon that robbery towards Mascon , thinking there to put himselfe on the River of Soan , and so to slip downe to Lyons , and from thence over the Alps into Italy . De Boys makes a speedy, and curious research for his thiefe, whom as yet he could not finde, or discover; When hearing of this Mountebancke Tivolie his sodaine departure and flight, he takes him to bee his thiefe, pursues him in person and within foure leagues of Mascon apprehends him, (having to that end brought two Provosts (or Sheriffes) men with him in their Coats, with their pistolls at saddle bow, to assist him) De Boys findes many of the Iewels and Rings about Tivoly , and divers others wanting, the which he could never recover: So being brought backe to Sens , hee was first imprisoned, and then examined by the Senshall and the Procurer Fiscall: When having neither cause, nor colour to deny this robbery of his, hee therefore freely confessed it, the devill still assuring, or rather betraying his hopes, confidence, and Iudgement; That it is very possible, and he thinkes very probable and feaseable to corrupt his Iudges with some of the Iewels which hee had closly conceald and hid about him; But, he shall speedily see the contrary. For they seeing this Itallian Empericke (by his owne confession) guilty of this great and remarkeable robbery, they condemne him to bee hanged the very next day for the same. So having a Cordelier (or Gray) Fryer, sent him that night to pryson to prepare his soule for Heaven; Hee the next morning (according to his sentence of condemnation) is brought to his execution: Where on the Ladder, he (to free his Conscience and soule) doth constantly and sorrowfully Confesse, that hee had formerly poysoned Madamoyselle La Precoverte , daughter to Monseiur de La Vaquery of Troyes , and that he was hired to doe it by the Lady Masserina of whom at Pougges he received two hundred and fifty Crownes and a small Saphir Ring to performe it, as also fifty Crownes more, which she gave him for his charges from Nivers to Troyes , and so hee dies in the constant confession of this his foule and lamentable murder, and is hanged for his Robbery: and his body afterwards burnt for destroying and poysoning of this young Gentlewoman La Precoverte , whom many Gentlemen and Ladies there present well knew, and exceedingly bewayled, for the goodnesse of her sweet nature and pure beauty, as also for the excellencie of her honourable perfections and religious vertues; And although the Spectators of this wretch Tivoly his death expected some speech from him, at the taking of his last farewell of this world, yet (besides his former confession hee spake nothing, but mumbled out some few words to himselfe, which were not understood; And thus he lived wretchedly as he dyed miserably, giving no testimony of his contrition or sorrow to the World, or of any sparke of griefe, or repentance, towards God. Now before his body was fully consumed to ashes. This our Wretched and bloudy Gentlewoman Masserina , together with her old Lover but new Husband Harcourt , are (by order of the Judges of Sens ) apprehended and taken prisoners in their owne house of Saint Simplician , as they were walking and Kissing together, without any thought of danger, much lesse of death. They hereat looke each on other with griefe and astonishment, especially Masserina , who understanding (by some of those that apprehend them.) That it was the Italian Mountebanke Tivoly , who at his execution accused her, but not her Husband Harcourt for having and causing him to poyson her Sister La Precoverte , shee then sees her selfe to bee a dead woman, and no hope left her in the world of her life, But every way a firme assurance and confidence of her death; yet seeing Tivoly dead, she resolves to stand upon her Iustfication. Shee is all in teares at this her lamentable disaster, curseth the name and memory of Tivoly for ruining her, with himselfe, and now, when it is too late shee blames herselfe of indiscretion, for neglecting, and not dealing effectually with Tivoly in prison, to conceale this her fact and name. As for her Husband Harcourt , hee (knowing himselfe absolutely Innocent of this murther, hee grieves not for the death of his first wife La Precoverte , but now extreamely mourneth and lamenteth to thinke of this, of his second wife Masserina . for, live, hee feares she cannot. He bids her yet bee of good comfort, and whispereth her secretly in her eare that hee will give all his estate and meanes to save her life, or else that he will dye with her, shee thankes him with a world of sighes and teares, and rounds him as privately in his eare with many deepe oathes and asseverations, that her tongue shall never dare to speake any one word or sillable to her Iudges, which shall tend to the prejudice of his reputation, safety or life, and so they are by their apprehenders separated; and then severally conveyed to the prison of Sens: Masserina is first arraigned by the Iudges, where (according to her former resolution) she (not with teares, but with high words and speeches) stands upon her Innocency and Iustification, they informe her how strongly Tivoly at his death declared shee had given him two hundred and fifty crownes, a Saphir Ring, and fifty crownes more to pay his charges at Pugges and how he at her instigation, and in favour of this her gold poysoned La Precoverte at her father Monseiur La Vaqueris house at Troyes , She termes Tivoly witch and devill, yea worse then a thousand devils thus to accuse her fasly of this murther of her sister Precoverte , whereof she vowes to God and the world, to Earth and Heaven, that she is as Innocent as that damned Italian was guilty thereof; but the Iudges (notwithstanding all these her great fumes and crackes) doe presently condemne her to the racke, the which as soone as shee saw and considered the sharpe nature of those exquisite torments, then God was so mercifull to her soule by his grace, though shee was not so heretofore to her body by the perpetration of her foule sinnes, that shee would not permit her tender dainty limbes to be exposed to the misery of those cruell tortures, but then and there confesseth her selfe to bee the author of poysoning La Precoverte her sister, as Tivoly was the actor thereof, when being here by her Iudges farther demanded whether her last Husband Harcourt were not likewise accessary with her in poysoning of his first wife La Precoverte , shee with much assurance and constancy cleeres him hereof, and is so kinde and loving to him, as shee speakes not a word to them, of his pistolling to death of her first Husband his Brother Vimorey : So for this her foule and bloudy fact of hers she is condemned to bee hanged the next morning, and for that night againe returned to prison, where shee and her sorrowfull husband, make great suit to the Iudges that they may for a short time see and speake one with the other, but it will not be graunted them: When Harcourt being as confident of his owne life, as hee was of his wifes death, makes secret proffer (by some friends of his) to the Iudges of all his lands and demaynes to save his wife, but they (resembling themselves) doe so much feare God, and reverence and honour the sacred Name of Iustice as they are deafe to his requests. The next morning (according to her sentence) she is brought to the place of her execution, but (at her earnest and importunate request) so early, that very few people were present at her death, where being ascended the Ladder, she there againe cursed the name, and execrated the memory of that wretched Villaine Tivoly , and wished much prosperity and happinesse to her Husband Harcourt , when turning her eye about, and seeing a Cosen Germaine of his there present named Monseiur de Pierpont , shee cals him to her, and is so vaine at this last period (as it were) of her life, as she takes off her glove and bracelet from her right hand and arme, and prayes him to deliver it to his Cosin and her Husband Harcourt , and to assure him from her that shee dyed, his most loving and constant wife, which Monseiur Pierponte faithfully promised her to performe, then a Subordinate officer of justice being there to see her dye, tells her that hee was now commanded by the Iudges his Superiours, to tell her, that shee being now to leave earth, and so ready to ascend into heaven, they prayed her in the name and feare of God to declare to all those who were present, if her Husband Harcourt , yea or no, had any hand, or were knowing or accessary, with her in the poysoning of his first wife La Precoverte , and that shee should doe piously and christianly to discover the truth thereof, which would undoubtedly tend to Gods glory, and the salvation of her owne soule: When she solemnely vowed to him and to all the people, that her Husband Harcourt never knew, nor in thought, word, or deed, was any way accessary knowing or consenting with her or Tivoly in poysoning of his wife, and this which shee now spake was the pure truth as she hoped for Heaven; And now after a few teares, shee most vainely and idely fell praysing and commending of him, especially how tenderly and deerely hee loved her; with other ridiculous and impertinent speeches tending that way, which I hold (every way) unworthy of my mention and repetition (but had not the grace, either to looke up to heaven, or to God with repentance, or the goodnesse to looke downe into her owne heart, conscience or soule, with contrition and sorrow for all those her foule Adulteries and Murthers; Neither to pray to God for her selfe, or to request those who were present to pray to God for her; And so shee was turned over, all wondring and grieving at her bloody crime, and therefore some few lamenting or sorrowing for this her infamous death: But shee there speakes not a word, or the shadow of a word, either of her Husband Harcourts pistolling to death of his Brother her first husband Vimory , or of her knowledge thereof or consent thereunto. Now though Harcourt seemed outwardly very sorrowfull for this shamefull death of his wife Masserina , yet hee is inwardly exceeding Ioyfull, that her silence at her death, of murthering his Brother Vimory , hath preserved his life with his reputation, and his reputation with his life; Whereupon being the same day freed and acquitted by the Iudges of Sens ; both of his pretended cryme, as also of his imprisonment; Hee composing his countenance equally betwixt joy and sorrow, returnes to his house of Saint Symplician where now thinking himselfe absolutely discharged and cleered of all these his former Adulteries, as also of his late cruell murthering of his Brother; Hee within two (or at most within three moneths after his wife Masserinaes Execution casts of his mourning apparell, (which he wore for her death) and neither thinking of his soule or his conscience, or of heaven or hell, he flantes and froliques it out in brave apparell, and because hee is now fortunately arrived to bee chiefe Lord and master of a great Estate both in Lands and money, therefore hee thinkes it not his pride, but his glory, and not his vanity but his generosity to dight and put himselfe now into farre richer apparell then ever formerly hee had done, whereof all the Gentlemen his neighbours yea all the Citty of Sens , (with no little wonder) tooke especiall notice thereof; Yea hee is so farre from once dreaming or thinking either of his murthering of his Brother Vimorye , or of the deplorable and untimely ends of his two wives, as with much vanity, and with farre more haste then discretion or consideration, he now speedily resolves to take and marry a third. But his hopes will deceive them, because God in his sacred Iustice and Iudgements will deceive his hopes. For, when he thinkes himselfe secure and safe, not onely from the danger, but likewise from the suspition of any fatall or disasterous accident which can possibly befall him; then, the triumphant power of Gods revenge will both suddenly and soundly surprise him. His honest man Noell , (with an observant eye, and a Conscionable, and sorrowfull heart) hath heard of La Precovertes poysoning, and of Vimories pistolling to death, and hath likewise seene the hanging both of Tivoly , and of his last Mistris Masserina . In all which severall accidents, as one way hee wondereth at the malice of Sathan: So another way hee cannot but infinitely admire and applaud the just judgements of the Lords: Hee likewise knowes what his Master Harcourt is to him and hee to his master, and in the time of his service and attendance under him, what different and severall passages of businesse and secrets have past betweene them: Hee hath remarked farre more vices then vertues in his Master, whereat hee much grieveth, but hee was infinitely more enforced then desirous either to see or know them, and this againe doth exceedingly rejoyce him: Hee well knowes that fidelity is the glory of a servant, and yet it is a continuall sensible griefe to his heart, and vexation to his soule, to see that his Master serves God no better: Hee doth not desire to know things (which concerne his said Master) whereof hee is ignorant, but doth wish and pray to God that he were ignorant of many things which hee knowes, and of more which he feares; and being very often perplexed in his minde with the reluctation of these different causes, and their as different effects. Hee cannot but in the end of satisfie himselfe with this resolution: That as Harcourt is his Earthly Master, so God is his Heavenly Master; But here betides an unexpected and unwished Accident to this Noell , which will speedily try of what temper and mettall both himselfe, his heart, his conscience and his soule is made, and what infinite disparity there is betwixt Earth and Heaven. By the pleasure and visitation of God: Hee is suddenly taken extreame sicke of a pestilent Feaver, but not in his Master Harcourts house, but in his owne Fathers house, who dwelt some foure leagues thence at a parish called Saint Lazare , and his Phisition yeelding him a dead man, hee as a religious Roman Catholicke, takes the extreame Vnction, and then prepares himselfe to dye: But hee is so morall, and so good a Christian, as (the premises considered) he resolves to carry his conscience pure, and his Soule white and unspotted to Heaven. Hee prayes his Father therefore, that hee will speedily ride to Sens (in whose Iurisdiction Saint Lazare was) and to pray two of the three Iudges to come over to him, for that hee hath a great Secret to reveale them now on his death bed, which conduceth to the glory of God, the service of the King, and the good of his owne soule. His Father accordingly rides to Sens , and brings two of those Iudges speedily with him to his Sonnes bed side, to whom (in presence of three or foure more of his Fathers neighbours) hee very sicke in body but perfectly sound in minde, tells him, that his Master Harcourt would (heretofore) have had him pistoll his Brother Vimorye to death, and proferred him two hundred Crownes in mony, and forty Crownes Annuity during his life to performe it, but hee refused it, and knowing the said Mounseiur De Vimorye to bee since murthered by a pistoll, hee therefore verily beleeves, that it is either his said Master, or some other for him; which is guilty of that lamentable murther, the true detection whereof he saies he leaves to God and to them, and within halfe an houre after, (yea before they were departed his Fathers house) this Noell dies. Hereupon, these Iudges wondring at the providence of God, in the evidence of this dying man for the discovery of this lamentable murther. They speedily send away their officers who apprehend Harcourt in his owne house of Saint Simplitian , carowsing and froliking it in his best wine in Company of three or foure of his deboshed consorts and Companions, and so they bring him to Sens : Where lying in prison that night, the next morning the Iudges of that City cause him to bee arraigned before them; and Charge him with pistolling of his Brother Mounseiur De Vimorie to death, which (fortified and armed by the Devill) hee strongly and stoutly denies, they reade his man Noells dying Evidence against him, to prove it: So they adjudge him to the fiery torment of the Scarpines, for the vindication of this truth, the which hee endureth with a wonderfull fortitude and constancy, and still denies it: When their hearts being prompted from Heaven, and their soules from God: That hee was yet the undoubted murtherer of his Brother, they the second time adjudged him to the racke, whereon permitting himselfe to bee fastened, and the tormenters giving a good touch at him, God is more mercifull to his soule, then his Tortures are to his body, and so with teares in his eies, hee confesseth that it was hee which pistolled his Brother Vimorye to death, and which afterwards ranne him twice thorow the body with his Rapier: Whereupon for this bloody and unnaturall fact of his: His Iudges (without any regard to his extraction or quality) condemne him the next afternoone betweene foure and five of the clocke, to bee broken a live on the wheele at the publike place of execution: Some few Gentlemen his kinsfolke solicite his reprivall, because as yet they dispaire of his pardon, but their labours proves vaine, and they purchase no reputation in seeking it, for now all Sens and the adjacent Country cry fie on him, and on his foule and enormous Crymes of Adultery and Fratricide. So the next day, (at the houre and place appointed) hee is brought to his execution, where a mighty concourse of people both of Sens and the adjacent Country flocke to see, this monster of nature take his last farwell of this world: Being mounted on the Scaffold, in a Tawny Sattin sute with a gold edge: Hee confesseth himselfe guilty of murthering his Brother Vimorye , and yet hee grieves farre more for the death of his last wife Masserina then hee doth for that of his first, La Precoverte: Hee demands forgivenesse of God, and the world for this his foule crime of Fratricide and praies all who are there present to pray to Almighty God for the salvation of his soule, and that they become more charitable and religious, and lesse bloudy and prophane by his example: So commending his soule unto God, his body to the Earth from whence it came, and marking himselfe three or foure times with the signe of the Crosse, hee willingly suffers the Executioner to fasten his Legges and Armes upon the wheele, the wheele, the which as soone, as he breakes with his iron barre; untill hee have seized upon death, and death on him. And thus was the wretched lives, and miserable, and yet deserved deaths of these our cruell, and inhumane, gracelesse Murtherers, and in this manner did the Triumphs of Gods Revenge justly surprize them to their shame, and cut them off to their Confusion: May we read this History to Gods glory, and as often meditate thereon to our owne particular reformation and instruction. GODS REVENGE AGAINST, THE CRYING AND Execrable sinne of Murther.  Romeo (the Laquey of Borlary ) kils Radegonda , the Chamber maid of the Lady Felisanna in the Street, and is hanged for the same: Borlari afterwards hireth Castruchio an Apothecary to poyson her Husband Seignior Planeze , for the which Castruchio is hanged, and his body throwne into the River and Borlari beheaded and burnt.  with that glorious title and appellation, should so willfully and wretchedly lose it, by imbrewing their guilty hands in the innocent bloud of their Christian Brethren, and thereby to bereave our selves of that rich ornament, and inestimable Lewell, which God (in his Sonne Christ Iesus ) hath lent us for the planting of our Faith; and given us for the extirpation of our prophanesse, and the rooting out of our Impiety. But this is the subtle malice, and malitious subtilty of Sathan, (the professed enemy, and Arch- Traytor of our soules) as also of his infernall Agents and Factors, who thereby prove and make themselves to bee the firebrands and incendiaries of their owne felicity and safety. And because the examples of the wicked, doe strike apprehension and feare to the godly, and that the punishment and death of murtherers, doth fortifie the Charity, and foment and confirme the Innocency of the living. Therefore (for that Reason, and to this end) I have purposly given this next History a place in my Booke, wherein wee shall see Choller, Malice, and Revenge, to act many deplorable and bloudy parts; Let us reade it with a zealous feare and a Christian fortitude, and so wee shall assuredly hate this soule and crying Sinne in others, and religiously, and constantly avoid it in our selves. Verona , (anciently a great Colony of the Romans, since a free estate of it selfe, but now dependant and subject to the Estate and Seignory of Venice ) wherein their lately dwelt, an old Gentleman being a widdower, and one of the chiefest and noblest families of that City, named Seignior Fabritius Miniata , who was rich in lands, but exceeding wealthy in money, (whereof he had put a great and remarkeable Sum in the bank of Venice ) he had one only Childe, a daughter of some eighteene yeares of age, named Dona Felisanna , who was wonderfull faire, and a most lovely sweet Creature, tall and slender of stature, of yellow golden haire, and sanguine damaske Rose Complexion; Now as her beautie was every way answerable to her birth and extraction, no lesse were her singular vertues and sweet perfections to her beautie, and as wealth, beautie, and vertue concurring and meeting together, are three powerful lures and attractiue Adamants to draw the desires and affections of many Noble gentlemen to seeke her in mariage. So two of her chiefe Suitors and who cheifly flattered their hopes to enioy this sweet and pretious Jewell of nature, and who stood in best possibility to beare away her affection and her selfe, was Seignior Thomas Planeze a brave young gentleman of the neighbour citie of Mantova of a sweet presence, and proper comely feature of some twentie five yeares old, not verie rich, yet indued with competent meanes to maintaine himselfe like himselfe, but infinitly well bred and adorned and honored with all those generous parts and endowments which are requisit to make the gallants of our times compleat, and the other Seignior Iuan de Borlari , a verie rich Gentleman, of the same citie of Verona , a proper man of countenance, but of personage some what crooke backed and much Camber leggd and drawing towards fortie yeares of age, but of education, conditions, and qualities so ignorant and inciuill as hee seemed to bee rather a Citizen then a Gentleman, or indeed more a clowne then a citizen, and yet otherwise of mettall and courage enough: And that we may the more apparantly see and perfectly know upon what tearmes they both stand, aswell in the opinion of the Father as the affection of the Daughter; Miniata is infinitly desirous of Borlari for his Sonne in law but not of Planeze , and Felisanna is excedingly affected to take Planeze for her Husband, but not Borlari ; which they both perceiving, whiles Borlari intends to seeke the affection and consent of the Father before that of the Daughter; Planeze shapes a contrary course, resolues to seeke and prefer that of the daughter before the Father; the regard of Borlari his wealth and of Planezes poverty with covetous Miniata like a furious stream or impetuous. Torrent beares downe all other regardes and considerations before it. But the consideration and respect of Borlari his deformed personage, and then that of Planezes sweet feature and deportment with amorous Felisanna , as a delicious charme and heart-ravishing extasy, sweepes away all other regards and respects whatsoever. The Father bids Borlari to be couragious and cheerfull, and then hee shall not faile to have his daughter for his wife; But the daughter wills Planeze to be descreet and constant, and then she will not faile to take him for her Husband; Miniata to shew his love to Borlari , forbids Planeze his his house, and the company of his daughter; Felisanna to reveale her deere and fervent affection to Planeze , assureth him he shall often enjoy both her sight and company, but confidently if not peremptorily, prohibits Borlari to approach her presence. Thus whiles Borlari often frequenteth and converseth with the Father publikely, no lesse, or indeed farre oftner doth Planeze privatly, and whiles the first hath more cause to despaire, than reason to hope of her affection and consent to be his wife: the second hath all the reasons and causes of the world, not onely to hope but to assure himselfe thereof; But the patience of a little time, will shortly resolve our curiositie, whereunto these different affections will tend, and what the event and issue will bee of these their opposite intentions and resolutions. But because the ambition and wisdome of Borlari will make it conspicuous and apparant to his Mistris. That there is as much difference betwixt him, and Planeze , as there is betweene her selfe, and her Chamber-Maid Radegonda . Hee therefore seeing that he cannot hitherto gaine her by the perswasion of her Father, now hopes and attempts it by this her maids solicitation; as holding her to be a fit instrument for the compassing of his desires, and a proper Agent for the perfecting and crowning of his wishes, because his best genius and intelligence informe him, that shee hath a great power and beares a great stroake and sway with her Mistres: But we shall shortly see, and he too soone finde the contrary, and that these his ill grounded hopes and undervalewing attempt of his, will both deceive his ambition and betray his wisdome and judgement. Now to gaine this her chambermaide Radegonda to his will, that thereby with the more facility and cheerefullnesse, shee may obtaine him her Mistris, her favour and affection: Hee bribes her with silver and Gold, and many other gifts, if not too costly for his giving, yet I am sure too rich for her receiving, and in requitall thereof she with her tongue promiseth him her best power and assistance towards her Mistris, but in her heart intendes the contrary which is directed to betray him; He sends likewise by her to his love, and her Mistris divers curious rich presents and two Letters and prays her to take time at advantage, and so to deliver them to her from him, the which likewise shee faithfully promiseth, but yet intends nothing lesse, so she holds it rather a vertue than a vice, to keep these presents for her selfe, and to give the letters to his Corrivall Planeze , to whom (by solemne oath) she had formerly ingaged her best art and power, and her chiefest assistance. Which policy, or rather which fallacy of hers, is not so secretly borne betwixt Planeze and herselfe, but Borlari (by some sinister accidental meanes) hath perfect notice thereof which he takes so unkindely at Radegondaes hands, as (consulting more with passion then reason) his heart is so inflamed with Choller, and his resolution with revenge against her, that (impatient of all delaies) he sends for her one afternoone to meet him at the Amphitheatre, and from thence goes with her to the next street to a friends house of his, where ascending a chamber and bolting the doore withinside to him, he (with choller and threats) chargeth her with this her ingratefull infidelity and treachery towards him; when drawing all the truth from her, by making herselfe a witnesse against her selfe, aswell of the delivery of his letters to Planeze , as also of keeping her presents for her selfe, and that her Mistris and he are solemnely contracted each to other: He there in meere reuenge to her, and in malice and disdaine to her Mistris, puls off her head attire, and very basely and violently cuts away all her haire, and throwes it into the fire, notwithstanding that Radegonda first fell on her knees, and with infinite teares and prayers besought him to the contrary: But as he hath made it an act of his revenge to Radegonda and of his disdaine to her lady, his unkinde mistris Felisanna , so hee now likewise resolves to make it one of his justifications to the world. Poore Radegonda is all in teares and choller at this her disgracefull accident received of Borlari , and no lesse but rather farre more is her younge Lady and Mistris Felisanna , the griefe of the one engendring the choller of the other, yea this ignoble and malicious fact of his doth so deepely sticke in her heart and minde, and so extreamely exasperateth her, against him, as shee makes her lover Planeze acquainted therewith, who (notwithstanding her fathers prohibition) was then descended his Coach and assended the Parlor to visit her. Planeze wondreth and grieves at this incivill and base indignity of Borlari towards Radegonda , which hee every way sees, can no way but reflect on the other part of himselfe Felisanna , and so consequently on himselfe: When (being in her presence) the passions of his affection, and the fumes of his revenge so farre ecclipse and transport his Judgement, as hee freely profereth her his sword, and selfe, to right Radegondaes wrong on the person and life of Borlari , the which courtesie and noble affection and respect of his, Felisanna takes most lovingly and kindely of him, but yet loves him so tenderly and deerely, that by no meanes she will permit him to ingage, muchlesse to hazard himselfe in this triviall quarrell, which being (as she affirmed) more feminine then masculine, did therefore more properly belong to her owne deciding and requitall, the which (in that regard) she prayed him wholly to leave and referre to herselfe. Borlari (by some of Miniataes domestique servants, whom in favour of money he hath made to be his friendly Spies and intelligencers) heares hereof, and especially takes notice of Planezes forwardnesse to fight with him for the quarrell of a poore chamber-maid, so seeing that hee could hope for nothing but for dispaire in his affection from Felisanna , hee takes this so ill from Planeze , (who although hee bee his rivall and competitor, yet being in a manner but a stranger to him) that he cannot, he will not be outbraved by this Mantovesse in any point of courage or valour, and therefore to prevent his insulting and daring Generosity, and to give him a touch and taste of his owne: Hee the next morning by his laquey Romea sends him this challenge.  Felisanna , whose sweat beauty and vertues are by farre more deere and pretious to me then my life, but that (with much ostentation and malice thou likewise, makest it thy Trophees and Glory, to offer her the sacrifice of my death, onely for the triviall respect of her Chambermaids haire; Therefore because thou makest so small an esteeme of my life; My reputation invites, and mine honour conjures mee to see what care thou wilt have for the defence and preservation of thine owne. To which end, I pray thee to meet mee to morrow (bewixt five and sixe of the clocke in the afternoone) with thy single rapier without seconds, in the first meadow without the Vinsensa gate of this City, where I will attend thy arrivall, with much zeale and impatiency, Thou art Noble enough to bee so generous, and I generous enough to trie if thou wilt appeare, and approve thy selfe so Noble. Borlary.  The Lady Felisanna well knowing Romeo to be Borlari his laquey, and seeing him deliver a letter to her lover Planeze , which she feareth to be some challeng, she thereat (adorning and beautifying her lilly cheekes with a Roseatblush) prayes him to tell her what Borlari his letter contained; When (his owne honour getting the supremacy of his affection towards her) he tels her, that Borlari therein onely requested him, to meet him the next day in the Domo (which is the Cathedrall Church of that City dedicated to Saint Athanasius ) the which he is now going to grant him in his answer. But Felisanna , still jealous and fearefull) prayes him to shew her those two letters which hee pleasantly puts off with some kisses, and yet her bloud and heart so freezeth within her with feare, as she useth the best power of her Art, and the chiefest Art of her affection, to conjure him not to fall out, muchlesse to fight with Borlary at there meeting in the Church. Planeze tells her hee is too religious to bee so prophane, to disdaine and pollute that sacred place with the effusion of Christian bloud, because it is the temple of prayer, the house of God, and therefore every way fitter for a peacefull attonement and reconciliation, then for a contentious quarrell, now (as the malice of men are finite, but of women infinite) Felisanna seeing her Planeze going to write his letter revenge and choller being then extravagantly predominant in her lookes and resolutions, shee hastily steps downe into a chamber next to the garden, where she sends for Borlaries laquey Romea , and causeth three of her groomes (whom she had purposely placed there by force and violence to cut off his right care; which they presently doe, notwithstanding that he used a thousand intreaties and prayers to her to divert her from this her unworthy and malitious fact, and then hastily departing from him, shee spake this to him: Tell thy Master Borlari , that I have caused thine eare to be cut off, to requite the affront and disgrace which he offered me in cutting off my chambermaid Radegondaes haire. Planeze , having secretly to himselfe reade Borlari his challenge: Hee thinkes so honourably of himselfe, and so disgracefully of him, as he not a little wondereth to see, that he hath the courage to write to him, muchlesse the resolution to fight with him; When grieving that hee cannot now have the felicity and honour to make tryall of his valour to himselfe, and affection to his mistris upon a more generous spirit, and nobler personage then Borlari , hee accepts his challenge, and in this answer promiseth him to meet him and performe it, the which hee honourably conceales from Felisannaes feare and jealousie, and so sealing up his letter, hee goes downe to deliver it to Borlary his Laquey, and resolves to dispeede and hasten his returne, but contrary to his expectation he findes this laquey Romeo bitterly storming and weeping; and so demanding the cause thereof, hee then and there by a Gentleman his servant is first informed of the Laqueys disgrace, and of the manner thereof as we have understood; Planeze is wonderfully grieved at this disasterous accident, but love prescribes so powerfull a law to his discretion, as he is inforced to beare up with the time and so to dissemble it, and when in the language of a victory and a triumph Felisanna acquaints him therewith; hee holds it discretion, rather to winke at it, and dissemble it with silence, then to remember it with choller or reprehension towards her; So hee to acquit his ignorance, reputation and honour herein towards Borlari , cals his laquey againe, and vowes and protesteth to him, as hee is a Gentleman that hee is free from being any way knowing or accessary to this his disgrace and disaster, and bids him to assure his Master from him that hee is every way Innocent hereof, the which hee would have signified to him in writing, but that his letter was sealed before he knew it, and so giving him some crownes to wash downe his anger and sorrow, he then takes leave of him. Romeo sayes little but thinkes the more, and as hee disdaineth to bewray any appearance of griefe hereat, so he cannot cloake that of his choller, nor overvaile or smother that of revenge, in their fatall effects, which time will too soone produce. Romeo in great haste and more choller, arrives to his master Borlaries presence, gives him Planezes letter, who very speedily and hastily breaking up the seales thereof findes therein these lines.  induceth the faire and vertuous Lady Felisanna to give her affection to mee, and not to thy selfe, the which as a rich treasure and pretious Iewell I doe not onely esteeme equall to my life, but a thousand degrees aboue it, and therefore it was with much affection and zeale to her, and with no ostentation yor malice to thy selfe, that I tendred her my best service, to right her of the ignoble wrong which thou didst offer to her Chamber-maide Radegonde . In which regard, because thou purposely givest a sinister construction to my intent therein, and art so ambitiously resolute to hazard thy honour and life in hope of the losse of mine, I doe therefore freely and cheerefullie accept of thy challenge, and my impatience and zeale shall anticipate thine before I perform it, wherein if my Rapier give not the lie to my bloud, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) my misfortune to my Rapier, thou shalt finde me enough noble and generous to attempt this duell for thy sake, and to finish those of greater danger for the Lady Felisannas sake, who I freely professe is the Empresse of my affections, and till death shall bee the Queene Regent of my desires and wishes. Planeze's.  Borlari hath no sooner perused and ore read this letter of Planeze , but finding his challenge accepted, he is exceeding glad and Ioyfull thereof, as if his glory consisted in his shame, and his safety in his danger: Then his laquey Romeo acquaints him with his disgrace acted, saieth he, wholly by Dona Felisanna and no way as hee vowes and thinkes, by the consent or knowledge of Planeze , and so relates all that he and shee charged him to report unto him: The which Borlari hearing and understanding, hee extreamely stormes to see his owne affront and disgrace, offered and brought home unto him in that of his Laquey: When having other affaires and businesse in his head, he contents himselfe for that time to give him some gold, thereby the sooner to make him forget the losse of his eare, which his lockes better then his lookes could now overvaile and cover. These two inconsiderate Gentlemen, (being infinitely more ambitious to preserve their honours then their lives, and more carefull of their reputations towards the foolish people of the world, then of their soules towards God, are now fitting of their Rapiers and Chirurgions, to dispatch this their rash enterprise and irreligious businesse, and it is not the least part of Planezes discretion and care to play the Mercury and now to blinde the Argus eyes of Felisannaes feare and vigilancy, and how to see a beginning and end to this duell, with his generosity and fame, that he bee no way disturbed or prevented by her in the performance thereof: The prefixed houre being come, Borlari (with his Chirurgeon) as Challenger, comes first into the field, I meane into the meadow, the designed place and theatre where they intend to act this their bloudy Tragedy, and hee hath not stayed halfe a quarter of an houre, but Planeze the Challenged arrives there likewise with his Chirurgion: When there malice is so furious, and their courages so inflamed each against other, as passing over their saluting ceremonies without a ceremony, they putting themselves into their shirts, doe both of them draw, and so approach each other. At their first comming up, Planeze runnes Borlari through the left thigh, and Borlari him in the right shoulder, and the sight of their scarlet bloud upon their white shirts doth rather revive than quench their courages: At their second meeting Borlari runnes Planeze into the right arme of a large and deep wound, and Planeze dies not in debt for it, but requites it with a dangerous one in the small of his belly, which went neere to prove mortall, for it fetcht much bloud from him, made him to beginne to faint and stagger, so being both of them well neere out of breath, they make a stand to breath and take the benefit of the aire, but their hearts and animosity are so great as they will not as yet desist or leave off but now begin a fresh to redouble their blowes and courages, and here they traverse their ground to gaine the advantage of the Sunne: with far more advisement and discretion then before. Now at this their third comming up, Bolari presents Planeze a furious thrust, but he very actively and nimbly wards it off him, and in exchange runnes Borlari into the necke, a little wide of his throat bole: whereat Planeze instantly closing with him, he fairely attempted to whip up his heeles, but that Borlari his strength prevented Planezes agility: when each having the other by the coller of their doublets with one hand, and their rapiers in the other, as they are striving and strugling together, God (more out of his gratious goodnesse and mercy, then of their desires and wishes) is pleased that neither of them shall for this time dye. For the Earle of Lacerni riding poast (with three gentlemen in his company) from Venice towards Turin , chanced to espie and see them in the meddow, almost all covered over with sweat, bloud, and dust, when he and they leaping from their Horses, hee very honourably and charitably runnes to them and parts them; offering them his best power and a pretty parcell of his time, to end and shut up their differences in a friendly attonement and reconciliation, but so inveterate and strong (by this time) is their malice each to other, as he found it no way feaseable but impossible to effect it: So this brave and honourable Earle contents himselfe, to reconduct and see them safe into the City, where privately leaving them to their future fortunes, hee againe takes horse and away. Our two Duellists having first thanked him for his noble Courtesie towards them, but otherwise they are exceedingly grieved to see the victory puld out of their hands, for the vanity and impiety of either of them flattered and bounded their hopes with no lesse ambition and felicity, then each their owne life and either of them the death of his adversary. But as they are gratefull to the Earle of Lucerni for this his honourable courtesie towards them; yet they are so irreligious as they looke not up to Heaven, nor once have the Grace to thinke of God, much lesse to thanke his divine Majesty, for now so mercifully and so gratiously withdrawing them as it were from out the very Iawes of death; but still they retaine their malice and cherish and foment their revenge each to other, especially Borlary to Planeze , for it is a Continuall private griefe and a secret Corrasive to his content and minde, to see that hee is inforced to weare the willow Garland, and that Planeze must beare away his faire and beautifull Mistres Felisanna from him: But we will for a little time, leave them to their thoughts and their thoughts to God, and so againe speake of Romeo , the Laquey of Borlari , who as a wretched and most execrable villane comes now to act a bloody and wofull part in this History. For we must here understand, that this lewd Laquey Romeo , is so extreamly incensed with Choller and inraged with malice against the Lady Felisanna for the losse of his eare, as (being seduced and encouraged by the Devill) hee was once of the minde to have murthered her in the street, the very first time he had met or seene her: but then againe respecting his master Borlari , whom he knew affected her tenderly and deerely, hee forsooke that opinion of his, and resolved to wreake his wrath and indignation upon her three servants who were the Actors of cutting off his eare, as he was the Author therof: But then againe remembring that he knew them not, nor any of them for that they were all purposely masked and disguised, He then swaps a bargaine with the devill, and the devill with him, that the storme of this his malice and revenge should assuredly fall on Radegonda her Chambermaid, from whom it originally proceeded, and from this resolution hee is so execrably prophane and bloudy, as he vowes that neither Heaven or Earth God or man shall divert him. But as Envy cannot prove so pernitious an enemy to others as to her selfe, so Revenge will in the end assuredly make us as miserable as first it fastly promised to make us happy. Romeo continueth still resolute in his rage, and implacable in his revenge towards Radegonda (and yet poore innocent harmelesse soule, shee was not so much as guilty of a badde thought, muchlesse of a bad action or office towards him; and therefore least deserving this his revenge;.) when waiting many Nights for her, as shee issued forth in the street in her Ladies errands, hee at last in a darke night found her, and there slew her with his rapier, giving her foure severall wounds, whereof he mought have spared the three last, because the verie first was mortall, and thereuppon betooke himselfe to his heeles and fled through the streets, where the people flocked together at the report and knowledge of this lamentable Murther, but God is so exasperated at this soule and lamentable fact of his, as (in his Starre-chamber of Heaven) he hath ordained and decreed that Romeo shall instantly receive condigne punishment for the same as not deserving to survive it, for running through the streets to provide for his safety and life: He at last tooke the river of Addice , neere the old castle, where thinking to swimme over to the other side, or to hide himselfe in some of the mill-boates, hee was discovered by the sentinells (for the watch was already set) and the newes of this murther was by this time resounding and ecchoing in all parts of the City. The Souldiours of the Castle suspected him to bee the murtherer, they send a boat after him and apprehend him: so by the criminall Iudges he is committed to prison for that night, and being the next morning accused by Seignior Miniata by way of torture, and by the Lady Felisanna his daughter by legall order for the murthering of her Chambermaid Radegonda , he without any thought of feare, or shew of sorrow or repentance, freely confesseth it, for the which he is presently condemned to bee hanged, and the same day after dinner hee was accordingly dispatched and executed, notwithstanding that his master Borlari , used his best friends and power, yea and proffered two hundred zechines to save him. Thus wee see there was but one poore night betweene Romeoes taking away of Radegondaes life, aud losing of his owne, and betweene her murthering and his hanging; At his execution hee spake not a word either of the losse of his care by the Lady Felisanna , or of that of Radegondaes haire by his master Borlari , whereat both of them exceedingly rejoyce and no lesse doth Planeze : But for the other speeches which this bloudy footman delivered on the ladder at this execution they were either so ungodly, or so impertinent, as the relation thereof no way deserves my pen, or my Readers knowledge. And here to leave the dead Servant Romeo , returne wee againe to speake of his living Master Borlari : who after he had spent much time and labour, and as I may say ran his invention and wit out of breath, to seeke to prevent that Planeze mought not marry the fayre Felisanna , hath notwithstanding, to his matchlesse griefe, and unseparable sorrow sees that it is al bootlesse and in vaine for by this time she through the importunity of her teares and prayers hath obtained her father Miniataes consent, to take and enjoy Seignior Planeze , for her Husband: when to both their hearts delight and content, they are solemnely married in Verona , and in that height of pompe and bravery as is requisite to their noble ranke and quality: When Planeze the more to please his new wife leaves Mantova , and wholly builds up his residence in Verona with her and in her father Miniataes house, who never hated him so much heretofore, as now he deepely affects and loves him, and to say and write the truth, hee well deserved that affection of the rather, and this love of the daughter: sith the lustre and vertue of his actions made it apparant to all Verona , yea to all Italy , that hee proved a most kinde and loving Husband to the one, and a most obedient, and respective sonne in law to the other. Now although Felisanna bee thus marryed to Planeze , yet the affection of Borlari to her, is still so far from fading or withring thereat, as it reviveth and flourisheth at the sight of her pure aud delicate beauty: for those golden tresses of her haire, those splendant raies of her sparkling eyes, and those delicious lilies and Roses of her cheekes doe act such wonders in his heart, and his heart in his resolutions: that his lust ecclipsing his judgement, and outbraving his disdiscretion he cannot, he will not refraine, to trie if he can yet procure and get her to be his friend though not his wife; and so futurely to obtaine that curtesie from her by the eye, which formerly he knew it impossible for him to get by the maine. To which end his affection or rather his folly, giving no truce to his thoughts, nor peace to his minde, because both the one and the other were still ranging and ruminating on Felisannaes sweet Idea, and delitious feature, Hee enters into a consideration and consultation with himselfe, whether hee should bewray his amorous flame to her by himselfe or by some other, or either by his penne or his tongue, when after hee had proposed and exchanged many poore reasons and triviall Motives Pro and Con , hee at last resolves on the last, which is to doe it by letters, when hying himselfe to his closet, he traceth her these lines, which by a confident friend of his he forth with sends her.  constant affection to thee; for none can better testifie, how I alwaies made it my chiefest Care and Ambition to make the dignity of my zeale answerable to that of thy beauty; and that this mought be as truely Immortall, as that is devinely rare and rarely excellent, which to confirme. I have sealed it with some bloud, but with more teares, so that although thou hast given thy affection from mee to Planeze , yet my heart and soule tells me it is impossible to give mine to any but to the Lady Felisanna . And because thou canst not bee my wife, therefore I pray be pleased to resolve to live my friend, as in requitall I doe dye thy Servant. I confesse I am not worthy of thy affection, much lesse to enjoy the sweet fruit thereof, thy sweet selfe, yet because I cannot be more thine then I am, therefore I pray thee make thy selfe as much mine as thou mayest be. Thy heart shall not be a truer Secretary to our affections then my tongue, and for the times and places of our meetings, I wholly referre it to thy will and pleasure, which mine shall ever carefully attend, and religiously obey, I send the my whole heart inclosed in this Letter, and if thou vouchsafe to returne me a peice of thine in exchange, Heaven may, but Earth cannot crosse our affection. Borlary.  The Lady Flisanna receives this letter with much wonder, and ore reades it with more Contempt and Choller, for if she disdained Borlari and his affection when she was a maid, much more doth shee now when God and her Husband have made her a wife: Once shee was of opinion to have throwne this his Letter into the fire, and have answered it with disdaine and silence; But then againe considering the vainity of his thoughts, and the obsc aenity of his desires hee conceived he mought (peradventure) repute her silence to a degree of consent: and therefore though not in affection to him, yet in discretion and love to her honour, she resolves to returne him an answer, when knitting her browes with anger, dipping her pen in gall and vinegar, and setting a sharp edge of contempt and Choller on her resolutions, she hastily frame her Letter, and gives it to his owne Messenger to deliver it to Borlari , whose heart steering his course betwixt hope and feare till hee receive it: he first kissing it, and then hastily breaking up the seales thereof, findes that it speakes this language.  obstinate and vaine perseverance therein, of one makes me capable to serve for many. And if thou hadst beene as truely carefull and ambitious of thine owne honour, as thou falsly pretendest to be of my poore beauty thou wouldest not so often have sacrificed thy shame to my glory, nor so sottishly have cast away thy bloud or teares on my contempt: How thou intendest to dispose of thy self, I neither desire to know nor care to understand. But as I have given my soule to God, so God hath given my heart to my husband Planeze . from whom neither the malice of Sathan or power of hell shall withdraw it, and therefore as I am Felisanna I detest thy lustfull sute, and as Planezes wife, I defie both it and thy selfe; And thus to bee thy friend thou shalt finde mee thy friend, but for such servants as thy selfe I leave them to their owne proper Infamy and Repentance. I make God the Secretary of my actions, and my husband of my affections, therefore it shall please me well when I understand that thy tongue wil recant thy folly, I repent thy indiscretion towards me, in seeking to erect the Trophees of thy lascivious lust, upon the ruines of my pure and candid honour: And I assure thee, that if hereafter thou inspire, and fortifie not thy heart with more religious, and lesse sinfull desires and affections that Earth can and Heaven will make thee as truely miserable, as now thou falsly thinkest thy selfe fortunate. Felisanna.  Borlari at the reading of this Letter of Felisanna , is so galled with griefe and netled with sorrow, to see his refusall sent him in her disdaine, as he knows not to what passion to betake himselfe for ease, or to what Saint for comfort, for the consideration of her coynesse and cruelty, makes his dispaire to gaine so much on his hopes, that once he was minded absolutely to forsake her, and to court her affection no more, but then againe his lustfull heart and desires, remembring the freshnesse of her beauty and the sweetnesse of her youth, hee held himselfe a coward, every way unworthy to enjoy so faire a Lady, and so sweet an Angell, if hee retyred upon her first denyall, especially because as those Citties and Castles, so those Ladies and Gentlewomen who entertaine a pearle, are already halfe wonne. In which consideration because it many times proves an errour in Nature; but still in judgement, to flatter our selves most, with that which we most hope for and desire, He therefore once more resolves to hazard another letter to her, as having some reasons to beleive, that his second may perchance obtaine that from her which his first could not, for that he knowes that most ladies and gentlewomen pride themselves with this felicity to be often sought and importunately sued unto by their lovers, wherfore resolving once more to try his fortune, and her courtesie, hee by his former messenger greets her with these lines.  heart, that thy late disrespect and contempt of me in thy Letter, is not sufficiently prevalent to make mee, or so soone or so sleightly forsake thee. For although thou seeme my loue folly, and my affection obstinacy, yet untill thou cease to bee faire, finde it not strange, if it be impossible for me to cease to be affectionate: Neither doe I sacrifice my shame to thy Glory, or cast away my teares on thy contempt, sith I performe it more out of duty then complement, and rather out of true zeale then false hypocrisie. And as the strongest Cities and Castles by the rule of war, so the fairest beauties, by that of love, deserve to be honoured with more then one assault and siege; and that Cavilleir cannot justly, be termed, either a Gentleman, a Souldier, or a Lover, who will resolve to be put off with the first repulse, especially from so sweet, and so beautifull an Enemy as thy selfe: Neither can it any way breed infamy or repentance in me to be servant to so deare, and slave to so faire Mistris, because the excellency of thy beauty is every way capable both to confound sence, and to subvert and overthrow Reason. Bee then but as courteous as thou art faire, and as kinde as I am constant, and thou shalt finde that I onely desire to erect the Trophees of mine Honour and Glory upon those of thy content, to sacrifice my best life at the shrine and alter of thy beautie, and to devote and prostrate my best zeale and service to the feet of thy Commands, which if thou please to grant me: Earth will not make me miserable but Heaven fortunate. Borlary.  The Lady Felisanna having received and oreread this second Letter of Borlari , as one way shee laughes to see the constancy of his folly, and indiscretion; so another way shee stormes, and yet grieves to see her selfe to be both the object and the cause thereof: When returning to the party who brought it her, shee thinks, to vent part of her choller on him, taxeth his audacity and rashnesse herein, and strictly conjures him to bring her no more of Borlari his Letters: yea, shee is so farre transported with passion and choller against Borlari for sending them to her, as now shee resolves to answer this with silence, and hence forth to burne all other which are sent or brought to her from him, because if his folly make him culpable of sending, shee will not futurely make herselfe guilty of receiving any more. But here againe, her thoughts are taken up with feare, and her heart surprised with resolution and doubt, whether (yea or no) shee should shewe these his two letters to her Husband: For her affection is soe tender, soe faithfull, soe constant to him; because shee likewise knowes that his is reciprocally so to her, that she will rather displease her selfe, then any way discontent him, or administer him the least cause whatsoever, to runne the hazard of his displeasure or indignation, for as by concealing them from his knowledge, she knowes this businesse will be for ever husht up in silence, and perpetually buried in oblivion; So contrariwise if either through Borlarie his malice to her, or indiscretion to himselfe, it should any way come to her Husbands eare, then she thinkes she should give him a just cause of exception and offence against her; Wherein if the subtilty of the Devill should once put his foot, or the malice of any of his members, their tongues or fingers, then his jealousie might call her Honour and Fidelity in question, and make him suspect and feare her to bee dishonest, though heretofore (in heart and soule) he cofidently knowes and beleeves the contrarie, she farther knowes that there is nothing so easie as to entertaine jealousie, nor so difficult as to expell it, and therefore that it is not enough for us to prevent a scandall, but likewise to remove the originall cause thereof, faine she would conceale these foolish letters of Borlari from her husband, but yet she doubts it, and willing she is to accquaint him therewith and yet she feares it: And although her chastity, and innocency perswade her to performe the last, yet her discretion and judgement encourage and prompt her to execute the second: And here our Beautifull and Vertuous young Wife is perplexed as a traveller, who meetes with two different waies and knowes not which is the best for him to take; and her heart and thoughts here in this accident) is as a ship at sea at one time surprised and met with two contrary windes and tides; for preferring her honour to her life, and her affection to her husband, and his to her before any other earthly respect or felicity whatsoever; she in the intricacy and ambiguity of these doubts, wisheth that Borlari had slept when he writ and sent her those Letters, or she when she received and read them. But at last consulting with Reason and Religion, with her Soule and God, then her chastity gives a commanding law to her feare, and her innocency to her doubt, so first hoping and then praying that nothing herein might breed bad bloud in her husband, or disturbe the tranquility and sincerity of her marriage; shee watching a fit opportunity shewes her husband the first letter of Borlari to her with her answer thereof, and then his second letter, the which she informes him shee answered with silence and contempt, adding withall: That had she a thousand lives as she hath but one, she would cheerefully sacrifice and lose them all, before she would be guilty of the least thought to distaine the honour of his bed, or to breake her sacred vow of Love and Chastity, which in presence of God and his Church, she religiously made and gave him in marriage. Pluneze at the hearing of these speeches and the reading of these Letters, doth at one instant both blush and pale, for as hee lookes pale with Envy towards Borlari , to see how secretly and subtilly he endevoureth to ruine his honour in that of his wifes; so he blusheth for love towards her, to see how sweetly and chastly she had demeaned her selfe in her answer to him, as also what a wise and loving part it was in her so punctually and fully to acquaint him therwith; when in requitall hereof hee gives her many prayses and kisses, extols her chastity and vertues to the sky, and condemnes Borlarie his lustfull vices to Hell, and although (for the present) shee finde some incongruity in his speeches, and observe some perturbation in his lookes, yet he makes his affection so apparant to her, and dissembleth his hatred and choller towards Borlari so secretly and artificially: That his wife Felisanna wholly reposing herselfe upon her owne integrity, and her husbands discretion, shee sweet innocent Lady) little dreames or thinkes of any disaster which will ensue hereof, muchlesse what dismall effects threaten to proceed from this inconsiderate act of hers, in acquainting her Husband with those Letters. But shee will have time enough to see it to her griefe and know it to her sorrow, yea shee will finde occasions enough to repent, but never any meanes how to remedy it except it be too late, and which then will meerely prove phisicke after death. Planeze (as wee have formerly understood) is extreamely incensed against Borlary thus to attempt to bereave him of his sweetest Joy, which is his wifes affection, and shee of her most pretious Iewell her chastity: And although (both in reason and religion) he had farre more cause to rejoyce then to grieve at this accident, in regard hee was both assured and confident that his wifes chastity triumphed ore Borlaries lust, and her glory was apparant in his shame, for as objects so actions being best distinguished by their contraries, therefore through the obscure clouds of Borlari his obsc aene concupiscence, that of Felisannas Angelicall chastity, as a bright relucent Sunne, shined forth most radiantly and sweetly with farre more vigour and glory, yet Planeze being a man composed of corrupt flesh and bloud, and therefore subject to passions, and those passions to errours and imperfections, So he takes a course and resolution herein contrary to all Iudgement and to all reason, yea diametrically opposite to the rules of Nature and precepts of Grace. For although his heart bee upright in the opinion of his wifes chastity and honour, yet as the deerest and purest affections cannot be exempted of some shadow or spice of feare, so although his heart looked directly on Borlari with malice, hee cannot possibly refraine nor retaine his thoughts, from glancing squint-eyed on his wife with jealousie. And although he knowes it to be a most ignoble ingratitude, and irreligious impiety in him thus to call her honour in question or (in the best sence) to revoke it to doubt, by making any puplike shew of suspition or dilafie to her, or by seeking any private revenge on Borlari , yet because her beauty and vertue is a thousand times deerer to him then his life; and the purity and integrity of her affection to him as deere as his soule: Hee therefore thinkes she shall not prophane his good opinion of her, nor offer her merits or his owne reputation any wrong, if he resolve to right both her, and himselfe on Borlari when consulting not with reason or charity, but with their opposites malice and revenge, hee will not bee at peace with his heart, nor at once with his thoughts before he have fought with Borlari , albeit (indeed) his delict and offence towards him, more deserved his scorne then his Care, and was every way farre more worthy of his oblivion then of his remembrance. To which end (by a Chirurgion which he had made choice of) he sends him this challenge.  lascivious Letters to distaine my honour in that of my wifes chastity, as nothing but thy life is capable to expiate it, or mine to deface and forget it; wherefore if thou have as much courage at thou wantest grace, bring thy selfe, thy Rapier, and thy Chrirurgion with thee, to morrow at six a clocke in the morning, in the City Ditch, without the utter Gate, which lookes towards Brescia , and there my selfe and my Chirurgion (who is the bearer hereof, will silently and honourably wait for thee. And if thy obscene heart retaine yet any sparke of generosity, or thy vitious braine of judgement, thou wilt resolve to performe this my request, and to excuse my resolution herein, sith it is wholly derived from thy lasciviousnesse, and receives its life and birth from thy treachery. Planeze.  Borlary receiving and perusing this Challenge of Planeze , he is much grieved and sorrowfull, to see that Felisanna had so little discretion for her selfe, and so much hatred against him, to shew her husband these his Letters, and except she meant to make her selfe the present authour, and the cause of her future affliction and misery, he knowes not else what she intends hereby. But for Planeze his spleene and resolution against him, Borlary knowes it to be both just and well grounded in the best sense, and in the worst to be yet a requitall of that Challenge and Duell which he formerly sent and presented him: Onely he doth a little admire (if not wonder) that he should now againe make triall of his valour and courage, whereof he so lately had experience, and tasted. And although he had farre more reason to rest assured than doubtfull, that this second Duell of theirs would not prove so fortunate as their first, but would rather terminate in one, if not in both of their lives. He yet loves Felisanna so dearly, albeit she have him extreamly, that he will by no meanes refuse to fight with her husband once againe for her sake, yea and to kill him for his owne, if possible he can, the devill making him strong in the vanitie of this beleefe and confidence; that if it prove now his good fortune to kill Planeze , that he can then requite and limit his victory with the reward of no lesse happinesse and felicity, by his death to obtaine his widdow for his owne wife. But this is to write upon the water, and to build Castles of vaine hopes in the ayre, which the least breath of Gods mouth, or wind of his nostrils will easily reverse and blow away. For this is to consult and resolve with Satan and not with God, and therefore no marvell if he see his lascivious desires to come too short of his ridiculous hopes, and both his hopes and desires here in to end in as much true misery, as they beganne in false hope of felicity and joy. So Borlari having made a turne or two in his Garden to resolve upon this businesse which so much imported both his honour and life: Hee at last with joy in his lookes, and courage in his countenance turnes to Planeze his Chirurgeon, whom after he used respectfully and courteously, hee secretly rounds him thus in his eare; Tell Seignior Planeze from me, that I will not faile to meet him to morrow morning according to his request and expectation, and so he dismisseth him, who as soone returnes this answer of Borlari to Planeze , whom he now findes staying for him in the Church of the Augustine Fryers , but God knowes with no intent or devotion to pray, or to invoke his Divine and Sacred Majestie to divert him from this his intended bloudy enterprize, but rather to reconduct home the Lady Felisanna his wife, who harmlesse sweet Gentlewoman was there in that Church, upon the Altar of her heart, proffering up the most religious prayers, and zealous Orisons of her soule unto God, without once surmising or thinking what a mournfull and dangerous part her husband was resolved to act the next morning, to the prejudice of her content, if not to the utter dissolution and ruine of her Matrimoniall joy and felicity. But her husband Planeze beares this businesse, and these his intentions so secretly from his wife, as it was impossible for her to have any suspition, much lesse knowledge of this his next dayes intended Duell. The night which brings rest to others, hath not power to give it to our two inflamed Duelists. For the consideration of their honours and their lives, of their quarrell, and the cause thereof, doth equally possesse their braines, and pre-occupate and prevent their eyes of their sleeping faculties. So preferring their danger to their safety, their resolution to their rest, and the field to their beds, they (under other pretexts) are not long from it, I meane from the City ditch, the prefixed place of their rendezvous: Which Planeze first entreth, and there makes halfe a dozen of turnes, before hee have any newes of his Contendant or Adversary Borlary , whereof he doth not a little muse, yet he no way despaires of his comming, because (by late experience) he knowes him to be couragious and valiant. But to put Planezes musing out of doubt, and his doubt out of question, in comes Borlari all unbraced and untrussed, and a farre off espying Planeze in the Ditch before him: He (ashamed of this advantage he had because of long stay) with his hat in his hand prayes him to excuse this errour of his, affirming it to be the fault of his Watch, but not of his heart, which he alleaged should ever goe true with his honour and reputation; When Planeze returning his Complement, by approving of his Apologie, (without any further expostulation) they draw, and here fall from words to blowes. At their first meeting Borlary give Planeze a wound in the right arme, and Planeze requites him with another in his right side, which if his Rapier had not met with a rib, it had the undoubtedly ended the quarrell with his life. But although it make him lose much bloud, yet he hath strength  & courage enough not to die in his debt for it, onely he desireth Planeze that they may breathe a little, the which he generously granteth. At their second comming up, Planeze presents a thrust to Borlari , but he wards it, and runnes Planeze into his left thigh, of a deepe wound, and yet they will not give over, although their Chirurgeons doe earnestly pray them to desist, as having now already here sufficiently testified their courage and valour. At their third meeting and joyning, Planeze gives Borlary a licke o're the fore-head, which makes his bloud streame downe his face and eyes, and Borlary fully incensed and prepared to requite it, drives a faire thrust to Planezes brest, but he very dexterously and fortunately, wards it, beating downe the point of Borlary his sword into the ground, and then with much agility leaps to him, and whips up his heeles, who falling upon his owne Rapier, breaks it in two peeces, at which unlooked for disaster, Borlary seeing his naked brest exposed to Planezes bloudy Rapier, and consequently his life to lie at his mercy, (without once striving or endevouring to grapple with his enemie) he (more desirous to live with shame, than to die with honour) descends so farre from true and noble generosity, as hee begs his life of Planeze ; when (although many hot and jealous spirits would gladly have taken hold of this advantage, and wreaked the utmost of their gall and spleene upon the misfortune of this accident) yet Planeze is so truly noble and generous, as disdaining to fight with an unarmed man, and so to eclipse or blemish the lustre of his reputation in killing him who begged his life of him, and when it lay at his pleasure to give or take it, as he throwes away his Rapier, making him promise and sweare hee will never henceforth attempt against the honour of his wife, Planeze very freely and cheerfully gives him his life: And to shew himselfe the more generous in this his courtesie, hee lends him his hand to raise him up on his feet; for which infinite kindnesse Borlary yeelds him many thanks: When muffling up their faces with their cloaks, they part very good friends, and so get themselves into two of the nearest houses of the Suburbs, very secretly and silently to dresse their wounds, and at night they returne to their houses: Where our deare and faire Felisanna understanding the manner and cause of this combate betwixt her husband and Borlary , it is impossible for me to define whether she wept and sighed more for the losse of her husbands bloud, or rejoyced and praised God for the saving and sparing of his life. Yet this Combat of theirs is not so secretly acted, but in lesse than two dayes all Verona hath newes, and prattles thereof. When measuring the first Duell of Planeze and Borlari by the second, and the second by the first. They extoll Borlary his courage to fight with Planeze , but infinitely applaud the noble courtesie and generosity of Planeze , in giving Borlari his life when it lay in his power and pleasure to have taken it from him. And as most commended the Lady Felisanna for disdaining to make shipwracke of her honour on the Cylla and Charibdis of Borlaries lust, and for not sacrificing her chastity to his lascivious affections and desires; So, in generall all Gentlemen and Ladies condemne her of indiscretion in shewing his Letters to her husband, and in acquainting him with his suits and desires, it having beene sufficient for her secretly to have given him the repulse and deniall, and herselfe the glory. Againe, there want not divers, especially the younger sort of the Nobility and Gentry of Verona , who tax Borlari of Cowardize, in shamefully begging his life of Planeze , when either his good fortune in struggling, or his peece of sword in his defence, might peradventure have preserved it. Thus every one speakes according to his owne fancies and affections. Borlary having lost so much bloud for the affection which he bore to Felisanna , and recived and reaped nothing from her but disdaine and hatred, hee is not a little grieved and vexed hereat. But when he understands that hee hath now made himselfe the laughture of all Verona , in this his cowardly begging his life of Planeze , and that his reputation doth therefore universally suffer in this action, he is then as it were pierced to the heart with sorrow, and to the soule with shame. He knowes it were far better for him to be borne a Clowne, than to be held and esteemed a Coward; and that having once purchased that base title, he shall difficultly ever lose. Yea, wheresoever he goes hee heares and sees that his Superiours, his Equals, and his Inferiours, not onely prattle at his shame, but point at his infamy herein, so that he is (in a manner) a shame to all Gentlemen, and therefore almost a shame to himselfe. But see here the vanitie and impiety of this inconsiderate Gentleman, and if it be not worthy the Readers curiosities, yet it will deserve his compassion and pity, to see what use, or rather what abuse he makes of this his imaginary dishonour: For neither with reason, which is the soule of his heart, nor with Religion which is the life of his soule, doth he once looke up to Heaven to thanke God for so mercifully protecting, and so miraculously preserving of his life in these two Duels, when he as it were stood on the brinke, and in the very jawes of death and when betwixt his life and his death there was nothing but the point of Planezes Rapier, and of his pleasure. No, no, Borlary is too much man, to be so much a Christian, and too much the member of Satan, to bee so much the childe of God: For having formerly given up his heart to the turpitude of lascivious desires and lust; now as a limbe and agent of the devill he will wholly abandon it to infernall rage and hellish revenge, for knowing Planeze to be both the author and object of his dishonour, and the instrument and cause of his disgrace, hee therefore retaines this diabolicall and bloody Aphorisme in his heart, that as long as he lives it will live with him, and when he dies will die with him, and therefore to refetch his honour out of his infamy, his heart wholly sacrificing to malice, and his thoughts and resolutions to revenge) he most ingratefully and desperately resolves to murther Planeze , or at least to cause him to be murthered. Lo here the wofull estate, and wretched resolution of this execrable Gentleman Borlari , and what a monstrous ingratitude and prodigious cruelty is this in him to conspire his death, of whom (in a manner) he but rightly now received his life, he little knowes, or (which is worse) hee will not know, that revenge still proves as pernitious as pleasing to their authors, and that murther endeth in as much true misery as it beginnes in false content and Ioy; for it is a better Oblation, and an odious sacrifice to the Lord, who is the God of peace, and the father of all vnity and charity. But the devill is so familiar a guest, and so frequent a counsellor to Borlari that he wretchedly vowes and execrably sweares that Planeze shall no longer live but dye. Once he was of opinion either to pistoll or poniard him in the street by night, but then againe seeing the eminencie of that danger in the misfortune of his Laquey Romeo , he rejects it as ruinous, and resolves on poyson which hee thinkes is the shortest, and safest way for him to send him for Heaven, and thinkes none so fit for his purpose to give and administer it to him as Planezes owne Apothecary Castruchio , being the more confident in this his choice, because he knowes him to be a wonderfull poore man, and withall extreamely vitious and debaushed, as neither fearing nor caring for God, but more an Atheist than a Christian, and more a devill then a catholike, and therfore beleeves that a little mony will act wonders in his heart and resolution; Neither doth he faile in his judgement, or deceive himselfe in the hopes of his choyse, for he no sooner proffereth him three hundred Dukatons, to poyson Planeze (one halfe in hand, and the other when it is performed) but he accepts thereof, ingageth himselfe (by hand and oath) speedily to dispatch and finish it, and so like two Factors or furies of Hell, both of them sweare secresie each to other herein. Borlary longing and Castruchio desiring to finish this Tragedy on Planeze that hee might likewise touch the last one hundred and fifty Dukatons. The Spring approching wherein Planeze every yeare for the preservation of his health) was accustomed to take phisicke of Castruchio , hee no sooner sent for him to that effect, but first purging; then bleeding him, he then artificially perswades him to take a vomit the next morning, whereunto Planeze easily consents, so he administreth it to him and therein infusing poyson, he within six daies after dies thereof, when Castruchio demanding his other one hundred and fifty dukatons, Borlari speedily paies it him with much content, joy, and delectation: But let the first know and the second remember, that it is the price of innocent bloud. The order of our History leades us now (as it were by the hand) to our sorrowfull young widow Felisanna who poore soule (not dreaming any way in the world either of poyson or of Borlari ) is ready to weepe her selfe to death, that shee must survive and cannot dye with her deere and sweet husband Planeze , and that as one bedde, so one grave might containe them, yea her griefe is so great and her sorrowes so infinite for the losse of this her other part of her selfe, that neither her father, kinsfolkes, or friends can possibly comfort her, for still she sees him before her eies as if hee were not buried in his grave, but in her heart, or that it was wholly impossible for him to dye as long as she lived: Which excesse of sorrowes, sighes, and teares of hers, so withered the roses and lillies of her beauty and so ecclipsed the lustre of her sparkling eyes, that to the eyes and judgements of all those who saw or knew her, she become so pale and leane, as she was no longer Felissanna , but only the poore sicke Anatomy of Felisanna . We have seene this wretched Gentleman Borlari , and this execrable Apothecary Castruchio commit this horrible murther upon the person of noble and Generous Planeze , and wee shall not goe farre before wee shall see the sacred Iustice, and just punishments of God to surprise and oretake them for the same, For God is now resolved to triumph ore those bloudy miscreants, and although they have so closely acted and perpetrated this their lamentable murther as their are no earthly eyes to detect nor witnesse to give in evidence against them for the same: yet our good and gratious God, who who is the true searcher of our hearts and reines, will to his glory and their confusion bring this to light, by an accident worthy of our deepest consideration, and of our most serious and religious observation: The manner wherof is thus. This wretched Apothecary Castruchio , having received his other hundred dukatons of Borlari (as we have formerly understood) for minishing this bloody businesse, and being (as wee know) of a most vitious and debaushed life, hee had already in his riots and prodigalities spent and consumed all his estate: And now this three hundred Dukatons which received of Borlari for performing this bloudy businesse, makes him by many degrees farre worse then he was before, for (as by Gods sacred and secret providence) it was impossible to prosper with him, so his prophane vices and sinnes and his beastly pleasures and prodigalities made it consume and melt away as snow against the Sunne, in such sort that it seemed to him that he was a thiefe to himselfe and that one of his hands and pockets hourely cozened and betrayed the other; And although for a time he bore this his vitious course of life very close and secret from the eye and knowledge of the world, whereby his credit farre exceeded his estate, so after the committing of this foule murther, both his Estate, credit, and all went to wracke and spoyle, for hee left nothing either unspent or unpawned, and which is yet worse he fell into many arrerages and debts which at last grew so clamorous (especially when his prodigall and and beastly life of whoring, drunkennesse, and dicing, came to be divulged and spred to the world; that by three of his greatest creditors he is arrested and clapt into prison, and his shoppe seized on by them, which they finde as empty of drugges, as his masters heart was of pitty and his soule of piety: And as it is the nature and (or rather the misery) of prisons that where one man vertuously improves his life and actions their, a hundred doe vitiously ruine themselves, so Castruchio being one of this last number, he there wasteth and consumeth all that he hath, or which he can possibly procure, and in a few weeke reduceth himselfe to soe extreame poverty and beggery, that he is clapt into the common goale among the poorest sort of prisoners who live by the almes and charity of well disposed people, his clothes being all tottered and torne having no bed to lye on nor hardly bread to suffice nature, or to maintaine life being abandoned of all his friends and acquaintance; who will rather see him starve and dye then relieve him: And yet in all these extremities, and at the very lowest ebbe of these his wants and miseries, hee will yet neither looke downe into his Conscience, heart, and soule with sorrow, nor up to heaven or to God with repentance for all his foule sinnes and vices, especially not for this his cruell and lamentable poysoning of Planeze , which are the true reasons and the efficient causes of these his miserable calamities and afflictions, yea his wants and miseries are so great and infinite here in prison, that none whosoever will come thither to see him, muchlesse to pitty him, and least of all to releive him. Only Dorilla (a filthy old baud of his) more out of importunacy to her, then of her courtesie or charity to him, although she disdaine to goe herselfe into prison to see Castruchio , yet shee is contented sometimes to send him her sonne Bernardo , a boy of some sixteene yeares of age to goe his errands, so his necessity making his invention pregnant and cleere sighted, after hee had tyred all his friends and acquaintance with notes and Letters, which returne still empty fisted, his memory at the last falles and pitcheth on Borlari , who (for the bloody reason formerly mentioned) hee thinkes the onely fit man of the world to redresse his wants, and to releave his weather beaten fortunes, and to him hee often sends Bernardo with many pittifull requests and intreaties for money, but to write him he dares not. Borlari considering that he hath farre more cause and reason to love Castruchio then to hate him for that (by vertue of the premises) hee sees his owne life to lye at the mercy of his tongue, although hee rather wish him in Heaven then in prison, yet being extreamely covetous, and yet holding himselfe both in conscience and discretion bound to releive him; hee therefore sends him some small summes of money, but no way enough to buy him cloathes, or to maintaine his former prodigalities, but rather hardly sufficient to maintaine life in him, much lesse to cherish or pamper him. And so often doth Castruchio send the boy Bernardo to Borlari for money, that at last being weary thereof, and resolute to depart with no more money, (God here makes his covetousnesse partly the meanes to chaulke out a way to his owne confusion) and is resolved neither to speake nor to see Bernardo , and to that effect gives order to his servants: When little Bernardo seeing that he weares out his time, and his shooes in vaine to hunt after Borlari , whom he knowes will not be spoken with by him, he tels Castruchio that he provide himselfe of another messenger towards Borlari for he will goe no more to him, because he sees it is wholly impossible for him to speak with him: and at this discourtesie of Borlari, Castruchio doth now bite his lip with discontent and hung his head for anger, and from henceforth he begins to assume bad bloud, and to conceive dangerous thoughts against him, but as yet the consideration of his owne safety or danger makes him patient and silent; But God will not have him to continue so long, for almost presently we shall see his patience burst forth into violence and impetuosity, and his silence breake out into extreame choller and indignation against him. His old Baud Dorilla , (as an expert Hag of her sinnefull profession) as often as she heares or knowes that Castruchio had any mony from Borlari so often she would come to the prison to him, and speedily carouse and consume it with him, but when by her sonne Bernardo she sees his purse shut, that fountaine exhausted, and that her boy could no more see Borlari but a wod den face, I meane his doore shut, then she (resembling her selfe) againe forsakes Castruchio , and will neither see him nor come neere his prison, so that at last he not seeing Bernardo nor once hearing from Borlari in three weekes or well neere a moneth together and being ready to perish, starve and dye under the heavy burthen and pressure of his wants, hee earnestly sends for Dorilla to come to him, and causeth her to be informed, that if she will come to him and deliver a letter to a friend of his, he will speedily send him some store of mony, and then shee shall have a share and part thereof, so when no other respect or consideration will, then this of mony againe brings this old filthy Beldam Dorilla to the prison to Castruchio , who having provided her a bottle of wine, and five Gazettaes to drinke by the way (thereby the more carefully to effect his businesse hee exceedingly incensed with choller and revenge against Borlari for this ingratitude towards him) writes him this angry Letter and deepely chargeth Dorilla with speed, care, and secresie to deliver it into Borlari his owne hands and to no other, which Letter of his spake this language.  poysoned Seignior Planeze in a Vomit, and wilt thou now be so hard and cruell hearted against me to suffer me to dye in prison for want of so small a summe as twenty Dukatons. I am made of the same flesh and bloud as thou art, and although my fortunes be so low plunged yet my heart is so high seated and elevated, that I give thee to understand I will rather consent to bee hanged then starved: Wherefore because my Tragedy will infallibly prove thine, if thou meane to prevent the one, and to secure thy selfe from the other, faile not speedily to send me the said twenty Dukatons by this bearer Dorilla , whom I have entrusted with my letter fast sealed (and so maist thou with thine (but for the secret therein (which thou wotest of) she is wholly ignorant of it: In performing me this courtesie thou shalt not onely tye my tongue and pen but my heart and soule to silence, or else not: Amiddest thy wealth remember my poverty, which if thou forget, God hath reserved mee to make thee know that thou doest not use, but abuse it, and therein thy selfe. Castrvchio.  Dorilla receiving this Letter from Castruchio , she puts it into her purse and promiseth him her best care and fidelity for the delivery thereof to Seignior Borlari although she confesseth that she neither knew him nor his house: But see here the providence and mercy of God which cleerely resplends and shines in the deportment and action of this beastly old bawd, for she meeting with some of her gamesters and gossips in the street (though contrary to the custome of Italy ) away they goe to a taverne, where they all swill their head and braines with wine especially Dorilla: So the day being farre spent, her businesse for Castruchio is ended ere begun; for shee forgetting her selfe cannot remember his letter, but as fast as her reeling legges will permit her, away shee speedes towards her owne house, which was some halfe a mile off in the Citty. But when she was in the streets and had a little taken the aire, then she cals Castruchios letter to minde, and her promise to him to deliver it, but to whom (through her cups) she hath quite forgotten; for she cannot once hit on the name Borlari . But at last remembring the letter to be in her purse and she by this time in the midst of the Citty, she takes it out in her hand, & seeing a faire yet sorrowfull young Lady to stand at the street doore of her house all in mourning attire and no body neere her, after she had done her duty to her, she reacheth her the letter and humbly requesteth her to tell her the Gentlemans name to whom it was directed, when (God out of the profundity of his power and immensity of his pleasure having so ordained and ordered it, that this faire young Lady was our sweet Felisanna (who for the death of her deere husband Planeze had dighted her selfe al in mourning attire and apparel thereby the better to make it correspond with her heart: who reading the superscription therof and finding it directed to Seignior Borlari (by some motion or inspiration from heaven) her heart could not refrain from sending all the bloud of her body into her face, when demanding of this woman from whom this letter came: Dorilla (as drunke in her fidelity and innocency as shee was guilty of her drunkennesse) tels her that the letter came from an Apothecary who lay in prison named Castruchio : At the very repetition of which name, our Felisanna againe blusheth and then palleth, as if God had some newes to reveale her by this Letter, because shee remembreth that this Castruchio as we have formerly understood, was the very same Apothecary who gave her husband Planeze physicke a little before his death; Whereupon she praying Dorilla to come with her into her house because she purposly and politikely affirmed she could not read written hand herselfe but would pray her father to doe it, she leaves her in the utter hall and herselfe goes into the next roome, where breaking up the seales of this letter, she at the very first sight and knowledge that her husband was poysoned and by whom, and that God had now miraculously revealed it to her through the ignorance and drunkennesse of this old woman, she for meere griefe and sorrow is ready to fall to the ground in a swoone had not her father and some of his servants who over hearing her passionate outcries) come speedily to her assistance: which yet could not awake Dorilla , who had no sooner sate her selfe downe in a chaire in the hall but being top heavy with wine she presently fell asleepe. Miniata rousing up his fainting and sorrowfull daughter, brought her againe to herselfe; and seeing her in a bitter agonie and passion of sorrow, demands of her the cause thereof: when the brinish teares trickling downe her virmilion cheekes, she crossing her armes and fixing her eyes towards heaven, had the will but not the power to speake a word to him but reacheth him the Letter to read, Miniata perusing it, is as much astonished with griefe as his daughter is afflicted with sorrow at this poysoning of her Husband and his sonne in Law Planeze : so enquiring of her who brought her this letter, she after many sighes and pauses tels him, that it was the mercy and providence of the Lord who sent it her by a drunken woman who was forth in the Hall: They both goe to her and finding her fast sleeping and snoring, Miniata puls her by the sleeve and wakes her, and then demands of her, before his daughter and servants where and from whom she had this letter: who as drunke as this Baud is, she is constant in her first speech and confession to Felisanna that she had it from Castruchio an Apothecary who lay in prison, but she had forgotten to whom she was to deliver it, and then prayes them both to deliver and give her backe her letter againe. But Miniata seeing and knowing that it was the immediate finger of God which thus strangely had revealed this murther of his sonne in Law Planeze , he calls in two Gentlewomen his next neighbours to comfort his daughter. Felisanna , and so leaving Dorilla in the guard of two of his servants, he (with two other Gentlemen his neighbours) takes his Coach, and having Castruchio's Letter in his hand, he drives away to the State-house, where he findes out the Podestate and Prefect of the Citie, and shewing them the Letter which revealed the poysoning and poysoners of Planeze his sonne in Law, they (in honour to justice, and out of their respect to the sorrowfull Lady his daughter) take their Coaches, and returne with Miniata home to his house: Where they first examine Felisanna , and then Dorilla , who is constant in her first deposition. Whereat these grave and honourable Personages, wondring and admiring that a Gentleman of Borlari his ranke and quality, should make himselfe the guilty and bloudy Authour of so foule a Murther, they likwise admiring and blessing Gods providence in the detection thereof) doe presently send away their Isbieres (or Serjeants) to apprehend Borlari , and so they goe to their Forum (or seat of Iustice) and speedily send away for Castruchio to be brought from the prison before them: Who at the very first newes of their accusation of him, and the producing of his Letter to Borlari , he curseth the person and name of this old Bawd Dorilla , who is the prime Authour of his overthrow and death, and then confesseth himselfe to be the Actor, and Seignior Borlari to be the Authour, cause, and Instigator of this his poysoning of Planeze ; but never puts his hand on his conscience and soule, that the strange detection of this lamentable murther came directly from Heaven, and from God. The Serjeants (by order from the Podestate and Prefect) finde Borlari in his owne house, ruffling in a new rich suit of apparrell, of blacke Sattin, trimmed with gold buttons, which he that day put on, and the next was determined to ride to the City of Bergamo , to seeke in marriage a very rich young widdow, whose Husband lately died, drowning himselfe (as it were) in pleasure and security, without so much as once thinking of his poysoning of Planeze , or how he was revealed to be the Authour thereof by Castruchio his Letter, sent unto him by Dorilla ; He is amazed and astonished at this his apprehension, now bearing his brest, and then repenting (when it was too late) that ever he embrewed his hands in the innocent bloud of Planeze . So both himselfe and Castruchio are brought to the State house, where the Podestate and Prefect first examine them a part, and then confront them each with other. Where finding that neither of them deny, but both of them to confesse themselves guilty of this foule murther, they pronounce sentence of death against them, and condemne Borlary to have his head cut off, and then his body to be burnt; and Castruchio to be hanged; and his body to be throwne into the River of Addice , whereon he was first taken, the which the next morning was accordingly executed. All Verona is as it were but one tongue to talke and prattle of this foule and lamentable murther, and especially of Gods miraculous detection thereof by this drunken Bawd Dorilla , who having heretofore often brought Castruchio to whores willingly, now at last she brings him to the gallowes against her will. The morning they are brought to their execution, where there flocke and resort a world of spectators from all parts of the City. And although the charity of their Judges send them Priests and Fryers to direct their soules for heaven, yet this miserable wretch Castruchio , seeming no way repentant or sorrowfull for this his foule fact, uttered a short prayer to himselfe, and so caused the top-man to turne him over, which he did, and within two houres after his body was throwne into the River. But for Borlary he came to the scaffold better resolved and prepared; for with griefe in his lookes, and teares in his eyes, hee there delivered this short and religious speech: That he grieved in heart, and was sorrowfull in soule, for this lamentable murther of his committed on the person of Planeze , as also for seducing of Castruchio to effect it by poyson, for whose death he affirmed he was likewise exceedingly afflicted and sorrowfull: That it was the temptations of the flesh and the devill, who first drew him lustfully to affect the faire, chaste, and vertuous Lady Felisanna , and consequently to murther her husband, in full hope afterwards to obtaine her for his Wife, or for his Curtesan: That he was infinitely sorrowfull for all these his enormous crimes, for the which he religiously asked forgivenesse, first of God, and then of the Lady Felisanna , and likewise prayed all those who were there present, to pray unto God for his soule; that he was more carefull of his reputation towards men, than of his salvation towards God, and that his neglect of prayer, and of the participation of the blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, was the original cause of this his misery. So againe commending himselfe to the prayers, and recommending his sinfull, yet sorrowfull soule into the hands of his Redeemer, the sword of the Executioner at one blow made a perpetuall divorce betweene his soule and his body, which pious and Christian speech of his was as great a consolation to the vertuous, as his death, as that of Castruchio was a terrour to the vitious spectators and Auditors: So to confirme the sentence, the dead body of Borlary is presently burnt. And thus was the bloudy lives and deserved deaths of these three irreligious and unfortunate persons; Of Romeo the Laquey: Of Borlary the Gentleman; and of Castruchio the Apothecary. And in this manner did the justice of the Lord of Hosts (in due time) justly triumph o're their execrable crimes, in their sharp punishments, and shamefull ends. Pray we that we may reade this their History with feare, and as religious and godly Christians remember these their lamentable Murthers with horror and detestation. GODS REVENGE, AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable sinne of Murther.  Beaumarays and his brother Montagne kill Cahmpigny and Marin (his Second) in a Duell; Blancheville (the widdow of Champigny ) in revenge thereof, hireth Le Valley (servant to Beaumarays ) to murther his said Master with a Pistoll, which he doth; for the which Le Valley is broken on the wheele, and Blancheville hanged for the same.  face we can tread on Earth, or looke up to Heaven, when we stab at the Majestie of God, in killing aud murthering man, his image, a bloudy crime, so repugnant to nature, as reason abhorres it, a scarlet and crying sinne so opposite to grace, as God and his Angels detest it. And yet if ever Europe were stained or submerged with it, now it is, for as a swift current, or rather as a furious torrent it now flowes, and overflowes in most Kingdomes, Countries, and Cities thereof, in so much as (in dispight of divine and humane Lawes) it is now (almost) generally growne to a wretched custome, and that almost to a second nature. A fatall example whereof this ensuing History will report and relate us. Wherein Gods Iustice hath so sharply and severely punished the perpetrators thereof, that if we either acknowledge God for our Father, or our selves for his children and servants, it will teach us to be lesse revengfull, and more charitable by their unfortunate ends, and deplorable judgement. Citie of Chartres , (the Capitall of the fertile Countrey of Beausse ) so famous for her sumptuous Cathedrall Church, dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary , as also for that Henry the fourth, (that great King, and unparalleld Captaine of France ) during the combustions of the league, was (despight of the league) crowned therein. In which faire and pleasant City, as there still dwell some Noblemen, and many Gentlemen, in respect of the sweet aire, and goodly Champaigne Countrey thereabouts, (second for that to no other in France .) So of late yeares there resided two rich and brave young Gentlemen, well descended, being both of them heires to their two deceased fathers. The one of them named Monsieur De Champigny , and the other Monsieur De Beaumarays , and their Demaines and Lands lay within seven leagues of this City, in the way towards Vendosme . Now the better to see them in their true and naturall Characters: They were both of them tall and slender, and of faire and sanguine complexions, and very neere of an age: For Champigny was twenty six yeares old, and Beaumarays twenty foure, and yet the last had a beard, and the first none, and of the two Champigny was by farre the richer, but Beaumarays the Nobler descended. Now to lay this History upon its proper seat, and naturall foundation, we must understand that there was a very rich Counsellour of the Presidiall Court of Chartres , named Monsieur De Rosaire , whose wife being dead, left him no other childe, but one faire young daughter, of the age of some eighteene yeares, named Madamoyselle De Blanckeville , very tall and slender of stature, and of a wanne and pale complexion, and a Coale-blacke haire and eyes browes, and of deportment and gesture infinitely proud, coy, and imperious, to whom at one time both these our two Gentlemen, Champigny and Beaumarys were importunate Sutors, and passionate Rivals to marry her, in so much as the one of them could difficultly be absent from the fathers house, and daughters company, but the other was present, which engendred some malice, but more emulation betweene them. But in the end, (after a whole yeares research and more) as the Willow was destined and reserved for Beaumarays , so was the Laurell for Champigny ; for to his joy, Blanchevilles desire, and her fathers content, he marries her. Whereat Beaumarays knowing his birth to be more Noble, and his breeding farre more generous than that of Champigny , (though not in outward shew, yet in inward sense) was extreamly discontented and sorrowfull, but to remedy it he could not. In such and the like refusing accidents, discretion is ever farre better than passion, and contempt than care. But Beaumarays cannot or at least will not be of this temper. He forsakes reason to flie to choller, and so loseth his reall and solid judgement, in the Labyrinth of her imaginary beauty. For being at Supper in company of some five or six Gentlemen, where mention was made of Blancheville , hee transported with malice and revenge towards her, forgate himselfe so farre, as (between iest and earnest) to let fall these indiscreet and rash words, That she was more disdainfull than chaste: a speech which hee shall have time enough both to remember and repent. The honour of Ladies and Gentlewomen ought still to be deare and precious to all Gentlemen of Honour, because their losse thereof can seldome be repaired, but never so well or so fully recovered, but that there still remaines some staine or blemish thereof. This undeserved scandall of Beaumarays to his quondam Mistresse Blancheville , fals not to the ground, for the iniquity of our times, and the depravation of our manners are such, as there are few companies without a Foole or a Traytor to their friends, and some are accompanied with with both. Monsieur Marin a Gentleman of Chartres (more vaine than honest) will make himselfe one of this last number, for he being ambitiously desirous to skrew himselfe into the favour and familiarity of Blancheville , (whom from her infancie he affected and loved) reports and tels her this speech of Beaumarays , whereat she is exceedingly incensed and exasperated: But for that time (as a true woman) she dissembles her malice and revenge towards him, and so rakes up the memory thereof in the embers of silence; but yet with this condition and reservation, that hereafter she will take time to make it flame forth (towards him) with more violence and impetuosity. In the meane time there fals out an unexpected and untimely difference betweene her husband and Beaumarays , whereat she is so farre from grieving, as she rejoyceth: Beaumarays quarrelleth with him for his priority and precedency of seats in the Church, (as being both of one Parish) as also for that he takes the holy bread first, and goes before him in all Processions, as pretending it due to him by his right of extraction and propriety. Champigny is of too high a graine to yeeld that to him which he never yeelded, and is therefore resolute to justifie his equality of birth, and consequently not to wrong his ancestors in himselfe. When seing Beaumarays passionately bent to maintaine and preserve that which he had undertaken, he flies to Justice, and so presently puts him in suit of Law for the same, in the Presidiall Court of that Citie. Blancheville (whose pride in her selfe exceeded her birth, and whose malice and revenge towards Beaumarays at the least surmounted her discretion and reason) brings no water to quench, but oyle to inflame this quarrell betwixt him and her husband, when seeing them already entred into a deepe processe of Law; she disdaining to see her selfe thus abused, and her husband thus wronged by him, can reape no truce of her thoughts, nor they any peace of her choler, before she have written him these lines:  false and scandalous speeches to Monsieur Marin and others, but thou must now attempt to disgrace my Husband in the Church, and because these crimes of thine are so unjust and odious, as they deserve acknowledgement and satisfaction from afarre better Gentleman than thy selfe, therefore I speedily expect the performance thereof from thee, either by thy Letter or presence, which if thou deny us, we will make thee know what it is to abuse thy selfe and us in points of these high natures, whereof the first cannot, the second will not admit of any other excuse or expiation. But to write thee now the truth of my minde; as thou hast heretofore vented me the malice of thy heart, I have not as yet acquainted my Husband herewith, or with this my Letter. Consider therefore seriously with thy selfe what thou hast to doe herein, for the vindication of my honour, and thine owne discretion, and as soone as I receive thy answer and resolution, I will not faile speedily to returne thee mine. Blancheville.  Having written this her Letter, she is irresolute with her selfe by whom to send it him, but at last shee sends it by her Chamber-maid Martha , to whom only she entrusteth this great secret, and chargeth her to deliver it to Beaumarays his owne hands, and to crave his answer thereof. Martha being a witty faire maid, of some two and twenty yeares of age, goes to Beaumarays house, and speaks with a young man of his, named Le Valley , who tels her, that his Master is now busie with two Gentlemen in his study, and that she shall immediately speake with him as soone as they depart. In the interim his eyes cannot refraine from amorously gazing and ranging upon the excellencie of her blushing beauty, and upon her sweet vermillion cheeks, great rolling eyes, and flaxen haire, wherewith his heart at the very first encounter is surprized and ravished. Here Le Valley kisseth and re-kisseth Martha , and entertaines her with much prattle, and many pleasant love speeches, yea, then and there loves her so dearly, as hee vowes she shall remaine his Mistresse, and hee her servant till death. So some halfe an houre after the two Gentlemen take leave of his Master, and then Le Valley brings Martha to him, who orderly delivers him her Mistresses Letter and message, so he wondring at the last, receives the first, leaves her in the Hall with his man Le Valley , and so steps to his study, and with much admiration, and more laughture, peruseth this Letter. Here he accuseth his owne indiscretion in speaking against Blanchevilles chastity; and exceedingly condemneth Marins treachery in revealing it to her. Once he was of opinion to have returned her his answer by Letter, but at last scorning her and that resolution, he then contrariwise resolves to answer her with silence, and so steps forth to Martha , and with a disdainfull frowning looke, bids her tell her Mistresse from him, that her malitious, proud, and foolish Letter shall have no other answer from him but contempt  & silence. Martha yet holds it her duty to pray him for his answer in writing to her Mistresse, but Beaumarays his first resolution is his last, so she departeth from him infinitely discontented. But the Master is not so unkinde to Martha , as his man Le Valley is courteous; For he being deeply enamoured of her beauty, brings her the one halfe of her way home, and goes into a Mercers shop, buyes her a faire paire of gloves, and as the pledge of his future affection, bestowes them on her, the which (without farther excuse or ceremony) she thankfully accepts, and promiseth him to weare them for his sake. Martha returning home to her Lady and Mistresse, she delivers her Beaumarays his answer verbatim as he told it her, but no Letter. Blancheville seeing herselfe thus wronged and sleighted of him, in that he disdaineth to give her any satisfaction, and which is worse, that he peremptorily refuseth, and scornes to answer her Letter: She is so strangely transported with malice and choler towards him for the same, as shee vowes to cry quittance, and to be revenged of him; but as yet she knowes not in what manner to performe and perpetrate it: Onely she againe resolves not as yet to acquaint her Husband therewith, but to attend and watch for some future desired opportunity. Two yeares are almost past away, wherein Beaumarays and Champigny (to their great cost and charge) doe vehemently contest in Law about their Church quarrell for precedency, but they doe it farre more out of malice towards themselves, than any way out of pietie towards God. And as most of the great Iudiciall Courts of France are too too frequently oppressed with Law suits of this nature, so I may affirme with as much truth as pity, that this is a fatall rocke whereon many hot contentious French spirits doe most inconsiderately suffer shipwracke. At the end of which time (as the losse of one party proves still the gaine of the other) the Presidiall Court of Chartres pronounceth sentence in favour of Beaumarays , adjudging him the precedencie in the Church, and condemning Champigny in five hundred Crownes charge and dammage to Beaumarays . This thundering sentence so prejudiciall and contrary to Champigny his proud wives hopes and expectation, drives him into extreame choller, and her out of all patience towards Beaumarays . Hee bites his lip with griefe, and his wife in enflamed with rage at the report and knowledge hereof, and although he were once minded to appeale from this sentence of the Presidiall Court of Chartres , to the Court of Parliament at Paris , yet being powerfully diverted by his best friends, he as soone abandoneth as embraceth that resolution. He cannot see Beaumarays but with envie, nor his wife heare speake of him but with infinite malice and detestation. She is all bent on revenge towards him, and with her speeches and actions both day and night precipitates her husband onwards to it. And now her old grudge and malice against him beginnes a fresh to revive and flourish, and now she thinks it a very fit time and opportunity to acquaint her husband with Beaumarys his base and scandalous speeches against her honour, the which with much passion, and many teares she effects, and also shewes him the Coppy of her Letter which she sent him by her maid Martha , whereunto she informes him, he disdainfully returned her no answer but contempt and silence. Champigny is so deeply incensed hereat against Beaumarays , as his wife needs not many words or circumstances to induce and perswade him to revenge it on him: when presently he being as incapable of delay, as of better advise and counsell, he finds out Marin , who (more in love to Blancheville , than in hatred to Beaumarays ) confirmes as much to him as he would have him affirme. Now as Blancheville thinks that her Husband Champigny will question Beaumarays by the Law of Iustice, for this his crime towards her: He (as a valiant and generous Gentleman) flies a higher pitch, and assumes a contrary resolution, to doe it by that of his sword. When having prayed,  & procured Marin to be his Second, and they both agreeing to fight on horse backe, he (consulting with nature, not with grace) the very next morning by Seron his foot man, sends Beaumarays this Challenge.  ignoble speeches thou hast falsly vomited forth against the honour and chastity of my wife. And because crimes of this nature are still odious to men, and execrable to God, and no way to be tolerated by a friend, much lesse to be digested and suffered by a Husband: Therefore thanke thy selfe, if (for reparation hereof) thy folly now call on thy valour, to invite thee and thy Second, to meet me and mine, with your swords on horse backe, on Tuesday next, betweene six and seven in the morning, without the North hedge of the very first Vineyard beyond the River, where you shall finde we will attend you, and comparing the equitie of my cause, to the injustice and infidelity of thine, it makes me fully confident that the issue of this Duell will prove glorious for me, and shamefull and ruinous for thy selfe. Champigny.  Serou (according to his charge and duty) finds out Beaumarays in his owne house, and very secretly gives him his Masters Letter; who much musing thereat, steps to the window, and there privately reads it to himselfe: When blushing and smiling to see the bold folly of Champigny , the foolish malice of his wife Blancheville , and the base treachery of Marin towards him, hee is so couragious and generous, as he disdaines to be out-braved by any man whatsoever in the point of honour, (which he esteemes farre dearer and precious than his life) especially by Champigny , whom he holds to be as much his inferiour in valour as bloud. He therefore trips to his study, and writes Champigny this Letter the which he returnes by his footman in answer of his.  of thy wifes chastity or unchastity. It is sufficient for me to leave her to herselfe, and herselfe to thee. Marin shall have time enough to repent his treacherie towards me, and thou to exchange thy jealousie into Iudgement. But because I see thy choller now exceeds all the bounds of reason, for that thou art so inconsiderately and rashly audatious, to seeke and preserve thy wifes honour with the losse and ruine of mine, know therefore that to cherish and maintaine it equally with my life, I cheerefully accept thy challenge, and doe hereby give thee to understand that I with my second, will at the time and place appointed meet thee and thine on horsebacke, where wee doubt not but to acquit our selves, as our selves, and to make thee and thine acknowledge that our swords are composed of a good temper, and our hearts of a better, and consequently that you may perchance meet with your superiours aswell in valour as in bloud and extraction. Beavmarays.  He hath no sooner ended this his letter but he presently beginnes to thinke of his second, when calling to minde his owne younger brother Le Montagne (a young Gentleman of some twenty yeares of age) is brave and valiant, and that he hath already fought two Duels, and in both of them came off with his honour, he sends for him to his closet and there shewes him Champigny his challenge and his answer thereunto, and demands of him if he have any stomacke to second him at this feast, his brother Montagne highly applauds his generous resolution for accepting this challenge, thankes him for the honour and favour he now doth him in making him his second, vowes that if he had many lives as he hath but one, hee is ready to sacrifice them all at his feet and service, and couragiously tels him hee should have taken it for a sensible affront, disgrace and injury, if hee had made choice of any other then himselfe: So they both prepare their horses, swords and courages against the approching time, and no lesse doth Champigny and Marin . Beaumarays and his brother Montagne conceale this businesse from all the world; and Champigny beares it so close and secret, as he makes not his ambitious and malitious wife acquainted therewith, but in favour of his love to her beauty and reputation to himselfe, smothers it up in silence. Tuesday morning being come, our foure impatient champions are in the fields at their Rendez-vous: first arrive Champigny and Marin , and presently after them Beaumarays and his brother Montagne , all of them being bravely mounted upon neighing and trampling coursers: At their entrance Marin comes with a soft trot towards Beaumarays thinking to apologize himselfe to him: But Beaumarays is so brave and generous as he is deafe to his speeches, and will not heare him, but tels him that it is swords not tongues which must now decide their difference, and prove him innocent or guilty: So Marin missing of his aime, he returnes againe upon the same trot to Champigny , and now according to the order and nature of Duels it is ordered between those foure desperate Gentlemen, that their principals shall search the seconds, and the seconds the principals, to see whether their doublets were any more then sword proofe, but they might well have saved themselves that labour, for they are all of them too noble and valiant any way to taint their reputations and honours with the least shadow or tincture of cowardize, so they cast of their doublets, devide themselves, and then draw, and the first which must and will try their fortunes, are Champigny and Beaumarays , who being some fourescore paces off, they give the Spurres and reines to their horses, and part as swift as the winde, or rather so furiously and suddenly as two claps of thunder or flashes of lightning: At their first encounter Beaumarays runnes Champigny through his shirt band into the right side of his necke, and Champigny him into his left shoulder, whereat reciprocally inflamed as Lyons, they make short turnes with their horses and so fall to it amaine with their swords, when againe Beaumarays gives Champigny two other wounds, and he returnes him one in counterexchange, whereof neither of them being mortall they againe devide themselves to breath, which having done and both of them as yet unsatisfied, they part the second time, at which cloze Champigny misseth Beaumarays and hurts his horse in the necke, but Beaumarays gives Champigny a licke with his sword ore his forehead which bled exceedingly, but yet they are too couragious to desist, as scorning rather then caring for the number of their wounds. They to it againe the third time, which proves as fortunate for Beaumarays as fatall for Champigny , for as his horse stumbleth on his fore-feet Beaumarays in his bending runnes him thorow the body a little above his left pappe, where his sword meeting and cutting the strings of his heart, hee presently in a fainting and faltering language spake these his last words Beaumarays I forgive thee my death, and God be mercifull unto my Soule , And with the same fell starke dead from his horse to the ground: When Beaumarays as a noble Gentleman leapt presently from his horse to his assistance and so did his owne second Marin , but their charity and care to him was in vaine, for already life had forsaken his body, and consequently his soule was fled to his place: So he lies there gored in his bloud, and whiles Marin was covering of his breathlesse body with his cloake; Beaumarays sheathes up his sword, and with hands and eyes elevated to heaven rendreth thanks to God for this his victory. No soonerhath Montagne congratulated with his brother Beaumarays for this his good fortune, but with a heart and courage worthy of himselfe, hee calles out to his Rivall Marin and bids him prepare to fight: When his brother Beaumarays notwithstanding his losse of much bloud, doth infinitely desire to spare his Brother Montagne from fighting with Marin , and so to performe it himselfe. But Montagne is too couragious and generous either to understand this motion, or to relish this language from his brother, and so in hot words and high tearmes, he peremptorily tels him: That he came to fight with Marin, and fight hee would : whereupon his brother Beaumarays gives him his prayers, commits him to his good fortune and so with his cloake muffled about him; sits downe a Spectator to their combat: When Montagne remounting his steed, hee calles out againe to Marin and bids him prepare to fight. Marin no way appalled or daunted with the unfortunate disaster of his principall but rather the more exasperated and incouraged thereat, he as a valiant Gentleman vowes to sell and requite his death deerly on the life of his adversary Montagne : to which end they devide themselves and draw, and so part each towards other I know not whether with more swiftnesse or courage: At their first encounter Narin runnes Montagne into the small of the belly of a sleight wound, and in exchange he cuts Marin a great slash on his left cheeke which hangs downe and bleeds exceedingly: When presently closing againe; Montagne runs Marin into the right thigh  & he him in requital into the right arme, and then they devide themselves to take breath, and all these their wounds being as yet incapable to appease or satisfie their courages, they presently determine againe to fall to it with bravery and resolution: When behold the Marquis of Bellary (the Titular King of Ivetot ) with two Lords his Sonnes, and their traine passeth that way from Chartres to goe to Paris and seeing two Gentlemen on Horsebacke in their shirts with their swords drawne, hee judgeth it a Duell, when hee and his two sonnes gallop into the little meddow joyning to the Vineyard to prevent and part them, but they came too late; for Montagne and Marin seeing them swiftly galloping towards them, they (to prevent them) with more haste then good speed, set spurres to their horses the sooner, and at this there second meeting Montagne warding Marins sword and putting it by, doth at the very same Instant runne him thorow the body a little below his navell, of which mortall wound, hee fell presently from his horse dead to the ground, uttering onely these words: O Montaigne, thou hast slaine mee: Thou hast slaine mee, God receive my Soule: and then and their without speaking a word more immediately dyed. No sooner hath Montagne wiped  & sheathed up his sword, but his joyful brother Beaumarays gallops up to him and cheerefully congratulates with him for the same: When instantly the Marquis of Bellay and the two Lords his Sons, arrive to them though a little too late: They are astonished to see two proper Gentlemen lye their slaine in the field and reeking in their hot bloud: when turning to Beaumarays and his brother Montagne whom they knew, they congratulate with them for their victories, and the Marquis as briefely as his time and their wounds will permit, enquire of them the cause of there quarrel and the manner and particulars of their combat, whereof being fully informed and satisfied by them, hee sends the dead bodies of Champigny and Marin to Chartres in his Coach: And understanding by Beaumarays and his brother Montagne that for the preservation of their safeties and lives they were resolved to leave Chartres and Beausse , and so thwarting ore Normandy by Euereux and Lesieux to embarke themselves for Caen and thence to passe the Seas into England till their friends in their absence had procured their grace and pardons from the King, as also that they were destitute both of Chirurgions to dresse their wounds and of a guide to conduct them thither; Hee very nobly gave them his owne Chirurgion and guide, and promising them likewise to labour with the King to the utmost of his power for their peace, he passeth on his Iourney and commits them to the best fortune: A singular, yea an honourable courtesie of this brave old Marquis of Bellay whose deserts and fame I should much wrong, if I gave not the relation and memory of his name a place in this History. Whiles thus the Marquis of Bellay is travelling towards Paris , and Beaumarays and his brother Montagne posting for Caen , come we briefely to Chartres which now resounds and ratles with the report and issue of this combate, where Gentlemen Cittizens and all (according to their passions and affections speake differently thereof; some condemne the vanity of Beaumarais , others the folly and treachery of Marin , but all doe highly extoll the courage and generosity of Champigny and Montagne . But leave we them to their censures, and come we againe to speake of Blancheville who takes the newes of this untimely death of her husband so tenderly and sorrowfully that shee is ready to drowne herselfe in her teares, It is not onely a griefe to her heart to see, but a terrour to her conscience to know, that her husband Champigny and her friend Marin , have both of them lost their lives for her sake, and when againe shee falls on the consideration and remembrance, that the first dyed by the hand and sword of Beaumarays , her mortall enemy, and the second by that of his Brother Montagne , then she is againe ready to burst her heart and brest with sighing thereat. She is so uncapable of Counsell, as she will heare of no consolation, nor speake of any thing but of her malice and revenge toward Beaumarays , and to write the truth, this implacable wrath and revenge of hers to him, takes up all her thoughts and speeches, her contemplations and actions, and both her time and her selfe. To which end shee converts most of her Corne and Wine into money, goes to Paris , casts herselfe at the Kings feet, and to the feet of that great and illustrious Court of Parliament for Iustice, against Beaumarays the murtherer of her husband, the which againe and againe shee aloud resounds and ecchoes forth to their eares, yea her rage is so great and her malice so outragious towards him, that notwithstanding his body is absent, yet she spends five hundred Crownes in law to have him according to the law and custome of France to bee hanged up in effigie : But although her fute be just, yet (by reason of his great friends in Court) shee sees herselfe so unfortunate that shee cannot obtaine it. Whereupon after twelve monethes vaine stay in Paris and a profuse expence of money, shee (with much griefe and sorrow) secretly vowes to herselfe, that if ever hee returne againe to Chartres , or which is more, into France, that shee herselfe will bee both his Iudge and Executioner, by revenging her Husbands death in his, and from this hellish resolution of hers she deepely sweares, that neither Earth nor Heaven shall divert her. Now to follow the naturall streame and tyde of this History: Wee must againe bring Beaumarays and his brother Montagne on the stage thereof: For the Reader must understand, that their wounds being dressed and secured having bestowed both of their horses on the Chyrurgeon and guide, the two servants of the aforesaid Marquis of Bellay , and likewise written him a thankfull Letter for his honourable courtesie extended to them, and therewith likewise prayed him to solicite the King for their Grace and pardon in their absence, they privately (without any followers) embarque themselves upon an English vessell at Caen and so with a prosperous gale arrive at Rie , and from thence take Horse for London , where they settle up their aboad and residence, from whence Beaumarais sends to Chartres for two of his footmen, and his Brother Montagne for one of his, which come over to London to them some six weekes after, and brings their masters word, how earnestly and violently their adversaries follow the rigour and severity of the Law against them in Paris , but especially against Beaumarays , they receive these advertisements from their servants and friends, rather with griefe then contempt, and therefore to prevent their malice, and their owne disgrace and danger, they often write from London to Paris to the Marquesse of Bellay , and likewise to the Bishop of Chartres (their deere friend and kinsman) to hasten their pardons from the King: So that Noble Lord, and this reverend Prelate, pitying their danger and absence, as much as they wish their safety and returne, take time at advantage, and the King in a well disposed humour, and so doe most effectually and powerfully acquaint his Majesty; how these two absent Gentlemen and brothers Beaumarays and Montagne were without just cause or reason provoked to this unfortunate combate by their adversaries; that they were the Challenged, not the Challengers; that heretofore they had never committed any act unworthy either of their honour, or of themselves: That for their vertues and generosity they were beloved of all their Countrey and acquaintance: That they had formerly received many wounds in his Majesties warres; and that their valour and courage was such, that in these times, which threatned more troubles than promised peace, they would undoubtedly prove happy and necessary members for his service, with many other prevailing motives and reasons conducing that way; which at last so weigh downe the heart and minde of the King, that he freely conceded and gave them their pardons under his great Seale, the which to make the more authenticall, they caused them to be enregistred and confirmed by the Court of Parliament of Paris , and thereupon both the Marquesse and Bishop joyntly and speedily writ to them thereof from Paris . And after some five moneths of their stay in London , they send them over these their Pardons, which are delivered to them by the Earle of Tillieres , then ordinary Ambassadour there for this present French King, Lewis xiij. the which they receive with infinite honour, content, and joy. This good newes of theirs makes them now like the aire of France better than that of England. So they speedily packe up their baggage, leave London , and with all celerity poast away Dover, Callais , and Paris . Where being arrived, the first thing they doe, they finde out the Marquis of Bellay , and the Bishop of Chartres , to whom they owe their peace, as they doe their lives to the King: To whom they expresse a thousand demonstrations of thankfulnesse for this their honour and favour shewed them. They likewise burne with desire to testifie so much to the King, when the Marquis, seconded by the Bishop, present them to his Majestie, who falling to his feet, hee gives them his Royall hand to kisse. They can better expresse their thankfulnesse in deeds than words to him, and in language of their swords, than in that of their tongues: Onely they tell his Majestie, that having received their lives of his meere clemencie and Royall favour, they most humbly therefore implore him to grant them the favour and honour, that they may spend and end them in his service. He allowes of their zeale and humility, and to redouble his favour, he gives them againe his hand to kisse, adding farther to them, that it is rather likely than impossible, that he shall shortly have occasion to use their swords and service, and so dismisseth them. These our two brothers remaine a moneth in Paris , wherein almost daily they tender their thankfull respects and service to the Marquis and Bishop, at the end wherof leaving their duties, and receiving their commands, they take horse and returne home for Chartres , (from which by reason of their disaster they have beene so long absent) where all their kinsfolks and friends welcome them home with infinite delight and joy, yea, almost all Chartres and the Gentlemen thereabouts, exceedingly rejoyce of their fortunate and safe returnes. Onely the Parents of Marin doe envie Montagne deeply, and Blancheville , the sorrowfull and incensed widdow of Champigny , hate Beaumarays deadly. As for Montagne he makes such good meanes and friends, that in lesse than two moneths he obtaines a perfect reconciliation of the first; but although Beaumarays have made many faire overtures and proffers of attonement by his friends to the second, yet in six moneths he sees it is wholly impossible for him to procure it of her, and which is worse, she is still so outragious and revengefull towards him, that he thinks he never shall; for shee disdaines to see him, and scornes to heare of him; and still her malice and indignation against him, makes her constant in her former hellish and bloudy resolution, that by one meanes or other she will ere long murther him, as he hath her Husband: A fearfull and most execrable resolution, every way unworthy the heart of a Gentlewoman, and farre more the soule of a Christian. In the former part of this History we have understood the affection of Le Valley (Beaumarays his man) to Martha, Blanchevilles Chambermaid. In the middle thereof we have remarked and seene the implacable intended malice and revenge of Blancheville towards Beaumarays: And wee shall nor goe farre before the end hereof will enforme us what mournfull fruits, and deplorable effects, these different accidents and persons will procure us. As there is no love to that of a man, so I am of opinion, that there is no malice comparable to that of a woman, and if the truth deceive not my judgement herein, I beleeve wee shall shortly see the Antitheses of this position made good and verified in the persons of Le Valley , and Blancheville . For whiles Le Valley is lovingly thinking and inventing all possible meanes how hee may marrie Martha ; so is Blancheville malitiously pondering and ruminating with her selfe how or by what meanes or agents she may murther Beaumarays . Thus we see that the heart of the first is as full of kindnesse and courtesie, as the mind and resolutions of the second is of cruelty and bloud. Now the Reader for his better information, will I hope remember, that in all this time of two yeares and upwards, since Le Valley first saw and spake with his sweet heart Martha , in his Masters house, that there hath past many love tokens betweene them, but as yet he could never draw her consent to marry him; for still shee tels him that she loves her Mistresse so dearly, that she will not depart from her service, nor wed any man, without her free consent, and therefore that they have farre more reason to doubt than to hope of this match betweene them, considering the lamentable accident  & disaster which hath past between their Masters. Le Valley seeing he must first winne the Mistresse, before he can wed the maid, with his sweet hearts advise, resolves to seeke Blanchevilles consent thereto, the which hee doth in faire and orderly tearmes. Blancheville who had formerly heard an inkling how dearly Le Valley affected her maid Martha in the way of mariage, now by this his motion thereof to herselfe, she is fully confirmed thereof. When observing more passion than judgement, as well in his affection to her maid, as in his speeches to her selfe, she presently (being industrious in her malice, and vigilant in her revenge towards Beaumarays ) forgets God and all goodnesse, abandoneth all Christianity and humanity, and so the devill brings her a plot, or else her owne heart and head fetcht it from hell: She thinks that this poore servant Le Valley , is a fit agent and instrument for her, either to poyson or pistoll his Master Beaumarays to death, and that his love to her maid Martha , and his consideration of her fresh youth and beauty, is a sufficient bait, and powerfull lure to make him undertake and performe it, and hereon she settles up her bloudy resolution. To which end Blancheville having already sufficiently woven this treachery in her heart, and closely and finely spunne it in her braines, shee politickly gives Le Valley more hope than despaire, that he shall shortly marrie her maid Martha ; onely shee tels him shee must first conferre with her, to see how shee stands affected to him, and that if hee repaire to her againe at the end of the weeke, shee will then assuredly give him such an answer, as she doubts not but will content and please him, or else the fault shall be his: But to conclude her speech, shee chargeth him not to speake or utter a word hereof to his Master Beaumarays , all which Le Valley faithfully promiseth her to performe. He goes from the Mistresse to the maid, and reports what she hath told and spoken, so these young folkes flatter themselves, that they very shortly shall be man and wise. Blancheville (whose heart and minde runnes wholly upon a bloudy revenge towards Beaumarays ) no sooner understands that Le Valley is gone forth her doores, but she sends for her maid Martha into her chamber, where (no way acquainting her with her bloudy intent and policie) she chargeth her to sweare that she will never marrie Le Valley without her free consent, and that in the end she shall not repent the following of her advise and counsell herein, which Martha solemnly doth, whereof this malitious and vindictive Dame is exceedingly glad and satisfied. The end of the weeke being come, away comes Le Valley to his sweet heart Martha , to know if she be shortly resolved to marry him, who having beene perfectly taught her lesson, tels him plainly, that shee will be his wife, conditionally that he can gaine her Mistresse Blanchevelles consent thereunto, but never without it. Whereof he being exceedingly joyfull, hee giving her many kisses, intreats her to bring him to her Mistresse, and that he hopes to receive pleasing newes from her, to both their contents. Blancheville (with much longing impatiencie (attends his comming, and receives and welcomes him into her Closet with a cheerfull countenance, where bolting the doore, this hellish Erinnis (not heavenly Vrania ) passionately tels him, that it shall be impossible for him ever to enjoy or marrie her maid Martha , except he first sweare to her to performe a secret businesse for her, which infinitely concernes her content and service. Le Valley desires to know of her what it is, but shee first sweares him to secrecie herein, both from Martha , and from all the world, the which he freely sweares: When Blancheville (with hypocriticall, yea, with diobolicall teares in her eyes) being instructed and prompted by the devill, representeth unto him, how fouly his Master Beaumarays had first wronged her chastity and honour, then abused her husband in the Church, and afterwards killed him in the field, and therefore that hee should not onely marry her maid Martha , but that she would likewise give him three hundred Crowns of marriage money with her, if for her sake, and at her request) he would kill his said Master, either by poyson, Ponyard, or Pistoll, of which summe shee told him he should have the one halfe in hand, and the other when hee had performed it, the which if he refused to doe, shee swore by her part of Heaven, that he should never marrie her, nor come neare her. Le Valley is amazed and astonished at this bloudy proposition and request of hers, the which she might well perceive by the distraction of his looks, and the perturbation of his countenance. He tels her, that although he loves Martha farre dearer than his life, yet hee cannot finde in his heart to kill the poorest Christian in the world, much lesse so good and so deare a Master as Beaumarays was to him. Blancheville (being now as subtill in her malice, as she was malitious in her revenge towards Beaumarays ) shewes Le Valley the three hundred Crownes in faire gold) which was farre more than ever before he had seene, Tels him what a deare friend she will ever remaine to him and his wife, and (in a word) leaves no lure unpractised, nor charme unattempted, to draw him to the enterprize of this deplorable, and to the execution of this hellish fact. But finding him as frozen as she was fiery therein, she bids him to take a weeks time to consider thereof, then to bring her his last resolution, and with all to remember his oath of secrecie herein from all the world, both which points he constantly promiseth her to performe. As he descends the stairs from her, his sweet heart Martha comes presently to him to know the minde and resolution of her Mistresse, whom he thinks good then to satisfie with this pleasing answer, that hee hopes a small time will worke and compasse both their desires. So after a few kisses and embraces, they for that time take leave each of other. He is no sooner returned home, but his heart is as pensive and sorrowfull, as his minde and braine is perplexed and troubled for the cause thereof. He consults with himselfe, and his resolutions are as different as his desires. He cannot as yet finde in his heart to kill his Master, and yet hee can resolve rather to die than to lose Martha his Mistresse. True it is, that the sight of the Lady Blanchevilles gold doth act wonders in his hearts, but farre more the sight  & remembrance of Marthas sweet youth  & delitious beauty: So the first tempts him exceedingly, the second extreamly, and the devill in both of them infinitely; yet notwithstanding his faith and soule are so strong with God, that hitherto hee cannot consent or bee drawne to imbrue his hands in the innocent bloud of his Master. But here befals an unexpected accident, which violently precipitates and throwes him headlong on the contrary resolution. His Master Beaumarays (not for want of any respect or love to Blancheville , but because hee perfectly knew shee extreamly hated him) having formerly charged his man Le Valley that he should not frequent her house, nor no more dare to seeke her maid Martha in mariage, the which he confidently promised him he would: He now understands that contrary thereunto, his man Le Valley the very day before was there, and continued still an earnest sutor to her; so he hereupon cals him to him, and gives him five or fix sound boxes on the eare, for his disobeying him, and vowes that if he ever any more returne thither, and seeke Martha in marriage, he would utterly cashier him, and wholly discharge him from his service. Le Valley not accustomed to receive blowes of his Master, was so extreamly incensed hereat, as disdaining the blowes for his Master, and his Master for the blowes sake, they engender such bad bloud in him, as he presently strikes a bargaine, first with his choller, then with the Devill, that he would now adhere to the request of Blancheville , and so speedily returne his Master a sharp requitall and bloudy revenge for the same; and indeed from that time forwards he never looked on him but with an eye of hatred and detestation. So without farther delay, the same night as soone as his Master was gone to bed, hee trips away to Blanchevilles house, informes her at large what had past betwixt his master and himselfe, and therefore assures her that he is fully and constantly resolved to murther him within three or foure dayes, if she would performe her promise to him, to give him the three hundred Crownes, and that also within a moneth after hee shall marrie Martha , whereat Blancheville being beyond measure joyfull, she faithfully and solemnly sweares him the performance thereof when (as a pledge of the rest) she presently payes him downe the first hundred and fifty in gold, the which Le Valley joyfully purseth up. But the receit thereof shall cost him deare. From the intended matter of the murther of Beaumarays , these two agents of Satan and Hell, Blancheville and Le Valley , proceed to the manner thereof, she proposeth that infernall drugge poyson, but he rejecteth it, as dangerous to be bought, and difficult to be applied. And because she dislikes to have him poniarded, therefore they both conclude and agree, that he shall pistoll him to death, and this is their difinitive, cruell, and hellish resolution. Le Valley having thus dispatcht his businesse with Blancheville , and taken leave with kisses of his sweet Martha , (who poore soule is as innocent, as they two are wholly and solely guilty of this deplorable conspiration) he puts a cheerfull countenance on his revengfull heart, so returnes home, and the very next day gets his Masters pocket pistoll, which he loads with a brace of bulletts, and watcheth every day and houre for a desired opportunity to send him to heaven. So the third day after Monsieur Montagne going abroad a hawking with his brothers Hawks and Spannels, and taking almost all his men servants with him, and leaving Le Valley to wait and attend on his Master, then and there this fatall occasion answered his prodigious expectation. For that very Fore-noone, his Master Beaumarays comming from the house of office, hee cals up Le Valley to him in his chamber to trusse his points, which wretched Villaine he is busie in performing, but alas, in most barbarous and bloudy manner: For as that good and Noble Gentleman thought of nothing lesse than of his danger or death, then this monster of nature fingering his hinde points with his left hand, very softly drew his Pistoll out his pocket with his right, and then and there (with an infernall courage and audacity) shot him into the reynes of his backe, nearly opposite to his heart, whereof he presently fell downe dead to the ground, without having either the power or happinesse to utter on prayer or word whatsoever, but onely two or three small fainting, or indeed dying groanes. This bloudy and execrable wretch Le Valley , seeing his Master dead, he triumphs in his good fortune, to see what a brave Butcher he had proved himselfe in so speedily and neatly dispatching him. When to put the better varnish on his villany, and so to make it appeare to the world, that his Master was his owne murtherer, hee taketh the pistoll and placeth it in his dead right hand, layes the key of the Chamber upon the Table, and the doore having a strong Spring-locke, puls and shuts it fast after him. When againe, to make his innocencie the more cleare and conspicuous to the world, he speedily and secretly taking a horse out of the stable, a Hawke on his first, and a Spanniell at his heels, and so very joyfully and cheerfully gallops away to the fields, where (after some houre at least, or houre and halfe at most) hee finds out Monsieur Montagne , and tels him his Master dispatcht him to him with a fresh Hawke, which was his best and chiefest Gashawke. They Hawke all day together, and Le Valley (as accustomed) is very officious and diligent to Monsieur Montagne , who towards night returnes home to Chartres , having (betweene them all) taken eight Partridges and one Phesant. Hee arrives at his brothers house, where missing him, he gives the Phesant and foure of the Partridges to the Cooke to dresse for their Supper; when afterwards againe missing his brother Beaumarays , and enquiring for him, the meniall servants of the out-houses tell him they saw him not to day. Supper being preparing, and the Table covered, he sends up Le Valley to looke him in his chamber, who returnes him this answer, that his Master is not there, but the doore is shut: Montagne marvelleth at his brothers long (and unaccustomed) absence, and so doe all his Servants. They finde his Cloake, Rapier and Belt, hanging up at a pinne in the Hall, and therefore deeming him not farre, but at some neighbours house, he sends Le Valley one way, and the rest of the servants to other places to finde him out; but whiles they seeke after him, Le Valle (favoured by the night) trips away speedily to the Lady Blanchevilles house, and there most briefly and secretly acquaints her how bravely hee hath dispatched his Master that forenoone, shee cannot Containe herselfe for Ioy of this sweet newes, nor expresse it to him in lesse then a Kisse, he saies he will tell her the rest to morrow night and then come and receive the remainder of her promise to him, the which she againe and againe sweares to him shee will performe it with a surplusage and advantage, so hee kisseth his sweet heart Martha , and againe dispeeds himselfe home: Where he and the rest of the servants who were sent into the streetes returne Montagne no newes of their master his brother: Supper being more then fully ready, his long missing of him doth at last bring him much doubt, and some suspition and feare of his wellfare. It runnes still in his mind that he may be yet a sleepe in his Chamber; wherfore he ascends thither with Le Valley and others of his Servants, who call a loud and bounce amaine at the doore, but they heare no answer nor speech of him, the which doth the more augment his doubt and redouble his feare of his Brother: At last he commands them to force and breake open the doore, but it being exceeding thick and strong, they cannot, Montagnes tender care of his brother doth by this time infinitely encrease his feare of him, which at last so powerfully surpriseth him, that he presently commands a Ladder to be erected to his brothers chamber window towards the garden, and sends up one of his Laqueyes with a torch to looke into the chamber, the laquey forceth open the casement, and then thrusts in his torch first, and his head after, which he speedily withdrawing very passionately cryeth out: That his master hath murthered himselfe with his pistoll, and lies there dead all gored in his bloud. Montagne at this lamentable newes teares his haires weepes and cryes out a maine for sorrow thereof and so doe all his Servants: Among whom Le Valley is obserued to be one of the most, who weepes, and cries mightly thereat. Montagne being almost as dead with griefe and sorrow hereat, as his Brother Beaumarays was with his wound, He bids the Laquey to teare downe the casement and to enter and unlocke the doore, which he doth: So he with Le Valley and the rest of the servants ascend and enter the chamber, where to their unexpressable griefe and sorrow) they see this mournfull and murthered personage, with the discharged pistoll fast in his hand, and the key of the chamberdoore on the table, as hath beene already expressed. Once Montagne thought that his brother might be robbed and killd by theeves, but seeing all his trunkes fast locked, and then opening his study dore, and finding all his gold, silver, and Iewels there in good order, he abandons that suspition and Iealousie and then both he and they all beleive, that he hath absolutely murthered himselfe. The report of this tragicall and sorrowfull accident sounds loud in the streets of Chartres: Montagne sends for the Kings Attourny, and the Fiscall to see, and for Chirurgions to visit his dead brothers body, they all concurre and agree in opinion with Montagne and his servants, and so generally affirme and conclude: That Beaumarays hath (with his little pistoll) shot himselfe into the backe with a brace of bullets, whereof hee dyed, which is sweet musick and melody to Le Valley , but his wormewood and gall comes after. And now Montagne withall requisite order, state, and decency, solemnizeth his brothers funerals, and not onely all Chartres , but all Beausse , and all Gentlmen who knew him, yea the bishop of Chartres , the Marquis of Bellay , and the King himselfe much lamented and bewayled the unfortunate losse of this noble, and valiant Gentleman. The griefe and sorrow of Montagne for his Brothers untimely death, is the joy and felicity of Le Valley and Blancheville , for as he triumphes, so for her part she is so extreamly delighted and ravished with this sweet newes, as at their next meeting (which is the very next night) she gives him his hundred  & fifty crownes, and because he hath dispatched his master Beaumarays so speedily and secretly, she therefore takes a Diamond ring off her finger (worth one hundred crownes) and likewise gives it him: When to make good her oath and promise to him, (as also to make his pretented joy compleate) the very same day moneth after, marryeth him to her maid Martha . But marriages that are founded and cymented with innocent bloud, never have prosperous ends. Now is Blancheville proud in her revenge for the death of her mortall enemy Beaumarays , and now likewise is Le Valley (in his conceit and minde) rapt up into the third Heaven of joy, in injoying his faire and sweet wife Martha , and neither of them hath the conscience to thinke of, or the grace to repent this foule and bloudy fact of theirs: Which (when they least dreame thereof) wee shall see God in his sacred mercy in Iustice, will speedily detect, revenge, and punish, as the sequell thereof will declare and informe us. As the matter and manner of the detection of this lamentable murther of Beaumarays proceeded primarily from God, so it did secondly from his sorrowfull brother Montagne , who wanting all other witnesses  & evidence (and wholly guided by sacred power, and swaid by divine influence) was led to it by foure remarkeable circumstances and considerations, every way worthy of our Knowledge and retention. The first was his finding and perusing of Blanchevilles Letter to his brother Beaumarays (which formerly we have seene) wherein in he observed a wonderfull deale of inveterate malice towards him from her; The second was Le Valleyes suddaine marrying of her chambermaid Martha by the which he conceived that that suspition strongly reflected on her, and this on him: The third was from the sight of the Diamond Ring which Le Valley wore on his finger (being the same which wee have formerly seene Blancheville to give him) for Montagne beleeving that hee had stolen it from his dead brother his master, he challenged him for it by order of law, when Le Valley to cleere himselfe of this predended theft, was inforced to informe both him and the Iudges, that it was given him in marriage with his wife by the Lady Blancheville her Mistris, the which confession of his, indeed added much suspition and jealousie of them both to the heart and mind of Montagne , as beleeving that it must be some extraordinary tye and service which should make Le Valley capable to deserve so great a bounty and reward of her. But the fourth and last consideration was farre more powerfull and pervalent with him than all the three former to ground his suspition against Le Valley for thus murthering of his brother, and wherein the Reader may deservedly admire and wonder at the celestiall providence and justice of God, which most miraculously and divinely appeares herein, for the same day two monethes after the murther of Beaumarays , and the same day moneth that Le Valley marryed his wife Martha , It pleased the Lord (in his secret pleasure and justice) to send him a Gangreene in his right hand, which beginning to extend and spread, his Chyrurgeons to save his life, advised his said hand to bee speedily cut off, which was accordingly performed. This sodainely cutting of Le Valleyes right hand by advise of his Chyrurgeons brings terrour to him, feare to Blancheville , and astonishment and admiration to Montagne , who (led by the immediate spirit and finger of God) doth now confidently beleive, that it was that hand of his which pistolled his brother to death, and that might be rather probable than impossible, that Blancheville mought be the Author, and hee the actor of this cruell Murther. Wherefore grounding this his strong suspition upon the piety and innocency of his brothers life and disposition, as also on his owne fowre former premised serious considerations and circumstances, hee neither can nor will take any contrary Law or peace of his thoughts. But goes to the Seneshall , and Kings attourny of that Citty, and accuseth Le Valley to be the murtherer of his brother Beaumarais . The wise and prudent judges, advertised the presidiall court thereof likewise: So they presently cause him to bee apprehended and imprisoned for the same: They charge him with this cruell murther committed on the person of his master, but he stoutly denyes it with many fearefull oathes and imprecations: But his crime being greater then his Apologie, they adjudge him to the racke, where in the middest of his tortures, God so deales with his heart and prevailes with his soule, that he confesseth, it was he who murthered his master Beaumarais with a pistoll charged with a brace of bullets, and that hee was hired to performe it by the Lady Blancheville , who gave him three hundred crownes in gold, and a Diamond ring to effect and finish it. At the relation and confession whereof Montagne and the Iudges, exceedingly admire and wonder, and being by them againe demanded if his wife Martha were not likewise accessary with them in this murther, hee freely and constantly told them that shee was not, and that he would take it to his death, that she was every way as Innocent, as himselfe and Blancheville her mistris were guilty thereof. The Iudges of this Court speedily send sergeants away to apprehend Blancheville , who is so farre from the apprehension or feare of any danger, as shee dreames not thereof: They finde her in her owne house playing on her lute, and singing in company of many Gentlemen, and Gentlewoman her friends: The Serjeants seize on her, and tels her accusation and crime, whereat she is amazed and weepes exceedingly, and no lesse doe those who are with her: She is brought before her Iudges, who strongly accuse her for being the Anchor of this cruell murther of Beaumarais , and acquaint her with Le Valleyes full and free confession thereof as we have formerly understood: When here sometime with teares, and then againe with passion and choller, she tels the Iudges, that Le Valley is a devill and a villaine, thus to accuse her falsely: That she never gave him a ring or three hundred crownes to doe it, and takes God to witnesse that shee is wholly innocent of that murther. But this poore and passionate Apologie of hers, will not passe current with her Lyncee-eyed Iudges, who cause her to be confronted with Le Valley , who stands firme to his former accusation against her, and yet her faith is so weake with God, and so strong with sathan as with many cryes and curses, she againe and againe cryes out and protesteth of her Innocency: They produce her her ring, and part of gold, but she boldly denies and stoutly forsweares both; So they presently adjudge her to the racke, whereto with much constancy she permits herselfe to be fastened: But at the very first touch and wrench thereof, her dainety delicate limbs not able to brooke those exquisite torments, God was pleased to be so gratious  & mercifull to her soule, as she presently (with many teares) cries out that shee was the guilty Author of this horrible murther, and so in all points and circumstances concurres and agrees with Le Valleis deposition and accusation against her; Here her Iudges againe demand of her if her maid Martha were never accessary or consenting with her and Le Valley in this their bloudy act, but shee vowes to them, that upon perill of her soule, she was absolutely innocent thereof, so hereupon this our inhumane Lady Blancheville is againe loosed from her racke, and brought away to the Tribunall of Iustice, and so likewise is Le Valley , where Montagne and the Kings attourney presently crave judgement of the presidents against these two murtherers, who after a long and a religious speech which they made, both to them and to all who were present upon this bloudy fact and crime of theirs: They conclude and adjudge Le Valley the very next day to be broken on the wheele alive, and Blancheville then likewise to be hanged, which gave matter of Vniversall speech and admiration to all Chartres and Beausse . We have seene the perpetration and detection of this inhumane and lamentable murther, committed by these two unfortunate wretches Le Valley and Blancheville : And now (by the mercy and Iustice of God) we are come to see the triumphes of his revenge to fight against them in their condigne punishments for the same. They by their Iudges are that afternoone returned againe to their prisons, and the same night are there effectually dealt with by Divines, who (out of Christian charity) direct and prepare their soules for Heaven. So the next morning about ten of the clocke they are brought to the common place of execution in Chartres , where a world of people attend to be spectators of these their unfortunate ends and deplorable tragedies: And first Le Valley ascends the scaffold, who is sad and pensive, and saies little els in effect but this, that it was partly Blanchevilles gold, but chiefely his love to her maid, his wife Martha , who first drew him to murther his deere master Beaumarays , whereof he affirmed he was now heartely repentant and sorrowfull, and besought the Lord to pardon him; He here tooke it to his death that his said wife Martha was every way innocent of this murther, and therefore beseeched Monsieiur Montagne , to bee good and charitable to her after his death, whom he likewise prayed to forgive him, when uttering a few Ave Maries to himselfe, and often marking himselfe with the signe of the crosse: He was by his Executioner presently broken on the wheele, whereof he immediatly dyed. Le Valley was no sooner dispatched, but up comes our Female monster Blancheville on the Ladder, whose youth  & beauty drew pitty from the hearts, and teares from the eyes of most of her spectators: in her countenance shee was very sad and mournefull, aud yet I am enforced to confesse this truth of her, that (in this last Scene and act of her life) her pride and Vanity so farre usurped on her judgement, her piety, and her soule, that she came here to take her last leave of the world, apparelled in a rich blacke razed sattin gowne, a crimson damaske pettie coate, laid with white sattin guards, a rich cutworke falling band, her haire all strewed with sweet powder, decked with white ribban knots and roses, and a snow white paire of gloves on her handes, so she there craves leave of the people to speake a few words before she dyes, which with a well composed countenance, and behaviour, shee doth in these tearmes. She said that her deere and tender affection to her husband Champigny occasioned her deadly hatred and malice to Beaumarays , and that as soone as she had slayne him in the field, she in revenge thereof instantly resolved and vowed to send him to heaven after him: she affirmed that she was now sorrowfull from her heart and soule, that she had caused Le Valley to kill this his master, also that shee was so unfortunate and miserable, as now to see him dye for her sake and service, in requitall whereof shee gave all her apparell, and some of her plate and Iewels to her old maid, now his new wife Martha , whom she affirmed in presence of God and his angels, was no way guilty or consenting to this lamentable murther, which she beseeched the Lord to pardon and forgive her, she likewise besought Montagne and Martha to forgive her and entreated all who were present to pray to God for her Soule she conjured al Ladies and Gentlewoman who were sorrowful eyewitnesses of her untimely death, to beware by her unfortunate example, and so to hate malice and revenge in themselves as much as shee loved it: When againe praying all her spectators to pray to God for her, shee after a few pater-nosters, and Aue-maries was turned over. And thus was this lamentable, and yet deserved deaths of these two bloudy wretches Le Valley and Blancheville , and in this sharpe manner, did God justly revenge and punish this their horrible crime of murther: Whose untimely and unfortunate deathes, left much griefe to their living parents and friends, and generally to all who either saw or knew them. May wee reade this their History, first to the honour of God, and then to our owne Instruction and reformation: That the sight and remembrance of these their punishments may deterre us from the impiety and inhumanity of perpetrating the like bloudy crimes, Amen. GODS REVENGE, AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable sinne of Murther.  altogether unknowne) robbeth his (and her) sonne Thomaso , who likewise not knowing Lorenzo to be his father, doth accuse him for that robbery, for which he is hanged.  doe wilfully imbrue their hands in innocent bloud and so make themselves guilty of murther, are no longer men but have prodigiously metamorphosed themselves into the nature and quality of devils. And as after this their crime, they are worthy of all true christians detestation, so most commonly (without Gods saving grace and mercy) their hearts are so obdurated with impenitency of security, and their soules seared up and abandoned to all kinds of atheisticall prophannesse and impiety, that they are so far from thinking of God, as they beleeve there is no God, and so far from fearing of his judgements and punishments, as they are desperately confident they have not deserved any: But because their hearts and actions are as transparent to Gods eyes and knowledge, as Gods decrees, and resolution are invisible to theirs, therefore (despight this their blindnesse and the devils malice and subtilty to obscure and conceale it, this world will affoord them no true peace, nor this life produce them any perfect tranquility: But wheresoever they goe or live, their guilty thoughts and consciences as so many hellish bloudhounds will incessantly persue and follow them, till in the end they drag them to condigne shame, misery, and confusion for the same: which this subsequent history will verifie and make good to us, in a wretched and execrable personage, whom it mournefully presents to our view and consideration. Let us read it in the feare of God, that we may weigh that benefit by it which becomes good Christians to make. of Gods Judgements which hath prevailed with me to give this History a place among my others: The which to draw from the head-spring, and originall, we must understand, that in Italy , (the Garden of Europe, as Europe is that of the whole world) and in the City of Genova , (seated upon the Mediterranean Sea, which the Italians for the sumptuousnesse and statelinesse of her buildings, doe justly stile and entitle, proud Geneva ) neare unto the Arsenall upon the Key, there dwelt (of late yeares) a proper tall young man, of a coale blacke haire, some twenty five years old, named Andrea Lorenzo , who by his trade was a Baker, and was now become Master of his profession, and kept forth his Oven and shop for himselfe; wherein he was so industrious and provident, that in a short time he became one of the prime Bakers of that City, and wrought to many Ships and Galleyes of this Estate and Seigniory: He in few yeares grew rich, was proffered many wives, of the daughters of many wealthy Bakers, and other Artificers of Genova , but he was still covetous, and so addicted to the world, as he could fancy none, nor as yet be resolved or perswaded to seeke any maid or widdow in marriage, sith hee knew it to be one of the greatest and most important actions of our life, and which infallibly drawes with it, either our chiefest earthly felicity or misery. But as marriages are made in heaven, before consummated on earth; So Lorenzo going on a time to the City of Savona , which (both by Sea and Land) is some twenty little miles from Genova , and heretofore was a free City and Estate of it selfe, but now swallowed up in the power and opulencie of that of Genova , he there fell in love with a rich Vintners daughter, her father named Iuan Baptista Moron , and shee Firmia Moron , who was a lovely and beautifull young maiden, of some eighteene yeares of age, being tall and slender, of a pale complection, and a bright yellow haire, but exceedingly vertuous and religious, and endowed with many sweet qualities and perfections; who althouhh she were sought in marriage by divers rich young men, of very good families of that City, with the worst of whom (either for estate or extraction) Lorenzo might no way compare, yet shee could fancie none but him, and hee above all the men of the world she (secretly in her heart and minde) desired might be her Husband. Lorenzo (with order and discretion) seeks Fermia in mariage of her father Moron , who is too strong of purse, and to high of humour to match his daughter to a Baker, or to any other of a mechanicall profession, and so gives him a flat and peremptory deniall. But Lorenzo finds his daughter more courteous and kinde to his desires, for she being as deeply enamoured of his personage, as he was of her beauty and vertues, after a journey or two which he had made to her at at Savona , she consents and yeelds to him to be his wife, conditionally that hee can obtaine her fathers good will thereunto, but not otherwise; which Lorenzo yet feared and doubted would prove a difficult taske for him to compasse, and procure; for her father knowing Fermia to be his owne and onely childe and daughter, and that her beautie and vertuous education, together with the consideration of his owne wealth and estate, made her every way capable of a farre better husband than Lorenzo: As also that his daughter in reason and religion, and by the lawes of heaven and earth, was bound to yeeld him all duty and obedience (because of him she had formerly received both life and being) therefore he was resolute that Lorenzo should not have his daughter to wife, neither would he ever hearken to accept, or consent to take him for his sonne in Law. Lorenzo having thus obtained the heart and purchased the affection of his sweet and deare Fermia , he now (out of his servent desire and zeale to see her made his wife, and himselfe her husband) makes it both his ambition and care (according to her order) to draw her father Moron to consent thereunto, wherein the more importunate, humble, and dutifull he (both by himselfe  & friends) is to Moron , the more imperious, averse, and obstinate is he to Lorenzo , as disdaining any farther to heare of this his suit and motion for his daughter. But Lorenzo loves the daughter too tenderly and dearly thus to be put off with the first repulse and deniall of her father, and so (notwithstanding) hee againe persevereth in his suit towards him, with equall humility and resolution: Hee requesteth his consent to their affections with prayers, and his daughter Fermia (having formerly acquainted her father with her deare and inviolable love to Lorenzo ) she now prayes him thereto with teares: But (as one who had wholly wedded himselfe to the singularity of his owne resolution and pleasure) he againe proudly refuseth him with disdaine, and peremptorily rejecteth her with choller and indignation, and so secretly vowes to himselfe, and publikely sweares to them, that he will first die, and salute his grave, before ever he will permit him to marry his daughter. Which unkinde answer, and thundering resolution of his, proves the extreame greife of his daughter Fermia , and infinite affliction and sorrow of her lover Lorenzo , who hereupon are enforced to beare up with the time, yea, and to make a vertue of necessity, by separating their bodies, but not their hearts and affections. So hee returnes to Genova , and she lives and remaines with her father in Savona , having no other comfort left them in their absence but hope, nor no other consolation, but sometimes to visit each other with their Letters, which they doe. Old Moron now finds his young daughter Fermia , farre more pensive, reserved, and sorrowfull than heretofore, and therefore although he grieve to see her affection intangled with this Baker Lorenzo , yet he rejoyceth to see that he [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) comes to Savona , as also to understand that his daughter hath no way ingaged her selfe to him in promise of marriage, but with the condition of his free will and consent thereto, which as heretofore, so now againe, hee deeply sweares he will never be drawne or perswaded to grant. And the sooner and better eternally and fully to dash these their irregular loves and affections, he thinks it fit for him to provide, and requisite to present his daughter with another Husband: To which end he gives her the choice of two or three proper young men, and of very good families in Savona , but shee will have none of them, for her affection is so deeply fixed, and constantly setled on Lorenzo , that say her father what he will, or doe hee or they what they can, hee can hardly draw her to see, much lesse to speake with any one of them: Whereat he cals her foolish Gigglet, and fond Girle, and sweares that he will wholly renounce her for his daughter, and absolutely disinherit her, and leave her a begger, if she marrie Lorenzo , and then and there flies from her in rage and choller, and leaves her alone to her selfe, to entertaine her disconsolate and sorrowfull thoughts, with a world of sighs and teares. As for the Letters which passe from Genova to Sevona , and that are also returned from Savona to Genova , betweene these our two lovers Lorenzo and Fermia , deeming them impertinent to this their History, I have therefore purposely excluded, and for order and brevities sake omitted them: The which entertained their time, and tooke up their affections and patience, so long, that three yeares are now past and blowne over, since they first saw each other, and since Lorenzo first motioned Moron for his consent to marry his daughter, during all which long tract of time, which to those our two young lovers seemed at least so many ages. The Reader is prayed to understand and take notice, that Lorenzo hath made five or six journeyes from Genova to Savona to see his Fermia , and hath importunately requested her father Moron for his consent, and that at least as many times shee likewise hath imployed all her Parents and friends towards him, yea, and hath beene more often on her bended knees to him to begge it, but all these their requests and sotions towards him prove vaine. When Lorenzo at last considering and remembring, that he had used all the lawfull meanes he could possibly invent, and Fermia all her best endevours and inventions which lay in her mortall power to draw her father Moron to their desires and wishes of mariage, and that neither they nor all the world could prevaile with him, he thinkes it now high time (as well for the setling of his fortunes and trade, as also for the confirmation of his hearts content) to lay close siege to his Fermia , that (notwithstanding her fathers refusall) she would consent and yeeld to marry him, and so very secretly by night to leave him and Savona , and to come live and die with himselfe in Genova , telling her, that although he had never a Duckaton of marriage money with her from her father, yet that God had given him estate and meanes enough to maintaine her and his family, in full and plentifull prosperity, and that hee would bee a thousand times more tender and carefull of her than of his owne life. Thus with a world of sweet words and sugred promises, and perswasions, this sweet and faire young maiden (contrary to her former wholesome, vertuous, and obedient resolutions) is at last drawne and tempted away by him, now to prove disobedient to her father, yea, and to forsake and flie away both from his house and himselfe. So Lorenzo having to that end secretly provided himselfe of a fine small Frigot, of foure oares in each side, hee therewith comes by night into the key of Savona , (which the policie of the Genouesses (now their Lords and Superiours) have dammed up, and made uncapable of ships of burthen, that thereby all the trade and commerce by Sea, may arrive to their owne capitall City) where giving notice to Fermia of his being there, shee (taking her best cloathes, and other chiefest necessaries with her) in the dead time of the night, when her father and his servants were fast in sleepe, and all things being hushed up in silence, seemed to conspire to her rash and inconsiderate escape, shee by the Garden doore issueth forth to Lorenzo , who there received her with much joy, and many kisses, and so conducts her to the Frigat, where the wind (in favour of this their clandestine flight) proving very faire, they hoise up saile, and early the next morning arrive at Genova , where (within two houres after) Lorenzo conducts her to S  t . Saviours Church, and there very secretly (yet solemnly espouseth and marries her. But O Fermia , how I pitie thy youth and beauty, thine innocencie and indiscretion, thy few yeares and many vertues, thy affection and misfortune, and thine ignorance and credulity, so rashly and disobediently to flie from Savona to Genova , and to take (or rather to steale) away thy selfe from thy father, purposely to give thy selfe in marriage to Lorenzo , for which indiscreet and disobedient fact of thine, it is not impossible for thee to see this ensuing position verified and confirmed in thy selfe, That there is nothing so easie in young people as to commit errours, nor so difficult as to repaire them . Whiles thus our young maried couple celebrate their nuptials in Genova with delight and joy, old Moron the father grieves and stormes thereat in Savona , for the sudden flight of his daughter: When fearing and beleeving that Lorenzo had stollen her away, he secretly makes enquiry thereof at his house of Genova , from whence he hath perfect notice, that she is there, and maried to him, whereat he passionately converts his griefe into choller, both against her and him, and (in regard of this their disgrace and dishonour offered him) most constantly vowes to himselfe, and to all who are neere him, that they shall never touch nor enjoy the vallew of one Duckaton of all his Estate and wealth, as long as he or they live, and that he will not once send after thm, nor ever hereafter see them, which sharp vow and bitter sentence against our Lorenzo and Fermia , we shall be enforced to see him too carefully to keepe, and too severely and punctually to performe. Some ten dayes after this mariage of Lorenzo and Fermia , when their wedding joyes and pleasures had given them some truce and time to consider of their worldly affaires, because they know  & repute it folly, to thinke to be able wholly to live by love, Lorenzo considering the injury  & disgrace which he had offered his father in law Moron in this action, and therefore very desirous yet now againe to seeke his consent and good will to this their mariage, that thereby he may participate and share of some part of his wealth, he determineth shortly to ride over to Savona to him, and with his best respects and duty to comply and labour with him for a reconciliation; and yet neverthelesse he thinks it very fit, and hold it most expedient, that his wife in the meane time should first excuse her selfe to her father by her Letter, the which she doth in these termes:  make me more worthy of your indignation than of your pardon, yet when you shall please to remember that you are my father, and my selfe your only childe and daughter, and that God and his holy Church hath of Lorenzo my friend, now made him my Husband, and also that for the tearme of three whole yeares, I with teares and prayers came many times prostrate to you on my bended knees to obtaine your consent thereunto, then I hope you will at least excuse, if not wholly forget and pardon this errour of mine: Or if these reasons bee not enough powerfull to interceed with your displeasure, I most humbly beseech you further to consider, that herein I have neither blemished nor disgraced your reputation with any point of dishonour, for as I came to my Husbands bed a pure Virgin, so I will live and die with him a chaste wife; and that as this clandestine flight and mariage of mine was the first, so it shall be the last act of my disobedience towards you. Some small portion of your wealth at our first beginning, will doe my Husband and selfe a great deale of good in our trade, but this I leave, as to your consideration, so to your pleasure. Onely in all humility and duty (as low as the earth, and lower if I could) I desire your blessing to me, and implore your prayers to God for me, the which in religion you cannot, and in nature I hope you will not deny me. My Husband will shortly second this Letter of mine to you with his presence, and will then commit that taske to his tongue, which I have now obediently imposed and commanded to my pen: And my prayers and hopes, and his promises and vertues doe assure me, that (in his respects and service to you) you shall ever finde him to be as much your servant as your sonne in law. God ever prosper your age with health, and blesse your health with prosperity. Firmia.  Moron received this Letter in Savona , and understanding by the messenger who brought it, that it came from his daughter Fermia from Genova , he was at first in such a fret and fume of choller thereat, as hee once thought to have throwne it into the fire, without vouchsafing to read it: But after hee had made three or foure turnes in his Parlour, and so somewhat abated the violence of his passion and choller, hee then procures so much time from his pleasure, and so much patience from himselfe, as he breaks up the seales thereof, and peruseth it, the which as soone as he had performed, he in presence of the messenger who brought it, teares her Letter in peeces, and then (all enraged with choller) throwes it into the fire, when againe turning himselfe to him, he bade him tell the Gigglet his daughter, That her carriage had beene so base, disobedient, and ingratefull to him, that he disdained to returne any answer to her Letter, and was very sorry that he had so much descended from himselfe as to have received and read it: When without once enquiring of him how his daughter did, yea, without giving the messenger any reward, or which is lesse, without making him drinke, he hastily and chollerickly flings from him, and will no more see or speake with him. Who returning to Genova , and reporting to Lorenzo and his wife what cold entertainment his Letter and himselfe had of her father Moron in Savona ; she grieves and stormes thereat publikely, and he privately, and at their first relation and knowledge of this her fathers unkindnesse in answering her Letter with silence, they looke each on other with their countenances composed partly of discontent, and partly of sorrow, and for her part shee cannot refraine from teares, till at last her Husband Lorenzo steps to her, when (as much to dissipate her griefe, as to dissemble his owne) he gives her many smiles, and comforts her with these speeches; That according to her promise (in her Letter) to her father, he will the next weeke goe over to him, and will then beare himselfe so respectively towards him, that he hopes his presence shall purchase his affection, which her Letter could not, so she hereat remaines better satisfied than her Husband contented with this harsh carriage, and unkinde resolution of their father towards them. Now some eight dayes after Lorenzo rides over to Savona , (handsomely clad, and rather above than below his quality) and putting up his horse in an Inne, hee a little before supper time, goes to his father in law Morons house, where enquiring of his servants for him, they tell him he is above in his chamber, when desirous to see and speake with him, one of them steps up to him and enformes him thereof: Whereat Moron starting up as if he had beene suddenly awaked out of a dreame, he at the first mention and name of Lorenzo , but especially of that of his sonne in law Lorenzo , bolts himselfe fast in his chamber, and then calling up his servants to him, hee flatly chargeth them to deny his being within to Lorenzo , and as soone as he is gone forth, to shut the doores against him, and at any hand not to admit him into his house, for that his pleasure and resolution is neither to see nor speake with him. Lorenzo bites the lip at this baffle of his servants, first to say their Master his father in Law was within, and then in one breath to contradict and deny it. When for that time he holds it discretion to depart, goes to his Hostary (or Inne) to Supper, and returnes thither againe speedily after, but findes the same answer. So then fearing the truth, that his father Law was (infallibly) within, and yet would not be within, he returnes to his lodging, and in much choller betakes himselfe to his bed, but this discourtesie of his father in Law will not permit him any sound rest, but onely affords him many broken discontented slumbers. The next morning very early hee returnes thither againe to see and speake with him, but the first prove the last answer of his servants, whereat Lorenzo (all nelted with choller and anger) takes horse and rides away for Genova . Allow we him by this time returned to Genova , where hee truly and fully relates to his wife Fermia the discourtesie of her father towards him, from point to point as wee have formerly understood, which (poore sweet soule) exceedingly grieves her heart, and infinitely perplexeth her minde and thoughts, but how to remedie it shee knowes not, for as shee knowes shee (by her disobedient flight and mariage against her fathers consent) hath committed a great fault towards him, so now she sees that (of necessity) shee must owne and make the best of it: When he comforting his wife with encouragement, and she reciprocally encouraging him with comfort, they referre the issue of this their fathers pleasure or displeasure unto God; but yet rather hoping than despairing, that a little time will make him more tractable and flexible to their desires, they passe away their time merrily and sweetly together, he proving a courteous  & loving husband to her, and she a kinde and dutifull wife to him. He exceeding provident to get & thrive by his trade, and she as careful in her house and family to save what he gets, and thus in six moneths after they neither goe nor send to their father, thinking and hoping that although it be unlikely, yet it is not impossible but that hereafter of his owne free accord and good disposition and nature, he may shortly exchange his displeasure into courtesie, and his malice into affection towards them; but as yet they still finde the contrary, for in all this time, he never sends to them, nor so much as once hearkens after them. At the end of six moneths Lorenzo prayes his wife Fermia to ride over to Savona to see what alteration this long time hath wrought in her fathers affection, and so recommends her portion from him to her care  & remembrance, but resolves not to write to him because of his unkindnesse to him at his last being at Savona. Fermia (more in obedience to her husband, than out of her owne willingnesse or desire) accepts of this journey, but still she feares that shee shall finde her father to bee one and the same man in his discontent and displeasure against them. But yet in regard shee is his owne flesh and bloud, his onely childe, and therefore a great part of himselfe, she yet flatters her selfe with this hope, that he cannot be so unnaturall to her, as he was unkinde to her husband. She comes to Savona , but looke what entertainment her husband Lorenzo found from her father, the same in all respects and points doth she, and no otherwise: For he will neither speake with her, no nor see, nor permit her, either to lie, eat, or drinke in his house, but most uncourteously and unnaturally causeth his doores to be fast shut against her; yea, and to adde cruelty to his unkindnesse, he is extreame angry with his servants for daring to admit her to speake with him, and with her Aunt Alcyna , (his owne sister) for receiving and lodging her. Our sweet Fermia the daughter is extreamly perplexed, afflicted, and grieved at this her fathers bitter unkindnesse and cruelty towards her, the which she seales with many sighs, and confirmes with infinite Rivolets of teares, which trickle downe her beautifull cheeks as so many pearled drops of dew on blushing and fragrant damaske Roses: When againe imploying her aforesaid Aunt Alcyna , and likewise entreating father Bernardin De Monte , her fathers owne ghostly father, to perswade him in her behalfe, which they doe. But at last seeing the requests of the one bootlesse, and the spirituall exhortations of the other vaine and to no effect, then as she came from Genova to Savona with some hope and joy, so she is againe constraind to returne from Savona to Genova , with infinite griefe and dispaire; Where from point to point (betwixt anger and teares) shee relates to her husband Lorenzo , the unnaturall discourtesie, which her father had offered her: Whereat as before, so now he againe dissembleth his discontent thereof and with many sweet speeches, and some few kisses seekes to comfort and pacifie her: But still the remembrance hereof stickes deepe in her minde, and yet farre deeper in his thoughts, for the knowledge of his father in Law Morons discourtesie first offered to himselfe, and now to his wife in Savona , being knowne and reported to many of his neighbours and friends in Genova , they scoffe and taunt at his foolish ambition, in marrying and stealing away his wife, and in all companies which he frequenteth, they give him this quip, that hee had done farre wiser to have marryed a poore trades mans daughter in Genoua with a small portion, then a rich Vintners in Savona with nothing: which foolish and malitious speech of theirs, falles not so easily from his memorie as from their tongues, but leaves an impression therein, for from henceforth, Lorenzo of a wise man proves himselfe a foole, of an honest man a knave, and so of a good christian to God, an extreame bad husband both to his wife and himselfe: for now seeing the mountaines of his hopes of a rich wife turned to molehils, and they to nothing through his fathers displeasure and unkindnesse to them, hee lookes not on his wife with so kinde and respective an eye as heretofore, although poore harmelesse young woman, shee knowes farre better to lament and greive, then how to remedy her fathers cruelty towards them: But this is but the beginning of his ingratitude and her unfortunacy, for before a whole yeare be past since their marriage, her husband so farre forgets his love to his wife, his regard to himselfe and his reputation and credit to the world, as hee first beginnes to sleight her, and then to neglect both himselfe and his profession: And here now it is that idlenesse beginnes first to enter into his hands, vice into his heart, and sinne into his soule; and here it is that he first fals into bad courses, and wicked company from whence in the end (I feare) will proceed nothing but shame, repentance, misery, and confusion of all sides. Hee who formerly prayed often with his wife and family in his house and was a devout and religious frequenter of his Church, now he is so dangerously fled from God and so desperately following of the devil as hee scornes the Church, and will neither pray himselfe at home with his wife, nor (which is worse) permit or suffer her to doe it at home with her family: He hath forgotten her deere affection and constancy to him, and how shee hath incurred her fathers indignation for making him her husband and herselfe his wife: He hath forgotten his former oathes and promises of his tender affecti- and constant love to her, and how that in life and death hee would live and dye more hers then his owne: Hee hath forgotten how for his sake, and for the fervent love shee bore him, that she forsooke divers rich young men of Savona who were every way his Superiours in Birth, Wealth, and profession: Or els if he did remember it, hee would not thus sleight her by day, or lye from her by night in lewd and lascivious company, spending both his time, his meanes, and himselfe: upon panders, bauds, and strumpets, from which ungodly life, and sinfull conversation, neither her prayers, intreaties, requests, perswasions, sighes or teares can possibly reclaime him; but he lets all things runne at randome and confusion without order, care, or consideration, so that within the compasse of one yeare and a halfe, his trade is neglected, his credit crackt, his reputation lost, his estate spent, and nothing left either to maintaine himselfe or releive her, but griefe, sorrow, dispaire and misery. Shee sets all his best friends, and most vertuous acquaintance to convert him from this his abhominable life, yea she holds it more shame, then sinne to acquaint his confessor therewith, who taking a fit time, deales roundly with him for his reformation, and failes not to paint out his sinnes and vices, as also their deserved punishments in their foulest and most hideous colours: But still her husband Lorenzo is so strongly linked to the devill, and so firmely wedded to his beastly vices and enormities that all the world cannot divert, or disswade him from them, and still he is so farre from abandoning and forsaking them, as he adds new to his old: for the devill hath now taught him to delight in cursing and swearing, for in his speeches and actions he useth many feareful oathes and desperate execrations: He beginnes to revile her, and to give her foule language, tearming her Beggar, and her father villaine, and that hee is bound to curse them both, because (saith he) they have beggerd him: When God and his sinnefull soule and conscience well knowes that there is nothing more untrue or false: For if his piety toward God, or his care and providence of himselfe and his family had equallized hers, he had than made himselfe as happy as now he is miserable; and she as joyfull, as now we see her disconsolate and sorrowfull; and then no doubt but time and God would have drawne her father Moron to have bestowed some portion on him with his wife, whereas now the knowledge of his impious life and lascivious prodigalities doth justly occasion him to the contrary. Againe here befalls another accident which brings our sorrowfull Fermia new griefe, vexation and teares, for shee sees herselfe great, yea quicke with childe by her Husband Lorenzo so as that which shee once hoped would have beene the argument of her joy, now proves the cause of her affliction and sorrow, for his vices hath scarce left her wherewith to maintaine herselfe, and therefore it grieves her to thinke and consider, how hereafter she shall be able to mainetain her childe, when God in his appointed time shall send it her, for he hath so consumed his estate, and spent, sold, and pawned all their best houshold stuffe and apparell, that almost they have nothing left to give themselves maintenance, hardly bread: But yet still how lewd and irregular soever Lorenzo be, his vertuous and sorrowfull wife Fermia serves God duely and truely, and spends a great part of her time in prayer, still beseeching the Lord to give her patience, and to forgive her husband all his foule sinnes, towards him, and cruell ingratitude towards herselfe: When in the middest of this her poverty and misery, once she thought to have left her husband in Genova , and to have cast herselfe at her fathers feet in Savona , that he would pardon, receive and entertaine her: But then againe considering his flinty heart and cruelty towards her, and that he would rather contemne then pitty her youth and misery, but especially calling to minde her duty to her husband, and her Oath given him in marriage, in presence of God and his Church for better for worse, for richer for poorer: Then I say the consideration and remembrance thereof, is so strong a tye to her conscience and so strict an obligation to her soule, that she thinkes his vices and poverty hath now more need of her assistance, prayers and company then of her absence, so as a vertuous wife and a religious christian, she will not consent to forsake and leave him, but resolves to stay and live with him, to see what the Lord is pleased to impose on her, and (for his sinnes and hers) what afflictions and miseries hee hath ordained and decreed for them: And yet being desirous to draw hope and comfort any way, because she findes griefe and dispaire from all parts, she resolves to acquaint her father with her calamities, as also (earnestly and humbly) to pray him to releive them, the which she doth in this her sorrowfull letter to him, which she sends him safely to Savona .  disobedience in marrying Lorenzo against your consent and without your blessing, is the reason why God hath thus punished me with a bad husband in him: whose fervent affection to me is so soone forgotten and frozen, and whose Vertues in himselfe are so sodainely and sinfully exchanged into vices, that his prodigalitie hath spent and consumed all his estate, and left not wherewith either to give himselfe or mee mainteinance: In which regard because my afflictions are so great, and my miseries so infinite, that I rather deserve your pitty then your displeasure; Therefore if not for my sake who am your living Daughter, yet for my Mothers sake and remembrance, who is your dead wife, either give my Husband meanes to set up his old trade and forsake his new vices Genoua , or else take mee home to live with you againe in Savona : And if you will not in Nature respect me as your Daughter, yet in compassion entertaine mee as your Hand-maid, and I most humbly and religiously beseech you to thinke and consider with your selfe to what great wants and necessity I am now reduced, sith I write you this my letter rather with teares then incke: God direct your heart to my reliefe and consolation, as mine is eternally devoted to your service, and consecrated to his glory. Fermia.  Her father Moron after a long consultation and reluctation with himselfe, whether he should read or reject this letter of his Daughter. He at last (having formerly understood of her husbands prodigalitie, and her poverty and misery) breakes up the seales thereof and peruseth it, and surely if there had beene any sparke of humanity or reason, or of good nature or pitty in him at all, his former knowledge of her miseries, and now this present assurance and confirmation thereof, should have perswaded him to grant her, if not the first, yet the second of her requests, which was to receive her, and give her maintenance: but hee is still so hard hearted to her as he will neither releive her wants, nor pitty her afflictions, but (more out of hatred then affection to her) thinks he hath done enough in sending her not his love but this his sharp letter in answer of hers.  thy selfe, and to condemne thine owne temerity and disobedience in choosing him, and if his affection bee so soone forgotten or frozen to thee, it is a just punishment of God, because thine was so first to me, whereof as that is the effect, so doubtlesse this is the prime, and originall cause thereof, and as his vices and prodigality hath spent all his estate, so I have not so little judgement, (though thou so small understanding) to thinke that mine shall redeeme it, which (upon the whole) were then to immytate and second him in his folly, and consequently to make my selfe guilty in consuming it. And because thou fleddest with him without my knowledge from Savona to Genoua ; and didst there marry him without my consent, therefore it is neither thy Griefe nor Misery, or thy shame and repentance, which shall induce me either to respect or pitty thee as my daughter, or which is lesse, to releive and entertaine thee as my handmaid, you both are young enough to worke and labour for your living, as thy mother and my selfe did for ours, and therefore know that thy youth deserves no compassion from my age, and if this will not satisfie thee, then the best advise and counsell which I can or will give thee is, that thou continually direct thy prayers to God, for thy releife and consolation: And herein thou wilt then serve thy selfe, please mee, and glorifie him: And as thou regardest my Commands, or desirest my blessing, let me neither see thee, or hereafter heare any more of thy vaine and foolish Letters. Moron.  The receit of this her fathers unkinde and cruell letter to her, doth at one time kill both her hopes with dispaire, and her heart with griefe; or if that doe not, then the mad tyranny, and new cruelty of her deboshed husband doth: for now contrary to nature, beyond reason and opposite to Grace, he many times beates her; she is all in teares hereat, useth all possible meanes to reclaime him from his new vices to his old vertues: She continually perswades him fairely with exhortations, sweetly with sighes, and deerely with teares, yea poore sweet young woman, shee many times casts herselfe at his feet, and with her armes crossed, her hands elevated towards heaven, her haire dishevelled and dandling about her cheekes, and her pearled teares bedewing the lillies of her mournefull and disconsolate countenance, begs him to forsake his vices to himselfe, and his undeserved unkindnesse and cruelty towards her: But all this is in vaine, for hee proves death to her requests and prayers, and blinde to her sighes and teares. He hath no longer mony to buy corne, and is so farre from selling any bread to others, as he hath scarce enough to give to himselfe and to his great bellied wife, and as for his servants hee is inforced to put them all away: His vanity to himselfe and cruelty to his wife is too too lamentably notorious and remarkeable, for when he wants mony, he beats her, if she will not presently supply his wants, and furnish his expences. Now in the middest of all these her griefes and miseries, God sends her a faire young sonne, of whom the father is not worthy, no nor of his vertuous wife who bore it: For had not the care, affection, and charity of her neighbours beene farre greater then that of her husband to her, both the mother had miscarryed, and the childe perished in the sharpe throwes and agony of her delivery; and the name of this her little sonne, whom she causeth to be christened in a very poore manner and ceremony, is Thomaso : for she is so poore as she hath nothing but raggs to wrappe and cover him with, and therefore with much griefe and shame, she begges poore linnen clouts of her neighbours to keepe him cleane and sweet: When it is waking, she lookes and kisseth it often with joy, but when it sleepes or suckes, then shee grieves that it is so unfortunate both in a wicked father, and poore disconsolate mother, who hath more meanes to lament and pitty, then milke to feed and nourish it: Shee often shewes her husband his child, and importunately begges him hence forth to have a more provident care of himselfe for his childes sake, and of his childe for his owne sake: But hee as a lewd husband and too degenerate a father doth neither love nor care for either but hates both of them, yea his vices  & crueltie makes her sorrow so infinit, that she reputes herselfe a burthen to herselfe, & a thousand times wisheth she were in heaven; And one time among the rest after her husband without cause, had given her many bitter words and some sharpe and cruell blowes her childe being in its cradle, he gone forth from her in choller, she fals downe on her knees to prayer, the which so soone as shee had ended, and her childe awaking and crying, she takes it up in her armes, and mournfully sitting downe on the floore by her bed side, she (weeping as fast as her poore infant babe sucked) having bolted her chamber doore, was over-heard by one of her neighbours, (twixt whom and her selfe there was but a wainscot enterclose and partition) to pronounce these (or the like) sorrowfull speeches to her selfe. O poore Fermia , it had beene an infinite happinesse for thee if thou hadst never seene thy Husband Lorenzo , or perished and sunke in the Sea when thou fleddest with him from Sevona to Genova , before hee was thy Husband. For surely thou hast great cause to thinke, and reason to beleeve, that this cruelty of his towards thee, is a just plague and punishment sent thee from God, for disobeying thy father, in marrying without his consent and blessing; with whom when thou livedst single, thou hadst so much felicity and joy, as thou knewest not what belonged to sorrow and misery, and now living a wife to this thy Husband, thou art enforced to taste so much griefe and misery, as thou knowest no more what belongs to joy and felicity. Then thou didst surfet with the choice of the costliest meats and viands, and now thou art ready to starve meerly for want of bread: Then thy apparrell was rich, but now rent and torne: Then thy beauty made thee sought in mariage by divers, and now the griefes and sorrowes having defaced and withered it, thou art contemned and hated of him who maried thee. For can thy griefes be matched, or thy afflictions and sorrowes parralleld, when thou hast a Husband who neither feares nor serves God, who will neither goe to Church, or pray himselfe, or permit or suffer thee to doe it; and who is so farre from loving thee, as hee loves nothing better than to hate, revile, and beat thee: For (aye me) hee drownes himselfe and his wits in wine, and keeps whores to thy nose, spends all his estate upon them, and upon Bawds, Panders and Drunkards (the offscumme and Catterpillers of the world) with whom he consumes his time and himselfe, making night day, and day night in these his beastly revels, and obscene voluptuousnesse, and upon whom he hath spent so much, as hee now hath nothing left either to spend or maintaine himselfe and thee; yea, thy miseries are so great, and thy afflictions and sorrowes so sharpe and infinite, that thou hast no parent left to succour or releeve thee, and which is lesse, no friend who will assist or comfort thee. Poore young woman, and disconsolate sorrowfull wife that thou art, it were a blessed happinesse, and a happy blessing for thee that thou wert either unborne or unmarried. Alas, alas, thy mother died too soone for thee, when thou wert young, and therefore shee cannot, and thy father lives, (and is exceeding rich) yet hates thee so much as he will not assist  & releeve thee. And as all thy kinsfolks refuse to lend or send thee any comfort in these thy wants and calamities; so those who professed themselves thy friends in thy prosperity, will not now either see thee in thy poverty, or know thee in thy misery. When againe and againe looking on her pretty babe, and giving it many tender kisses, then (her teares interrupting her words, and her sighs againe cutting her teares in peeces) shee continueth her speech thus: And thou my sweet babe, what shall I say to thee, sith almost I can doe nothing for thee, for I have no food to give my selfe, how then can I give milke to thee; and yet I love thee so dearly and tenderly, that although thy unkinde and cruell father hate me so deadly, yet I will starve before thou shalt want, yea, I will cheerfully worke, and (if occasion serve) begge my selfe to death to get sustenance and necessaries for the preservation of thy life. For live thou my sweet babe as happy as thy poore mother is miserable and unfortunate: And if I die before thee, (as I hope I shall not live long) say thou hadst a mother who loved thee a thousand times dearer than her own life, and who was rich in care and affection, though poore in estate and means to maintaine thee. And if I leave thee nothing behinde me, (because I have now nothing left me either to give or leave thee) yet I will give thee my blessing, and leave thee heire to these my most religious prayers; That God in his divinest favour and mercy will not power downe his wrath and punishments on thee, but thou mayest live to be as happy in thy vertues, as I feare thy father will be miserable in his vices; and as true a servant and instrument of Gods glory, as (with griefe and teares) I see he is of his owne disgrace and dishonour. Neither is our vertuous Fermia deceived in the cloze of this her passionate and presaging speech towards her husband, for he continues his odious and ungodly course of life both towards God and her, and now (as well in his fresh as his drunken humours) makes it his practice to revile, and his delight and glory to beat her; who notwithstanding yet thinking and hoping to worke some good in him, through his sight of this poore infant his sonne. Shee often shewes it to him, and with sighs and teares prayes him to leave off this his sinfull life towards God, and these his cruell courses and actions towards her selfe. But he is still the same man, yea, he is so wretchedly debauched and vitious, as he will not endure to thinke of making himselfe better, and to say the truth, I beleeve and thinke that the devill cannot possibly make him worse; the wich his poore sorrowfull wife perceiving, as also that her childe being now by this time almost two yeares old, shee hath not wherewithall in the world to maintaine it meat or cloaths, she is enforced to make a vertue of necessity, and so works exceeding hard with her needle, thereby to give life to her selfe, and her pretty young sonne; and yet say she what she will with sighs, and doe she what she can with teares, her husband still forcibly takes away the two parts of the poore profit, and small revenewe of her labours, both from her selfe, and her little sonne Thomaso , not caring if they starve or die, so hee have to maintaine his vitious expences among his lewd Consorts and Companions; yea, her miseries and wants are now so great, and her affection to her childe so deare and tender, that when shee hath no meanes to set her selfe to worke, nor can procure any from others, then (though to her matchlesse griefe and shame) shee descends so farre from her selfe, as shamefully and secretly in remote streets and Churches, she begs the almes and charity of some well disposed people for their subsistence and maintenance: But at length, when she sees that her husband is informed and acquainted therewith, and that he is so inhumane in himselfe, and so cruell hearted to her and her sonne, that he likewise takes these small moneyes away from her, (which in effect is to take bread out of their mouths, and life out of their bodies) then not knowing what (in the world) to doe, or which way to winde or turne her selfe any longer, to maintaine her son, which (by many degrees) she loves better than her selfe, she resolves to write to her father to take him home to him at Savona , and maintaine him, which she doth by this her ensuing Letter, which carried him this humble language and petition:  which are now growne so extreame and infinite, that I have nor cloaths nor food left to maintaine my selfe, or my poore little sonne Thomaso , nor scarce to give life to us: And considering that I am your daughter, (yea your onely childe) me thinks both in Nature and Christianity, that my father should not see me driven to these sharp and bitter extremities, without releeving me, especially, because as heretofore, so now my sighs begge it of you with humility for charities sake, and my teares with sorrow for Gods sake. Or if yet your heart will not dissolve into pity, or relent into compassion towards me, at least let it towards my poore and pretty young childe, whom now with prayers and teares I beseech you to take from me and maintaine, though not as a great part of me, yet as a little peece of your selfe, and whom God (in his sacred power and secret providence) may (for his honour and glory) reserve to be as much happinesse to you, as I your sorrwfull daughter, and his poore mother see my selfe borne to affliction and misery: God will requite this your charity to him, and thereby I shall the sooner forget your unnaturall unkindnesse and cruelty towards my selfe. And so may you live in as much prosperity, as I feare I shall shortly die in extreame indigence and misery. Fermia.  Her father Moron receiveth and peruseth this third Letter of his daughter Fermia , whereat being yet nothing moved in charity, or touched in compassion towards her, but onely towards her young sonne (and his grand childe) Thomaso , he returnes her this short answer.  thy Letters, wherein I beleeve thou takest more glory, than either I conceive griefe at the relation of thy wants, or sorrow at the repetition of thy miseries, the which I am so farre from releeving, as I onely pitie it that I am thy father, but not as thou art my daughter. And yet because thy young sonne Thomaso is as innocent as thou art guilty of my displeasure and indignation, therefore give him to this bearer, whom I have purposely sent to receive him of thee, and I will see whether it be the pleasure of God that I shall be as happy in him as I am unfortunate in thy selfe, and if in his sacred providence he hath ordained and decreed that he prove as great a comfort to thy age, as thou art a crosse and calamity to mine, which if it prove so, then give God the onely praise and glory, which is the best use and requitall which thou canst make, or I desire. Moron.  Our poore and desolate Fermia having received and over-read her fathers letter, although she be wonderfull sorrowfull at the perseverance of his cruelty towards her selfe, yet she is infinitely glad and joyfull at his compassion and kindnesse towards her young son, who apparelling the very best that possibly she could, which God knowes is ragged, meane, and poore) she (with a thousand sighs, teares, prayers, blessings, and kisses) gives him to her fathers messenger, and to whose affection and education, as also to Gods gracious protection and preservation, shee religiously recommends him; when (to her exceeding griefe and sensible affliction) she sees it out of her possible power once to perswade her husband Lorenzo either to kisse or see him at his departure, as if it were no part of his affection to blesse it, or of his duty to pray to God to blesse it, much lesse to kisse it at parting. A most unkinde and unnaturall part of a father to his sweet and pretty young sonne. Which strange and discourteous ingratitude of his, it is not impossible for us to see God as strangely both to requite and revenge. Sorrowfull Fermia having thus sent away her little sonne Thomaso to her father Moron at Savona , she the very same night dreames in her poore bed and house in Genova , that she shall never be so happy to see him againe; when being awaked, and remembring this her sorrowfull dreame, she for meere griefe bitterly weeps thereat, and although she would, yet she cannot possibly forget or suppresse the remembrance thereof, or once put it out of her minde; so that thinking her selfe fortunate in placing this her little sonne with her father, and his Grandfather, shee is now very pensive and sorrowfull for his absence, because she can no longer see him, play with him, and kisse him, and is infinitely disconsolate and mournfull when she thinks of her dreame of him. In the meane time her lewd husband growes from bad to worse, so that her cohabitation is but a bondage with him, and her mariage and wedlocke but an Indenture of slavery, and a contract of misery under him. Such is her incomparable griefe, such her unparalleld afflictions and calamities. Five yeares our disconsolate Fermia lives in this rich misery, and miserable poverty with her husband, and yet all the whole world cannot perswade her father Moron to take her home to him and maintaine her. She hath no consolation left her but prayers, nor remedy but enforced patience; so shee armes her selfe with the last, and adorneth her selfe with the first. She was contented to begge for the maintenance of her little sonne Thomaso , but now being eased of that burthen, she will give it over, so she works hard to get her hard and poore living, which yet she cannot get so fast as her husband spends it prodigally and lasciviously. Her care and vertues make her the pitie, as his lewdnesse and vices make him the scorne and contempt of all their neighbours. So whiles she sits at home close at her needle in poore apparell, he idlely wanders and gads abroad untill he have brought his apparell to ragges, and himselfe almost to nakednesse. And here it is that her wretched husband Lorenzo now first beginnes to hearken to the devill, yea, to prove a very devill himselfe towards this his deare and vertuous wife; for he enters into a consultation with himselfe, that if he were once rid of his wife Fermia , he might marry some other with a good portion to maintaine him, and so againe set up his trade of baking which now had forsaken him, because he had vitiously and unthriftily forsaken it. When his faith being as weake with God, as his infamous life and vices were odious to the world, he assumes a bloudy and damnable resolution to murther her, and hereunto the Devill is still at his elbow to provoke and egge him onward, and continually blowes the coales to this his malice and indignation against her: So neither his minde or heart, his conscience or soule can divert him from this fearfull enterprize, and lamentable and bloudy businesse: The which to performe and perpetrate, he on a great holiday (which was the purification of the blessed Virgin Mary ) takes her with him into a Vineyard some halfe a mile from the City of Genova , under colour to recreate themselves, and to take the aire, which God knowes she poore soule takes for a great, because an unaccustomed favour and courtesie at his hands, where she most lovingly and willingly goes with him, and there feigning himselfe fast asleep, and she (innocent harmlesse young woman) then  & there slept soundly, and every way being as devoid of feare as he was of grace, he with a barbarous and diabolicall cruelty, (seeing the coast cleare) softly riseth up and cuts her throat, without giving her the power, time or happinesse to utter one word before her death: Where leaving her weltring and goring in her bloud, he speedily and politikely enters Genova by a contrary gate, thereby to avoid all suspition of this his bloudy and damnable fact. The very same night this her breathlesse murthered body is found out by some of Genova , who accidentally walked that way; and they causing it to be brought to the City, it is knowne by some of Lorenzo's neighbours to bee his wife Fermia , whereat to adde the better cloke to his knavery, and shadow to his villany, he seemes to be wonderfully sad, and passionately sorrowfull for the same, and so requesteth the Criminall officers both in and about the City, to make curious research and enquiry for the murtherers of his wife, which they doe; but this hypocriticall sadnesse and false sorrow of his, though (to the eye of the world) it prevaile for a time, yet (to that of Gods mercy and justice) in the end it shall little availe him; so he gives her a poore and obscure buriall, every way unworthy the sweetnesse of her beauties, and the excellencie of her vertues. Her father Moron hath speedy notice of this deplorable death of his daughter, who considering how she had cast away her selfe upon so bad a Husband as Lorenzo , though outwardly hee seeme to bewaile and lament it, yet inwardly he much cares not for it; and for her little sonne Thamaso , his few yeares dispenceth with his capacity from understanding, much lesse from lamenting and mourning for this disastrous end of his mother. A moneth after the cruell murther and buriall of this vertuous, yet unfortunate young woman Fermia , her bloudy and execrable husband Lorenzo (is yet so devoid of feare and grace) as he goes to Savona to request his father in law Moron to give him some maintenance, in regard he had no portion from him with his wife his daughter, as also to see his sonne Thomaso . But Moron by his servants sends him a peremptory refusall to both these his requests, and so will neither see him, nor suffer him to see his sonne, but absolutely for ever forbids him his house: Whereat Lorenzo all in choller leaves Savona and returnes to Genova , where selling away his wives old cloaths to provide him new, he seeks many maidens and widdowes in mariage, but the fame of his bad life and infamous carriage and deportment with his late wife is so fresh and great, that they all disdaine him; so that utterly despairing ever to raise himselfe and his fortunes by mariage, he forsakes and leaves Genova , inrols himselfe a Bandetti, and for many yeares together practiseth that theevish profession, to the which we will leave him, and speake a little of his young and little sonne Thomaso . Old Moron traines up this his Grand-child Thomaso very vertuously and industriously, and at the age of fourteene yeares bids him chuse and embrace any trade he best liketh: When Thomaso exceedingly delighting in limming, graving, and imagery, he becomes a Goldsmith, and in foure or five yeares after is become a singular, expert, and skilfull workman in his trade: His Grandfather loves him dearly and tenderly, and intends to make him his heire; but Thomaso (led as I thinke by the immediate hand and providence of God, or out of his owne naturall disposition and inclination) being of a gadding humour to travell abroad, and see other Cities and Countreyes, and having a particular itching desire to see Rome , (which he understood is one of the very prime and chiefe places of the world for rich and curious Goldsmiths.) Hee finding a french ship of Marseilles (which by contrary winds stopt in the Road of Savona bound up for Civita Vechia , very secretly packes up his trunke and trinkets and so goes along in that ship: Now as soone as his Grandfather Moron understands hereof, he very much grieves at this his rash and sodaine departure: So Thomaso arrives at Civita Vechia , goes up to Hostia by sea, and thence on the River Tiber to Rome , where hee becomes a singular ingenious Gold-Smith, and thrives so well, as after a few yeares) he there keepes shop for himselfe and constantly builds up his residence. In all this long tract and progression of time, which (my true information tels me) is at least twenty foure yeares, his father Lorenzo continues a theevish Bandetti in the state of Genova and Luca , where hee commits so many Lewd robberies, and strange rapines, depr aedations and thefts, as that country at last becomes too hot for him, and he too obnoxious for it so he leaves it and travelleth into Thoscany , and to the faire  & famous Citty of Florence which is the Metropolis therof, where with the moneys he had gotten by the revenewes of his robberies he againe sets up his old trade of a Baker; in which profession he knew himselfe expert and excellent, and here hee setleth himselfe to live and dwell, takes a faire commodious house, and lookes out hard for some rich old maiden or young widdow to make his new wife: But God will prevent his thoughts and frustrate his designes and desires herein : For as yet his bloudy thoughts have not made their peace with his soule, nor his soule with his all seeing and righteous God for the cruell murthering of his old wife Fermia which as an impetuous storme and fierce tempest will sodainely befall him when hee least dreams or thinkes hereof, yea by a manner so strange, and an accident so miraculous that former ages have seldome if ever paralleld, or givenus a precedent hereof, and wherein the power and providence, the mercy and Iustice of God resplends with infinite lustre and admiration, and therefore in my poore judgment and opinion) I deeme it most worthy of our observation as we are men, and of our remembrance as we are christians. Charles now Cardinall of Medicis going up to Rome to receive his hat of this present Pope Vrban VIII . and Cosmos the great duke of Florence his Brother, (in honour to him and their illustrious bloud and family whereof they are now chiefe (resolving to make his entry and aboade in that Citty of Rome to be stately and magnificent: Hee causeth his house and traine in all points to be composed of double officers and Servants to whom he gives rich and costly liveryes, and among others, our Lorenzo is found out, elected and pricked downe to be one of his Bakers for his owne trencher in that Iourney, where in Rome he flaunts it out most gallantly and bravely in rich apparell, and is still most deboshed and prodigall in his expenses before any other of the Cardinals meniall Seruants, without ever any more thinking or dreaming of the murthering of his wife Fermia but rather absolutely beleives, that as he, so God had wholly buryed the remembrance of that bloudy fact of his in perpetuall silence and oblivion: But the devill will deceive his hopes: For now that Lamentable murther of his, cryes aloud to Heaven and to God for vengeance: Wherein we shall behold and see, that it is the providence and pleasure of God many times to punish one sinne in and by another, yea and sometimes one sin for another as reserving it in the secret will and inscrutable providence, to punish Capitall offenders, whereof murtherers are infallibly the greatest, both when, where, and how he pleaseth, for earthly and sinfull eyes, have neither the power to pry into his heavenly decrees, nor our minde and capacity to dive into his divine actions and resolutions, because many times hee accelerateth or delayeth their punishments, as they shall stand most fit and requisite for his Iustice and their crimes. When therefore the Panders and strumpets, and the new pride and bravery of our Lorenzo had eaten out all his mony and credit in Rome , and that (to his griefe) he now saw that by no possible meanes he could procure or borrow any more there being infinitely unwilling to let his vice and prodigalitie strike saile, and so as hee vainely and foolishly thinkes to disgrace his Lord Cardinals service instead of honouring it: Hee once was minded, and resolved to steale some gold out of the Argentiers or pay masters truncke; But then consulting with his Iudgement and discretion, and finding that attempt to bee full of danger, ingratitude, and infamy: He buries that resolution as soone as it was borne, and then gives conception and life to another, which was to steale some peices of plate out of a young Goldsmithes shoppe there in Rome with whome hee was familiarly acquainted, and whose shoppe and company, hee with divers others of his fellowes) very often haunted and frequented since his comming to Rome ; The which, watching and taking his time he doth, and from him takes away two faire rich guilt Chalices, and a curious small gold crucifix set with a few Saphires and Emeralds, all mounting to the valew of foure hundred and fifty Dukatons. This young Goldsmith (whose name we shall anon know) is amazed at this great losse, when being guided and directed by the immediate finger of God, he knowes not whom to suspect or accuse for this robbery but Lorenzo the Cardinall of Florence his Baker: whom hee saw, and observed did very often and too familiarly frequent his shop, and farre the more doth he fortifie and increase this his suspition of him, because then making a curious enquiry and research of his former life and actions, he found both the one and the other in all points so vitious and deboshed, as we have formerly understood, onely the murther of his wife Fermia excepted, which as yet none but God and himselfe knew: Whereupon well knowing that hee lay not in his Lord Cardinals palace, which as all others are priviledged as sanctuaries, but in a Taylors house neere adjoyning: Hee with an officer searched his chamber and trunke wherein he found one of his Chalices, but not the other, or the gold crucifix, which Lorenzo immediately had sold both to pay his debts, and to put some double pistols in his pockets for his vaine and prodigall expences; When hunting after this his theife Lorenzo he presently finds him, commits him to prison, and accuseth him to the Captaine and Iudges of Rome : Who upon knowledge and sight of one of the chalices found in Lorenzoes trunke, and also upon his confession of having soldaway the other, and likewise the crucifix of Gold, they condemne him to bee hanged the very next day for the same, Lorenzo bitteriy weeping and fuming at this his disaster) doth most humbly sue and petition the Lord Cardinall his Master to begge his life of the Pope, who considering him to bee a base Companion, and no Gentleman, and his fact (during this his service) to bee very foule and scandalous, Hee is too Noble and wise to attempt or undertake it, and therefore becomes deafe to his requests; Whereupon Lorenzo is that night returned to his prison, where he hath leasure though not time enough, to thinke upon his conscience and soule, upon the basenesse of this his robbery, and the foulenesse and bloudinesse of murdering his wife Fermia . The next morning hee is brought to his death, at the common place of execution at the Bridge foot, in a little walled court close to the castle of Saint Angelo , where a world of people flocke from all parts of Rome to see the Cardinall of Florence his Baker take his last leave of the world, and being the night before prepared by a Fryar, in his soules journey towards heaven, as soone as hee ascended the Ladder, hee there confesseth this his robbery: And likewise that his name was Andrea Lorenzo , and that he (about some Twenty and three yeares since) murthered his owne wife named Fermia Moron in a vineyard neere Genova , whereof hee saith hee will no longer charge his soule: The which the young Gold-Smith (whose name was Thomaso Lorenzo over hearing) hee presently bursts forth into teares, and very passionately and sorrowfully cryes out, that this man on the Ladder is his owne Father; and that Fermia Moron was his owne Mother, and therefore hee with a world of sobbes, sighes, and teares prayeth the Officers, and then the Executioner of Iustice to forbeare, and leave the prisoner for a small whiles, which accordingly they doe: When at the descent of his Father from the Ladder: Thomaso (in presence of all that huge number of people who were present) throwes himselfe at his feet, and seeming to drowne himselfe in his teares for sorrow, confesseth himselfe to bee his Sonne, and acknowledgeth Fermia Moron to bee his mother, and therefore prayes him to forgive him this his innocent ingratitude towards him, in seeking his death of whom hee had received his owne life: And although the consideration of his mothers lamentable Murther doth pierce him to the heart with griefe, yet knowing him likewise to bee his Father, and himselfe his Sonne, hee freely and willingly offers the Captaine of Rome , and the Iudges all his Estate to save his Fathers life, but this his robbere is so foule, and that former murther of his so inhumane and lamentable, yea so odious to God and the world, and so execrable to men and Angells that none will presume or dare to speake in his behalfe: So the next day Lorenzo is hanged, having first freely forgiven his Sonne Thomaso , and entreated him likewise to forgive him for murthering of his mother, and for any other thing else, hee at his death said little: But cursed the name and memory of that miserable and covetous wretch his Father in Law Moron , whose unkindenesse and cruelty hee said had occasioned and brought him to all this misery. But he spake not a word of his griefe or sorrow for having murthered his wife Fermia Moron ; Onely he said and beleeved that this his untimely death was a just revenge and punishment of God to him for the same. The common sort of the Spectators and people of Rome , seemed to taxe the Cardinall of Florence his Master for not saving this his Bakers life: but the wiser and more religious sort, applauded his generosity and piety for not attempting it from the Pope: But all doe admire and wonder at Gods sacred providence and divine Iustice in making the Sonne the cause and instrument of his fathers hanging for murthering of his mother, the which indeed gave cause of speech and matter of wonder to Rome, Genova, Savona , and Florence , yea to all Italy : And thus was the wicked life and deserved death of this bloudy Villaine Lorenzo , and in this manner did the Iustice of the Lord triumph ore his crime in his punishment. And as for his Sonne Thomaso (the Goldsmith) after this infamous and scandalous death of his Father, hee could no longer content himselfe to live in Rome , but returned to Savona to his Grandfather Moron , who received him with many demonstrations of Ioy, and affection, and after his death made him sole heire to all his wealth and Estate.  To God be all the Glory.  FINIS.

Right Honovrable, Nobleman, Arthur , Lord Chichester , Baron of Belfast (whose sublime merits doe here justly deserve and challenge this Testimonie from my Duety, That hee was too good for Earth, and therefore is now so soone crowned a Saint in Heaven) I then had first the happinesse to know, and to be knowne of your Honour at your Cheswicke; In whom (because J ever hold it a farre lesse crime to speake the truth, then either to silence or dissemble it) J then found so many prints and stamps of true honour, and Characters of ancient Goodnesse and Nobilitie, that (with a pleasing content and delectation) I was enforced to be againe and againe enamoured of Vertue and Honour for your sake, and reciprocally, to love and respect your Lordship for both their sakes. Since when (out of your generositie, not my expectation or deserts) your Honour was pleased to conferre a favour on me, the which though you forget, yet the remembrance thereof I will (with equall Zeale, and Ambition) strive to make as eternall, as I know my selfe to be mortall and transitorie. You are a Religious Christian , and a true hearted Englishman; and therefore as it is your glory, so it is our happinesse, that you are both a constant Lover of God and his Church, and a firme and faithfull honourer of your Prince and Countrey; and you are now Lord Lieutenant (under our Royall and Gracious Soveraigne) of that famous County of Devon , and faire, and honourable Citie of Excester , to which J owe my nativitie; and in both which the Russels (Earles of Bedford ) your Noble Ancestors have condignely left behind them many honourable Trophees of their Valour , and sweet and precious perfumes of their Vertue . These premises being so powerfull in truth, and so considerable and prevalent in Reason, I therefore flatter my selfe with this hope, that your Honour will attribute it rather to Dutie, then Presumption in me, If J now publikely attempt to profer and sacrifice up something to the Honour of your Illustrious Name , and to the Dignity of your resplendent Vertues : Missing therefore of that desired happinesse (by some rare, or elaborate peece) sufficiently to testifie to your Lordship and to the whole world, what you are to mee in the height of Honour , and what J am, and desire to bee found of you in the lownesse of Observance and Humilitie , Jt will therefore bee no lesse my Felicitie, then your Goodnesse, Jf you vouchsafe to accept and patronize this my Fift Booke of foraigne Tragicall Histories , and also please to permit them to travell and seeke their Fortunes abroad in the world, under the auspitious Planet, and authenticall Passeport of your Noble Protection, wherein you may behold and see, how soundly, how sacredly the Justice of God meets with this crying and scarlet Sinne of Murther , which (in these our depraved, and sinfull times) in contempt of the Lawes of Heaven and Earth , make so lamentable and so prodigious a progression; and how sharpely and severely it (deservedly) punisheth (those Butchers, and Monsters of Nature) the perpetrators thereof; And if I may borrow (for I desire not to usurpe) any part of your Lordships houres of leisure to give first to the Knowledge, and then to the Contemplation of these Histories, and the severall Accidents which they report and relate, J shall then triumph in my good fortune, as having obtayned that Honour and Favour , which J ingenuously acknowledge, I am farre more capable to desire then deserve. I come now to implore pardon of your Honour for this my Presumption, in inscribing and adventuring so meane a worke to your noble acceptance. And I have ended this my Epistle, as soone as began, to assure you, That J will ever (religiously) pray unto God to accumulate all prosperities and blessings on your Honour ; as also on your most Vertuous Countesse , and successively on your Honourable and Flourishing Posteritie, who now promise no lesse then a happy and famous perpetuitie to your thrice Noble Name, and Family.

Not but that Christianitie (as a faire and glorious vayle) covereth the face of Europe , as the firmament of Heaven doth that of Earth; and that (by the mercie of God) there are now great variety of learned and godly Preachers, who (by the sanctity of their lives, and the purity of their Doctrine) spend the greatest part both of their time, and of themselves to propagate Vertue, and Pietie in us, and consequently to roote out vice and Sinne from among us; But it is the vanity of our thoughts, the corruption of our depraved Natures, the infirmity of our Iudgements, the weakenesse of our Faith, the coldnesse of our Zeale, and our neglect of prayer, which sometimes (O that I might not say too too often) transporteth our selves, beyond our selves, and our resolutions and actions beyond the bounds of reason, yea and violently carrieth us to desperate and inhumane attempts, which this next deplorable History will so apparantly and perspicuously verifie vnto us, that we shall difficultly reade it without sighes, nor understand it without teares, at least if wee have but the sparkes of so much Charitie in our hearts, and Pietie in our Soules as the unfortunate authors, and miserable actors hereof wanted. capital Citie thereof) must needs be that of Tuscany ; or else it could not so justly and generally deserve that true and excellent Epithite of faire. It is a Citie which hath given both life and being to the Illustrious family of the Medicis , (or as some affirme, they to it.) The worst grounds about it are Vineyardes, and the best are dainty Meadowes, and delicate Gardens, or rather their Gardens are Meadowes for their spaciousnesse, and their Meadowes are Gardens for their fertility  & beauty. It is divided and crossed in two parts by the famous River Arno , and that river againe by two stately Bridges curiously embelished and adorned with many Marble and Alabaster Statues. The streetes hereof are well paved, broad and long; the buildings (for the most part) rather Palaces then private houses, and the Temples for sumptuousnesse and beauty, nothing inferiour to the best, and richest of Italy , especially the two most sumptuous and unparalleld Chappels of the Babtistaria , and Saint Lorenzo , as also the Dimo , and Campanella (which is the Tower) thereof, it being a most magnificent and stately Cathedrall Church, which not onely catcheth our eye with wonder, but surpriseth our thoughts with admiration, as all our English Noblemen and Gentlemen Travellers, doe (peradventure) know farre better then my selfe; I say in this rich and fayre Citie of Florence , neere the Church of the Dominican Fryers, in the latter dayes of the great Duke Ferdinand , there dwelt an ancient, vertuous, and generous Cavallier, named Seignior Leonardo Streni , descended of a Noble family, neere to the Citie of Pistoia , where his Auncestors left him many fayre demeanes, and a very rich Patrimony, the which (through his Frugality, Vertue and Wisedome, the true foundation of most of the chiefest houses, and best familyes of Italy ) hee managed and improved so well, that within the space of twenty yeares he became exceeding rich and oppulent; but neere about this time, that the sweetnesse of his content, might receive some checke of bitter affliction, to shew him that man is subject to God, and that there is no perfect or permanent felicity heere on Earth, his Lady Alcydina dyed, which brought him much sorrow and affliction, having onely yet this joy and consolation left him, that he had by her in marriage, three proper young Ladyes to his Daughters, named, Iaquinta, Babtistyna and Amarantha , who albeit, he hoped would prove the stayes and comforts of his Age, yet they will futurely afoord him, farre lesse felicity, and more misery then he can expect, or my Readers (as yet) any way conceive or imagine, the which, to approve and verifie, they are by me prayed to understand, and remember, that these two youngest Daughters, Babtistyna , and Amarantha , are wonderfull fayre and beautifull, of a reasonable tall stature, very streight and slender; But Iaquinta , the eldest Daughter is of a browne complexion, short, and Crooke-backd, but shee hath this sleight, that her Taylors art serves to overvayle the defects, and to cover the deficiencie of her Nature; and she her selfe hath the skill to put on fresh tincture and complexion on her face, vices which the puritie and simplicity of former Ages were not acquainted with, or else purposely disdained and hated, although the pride and vanity of these our times doe ambitiously allow and practise them. Againe, Iaquinta is proud and stately, Babtistyna chollericke, sullen, and revengefull, and Amarantha (to the eye and judgement of the world) pleasant and courteous. Have we but a little patience, and we shall shortly see each of these three Sisters, appeare in their true coulers, and in very different wayes to act their severall partes upon the Stage and Theater of this their History. Streni seeing himselfe a widdower, not so much favoured of God to have any Sonne to enjoy his name and Landes, and all his three Daughters to be now capable of marriage; He (as a provident and loving Father) holds it a great poynt of affection and discretion in him now to leave his Mannor house of Cardura neere Pistoia , and to betake himselfe to live and reside in Florence , hoping thereby with lesse difficulty, and farre more advantage, to looke out and provide fit Husbands for his daughters, answerable to their ranke and degree; which disposition and resolution of his pleased them well, and administred them cause of great content and joy, siith it is now growne to a custome, and a habit, that young Ladyes and Gentlewomen doe infinitely desire to live in great Townes and Cities, where they may see, and be seene, and especially in those of Italy , more then in any Country of the World, where the whole Nobilitie and Gentrie make all their aboad and residence, the which indeed is one of the maine poynts, and essentiall reasons, why their Cities are so rich, populous, and fayre. Thus we see Streni and his three Daughters by this time come to Florence , and dwel (as I have formerly said) neere the Monastery of the Dominican Fryers, where his wealth, birth, and port, cause him to be visited and frequented of the best and noblest sort of that Citie, and as the time of his residence, so the number of his acquaintance encreaseth, for vertue is capable to purchase friends every where, and his wealth and Daughters beauties like so many powerfull Lures and Adamants draw many young gallant Gentleman to his house to see and serve them; Where although Babtistyna and Amarantha , are beloved and sought in marriage of many, yet their Father is resolute to marry their eldest Sister Iaquinta first, wherefore when any noblemen or Gentlemen come to his house, she is to be seene, and courted, but Babtistyna and Amarantha are mewed and fast locked up in a Chamber. They grieve hereat, but they can neither alter nor remedy this their Fathers resolution, for his word must bee their Oracle, and his will their Law. Now before I proceed farther in the dilation of this History, as I one way commend Streni his resolution to marry his eldest daughter first, so yet in approving his discretion for her preferment, I must neverthelesse taxe his want of affection, in hindring that of his two youngest daughters; For as it was a courtesie of him to have Iaquinta seene of Suters, so it was a degree of dis-respect, I may say, of cruelty in him to confine Babtistyna and Amarantha as prisoners to their Chambers, when divers of them came purposely and honorably to his house, both to see and seeke them in marriage. But Iaquinta (armed with her fathers love and authority) growes extremely imperious and stately; She triumpheth in conceit to see her selfe preferred of her father before her Sisters. Shee sees her two sisters Babtistyna and Amarantha are sued and sought for in marriage by divers Cavalliers, and the very consideration hereof grieves, and the remembrance afflicts her, but withall shee observes, that they dare not disobey, or contradict their fathers command, to affect or speake with any, and therefore the very knowledge and remembrance hereof, againe rejoyceth her. As it is a happinesse for us to purchase friends, so it is a misery to lose them. Her Sisters love her, but she loves not them, they are as unworthy of her hatred, as she is of their affection. Nature (indeed) hath given her the prerogative, and priviledge, but yet she should consider, that they are her Sisters, and not her Servants, and that their bloud is hers, and hers theirs. It is an argument both of indiscretion and insolencie, for one Brother or Sister to thinke themselves better then another; But many Gentlewomen, who are Sisters, esteeme pride a second beauty, or at least an excellent Grace and Ornament to them, and therefore to preferre and elevate themselves, they care not how they disparage and deiect others. The beauty of Babtistyna and Amarantha is an eye-sore to Iaquinta . The tree of malice never produceth good fruit. It is still a happy vertue for us to checke and vanquish our owne vices. She knowes that many Gentlemen love them, but sees and observes with griefe, that none affect her. Her desire to marry is so immodestly licentious and boundlesse, as she could willingly resolve to accept of any Gentleman for her husband, that would be content to take her for his wife: but Incontinencie prooves still a pernicious counsellor to young Ladies and Gentlewomen. Now, as Cantharides flie still to the fayrest flowers; so shee sees (and indeede infinitely bites the lip, and grieves to see) that all Lovers and Sutors flie to one of these her two Sisters, and wholly abandon and forsake her selfe: but being a woman, she wants not an invention to apply a present remedy to this her discontent and choller. Shee must have her Sisters beauties and braveries eclipsed, that hers may appeare more bright, and resplend and shine with more lustre and glory: She knowes that Christall seemes precious when Diamonds are not in place; to which end, shee very passionately, and yet subtilly workes upon the affections of her Father, and obtaines of him, that as her yeares, so her apparell may excell and exceede that of her Sisters, the which hee inconsiderately grants her; and this shee receives and conceives to bee a step to her advancement, and an obstacle to theirs. So if they formerly grieved to see themselves imprisoned in a chamber, whiles shee to her content and pleasure rejoyceth both to see, and bee seene of Gentlemen: So now their discontent thereof growes into choller, and their choller into rage, to see this their elder sister Iaquinta not onely to step some degrees beyond them, but likewise many beyond her selfe in her apparell. It is ever a wise and discreet vertue in Parents to distribute their favours and affections equally to their Children or if they chance to affect one better then others, at least that they bee so reserved and cautious, as to conceale it secretly to themselves, that the rest may neither perceive nor know it. That Streni sought to many Iaquinta before Babtistyna and Amarantha (as I formerly have sayd) he did well, but yet to make them lose when they might find and gaine a fortune, was withall to be indiscreet, if not unnaturall. Mens fancies and affections in marriage are many times counselled and led by the eye, as the eye is by the heart. Some will prise and affect beauty without vertue, others vertue without beauty; but where both meete and concurre, it doth not onely please, but delight, and so joyntly sympathize to make each other excellent. Many of the best and noblest Cavalliers of Florence love Babtistyna and Amarantha , but not Iaquinta ; or if they seeme to court Iaquinta , it is but with a reserved hope and intent to injoy the sight and company of Babtistyna and Amarantha: but as Iealousy and Malice have alwayes foure eyes in stead of two; so it is at least a torment, if not many deaths, to Iaquinta , to see her two Sisters to live and be beloved of all Sutors, and her selfe of none; the which to prevent, and so to stop the progresse of their triumphs, and consequently of her owne discontent and affliction, she (not desirous to have two such starres of beauty to appeare and shine together in the firmament of her Fathers house in Florence ) doth so secretly undermine, and so cunningly prevail with him, as her two sisters (when they least dream or think thereof) are by his order and command suddenly sent away by Coach to his Countrey house of Cardura , neere Pistoia (whereof wee have already made mention) notwithstanding all their requests, sighes, and teares to the contrary, and there by his appoyntment to be privately and disconsolately shut up, from any accesse or conversation of any man whatsoever, and under the charge and custody of an old ill-favoured Beldame (sometimes their Schoolmistris) named Dona Malevola . Babtistyna and Amarantha , being enforced to banishment from Florence to Cardura beleeved that it proceeded as well by the pride and malice of their Sister Iaquinta as by the severitie of their Father; They know not from what Saint to implore aide or assistance, or from what point their Art, or Invention to expect for hope or redresse hereof; But at length (being constrained to make a Vertue of Necessitie) they brooke this their disgrace, with as much patience as they may, no way doubting (much lesse dispayring) but that a little time will worke a great alteration in their Estates and Fortunes; But seeing a moneth past over, and their Keeper Malevola , still more and more bent to restraine them of their liberty, without suffering them to see or speake with any stranger, or any stranger with them, they at last recollect, and plucke up their spirits to themselves, and so resolve to write a faire Letter to their Father, and a peremptory one to their Sister Iaquinta , to procure their returne to Florence , which they doe, and send it by one Bernardo a trusty Servant of theirs, That to their Father spake thus.  sodainely banished us from your presence, and from Florence , to live here rather as Prisoners, then your Daughters, in your Countrey house of Cardura; And having the honour to be so great a part of your selfe, wee doe not a little wonder what our Errours or Crimes should be, that wee must bee enforced to be deprived of that felicitie, and to taste and suffer this misery. If we have beene sought or sued unto by any Noblemen or Gentlemen, it hath beene in the way of marriage, and therefore in that of honour, and yet we have still so strictly tyed our fancies to our Duties, and our affections to our obedience towards you, that in the least degree wee have not swerv'd from your consent, but have done, and doe still inviolably make your Pleasure therein our resolution, and your Will and Commands our Law. But wee are confident that although you are the cause, yet that our Sister Iaquinta is the sole Author of this our sorrowfull and immerited sequestration; Who (peradventure) in regard that her beautie comes short of ours, that her Malice therefore must not onely exceed the bounds of Reason, but of Nature. And although shee alledge her Priviledge and Prerogative of yeares against us, yet because our blood is as good as hers, and our Hearts and Education no worse, therefore wee humbly beseech you to bee so favourable, and kind to us, that in regard her Malice and Pride hath made her our Accuser, and which is worse our Enemy, that you will not make her our Iudge, but that wee may speedily reobtaine the happinesse to returne and live with you in Florence , without which we shall assuredly either live here in Dispaire, or shortly dye in Discontent and Misery: Which request of ours is so just and equall, as you cannot deny it to us either in affection or nature, much lesse in Reason or Pitie. God ever blesse you with happinesse, and make us happy in your blessing. Babtistyna. Amarantha.  Their Letter to their Sister Iaquinta depainted these passions.  least shaddow of cause, much lesse of Reason, why thou shouldst so sharpely exasperate our Father against us, so suddenly to banish and exile us from Florence to Cardura , neither doe wee thinke it is for that wee are fairer then thy selfe, but that thou art more malicious then us, which hath occasioned thee, and thou precipitated him to this sharpe resolution against us. If thou art desirous of a Husband, let it content thee, that as yet wee no way intend or desire to become Wives to any, and therefore if thou wilt not beleeve us, at least beleeve this truth from us, that thou hast farre more reason to doubt thine owne haste, then any way to suspect or feare ours therein, for whiles thou prayest for a Husband, wee will first make it our Prayers to God, that wee may bee capable and happy to deserve good ones. Wee advise thee therefore in Love, and counsell thee in Affection and Charitie, to consider seriously with thy selfe, that wee are thy Sisters, not thy Servants, much lesse thine Enemies; and in that regard that wee are as unworthy of thy malice, as unwilling and uncapable to digest it, because the priority of thy yeares can no way justly introduce an inequality in our blood; and if thou wilt not inforce us to degenerate from our selves, and consequently from the nature and affection of Sisters, thou shalt doe us great right, and to thy selfe more reason, to cause our Father to recall us home to him, with as much celerity and favour, as he sent us away from him with discourtesie and indignation. Baptistyna. Amarantha.  The Lackey Bernardo arriving to Florence , and having delivered these two Letters to Streni and Iaquinta , they breaking up the seales thereof, perused and read ouer their Contents; when he smiling to see the indiscretion of these his two daughters, attributed this their disobedience towards him, and their discontent towards their sister Iaquinta , rather to ignorance and simplicity, then to malice, and yet hee could not but wonder at this their bold and peremptory Letter sent him: But for Iaquinta , shee was so galled and nettled with her two sisters insolent carriage and Letter towards her, that it exceedingly troubled and perplexed her, but especially, and farre the more, for that shee feared that their Letter to her Father might cause him to grant their returne to Florence , the which to her possible power shee would no way willingly permit or suffer, as desirous to rule and governe her Father alone, and so to raigne sole Lady over his humors and house, without rivalls or competitors: to which end shee goes to him, and in the softest and sweetest termes which either her art, or malice could invent, she extreamely incenseth him against her Sisters, alledging to him that their stay in Cardura was necessary, and their disobedient motion for their returne to Florence too insolent and insupportable, and that she hoped with confidence, that he would not permit their malice so unjustly to fall and reflect on her, because she was as innocent as they guilty thereof; and that for any thought and desire of a husband she vowed she had none, but that his will and pleasure should in all things be hers, as resolving both to live under his commands, and to dye in his favour and service: Which sugred and treacherous speeches of hers so prevailed and vanquished the credulity of her old Father, yea and so powerfully wrought and trenched upon his affections, that being all in choller against Babtistyna and Amarantha , hee resolves with himselfe to returne them a sharpe answer, and commands Iaquinta to doe the like, the which they both write and send backe to them by Bernardo , who returning to Cardura , hee deliuereth his two young Ladies and Mistresses these two Letters, and they speedily and privatly retiring themselves to a close shaddowed arbour in the Garden, they there with much earnest desire and impatiencie, first breake up that of their Father, wherein contrary to their hopes, but not to their feares, they finde this language.  so rashly and peremptorily have attempted to crosse my good intentions and affection towards you, in sending you to Cardura , but would have brooked it with as much patience as I see you doe with discontent, and before this act of your disobedience, now reveal'd mee in your Letter, I held you for my Daughters, not for mine enemies, and my house of Cardura to be rather a Pallace then a Prison for you: So if you knew how ill those errours of yours become you, you would rather redeeme them with repentance and teares, then remember them either with the least thought of delight, or conceipt, or sense of joy. Nay thinke with your selves what modesty it was, what wisedome it is, for your greene youth to presume (or to dare presume) to teach my gray age how, or when, to chuse you husbands, when God knowes that neither your yeares, nor your discretion, doe as yet make you capable to thinke of husbands; and if you have any judgement remayning in you, then judge with your selves how false and incongruous your reasons art, when in words you pretend to obey my commands, and yet in effects you wilfully oppose and contradict them. And having used me with so small respect, see againe with how much untruth and envy you abuse your sister Iaquinta , who to my knowledge is as innocent of those false aspersions of pride and malice towards you, as your selves are guilty of them towards her, sith shee loves nothing more, and you affect nothing lesse then humility and charity, their contraries; for believe me I finde her to bee your true friend, and your selves to be the greatest and onely enemies to your selves; for otherwise you cannot live in the smallest degree of despaire, discontent, or misery, because such is my care of your education and maintenance, that no young Ladies of Tuscanie , and few of Italy , of your ranke and quality, are brought up in more bravery, delight, and honour, the which my indulgencie and affection shall still continue to you, if your disobedience and folly henceforth give mee no farther motive to the contrary: and therefore as you tender my blessing, I charge you to make it your delight and practice to thinke of God, not of Husbands; of your love to your sister Iaquinta , not of her hatred to you; and of your Prayer-bookes, your Lutes, and your Needles, and not of such vaine conceipts, and passions, wherewith you have stuff'd and farced up your Letter to mee; the which, together with the Coppie of this of mine to you, I now inclose and returne to your Governesse Malevola , that she hereafter may be more carefull of your conduction and carriage, and that you give more houres to discretion and honour, and lesse to idlenesse and vanity, to the end that she seeing her fault in yours, she may thereby the better futurely know how to teach, and you how to learne to reforme them. And so I beseech God who hath made you my Daughters, to blesse, and make you his faithfull servants. Streni.  They having thus perused their Fathers Letter, and seene his spleene and passions towards them, they cannot so much accuse him of choller, as they believe they have reason to condemne their sister Iaquinta of cruelty towards them; wherefore with more speed then affection, and with more haste then charity, they likewise breake up the seales of her Letter, wherein she greets them thus.  as I vow to God, and to you, that his sending of you from Florence to Cardura , was not onely without my consent, but without my knowledge; and for calling in question eyther the thought of your beauties, or of my husbands, you equally wrong me, and the truth therein; for it is that most whereof I trouble my heart and minde least: and therefore my haste to marry comes infinitely short of your jealousie and feare; and except it bee out of your pride and malice, of Sisters to become mine enemies herein, I know no cause in Nature, and lesse reason in Grace, why those false suggestions of yours should fall within the compasse of your conceipts, or those untrue scandalls within the power of your heart and pen, and it is as vaine as ridiculous either for your love or counsell ever to thinke to make mee believe or conceive the contrary. As for the priority of my yeares, it shall never make mee esteeme worse of you then of my selfe; for my conscience to God, and my actions to the world shall still make it apparent, that although you contemne my friendship, I will yet corroborate and cherish yours, and that there shall want no good will or Zeale in mee, that (according to your desires and expectation) our father doe not speedily recall you from Cardura to Florence , where your presences shall still bee my happinesse, and your company my content and felicity: And except your deportments and carriage towards me give mee not henceforth just cause to divert mee from this sisterly affection and resolution, I am constantly resolved both to live and dye in the same. Iaqvinta.  Babtistyna and Amarantha having thus read and considered these two severall Letters of their Father and Sister Iaquinta , they are infinitely incensed and chollericke to see his discourtesie, and her dissimulation and cruelty towards them, in that they must bee inforced to live a solitary countrey life in Cardura , whiles shee triumphs in pride, and flants it out in bravery in Florence ; and as they much repine and murmure at his dis- affection, so they infinitely disdaine and complaine of her imperious courses and carriage towards them, adding no beliefe to her Letter, but judging it to be hypocriticall. They pitty the weakenesse of their Fathers judgement, in suffering himselfe to bee so violently transported and carried away by the subtile policie and secret malice of their Sister towards them; wherein although their duety and obedience doe some way excuse his age, yet their blood and beauty can no way possibly dispense with the pride and malice of her youth, which they hourely see confirmed and made apparent in the unaccustomed strict and hard usage of their Governesse Malevola towards them, which with her best endeavours and ambition sought as well to captivate their mindes as their persons, by making her selfe to be as much their Goaler as their Governesse; but they vow to requite her unkindenesse, and to revenge their Sister Iaquinta's cruelty towards them: They see her deformity in their beauty, her malice in their love, and her pride in their humility; so they alter the course of their naturall affection, and now decline, in stead of increasing, in sisterly love and charity towards this their Sister. To goe retrograde in vertue, is to goe forwards in vice; for as it is the marke, so it is the duety of Christians to render good for evill, but not evill for good: yea, all contrary examples and Axiomes are ill taught, and worse practised, and it is to bee feared, that the end thereof will produce at least sorrow, if not misery and destruction. But Baptistyna and Amarantha are too young and wilfull to make good use of their Sister Iaquinta's bad affection, and malicious carriage towards them; for else, had they had as much wit as beauty, or as much affection as malice, they would then flie that which they follow, and detest this bloudy designe and resolution of theirs, which they now intend to imbrace and put in practice. They are weary of their Sisters hard usage of them, they cannot digest her imperiousnesse and pride, and (in all outward semblance and apparance) if they stay from marriage till she be married, they may all dye Mayds, and as our English adage goes, Whip Apes in hell for company . They preferre their beauty before hers, as much as shee doth her age before theirs, and deeming it impossible for them to have husband ere shee bee a wife, they thereupon abandon all reason and religion, and so at one time beginne both to desire and to plot her death; and of these two wretched Sisters Babtistyna is the most forwards in this their intended deplorable businesse; for she is so weake with God, and Sathan so strong with her, that she sayes often to her selfe, shee can reape no content in this world, before her Sister Iaquinta see another. It were better for us not to foresee a sinne, then seeing it, not to prevent, but perpetrate it. To which end, shee purposely lets fall some words to her Sister Amarantha , tending, and bending that way; but Amarantha is too curteous to be so cruell, and too religious to bee so outragious and diabolicall to any, especially to her Sister: had shee lived in the piety, and persevered in the integrity of this opinion and conscience, peradventure her dayes had seene better fortunes, and her end beene freed from so much misery. It is not enough for us to bee vertuous and godly, except wee religiously and faithfully continue therein; for constancie in all good and pious actions, makes men and women excellent, and of being wholly mortall, to become (in a manner) partly divine: But (to report truth in her naked colours) Amarantha is too weake to resist her Sister Babtistyna's strong temptations and perswasions. It is an excellent vertue and happinesse in us, to have our eares still open to good counsell, and shut to that which is evill and pernicious: but Amarantha hoping and desiring to gaine a good Husband, makes her in a small time consent to the losse of a bad Sister; and how shee is therefore fully resolved to joyne with Baptistyna , to make Iaquinta away. Good God, what cruelty, rage, and barbarisme is it for two Sisters to resolve to murther their third! But this is not all; for we shall see more bloud spilt upon the Theater of this History, before we see the Catastrophe thereof. These two unnaturall young Gentlewomen having thus swapt a bargaine with the Devill to dispatch their Sister Iaquinta , they now consult on the manner thereof, whether or no, they should performe it, with Ponyard, or Poyson; but at last they agree upon Poyson, but disagree which of them shall administer it to her, and if there were any sparke of grace remaining in either of these two bloudy minded Sisters, it was in Amarantha ; for she cannot finde in her heart or conscience to doe it, and yet she is so gracelesse and impious, as shee freely gives way to the performance of this bloudy fact; so in the end, they fall upon this ungodly resolution, that Lots must decide it: thus the Devill holds, and they as his infernall factors and agents, draw them, and it falls to Babtistyna to doe it. But here ere they proceede farther in the progresse of this lamentable businesse, and how to execute it, they are now assayld with a doubt and difficulty of no meane importance; for as they hold it requisite for them to performe this Murther in Florence , so they know not how to escape from their watchfull Governesse Malevola from Cardura: but they are Women, and therefore they will bee industrious in their malice; they are Ladies, and therefore they will bee swift and subtile in their revenge; for having gold (though not their liberty at their command) they resolve that the first shall speedily procure the second: To which end, they, by their servant Bernardo , secretly hire a Coach for foure Duckatons, the next night to carry them away very closely and privately from Cardura to Florence , and with so many more to corrupt the Gardiner to give him the Key of the Garden Posterne gate; both which (with much care, fidelity, and silence) hee effecteth, being himselfe onely by them appoynted to attend, and commanded to accompany them in this their journey. These two revengeful Sisters having thus given order for their escape, and secretly packed up such things as they held necessary to carry with them, as soon as their Governesse Malevola was in bed and fast asleepe, who was as innocent as they were guilty of this their clandestine departure, in comes Bernardo about midnight to their chamber doore, to which giving a soft knocke, they presently descend the stayres with him to the Garden, and from thence to the Coach, wherein seating themselves, they leave Cardura , and so with great speed drive away for Florence , where they arrive to their Fathers house, betwixt nine or ten of the clocke the next morning, hee much wondring, and their sister Iaquinta extreamely perplexed and grieved at this their suddaine and unexpected arrivall, they cast themselves at their Fathers feete, and crave his blessing and excuse, but hee receives them with more anger then joy, and so gives them frownes and checks in stead of Kisses: He heares their reasons of their unlook'd for departure from Cardura , which hee rejects both with contempt and choller, sharpely reproves their disobedience, and voweth speedily to returne them; they answer him, that his presence is the sole felicity and glory of their life, and that they had rather dye with him in Florence , then live without him in Cardura . As for their Sister Iaquinta , shee dissembles her love to them, as they doe their malice to her; for whiles shee secretly wisheth them out of Florence , so (in counterchange) do they as silently wish  & desire her in heaven: but after a day or two was past over, then their hypocrisie and dissimulation was such each to other, as (to the eye of the world) it seemed they could not be better friends, nor dearer or kinder Sisters, then now they were; so artificially could all of them overvaile their malice, and so cunningly could they conceale their different intentions, thereby the better to compose their countenances and speeches. But when Iaquinta againe perceives that the Gallants of Florence doe afresh repayre and flocke to her Fathers house, purposely to neglect her, and to admire and adore the excellent beauties of these her two younger Sisters, then her old jealousie revives, and inflame her new malice towards them; so as with all her power and art, shee againe secretly tampers with her Father, either to returne them againe to Cardura , or to contract and espouse them to a Nunnery, that shee might thereby triumph alone at her pleasure, and being then sole heire to all his lands and estate, might wed her self to the greater fortune, and nobler Husband, and she wanted neither sighes nor teares to draw him to this her earnest desire and resolution. This is not so secretly borne betwixt their Father and Sister Iaquinta , but Babtistyna and Amarantha have present and pregnant notice heereof, the which strongly and fully to prevent, they (now incouraged and animated by the Devill) resolve to reduce, and draw their bloudy contemplation into action, and so (with more hast then good speed) to dispatch their Sister for heaven, because they loved Florence , disdayned Cardura , and above all (from their hearts and soules) infinitely detested to spend and end their dayes in a Nunnery; when neither having the feare of God in their hearts, nor his justice or judgements before their eyes, Amarantha buies the poyson, and Babtistyna administreth it to their Sister Iaquinta , in a Lemmon posset, which they observed she often used to drinke the Summer time, so that some ten dayes after she dyed hereof, when none but God, besides them, was witnesse of this their unnaturall and bloudy businesse: So they rejoice as much as their father grieves and sorrowes hereat, and now they are alone, and domineere at their pleasures in their Fathers house at Florence , without rivalls on competitors: But God is as just as they are sinfull, and therefore they shall reape but poore and miserable fruits of this their bloudy victorie. For within lesse then sixe weeks after the deplorable death of Iaquinta , a sudden languishing sicknes oretakes and surpriseth Babtistyna , so as the white tincture of her face lookes yellow and the fresh roses and lillies of her beauty did exceedingly fade, and wither of the Iaundies: A sicknesse, which I thinke God sent her purposely to punish her for that execrable crime of hers in poysoning her Sister. But the beauty of Babtistyna cannot be so much eclipsed or deformed, as that of Amarantha daily growes more deliciously sweet, and sweetly delicious and amiable; so as all those Nobles and Gallants of Florence and Tuscanie , who come to seeke Streni his Daughters in marriage, doe infinitely preferre Amarantha before Babtistyna , and passionately desire the first, as much as they now sleight and neglect the second: Babtistyna is not ignorant hereof, but sees it with griefe, observes it with sorrow, and remembers it with choller and indignation; and yet she seekes and strives to conceale it from her Father, and to dissemble it to her Sister Amarantha . She in this wane of her beauty and joy, beginnes now to participate of her dead sister Iaquinta's living humours and conditions; she is now become the eldest Sister, and therefore will not permit or suffer her younger to bee her mate, or equall, much lesse her superiour; and although her Sicknesse hath depriv'd her of a great part of her beauty, yet it hath no way diminished, but rather increased and augmented her desire to marry, shee envies the sight and fame of her Sister Amarantha's beauty, as much as shee lamenteth the decayes, and pittyeth the ruines of her owne; and both grieves and scornes to see so many Gallants court and seeke her in marriage, and none her selfe: Now as pride and malice (for the most part) are inseparable companions, so her discontent hereof hath made her so devillishly malicious, as shee secretly vowes to her selfe, that shee could almost finde in her heart to make Amarantha as well a companion of Iaquinta's fortune, as of her bloud: but God then presenting her first Murther to her eyes and remembrance, the devil was not then enough prevalent or powerful with her, to draw her to conceive or commit a second. Thus not being willing to adde murther to murther, and so to gallop in stead of pacing to hell and destruction, she neverthelesse determinately resolves to emulate and imitate the actions of her dead Sister Iaquinta , towards her living one Amarantha ; and yet so to wreake her malice and revenge on her, as closely to insinuate, and under hand surreptiously to prevaile with her Father, that shee bee speedily eclipsed, and againe sent away to Cardura , under the guard and custody of Malevola , the which shee effectually and briefely obtayneth of him; so our young and faire Amarantha (though infinitely against her will) is now inforced to leave Florence , and suddainely (when shee least thought or dreamt thereof) is againe confined and banished to Cardura , notwithstanding all her sighes, teares, and prayers to her Father to the contrary. Amarantha (with much sorrow and more indignation) being arrived to Cardura , she is not a little perplexed and grieved therat, but rather exceedingly discontented with her Father, and infinitely incensed against her Sister Babtistyna for the same, as well knowing that it wholly proceeded from her meere pride and malice towards her; the which she now doth not conceale, but make apparant to her old Beldame Governesse Malevola , both in her lookes, speeches, and actions. She wondreth that her Sister is so inconsiderate of her selfe, and so imperious and bitter towards her; and how it is possible for her so soone to forget either their joynt crime, or their severall danger for their so inhumanely and cruelly poysoning their elder Sister Iaquinta ; the consideration and remembrance whereof is of so sharpe and bitter digestion to her, as her thoughts vow to her heart, and her heart sweares to the Devill, that she neither can nor will long indure it; yea, the time seemes so irkesome to her, and her stay in Cardura so infinitely long and tedious, as if houres were yeares, and dayes ages, that shee often thought to steale away from thence to Florence , either on foot or horse-backe, and so to have put her selfe into some disguised apparell, that none should know thereof before she came to her Fathers house and presence: but at last considering, that her reputation and fortune might suffer much in this action, she holds it not amisse, rather convenient, first to write to her Father and Sister, to see if her Letters may prevaile with them for her returne; the which she doth, and sends them to them to Florence , by her old trusty servant Bernardo . Her Letter to her Father bewrayed these passions:  (without cause or reason) you should thus againe banish me from Florence to Cardura ; and with how much griefe and sorrow I digest it, I can better relate with discontent, then conceale with patience: How deare your sight and presence was, and ever shall be to me, if you will not know, and withall remember, God doth; for my soule appeales unto him, and my heart to Heaven, that I made it the chiefest life of my joy, and the sweetest joy of my life; So as if you are not the cause, I am sure my Sister Babtistyna is of this (undeserved) cruelty towards me, who out of her pride, ambition, and malice, strives to bee as unnaturally imperious to mee, as my deceased Sister Iaquinta was both to her selfe and mee. The remedy hereof is every way worthy of you, as you are my Father, and of my selfe, as God and Nature have made mee your Daughter; for if you will not permit mee to respire and breath the ayre of Florence , I will shortly hazard my life to injoy that of heaven: for already this my inforced exile hath brought mee to extreame discontent, and that almost to utter despaire. Amarantha.  Her Letter to her Sister Babtistyna carryed this Message:  must needes constraine our Father to make mee live miserable here in Cardura ? Is our Sister Iaquinta's blood already colde, or is the memory as well as the manner and cause of her death already of thee forgotten, and so raked up in the dust of her Grave? Iudge with thy selfe (if thou art not wholly as devoyde of judgement, as of affection and charity) what a palpable, yea what a grosse and sottish vice it is in thee, heereby to make thy selfe both guilty of her pride, and Heire apparant to her malice. I remember those ingratefull crimes and vices of hers towards us with pitty, and I pitty these of thyselfe to mee with admiration, in that thou wilt not suffer mee to live at the curtesie of thy tongue, when thou well knowest that thy life stands at the mercie of mine; Not that I am eyther so malicious to thee, or so uncharitable or undiscreet to my selfe, to wish thee any disaster or danger to the prejudice of mine owne happinesse, and safety; for I desire all peace, affection, and atonement betwixt us: the which if thou wilt graunt mee, by causing our Father speedily to recall mee home to Florence , hee shall then see, and thou assuredly finde, that I will bee as much thy Handmayd as thy Sister, and that I will farre sooner both hope and pray for a good Husband for thee, then for my selfe: but if thou denye mee this curtesie, then blame not me, but thy selfe, if the event and issue of this thy cruelty come too short of thy hopes, and so (peradventure) flie a pitch farre beyond thy expectation. Amarantha.  Bernardo being thus charged by his Lady Amarantha , for the safe and speedy delivery of these her two Letters, as also to procure her Fathers and Sisters Answers to them, hee rides away to Florence , where hee is no sooner arrived at Streni his house, but meeting with the young Lady Babtistyna , and thinking to deliver her Letter (whether it were out of haste, or misfortune, or both) hee delivers her her Fathers Letter, in stead of her owne, the which shee well observing, shee hastily and purposely breakes up the seales thereof, and silently reades it to her selfe; whereat growing first red with choller, and then againe pale with envie, shee foldes it up, and committing it to her pocket, turnes to Bernardo , and demands him for her Sister Amarantha's Letter to her selfe; for (quoth shee) that which I have already read and perused, is hers to my Father; when Bernardo (as much amazed at his errour, as afflicted at his foolish simplicity) reading the direction of the second Letter, and finding her speeches and his mistaking true, hee then gives her her owne Letter, and desires backe the other for her Father, as also both their answers thereunto, for his Lady and Mistresse Amarantha ; whereunto, when shee had perused her owne Letter, shee (with disdaine in her lookes, and malice in her eyes) teares her Fathers Letter before Bernardo's face, and then returnes him this bitter answer; Tell that proud Girle thy Mistresse from me, that it is my Fathers pleasure and mine, that she shall stay in Cardura, and not see Florence, till she receive other order from us; and for any further answer, either from our Father, or my self, it is both a vanity and a folly for her to expect: And so (in much choller and indignation) shee flies from him, and violently throwes fast the doore against him. Bernardo , not expecting such sharp and cold entertainement, and seeing it now wholly impossible for him to have any accesse to Streni , or answer from Babtistyna , hee leaves Florence , and speedily returnes to Cardura to his Lady Amarantha , to whom hee punctually and fully relates the bitter reply, and sharpe and proud answere which her Sister Babtistyna had given and sent her, and leaveth not a syllable unrehearsed, but onely silenceth his mistaking, in giving of her her Fathers Letter in stead of her owne, as right now we understood. Amarantha is all inflamed with choller at this proud and cruell carriage of her Sister Babtistyna towards her, yea the remembrance thereof, so transporteth her thoughts with envie, and her heart with revenge against her, that shee vowes shee neither can, nor will brooke it at her hands; and heere, not hearkening either to Reason, or Religion, or to her Conscience, or Soule, shee now violently seduced, and exasperated by the Devill, doth afresh revive her old malice, and resumes her former pernicious resolutions to her Sister Babtistyna: Shee hath neither the wit, much lesse the grace, to consider, That Choller increaseth her own torment and misery, and that if wee vanquish not our owne malice and revenge, it is more to bee feared then doubted, that it will in the end both vanquish and ruine us. Shee hath formerly consented to poyson her eldest Sister Iaquinta , and now she likewise vowes, that shee will cause her elder Sister Babtistyna either to bee poyson'd or pistoll'd to death; but which of these to make choice of, as yet shee is irresolute, and upon this bloudy businesse her thoughts runne incessantly to her heart, as so many lines to their centre. O that so young a Lady, and so sweete a beauty should make her selfe accessary and guilty of so foule and inhumane crimes: but this I may write to her shame, and the Reader may please to observe it to his comfort, and retaine it to his instruction, That had she had the grace to have beene formerly sorrowfull and repentant for her first Murther, she had then never proceeded so farre, as to have made het selfe guilty of contriving and resolving a second. Babtistyna hath a Chamber-mayd named Pierya , of some twenty foure yeares old, who was farre more faire then rich, as being heire to much beauty, though to no lands, or estate; and having heretofore for some trivial respects somtimes incurred the anger and displeasure of her Lady and for the same received many a sharp word, and bitter blow from her, as being a freer Gentlewoman of her hands, then of her purse; Shee now accidentally chancing to breake a faire rich Looking-glasse of hers, her Lady doth not onely exceedingly beat her, but also without pitty or humanity drawes and drags her by the haire about her Chamber, and then againe and againe kickes her with her foot. Pierya's heart is not so ill lodged, nor her extraction and quality so contemptible, but that shee is very sensible of this her disgrace, as holding her fault farre inferiour to her correction, and therefore disdaining any longer to serve so cruell a Mistresse, she very privately packes up her apparell, leaves Florence , and flies to Cardura , forsakes Babtistyna , and so resolves henceforth to live and dye with her younger Sister Amarantha: But as there are many of both these places, who report that it was onely her hatred to Babtistyna , and her affection to Amarantha , which drew her to this resolution; yet there are diverse others both of Florence, Cardura , and Pistoia , who (better acquainted with Pierya , and her secrets) have solidly affirmed to mee, that it was wholly her affection to Bernardo , which was the truest reason, and strongest motive thereof, and the event and issue of this History, will confute the first, to confirme this second opinion of these her deliberations and resolutions; for, for the terme of at least three or foure yeares heretofore, Pierya was knowne to be passionately in love with Bernardo , and shee had imployed many friends towards him, to perswade and draw him to marry her; but hee was still as averse, as shee forward in this sute: For although hee were inamoured of her beauty, and loved her tall and slender personage, yet hee hated her poverty, and (because of some small lands and meanes hee had) as hee thought himselfe too good to bee her husband, so she in regard of her beauty, youth, and chastity, both highly and infinitely disdayned to bee his strumpet; and indeed the passage, and processe of these their affections was not from time to time unknowne to Amarantha. Pierya is as welcome to Amarantha , as Babtistyna is sorrowfull for her departure, and the youngest Sister now entertaynes her with as much courtesie, as the eldest formerly retayned her with cruelty; as for Bernardo , hee inwardly delights, though outwardly will not seeme to rejoyce in her company, and so gives her his eyes, though not his heart; and for Pierya , her carriage was so modest, and yet withall so respective to him, as if shee indeavoured to make it her chiefest ambition and glory, that her vertues and chastity should make as true and as perfect a conquest of his heart, as her beauty had of his eyes: as for Babtistyna (her quondam Lady) she is now angry with her selfe, as soone as shee knew of her departure from her; but when shee understands that Pierya is fled to Cardura , and lives with her discontented Sister Amarantha , then (under hand) shee makes strong meanes to her to returne againe to her service, intimating to her that shee is ready to redeeme her former discourtesie towards her, both with acknowledgement and requitall. But these her hopes will deceive her, for she will finde that errors are not so soone repayred as committed, and that her want of kindenesse to her Chamber-mayd Pierya may in the end (perchance) prove cruelty to her selfe. Pierya is deafe to all these her requests, and indeavours rather to tye her selfe to Amarantha's new affection, then to Babtistyna's old unkindnesse, as preferring the courtesie of the first to the choller and indignation of the second. On the other side, Amarantha is glad of this resolution of her new Mayd Pierya ; for the Devill being still at her elbow, he continually sets fire to her malice, and (as an infernall incendiary) perpetually blowes the coles to her revenge against her Sister Babtistyna ; yea, and now he so captivateth her soule, and extinguisheth her devotion and zeale towards heaven, that (I write it with pitty and sorrow, and not with passion, but compassion) shee had neither the power to pray, nor the happinesse or grace, either to frequent the Church for Gods sake, or to desire Gods presence and assistance for her owne: No, no, Such thoughts of piety were farre from her prophane thoughts and minde: for as her best blood, so her best zeale was now corrupted and polluted with revenge towards her Sister. And here, as a wretched Lady and a bloudy Sister, shee doth yet farre worse; for (by the Devills suggestion) shee assumes this horrible resolution, not onely to ingage and hazard her selfe, but others therein, as if shee tooke a pride, and conceived a glory, not to shipwracke her selfe alone, but to confound and cast away others with her for company in this prodigious and lamentable businesse of hers. The manner is thus: Shee knowes, that by reason of her strict exile in Cardura , she must needes imploy some factors and agents, either to poyson or murther this her Sister Babtistyna in Florence ; and therefore shee thinkes none so fit and proper to attempt and performe it, as her old trusty servant Bernardo , and her new mayd Pierya his sweetheart, whom (by degrees) shee purposely drawes and obligeth to her by gifts and promises; and her reason for this conceipt and opinion of hers, that they will concurre with her in this bloudy fact, is derived from this foundation and ground, that Love and Money may easily act wonders in the hearts and mindes of those, who desire the one, and want the other; as also, for that shee perfectly knowes, that for many yeares Pierya hath deepely loved Bernardo , and deerely desired and wished him for her husband, and that hee hath ever affected her, but onely disliked her poverty: Wherfore believing that she would doe much for the obtayning of this husband, and he for preferment and gold, she is resolute in making this her bloudy proposition to them; when not caring any more to write to her Father, shee is now as hasty as bloudy in her malice and revenge towards her Sister; and so impatient of delay (and without any further consideration with her selfe, or consultation either with her soule, or with God) shee taking time at advantage, first breakes with Pierya about this bloudy businesse, adding withall, that her desire and resolution is to have her Sister Babtistyna stifled in her bed; for now the Devill hath cast off her resolutions from poyson or ponyard; to which effect, shee promiseth to gaine her Bernardo to her husband, and to give them wherewithall to maintayne themselves well being marryed, if shee will consent with him to undertake and performe her request: which profers and promises of her Lady doe sound so sweetly in poore Pierya's eares, and worke so deepe an impression in her heart, especially that shee shall hereby injoy Bernardo for her husband, whom shee loves farre dearer then her owne life, that being wholly vanquished with the consideration thereof, as also inchanted with the sweet melody of her Ladies sugred perswasions, shee (without any feare or thought of God, as an inconsiderate and gracelesse Mayden) yieldes to her ungodly and inhumane requests; who then swearing her to secrecie, shee within a day or two after likewise boardeth her servant Bernardo upon this bloudy businesse, the which if hee will performe for her, and take Pierya to his wife, shee faithfully promiseth to give him 150 Duccatons of yearly Annuity, during his life, and to remayne their true and constant friend for ever. At first Bernardo wondereth and staggereth at the hearing of this cruell and lamentable project, as amazed and astonished thereat, as if hee were now so good a Christian, that Grace triumphed above Nature in his heart, and God above Satan in his soule; but at last being deeply inamoured of Pierya's delicate youth and beauty, which he likes well, and of this yearly summe of gold for their maintenance in marriage, which hee loves dearely, hee (forgetting himselfe, and which is worse God) without any further rubbes or rumination, gives his Lady Amarantha his free consent and promise to performe both her requests, as well of the Murther as Marriage. Whereupon shee carries him to her Closet, and there calls for Pierya and acquaints her with her and Bernardo's conclusion; So in her presence they (by joyning of hands) contract themselves each to other; and then they all three doe severally and joyntly sweare secrecie, as also punctually to accomplish this which they have concluded: When this wretched and execrable Amarantha (the faster and stronger to tye them to her desires and their promises) opens a Casket of hers, and gives each of them fifty Duckatons in gold, as a pledge and earnest penny of her love to them; and then faithfully promiseth to reward them with so much more, as soone as they have sent her Sister Babtistyna to heaven; when Bernardo and Pierya (to testifie their thankefulnesse to her) doe both vow and sweare, that herein (as in all things else) her will shall bee their law, and that both their best services and best lives shall for ever bee prostrate to her commands. But they shall repent the taking, and Amarantha the giving of them this gold, because it is the price and hire of innocent bloud. This lamentable (because sinfull) compact, being thus secretly shut up, and impiously concluded betweene these three wretched personages, then Bernardo and Pierya fall so close and thicke to their amorous kisses, as being desirous to become one in body, as already they are in heart and minde, they request their Lady Amarantha , that shee would please to permit them to finish and consummate their marriage, before they perpetrate the murther of her Sister Babtistyna ; but shee (who was clearer sighted in her malice and revenge to her said Sister, then they in their judgements and affections to themselves) considering that this seale of their marriage was the great tye, and Gordian knot for them to performe and finish her desire, the which if it were once solemnized, then their devotion and zeale thereunto might (peradventure) afterwards, either grow cold, or freeze, if not shortly wither and dye away upon the designe, shee strongly opposes and contradicts it, as affirming they shall first dispatch her sister before they marry; the which Bernardo well observing and considering, hee thinkes it no folly in him to learne by her, and so to make her discretion his: and therefore that this Murther beeing once committed, shee might after at her pleasure revoke her verball Annuity given him; the which to prevent (and so to bee as wise in his covetousnesse, as she was cruell and bloudy in her bounty) he tells his Lady Amarantha , that according to her desire he will willingly deferre his marriage till then, but withall, humbly requesteth her to give him her promised Annuity written, and signed with her owne hand; the which because shee cannot well refuse, shee then and there doth in these tearmes:  wife my Chamber-mayd Pierya , I doe promise, that (after the consummation thereof) upon my fidelity and honour, I will yearely give and pay unto the said Bernardo , or his Assignes, during all the tearme of his life, the full and intire summe of one hundred and fifty Duckatons of Florence Money, and in witnesse and testimony of this truth, I hereunto subsigne my name. Amarantha.  A promise and contract written with more bloud then inke, or rather not with inke, but wholly with bloud, and which therefore God, in his divine providence, may hereafter produce, and bring to light, to serve as a powerfull witnesse, and Instrument of his glory, and peradventure to the infamy and confusion of those who gave and received it. Amarantha having thus given this promise to Bernardo , and likewise received his, and his intended wifes Pierya's oaths in counterchange, she now thinkes with her selfe, that she must againe returne Pierya to Florence , and by some slie hypocrisie, to reinvest and skrew her anew into her old Lady Babtistyna's service, thereby to be the more able and fit to dispatch her. Now, as she is maliciously ruminating on this invention, there falls out an accident, which seemes both to favour her hopes, and to further her desires and expectation herein; For by this time, Babtistyna writes over to Malevola , to deale secretly and seriously with Pierya for her returne to Florence to her service, and that shee shall finde her welcome to exceed her expectation and desires: So the truth is apparant, that Pierya (instructed by the Premises) now needs not many great perswasions from Malevola , to draw her to consent to this resolution; for as she and her Bernardo receive the first motion of this (unexpected) newes with joy, so Amarantha imbraceth and entertaines it with delight, and now their last consultation is held between them, about the conclusion and finishing of this mournefull businesse. To which end, Pierya is dispatched for Florence , and the fifteenth day after, Bernardo is likewise secretly and precisely to arrive there to her by night, and then is the direct appoynted time for them to close and shut up this Tragedy. Wee must now allow and conceive Pierya to be againe entertayned of her old Lady Babtistyna in Florence , with much courtesie and joy; and for the seale and cyment of this their reciprocall reconciliation, her Lady gives her a new blacke wrought Silke Gowne, and a purple Damaske Petticoat, the which (as a treacherous dissembling wretch) she seemes to receive of her with much content and thankefulnesse, the which yet wee shall shortly see her requite with a most inhumane and prodigious ingratitude; for her desire of marriage, and longing for a husband makes her thinke every houre ten, before the fifteenth day bee arrived. And for her late Lady Amarantha (who sees by no other eyes but by those of malice and revenge towards her Sister) shee thinkes every day an age, before shee heare of her dispatch. At the expiration of which time (according to their former agreement) Bernardo arrived by night at Streni's house in Florence , and at one of the Clocke after midnight hee findes the little Garden doore open, and his Pierya there purposely to receive and welcome him; so they beginne their meeting with kisses. Shee leades him by the hand to the outer doore of her Ladies chamber, and they two having agreed on the manner how to stifle her in her bed, shee had there to that purpose provided two pillowes, keepes one and gives him another to effect it: These miserable wretches (for the more secrecie) put off their shooes, and out the candles, and the darknesse of the Moone, and the obscurity of the night seeming to conspire to their conspiracie, they softly enter her chamber, goe one by one side, and the other by the other, where unfortunat Babtistyna lying soundly sleeping and snoring, they stifle her with their Pillowes, and then a little whiles after thrust a handkercher into her mouth, and their fury and malice was so fierce and implacable towards her, as shee hath neither the grace to speake, nor the power once to screech or crye. Thus she who had formerly poysoned her elder Sister Iaquinta , is now also cruelly murthered by the treachery of her youngest Amarantha , which makes me crie out and say, O Lord, as thou art immense in thy mercie, so thou art inscrutable in thy judgements, and that therfore, as wee ought not, so we cannot resist his divine power and eternall preordination . Bernardo and Pierya (as two limbes of the Devill) having finished this cruell murther on Babtistyna , they leave her breathlesse body on her bed, and then withdrawing themselves from her Chamber, they softly pull fast the doore, which had a Spring-locke, and then shee secretly throwes in the key within side, at a private hole, or crannie; when her Sweet-heart and her selfe descend the stayres, and with wonderfull silence stalke away to the Garden, without the Posterne doore whereof, his horse, tyed up to an Iron ring in the wall, awayted, and attended him; where with a multitude of kisses they part, he faithfully promising her to returne to her againe at Florence within a moneth after at most, and then to marry her: So whiles Pierya now (in the depth and dead of this dismall night) betakes her selfe to her bed, and there (as devoyd of feare as of grace) sleepes soundly, her sweet-heart Bernardo , that very obscure night, gallops thorow the streets of Florence towards the gate which leads to Pistoia , where God (in all seeing providence) causeth his horse to stumble, and fall with him to the ground, whereof hee brake his necke, and presently dyed, and his horse then rising flyes from him straglingly in the streets, leaving the breathlesse corps of Bernardo in the street, having not the happines either to crie or utter one word at this his sudden  & disastrous death; God having so ordain'd and decreed in his Star- chamber of heaven, that although for the murthering of the Lady Babtistyna he deserved a more shamefull end, yet that this poore horse which brought him to Florence , should at the same time and place be his executioner, as also that there was scarce one houre between his crime and his punishment, between her murther and his own death: An act and example of Gods justice, worthy of all men to know, and of all Christians most especially to remember, so secret and sacred are the judgements of the Lord of Hosts. All that night Bernardo's dead body lay gored in his blood (which abundantly issued forth his mouth) as also in the dirt of the street, unespyed of any mortall eye; but as soone as the morning began to appeare thorow the windowes of heaven, then it was found, and likewise to bee done by the fall of a horse, whereof his necke the beholders saw was broken, the which the sooner they were induced and led to believe, because they likewise found a horse neere him stragling in the streets without his rider: This his dead body is therefore presently exposed to the Criminall Iudges of that faire and famous City, who forthwith cause his Pockets to be searched, where in stead of gold they by the direction of God find the before nominated promise of a yearly Annuity, which we have formerly understood Amarantha gave him: Whereupon, they knowing the Lady Amarantha to be Seig. Leonardo Streni's daughter,  & by this note confidently believing this dead man to be the same Bernardo , and he to be Amarantha's servant, they (without once suspecting or dreaming of any murther committed by him) hold it a part of their office and duety to acquaint Streni herewith. But the newes of this dead found Corps ratling thorow the streets of the City, it devanceth this care of theirs, and so speedily arrives to Streni's house before them; whereat Pierya (looking for nothing lesse) takes so hot an allarum of griefe, feare, and despaire, that her guilty thoughts and conscience (like so many Blood-hounds) still pursuing her, she seeing this unlookt for disaster and death of her Bernardo to bee an act of God, and a blow from heaven, which infallibly predicted both her danger and death; she therefore presently flies out a doore, and (with much celerity, and more feare) betakes her selfe to the least frequented and most remotest streets of the City for her safety. By this time the Criminall officers are arrived at Streni's house, whom they acquaint with this mournefull accident, shew him this assurance of Annuity, and inquire of him if it bee the Lady Amarantha his Daughters hand, as also the dead Corps, and if this were her servant, who (with a countenance composed of astonishment, feare, and sorrow) acknowledgeth to them, that it is his Daughter Amarantha's owne hand writing, and the dead personage to bee her Servingman Bernardo : Whereupon they confidently believe, and hee sorrowfully feares, that this death of his, and that assurance of hers, doth either import or include some greater disaster and misfortune; whereupon, they againe modestly, yet juridically, demand of him for his Daughter Amarantha , and her Chamber-mayd Pierya , who returnes them this answer, that the first is at his Mannor of Cardura neere Pistoia , and the second here in his house, and now serving his eldest Daughter Babtistyna ; they demand to speake with Pierya , whom hee causeth to bee sought in all places of his house, but shee is not to bee found; so hee sends to looke her in his Daughters chamber, her Mistresse, but his servants returne and report that the doore of that Chamber is fast lock'd, and that they can get no speech either of her, or of the Lady Babtistyna ; which answer of theirs doth exceedingly augment the jealousie of the Iudges, and the feare of the Father: So they all resolve to ascend themselves to that Chamber, where they aloud againe calling both the Lady and her Mayd, and hearing no answer of either of them, they instantly cause the doore to bee forced open; where (contrary to their expectation) they finde the Lady Babtistyna dead, and well neere cold in her bed, and causing her body to bee secretly searched by some Chirurgians, and neighbor Gentlewomen, they all are of opinion, that shee is undoubtedly stifled in her bed, and her face very much blacke and swolne with struggling for life against death. They are amazed, and her Father Streni almost drowned in his sorrowfull teares at the sight of this deplorable accident, and mournefull spectacle; and therefore what to say, or how to beare himselfe herein hee knowes not. But the Iudges upon farther knowledge and consideration of the flight of Pierya , the death of Bernardo , and the promised Annuity of Amarantha upon their marriage (as it were prompted by God) doe vehemently suspect and believe that they all three were undoubtedly consenting  & guilty of Babtistyna's death, notwithstanding that the Key of her Chamber was found thrown in within side: So they presently leave this sorrowfull Father to his teares, and betaking themselves to their Seat of Iustice, doe instantly cause all the Gates of the City to be shut, and a strict and curious search to be made in all parts thereof, for the apprehension of Pierya , which (in their zeale and honour to sacred justice) they performe with so much care and speed, as within three houres after shee is found out, and apprehended in an Aunts house of hers, who was a poore woman and a Laundresse of that City named Eleanora Fracasa . The Iudges being presently advertised hereof, convent her before them, and (by vertue of this Annuity) charge both her and her lover Bernardo to bee the actors, and Amarantha to bee at least the accessary, if not the authour with them of murthering Babtistyna , shee can hardly speake for teares at this her examination, because her sighes still cut her words in pieces; and yet she is so farre from grace and repentance, as at first shee stoutly denyes all, and boldly affirmes that both Amarantha, Bernardo , and her selfe were every way innocent of attempting any thing against Babtistyna's life, and that if shee were dead, shee dyed onely of a naturall death by the appoyntment of God, and no otherwise; and to this Answer of hers the Devill had made her so strong, as shee added many fearfull oaths and deprecations, both for her owne and their justification; but yet (notwithstanding this her Apologie) these grave and cleere-sighted Iudges are so farre from diminishing, as they augment their suspition both of her and them, and so commit her to prison, and forthwith to the racke. At the pronouncing of which Sentence, Pierya is much daunted, seemes to let fall some of her former fortitude and constancie, and to burst forth into many passionate teares, sighs, and exclamations: But they will nothing availe her; for, seeing her pretended Husband Bernardo dead, in whom lived the imaginary joyes of her heart, shee so fainted, as at the very first sight of the Racke (with some teares, and more deep fetch'd sighes) shee confessed to her Iudges, that shee and Bernardo had stifled her Lady Babtistyna in her bed; but still constantly affirmed that her sister Amarantha was wholly innocent thereof, flattering her selfe with this hope, that for thus her cleering of her Lady Amarantha from this crime and danger, shee (in requitall thereof) could doe no lesse then bee a meanes to procure a pardon for her life: But these hopes of hers will deceive her, and flie as fast from her hereafter, as ever shee formerly did from God. So the Iudges (in detestation of this her foule and bloudy crime) adjudge her to bee hanged for the same; but first they send her backe to prison, and the very next morning before breake of day, they secretly send away three of their Isbieres (or Sergeants) to Cardura , to fetch the Lady Amarantha to Florence , being very confident (notwithstanding Pierya's denyall) that shee likewise had a deepe finger and share in her Sister Babtistyna's murther. Amarantha not dreaming in Cardura what had betided in Florence to Bernardo and Pierya , but flattering her selfe with much hope and joy, that by this time they had undoubtedly made away her Sister Babtistyna , and consequently that she should shortly revisite Florence , and there domineere alone, and obtaine some gallant Cavallier of her Father for her husband, shee in expectance of her servant Bernardo's returne, and of his pleasing newes, had that day (as it were in a bravery and triumph) purposely dighted her selfe up in her best attire, and richest apparell; and so betaking her selfe to her Chamber, and to that window which looked towards Florence , shee with a longing desire expecteth ev'ry minute when he will arrive; when about ten of the clocke before dinner (contrary to her expectation) shee sees three men to enter into the house, apparelled as Florentines , whereat shee much museth and wondereth, as not knowing what they, or their comming should import. These three Sergeants having entred the house, they are brought to the Governesse Malevola , who brings them to her young Lady Amarantha in her Chamber; to whom (with a dissembling confidence) they report to her, That Seignior Streni her Father hath sent them to conduct and accompany her speedily to Florence. Amarantha inquires of them for her Fathers Letters to that effect, whereunto one of the subtlest of them makes answer very slylie and artificially to her, that her Fathers haste, and her preferment would not permit him to write to her, for that hee perfectly knew from him, hee was now upon matching her to a rich and noble Husband: Her Governesse Malevola likewise demands of them, if hee had not written to her selfe; they answer no, but that hee bad them tell her, that he will'd her without delay to bring away his Daughter Amarantha with her, and themselves to Florence by Coach, and onely one Foot-boy. The Pupill and Governesse consult hereon, and the very name of a Husband makes the first as willing as the second is discontented to goe to Florence without a Letter; but the policie of the Sergeants so prevaile with the simplicity of this young Lady, and old Gentlewoman, that they speedily packe up their Trunkes, so dine, and then take Coach and horse, and away for Florence ; during which short journey, although the mirth and joy of Amarantha bee great, yet shee findes so many different reluctations, and extravagant thoughts in her minde at the absence and silence of her man Bernardo , as shee cannot possibly againe refraine from musing and wondering thereat. They all arrive at Florence , where these Sergeants (having learnt their parts well, and acting them better) in stead of Amarantha's Fathers house, doe clap her up close prisoner in the Common Goale of that City, notwithstanding all her prayers and cries, sighes and teares to the contrary; and then send her Governesse Malevola home to her said Father to advertise him hereof; who tearing the snow-white haire of his head and beard at this sad newes, and extreamely fearing the dangerous consequence of this deplorable accident, he (with teares in his eyes, sorrow in his lookes, and sighes in his speeches) repaires speedily to the Iudges, to whom sorrowfully and humbly casting himselfe almost as low as their feet, hee prayes them to thinke of his age, and of his imprisoned Daughters youth, and that having unfortunately lost his eldest Daughter, that they would not deprive him of his youngest, nor cast her life away either upon bare presumption or circumstance, or upon the wrongful reports and malice of his and her enemies: But these grave and Lynce-ey'd Magistrates (who looke as deepely into the priviledge and dignity of Iustice, as hee doth into the passions of paternall affection and nature) cut him off with this sharpe reply, That they honour his age, and respect his Daughters youth, that she shall have justice, and that by the lawes of Florence he must expect no more; with which cold answer hee returnes home to his house, as disconsolate, as hee came foorth sorrowfull, beeing not permitted, but defended to see, or speake with his Daughter Amarantha in prison, onely hee hath permission to bury his murthered Daughter Babtistyna , the which hee performeth with farre more griefe and sorrow then solemnity. The truth and decorum of this History must now invite the Reader to visite Amarantha in prison, who being there debarr'd from speaking with any, or any with her, except (those miserable comforters) her Sergeants and Goalers, shee now seeing the imminencie of her danger, and fearing the assurance of her death, for that shee heard a secret inckling (from the lower Court, through her Chamber window) That her Sister Babtistyna was murthered, her Mayd Pierya imprisoned, and shee herselfe vehemently suspected for the same: Shee therefore now beginnes to think of her former bloudy crimes with repentance, and of these her inhumane cruelties towards her two elder Sisters with contrition, and solemnly vowes to God, that if his divine Majesty will now please to save her life, shee will henceforth religiously redeeme the first and second with repentance. So in the middest of these good thoughts, though vaine desires and wishes of hers, shee yet still flatters her selfe with this poore hope, that if her man Bernardo bee living, then her promised Annuity to him written with her owne hand is still sure, and therefore tacitly dead in his custody; and that both hee and Pierya cannot any way wrong her without infinitely wronging themselves, and indangering their owne lives: so albeit her Iudges have matter of suspicion, yet they can have no cause of death against her, or if peradventure they have, yet that the power of her Fathers greatnesse and friends are so prevalent in Florence and Tuscany , that (if the worst fall out) he and they can obtaine at least her reprivall for the present, if not her pardon for the future. But (contrary to all these her weake and triviall hopes) the very next morning she is sent for before her Iudges to a private examination, who (after they had made a grave and religious speech to her) they demand her, first, If shee imployed not her servant Bernardo , and Pierya to murther her Sister Babtistyna , the which shee firmely and constantly denyes; Secondly, If shee had not given an Annuity of 150 Duckatons during his life to marry Pierya , the which shee likewise denyes; then they produce and shew it her under her owne hand writing, whereat (they measuring her heart by her countenance) shee seemes to be so much perplexd with sorrow, and amaz'd with feare, as shee cannot refraine from giving them lesse words, but more teares; Of which her Iudges conceiving a good opinion  & hope (& therfore deeming themselves now to be in a faire way, and a direct course to obtain the whole truth of this lamentable busines from her) they bethinke themselves of a policie, thereby to effect and compasse it, which is every way worthy of themselves and their offices, of their discretion and justice. They tell Amarantha , that in regard of her youth and beauty, and of her Fathers age and nobility, they desire and intend to save her, if shee will not wilfully cast her selfe away; That her safety and life now consisteth in her plaine confession, and not in her perverse denyall and contestation, of being accessary and consenting to the murther of her Sister Babtistyna ; That they have proofes thereof, as cleare, and as apparant as the Sunne: and that they having caused Pierya to bee executed for the same this morning, shee confessed it to them at her death, yea and dyed thereon. At which speeches of her Iudges, and confession and death of Pierya , this wretched and unfortunate Lady Amarantha (seeing her selfe so palpably convicted of this her bloudy and inhumane crime) being wholly vanquished either with feare toward her selfe, or choller towards Pierya , she falls on her knees to her Iudges feet, and (with a great showre of teares) makes her selfe (by her free confession) to bee the prime authour of her Sister Babtistyna's murther; That shee had hired Bernardo and Pierya to performe it, and given him an Annuity of 150 Duckatons per annum , and to each of them 50 Duckatons more in hand to that effect, concealing no poynt or part thereof, as we have already formerly understood: when (contrary to the expectation of her Iudges) she most bitterly exclaymed on the name, memory, and ingratitude of this base wretch Pierya (for so shee then termed her) in that she could not be contented to die her self, but also as much, and as maliciously, as in her power, to think likewise to hazard her owne life with her. And now our chollericke, and yet sorrowfull Amarantha (between these two different extreames of hope and feare) layes hold of her Iudges late promise and profered courtesie to her to save her, and then and there (with many reverences, teares, and ringing of her hands) most humbly beseecheth them for Gods sake, and for honours cause, to bee good unto her, and to give her her life, although she confesseth she is most worthy of death, in being so degenerate and bloudy minded towards her owne Sister. But they (having by this commendable meanes, and artificiall policie, drawn this worme from Amarantha's tongue, I meane this truth from her mouth) are exceeding sorrowfull, and as much detest this her barbarous fact, as they pitty her descent, youth, and beauty; but well knowing with themselves that God is glorifyed in the due and true execution of Iustice upon all capitall malefactors, and especially on murtherers (who are no lesse then monsters of nature, the disgrace of their times, and the very butchers of mankinde) and that the greatnesse of their quality and blood doth onely serve but to make these crimes of theirs the greater: therefore (I say) these wise and religious Iudges proove deafe to her requests, and blinde to her teares; and so having first caused her to signe this her confession, and then confronted her with Pierya , who now to Amarantha's face confirmed as much as she her selfe right now confessed and affirmed, they now in expiation of this her cruell murther, adjudge her likewise to bee hanged the next day, at the common place of execution, in company of Pierya , although her aged sorrowfull Father Seignior Streni (being well nigh weighed down to his grave with the extreme grief and sorrow of these his misfortunes and calamities) profered the Iudges and the great Duke the greatest part of his estate, and lands, to save this his youngest, and now his only Daughter Amarantha : But his labor proved lost, and his care and affection vaine in this his sute and solicitation, because those learned Iudges, and this prudent and noble Duke, grounded their resolutions and pleasures upon this wholsom and true Maxime, That Iustice is one of the greatest Colossus and strongest columns of kingdoms and common-weales, and the truest way and means to preserve them in florishing prosperity and glory, and consequently, that all wilfull and premeditated murtherers cannot bee either too soone exterminated, or too severely punished, and cut off from the world. So Amarantha with more choller then sorrow, and Pierya with more feare then choller, are now both sent backe to their prisons; and that night Streni sends his Daughter, and the Iudges send Pierya , some Fryers and Nunnes to prepare their soules for heaven, but (in honour of the truth) I must affirme with equall griefe and pitty, that both these two female monsters had their hearts so sealed, and their soules so seared up with impiety, that neither of them could there be perswaded, or drawne, either to thinke of repentance or of God. Whiles thus Florence resounds of these their foule and inhumane crimes, as also of their just condemnations, the next morning about ten of the clocke, they are brought to the destin'd place of execution, there to receive their condigne punishments for the same. Pierya first mounts the Ladder, who made a short speech at her death, to this effect, That her desire to obtaine Bernardo for her husband had chiefely drawne her to commit this murther on her Lady Babtistyna , and that it was farre more her Sister Amarantha's malice to her, then her owne, which seduced her to this bloudy resolution; and that this her owne shamefull death was not halfe so grievous to her, as the unfortunate end of her lover Bernardo , whom, shee there affirmed to the world, and tooke it to her death, that shee loved a thousand times dearer then her owne life, with many other vaine and ridiculous speeches tending that way, and which savoured more of her fond affection to him, than of any zeale or devotion to God; and therefore I hold them every way more worthy of my silence, then of my relation: and so shee was turned over. To second whose unfortunate and shamefull end, now our bloudy and execrable Amarantha (with farre more beauty then contrition, and bravery then repentance) ascends the Ladder; who (to make her infamy the more famous) had purposly dighted and apparelled her selfe in a plaine blacke Sattin gowne, with silver lace, and a deepe-laced Cambricke Ruffe of a very large Set, with her hayre unvailed, and decked with many roses of silver Ribband: At her ascent, her extraction, beauty, and youth, begate as much pitty, as her bloudy and unnaturall crime did detestation, in the eyes and hearts of all her spectatours: When after a pause or two, shee (vainely composing her countenance, more with contempt, then feare of death) there to a world of people, who flocked from all parts of the City and Countrey to see her dye (with a wondrous boldnesse) confessed, That shee had not onely caused her Sister Babtistyna to bee stifled in her bed by Bernardo and Pierya , but that her sayd Sister Babtistyna and her selfe had formerly poysoned their elder Sister Iaquinta , and that it was onely their imperiousnesse and pride towards her, which drew her to this resolution and revenge against them both; the which shee affirmed, shee could now as little repent, as heretofore remedy, and that shee more sensibly lamented, and grieved for the sorrowes of her Fathers life, then for the shame and infamy of her owne death: when, without any shew of repentance, without any speech of God, or which is lesse, without so much as once looking up towards heaven, or inviting or praying her spectatours to pray to God for her soule, shee (with a gracelesse resolution, and prophane boldnesse) conjured her Executioner speedily to performe his office and duety, which by the command of the Magistrate he forthwith did. So this wretched Amarantha was hanged for her second murther, and then by a second decree and sentence of the Criminall Iudges, her body is after dinner burnt to ashes for her first; who likewise, in honour to Iustice, and to the glory of God, doe also cause the dead body of Bernardo (for two whole dayes) to bee hanged by his feet in his shirt to the same Gallowes, and then to bee cast into the River of Arno . And here the Iudges also, to shew themselves, themselves, were once of opinion to have unburyed Babtistyna , and likewise to have given her dead body some opprobrious punishment, for being accessary with her Sister Amarantha to poyson their elder Sister laquinta ; but having no other evidence or proofe hereof, but onely the testimony of her condemned dying Sister Amarantha , whom it was more probable then impossible, shee might speake it more out of malice then truth, as also that God had already afflicted a deplorable end and punishment to her, they therefore omitted it. And thus was the deserved ends, and condigne punishments of these wretched and execrable murtherers; and in this manner did the just revenge, and sacred justice of God meete and triumph over them and their bloudy crimes. And now here fully to conclude and shut up this History in all its circumstances; The griefes and sorrowes of this unfortunate old Father was so great and infinite, for the untimely and deplorable deaths of all these his three onely Daughters and Children, that although piety and religion had formerly taught him, that the afflictions of this life are the joyes of that to come, yet being wholly vanquished and depressed with all these his different bitter crosses and calamities, hee left Florence , and retired himselfe to a solitary life in Cardura, where hee not long survived them, but dyed very pensively and mournfully. GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND EXECRABLE Sinne of Murther .  Martino poysoneth his Brother Pedro , and murthereth Monfredo in the streete; He afterwards growes mad, and in confession reveales both these his murthers to Father Thomas his Ghostly Father, who afterwards dying, reveales it by his Letter to Cecilliana , who was Widdow to Monfredo , and Sister to Pedro and Martino. Martino hath first his right hand cut off, and then is hanged for the same.  it is wretched and execrable one to finish, and perpetrate it; for to kill our Christian Brother, who figuratively beares the image of God, is an act so odious, as Nature cannot excuse, and so diabolicall, as no Clemencie can pardon; And yet this age, and this world is but too plentifull and fertile of such bloudy Tigers, and inhumane Monsters, and Butchers of mankinde, as if they had not a Conscience within them to accuse them, a God above them to condemne them, and a Hell below them to punish them; or as if they had not the sacred Oracles of Gods eternall Word, I meane the Law and the Gospell, and the blessed Precepts and Doctrine of the holy Prophets and Apostles, yea, of Christ Iesus himselfe, the great Shepherd, and sacred Bishop of our soules, to teach us the rules of Mercie, Meekenesse, and Long-suffering, whiles wee live in this vale of misery here below, and that wee must imbrace and follow Peace and Charity with all men, if ever wee thinke to participate of the true felicity and joyes of Heaven above: But neverthelesse (yea directly contrary hereunto) this insuing History will produce us one, who though sufficiently instructed in the rules of Piety and Charity, yet hee wilfully abandoned the first, and contemned the second, by cruelly and unnaturally imbruing his hands in innocent bloud; for the which wee shall see, that hee in the end suffereth a severe and shamefull death. May we reade this History to the glory of God, and the iustruction of our selves. old Castile , and in the faire and ancient City of Burgos , where lately dwelt a noble and rich old Gentlewoman, termed Dona Catherina Antunez (a Sirname much knowne, and famous in that City, Province, and Kingdome) who had by her deceased Husband Don Roderigo de Ricaldo , two sonnes, Don Pedro , and Don Martino , and one Daughter named Dona Cecilliana . Her eldest sonne Don Pedro was a gallant Cavallier of some eight and twenty yeares of age, tall, and well-timbred, by complexion and hayre blacke, and of a swart and martiall countenance, who for the space of seven yeares served as a voluntary Gentleman under that wise and valiant Commander Don GonsaleZ de Cordova in Germany , and against the Lords States of the Netherlands, and since in the Voltoline and Millane, against the Grisons and French ; In both which warres, he left behind him many memorable testimonies of his prowesse, and purchased divers honorable trophees of true valour, and generosity: but for any other intellectuall endowments of the minde, hee was no scholler, and but of an indifferent capacity, yet very honest, courteous, and affable, particularly to his friends, and generally to all the world. His Brother Don Martino was of some foure and twenty yeares of age, short of stature, very slender, but crooke-back'd, of an Aubrun hayre, a withered face, a squint eye, of inclination extreamely sullen, and of disposition and nature envious and revengefull, as desirous rather to entertaine a night-quarrell in the street, then a day-combate in the Field; but as God is many times pleased to countervaile and reward the defects of nature in the body, with some rich gifts and perfections of the mind, so though not by profession, yet by education he was an excellent Scholler, of an active and sharpe wit, a fluent tongue, and singularly able either to allure or divert, to perswade or disswade, according as the streame of his different passions and affections led him; Vertues enough relucent and excellent to build a fame, and sufficient to rayse an eminent fortune, if his former vices doe not too fatally eclipse the one, and deface the other. Their Sister Cecilliana (aged of some twenty yeares) was of an indifferent height, but growing to corpulencie and fatnesse, of a blacke hayre, an amiable browne complexion, a big rolling eye, and the ayre of her countenance rather beautifully amorous, then modestly beautifull: Shee was of a nimble wit, of humour pleasant and facetious, yet so reserved in the externall-demonstration thereof, that through her Mothers pious and austere education of her, shee (in all outward semblance) seemed rather to bee fit for a Nunnery then a Husband, and more proper to make a Saint, then a Wife; but as the face proves not still a true Index of the heart, nor our lookes and speeches still a true Sybile of our soules, so how retired soever her Mother kept her from the company of men, yet her wanton eye, conspiring with her lascivious heart, made her the more desirous thereof, and farre the more licentiously, in regard shee was strictly forbidden it; so as (not to contradict or dissemble the truth) I am here inforced to relate and affirme, that shee imparteth her favours upon two or three young Gentlemen of that Citie, of her private acquaintance, and is more familiar with them, then modesty can well warrant, or chastity allow of. But there is a young Gallant of this City likewise (more noble by birth, then rich in estate and meanes) named Don Balthazar de Monfredo , who (deeming Cecilliana as famous for her chastity, as for her beauty) beares a singular affection to her; yea, his heart and thoughts are so fervently intangled in the snares of her delicious beauty, that in publicke and private, in his desires and wishes, and in his speech and actions he proclaimes her to bee his Mistresse, and himselfe her servant; and if hee affect and desire Cecilliana for his Wife, no lesse doth shee Monfredo for her Husband; so that they many times by stealth meet and conferre privately in remote Churches and Chappells, it being rather a prophane then a religious custome of Spaine (wherein Heaven is too much made to stoope to Earth, and Religion to Impiety) for men to court their intended wives, and (which is worse) many times their Courtizans and Strumpets. Cecilliana (oftentimes warranted by her Mothers indisposition) can no sooner take Coach to injoy the pleasure and benefit of the fresh ayre abroad in the fragrant fields, but Monfredo assuredly meets her, where leaping from his Coach into hers (and leaving his Page to accompany her Wayting-gentlewoman in his own) they at first familiarly kisse and confer, and in a few of these meetings at last effectually resolve to give themselves each to other in the sacred bonds of marriage; so he gives her a rich Diamond ring, and she reciprocally returnes him a paire of Gold bracelets, in token of marriage, and they then and there (calling God to witnes) very solemnly contract themselves man and wife, yet for some solid reasons, and important considerations, which conduce to the better accomplishing of their desires, they for a time conclude to beare it secretly and silently from all the world; and it is concluded and agreed betweene them, that a moneth after, and not before, hee shall attempt to seeke her publikely in marriage, both of her Mother the Lady Catherina, as also of her two Brothers Don Pedro and Don Martino . So when this moneth is past over (which to these our two Lovers seemes to be many ages) Monfredo very fairely and orderly seekes her of her Mother in marriage, and likewise (in tearmes fit for him to give, and them to receive) acquaints her two Brothers with his sute and affection to their Sister, and with his best art and eloquence indeavoureth (on honorable tearmes) to gaine and purchase their consents thereunto. As for her Mother, she (preferring wealth to honour, and riches to content) considering the weakenesse of Monfredo's estate, the death of his parents, whereby shee sees him deprived of all future hope to raise his fortunes, doth absolutely denye to bestow her Daughter on him in marriage; and the more to bewray her extreame distaste of this his sute and dislike of himselfe, shee (with much obstinacie and choller forbids him her Daughters company, and (with more incivility and indignation) conjures him to leave and forbeare her house, telling him shee hath already firmely ingaged her word and promise to Don Alonso Delrio, that hee shall shortly espouse and marry her. Now although this sharpe answer of hers seeme to nip Monfredo's hopes and desires in their blossomes, yet relying more on the affection and constancie of the Daughter, then on the power or resolution of the Mother, hee againe and againe (with a most respective and honourable importunity) solliciteth her consent; but he sees it lost labour, because shee is resolute that her first shall bee her last answer to him herein. As for her Brother Don Pedro, he loves his Sister so perfectly, and her content so dearely, that hee findes him to stand well affected to their affections, and in regard of his love to her, and respect to him, that hee utterly contemnes the notion and mention of Delrio ; and therfore faithfully promiseth Monfredo his best assistance towards his Mother for the effecting of their desires. But for her yonger brother, Don Martino, he findes a contrary nature and disposition in him; for he never loved, but hated his Sister Cecilliana , and therfore hates Monfredo for her sake, and loves Delrio , because he heares she hates him, and so animates his Mother against them; and thus hee gives Monfredo cold answers, and (the sooner and better to convert his hope into despaire) tells him plainely, that Delrio must and shall marry his Sister, and none but hee: Thus Monfredo departs, as glad of Don Pedro his love, as hee is sorrowfull for his Mother and Brother Don Martino's hatred. And here (to observe the better order in this History, and likewise to give the curiosity of the Reader the fuller satisfaction) it will not be improper rather pertinent for us to understand, that Don Delrio was a well descended Gentleman likewise of the same city of Burgos, rich in lands and monyes, but at least fifty five yeares old, having a white head and beard, of a hard and soure favoure, and exceedingly baker-legged; yet as old as hee was, hee was so passionately inamoured of the fresh and sweet beauty of Cecilliana, that hee thought her not too young to bee his wife, nor himselfe too old to bee her husband, but led more by his lust then his judgement, and incouraged by Dona Catherina her Mother, for that his great lands and wealth wholly inclined and weighed downe her affection towards him, hee often visiteth her Daughter Cecilliana, and with his best oratory and power seeks and courts her affection in the way of marriage: but shee having her heart fixed on Monfredo's youth, and comely feature, shee highly slights Delrio's frozen age, as disdayning to make her selfe a May to this December, because shee apprantly knew, and perfectly believed, that hee was every way fitter for his grave, then for her bed; for it was Monfredo, and onely Monfredo, whom her heart had elected and chosen for her second selfe and Husband: And suppose (quoth she) that Monfredo bee not so rich as Delrio, yet all Castile, yea all Spayne well knowes, that by descent and generosity hee is farre more noble, and that there is as great an Antithesis and disparity betweene the vertues of the first, and the defects and imperfections of the last, as there is betweene a Clowne and a Captaine, and a Peasant and a Prince; therefore let my Mother say whar she will, Delrio what he can, or my Brother Martino what he dare, yet they shall see, and the world know, that I will bee wife to none but Monfredo, and that either hee, or my Grave, shall bee my Husband. But the Lady Catherina her Mother (notwithstanding her Daughters aversnesse and obstinacie) layes her charge and blessing upon her to forsake Monfredo, and take Delrio, urging to her the poverty of the one, and the wealth of the other, what delights and contentments the last will give her, and what afflictions and misery the first doth threaten her: but the affection of Cecilliana is still so firmely fixed, and strongly setled and cymented on her Monfredo , that she is deafe to these requests, and blinde to these reasons of her Mother, in seeking to disswade her from him, and in consenting and perswading her to accept of Delrio for her Husband; and although her Mother follow her in all places as her shadow, and haunt her at all times as her Ghost, to draw her hereunto, yet shee still findes her Daughter as resolute to denye, as shee is importunate to request it of her, vowing that shee will rather wed her selfe to a Nunnery, then to Delrio , whom shee sayth shee cannot affect, and therefore peremptorily disdayneth to marry. Her Mother seeing her daughter thus constantly and wilfully to persevere in her obstinacy against her desires, shee (with much choller and griefe) relates from poynt to poynt to her Sonne Don Martino what had past betweene them; whom shee knew did as much love Delrio , and hate Monfredo , as her eldest Sonne Don Pedro hated Delrio , and loved Monfredo for their Sister in marriage. Martino takes advantage of this occasion and oportunity, and thinking to give two blowes with one stone, by crossing his Sister in her affection, and his Brother in his designes and wishes, doth now more then ever incense his Mother against her, alledging that it would bee a farre greater honour, and lesse scandall to their Name and House, that shee were rather marryed to a Nunnery, then a Beggar, and with many powerfull reasons and artificiall perswasions, strives to make her inclinable to this project, and flexible to this resolution of his, as indeed in a little time she doth: For the Mother being thus wedded to her will, and therein now confirmed by the slie policie and fortifyed by the subtile insinuation of her Sonne Don Martino , shee hereupon constantly resolves to betake and give her Daughter to God and the Church, affirming that shee shall never reape any true content in her thoughts, nor peace her heart, before she see her cloystered up and espoused to a Nunnery. But this compact of theirs is not so closely carryed betweene them, but the vigilancie of Don Pedro (whose affecton and care aymes to give Monfredo and his Sister content) hath perfect notice and intelligence hereof, the which for a time hee holds fit to conceale from them both; when firmely purposing to prevent it, and so to crosse his Mother and Brother, who herein delight and glory to crosse him, hee bethinkes himselfe of an invention (worthy of himselfe) how and which way to effect it. Hee sends for Don Alonso Delrio to the Cordeliers Church, and there relates him the friendship he beares him, that hee will not see him runne himselfe into an errour in seeking his Sister Cecilliana in marriage, whom hee knowes he cannot possibly obtayne; Shee (to his knowledge) beeing already firmely contracted to Monfredo, notwithstanding all that his Mother and Brother Don Martino have sayd or can doe to the contrary. Delrio heartily thankes Don Pedro for the expression of this love to him, the which he affirmes he shall ever finde him ready both to deserve and requite; when measuring the time future by the present, and of Cecilliana's blooming youth by his weather-beaten and blasted age, hee vowes to Don Pedro , that hee will henceforth no more desire or seeke his Sister in marriage, nor yet speake with her, or come neere his Mother or Brother; so that businesse is for ever dashed, and receives an end, almost as soone as a beginning. The which Don Martino (out of his deepe reach and politicke pate) understanding, and knowing that this falling off of Delrio , from farther seeking his Sister in marriage, proceeded wholly from the secret underminig of his Brother Don Pedro , he is extreamly in choller against him for the same; and so (with more passion then discretion) goes and chargeth him herewith: Whereupon these two Brothers fall at great contention and variance, and many bitter words and outragious speeches here interchangeably passe betweene them, the repetition whereof I thinke good to bury in silence, because it matters not much to give it a place in this History; onely (to deale on generalls) I must say that Don Pedro was high, and Don Martino hot, and that the first spake not so much as hee dared, and the last dared not so much as hee spake. But this tongue combate of theirs was so violent and blusterous, as the issue thereof redounding to Don Pedro's glory and generosity, and to Don Martino's shame and basenesse, and Martino finding that he had more will then power to bee now revenged hereof on his brother, hee is inflamed with choller and revenge against him for the same, as consulting with Satan, not with God, hee is so revengefull and inhumane, as hee wisheth his sayd brother in heaven, and from thenceforth plotteth with himselfe how to finish it, reasoning thus uncharitably and damnably with himselfe; That hee being dead, and his sister pent and mewed up in a Nunnery, hee shall then bee sole heire and Lord to all the Lands and Estate which his Father left him. Thus in the heat of his choller, and the fumes of his revenge against his brother Don Pedro , hee repayres to his Mother, informes her how it is hee and his policie which hath beaten off Delrio from seeking his sister Cecilliana in marriage, and that through his close treacherous dealing, hee hath prevayled with him for ever to abandon her; yea, hee here leaves no invention unassayed to intense his mother against his brother, nor meanes unattempted to inflame her against his sister, by still putting her in minde of his rashnesse towards Delrio , and of her disobedience towards her selfe; and here (hee remembring his owne avaritious ends) doth againe modestly perswade, and then againe importunately pray his mother to constitute her to a Nunnery; whereunto (as we have formerly understood) hee knowes shee is already resolutely bent and resolved: When shee (being vanquished with her owne desires, and his importunity) promiseth him very shortly to effect it. But first shee sends for her Sonne Don Pedro , and in a language of thunder rebukes and checkes him for his double crime, in disswading Delrio from so suddainly forsaking his sister, and in perswading so strongly to affect Monfredo, adding withall, that notwithstanding his treachery and policie, and her ingratefull disobedience to her, shee is inviolably resolved shortly to send Monfredo to seeke another wife, and to give and betake her to no other Husband then a Nunnery. Don Pedro , holding it his duety to entertain this choller and these speeches of his mother rather with modesty then passion, returnes her this answer, that hee hath nor sayd, nor done any thing to Delrio , but what hee can well justifie with his obedience to her, and his honour to the whole world; that his affection to his sisters present content, and care of her future prosperity, makes him assume this beliefe and confidence, that Delrio is as unworthy of her, as shee worthily bestowed on Don Monfredo , and therefore that it is both pitty and shame, that the wealth of the first should bee preferred to the nobility and generosity of the second; hee prayes her to consider, that as Cecilliana is her daughter, so shee is his sister, and that hee is so well acquainted with her disposition and secrets, as not to dissemble her the truth, hee holds her farre more fit to make a Wife then a Nunne, and a Nunnery therefore (every way) to bee improper for her, and shee for it; that he is not ignorant that it is the policie, or rather the malice of his brother Don Martino , which hath wrought these false impressions in her beliefe against himselfe, and this her uncharitable resolution against his sister; for which base treachery and ingratitude of his, if hee thought him as worthy of his care, as hee knowes hee is of his scorne, hee would not faile to call him to a strict account for the same, but that Nature and Grace prescribe him contrary rules. Dona Catherina beeing farre more capable to distaste, then to relish this bold answer of her Sonne Don Pedro , and contenting her selfe to have now delivered him her minde and resolution at full, she leaves him, and findes out his brother Martino , to whom shee punctually relates what had past betweene her and his brother Don Pedro ; whereat hee is afresh so netled with choller, and inflamed with revenge against him, as what before hee hath desperately plotted and resolved against his life, hee now vowes and sweares shortly to execute, whereat his bloudy thoughts (without intermission) aime and tend, and next thereunto hee desires nothing so much, as to see his Sister made a vowed and vayled Sister. Whiles thus his mother and himself are deep in conference, and busie in consultation how to effect and compasse these their different designes, Don Pedro goes to his sister Cecilliana , findes out Monfredo , and to them both sincerely delivers what hath past betweene his mother, his brother, and himselfe, in their behalfes; yea, it is a jest (both worthy, and well beseeming his laughter) to see how betweene earnest and jest, hee tells his sister (in presence of her lover Monfredo ) that shee must shortly prepare her selfe for a Nunnery, for that their brother Don Martino hath decreed it, and their mother Dona Catherina sworne it: At this pleasant passage and conceipt of Don Pedro, Cecilliana cannot refraine from blushing, nor Monfredo from smiling: for looking each on other with the eyes of one and the same tender affection and constancie, hee smiles to see her blush, and shee againe blusheth to see him smile hereat, here shee tells her brother Don Pedro plainely, and her lover Monfredo pleasantly, that shee will deceive her mothers hopes, and her brother Don Martino's desires, in thinking to make her a cloystered Sister; when againe metamorphosing the snow-white lillies of her cheekes into blushing damask roses, shee with a modest pleasantnesse, directing her speech to Monfredo (who then lovingly led her in the Garden by her arme) tells him, that his house should bee the Nunnery, his armes the Cloyster, and himselfe the Saint, to whom (till death) shee was ready to profer up, and sacrifice both her affection and her selfe; that as shee did not hate, but love the profession of a Nunne in others, so for his sake shee could not love, but hate it in her selfe, adding withall, that for proofe and confirmation hereof (if it were his pleasure) shee was both ready and willing to put her selfe into his protection, and to repose her honour in the cofidence of his faithfull affection and integrity towards her. Monfredo first kissing her, then infinitely thankes her for this true demonstration of her deare and constant affection to him, when againe intermixing kisses with smiles, and smiles with kisses, hee sweares to her, in presence of God, and her brother Don Pedro , that if the Lady her mother wholly abandon her, or resolve to commit her to a Nunnery, he will receive and entertain her in his poore house with delight and joy, and preserve her honour equally with his owne life, and that in all things (as well for the time present, as the future) hee will steere his actions by the starre of her desire, and the compasse of her present brother Don Pedro's commands: for which free and faithfull courtesie of his, Cecilliana thankes him, and no lesse doth Don Pedro , who in requitall hereof makes him a generall and generous tender of his best power and service to act and consummate his desires; and so for that time, and with this resolution, they part each from other, leaving the progresse of their affections, and the successe thereof partly to time, but chiefely to God, whom they all religiously invocate to blesse their designes in hand. Leave wee them for a while, and come wee now againe (cursorily) to speake of their mother Dona Catherina , and of Don Martino their brother, who being the oracle from whom shee derives and directs all her resolutions, shee is still constant to her selfe, and therfore still vehemently bent against her son Don Pedro , her daughter Cecilliana and Monfredo , swearing both solemnely and seriously, that shee will rather dye, then live to see him her sonne in law: and yet whatsoever Don Martino doe say, or can alledge to her to the contrary, shee yet loves Don Alonso Delrio so well, and her daughter Cecilliana so dearely, that before she will attempt to cloyster her up in a Nunnery, shee hoping to reclayme him to affect her, and to revive his sute of marriage, doth by a Gentleman her servant send him this Letter.  my Daughter Cecilliana , whereof, before I am resolved by thee, I have many reasons to suspect and thinke, that it was as feigned, as thy promises and oaths pretended it to be fervent. Sure I am, that as Envie cannot eclipse the fame of her vertues towards the world, so Truth dare not contradict the sincerity of my well wishes and affection towards thee, in desiring to make thee her Husband, and her thy Wife. Her poore beauty (which thou so often sworest thy heart so dearely admired and adored) hath lost no part of its lustre, but is the same still; and so am I, who have ever wished, and ever will faithfully desire, that of all men of the world, thy selfe onely may live to injoy it. If thou thinke her affection bee bent any other way, thou dost her no right, but offer a palpable wrong to thine owne judgement, and to my knowledge: Or if thou imagine the Portion be too small, which I promised to give, and thou to receive with her in marriage, thou shalt command that augmentation from me, which none but thy selfe shall eyther have cause to request, or power to obtayne; yea, thou shalt finde, that for the finishing and consummating of so good a worke (which thou so much deservest, and I so much desire) I will willingly bee contented to inrich her fortunes with the impoverishing of mine owne. If thou send me thine Answer hereunto, I shall take it for an argument of thy unkindnesse: but if thou bring it thy selfe, I will esteeme it as one of thy true respects and affection to mee. Catherina.  Don Martino being solicited and charged by his Lady mother likewise to write effectually to Delrio to returne to seeke his sister Cecilliana in marriage, yet notwithstanding drawne thereunto for his owne covetous ends, secretly to desire and wish that hee might never marry her, but shee a Nunnery, hee therefore to that effect writes, and sends him a most dissembling and hypocriticall Letter by the same messenger, to accompany hers, but hee is so reserved and fine, as hee purposely conceales the sight and reading thereof from his mother. This Letter of his, which was a false and double as himselfe, reported this language:  therefore adventure thee this Letter, as desiring to know who or what hath so suddainly withdrawne thee, or thy affection from my Sister Cecilliana . Thou canst not bee ignorant of my hearty well-wishes and love to thee in obtayning her to thy wife; and yet it is not possible for thee to conceive, much lesse believe, the hundreth part of the bitter speeches, which I have beene inforced to receive and packe up, from her and my Brother Don Pedro , for desiring and wishing it. I know that inforced affections prove commonly more fatall then fortunate, and more ruinous then prosperous; therefore I am so farre from any more persuading thee to seeke her in marriage, that I leave each of you to your selves, and both unto God. And to the end thou mayst see how much the Lady my Mother affects thy sute, and distastes that of Monfredo to my sister, she upon thy forbearance and absence hath vowed unto God, that if thou bee not, hee shall not, but a Nunnery must bee her Husband. My Mother is desirous to see thee, and my selfe to speake with thee; but because Marriages ought first to bee made in Heaven, before consummated in Earth, therefore thou knowest farre better then my selfe, that in all actions (especially in Marriage) it is the duety of a Christian to wait on Gods secret Providence, and to attend his sacred pleasure with patience. Martino.  Delrio receives and reades these two Letters, and (consulting them with his judgement) findes that they looke two different wayes; for Dona Catherina the mother would marry her daughter to himselfe, but not to Monfredo , and her sonne Martino aymes and desireth to have her marryed to a Nunnery, and not to himselfe; wherein wealth and covetousnesse are the chiefest ends and ambition of them both, without having any respect to the young Ladies content, or regard to her satisfaction; and although the speech which Don Pedro delivered him in the Cordeliers (or Gray Friers) Church, have so much wrought with his affection, and so powerfully prevailed with his resolution, that hee will no farther seeke Cecilliana in marriage, yet in common courtesie and civility hee holds himselfe bound to answer their two Letters, the which hee doth, and returnes them by their owne messenger. That to the Lady Catherina had these words:  shall finde, that the affection which I intended the Lady Cecilliana your daughter was fervent, not feigned; and because you are desirous to know the reasons why I forbeare to seeke her in marriage, I can give you no other but this, that I know shee is too worthy to bee my wife, and believe that I am not worthy enough to bee her husband: so though envie should dare to bee so ignorant, yet it cannot possible bee so malicious, either to eclipse the lustre of her beauty, or the fame of her vertues, sith the one is so sweete a grace to the other, and both so precious ornaments to her selfe, that infinite others besides my selfe hold it as great a prophanenesse not to adore the last, as a happinesse to see and admire the first. For your affection in desiring my selfe hers, and shee mine in marriage, I can give you no other requitall but thankes for the present, and my prayers and service for the future. How your daughter hath, or will dispose of her affection, God and her selfe best know; and therefore I shall doe her right, and your knowledge and my judgement no wrong, rather to proclaime my ignorance, then my curiosity herein: but this I assure you, that if hers to mee had equallized mine to hers, I should then thankfully have taken, and joyfully received her with a farre lesse portion then you would have given mee with her. To your selfe I wish much prosperity, and to the Lady your daughter all happinesse. I must returne you this mine answer by mine owne servant, and whether you make it an argument of my unkindnesse, or affection, in pleasing your selfe, you shall no way displease mee. Delrio.  His Letter to Don Martino spake thus:  from any farther seeking thy sister Cecilliana in marriage; and because I know shee will acquaint thee therewith, therefore I hope they will suffise both for thee and her. I am as thankefull to thee for thy well wishes to have obtained her for my wife, as I grieve to understand that thou hast received any bitter speeches, either from her or thy brother don Pedro , for my sake. It rejoyceth mee to see thee of the opinion that inforced marriages prove commonly fatall and ruinous, in which beliefe and truth, if thou and thy mother persevere, I hope you will espouse your sister to don Monfredo , and not to a Nunnery, because (if I am not misinformed) her affections suggest and assure her, that shee shall receive as much content from the first, as misery from the second. As thy mother is desirous to see mee, so am I to serve her, and likewise thy selfe; and as thou writest religiously and truely, that Marriages should first bee made in heaven, ere solemnized in earth; so, doubtlesse, God hath reserved thy sister for a farre better husband then Delrio , and him for a farre worse wife then Cecilliana : And thus (as a Christian) I recommend her with zeale to the Providence, and my selfe with Patience to the Pleasure of Almighty God. Delrio.  When in regard of his former affection, and future respect, devoted to the beautie and vertues of Cecilliana , and seeing her selfe, her Mother and Brother Don Martino bent to dispose otherwise of her in marriage, he will yet be so jealous of her good, and so carefull of his owne honour and reputation, as hee holds himselfe obliged to take his leave of her by Letter, sith not in person, and so to recommend her and her good fortunes to God; the which he doth, and gives his Letter to the same bearer, but with a particular charge and secret instructions to deliver it very privately into the Lady Cecilliana hands, without the knowledge either of her mother or brother don Martino , which hee faithfully promised to performe: His said Letter to her was charged with these lines.  affection to don Monfredo , and your constant resolution to make him your husband, I held my selfe bound, out of due regard to you, and firme promise to him to surcease my sute to you, and (because the shortest errours are ever best) no more to strive to make impossibilities possible, in persevering to seeke you in marriage, whom I see (heaven and earth have conspired) another must obtaine and injoy: And when I looke from my age to your youth, and from that to Monfredo's , I am so farre from condemning your choyce, as I both approve and applaud it, praying you to bee as resolute in this confidence, as I am confident in this resolution, that my best prayers and wishes shall ever wish you the best prosperities. And to the end you may perceive that my former affection shall still resplend and shine to you in my future respect, I cannot, I will not conceale the knowledge of this truth from you, that by Letters which right now (by this bearer) I received from the Lady your mother, and brother don Martino , they have some exorbitant and irregular designe in contemplation, shortly to reduce into action, against the excellencie of your youth and beautie, and the sweetnesse of your content and tranquillity; which howsoever (to your selfe and the world) they seeme to shadow and overvaile with false colours, yet although they make religion the pretext, you (if you speedily prevent it not) will in the end finde that their malice to your lover Monfredo is the true and onely cause thereof. God hath indued you with a double happinesse, in giving you an excellent wit to second and imbellish your exquisite beauty, whereunto if in this businesse you take the advice of your best friend Monfredo , and follow that of your noble brother Don Pedro , you will then have no cause to doubt, but all the reasons of the world to assure your selfe that your affections and fortunes will in the end succeed according to my prayers, and your merits and expectation. Delrio.  The Messenger first publikely delivereth the two former Letters to his Lady Dona Catherina , and her sonne Don Martino , and then privately the other to the young Lady Cecilliana , according to his promise and Don Delrio's request: As for the mother she grieves to see that Delrio will not bee reclaymed, but hath quite forsaken her Daughter; But for her Sonne don Martino hee is exceeding joyfull hereof; for now he is confident, that (according to his plot) his mother upon Delrio's refusall, will (in meere malice to Monfredo ) assuredly commit his sister to a Nunnery: Thus if hee obtayne his ends and desires hee cares not who misse theirs. As for Cecilliana , shee doth not a little rejoyce at Delrio's Letter to her, and at his constant resolution to leave, and commit her to Monfredo ; yea shee reputes his advise to her concerning her mother, and her brother don Martino's intended discourtesie towards her to much respect and honour. She acquaints her brother don Pedro , and her Monfredo with this Letter of Delrio , who now plainely see their mother and brothers former resolution confirmed, in ayming and intending to make Cecilliana a holy Sister, whereat they againe laugh and jest at her, and shee to them, for in their hearts and thoughts they all know, and resolve to prevent it. But they cannot but highly approve of Delrio's noble respect and true discretion, in being so constant to give over his sute to her, and yet so courteous and honest towards them all in this his kind and respectfull Letter to Cecilliana ; the which above the other two, shee cheerefully receives, and joyfully welcomes, that shee resolves shee can (in honour) doe no lesse, then returne his complement, and answer his Letter with one of her owne to him, the which shee doth in these tearmes.  was the very truth and sincerity of those affections wherewith God hath inspired our hearts, and setled our resolutions each to other. As I was never doubtfull of your well-wishes and love, so now I am not a little thankefull to you for your deare respect towards mee, in approving my choyce, and in praying to God to make it prosperous, whereas the obstinacie of my Lady mother, and the malice of my brother don Martino (without ground or reason) affirme it must needes proove ruinous. I have heeretofore beene advertised, and no (by your care of mee, and respect to mee which clearely resplends and shines in your Letter) and fully confirmed that my said mother and brother have some undeserved designe against mee, and my content; and although my poore beauty and silly wit no way deserve those excellent prayses of your pen, yet my heart shall consult with don Pedro how to beare my selfe in this so weighty and important a businesse, whereon (although the cause be malice, and the pretext religion) I know depends either my future content or affliction, my happinesse or my misery, in the meane time I will pray for those who vitiously hate mee, and honour these who vertuously affect and honour mee. Of which last number, I ingenuously and gratefully acknowledge, that your generosity, not my merits, hath condignely made you one. Cecilliana.  When shee had dispatched this Letter to Delrio , then Monfredo by her consent, and the advice of her brother don Pedro , holds it very requisite now once againe to sound the affection, and to feele the pulse of their mother dona Catherina's resolution towards him, to see whether yea or no shee will please to give him her daughter in marriage; and it is agreed of all sides betweene them, that at the very time and houre which he goes there, that shee and her brother don Pedro will purposely absent themselves, and ride abroad in their Coach, to take the aire, which they doe: To this effect Monfredo takes his Coach, and goes directly to the Lady Catherina's house, and sends up his name to her, as desiring to have the honour to salute her, and kisse her hand; but shee is so inraged and transported with choller at his arrivall and message, as shee sends him downe a flat and peremptory denyall, that shee will not see him, and as formerly shee prayed, so now shee commands him to depart, and ever hereafter to forbeare her house. An answer so unkinde and uncivill, that Monfredo well knowes not whether hee have reason to digest it with more choller or laughter; so returning her answer by her Wayting- gentlewoman, that hee will obey her commands, and no more trouble either her house or her patience, yet that hee will still remaine her most humble servant, and although shee refuse to see him, that hee will ever pray for her long life and prosperity: don Martino is now at home, and laughs in his sleeve as a Gipsie, to see what brave entertainment his mother gives Monfredo , he expecteth also that hee should visite him, but because his mother's stomacke is so high, therefore his cannot descend so low, as owing him no such duety and service, and so takes Coach and away; and knowing where don Pedro and his Mistresse Cecilliana were, in the fields, hee drives away presently to them, and very pleasantly relates them the whole long storie of their mothers short entertainment to him, which administreth matter of laughter to them all, and farre the more, in regard neither of them expected lesse; so Monfredo staying an houre or two with them in the fields, and then bringing them to the gates of the City, they for that time take their leave each of other, and all appoynt to meet the next day after dinner, in the Garden of the Augustine Fryers , and there to provide and resolve for their affaires, against the discontent of their mother, and the malice of their brother don Martino . The next morning, the Lady Catherina (storming at Monfredo's yesterdayes presumption and boldnesse) sends for her daughter Cecilliana into the Garden to her, as being fully resolved to deale effectually with her for ever to forsake Monfredo , or if shee cannot, then to commit her to a Nunnery. Shee comes; when (in great privacie and efficacie) shee layes before her the poverty of Monfredo , the which shee affirmes will bring her to more misery then shee can expect or thinke of, or indeed which shee deserves, at least if shee bee not so wilfull to ruine her selfe and her fortunes, as shee is to preserve them. Cecilliana now seeing her mother bent to play her prize against the merits and honour of her Monfredo , and therefore against the content and felicity which shee expects to injoy by injoying him, shee no longer able to brooke or digest it, cuts her off with this reply, that (her duety excepted) it is in vaine for her, either to seeke to disparage Monfredo , or any way of the world to attempt to withdraw her affection from him, and therfore with much observance and respect prayes her to affect and honour him, if not for his owne sake, yet for hers. Her Lady mother weeps to see her daughter thus obstinate (shee might have sayd thus constant) in her affection to Monfredo , and therefore (with frownes in her lookes, and anger in her eyes) she thunders out a whole Catalogue of disprayses and recriminations against him; and because yet shee despayreth to prevaile with her hereby, shee now (thinking it high time) resolves to divert and change the streame of her affection from him to God, and so at last to mew and betake her to a Nunnery, whereon her desires and intentions have so long ruminated, and her wishes and vowes aymed at: to which end calming the stormes of her tongue, and composing her countenance to patience and piety, she with her best art and eloquence speakes to her thus; That in regard she will not accept of don Delrio for her husband, with whom shee might have injoyed prosperity, content, and glory, but will rather marry Monfredo , from whom she can, and must expect nothing but poverty, griefe, and repentance, shee therefore (out of her naturall regard of her, and tender affection to her) hath by the direction of God, bethought her selfe of a medium betweene both, which is to marry neither of them, but in a religious and sanctifyed way to espouse her selfe to God and his holy Church; when (thinking to have taken time by the forelocke) shee depainteth her the felicity and beatitude of a Nunnes profession and life, so pleasing to God and the World, to Heaven and Earth, to Angels and Men: When her daughter Cecilliana being tyred and discontented with this poore and ridiculous oration of hers, shee lifting up her eyes to Heaven, with a modest boldnesse, and yet with a bold truth, interrupts her mother thus, that God hath inspired her heart to affect Monfredo so deerely, and to love him so tenderly, as shee will rather content her selfe to beg with him, then to live with Delrio in the greatest prosperity which either this life or this world can afford her; that although shee had no bad opinion of Nunnes, yet that neither the constitution of her body, much lesse of her minde, was proper for a Nunnery, or a Nunnery for her; in which regard, shee had rather pray for them then with them, and honour then imitate them: when the Lady her mother, not able to containe her selfe in patience, much lesse in silence, at this audacity (and as shee thought) impiety of her daughter, she with much choller and spleene demands her a reason of these her exorbitant speeches. When her daughter no way dejecting her lookes to earth, but rather advancing and raysing them to heaven, requites her with this answer; That it is not the body, but the minde, not the flesh, but the soule, which is chiefly requisite and required to give our selves to God and his Church; that to throw, or (which is worse) to permit our selves to be throwne on the Church through any cause of constraint, or motion of distaste or discontent, is an act which savoureth more of prophanenesse then piety, and more of earth then heaven; that as Gods power, so his presence is not to bee confined or tyed to any place, for that his Centre is every where, and therefore his circumference no where; that God is in Æ gypt as well as in Palestyne or Hierusalem , and that heaven is as neere us, and wee heaven, in a Mansion house, as in a Monastery or Nunnery; that it is not the place which sanctifyeth the heart and soule, but they the place; and that Churches and Cloysters have no priviledge or power to keepe out sin, if we by our owne lively faith, and God by his all-saving grace doe not. Which speech of hers as soon as she had delivered, and seeing that the Lady her mother was more capable to answer her thereunto with silence then reason, she making her a low reverence, and craving her excuse, departs from her, and leaves her here alone in the Garden to her selfe and her Muses. Her mother having a little walked out her choller, in seeing her daughters firme resolution not to become a Nunne; shee leaves the garden and retires to her Chamber, where sending for her sonne Martino ; she relates him at full what conference had there past betweene his sister and her selfe, who likewise is so much perplexed and grieved hereat, as putting their heads and wits together, they within a day or two, vow to provide a remedy for this her obstinacie and wilfulnesse. As for Cecilliana shee likewise reports this verball conference, which had past betweene her mother and her selfe, to her brother Don Pedro , and Monfredo , when (according to promise) they met that afternoone in the Augustines garden, who exceedingly laugh thereat; and yet againe fearing lest the malice of their brother Don Martino towards them, mought cause his mother to use some violence or indurance to her, and so to make force extort that from her will, which faire meanes could not, they bid her to assume a good courage, and to be cheerefull and generous, promising her that if her mother attempted it, that Monfredo should steale her away by night, and that hee, as hee is don Pedro her brother, will assist her in her escape and flight; whereon they all resolve with hands, and conclude with kisses: Neither did their doubts prove vaine, or their feare and suspicion deceive them herein; for her incensed mother being resolute in her will, and wilfull in her obstinacie, to make her daughter a Nunne, shee shuts her up in her Chamber, makes it no lesse then her prison, and her brother don Martino her Guardian, or rather her Goaler. Poore Cecilliana now exceedingly weepes and grieves at this cruelty of her mother, and brother don Martino , which as yet her deare brother don Pedro cannot remedy, by perswading, or prevailing with them to release her; hee acquaints Monfredo herewith, and they both consulting, finde no better expedient to free her from this domesticall imprisonment, then counterfeitly to give her mother to understand and believe, that her daughter hath now changed her mind, and that (by Gods direction) shee is fully resolved to abandon Monfredo , and so to spend and end her dayes in a Nunnery; but contrariwise, they resolve to fetch her away by night, and without delay. Accordingly hereunto Cecilliana acts her part well, and pretends now to this spirituall will and resolution of her mother, sa before she was disobedient. Her mother infinitly rejoyceth at this her conversion, and no lesse (or rather more) doth her brother don Martino , who to fortifie and confirme her in this her religious resolution, they send some Friers and Nunnes to perswade her to appoynt the precise day for her entrance into this Holy house and Orders; which with her tongue shee doth, but in her heart resolves nothing lesse, or rather directly the contrary. The mother now acquaints both her sonnes with this resolution of their sister, which is the next Sunday to give her selfe to God and the Church, and to take holy Orders; when don Pedro purposely very artificially seemes as strongly to oppose, as his brother don Martino cheerefully approves thereof, now extolling her devotion and piety as farre as the Sky, if not many degrees beyond the Moone; so the day appoynted for her entrance and reception drawing neere, the Lady Abbesse is dealt with by her Mother, her Cell provided, her Spirituall apparell made, all her kinsfolkes and chiefe friends invited to a solemne Feast, to celebrate this our new Holy Sisters marriage to God and the Church. But whiles thus dona Catherina the mother, and don Martino her sonne are exceeding busie about the preparation and solemnity of this Spirituall businesse, don Pedro and Monfredo resolve to runne a contrary course, and so to steale away Cecilliana the very night before the prefixed day of her entrance into the Nunnery, as holding that Saturday night the fittest time and most voyd of all suspicion and feare, whereof (both by tongue and letter) they give her exact and curious notice; which striking infinite joy to her heart and thoughts, shee accordingly makes her selfe ready, packes up all her Iewells and Bracelets in a small Casket, and acquainting none of the world therewith, for that her brother don Pedro's chamber was next to hers, and hee as vigilant and watchfull as her selfe, for Monfredo's comming about midnight, which was the appoynted houre for his Rendevouz : when at last both their severall Watches (in their severall Chambers) assuring them that it was neere one of the clocke, it being the dead of the night, none of the house stirring, but all hushed up in silence, as if every thing seemed to conspire to her escape and flight; then, I say, don Pedro issues forth his Chamber to hers, where the doore being a little open, and her candle put out, hee findes his sister ready, when conducting her by the arme, they softly descend the stayres, and so to a Posterne doore of the Garden; where they finde Monfredo (joyfully ready to receive the Queene regent of his heart) assisted with two valiant confident Gentlemen his friends, who were well mounted on excellent horses with their swords and Pistolls, and for himselfe and her a Coach with sixe horses: When briefely passing over their Complements and congees each from other, they (with a world of thankes) leave don Pedro behinde them, and so away as swift as the winde, who seeing them gone, secretly and softly returnes to his Chamber and bed, silently shutting all the doores after him, whiles Monfredo with his other selfe and his two friends drive away to Valdebelle , a Mannor house of his some eight leagues from Burgos . Don Pedro lyes purposely long in his bed the next morning, thereby the better to colour out his ignorance and innocencie of his sisters Clandestine flight and escape: So his mother about five, or neere sixe of the clocke, sends Felicia her daughters Wayting-gentlewoman to her Chamber, to awake and apparell her, to receive many young Ladies and Gentlewomen, who were come to visit her, and to take their leaves of her before her entrie into Gods house: but Felicia speedily returnes to her with this unlookt-for answer; That her Ladies Chamber doore is fast locked, whereat shee hath many times call'd and knock'd aloud, but heares no speech. The mother is amazed hereat, and no lesse (rather more) is her sonne don Martino ; so they both run to her Chamber, and knocke and call aloud, but hearing no answer, they force open the doore, where they finde the nest, but the bird flowne away; whereat the mother infinitely weeps, and her sonne don Martino doth exceedingly rage and storme, at this their afront and scandall, he tells his mother he will ingage his life, that his brother don Pedro is accessary to his sister Cecilliana's flight, and gone with her; so they both run to his Chamber, but find him in his bed fast sleeping and snoring, as hee pretends and they believe: their outcries awake him; but they shall finde him as subtile and reserved in his policie towards them, as they were in their malice to his sister; so he heares their newes, puts on his apparell, seemes to bee all in fire and choller hereat, profereth his mother his best indeavours and power to recover his sister, and to revenge himselfe on the villaine who hath stolne her away. But his brother don Martino is so galled and netled at the escape of his sister, and these words of his brother, as hee tells him to his face, in presence of their mother, that his speeches and profers are counterfeit, and himselfe a dissembler, and that it is impossible but hee assisted and favoured her escape and departure; for which uncivill and foule language of one brother to another, don Pedro gives him the lye, and seconds it with a boxe on the eare, and then very cunningly betakes himselfe to consolate and comfort the Lady his mother, who is not a little grieved and angry at this her second affliction, and the more in regard hee did it in her presence; so don Pedro reconducting her to her Chamber, and leaving her weeping in company of many of their sorrowfull kinsfolkes and neighbours, hee then calls for his horse, and under colour to finde out his sister, hee rides to Valdebelle to her and Monfredo , stayes there some eight dayes, where being exceeding carefull of the preservation of his sisters honour and reputation, hee before his departure sees them solemnly but secretly marryed; where leaving them to their Nuptiall joyes, and pleasures, hee againe returnes to Burgos , and tells his Mother it is impossible for him to heare any newes of his sister. And now, what doth the returne, sight, and presence of don Pedro doe here in his mothers house at Burgos , but onely revive his brother don Martino's old malice, and new choller and revenge against him, for the lye and boxe on the eare, which hee so lately gave him? For the remembrance thereof so inflames his heart and thoughts against him, that hee forgetting his conscience and soule, yea heaven and God, as hee assumes and gives life to his former bloudy resolution to murther him, and thinkes no safer, nor surer way for him to effect it, then by poyson, that ingredient of hell, and drug of the Devill. But don Martino is resolve in his rage, and execrable in his bloudy malice and revenge against this his generous and noble brother don Pedro ; so (disdayning all thoughts of religion, and considerations of piety) he procureth a paire of poysoned perfumed Gloves, and treacherously insinuating them into his brothers hands and wearing, the fatall venom'd sent thereof in lesse then two dayes poisoneth him; so he is found dead in his bed: when don Martino , the more closely to overvaile this damnable fact of his, purposely gives it out, that it was an Impostume which broke within him, and so hee dyed suddainly thereof in his bed, there being no servant of his owne, nor none else that night neere him, or by him to assist him, and this report of his passeth currant with the world; so the Lady his mother and himselfe cause him to bee buryed with more silence then solemnity, and every way inferiour to his honourable birth and generous vertues, because shee still affected and loved don Martino farre better then him: so his death did not much afflict or grieve her, and farre lesse his brother don Martino . But for his sister Cecilliana , as soone as shee understood and heard hereof, shee is so appalled with griefe, and daunted with sorrow and despayre, that shee sends a world of sighes to heaven, and a deluge of teares to earth for the death of this her best and dearest brother. Her husband don Monfredo (for henceforth so wee must call him) likewise infinitely laments don Pedro's death, as having lost a constant friend, and a deare and incomparable brother in law in him; and yet all the meanes which hee can use to comfort this his sorrowfull wife, hath will, but not power enough to effect it; for still shee weepes and sobs, and still her heart and soule doe prompt and tell her, that it is one brother who hath killd another, and that her brother don Martino is infallibly the murtherer of his and her brother don Pedro ; but she hath onely presumption, no proofes for this her suspicion, and therefore shee leaves the detection and issue hereof to time, and to God. Now, by this time, wee must understand that dona Catherina hath perfect newes, that it is Monfredo who hath stolne away her daughter Cecilliana , and keepes her at his house of Valdebelle , in the Countrey, but as yet shee knowes not that hee hath marryed her; wherefore being desirous of her returne, not for any great affection which shee now bore her, but onely to accomplish her former desires, in frustrating her marriage with Monfredo , and in marrying her to a Nunnery, shee againe still provok'd and egg'd on by the advice of her sonne don Martino , sends him to Valdebelle to crave her of Monfredo , and so to perswade and hasten her returne to her to Burgos , but writes to neither of them. Don Martino arrives thither, and having delivered don Monfredo and his sister Cecilliana his mothers message for her returne to Burgos , hee then vainely presumes to speake thus to them from himselfe. Hee first sharpely rebukes her of folly, and disobedience, in flying away from his and her mother, and then (with more passion then iudgement) checkes him of dishonour to harbour and shelter her; that this was not the true and right way to make her his wife, but his strumpet, or at least to give the world just cause to thinke so; and if he intended to preserve her prosperity and honor, and not to ruine it, that hee should restore his mother her daughter, and himselfe his sister, and no longer retayne her; but speakes not a word of his brother don Pedro's death, much lesse makes any shadow to mourne, or shew to grieve or sorrow for it. His sister Cecilliana (at his first sight) is all in teares for the death of her brother don Pedro , and yet extreamly incens'd with him for these his base speeches towards her and her Monfredo , she once thought to have given him a hot and chollericke reply, but at last considering better with her selfe (as also to prevent Monfredo , whom she saw had an itching desire to fit him with his answer) she then in generall termes returnes him this short reply; That shee is now accomptable to none but to God for her actions, who best knowes her heart and resolutions, and therefore for her returne to her mother at Burgos , or her stay here at Valdebelle , shee wholly referres it to don Monfredo , whose will and pleasure therein shall assuredly bee hers, because shee hath, and still findes him to bee a worthy and honourable Gentleman: when (before shee conclude her speech to him) shee tells him, that shee thought his comming had beene to condole with her for the death of their brother Don Pedro , but that with griefe shee is now enforced to see the contrary, in regard his speeches and actions tend to afflict, not to comfort her, and rather to bee the argument of her mourning, than the cause of her consolation. But Monfredo being touched to the quicke, with these ignoble and base speeches of Don Martino , both to himselfe and Cecilliana , he is too generous long to digest them with silence, and therefore preferring his affection to her, before any other earthly respect, and her reputation and honour dearer than his life, hee composing his countenance to discontent and anger, returnes him this answere: That if any other man but himselfe, had given him the least part of those unworthy speeches, both against his honour, as also against that of his sister Cecilliana , his Rapier, not his tongue, should have answered him; That his affection and respects to her, are every way vertuous and honourable; and that shee is, and shall be more safer here in Valdebelle , than the life of his noble brother Don Pedro was in his mothers house at Burgos ; That as the young Ladie his sister is pleased to referre her stay or returne to him, so (reciprocally to requite her courtesie) doth hee to her; and for his part, hee is fully resolved not to perswade, much lesse to advise her to put her selfe either into her Mothers protection, or his courtesie; for that hee is fearefull, if not confident in this beliefe, that the one may proove pernitious, and the other fatall and ruinous to her. And so with cold entertainment, and short ceremonies, Don Martino is enforced to returne to Burgos to his Mother, without his Sister, where assoone as hee is arrived, hee tells his Mother of his Sister Cecilliana's constant resolution, from whence hee thinke; it impossible to draw or divert her, because he finds Monfredo of the same opinion: but whether hee have married her or no, hee knowes not, neither could he informe himselfe thereof. And here yet Don Martino is so cautious to his Mother, as he speakes not a word or syllable of any speech or mention they had of the death of his brother Don Pedro . But as soone as hee had left his Mother, and retyred himselfe to his chamber, then hee thinkes the more thereof; yea, then hee againe and againe remembers what dangerous speeches he publikely received from his Sister Cecilliana , and Monfredo , concerning that his sudden death, whereby they silently meant, and tacitely implied no lesse than murther; Wherefore hee is so hellish and bloudy minded, that hee resolves shortly to provide a playster for this sore; and hee knowes, that to make their tongues eternally silent, hee cannot better or safer performe it, than by murthering them, whereof hee sayes the reason is apparantly and pregnantly true: for as long as that suspition lives in them, hee therefore can never live in safetie, but in extreame danger himselfe. But because of the two, Monfredo seemed to intend and portend him the greatest choller, and the most inveterate rage, therefore (as a limbe of the Devill, or rather as a Devill incarnate himselfe) hee resolves to begin with Monfredo first, and as occasions and accidents shall present, then with his sister Cecilliana after, without ever having the grace to thinke of his Conscience or Soule, or of Heaven or Hell, or without once considering, that our owne malice and revenge doth more hurt us then our enemies; That anger is a short madnesse, and that it is a most assured happinesse for us rather to forget offences, than to revenge them; and which is more, that (in a manner) it is but right now that hee came from poysoning of his owne brother, whose innocent blood is yet hardly cold in his untimely grave, but still cries alowd for vengeance from Heaven on his head for that cruell and damnable fact. But this shame, this monster of nature, don Martino , who feares none lesse than God, and loves none more than the Devill, will not thus forsake his cruell malice, nor abandon his execrable revenge: but understanding that Monfredo sometimes (though secretly) leaves Valdebelle to see Burgos , hee hearkens out therefore for his next comming thither: when being assured that hee was now in the Citie, hee wayting for him as hee issued forth his house, which hee did betweene eleven and twelve at night, hee with his small Target, and darke Lanterne in his left hand, and his Rapier drawen in his right, runnes him twice thorow the body therewith, of which two mortall wounds he presently fell dead in the street, his misfortune being then so great, as hee had no Servant nor Friend present to assist him, and his feare and care of himselfe so small, as he was kill'd before he could see his enemie, or have the leasure to draw his sword in his owne defence and assistance; so fierce and suddaine was Martino's rage and malice, in murthering of this harmelesse and innocent Gentleman: the which assoone as hee had performed, hee secretly hies home to his Mothers house, and speedily betakes himselfe to his bed, where the Devill rocking him asleepe in securitie, hee as his infernall Agent, and bloody Factor, nothing cares what God or man can doe unto him. The next morning at breake of day, this breathlesse body of Don Monfredo is found in the street: so all Burgos resounds of this his lamentable murther, but no mortall eye hath seene, or tongue as yet can tell who the murtherer should bee. But God (in his divine Iustice, and for the exaltation of his sacred Glorie) will shortly bring both it and him to light, by an accident no lesse strange than remarkeable. Dona Catharina heares hereof, and is so farre from grieving, as shee rejoyceth thereat, no way doubting, but Monfredo being dead, shee with much facilitie (according to her desires and wishes) shall now of two resolutions, draw her Daughter Cecilliana to embrace and follow one; that is, either to marrie Delrio in earnest, or a Nunnery no more in jeast. The next day after Dinner, the Relation of this deplorable accident arrives to Valdebelle , and consequently to the knowledge of our Cecilliana , who so pitifully weepes and mournes thereat, as for meere griefe and sorrow shee teares her hayre, bolts her selfe into her Chamber, and there throwes her selfe downe on the floore, and neither can, nor will bee comforted, no, nor permit any one to administer it to her, or which is lesse, to see or speake with her. So although Monfredo's Kinsfolkes and friends doe infinitely lament this his unfortunate death, yet all their sighes and teares put together, are nothing in regard of those of his young wife, and now widdow Cecilliana , who (out of the immoderate excesse of this her anxietie, and affliction) is now become so reasonlesse, and desperate, that first the murther of her deare brother Don Pedro , and now this of her sweet Husband Monfredo , is both a griefe to her thoughts, and a torment to her heart and minde, yea to her very soule: For still shee remaines confident in this opinion, that her brother Don Martino is infallibly the murtherer of them both; and from this suspicion of hers, shee cannot, shee will not bee diverted; yea, her living affection to their dead memories, is so extreame and fervent, that to bee assured whether it bee him, or who else that have murthered them, it leades her minde to a resolution, to prove an Experiment, which though prophane curiositie in some persons sometimes seeme to allow and practise as tolerable, yet sacred Religion must and doth for ever both reject and contemne it as Diabolicall. Shee disguiseth her selfe in her apparell, and very early in the morning rides to one Alphonso Sanchez , a famous reputed Wizard or Sorcerer, who dwelt at Arena , some sixe leagues off from Valdebelle , and giving him the two pictures of her murthered Brother and Husband, as also a perfect note of their age, and horoscope of their Nativities, shee prayes him to discover and shew her in a Looking-glasse, the true pictures and representations of their murtherers; When to have him dispatch both it and her selfe the sooner, shee gives him tenne Duckets, upon the receipt whereof hee promiseth her his best Art and skill, makes her stay till almost darke night,  & then fooles her off with this flamme, That he hath effectually invocated and raised his Spirit, from whom hee could get no other answer, but that God for that time would not permit him to shew her these Murtherers pictures in a glasse; whereby this Wizard proving himselfe more a cheating knave than a Sorcerer, and more a true Impostor, than a Christian, hee herein makes a foole of this sorrowfull young Lady, in thinking to make her know that, which it is both a foule shame, and a shamefull ignorance for any Christian to be ignorant of, (to wit) That it is not the Devill, or his Agents, but only God, who (in his divine pleasure and providence) hath power to reveale Murthers, and Murtherers, both when, where, how, and by whom it seemes most agreeable and pleasing to his All-seeing, and sacred Majestie . Cecilliana returning home, more loaden with doubts than gold from this Monster of men, (because in effect hee makes it his profession to bee lesse a man than a devill) shee is ashamed of her ignorance and impietie herein, and (for meere griefe and sorrow) weepes, to see that the foundation of her faith should bee so weake and reeling, as not constantly to relye upon the providence and justice of God, but to repose her foolish curiositie and beliefe upon this prophane and sottish Sorcerer, for the detection of these Murthers. But leaving her for a while in her disconsolation and sorrow at Valdebelle , I come now to this wretched villain Don Martino her brother in Burgos , who having thus committed these two cruell and lamentable Murthers, doth for the first two or three moneths after put a cheerefull and frolike countenance thereon, thereby the more absolutely to betray, and bleare the eyes of the world, that the least sparke or shadow thereof should not diffuse or reflect on him. But here before I proceed further, the Reader is requested to observe this one remarkable circumstance of Gods Iustice and Providence, in detecting of Don Martino , to bee the sole Author, and Actor of these two unnaturall and deplorable Murthers. For as the Devill had made him so cautious in his malice, and subtill in his revenge, that hee imployed no other Minister, nor used no other agent or assistant herein but himselfe; so being deprived of any witnesse, either to accuse, or make him guiltie heereof; God (I say) out of the immensitie of his power, and profundity of his providence, will make himselfe to become a witnesse against himselfe, and wanting all other meanes, will make himselfe the onely meanes both to detect and destroy himselfe. The manner thus. As there is no felicitie to peace, so there is no felicitie or peace comparable to that of a quiet and innocent conscience; It is a precious Iewell of an inestimable value, and unparalelld price, yea, a continuall Feast, than which Heaven may, but Earth cannot afford us either a more rich or delitious: and the contrary it is, where the heart and conscience have made themselves guiltie of some foule  & enormous crimes, and especially of Murther, wherein we can never kill Man the creature, but we assuredly wound God the Creator: for then, as those, so this, (with lesse doubt and more assurance) gives in a heavy and bloody evidence against us, and which commonly produceth us these three woefull and lamentable effects, Dispaire, Horrour, Terrour ; the which wee shall now see verified and instanced in this bloody and miserable wretch, Don Martino , who (as I have formerly sayd) hath not fully past over the tearme of three moneths in externall mirth, jollitie, and braverie, thereby to cast a cheerefull countenance and varnish on those his bloody villanies, but God so distracted his wits  & senses, struck such astonishment to his thoughts, and amazement to his heart and Conscience, as it seemed to him, that (both by night and day) the ghosts of his harmelesse brother Don Pedro , and of innocent Don Monfredo still pursue him for revenge, and justice of these their murthers. And now his lookes are extravagant, fearefull, and ghastly, which are still the signes and symptomes either of a distempered braine, a polluted conscience and soule, or of both. Hee knowes not to whom, or where, or where not to goe for remedy herein, but still his heart is in a mutinie and rebellion with his Conscience, and both of them against God. He is afraid of every creature he sees, and likewise of those who see him not. If he looke backe, and perceive any one to runne behinde him, he thinkes 'tis a Sergeant come to arrest him; and if he chance to behold any Gentleman in a scarlet cloake comming towards him, he verily beleeves  & feares 'tis a Iudge in his scarlet Robes to arraigne and condemne him. He hath not the grace to go into a Church, nor the boldnesse to looke up to the Tower therof, for feare lest the one swallow him up alive, and the other fall on him, and crush him to death: If hee walke in any woods, fields, or gardens, and see but a leafe wagge, or a bird stirre, hee is of opinion there some furies or executioners come to torment him; or doth he heare any Dog howle, Cat crie, or Owle whoot, or screech, he is thereat so suddenly appalled and amazed, as hee thinkes it to bee the voyce of the Devill, who is come to fetch him away. Hee will not passe over any bridge, brooke, or River, for feare of drowning, nor over any planke, gate, or style, lest hee should breake his necke. The sight of his shadow is a corosive to his heart, and a Panique terrour to his thoughts, because he both thinkes and beleeves, that it is not his owne, but the hang-mans, and when any one (out of charitie or pitie) come to see and visite him, hee flyes from them, as if Hell were at his backe, and the Devill at his heeles. The very sight of a Rapier, stabs him at his heart, and the bare thought, or name of Poyson, seemes to infect and kill his soule; and yet miserable wretch and miscreant that he is, all this while he hath not the goodnesse to looke downe into his heart and Conscience with contrition, nor the grace to looke up to Heaven and to God with repentance. The Lady Catherina his Mother is wonderfully perplexed and grieved hereat, and so are all his kinsfolkes and friends in and about Burgos , who cause some excellent Physicians and Divines to deale with him, about administring him the meanes to cure him of this his lunacie and distraction. But God will not permit, that either the skilfull Art of those, or the powerfull perswasions of these doe as yet prevaile with him, or performe it. Two Moones have fully finished their Celestiall course, whiles thus his phrensie and madnesse possesseth him; and in one of the greatest, and most outragious fits therof, hee (without wit, or guide) runnes to Saint Sebastiano's Church, finds out Father Thomas his Confessor, and in private and serious confession, reveales him, how he hath poysoned his brother Don Pedro , and also murthered Don Monfredo ; adding withall, that God (out of his indulgent mercie) would no longer permit him to charge his soule with the concealing thereof, and then beggs his absolution, and remission for the same. His Confessor (being a religious Church-man) much lamenting, and wondring at the foulnesse of these his (Penitents) two bloody facts; although hee finde more difficultie than reason to grant his desire, yet enquiring of him, if there were any other accessary with him in these murthers, and Don Martino freely and firmely acknowledging to him there was none, but the Devill and himselfe: hee (after a serious checke, and religious repremendo ) in hope of his future contrition and repentance, gives him a sharpe and severe penance (though no way answerable to his crimes) and so absolves him; and yet for the space of at least a whole moneth after, his lunacie (by the permission of God) still followes him, when (for a further triall of his comportment, and hope of his repentance) God is againe pleased to slacke the hand of his judgement, and so frees him from his madnesse and distraction, to see whether he will prove Gold or Drosse, a Christian or a Devill. Not long after this, his Confessor Father Thomas (being Curate of one of the neighbouring parishes) falls extreame sicke of a Plurisie, and so dangerously sicke, that his Physician (despairing of his life) bids him prepare his body for death, and his soule for Heaven, and God: Who then revoking to minde (what hee hath heard and seene) how grievously and sorrowfully the Lady Cecilliana takes the Deaths of her Brother and Husband, and the more, in that she is ignorant who are their Murtherers, he is no longer resolved to burthen his conscience and soule with concealing thereof; but to write it to her in a Letter, the which he chargeth and conjureth his owne Sister Cyrilla to deliver into her owne hands, some three dayes after his buriall; the which we shall see her shortly performe: for the Priest Father Thomas , her brother, lived not three weekes after. In the meane time, come we to the Lady Dona Catherina , the Mother, who having outwardly wept for the death of her eldest Sonne Don Pedro , for the disobedient flight and clandestine Marriage of her Daughter Cecilliana to Monfredo , who is now murthered, but by whom shee knowes not, and seeing her sayd Daughter thereby made a sorrowfull Widdow, shee (as an indulgent and kinde Mother) forgetting what she had formerly done and beene, and now desirous to comfort her, and to bee comforted of her, againe sends her sonne Don Martino to Valdebelle , to sollicite his Sister to returne, and to live with her in Burgos : Who (detesting this project and resolution of his Mother) is very sorrowfull thereat; but seeing that shee will be obeyed; he rides over to Valdebelle , to his Sister, and there delivereth his Mothers will and message to her; but in such faint and cold tearmes, as shee thereby knowes, hee is farre more desirous of her absence than her presence, and of her stay, than her returne; yea (and to write the truth of her minde) his very sight strikes such flames of feare into her heart, and of suspicion into her thoughts, that shee still assumes and retaines her old opinion and confidence, that hee is the absolute Murtherer of her brother Don Pedro , and her husband Don Monfredo ; but herein shee now holds it discretion to conceale her selfe to her selfe, and so gives him kinde and respective entertainment; shee prayes him to report her humble duety to her Mother, that she will consider of her request, and either send or bring her her resolution shortly: but inwardly in her heart and soule, she intends nothing lesse, than either to hazard her content upon the discontent of her Mother, or (which is worse) her life on the inveterate malice of her brother Don Martino . And now we approch and draw neere, to see the judgements and justice of God overtake this our wretched Don Martino , for these his two most lamentable and bloudy Murthers. And now his sacred Majestie is fully resolved to detect them, and his Arrow is bent, and Sword whetted, to punish him for the same; for wee must understand that the very same day which her brother Don Martino was last with her at Valdebelle , his Confessor Father Thomas dyed; and some three dayes after, his Sister Cyrilla (according to his dying order) rides over to the Lady Cecilliana , and delivereth her the Priest her brothers Letter; at the receipt whereof, Cecilliana findes different emotions in her heart, and passions in her minde: when going into the next roome, she breaks up the seales, and finds therein these Lines.  sacred than those of Earth, as I now lye on my Death-bed, ready to leave this life, and to flie into the Armes of my Saviour and Redeemer Christ Iesus, I could not goe to my Grave in peace, before I had signifyed unto thee, that very lately thy brother Don Martino in Saint Honoria's Church, delivered unto me in confession, That he had first poysoned thy brother Don Pedro with a paire of perfumed Gloves, and then after murthered thy husband Don Monfredo with his Rapier in Burgos : And although I must and doe acknowledge that he was in his Fit of Lunacie and Madnes, when he thus made himselfe a witnes against himselfe hereof, yet no doubt the immediat finger and providence of God led him to this resolution, as an act which infinitly tends to his sacred Honor and Glory. I send thee this Letter by my Sister Cyrilla , whom I have strictly charged to deliver it to thee three dayes after my buriall, because I hold it most consonant to my Profession and Order, that not my Life, but my Death should herein violate the seale of Confession; and thou shalt shew thy selfe a most religious and Christian Lady, if thou make this use hereof, that it is not my selfe, but God who sends thee this Newes by mee. Father Thomas.  Cecilliana having o're-read this Letter, and therein understood and found out that her brother Don Martino is the cruell Murtherer, both of her brother Don Pedro , and her husband Don Monfredo , her griefe thereat doth so farre o'resway her reason, and her malice and revenge her religion, as once shee is of the minde to murther him with her owne hand, in requitall hereof; but then againe strangling that bloudy thought in its conception, shee vowes, that if not by her owne hand, he shall yet infallibly dye by the hand of the common Executioner: When Love, Pitty, Nature, Reason, Griefe, Sorrow, Rage, and Revenge, acting their severall parts upon the Stage of her heart, shee findes a great combate in her heart, and reluctancie in her soule, what, or what not to doe herein; when with many teares and prayers (by the Advice and Counsell of God) shee enters into this consultation hereon with her selfe. Ahlas, unfortunate and sorrowfull Cecilliana ! It is upon no light presumption, or triviall circumstances, that I believe my brother Martino to be the inhumane murtherer of my brother Don Pedro , and husband Monfredo ; for besides that God ever prompted my heart, and whispered my soule that this was true, yet now here is his owne Confession to his Ghostly father, and his Ghostly Fathers owne Letter and Confession to mee, to the same effect, Evidences and Witnesses, without exception, as cleere as noone day, and as bright as the Sunne in his hottest and brightest Meridian, that hee, and onely he, was the Murtherer of them both: but Oh poore Cecilliana (quoth shee) to what a miserable estate and perplexity hath these his bloudy facts and crimes now reduced mee! for he hath murthered my brother and husband, shall I then permit him to live; but withall, he is likewise my brother, and shall I then cause him to dye? True it is, I cannot recall their lives, but it is likewise as true that I may prevent his death, for as the first lay not in my power to remedie, yet all the world knowes, that the second meerely depends of my pity, courtesie, and compassion to prevent: but Ahlas (saith she) the tyes of heaven are, and ought to be infinitly more strong than those of earth; and the glory of God to be far preferred before all our naturall affections and obligations to our best Friends, or neerest or dearest Kinsfolkes whosoever. Therefore, as to detect these Murthers of his, thou art no friend to Nature, so againe, to conceale them, thou thereby makest thy selfe an enemy to Grace; for assure thy selfe, unfortunate Cecilliana , that God will never bee appeased, nor Iustice satisfyed, untill their innocent blood be expiated, and washed away in his, who is guilty thereof; because, as by detecting Murther, wee blesse and glorifie God, so by concealing it, we heap a fatall Anathema , and curse upon our own heads. As Clouds are dissapated, and blowne away, when the Sun ariseth, and mounteth in his Verticall lustre and glory, so Cecilliana having thus ended her consultation with her selfe, and now began her resolution with God, she leaves Valdebelle , takes her Coach, and dispeeds away to Burgos ; where, in steed of going to her Lady Mother's, shee goes directly to the Corrigador's (or Criminall Iudges) of that Citie, and with much griefe and sorrow (her teares interrupting her sighes, and her sighes her teares) before them accuseth her brother Don Martino to bee the bloudy murtherer of her brother Don Pedro , and her husband Don Monfredo ; and for proofe of this truth, produceth the Letter of Father Thomas his Confessor. The Iudges reade it, and are astonished with this report of hers, and farre the more, in regard they here see a Sister call the life of her owne Brother in question; but they see that shee hath as much right and reason for her Accusation, as her inhumane brother Don Martino wanted for his Malice, in making himselfe guilty of these foule and bloudy Crimes: Wherefore attributing it wholly to the pleasure and providence of God, they highly extoll her piety and integrity towards his sacred Majestie, in preferring his Glorie before the Scandall and Misery of her so wretched and execrable brother; and then (out of then zeale and honour to Iustice) they (to evince and vindicate the truth of this lamentable businesse) send away for Cyrilla , and (as soone as she came) upon her Oath propose her these three Questions; First, whether she had this very Letter from her deceased brother Father Thomas his owne hand, and that hee gave her order and charge to deliver it to the Lady Cecilliana , three dayes after his decease? Secondly, if it were of his owne writing and sealing? And thirdly, if shee with her owne hands delivered this Letter to the Lady Cecilliana ? To all which three Questions, Cyrilla (with a stayd looke and countenance) answereth affirmatively, and thereupon (with haste and secrecie) grant out a Warrant to apprehend Don Martino , when hee was as it were drowned in voluptuousnesse, security, and impenitencie, as making it his vainglory to build Castles of content in the aire, and to erect Mouutains of wealth and preferment in the Viopia of his ambitious desires and wishes, without ever having the grace, either to thinke of his former horrible Crimes, or future punishment in the same. Hee is amazed at his Apprehension by the Sergeants, but farre more, at the sight and presence of the Criminall Iudges, before whom hee is now brought. They sharpely accuse him of these two aforesayd foule Murthers, and for evidence, and witnesses, produce him his Confessor Father Thomas his Letter, his sister Cyrilla , and his owne sister the Lady Cecilliana ; at the sight and knowledge whereof, hee at first seemed to bee much appalled and daunted, but at last recollecting his spirits (taking counfest of the Devill, and not of God) assumes a bold countenance, puts himselfe and his tongue on the poynts of denyall and justification, and so to his Iudges tearmes his Confessor a devill, and no man, and Cyrilla and his Sister Cecilliana witches, and no women, so unjustly and falsely to accuse him of these foule Murthers, whereof he affirmes not onely the act, but the very fame and thought is odious and execrable to him. But God will not be mocked, not his Iudges deluded with this his Apologie: So they adjudge him to the Racke; the first tortures whereof, hee indureth with an admirable fortitude and patience, but the second hee cannot; but then and there confesseth himselfe to be guilty, and the sole Authour and Actour of both these deplorable Murthers: but yet his heart and soule is still so obdurated by the Devil, as he hath neither the will to be sorrowfull, nor the grace to be repentant for the same. For Expiation of which his inhumane and bloudy Crimes, his Iudges condemne him to be hanged, and his Right hand to bee first cut off and burnt the next morning, at the Common place of Execution, notwithstanding that his afflicted and sorrowfull Mother (out of the naturall and tender affection which she bore him) imployed all her friends and possible power, yea and offered all her owne estate and Landes to save his life; but shee could not prevaile or obtaine it. So the next morning, (in obedience to this his Sentence) this Monster of Nature Don Martino is brought to the Common place of Execution, to take his last farewel of this life, and this world: Hee was clad in a blacke Silke Grograine Sute, with a faire white Ruffe about his necke, and a blacke Beaver Hat on his head, which hee drew downe before his eyes, that hee might neither see, nor be seene of that great concourse of people there present, who came to see him conclude the last Scene and Catastrophe of his life; When after his Right hand was cut off and burnt, which held the Rapier, whereby he murthered Don Monfredo , he then ascended the Ladder: Where the Spectators expecting some repentant and religious Speech from him before his death, he resembling himselfe (I meane, rather an Atheist than a Christian, and rather a Devill than a Man) as he lived, so hee would dye, a prophane and gracelesse Villaine; for some speeches he (betwixt his teeth) mumbled to himselfe, but spake not one word that could be heard or understood of any one: and so most resolutely hee himselfe putting the Roape about his necke (although all the people, and especially two Friers neere him, cryed to him to the contrary) he saved the Hangman his labour, and so (with more haste and desperation then repentance) he cast himselfe off the Ladder, and was hanged. And thus was the bloudy life and deserved death of this Hell hound and limbe of the Devill, Don Martino , and in this sort and manner did the just revenge of God triumph ore his foule and bloudy Crimes; which, may all true Christians reade to Gods glory, and to the instruction of their own soules. And, if the curiosity of the Reader make him farther desirous to know what became of the old Lady Catherina the Mother, and of Dona Cecilliana the Daughter, after all these their dismall and disastrous Accidents, I thought good (by the way of a Postscript) briefely to adde this for his satisfaction: That the Mother lived not long after, but her Daughter was first reconciled to her, and shee to her Daughter; to whom shee (having no other child) left all her whole Estate; And for her, who was now become likewise very rich, as having a faire yearely Revennue and Ioynture out of her deceased husband Don Monfredo's Lands and Meanes, although she were again sought in Marriage by some noble Gallants of Castile and Burgos , yet shee resolved never to marry more; and as I have within these very few yeares understood, shee then lived sometimes at Burgos , and somtimes at Valdebelle , in great Pompe and Felicity. GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND EXECRABLE Sinne of Murther .  Alphonso poysoneth his owne Mother Sophia , and after shoots and kils Cassino (as he was walking in his Garden) with a short Musket (or Carabyne) from a Window. Hee is beheaded for these two murthers, then burnt, and his ashes throwne into the River.  called the Fortresse of Christian piety against the tentations of Sathan: so by the contrary wee expose and lay open our selves to the treacherous lures and malice of the Devill. For if by Faith wee doe not first beleeve, then pray unto God for our owne preservation, it will bee no hard matter for him to tempt us in our choller, to quarrell with our best friends, and in our malice and revenge to murther even our neerest and dearest Kindred. O Faith , the true foundation of our soveraigne felicitie! O Prayer , the sweet preservative, and sacred Manna of our soules, how blessed doe you make those who embrace and retaine you! and contrariwise, how miserable and wretched are they who contemne and reject you! Of which last number, this insuing Historie will produce us one, who (by his debauched life, and corrupt conversation) trampled those two heavenly Vertues and Graces under his feet, without thinking of God, or regarding, much lesse fearing his judgements: But how God (in the end) requited him for the same, this Historie will likewise shew us. May we therefore reade it to Gods glory, and to our owne instruction. Piedmont ) bordering neere to the Estate and Dutchy of Millan , there lately dwelt a rich Cannon of that Cathedrall Church, named Alosius Cassino , who had a daintie sweet young Gentlewoman to his Neece, named Dona Eleanora , whose mother (being sister to Cassino ) named Dona Isabella C aelia , lately died, and left this her onely daughter and child her heire, very rich both in demeanes and moneys, when her Vncle Cassino , being neerest her in blood, takes Eleanora and her Estate into his protection and hardship, and is as tender of her breeding and education, and as curious of her comportment and cariage, as if shee were his owne daughter; for there is no sweet qualitie, nor exquisite perfection requisite in a young Gentlewoman of her ranke and extraction, but he caused her to become, not superficiall, but artificiall therein, as in Dancing, Musicke, Singing, Painting, Writing, Needling, and the like, wherof all the Nobility and Gentry of Verceli take exact notice and knowledge; yea, her beautie grew up so deliciously with her yeares, that she was (and was justly) reputed to be the prime Flower and Phenix of the Citie. Cassino considering that his house was destitute of a Matron, to accompany and oversee this his Neece Eleanora , that his age was too Stoicall for her youth, and that his Ecclesiasticall profession and function called him often to preach and pray; hee therefore deeming it very unfit and unseemely (in the Interims of his absence) to leave her to her selfe, and to be ruled and governed by her owne fancy and pleasure, shee being now arrived to twelve yeares of age. He therefore provides her new apparell, and other pertinent necessaries, and giving her a wayting-mayd, and a man of his owne to attend her, hee sends her in his Coach to the Citie of Cassall , in the Marquisat of Montserrat , to the Lady Marguerita Sophia , a widdow Gentlewoman, left by her deceased husband but indifferently rich, but endowed with all those ornaments of Art and Honour, which made her famous, not onely in Piedmont and Lombardie , but also to all Italy ; and to her he therefore writes this ensuing Letter to accompany his Neece, and chargeth his man with the delivery thereof to her.  you my Neece Eleanora to Cassall , whom I heartily pray thee to use as thy daughter, and to command as thy Hand-maid. She hath no other Vncle but mee, nor I any other acquaintance but thy selfe, with whom I would entrust her for her Education, and recommend her for her Instruction. Shee is not inclined to any vice that I know of, except to those imperfections wherein her youth excuseth her ignorance, and it is both my order and charge to her, that she carefully and curiously adorne her selfe with vertues in thy example and imitation, without which the privileges of Nature and Fortune (as Beauty and Wealth) are but only obscure shadowes, and no true substances, because there is as much difference betwixt those and these, as betweene the puritie of the soule, and the corruption of the bodie, or betweene the dignitie and excellencie of Heaven, and the invaliditie and basenesse of Earth I am content to lend her to you for a few moneths, but doe infinitely desire to give her to thy Vertues for ever. In which my voluntary transaction and donation, thou wilt conferre much happinesse to her, and honour to mee, and consequently for ever bind both her Youth, and my Age to thee in a strict obligation of thanks and debt. What apparell, or other necessaries thou deemest her to want, thy will shall be mine. God ever blesse her in his feare, and you both to his glory. Cassino.  The Lady Sophia receives this sweet young Virgin with much content and joy, yea, shee sees her tender yeares already adorned with such excellent beautie, and that beautie with such exquisite vertues, that it breeds not only admiration, but affection in her towards her, whom shee entertaineth with much respect and care, as well for her owne sake, as also for her Vncle Cassino's , whose letter shee againe and againe reads over, highly applauding his vertuous and honourable care of this his Neece, whom in few yeares she hopes will prove a most accomplished  & gracious Gentlewoman ; when Cassino's Coach-man after a dayes stay, deeming it high time for him to returne to Verceli to his Master, he takes his leave of his young Mistris Elianora , who, out of her few yeares, and tender affection and dutie to her Vncle, with teares in her eyes, prayes him to remember her best service to him at his comming home; and the Lady Sophia by him likewise returnes and sends him this letter in answere of his.  me Eleanora , wherein you have given mee farre more honour than I deserve, though farre lesse than she meriteth, and who henceforth shall be as much my Daughter in affection, as shee is your Neece by Nature; and if I have any Art in Nature, or Iudgement in Inclinations, her vertues and beautie doe already anticipate her yeares; for as the one is emulous of Fame, and the other of Glory: so (as friendly Rivals, and yet honourable friends) they already seeme to strive and contend in her for supremacie: to the last of which (as being indeed the most precious and soveraigne) if my poore capacitie, or weake endeavors may adde any thing, I will esteeme it my ambition for your sake, and my felicitie for hers. But if you resolve not rather to give her to mee for some yeares, than to land her to mee for a few moneths, you will then kill my hopes in their buds, and my joyes in their blossomes, and so make me as unfortunate in her absence, as I shall bee happie in her sight and company. As for her Apparell, and other necessities, shee shall want nothing which is either fit for her to have, or you to give. Let your prayers to God ever desire, and follow her welfare, and then rest confident, that her prayers and mine shall never faile to wish you long life, and to implore all prosperitie for you. Sophia.  Cassino did well to place his young neece Eleanora with the Ladie Sophia , but ill in forgetting that she had a very debauched yong Gentleman to her sonne, named Seignior Alphonso , of some two and twentie yeares of age, who (to her griefe and shame) haunts her and her house as a ghost, makes himselfe the publike laughter and pitie of all the different humors of Cassall , yea the lewdnesse of his life, and the irregularitie of his conversation, and actions, hath reduced him to this fatall point of miserie, that he holds it a noble vertue in him, to precipitate himselfe and his reputation into base debts, vices, and company, making this his shame his glorie, and lewd vices his honour, till in the end not caring for the world, the world will not care for him, nor hee for himselfe, untill he have wholly lost himselfe in himselfe, without either desert, or hope ever to be found or recalled againe. But at last seeing so sweet a Beautie, and so rich an heire as Eleanora fallen into his mothers hands, and therefore he vainely thinkes into his; and hoping that her wealth shall redeeme his prodigalities, and revive his decayed Estate and Fortunes, he secretly courts her: but Eleanora (as young as shee is) sees his vices with disdaine, himselfe with contempt, and his affection to her with scorne. Hee is importunate in his sute, and shee perverse and obstinate in her deniall, but shee resolves to conceale it from all the world. As for Alphonso , hee (after some six moneths time) acquaints the Lady Sophia his mother herewith, and with his fervent desire and affection to marry Eleanora ; but shee chargeth him on her blessing, never to proceed any farther herein without her consent and order; and quoth shee, if here (in the presence of God and my selfe) thou wilt now sweare wholly to abandon all thy former vices, henceforth to bee absolutely led by my advice and counsell, and to steere all thy actions by the star of Honour, and the card of Vertue, then I will promise thee to use all my best endeavors, and possible power, both with Cassino , and Eleanora , to effect thy desires. Alphonso hereat (with much courtesie and humilitie) thanks his mother, and solemnly sweares to God and her, to performe all these poynts carefully and punctually; and to adde the more Religion and reverence to this oath, he doth it on his knees; and it is a wonderfull joy to her, to see that the fruits and effects thereof doe accordingly fall out and follow: for this her sonne Alphonso in a very few dayes, is become a new man, and shee (from her heart and soule) praiseth and glorifieth God for this his happy conversion: and if his mother Sophia bee glad heereof, no lesse is our sweet young Eleanora , for now hereby shee sees that shee is rid of her Sutor. Cassino comes over three severall times to Cassall to see his Neece. The Ladie Sophia gives him her best entertainment. Hee is wonderfull glad to see that shee hath imprinted such characters of vertue and honour in her; and during his stay there, Sophia chargeth her sonne Alphonso , not to speak or motion a word to Cassino , of this his affection to his young Neece Eleanora : so he beares himselfe exceeding modestly and respectively towards him, and for his mother, she holds it fit not as yet to breake or speak a word hereof to Cassino. Cassino (no way dreaming of their intents and desires towards his Neece) tells the Lady Sophia , he is infinitely joyfull to see that her sonne Alphonso proves Fame to bee no true, but a tarling goddesse in his condition, and conversation; whereat shee heartily thankes him: and thinking then (though reservedly and secretly) to take time and opportunity at advantage, shee leaves not a vertue of her sonnes either undisplayed, or unmagnified, but extols them all to the skie, and himselfe beyond the moone, and so leaves the remainder hereof to time, and the issue to God. But yet revolving and ruminating in her mind, how (in a faire and honorable way) to obtaine this rich and beautifull young prize for her sonne; and holding it discretion, not as yet either to motion or mention it to her, she secretly layes wait at Verceli to know when Cassino will have home his Neece, and so some three weekes before that time shee holds it fit to motion it to him by her Letter, which shee doth in these tearmes.  marry your Neece Eleanora , is now the sole cause and argument of this my letter to you, the which I had not attempted to write or send you, but that I know his love and zeale to her is as pure, as her beautie and vertues are excellent. He (without my privacie or knowledge) hath already metioned his sute to her, and as hee tells me, shee hath returned him her deniall instead of her consent, whereof I held my selfe bound to advertise you, because his ambition and mine herein is so honourable, as it shall goe hand in hand with your goodwill and approbation, but never without it, especially in regard you have pleased to recommend her to my charge and custody, wherein I faithfully promise you, nothing shall be designed or practised to the prejudice either of her honour, or your content. All the estate and meanes which I can give, or you require of me, to make my sonne a fit Husband for your Neece, I will freely and cheerefully depart with; and yet were I not fully and firmely assured, that he is now as deeply enamoured of vertue and goodnesse, as heretofore he was of their contraries, neither my tongue or pen had dared thus to have presented his sute to her acceptance, and your consideration. The joy and blessing of which marriage (if God in his secret and sacred providence resolve to make it a Marriage) will I hope in the end bee theirs, the honour mine, and the content your owne; wherein I request your Answere, and entreat you to remaine most confident, that both in this, and in all things else, Alphonso's will and resolution shall ever bee Sophia's , and hers Cassino's . Sophia.  Cassino , upon the receit and perusall of this Letter of the Lady Sophia , is not a little displeased, to see her ambition in desiring his Neece Eleanora for wife to her sonne Alphonso , and although he be formerly well acquainted with the weaknesse of the mothers estate, as also perfectly advertised of her sonnes debauched life, and corrupt and prodigall conversation, howsoever she pretend to put a vertuous glosie and colour hereon to the contrary, yet hee holds it discretion to seeme to bee ignorant of the one, and not to take notice of the other, but will frame his excuse to them herein, that he hath already disposed of his Neece, and that their motion to him for her came too late, when in heart resolving to make her preferment and fortunes more assured, and not so doubtfull; and to match her in a higher blood; and nobler family then that of theirs; hee yet in descretion and honour, knowing himselfe bound to answer the Lady Sophia's Letter, cals for pen and paper, and by her owne Servant and Messenger returnes his mind and resolution to her thus.  marriage, yet your rich deserts and resplendant merits, and your Sonne Alphonso's honourable affection and zeale to her (which every way exceeds her poore beauty and vertues) had infallibly made mee to grant her for his wife, which I am now enforced to deny, in regard I have already (by my promise) disposed and given her to another before your Letter came to my hands, and consequently before that motion of his arrived to my knowledge and understanding: For to me it would and should have beene both a sweet joy and a singular honour, to have seene your Sonne matched to my Neece in the lincks of Wedlocke. But God having otherwise decreed it; you have many reasons to rest confident, that your Sonne is reserved for her better, and shee promised to his inferiour; and therefore the freenesse of this your profered courtesie to her, and of your honourable respect and affection towards mee, shall for ever tye me to a thankefull acknowledgement and an immortall obligation; and I will make it my chiefest Felicity and Ambition, if (in requitall thereof) I may any way either serve you in your Sonne Alphonso or him in his Mother Sophia , of whose conversion to vertue, and propension to goodnesse, your Letter hath so firmely and joyfully assured mee, that the truth hereof will, I hope, hereafter prove his happinesse in your content and glory; the which my most Religious Prayers shall still desire of God, because he is your onely Child and Sonne by nature, and your selfe my most honourable friend, both by desert and purchase. Cassino.  Within three weekes after that Cassino had dispatched away this his Letter to the Lady Sophia , hee then (in contemplation and consideration of the debaushed life and corrupt prancks and vices of her Sonne Alphonso ) not thinking his Neece Eleanora to bee safe with her in Cassall , for feare lest her old wit, or his smooth tongue might peradventure too farre prevaile and worke upon her young yeares and indiscreet affection: hee therefore sends over his Coach, and one of his Servants to bring her home, and to the Lady Sophia writes this gratulatory Letter for her honourable education and entertainment.  contracted my Neece Eleanora to a husband, reason and religion, his request and my promise now require, that I take her from you in Cassall , to give her to him here in Vercely ; to which effect I here send my Coach and Servant to you for her, and desire you to returne her to mee with your best prayers, as I sent her to you with my best affection: and had not God now visited me with sicknesse, my resolution for her returne had not beene either so suddaine or so speedy. For your honourable care in adorning her few yeares with so many excellent vertues and sweet perfections, I know not how to deserve, much lesse how to requite, except in my Prayers and Orisons to God for his best favours and graces to you, and the best prosperities and honours to your Sonne: But if my age now cannot, I hope her youth hereafter will endeavour partly to free me of that debt, and to aquit her selfe of that strong obligation, till when as I will not faile to give it a place in my heart, so I am sure will not she likewise to allot it one in her remembrance: In which meane time, I forget not my chiefest respects first to your selfe, then to your Sonne. God give us all his Grace that wee may live and dye his Servants. Cassino.  Now as Cassino's first Letter to Sophia (wherein hee denied her Sonne to marry his Neece) exceedingly afflicted and discontented her, so this his second to her wherein he so suddainly sends for her away from her, doth extremely afflict and torment her, and not only her, but likewise her Sonne Alphonso , who is all in sorrow, all in griefe hereat: For now they feare that their hopes of this young Lady are frustrated, and shee according to her Vncles report in his Letter is contracted to some Gallant of Vercelly: When Alphonso againe laying before his Mother the fervencie of his affection to Eleanora , and representing unto her the extremity of the griefe and misery which her refusall of him, and his losse of her, will occasion him, he with sighs and teares againe and againe entreats his Mother to seeke out some cure for this his disconsolation, and that she will please once more to try her chiefest wits and invention to change Eleanora's refusall, and her Vncle Cassino's deniall of him to bee her husband; when at last his Mother being much moved and induced with these his sorrowfull passions and importunities, shee before her departure doth her selfe breake this motion for her Sonne to her, wherein her wit and age sets upon the innocencie and simplicitie of her youth, with the sweetest oratory and most delicious speeches and perswasions which possibly she could invent, but she finds her Art to be Ignorance, and her Eloquence Folly therein. For Eleanora is (as young as she is) deafe to her requests, and dumbe to her entreaties and perswasions; returning contempt to the first, and little deafnesse to the second, and disdaine to both; so as in detestation of his sute, and envie of his affection, shee will no more heare the Mother for her Sonnes sake, nor see the Sonne for his Mothers sake. When yet againe, although Sophia despaire of the Neece, yet shee will once more make farther triall of her Vnkle Cassino , flattering her selfe with this hope, and her hope with this conceit, that his pretence of precontracting her to another, mought bee but onely a policie of his, to try her Sonnes affection in his constancie towards his Neece, and her owne zeale in her perseverance thereof towards himselfe: When seeing Break-fast ended, the Coach prepared, and Eleanora ready to depart, shee betakes her to her Closset, where taking pen and paper, she hastily scribles out a few lines, and sealing up her Letter, delivereth it privately to Eleanora , whom shee secretly prayeth, and effectually conjureth to deliver it carefully to her Vncle Cassino at her comming to Vercelie , which this young Lady confidently promiseth her; when likewise taking her owne Coach, shee and her Sonne conduct her three or foure miles in her way, where the Mother with many sugred speeches and complements, and the Sonne with many amorous sighes, regards and kisses, take their leave of her, they returning to Cassall , and she driving away to her Vncle Cassino at Vercelie , who receives her with much joy, and welcomes her with infinit gladnesse and humanity; to whom she delivering the Lady Sophia's Letter, he hastily breaking up the seales thereof, finds therein this language.  now cals home your Neece from me, makes me againe double unfortunate: Neither doe I hold it your resolution, but rather your pleasure, or at least your policie, in thinking to make me beleeve you have formerly contracted her to another. I will not say but that she deserves my Sonnes betters in marriage; but thus much I will speake for him out of my knowledge of his affection, and confidence of his zeale towards her, that in heart and soule hee is a perfect honourer of her Vertues, and a true Admirer of her Beauty: Yea, and no way to exceed or stray from the truth, I have many pregnant reasons for this beliefe of mine, that he is a Servant to the first, and a Slave to the second, and that his flame is so fervent towards her, that he would thinke himselfe honoured to prostrate his life at her feet, and esteeme himselfe blessed to receive his Death at her commands. Thinke not then so slightly of him, who thinkes so seriously and sincerely of her; and this assure your selfe, that if you will give her to him in marriage, I will give nothing which I enjoyed the world from him. In obedience to your request and order: I now send you your Neece, and I am sure that her proficiencie, as her stay, hath bin so small with me in Cassall , as it neither deserves her debt, or your obligation, your requitall or her remembrance. My Sonne was desirous to have visited you with his Letter, but that I commanded his pen and resolution herein to silence: And notwithstanding all your prayers for his prosperity, I am assured he is more your reall Servant, then you as yet are his intended friend. God blesse your selfe and my Sonne, and your Neece and my selfe, and make us all the Lovers of his Grace, and the heires of his glory. Sophia.  Cassino upon the perusall of this Letter, perceiving that the Lady Sophia and her Sonne Alphonso , were so farre from giving over of their sute to his Neece Eleanora , as they now prosecuted it with more importunity and violence then before, hee not onely cals her respect toward him, but her discretion in her selfe likewise in question, to see that she is incredulous that he hath precontracted her, or that his former Letters to her in that behalfe are not worthy of her beliefe, and confidence: Whereupon being sensible of a kind of disrespect and wrong, whereof she had voluntarily made her selfe guilty towards him, in the passage of this busines, and absolutely refusing to hearken to, or to entertaine any other parley, and so to cast away his Neece on the vices and prodigalities of her Sonne, He arming his pen with Discontent and Choller, returnes her this peremptory answer, which he covenanteth and resolves with himselfe, shall be the very last that hee will either write or send to her in this nature.  have deemed my former Letters to you (in contracting my Neece) to bee currant, not counterfeit? yea, to bee the pure truth, and therefore no way my policie to informe you of the contrary; for such proceedings to any one, especially to your selfe (whom I so much respect for your Birth, and honour for your Vertues) are as unworthy of me, as I am and will be ignorant of them: As for your Sonne, his zeale to my Neece, or his affection to her service in the way of marriage, if it bee as pure and fervent as you affirme it, shee is the more bound to him; but I notwithstanding, the lesse to your selfe, in that you endeavour to make me an enemy to my selfe, and to mine owne honour, which next to my soule is the best part of my selfe, in perswading mee to take her from a Gentleman to whom (by faith and promise) I have solemnly given her; and as this was my first, so it shall be my last resolution and answer to you, which I assure you I write not slightly, but (to use your owne words) seriously and sincerely: Therefore I thanke you for imposing silence to your Sonnes pen; and if you will henceforth likewise prescribe the same Law to your owne herein, I will take it both for a courtesie and a respest from you, only in any other matter whatsoever that you shall thinke me capable to steed him or serve you, your will and pleasure shall be my Law, and your Letters shall receive many respects and kisses from me. I have received my Neece, and her tongue, and mine eye and eare informe me, how much we both are bound to you for your care, and her proficiencie in Cassall , the which my Age and her Touch will expose to Vsury before I have the honour to pay you the Principall, and she the Interest thereof. God ever blesse you, and your Sonne Alphonso , and give you no lesse Ioy and Honour of him, then I hope and desire to find in mine owne Neece Eleanora . Cassino.  The Lady Sophia grieves, and her Sonne Alphonso stormes at the receipt of this unkind Letter from Cassino , whereby they see their hopes of his Neece Eleanora reversed and frustrated; and although this his flat refusall made her of opinion no more to stirre or enter-meddle herein, yet (as Lovers are impatient of denials and delayes) some three weekes after, hee prayes his Mother to ride over to Vercelie , againe to prove Cassino , and likewise to (againe) motion and solicit it to Eleanora , hoping that her presence may purchase that which her Letters cannot procure, and he is very desirous and willing to accompany her him selfe. His Mother Sophia grants both his requests; they arrive to Vercelie , where the Mother courts the Vncle, and the Sonne the Neece; and although they find exceeding great Cheere and noble Entertainment, yet in the point of their busines, which is Alphonso's marriage to Eleanora , they find themselves lost, and their sute in vaine, and so they are enforced to returne to Cassall with their definitive sentence of deniall, which makes her bite the lip, and infinitly grieves and exasperates her Sonne; so now he againe casts off the Cloake of vertue, and farre worse then ever, flies to his old vices and sinnes, which his Mother with her sweet perswasions and remonstrances, can no longer retaine or conceale, especially from his Whoring and Drunkennesse: yea, and which is most lamentable and deplorable, hee will no longer serve God, either abroad or at home, for he forsakes the Church, and wholly abandoneth that sweet and Heavenly Vertue of Prayer, which is the spirituall food and life of the soule. His Mother Sophia exceedingly weeps and grieves hereat, but how to remedy it she knowes not: For his discontent hath made him so vicious, his vices so obstinate, and his obstinacie so outragious and violent, as his Mother surfets with his Love-sute to Eleanora , and will no more entermeddle with it. Hee prayes and reprayes her, to make one Iourney more for him to Vercelie , to see what alterations time may have wrought in the hearts of Cassino and Eleanora , but shee is as averse and wilfull, as he is obstinate and peremptory: and therefore constantly vowes, neither to write, nor ever to conferre more with them herein. But this resolute answer of the Mother breeds bad blood in the Sonne, yea it makes a Mutiny in his thoughts, a Civill warre in his heart, and a flat Rebellion in his resolutions against her for the same, to which the Devill (the Arch-enemy, and Incendiary of our soules) blowes the Coles. For he who heretofore looked on his Mother with obedience and affection, cannot (or at least will not) see her now but with contempt and malice; yea, hee is so devold of Grace, and so exempt of Goodnesse, that hee lookes from Charitie to wrath, from Religion to Revenge, from Heaven to Hell; and so resolves to murther her, thinking with himselfe, that if hee had once dispatcht her, he should then be sole Lord of all her wealth, and that then this his great and absolute estate would soone induce Cassino and Eleanora , to accept of his affection: But he reckons without his soule and without God, and therefore no marvell if these his bloody hopes deceive and betray him: his Religion and Conscience cannot prevaile with him, neither hath his Soule either grace or power enough to divert him from this fatall busines, and execrable resolution; for he will be so infernall a Monster of nature, as to act her death of whom he received his life. He consults with himselfe, and the Devill with him, whether hee should stab or poyson her, but he holds it farre more safe and lesse dangerous, to use the Drug then the Dagger, and so concludes upon poyson; to which end he being resolute in his rage, thus to make away his Mother, he as an execrable Villaine (or indeed rather as a Devill) provides himselfe of poyson, the which hee still carries about him, waiting for an opportunitie, to give an end to this deplorable busines, the which the Devill very shortly administreth him: The manner thus. This refusall of Cassino to her Sonne Alphonso , and his miserable relapse to whoredome, drunkennesse, and neglect of prayer, doth exceedingly distemper the Lady Sophia his Mothers spirits, and they her body, so that she is three dayes sicke of a Burning-feaver; when to allay the fervor of that unaccustomed heate, shee causeth some Almond-milke to bee made her, the which shee compoundeth with many coole herbes, and other wholesome Ingredients of that nature and quality, which she takes three times each day, morning, after dinner, and before shee goes to bed: So the third day of her sicknesse, walking in the afternoone in one of the shaddowed Allies of her Garden with her Sonne, and there with her best advice rectifying and directing his resolutions from Vice to Vertue, she is unexpectedly surprised with the Symptome of her Feaver, when sitting downe, and causing her waiting Maid to hold her head in one of the Arbours, she prayes her Sonne Alphonso to runne to her Chamber, and to bring her a small wicker Bottle of Almond milke, the which he doth; but bloody Villaine that he is, nothing can withhold him (but his heart being tempered with inhumanitie and crueltie) hee first poures in his poyson therein and then gives it her, who, good Lady, drinkes two great draughts thereof; when a sweat presently over spreading her face, and shee beginning to looke pale, he (as a wretched Hypocrite) makes a loud outcry from the Garden to the house, and calling there Servants to her assistance, hee likewise cals for a Chaire, so she is brought to her Chamber, and laid in her bed, and within few houres after (as a vertuous Lady and innocent Saint) she forsakes this life and this world for a better, and the ignorance of her Servants, and her bloody Sonne (drench'd as it were in the rivolets of his fained teares, together with his excessive lamentations) doe coffin her dead body up somewhat privately and speedily, so that there is no thought nor suspicion of poyson; and thus was the lamentable Murther, and deplorable end of this wise and religious Lady Sophia committed by her owne wretched and infernall Sonne. Now this Devill Alphonso (to set the better luster on his sorrowes, and the better varnish and colour on his mourning for the death of his Mother) gives her a stately Funerall, the pompe and cost whereof, not only equalized, but exceeded their ranke and quality: For he left no Gentleman, or Lady in or about Cassall uninvited to beat her buriall, and his Feast, and dighted himselfe and all his Kinsfolkes and Servants in mourning attire, thereby, the better to carry off the least reflexion or shaddow of suspicion from him of this his foule and inhumane Murther. The newes of the Lady Sophia's death, runs from Cassall to Vercelie , where Cassino and his Neece Eleanora understanding thereof, they both of them exceedingly lament and sorrow for it, in regard she was a very Honourable, Wise, and Religious Lady, and to whom the tender youth of Eleanora was infinitly beholding and indebted for many of her sweet vertues and perfections; so that as her Vncle honoured her, so this his Neece held her selfe bound to reverence her, as making her eminent and singular vertues, the mould and patterne whereon shee framed all her terrestriall comportments and actions, which in few moneths after were so many, and so excellent, that as she was knowne to bee one of the most beautifull, so shee was likewise justly reported to be one of the wisest young Ladies of all that Citie and Countrie, which together with her owne great Estate, as also that of her Vncle Cassino's , to the full enjoying whereof (in contemplation of her vertues and consanguinity) he had justly both designed and adopted her his sole heire; the which made her to be sought in marriage by divers young Gallants of very noble and chiefe houses; most whereof were superiour to Alphonso , both in blood and wealth. When her Vncle at last (with her owne free affection and consent) privately marries her to Signior Hieronymo Brasciano , a rich and brave young Gentleman of Vercelie , who was Nephew and Heire to the Bishop of that Citie; but he being likewise very young, the tendernesse of both their ages dispenced them from as yet lying together, and both the Bishop and her Vncle Cassino (for some important reasons best knowne to themselves) caused this their marriage as yet to bee concealed from all the world with great privacie and secrecie, hee for the most part living with the Bishop his Vncle at the Citie of Turin (which is the Court of the Duke of Savoy ) and she in Vercelie with her Vncle Cassino , only they visit each other with their Letters, which is all the familiarity that as yet they are permitted to reape and receive each of other. And here the true order of our History cals us againe, to speake of this degenerate and debaushed Gentleman Alphonso , who had no sooner embrued his guilty hands in the innocent blood of the Lady Sophia his Mother; but he then without any farther shew of sorrow, or sight or sense of repentance for the same, againe desperately abandoneth himselfe to all old vices and prodigalities, flaunting it out in brave apparell (for his mourning weeds he speedily cast off) and swimming as it were in the Vast Ocean of all his carnall delights, and worldly pleasures and sensualities, never thinking of Religion or Prayer, but passeth away whole dayes and nights, yea consumeth whole weekes and moneths in all licencious riots, and excessive prodigalities with his debaushed Companions and Strumpets, which began to drowne his Estate, and to devoure his Lands apace: and in the heate and ruffe of these his Ioviall follies, and exorbitant intemperancies, he bethinkes himselfe againe of the wealth and beauty of the young Lady Eleanora , and so (in the vanity of his conceits, and the imbecility of his judgement) flattering himselfe, that being now Lord of all his deceased Mothers lands and wealth, her Uncle Cassino could not refuse to give her him in marriage, not so much as once dreaming or remembring how plainely and peremptorily, both hee and she had formerly given him the repulse: To which effect hee dights himselfe and his Followers in exceeding rich apparell, and (with a traine too worthy of himselfe) he rides over to Vercelie , and there becomes a most importunate Sutor, both to Cassino and Eleanora , first seeking her, and then courting her Vncle for her: but all in vaine, for he puts him off with disrespect, and she rejects him with disdaine; and when yet they see that his importunacie herein passeth the bounds of reason, and exceedeth the limits of Discretion aud Civilitie, then Cassino tels him plainely that his Neece is married; and that therefore (in that consideration) hee forbids him his house and her company; which point of discourtesie (and as Alphonso termes it of dishonour) to him, he takes in so ill part from Cassino , that exchanging his reason into rage, and forgetting himselfe to bee a man, or which is more a Gentleman, or which is most of all a Christian, he againe strikes hands and agrees with the Devill, and for meere despight and rage vowes that hee will murther Cassino: The Devill making him strong in the vanity of this beliefe and confidence, that this speech and suggestion of his, that his Neece Eleanora is married, is but fabulous and false, and that if he were once dead, he could not impeach or hinder him from enjoying the faire and rich Eleanora to his wife, which is the same prodigious baite and lure whereby Sathan formerly drew, and betrayed him to poyson his Mother: the Devill still so closely over-vailing his conscience and soule, and so ecclipsing, and wincking his understanding and judgement, that as his hand so his heart is inured and obdurated to the effusion of innocent blood, and therefore he will not retire with grace, but onwards with impiety to the finishing of this cruell Murther of Cassino ; and although hee had an itching desire, and a hellish ambition likewise to effect it by poyson, yet in regard he was denied accesse to his house and company, as also for that he was unacquainted with any Apothecary or Physician of Vercelie , hee therefore resolves with the Devill to doe it by a Carabine, which many times by night hee wore and carried about him. There is nothing easier then to doe evill, and as it is the nature, so it is the policie of Sathan, as well to furnish us with the meanes, as the matter thereof: For when we cast our selves from Malice to Revenge, and from Revenge to Murther, he then makes us industrious, first in the contriving, and then in the execution thereof, but in the end God will so ordaine that this hellish policie shall turne to misery. Alphonso's malice against Cassino will give no peace to his thoughts, so he informes himselfe, that every morning and evening he is accustomed to walke alone in his Garden, for an houre or two in his spirituall meditations, and therefore hee thinkes this a fit place (from some adjacent house and window) to shoote at him; when being likewise assured, that there was a poor smal taverne (not much frequented with company) that lay some-what neere and commodious to Cassino's Garden, he resolves to make choise of that, and there to give end to this bloody busines, which his heart so much desireth, so abandoned by God, and guided and conducted by the Devill, he about sixe of the clocke in the evening rides thither, and tying up his horse to the doore, he in a disguised sute of apparell, pretending there to stay for a friend of his, which promised to come thither to meet him (and having purposely sent away his Servants before him to Cassall ) he goes up into the Chamber, cals for wine and something to eate, the better to favour and colour out his stay there, when bolting the Chamber doore to him, hee (putting aside the paper Casements, which they use in Italy to expell the fervencie of the Sunne) from thence (according to his former intelligence) plainely perceives Cassino walking in his Garden, with his Hat in one hand, and his Breviary (or Praier-booke) wherein he reads, in another, with the which hee was as busie with God in his meditations and devotions, as he was with the Devill, in charging his Carabine with a brace of bullets, and dressing of his fire locke, and priming of his powder touch-holl, when, without the least sparke of grace, or feare of God, or his punishments, hee lets fly at him; and the Devill had made him so expert a Marke-man, that as Cassino was safely comming on, walking towards the window, wherein he secretly and scelerously stood, both the bullets hit him right in the brest a little below the left pap, whereof this harmelesse and religious old Gentleman Cassino fell presently dead to the ground, and none being in the Garden with him (wherein I my selfe have since some times beene) I could not understand, that hee had the power or happinesse to speake a word: But wee shall see, that this his inhumane and bloody Murtherer, shall not goe farre before the judgements of God will surprise and ore take him. The manner whereof is thus. As soone as Alphonso had given this bloody blow, and seene Cassino fall dead to the ground, he unbolting the Chamber doore, presently resolves to take horse and fly away, but God ordained the contrary: For as hee had againe put up his Carabine into his Belt, God presently strucke him into a stupified swoone, whereof falling to the ground, the noyse of his fall, the report of his Carabine, and the ratling of his sword and it, presently invited the people of the house below, to see what had befallen above to this Gentleman, where finding him groveling and gasping for life, they (by Gods immediate direction) doe thinke that hee hath there shot and murthered himselfe; when devesting him of his apparell, and laying him in bed to search for his wounds, they find none; but yet it is an houre before they perceive any motion, or action of life in him: And then opening his eyes, he with a distracted looke and amazed countenance, deeming himselfe upon the very point of death; and that for his murthering of Cassino , the Lord in his judgement had infallibly strucken him with suddaine death, he finding this foule and bloody act of his, to lie heavie upon his soule and conscience, in this last Scene (as he then thought) of his life, he (rather raving then speaking) in the heate of his madnesse and distraction, cryes out againe and againe, that he had murthered Cassino: The which the people of the house are exceedingly astonished to understand. And now by this time Cassino is found dead in his Garden, and shot thorow with a brace of bullets. So his Neece Eleanora is all in teares hereat, and all Vercelie resounds of this his lamentable murther. When Cassino's friends and servants make speedy search for the Murtherer, and finding a horse tyed to this little Taverne doore, they find the Man, Wife, and Servants thereof in out-cryes and amazement: So they ascend the staires, find Alphonso in bed, with his Carabine by him on the bench, and his clothes on the Table, and examining the people of the house, they report to them this suddaine accident of his swooning, and therein of his confession of the murthering of Cassino ; so they all praise and glorifie God, in that they have so soone, and so readily found out the inhumane Authour, and Actor of this bloody Murther. But here before I proceed farther, I (in the name and feare of God) doe request and invite the Reader to take notice of another remarkeable (I may say miraculous) circumstance of Gods mercy and glory, which likewise appeares in this detection and confession of Alphonso , to be the cruell Murtherer of this innocent, harmelesse Gentleman Cassino ; for he being no better then distracted of his wits, before God had caused and brought him to confesse it, which else hee had never done, but that in the agonie and anxiety of his stupified spirits hee (as I have formerly said) thought himselfe on the point and brinke of death, and no shaddow of hope left him, either of this life or this world: Then I say, as soone as hee had confessed it, God in his good pleasure and providence presently restored him againe to his perfect health, strength, and memory; so that being put in mind, and againe remembring his confession, and seeing the eminencie of his danger by the presence of Cassino's friends and servants, who were there present about his bed, to apprehend and carry him away to prison for the same; he now with teares, and bitter oaths, and curses, declines and recants what he hath formerly spoken thereof, and, rather as a Devill then a Christian, in lofty and proud speeches stands upon the termes of his Iustification, alleadging and affirming to them farther that what he had formerly confessed, or said to them, concerning the Murther of Cassino , proceeded from the destemperature of his heart and braines, in that of his distraction, or else from the delusions and temptations of the Devill, and no otherwise. But his owne confession, the testimony of those of the house who heard it, and the rest of the presumptions and circumstances are so pregnant and apparant, that he is the undoubted Murtherer of Cassino , as they beleeve not what he now sayes in his owne behalfe and Apologie, or that it is any way the delusions of the Devill, but the good pleasure of God, which brought him to this detection and conviction of himselfe for the same: So they being deare to his requests and oathes, they enforce him to draw on his apparell, and then by order of the criminall Iudges, they that night commit him to prison, where the Devill having brought him, he now leaves him to himselfe, and to his owne misery and confusion, which it is to be beleeved, that the Lord hath ordained shall speedily befall him. The next morning this Monster of nature Alphonso , is called to his araignment, where being by his Iudges, charged with this foule Murther, the Devill hath as yet so obdurated his heart, as hee not onely denies it, but contests against it with vehemencie and execrations. So the Vintner and his wife, and servants, are produced against him as witnesses, who acknowledge and confesse his owne confession thereof, as also the report of his Carabine, and the vicinitie of their house, and prospect From the Chamber wherein hee was, to Cassino's Garden, wherein as he was walking he was shot to death. When the mournefull and sorrowfull young Lady Eleanora , is likewise brought forth as a witnesse against him, who informes his Iudges, that Alphonso was a most importunate Suter to her, both in his Mothers house at Cassall , as also at her deceased Vncles house, here in Vercelie ; adding withall, that (in her heart and soule) shee verely beleeves him to bee the Murtherer of her said Vncle. But still he denies it with choler and indignation: whereupon, the presumptions and circumstances hereof, being more apparant to his Iudges, then the knowledge of this truth, they adjudge him to the Racke, where at his very first torments thereof, he with teares confesseth it; and God is now so mercifull to his soule, as hee seemes to be very sorrowfull and repentant thereof: so they seeing him guilty, pronounce sentence against him, the next day to have his head cut off for the same; and that night the Iudges (out of their honourable zeale to charitie and pietie) send him some Friers to Prison to him, to direct his soule to Heaven; who willing him to disburthen his conscience and soule of any other capitall crime, which hee mought have committed in all the course of his life, to the end that it mought not hinder her passage and transmigration from Earth to Heaven; Hee then and there reveales them, how hee had also formerly poysoned his owne Mother, the Lady Sophia , at Cassall , for the which he likewise craved absolution both of them and of God. Whereat his Iudges are exceedingly amaz'd and astonished, to see a Gentleman so degenerate, inhumane and bloody, as to be the death of his owne Mother, of whom formerly hee had received his life. The day following (according to his sentence) Alphonso is brought to the place of execution, clad in a blacke sute of silke Grograine, and a falling band, where ascending the scaffold, and drawne to much humility and contrition, by his secular Priests and Friers, hee in presence of a great concourse of people, there made this short speech. That these two murthers of his, and especially that of his owne Mother, the Lady Sophia , were so odious in the sight of God and man, that he acknowledged, hee no longer deserved to tread on the face of the earth, or to looke up to Heaven. That he knew not justly, whereunto to attribute this infamy and misery of his, but to his continuall neglect and omission of prayer, whereby he banished himselfe from God, and thereby gave the Devill too great an interest over his body and soule; that he desired God to forgive him, these his two foule and bloody crimes of Murther, as also that of his neglect of Prayer; and so (with teares in his eyes) besought all who were there present, likewise to pray unto God for him: When againe beseeching the vertuous young Lady Eleanora , to forgive him the murther of her good old Vncle Cassino , hee often making the signe of the Crosse, and recommending himselfe into the hands of his Redeemer, bad the Executioner doe his office, who presently with his sword severed his head from his body, and both were immediatly burnt, and the ashes throwen into the River of Ticino , without the wals of Vercelie , although his Iudges were once of opinion, to send his said head and body to Cassall , for the Iudges of that place to doe their pleasure therewith, for there poysoning of his owne Mother, the Lady Sophia . And thus was the miserable (and yet deserved) death and end, of this bloody and execrable Gentleman Alphonso , and in this sort did the judgements and punishments of God befall him, for these his two most inhumane, and deplorable Murthers. May God of his infinit grace and mercie, still fortifie and confirme our faith by constant and continuall prayer (the want whereof was the fatall Rocke whereon hee perished) that so we may secure our selves in this world, and our soules in that to come.

But that this age of ours produceth such Monsters of nature, reade we but this ensuing Historie, and it will informe us of much innocent blood shed, we know not whether more wilfully or wickedly. since) annexed and united to the flourishing Kingdome of France , by the marriage of Charles the Eighth, with Anne the young Dutchesse thereof, notwithstanding that she were formerly contracted to Maximilian (Arch-duke of Austria ) where we shall understand, that in the Citie of Vannes (formerly the Court and Residence of those British Dukes) there of late yeares dwelt a noble Gentleman (of rich Demaines and Revenues) termed Monsieur de Caerstaing , who by his wife Mademoyselle de la Ville Blanche , had two Sonnes, the eldest named by his title Monsieur de Quatbrisson , and the youngest Monsieur de Valfontaine: The first aged of twenty foure yeares, being short and corpulent, the second of twentie, being tall and slender; both of them brave and hopefull Gentlemen, as well in their outward personages, as in the inward perfections, and endowments of their minds; For in all respects, the care and affection of their Parents, had made their education answerable to their births. Valfontaine (for the most part) lived in the Citie of Nantes (the second of that Dutchie) with an Vncle of his named Monsieur de Massie , being President of the Kings Chamber of Accounts which is kept there, who frequenting the Bals or publike Dancings (whereunto the youth of France are generally adicted) amongst many other excellent beauties, wherewith that Citie is graced, and those pastimes and meetings honoured, he sees a young Gentlewoman (being a stranger, and newly come to the Citie,) so infinitly rich in the excellencies of nature, and the treasure of lovelinesse and beauty, as (with a kind of imperious commanding power) shee atracts all mens eyes to behold, to admire, to affect her. So as although Valfontaines youthfull heart and yeares, had never as yet stooped or sacrificed to Love, yet at the very first sight of this sweet young Gentlewoman, (whose name wee shall not goe farre to know) hee cannot retaine his enamored eyes from gadding on the Roses, and ranging on the Lillies of her sweet complexion, nor his resolutions from enquiring, what her name and her selfe was; when being informed, that she was the onely daughter and heire of a rich and noble Gentleman, a Widdower termed Monsieur de Pennelle , of the Parish of Saint Aignaw , fower leagues from the Citie, and her name Madamoyselle la Pratiere , of the age of some seventeene, hee at the very first sight likes her so well, and loves her so deerely, that (if her interiour vertues come not too short of her exteriour beauty and feature) he vowes he will be her Sutor and Servant; and so he attempts to court and seeke her for his wife. To which end, he (more like a Tutor then a Pupill, in the Art and Schoole of love) is so farre from neglecting any, as he curiously and carefully seekes all opportunities and occasions to enjoy the felicity of her company, and so (for the most part) hee conducts her to and from the dauncings, sits and talkes with her in her lodgings, meets her at Church, where as well at Vespers as Masse, he accompanies and prayes with her, and (briefly) shee can difficultly be present any where, where he is long absent from her; For by this time (which is scarce a moneth since he first saw her) her peerelesse beauty, and unparalell'd vertues and discourse, have acted such amorous wonders in his heart, as hee vowes, hee must either live her Husband, or die her Martyr. But see the providence and pleasure of God, for if Valfontaine tenderly love our sweet and faire La Pratiere , no lesse doth shee him; for knowing him to be the Some of his Father, and therefore a Gentleman of noble extraction and worth; and seeing him to bee wise, discreet, and proper, as also remembring and marking, that he fervently and infinitly affects her, shee is so delighted with his near feature and personage, and ravished with the melodie of his discourse, as albeit at first, her tongue bee so civill and modest to conceale her affection from him, yet her eyes (the Ambassadors of her heart) cannot but in dumbe Eloquence, and silent Rhetorike bewray it him. So as (to omit the gifts, presents, and especially the letters, which interchangeably past betweene them) and which indeed powerfully assisted to the sympathising and cimenting of their youthfull affections, it sufficeth that we take notice and knowledge, that Valfontaines presence was La Pratiere's delight, and the enjoying of her company, his felicity and glory, and that she in life and death would remaine his obedient and faithfull Wife, and he her faithfull and loving Husband; Onely she prayes him, carefully and respectfully to conceale her affection to him, and so likewise to observe her Father in seeking his consent to their marriage, the which hee promiseth her shortly to performe; For as soone as La Pratiere hath left Nantes , and purposely retired her selfe home to her Fathers house, a Saint Aignaw, Valfontaine is not many dayes behind her, where hee acquaints her Father Pennelle , with his affection to his daughter, seekes her in marriage, requesteth his consent, and with many reasons, fairely and discreetly endeavoreth to induce him thereunto, where for three or foure dayes, hee takes up his lodging and residence, under pretence to court the Daughter, whom we know he hath already won, but his sute is no way pleasing, but distastfull to Pennelle , who although he know, that Monsieur de Caerstainge his Father (as well for lands as blood) is every way rather his Superiour then his Equall, yet because his Daughter La Pratiere is his only child and heire, and Valfontaine but a Cadet (or younger Brother) therefore covetousnesse makes him assume this resolution, that hee will have none of him for his Sonne in Law: but this reason, and conclusion hee conceales to himselfe, and so (in generall termes) gives Valfontaine a cold and averse answere, little better in effect then a flat deniall; and thus for his first Iourney, Valfontaine takes leave of his sweet La Pratiere , no way doubting but that his second to her, will prove lesse distastfull and more fortunate, he leaves Nantes and rides home to Vannes . Being arrived at Vannes , he acquaints his Father and Mother, with his affection and sute to Madamoyselle La Pratiere , the onely daughter and heire (as we have heard) of Monsieur de Pennelle , of Saint Aignaw , whereunto (because they know him to bee rich and noble, and his Daughter faire and vertuous) they give good approbation and allowance, when Valfontaine praying his Father to ride over to Monsieur de Pennelle , to conferre with him about this busines, whose presence hee hopeth will effect that with him, which hee feares and knowes his poore power cannot: But his Father although he be very glad, to procure his Sonnes advancement and content by this match, yet being at that time much troubled with the Gout, he excuseth himselfe upon his indisposition, and so defers off that Iourney to another time. Valfontaine missing of his Father, deemes it rather expedient then impertinent, to entreat his brother Quatbrisson herein, to whom hee fully relates what hath past betweene Pennelle and himselfe, but withall conceales upon what termes he stands with La Pratiere , or that she is any way his, or hee hers, either by contract or promise, to the end that he may have no just cause, either to taxe her immodesty, or condemne her indiscretion, in so suddainely giving her selfe to him. Quatbrisson very willingly yeelds to his brothers request; when (followed with a traine and equipage answerable to their rancke and quality, and armed with their Fathers Letter to Monsieur de Pennelle ) they take horse and ride to Saint-Aignaw . Now as it is the errour (or nature) of Lovers to be still unsecret Secretaries, in delighting to talke and pratle of their Mistresses, whom they esteeme their soveraigne good and chiefest felicity: So all the way, betweene Vannes , and Saint Aignaw, Valfontaine could neither refraine, nor restraine his tongue from painting forth La Pratiere in all the excellencie of her prayses, and from extolling her beauty and perfections above the skies; yea, he ran so curious a division, and so ample a comment on the wonders and raritie of her beauty, that his verball relation already prepared his Brothers eyes to behold a female Master-peece of nature in La Pratiere ; but being arrived to her Fathers house (a little before dinner time) and seeing, and saluting, first him, then her, at the very first encounter and sight, his senses are so surprised with the sweetnesse of her countenance, and so taken with she exquisitnesse of her feature, as he now finds that his brothers report and prayses of her come infinitly short the dignity and excellencie of her beauty. Dinner being ended, and Quatbrisson delivering his Fathers Letter to Pennelle , with whom making a slight and superficiall conference, concerning his brothers affection and sute to his Daughter, he turnes from him to her, who dying her milke white cheeks with a roseat blush to entertaine him, hee ravished with the delicacie of so amorous an encounter, and sweet object, could not likewise refraine from blushing to see her blush, when enquiring of her, if she pleased to take the aire of the Garden (where her Father and his Brother were already gone and attended them) and she replying, that his pleasure therein should be hers, hee taking her by her hand conducts her thither; where Valfontaine in civilitie purposely walking aloofe off, because he hoped and assured himselfe, that his brother Quatbrisson now meant effectually to speake with his Mistresse in his behalfe, there being then no witnesses to their conference, but only the sweet Quiresters of the woods (the Thrushes and Nightingales) who purposely and pleasantly sate on every bush and tree, to delight them with their melifluous melodie; the very first words he administred and directed to her was; That if shee pleased to sweare her tongue to secrecie, to what hee should now say and deliver to her, hee would reveale her a secret which should infinitly import her good. La Pratiere (wondring at the nature of Quatbrissons first speech and request, and what it mought meane or concerne) stood a little while mute and silent, not knowing what to conceive thereof, much lesse what to answer thereto: But at last considering that Valfontaine was her Lover, and Quatbrisson his brother, shee imagined there was some plot secretly compacted betweene them, that if her Father would not condiscend to their desires, that they had then resolved to steale her away from him, and so to make it a Clandestine marriage: Whereupon (her affection being desirous to know the certaintie hereof, and her curiositie ambitious to see this abstruse mysterie unlocked) she grants him his request, vowing to impose secrecie to her tongue in what he should deliver, or intrust her with: When he kissing her, and evaporating many farre fetch'd sighes (as the Herauld to proclaime his affection) he tels her; that her incomparable beauty hath captivated his thoughts, and made his heart both her Tributary, and her Prisoner; that hee envies his brothers happinesse, in having the honour to see her before himselfe. That as he is his Superiour in yeares so he is in affection to her, and that he knowes his brother is as unworthy of her, as himselfe worthily bestowed on her: La Pratiere (whose affection and thoughts ran a direct contrary Cariere, lest dreaming of that which she is now enforced to understand) is so afflicted, and withall so incensed at these unexpected speeches of Quatbrissons , that (her passion giving a law to her civilitie) casting a snow-white vaile over her crimson cheeks, and bending her brow (in whose furrowes it seemed that discontent and choller sate now triumphant) her affection is so sincere and entire to Valfontaine , as she returnes his discourteous Brother Quatbrisson , this short and sharpe answer: Quatbrisson (quoth shee) to have offered this unkindnesse of yours to your friend, had beene ignoble ingratitude, but to doe it to your owne brother, can be no lesse then treachery; and therefore this know from me, that I esteeme your Primogenitorship as inferiour to Valfontaines vertues, as they are in all respects superiour to yours, and had you not tied and wedded my tongue to silence, I would now presently publish it to the world, to the admiration and detestation of all good men, and so (with a looke ingendered of choller, and derived from disdaine) shee hastily and suddainly trips away from him, leaving him alone in the Garden to his Muses; Quatbrisson biting his lip at this sharpe repulse of La Pratiere , is yet resolute not thus to leave her, when hoping to find her Father more tractable and propitious to his sute then his Daughter, hee seekes him out, and in faire termes informes him of his affection and love to her, and that (notwithstanding his brothers research of her) hee himselfe infinitly desireth her to be his owne wife. Old Pennelle (being more covetous of his Daughters preferment, then any way carefull of her content) gives an attentive and pleasing eare to this motion of Quatbrisson , and is so delighted with the melody of his speeches, as already in heart, he wisheth her married to him, but how to answer, or give content to Valfontaine he knowes not. Now the better to effect, and compasse this match, so much wished of Quatbrisson , and desired of Pennelle ; hee (in the absence of Valfontaine ) sends for his Daughter into his closet, shewes her what preferment and happinesse is now offered her, if she will forsake Valfontaine and accept of his elder Brother Quatbrisson for her husband. La Pratiere (both moved and grieved with this her Fathers proposition and speeches) very humbly beseecheth him; that if ever he will respect her content, or regard her life, that Valfontaine may be her Husband, and not Quatbrisson , because she confesseth shee loves the younger Brother, but that she neither can nor will affect the older: Now although this her resolute and obstinate answer, doe exceedingly afflict and grieve her Father, yet hoping that a little time will prove capable to draw her to his desires, hee secretly bids Quatbrisson to ride home to Vannes , to take his Brother with him, and shortly after to returne againe to Saint-Aignaw without him, and that hee shall find no cause to feare, or reason to doubt, but that hee shall enjoy his Mistresse; the managing whereof, hee prayes him to referre to his care in his absence: Thus wee see the Father and Daughter differently affected, hee loves Quatbrisson and not Valfontaine , and she Valfontaine , but not Quatbrisson , who grieving as much at the Daughters refusall, as hee rejoyceth at her Fathers consent: He now venteth his malice on the Innocencie, and his treachery on the integrity of his Brother, by acquainting him, that hee hath used his best power and art of solicitation towards Pennelle ; and that he finds it impossible to draw him to reason; adding withall, that hee is so farre from consenting, that hee shall obtaine his Daughter in marriage, as (upon the whole) in termes enough cleare and apparant, he futurely denies him accesse to his house; Wherefore Brother (quoth hee) because I see with griefe, that you strive against the streame, and that in all actions and accidents whatsoever, the shortest errours are still best, let us to morrow take horse and away, and let this indifferency bee your resolution: That if God have decreed it shall be a match, it then will bee, otherwise not. Valfontaines heart bleeds at Pennelles aversenesse and crueltie, and his eyes overflow with teares, so soone to forsake the sight and company of his Daughter, of his deare and faire Mistresse La Pratiere ; but (being ignorant of all his brothers passages, and treacheries intended, and meant towards him) hee holds it folly to impugne, or contradict his pleasure, and so resolves to leave Saint-Aignaw , and depart home with him to Vannes . Our faire La Pratiere , seeing all things bent to crosse her desires, and her Valfontaines wishes, she (out of her tender affection to him) resolves to give him a private meeting and conference, when that very night (as her Father and his Brother were in their beds soundly sleeping) shee sends for him into her Chamber, where seeing him extremely pensive and sorrowfull; she bids him bee cheerefull and couragious, tels him that he hath no reason to despaire, but to hope, for that in life and death she will bee his, and onely his; and then informes him, that instantly upon his arrivall to Vannes , shee will write and send him a Letter, wherein she will acquaint him with the passage of a busines, whereof hee neither can conceive or dreame; conjuring him now to enquire no farther what it is, for that her tongue was enjoyned to secrecy, and sworne to silence, and so (with much chat, and more kisses) he giving her a Diamond Ring from his fingers, and shee him a paire of pearle Bracelets from her armes, in token of their mutuall constancie and affection each to other, they (infinitly against their minds) are enforced to take leave each of other, and the succeeding morne being come, the two Brothers prepare, and dispose themselves for their Iourney. When break-fast ended, according as it was concluded betwixt Pennelle and Quatbrisson, Pennelle takes Valfontaine aside to a window, and in short termes prayes him, henceforth to forbeare his house, and refraine his Daughters company, for that he hath provided another Husband for her; so having severally and solemnly taken their Congees, first of the Father, and then of the Daughter, they take horse and away. Now as they are riding home towards Vannes , as it is a sensible and heart-killing griefe to La Pratiere , so soone to bee deprived of her Valfontaines deare and sweet company, so againe she cannot refraine from smiling, to see how ingratefully and subtilly Quatbrisson goes to worke to betray his Brother, in seeking to obtaine her for himselfe in marriage; but measuring the integrity of the one, by the treachery of the other, and likewise remembring her promise to Valfontaine , to write to him at the end of two dayes after their departure, she (by a confident Messenger) accordingly sends him this Letter.  I know not whether you have greater cause to love mee, or to hate your brother Quatbrisson , in regard he vowes, hee affects me dearer then your selfe, and hath attempted to rob you of your Wife, and consequently me of my Husband; and as this is ingratitude in a friend, so it must needs be treachery in a Brother. I have heard his courting, and seene his complements tending that way, but for your sake I relish those with distast, these with neglect, and himselfe with contempt and disdaine. He hath won my Father to his will, but rest you confident (my deare Valfontaine ) that he neither can, nor shall draw me to his desire. And because true affection, especially in accidents of this nature, cannot still bee exempt of feare, therefore if any arise, or engender in your thoughts, let this dissipate and dispell it, that although my Father have banished you his house, yet his Daughter is (till death) constantly resolved to retaine and cherish you in her heart, and none but you: Manage this your Pratieres advice with discretion towards my Father, and not with choller towards your Brother, and be but a little time a patient Spectator of my affection and constancie to you, and you shall assuredly see him act his owne shame, and your glory; his affliction, and your content and desire. La Pratiere.  Valfontaine having received and read this Letter; the base ingratitude and foule treachery of his brother Quatbrisson , doth extremely afflict and torment him; yea the knowledge and remembrance thereof, throwes him into such passions of choller, and sumes of revenge, as once he resolved to right himselfe on him, by sending him a Challenge, and fighting with him; vowing that the bonds of nature were not by farre so strong, as those of affection, and that his brother having given the first cause of offence, and breach of amity betwixt them, it was no marvell that he tooke that course, and preferred that forme of proceeding to any other. But then againe considering his deare La Pratieres injunction and prohibition from choller, this last reason ore- swaied and prevailed against his former resolution, when knowing himselfe infinitly obliged to her for her courtesie, and constancie, so sweetly expressed to him in this her Letter, he can doe no lesse, then returne her an answer thereof in requitall, the which he doth by her owne Messenger in these termes. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT)  would have proved my Rivall, in attempting to love you, because he perfectly knowes, I affect you farre dearer then the whole world; yea this errour (or as you justly terme it, this treachery) of his, is so odious, so strange to me, as it had farre exceeded my beliefe, if your affection and constancie had not so courteously revealed it to me in your Letter, the which I both blushed and palled to peruse. Neither is it any thankes to him, that he missed of his desire, in missing of you, rather to your vertuous selfe, which distasted his courting and complements for his owne sake, and disdained him for mine. Deare and sweet La Pratiere , in that my brother hath won your Father, I exceedingly grieve, but in that I have not lost his Daughter, I farre more triumph and rejoyce: But why thinke I of losing you, sith to call your constancie in question, is no lesse then to prophane your affection and my judgement, and so to make my selfe both uncapable and unworthy of you, for how can my love to you, retaine any spice or sparke of feare, for that being banished your Fathers house, I am yet so happy, to recover so safe a Harbour and Sanctuary, yea so precious a Temple, as your heart; In which regard it is every way fit, that your requests should be to me commands, for otherwise my Sword had already called me Coward, if by this time I had not called my Brother to a strict and severe account for this his treachery. I will still observe your Father with respect, though he refuse to respect me with observance; and for my ingratefull and treacherous Brother, he may act his owne shame and affliction, but cannot conduce to content, or desire, because that must soly proceed from your selfe, sith in the sweet enjoying of you to my Wife, consists the onely content of my life, and the chiefest of all my earthly felicity. Valfontaine.  Some two dayes after that La Pratiere was made joyfull with this answer of her Valfontaine , shee hath againe sorrowfull newes of Quatbrissons arrivall to her Fathers house at Saint-Aignaw , who had purposely given it out to his brother Valfontaine at Vannes , that he rides to Hennbon . He here renewes his late sute to the Father and Daughter, but he finds them both in the same humours and resolutions, he left them; he willing, and she coy, hee desirous to have him his Sonne in law, and she resolute never to make him, but his brother Valfontaine her Husband. He profereth her many rich gifts and presents, and a blancke to write downe what Iointure she pleaseth to demand, but she peremptorily refuseth it all, and bids him bestow it on some other, of whom it may find better acceptance; yea I may safely say, and truely affirme, that their affections are farre more opposite, and contrary, then their sexes; for the more he sees her, he loves her, and the oftner she beholds him, the more she hates him; so that when he apparantly perceives, that she deeply vowes to her Father, and himselfe, onely to marry his brother Valfontaine , or her Grave, he seeing his labour for the time present lost, and his affection to her in vaine; having nothing left to comfort him against the repulse of this amorous sute, but the constant friendship of her Father, hee sorrowfully takes his leave of them, and rides home to Vannes ; but as close as hee beares this his Iourney from his brother Valfontaine , yet La Pratiere holds her selfe bound to signifie it to him, the which the very next day she doth by her second Letter, which speakes thus.  two dayes, I have beene againe importunately haunted and solicited by your unkind Brother Quatbrisson for marriage, but hee hath found my first answer, to bee my second and last; Yea I have so nipt his vaine hopes in their blossomes, by signifying to him and my Father, my infallible resolution, either to wed you or my grave, as I thinke (except their hopes betray their judgements) the one is assured, and the other confident, that time will make it apparant to the world, that my words will prove deeds, and that the last will make the first reall: But if your said brother will yet (notwithstanding) farther exercise his folly in my patience, and so make himselfe as ridiculous to mee, as to you he is treacherous, I (out of the deare affection, and tender respect which I beare you) will then fall on my knees to my Father, to hasten his consent to our marriage, that in seeking my content, you may therein find your owne; and this is my resolution, wherewith if yours concurre and sympathise, Heaven may, but Earth shall not crosse our desires. La Pratiere.  Valfontaine receives this second Letter from his Mistris with smiles and frownes, with smiles to see her inviolable constancie and affection, with frownes to behold his brother Quatbrissons continuall malice and treacherie towards him, the which considering (as also because it so neerely concernes him) hee resolves to taxe him thereof, and to see whether (by faire requests and perswasions) hee may reclaime him from affecting his faire and deere La Pratiere , and so to give over his sute to her, but first hee knowes himselfe indebted and obliged, to returne her an answer to this her last Letter, the which he doth in these termes.  which againe advertiseth me of my Brother Quatbrissons perseverance in his treachery towards mee, by seeking to betray and bereave mee of your selfe, in whom my heart and thoughts imparadise their most soveraigne earthly felicity; and your resolution in nipping his hopes, and your Fathers will, by electing me or your grave for your Husband, doth so ravish my heart with joy, and so rap my conceits in an extasie of sweet content, as I am confident God hath reserved La Pratiere , to bee Valfontaines sweet Wife, and he to bee her deare Husband. But as I know not whether my unkind and treacherous Brother, will yet farther bewray you his folly, in exercising your patience with his importunity; so to save you that labour and penance, which for my sake and love you are ready to impose to your selfe, I am both ready and resolved, not onely to fall on my knees to your Father, but also to your sweet selfe, that our marriage be hastned; for as your resolution herein, is, and ever shall be mine, so our hearts and thoughts sympathising in these wishes, I hope that both Heaven and Earth have resolved, not to crosse, but shortly to consummate and finish our desires. Valfontaine.  He having thus dispatched and sent away his Letter, to his sweet and faire Mistresse, hee now resolves to have some conference with his unkind Brother, to see what a brazen face, hee either will, or can put upon this his ingratitude and treachery: But Quatbrissons policie will anticipate and prevent him; for he having his heart and contemplations deepely fixed on La Pratieres beauty, and having ranne over all the inventions of his art and affection, how to make her forsake he coynesse, and so how to obtaine her for his wife, hee at last resolves to faine himselfe sicke, and so then to reveale to his brother Valfontaine , that it is his deare and fervent affection to La Pratiere ; which is the cause thereof. To which purpose hee keepes his bed, and in his perfect health is twice let blood, thereby to looke ill; when sending for his brother to his Chamber, and exempting all other company thence, he acquaints and informes him, That since he first saw La Pratiere , hee still most tenderly loved her, and that hee must now die, because she will not affect and love him; He prayes and conjures him (by vertue of all the same blood which equally streames in both their bodies) for the saving and preserving of his life, that hee will now abandon his affection from her, and so yeeld him up all the power and interest that hee hath, or pretends to have in her, and that in requitall thereof (if occasion require) hee shall still find him ready, not onely to expose all his meanes, but his dearest blood and life at his command: A request so unjust, and a proposition so devoid of common sense and reason, as Valfontaine observing it, and therein seeing his brothers impudencie, now growne to the height of basenesse and folly, hee exceedingly incensed thereat (with a disdainefull looke) returnes him this sharpe and bitter, yet deserved reply. Was it not enough that I understood your treachery, by my faire and deare La Pratiere , in seeking and attempting to bereave me of her, but that thou art thy selfe become so sottish, to make thy tongue the Advocate, as well to plead and apologise thy treachery to me, as to publish thy shame to thy selfe, and to the whole world, in seeking and desiring me to surcease my affection to her, and to renounce my interest of her to thy selfe: No, no, base Quatbrisson (for henceforth I highly disdaine to terme or esteeme you my brother) I give thee to understand and know, that in heart, and in honour she is mine, and I hers, and therefore you shall die and damne, before I will permit thee to inrich thy selfe with my losse of her, whom I affect and prise a thousand times dearer then my selfe, or then all the lands and treasures of the world; when without any other farewell, he hastily and chollerickly flings forth his Chamber from him. Quatbrisson seeing his brothers furious departure, and remarking his peremptory and incivill answer to him, hee (in his heart and thoughts) vowes revenge, and in his resolutions sweares to make him repent it. To which effect, forsaking his bed, and abandoning his counterfeit sicknesse, his choller hardly affording his patience three dayes to recover his blood and strength, but knowing his brother to be now at Nantes with their Vncle De Massy , hee seekes out a deare and intimate friend of his named Monsieur La Roche , whom ingaging to be his second in a Duell against his owne brother Valfontaine , they ride over to Nantes , when comming to small Parish, termed Saint Villerge , within a league of the Citie, he writes a Challenge, delivers it to La Roche , and so dispeeds him away with it to his brother. La Roche comes to Nantes , finds out Valfontaine at the President, his Vncles house, being in the company of a very intimate friend of his, of that Citie, named Monsieur de Pont Chausey , and delivereth him his brothers Challenge fast sealed, the which hee hastily breaking open, and perusing, hee finds that it speakes this language.  to wife, therefore it is fit that one of us dye, that the other may survive and live, to be enriched with so precious a treasure, and crowned with so inestimable a blessing and felicity; which considering, as also because my modest requests have (undeservedly) met with thy incivill carriage, and beene requited with thy malicious execrations, Therefore find it not strange, to see affection give a Law to Nature, and mine honour to contemne thy contempt and malice, in enviting thee, and thy Second, to meet me and mine with your single Rapiers, to morrow twixt two or three after dinner, in a faire meddow at the East end of Saint-Vallery , within a little flight shot thereof, where thou shalt find this Gentleman (whom I have prayed to be the Bearer hereof) who will safely conduct thee to me, where I will patiently attend thee; I expect no other answer but thy selfe, neither doe I any way doubt (much lesse despaire) of thy meeting me, since by birth I know thou art Noble, and by inclination pretendest to be generous. Qvatbrisson.  Valfontaine smiles at the reading of this Challenge, and in conceit laughing at his brother Quatbrissons errours and folly, hee cheerfully turnes himselfe to La Roche , to whom he speakes thus. Monsieur La Roche , I make no doubt but you are Quatbrissons Second; to whom he replies; My respect to your Brother hath engaged me thereunto, insteed of a more worthy, and yet I ingenuously confesse and protest (Sir quoth hee) that I have promised no more to him, then (if occasion presented) I am ready to performe for your selfe, Valfontaine thankes him, and prayes him to returne his Brother Quatbrisson this answer, That to morrow at the appointed houre and place hee will not faile to meet him: When entreating La Roche to walke with him into the next Chamber, hee told him, hee presumed hee should shew him his Second; when Valfontaine taking Pont Chausey to the window, hee shewes him his brothers Challenge, and prayes him to honour him in being his Second. Pont Chausey (not out of any feare in himselfe, but in love to these two brothers) as a Christian Gentleman profereth to ride over to Quatbrisson to Saint-Vallery , and to use his best power and endeavours to take up and reconcile these differences betweene them; but La Roche tels him hee may save that Iourney and labour, For that (to his knowledge) Quatbrisson is both resolute and irreconcilable in that quarrell; whereupon Pont Chausey freely engageth himselfe to Valfontaine , and so these two Seconds (though not as loving friends, yet as friendly and honourable enemies) very secretly that evening provide their Rapiers, which done, La Roche rides backe to Saint-Vallery , acquainting Quatbrisson with his brother Valfontaines generous resolution, to meet and fight with him the next day, as also that Pont Chausey is his Second: And although (by the instigation of Sathan) that Choller and Revenge make minutes seeme houres, and houres yeares, ere it hath wrought his wished effects, and effected his bloody designes: So these our foure rash and inconsiderate Gentlemen (more full of Valour then Vertue, and of Courage then Christianitie) the houre appointed for the Rendesvous approaching, and Quatbrisson with his Chirugion, being first in the field hath difficultly made two turnes, before La Roche ushereth in his brother Valfontaine , his Second Pont Chausey and their Chirugion; when they all tying up their horses to the hedge, they (according to the custome of Duels) doe all throw of their dublets, and each unbooting his fellow, they appeare in their silke stocking and white pumps, as if they were fitter to dance Coranto's or Pavins, then to fight Duels. So the two brothers first draw, and approach each other, and at their first comming up, Valfontaine (without being touched himselfe) gives Quatbrisson a deep wound in his right thigh, and if his Rapier had not beaten downe the thrust, it had undoubtedly nailed him to the ground; at their second encounter they are both hurt, Quatbrisson in the right arme, and Valfontaine of a scarre in the necke, and here they make a stand to take breath, Quatbrisson not as yet despairing, nor Valfontaine triumphing or assuring himselfe of the victory, and the fight and effusion of their blood is so farre from rebating or quenching, as it rather revives their courages with more spleene and animositie, so they will againe try their fortunes; They now traverse their ground, and approach each other, and although they are not lesse vallorous then before, yet (to the eyes of their Seconds and Chirurgions) they are now more cautious in their plea, and more advised in choosing and refusing their ground, when Valfontaine breaking a thrust (which his brother presented him) he then calling to mind the sweetnesse of his La Pratieres beauty, and the foulnesse of his brothers malice and treachery towards him, drives home a thrust at him, which entereth betwixt his short ribs, and making the blood to gush and streame forth, doth soone quaile his courage; so as he who right now thought himselfe master of his brothers life, now feares his owne, so that hee thinkes hee hath given enough, if not received too much in counter-exchange, as well to secure his reputation from the scandall of his friends, as to warrant his generositie from the detraction of his enemies, and therefore throwing away his Rapier, he (with more wisedome then honour) begs his life of his brother, vowing henceforth wholly to forsake and leave him La Pratiere , and to love him as dearely as formerly hee hated him deadly: Which cowardise of his, is so farre from being relished, or approved of the Spectators, as it proves the wonder of Valfontaine , the laughture of Pont Chausey , the disdaine of his owne Second La Roche , and the contempt of both their Chirurgions; but Valfontaine was as benigne as Quatbrisson was base and envious, and as noble as he was treacherous, and so upon his submission, hee sheathes up his sword, gives him his life, and with his hat in his hand embraceth him, and thus with many fraternall words and complements, these two brothers (in all outward shew) are againe reconciled, and become perfect friends: But the end proves all things. Now to follow the streame of our History, and the ceremonies of Duels, wee must passe from Quatbrisson and Valfontaine the Principals, to La Roche and Pont Chausey , their Seconds, to see in what shape they will come forth, and how they resolve to beare themselves in the conclusion, and knitting up of this reconciliation; As for Pont Chausey , hee thinkes it no disparagement or shame to him now to refuse to fight, sith his Principall hath given his Enemy the foyle, in giving him his life; but contrariwise, La Roche being Second to the Challenger, not the Challenged, hee therefore holds it no lawfull plea or excuse for him to exempt himselfe from fighting. Pont Chauseys modesty seemes to over-vaile his valour with silence and indifferencie, which the insulting vanity of La Roche doth so farre misconstrue, as he erroniously attributes it, rather to feare and cowardise, then to reason or judgement. The worst of Pont Chauseys malice venteth no other speeches and language, but that he will follow and abide the censure of their Principals, whether they being their Seconds ought to fight or no, and accordingly hee is ready either to retire or advance; But La Roches intemperate passions (flying a higher pitch) with much vehemencie and choller protesteth, that he came into the field purposely to fight, and not to keepe sheepe, or to catch flies with his Rapier. The two brothers interpose and consult hereon, and doe joyntly affirme, that because they themselves are reconciled, and become good friends, they hold it repugnant to reason and contradictory to the right and nature of Duels, that their Seconds should once draw their weapons, much lesse fight; But this neither doth nor can as yet satisfie La Roche , whose choller is now become so boundlesse, as he in lofty termes elevateth Valfontaines valour to the skies, and dejecteth Quatbrissons cowardise as low as Hell, begging permission of the one to fight with his Second, and peremptorily informing the other, that he will fight; But both Quatbrisson and Valfontaine condemne those fumes, and this heate of La Roche , and are so farre from applauding it in him, as they (in downeright termes) repute it to temeritie and rashnesse, and not to magnanimity and valour; yea his impatiencie hath so provoked and moved their patience, as (not in jest but in earnest) they bandy these words to him, that he glorieth so much in his generositie, as in now ambitiously seeking to adde to his valour, hee substracteth from his judgement. When Pont Chausey (to retort and wipe off the least taint or blemish, which either La Roche , or the two brothers might conceive, lay on his reputation) thinkes it now high time to speake, because as yet he had spoken so little, and prayes La Roche to find out some expedient, either that they might returne as loving Friends, or fight it out as Honourable Enemies, and that for his part hee is so farre from the least shaddow of feare, or conceit of cowardise, as hee tels him plainely, hee shall find his Rapier of an excellent temper, and his heart of a better: Whereupon vaine and miserable La Roche , consulting with nature, and not with grace; he to give end to this difference, resolves on an expedient as wretched as execrable, the which he proposeth to Pont Chausey and the two brothers in these termes; That the onely way, and his last resolution is, that a faire paire of dice shall be the Iudge and Vmpier betweene them, and that who throwes most at one cast, it shall bee in his choice either to fight or not to fight, whereunto Pont Chausey willingly consenteth, although Quatbrisson and Valfontaine doe in vaine contradict and oppose it. But the decree is past, and La Roche (very officious in his wickednesse, and forward in his impiety) spreads his Cloake on the ground, drawes a paire of dice forth his pocket, and because he was of the Challengers side, he will throw first, which he doth, and the fortune of the dice gives him seven; Pont Chausey followes him and likewise taking the dice throwes onely five: Whereat La Roche gracelesly insulting and triumphing, with an open throat cryes out, fight, fight, fight; and so presently drawes his Rapier. Pont Chausey seeing his enemy armed, thinkes it no longer, either safe or honourable for him to be unarmed, when (yet with a kind of religious reluctancie, and unwilling willingnesse) hee likewise unsheathes his Rapier, and so without any farther expostulation, they here approach each other: But because (for brevities sake) I resolve to passe over the circumstances, and only to mention the issue of their single combat, let mee (before I proceed farther) in the name and feare of God conjure the Christian Reader, here to admire with wonder and admiration, at his sacred Providence, and divine Iustice which in the issue of this Duell is made conspicuous and apparant to these two rash and unconsiderate Gentlemen, the Combattants, and in them to all others of the whole world; For loe, just as many picks as each of them threw on the Dice, so many wounds they severally received each from other, as Pont Chausey five and La Roche seven, and he who so extremely desired to fight, and so insatiably thirsted after Pont Chauseyes blood, is now here by him nayled dead to the ground, and his breathlesse corpes all gored and washed in his owne blood. A fearefull example and remarkeable president for all bloody minded Gentlemen of these our times, to contemplate and looke on, because wretched La Roche was so miserable, as hee had no point of time to see his errour, no sparke of grace to repent it. Quatbrisson and his Chirurgion (as sorrowfull for his death, as his brother Valfontaine is glad thereof) take order for his decent transporting to the Citie; whiles Valfontaine congratulates with Pont Chausey for his good fortune and victory; who for his safety flies to Blavet , untill the Duke of Rayes (to whom he was homager) had procured and sent him his Pardon from the King, the which in few weekes after he effected. Monsieur de Caerstaing , and Madamoyselle Ville- blanche his wife are advertised of their two Sonnes quarrell at Saint Vallery , and of the cause and issue thereof, who condemne Quatbrisson for his treachery and malice, and applaud Valfontaine for so nobly giving of his brother his life, when it lay in his power and pleasure to have deprived him thereof, which newes is likewise speedily conveied first to Nantes , and then to Saint-Aignaw , where Pennelle as much grieves at Quatbrissons foyle and disgrace, as his Daughter our faire La Pratiere triumphs at her Valfontaines victory, and because she will no longer bee deprived of his presence, whose absence deprives her of all her earthly content and felicity, shee makes her prayers and teares become such incessant Orators, and importunate Advocates to her Father, as she now drawes his free consent to take Valfontaine for her husband, which at last to their owne unspeakeable Ioy, and the approbation and content of all their parents of either side, is at Saint-Aignaw performed and consummated with much pompe and bravery. But albeit Quatbrisson (as we have formerly understood) have all the reasons of the world, to bee fully and fairely reconciled to his brother Valfontaine , yea (and according to his promise and oath) to affect him tenderly and dearely, yet where the heart is not sanctified and in peace, the tongue may pretend though not intend it; For the more he gazeth on his sister in law La Pratieres beauty, the more the freshnesse and delicacie thereof, revives and inflames his lascivious lust towards her, when knowing her to bee as chaste as faire, and being confident that he was out of all hope to receive any immodest courtesie, or familiarity from her, whiles her Husband his brother Valfontaine lives, the Devill hath already taken such full possession of his heart, as (with a hellish ingratitude and impietie) hee wretchedly resolves to deprive him of his life, of whom as it were but right now he had the happinesse to receive his owne. As soone as we thinke of Revenge we meerly forget our selves, but when we consent to murther we absolutely forget God, for that hellish contemplation, and this inhumane and bloody action, doe instantly worke so wretchedly in us, that of men we become Monsters, and (which is worse) of Christians Devils; for thereby we make our selves his slaves and members. A misery to which all others are not comparable, because those are finite, in regard they have only relation to the life of our bodies; but this infinite in regard it occasioneth the death of our soules: But all this notwithstanding, it is not in jest but in earnest, that Quatbrisson assumes this bloody resolution to murther his brother Valfontaine ; For seeing that it was neither in his power or fortune to kill him in the Duell, he therefore holds it more safe, lesse dangerous to have him poysoned, and so deales with his brothers Apothecarie, named Moncallier , to undertake and performe it, and in requitall thereof he assureth him of three hundred crownes, and gives him the one halfe in hand, whereupon this Factor of the Devill, this Empericke of Hell, confidently promiseth him speedily to effect and performe it, the which he doth, The manner thus. Valfontaine within sixe weekes of his marriage, finds his body in an extreme heate, some reputing it to an excesse of wine, which he had the day before taken at Pontivie Faire, and others for having beene too amorous and uxorious to his sweet young wife La Pratiere ; But it matters not which excesse of these two gave him his sicknesse, onely let it satisfie the Reader, that (as we have already heard) his body was very much inflamed and hot, the dangerous symtomes either of a burning Feaver, or a Plurisie, the which to allay and coole, he sends for his apothecarie Moncalier from Vannes to Saint Aignaw , and after their consultation he openeth him a veine very timely in the morning, and drawes ten ounces of blood from him, and towards night gives him a Glitter, wherein hee infused strong poyson, which spreading ore the vitall parts of his body, doth so soone worke its operation, and extinguish their radicall moisture, that being the most part of the night tortured with many sharpe throes, and heart- killing convulsions, hee before the next morning dyes in his bed: His wife La Pratiere being desperately vanquished with sorrow, doth (as it were) dissolve and melt her selfe into teares, at this sudden and unexpected death of her Husband Valfontaine , and indeed her griefes and sorrowes are farre the more infinite and violent, in that she sees her selfe a widdow almost as soone as a wife. Her Father is likewise pensive and sorrowfull for the death of his Sonne in Law, and so also is his owne Father and Mother at Vannes . But for his inhumane brother Quatbrisson , although he neither can, or shall bleare the eyes of God, yet hee intends to doe those of men, from the knowledge and detection of this foule and bloody fact; for hee puts on a mournefull and disconsolate countenance, on his rejoycing and triumphing heart, for the death of his brother, the which he endeavoreth to publish in his speeches and apparell; so hee rides over to Saint Aignan to his sister in law La Pratiere , condoles with her for her Husband his brothers death, and with his best oratory strives to dissipate and dispell her sorrowes; but still her thoughts and conscience doe notwithstanding prompt her, that (considering his former affection to her, and his fighting with his brother her Husband for her) sure hee had a hand in his death, but in what manner or how she knowes not, and so as a most vertuous and sorrowfull Lady, leaves the revealing thereof to the good pleasure and Providence of God; and the curious heads both of Nantes and Vannes concurre with her in the same conceipt and beliefe. But three moneths are scarce past over, since Valfontaine was laid in his grave, but Quatbrisson is still so deepely besotted with his owne lust, and the beauty of La Pratiere , as he sels his wit for folly, and againe becomes a Sutor to marry her, having none but this poore Apologie to colour out his incestuous desires; that hee will procure a dispensation from Rome to approve it; and that hee hath already spoken to Yvon Bishop of Reimes to that effect, who was many yeares Penitentiarie (or Almoner) to Pope Paulus Quintus . And what doth this indiscretion of his worke with La Pratiere , but onely to encrease her jealousie, to confirme her suspicion, and to make her the more confident, that her Husband had beene still in this world if he had not beene the meanes so soone to send him into another: Wherfore she rejecteth both his sute and himselfe, tels him, that if he can find in his heart and conscience to marry her, shee cannot dispence with her soule to espouse him, and therefore that he shall doe well to surcease his sute, either to the Pope or Bishop, sith if it lay in their powers, yet it should never in her pleasure to grant, or resolution to effect it; but this peremptory refusall of hers cannot yet cause Quatbrisson to forsake and leave her; For if his lust and concupiscence formerly made him peevish to seeke her for his wife, now it makes him meerely sottish and impudent to alter his sute, and so to attempt and desire to make her his strumpet: But hee hath no sooner delivered her this his base and obscene motion, but all the blood of her body flushing in her face, shee highly disdaineth both his speeches and himselfe, and vowing and scorning henceforth ever more to come into his company, so she informes her Father of his dishonourable intent, and unchast motion to her, who to rid himselfe of so incivill and impudent a guest, thereupon (in sharpe termes) forbids him his house and his Daughters company, as having hereby altogether made himselfe unworthy to enjoy the priviledge of the one, or the honour of the other, when this sweet and chaste young Lady (to be no more haunted with so lascivious a Ghost and Spirit) being sought in marriage by divers noble and gallant Gentlemen, shee among them all (after a whole yeares mourning for her first) makes choice of Monsieur de Pont Chausey for her second Husband, and marries him; Quatbrisson seeing himselfe so disdainefully sleighted and rejected of La Pratiere , he (as a base Gentleman, and dishonourable Lover) metamorphoseth his affection into hatred towards her, and vowes that his revenge shall shortly match her disdaine, and meet with her ingratitude, and so flies her sight and company as much as hee formerly desired it. But as the best Revenge is to make our enemies see that we prosper and doe well, so hee quite contrary makes it his practise and ambition to doe evill; For from henceforth among many other of his vices he defileth his body with whoredome, and gives himselfe over to Fornication and Adultery, which hath taken up so deepe a habit in him, as it is now growne to a second nature; for he wholly abandoneth himselfe to Queanes and Strumpets, that be she maid, wife, or widdow, his wanton eye scarce sees any, but his lustfull heart desireth, and his lascivious tongue seekes. Now Quatbrisson (among many other) hearing that a poore Peasant, or countrey man, termed Renne Malliot , of the parish of Saint-Andrewes , three miles from Vannes , had a sweet and faire young Daughter, hee therefore very lewdly resolves to see her, and to tempt her to his obscene desires, when provoked and halled on by his lust, as that was likewise by the Devill, hee rides over to her Fathers house, and alighting from his horse cals there for some wine, but with his Hauke on his fist, and his laquay and dogs at his heeles, thereby the better to over-vaile and colour out his lascivious designe and intent: And that the Reader may the better and apparantly behold this countrey Virgin Marieta ; shee was aged of some sixteene yeares, and towards her seventeenth, tall and straight, and rather a little enclining to fatnesse then to leanesse; her haire was of a bright flaxen colour, and she of so fresh a beauty, and sweet and delicate complexion, that her eyes were capable to inflame desire, and her cheeks to engender and exact affection, so that as it was a wonder among many to find so delicate a Countrey-lasse, it was also many wonders in one, to see how sweetly her rich beauty graced her poore clothes, whiles they (though in vaine) endeavour to disgrace it. Quatbrisson no sooner sees Marieta , but she is so faire and amiable in his eyes, as they informe him, that report comes infinitely short of her beauty, when burning in the flames of his heastly concupiscence towards her, his lust so exceedingly out braves his reason, that his eyes and heart doe already doe homage to hers, and he is so farre caught and in snared in the contemplation of her fresh youth and beauty, as hee vowes to leave no art unattempted to obtaine his lustfull desires in enjoying of her virginity: To which end hee very often and secretly visiteth her, discovereth her his lewd desires and affection, gives her Gloves, Bonlace, Lawne, woorsted Stockings, and the like trifles, thereby the sooner to prevaile with her, when God knowes this faire poore maiden was so chaste, as yet shee knew not what belonged to unchastity, such was her obscure dwelling, and innocent education, and yet behold the Devill was so busie with her, and Quatbrisson with the Devill, to draw and prostitute her to sinne, as she was so farre in love with his gay clothes, sugred speeches and faire promises, rich gifts, and especially because hee was a Gentleman, that in a few weekes shee had hardly the power or will to deny him any thing, no not her selfe. But whiles thus Quatbrisson laies close siege to the chastity of the daughter, her Mother Iane Chaumett (being of a quicke wit and sharpe apprehension, measuring his youth by her Daughters beauty) begins to mistrust and feare that by his often visits, he endeavored to put a rape on her vertue, in seeking to inrich himselfe with the losse of her maiden-head, the which to prevent, she forbids him her house, shewing him that she had rather dye, then live to see her Daughter made a Strumpet, adding farther, that if hereupon he did not forbeare her house and her daughters company, shee would forthwith acquaint his Father Monsieur de Caerstainge therewith, alleadging, that how close so ever hee bore himselfe, shee knew him to be his Sonne and heire, and termed Quatbrisson ; which crosse speeches of hers doe much afflict and perplexe him, and the more because hee sees he cannot now approach Marieta , and which is worst of all, in regard he knowes not whom to employ towards her, to win her to his desires: But at length remembring that hee was well acquainted with an old Franciscan Frier of Auroy , named Father Symplician , who many yeares begged the Countrey for the repairing of their Monastery, and with whom he had often caroused and beene merry: He therefore holds him a fit Instrument and Agent for his purpose, and so rides over to Auroy , and sends for him to his lodging, where giving him good cheere, and well heating his head with wine, he there from point to point discovereth this secret, and laies open himselfe to him: So this old Frier loving his cups better then his beads, and Monsieur de Quatbrisson better then his Guardian (because hee had twice formerly expelled him the Monastery for some of his dishonest and debauched prancks) hee freely engageth himselfe to him, affirming that he well knew both Father, Mother, and Daughter, having heretofore many times layen in their house, when hee hath beene over taken, either by night or raine. Hypocrisie is the Devils Maske or Visard, and there is no way so subtle or sinful to deceive, as under the Cloake and Colour of Religion, and therefore it is a most pernitious and odious shame to Christians, that those who professe piety should prophane it. This good fellow Frier Symplician (taking the tide of time, and the wind of opportunity) under the pretext of visiting some of his kinsfolkes leaves Auroy , repaires to Vannes , and so to Malliots house in the countrey, where purposely faigning himselfe sicke, thereby to procure himselfe the better colour for his stay, and the better meanes for the dispatch of this love busines for Monsieur Quatbrisson , there Malliot and his wife Iane Chaumet (out of their respect to Religion, and reverence to Church-men) entertaine him lovingly, and attend him carefully and diligently, thinking no cost too much, nor any meat, care or labour enough which they spent and bestowed on him; But we shall see him requite this Hospitality, and repay this courtesie of theirs with a base ingratitude. For in the absence of the Father and Mother, this deboshed Fryer teacheth their faire Daughter Marieta a new Catechisme; hee tells her that Monsieur Quatbrisson is deeply in love with her; that if shee will hearken to his Affection, and so become flexible to his desires, hee will shortly steale her away from her Parents, and either maintaine her Gentlewoman-like in brave apparell, or els marry her to some rich Serving-man, or Farmers Sonne, with whom she might live merrily; and at her hearts content all the dayes of her life; adding withall, that it was pitty her delicate fresh beauty should bee so strictly and obscurely moved up in her fathers poore Cottage, and that it was a shame to her to prove an enemy to Nature, who had beene so bountifull and so true a friend to her, with many more obscene reasons, and deboshed speeches looking that way, the which (in modesty) I cannot remember without shame, nor relate without detestation. So this pandarising old Fryer (degenerating from his habit, profession, and name) what with the honey (or rather indeed the poyson) of his speeches and promises, and the sugar of some gifts and tokens which he delivered her from Quatbrisson , he drawes this harmlesse and innocent poore Countrey mayd, so farre to forget her selfe, her Parents, and God, that in hope of rich apparell and a good husband, shee tells Father Symplician , that she is wholly Quatbrissons at command, and that for his sake and love she is absolutely resolved to forsake her Father and Mother, and to goe away with him any night or day, when he pleaseth to fetch her; the which he shortly doth, and shee accomplisheth: And thus was the odious ingratitude of this Fryer Symplician , towards honest Malliot , and his Wife, for his good cheere, lodging, and entertainment, to betray and bereave them of their onely childe and daughter, whom they well hoped would have proved the Ioy of their life, and the staffe and comfort of their Age. Quatbrisson (in the vanity of his voluptuous thoughts) having thus (by himselfe and the Fryer) played his prize in stealing away faire Marieta , hee by night brings her to his owne old Nurse her house, which is a little mile distant from that of his Father, where he secretly keepes her, takes his pleasure of her, and as often as hee pleaseth, lyes with her whole nights together; but Marieta's sorrowfull Father and Mother seeing themselves thus robbed of their only Iewell their daughter, they bitterly lament her losse, and their owne misfortunes therein. They complaine to all their Neighbours thereof, and leave few adjacent Parishes or houses unsought for her; yea her Mother Iane Chaumets griefe and jealousie transport her so farre, as vehemently suspecting that Monsieur de Quatbrisson had stolne her away, she trips over to his Fathers house, and there (with sorrow in her lookes, and teares in her eyes) acquaints both him and the Lady his Wife thereof; who presently send for their Son Quatbrisson before them. They shew him what an infinite scandall this foule fact and crime of his will breed him, and likewise reflect upon themselves, and all their Kinsfolkes and Family. How the Iustice of God infallibly attends on whordome and fornication, and that he hath no other true course or meanes left him to expiate and deface it, but Confession, Contrition, and Repentance, and by returning the poore Countrey girle againe to her aged and sorrowfull parents: But Quatbrisson their Sonne (as a base deboshed Gentleman) denyes all, termes old Malliots wife an old hagge and devill, to charge him thus falsly with the stealing away of her Daughter; and so without any other redresse or comfort, this poore Mother returnes againe home to her sorrowfull husband, and Quatbrisson secretly to his Nurses, to frollicke and sport it out with his sweet and faire Countrey Mistris Marieta . But to observe the better Order and Decorum in the dilation and unfolding of this History, leave we (for a small time) this lascivious young couple, wallowing in the beastly pleasures of their sensuality and fornication, and come we a little to speake how suddenly and sharply (at unawares) the vengeance and justice of God impriseth our execrable Apothecary Moncallier , who so wretchedly and lamentably (as we have formerly understood) had sent innocent Valfontaine from earth to heaven, by that damnable drug and ingredient of Poyson. The manner whereof briefely is thus: Quatbrisson (as wee have already seene) having exchanged his former affection into future malice and envie towards his Sister in law La Pratiere , doth still retaine such bloudy thoughts against her, as (striking hands with the Devill) hee (in favour of three hundred Crownes more) hath againe ingaged his Hellish Apothecary Moncallier likewise to poyson her, at his first administring of Physicke to her; which intended deplorable Tragedy of theirs is no sooner projected and plotted of the one, then promised speedily to be acted and performed by the other, to the end (quoth these two miserable wretches) to make her equall, as in marriage, so in death with her first husband Valfontaine . Thus Quatbrisson longing, and Moncallier hearkening out for La Pratieres first sickenesse, two moneths are scarce blowne over, since her marriage with Pont Chausey , but shee is surprised with a pestilent Fever; when hee as a loving and kinde husband (at the request of his sicke Wife) tides over to Vannes for this monster of his profession and time Moncallier , to come with him and give her Physicke, the which presently (with as much treacherous care, as feigned sorrow) hee promiseth to effect; and so inwardly resolves with the Devill, and himselfe to poyson her: but we shall see here that Gods providence will favorably permit the first, and his goodnesse and mercie miraculously prevent the second. Moncallier sees this his faire and sweet Patient La Pratiere , but he is yet so farre from shame or repentance that he had poysoned her first husband, as (with a gracelesse ratiocination) he confirmes his former impious resolution likewise to dispatch her selfe: but for that time hee contenteth himselfe onely to draw sixe ounces of bloud from her, and promiseth to returne to her the next morning with Physicke, and therein to insinuate and infuse the Poyson. But here (in the feare, and to the glory of God) let mee request the Christian Reader to admire and wonder with mee at the strangenesse of this suddaine and divine punishment of God, then and there showne on this wretched Apothecary Moncallier . For as he was ready to depart, and being on the top of the Stayres (next to the Chamber doore where La Pratiere lay sicke) complementing with her husband Pont Chausey at his farewell, hee trips in his Spurres, and so falls downe headlong at the foot thereof, there breakes his necke, and which is lamentable and fearfull, he hath neither the power or grace left him to speake a word, much lesse to repent his cruell poysoning of Valfontaine , or to pray unto God to forgive it him. And thus was the miserable end of this wretched Apothecary Moncallier , who, when hee absolutely thought that that bloudy fact of his was quite defaced and forgotten of God, then God (as we see) in his due time remembred to punish him for the same, to his utter confusion and destruction, that as his Crime was bloudy, so his punishment should bee sudden and sharpe. Returne we now againe to Quatbrisson (who amidst his carnall pleasures with his young and faire Marieta ) is advertised of Moncalliers sudden and unnaturall death at S. Aignaw , wherat (resembling himselfe) he is so far from any apprehension or griefe, as he exceedingly triumpheth and rejoyceth thereat; yea, he is as glad that he hath thus broke his necke, because hee can now tell no tales, as sorrowfull if now before his death he have not poysoned La Pratiere , as formerly he did her first husband Valfontaine his brother. Whiles thus Quatbrissons joy in injoying Marieta , proves the griefe and disconsolation of her Parents, for it is now generally bruted in Vannes , that Quatbrisson hath stolne away Malliots daughter Marieta , whereof her Father and Mother being sorrowfully acquainted (hee being weake and sickly) shee againe repaires to Monsieur de Caerstaing and his Lady, and with teares in her eyes throwing her selfe at their feet, acquaints them with this publicke report, humbly beseeching them to bee a meanes to the Gentleman their sonne, that hee restore them their daughter; but they are (in a manner) deafe to her requests, and so only returne her this generall answer, that they will again examine their son, and cause all their tenants houses neer about to be narrowly searched for her and this is all the redresse and consolation which this sorrowfull mother could get from them; Whereof Quatbrisson being advertised, he (with much secrecie and haste) about midnight, causeth Pierot his Fathers Miller, to fetch Marieta away from his Nurses house to his Mill, which is some quarter of a League from his Fathers house, the which accordingly Pierot effecteth. The very next morning Quatbrisson goes secretly to the Mill and visits her; he informes her how her parents have incensd his against him, and against her-selfe likewise, he bids her be of good comfort, that shee shall want nothing, that hee will very shortly procure her a better lodging, and provide both for her safety and reputation, and so continually frollickes it out, and there takes his pleasure of her; yea, he lyes so often with her many whole nights and some dayes at this Mill, that, at last her belly swells, and both of them apparantly perceive that shee is with child by him: when poore soule, seeing her selfe as it were pent up in a prison, that she had no new Apparell, nor was towards any Husband; yea looking backe into the foulnesse, of her fault, and seeing that she had made her selfe the griefe of her Father and Mother, the laughter of the world, and almost the contempt and disdaine of Quatbrisson , who (surfetting in his pleasures with her) beganne now to looke lesse familiar, and more strange to her then accustomed, shee with many sighes and teares repents her selfe of her errour; but how to remedie it, she knowes not. As for Quatbrisson , hee supposing he had his Fathers Miller Pierot at his command, profereth him two hundred French Crownes to marry her; whereat this Meal-cap Miller (being a lusty young fellow of some five and twenty yeares old) could not at first refraine from blushing and laughing; when seeing Marieta to be young and faire, hee is so farre in love with her, as at first hee wisheth her to his wife; but then againe considering that shee hath a great belly by his young Master, that hee still lyes with her, and that if he should marry her, he would undoubtedly bee more Master and owner of her then himselfe, hee prayes him therefore to excuse him, for that hee is fully resolved not to marry her. When Quatbrisson yet farther desirous to draw him to take her to his wife, profereth Pierot a new Lease and Estate of his Mill from his Father for seven yeares, at his owne cost and charges. But this Miller (being a pleasant joviall wag) tells his young Master that hee had rather never heare the clacking of his Mill, then to live to see himselfe cornuted; and so upon no tearmes will marry Marieta , but for any other service, hee sweares to him, that he is, and ever will bee wholly at his command. Poore Marieta now seeing her hopes grow small, and her belly great, and consequently her joyes decline, and her sorrowes increase, finding that she is now rather Quatbrissons prisoner then his prize, and the Miller rather her Goaler then her Landlord, shee (with many farre fetcht sighs and brinish teares) very passionatly beseecheth Quatbrisson on her knees, that he will speedily either provide her a husband, or permit her with her shamefull and sorrowfull burthen to returne home to her afflicted and angry parents. Two requests and both so reasonable (quoth she to him) as if it be not in your power to grant me the first, yet I hope it will be your pleasure not to deny me the second. But Quatbrisson , notwithstanding all these teares and prayers of Marieta , he is still so vexed, as well with her importunity, as with the sharp complaints of his own parents, and the bitter lamentations and outcries of hers, that (in the heat of sottish choller and ingratefull disdaine) he flies from her, absents himselfe longer then accustomed, and thenceforth (by degrees) beginnes as much to loath her, as hee formerly loved her. Marieta perceiving this his unexpected and ingratefull unkindnesse towards her, it pierceth her very heart with griefe, and her soule with despaire; Shee requests the Miller to tell Monsieur de Quatbrisson that she prayes him to see her, or to permit her to see him; but hee perceiving that his young Master slighted her, and that his hot affection was by this time waxed cold and frozen to her, hee refuseth to goe himselfe, and so sends his boy: But what doth this importunity of hers procure or effect with Quatbrisson , but onely the more inflame his choller, and therein the more increase her owne sorrowes, and accelerate and hasten on her miseries: For he bids the boy tell her, that he is gone to Rennes , and will not returne in a moneth; and withall, he wills him to bid his Master to come secretly to him in the morning, at his Fathers Orchard. So if Quatbrissons unkindnesse to Marieta formerly made her seeme to bee the picture of sorrow, Ahlas, now this his discourteous departure, and disdayning either to see her, or once bid her farewell, makes her really to bee sorrow her selfe; for shee teares her haire, and (with a mournfull and sorrowfull Ambition) indeavoureth to drowne her selfe in the Ocean of her teares; yea, her griefes are so infinite, and her discontents so insupportable (in that she hath so deeply disobeyed her parents, and offended God with her Fornication) as the remembrance of these sinnes and crimes of hers make her not dare to looke up to heaven for assistance; a thousand times shee repents her selfe of her folly, and as often sayth and dictateth to her, that shee should be as happy as now she is miserable, if she againe were a child, and not with child, and that she were againe as living in her Mothers belly, as now by this time she findes her owne poore unfortunate innocent babe is in hers. Shee as high as heaven exclaimeth on Quatbrissons ingratitude, and curseth the name and memory of Fryer Simplician as low as hell, for thus betraying and seducing her to sinne, which hath now brought her to misery and disconsolation; yea, her unfortunacie is so great, as she cannot write for assistance from any where, or if she could, shee knowes not from whom once to expect, much lesse to receive it: but rather sees her selfe reduced to such extreme affliction and misery, that she is every way farre more capable to weep or sigh forth her sorrowes to her selfe, then to speake, or make them knowne to the world. Whiles thus Marieta is pensively and pittifully ecchoing forth her complaints to the bare walls of her poore Chamber, Pierot the Miller findes out his young Master Quatbrisson , in the Orchard behinde his Fathers house, according to his appoyntment, where betwixt this wretched and execrable couple the Reader must prepare to see them consult and conclude a most bloudy and mournfull businesse, which will both exact pitty, and command lamentation from the most flinty and barbarous heart, yea in a word, from any living mortall man, whose prophane life and impiety hath not absolutely made him a meere devill. For Quatbrisson having thus satiated and surfetted himselfe in reaping his beastly pleasures of poore Marieta , and (as before) exchanged his familiarity into malice, and his affection into envie towards her, knowing that shee will bee a perpetuall eye-sore to his parents, and a continuall shame and scandall to himselfe, as long as shee lives in this world, hee therefore most ingratefully and cruelly resolves speedily to send her into another; and no consideration whatsoever, either of her youth or beauty, of her great belly, or of his quicke childe within her, or of his owne soule, can prevaile with him to the contrary: but the Devill is so strong with him, that hee is miserably resolute not to retire, but to advance in this bloudy businesse. To which effect, hee breakes with Pierot the Miller to attempt and finish it, and againe promiseth him the Fee-simple (or at least a Lease of seven yeares) of his Mill, to finish it; which this bloudy miscreant (out of his hellish covetousnesse, and itching desire to please his young Master) promiseth to accomplish. They now consult of the manner how to murther Marieta : The Miller affirmes it to be the surest way (under some pretext) to take her into the next Wood by night, and there to murther her, which Quatbrisson contradicted, because (saith he) her dead body being found so neere his Fathers house, this her murther will reflect on him; and therefore to make sure worke, hee bids the Miller to strangle her by night in her bed, and so to bury her in his outer yard, and there to clap a Wood-vine over her: whereon they both agree. When swearing perpetuall secrecie each to other, this execrable Miller here promiseth Quatbrisson to dispatch her within three dayes at farthest. This bloody bargaine and compact being thus concluded between them, Pierot the Miller returnes to his Mill, where poore Marieta (litle suspecting or dreaming, what a dismall stratagem was plotted and resolved against her life) shee (finding comfort from no where, and therefore seeking it every where) enquires of him if he came from Monsieur de Caerstainges house, and if his Sonne Monsieur Quatbrisson were departed for Rennes , as his Mill boy had told her; who (here the better to lull her asleepe, thereby with more facility to finish his bloody designe on her) tels her that he was gone thither, but that before his departure he had left secret word for him to use her courteously in his absence, the which hee swore to her hee would carefully performe; whereat Marieta thankes him, but yet againe prying more narrowly into this Millers lookes then his speeches, shee found that he now looked more sullen and haggardly to her then accustomed, or else that either her conceit or his countenance and Physiognomy deceived her therein. But here (before I proceed further) let us remarke the strange effects, and events hereof; For as dreames prove seldome true, because they are as incertaine as their causes, which for the most part either proceed from the influence of the heart, or die slow from the operations of the braine in their different passions of affection, Envie, Hope, Feare, Ioy, Sorrow, or the like; So it pleased God that the very same night Marieta dreamt, that Pierot the Miller killed her, and threw her dead body into the Pond; the which remembring the next morning, shee likewise remembred to acquaint him therewith, who vild wretch and dissembling Hypocrite) seemed to bee in choller thereat, vowing and swearing to her with many oathes and deprecations, that shee was and should be as safe in his Mill, as if shee were either in the Tower of Blyn , or the Castle of Blavet , which indeed are reputed to be two of the strongest and most important peeces of little Britany ; where a poore Marieta againe and againe thankes him. But this notwithstanding, I now here tremble to report, that the very next ensuing night ( Marieta proving too true a Herauld and Prophetesse, to her owne immediate mournfull Tragedy) as the night had given truce to her teares, and sleepe administred rest to her eyes, as shee lay in her poore pallet bed, then this bloody villaine Pierot the Miller very secretly enters her Chamber, and softly convaies a small cord under her head, and fastning it to her further bed poast (his strength conspiring with his malice) hee then and there strangles her dead, giving her neither the power or time to cry, much lesse to speake one word, and as soone as this Agent of Hell had bereaved her (and consequently the fruit of her wombe) of life, hee within lesse then an houre after (not to give the lye to her owne dreame) changeth his purpose in the manner of her buriall, and so (in her clothes as she was) carries her to his little Mill-boat in the Pond, where fastning a great peece of an old broken Mill-stone to her middle (or waste) by a strong new rope which he had purposely provided, hee there throwes her into the deepest place of his Pond, hoping, yea assuring himselfe, that he should never see nor heare more of her. The very next morning after the finishing of this deplorable fact, Pierot the Miller (not able to sleepe for joy) at the very breake of day, despeeds himselfe away with the newes hereof to his young Master Quatbrisson , who heares and receives it with much content and joy, when (by his promise and oath againe assuring the Miller of his Mill) he the better to beare, and wipe off the suspicion which this Murther might reflect or cast on him (if it should ever hereafter come to be detected or discovered) rides away bothe Citie of Rennes , where the States Generall of that Province (which we in England terme our Parliament) was then to assemble, where rejoycing that hee had so happily dispatched his clownish Strumpet Marieta ; and Pierot the Miller at home likewise singing and triumphing at this his easie purchase of his Mill, they not so much as once looke up to Heaven and God, or downe to their owne consciences and soules, what this soule and detestable Murther of theirs deserves. And not to goe farre, by this time the Lord thinks it high time, to bring this their cruell Murther to light, by a strange (I may justly say by a miraculous) accident, which at unawares and when they least thinke thereof, will (amidst their mirth and security) befall them. A moneth is not full past over since this murther of Marieta , but God (in his sacred mercie and justice) is now resolved to make Monsieur de Pont Chausey (La Pratieres second Husband) to be the first meanes for the detection hereof (and in that likewise afterwards of the poysoning of Valfontaine ) who being one day at Vannes with three other Gentlemen, his friends, hee is desirous to hunt a Ducke with two of his owne Spaniels; And no Pond being so fit or neere as that of Monsieur de Caerstaignes , he makes choise thereof, but the Ducke is no sooner in the Pond, and the Dogs after her, but these two poore harmelesse curs swimming eagerly for their prey, as they come to the place where Marieta's dead body was suncke and tied, they instantly forsake and abandon the Ducke, and there pudling with their feet, and snuffling with their noses in the water, they most lamentably set up their tunes, and aloud houle and barke each at other, without departing or stirring thence, the which Pont Chausey and the other Gentlemen well observing, God instantly inspires their conceipts with this apprehension, and their hearts with this jealousie; that (peradventure) there was some body, either accidently or purposely drowned there, and that it now pleased his divine Majestie to make these two poore dogs his Agents and Officers to discover it, whereupon they once resolve to draw up the sluce, and to let out all the water of the Pond, but first they resolve to make another triall and experiment hereof, so for that time they take up their Ducke, depart, and call away their Spaniels, but after dinner they returne, and the Ducke being againe put in, the Spaniels in the very same place doe the like as in the morning, still howling and barking most lamentably, the which indeed yeelds harsh and displeasing musicke to the trembling heart and guilty conscience of this murderous Miller, but still the Devill his Schoole-master makes him put a brazen face on his feare. Now this second action and demeanor of the Spaniels, confirmes the first jealousie and apprehension of Pont Chausey and his associats, who (to vindicate this truth) are now resolute in their former proposition, and desire of letting out the water of the Pond, the which they attempt to effect: But then this wretched Miller seeing himselfe now so narrowly put to his trumps and shifts, and therefore knowing it high time to prevent them, at least if he meane to provide for his owne safety and life; hee with many humble and sugred speeches (not seeming any way to take notice of their apprehension) tels them, that he is a poore young man, that this is his first yeare of setting up his Trade of a Miller for himselfe, that it being now in the midst of a hot and dry Summer, his Pond will not receive in water againe for his Mill to goe in a weeke or two after, which will infallibly begger him, and therefore (almost with teares) he beseecheth them to desist from their purpose, and not to turne out the water of his Pond, yea he speakes so passionatly and pittifully to them, as his reasons prevaile with the three other Gentlemen, but with Pont Chausey they cannot, but rather the more confirme his former apprehension and beliefe, that sure there was some one or other drowned, and withall God doth fresh distill and infuse into his imaginations, that this very Miller himselfe might have some hand therein, notwithstanding all his humble prayers and smooth speeches to the contrary: To which end Pont Chausey the better to effect his desire and resolution, hee (as a wise and discreet Gentleman) grants the Miller his request, when purposely sending away his Servants, Ducke and Dogs, hee enquires of the Miller if he have any dice or cards in his Mill, who answereth him that he hath cards, but no dice: So into the Mill they all fower goe, and play at Lansknight for Cartdescus, and the Miller (now ravished with Ioy to see how his faire tongue hath kept the water in his Pond) is wonderfull diligent to waite, and officious to attend them and their commands. But they having played an houre, Pont Chausey now thinkes it high time for him to effect his designe and resolution, and then tels Pierot the Miller, that he is very dry and thirsty, demanding of him if there bee any wine to sell neere his Mill, who tels him there is none neerer then the Towne, where hee willingly profereth to goe and fetch some speedily, which indeed is that very part and point whereat Pont Chausey only aimed: So hee gives him money to fetch two grand pots of wine, when this inconsiderate and secure Miller (without either feare or wit) seemes rather to fly then to run to the Towne with Ioy for it, thinking and assuring that the storme of his danger was now already quite past and blowen over; but he is no sooner out of sight, but Pont Chausey presently throwes up the Cards, and prayes the rest of the Gentlemen to assist him in drawing up the sluce and emptying the Pond, for that his heart still prompts him there is some one drowned therein, whereunto they all give free consent; so by that time the water is halfe out, Loe (with much admiration and pitie) they behold a dead body floating therein, and yet fastned with a rope to the bottome of the Pond. And prying more narrowly to discerne it, they (by the coats it wore) perceived it to be a woman, whom they cause to be taken up in the Mill-boat, but her flesh is so riveld and withered with the water, and eaten and disfigured by the fish, as it was impossible to know what she was, and she stunke so odiously, as almost none durst approach her. Pont Chausey (and his associats) seeing this wofull and lamentable spectacle, and comparing therewith the Millers earnest refusall, not to permit them to empty his Pond, he here confirmes his former jealousie, and now confidently suspects him, either to be the Author or Actor of this cruell murther; To which end her and his associats lay exact and curious waite for his returne with the wine; who comming therewith from the Towne merrily singing, and not so much as once dreaming what had hapned at the Pond, hee ascending the top of the Hill by the Woods side, and espying his Pond emptied, then the foulnesse of his fact and conscience, and the eminencie of his danger doth so terrifie and amaze him, that he sets downe his pots of wine on the ground, and (committing his safety to the celerity and swiftnesse of his heeles) he with all possible speed runs away towards the centre of the Wood; the which Pont Chausey and the rest of the Gentlemen espying, they need no other evidence but this his flight, to proclaime himselfe guilty of this murther, and so they speedily send after him, and within one houre after he is found out, apprehended and brought backe; they vehemently accusing, and he as resolutely excusing himselfe of this murther; but notwithstanding they shut him up close in his own Mill, till it be found out what this drowned murdered woman is. The report of this mournfull accident being speedily divulged in Vannes , and bruted in the neighbour parishes, there are a world of people, who from all parts flocke to the Pond, to bee spectators of this dead woman; and among the rest, Yvon Malliot and his wife Iane Chaumet , no sooner understand hereof, but knowing it to be a woman, and drowned in Monsieur de Caerstaings Pond, they exceedingly feare it is their Daughter Marieta , and to see the issue and truth hereof she runs before, and hee limpes after as fast as he can, as if they should not come time enough to make themselves miserable, with the fight and object of their misery. Now they are no sooner arrived to the Pond, but they see all the people stand aloofe from this murthered corpes, because of the stinch thereof; but they (hardned by their feare, and encouraged by their affection) doe willingly rush towards it, but cannot as yet discerne what she was, by reason the fishes had almost eaten away all the flesh from her bones, which therefore no way satisfying their curiosity and enquirie, they then fall to wash away the mud and oze from her clothes, hoping to draw some information and light from them, as alas they now instantly doe, for they find the Wast-coat and two Petty-coats, that of ash colour serge, and these of greene and red bayes to be the very same which their Daughter Marieta wore, when she either fled, or was stolen from them; whereat crossing their armes, and sending their sighes to heaven, and their teares to earth, this poore afflicted Father and Mother cry out that it was the dead body of their faire and unfortunate Daughter Marieta , and doubtlesse, that either Monsieur Quatbrisson or Pierot the Miller, or both of them were her Murtherers; whereat all the people admire and wonder, every one speaking thereof as their severall fancies led them, and as they stood affected, or disaffected to Quatbrisson , and the Miller. But Pont Chausey rides presently to Vannes (leaving the other three Gentlemen his friends to guard the Miller in his mill) and advertiseth the Seneshall, and the other two Iudges of this deplorable fact; so they send for this Miller to Vannes , and the next day being brought before them, they examine and accuse him for thus murthering of Marieta , but (having learnt his answer and resolution of the Devill) hee with many bitter oathes and curses denies it, deposing and swearing that he never knew her nor saw her; but this false answer and counterfeit coine of his will no way passe current with his Iudges, but they forthwith ordaine him to the Racke. Our wretched Miller Pierot is amazed and terrified at the fight hereof, yea now his courage begins to faile him, as fearing it to be the true Prologue, and fatall Harbinger to his death; so he endures the single torment reasonable well, but feeling the pinches and tortures of the second, and well knowing that his heart, Ioints, and patience can never endure it, hee then and there confesseth to his Iudges, that he was the only Author and Actor of this murther, and that he strangled her in his Mill, and then suncke her in his Pond, because she would never consent or yeeld to be his wife, but speakes not a word of Quatbrisson , or that hee had any way seduced or hired him to commit it; but fed his exorbitant thoughts and erroneous hopes with the ayre of this vaine beleefe, That when he was condemned to die here in Vannes , that hee would then appeale thence to the Court of Parliament of Rennes , where he knew his young master Quatbrisson then was, and where he presumed he had so many great and noble friends, as he should not need to feare his life: But (contrary to these his weake and poore hopes) the very next morning when hee expected to heare the sentence of death pronounced against him, his Iudges againe adjudge him to the torments of the Scarpines, to know if Monsieur Quatbrisson , or any other were accessary with him in this murther, when they cause his left foote to be burnt so soundly, as hee will not endure to have his right touched, and so confesseth that his young master Quatbrisson seduced and hired him to strangle Marieta in her bed in his Mill, and promised him the Fee Simple or Lease thereof to performe it, that he it was who likewise threw her into the Pond, and that he also beleeves she was quick with child by his said master. All Vannes wonder and talke of Quatbrissons base ingratitude and cruelty, towards this silly and harmelesse young countrey maiden Marieta , yea this foule and lamentable murther, administreth likewise talke in all the adjoyning Townes and Parishes; So this execrable Miller Pierot is by the Seneshall condemned to be broken alive on the Wheele, but yet (in regard of the necessitie of his confrontation) they deferre his execution till Quatbrisson be apprehended in Rennes , where the Seneshall, and Kings Atturney Generall of Vannes , doe by post send away his accusation to that famous Court of Parliament; where whiles hee is prauncing in the streets of that Citie on his great Horse, and ruffling in his scarlets and sattins, with three Lackies (richly clad) at his heeles, the height of this his pompe and bravery makes his shame the more apparant, and his crime the more foule and notorious; For then when he thought himselfe to bee farthest from danger, loe the Iustice and Providence of God brings him neerest to it; for hee is now here by a band of Huysiers (or Pursevants) taken off from his horse, apprehended and imprisoned by the command of the Lieutenant Criminall of that great Court, who yet vainely reposing on the fidelitie and secrecie of Pierot his Fathers Miller, hee seemes to be no way dismaid or daunted thereat; But when he heares his accusation and enditement read, that Marieta's murthered body was found in the Pond, that Pierot the Miller was apprehended and imprisoned for the same, and that he had confessed him to bee the Author, and himselfe the Actor of this her cruell murther, then I say hee is so appalled and daunted, and so farre from any hope of life, as he utterly despaires thereof, and palpably sees the Image of death before his eyes: When (with a few teares, and many sighes) he here to his Iudges confesseth himselfe to be the Author of this foule fact, and so begs pardon thereof of God; for from these his grave and incorruptible Magistrates hee is assured and confident to find none; Whereupon although foure of the Councellors, and one of the Presidents, were resolved in regard of this his inhumane and base crime, to have him hanged, yet the rest of that wise and honourable Senate, knowing him to bee Sonne and Heire to a very ancient Gentleman, nobly descended, they ore sway and prevaile with the others, and so they adjudge him the very next day to have his head cut off, although this his sorrowfull aged Father Monsieur de Caerstainge , offred the one halfe of his lands to save his life, and likewise was a most importunate Suppliant to the Duke of Tremoville (who then and there preceded at the Estates for the Nobility) to intercede with that Parliament for his reprivall, and with the King for his pardon, but in vaine; For that noble Duke (considering the basenesse and enormity of this his inhumane fact) was too wise to attempt the one, and too honourable and generous to seeke the other. So the very next morning Quatbrisson (apparalled in a sute of blacke Sattin, trimmed with gold Lace) is brought to the Scaffold (at the common place of execution, which is in the midst of the Citie) where a very great concourse of people of all sorts, resort and flocke to see him take his last farewell of this world, of whom the greatest part and number, lamented and pittied, that so proper and noble a Gentleman, should first deserve, and then receive so untimely death: When after the Priests and Friers have here prepared and directed his soule, hee ascending the Scaffold, with some what a low voice, and dejected and sorrowfull countenance, he delivered this short speech. That in regard hee knowes, that (now when he is to take his last leave of this life) to charge his conscience with the concealing of any capitall crime, is the direct and true way to send his soule to hell in stead of heaven, hee will now therefore reveale, that hee is yet more execrable and bloudy, then his Iudges thinke or know, or his spectatours imagine, for that he not only hired Pierot his Fathers Miller to murther Marieta , but also the Apothecary Moncallier to poyson his owne brother Valfontaine ; of both which foule and bloudy crimes of his, he now freely confesseth himselfe guilty, and now from his heart and soule sorrowfully lamenteth and repenteth them; that his filthy lust and inordinate affection to women was the first cause, and his neglect of prayer to God the second, which hath justly brought him to this shamefull end and confusion; that therefore he beseecheth all who are present to bee seriously forewarned of the like by his wofull Example, and that (in Christian charity) they will now joyne their devout prayers with his to God for his soule: When on the Scaffold praying a little whiles silently to himselfe kneeling, and then putting off his Doublet, hee commits himselfe to the Executioner; who at one blow severed his head from his shoulders. But this punishment and death of Quatbrisson suffiseth not now to give full content and satisfaction to his Iudges, who (by his owne confession) considering his inhumane and deplorable poysoning of his owne brother Valfontaine , they as soone as hee is dead, and before he be cold, adjudge his body to bee taken downe, and there burnt to Ashes at the foot of the Gibbet, which accordingly is performed. And here our thoughts and curiosity must now returne poast from Rennes to Vannes , and from wretched Quatbrisson to the base and bloudy Miller Pierot , whom God and his Iudges have now ordayned shall likewise smart for this his lamentable murther on poore and harmelesse Marieta . Hee is brought to the Gallowes in his old dusty mealy Suite of Canvas, where a Priest preparing him to dye, hee (either out of impiety, or ignorance, or both) delivereth this idle speech to the people, That because Marieta was young and faire, hee is now heartily sorry that he had not married her, and that if he had beene as wise as covetous, the two hundred Crownes, or the Lease of his Mill, which his yong master Monsieur Quatbrisson profered him, might have made him winke at her dishonesty, and that although she were not a true Mayd to her selfe, yet that she might have proved a true and honest wife to him, with many other frivolous words and lewd speeches tending that way; which I purposely omit, and resolve to passe over in silence, as holding them unworthy either of my relation, or the Readers knowledge: when not having the grace once to name God, to speake of his soule, to desire heaven, or to seeme to bee any way repentant and sorrowfull for this his bloody offence, hee is stripped naked, having onely his shirt fastned about his waste, and with an Iron barre hath his legs, thighes, armes, and brest, broken alive, and there his miserable body is left naked and bloudy on the Wheele, for the space of two dayes, thereby to terrifie and deterre the beholders from attempting the like wretched crime. And the Iudges of Vannes being certifyed from the Court of Parliament at Rennes , that Quatbrisson at his death charged the Apothecary Moncallier to have (at his hiring and instigation) poysoned his brother Valfontaine , they hold the Church to be too holy a place for the body and buriall of so prophane and bloudy a Villaine: When after well neere a whole yeares time that he was buried in Saint Francis Church in that Towne, they cause his Coffin to be taken up, and both his body and it to bee burnt by the common Hang-man, and his Ashes to bee throwne into the aire; Which to the Ioy of all the Spectators is accordingly performed. GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND EXECRABLE Sinne of Murther .  Vasti first murthereth his Sonne George , and next poysoneth his owne Wife Hester , and being afterwards almost killed by a mad Bull in the Fields, hee revealeth these his two murthers, for the which he is first hanged, and then burnt.  Sinne so odious and execrable as Murther; for it being contrary to Nature and Grace, the very thought, much more the act thereof, strikes horrour to their hearts and consciences. Wherefore, if this foule and bloudy Sinne bee so displeasing to godly men, how infinitely more detestable is it then to God himselfe, who made all living creatures to serve Man, and onely created Man purposely to serve Himselfe; But as Choller and Malice proceede from the passions of men, so doth Murther from the Deuill; for else wee should not so often and frequently see it perpetrated in most Countryes and Cities of the World as we doe: A mournefull Example whereof I here produce to your view and serious consideration. ) which gives name to one of the Divisions (or Cantons) of that famous and warlike country; Wherein (of fresh memory) dwelt a rich Burger named Peter Vasti , who had to his wife a modest, discreet, and vertuous woman named Hester , by whom he had one only child, a Sonne called George Vasti , whom God sent them the latter end of the first yeare of their marriage; and for the tearme of some ten yeares following, this marryed couple lived in most kinde and loving sort each with other, yea their hearts and inclinations so sympathized in mutuall and interchangeable affection, as they held and reputed none of their Neighbours so rich in content as themselves; for she was carefull of her Family, and he very diligent and industrious to maintaine it; both of them being chaste and continent in themselves, very religious towards God, and exceeding charitable, affable, and courteous to all their Neighbours and Acquaintance, onely they are so temperate in their drinking, as hee would not, and shee could not bee tainted with that beastly Vice of Drunkennesse, whereunto that Countrey, and the greatest part of that People, are but too excessively addicted and subject: So that had Vasti still imbraced and followed those Vertues in the course and conduction of his life, hee had not then defiled this History with the profusion of so many sinnes, nor besprinckled it with the effusion of so much innocent bloud, nor consequently have administred so much sorrow to the Reader, in perusing and knowing it: but as contrary Causes produce contrary Effects, so he (by this time) polluting himselfe with filthy and pernicious Company, it is no marvell if he leave his temperancie to follow drunkennesse, his chastity to commit fornication and adultery; yea, it is no marvell I say, if these foule sins (as Bawds to rage and revenge) exact such power in his heart, and predominancie in his soul, as in the end to draw him to murther: for goodmen cannot receive a greater plague, nor the Devill afford or give them a worse pestilence, then bad company. It is the fatall Shelves, and dismall Rocks, whereon a world of people have, and doe daily suffer shipwracke; yea, it is the griefe of a Kingdome and Countrey, the bane of our Age, and the corruption and poyson of our Times: for it turnes those who professe and pursue it, out of their estates and homes, which they are then inforced either to sell, or rather to give away to Vsurers and Cormorants, and consequently which makes themselves, and their poore wives and children ready to starve and dye in our streets. So this is now the cause of our Vasti , and therefore it will be his happinesse, if it prove not his misery hereafter; for after twelve yeares time of a most peaceable cohabitation, and Godly conversation betweene him and his vertuous wife Hester , it is a thousand griefes and pitties that she must now be inforced to see so brutish and beastly a Metamorphosis in her husband; for hee is no more the man which hee was, nor the husband which shee formerly found him to bee. Hee loves neither his house nor his wife, but stayes abroad every day with his whores, and then at night returnes home to her starke drunke, and in lamentable sort reviles and beats her, whereas heretofore he would rather have lost his life then have strucken her, and whereas heretofore he affected and loved her so dearely, as he thought he could not be kinde enough to her, now (in the extravagancie of these his deboshed humours) he hates her so deadly as he deemes and supposeth hee cannot be sufficiently cruell to her, although her affection be still so fervent to him, and her care so vigilent and respectfull of him, as shee gives him nothing but either sweet words, teares, sighs, silence, or prayers; yea, shee proves her selfe so good a woman to so bad a man, and so courteous and vertuous a wife to so unkinde and vitious a husband, as to the eyes and judgements of all their kinsfolkes and neighbours, they know it is now her praise and glory, and feare it will hereafter prove his shame and misery. She leaves no meanes unassayed, or invention unsought and unattempted, to divert and turne this foule inundation of his Vice into the sweet streames of Vertue, and the pure rivers of Godlinesse: But Ahlas good woman, her care proves vaine, and her affection and zeale impossible herein, although her pale cheekes, mournefull eyes, brinish teares, far-fetcht sighs, religious prayers, and sweet perswasions, doe still second and accompany her indeavours in this her desired hope of his reformation; for she is inforced to know that hee keepes a young strumpet, named Salyna , at the Towne of Cleraux , some sixe Leaugues from Fribourg , whither most mornings hee goes to her, and to make himselfe the more treacherous a dissembler to his wife, and the more execrable a traytor to his soule, he fortifyeth and coloureth out this his accustomed journey to his strumpet with this false Apologie, that he goes to Cleraux to heare the Sermons of M  r Abraham Tifflin , a very famous and religious Preacher there, when God and his ulcerated soule and conscience know the contrary, and that this pretended excuse of his is but only a false cloak to overvail his true Adultery, and prophane Impiety: for he needed not to have formerly added Whordom to his Drunkennesse, and now Ingratitude, Cruelty, and Impiety to his Whordome, in regard the least of these enormous crimes and sinnes assuredly have the power, and will infallibly finde the meanes to make him futurely as miserable, as now he foolishly thinkes himselfe happy; for these his journeyes to Cleraux are onely the Pilgrimage of his wanton Lust. Salyna is the Saint of his voluptuous devotion, her House the Temple of his obscene wishes, and Adultery the Oblation and Sacrifice of his lascivious desires. Wee can difficulty make our selves guilty of a fouler sinne on earth, then to seeme sanctifyed in our devotions towards God, when we are prophane, or to indeavour to appeare sound without, when we are rotten within in our Faith and Religion: For as Man is the best and noblest of all Gods creatures, so an Hypocrite towards God is the worst of men, yea or rather a Devill and no man; for our hearts and actions, and our most retired thoughts, and secret darling sinnes, are as conspicuous and transparant to Gods eyes, as his decrees and resolutions are invisible to ours, sith he sees all things, and we see nothing when we doe not see him. A miserable hight of impiety, in making of our selves foolishly sinners, and wilfully Hypocrites, and yet it is a more fatall and fearefull degree thereof, when we so delight in sinne and glory in hypocrisie, as to make Apologies for the same. But Vasti not thinking either of Religion or God, frolicks it out with Salyna his strumpet in Cleraux , whiles his owne vertuous wife Hester weepes at home at Fribourg , and when he returnes thence, hee is still so hard hearted and cruell to her, as he continually beates her. Now by this time George their Sonne is sixteene yeares of age, of a mans courage and stature, and of a very pregnant wit; so that as young as he is, hee hath beene long enough a sorrowfull eye-witnesse of his Fathers cruelty, in beating of his Mother; Hee hath formerly seene the lamentable effects, and now he falls on his knees to her, and (with teares and prayers) beseecheth her to acquaint him with the true cause thereof, and from whence it proceeds; when his Mother (adding more confidence to his wisedome then to his youth) from point to point fully relates it to him, accordingly as we have formerly understood, George bursts forth into sorrowfull passions at her repetition, and his knowledge hereof, as not able to refraine from sighing to see her sigh, nor from weeping to see her weepe; Hee as much grieves to be the Sonne of so vicious a Father, as he rejoyceth and gloryeth to be that of so vertuous a Mother, so he makes her sorrowes his, and here weds himselfe to her quarrell (with promise and oath) either to right it with his Father, or to revenge it on Salyna , whom he knowes to be the originall cause of all these stormes and tempests, of all these afflictions and miseries which befall his Mother, and in her himselfe: He will no longer bee a child, because God and nature hath now made him a man; so the very next time hee sees his Father beate his Mother hee stops to her assistance, and defends her from the tyrannie of his blowes, and then advanceth so farre, as hee performes it with an unwilling willing resistance of him, the which his Father takes extremely ill and chollerickly from him, gives him sharpe words, and menaceth him with bitter blowes. George his Sonne, first returnes him a briefe rehearsall of the wrongs and indignities he still offereth to his Mother, when protesting of his obedience to him, he yet tels him, that he is willing to entertaine his words, but no longer capable to digest and receive his blowes, adding withall (as a passionate Corolary) that ere long he will visit his Strumpet Salyna in Cleraux , and make her feele a part of her base carriage, and ill deservings, both towards his Mother and himselfe: Vasti is much astonished at this audacity and boldnesse of his Sonne, but farre more to heare him name and threaten Salyna , the very thought of which his speeches grates him to his heart, and grieves him to his soule, so he puts water in his wine, holds it for that time a vertue, to be no longer stormy but calme, and then (chollerickly threatning him with his finger) he departs to his Chamber, leaving his Wife and his Sonne consulting in the Parlour, how (with most assurance, and least scandall) they may provide for their affaires. The next morning, Vasti his Father keepes his bed, and gives order, that neither his Wife or Sonne have admittance to him, the which discourtesie of his, gives his Sonne a fresh and strong motive, to revive his last nights discontent against his Father, and his choller against Salyna , when bidding his Mother the good morrow, and craving her blessing, he (purposely) frames an excuse to leave her till she be ready, and so very privately takes horse, and that morning acts a busines, every way worthy of himselfe, and indeed farre more worthy of laughture, then of our pitty. For it is not so much his malice to Salyna , as his affection to his Mother Hester , which carries him and his resolution to Cleraux ; where entring Salyna's house; he (with fire in his lookes and thunder in his speeches) cals her whore and strumpet, chargeth her for abusing his Father, and in him his Mother and himselfe. His choller cannot retaine his patience, to heare her false answers and apologies to the contrary, but disdaining as much to use his sword on a woman, as to foule it on a strumpet, hee takes his mans short cudgell, and gives her at least a dosen blowes on her backe, armes and shoulders therewith, seriously vowing and swearing to her; That if she forsake not his Fathers company, and use the meanes that henceforth he doe utterly abandon hers, hee will shortly give her so bitter a payment and requitall, as hee will hardly leave her either the will or power to thanke him for his courtesie, and so remounts his horse, and presently gallops home to his Mother, whom hee acquaints therewith, but yet conceales it from his Father, whereat she seemes not to be a little joyfull, and yet heartily prayeth to God, that this breed no bad blood in her husband, or prove either an incitation to his choller against her selfe, or a propension of revenge against their Sonne. But this joy of Hester and her Son George , proves the sighes and teares of Salyna , who not accustomed to receive such sharpe payment, and usage from any mans hands whosoever, it makes her extreme chollericke and vindictive, so that her stomacke is so great, and her heart so highly and imperiously lodged, that she will not suffer this cruell affront offered her by George Vasti , to goe unrequited; but yet she will be as advised and secret in her revenge towards him, as hee was rash and publicke in his towards her. To which end and purpose, seeing that Vasti his Father came not to her that day (whereby she judged hee was wholly ignorant what had befallen her from his Sonne) she that night writes him a short Letter, and the next morning sends it home to Fribourg to him, by a confident messenger of hers, who arriving there and finding him pensively walking in his Garden, hee respectfully delivered it to him, who breaking up the seales thereof, found it spake thus.  pray and conjure you to leave Fribourg , and come over to me with haste and expedition to Cleraux , because I have a great and important secret to reveale you, which equally concernes us, and which I dare not to commit to pen and paper; for that the relation and knowledge should neede no other witnesses but our selves. If you any may neglect this my advise, or deny, or deferre this my request, the griefe will bee mine now, but the prejudice and repentance yours hereafter. I write you these few lines with infinite affliction and sorrow, which nothing can deface but your sight, nor remedy but your presence, and when you come to mee, prepare your bears and resolution, to receive it from mee, with farre more teares then kisses. Salyna.  This letter of hers doth so nettle Vasti with apprehension and feare, that his Son George hath offered her some violence and out-rage, as he is almost as soone in Cleraux as he is out of Fribourg , where his Mistris Salyna very passionatly and chollerickly informes him of his Sonnes cruelty towards her, and (to adde the more efficacie to her speeches, the more power to her complaints, and the more oyle to the fire of his anger and revenge) she forgets not to paint out to him (in all their colours) the number of his Sonnes blowes, and the nature and quality of his threats given her, when watering her words with her teares, she sweares, that if he speedily doe not right and revenge these her wrongs upon his said Sonne, she will never kisse, or see him more. Vasti takes these speeches from Salynas tongue, and placeth them in his owne heart; yea he hereat is so chollerickly intended towards his Sonne, and so sottishly affected to her, as consulting with rage, but not with reason, and with Sathan, not with God, hee (to exhale her teares, and so to give consolation to her sorrowes) tels her; That hee loves her so tenderly and constantly, as he will not faile to kill his Sonne for this incivill and inhumane fact of his towards her. Salyna is amazed and astonished at this his unnaturall resolution to his Sonne, the which (as vicious as she is) shee abhors and condemnes in him as soone as understands. So she tels him plainely, that albeit she have given him her heart and body, yet that she is not so exempt of grace, or so wretchedly instructed in Piety, as to take away her soule from God, and therefore that although she bee guilty of Adultery, yet shee will never bee of Murther; so in religious termes (worthy of an honester woman then her selfe) shee powerfully seekes to disswade him from this bloody and unnaturall attempt, as well to prevent their future wrongs and feares, as to secure their dangers and reputations, and so prayes him to seeke out some other remedy and requitall towards his Sonne, the which hee promiseth her, and seales it with some oathes and many kisses, stayes and dines with her, and immediatly takes horse and rides homewards. His Sonne George finding his Father ridden forth, and being ascertained that hee was gone to Cleraux , to his strumpet Salyna , where she would acquaint him at full with his beating of her, he fearing his choller, holds it more discretion then disobedience in him, to take his sword with him for his defence; when choosing a good horse out of the stable, he deemes it more secure and lesse dangerous to meet his Father halfe way, betwixt Cleraux and Fribourg , and there in the open field to expect and attend what he had to say to him. Vasti seeing his Sonne George a farre off come riding towards him, with his sword by his side, hee much marvelleth thereat, when well knowing his courage and valour, and that (as young as hee was) he had lately at Shafouse acquitted himselfe of a Duell to his honour and reputation, hee therefore resolves to make it a tongue and not a sword quarrell with him, and so they meet; George doing his duty to his Father with his hat off, and his Father speaking not angerly but mildly to him; Their meddow conference which they then and there had betwixt them was thus. Fa. What reason hadst thou so cruelly to beat poore Salyna ? So. A thousand times more then you have to beat my Mother Hester . Fa. Tell me why. So. The reason is just and pertinent, because that is your lascivious whore, and this your chaste and vertuous wife. Fa. What hast thou gotten by this thy rash choller in beating her? So. Not by farre so much as you have lost by your sottish lust in kissing her. Fa. It is thy Mothers jealousie which hath sowne and scattered these untruths in thy beliefe. So. I pray excuse me, for they are palpable and apparant truths, and such as it is wholly impossible either for your hypocrisie or policie to root thence. Fa. Since when becamest thou so sawcie and peremptory? So. From that very time I first understood you were become so vicious. Fa. I have a mad Sonne in thee. So. It were a great happinesse both for my Mother and my selfe, if you proved a tamer Husband to her, and an honester Father to me. Fa. If thou follow those courses, to love thy Mother better then my selfe, I vow I will wholly disinherit thee. So. If you follow these courses, to love Strumpets better then my Mother, I sweare you will shortly consume all your estate, and disinherit your selfe first. Fa. This word Strumpet is very rife in thy mouth. So. I wish to God that the thing were not so frequent in your heart. Fa. Wilt thou be friends with Salyna , and reconcile thy selfe to her? So. Yes, when I see you become an enemy to her, and a friend to my Mother, and your selfe, but not before. Fa. Why, Charity is the true marke of a Christian. So. But I assure you, so is not Adultery and Cruelty. Fa. Shall I make peace betwixt thee and Salyna? So. No, but I would make it the joy of my heart, and the glory of my life, if I might be so happy to knit  & confirm a good peace betwixt your self & my Mother. Fa. Wilt thou attempt it, if I request thee? So. I will, if you please to command me. Fa. I pray thee George doe. So. My best indeavours shall herein wayt on your desires, and dutifully follow your commands. Fa. But be carefull to make my reconciliation with thy Mother eternall. So. It can never subsist, nor prosper, if you henceforth resolve to make it temporary, because affection and amity which once receives end, had never beginning. Fa. Here I vow constantly a reformation of my life from all other women, and a perpetuall renovation of my affection to my Wife thy Mother. So. God and his Angels blesse this your conversion, and confirme this resolution in you. Fa. And God blesse thee my Sonne, for wishing and desiring it. So. I thanke you Sir, but I humbly pray you likewise to forgive and forget this my boldnesse to you in my Mothers behalfe. Fa. George , here in presence of God I cheerfully  & freely doe it from my heart So. Amen, Amen , Sir. This meddow conference thus ended betweene them, they ride home towards Fribourg , and by the way Vasti willeth and prayeth his Sonne, to finish this peace betweene him and his mother that very night, and to dispose her so effectually thereunto, as that they may make a merry supper of it, and all former differences betweene them, to be then and there ended, and for ever trampled under foot, the which George his Sonne to the best of his possible power cheerefully and joyfully promiseth him; So home they come; Vasti walkes in his Garden, and George finds out his Mother in her own Chamber, being newly risen from her prayers, wherin she was so zealous and religious as shee spent the greatest part of her time. Here George informes his Mother Hester at full, what conference had now past in the open fields betwixt him and his Father: And (in a word) he here acts his part and duty so well and discreetly, as hee leaves no art nor perswasions unattempted to draw her to this attonement with his Father. When shee at first considering the nature and quality of her husbands unkind and cruell usage to her, shee found an opposition hereof in her mind, a resistance in her will, and a reluctancy in her nature and judgement; But at last giving now her former discontent to charity, her passions to peace, her sorrowes to silence, her resolutions to religion, her anger to affection, her malice to oblivion, and her griefe unto God, she (after a briefe consultation, and a short expostulation hereof betweene them) with a cheerefull countenance thankes her Sonne for his care of her, and his affection to her herein; and so informes him, That shee (having never justly offended her husband in thought word or deed) is as willing of peace and reconciliation with him, as he can possibly desire or wish, and here to testifie it to her Sonne as well in action as words, shee would then have gone downe with him to her husband, there privately to have concluded this Christian busines betwixt them, had her Sonne not diverted her from it; For being exceeding carefull to preserve his Mothers right and reputation, he prayes her to stay, alleadging that he would presently fetch and conduct his Father to her Chamber to her, as holding it more requisite and just, that the delinquent should first see and seeke the party wronged, before the party seeke the delinquent, whereat she cannot refraine from smiling, and then bids him goe: So George descends to the Garden, and acquaints his Father with his Mothers free disposition, and cheerefull resolution to a perpetuall peace with him, whereat he seemes infinitly glad and joyfull, and so ascends her Chamber, and having saluted her, tells her, that hee is very sorrowfull and repentant for his former ill carriage and unkindnesse towards her, whereof he prayes her pardon, and constantly vowes reformation; so this his vertuous and kinde wife Hester freely forgets and forgives Vasti her husband; and then hee gives her many kisses in requitall, and bids his sonne George to provide good cheere for Supper; and the better to seale and solemnize this their reconciliation and atonement, hee bids him to invite some of their Kinsfolkes and Neighbours to bee present thereat, who were formerly acquainted with their debates and differences; where no good cheere and choice wine is wanting; So they are wonderfull frolicke, pleasant, and merry, all rejoyce at this good newes, and highly applaud their Sonne George , for his discreet carriage and care in the managing of this busines. Thus all things seeme to be fully reconciled, and here Vasti drinkes many times to his wife Hester , and shee againe to her husband with much affection and joy: When supper being ended, their guests departed, and their Sonne George having received both of their blessings, they betake themselves to their Chamber and Bed. Now (in all humane sense and reason) who would once conceive or thinke, that after this Meadow conference of Vasti to his Son George , but that this his now fable reconciliation with his wife Hester were true, and pronounced with much integrity from himselfe, with deep affection to her, and infinite zeale and devotion to God; but Ahlas nothing lesse, for here I am inforced to relate, that Vasti the same night had not laien in bed by his wife five or six houres, but she (good woman) sleeping in her innocencie, he (as a devill incarnate) was waking in his malice and revenge, and laughing in his sleeve to see how cunningly and subtilly he hath lulld asleep the courage of his Sonne with a Meadow conference, and the jealousie of his Wife with a Supper, and a few sweet words and kisses: When here againe the the Devill blowing the coles to his lust, and marshalling up his former obscene desires and resolutions, onely his body is in bed with his wife Hester , here in Fribourg , but his affection and heart is still in the bosome of his strumpet Salyna in Cleraux ; yea the Devill I say, is now both so busie and so strong with him, that (as a hellish councellour, and prodigious pen-man) he writes downe this definitive sentence in his thoughts, and fatall resolution in his heart, That Salyna he will love, and his wife Hester he cannot, and that shortly he will give so sharpe a revenge to his son George , for his disobedience towards him, and for beating of his Salyna , as she shall have no further cause to feare his cruelty, nor himselfe his courage; and because he prefers her love to his owne life (as being dangerously intangled and captivated in the snares of her youth and beauty) hee likewise resolves to write and send her a Letter the very next morning. Now judge Christian Reader, is not this like to prove a sweet reformation and reconciliation of Vasti to his wife and sonne, sith these are the sparkes which diffuse and flie out from the fire of his lust, and the fatall lines which issue forth from the Centre of his bloudy heart, and sinfull soule; for in the morning before his wife is out of her bed, hee is stirring, and writes this Letter to Salyna , which hee sends her by a trusty messenger.  contents; so if thou wilt resolve to brooke my absence, with as much patience, as I doe thine with sorrow, I shall finish it the sooner, and consequently the sooner see thee. I have met with an Accident, which I thought was wholly impossible for mee to meet with; and though at first it brought me feare and affliction, yet at length I was inforced to interpose discretion, in steed of courage, thereby to draw security out of policie, which I could not hope for out of resistance; for I must informe thee of this truth, that if my Zeale and Affection to thee had not beene of greater power and consideration then that of mine owne life, I should then with more facility and willingnesse rather have hazarded it for thy sake, then have reserved it for mine own. But the mists of those doubts are now dissipated, and the clowds of these feares blowne away; or if not, I will shortly take that order, that thou shalt have no cause to feare the one, or I to doubt the other. When I shall be so happy to see thee, I know not, but if Fortune prove propitious to my desires and wishes, my returne shall be acted with as much celerity, as it is eagerly longed for of me with Affection and Passion. Vasti.  Salyna receives this letter of Vasti with equall feare and joy; for as she was glad to hear of him and his news, so she was sorowfull, as fearing that for her sake he should imbarke himselfe in some bloudy businesse, which might proove ruinous to them both: And although her apprehension doe farre exceed her knowledge herein, yet her suspicion will give her no truce, neither can her jealousie administer any peace either to her heart or minde, before she be resolved by Vasti of the doubtfull and different truth hereof. Shee is so prophane and lascivious, as she can content her selfe to make him guilty of Fornication; but yet Religion hath left some sparkes and impressions of Piety in her, that she would still have him innocent of Revenge and Murther: to which effect, by his own messenger she returnes him this answer.  assumed the boldnesse to feare them; in which regard and consideration, finde it not strange that I now intreat you to ingrave in your heart, and imprint in your memory, that Malice is most commonly squint ey'd, and Revenge still blinde: therefore if you will not ruine our affections and fortunes, take heed that you imbrue not your heart or hand in innocent bloud; for Murther is a crying and a Scarlet sinne; which God may forgive and make white by his Mercie, but will not by his Iustice; whereof this my Letter of Advice to you shall be a witnesse betwixt God, your selfe, and mee: and therefore, as you love mee, hazard not your life for my sake, but preserve it for your owne. As it is in your will to make your stay from me as long or short as you please, so it shall be in my pleasure to judge thereof, and thereby likewise of your affection to me. I wish I could be more yours then I am, and your selfe as often in my sight and company, as I desire God prosper you in your stay, and mee in your absence. Salyna.  Vasti having thus settled his affection and affaires with Salyna , he sees with griefe that it is now almost impossible for him to see her in Cleraux , because of the vigilant and watchfull eye of his Sonne George , over himselfe and his actions here in Fribourg ; wherefore notwithstanding her wholsome and religious advice to him to beware of bloud, yet his lustfull affection to her doth so outbrave and conquer his naturall love to him, that to satisfie his inordinat concupisence, and to give content to his obscene and beastly desires, he vowes he will shortly send him to heaven in a bloudy Coffin. Now the sooner and better for him to compasse and finish this his deplorable stratagem, and unnaturall resolution against his sonne, his counsellour the Devill adviseth him that hee must for a short time make wonderfull faire weather with him, and gild over all his speeches and actions to his wife Hester , with much respect and courtesie; the which Vasti doth speedily put in practice: So for a moneth or sixe weekes time, hee sees not Salyna , but all things (to the eye of the world) goe in great peace, affection, and tranquillity betwixt Father, Mother, and Sonne. But this false sunshine will be too soone o'retaken with a dismall storme and tempest; for what religious or Christian shew soever Vasti externally makes unto them, yet although he have God in his tongue, he neverthelesse internally carries the Devill about him in his heart; so againe and againe he definitively vowes & swears to himself, that his son George shal not live but die. Thus being resolute in his bloody purpose, he likewise resolves to adde policie to his malice against him, as thinking and hoping thereby, with more facility to draw him to the lure and snare which (in his diabolicall invention) he hath ordained for his destruction, hee fills his head with the fumes and honour of military actions, inflames his courage with the generosity and dignity of a souldier, whereunto as also to travell into other Countries, he knew that this his Sonne of himselfe was already ambitiously inclined and affected. At other times hee representeth to him, to how many dammages and dangers Idlenesse is exposed and subject, and what a noble part and ornament it is in young men to learne Vertues abroad, thereby to bee the more capable to know how to practise them at home, and with what renowne and glory their Auncestors have heretofore beaten and ruined the Dukes of Burgundie , their professed enemies, and now made themselves and their country famous to the greatest Princes and Potentates of Europe , especially to the Kings of France & Spain, who these many yeares, and now likewise at present (qd. he) doe equally court our affections  & service, though not with the same or like integrity. And these, and such treacherous Lectures, doth Vasti still reade unto his sonne George , as often as he calls him into his company and presence, until at last the fame and name of a souldier, and the honour of travell, have so surprised his youthfull affection, and seizd on his ambitious resolutions, that at last hee beseecheth his Father to send him abroad, in some martiall service, or generous imployment. But the Father being as cunning as his sonne is rash and inconsiderate, suffereth himselfe of purpose to bee earnestly and frequently importuned by him to that effect; the which hee doth: When at last his Father promiseth to send him to Rome , to his Vncle Andrew Vasti , who (he saith) is a chiefe Captaine of one of the Companies of this present Pope Vrban VIII. his Guard, who was an old man, very rich, and without wife, child, or kinsman with him. George thankes his Father for this his courtesie and honour, and importuneth him againe and againe to hasten this his departure and journey to Rome to his Vncle; the which hee then firmely promiseth him: but yet the greatest difficulty hereof is, how hee may obtaine his Wifes consent to this journey of her Sonne; who at first opposeth it very strongly and passionately, as knowing her Sonne to bee her onely childe, her right arme, a great part of her selfe, the delight and joy of her life, and the prop and stay of her age. But the Father leaves his Sonne to draw and obtaine his Mothers consent, as politickely knowing and foreseeing, that the lesse himselfe, and the more his Sonne importun'd her, the sooner she would graunt it; the which indeed fell out as he expected. Onely whereas the Sonne requested to stay foure yeares abroad, his Father gave him but three, and his Mother would graunt him but two, whereunto at last both Father and Sonne were inforced to condescend; and now this cruell-hearted Father provides his courteous-natur'd sonne George a new Sute of apparell, a Horse, and Money, and resolves to accompany and bring him as farre as Turin in his journey; which courtesie of his, his Wife and Sonne take most lovingly and thankefully. The morne of George his departure comes, and because his Mother the precedent night dreamt that her Sonne should dye in this journey, she was now exceeding sorrowfull to let him goe and depart from her; but being againe fortifyed and rectifyed by the advice of her husband, and likewise vanquished by the importunate requests and praiers of her son, she bedews his cheeks with her teares, gives him much good counsell, some gold, and her blessing; and so they take leave each of other, God putting apprehension into her heart, and the Devill assurance into her husbands resolutions that shee should never see her sonne againe: And indeed I write with grief, that we shall progresse very little farther in this History, before we see her dreame verifyed, and her apprehension confirmed. The manner thus: For Vasti (being privately as resolute in his malice and revenge to his sonne, as this his sonne is innocent in not deserving it of his Father) is so farre from bringing him to Turin , as hee will not bring him as farre as Geneva , but a mile before hee comes to Losanna (where he tels his son he would lye that night) the night approaching, and in a long narrow Lane, where he saw that no earthly eye could see him (being wholly deprived of the grace and feare of God, and absolutely abandoned to Satan and Hell) as his sonne rides close before him, hee shoots him thorow the backe with his Pistoll, charged with a brace of bullets, who immediately falling dead to the ground, hee there descends his horse, and (without any remorse or pitty, as no Father, but rather as a Devill incarnate) cuts off his nose, most lamentably scarres and mangles his face, that he might not be knowne, and so takes him on his shoulders, and there throwes him into a deepe ditch or precipice, as also the saddle and bridle of his horse, and turning the horse to seek his fortune in the wide fields, hee (to provide for his safety) rides swiftly to Morges , and there very secretly busheth himselfe up, pretending to bee sicke, and eight dayes being expired (which was the prefixed time and day hee gave his wife for his returne) hee by a contrary Rode way of Rolle , and Saint Claude , arrives home to Fribourg to her, brings her word of the health of her sonne, and of the remembrance of his duty to her, and that he left him well in Turin , expecting the benefit of good company to travell up to Rome ; whereat, harmlesse loving Mother, she weepes for joy, and yet rejoyceth in weeping. And now for some ten dayes after his returne from acting his wofull and deplorable tragedy on his sonne, hee keepes a good correspondencie and decorum with his wife Hester ; but at the end thereof (soly forgetting his heart and soule, his God and his conscience, his promises and oaths, and his attonement and reconciliation) hee againe falls into the dangerous relapse of his former old Vice; Whordome and Drunkennesse; and yet counselled by a better Angell then his owne, hee forbeares to beate her, as well seeing, and now knowing, that thereby nothing redounded to him, but scandall and scorne from all his Neighbours, Friends, and Kinsfolkes. But now his lust is againe so great, and his desires so fervently lascivious towards Salyna , that in staying lesse then eight weekes, hee thinkes hee hath stayed more then seven yeares from her; when pretending another journey to his Wife, hee rides over to Cleraux to her. Salyna gives him many kisses for his welcome, and as many more for relating her that hee hath sent away his sonne George to Rome , to reside and live there: for shee being his Fathers Strumpet, her guilty and sinfull conscience made her stand in extreame feare of him; but yet amidst her kisses and pleasures with him (remembring the tenour and contents of his last Letter to her, and her answer thereof to him) her thoughts are something touched with doubt, and her minde assaulted and perplexed with feare, that the Father had played no faire play with his Sonne, but that in regard of his inveterate malice to him for beating her, hee might have sent him to heaven, and not to Rome . To which purpose, shee feeles and founds him every way, but he is as constant to denye it, as shee curious to inquire after it. So shee believing that hee had assumed no bloudy thoughts against his Sonne, she is not yet so devoyd of grace, or exempt of goodnesse, but shee gives him this religious caveat for a Memento , which she delivers to him accentively and passionatly, That if shee knew hee had made away his Sonne by any untimely end, or unnaturall accident, or that hee were any way accessary to any prodigious disaster which had befalne him, shee vowd to God, and swore unto him, that shee would spit in his face, disdaine his company, and reject his affection and himselfe for ever; for that shee was most assured and confident that God (in his due time) would poure down vengeance and confusion on those whom the Devill had seduced and drawn to imbrue their hearts and hands in innocent bloud. But Vasti is past grace, and therefore slightly passeth over these vertuous speeches of his vicious Salyna , with a denyall and a kisse; and then againe they fall to their mirth and familiarity, and hee stayes there all that day, and lyes with her the whole night following; but still Salyna (resembling her selfe and her profession) is very fingrative of his gold, and he as sottishly prodigall in giving it to her, as shee is covetous to crave and desire it of him: so (after hee had glutted himselfe with his beastly pleasures of Salyna ) hee the next day rides home to his wife, who knowing where, and with whom hee had beene, and considering it to be the first time of his new errour, and his first relapse into his old one, since their reconciliation, shee sayes nothing to him to discontent him; but yet thinkes and feares the more: When retiring her selfe into her Garden (after many bitter sighes and teares for these her immerited crosses and calamities) shee there grieves and repents her selfe for permitting her sonne George to goe to Rome , and a thousand thousand times wisheth his returne to assist and comfort her: but her teares herein prove as vaine, as her wishes are impossible to be effected, although at present very needfull and necessary for her. For now Vasti her husband (to make her sorrowes the more infinite, her hopes the more desperate, and her afflictions the more remedilesse) fals againe to his old practice of beating her, notwithstanding all his late oathes and new promises to the contrary; but he the more especially playes the Tyrant with her in this kind, when he comes home to her from his cups and whores, for she knowes with griefe, that he retaines and entertaines more then Salyna , onely she is too sure that Salyna hath his purse, his company, his affection, and his heart at her command, farre more then her selfe; she sends her sighes to heaven, and her prayers to God, that (out of the profunditie of his mercie and goodnesse) hee would bee pleased, either to amend her Husband or to end her selfe; for griefes, sorrowes, and afflictions are so heaped on her, and (like the waves of the Sea) fall so fast one upon the necke of the other to her, that she is weary of her life, and of her selfe. When on a time after hee had cruelly beaten her, torne off her head attire, given her a blacke eye and swollen face, and desheveled and disparpled her haire about her eares and shoulders (making God her Protector, and her Chamber her Sanctuary, exempting her servants who came to assist and comfort her, and fast bolting her doore) she to her selfe very pensively and mournfully breathes forth these speeches. O poore Hester , what sensible griefe is it to thy heart, to thinke, and matchlesse torments to thy mind, to see and remember, that whiles thou art true to thy husband Vasti , hee proves both ingratefull and false to thee, and that hee continually makes it his delight and glory to hate thee who art his deare wife, purposely to bestow his time and his affection, yea to cast away his estate and himselfe, on his lewd young strumpet Salyna: O were hee more happy and lesse guilty in that lascivious and beastly crime, I should then be lesse miserable, and more patient and joyfull in the remembrance thereof. O how wretched is his estate and condition, and therefore how miserable is thine, in that hee wilfully forsakes God and his Church to follow adultery and drunkennesse, and abandoneth all piety and prayer, to shipwracke himselfe, and (which is worse) his soule, upon all carnall pleasures and voluptuous sensualities; The which grieving to see, and almost drowning my selfe night and day in my teares to understand, I have none but God to assist mee in these my bitter afflictions and miseries, and under God, none, but my hopefull Sonne George ; left to comfort mee in these my unparalelled calamities and disconsolations. Therefore, O God, if ever thou heardest the prayers, or beheldest the teares of a poore miserable distressed woman, because I can neither now see, nor futurely hope for any reformation, in the life and actions of my debauched and vicious Husband, be (I beseech thee) so indulgent and gracious to me, thy most unworthy Hand-maid, that either shortly thou returne me my said Sonne from Rome , or speedily take mee to thy selfe in heaven; But yet O my blessed Saviour and Redeemer, not my, but thy will be done in all things. She having thus (privately to her selfe) vented her sorrowes, but not as yet found the meanes, either how to remedy or appease them, because her husband is no Changeling, but is still resolute in this ingratefull unkindnesse and cruelty towards her, she is now resolved though with infinit griefe and reluctation) to acquaint the Preacher of the parish, and some two of her husbands deerest and neerest kinsfolkes to speake with him againe, and to acquaint them with his pernitious relapse into all his old vices of drunkennesse, whoredome, and fighting, and to desire them to use all their possible power to divert him from it, wherein her resolution hath this just excuse, that if they cannot worke it, none but God can; But all their care, affection and zeale cannot prevaile with him; For he with the filthy dog returned to his vomit, and with the brutish swine againe to wallow in the dure, and wither in the mire of his former vices and voluptuousnesse. For now her husband Vasti is oftner at Cleraux with his Salyna , then at home at Fribourg with his wife, who (as formerly we have understood) still makes him pay deare for his pleasures, and as a subtle rooking strumpet, emptieth his purse of his gold, as fast as he foolishly filleth it, he being not contented to waste his body, to shipwracke his reputation, to cast away his time, but also to cast away his estate, and himselfe on her; the which his vertuous wife cannot but observe with sorrow, and remember with griefe and vexation, but she sees it impossible for her how to redresse it: For she is not capable to dissemble her discontent to him so privately, as he publickely makes knowen his cruelty to her, wherefore her thoughts suggest her, and her judgement prompts her, to proove another experiment and triall on him. To which end she tels him, that if hee will not henceforth abandon beating of her, forsake his old vices, and become a new man, and a reformed husband, that then all delayes set apart, she will speedily (by some one of her neerest kinsfolkes) send poast to Rome to his brother Captaine Andrew Vasti , that her Sonne George returne home to her to Fribourg , the which shee is more then confident, upon the receipt of her first Letter, he will speedily and joyfully performe. Her husband Vasti is extremely galled with this speech, and netled with this resolution of his wife Hester , because (wretched villaine as he is) he (but too well) knowes hee hath already sent his Sonne to heaven in a bloody winding sheet, and therefore both feares and knowes, that by this his wifes sending poast to Rome , his deplorable and damned fact will infallibly burst forth and come to light, the which therefore to prevent, hee (as bad, and cruell hearted as the Devill himselfe) is execrably resolved to heape Ossa upon Pelion , to adde blood to blood, and murther to murther; and so now to poyson the Mother his wife, as hee had lately pistolled his and her onely Sonne to death. O Hester , it had beene a singular happinesse for thee, that thou hadst not thus threatned thy husband Vasti , to send to Rome for thy son George , but that thou hadst either bin dumbe when thou spakest it, or he deaf when he heard it: for hereby thinking to preserve, thou hast extremely indangered thy selfe, and hoping to make thy Son thy refuge and champion, I feare with griefe, and grieve with feare, that thou hast made thy selfe the ruine of thy selfe. For Vasti is strong with the Devill, and so weak with God, in this his bloody designe, to murther his wife Hester , as neither Grace or Nature, Religion or God, the feare of his bodies tortures in this life, or of his soules torments in that to come are able to divert him from it, he having no other reason for this his damnable rage, nor no other cause for this his infernall and hellish cruelty, but this triviall and yet pittifull poore one, that his wife Hester is an eye-sore to him, because his Salyna is so to her. A wretched excuse, and execrable Apologie, and no lesse execrable and wretched is he that makes it. So he (turning his backe to God, and his face and heart to the Devill) provides himselfe of strong poyson, and cunningly infusing it into a muske Mellon, which he knew she loved well, and resolved to eate that day at dinner, shee greedily eating a great part of it, before night dies thereof. When very subtlely he gives out to his servants and neighbours, that she died of a surfet, in then and there eating too much of the muske Mellon; and so all of them confidently beleeve and report. Thus we have seene with sorrow, and understood with griefe, that this execrable wretch Vasti hath played the part of a Devill, in poysoning his vertuous and harmelesse wife Hester , and now we shall likewise see him play the part of an Hypocrite to conceale it, as if it lay in his power to blind- fold the eyes of God, as well, or as easily, as to hoodwincke those of men from the sight and knowledge thereof. He seemes wonderfull sorrowfull for his wifes death, dights himselfe and his servants all in blacke, provides a great dinner, and performes her funerall with extraordinary solemnity. But notwithstanding God lookes on him with his eye of Iustice, for both these his cruell and inhuman barbarous murthers of his son and wife, and therfore now (in his Providence) resolves to punish him sharply and severely for the same; As marke the sequell, and it will instantly informe us how. Our debauched and bloody Vasti , immediatly upon his wifes death and buriall, doth without intermission haunt the house and company of his lascivious strumpet Salyna at Cleraux , as if the enjoying of her sight, presence, and selfe, were his chiefest delight, and most soveraigne earthly felicity. Hee spends a great part of his estate on her, and to satisfie her covetous and his lustfull desires, hee is at last enforced to morgage and sell away all his Lands. For as long as hee had money, she was his, but when that failed him, then she (as a right strumpet, acted a true part of her selfe) failed in her accustomed kindnesse and familiarity towards him, and casts him off. The judgements of God, and the decrees of Heaven, are as secret as sacred, and as miraculous as just, which we shall see will now by degrees be apparantly made good and verified in this Monster of men, and Devill of Fathers and Husbands, Vasti . For his mansion house, and all his utensills and moveables in Fribourg , are consumed with a sudden fire, proceeding from a flash of lightning from heaven; as also all his granges of corne, and stacks of hay, and yet those of all his neighbours round about him are untouched and safe. His corne also which growes in the field brings forth little or no encrease, his vines wither and die away, all his horses are stolen from him, and most of his cattle, sheepe and goats, dye of a new and a strange disease; For being (as it were mad) they wilfully and outragiously run themselves to death one against the other; hee is amazed at all these his (unexpected) wonderfull losses and crosses, and yet this vild Miscreant and inhumane Murtherer, hath his conscience still so seared up, and his heart and soule so stupified and obdurated by the Devill, that he hath neither the will, power, or grace to looke up to Heaven and God, and so to see and acknowledge, from whom and for what all these afflictions and calamities befall him: He growes into great poverty, and againe to raise him and his fortunes, hee now knowes no other art or meanes left him then to marry his strumpet Salyna , to whom hee hath given great store of gold, and on whom (as wee have formerly heard) he hath spent the greatest part of his lands and estate. Hee seekes her in marriage, but (hearing of his great losses, and seeing of his extreme poverty) shee will not derogate from her selfe, but very ingratefully denies and disdaines him, and will not henceforth permit him to enter into her house, much lesse to see or speake with him: hee is wonderfull bitten and galled with this her unkind repulse, and then is driven to such extreme wants and necessity, as he is enforced to sell and pawne away, all those small trifles and things which are left him, thereby to give himselfe a very poore maintenance. So (as a wretched Vagabond whom God had justly abandoned for the enormity of his delicts and crimes) he now roames and straggleth up and downe the streets of Fribourg , and the countrey parishes and houses thereabouts, without meate, money, or friends, and which is infinitly worse then all, without God. But all these his calamities and disasters, are but the Hatbingers and Fore-runners of greater miseries and punishments, which are now suddenly and condignly prepared to surprize and befall him; whereof the Christian Reader is religiously prayed to take deep notice, and full observation; because the glory of God, and the Triumphs of his Revenge, in these his Iudgements, doe most divinely appeare, and stande forth to the whole world therein.

Here upon this his confession, some of the company ride away to Fribourg , and acquaint the Criminall Officers of justice thereof; who speedily send two Chirurgions to dresse his wounds, and foure Sergeants to bring Vasti thither alive, if possibly they can. They search his wounds, and although they find them mortall, yet they believe hee may live three or foure dayes longer. So they bring him to Fribourg in a Cart, and there hee likewise confesseth to the Magistrates his two aforesayd bloudy and cruell Murthers, drawne thereunto as he saith, by the treacherous alluremements and temptations of the Devill: So the same day, they, for satisfaction of these his unnaturall crimes, doe condemne him to be hanged, and then his body to be burnt to ashes; which is accordingly executed in Fribourg , in presence of a great concourse of people, who came to see him take his last farewell of the world, but they thinking and expecting that he would have made some religious speech at his death, he therein deceived their hopes and desires: for he only prayed to himselfe privatly, and then repeating the Lords prayer, and the Creed, and recommending his soule to God, and his body to Christian buriall, without once mentioning or naming his son George , his wife Hester , or his strumpet Salyna , he (lifting up his eies to heaven) was turned over; and although (being a tall and corpulent man) he there brake the rope and fell, yet he was found starke dead on the ground. And thus was the wretched life, and deserved death of this bloudy Monster of Nature Vasti . May we therefore reade this his History to Gods glory, and to our owne reformation.

VVritten by Iohn Reynolds . LONDON, ¶ Printed by John Haviland for William Lee , and are to be sold at his shop in Fleetstreet, at the signe of the Turks Head, neere the Mitre Taverne. 1634 . of the most ancient Knights of the Illustrious Order of the Garter. MY LORD, France , when you then began your travels, accompanied with your Noble and Generous younger brother Sir Robert Stanley , (likewise Knight of the Bath) who now lives with God: And (if my fancie deceive not my Judgement.) it is equally worthy both of my thoughts, and of your Lordships memory, to see how propitious God hath since proved to your content, and remaines to your felicity, in so highly recompensing this your losse of a Noble Brother , with the rich gift of a Vertuous VVife , your Right Jllustrious Lady, who is descended from no meaner house than the famous Dukes of Tremouille by her Father, and the Victorious Princes of Orenge by her Mother, and who being transplanted from France , and (in the Sacred Bonds of Mariage) here matched and incorporated to your Lordship, hath (by the Mercy and Providence of God) in a few yeares brought you many sweet Olive Plants and Branches to perpetuate your ancient Name , and most Honourable Family of the Stanleyes . And what are all these benefits of Nature , and blessings of Grace , which God hath so opportunely sent, and graciously given you, in and by them, but such, and so sublime and transcendent, that they are strong proofes of his Mercy and Goodnesse towards you, and J doubt not but (in a pious resolution) your Lordship reciprocally makes them the cause of your eternall gratitude and thankfulnesse to his sacred Majesty for the same. And indeed who can possibly have, or conceive a different thought, that observes how your Lordship conducts all your actions by Reason , and not by Passion : That as you esteeme Vertue , to be the chiefest earthly Honour , so you likewise value Piety and Godlinesse to bee the best and most Soveraigne Vertues . That you are confident, that in Hearts and Soules which are well and fairly endowed, Honour and Honesty should still be Twins, or inseparable Companions and Individuals, because the former without the latter, is but as fire of straw to the Sunne-shine; and to shut up this point, that your Honour gives the chiefest functions and faculties of your Soule to God , and the second to the prosperity and service of your Prince and Countrey , that being the true markes of a Religious Christian, and this of an excellent Subject, and Honourable Patriot . And this (my good Lord) was the Originall cause, and these are the prevailing Motives and Reasons, why I trench so farre upon your Lordships Greatnesse and Goodnesse , in proffering up this my Sixth and last Booke of Gods Revenge against Murther , to your Noble Protection and Patronage ; not that your Lordship is the last in my Affection and Zeale , much lesse in my Respects and Observance : But that I could give no satisfaction to my selfe, before I had prefixed your Illustrious Name , to this my unpolished Worke, and before I had given a publike testimonie to the whole world in generall, and more especially to our little world England in particular, what place and power your Honourable Birth and Vertues have deservedly taken up in my heart, and worthily purchased in my most reserved and entire affection. The Histories which this Booke relates, are memorable and mournfull, and to give your Honour my opinion of them, they are as lamentable for the bloudy facts, as memorable for the sharp, yet just punishments inflicted for the same; wherein Gods sacred Iustice and Revenge (with equall Truth and Glory ) triumphed ore their wretched Perpetrators. I have cast them in a low Region of language, and therefore if they come short of your Lordships accurate Iudgement, my Presumption in this my Dedication to you, hath no other hope of excuse or pardon, then to flie to your Lordships innate Goodnesse , and to appeale to your knowne and approved Generosity and Candor , as making it your Honourable Ambition to cherish Vertue in all men, and to defend it against unjust scandall, and malitious detraction. Proceed my Lord, as you have fairly and fortunately beganne, in the happy excercise and progresse of Piety, Vertue and Honour ; and as the hopes are now ours, so may the happy fruits and effects thereof, infallibly still prove your Lordships hereafter, untill it have perfected and compleated you to be a most Illustrious Patterne of Goodnesse in this world, and a glorious Saint in that to come, the which none shall pray to God for with more true Zeale , nor desire with more unfaigned Affection , then Your Honours humblest devoted Servant, Imperia for the love she beares to young Morosini , seduceth and causeth him (with his two Consorts, Astonicus and Donato ) to stifle to death her old Husband Palmerius in his bed; Morosini misfortunately letting fall his gloves in Palmerius his chamber that night which he did it; They are found by Richardo the Nephew of Palmerius , who knowes them to be Morosinies , and doth thereupon accuse him and his Aunt Imperia , for the Murther of his Vnkle; So they together with their accessaries Astonicus and Donato , are all foure of them apprehended and hanged for the same. Father Iustinian a Priest, and Adrian an Inne-keeper, poyson De Laurier , who was lodged in his house, and then bury him in his Orchard; where a moneth after a Wolfe digges him up, and devoures a great part of his body; which father Iustinian and Adrian understanding, they flie upon the same, but are afterwards both of them apprehended and hanged for it. Hippolito murthereth Garcia in the street by night, for the which he is hanged. Dominica and her Chamber-maid Denisa , poysoneth her husband Roderigo; Denisa afterwards strangleth her owne new borne Babe, and throwes it into a Pond, for the which she is hanged; On the ladder she confessed that she was accessary, with her Lady Dominica in the poysoning of her Husband Roderigo ; for the which Dominica is apprehended, and likewise hanged. Sanctifiore (upon promise of mariage) gets Ursina with childe, and then afterwards very ingratefully and treacherously rejecteth her, and marries Bertranna: Ursina being sensible of this her disgrace, disguiseth her selfe in a Fries habit and with a case of Pistols kils Sanctifiore as he is walking in the fields, for the which shee is hanged. De Mora treacherously kils Palura in a Duell with two Pistols: His Lady Bellinda with the aid of her Gentleman Vsher Ferallo , poysoneth her Husband De Mora , and afterwards she marieth and murthereth her said Husband Ferallo in his bed; so shee it burnt alive for this her last murther, and her ashes throwne into the aire for the first. GODS REVENGE, AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable sinne of Murther. History XXVI.  Imperia for the love she beares to young Morosini , seduceth and causeth him (with his two Consorts, Astonicus and Donato ) to stifle to death her old Husband Palmerius in his bed; Morosini misfortunately letting fall his gloves in Palmerius his chamber that night which he did it; They are found by Richardo the Nephew of Palmerius , who knowes them to be Morosinies , and doth thereupon accuse him and his Aunt Imperia , for the Murther of his Vnkle,; So they together with their accessaries Astonicus and Donato , are all foure of them appehended and hanged for the same.  than Heaven, are still attended on with shame and repentance, and many times followed by misery and confusion: For God being our Maker by Creation, and our Saviour by Redemption, consequently should be of our loves and affections, and the true  & sole object, in whom only they should begin and terminate: For Nature must be a handmaid, not a Mistresse to Grace, because God (in his Divine decree and creation of man) hath made our bodies mortall, but our soules immortall. And the like Antithesis which there is betweene Lust and Charity, the same there is betweene sinfull adultery, and sanctified mariage. But where our youthfull affections beginne in whoredome, and end in murther, what can be there expected for an issue, but ruine and desolation. Crimes no lesse than these doth this ensuing History report and relate: A History I confesse, so deplorable for the persons, their facts and punishments, that I had little pleasure to pen it, and lesse joy to publish it; but that the truth and manner thereof gave a contrary Law to my resolutions, in giving it a place among the rest of my Histories; That the sight and knowledge of others harmes, may the more carefully and conscionably teach us to avoid and prevent our owne. Seigniory of Venice , (which for wealth and power gives place to no other of Christendome) holds it no degree of disparagement, but rather an happy and honourable vertue in their Nobles and Gentlemen, to exercise the facility and profession of Merchants, the which they generally performe in Turkie, and all other parts of the Lovant Seas, with as much profit as glory, to the admiration of the whole world, and the envie of their private and publike enemies: Of which number of Venetian Gentlemen, Seignior Angelo Morosini is one, a young men of some twenty  & foure yeares of age, descended of a Noble name and family, and (if reports be true) from whence ours here in England derives their Originall: He is tall and slender of stature, of a lovely sanguine complection, a bright Chestnut-coloured haire, but as yet adorned with a small apparition of a beard: He is active of body, of a sweet carriage, and nimble wit, and a most pleasing and gracefull speech; and hee is not so young, but he hath already made two severall voyages to Constantinople and Alexandria , in both which he resided some five or six yeares, and through his wisdome and industry wonne some wealth, but more reputation and fame, in so much as his deportments and hopes, to the eye and judgement of the world, promiseth him a fortune, equall, if not exceeding his bloud and extraction. Holding it therefore rather a shame than a glory as yet to marrie, or which is a thousand times worse, to passe his time vainly and lasciviously at home among the Ladies and Courtisans of Venice , upon whom (by the way of a premonition and precaution) he saw so many deboshed young Gallants to cast away their Estates and themselves, he affirmes his former ambition to travell, and so undertakes a third voyage to Constantinople : He embarkes himselfe upon a good ship, named the Little Saint Marke of Venice , and in company of Seignior Astonichus , and Seignior Philippo Donato , likewise two young Gentlemen, Mearchants of Venice , of his deare and intimate acquaintance (with a pleasant gale and merry wind, they set saile from Malavota , the Port of that City, and so direct and shape away their course for the Islands of Corsu and Zant , where they are to stop, and take in some commodities, and from thence thorow the Archipelagus , by Candy and Cyprus , to the Port of the Great Seignior . But as men propose, and God disposeth of all terrestriall actions and accidents; so they are overtaken by a storme, and with contrary winds put into the Harbour and City of Ancona , a rich, populous and strong City which belongs to the Pope, and which is the Capitall of that Province of the Marca Anconitana , from whence it assumes and takes its denomination, and wherein there are well neare three thousand Jewes still resident, who pay a great yearly Revenue to his Holinesse. The wind being as yet contrary for our three Venetian Gallants, and they knowing that our Lady of Loretto (the greatest and most famous Pilgrimage of the Christian world) was but fifteene small miles off in the Countrey, whereas yet they had never either of them beene, they in meere devotion ride thither, their ship now being fast anchored and mored in the Peere of Ancona , which stands on the Christian side, upon the Adriatique Sea, vulgarly tearmed the gulfe of Venice . And here it is neither my purpose or desire to write much, either of the pretended pietie of this holy Chappell of Loretto , which the Romanists say was the very Chamber wherein the Virgin Mary brought up her Sonne, our Saviour Iesus Christ; or of her Picture which they likewise alleadge was drawne by the hand and pensill of the Apostle Saint Luke , and both the one and the other, as they affirme miraculously brought over the Seas from Palestine by Angells, and first placed by them on the Hills of Recagnati (three little miles thence) and long since by the said Angels translated and placed here in this small Towne of Loretto . But as for my selfe, this legend is to weake to passe current with my faith, much lesse to esteeme it as an Article of my Creed. Only this I will confesse and say. That as it was devotion not curiosity which carried our Morisini, Astonicus and Donato thither: so it was my curiosity not my Devotion which made me to take the sight thereof in my Travells. Where in the rich and sumptuous Quire of a stately Cathedrall Church, I saw this little old Bricke Chamber (now termed the Holy Chappell, verie richly adorned with great variety of massie Gold and Silver Lampes, and this Picture of the blessed Virgin in a Shrine of Silver, most richly decked with Chaines and Robes, imbroidered with Gold and Silver, and set with pretious Stones of inestimable valew, which (to expresse the truth in one word) bred much admiration in my thoughts, but no veneration at all in my heart. So I leaue Loretto , and returne againe to our History, which was the onely Relique that I brought thence. The two first dayes, our three Venetian Gallants visit this holy Chappell with much solemnity and devotion, where not to Iesus the Sonne, but to Marie the Mother they offer up their prayers, and pay their vowes of thankfulnesse for their deliverance from the late storme which put them and their Ship in safety at Ancona . But the third day there betides an unexpected accident to Morisini , which will administer matter and life to this History. Hee leaves his two friends and companions in bed, and steales away to the holy Chappell, where being on his knees to his devotion, hee neere to him, sees a sweet young Gentlewoman likewise on her knees at her devotion and orisons very rich in apparell, but incomparably faire and beautifull. He curiously markes her Roseat Lilly Cheekes, her piercing Eye, the Amber Tresses of her Haire, her Alablaster Necke and Paps, and her streight and slender wast, all which made her to bee the Pride and Glory of Nature; At whose sight and contemplation, his minde is so sodainely inflamed with affection to her, that hee who heretofore could not possibly bee drawne to love any Gentlewoman, or Mayden, now despight of himselfe, (and of his contrary inclination and resolution) hee at first sight is inforced to love her and only her. For the more hee sees her, the more hee affects her, which engendereth such strange motions, and sodaine passions in his heart that the sweetnesse of this sweet object, enforced his eyes incessantly to gaze on her both with affection and admiration. Our Morosini would faine have boarded and saluted her there, but that hee would not make Heaven so much stoope to Earth, nor prophane the holinesse of his affection and of this place with such impietie. But at last seeing her to rise from her prayers, and so to depart the Chappell, hee could not, hee would not so leave her, nor forsake the benefit of this sweet opportunity to make himselfe knowne to her; When withdrawing his Devotion from the old Lady of Loretto to give it to this his young Lady (and pretended Mistris) in Loretto , hee trippes away after her, into the body of the Church where seeing her only attended, by a well clad Boy and her young waiting Gentlewoman (after salutes on both sides performed,) hee there profereth her his service in these generall Tearmes. Moros. I know not sweet young Lady, whether I may terme my selfe happy or unfortunate, in being this morning honoured with the sight of so beautifull a Nymph, and Virgin as your selfe, because in thinking to gaine my soule, I feare I have lost my heart in the amorous extasies of that delitious Object and Contemplation; therefore I beseech you thinke it not strange, that having received my wound from your Beautie, I flie to your Courtesie for my cure and remedy thereof; and that seeing you so weakely guarded, I presume to request the favour of you that you will please to accept of my Company to reconduct you to your home. This young Lady, seeing her selfe so much gazed on by this unknowne Gentleman in the holy Chappell, and now so courteously saluted by him in the Church, shee could not refraine from dying her Lilly Cheekes with a Vermillian blush, when having too much beautie to bee too unkinde, and yet too much coynesse and modestie at first to prove too courteous to him, shee (brooking her name well) returnes him this answer. Imp. Sir you being so happie to have given up your Soule this morning in your devotion to the blessed Lady of this place, I doe not a little wonder, that you so soone prophane it, by endevoring to make mee believe, that you have lost your heart in the contemplation of so poore, and so unworthie a beautie as mine; For herein as you prophane your zeale to her, so doe you your affection to me, sith that should bee more sacred, and this not so much faigned or hypocriticall. But such wounds still carry their cures with them, and therefore as my beauty was not capable to occasion the one, so shall not my courtesie be guilty in granting the other: If my weake guard bee not strong enough to conduct mee to my home, my Innocency and Chastity are, as also to defend mee from the snares and lures of those Gentlemen, whose best Vertue consists more in their tongues then their soules, and more in their complements then their actions; Of which number fearing and taking you to be one, and my Fathers house being so nigh, I shall not want your company, because as I deserve so I desire it not, and therefore I will leave you, and yet not without leaving my thankes with you, for this your prostered favour, and unexpected courtesie. Although Morosini could not refraine from smiling at this her sharpe and wittie answer, yet hee seeing his complement retorted, and his courtesie returned with a refusall, hee could not yet refraine from biting his Lip thereat. But againe considering her to bee exceeding faire and vertuous, and hoping withall that her father might likewise prove rich, hee would not disgrace his breeding nor make himselfe a Novice in Love to bee put off with this her first repulse, but againe sounds her in these tearmes. Moros. My devotion to the Mother of our Saviour doth not prophane but I hope blesse and sanctifie my affection to you, and therefore if it bee not the custome of the young Ladies and Gentlewomen of Loretto to use strangers with this discourtesie, I cannot believe that you would purposly thus exercise your wit in my patience, by inflicting on mee this your unjust refusall. As for your feigned shewes of Hipocrisie: I am as innocent of them as you suspect and tearme mee guiltie and have no more snares or lures in proferring you my affection and service, than that which your pure beautie and chast vertues give mee. Neither am I of the number of those Gentlemen, whom you please to traduce and disparage because their hearts and tongues agree not, or for that their actions prove not their speeches, and complements reall; because I as much disdaine as you condemne them; Therefore if you cannot give me the courtesie, I pray at least lend me the favour that I may waite on you to your Fathers house; whom I shall ever bee readie to serve with as much humility for your sake, as to cherish and obey your selfe with affection for mine owne. This answer of Morosini makes this young Gentlewoman (whose name he and wee shall anon know) as sweetly calme, as right now shee was unkindlie passionate, so that looking stedfastly on him, and composing her countenance rather to smiles than frownes, she rejoynes with him thus. Imp. It is the custome of the Ladies and Gentlewoman of Loretto , to use Strangers rather with too much respect than too little favour, especially those Gent. who favor more of honor than vanity. If therfore I have any way wronged mine owne iudgment, in suspecting or not acknowledging your merits, I know I am yet as worthy of your excuse as of your reprehension. And because I understand by you that you are a stranger to this place though not to this Country, as also that you seeme to be so importunatly desirous and willing to conduct me to my Fathers house; I will therefore give a contrarie Law to my owne will, and now make civillitie dispence with my discretion by accepting of this your kinde proffer, and you shall not accompany mee thither to him, with so much respect and zeale as I will you with observance and thankes. Which kind speech she had no sooner delivered and Morosini received, but he againe closed with her thus: Moros. Sweet Lady, this courtesie of yours seconding your beautie, shall eternally oblige mee to your service; and in requitall thereof, I will ever esteeme it my best happinesse to receive your Fathers commands, and my thiefest felicity and glory to execute yours: When reciprocally exchanging salutes, hee takes her by the hand and arme, and very gracefully conducts her to her Fathers house, not farre off from this sumptuous Church, and by the way thither (among other speeches and complements he gathers from her that her Fathers name is Signior Hierome Bondino , and hers Donna Imperia his only Daughter. Wherein hee for the former fame of his wealth and the present sight of her Beautie doth both delight and glory, as dreaming of a future felicity which hee shall enioy in her sight and company; whereof for the time present hee hath farre more reason to flatter than to assure himselfe. Now wee must heere understand that this Seignior Bondino her Father, is a Gentleman of an ancient house and noble descent; and of a verie great estate both in lands and meanes, and withall he was exceeding covetous, as glorying more in his wealth than in his generositie, and more in his faire and beautifull Daughter Imperia , then in any other of his Children. Heere Morisini brings Imperia home, and shee presents him and his courtesie to her Father, who receives him respectfully and kindly thankes him for this his observance and honour to his daughter: who led by the lustre of her eyes and the delicacie of her beautie, was so extreamly inflamed with affection towards her, as at that very instant he proclaimed himselfe her Servant, and shee the Lady Regent of his heart and desires, and then it was that hee first acquainted her with his name and quality, with his intended voyage to Constantinople , but chiefely with his constant desire and resolution to seeke her in marriage both of her selfe and her father. Wherefore to contract this History into a narrow Volumne, I will passe over his often courtings and visits of her, as also those sweet speeches, and amorous discourses and conferences which past betweene them during the space of three weekes; wherein the winde proving contrary to his voyage, proved therefore propitious to this his sute and affection. In which time hee proved himselfe so expert a Scholler (or rather a Master) in the Art of Love that hee exchanged hearts with her, obtained her affection and consent to bee his Wife upon his first returne from Constantinople , but yet it was wholly impossible either for he or her to draw her fathers consent hereunto, although many times hee sought it of him with prayers, and shee with teares. For hee making wealth to bee the verie image and idol of his devotion, and gathering that Morosini's birth farre exceeded his estate and meanes, as also that in his opinion, that his estate was yet farre greater than his capacitie or judgement, hee would never hearken to him, much lesse give way that hee should bee his Sonne in Law: but with much obstinacie and resolution, vowed that hee would first rather see his Daughter married to her grave than to him, the which froward and harsh resolution of his, makes our two lovers exceedingly to grieve and lament thereat. But how to remedie it they know not. Morosini now acquaints his two consorts Astonicus and Donato with his affection to Imperia , and brings them the next morning to see her, who highly commend his choice, and extoll her beautie and vertues to the skies; They in Morosini's behalfe deale effectually with Bondino to draw his consent to this match, mount his praises and merits as high as Heaven, and in a word they leave no friendly office, or reasons unatempted to perswade and induce him hereunto, but they speake either to the winde, or to a deafe man; for his will is his Law, and therefore they finde it a worke, not only of extreame difficultie but of meere impossibilitie to effect it; for neither they nor Morosini , can so much pray and exhort Bondini to this match, as hee with sharpe words and bitter threates seekes to divert his Daughter from it; which pierceth and galleth these two Lovers to their verie soules. For by this time their affections and hearts are so strongly and firmely united, that Imperia loves Morosini a thousand times deerer than her owne life, and hee her no lesse. So when they thinke of their seperation and departure each from other, the verie conceit and thought thereof drawes even droppes of blood from their hearts, and an Ocean of teares from their eyes. But because they are more amorous then superstitious in their devotion and affection each to other and that (in their thoughts and desires) they sacrifice more to the Altars of Venus then to that of the Virgin Marie . Therefore Fortune more envying then pittying them, and therefore resolving to separate their bodies as farre assunder, as their hearts are neerely linked and combined together: the winde comes faire, and the Master of their Shippe sends speedily from Ancona to them to Loretto to come away, for that he is resolute to omit no time but with all expedition to weigh Anchor, and set saile for Corfu . Morosini receives this newes with infinite sorrow, and Imperia with extreame griefe and amazement, so as if grace had not prevailed with nature, and her obedience to her Father vanquished and given a law to her affection towards Morosini , shee could then and there have found in her heart to have left Italy , and to accompanyed him in his voyage to Turkie and Constantinople , so sweet was his sight and presence, and so bitter was the verie thought of his abscence to her heart and minde; Here Morosini comes againe with his hat in his hand and Imperia on her knees with teares to her father, that hee will grant they may contract themselves each to other before his departure, but he is deafe to his requests, and inexorable to her teares and prayers. For hee vowes hee cannot, and sweares hee will not consent thereunto; And therefore heere the Reader must conceive, for it is impossible for mee to expresse the thousand part of the sighes which hee, and the teares which shee expends at this their sorrowfull departure, in so much as I cannot truly define whether hee then gave her more kisses, or shee him teares. So here shee vowes to remaine unmarried till his returne, and hee both promiseth and sweares, that he will returne within one yeare to her and marrie her, the which the more authentically to seale and confirme hee gives her a rich Emerauld ring from his finger, and shee him a faire carkamet of Orient Pearle from her necke, with whom the great droppes of her teares trickling downe her vermillion cheekes seemed to have some perfect sympathy and resemblance; Of which interchangeable and mutuall contract Astonicus and Donato are joyfull witnesses; who seeke to adde comfort and consolation to these her unspeakeable sorrowes, and unparalleld afflictions for this their separation; whiles Imperia in the meane time at the verie thought and consideration hereof, (shee gazing on her Morosini ) seemes to burst her heart with sighing, and to drowne the Roses and Lillies of her beautie with the showers and rivulets of her teares. So Morosini being againe and againe called away by Astonicus and Donato , hee then takes leave of Bondino , and then of his deere and sweet Daughter Imperia in whose heart and brest hee imparadiseth all his most religious prayers, and treasureth up all his amarous desires and wishes, and from thence (with his two faithfull friends and companions takes horse for Ancona , where as soone as they come, their long boate is a shoare and takes them in, when the Winde continuing still exceeding faire, they presently for [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Corfu and Constantinople . Where wee will leave them floating on the Seas, exposed to the favour and mercy of the windes, and according to the order of our History come wee againe to speake of Bondino , and of his sweet and faire daughter Imperia , to see what matter they will administer us, and what Actions and Accidents they will produce. Whiles our faire Imperia day and night weepes and sighes for the absence of her dearest and second selfe Morosini , and with her eies and hands erected to Heaven continually praies for his prosperitie and returne, her old Father Bondino assumes a direct contrary course and resolution; for within two or three moneths of Morisini's departure, hee makes it his greatest care and ambition to provide another husband for this his Daughter. Hee is not ignorant of her teares and pensivenesse for his absence, and knowes full well, that her solitarie walkes and palle thinne cheekes, lookes still constantly to him and never from him. But hee is resolute that his old covetousnesse shall prevent and deceive this her young affection, and that to worke on the advantage of Morosini's absence, his best and shortest course is to heave him out of her heart and minde, and contrariwise to propound and place another Husband in his stead. To which end his said daughters beautie and his owne wealth having already procured her two or three other Sutors, who earnestly seeke her in marriage, hee likes none of them so well, as old Seignior Palmerius a rich Marchant of Ancona , aged of at least sixtie yeares; whereas his faire Daughter Imperia was not above twentie foure, who was of so deformed and decrepit a personage and constitution, that hee seemed but as a withered Ianuary to this fresh Lady May, and his age but a frozen Winter to the fragrant flourishing Sommer of her youth and beautie. But this old dotard Palmerius (who is every way fitter for his owne grave than for Imperia's bed) is so taken with the daintinesse of her personage, as he hopes that her youth and her fathers age will stoope and strike saile to his wealth, and therefore hee trickes and prides himselfe up both in his apparell and beard, as if Love had taken away much of his Age, now purposly to adde it to his vanity and indiscretion, so hee comes to Bondino's house at Loretto , and seekes this his faire daughter in marriage, where the consideration of his great estate and wealth act such wonders with her fathers heart and resolution, that her father and hee have already swapt a bargaine that hee, and none but hee shall marry his daughter, before as yet hee have the happinesse to see her. But at last her father brings her to him, chargeth her with his commands to dispose her selfe to affect and marry him, and speakes to her not onely in the language of a father, but of a King, for such is his pleasure. These speeches of her father, and the sight of this her old lover yet new sutor Palmerius , doth much amaze and terrifie his young Daughter Imperia : so shee receives and heares those with infinit affliction and sorrow, and him with much contempt and disdaine; For she rejects his sute and himselfe, and boldly tells both her father and him, that Morosini is too deeply lodged in her heart, for any other of the world to have entrance or admittance, and therefore (with sighes and teares) casts her selfe at her fathers feet, and prayes him that hee will not force her to marry Signior Palmerius whom shee affirmes shee cannot possibly affect, much lesse obey. But her father is resolute to have it so, and therefore (passing over all other respects and considerations) hee addes threates, to his commands, and vehemently chargeth her againe and againe to consent thereto. But her absent Morosini is still so present in her heart and minde, and so fresh and pleasing to her eye and memorie, that shee cannot, shee will not forget him. So that for this time her father can no more enforce her to speake with Palmerius , or draw her to see him, and thus shee puts him off for his first comming to Loretto to her. Imperia being now infinitly glad to have thus given her father the foile, and old Palmerius the repulse, shee raiseth a thousand new Trophees of joy, and victories of delight in her heart for the same, as if that outragious storme and tempest (so contrary and displeasing to her heart) had received end almost as soone as beginning. Thus now ruminating on nothing lesse then on Palmerius , nor on nothing more than on her sweet and deere Morosini , (to whom in his absence shee sacrificeth all the flames of her heart, and all the vowes, desires and wishes of her soule) shee passeth away her time in perpetuall praying for his returne, for the which shee leaves not the Lady, no nor any other Saint of Loretto unadored, or unprayed to. But contrary to her hopes and desires herein, this her old sutor Palmerius , (having wholly lost the soliditie of his judgement in the excellency of her beautie) hee still keepes good correspondence, and curious intelligence with her father, and continually his heart runnes as much on her youth as her fathers covetousnesse doth on his wealth and gold; so within two moneths hee returnes againe to Loretto , where he is received with as much joy of Bondino , as with extreame discontent and sorrow of his Daughter Imperia , who now poore soule can receive no peace nor truce from either of them, but they incessantly haunt her as her ghosts, and faile not day and night to importune her for the consummation of this contract and marriage, but her heart is so close united and wedded to Morosini , that it is as yet impossible for either, or both of them to divorce or withdraw her from him. Palmerius thinkes to gaine her by rich gifts and presents, but shee refuseth them all for the sake of the giver, and her father now tempts her with sweet speeches and perswasions, and then againe, terrifies her with bitter commands and threats, hoping thereby in the end to make her flexible to his desires and wishes; But his daughter Imperia notwithstanding all this (with a constancie worthie of her beautie, and every way equall to her selfe) resolves to frustrate the hopes of the first, to annihilate and make vaine the expectation of the second, and so to deceive the desires, and wishes of them both, and to keepe her heart wholly for Morosini as shee hath formerly promised and obliged her selfe to doe. But although Palmerius were heretofore the first time so easily beaten off with Imperias refusall, hee will not bee so the second, and therefore his heart and mind telling him that the sweetnesse of her youth, and the delicacy of her beauty deserve a stronger, and longer siege of his affection. Hee (by the free advise and consent of her Father) resolves to stay [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and burne all that Sommer in Loretto , hoping that time would change her resolutions and make that feasable in his Daughters affection, which now in a manner seemed to bee impossible. Thus if Palmerius use his best endevours to beare and conquer Imperia one way, no lesse doth her Father another way, for the first gives her a world of sugred words and promises, and the second of sharpe and bitter threates to effect it; Poore Imperia seeing her selfe thus streightly and narrowly begirt on both sides, shee hath againe recourse to her sighes and teares, the only weapons left her in the absence of her Morosini to defend her affection and constancie against the lust of Palmerius , and the power and tyrranny of her father Bondino . A thousand times a day shee wisheth that Constantinople were Loretto , or Loretto Constantinople , and as often prayes that either she were in Morosini's armes, or hee heere in hers. But Palmerius being as obstinate as her father was resolute and furious in this sute and motion towards her, shee shuts her selfe up in her Chamber, where seeming to drowne her selfe in her teares, shee consults with her affection, how shee should beare her selfe in a matter of this weight and importance, and what invention shee should finde out and practise, to abandon Palmerius , and to call home her Morisini to marry her, then which under Heaven shee desired nothing more, or to write truer nothing else. So at last shee resolves to send one purposely to Constantinople to hasten his returne (which now wanted but a little of his prefixed time of a yeare) when making choice of a deere friend of his of Ancona named Seignior Mercario , and furnishing him with gold for so long a journey, as to saile from Brundiscum , to Ragusa , and so from thence by poast to Constantinople , she takes pen and paper, and thereon (as much with teares as incke) traceth her Morosini these lines wherewith shee dispatcheth him away.  unworthy of thine, if by this my letter (which I purposely send thee by thy friend Seignior Mercario ) I did not now acquaint thee, with how much impatience and sorrow my selfe, and with how much joy my Father brookes thy long absence. Thou knowest in what a sweet, and strict sympathie of Love, our hearts are united. So as measuring Morosini by Imperia , I am confident that all those Seas betweene Ancona and Constantinople are not capable to wash away the remembrance thereof either from thy heart or my soule. And yet holding it a part both of my dutie and of my selfe, I am enforced to command my pen to relate thee, that my Father Bondino begins to excercise a point not onlie of his will, but of his power, yea I may justly say of his tyrannie over me, to perswade me to leave my young Morosini to make me marry his old Palmerius . In which regard  & consideration, if my poore beauty or merit have left any impression in thy brest or memorie, I now most heartily pray thee to leave Turkie for Italy , and Constantinople for Loretto and to make me as happie in injoying thy sight and presence, as I am miserable without it. And when our God, and my good fortune, shall permit this my innocent and sorrowfull letter to fall into thy hands, thinke, yea judge with thy selfe, what an ingratitude, yea what a crime it will bee for hee not to bring mee thy selfe, but to send mee any excuse whatsoever to the contrary. Farewell my other selfe, thy sweet selfe, and may God and his Angells ever prove propitious to thy Desires, and my Wishes. Imperia.  Mercario (in three weekes time) arrives at Constantinople , and finds out his friend Morosini , to whom he delivereth his Mistris Imperias letter; the which he first kissing, presently peruseth it, and very passionatly both rejoyceth  & grieves thereat: So Morosini very kindely feasts his friend Mercario there some eight dayes, and then returneth him home with an answer, which in lesse than a moneths time hee delivereth into Imperias owne hands in Loretto , who is extreamely glad thereof, and then beautifying her snow white cheekes, with some crimson blushes, shee hies to her closet and breaking up hastily the seales thereof, findes it traced and charged with this message  Letter, as thy Father Bondino his disrespect to mee and love to Palmerius makes mee sorrowfull, for so deere and tender is the true affection of my Imperia to her Morosini , and the simpathy of our hearts so sweetly and sacredly united, that for my part not only those small rivers of the Mediteraneum and Adriatique Sea betweene Constantinople and Ancona , but that of the vast Ocean is incapable to wash off the least sense or memory thereof, But as in the actions and accidents of humane life, reputation and profit, deserve some times to bee entermixed with pleasure, because the sweetnesse thereof is still made sweeter by its subsistance and permanency. So by the Seigniory of Venice , and by Landy their Ambassadour resident here in Constantinople , (contrary to my expectation or merits) I am now made Consull of Aleppo . I cannot therefore so soone leave Turkie for Italy which I infinitly desire, nor in that consideration so soone imbrace and kisse my faire and deare Imperia , which above all the Crownes and Scepters of the world I chiefly love and long for; but what this yeare cannot performe the next shall, and then (all delayes and excuses set apart) I will bring thee thy Morosini with as much true joy as hee transported himselfe from thee with bitter teares and unfained sorrows, in the meane time my hopes and heart tell mee, that thy affection to mee shall surmount thy Fathers tyranny to thy selfe, and that thy beauty and merits are so incomparably resplendent, that though Palmerius bee the fayle, yet Morisini shall live and dye the Diamond of thy love and the Love of thy Heart, as God is of thy Soule. O then my deere and sweet Imperia , repute it no ingratitude much lesse a crime in mee to send thee this letter of excuse in steed of bringing thee my selfe, for I speake it in presence of God and his Angels, that as thou art my other halfe so I am wholly thine, and that thou canst not bee the thousand part so sorrowfull as I am miserable in this our short yet too long sequestration. Farewell, Farewell the only Saint of my heart, and Goddesse of my affections, and assure thy selfe that no mortall man whatsoever is, or can bee so much thy faithfull Servant and Slave, as Morosini.  Our Imperia kisseth this Letter a thousand times for her Morisini's sake who wrote and sent it her, and againe as often weepes to see, that hee loved Honor and profit better then her selfe, and Turkie better than Italy , so whereas shee formerly hoped, now shee begins to despaire of his speedy returne, and esteemes herselfe as miserable without him, as shee thought to have beene happy with him. Shee reades over his Letter againe and againe, and then weepes as fast as shee reades, at the very perusall and consideration thereof; shee would faine draw comfort from any part or branch of it, but then his intended stay affords her nothing but disconsolation and sorrow in stead thereof. She blames her owne misfortune, as much as his unkindnesse, and then againe imputes this impatiencie of hers, more to her fathers crueltie, than to Morosini's discourtesie; shee loves him as much as shee hates Palmerius , and hates her selfe because Morosini will not love her more, and Palmerius lesse. But Morosini is so firmly seated and enthronized in her heart, that she is constantly resolved to stay his returne, and rather to dy his victim and martyr than to live Palmerius his wife. And here her affection acts a great part in passion, as this passion doth in Love, she cannot refraine from enquiring of Mercario how Morisini lives, and how he looks, who performes the part of a friend, to his friend and tells her that hee lives in great pompe and reputation, and is the properest and bravest young Gallant either of Venice or Italy which hee saw in Constantinople , at the report whereof, shee could not refraine from blushing and smiling as if her delight and ioy thereof were such, as shee could not receive or heare it, without these publike expressions and testimonies of her private zeale and interiour affection to him; But all this notwithstanding, wheresoever shee goes or turnes her selfe, her Father as her shadow, and Palmerius as her spirit, are never from her, but still follow her in all times and places without intermission. It is a wonder to see and consider their obstinacy to make it a match, and her resolution and refusall against it, as if they were wholly composed and made of commands and shee of denialls. In which interchangeable comportment, and different carriage of theirs. Wee must allow sixe moneths time more past and slidden away, where in despight of Palmerius his importunities and her fathers power shee still remaines inflexible to them constant to her Morosini , and true to her promise. But at last this old lustfull Lover Palmerius (who was fitter to kisse an image in the Church, then so sweet and faire a yong Lady as Imperia in her bed) seeing that hee had consumed and spent so long time in vaine by courting her, and that shee sleighted him and his sute as much if not more now, than when hee first meant and intended it to her, hee bethinkes himselfe of a new policy and proposition to gaine her, which love can not so much excuse, as discretion iustly condemne in him; Hee goes to her father Bondino , and proffers him that if his daughter will become his wife, that he will infeoffe, and endow her with the one halfe of his lands, and give all the rest of his Estate and wealth into his hands and custody, for him to purchase her more. Which great and unexpected proffer of his doth solely and fully weigh downe her covetous father to Palmerius his will and desire, as hee constantly tells him; that in lieu of this his great affection and bounty to his daughter: hee will speedily use all his power and authority with her fully to dispose her to affect and content him; To which end Bondino goes to his daughter Imperia , acquaints her with this great gift, and voluntary proffer of Palmerius to her if shee will marry him. Hee lyes before her how infinitly it will import his content, and her owne good and reputation, and that few Gentlewoman of Loretto , or Ladies of the whole Marca of Anconitana , doe enioy such rich Fortunes, that his wisdome and wealth is farre to be preferred to the vanitie and prodigallity of Morosini , and that the first will assuredly bring her much content and prosperitie, but the second nothing else but poverty, ruine and misery, and therefore hee most importunately conjures and commands her to cut and cast off all delayes and so forthwith to dispose her selfe to love and marry Palmerius , or else hee vowes for ever to renounce her for his Daughter, and no more to acknowledge him selfe for her Father. A crueltie which (in my opinion and judgement) ought to bee admired with pittie and pittied with admiration, and not to serve for a precedent and Example to other Parents, because this of Bondino's was grounded on farre more passion than reason, and covetousnesse than vertue; and which Nature hath all the reasons of the world rather than to tearme tyranny then Providence or fatherly affection in him. Our Imperia is, as it were, strucke dead with griefe and sorrow, at the thunderbolt of these her Fathers cruell speeches towards her, so that shee cannot speake, nor yet weepe for sighing and sobbing, but at last encouraged by her owne Vertue, as much as shee was daunted and dismayed by her fathers severitie and crueltie towards her, shee (casting her selfe at his feete) with a trembling heart and faltering voice, returnes her heart and minde to him in these tearmes. Honoured Sir, although my afflictions and sorrowes are such, and so infinit that I am farre more capable to weepe and sigh, then to breathe or speake them forth to you, yet I hold it my dutie, not my disobedience to acquaint you, that because marriages are first made in heaven, before contracted or consummated in Earth, therefore being so happie first to love Morosini before I was so unfortunate as to see Seignior Palmerius , I hope it is the pleasure of God, that hee hath ordained the first to bee my Husband, and consequently my selfe never to bee Wife to the second; I am proud in nothing but in my humility and obedience and therein I hope I shall still both triumph and glory, and yet I farre more undervallew Palmerius wealth than you doe Morosini's vertues. If then you will not for my sake, I humblie beseech you for my Mothers sake or which is more, for Gods sake, to make mee Wife to Morosini and nor to Palmerius , because my heart and mind tells me, that I shall bee as happy in the company of the one, as miserable in that of the other. In granting mee which iust desired favour and courtesie, my sovle shall become pledge and caution for my heart, and my heart for my tongue, that you shall have no true cause, either to renounce mee for your daughter, or to deny your selfe for my Father; And to conclude this my sorrowfull and humble speech, it is impossible for you to wrong mee, but you must and will extreamely wrong your selfe, by attempting and resolving to enforce mee to the contrary; But if yet you will not bee sensible heereof, then I invoke God to bee a just witnesse, and Iudge betweene us, of your crueltie towards mee, and of my candid innocency towards you, and my betrothed spouse Morosini . Imperia had no sooner (with sighs and teares) delivered this her speech to her father on her knees, but (as if he had sightning in his eyes, and thunder in his tongue) he suddenly rusheth forth her company, when, more to displease her than to please himselfe, hee looking backe on her, gives her this sharp answer, and cruell farewell; Minion (quoth hee) I will very shortly coole thy courage and thy tongue, and make thee know with repentance, what it is to disobey thy father, in making so much esteeme of Morosini , and so little of Seignior Palmerius , contrary to my advise and request to thee, for I say, consider well with thy selfe, and thou shalt then doe well speedily to forsake this errour and obstinacy of thine, except thou resolve to die as miserable, as I desire thou shalt live happy: Once more Girle consider and remember what I have now said to thee, and beware least Morosini prove thy shame, as much as Palmerius will thy glory. Imperia weeps because shee can weepe no more at these heart-killing speeches of her father to her, against her absent Morisini : So being not well she betakes her selfe to her bed, and there againe consults with God and her selfe, what she shall doe in this perturbation of minde, and affliction of heart, and then and there (with waking eyes) reads a whole nights lecture to her selfe of her obedience to her father, and her affection and constancie to the other halfe of her selfe, Morosini ; when in the morning being prompted by her thoughts and desires, that shee shall receive more delights and joyes from the last, then discontents from the first, she at her up-rising resolves againe to write away for her Morosini , as hoping that his presence would easily dispell and scatter all these her clouds and tempests, when dispatching a private messenger to Ancona for Mercario , she againe earnestly prayes him to undertake a second voyage for her either to Aleppo or Constantinople , to her Morosini , the which he then promiseth; so that night againe perusing over his Letter, shee then from point to point punctually makes answer to it, and the next morning very secretly gives it to Mercario in her chamber, and therewith takes off a rich bracelet of sparks of Diamonds from her right arme, and prayes him to deliver it to him as a token of her true affection and constancie, the which shee affirmes to him shall, ever live and die with her. Mercario having received his commission from Imperia , as also more Gold for the discharge and defraying of his journey, hee hires a small Brigantine to transport him to Corfu , and from thence embarques himselfe on a ship of Marseilles , which accidentally stopped there, and so sailed first to Aleppo ; where being arrived in lesse than three weeks, and finding his deare friend Morosini to be Consull there for the Seigniory of Venice , he secretly delivereth this bracelet and Letter of Imperia to him in his study, where he was then hastily writing a dispatch for Constantinople: But the arrivall of Mercario , who hee knew came from his dearest friend and Mistresse Imperia , (for meere joy) made him presently to cast away his hat and pen, and so to kisse and receive this her Letter and token from him, whereof with much haste, and more affection breaking up the seales, he therein found couched these ensuing lines.  preferment had beene dearer to thee than Imperia , or that the Seigniory of Venice , or their Ambassador Landy had had more power to stay thee in Aleppo , than she to have requested or conjured thy returne to Loretto ; for if my poore beauty, or rich affection to thee, bee of so low and base an esteeme, as thou preferrest thy wealth and reputation to it, then I am as miserable as I thought my selfe happy in my choice, and the sweetnesse of my desires and wishes consequently have end, as soone as they received a beginning. And see what a palpable incongruity yea, what an apparant contradiction there is betweene thy heart and thy pen, sith feignedly endevouring to make me beleeve thou lovest my kisses  & embraces above all the Crownes and Scepters in the world, I yet am truly enforced to see that thou lovest Turkie far better than Italy , and art well contented that Palmerius should love me better than thy selfe for else thou wouldest never permit that my fathers tyranny to me should (in thy absence, give a law to my affection to him, or consent that Palmerius should be the Diamond, and thy selfe prove onely the faile of my heart and love: And if this ingratitude of thine be not a crime, I know [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) what a crime is, nor how, nor in what tearmes to define or determine thereof. Iudge therefore with thy selfe, (at least if thou art not as wholly exempt of judgement as of love) what a poore halfe, yea, what a small part I am of thee, when by thy voluntary absence thou wilt wholly reigne me up to another, and that Palmerius must be my husband, when my heart and soule, yea, when God and his Angels well know, I desire nothing under Heaven so much, as to live and die thy Wife, or else thou wouldest not have beene so unkinde, to confine thy will, or to bound thy obstinacie to no lesse than a whole yeares sequestration and absence from me, which if thy heart were equall, or but the least shadow of mine, thou wouldest deeme to containe as many moneths as houres, and as many ages as moneths. But God forbid this discourtesie of thine should prove so great a cruelty to me, or before I know what belongs to fortunacie, I should be constrained to feele and suffer so much infelicity. Come away therefore my deare Morosini , and my sighs, teares, and prayers shall implore the winds and Seas to prove propitious to thy speedy returne; and blame not me but thy selfe, if thy absence, and my fathers obstinacie bereave me of my sweet Morosini , and thee of thy Deare. Imperia.  Morosini could not refraine from blushing at the reading of this his Mistresse Imperia's Letter, as ashamed to see what an exceeding advantage her courtesie had got of his unkindnesse. He oftentimes kisseth this her Letter and bracelet, as the two sweet pledges of her sweetest love and affection to him, the which he vowes to requite, and shortly to make his returne, redeeme and ransome the ingratitude of his long stay from her. Hee shewes this Letter of hers to his two old Camerados, Astonicus and Donato , (for their friendship and familiarity is still so great, as they cannot, they will not forsake each other) who infinitely tax his unkindnesse, and condemne his inconstancie, in sequestring himselfe so long from so sweet and faire a Mistresse as Imperia . Now for the space of some ten dayes Morosini feasteth his friend Mercario in Aleppo , wherein he forgets not continually to solemnize his Imperia's health in the best and richest Greeke wines; at the end whereof (very bountifully rewarding his love and paines, for so often crossing those dangerous Seas in his behalfe) he chargeth him with his Letter in answer of his, and in requitall of her bracelet of sparks of Diamonds, he returnes and sends her a faire chaine of Gold, and a rich Diamond Ring fastned to the end thereof, with a paire of Turkish silver embroydered bracelets, and so commits him to the mercie of the winds and Seas; who in six weeks after arrives safely to Ancona , and the next morning poasts away to Loretto where repairing secretly to Bondino's house, he finds out his daughter Imperia alone, solitarily walking at the farther end of the Garden among ranks of Sicamour and Olive trees: Who no sooner espies Mercario , but all her bloud flashing into her face for joy, shee speedily trips away towards him, (who after salutes) bidding him a thousand times wellcome home, and hee giving her Morosini's Letter and token, shee clappes the last in her pocket, and hastily kissing and breaking up the seales of the first, steps aside a pace or two, and therein findes and reades these lines.  command my resolution but my selfe, and it is impossible either for my profit or reputation to give but to receive a Law thereof; for thy requests beeing to me commands, and consequently thy felicity and misery equally mine, I will therefore shorten and hasten the time of my stay and so convert a whole yeere into a few moneths: For if Imperia bee Palmerius his wife Morosini can then never bee either himselfe or his owne friend, and to write thee the life of my heart, as thou hast now the heart of thy soule, It is not the ambition of a Consulary dignity, nor all the treasure of Turkie , or the Indies , which shall keepe mee from enioying of my faire and sweet Imperia , in whose divine cheekes and eyes, my heart hath imparadized, all my most soveraigne earthly felicitie; So that I not only deny but defie that Palmerius or any other of the world, is capable to love her the thousand part or so tenderly or deerely as my selfe, to whose sake and service I will still be found readie to lay downe my best blood, and to prostitute and sacrifice my deerest Life. O then my faire and sweete Imperia live therefore my deere Wife, and Morosini will assuredly dye thy loving and constant Husband, and thou shalt briefly see that I will hate ingratitude as much as thy inconsiderate Father loves and intends crueltie towards thee, and make thee as joyfull in my presence, as thou writest mee thou art afflicted and sorrowfull in my absence. I come my sweet Imperia , and if I want windes or Seas to bring mee to thy blessed presence, my sighes shall encrease the one and my teares supply and augment the other to effect it. Prepare therefore thy heart and eies to see and salute mee, as I doe mine armes and lips to imbrace and kisse thee, and I both hope and rest confident, that my praiers and constancy seconded by thine, will make thy Fathers obstinacie vaine, and prove Palmerius his attempts and hopes ridiculous in thinking to have thee to his Wife, who art already mine, by choise and promise. Morosini.  This Letter of Morosini , affoords no small musique to the heart, or melody to the minde of our Imperia , for shee sweetly and carefully treasureth it up in her brest and memory, and now in hope of his short returne shee leaves no Church nor Chappell in or about Loretto unfrequented to pray for it, yea shee is so religious and vertuous, as shee gives her selfe wholly to prayer, the sooner to obtaine it; whiles (in the meane time) her cruell Father Bondino (contrary to her expectation and desires) cuts her out new worke, in resuming his old resolution to marry her to her old Lover Palmerius who still loves her so tenderly that for her sake, hee will not forsake Loretto to live in Ancona , so that heere the Reader is prayed to understand and know, that Bondino finally, (and once for all) to cast his daughter Imperia and her affection from Morosini to Palmerius , seeing that all other meanes will not prevaile, he infinitly debarres her of her liberty, takes away from her, her chiefest apparell and jewels (the delight and glory of young Ladies and Gentlewomen) as also her best viands and diet, and in a word intreateth her so rigorously, as (upon the matter) hee makes her more his prisoner than his Daughter. Imperia who was never heretofore acquainted with such sharpe severity and course entertainement, bites her lip and hangs her head hereat, But the more shee prayes her father to reserve her for Morosini , the more tyrannously hee commands her speedily to marry Palmerius , so that all her sighes and teares to the contrary doe rather exasperate then appease his indignation against her, and now shee findes the long stay of Morosini from her, not only to exceed her first expectation, but also his last promises to her in his Letter, and is inforced to see, that her Father is as cruell as Palmerius is obstinate and resolute in his sute to her. Shee hath nothing to comfort her but the memory and letters of Morosini , and yet nothing doth so much confound her hopes and patience, as her fathers crueltie in crossing this her affection. But at last dispairing of Morosini's returne, and vanquished by her Fathers tyranny, shee with an unwilling willingnesse) is inforced to suffer her selfe to bee overcome by him, as also to permit the walles of her affection, and the bulwarkes and fortifications of her constancy to bee battered and razed downe, by the incessant sollicitations, gifts, and prayers of Palmerius ; So that forgetting her promise, and her selfe, and putting a rape on her former resolution, shee is at last contracted and married to him, or rather to the calamities and miseries which wee shall shortly see will ensue thereof. Heere now then this old dotard Palmerius is married to faire Imperia , who esteemes himselfe as happie as shee findes her selfe unfortunate in this match. His Age is to old for her Youth, and her youth farre to young for his Age; Disparity of yeares seldome (or never) breedes any true content or felicitie in marriage. Hee cannot sufficiently estimate, much lesse deserve or requite the dainties of her youth, so that truth must heere needs implore this dispensation for mee of modesty, to affirme that his chiefest power was desire; and his best performance but lust towards her, for whiles every night, as soone as he comes to bed to her, he falls to his sleepe; so poore young Gentlewoman shee turnes to her repentance, wishing (from her very heart and soule) that her husbands bed were her grave, and that her Nuptialls had beene her funerall. A thousand times every day and night shee accuseth her Fathers crueltie and (with bitter sighes and teares) as often condemneth her owne levity and inconstancy for consenting thereunto. Shee can neither honour or love her husband, or rather not love him because shee so tenderly loves the person, and honoureth the memory of Morosini . Thus whiles Palmerius retaineth and enjoyeth our Imperia in his bed, no lesse doth shee her Morosini in her heart, so that the first hath only her body, but the second wholy her minde and affection, the sorrowfull consideration and remembrance whereof, doth so torment her heart and perplexe her minde, that shee protesteth publikely to her selfe, and privatly to all the world, that there is no calamity equall to hers, nor no misery comparable to that of a discontented bed. Thus being as much a maid as a wife, and yet more a Nunne than a maid, shee makes spirituall bookes her exercise, solitarinesse her pastime, her chamber her chappell, and her closset her Oratory to pray to God to forgive her Fathers cruelty, and her husbands indiscretion towards her, as also her owne inconstancy and treachery towards Morosini , which foule ingratitude and crime of hers shee cannot remember but with extreame griefe, nor once thinke of, but with infinite shame sorrow, and repentance. Although this her old husband Palmerius , bee so amorous and kinde to her, and so tender of this his faire young wife, that hee leaves no cost unbestowed on her, aswell in rich apparell, as chaines and Iewells, wherein the Ladies and Gentlewomen of Italy chiefly pride themselves. But this was not the content and felicity which our Imperia desired because deserved; because her fresh youth, and her husbands feeble and frozen Age, cast her heart on other opposite conceits, and her minde on other different contemplations. Whiles thus Bondino and Palmerius as much rejoyce as Imperia mournes and grieves at this her unequall and discontented match, and Morisini confidently relying on the firme affection  & constancy of his Imperia made his stay in Alepo , some 20. months longer than his promise to her. He at last led by the star of her beautie and his owne affection to her, leaves Turkie , and (in company of his constant old friends Astonicus and Donato ) sets saile for Italy , and purposly puts in with their ship into Ancona , where they and hee are no sooner arrived, but Mercario finding him out, entertaines him with the welcome of this sorrowfull newes, that his Mistris Imperia is now in this Cittie of Ancona , and married to old Signior Palmerius , whereat Morosini infinitely grieves and Astonicus and Donato much wonder. He is stricken at the heart at this sorrowfull newes, and (too too soone for him) believes it with as much affliction as admiration. By this time likewise is Imperia advertised of his and their arrivall, whereat she seemes to drowne her selfe in a whole deluge of teares; yet not for sorrow but for joy of his arrivall. He imployes Mercario to her to grant him a private visit, the which most joyfully the next night shee doth in her owne house, her old husband being in bed and snoring fast a sleepe. At Morisini's first sight and entrance into her chamber (where shee all alone privately stayes for him) shee throwes her selfe on her knees at his feet, and with sighes, teares, and blushes begges his pardon for her unconstancy in marrying Palmerius , the which shee no way attributes to his long stay, but rather to her fathers cruelty and her owne misfortune. Morosini is as joyfull of her sight as sorrowfull of this her errour, and so will not permit her to kneele, because hee sees and knowes, and also assureth her, that she is still the Goddesse of his heart and affection. Hee takes her up in his armes, and there embraceth and freely pardons her, and so they reciprocally speake each to other in the sweet language of love, I meane of kisses, sighes, and teares, with the last whereof, they againe and againe, bedew and wash each others cheekes, as if love had made them far more capable to sigh than speake, and to weepe than sigh: Here their old affections revive, and flame forth a new with more violence and impetuositie. Shee hath no power to deny him any thing, no not her selfe. For as he sweares to live her servant, so she constantly vowes to live and dye his handmaid, and that his will shall ever bee her Law, and his requests in all things her commands. Heere his heart beates for love, and her brest pants for joy. For as he promiseth her, that shee shall bee his sole and only love; so shee willingly) forgets her selfe so farre, as solemnly to protest to him, that hee shall bee more her Husband than Palmerius , when with many embraces and kisses, they for that night part. The next morning Morosini and his two consorts Astonicus , and Donato (by the feigned way of a rejoycing complement) doe visit his young Mistris Imperia , and her old husband Palmerius , who (more out of his owne goodnesse than their deserts) bids them all most kindly and courteously welcome. They congratulate with him for this his happy match with Imperia , for which, old Palmerius respectively thanks them, but he knowes not what dangerous snakes lurke under the greene leafes of this their pretended faire courtesie. As for his Wife Imperia , shee is so reserved in her comportment, and so coy in her carriage towards them, that (according to the custome of Italy ) her Husband can hardly perswade or cause her to see and salute them, the which at last shee faintly and feignedly performes, rather with an eye of disdaine than of respect. They all see the young Wife with love and pity, but looke on her old Husband with contempt and envie; yet Morosini then and there in stealth sees Imperia's heart in her eyes, when in counterchange, she knowes his heart by his enamoured lookes and countenance: So Palmerius (being as innocent as aged) having discoursed with them about their voyage, and about Turkie and Constantinople , and courteously prayed them to be no strangers to him and his house, whiles the contrary winds kept them here in Ancona , which they readily and thankfully promise him, they for this time take leave each of other, Astonichus and Donato highly applauding the beauty of Imperia , and Morosini infinitely condemning and contemning the simplicity and age of her old Husband Palmerius . But this is not all, for that very after-noone Morosini (out of the intemperate heat and passion of his love) by a confident messenger sends to pray Imperia to meet him at three of the clocke in her Garden, which was a pretty way distant from her house, the which shee joyfully grants him; and here it is where they meet, and where I am enforced to say, that in the pavillion or banquetting house of this Garden, these our two youthfull lovers (after a thousand sweet kisses and embraces) first received each of other those amorous delights and pleasures, which modesty will not, and chastity and honesty cannot permit mee to mention, as also for that these pils of sugar are most commonly candide in bitter wormwood and gall, and but too frequently prove honey to the palate, but poyson to the heart and soule. And here in this her Garden (I say againe) was the very first time and place where our faire Imperia , who was so famous in Loretto and Ancona for her piety and chastity, forgetting the first, made shipwracke of the last, and where of a Gentlewoman of honour, shee lost her honour, by committing this her beastly sinne of sensuality and Adultery. When the winds, which were contrary to Morosini's voyage, proved so favourable and propitious to his lustfull desires, that he thinks of nothing lesse than of his returne to Venice , nor of any thing so much as of his stay here in Ancona , with his faire and sweet love Imperia ; who likewise finds lesse content and pleasure in the company of her Husband Palmerius than she hoped for, and now farre more in her deare friend Morosini than she either dreamt or expected: In which triviall regard, and sinfull consideration, shee (in a manner) abandons the first, and gives her selfe wholly over to the will and pleasure of the second, and so turning the custome of these their lascivious daliances into a habit, and that into a second nature, both in her Garden, and her owne house, shee very often (both by day and night) commits this bitter-sweet sinne of Adultery with Morosini , whereof a subtill young Nephew of Palmerius , of some eighteene yeares old, who was his sisters sonne, and termed Richardo , takes exact and curious notice, and once among the rest hee peeps in at the key-hole of his Aunts chamber doore, and there sees her and Seignior Morosini on the bed together, and in no lesse familiarity than was requisite, or could be expected betwixt his Unkle her Husband Palmerius and her selfe; whereupon secretly envying and hating her, because he was afraid shee should beare away all, or at least the greatest part of his said Unkles Estate and wealth from him, (who for want of children, hoped that he therefore should be his adopted heire) he therefore malitiously beares the remembrance of this object  & accident in his mind, with an intent, that when occasion should hereafter present the report and knowledge thereof to his said Unkle, might justly cause him wholly to heave and raze her out of his good opinion & affection. As for Morosini and Imperia , they (notwithstanding all this) doe still strongly endeavour to bleare the eyes of her Husband Palmerius , who (thinking his wife to be as chaste as faire, and rather a Diana than a Lais ) out of his good nature doth sometimes in his house feast Morosini , and his two Consorts Astonicus and Donato : But they will prove pernitious and fatall guests to him, for ere long we shall see them requite this hospitality and courtesie of his, with a prodigious and treacherous ingratitude. In which meane time all Ancona resounds of the great expence and profuse prodigality of Morosini , and his two associates, for they here revell it out in the best Tavernes and companies of the City, and not onely exceed others, but also themselves, in the richnesse and bravery of their apparell, but most especially Morisini , whose apparell is every way fitter for an Italian Nobleman, than a Venetian Merchant. Our lustfull and lascivious Imperia is never well contented or pleased but in his presence, and her Husbands absence; and here to relate the truth of her heart, Morosini is more her Husband than Palmerius , or rather Palmerius is but the shadow, and Morosini the essentiall substance of her Husband, and therefore (I desire the Reader to know and remember) that in that regard and consideration I have purposely entituled this History not to be of Palmerius and Imperia , but of Morosini and Imperia . Morosini, Astonicus , and Donato (in their lodging and chambers) have many times many private speeches and conferences, what pity it is that so sweet and faire a young Gentlewoman as Imperia , should (by the constraint of her unkinde and cruell father) thus bee clogged and chained in mariage to so old a dotard as Palmerius , (for a more favourable Epithite their vanity and folly could not afford to give him) and Morosini (in the dumbe eloquence and Logicke of Imperia's sighs and teares) apparantly beleeves that (in her heart and soule) she infinitely desireth and wisheth that Palmerius were in Heaven, and himselfe now her Husband here on earth in his place: He reads as much in her looks and countenance, and is therefore confident that her heart and ambition aspire to no sweeter earthly felicity. Hee hath not lost his wit in his affection, nor wholly drowned his judgement, either in the fresh Roses and Lillies of her beauty, or in the resplendent lustre of those sparkling Diamonds and starres, her eyes. He knowes that his Estate is farre inferiour to his birth and extraction, and yet that his prodigalities and expences (both in Turkie and Italy ) are farre superiour and above his Estate: He would faigne (therefore) finde out the meanes to beare up his port, and consequently to preserve his reputation with the whole world, the which he esteemes equall to his life, if not above it. Hee knowes that Imperia is already more his Wife than her Husbands, and is very confident that he can make her apt for any impression, and capable of any designe, which may advance his owne fortunes, and confirme both their contents, whereunto conjoyning the sweetnesse of her beauty, the excellencie of her feature, and the exceeding great wealth of her old Husband, hee adding all these considerations together, they here weigh him downe to Hell  & Satan, by terminating his thoughts and fixing his heart upon this hellish resolution, to send him speedily to Heaven in a bloudy winding sheet; and no other charitable thought, or Christian consideration can divert him from this inhumane and bloudy project, neither can hee possibly reape any truce of his thoughts, or peace of his heart, before hee have attempted and finished it. To which end, the very next night that he lay and wantonized in bed with his Imperia (for God knowes her old Husband lay but seldome with her) and finding her extraordinarily to sigh, hee layes hold of this advantage, and opportunitie, and very earnestly demands of her what ayles her, whereat her tongue then fled to her heart, because her heart was then flying from God to the Divell, so shee continues her sighing, but is still mute and returnes him no answer. Till at last Morosini suspecting that in her which his hopes desired, and his desires hoped for, then I say what his demands could not obtaine of her his kisses doe, when swearing him to secresie, shee) after many farre fetcht sighes) tells him; that shee loves him so deerly and tenderly, as for his sake shee either wisheth her selfe in her grave or her husband Palmerius in Heaven which is the sweet musique and melody that Morosini expects, and which to his unexpressable joy hee now receives from her, when paying her the principall and interest of this her deerest Love and affection towards him, with many kisses; he passionately intreates her, that shee will imploy him to finish this pleasing tragedy, but shee is againe mute hereat, and therefore hee againe more earnestly entreates her to conferre this favour on him; Who then taking counsell of her Lust, and of Hell, shee grants his first request herein with silence, but his second with a free and cheerefull consent. When as two wretched and bloody miscreants) they reciprocally sweare secresie herein each to other, as also that they wil speedily dispatch him, and so in a very short time after marry each other  & no longer live in Ancona but in Venice . But what a fatall, what a hellish contract was this, which they equally confirme aswell with oathes as kisses, and how at one time do I pitty both their youth  & folly, and hate their obscene affections each to other; and their foule crimes unto God herein. They cannot content themselves with lust but with blood, for they are so resolutely inhumane and impious, as they will needs adde murther to adultery, as if one of these two foule sinnes were not enough sufficient to make both of them wretched in this life, if not miserable in that to come; but the Devill is so strong with them as they vow to advance, and disdaine to retire in the perpetration of this deplorable businesse; So from the matter they proceed to the manner hereof. Morosini proposeth poyson, but Imperia rejects this his opinion, as being dangerous both in the procuring, and administring When she propoundeth to have him stifled by night in his bed, to the which after two or three pauses and considerations, hee will and freely consenteth. So heereon they both doe finally agree and resolve. But because Morosini knowes his Imperia to be a wise and weake woman, and therefore fitter for counsell than execution, and himselfe alone peradventure not strong enough (with safetie) to performe it without some other mens assistance, he therefore tells her that hee will likewise engage his faithfull friends and companions Astonicus and Donato herein. But Imperia is extreamely against it, as grounding her apprehension and feare upon this Maxime. That as one is more capable and proper to keepe counsell then two, so consequently are two than foure. But when (in answere hereof) he vowes and sweares to her that they they are no lesse his faithfull friends and servants than hee hers; then (with much alacrity and joy) shee yeelds thereunto, so they confirming this their agreement with many oathes, and sealing it with a world of kisses hee leaves this his faire sweet-heart in bed, and at breake of day departs from her, and so hies him home to his owne Lodging to his two companions Astonicus and Donato , who (the premises considered) doe perfectly know, at what midnight Masse he hath beene, what shrine he hath visited, and what Saint adored and prayed to. Some three houres after they all call for their breakfasts, the which as soone as they have taken and ended, (for still as yet the winde is contrary for them to set saile for Venice ) Morosini prayes them forthwith to walke with him up to the Domo (or Cathedrall Church) of that Cittie which stands over it on a high rockie Hill, and there proudly lookes up toward, the Mountaines of Loretto , and Recagnati , and downe to the azurd plaines and valleyes of the Adriatique Sea (whereon Boreas rings his Northerne peales, and Neptune danceth his Southerne Lavolta's.) So here in this famous Church, (which was built for offering up religious prayers to God, and not for making up bloody conferences and contracts to, and with the Devill) Morosini first acquaints them with this businesse, and with his, and his Imperia's most earnest prayers, and affectionate requests for their assistance therein; Sith the life of her old doating Husband was no lesse their affliction and misery, then this his death would infallibly prove their prosperity, triumph and glory, because shee was formerly contracted to himselfe, long before hee marryed her: which shee was enforced and constrained to doe through the cruelty and tyrannie of her Father. Now as their needs not many good words and perswasions to base hearts, and polluted and prophane soules, who of themselves are already disposed to wickednesse, and prepared to sinfull actions. So (because of Morosini's old friendship and familiarity of Imperias beauty, and her old Husband Palmerius his exceeding great wealth and riches) these two gracelesse wretches Astonicus and Donato doe cheerefully promise Morosini , the very utmost of their possible powers for the accomplishment heereof, whereon they all three doe there solemnly and interchangeably give their hands and oathes as also for eternall secresie. Which done they returne to their Lodging; and at dinner (when they had purposly sent away their Servants, as also those of the house) they in very great glasses of Albania wine, doe on their knees drinke healths to the prosperitie of this their intended great busines: The which after dinner Morosini (with much ioy) fully relates to his Imperia , and shee (for her part) understands and receives it from him with no lesse delight and exhileration. When being (as strongly seduced  & provoked by their lacivious desires, as they were meerely propagated and engendered by the Devill who was the first and sole Author thereof, impatient of all delayes they conclude to finish this businesse the second night after, which (as I have beene credibly informed in Ascona ) was the very Eve of the purification of the blessed Uirgin Mary so famous and famoused in Loretto , and hereon these our two lustfull and lewd Lovers Morosini and Imperia doe give and take exact and curious directions each from other, both of the houre and the manner thereby the better to dispatch it, with lesse danger and more assurance and facilitie; And they are so lascivious in their wishes, so vaine and prophane in their hopes, so cruell and inhumane in their desires, and so fierce and bloody in their resolutions, as they thinke every houre an age before they see it effected. All this while our innocent and harmelesse old Palmerius , albeit hee have the will but not the power to please his young wife Imperia by night, yet by day (yea and almost every day) hee hath both the power and will to bestow some rich gifts and presents on her, and to raine downe showers of Gold into her lap, as Iove did to his faire Danae , and as one way hee held it his felicity to gaze  & contemplate on the excellency of her pure beautie, so againe he made it his delight and glory to see her flant it out in rich and brave apparell, and also to provide her the most rarest Viands and dantiest dyet that gold or silver could procure. But poore Palmerius (all this cost and courtesie of thine to thy Wife notwithstanding) I am enforced to write with equall pitty to thee, and shame to her, little dost thou conceive or thinke, what a dangerous Cockatrice or pernitious Viper thou harbourest in harbouring her in thy House, thy Bed, thy Bosome. The dismall night being now come, which these foure execrable persons have designed and destined for the finishing of this deplorable businesse. It is no sooner twelve of the Clocke by Morosini's watch, but hee with Astonicus and Donato (with their Rapiers and Pistols without any light) issue forth their Lodging, and presently trip away to Palmerius house, where (according to promise) they find the street doore a little open and Imperia (as a fury of hell) there readie to receive them, when although it were a time and place far more fitter for them to tremble than kisse; yet so fervent is the fire of Morosini & Imperias lascivious and furious affection; as they cannot yet refraine from giving each other one, or two at least. When leaving Donato (with his Rapier drawn) close within the doore, to guard and make it good against all opposing and intervening accidents, Morosini leades Imperia by her right arme, and Astonicus by the left, and so for the more securitie (purposely) leaving their shoes below with Donato , and drawing on wollen pumpes, they all three ascend the staires when shee with wonderfull silence) first conducts them to her owne Chamber (which was some two distant from her (Husbands) where the windowes being close shut, and a small waxe candle burning on her table, and her prayer booke by it wherein (still expecting the houre of midnight) shee silently read whiles the Divell held the candle to her, shee there gives each of them a pillow to worke this damnable fact, having silently given such order, that her Husbands Nephew Richardo , and all the Servants of the house, were gone to bed above three houres before: Thus this treacherous Shee-Devill Imperia (for I can no more tearme her a woman, much lesse a wife, and least of all a Christian) is the fatall guide to bloody Morosini and Astonicus , who brings them first to the doore of her old Husband Palmerius his Chamber, which shee had purposly left a little open, and then to his bed, who is deeply and soundly sleeping in his innocency towards them, as they were but too too wide waking in their inveterate malice against him, shee keeping the doore, and Morosini standing by one side of the bed and Astonicus by the other, they there in regard of his impotency and weakenesse) doe easily stifle him to death, not so much as suffering him either once to cry or screech, and then to make sure worke, hey speedily and violently thrust a small Orenge into his mouth, thereby the better to cover and colour out this their villany to the world in making all men beleeve, that it was Palmerius himselfe, who had put that Orenge into his owne mouth thereby purposely to destroy himselfe, when leaving his breathlesse body in his bed, they secretly issue forth the Chamber and shee drawes fast the door after her, and so descends with them down the staires to the street doore, where with much triumphs ioy, and thankes betweene them all; Morosini giving his Imperia many kisses, and shee desiring them all three immediately to repaire to their Lodgings, and not to stirre thence till they heare from her, which she promiseth Morosini shall be as soone as conveniently and possibly shee can, they depart home. When she first softly bolting the street doore, and then her owne chamber doore, shee presently (with much security and no repentance) betakes her selfe to her bed, where (vilde wretch that shee is) shee no more wakes for griefe at the life, but now sleepes for joy at the death of her old doating Husband Palmerius . But wee shall not goe farre before we see God convert these her triumphes into teares and this her false joy into true misery and confusion for the same, The manner thus. Whiles Morosini, Astonicus , and Donato , doe in their lodging for joy of this their bloudy fact, carowse the remainder of the night, and the next morning keepe their beds till nine of the cloke, without once thinking of God or heaven, or of fearing either Hell or Satan. Imperia putting an Angells face on her divellish heart, goes (according to her accustomed manner) about sixe of the clocke in the morning away with her waiting maid, and her prayer booke and beades in hand to heare Masse at Saint Francis (which is the gray Fryers) Church neere to the Iewes Street, with an intent to stay there in her Oraisons till past eight. But let the reader judge with what a prophane zeale, and prodigious and impious devotion shee doth it, as also farther know, that God who is the great Iudge of Heaven and Earth (in his sacred Iustice) is now resolved to bring this lamentable murthering of Palmerius to detection and light and to proclaime and publish it to the sight and knowledge of the world by a way no lesse strange than remarkeable. Within lesse than halfe an houre that Imperia went away to Masse to Saint Francis Church, an Innekeeper of Loretto who dwelt there at the signe of the Crowne named Antonio Herbas , arrives there in Ancona to Palmerius house with a letter for him from his Father Bondino , who speaking with his Nephew Richardo , hee delivereth and sendeth up the Letter to his Vnckle, who then opening the latch of his chamber doore, he no sooner entereth but with his foote hee stumbles at a paire of rich gloves, which taking up and knowing them to belong to Seignior Morofini , because some two or three daies together he had seene him weare them, he with a smile claps them into his pocket, and so giving his Uncle the good morow, he advanceth up to his bed to deliver him this Letter; When withdrawing the curtaines he (contrary to his expectation) findes him dead, and well neere cold in his bed with a whole small Orenge in his mouth, wherat he makes so lamentable and sorrowful an outcry, that the noise thereof brings up two Servants of the house to enquire and know what the cause thereof might be. Who being likewise sad spectators of this their masters sodaine and unfortunate death, they concieve and beleeve, that hee had voluntarily stopped his owne breath, and destroyed himselfe by putting this Orenge in his mouth, and that his face being blacke and swollen, was only his owne strugling for life against death; which opinion of theirs in common sence and reason was probable enough, if God had not here resolved to disprove it, in verifying and making apparant the contrary. For Richardo (who was of a pregnant wit, and of a sharpe and quicke apprehension) considering that these were Morosini's gloves which hee found there in his Vncles chamber; And his memory now telling his heart, what lascivious daliances and obscene embraces and familiarity his eyes had lately seene and known between him, and his Aunt Imperia , as also that God heretofore prompted and informed his soule, that they both had an equall share and hand in this lamentable murther of his Uncle, and that it was farre better for him justly to ruine her now, then she unjustly to begger him hereafter. Hee therefore (with teares in his eyes) prayes the Servants to stay a little while in the Chamber with his dead Vncle till his returne; and then with those gloves in his pocket, and this letter in his hand) hee speedes away to the Podestate (or criminall Iudge) of this Cittie named Seignior Loudovicus Ceranno and in a passionate and sorrowfull speech makes him know as much as himself knowes of this lamentable murther of his Vncle Palmerius , for the which hee strongly chargeth Morosini and his said Aunt Imperia to bee the Author and Actor, and so craves Iustice on them both for the same. This grave personage is very sorrowfull at this lamentable accident, and likewise at this relation and accusation of Richardo , as well for the manner thereof, as for the qualitie of the persons who he heares, and feares are interested herein, when walking a turne or two deeply contemplating hereon in his chamber, he sits himselfe down in his Chaire, and then (bidding Richardo approach neerer to him) he seriously demands of him these foure Questions. First if he were assured that these were Morosini's gloves, to which Richardo answered he perfectly knew them to bee his, for that hee had seene him weare them three or foure severall times. Secondly, where Morosini was lodged in that Cittie, whereat he replyed that he and his two associates Astonicus and Donato , lay at the signe of the ship upon the Kaye; Thirdly, where he thought his Aunt Imperia now was, whereat he tells him, shee is now in Saint Francis Church in her devotions, and fourthly what letter that was which hee held fast sealed in his hand, when hee also informed him, that this was the very same Letter, which hee formerly told him of, the which Signior, Bandino (the Father to his Aunt Imperia ) sent to his Vncle this morning from Loretto , by an Innekeeper of that Towne named Antonio Herbas , whom he said hee had brought along with him to affirme so much, the which being called up before the Podestate, hee upon his corporall oath did so, when the Podestate taking that Letter from Richardo and breaking up the seales thereof, hee findes it to speake this language.  arrivall from Turkie to Ancona ; But farre the greater, when I since understand of his long and lingring stay there, and to write thee the truth of my heart, my houghts by day, and my dreames by night doe still prompt and assure mee, that as it is likely hee will attempt something against the Chastity of thy wife my Daughter, so it is not impossible for him likewise to plot somewhat against thine owne life, for by Nature and inclination I heare be is very malitious and revengefull. If he depart speedily to Venice , then burne this Letter in Ancona which I now send the there by my Neighbour Antonio Herbas ) But if he farther protract his stay there, then speedily bring thy selfe, and thy wife away to me here in Loretto ; where my House shall be a Sanctuary for her, and a Castle and Cittadel for they self: sleight not this my carefull, and tender advise to thee, but rather resolve with confidence, that as God gave it first to my heart, so from my Heart I most affectionately now send it to thee. Bondino.  The Podestate being ascertained of all these Evidences, from the confession of Richardo , the gloves of Morosini , the Letter of Bondino, and the acknowledgment of Herbas , although hereupon hee verily beleeves that Palmerius was stifled in his bed by his Wife Imperia and her lover Morosini , yet (as a wise Iudge and a prudent magistrate) hee will informe his knowledge of one important point more, for the better disquisition and vindication of the truth of this deplorable businesse, Hee will not send any subordinate Officer, but a private friend of his to the Hoast of the Ship upon the Key, where Morosini lodged, whose name hee now knowes to bee Stephand Fundi , and that (in favour of a cup of Wine) hee should courteously allure him home to his house and presence, the which that friend of his performes, where the Podestate then told him, that hee hath beene informed by divers, that hee is an honest man, and therefore in friendly sort hee prayes him to answer him the truth of three demands which he shall make unto him. First if Morosini and his friends Astonicus and Donato lay in his house all the last night, or if not, when they went abroad, and at what houre returned. When Fundi (performing his duty  & reverence to the Podestate) tells him, that they all three, went forth of his house together the last night with their Rapiers without any lights, a little after twelve of the clocke and returned home againe a little before two as neere as hee could guesse. Secondly, the Podestate shewes him the gloves, and askes of him if he thought these were Morosini's to the which he answered, he did assure himselfe they were, for that he had many times seene him weare them. Thirdly he enquires of him if he knew where Morosini, Astonicus , and Donato now were; whereunto he made answer, that after they came home to his house the last night, they merrily carowsed and dranke in their Chamber till sixe of the clocke in the morning; that they then went to their beds, and there as yet, they all lay soundly sleeping. The Podestate having thus happily cleered all these rubs he makes no doubt they were the murtherers of Palmerius , and therfore resolves speedily to lay sure hold of them all. But hee is so solid and wise in his administration of justice, as he will adde subtiltie to his power, and discretion to his authority. First therefore in freindly manner he confines Fundi to a chamber here in his owne House to prevent that hee should not returne home to tell tales to Morosini and his associates. Then hee presently sends away two of his owne Sonnes who were gallant young Gentlemen, named Seignior Alexandro and Thomaso Ceranno (who were ignorant of all this matter) with his coach to Saint Francis Church, and when they there see the faire Gentlewoman Imperia to issue forth, then in courteous manner not to faile to bring her away in coach with them to his House, under pretext and coulour that the Lady Honoria their mother doth desire to see and speak with her, and that she will please to passe one houre with her in her garden, with whom, and where she (by the way of visits) had formerly sometimes beene. These two young Gentlemen (in obedience to their fathers commands) drive away to that Church, and presently espie Imperia on her knees who now riseth and goes forth, they follow her, and in the street with their hats in their hands do present their Lady Mothers request and errand to her, as wee have formerly heard. Imperia knowing them to bee the Podestates two Sonnes, shee at first is so infinitly perplexed, grieved and amazed hereat. Yea shee is hereupon vexed and tormented in so strange a manner, that with much perturbation of mind, she now (through her foule and guilty conscience) looks pale for sorrow, and presently red againe for shame, so that in the turning of a hand, and twinckling of an eye shee exchangeth the Lillies of her cheekes into Roses, and those Roses as soone againe into Lillies. But then (fearing her danger least when shee had all the reasons of the world both to doubt and feare it most) considering that the Podestate and the Lady his wife were her kinde and honourable good friends, and had now sent their coach for her, as also observing the faire carriage, and courteous language of these two her young sonnes towards her. Shee then (being blinded by the Devill) doth so wholly forget both her crime and her danger, her judgement and her selfe, that rejecting he feare, and composing her countenance to a modest cheerefullnesse, she willingly obeyes the mothers commands, and accepts of the Sonnes courtesie and so goes along home with them in their Coach, where being arrived. These two young Gentlemen, doe usher and conduct her up to the gallery, where not the Lady their Mother, but the Podestate their father, (accompanied with two other grave Officers of Iustice attend her comming. Their very first sight is sufficiently capable to daunt her courage with feare, and to transpierce her heart and soule with sorrow; When the Podestate calling her to him, hee with a sterne countenance gives her this thundering peale for her good morrow and breakefast. That hee is sorry to see that so faire a Gentlewoman as her selfe, should harbour and enshrine so foule a heart. That her good old Husband Seignior Palmerius is this morning found stifled to death in his bed with an Orenge in his mouth, and that he both thinkes and assures himselfe, it is done by her, and by her bloody Ruffian and Enamourato Morosini , for the which he saith he is constrained (in honour to justice) to make her Prisoner to the Pope his holinesse, his Soverainge Lord and Master, wherat this false Hipocrite Imperia (with a world of sighes and teares cries out and tells him, that she left her old Husband Palmerius in perfect health in his bed this morning, that therfore shee hopeth and trusteth in God hee is not murthered, or if hee bee, that it must needs bee done by his wretched Nephew Richardo , who impatiently gaped and hoped for his great wealth and riches, or else by some Devill in his shape, of his seducing and hiring him therunto. That Morosini is not her Ruffian or Enamourato, but a brave marchant by his profession,  & an Honorable Gentleman of Venice by birth and extraction, and that shee dares pawne her life for his that they are both of them as innocent of this foule crime, as the infants who were borne but the last night, and that shee hath farre more reason to weepe for the death of her husband, than any way to feare her owne life, because shee knowes that God is the defender of innocents, and the protector of the righteous, with many other passionate and sorrowfull speeches conducting and looking that way; but these her speeches and teares cannot prevaile with the Podestate, for both hee and his two collegues doe yet firmely beleeve that shee is guilty of this inhumane murther; So he imprisoneth her in a chamber of his owne house for that day, and intends at night to send her to the common Goale of that Citty. Now as shee is led along betwene two Ushers (or Serjeants) through a lower roome, where all the Podestates Servants and some few others of the Citty were flocked thither to see her passe by, shee infinitly more caring for her Morosini's life, and fearing his death than her own, it is her chance to espy Mercario (whom we have formerly understood shee sent with her Letters to him to Constantinople and Aleppo , and knowing that the Serjeants would then difficultly permit her to speake with any of the company, shee amidst her teares bethinkes herselfe of a pretty policy; for as shee past close by Mercario , shee purposly lets fall her gloves and wet handkerchiefe for him to take up, the which he doth; and as hee was stooping to effect it, shee secretly and swiftly rounds him in his eare thus. I pray goe instantly upon the Kaye to Morosini's lodging, and tell him that I am a prisoner in the Podestates house, for the businesse hee knowes of, and, therefore that he (and Astonicus and Donato ) doe speedily, provide for their safety; as also that if I had a thousand lives I would willingly lose and sacrifice them all for to preserve his, and that I will live and dye his most loving friend and faithfull handmaide, the which as soone as shee had uttered, shee is imprisoned in a darke Chamber: where shee hath none but her guilty conscience, the bare walles, and the two Serjeant; for her miserable comforters; and yet here (thinking to breath and draw some hope among all her dispaire and sorrowes she praies one of the Serjeants to report her humble service to the Lady Honoria the Podestates Wife, and to pray her to oblige and honour her so much as to see and speake a word with her. But she having beene informed by the Iudge her husband that he absolutly held and beleeved her to be the murtherer of her own Husband Seignior Palmerius , shee was too Honourable to grant Imperia this courtesie, and therefore (in detestation of her foule fact) highly disdained to afford her this charitie and consolation, and so slatly denies either to see or speake with her. And now doe the Podestate, and his two Colleagues sit and debate in councell with themselves, how and in what manner to surprise Morosini, Astonicus , and Donato , for although they are not sure, yet by their absence the last night from their lodging with Morosini they thinke that they two are Accessaries with him herein; First, they are of opinion to seize on their ship, which is at anchor in the Roade, termed the Realto of Venice (a name I thinke derived and taken from the marchants Exchange of that citty tearmed the Realto or else from the Realto Bridge, which (for one Arche) is doubtlesse the rarest, fairest, and richest Bridge of the world) which ship was of some three hundred Tonnes, and bore some twenty peeces of Ordinance, and then presently after to seize on themselves in their Lodging. But upon more mature deliberation, they resolve to abandon this their opinion, and so to seize on their persons, but not to arrest or make stay of their Ship and although their seale to justice, and hast for their apprehension be very great, yet Mercurio out of his respects to Imperia and affection to Morosini tripped on through the by Streetes and neerest way to the Key so swiftly, as hee had allready secretly related him and his two consorts the sorrowfull newes which Imperia sent them by him. Whereat with feare in their hearts and courages, and amazement in their lookes and countenances, they all three leape from their beds to their swords, discharge their Inne, packe up their Truncks and bagage and resolve with all possible speed to flie to their ship, and then if not with, yet against the windes to put into Sea, and for their safetie to leave Ancona , and saile for Venice . But yet here Morosini's heart is perplexed with a thousand Torments to understand of his Imperia's eminent and apparant danger, and with many Hels in stead of one to see that hee must now thus sodainly leave her deere sight and company, which hee every way esteemes no lesse then either his earthly felicity, or his Heaven upon earth. But here againe violently called away by the importunate cries of Astonicus and Donato , and yet farre more by the consideration of his owne proper feare and danger; Mercario is no sooner stollen away from them, but they all three with their swords drawne rush downe the stayres with equall intents and resolution to exchange their Inne for their Ship, and thereby to metamorphose their danger into security; But they shall see that these weake and reeling hopes of theirs will now deceive them. For they finde all doores of their Inne lockt within side, and surrounded and beleagured without, with many armed Serjeants Soldiours, and Citizens for their apprehension: And although Morosini, Astonicus and Donato were so inflamed with their youthful bloud and courage, as they were once generously resolved to sell their lives deerely, and with their Pistolls, and Swords to prefer an honourable to an infamous death, yet being farre overmastered with numbers and therefore enforced to take a Law of the stronger; Whereunto they the sooner hearken and consent in regard the Serjeants and officers doe politickly cry out to them, and pray them to yeeld, as affirming that to their knowledg their resolution and feare doth far exceed the danger of their offences. They make a vertue of necessity, and unlocking the doores of their In and chambers do cheerfully yeeld up their poisons, pistolls and swords to the Popes Officers of Iustice, who as soone conveigh them all three to the common prison of that Citty, which was the same wherein our not so sorrowfull as unfortunate Imperia was already entred, and where to her unexpressible griefe, and Morosini's unparalel'd affliction  & disconsolation, such exact charge was given of the Podestate, and such curiousheed observed and taken of the Goaler, that he could not possibly be permitted either to see or speak with her, or she with him, the which indeed they conceived to be farre more sharp than their crime, and infinitly more bitter than the consideration either of their feare or danger. Now the newes of these lamentable Accidents being speedily posted from Ancona to Loretto , our Imperia's cruell Father Bondino no sooner is ascertained thereof. But seeing his sonne in law Palmerius murthered in his bed, and his wife and his own only daughter Imperia (with her Ruffian Morosini and his two consorts) to be imprisoned as the Authors, and actors thereof, hee for the love hee bore to her life and the tender pitty and sorrow hee felt of the infamy of her approaching death, sodainly falls sicke, and dies; Wherof his imprisoned Daughter Imperia understanding, shee (in regard of his former severity towards her) is so much passionate, and so little compassionate as shee rather rejoyceth than lamenteth at it; Onely shee prayes God to forgive his soule of that crueltie of his in enforcing her to marry Palmerius , which shee knowes to bee the the originall cause, and fatall cloud from whence have proceeded all these dismall stormes of affliction, and tempests of untimely death, which shee feares must very shortly befall both her selfe, and her second selfe Morosini . Whiles thus Astonicus and Donato grieve at their hard fortune and danger, and Morosini and Imperia doe reciprocally more lament and sorrow for their separation then for their imprisonment, and that the Podestate and other officers of Iustice of Ancona are resolved first to informe the Pope, and then to expect his holinesse pleasure for the arraignment, and punishment of these foure prisoners, it pleased God, exceedingly to visit the towne of Loretto , and especially the Cittie of Ancona with the Plague, wherof many thousands in a few moneths were swept away, so by speciall commission and order from Rome, they (in company of divers other Prisoners) are conveyed to the citty of Folegnio two small dayes journey from Ancona and there to be arraigned and tried upon their lives and deaths; At which time as they past by the old, little, Citie of Tolentino where I then (in my intended travells towards Rome) lay upon my recovery of a burning leaver; When I say the nature of their crimes, and the quality of their persons made my curiosity so ambitious as to see and observe them in their severall chambers of the Inne where they that night lay which was at the signe of the Popes armes, as for Astonicus and Donato I found them to be rather sad than merry; Morosini to be farre more merry then wise, and Imperia to bee infinitly more faire than fortunate, and all of them to bee lesse sorrowfull for their affliction and danger, than for the cause thereof. Within three houres of their arrivall to Folignio they are all foure convented before the two criminall Judges, who are purposly sent from Rome thither, and are there, and then severally charged with this foule murther of stiffing, to death the old Signior Palmerius in his bed which all and every one of them apart doe stifly deny. Notwithstanding that Fundi the hoast, and Richardo the Nephew, give in evidence of strong presumption against them, and also notwithstanding of Morosini's gloves and Bondino's letter written to his Sonne in law Palmerius , and delivered by Herbas as we have formerly understood. But these two grave and prudent Iudges, yet strongly suspecting the contrary, they will not be deluded with the airy words, and sugred speeches and protestations of their pretended innocency, but consult between themselves what here to resolve on for the vindication of this truth; So at last they hold it expedient and requisite first to expose Astonicus to the torments of the Racke, the which (hee being a strong and robustuous man) hee endureth, with a firme resolution and constancy every way above himselfe, and almost beyond beliefe, and still confesseth nothing, but his innocency and ignorance of this deplorable fact, whereof the Judges resting not yet satisfied, they within an houre after adjudge Donato to the tortures of the Scarpines, who being a little timbred man, of a pale complexion and weake constitution of body, his right foote no sooner feeles the unsufferable fury of the fire, and his tormentors then confidently promising him all desired favour from his Iudges if hee will confesse the truth, but after some sorrowfull teares, and pittifull cries hee fully and amply doth, and in the same manner and forme, as in all its circumstances we have formerly understood. The which when the Iudges heare of, they cannot refraine, first from admiring and wondering thereat, and then from lamenting that personages of their ranke and quality should bee the Authors and Actors of so foule and lamentable a murther, especially of this faire Gentlewoman Imperia to her owne good old husband Palmerius . Now by this time also are Morosini, Imperia and Astonicus acquainted with this fatall confession and accusation of Donato against them for this murther, wherat they do infinitely lament  & grieve, because they are therby perfectly assured that it hath infallibly made them all three liable, and obnoxious to death, as also for that their supposed firme friend Donato proved himself so false a man, and so true a coward to be the cause therof, wherin they so much forget themselves, as they doe not once thinke, and they will not therefore remember, that the detection of this their foule murther proceeded immediatly from Heaven, and originally from the providence and justice of the Lord of Hostes. The very same after noone, the Iudges send for Morosini, Imperia and Astonicus to appeare before them in their publike tribunall of Iustice, where they first acquaint and charge them with Donatos confession and accusation against them for murthering of Palmerius , whereat they are so farre from being any way dismayed or danted, as they all doe deny, and resell his accusation, and so in high tearmes doe stand upon their innocency, and justification. But when they see Donato brought into the court in a chaire, (for his fiery torments of the Scarpines, had so cruelly scorched, and pittifully burnt away the flesh of the sole of his right foote almost to the bone that he was wholly vnable either to goe or stand) and that they were to be confronted face to face with him, as also they being also hotly terrified and threatned by the Iudges with the torments of the Racke and Scarpines, then God was so gratious to their hearts and so mercifull to their soules, that they looking mournefully each at other, shee weeping, and they sighing, and all of them dispairing of life, and too perfectly assured of death, they all confesse the whole truth of this foule fact of theirs and so confirme as much as Donato had formerly affirmed of this their bloody crime of murthering Palmerius in his bed; when one of these two reverend and grave Iudges immediately thereupon doe condemne them all foure to be hanged the next morning at the common place of execution of that cittie; although Donato because of his confession hereof (in vaine) flattered himselfe that he should receive a pardon for his life; So they are all sent backe to their prison from whence they came, where all the courtesie which the importunate requests of Morosini , and the incessant sighes and teares of Impreia an obtaine of their Iudges is that they grant them an houre of time to see, converse, and speak one with the other that night in prison, in presence of their Goalers, and some other persons before they dye. When Morosini being guided towards her chamber, such is the weakenesse of his religion towards God; and the fervency (or rather the exorbitancy) of his affection towards her that as he passeth from chamber to chamber, he is so far from once thinking much lesse fearing of death, as he absolutely beleeves he is going to a Victory, and a triumph, here Morosini with a world of sighes throwes himself into his Imperia's neck  & brest; and here Imperia with a whole deluge of teares embraceth and encloystereth her, Morosini in her armes, when after a thousand kisses, they beg pardon one of another, or being the essentiall and actuall cause each of others death, and doe enterchangeably both kisse and speake, sometimes privately, and most times publikely before the spectators, that if those reports be true which I first heard therof in Tolentino , next in Folignio , and lastly in Rome , I say to depaint and represent it at life in all its circumstances, I should then begin a second history, when I am now on the very point and period to end the first, neither in my conceit is it a taske either proper for me to undertake or pertinent for my pen to performe, because (to speak freely and ingeniously) I hold the grant and permission of this their amorous visit  & enterview in prison before they dye, to be every way more worthie of the pittie than of the gravity or piety of their Iudges. If therefore I doe not content the curiositie, I yet hope I shall satisfie the judgement of my Christian Reader, here briefly to signifie this their limited houre is no sooner past, but to the sharpe affliction of Morosini , the bitter anxiety of Imperia , they by their Goalers are separated and confined to their severall chambers, where (by the charity of their Iudges) they finde two Friers and two Nuns attending them, to prepare their soules for Heaven, and in a lesse vaine, and a more serious and religious conference to entertaine both their time, and themselves, from an Earthly to the speculation and contemplation of a divine and heavenly love, as also from them to Astonicus and Donato . But before I proceed farther, Wee must understand, that the two Fryers have not been with Morosini and the two Nuns with Imperia above an houre, But by the two Iudges there is a cheife subordinate Officer of theirs sent to prison to tel Imperia , that her Uncle Seignior Alexandro Bondino , a great Senator and famous Iudge of Rome , hath obtained her pardon of this present Pope Vrban the eighth. But shee is not [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) of glad of this newes, as shee is then curious to enquire if her Morosini bee likewise pardoned, so the Officer tells her no, and that hee absolutely must suffer death, then shee weepes farre faster than shee rejoyceth, and affirmes that shee will not live but dye. The Iudges send for her, and perswade her to live, but she begges them as importunately to give Morosini his life, as they doe her to accept and receive her owne. They tell her they have not the power to grant her the first, and she replies, that shee then hath not the will to embrace and entertaine the second. They acquaint Morosini herewith, who by their order and by their selves doe strongly perswade her hereunto, but her first answer and resolution is her last, that shee will accept of no life if he must dye, neither will hee refuse any death conditionally that shee may live to survive him. The two Friers and two Nunnes use their best Art and Oratory to perswade her hereunto, but they meet with impossibility to make her affection to Morosini , and her resolution to her selfe flexible hereunto. Her life is not halfe so pretious to her as is his, for if shee had many as shee hath but one, shee is both ready and resolute to lose and sacrifice them all for his sake, and would esteeme it her felicity that her death might redeem and ransome his life. The Judges (out of their goodnesse and charity) afford a whole day to invite and perswade her hereunto, but shee is still deafe to their requests, and still one and the same woman, desirous to live with him, or constant and resolute to dye for him. Therefore when nothing can prevaile with her, because dye he must, so dye shee will; to the which shee cheerefully prepares her selfe, with an equall affection and resolution, which I rather admire than commend in her. So the next morning they are all foure brought to the place of common execution to suffer death. Where Donato is first lifted up to the Ladder, who being fuller of paine than words said little in effect, but that he wished he had either died in Constantinople or Aleppo , or else sunke in the sea before he came to Ancona and not to have here ended his daies in misery and infamy. The next who was ordered to follow him was Astonicus , who told the world boldly and plainly, that hee cared lesse for his death than for the cause thereof, and that hee loved Morosini so perfectly and dearely, that he rather rejoyced than grieved to dye for him, only he repented himselfe for assisting to murther Palmerius , and from his heart and soule beseeched God to forgive it him, and so he was turned over. Then Morosini ascends the Ladder clad in a haire colour sattin sute and a paire of crimson silke stockings, with garters and roses edged with silver lace, being so vaine in his carriage, action, and speeches, as before hee once thought of God, hee (with a world of sighes) takes a solemne leave of his sweet heart Imperia , and with all the powers of his heart and soule prayes her to accept of his life, and so to survive him. He makes an exact and godly confession of his sinnes to God and the world, and yet neverthelesse hee is so vaine in his affection toward Imperia , as hee takes both to witnesse, that had hee a thousand lives he would cheerefully lose them all to save and preserve hers. As for Imperia such was her deere and tender affection to him, as she would faine look on him, as long as he lives, and yet she equally desires and resolves rather to dy than to see him die, and because she hath not the power, therefore she turnes her face and eies from him, and will not have the will to see him dye; When he having said his prayers and so recommended his soule into the hands of his Redeemer, he is also turned over. Now although our Imperia bee here againe and again solicited by the Iudges, Friers and Nuns to accept of her life, yet she seeing her other selfe Morosini dead, shee therefore disdaines to survive him; shee hath so much love in her heart, as she now hath little life, and lesse joy in her lookes and countenance. Shee ascends the Ladder in a plaine blacke Taffeta Gowne, a plaine thicke set Ruffe, a white Lawne Quayfe, and a long blacke Cypresse vayle over her head with a white paire of gloves, and her prayer booke in her hands. When beeing farre more capable to weepe than speake, shee casting a wonderfull sad and sorrowfull looke on her dead lover Morosini , after many volleyes of farre fetchd sighes shee delivers this short speech to that great concourse of people who from Citty and Country flocked thither to see her and them dye, Good People: I had lived more happy and not dyed so miserable if my Father Bondino had not so cruelly enforced mee to marry Palmerius whom I could not love, and to leave Morosini , whom in heart and soule I ever affected a thousand times deerer than mine owne life, and may all fathers who now see my death, or shall hereafter heare or reade this my History bee more pittifull and lesse cruell to their daughters by his Example. I doe here now suffer many deaths in one to see that my deere Morosini is dead for my sake, for had hee not loved mee deerly and I him tenderly he had never died for mee, nor I for him, with such cheerefullnesse and alacrity as now we doe. And here to deale truly with God and the world, although I could never affect or fancy my old husband Palmerius , yet now from my heart and soule I lament and repent that ever I was guilty of his innocent and untimely death, the which God forgive me, and I likewise request you all to pray unto God to forgive it me. And not to conceale or dissemble the truth of my heart, I grieve not to dye, but rather because I have no more lives to lose for my Morosini's affection and sake. I have and doe devoutly pray unto God for his soule, and so I heartily request and conjure you all to doe for mine. Thus I commend you all to happy and prosperous lives, my selfe to a pious and patient death in earth, and a joyfull and glorious resurrection in Heaven, when signing her selfe often with the signe of the crosse, she pulls her vaile downe over her face, and so praying that she might be buried in one and the same grave with Morosini , she bad the executioner performe his office, who immediatly turnes her over. And if reports be true. Never three young men, and one faire young Gentlewoman died more lamented and pittied then they. For Morosini died with more resolution than repentance, and Imperia with more repentance than resolution; thus was their lives, and thus their deaths. May wee extract wisdome out of their folly, and charity out of their cruelty, so shall wee live as happy as they died miserably and finish our daies and lives in as much content and tranquillity as they ended theirs in shame, infamy, and confusion. GODS REVENGE, AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable sinne of Murther. History XXVII.  Father Iustinian a Priest, and Adrian an Inne-keeper, poyson De Laurier , who was lodged in his house, and then bury him in his Orchard; where a moneth after a Wolfe digges him up, and devoures a great part of his body; which father Iustinian and Adrian understanding, they flie upon the same, but are afterwards both of them apprehended and hanged for it.  little signe of grace, and therefore lesse hope of our prosperity either in this life, or the next; For those are sinnes which so ecclipse our judgments, and obscure and darken our Vnderstandings, that we thereby runne blindefolded, and headlong to all misery and confusion, and make our estates so desperate, that we shall not deserve to be pitied of others, because wee would neither pitie nor compassionate others, or which is worse our selves. A deplorable example whereof, this ensewing History will present to our knowledge and consideration, in the persons of two execrable wretches which did wilfully cast away themselves, and their lives upon foule and enormous motives. May we religiously reade it to the information of our Consciences, the reformation of our lives. Monseiur De Laurier , aged of some threescore yeeres or upwards, having bin at Franckford Marte and there sold many Iewells, Bracelets, and chaines of Pearle for the which hee had there received some 1700 Crownes; as hee returned homewards with all that great summe of money, converted into double pistolls, which hee carried behind him in his cloake bag and some remaining Iewells; and in a private leather girdle next to his body, It chanced that he fell sicke on the way, whereof finding himselfe ill and weak, aud therefore both unwilling and unable to travell, hee got into a poore Countrey Taverne upon the high way, some five leagues off from the towne of Salines , where he tooke up his Lodging for that night, and there three other marchants who were in his company (whereof one was of Auxone , and the other two of Troyes in Champagne ) very unkindly forsooke him, and left him alone to himselfe; His sicknesse that night increasing (which gave him much paine and little rest) he not liking his lodging, and fearing himselfe not safe there; the next morning takes horse, and very softly rides towards Salynes , where hee arrived about some two of the clocke after dinner and went into the very first Inne which he met, at the extreamest end of the Town, at the signe of S. Denis , whereof the Hoast of the house was named Adrian , and his wife Isabella , they were both of them about some forty yeeres old, very short of stature, and weake of constitution of body, he of a cole blacke countenance, but she faire and of a palle white colour, as for him hee was of a dissolute life and carriage, extreamly given to wine and women. He was of poore Parentage and borne to no means at all, but shee was well descended, and brought him at least two thousand Crownes to her portion in marriage, the which hee had prodigally wasted, and deboshedly spent and squandered away, in following of his vitious riots and obscene pleasures and prodigalities: As for her she was of a modest carriage and of a vertuous disposition and inclination, so that by Antithesis I may well averre and affirme, that his base Vices made her sweet Vertues the more apparant and conspicuous, and her vertue his vices to all that knew them Shee made Chastity and Piety to bee the two sweet ornaments and Iumeall vertues of her life, yea to be the Elixar of her life, and the life of her soule. It was therefore an extreame griefe to her heart, and a matchlesse torment to her minde, to see the sordid actions and humors of her Husband, as being every way more capable to pitty than to remedy them. Shee grieved to see how because hee would not serve God, shee could not serve him, and therefore that hee had vitiously spent so much, as now in a manner hee had almost nothing more left to spend. The sight and knowledg whereof drownes all the pleasures of her life, insomuch as shee could sacrifice to nothing but to Sorrow and Repentance, and that which grieved her most and worst of all was to see that hee disdained her advise and counsell, and that hee was so far from reformation, as his vices grew and encreased with his yeares: and had now not only taken up a habit but a second nature in the perversity of his lewd actions and affections. All the Lillies of her joyes and the Roses of her content were turned into thornes of griefe, and briers and thistles of her vexation, insomuch as shee was farre more able to sigh than to speake forth her Calamities and miseries. He loved not his house, and which was worse he hated her company, yea his estate was so miserable, so deplorable, as hee never conversed with God in prayer, and very seldome frequented his Church, the Service or Sacraments, and to shew himselfe the more prophane he hated all Priests and Preachers of Gods holy word and ordinances, and loved none so well as his riotous and roaring companions, the very bane of the heart, and the true poyson and contagion of the soule. And into this house, and to this vitious Hoast Adrian , is our sicke De Laurier entred, for the end of his sicknesse, and the recovery of his health; and I write rather with teares than inke, that it was impossible for him to have entred into a worse; but such was his fate, such his misfortune. He likes the carriage of Isabella his Hostesse, farre better than the countenance or condition of Adrian her Husband; but as his disease gives him no truce, so consequently he can give no peace to his patience. He grieves to be sicke in an unknowne place, and among strangers, but farre more to be so farre off from his owne house, and from his onely childe and sonne Leonardo , whom hee loves farre dearer than himselfe. It is another affliction to him, that his money and some jewels are here, and not at his home, and if his judgement faile him not, he suggesteth to himselfe, that the sight and knowledge thereof may engender him farre more danger than security; but hee conceales and dissembles that, farre better than he can his sicknesse, for he puts his little Casket wherein it is, under his head and bolster. Hee causeth Adrian his Hoast to bring him a Physitian, named La Moste , who seeing his water, and feeling his pulse, tels him he is very dangerously sicke of a burning Feaver, the which to prevent, hee lets him bloud two severall dayes following and then gives him farre more hope than despaire of his health: But all this notwithstanding, De Laurier finds himselfe very weake, and his sicknesse rather much to increase, than any way to diminish. As for Isabella , according to the lawes of hospitality (which ought to be unviolable to all the world) shee tends him with much respect and diligence, and in a word, performes the part and duty, both of a good Hostesse, and of a good woman: But for her Husband Adrian , his thoughts and resolutions runne another contrary course and Carriere; for hee imagining De Laurier to bee rich, doth therefore verily hope and pray that hee may speedily die in his house, or else hee hath already swapt a bargaine with the Devill, to murther him, thereby to make up the breaches and ruines of his poore and tottering estate. He finds it a worke not onely of difficulty, but of impossibility, to know what rich stuffe hee hath in his Casket and Cloak-bagge, because hee still keeps it under his pillow; and yet gathering and wresting from him, that hee is a Goldsmith of Dijon , and that hee came now from Franckford Mart, he therefore beleeves that he hath store of Gold and Jewels about him. His poverty and his covetousnesse gives the switch to the Devill, and the Devill gives the spur to him, to raise his uncharitable contemplation into bloudy actions, and his thoughts and resolutions as so many lines, runne to terminate in this one onely Centre, which is that of De Lauriers death. He sets his wits and invention on the Tenter-hooks, to discover this imagined Indies but he finds him to be as cautious and secret in concealing, as hee himselfe is curious to bewray it. Hee purposly keeps all company from him, and will not so much as permit his Physitian or Apothecary to speake a word with him, but hee will still bee present to heare and understand it. Hee with oylie words and silken speeches, pryes into his deepest secrets, and purposly endevoureth to insinuate and screw himselfe into his familiarity. But De Laurier doth rather feare than love him, and so esteemes the revealing of his Gold to be the accelerating of his danger, to which end, with many colourable excuses and evasions, he puts him off the knowledge thereof. But hee is so miserable to see his miseries approach, because the violence and impetuosity of his Feaver doth every way advance, no way retire; and now it is that his hopes of the recovery of his health doe fade, not flourish, and rather quaile than prosper. Hee resolves to bee as Religious as hee is sicke, and therefore prayes his Hoast Adrian to bring him a Priest to give him the Sacrament; Adrian performes his request, but brings him a Priest named father Iustinian , of his owne humour and complexion, and who loves Whores and Wine, better than he doth either Heaven or God; so this unspirituall Father gives him the extreame Unction, and prepares him for his journey and transmigration from Earth to Heaven. His continuall vanities and prodigalities hath likewise made him poore, so being equall with Adrian both in Vice and Poverty, he is likewise equall, and sympathizeth with him in hope and desire to repaire his Indigence, and to enrich himselfe by the supposed treasure and death of De Laurier . But as this deboshed Priest is malitious in this his policy, so he is also polititike in this his malice, for imagining that Adrian levels and aimes with him at the same Butt and marke; he dares, but yet will not acquaint him with his bloudy purpose, to contract a hellish league and confederation with him, for the violent dispatch, and inhumane and untimely dispeeding of him away from Earth to Heaven. Whiles thus De Lauriers sicknesse and weaknes encreaseth, and his Priest and Adrians covetousnesse begins wholly to weigh downe their soules and resolutions to hasten his deplorable death; as the Priest is ready to breake his minde to Adrian , how and in what manner they should finish and compasse this bloudy businesse, Adrian contrariwise, yea, and directly contrary to the rules of Nature, and Lawes of Grace, breaks his minde hereof to his vertuous and Religious wife Isabella , whom he seeks to draw in as an Actor in this mournfull, and as an Agent in this cruell Tragedy. He is as gracelesse, as impudent in this foule and fatall attempt of his; for he sets upon her with the sweetest speech, and smoothest perswasions, that either Art could suggest, or the malice of the Devill invent or dictate to him, and therein ever and anon, leaves not to conveigh and distill in her minde, yea, and to imprint in her memory their fore-past wealth, their present poverty and misery, and the undoubted great riches of Gold and Jewels which De Laurier had with him, in that (as formerly we have observed) he very carefully day and night kept his Casket under his pillow, and in a hellish eloquence represents unto her the facility of this fact, either by Ponyard or poyson, adding withall, that the danger thereof would infallibly die with him, with a thousand other damnable alluring speeches, conducing and looking that way, which I am farre more inclinable to silence than expresse: But wretched Villaine, and execrable miscreant that hee is, hee speaks not a word, no not a syllable of God or his Justice, of Heaven or Hell, or of the foulnesse of that fact, or the just revenge and punishment incident and due thereunto. His vertuous wife Isabella is amazed and astonished at this bloudy and inhumane proposition of her Husband, and all trembling, with sighs and teares, receives it from him with no lesse true affliction and sorrow, than he delivered it her with cruelty and impiety. Her cheeks were as red for shame, as his were pale with envie thereat; when God infusing as much goodnesse into her heart and tongue, as Satan had cruelty into his soule and resolutions, she fell on her knees to his feet, and with her eyes and hands erected towards Heaven, delivered him this vertuous and Religious speech; That it was with infinite griefe and amazement that shee understood this his bloudy position to her, which he knew she could derive from none but Hel and Satan: She represents to him (with much griefe and passion) that as punishment is ever the reward of sinne, so that of all sinnes murther was the foulest, and the most pernitious and diabolicall. She tels him farther, that covetousnesse is the root of all mischiefe, that for her part she is as thankfull to God, as he is displeased with himselfe for their povertie, and that shee would ever choose rather to live in want, than to dye in shame and misery, and which is worst of all either to live or dye in the horrours and terrours of a guilty and ulcerated Conscience. That it is a prophane and prodigious impiety to violate the lawes of Hospitality, but a fearefull, yea a horrible crime, to kill any one under our owne roofe, and who (in the right of humanity and christianity) comes to us for shelter and protection. When rising againe from her knees, shee takes him about the neck and (bedewing his cheekes with her teares) conjures and prayes him, by the remembrance of her youth and beautie, which had formerly beene so deere and pretious to him, by the memory of their sixteene yeares sweet cohabitation and conversation together in the holy Estate of Wedlocke, yea for his owne sake, for his soules sake, and for Gods sake, that hee would defie this divell, which thus with his two bitter sweet pills of Covetousnesse and Murther mocked and sought to betray him: and that therefore (in the name and feare of God) hee would henceforth resume, and put on a constant and religious resolution, no more to seduce her, or to suffer himselfe to bee seduced by the Devill in imbruing their guilty hands in the innocent blood of this honest and harmelesse Goldsmith De Laurier , whom God hath now made their guest and Lodger; In doing whereof (quoth shee) the same our sacred Lord and God, (in his due time) will bee gratiously pleased to encrease our estate and means and to blesse our povertie with plenty. But her Husband Adrian (as a most wretched Villane takes this godly refusall and deniall of his Wife in ill part, and in requitall and consideration thereof, henceforth lookes on her with a squint eye, I meane with an eye rather of contempt and envie than of affection; But at board, and bed, yea day and night he haunts her as a ghost, and never leaves pursuing of her with his prophane and importunate solicitations to draw her consent to the acting and perpetrating of this bloody businesse; But God so well assisted her minde and thoughts, with the grace of his holy Spirit, and so divinely fortified her heart and soule with his sacred feare, that her Husbands sweet perswasions could not gaine, nor his threats or menaces obtaine any thing of her but still shee answered this murtherous request of his, sometimes with religious refusalls, and then againe with passionate and peremptory denialls, and therefore the more that shee sees her Husband bent to maligne and hate De Laurier , the more devoted and resolute shee is to respect and tend him, still bearing a curious, a carefull, and a vigilant eye over him during all the time of his sicknesse to see that no disaster whatsoever might befall him in her house Adrian missing of this his purpose and desire in his Wife hee is yet so hastie and violent in this his bloody malice towards De Laurier , that measuring of Father Iustinian the Priest, by himselfe, and finding a conformity in their deboshed vices and inclinations, hee the sooner hopes to finde a sympathy in their affections and resolutions, and therefore although hee bee a Priest, yet knowing him to bee extreame poore, hee therefore the more easily beleeves, that the hope of Gold and Silver will act wonders with him, and make him act wonders for the obtaining thereof. Upon these hopes, and this confidence, hee delayes no time, but on a Munday morning repaires to his house, and after their morning cups, telling him he hath a secret of great importance to reveale him, he takes him into a little Grove of Walnut Trees, behinde his house and there (swearing him to secresie) reveales him this his bloody businesse, where this vitious Priest Iustinian , in hope of De Lauriers wealth needed no great labour or industrie to be drawn to make one in this deplorable Tragedy. For had not Adrian now opened it to him, such was his insatiable thirst and desire of gold though with bloud, that the next day he was fullie resolved to doe it to him, so he freely consents to him herein, and sweares to assist and second him in murthering of De Laurier and the tye and condition of this their hellish bargaine is, that what gold, silver, or jewells they shall finde him to have, they will instantly after his death equally divide and share betweene them; and hereunto like two bloody hellhounds, they enterchangeably give hands, and solemnly sweare each to other. Now from the matter of this their bloody designe and resolution, they proceed to the manner and time thereof, but they then are prevented therein, For Father Iustinians little Boy which was accustomed to answer him at Masse comes thither hastily and with his little wine pot on his finger tells him, that there were many persons who stayed for him before the Altar on their knees and earnestly enquired for him to say Masse, whereupon they both referre the conclusion hereof to the very next morning, and in the very same place and Grove, but at least an houre sooner; So away goes Adrian home to his house, and away likewise trips Father Iustinian with his Surplesse under his arme and his Breviary (or Matines booke) in his hand to the Church, where every one may imagine what a prophane sacrifice, his bloody heart and hands offereth up to the Lord. They this night thinking of nothing but of gold and blood, in the morning they (impatient of all delayes) come at the aforesaid time and place of their rendezvous where they presently fall to their former consultation of the manner and time of murthering De Laurier , first, they propose to stabbe him in his bed to death, but this they reject, because the blood would appeare in the sheets, bed, and chamber; So they resolve to poyson him, and to this end Adrian buies the poyson and Father Iustinian will give and administer it to him in a wafer or Agnus Dei , the which hee is sometimes accustomed to give him in his sicknesse; But here father Iustinian suggesteth another doubt; and proposeth another designe, which is that Adrian must likewise draw in his wife Isabella to make one in this bloody conspiracy and murther, or else hee alleadgeth that it can never bee safe for them to attempt or effect it; Adrian answereth him that hee hath heretofore with his best power and art sought to seduce his wife hereunto, but that hee finds it wholly impossible to draw her to this consent: But father Iustinian will yet make another tryall and experiment on her himselfe, so hee and her Husband Adrian set afresh on her, to allure her to bring at least her consent, if not her hand to the murthering of De Laurier . But our sweet and vertuous Isabella is still one and the same woman, for shee heares these bloody speeches and perswasions of theirs, with infinite discontent and detestation. Shee is too much a Christian to bee so much a Devill to consent to the murther of this honest man; and therfore (with a world of teares and prayers) shee seekes to divert them from it, but especially her Husband, because (quoth shee) the issue thereof will infallibly prove ruinous to them both. They are both much grieved at this her resolute repulse and deniall, and yet to make a vertue of necessity, and to cast the better glosse and varnish on their villany, they now falsly seeme to bee diswaded from this murther, by the sight of her teares and the consideration of her requests and prayers; Wherfore with a prophane  & hellish dissimulation) they tell her, that God by her religious speeches and disswasions hath now made them wholly to abandon that bloody attempt of theirs against De Laurier , as also the very thought thereof, and therefore they conjure her to keepe and sweare secresie herein from all the world, the which she willingly doth. But yet her feare prompts her heart, that this humane conversion, and religious resolution of theirs is only false and faigned, as every way savouring more of dissimulation than truth. In which regard shee feares with suspition, and suspects with doubt, that no lesse than honest and innocent De Lauriers life, lies now at the stake of their bloudy malice and envie. Here Father Iustinian , and Adrian (to make smooth and cleere work) do conclude and resolve that Isabella must bee speedily removed from Salines to some place in the countrey without once seeing or speaking with De Laurier when a favourable occasion seconds their damnable intents, and desires her in: for now there is unexpectedly brought them word, that her owne old Father who dwelt some foure leagues off from Salines is very sicke and not like to live; Whereupon Adrian presently dispatcheth away his wife Isabella to him, and with her their Servant maide Graceta . But before hir departure shee is desirous to see De Laurier , and to take her leave of him; but her Husband will by no meanes permit her; So shee goes from her home, and from him into the Country, with a sorrowfull and a trembling heart, as farre more fearing De Lauriers unnaturall death, then doubting of her fathers naturall case. For her heart frames her so many apprehensions, feares, and terrours; that her husband and father Iustinian are fully resolved to murther and make away De Laurier , as shee absolutely and sorrowfully beleeves, that hee shall never see her more nor she him. Poore De Laurier takes his Hostesse Isabellas sodaine and unexpected departure from him very pensively and heavily, and far the more in that shee could not bee permitted to see him before shee went. He holds it for a bad presage, and fatall Omen to him, in regard she was as diligent as her Husband distrustfull to him, for that her care and carriage towards him, pleased him as much as his harsh lookes and soure countenance discontented him; and now it is that God first imprints in his heart and thoughts, a fearefull suspition and a suspitious feare, that his Hoast Adrian , and father Iustinian the Priest have assuredly some dangerous and execrable plot, both against his gold and his life. For hee now sees himselfe reduced to this misery and despaire, that hee can bee permitted to see no body, nor no body to see him, except onely they two. Hee prayes them both, that his Phisition La Motte may come to him to conferre with him about the state of his sicknesse, but they malitiously and willfully deny it him, and tell him hee is gone into France ; This refusing answer of theirs doth now very much appale and daunt our sicke and discontented De Laurier , so that his feare encreaseth with his sicknesse, and his sicknesse with his feare. Every day and night brings him more cause of dispaire, than hope of consolation, and almost every moment hee wisheth his gold and himselfe in Dijon with his Sonne Du Pont , or he heere in Salynes with him, to comfort him with his sight and presence. He still conceales his gold and Iewell from this Posest and his Hoast, with the greatest art and care hee can, and prithee thinkes and feares that their ielousie thereof is not onely the foundation, but will also prove the acceleration of his danger, for he very often sees them privatly whispering together and still hee observes some bad signe and and fatall apparition in their lookes and countenances, which infallibly tell him that all is not well. And although they yet give him some sweet words and sugred speeches, yet hee notwithstanding the more beleeves that they are candide in wormewood and confected in gall; and that they are no other but false and flattering Sune shines, which portend some ensewing cruel storms and dismall tempests towards him. Once he was minded to write and send to Dijon for his Son, but then hee as soone resolves the contrary, as finding it to relish more of danger than discretion, aswell for the matter which his letter might contain, as also for the party who should carry it thither to him. But leave we him a little to his weaknes, and sicknes to his doubts and feares, and to his sorrowes, calamities and perplexities, and come wee againe to speake of wretched Adrian his Hoast, and of prophane father Iustinian the Priest, to see in what shapes they will come forth to act their bloody parts upon the stage of this History. They are both of them so inhumane and cruell in their resolution to murther poore sicke De Laurier , that neither the consideration of Heaven not Hell is capable to reclaime or divert them from this their bloody attempt. As fos his hellish hoast Adrian , hee is so willfull and hastie in his malice, as hee tels father Iustinian , that they delay too long from murthering De Laurier , and that it is high time yea more than time for them to dispatch him. But for father Iustinian who was no lesse malitious in his subtilty, but yet farre more subtill in his malice towards De Laurier . Hee I say maturely considering that it were both a folly and a madnesse for them to murther him before they first knew hee were rich, and that hee had some store of gold about him hee therefore in sweet tearmes and phrases pathetically adviseth him to write and send for his Sonne Du Pont , to come over to visit and comfort him, when likewise the better to guild over his speeches with the more pleasing and palpable shew of affection hee proffereth to ride to Dijon himselfe to deliver it him with his own hands. Our poore sicke De Laurier taking this Priests kinde advise to him in good part, hee thereupon first thankes him for this his courtesie, but then againe deeming and fearing that it proceeded more from false treachery, than from any true or reall affection to him, hee begins to grow cold therein, and so rather to reject, than embrace and follow that resolution; But at last weighing and considering his sicknesse by his danger, and his gold and jewells by both, as also if he should chance to dye or miscarry there, that his Sonne were then consequently ruined in the losse thereof; Hee thereupon changeth his resolution; and presently resolves to write and send over to Dijon for his Son and to that end requesteth Father Iustinian to excuse him, and so prayes his Hoast Adrian to undertake that journey and businesse, the which hee willingly and cheerefully granteth. Now the rest of that day and the greatest part of the next night De Laurier lies ruminating and musing in his bed what he should write to his Sonne, and no lesse doth father Iustinian and Adrian to thinke and know what hee would write him. The next morning, sixe of the clocke having strucken, De Laurier takes his pen and paper, and with a weake and trembling hand writes his Letter to his Sonne: An houre after, Adrian comes into his Chamber booted and spurred to receive his commands, whom hee had to take and ride his owne horse, then gives him foure double pistols to defray his journey, and so seales and gives him this ensewing Letter, and prayes him and his Sonne Du Pont to make all possible speed backe from Dijon to him.  Salynes where I still lie very weake in body and much discontented in minde in the House of mine Hoast Adrian (the bearer hereof) whom I purposly send over to thee, to pray and command thee to come ride hither to me with all possible speed, I have herewith me in gold and Iewells to the vallew of one thousand seven hundred Crownes, and for some private reasons) I feare that neither it nor my life is safe here; Come away with an intent to finde me dead or dying. Conceale this Letter from all the world. Love this Messenger but trust him not; God prosper my Health, and ever blesse thy prosperity. De Lavrier.  As soone as De Laurier had delivered his Hoast Adrian this Letter, and he taken leave of him, father Iustinian begs leave of De Laurier to see Adrian take horse. But alas these two lewd Villaines doe deceive his honest hopes, to performe their own treacherous Intents and purposes; For they fly to a low parler, and then locke and bolt the doore to them; where (as if the devill had throwne them on covetousnesse, or covetousnesse on the devill) they hastily breake up the seales of De Lauriers' letter to his Sonne (which we have already seene and understood) wherein they glut and surfet their hopes with joy of this new desired treasure and discovered Indyes , and so they presently sacrifice it to the fire, and wretchedly resolve to make that very same ensuing night to bee the very last of De Lauriers time and the first of his eternity. To which end Adrian husheth himselfe up privately in his house from the sight of all the world, and especially from De Lauriers knowledge and so here he ends his pretended, but not his intended journy to Dijon , before he begin it: And hee having procured exceeding strong poyson therewith that night to send De Laurier to Heaven whereof giving a little to his great old massive dog in a peece of bread for a triall he therewith presently fell dead to the ground; he likewise sends away Thomas his Ostler a dayes journey into the Country upon some feigned businesse, to the end hee should bee no witnesse of this foule and cruell fact of theirs and then all things being first by the devill, and then by these his two execrable agents prepared in a readinesse; Father Iustinian goes up to De Lauriers chamber, and treacherously entertaines him with the hope of his recovery of his health, the hast of Adrians Iourney, and consequently with the speedy returne of his Sonne Du Pont to him from Dijon . But I write it with truth and griefe, that De Lauriers heart and mind is preoccupated with too many obnoxious apprehensions and feares, and taken up with too much doubt and dispaire to the contrary; For as most sicknesses and diseases are most commonly devanced and preceeded by their symptomes so all that day and all that evening he found a swimming in his head, and his sight obscured and darkened, as if some blacke scarfe, or fatall cloud had been drawn and extended before his eyes. His heart likewise pants, beats and trembles within him, as if it and his senses were in a factious mutinie each with other at this their direfull departure and fatall sequestration. For still his feares and doubts informe him, and his apprehensions and dispaire prompt him that either father Iustinian the Priest, or his Hoast Adrian , or both of them, had conspired to murther him, the which hee once thought to have revealed to Father Iustinian , but yet againe he dares not, as holding it more folly than discretion, and that it might therefore produce him more danger than safety; he neither can nor will eat any thing that day, and his heart and minde is so incessantly perplexed with feare, that he feares he shall not out- live the next ensuing night: And now indeed comes that sorrowfull and dismall night, wherin these two bloudy Villaines have fully resolved to poyson him, Adrian having in a lower roome the poyson ready, and Father Iustinian above, almost ready to call for it: Whiles thus the candle in De Lauriers chamber burnt dimme and obscure, as disdaining to see, or bee accessary to so cruell a murther; neare about twelve of the clocke of that night hee awakes out of his sorrowfull distracted slumbers, and prayes Father Iustinian to give him a little spoonfull or two of warme wine, in a small earthen pot wherein he was used to drinke; when this monster of men rejoycing for this fit opportunity, hee steps forth to his bloudy companion Adrian , takes the poysoned wafer from him, and powres the poyson from it into this small blacke pot of wine, and so warmes it a little by the fire in De Lauriers chamber, and then gives it to him to drinke, the which he as greedily as innocently doth, whereof, after many strong convulsions and struglings, he within one houre after dieth having neither the meanes to utter one word, or the power to scritch or cry, and yet for feare and doubt hereof, like two furies, or Devils incarnate of Hell, they with the bed-staves ramme in a great holland towell into his mouth, that he may tell no tales, when God knowes that deadly strong poyson had wrought its operation before, made a full conquest of his life, and given up his soule into the hands of his Redeemer, of whom he had formerly received it. As sooone as these two wretched miscreants have dispatched this lamentable businesse, then they teare off his secret leather girdle full of gold from his waste, and then breake open his Casket which was under his pillow, wherein (before his breathlesse body was halfe cold) they finde this aforesaid great summe of Gold and Iewels, the which they presently divide, and equally share betweene them, when having curiously searched his purse, pockets, doublet and hose, they make a great fire, and immediately burne it all, as also his riding Coat, Casket, and leather Girdle, yea, and his hat, band and cuffes, that no marks might remaine either of it or him, and likewise turne his horse into the open field and hye-wayes, to seeke for the fortune of a new Master; so wise (as they thought) were they in their villany, and so industrious and cautious in this their devillish cruelty and inhumanity. By this time, as the murthered corps of De Laurier growes cold, these two Factors of Hell likewise beginne to provide for his buriall; so a little after two of the clocke, they digge a pit in Adrians Orchard, next adjoyning to his house, and so giving him no other winding sheet or coffin but his shirt, they secretly and silently carry downe his body betweene them, and there bury him, and to make all things sure, they cover over the pit, or his grave with greene turffes, that no mortall eye might take suspition or notice thereof. This bloudy businesse being thus acted and perpetrated by these two execrable wretches, Father Iustinian and Adrian , who now surfet in Gold, and wallow in Iewels, they presently dight themselves into new apparell, and costly suits, and then day and night haunt and frequent the Tavernes and Stewes, as if they wilfully meant to drowne themselves in all sorts of ungodly riots, prodigalities and voluptuousnesse, whereof their neighbours, yea, all Salynes take exact observation and knowledge, as wondring at the manner, but farre more at the cause thereof, or from whence it should proceed. Some three weeks being past over, Adrian now holds it fit to send home for his wife Isabella to Salynes , the which hee doth, who much wondring at her Husbands unaccustomed bravery, she presently enquires of him for Monsieur De Laurier , as if she had farre more cause to doubt and feare of his danger, than any way to assure her selfe of his safety and welfare: When, he putting on a brazen face, and steeling and tempering his tongue with equall falsehood and impiety, tels her that hee departed thence safe and well some ten dayes since; that he gave him fifty crowns for the charges of his entertainment and lodging, and for a token of his love, had likewise left her and Father Iustinian , to each of them twenty other Crownes in Gold: But his wife Isabella out of her goodnesse and piety) deeming these speeches of her Husbands to be as false as fatall, and verily suspecting and fearing, that he (with the assistance of Father Iustinian ) had sent that harmlesse good old man to an untimely death and grave; shee bursts forth into immoderate sighs and teares, as suspecting all was not well, yea, fearing nothing more, and beleeving nothing lesse, than that which hee affirmed to her herein. He proffers her the twenty Crownes in Gold, but (good vertuous woman) she fearing it to bee the hire and price of innocent bloud, her tender conscience is too prevalent, and her harmlesse heart and soule too powerful with God to accept therof, and therfore she refuseth it with as much disdaine and discontent, as he endeavoureth to give it her with affection and desire. And that the Reader may the more fully be informed of her integrity and charity herein, I mean to the present memory and well wishes of absent De Laurier , whom she silently feares is for ever absent, both from this life  & this world; she never goes into the chamber where he lay sicke, but she sacrificeth some sighs to sorrow in his behalfe, and her imaginary apprehension of his death, makes her mournfully conceive, that either shee still sees his living picture, or his dead ghost and representation, such was her charitable care of him, such her Christian feare for him. We have seene this deplorable and cruell murther committed on the harmlesse person of old De Laurier , by these two members of Satan, Adrian , and Father Iustinian the Priest, and if the truth deceive not my hopes, wee shall not proceed much farther in this their Historie, but we shall see Gods just Iudgements miraculously to resplend and shine forth in his punishments on them for the same: For I may properly tearme murther and punishment to be Individuals and Companions, in regard the one followes the other, as the shadow doth the body, as the first derives its originall from Satan, so doth the second from God, to whom (in a language of bloud) it stil cries for restauration and satisfaction. But neverthelesse God is as secret as sacred in disposing of the manner and time thereof, and in ordaining by whom, when and how he will afflict and execute it: It is no false axiome in Philosophy, but a true tenent and maxime in Divinity; That God who made all things, sees and governes all things, and that nothing can be concealed from the eyes of his sacred Power and divine Providence: All the foure Elements are the ministers of his justice, yea, Men and Angels, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres; the fowles of the aire, and the beasts of the field prove many times the Agents of his Revenge; of which last sort and nature, the Reader (to Gods glory, and his owne information and admiration) may here obserue a lively example, and receive a most powerfull president; but whether more strange for the truth, or rare for the strangenesse thereof I know not, and therefore will not define. For the same day moneth next after, that Adrian and father Iustinian had buried the dead body of De Laurier , behold a huge and ravening Wolfe (being lately arroused from the the adjacent vast woods) seeking up and downe for his prey, came into Adrians Orchard next adjoyning to his house (purposly sent thither by God as a minister of his sacred justice and revenge) who senting some dead carrion (which indeed was the dead Corpes of De Laurier , that was but shallowly buried there in the ground) hee fiercely with his pawes and nose tares up the Earth, and at last pulls and dragges it up, and there till an houre after the breake of day remaines devouring and eating up of the flesh of his armes legges, thighes, and buttocks. But (as God would have it) hee never touched any part of his face, but leaves it fully undisfigured; When instantly some Gentlemen hunters of Salynes , and the Neighbour parishes, being ascertained by some Peasants in the fields, that the Wolfe was past that way, they closely follow him with their Dogges and Hornes, and so at last finde him in Adrians Orchard, eating as they thinke of some living beast or dead carrion; But the Wolfe being terrified with the noise of the hunters loud shoutes and cryes, as also of their Dogges fierce yawling and bawling, presently forsakes his prey, and saves his life by his flight, although the Dogges and many Peasants doe eagerly pursue him; Whiles all the Gentlemen (as if led by the immediate finger of God) with their Iavelins and boarespeares in their hands, rush into the Orchard to see and finde out whereon the Wolfe had preyed, when loe (contrary to their expectations) their amazed eyes are enforced to behold the pitifull spectacle, and lamentable object of a mangled dead mans body, miserably devoured and eaten by that savage Wolfe, and the which they saw he had digged and torne vp, as they fully beleeved from his untimely grave: They therefore at first stand astonished with griefe, and amazed for sorrow at this prodigious and deplorable sight, and yet such was their living compunction to this dead corpes, and consequently their zeale to Gods glory and Iustice, as confidently beleeving that he was proditoriously murthered by some inhumane person or persons; that the odious stinch of this long buried body; could not hinder them from approaching to survey and behold it; They find the greatest part of the flesh of his body devoured by the Wolfe, but (as before) his face whole and untouched, when they see (and extreamly grieve and sorrow to see) that it was a grave old man with a long white beard, but so besmeared with earth and dust as they could not restraine from sighes and teares to behold it. Here they cease to pursue the Wolfe, and because neither of them knew this poore and miserable dead carkase, they therefore step to the other end of the Orchard, and there consult what is fit to bee done in this lamentable businesse and accident. But their opinions as so many lines concur and terminate in this centre, that absolutely this dead body was cruelly murthered, and there by the murtherers privately and silently buried. They farther vehemently suspect and beleeve, that because it was buried in Adrians Orchard, that therefore it was apparantly probable, it was hee with his wife and Servants who had murthered and buried him there, wherefore to keepe these suspected bloody birdes in their Cages, they (as wise and juditious Gentlemen) place a strong guard of their Servants and Peasants to watch the doores and windowes of Adrians house, that none issue forth thence, and they themselves goe presently to the Criminall judges of the Towne, and acquaint them with this lamentable object and accident. In the mean our harmelesse and vertuous Isabella , hearing these loud shouts and outcries at her doores so soone in the morning, shee in the absence of her Husband; (who lay forth of his house that night deboshing and revelling with his cups and Queanes) fearing that all was not well, and therefore her amazed and sorrowfull heart; not willing to know that whereof shee was infinitely desirous to bee ignorant, shee lay still bitterly sighing and weeping in her bed, because her thoughts and mind, her suspitions and feares told her, that this unseasonable alarum and noise might descend and reflect from some fatal newes which had betided De Laurier , and if this storme and tempest fell not on her, yet alas shee extreamely feares and doubts it would fall on Adrian her husband, whom shee vehemently thought and feared had imbrued and imbathed his hands in the innocent blood of this honest man. As for Thomas her Ostler, and Gracetta her maid, although this unaccustomed noise made them sodainly forsake their beds and apparell themselves to receive their mistris commands how they should beare themselves in this hurly burly, yet because they were white with innocency, yea so innocent as they knew no hurt, or thought of danger they only deemed, that it was either some unlawfull assembly of Peasants, or else some cast and disbanded souldiers from Flanders who came to rob their masters house or poultry in his absence, wherfore meere feare hereof, kept them from either opening the doores, or looking out at windowes. By this time the Gentlemen hunters bring the criminall Iudges on the place to view this dead body, and with them come a great number of the Neighbours and Inhabitants of Salynes to doe the like, and amongst the rest, the Physitian La Motte (of whom this History hath already made mention and he of all the rest knowes the dead body, and therefore with much passion and sorrow cries out: that it was a Gold-smith of Dijon named Monsieur De Laurier , who lay long sicke in Adrians house, and that hee had formerly given him Physicke there, and so hee said and affirmed that hee perfectly knew him to be the same, and verily imagined that he was brought to some untimely end, and so buried there, but by whom he knew not. The Iudges therefore beleeving the report of this honest Physitian La Motte ; they cause the remainders of the flesh of this dead body to be searched and visited, the which they finde without any wounds. And yet neverthelesse deeming both Adrian , his wife Isabella , and their Servants to bee the murtherers of this honest man; they breake open the doores, and missing Adrian they seize on his wife Isabella , as also on her Ostler Thomas , and his maide Graceta and then bring them to the sight of this dead body with whose murther they flatly charge them, and enquire what is become of Adrian himselfe. At this unexpected sorrowfull newes and object, Isabella is all in Teares, yea shee is so extreamly perplexed and afflicted, as wanting all other assistance and comfort shee implores that of God. Shee tells them that her Husband Adrian lay not at home with her the last night, and freely and plainely affirmes to them; that that dead body was Monsieur De Laurier a Gold-smith of Dijon , who lay long sicke in her house as he came from Frankford Mart, but how he came to his end or by whom, shee takes heaven and earth to witnesse shee knowes not, and with this her deposition doe her Ostler and maid concurre, and agree in all proofes and circumstances. The Iudges likewise causing a curious search to be made in Salynes for Adrian , it was found out that that night he lay in father Iustinians house the Priest, and two whores in their Company drinking and revelling all night, and upon the very first report they heard of De Lauriers unburiall by a Wolfe, they both (galled with guilty consciences) betake themselves to their heeles, and left both their two Strumpets to their repentance. Their flight proclaimes their guiltinesse of this murther to all the world especially to the Iudges. Who upon knowledge thereof to finde out the truth of this deplorable disaster, they adjudge Isabella; Thomas and Graceta to the racke: As for Thomas and Graceta , their innocency makes them brooke their torments with admirable patience and constancy, for they can never bee drawne to reveale that of which they are ignorant nor to accuse themselves of that wherof they are not guilty. But for Isabella the incessant prayers and importunate requests and solicitations of many of her honest neighbours, doth ingrave such deep impressions of her vertues and piety, and of her sweet inclination and disposition in the hearts of the iudges, as they change their resolutions against her and so dispence with her for that torture. When sending every way abroad to pursue Adrian and father Iustinian they content themselves to keepe the Mistris, the man and the maid close prisoners. They are so advised in their iudgments, and so juditious in their advise, as they speedily send away Poast to Dijon to acquaint Du Pont the Sonne, with this disasterous accident which had betided his father De Laurier here in Salynes , who at the first alarum of this sad unexpected newes, seemes now to drowne himselfe in his teares thereat, and so thereupon rather to flye than poast away from Dijon to Salynes where hee confers with the criminall Iudges of that Town, who report to him the flight of father Iustinian and Adrian , as also of their imprisoning of his wife Isabella , of her maid Graceta , and her Ostler Thomas , in whose house his father lay sick. So Du Pont visits the dead, stinking, mangled body, and findes it to be that of his father, wherat nature and duty prescribe him so powerful a Law, as at the sight thereof, he bursts forth into many bitter teares and lamentable cries and passions. When giving him a decent and solemn burial in the next Church, he then informes the Iudges, that to his knowledge his father had good store of gold and jewells about him, so hee entreats them, that Adrian and father Iustinians houses maybe curiously searched for the same, which is performed, but finding no part thereof, and both of them fled, he is confident in his heart, that their flight proclaimes them guilty of his fathers murther, and consequently that Isabella her Ostler and maid infallibly were accessaries thereunto: Whereupon he repaires againe to the Iudges, and with many importunities prayes them that all three of them may be put to the rack for the same, thereby to bolt and find out the truth of this lamentable accident, the judges approve of Du Ponts living affection and zeale to his dead father, but (as impartiall Oracles and Officers of Iustice) they tell him that they have already caused Thomas and Graceta to be racked, and that they both have strongly justified their innocency of his fathers Murther, by suffering their torments with incredible fortitude and patience. And as for their Mistris Isabella . They tell him they are fully resolved and assured, that shee was absolutely innocent, aswell for that shee was many daies absent with her father in the Country, when by all likelihood and circumstance, his father was murthered, as also because the generall votes and voices of all her neighbours reported her to bee a very vertuous and religious woman, and that therefore in their hearts and consciences, they must needs exempt and free her from those torments. But they told him farther, that in honour to justice, and to see what God and time might produce, they would detaine them all three in Prison for the space of three or foure moneths, in which meane time concurring with him in opinion that father Iustinian and Adrian undoubtedly were the murtherers of his father De Laurier , they therefore perswade him with all possible speed and diligence to pursue them up and downe the Countrey, untill hee had detected, apprehended, and brought them to justice; the which Du Pont doth, but with such extraordinary zeale and hast, that he forgat a singular circumstance, of no meane importance, the omission whereof might very well have made his research of them vaine. For hee forgate at Salynes to take with him their Pictures and Effigies whereby to finde them out in the Country, with farre the more case and facility, whereof hee afterwards much repented himselfe. As for our two execrable wretches, father Iustinian and Adrian their guilty thoughts and consciences (like so many Ghosts and bloodhounds) so incessantly pursued them and stupified their judgements, that resolving to flye and save themselves from the free Countie, into Switzerland, they hush themselves up the day for shelter in some thicke grove or Wood, and travelling all night from Salynes they notwithstanding, the next morning (to their unspeakeable feare and vexation) saw themselves againe within a little league thereof, and in this manner they for some eight nights following, travelled a foote through unknowne waies and woods, and yet here let the Reader behold and observe the wonderfull Iustice of God towards them, for at the end thereof, they are not as yet fully gone seven leagues off from Salynes , and they could not ascend the least Hill or Hillocke, but they looking backe behind them, the Towers and Turrets of Salynes were still apparent and conspicuous to them, as if they pursued and followed them, the which indeed stroke extreame feare to their guiltie hearts and, and infinite terrour and amazement to their foule and trembling consciences. But this circumstance of Gods wrath and revenge towards them, is forthwith seconded and followed by another, wherein his divine Providence and justice miraculously appeares and shines forth (with infinite lustre and glory) to all those who shall reade, or heare this History. For the tenth evening after their flight from Salynes , they being extreamely wearied and tired with their foote Travells (for horses they dared not buy any) and within a mile off entering into a great wood, they in afaire plaine, seeing no body present, they at last espyed an Erring Horse, without Rider, Saddle, or Bridle: which resolving to seize on thereby to recreate their wearied limbes and bodies they approach and surprize him. And then Adrian knowing him well to be De Lauriers horse, which (we have heard they had formerly turned off in Salynes the same night wherein they murthered his Master. They extreame joyfull of this unlooked for good fortune, make a halter of their girdles and garters, and so casting their cloakes under them, they both ride away on him, and night drawing on, they hope to recover the Towne of Pontarlin before break of day; But God is here strongly bent against them, so that this Horse which they tooke for the cause of their joy, will verie shortly prove the matter of their misery,  & that which they thought would be the matter of their safetie will fall out to produce their inevitable danger and confusion. For God (in his revenging Iustice) carting their horse, and he them a straying and masking that night through contrary waies and Lanes they the next morning at break of day to their unspeakeable griefe, doe see themselves three great leagues off from Pontarlin , when their foule facts and consciences make them still so tremblingly fearefull, that every Bush they beheld, every bird they heare, and everie leafe they found wagging, they thinke are so manie Serjeants come to arrest them, as also every tree they [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) fast, they confidently beleeve are so many Judges come to sentence and condemne them to death for this their cruell murthering of De Laurier , such was their prodigious dispaire, such their ominous and fatall feare for the same. But here their horse (orecharged with this foule and monstrous burthen) beginnes to faile them, so the more hee lesseneth his pace the more it increaseth their apprehension and feare: And here they consult what to doe, whether to retire with their horse into the next Wood till night, or else to advance towards Pontarlin . But their Bread and Meat failing them, and they seeing the coast cleare, they therefore resolve to ride thither, and far the sooner doe they assume and embrace this resolution; because as yet they knew it was timely in the morning, and consequently few or no people stirring. Now to dispatch their journey the sooner, Adrian is content to walke on foote, and father Iustinian to ride, and both of them are equally resolved to put cheerefull faces on their perplexed and trembling hearts. And here as I will not say it was their bad, but their just fortune, which conducted them within lesse than one league of Pontarlin , without being espyed or seene of any. So it was likewise the providence and Iustice of God, at that very houre and place first to bring Du Pont in sight of them, who in two dayes was parted from Salynes , and in all that time had left no Hamlet Village, or Towne unsought to finde out and apprehend these murtherers of his father; Now as hee drawes neere them, his eye tells him that the Horse whereon one of these two men rid was of the very same haire and shape as was that of his fathers, which strucke some suspition and apprehension in his heart, that sure these were father Iustinian and Adrian and farre the more because by his habit hee knew that hee who rid was a Priest. The better therefore to bee fully assured hereof, hee resolves to outride them, thereby the more narrowly to observe both the horse and them, the which hee doth. Hee passeth by them and viewes them with his countenance purposly composed more of neglect than of observation towards them. When perfectly knowing the horse (by his two white feere, and white Starre in his forehead) to bee his Fathers, and therefore they by all consequence and apparance they to bee his murtherers, then I say Nature and Grace infused a secret reluctation into his heart and soule, whether hee should more grieve or rejoyce to see them; Now as hee is loth to leave them behinde him, so hee bethinkes himselfe of a prettie policie. For riding some hundred paces before them, hee descends from his horse, ties him up to the branch of a Tree, casts downe his sword and riding coate in the high way untrusseth his points, and steps within the hedge, as if hee purposly meant to ease himselfe; but indeed it was to have them passe before him, that so hee might incompasse them as two murthering Wolves in a Toyle; At his descent from his horse (as guilty consciences are still afraid of all things) father Iustinian and Adrian first beginne to feare this Stranger, as being sent to apprehend them, and so resolve to trust to their heeles and the woods for their safety, but when they see his sword, and coate in the way, and himselfe within the hedge with his hose downe, then they againe take courage and heart at grace and so proceed on in the way towards the Towne, but still they looke backe on him as if the foulenesse of their fact continually made their feares and dangers the more eminent. This is carefully and curiously observed of Du Pont who (now comes after them a soft trot) contenting himselfe to see them a flight shot before him; as well knowing that his horse was farre nimbler and swifter than theirs, and that therefore he might fetch them up at his pleasure. By this time they two arrive at Pontarlin , which they enter; where (being hungrie and fearefull, and their horse wearie and hungry) they take up one of the next Ins, which is at the sign of the Tygre where thinking themselves free of him who followed them, they recommend their horse to the Ostler, and calling for some Mutton, Bread and Wine, they there privately hush themselves up in their Chamber. But the vigilant eye and care of Du Pont sees where they are entered, so hee puts up his Horse to another Inne close by, and presently with much silence and celerity, trippes away to the Tygre Inne where they are; and knowing them to bee above the staires in their chamber to breakfast, he calles for the Hoast thereof, takes him into a close low roome next the doore; tells him that the Priest and the other man which entred his house right now, had cruelly murthered his father in Salynes , and therefore most courteously and earnestly prayes him, to step presently and fetch the Criminall officers of that Towne to apprehend them for the same, and till his and their returne, that he will give him two of his servants to guard the doors that they escape not away; The Host of this house in detestation of this foule fact of theirs, and to the honour and reputation of himself and his house, speedes away to the Officers who presently arrive with him to whom Du Pont sorrowfully and passionately relate, that this Priest named Iustinian and this Adrian who was an Innekeeper of Salynes and now above, had very lately in his owne house, murthered his father De Laurier , who was a Goldsmith of Dijon , stript aud robbed him of much gold and Jewells, and then buried him in his Orchard, and therefore (with teares in his eyes) conjures them to doe him justice by speedily apprehending them for the same, the which they as soone grant him. So they all ascend to their Chamber where they find them deeply tippling in their cups, asmuch devoid and insensible of danger as of grace. Here Du Pont (with equall passion and sorrow) strongly chargeth them both with the murther of his father De Laurier , as also for robbing of his gold and jewells and for burying of him in the Orchard. But these two bloody factors of Hell, with a world of stout lookes, impious oathes and fearefull asseverations, vow and sweare the contrary. So the Officers take them aside and examine them severally hereon. But they can receive nothing from them but peremptory denialls and prophane execrations. The which Du Pont hearing and understanding hee (with much affection to his father, and discretion to himselfe) to vindicate and know the truth hereof with the more facility and the lesse time; entreats the Officers to search them both narrowly for his fathers gold and Iewells, which by Gods direction they doe, the one after the other, when they finde quilted up in their dublets and hose, store of gold, and some rich jewells and rings, and yet these two bloody villaines deny this murther of theirs with much audacity and impudency, swearing that they found this treasure in a Casket in the high way a little league beyond Salynes . But this lye of theirs is as false, as their murther and robbery of honest old De Laurier was too true, which God (in his mercy and Justice) will briefly bring to light and punishment far sooner than these bloody Miscreants either think, or feare of. Du Pont (all this notwithstanding) constantly assures these Officers, that all this gold and jewells, and much and many more were his Fathers, and therefore are now his both by right and propriety, as being his only Sonne and child and so demands possession thereof. But these Officers mildly deny this request of his, tell him they must take them by an inventory, and so together with the two prisoners to send them to the Iudges of Salynes under whose jurisdiction they affirmed they were. So for that night they commit father Iustinian and Adrian to two severall prisons, where they shall finde leisure [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) though not enough to repent this foule and lamentable fact of theirs. Which was no sooner done, but Du Pont (having thanked these Officers of Pontarlin ) sends away a Poast to Salynes to acquaint the Iudges thereof, of his apprehending of these the two Murtherers of his father, whom hee earnestly besought to hasten their executions; so according to his request at the end of two daies these two Prisoners are sent for, and brought from Pontarlin to Salynes , and there imprisoned. The very next morning the criminall Iudges send for them to one of their houses, and first severally private, and then publikely by confrontation, examine them on this cruell murther and robbery, but the Divell is still so strong with them, that with much courage and vehemency, they continue and stand firme in their negative resolution and deniall; But De Laurier being now found and knowne to have layen some seven weekes sicke in Adrians house, aswel by the confession of Isabella his wife of Graceta her maid and of Thomas their Ostler, as also of the Apothecary La Motte , then his body found buried in his Orchard, and Adrian and father Iustinian their sudden flight upon the same, and now lastly his horse, gold, and jewels found upon them in Pontarlin by the officers of that Towne, and his Sonne Du Pont , were evidences as bright and apparant as the Sunne that (in honour to justice and in glory to God from whom all true justice is derived) these wise and grave Iudges of Salynes , doe reject these denials of Adrian and father Iustinian as false, prophane, and impious, and therefore that very instant adjudge them both to the racke, at the hearing of which sentence they seeme to be nothing apalled and daunted, but they being advertised that Isabella his Wife was likewise imprisoned for this fact, she for her part, by some friends of hers makes sute to the Iudges, that she may be permitted to speake with her Husband, and so doth father Iustinian that hee likewise may speake wirh her. But the Iudges hold both of these their requests to bee vaine and impertinent and therefore flatly contradict and deny them. So Adrian is first brought to the racke, who though hee bee weake of constitution yet hee is still so strong in his villany, as hee will not bee perswaded or drawne to confesse it, but with much courage of body, and animosity of minde, suffers himselfe to bee fastned thereto, whereof the Judges being advertised, they in their discretion, hold it expedient to delay his torments for a time, and so first to make triall of father Iustinian , to see if these his torments will make him lesse stout, and more flexible in the confession thereof. Wherein (I write it with joy) their judgements nothing deceive them, for at the very first wrench of the racke, God is so mercifull to his soule, and so propitious to his new conversion and repentance, that hee then and there confesseth this lamentable murther, in all its branches and circumstances (as wee have formerly understood; Affirmes only himselfe and Adrian to be the Authors and Actors thereof; Sweares that Isabella, Graceta and Thomas were every way innocent thereof, and had no hand or knowledge therein whatsoever. Whereupon the Iudges send againe for Adrian , and cause him anew to bee brought to the racke, but first they hold it fit to confront him with his bloody companion father Iustinian , who boldly affirming, and constantly confirming all his former deposition to him in his face to bee sincere and true. Adrian is amazed and daunted thereat, as also at the sight of the racke which was againe prepared and brought for him, when the devill flying from him, and hee casting his heart and soule at the sacred feet of Gods mercy, hee there very sorrowfully confirmed all father Iustinians confession to be true, and then falling on his knees, hee with many bitter sighes and teares) said againe and againe aloud; that his wife his man, and his maid were as truly innocent, as father Iustinian and himselfe were alone truly guilty of this foole and cruell murther and robbery of De Laurier . When their Iudges, asmuch rejoycing it the detection and confession of these their crimes, as they lamented and detested their perpetrations thereof. They condemne them both to bee hanged the next morning and because father Iustinian had violated his sacred Order, and Adrian the humane and Christian Lawes of Hospitalitie, their bodies after to bee burnt to ashes. So as soone as Father Iustinian was degraded of his Sacerdotall Order, and Habit, and committed to the secular powers, hee together with Adrian were for that night returned to their prison and repentance, where two Priests, and one Fryer of the order of the Iacobyns prepare their soules for Heaven against the next morning. It was a griefe to Isabellas heart, to heare that he was guilty of this foule and lamentable murther, but a farre greater torment and hell to her minde to understand that hee must suffer death for the same, and that she should neither see nor speake with him any more either in this life, or this world. Againe looking from him to her selfe, as shee could not hope for his life, so shee thought shee had some small cause, or at least scruple to doubt and feare her owne, in regard it lay at the courtesie or cruelty of her Husband and father Iustinian , for that (as we have formerly understood) they acquainted her with their intents and desires to murther De Laurier , and shee revealed it not. But yet (neverthelesse) in the purity of her heart, and the candid innocency of her soule, shee commits the successe both of her life, or death to God, did not being able to sleepe away any part of that night for sorrow, shee as a religious woman, and a most vertuous wife) passeth out the whole obscurity thereof, in the brightnesse of heavenly ejaculations and prayer, which from the profundity of her heart, shee proffereth up to Heaven both for her Husband and her selfe. Very early the next morning, before father Iustinian and Adrian went to their execution; Du Pont , and (at his request) the Iudges repaire to the Prison to them; where hee and they enquire of him to what valley of gold and iewells they had taken from his dead father, who tell him, that in a letter which his Father had written to him to Dijon , and the which they had suppressed and burnt; hee therein mentioned the vallew of one thousand seven hundred crownes. And being againe demanded by him, what and where was become of all that great summe in gold and Iewels, they freely and ingeniously tell him, that one third part thereof was taken from them, by him and the Officers of justice in Pontarlin , and another third he should finde hidden in such and such secret places of their houses, and for the other third part, they blushed not to confesse and averre, that they had since paid some old debts bought some new apparell, and spent the rest thereof upon their whores, and other of their voluptuousnesse and prodigalities. So the Iudges and Du Pont speed away to Adrian and father Iustinians houses, where they finde the gold and jewels according to their confessions, the which together with the other former part taken from them at Pontarlin (both which amounted to some 11. or 1200 Crownes) these wise and honest judges deliver up unto Du Pont , who receives it from them with joy and thankefullnesse, but as a good Sonne rejoyceth farre more at the now approaching deserved deaths, of these two bloody and execrable wretches, father Iustinian and Adrian , the murtherers of his good old father De Laurier of whom some twenty and five yeares before, he had the happinesse to receive his life. Some two houres after, which was about tenne of the clocke in the morning these our two condemned malefactors are brought to the place of execution where a great concourse of people of Salynes , and the country thereabouts attend to see them finish the last Scene and Catastrophie of their lives. The first who ascends the Ladder is Adrian , who speakes little; Only he takes it to his death, that his deere wife Isabella , his servant maid Graceta , and his Ostler Thomas , are as absolutely innocent of this murther of De Laurier , as hee himselfe here againe confesseth hee is guilty thereof. Hee prayes God to forgive him this foule fact and beseecheth all that are present to pray to God for him, and for his wretched and miserable soule, the which he knoweth hath great need and want of their prayers, when casting his handkerchiefe over his face, and privately ending some few prayers to himselfe hee is turned over. Instantly after him rather Iustinian mounts the Ladder, who (in his lookes and countenance) seemes to bee very repentant and penitent for this his foule and hainous fact, the which hee praves God to absolve and forgive him, hee here againe cleeres Isabella, Graceta , and Thomas of this murther. Hee much lamenteth that hee hath so highly scandalized the sacred order of Priesthood in his crime and person; and therefore beseecheth all Priests and Churchmen either present or absent to forgive it him; when repeating some Ave Maries , and often making the signe of the crosse, hee was likewise turned over. And thus was the miserable life and death of this impious Priest, and wicked and bloody Host, and in this sharpe manner did God justly revenge himselfe and punish them with shame and confusion for this cruell and lamentable murther. Immediately after which execution of heirs, the Iudges set our vertuous and innocent Isabella , and her maid, and Ostler free from their undeserved indurance and troubles, whereat all the Spectators, doe as much praise God for the liberty of the three last, as they detest the foule crime, and rejoyce at the just punishments of the two first: If we make good use of the knowledge of this sorrowfull history, the profit, and consolation thereof will be ours, and the glory Gods, which God of his best favour and mercy grant us. Amen. GODS REVENGE, AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable sinne of Murther. History XXVIII.  Hippolito murthereth Garcia in the street by night, for the which he is hanged. Dominica and her Chamber-maid Denisa , poysoneth her husband Roderigo; Denisa afterwards strangleth her owne new borne Babe, and throwes it into a Pond, for the which she is hanged; On the ladder she confessed that she was accessary, with her Lady Dominica in the poysoning of her Husband Roderigo ; for the which Dominica is apprehended, and likewise hanged.  difficulty doe wee expell and banish it thence,  & what doth thus promise, or rather threaten unto us, but that it is a wretched signe and testimony that the Devill hath more power with us than God that wee more dearly affect Nature than Grace, and Earth than Heaven. In many sinnes there is some pretence or shadow of pleasure, but in murther there is none except were desire that it should bring griefe and repentance to our hearts, horrour and terrour to our consciences, and misery and confusion to our soules, which indeed despight of our earthly policie and prophane prevention it will infallibly both shew and bring us. But (to shew our wickednesse in in our weakenesse) through the slye subtilty and treachery of Satan, we think wee act and perpetrate it so secretly, that it cannot bee found out of men, nor detected or punished of God. Wherein what sottish fooles, and foolish madmen are we thus to deceive and betray our selves with false hopes and erroneous suggestions, for although men may be deluded and not see it, yet can God bee mocked, or will hee be blinded and deceived herein. O no, his decrees and resolutions are secret and sacred, and though invisible to our eyes, yet our designes and actions are transparent to his. For hee in his all-seeing providence) reserves to himselfe the manner and time, how and where to punish it. As reade wee this approaching History, and it will confirme as much in the lives and deaths of some bloody and inhumane personages, who were borne to honour, and consequently to have lived more happie, and died lesse ignominiously. Isabella King and Queene of Spaine, Anno. 1492\. so famously and fortunately conquered from the Moores ) there (within these few yeares) dwelt an ancient Lady, named Dona Alicia Servantella , who was descended of noble parentage, and by her late Husband, Don Pedro de Cardinas (dying a chiefe Commander in the West Indyes ) shee had two children, a sonne and a daughter, hee named Don Garcia , and shee Dona Dominica , hee of some twenty yeeres of age, and shee of some eighteene, hee tall of stature but somewhat hard favoured and shee short but exceeding faire and beautifull. Their mother Cervantella being not left rich by her deceased Husband, did yet bring up these her two children very honourably and vertuously, and maintained them exceeding gallant in their apparell, though shee clad her selfe the worse for it for their sakes. Shee observes her Sonne Don Garcia to be of a mild disposition, and very wittie and juditious, but for her daughter Dominica , shee sees with feare, and feares with griefe, that her wit will come short of her beauty, and her chastity of her wit; In which regard and consideration shee loves him better than her, and yet beares so vigilant an eie over her actions, that as yet she keepes her within the lists of Modesty, and the boundes of obedience as holding it farre truer discretion to make her more beloved than feared of her, or rather that feare and love by turnes, might act their severall parts upon the Theatre of her youthfull heart, and resolutions. There is an old rich gentleman of that City nobly descended, tearmed Don Hippolito Sevino , commonly knowne and named onely Don Hippolito ; aged of some threescore and tenne yeares and much subject to the Gowt, a disease better knowne than cured, and which loves rich men as much as poore men hate it. And this old Hippolito in the Frost and Winter of his age falls in love with our faire young Lady Dominica , and so by the Lady the Mother seekes her daughter in marriage. As for the Mother shee loves Hippolito's gold better than her daughter doth his age and affects his lands as much as she hates his personage. But Don Garcia at the often requests of his sister being at last vanquished by her importunitie soone changeth his mothers opinion and good esteeme of Hippolito , and so they all three give him the repulse and deniall. But his affection to this delicate fresh young beauty makes him more perverse and obstinate than his age, so he will take no answer for an answer, nor a refusall for a refuse from them but will or nill frequent their company daily, and their house almost hourely they are all three tired with his sottish incivillity, and doting importunacy, especially Dominica , who measuring his age, by her youth, and knowing him to be farre fitter for his grave than a wife, she therefore scornes him as much as he loves her but yet say shee what shee will, or doe her Mother and Brother what they can yet they cannot free their house or shift their hands of him; although they many times make him looke upon bare walles, content himselfe to converse with the meanest of their Servants and so to returne without seeing either of Mother, Sonne, or Daughter. But Dominica , holding her beautie and yeares now to bee worthie of a husband, shee is so incivill and incontinent, as shee prayes her mother to procure and provide her one. For (to use her owne words) shee saith shee is weary to lye alone, and live single, and fully resolved no longer either to trifle away her time, or to cast away her youth and beautie ; Her Lady Mother (in most vertuous tearmes) checks her impudency, blames her impudicity, and concludes that if shee forsake those immodest humours and inclinations, and so serve and feare God religiously then there is no doubt but in good time, hee (of his propitious favour and goodnesse towards her) will provide her one, when turning from her Daughter, the verie teares of sorrow fall aboundantly from her old eyes, to see her thus immodest, thus irregular and wanton, as doubting and fearing that in the end it will prove ominous and fatall to her. But her lascivious Daughter Dominica is not contented with this generall answer of her Mother, for shee is yet so vainly impudent, and so viriously imprudent, as shee importunately prayes her brother Don Garcia , effectually and speedily to solicite her Mother to provide her a husband, whereat hee rather laughes than gives eare. But when againe hee ruminates and considers with himselfe this her foolish levity and wantonnesse, fearing the worst, and to the end shee might not hereafter prove a disgrace to her selfe, a scandall to their house, and a dishonour to their blood, hee (taking time at advantage) breakes and treates with his mother hereon; who concurring in opinion with him, returnes him rather her consent than her deniall, the which hee reports to his immodest sister Dominica , who is thereat as joyfull as before shee was discontented. Not long after it fell out that Dominica with her Mother going on a great Holyday in the morning to the Church of the Benedictine Monkes, and being behinde her on her knees to her Beades and Oraisons, her devotion was so cold and her zeale so frozen towards God, as seeing a very proper young Gentleman (richly apparreled) likewise there on his knees to his prayers not farre from her; shee as a poore (I may say as a prophane) Christian beckons her mothers man to come to her, and whispers him in the eare, that he discreetly goe and enquire what that young Cavallier is, whom she describes to him by his apparell and especially by a rich Diamond Ring which hee weares on his finger; Her mothers man demanding of the Gentlemans servants returnes speedily to his young Lady, and tells her in her eare, that it is Don Roderigo , Sonne and heire to Don Emmanuell de Cortez , whereat her lustfull affection makes her heart leape and dance within her for joy, for so incivilly unchast is shee in her desires and wishes, that at his very first sight shee desires him for her Husband before any other man of the world, yea before any other earthly felicity. Whereupon shee vowes that her Mother shall have no truce, nor her Brother any peace of her before they powerfully make this motion of mariage for her to Don Roderigo , who being often solicited and provoked by her importunate requests, they consult hereon, and both of them approve and desire it, as holding it a match equally honourable to them both. The Sonne will have his mother first to breake the ice of this motion to Don Roderigo , but the mother will have her Sonne first to performe that office to him, and so to take a faire occasion to invite him home to her house to speake with her, the which Don Garcia performes, and deales herein so effectually with Don Roderigo that home hee comes with him. The Lady Cervantella (after many complements and speeches) presents this motion to him. Hee sees the young Lady Dominica her daughter, and finding her to bee exceeding faire and wittie, hee likes and loves her and so takes time to advise hereon with his father, for the Lady his Mother was formerly gone to heaven. Roderigo breakes this motion to Don Emanuell his father, who not pleased therewith seekes to divert his Sonne from it, in regard he knowes that her Mother Dona Cervantella is very poore and of a weake estate, as being much incumbred with the great depts of her deceased Husband. Roderigo alleageth to his Father, his true affection to the true beautie and vertues of Dominica , and that her descent and blood is no way inferiour to his. But his father being of an exceeding covetous disposition, will have wealth to oversway beauty, and not beauty wealth, and so is resolute to heare no more of this motion, whereat his sonne Roderigo bites the lippe, and is much discontented. Yet neverthelesse hee hath cast his affection so deepely and firmely on the fresh and delicate beauty of Dominica , that holding it to bee the Gold of Nature, and shee the Queene and Phoenix of Beauty, hee cannot, hee will not refraine, but very often frequents Dona Cervantella's house, and her daughters company. To whom (notwithstanding his Fathers distast of her) hee yet gives farre more hope than dispaire that hee wil bee her Husband, which ravisheth her with delight, her Mother Dona Cervantella , and her brother Don Garcia with content. But the order of our History envites us for a while to leave Don Roderigo to feast his eyes and surfet his thoughts and contemplations on the Roses and Lillies of his Mistris beauty, and againe to returne to speake of our old Dotard Hippolito . Who now (led by his lust and voluptuous desires, as they are by the instigation of the Devill) comes to performe and act a bloody and deplorable part on the stage of this History. Hee sees with griefe and grieves to see that hee is refused of the Lady Dominica whom hee loves farre deerer and tenderer then his life, and understanding that Don Roderigo de Cortez , doth still frequent her company, hath gained her affection and shall shortly marry her, he thereupon turnes his reason into rage, converts his judgement into revenge, and so resolves to murther him by night, as soone as hee findes him to issue forth of the Lady Cervantella's house, the Devill making him strong in the vanity of this beliefe and confidence, that hee being once dead, undoubtedly the faire Dominica will fall for his share and wife. So hee is resolute in this his bloody and damnable designe: and consults with himselfe whether hee should doe it by himselfe, or by some second instrument, but finding it dangerous to effect it by another, because he must then commit his life to his courtesie, and seeing that his Gout had now forsaken him, hee therefore resolves to doe it by himselfe. But first hee thinkes it not improper, rather pertinent for him to write Roderigo a letter, the which hee doth in these tearmes and sends it him by one of his owne confident Servants.  faire young Lady Dominica , and reciprocally of hers to me, thou wouldst (if not out of honour, yet out of Iudgement) surcease thy suite to her, and not make thy obstinacie ridiculous by thinking to obtaine her to thy Wife, and although shee feede thee with the sugar of many sweet protestations and promises to the contrary yet if I have any eyes in my head, or thou judgement in thine to discerne the truth hereof, thou hast farre more reason to rely upon the integrity of my age, than the Vanity and inconstancy of her youth; And wert thou not a Gentleman whom I love for thine owne and honour for thy Fathers sake. I had not so long permitted thee to frequent her company, nor so often to converse with her to the prejudice of my content and thy discretion, and if this friendly Ambassador of my heart, my Letter, will not yet induce thee to leave her to mee, whom Heauen and Earth, God and her Mother have given mee. I will then either by thy Father, or by the usuall course of Iustice take that order with thee therein, as shall redound as much to my honour and fame, as to thy infamy and disreputation, Hippolito.  Roderigo having received and read this Letter of Hippolito , hee cannot refraine from smiling and laughing to see his sottish errour and ridiculous ignorance herein, for he perfectly knowes, that both Dominica , and the Lady Cervantella her mother are long since resolved to heare no more either of him or of his sute, and therefore hee holds it more worthie of his laughter than of his observation, likewise to see, that this old dotard, when nature is ready to wed him to his grave, that his lust should yet bee so forward to desire to marry so young and beautifull a Lady as Dominica ; The which considering, once hee thought to returne him no other answer but silence, but at last respecting his age and Quality more than his indiscretion or power, after he had shewne his letter to Cervantella , to Dominica , and her brother Don Garcia , who all concur in opinion with him to make it the publike object, as both it and himselfe were the private cause of their generall laughter, hee calles for pen and paper and (rather with contempt than choller) by Hippolito's owne servant returnes him this answer.  Dominica , as to beleeve that hers is reciprocally so to thee and therefore I see no just cause in honour or solid ground in Iudgement to surcease my sute towards her, much lesse to deeme my obstinacy ridiculous in hoping to obtaine her to my Wife; And although it bee in thy pleasure, yet it is not in thy power to make mee doubtfull of her fairewords, or to call in question, or suspition her sweet promises and protestations to mee, sith that were to prophane the purity of my zeale to her, and of her true and sincere affection to mee, the which yet to doe thee a courtesie, I will rather excuse than condemne in thee, because I am confident it exceeds thy knowledge, though not thy feare, and in this behalfe and assurance, thine eyes cannot so much prevaile with my Iudgement, but that I will more rely upon the integrity of her youth, than the vanity of thy Age. As for thy love to mee or honour to my Father, when I finde it so I will acknowledge it to bee as true, as now I conceive i feigned: but for thy threates to mee in thinking thereby to make mee forsake the conversation and company of that faire and vertuous young Lady, I doe rather pitty than esteeme them, and every way more contemne than care for them, assuring thee that I cannot possibly refraine from laughter to see thee so devoid of common sence, as to thinke to bee able, either to scarre mee with the power of the Law, or to daunt me with the prerogative and authority of my father in making mee to forsake her whom in life and death, I neither can nor will forsake, resolve therefore henceforth to prevent thy infamy and disreputation, for I will bee left to my selfe to establish mine owne content and honour, as I please. Roderigo.  Hippolito upon the receit and consideration of this peremptory letter of Don Roderigo , is so inflamed and incensed against him to see that (perforce) he will make him weare a Willow Garland, as (without any more delayes or expostulations) understanding him to bee that very same night which hee received his Letter with his Lady Dominica at her mothers house, the Devill causeth him to gather all his malice, wits and strength together about him that night to murther him as he issueth forth to goe home, which bloody stratagem of his to effect and finish, hee chargeth a pistoll with three bullets and hee waites his comming thence: but Don Garcia accidentally issuing forth all alone privately to goe visit a friend of his not farre off, this wretched old villaine Hippolito taking him to bee Roderigo lets flye at him, and all three bullets pierce his body, so hee falles downe dead to the ground. The blow is heard, and the breathlesse body of Don Garcia is found reeking in his blood, whose mother, sister, and Don Roderigo are amazed and astonished at this deplorable disaster, and ready to drowne themselves in their teares for sorrow thereof. So Roderigo leaving some Neighbours to comfort them, hee takes order to finde out the murtherers, and goes himselfe speedily throughout the street to that effect; When the good pleasure and providence of God directs his course to finde out this old execrable wretch Hippolito going lirping and limping in the street, having throwne away his Pistoll, and only holding his darke lanthorne in his hand, which then (the better to collour out this damnable fact of his) hee opened to light him. Roderigo measuring things past by the present, and finding Hippolito there in the streets all alone, at this undue and unseasonable houre of the night. God prompts his heart with this suspition, that hee in likelyhood was the murtherer of Don Garcia , and so layes hold of him, and causeth him to be committed to the prison, notwithstanding all the entreaties, meanes and friends, which hee could then possibly make to the contrary. The next day all Granado rings and resounds of this murther, and of the suspition and imprisonment of Don Hippolito for the same, when the Lady Cervantella goes to the Criminall Iudges of the City and accuseth him for the same, and with griefe, sorrow, and passion, followes it close against him, and although Hippolito at his first examination denies it, yet being by his cleerefighted Iudges adjudged to the racke for the same, hee at the very first sight thereof confesseth it, for the which bloody and lamentable crime of his, hee is sentenced the next day to be hanged, although hee proffered all his estate and meanes to save his life; But the zeale and integrity of his judges was such to the sacred name of Iustice as they disdained to bee corrupted herewith. So the next Morning this old bloody wretch Hippolito is brought to the common place of execution, where a very great concourse of people repaire from all parts of the Citty to see him take his last farewell of the world, most of them pittying his age, but all condemning the enormity of this his foule and bloody crime. He was dealt with by some Priests and Fryers in prison, whose Charity and Piety, endevoured to fortifie his heart against the feare of death, and to prepare his soule for the life and joyes of that to come. But the Devill was yet so strong with him, that hee could not bee drawne to contrition nor would not bee either perswaded or enforced to repentance, or to aske God, or the world forgivenesse of this his bloody fact, but as hee lived prophanely so hee would dye wretchedly and desperately, for on the Ladder hee made a foolish speech, the which because it savoured more of beastly concupiscence and lust, than of Piety or Religion, I will therefore burie it in oblivion, and silence, and so hee was turned over. Come we now to speake of Don Emanuell de Cortez the Father, who understanding of his Sonne Roderigo his continuall frequenting of Dona Cervantella's house, and her daughter Dominica's company, and now hearing of this murther of her Sonne to her doore, his owne Sonne being then therein present; he is much discontented therewith; and because he will sequester him from her sight and provide him another Wife, hee sends him to Asualos , a mannor house of his, some tenne leagues off in the Country, with a strong injunction and charge, there to reside till his farther order to returne. Roderigo is wonderfull sorrowfull thus to leave the sight of his faire and deere Mistris Dominica , and (to the view of the world) no lesse is shee, so hee transporteth only his body to Asnallos , but his heart he leaves with her in Granado . But a moneth is scarce expired after his departure, But the Lady Cervantella (by the death of her Sonne Don Garcia , wanting a man to conduct and governe her affaires, especially her law sutes, wherewith (as wee have formerly heard) she is much incumbred, shee thereupon (as also at the instant request of her Daughter) writes Roderigo this letter for his returne.  of my Daughter, I request thee speedily to leave Asnallos , and to returne to reside heere in Granado , for I wanting my Sonne Garcia , who was the ioy of my life, and shee her Roderigo who art the life of her joy, thou must not finde it strange if my age, and her youth, and if my Law sutes and her love affections and desires assume this resolution: Thy Father is a Noble man of Reason, and his Sonne shall finde this to bee a request both honourable and reasonable, except thou wilt so farre publish thy weakenesse to the world, that thou doest more feare thy Father than love my Daughter, for if thou shouldest once permit thy obedience to him so farre to give a Law to thy affection to her, thou wilt then make thy selfe as unworthy to bee her Husband, as I desire it with zeale, and shee with passion. Shee is resolved to second this my letter with one of her owne to thee, to which I referre thee; God blesse thy stay, and hasten thy returne. Cervantella.  Dominica resolving to make good her promise to her mother, and that of her mother to Roderigo she withdrawes her selfe to her chamber to write and knowing her mothers messenger ready to depart, chargeth him with the delivery of her letter to her lover Roderigo , and to cast the better lustre and varnish over her affection, she takes a Diamond Ring from her finger, and likewise sends it him for a token of her love.  this of thy absence made mee infinitely miserable, for as that nipt my joyes and hopes in their blossomes, so this kills them in their riper age and maturitie. When I first received thy love, and gave and returned thee mine in exchange, I had well thought thou hadst affected me too dearly so soone to leave my sight, and to banish thy selfe from my company, but now I see with griefe, and feele with sorrow that thou loved thy Father farre bettter than mee, and delightest to preserve his content before mine, for else thou hadst not made me thus wretched by thy absence, who am as (it were) but entering into the happinesse of thy presence. If thou canst finde in thy heart to obey his commands, before thou grant my requests, then come not to Granado but stay still in Asnallos , but if the contrary, then leave Asnallos , and come to mee in Granado , where I will chide thee for thy long stay, and yet give thee a world of thankes and kisses for thy so soone returne, and as my heart and soule doth desire it, so the prosperity of my Mothers affaires doth likewise want, and therefore crave it. Iudge of the fervency of my affection to thee, by thine to my selfe; and then thou wilt speedily resolve to see thy Dominica , who desires nothing so much under Heaven as to have the happinesse of thy sight, and the felicity and Honour of thy Company. Dominica.  Roderigo receives these their two Letters; reputes that of the mother to much respect, and this of her Daughter to infinite affection, so as the very knowledg and consideration thereof makes him rejoyce in the first, and triumph in the second, and therefore knowing himselfe to be a man, and past a child, and that as he is bound by nature and reason to obey his father, so he is not tyed to bee commanded by him beyond it, wherefore he resolves to give content to the mother for the daughters sake, and to the daughter for his own sake and so by their own messenger returnes them these answers; That to the Lady Cervantella spake thus.  content and joy that my resolutions shall so dispose of my selfe towards my Father; as verie shortly I will see thee with respect and observance, and visit her with affection and zeale; for this desire of hers and request of thine, is so honourable so reasonable, as my Father should be guilty of unkindnesse, to deny the one, and my selfe of ingratitude not to grant the other; Or if he will yet continue to crosse our affections I will then make it apparant to the world, that I will not feare him the thousand part so much as I will love her, and that I will ambitiously strive and resolve to make my affection to her; to equalize thy zeale and her passion to mee and that I cannot receive a greater felicity and honour, than to see her my Wife and my selfe her Husband. I have given an answere to her Letter, and very shortly I will give her my selfe every way answerable to her merits, to thy expectation and my promise. Roderigo.  His Letter to Dominica was charged and fraughted with these lines.  absence and likewise to preserve thy ioyes in their blossomes, and thy hopes in their riper age and maturity, I am fully resolved very shortly to grant thy request in leaving Asnallos ; to live and dye with thee in Granado , and thou doest offer a palpable wrong to the truth and an immerited disparagement to the purity and candour of my affection, to thinke that Lady war preferre my obedience to my Father, before my affection to thee, or consequently his content to thine. Therefore prepare thy selfe to kisse not to chide mee, for rise I will resolve to chide and not to kisse thee at my returne. My best endevours shall waite on the prosperity of thy Mothers affaires, and my best love and service shall eternally attend on her Daughters pleasure and Commands, and judge thou if my zeale to thee, doe not exceed thine to my selfe, sith Earth is not so deere to mee, as the Honour of thy sight, nor Heaven as the felicity of thy company. Roderigo.  Hee hath no sooner dispatched these two Letters to his Mistris and her Mother, but the very next day after hee enters into a resolution with himselfe; that hee shall not doe well so soone to disoblige and disobey his father, by so speedily precipitating his returne from Asnallos , to Granado , as urging this reason to his consideration, and proposing this consideration to his judgement, that Dominica's affection and beauty can difficultly make him rich but that his Fathers discontent and displeasure towards him may easily make him poore: Whereupon resolving to cherish his constancy to her, and yet to retaine his obedience to him, hee holds it no sinne if a little longer hee dispence with his content and promise to temporize for his discretion and profit, as grounding his hope upon this confidence, and his confidence upon this presuming infallibility, that his Lady and Mistris Dominica is as chast as faire, and will prove as constant to him as she is beautifull in her selfe. But she is a woman and therefore she may deceive his hopes, and he is a man and therefore it is possible that her beauty may betray his judgement, the which prediction and prophesie (to his griefe and sorrow, and to her shame and misery) wee shall shortly see made true and verified, the manner thus. Dominica (as wee have formerly understood) being of a wanton disposition and carriage, and very unchastly and lasciviously enclined, shee finding Roderigo's stay in Asnallos to exceed his promise and her expectation, shee cannot live chast, shee will not remaine constant in his absence, but hath a friend or two, I meane two proper young Gentlemen of Granado to whom shee many times privately imparteth her amorous favours and affection, the which shee acteth not so closely, but the Lady her Mother being a Lincy-eyed, and curious observer of her actions) hath notice thereof, and thinking to reclaime her from this foule sinne of fornication and whoredome, which threatens no lesse than the ruines of her fortunes, and the shipwracke of her reputation; she first attempteth to perswade her by faire meanes with teares and prayers; but seeing shee could not thereby prevaile with her, then shee gives her many sharpe speeches and bitter threates, and menaces as wholly to deprive her of her Fathers portion, and either to make her spend her daies in a Nunnery, or end them in a Prison. That shee is not worthie to tread upon the face of earth, or looke up to Heaven because this her foule crime of fornication, makes her odious to God, and an infinite shame and scandall to all her Parents and friends in generall, and to every one in particular, with many other reasons looking and conducing that way, the which for brevities sake, I resolve to omit and bury in silence. But this lecture of the Mother prevailes not with the Daughter, but rather inflames than quencheth the fite of her inordinate and lascivious lust; the which shee perceiving, and to prevent her owne scandall in that of her daughters, shee (as a carefull Mother and a wise Matron) meweth her up in her chamber, where Dominica (for meere griefe and choller (to see her selfe thus debard of her pleasures in the restraint of her liberty) shee growes very sicke, lookes exceeding wanne, pale and thinne, and so keepes her bed, the which the Lady Cervantella takes for a fit occasion and opportunity againe effectually to write to Roderigo to hasten his returne to Granado , as doubting least her Daughters Belly should chance to swell and grow big in his absence. This her Letter to Roderigo , reported her minde, and represented her desires to him in these tearmes.  staying so long from Granado , in regard it is contrary to thy promise to my expectation and to her deserts and merits; For her affection is so entire and fervent to thee, because shee conceives and hopes that thine (in requitall) is so to her, that shee hath this many moneths languished in expectation of thy returne, whereof now beginning to dispaire, that dispaire of hers hath strucke her into so dangerous a consumption, that I feare it will shortly prove fatall to her, for already the Lillyes have banished the Roses of her cheekes, yea her cheekes are growne thinne, and those sparkling starres her eyes have lost a great part of their would lustre and glory, so if thy affection will not, yet pitty should move thee to hasten thy returne to see and comfort her; especially sith thou wilt scarce know her when thou seest her in regard I may (almost) justly affirme that shee is no longer Dominica , but rather the living Anotomy of dead Dominica . How thou canst answer for this her sicknesse to thine honour (which is occasioned by thy unkindnesse, I know not, but sure I am if shee goe to her grave before thou come to her, thou canst never sufficiently answer it to thy conscience, nor thy conscience to God. In her sicke bed, thou art the only Saint to whom shee offereth up her devotions, and therefore it will bee a miserable ingratitude in thee to permit her to dye thy Martyr. Cervantella.  At the receit and perusall of this Letter Roderigo is infinitly sorrowfull, especially when hee considereth that it is only Dominicas deere affection to him and his long stay from her, which hath occasioned her sicknesse, whereupon his love consulting with his honour, his honour with his conscience, and his conscience with God, hee conjureth the Messenger to returne speedily to Granado to the Lady Cervantella and her daughter Dominica from him and to assure them that all busines of the world set apart, hee will be there with them the next day, and bring them the answers of their letters himselfe; whereat at the messengers returne they both of them exceedingly rejoyce, Roderigo now (according to his promise) comes to Granado , visiteth Cervantella , and his sicke Mistris Dominica , salutes the one with complements, the other with kisses. Dominica intending to give him her body, but not her heart, dissembleth her affection to him, and frownes on him exceedingly, as if her love to him and his to her were deerer to her than all the world, and farre more pretious than her life. But contrariwise Roderigo intends as hee speakes, and speakes as hee intends; yea hee is so sincere and reall in his affection to her, as shee is counterfeit and treacherous to him. So glorying in her beauty, and triumphing in her youth, hee with much difficulty, obtaines his fathers consent and marries her, their Nuptials being solemnized in Granado with stare and bravery answerable to their descents and qualities, but he will finde a wanton Lois for a constant Lucrete , and a lascivious Phryne for a chast Penelope . Never Husband bore himselfe more respectfully, lovingly, and courteously to his Wife than doth Roderigo to his Dominica , for hee thinkes that her fare cannot bee curious, nor her apparell costly enough for her, yea such was his tender respect to her, and affection of her, that hee willingly permitted her to goe where she would, and to come when shee pleased, contrary to the custome of Spaine , and generally of most Spanyards, who hold it farre more folly than affection to give this licentious freedome and liberty to their Wives, which wee doe in England and France , the which we shall see verified in our young Bride Dominica ; for the more her husband Roderigo loves her, the more she sleights him, and the more he respects her, the more she neglects and contemnes him, wherat he grieves, his mother in law Cervantella stormes, and his owne father Don Emanuell de Cortez repines and murmures: But as it is labour in vaine to thinke to make an  Æthiopian white, so all of them cannot reclaime Dominica to love her husband nor scarce to lie with him. He conceives infinite griefe hereat, which breeds him a lingring consumption in earnest, as his Wife Dominica was formerly possessed of one in jest, whereat shee the more hates him in regard the extreamitie of his sicknesse and weaknesse will not permit him to performe the rites and duties of a Husband towards her, but she need not care, much lesse grieve thereat for shee takes her obscene and lascivious pleasures abroad, whiles her deere sicke husband (for griefe of body and mind) is ready to dye at home. He bewailes his hard fortune in marying her, but yet loves her so tenderly and deerely, as hee will not speake ill of her himselfe, nor suffer any other to doe it either in his presence, or her absence. Yea, her love is so frozen to him, though his bee still constantly and fervently inflamed to her, as shee difficulty sees him once in three daies, nor yet speake two words with him when shee sees him, and yet when hee is so happy to obtaine her sight and company, hee so exceedingly reioyceth thereat, that it seemes to him, his paine for that time gives him peace, his sorrowes truce, his sickenesse ease, his heart comfort, and his thoughts consolation. But Dominica hath not deserved the least part of all this true affection and courtesie from him heretofore, much lesse will shee requite it to him hereafter, except in a most ingratefull and bloody manner, which is thus. The Devill resolves to trouble the harmony and serenity of their mariage, or rather our Dominica hath hellishly derived and drawne this resolution from the Devill, to poyson her Husband, and the sooner she fixeth her minde upon this infernall Ingredient, and setteth her barbarous cruelty upon this devillish drugge, because the violence of his consumption having already made almost an Anatomy of his body, she therefore flattereth her selfe with this opinion, that no suspition at all can seize upon the beleefe of any that hee is poysoned, much lesse of his Father, or her Mother. She cannot procure poyson her selfe, and therefore albeit shee be very unwilling to acquaint or imploy any other herein, yet she is enforced thereunto. Of all her acquaintance she thinkes shee may more safely entrust and repose this great secret with her Chamber maid Denisa , for having formerly made her accessary to her sinnes of Fornication and Adultery, shee thinks shee may with lesse difficulty, and more ease now draw her to conceale and participate in this murther with her; the which the better and sooner to effect, she gives her fifty Duckets, and adding thereunto many sweet perswasions, and sugred promises, of her continuall care and affection for her preferment, this wretched miserable Wench yeelds her consent thereto so they give their hands, and sweare secrecie each to other, the Devill laughing at this their bloudy compact and capitulation. So (without either the grace or feare of God) they are resolute in this their rage, and outragious in this their barbarous cruelty, thinking every minute a moneth, and every day a yeare, before they have finished and perpetrated this lamentable businesse: So this Fury, this shee-devill Dominica , being as impatient in her lascivious lust to her selfe, as in her deadly malice to her kinde and honest Husband Roderigo , she makes Denisa secretly to procure some strong poyson, from some remote unknowne Apothecaty, and not only causeth, but sees her to put it into some white broth for him, which the Chamber-maid brings, and the Wife and Mistresse gives to her Husband, in morning before he was out of his bed, under pretence and colour of some comfortable broth, and hot meat; whereof (O griefe to thinke it! O pity to report it!) before night he died thereof; and Don Emanuel de Cortez his father, being at that time ridden to the Citie of Sevil , in the Province of Andoulesia , about some important businesse of his, she (taking the opportunity and advantage of his absence, thereby the better to overvaile this her foule and bloudy fact) doth speedily cause this his breathlesse body to be encoffined, and so buried somewhat privately, but not in that solemne manner as was requisite either for his quality, or her reputation, yea, contrary to the opinion of the Lady Cervantella her mother, who much grieved and feared at this sudden death of her sonne in law Roderigo , as doubting lest her daughter, his Wife, had too hastily and untimely sent him to Heaven in a bloudy winding sheet. This mournfull Tragedy thus acted, our wretched Dominica , of a discontented Wife, is now become a joyfull and frolike Widdow; and now her exorbitant lust, and lascivious desires, breake pale, and range, both beyond the bounds of chastity, and the limits of discretion, for shee will hearken to no advise, nor follow any counsell from the Lady Cervantella her mother, but forsakes her house and her sight the greatest part of the day, and which is worse, many whole nights, to keepe company with those vitious Gallants, and deboshed young Gentlemen of her former acquaintaince and familiarity, with whom she delighteth to lose her honour, to cast away her chastity, and to shipwracke her reputation, if not her soule; when neither thinking of God or her Conscience of Heaven or Hell, of her murthering selfe, or murthered Husband, she so incessantly (without any intermission or repentance) abandons her selfe to her prophane and beastly whoredomes, that in a very short time shee makes her selfe the laughture of the worst, and the pitie of the better and most vertuous sort of people of Granado , yea, her actions are so devoid of Graces and repleat of impiety, that her owne Mother is ashamed to speake with her, and Don Emanuel De Cortez , her father in law, to see her. And here, Christian Reader, let me request thy curiosity to observe and thy piety to remarke, how (by degrees) the indignation and Justice of God fals upon this deboshed young Lady, for the foulnesse of these her crimes, the very cry and sent whereof hath pierced the windowes of Heaven, and are now ascended to the eares and nostrils of the Lord of Hosts, to draw downe condigne vengeance on her for the same, yea, and at those times when shee least dreames or thinks thereof, and when shee is in the very prime of her prophanenesse, and the chiefest ruffe of her lascivious jollity, and voluptuous sensuality. The manner whereof is thus: Two moneths are scarce expired since she sent this her Husband Roderigo thus untimely and cruelly to his grave, but having as it were drowned her Wits and Senses, her Reason and Iudgement, yea, her Heart and Soule in the Ocean of her beastly lusts, and lustfull desires and pleasures, (but to her owne shame, to the griefe of her mother, and the contempt and anger of her father in Law De Cortez ) she marrieth Don Lewes De Andrada , one of her former Favourites and Paramours, for her lover I cannot, and therefore I will not tearme him; a very proper Gentleman of his Personage, but every way as deboshed and vitious as her selfe, and therefore a fit Husband for such a Wife. That shee was honest, hee know the contrary, but hoping that her wealth should supply his wants, and repaire the ruines of his decayed fortunes, was that which soly induced him to become her Husband. But at last when he saw her wealth to come short of his expectation, and her lustfull desires to exceed it; then he thinks it high time to be wise, in not imitating the example of his predecessour Roderigo , in his carriage and conduction towards this his lascivious Wife Dominica , so hee holds a strict hand over her, and in a manner makes her no better than a Prisoner to her Chamber, and a Scholler to her Booke and Needle, in such sort, that her ranging unchaste thoughts are now bounded in her new Husbands jealousie, and pent and immured up in her owne griefe and discontent; for thus hee reasoneth with himselfe, that although formerly hee made her his Curtisan, yet now hee will not permit that she make him a Cuckold; then he was her friend, now her Husband, and then she was answerable for her owne life and actions to God, but now hee is both for his owne and for hers. But this her present affliction and misery is but the shadow and least part of her future; for Andrada her Husband being as resolute in reforming her, as she was neither to digest or endure it, he the better to curbe her incontinencie, and to debarre her from any more returning to her former lewd pranks, and deboshed life and conversation, he keeps her very short of money, takes from her most of her best apparell, and all her Rings, Chaines, and Iewels, which the Ladies of Spaine (more than any others of the world) hold to be a great part of their earthly felicity. Dominica is amazed, yea all in teares to see this strange alteration of her fortune, and difference of her two Husbands, and now (though too late) shee sees Rodorigo's love, in Andrada's hardnesse towards her; shee speaks to her Mother to reconcile her to her husband, but having shut up this her second match without her knowledge or consent, shee rejects and abandoneth her from her favour to seeke her owne fortune, as holding her unworthy of the blood which Nature, and the education which God and her selfe had given her. She was cruell to her first husband, and therefore no marvell if the second prove unkinde to her, yet hee doubting of her secret malice towards him hee apprehends her revenge as much as hee condemnes her lubricitie. Hee will not adde faith to her dissembling promises, nor hazard beliefe to her treacherous teares and kisses but keepes her still rather as a prisoner than a wife, and more like a criminall than a companion; and yet as close and retired as hee kept her in his house, his vigilancy and jelousie was enforced to meet with this unknowne misfortune that hee was no sooner abroad, but shee had another friend or ruffian at home with whom she very often and very dishonestly familiarized, in so much that shee had infallibly murthered her second husband, as she had formerly done her first, if God out of the inestimable treasure of his mercy and goodnesse) had not prevented her rage, and disappointed and dissipated her bloody designe and revenge by another accident as mournefull as miraculous; and wherein the Iustice and providence of God doth equally resplend and shine forth unto us for our instruction with a most divine power and heavenly influence. For we must here know and understand that the fifty Duckats which Denisa had given her of her Lady Dominica , for consenting to poison her Master Roderigo , gave her new apparell, and they likewise procured her a new sutor or sweet heart, named Hugo (who made shew to marry her, but intented it not) with whom shee wantonized so often, as in a short time shee became guilty of a great Belly, the which she concealed from all the world, except from Hugo the father of her unborne childe, who upon notice thereof, either for feare of present punishment, or of future danger, or that he should bee constrained to marry her, and so to maintaine her and her childe, when he had not meant to maintaine himselfe, he fled from Granado to Marcia without taking his leave of Denisa or any way acquainting her therewith, and now when it is too late, this wretched wench exceedingly grieves thereat, when knowing his returne uncertain, his affection to her doubtfull, her self poore and her Lady & Mistris Dominica , as then not able to maintaine her or her child; shee assumes another bloody resolution, which is, that as shee was formerly accessary to the poysoning of her Master, so shee now will bee a principall Actor in murthering and making away of her owne child, as soone as it shall be borne, and neither conscience nor her feare are able to divert her from this her bloody and damnable purpose. For being provoked thereunto first by her shame, then by her necessity, but chiefly and especially by her fatall Counsellor and instigatour the Devill, shee being delivered (almost a moneth before her time) of a faire young Sonne as soone as it had cried once (to bewaile his owne misery and his inhumane Mothers cruelty) she as an execrable fury of hell, strangles it, giving him his mournefull and untimely death, in that very same houre and instant, which God and her selfe gave it life, and the very same evening, wrappes it in a cleane white linnin cloth, and with a Packthred tyes a great stone thereunto and (the devill giving her strength, the very same night caries it halfe a mile off to a pond without the east gate of the Citty, where seeing no body present to see her, shee (not as a mother, no not as a woman, but rather as a fury of hell there throwes it in, which before her departure thence presently sunck to the bottome. And here let us behold and contemplate on the wonderfull mercy and Iudgment of God in so speedily revealing this deplorable and cruell murther of this harmelesse and innocent little new borne babe, whom being so newly brought from the adulterate wombe of his pittilesse mother, she malitiously cast into that Pond, giving it death for life, the Pond for its Cradle, a banck of mud and Oze for its bed and pillow. For upon the instant of Denisus delivery and her murthering and throwing of this her infant babe into the Pond; God (to revenge this foule and bloody fact of hers) deprived her of discretion and judgement to returne for that night to her Masters house, for shee thinking to make sure and sound work for her owne reputation and safety shee that very night takes up her lodging in the next poore Inne, which was at the signe of Saint Iobus head, where to the Host and Hostesse, shee pretends lamenesse by the receit of a fall. But God will give her but small time to rest and repose her selfe in the guiltinesse of this her cruell sinne of murthering her own innocent new borne babe, for with in one houre after, a Groome riding to water his horse in the same pond, his Horse snufleth and starts exceedingly, pawing in the water with his farther fore foote, and many times thrusts downe his head therein. The Groome gives him the spurre and switch to bring him off, but in vaine, for the horse the more paweth with his foote, and snufleth with his nose, yea so long till at last (it seemes) the packthred being broken the white cloth appeares and flotes upon the water, which the groome upon the strange behaviour of his horse (but indeed by the immediate providence and pleasure of God, who then and there was well pleased to make this reasonlesse Beast an instrument of his glory in the detection of this cruell murther) causeth to bee fetched a shore, where opening the cloth in presence of some others, who flocke thither to the pond side to see what this may be. They find a sweet young Infant boy, whose body was as white as the snow, with a flaxen coloured haire, a cheerefull looke, a cherrie lip, and some blacknesse about his throate and necke, wherby they guessed it to be newly borne and strangled of some Strumpet his mother, whom to detect and finde out, they search all the adjacent houses, and at last finde out Denisa in her Inne, when the Officers of Iustice, setting a Midwife and some three or foure elderly women to search her, they (dispight of her resistance or prayers to the contrary) give in evidence against her that shee was that day delivered of a child, so shee is imprisoned, and the next day brought to her arraignement, where (threatned with the racke) shee confesseth the strangling of her child and the throwing of it into this pond, for the which soule and inhumane fact of hers, shee is the next day condemned to bee hanged: When desirous to save her soule though through the instigation of Satan) she hath miserably cast away her body; she entreateth that father Enstace a Priest of her acquaintance may be sent to her in Prison, to prepare her soule for her spiritual journy to heaven, who is accordingly sent her. Who after a long and a religious exhortation to her, falling on this point, that she should do well to disburthen her conscience of any other capitall crime which she in all the whole course of her life might have committed, as affirming that the revealing thereof, exceedingly tended to Gods glory, and the felicity of her owne soule, she (with teares and sighes) deepely thinkes thereof that night in prison. Now the next morning shee is brought to the place of execution, where a great number of people flocke together to see her end, and there on the Ladder after shee had againe confessed the strangling of her infant and her throwing of it into the Pond, shee likewise then and there confessed, That she was accessary and consented with her Lady Dominica to poyson her Master Roderigo , which shee affirmed they both effected in the same manner as wee have formerly understood. The confession of this her other foule murther, as also of her Lady Dominica , doth much amaze her Auditors and astonish her Judges, who to cleere and vindicate the truth hereof, they cause her to descend the Ladder, and to be confronted with her said Lady Dominica who by this time in the middest of her security is likewise apprehended and brought before the Criminall Judges, where contrary to her expectation being enforced to understand the effect and tenour of her Chamber maid Denisa's confession and accusation against her for the poysoning of her Husband Roderigo , shee with much passion and choller tearmes her witch and devill, and curseth the houre that ever shee fostered up so pestilent a Viper in her house to eate out her own heart and life when with more confidence and boldnes than contrition and repentance (being first by her judges threatned with the torments of the racke) she confesseth her selfe likewise to be guilty of murthering her first Husband Roderigo . So Denisa's sentence is altered, for shee is condemned to be hanged for her first murther, and her dead body after to be burnt to ashes for her second, and the Lady Dominica to bee hanged for poysoning her husband which newes so resounds and rattles through all the streets and corners of Granado , that almost all the people of that Citie flocke the next morning to the place of execution, to see this cruell Mistresse and her bloudy Chamber-maid, take their last farewell of this world; for the Lady Dominica must likewise die, notwithstanding her Mother Cervantelio's teares, and her Husband Andrada's importunate requests and passionate praiers to her Judges to the contrary. And first Denisa is caused to ascend the Ladder, (who was a tall and comely young woman) to whom God was so mercifull to her soule, that there with many bitter sighs and teares, she was wonderfull sorrowfull for these her two foule murthers, especially for that of her poore Infant babe, whom she had almost as so one dispatched out, as she brought into the world: She earnestly besought all her auditors and spectators to pray unto God to forgive her, and to bee mercifull to her soule; shee affirmed that her Lady Dominica's enticements and Gold first drew her to be accessary to the poysoning of her Master Roderigo , the which againe and againe from her heart and soule, shee prayed God to pardon her; when entreating all young people, especially all young women, to be more wise and religious, and lesse prophane and bloudy minded, by her example; and now recommending her soule into the hands of her Saviour and Redeemer, she is turned over. When immediately after this our wretched Lady Dominica is likewise brought to her execution, whom the vanity of her heart, and the impurity and prophanenesse of her soule, had purposely dighted in her best dresse, and richest apparell; which was a purple wrought Velvet Gowne, and a curious great laced Ruffe, with all things else sutable to it; but which is lamentable to see, and fearefull to consider, she was as carelesse of her soule, as curious of her body; for the Priests and Friers in her prison could not abate or beat down her impiety, but as there, so here on the Ladder, she enters into many deepe execrations and curses, as well against her second Husband Andrada , as against her Chamber-maid Denisa , who she said was now rather gone to the Devill than to God; but no spark of grace, no shew of sorrow, or signe of repentance could appeare in her looks, or bee heard in her speeches, for poysoning of her first Husband Roderigo , but with much choller and vehemencie, shee there uttered many other lewd and lascivious speeches, the which grieved her Christian Auditours to heare, and therefore I will not defile my pen, or offend the Readers religious and chast hearts with the knowledg thereof; so this miserable and wretched Lady was turned over the Ladder, who made her death answerable to the foulnesse and enormity of her life, being not so happy in her death as her bloudy Chamber-maid Denisa , and I feare me as exempt of grace and goodnesse as the Devill could wish her. But God is the Lord of Justice, and father of mercy, to whom I leave her. The youth and beauty of this cruell and inhumane Lady Dominica , was pitied of many, but her foule fact abhorred and detested of all who were present at her death, may we who reade her History, cherish our Vertues by the fight and knowledge of her Vices, and fortifie our soules with Religion and Piety, as she ruined hers by the neglect and want thereof. Amen . GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable Sinne of Murther. History XXIX.  Sanctifiore (upon promise of mariage) gets Ursina with child, and then afterwards very ingratefully and treacherously rejecteth her, and marieth Bertranna. Ursina being sensible of this her disgrace, disguiseth her selfe in a Fryers habit, and with a case of Pistolls kills Sanctifiore as he is walking in the fields, for the which shee is hanged.  and revenge, to imbrue our hands in the innocent blood of our neere kindred, sith in seeking to wound him, wee more properly kill our selves in soule and body; striking him (who is the figurative image of God) wee presumptuously stab at the Majesty of God himselfe, by whom our soules must, without whom they can never bee saved. Therefore if wee will not know as wee are men, yet wee ought firmly both to know and beleeve as wee are Christians, that revenge and murther are the two prodigious twins of Sathan , the last being engendered and propagated of the first, and both from Hell: For revenge is not halfe so sweet in the beginning as bitter in the end, nor murther by many degrees so pleasing as it proves pernitious to her Authors, as this ensuing History will verifie, and make apparant unto us. and Appenins, to the noble and famous citie of Naples, the head and capitall of that flourishing kingdome (and from whence it receives and derives its denomination) a city exceeding rich, populous and faire, and graced and adorned with more Nobilitie and Gentrie of both sexes than any other of Italy whatsoever. Wherein of very late yeares (when the Duke of Ossuna was Viceroy thereof) there dwelt two rich and beautifull young gentlewomen, the one named Dona Vrsina Placedo , the onely daughter and child of Seignior Agustino Placedo ,  & the other Dona Bertranna de Tores likewise the only child and daughter of Seignior Thomaso de Tores , the first native of Ferenzolo , in Pulia , and the second of Materana in Calabria , both of them being exceeding rich and well descended Gentlemen, who with their wives and daughters for the most part built up their residence in Naples , but especially all the winter time. Now because these two young gentlewomen (whom henceforth wee will tearme by their Christian and not by their Surnames) are two of the chiefest personages, which give life to this History, therefore I hold it not impertinent for mee, superficially to give the Reader their different caracters and delineations; Vrsina was past the twentieth yeare of her age, and Bertranna entring into her eighteenth, Vrsina was tall and slender, Bertranna short and somewhat crook-backed: Vrsina was the fairer of the two, but Bertranna by far the subtiller and wiser. Vrsina was of a deepe Amber hayre, but Bertranna of a coale blacke:  & to conclude this point, Vrsina was affable and courteous, but Bertranna coy, proud, and malitious. The truth and order of this History must here informe us, that although these two rich young Gentlewomen had divers brave Gallants, who were sutors to them for marriage, yet none of them so dearely and passionatly loved Vrsina , as the Baron of Sanctifiore of Capua , a verie rich young Nobleman; but far more proper than wise, and withall far more lascivious than rich, nor did or could Bertranna in her heart and mind affect any other but the said Baron: neither was it possible for her father De Tores to perswade or draw her to desire any other Nobleman or Gentleman for her husband than him. Thus wee see Sanctifiore deeply to love Vrsina , and Bertranna him, but not hee her; and wee shall not goe far till we likewise see what effects these their different affections will produce. Whiles Vrsina is assured of Sanctifiores love to her, Bertranna contrariwise by her selfe and her friends makes it her chiefest care and ambition to perswade and draw him to forsake Vrsina , and to love and marry herselfe, but shee will find more opposition and difficulty therein than shee expects. True it is, that although the Baron of Sanctifiore doe continually frequent Placedos house, and his daughter Bertrannas company, yet understanding and considering with himselfe, that Vrsina honoured him with her constant love and affection, hee therefore held himselfe in a manner bound sometimes to see and visit her, although indeed it was every way more to content and please her, than himselfe, where albeit that her policy to her selfe, and her affection to him, gives him many quips and jerkes of his Mistris Vrsina , yet his reputation and discretion makes him comport his actions and speeches so equally towards Bertranna , that although hee give her little cause to hope, yet he gives her none to despaier of his love and affection to her, in requitall of hers to him, and upon these and no other tearmes stand Sanctifiore and Bertranna . But as for Vrsina , her hopes and heart of Sanctifiores affection to her, sayls on with a more pleasing and joyfull gale of wind, for shee loving him as deeply as hee doth her dearly, she accounts her selfe his, and he hers: as we may the more particularly and perfectly perceive by foure love-letters of theirs, which secretly and interchangeably past betweene them; the which for the Readers better satisfaction I thought good here to insert and publish, whereof his first to her spake thus.  fully taken up my thoughts, and so firmely surprised and vanquished my heart, that I am so much thine hoth by conquest and duty, as I know not whether I doe more affect or honour, or more admire or adore thee; Wherefore if thou art as courteous as faire, and as loving to me as I am faithfull to thy selfe, then returne mee thy heart as I now give and send thee mine, and assure thy selfe that my affection is so infinite and entire to thee, that I love and desire thee a thousand times more than mine owne life, and will esteeme my death both sweet and happy, if thou wilt henceforth live mine by Purchase, as I am now thine by Promise. Thy will shall be my law, and as there is a God in Heaven, so Vrsina hath not so fervent a lover, or constant a servant on earth as her Sanctifiore.  Vrsinas answer hereunto was couched in these tearmes.  mee, I should then have as just cause thankfully to beleeve that, as now I have to suspect and feare this; For the iniquity of our times, and the misery of many former examples doe prompt and tell mee, that most men love more with their tongues, than with their hearts, and that they all know far better how to professe than preserve their affections and fidelities to their Mistresses. As for mee, judge with thy selfe how courteous and loving I am to thee, for if I perfectly knew that thy Letter were the true Ambassadour, and unfeigned Eccho of thy heart, I would both say and promise thee, that I would love thee, and done but thee: Make my selfe thy wife, when and as soone as thou wilt please to bee my Husband, for in life and death I here now promise thee to bee more thine than mine owne: Resolve mee of this doubt, and free mee of this feare, and then manage this affection and favour of mine with discretion, and requite it with fidelitie to thy. Vrsina.  The Baron of Sanctifiores second letter to her contayned this language.  infidelity, but doe as justly detest and scorne, as you unjustly feare them in mee. That my affection is pure and sacred, and shall bee inviolable to thee, bee God my Iudge, and my heart and conscience my witnesses: Therefore to resolve thy doubt, and to free thy feare thereof, I vow by the purenesse of thy beauty, and by the dignity of thy vertues, that both my former letter and also this, are the true Ambassadours and Ecchoes of my heart, and which is more, of my soule. I will shortly kisse thee for thy love to mee, then love thee for thy kisses, and after embrace and thanke thee for both, and when I faile of my affection and fidelity to thee, may God then faile of his Grace and mercy to my selfe. I will make my selfe thy deere Husband, and thee my sweet wife, when thou pleasest to crowne and honour mee with that sweet joy, and to ravish my heart with this desired felicity. Sanctifiore.  Vrsinas answer hereunto was traced in these tearmes.  performance of thy constancy to mee, for the which thou hast invoked God for Iudge, and thy heart and Conscience as witnesses thereof, I now freely acknowledge my selfe to bee thy wife by Purchase, and thou to bee my Husband by Promise, and doe therefore wholly take me from my selfe, eternally to give my selfe to thee. I desire the enjoyance of thy company and presence, with as much impatiency as thou longest for mine, and thou shalt find, that I will make it my chiefest care and ambition to love thee, and my greatest glory to honour and obey thee, and let both of us beware of infidelity each to other, for God will assuredly punish it with justice, requite it with revenge, and revenge it with misery on the Delinquent and Offenders. Vrsina.  By the perusall and consideration of these foure precedent Letters, wee may plainly perceive, what a firme promise, and secret contract there was past betweene the Baron of Sanctifiore and the Lady Vrsina , and how fervently and sweetly they had given themselves each to other in the promise and assurance of mariage, so not contented to have gotten the Daughters good will, hee in very honourable fashion and tearmes likewise seekes her Father Seignior Placedos consent thereto; whom though for some few Monethes hee found to bee averse and opposit to his desires therein, yet upon Sanctifiores importunate intreaties and his Daughter Vrsinas frequent teares, hee at last consenteth to this their mariage, only he delayed the consummation thereof for some secret reasons, and considerations best knowne to himselfe, the which I cannot publish, because I could never gather or understand them. Whiles thus the Baron of Sanctifiore remaines in Naples , his long stay, great trayne, prodigall expenses there, and his absence from Capua where his lands and meanes lay, made him bee in some distresse and want of mony, and not knowing how to procure it there, thereby to support his fame and reputation with his pretended Father in law, and also with his intended wife his Daughter, it greatly perplexed and troubled him; But at last hee saw himselfe reduced to this extremity, that hee was enforced to borrow of one Nobleman and Gentleman of his Friends to pay another; a Course which hee well saw could not long endure and subsist, without clamorously calling his reputation in question; The which to prevent, knowing Seignior Placedo to bee a hide bound, and close fisted old Gentleman, who loved his gold far better than his God, and that if hee offered to borrow any of him, hee would absolutely refuse and deny to lend it him, and that it was not impossible, but rather very probable, that hereby the prodigality of the one, and the covetousnes of the other might prove a great blot and hinderance to this his marriage, hee therefore as a deboshed and vicious young Nobleman, despayring of the fathers love, resolves to make sure worke with the daughters affection, who with a thousand amorous speeches, and lascivious lures, daliances and temptations, he seekes to draw her to his lustfull desires, and so by usurping on her chastity (which is the honour of Ladyes,  & the glory of Gentlewomen) to have carnall knowledge of her before he were married to her. Vrsina (who loved her sweet heart Sanctifiore farre dearer than the whole world, and yet her honour and chastity a thousand times more deare and pretious than her owne life) infinitly grieves and wonders at this his intemperancy and obscenitie; when (as a chaste and vertuous Gentlewoman) shee with sighes and teares layes before his eyes and consideration, and represents to his heart and soule, the lewdnesse of his desire, the impiety of his request, the foulnes and odiousnes of this fact both to God and man, the losse of her reputation and honour, both with her father and with all the world, and that in the end it would assuredly prove the breake-necke of their mariage, and consequently the ruine of both their contents and fortunes, as also that she is ready to be his wife, but disdaineth to prove his strumpet, with many other wise and godly reasons tending that way, and therefore utterly refuseth to blemish or shipwracke her chastity, by participating with him in the share of this lascivious and impious sinne of fornication; and indeed it had been a happines and glory, very worthy both of her selfe, and of her honourable old Father, if she had lived in the purity, and continued in the piety of this chaste and vertuous resolution. But this lascivious Baron Sanctifiore seeing his lust so strongly opposed by her chastity, hee is so far from grace and from God, as hee redoubleth his violence and impetuositie thereof, as also of his lures and prayers, of his art and policy, to inrich himselfe with her losse of that inestimable and irrecoverable Jewell her Virginity; so that day and night she cannot be in quiet for him, nor hee without her; but still he followes her as her ghost and shadow, and with many false oathes and feigned sighes and teares doth bewitch or rather minstralize into her eares and heart, that his desire of this sweet pleasure which hee requesteth from her, proceeds wholly from his tender affection to her,  & so with a thousand lascivious words hee makes so large and so impious an Apology to her for this his obscene request, that because modesty cannot, discretion will not permit mee to relate it; as well knowing that the expression and publishing thereof, will every way prove unprofitable to the Reader, & no way pleasing but displeasing to God, when this weake and inconsiderate Gentlewoman, loving him fat dearer than her owne life, and confidently relying on his sworne affection and fidelity to her, which hee so passionatly, and so often had reiterated to her, shee so rashly and foolishly permitted her selfe to be weighed downe, overcome and vanquished with the importunacy of his requests and oathes, that it was neither in her power or will to deny him any thing, no not her selfe, but as she formerly had given him the full command of her heart, now she likewise gives him the free use and possession of her body. Thus Sanctifiore bereaves and unparadiseth his Mistris Vrsina of the most pretious Jewell which ever Lady Nature gave her, I meane her chastity and honour, but both of them shall shortly pay deare for these their bitter sweet pleasures (or rather sinnes) of sensuality and fornication; and shall redeeme and ransome them with no lesse than shame and repentance: The manner whereof is thus. After hee had thus deflowred, and taken his obscene pleasure of his young and beautifull Mistris, and stayed an houre or two complementing with her, he then takes his leave of her, when triumphing more in the conquest of her shame, and his folly, than in his owne repentance for occasioning the one and committing the other, hee within a weeke or two after againe makes her so flexible and tractable to his desires, as hee three or foure times more familiarly wantonizeth with her in this lascivious manner, and she with him, as not contented to staine and blemish, but wholly to defile and pollute themselves in this their beastly sin of concupiscence and fornication. But here now begins his infamie, and her griefe and misery: For (as a base Nobleman) hee forgetting his oathes and promises to her, and her extraordinary love and affection to him, and which is more, his honour, and himselfe, and his soule, and his God, hee (by degrees) now begins to freez in his affection to her, visiteth her seldome, and then but faintly and coldly, and when (with equall blushes and teares) shee motioneth him to marry her, hee is either deafe to her requests, or else answereth her so impertinently and ambiguously, as (with much perturbation of mind and affliction of heart) shee begins to suspect and doubt with her selfe, that she hath more reason to feare, than cause to hope of his future affection and fidelity towards her. Neither is her feare vaine, or her judgement and apprehension deceived of him herein: for as men love nosegayes in the morne, and throw them away ere night, so this ignoble Nobleman Sanctifiore after hee had surfetted and satiated his desire of this his intended and contracted wife Vrsina , hee in lesse than three moneths after, is so ingratefull and treacherous towards her, as in a manner hee abandoneth her fathers house, and forsakes her sight and companie, leaving her nothing to comfort her, but her sighes, teares, and repentance, and which is worse, a growing great belly, as the true seale of her present griefe and sorrow, and the undoubted pledge and presager of her future shame and misery, which torments and terrifies her heart and soule, but how to remedie it she knowes not. And now (with as much speed as vanity and infidelity) away goes Sanctifiore to his other second sweet heart Bertranna , who not for her beautie, but for her fathers great wealth, and his owne pressing wants, hee now seemes to affect and court a thousand times more familiarly and tenderly than before, whereof shee is infinitly glad  & joyfull. For having a long time loved him in her heart and mind, and therefore desiring nothing so much under heaven, as to see him her Husband here on earth, and having to that end her secret eyes and spies every where abroad upon his life and actions, she is at last advertised, that there is some great distaste and difference fallen out betweene him and the Lady Vrsina , as also that being farre from his home, hee wanteth monyes to defray his Port and expences in Naples ; shee being of a sharp wit, and deepe judgement, thinkes that the last of his defects was the cause of the first, and that peradventure Sanctifiore having attempted to borrow some money of her father Seignior Placedo , and received the repulse, hee therefore was fallen out, and become displeased and discontented with his daughter: And although her conceit and judgement missed of the truth herein, yet the better to estrange Sanctifiore from Vrsina , and consequently the more powerfully and strongly to unite and tye him to her selfe, shee well knowing that her owne father De Tores exceedingly loved him, and desired him for his sonne in law, as much as shee did for her Husband: shee therefore as much in love to him, as in disdaine and malice to Vrsina , doth under hand deale so politickly, and yet so secretly with her Father to lend Sanctifiore some monyes, that hee meeting him the very next day in his house, hee takes him aside in his study and told him, that in regard of his absence from Capua , and his long stay and great expences here in Naples , it was rather likely than impossible that hee might want some monyes, and therefore hee freely lent, and then and there laid him downe 500 double pistolls: adding withall, that if hee needed more, hee should have what hee pleased, and repay it him againe when hee pleased, and that if hee would honour him so much as to marry his daughter, hee would give him all the lands and wealth hee had. This great courtesie of De Tores to the Baron of Sanctifiore hee held was redoubled to him in the value, in that hee lent it to him so freely and undemanded, as also for that it came so opportunely and fitly to pay his debts, and satisfie his wants, as after a long and respective complement betweene them. Sanctifiores necessitie so easily prevailes with his modesty, that hee most thankfully takes this gold of De Tores , and likewise gives him more hope than despaire to his motion of marrying his daughter the Lady Bertranna ; wherewith the one rests well satisfied, and the other exceeding well contented. This point of courtesie being thus performed betweene them, Sanctifiores joy thereof was so great, I may say so boundlesse, as he presently finds out his new Mistris Bertranna ; and with a frolick countenance and cheerfull voice, relates her, how much her father had obliged him, and from point to point what had past betweene them, and immediately after no lesse doth her father, the musick of which newes was so pleasing to her mind, and so sweet to her heart and thoughts, that she hereupon flatters her selfe with a confident hope that hee will shortly marry her, and in this hope doth hee still feed and entertaine her, being seldome or never from her, but ever and anon both together billing and kissing, drowning his judgement so wholly in her company, and his heart ranging and dreaming so fully on her youth and beauty, and on her fathers great wealth and estate, that hee hath not the grace, no nor which is lesse, the will or good nature, once to thinke of his poore desolate and forsaken Vrsina , of whom in her turne I come now to speake. Wee have formerly understood with sorrow, and our sorrowfull and unfortunate Vrsina hath to her griefe too too soone seene, how unkindly Sanctifiore hath used, and how basely and treacherously abused her in the points of her honour, and his infidelity; and yet all this notwithstanding, her love and affection is still so deare and constant to him, and her hopes so confident of him, that all this discourtesie of his to her, is only but to try her patience, and that considering what familiarity hath past betweene them, it is impossible for him to bee so cruell hearted towards her, as in the end not to marry her. She hath likewise acquainted him, that she is with child by him, and when all other reasons and persuasions faile, shee hopes this will prevaile to reclaime his affection to her, and to induce him to take pitty of her, and compassion of his unborne babe within her. But to resell and dissipate all these her flattering and deceitfull hopes, and which is worse to make her lose all hopes of this her desired happines and good fortune from him, his new contracted and incessant familiarity betweene him and the Lady Bertranna , is not so privatly carried and hushed up in silence betweene them, but shee hath secret and sorrowfull notice thereof; which so inflames her mind with hot jelousie, and likewise afflicts her heart with cold feare and apprehension, that shee hath seduced and drawen his affection from her to himselfe, as also that hee will utterly forsake her to marry Bertranna , that shee fully beleeves that the wind of his discourteous absence from her proceedes from this point of the compasse. Wherefore fearing that which shee already knowes, but far more that which shee knowes not of this their familiarity betweene them, all her hopes of Sanctifiore are almost vanished and banished, and her heart is as it were wholly depressed and weighed downe with bitter griefe and sorrow thereof. She dares acquaint no body with her disgrace, much lesse her Father, and her looking on her great belly doth but infinitely augment her sorrowes and increase her afflictions, in regard that that which should have beene the cause of her joy and glory, shee now knowes will shortly prove the argument of her shame and misery. A thousand times a day, yea I may truly say as many times an houre, shee wisheth shee had beene more chaste and lesse faire, and not so easily to have hearkned to Sanctifiores sugred oathes and temptations, as to have lost her honour and fortunes in seeking to preserve them in her affection to him, shee would faine draw comfort from all these her calamities, or from any one of them, and yet shee knowes not from whom except from her Sanctifiore , when presently shee checks her folly and reproves her ambition for tearming him hers, when shee beleeves she hath far more cause to feare than reason to doubt, that hee already is, or shortly will bee Bertrannas husband. And yet againe, because the excesse of her sorrowes hath more eclipsed her joyes than her judgement, and more dulled and obscured her heart than her understanding, therefore judging it a master peece of her policy if shee can sequester and reclaime her Sanctifiore from Bertranna , and so retaine him to her selfe in marriage, shee to that end, that very morning sends for Sebastiano her fathers coachman (whom shee knew to be faithfull to her) and taking off a rich Diamond ring from her finger which Sanctifiore well knew, she bade him find out the Baron of Sanctifiore at his lodging, or elsewhere, to deliver that ring as a token of her love to him, and to tell him that shee infinitly desires him to honour her with his presence at her Fathers house sometimes the forenoone. Sebastiano accordingly findes out the Baron, and delivers him his young mistris ring and message, by whom hee returnes this answer; Commend me to the Lady Vrsina , and tell her I will be with her immediatly after dinner. Whiles thus our sorrowfull Vrsina (betwixt hope and feare, griefe and consolation) prepares to receive him, hee arrives to her in his owne coach, and her Fathers servants attending for him, doe conduct him up to her chamber, where composing her countenance to affection, and yet to sorrow, shee meets him at the doore, and conducts him to the window which answereth and lookes into the garden, where hee giving her onely one slight kisse, and shee absenting her Fathers servants, shee bursts forth into teares and sighes. Shee complaines of the coldnesse of his affection, of his long absence from her, of the violation of his oathes and vowes to her, and of her great belly by him, which shee tells him hee may better see than shee conceale, but especially of his deepe promise to marry her, praying him to set downe the time and place when hee will performe and consummate it, and that it would infallibly prove his shame and infamy, if hee forgat himselfe, his honour and conscience, to forsake her, and marry the Lady Bertranna , whom shee affirmes to him with teares, that shee understands is the mistris of his thoughts and heart, and the Queene Regent of his desires and affections. When this base Baron is so cruell hearted to her, as (preferring his fury to his affection, and his passion to his compassion) hee replyes not a word to all the former parts and branches of her speeches and complaints, but only to the two last hee gives her this thundering and heart-killing answer: Know Vrsina that I have used all lawfull and possible meanes with my parents to draw their consents that I might marry thee, but it is out of my power ever to obtaine it of them, and without it I will never marry: as for Bertranna , shee is not so much thy inferiour in beauty, as shee is thy superiour in vertues, therefore provide thou for thy fortunes, and so will I for mine, when with a looke (which savored no way of love, but wholly of contempt and indignation) hee hastily throwes her her Diamond ring, and without once kissing her or bidding her farewell, suddenly rusheth forth her chamber, where in hee leaves her to her selfe and her muses, and so takes coach and away, vowing to himselfe as hee went forth the dootes, that hee will not bee Father to a bastard, nor Husband to a whore. Here let all vertuous Ladies and Gentlewomen, and all true hearted and generous Noblemen and Gentlemen judge, if this Sanctifiore did not shew himselfe a most base Nobleman and a cruell hearted tyrant towards this sweet and unfortunate Gentlewoman sith the consideration of her youth and beauty in her selfe, of her tender love and affection to him, of his oathes and promises to bee her husband, of the losse of her honour and fortunes, yea sith the sight of her leane and thin cheekes wherein the roses and lillies of her former beauty were withered with her sorrowes and his infidelities, and the sight and consideration of her great belly which hee had given her, together with her birth, and quality, and the infinitnesse of her sighes, prayers, sobs, and teares could draw no more reason or compassion from him towards her. And now it is, that at the sight and consideration of this his barbarous cruelty towards her; her very heart and soule is wounded and pierced thorow with sorrow, and now it is that she looks backe on her former folly & errour, on her present affliction and griefe, & on her future shame & miserie, and now it is that deeming him lost to her for ever, and her selfe consequently ruined without him; that her sorrowes and miseries are so great, so infinite, that shee is ready to drowne her selfe in her teares, and most willingly desirous to forsake this life and this world to flie up to heaven and to God upon the wings of her sighes, and prayers. But ahlas poore soule, thou art too unfortunate to be yet so happie, because these thy afflictions and sorrowes doe as it were but now begin; therefore thou must prepare and arme thy selfe to suffer them with patience and to end them in lesse passion, and more repentance and piety. Although this ignoble Baron triumph in this his cruelty towards his former love Vrsina , and so speedily poast away and acquaint his new one Bertranna therewith, who as much rejoyceth, as the other bitterly weeps and laments thereat; yet (according to order) I must againe speake of our sorrowfull Vrsina , who hath other more mournfull parts, and lamentable passions to act upon the stage of this her History. Who having thus received the repulse and refusall from her treacherous lover Sanctifiore , she (within a moneth after) with a sorrowfull heart  & courage, resolves (as well as she may) to dispence for a time with her teares, and to provide for her reputation, shee hath as yet acquainted none but Sanctifiore with her disgrace of her great belly, for neither her kinsfolkes, friends, neighbours, father, or his servants doe as yet know it; shee is of a weake body and feeble constitution, and therefore to conceale this scandall from her father, as also from all the world, and to provide for the lying downe of her great belly, she holds it requisite to discover this great and important secret but only to one, and so to crave the aid  & assistance of this confident bosom friend. To which end, she thinkes none so fit for her purpose, & therefore makes choice of no other, but of an old aunt of hers, who was her mothers sister named Dona Mellefanta , who being a wise and rich widdow woman, dwelt at Putzeole some to small miles distant from Naples, a place so famous for its subterranean grots, vaults, and water workes, when inventing an excuse to her Father which was as worthy of her art and policy as shee was every way unworthy of these her crosses and afflictions; shee tells him that it is not unknowne to him how she hath a long time beene weake and sickly, that the aire of Naples is neither wholesome for her, nor pleasing to her, and because shee hath often dreamt she shall in a little time recover her former health in Putzeole, shee humbly beseecheth him that hee will speedily send her thither to live some small time there with her Aunt Mellefanta her Father Seignior de Tores , whose age, contentment, and joy lived chiefly in the youth, prosperity and health of this his only child and daughter, makes her will and desire herein to be his, when not knowing any thing of the distast that had past betweene his daughter, and the Baron of Sanctifiore , or of his affection to the Lady Bertranna , hee demanded of her when you are at Putzeole what shall become of the Baron of Sanctifiore , to whom (rather from her apron-strings than her heart) she returnes this witty and speedy answer, if Sanctifiore love me, hee will then sometimes leave Naples and visit mee, or if hee doe not I will not love him; which reply of hers pleased her father so well that hee causeth her to sit up her apparell and bagage, and within three daies after, (attended on by a chamber maid, and a man of his sends her away to Putzeole in his coach to his sister Mellifanta , where being arived shee speedily and privatly acquaints her aunt with this great secret of her great belly, which so much imports her reputation, or disgrace, and also with all the circumstances thereof, and so prayes her best love and assistance to her herein, the which shee faithfully promiseth her, adding withall, that because shee is of her owne blood, shee will regard and love her as her owne child, telling her that shee highly commended her policy, for thus blinding the eyes of her father, and for leaving Naples, to come lay downe her great belly with her in Putzeole; yet shee could not chuse but blame her for the cause thereof in suffering her selfe to bee thus abused and betrayed, by so base a Nobleman as the Baron of Sanctifiore , but then againe shee excuseth that errour of this her neece upon the freshnes of her youth, and beauty, and bids her feare nothing but to resolve to bee here cheerfull, couragious and merry with her. Here we see our beautifull Vrsina safe at Putzeole under the wings and protection of her aunt Mellifanta , and far of from the eyes of the knowne or suspected rejoycing enemies of her disgrace; lodged in a dainty house, a delicate ayre having variety of curious sweet gardens, and dainty ranckes and groves of orenge and lemon trees to walke in, well attended on, and faring most delitiously; and who therefore would beleeve, that shee would not now quite abandon her former sorrowes and teares, and wholly reject and cast of that base Baron of Sanctifiore who so ingratfully had ruined, and so treacherously had first forsaken and rejected her; but here in Putzeole wee shall see her performe nothing lesse; for although she yet hold him to bee intangled in the lures of Bertrannas beauty, and the temptations of her father de Tores wealth, yet judging his heart and affections by her owne, and measuring him by her selfe, shee still loves him so dearely that she neverthelesse beleeves hee cannot hate her so deadly as to reject and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80024001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDF2FC1&area=prose&forward=textsFT) repundiate her to marry the said Bertranna , when the more to fortifie her beleefe and resolution thereof, she very often againe reads over his two former letters which wee have heard and seene, and therein finding, that by his conscience and soule, and by heaven and by God hee had bound himselfe to marry her, and to love and die her faithfull husband; shee then beleeves that no man, much lesse a Nobleman, and least of all a christian will bee so prophane and impious (without any cause or reason) to violate all these his great oathes and promises so deeply made, and so religiously attested unto God, wherefore although this Baron of Sanctifiore were absent from her, yet seeing him still present in her eyes and heart, shee therefore (in consideration of the promises) doth yet continually so plead for him against her selfe, and for his affection and fidelity to her against her suspition and dissidence of him, that she yet flatters her selfe with a conceit that in the end his conscience will so call home his thoughts, and God his conscience, that hee will marry her selfe, and none but her selfe. Againe considering him to be the Father of her unborne babe, shee thinkes her selfe a very unkind and unnaturall mother, if shee should not love him for her childs sake as well as for his owne, and that God would neither blesse her nor her burthen, if shee should any way neglect or omit him; upon the foundations of which reasons, (truely and courteously laid by her, but so falsly and treacherously by him) shee thinkes it a good way and an excellent, expedient for her, to seeke to reclaime him to her by a letter, the proofe whereof since his defection from her, she had not as yet practised or experienced, but as shee began to fall on this resolution, her hope and despaire of Sanctifiore and yet her love and affection to him, make her meet and fall on a doubtfull scruple, whether shee should write kindly or cholerickly to him, but at last her affection to him, declining and excusing his infidelity to her, and her love, and courtesie giving a favourable construction to his cruelty towards her, shee holds it more behouefull for her desire,  & his returne, to write to him passionately and effectually, but not harshly or severely, and so to take the sweet and faire way which shee desired, but not the sharp and bitter which hee deserved; when flying to her closet, she (full of griefe and teares) writes him this ensuing letter, the which without the knowledge of her Aunt Mellifanta shee sends him to Naples, by her trusty menssenger Sebastiano her Fathers coachman.  have left Naples to sojourne here for a time in Putzeole with the Lady Mellifanta mine aunt, where thy presence will make mee as truly joyfull and happie, as I feele and know my selfe infinitly miserable without it; For although of late (but for what cause, or reason, God knowes I knowe not) it hath pleased thee to excercise my affection and patience in thy discontent; yet in regard I am thy wife by purchase, sith thou art my Husband by promise, whereof the copies of thy former letters will informe and remember thee, that thou madest God the judge, and the soule and consciences the witnesses, I cannot beleeve that thou art so irreligious, or that thou bearest mee so little love, or so much malice, to make thy selfe guilty of such foule infidelity to mee, and impiety towards God, and I appeale to them all if my tender  & untainted affection to thee have not every way deserved the contrary at thy hands. Againe, as in hoping to marry thee I gave thee my heart, so in assurance and counfidence thereof, thou didest likewise bereave mee of my honour, and therefore if the conterpane of that contract doe anyway fade or dye in thy memory, yet rest confident, that the Originall lives still in Heaven, as the pledge and seale thereof doth now in my unhappie wombe here on earth; mistake mee not my deare Sanctifiore , for I write not this out of any malice, but out of true affection to thee, to the end that thou maiest thereby seriously consider, and religiously remember with thy selfe, what I am to thee, thou to my selfe, and what that unfortunate Innocent unborne babe in my belly is to us both. And although I am thy wife before God, yet I will now in all humility make my selfe thy handmaid and with a world of sighes and teares throw my selfe at thy feet (and lower if I could) to conjure and begge thee; By my poore beauty which once thou didest so much admire and adore, by the memory of my lost virginity, which thou wrested'st from mee with so many amarous sighes and teares, by all thy deepe oathes, vowes and promises which thou so religiously gavest mee to remaine still loving to mee, by thine honour which should bee dearer to thee than thy life, by thy conscience, and soule which ought to bee far more pretious to thee than all the lives and honours of the world, yea for thy poore infants sake, and lastly for Gods sake, abandon thy unjust displeasure and immerited discontent conceived against mee, and my deare Sanctifiore come away to mee to Putzeole, and there make mee thy wife in the sight of his Church and people, as I am already in that of heaven and his Angells, I say againe, come away to mee my sweet Sanctifiore , for thy sight will delight my heart, and thy presence and company ravish my soule with joy. It is impossible for Bertranna , either to love or honour thee the thousand part so dearly as thy Vrsina doth, and till death resolves to doe; I will freely forget all thy former escapes and discourtesies towards mee, and doe attribute them more to her foolish vanity, than any way to thy unkind disposition or inclination, yea I will not knit my browes when thou comest to mee, but will cheerfully and joyfully prepare my selfe to feast thee with smiles, and to surfet thee with kisses: But if contrariwise thou wilt not hearken unto mee, or this my letter, or regard these my just requests and sorrowes, nor obey and follow God and thy conscience herein, in speedily repairing to mee to make mee thy joyfull wife, then what shall I doe or say, but according as I am bound in affection and duty to thee, I will notwithstanding still resolve to love thee dearly, though thou, hate mee deadly, and to pray for thee though thou curse mee; yea I will then leave thee to God, and religiously beseech his divine majestie, to bee a just judge betweene both of us, of my firme affection and constancy to thee, and of thy cruell ingratitude and treacherie to mee. Live thou as happie, as thy constant Vrsina knowes that without thee, shee shall assuredly live sorrowfully and die miserablie. Vrsina.  Her messenger Sebastiano arives privatly at Naples and finds out the Baron of Sanctifiore in his chamber by the fire to whom hee gives and delivers this letter, who at first (knowing from whom it came) stood a pretty whiles musing and consulting with himselfe, whether he should read or burne it, but at last hee breakes up the seales thereof, and with much adoe affords himselfe the time and patience to peruse it, which having done, although hee no way merited to receive so sweet and loving a letter from Vrsina , yet not blushing for shame, but looking pale with envie and malice thereat, hee darting forth a disdainfull frowne, and tearing the letter in peeces, throwes it into the fire, when turning himselfe hastily towards Sebastiano who stood neere him and saw all that hee had done, hee in great choler spake to him thus. Tell that proud and foolish gigglet Vrsina , that I disdaine her as much as shee writes, shee loves mee, and that as now so ever hereafter I will returne no other answer to her, and her letters but contempt and silence, when to expresse his greater fury, Sebastiano was no sooner forth his chamber, but he very hastily throwes fast the doore after him, and in this furious and cholericke manner doth this base Sanctifiore receive the love, and entertaine the letter of our sweet and sorrowfull Vrsina . Sebastiano as much grieving as admiring at the incivill choler and rage of Sanctifiore , presently leaves Naples, and carries home this poore newes and cold comfort to his young Mistris the Lady Vrsina at Putzeole, the which hee faithfully and punctually delivers to her, who expected nothing lesse but derectly the contrary thereof. She is amazed to understand this his disdainfull, barbarous, and cruell answer, and infinitly perplexed in mind, that hee should first teare then burne her letter and for converting his pen into Sebastianos tongue for his answer thereof; But above all that word of his gigglet kild her very heart with sorrow, to thinke that for all her former courtesies shewed him, hee should now at last repay her with this foule ingratitude and scandalous aspersion, at the sorrowfull thought and consideration whereof, resolving to make her piety exceed his cruelty, shee could not refraine from bedewing her roseat cheeks with many pearled teares, not from evaporating this heavenly ejaculation from the profundity of her heart, and the centre of her soule; God forgive the Baron of Sanctifiore , and bee mercifull to mee Vrsina a great and wretched sinner, had shee continued in this godly mind and resolution shee had done well, but ahlas (notwithstanding the wholesome comfort and councell of her aunt Mellefanta ) wee shall shortly see her runne a contrary course and cariere. It is a common phrase, and proverb, that misfortune seldome comes alone, which wee shall now see our sorrowfull Vrsina will verifie by her deepe sighes, and confirme by her bitter teares for this discourtesie of Sanctifiore towards her, for shee hath so deeply nayled it in her mind, and riveted it in her heart, that it begins to impaire her health and strength, and consequently to pervert and alter the constitution of her body, so that whereas her poore unborne babe had lived but one full moneth within her, she now finds so many suddaine throwes, and unacustomed convulsions, that shee is speedily constrained to betake her selfe to her bed, when calling upon her aunt Mellefanta , and withall possible hast sending a way for the midwife, shee after many sharpe torments, and bitter cries and groanes (to the great perrill and eminent danger of her life) is delivered of a verie pretty little sonne, which God sends into the world dead borne; now although shee want no curious care, comfort and attendance from her aunt, in this her sicknes and extremity, yet shee weeps bitterlie, and pittifully for the abortive birth, and untimely death of her poore innocent babe, and infant, and because her aunt sees, that this last affliction and sorrow of her neece doth infinitly encrease and revive her former, and that shee also conceives a wonderfull feare in her heart, and scruple in her conscience that it is only her immoderate griefe and sorrow which hath kild her child, therefore as a discreet matrone and wise Lady, (to remove this article out of her neeces beliefe and memory) tells her plainly and freely, that shee is extremly deceived in that point and doubt of feare, and that it is not her sorrow, but the base ingratitude and treachery of her false lover Sanctifiore to her selfe which kild her child within her; A tart and yet a true speech, which Vrsina neither will so soone, nor can so easily forget, as her aunt Mellefanta hath spoken it, but shall I here rearme this to be affection in Vrsina towards Sanctifiore , or a needlesse vanity, or superfluous ceremony in her selfe: For shee desires to kisse her breathlesse innocent babe for his sake, which shee doth, when giving it a thousand kisses, then washing his face with her teares, and lamenting and grieving that shee could not breath life into it with her sighes, shee recommends it againe to her aunt, and shee the same night to its secret and decent buriall. Whiles thus Vrsina remaines very weake and sicke in her bed, yet still her heart and affection lookes constantly on Sanctifiore as the needle of the compasse doth to the north, notwithstanding all his base ingratitude, and cruelty from time to time shewed towards her, and because it is a thousand griefes and pitties that ever hee set his eyes on her, or shee on him, and as many shames for him, first to seduce and then to betray her, therefore who would anyway commend her for continuing of her love to him, or rather who would not infinitly blame her of folly, and condemne her for want of wit, and judgment, ever any more either to hope or hearken after him: And yet this silly young Lady is so bewitched to him as in the very middest of her sicknes and sorrowes, and contrary to all sence and reason here breakes forth a sparckle and flash of her policy in her selfe; and of her affection towards him; She neither can, nor dare trust any other but Sebastiano her coachman, with this great secret which so much imports her honour or disgrace, or with this her message with Sanctifiore from whom (though in vaine) shee expects some hope and content, when exempting all from her chamber, she calls him to her beds side, and swearing him to secrecy, (for want of strength to write chargeth him presently to ride poast to Naples againe to find out the Baron of Sanctifiore and to tell him from her, that she her selfe is extreme sicke, and not like to live, that shee is delivered of his  & her Sonne who is dead borne, and therefore that she begs him, that for Gods sake hee will speedily come over to her, because for his good, and her content, she infinitly desireth to discharge her mind and conscience to him before she goe to heaven; So Sebastiano , (in discharge of his dutie, and his Ladies commands) seems rather to fly than poast to Naples, where ariving to Sanctifiores house, and finding him within; hee sends him up his name by one of his men, as also that hee most earnestly desires to speake a word with his Lordship: but Sanctifiore knowing who it was, and therefore imagining from whom hee came, bids his man carry Sebastiano backe this answer that hee will neither speake with him nor see him. Sebastiano is perplexed with this his short and sharp reply, but because his message is of great importance, as also for that hee exceedingly respecteth and honoureth his young Lady and mistris, hee resolves not to returne to her as a foole; to which end, at the foot of the staires hee enquireth of another of his servants when hee thinkes his Lord will goe forth, who tells him hee will take coach within halfe an houre; whereof Sebastiano being exceeding glad, hee thinkes it best to stay for him in the street, where (with much vigilancy and impatiency) hee attends his comming, so at last hee sees him issue forth his gate; when presently Sebastiano placeth him selfe betwixt him and his coach, and with his hat in his hand, very resolutly and orderly delivereth him his mistris her message at full, the which Sanctifiore understanding, hee at first smiles thereat, but then presently againe entering into choler, hee rounds Sebastiano this answer in his eare, tell that strumpet thy mistris Vrsina from mee, that I wish shee were buryed with her bastard, and that they were both with the devill, and so without speaking any one word more, in a mighty fume of anger and disdaine, hee throwes himselfe away from Sebastiano into his coach, and speedily hurries away to his sweet heart Bertranna , from whom hee is seldome or never absent, to whom hee revealed all that had past in this passage, endevouring as much as in him lyes to make it to be as wel her laughture, as his owne contempt and scorne. Now here ere I proceed farther, I know there is no christian whatsoever, but that his very heart and soule, will yearne within him, at the reading of these cruell, barbarous and hellish speeches of this base hearted Nobleman against our sorrowfull and unfortunate Vrsina , and her poore harmlesse deceased babe, and no lesse doth Sebastiano in hearing  & my selfe in penning and relating them: doe I tearme him Nobleman? O let mee (with respect and repentance) revoke that noble title from Sanctifiore , and to give him his due, let me tearme him as hee is a monster of men, or if hee will, a noble deboshed villaine, or whether hee will or no, a meere tyrant, or else a devill in the shape of a man, to use such ingratefull cruelties, and hellish actions and speeches against these two innocent persons, who contrariwise in the highest degree, deserved from him all manner of affection, respect, charity, pitty and compassion; but let him looke to him selfe as well as he can, yet (God being as just as mercifull) it is not impossible for him in the end to pay deare for these his foule infidelities and cruelties. Returne wee now to Sebastiano who (by this time) is returned to Putzeole whereof hee presently sends up notice to his young Lady and mistris Vrsina who still keepes her bed through discontent and sicknes, but at the newes of his arrivall, or rather hopeing that hee had brought her some good newes from her Sanctifiore ; shee (without any regard to her weaknesse and sicknesse) riseth from her bed by the fire, and calls her chamber maid for her night gowne, which haveing drawne on, shee bids her for a whiles to absent her selfe, and to send up her coachman Sebastiano to her, and although in his sorrowfull lookes and countenance shee may already tacitly reade a large lecture of the bad newes hee brings her from Sanctifiore , yet shee calls him to her, and bids him speake on; but ahlas hee speaketh too soone for her, for (with a faltring and trembling voice) hee tells her the harsh entertainment, which Sanctifiore gave to him and his message in Naples, and the inhumane and cruell answer which hee bad him returne to her in Putzeole, without any way adding or diminishing a word thereof; the which as soone as she understood, shee for the extremity of her griefe and sorrow hangs downe her head, and crossing her armes uttereth this passionate speech: good God is it possible that Sanctifiore will thus abuse mee, or is this the favour which I must expect of him in requitall of those extraordinary courtesies hee hath received from mee; when walking up and downe her chamber, shee thankes Sebastiano , and giving him some gold for his paines, bids him to leave her, and to send up her aunt Mellefanta , and her chamber maid to bring her to bed; who thereupon running up hastily to her, her aunt chides her for the little care shee had of her owne health, but more for her foolish teares, and indiscreet sorrowes. Now after they had laine her in her bed, and that Vrsina had purposly sent away her maid, shee prayes her aunt to shut her chamber doore, and then to sit downe by her beds side for that shee had some secrets of importance to reveale unto her; when with a thousand sighes and teares, bedewing the roses and lilies of her fresh and lovely cheeks, she acquaints her from point to point, what had now againe past betweene Sanctifiore and her selfe, in this second journey of Sebastiano to him at Naples. Her aunt Mellefanta laughes as much at this folly of her neece Vrsina , as shee her selfe weepes at her owne sorrowes and afflictions; and having as much wit as the other had weaknes, shee makes bold to call her sot, and foole, to care for him who contemned and scorned her, and for setting that to her heart which hee did at his heele, yea shee advanced further in this her passionate choler to her and said, fie, fie neece, sell your sorrowes to buy more courage and wit, and so because that base Baron Sanctifiore detests and defies you, pay him in his owne coyne, and doe the like to him, a sharpe and bitter speech which Vrsina (amidst her sorrowes) now conveyes to her heart, and it may be wee shall hereafter see her to remember it, when her aunt Mellefanta hath forgotten it: for poore soule, shee being as it were depressed and weighed downe, with the multitude of Sanctifiores affronts and disgraces, and of his treacheries and cruelties to her, shee hath wept so much as shee yet weeps because shee can weepe no more thereat; as if the difference of their constellations and horoscopes were such, that as Sanctifiore was borne to hate her, so was shee notwithstanding, (as yet) to affect and love him. Ahlas Vrsina ; It is true indeed, that the least of these treacheries, and cruelties of Sanctifiore to thee, are causes enough of all thy teares and sorrowes; but yet the consideration and comparing of those with these, conducts and leads mee to this dilemma; that I know not whether hee bee more to be blamed for committing the first, or thou for permitting the second, in regard they are every way more worthy of thy scorne than of thy care and of thy contempt than of thy affliction. His ingratitude, and crimes to thee I know are many in quantity, and very base and odious in quality, yea their number is so great and their nature so foule, that their recapitulation cannot bee drawen within a smaller nor their repetition contracted in a lesser or narrower volume than this; hee hath betraid his love, violated his faith, and falsified his oathes and promises to thee, he hath bereaved thee of thy virginity, torne and burnt thy letters, disdained to see thee, called thee gigglet and whore; thy innocent babe bastard, and which is worst of all, hee hath wilfully and cholerickly wished both of you to the devill; so judge with thy selfe Vrsina , if all these bee not faire motives for thee still to love Sanctifiore , or rather if they bee not just reasons and provocations for thee now at last to hate him, or if thou thinke they bee not enough to worke and establish this metamorphosis in thee, have but a little patience, and it is not impossible for thee to find more to affect and finish it; for now whiles her aunt Mellefanta is rating and ratling her for not casting off her heart and hopes from Sanctifiore ; and Vrsina (in counterexchange) chiding her aunt because shee cannot indure that she should eternally love him, here falls out an unexpected accident (within a moneth after she had prettily recovered her health and strength) which wee shall presently see will worke and produce strang effects both in her heart and mind as also in her affections and resolutions towards her Sanctifiore , for as yet (privatly to her selfe) shee many times so tearmes and stiles him. On a faire afternoone, when the sunne (that glorious lampe of heaven) had in his fiery glistering chariot taken leave of the south, and was poasting towards the west, to view the Atlanticke seas, as the Lady Mellefanta caried her neece Vrsina forth in her coach to take the ayre, and too recreate her sorrowfull spirits, in a great walke of orenge trees, orderly and pleasantly growing upon the banckes of a fine christall brooke about a mile from Putzeole, they a far of (in the boote of the coach) espied two horsemen gallopping directly towards them, when Vrsina flattering her selfe with hope, and therefore blushing for joy, that it was her Sanctifiore , who was purposely come from Naples towards Putzeole to see her, she therefore cries out to her coachman Sebastiano to stay the coach and to attend and expect them; when presently shee sees her hopes deceived, and her joyes ended as soone as began, for the one was a servant of Mellefantas who from Putzeole conducted thither to Vrsina a servant of her father Placedo's who came from Naples with a letter from him to her, whereupon the aunt much wondering, and the neece far more what this suddaine busines might bee, they both descend the coach, and Vrsina taking her fathers letter from his man, shee steps a little aside from her aunt Mellefanta , and breaking up the seale thereof; (directly contrary to her expectation and desires) finds these lines therein.  health, my will and order therefore to thee now is, that thou speedily returne home to mee to Naples (in thy coach) by the bearer hereof, whom I have purposely sent to conduct thee hither. I beleeve that thy country absence; hath lost thee a good fortune here in the citty, for yesterday morning the Baron of Sanctifiore was (in the augustines Church) married to Dona Bertranna , daughter to Seignior de Tores , with great state and solemnity, whom I had well hoped should have beene thy husband, I remember my best respects to my sister, thy aunt Mellefanta; and my best prayers to God for thy vertues and prosperity, as being thy loving father. Placedo.  Vrsina hath no sooner read this letter, but every member of her body trembles for griefe and vexation thereat, yea her sorrowes are so great, as shee cannot speake a word, when being ready to fall to the ground, her aunt Mellefanta steps to her assistance and so doe the two men, but they have all of them much adoe to support her up, when at last wringing her hands, and looking up stedfastly to heaven, she throwing her letter to her aunt to reade, utters forth this bitter exclamation against Sanctifiore ; and hath this base Nobleman at last requited all my love, with this monstrous ingratitude and treachery! O why doe I live to suffer it? and O wherefore should hee live for offering it to mee? her aunt reads her letter and in detestation of Sanctifiores basenes, shee addes fuell to the flame of her neeces choler against him, but shee needs not, for this very last act of his marriage with Bertranna , sets her all in fire and revenge against him, yea her heart is so absolutely diverted, and taken away from him, as heretofore she never loved him so much as now shee hates him; shee sweares to her selfe, that shee will make him pay deare for this his ingratitude and treachery towards her, and limits her revenge with no lesse than his death for so basely abusing and deceiving her, shee but now threw away his letter for sorrow, but now shee againe takes it up for joy, because it calls her home to Naples, where as soone as shee arives shee againe and againe resolves and vowes with her selfe that shee will murther him her selfe, or cause him to bee murthered by some others, her aunt Mellefanta by all sweet meanes and perswasions, seeks to pacifie her discontent and fury, and so to appease and coole the raging tempests of her heart; but shee speakes to a deafe woman, who is not capable, either of councell consolation or reason, for her mallice and revenge against Sanctifiore have so fully taken up her heart and soule, and so absolutly surprised her thoughts and possessed her resolutions, that shee neither resolves nor thinkes of any thing else, but how and in what manner shee may murther him; to which end shee takes coach for Putzeole, there packes up her baggage, conceales her bloody intents and resolutions towards Sanctifiore from her aunt Mellefanta ; thankes her most lovingly and courteously for all her care of her, and affection to her; the remembrance whereof she affirmes she will beare to her grave, and from thence to heaven, and so within three daies takes leave of her, and returnes to Naples to her father, who receives her with much content and joy, and is very glad of the recovery of her health, and yet perceives some secret discontent lie lurking in the furrowes of her browes; but shee dissembleth it both to him and the world, and so beares her selfe fairely, modestly, and temperatly towards him in her speeches and actions, who all this whiles is every way ignorant of her disgracefull great belly, as also of the birth  & buriall of her infant child. She is no sooner come to Naples, but her deadly malice and revenge to Sanctifiore will give no truce to her thoughts, nor peace to her resolutions, for her heart having conspired with the devill, and both of them against God to dispatch him to heaven; so now from the matter shee falles to the manner, and from her consultation to the practise thereof. She first thinkes it best to get him poysoned, to which end within ten dayes after her arivall to Naples shee sends for her owne Apothecary named Antonio Romancy , and having sworne him to secrecy profers him two hundred duckatons to poyson her mortall enemy the Baron of Sanctifiore , but Romancy is too honest a man and too religious a christian to undertake it, and so utterly refuseth her, and rejecteth her profer; and then and there with many godly reasons and pious speeches, endevoureth to disswade her from this foule and bloody fact, but hee speakes either to the wind or to a deafe woman, for shee is resolute not to retire but to advance in this her cruell and inhumane designe, only shee here againe strongly conjures this honest Apothecary to secrecie, the which hee solemnly promiseth. Vrsina is still implacable in her malice and revenge against Sanctifiore , the which revives with more violence, and flames forth with the greater impetuositie, when shee (by her secret spies) is given to understand that hee triumpheth in her affliction and scandall, and reputes it his chiefest content and felicity to have erected the trophees of his joy upon the ruines of her honour and the demolitions of her reputation and fame, as also that shee and this her disgrace is now become the publike laughter and private scorne and glory of his proud and ambitious wife Bertranna : so shee cannot endure the thought, much lesse digest the remembrance and consideration hereof, and therefore shee speedily resolves to reduce her malitious contemplation into bloody action towards him, and to try another experiment and conclusion thereof. She in a pleasant morning somewhat sooner than accustomed, walkes alone with her waiting maid, in her fathers curious and dainty garden, but not to please her eyes with the delicious sight and fragrant smell of the great variety of rare and faire flowers wherewith it was richly adorned and diapred; or to recreate and delight her eares with the mellifluous ditties and madrigalls of those sweet quiristers of the aire, the nightingalls, thrushes, and lennots, who sate chaunting of some sweet division on some trees of this garden, and on some branches of these trees; or to preserve her selfe from the intemperate heat of the scorching sunne beames; and therefore either to passe her time, either in some shaddowed walkes and arbours, or to sit her selfe downe by some curious chrystall fountaine, with all which delights and rarities this her fathers garden was deliciously inriched and embelished; O no, nothing lesse, for shee was resolute to make her selfe more miserable, and not so happie, because her thoughts were wholly bent on blood, and her resolutions on the murther of Sanctifiore at what price or rate soever. Having therefore formerly mist of her Apothecary Romancy to poyson him, shee else knowes not any so fit or proper to dispatch him as her trusty coachman Sebastiano , who (as wee have formerly understood) was both an eye and an eare witnesse of this his base and ignoble crueltie towards her: wherefore shee by her waiting maid, sends for him into the garden to her, and with many ruthfull lookes, and sorrowfull sighes, having first commended and applauded his fidelity to her, and then sworne him to secrecy to what shee should now relate and deliver unto him, shee tells him, that shee cannot live except that base Lord Sanctifiore dye, and therefore shee profereth him an hundred Spanish double pistolls of gold, if hee will either murther him by night in the streets with his rapier, or pistoll him to death abroad in the fields, at his first seeing, and meeting of him, to the which shee very earnestly prayes and requests him. Sebastiano as amazed at this bloody proposition and entreaty of his young Lady Vrsina , whom hee ever held to bee more charitable, and not so cruell hearted to any one of the world, and although hee be poore, yet hee is so honest, vertuous and religious, as hee highly refuseth to distaine his heart, or dip his hands in innocent blood for any silver or gold whatsoever. So in humble (and yet in absolute) tearmes, hee gives her the deniall, and (with teares in his eyes) prayes her to desist from this her cruell purpose, because hee affirmes to her, that the end of murther proves most commonly but the beginning of shame, repentance, misery, and confusion to their authors; so shee bites her lip, and hangs her head for sorrow, at this his repulse and refusall; and yet is so cautious and wary in her actions, as shee makes him againe swear secrecy to her in all thinges, which now doth, or hereafter may concerne this businesse, the which hee faithfully promiseth her, provided, that her commands and his seruice bee every way exempt of the effusion of innocent blood, and the perpetration of murther, to the which hee constantly vowes to her, it is impossible for him ever to bee seduced or drawen, and so hee takes leave of her, and leaves her solitarily alone in the garden to her muses; but yet as hee was issuing forth shee againe calls him to her, and strictly chargeth him first carefully and curiously to informe himselfe, and then hee her, of Sanctifiores most frequent haunts, and walkes without the cittie, the which hee likewise promiseth her to performe. Our malitious and revengefull Vrsina is not contented to receive the deniall from her Apothecary Romancy , and the repulse from her coachman Sebastiano , about the finishing of this deplorable busines, but without making any good use of their honest and religious disswasions of her from it, or without once looking up to God, or thinking of heaven or hell, shee as a fatall member, and prodigious agent of Sathan , is still resolute to proceed therein; for he is still so strong with her heart, because her faith and soule are so weake with God, that shee sees not her selfe so often in her looking glasse with delight, as shee both sees, and finds Sanctifiore in her heart and mind with detestation; for her mallice to him hath quite expelled all reason, and banished all charity and piety in her selfe, and consequently now made her memorative and capable of nothing but of revenge and blood towards him; which takes up every part, and usurpes every point both of her time, and of her selfe, yea and workes so strang (I may rather truly say so miserable) a metamorphosis in her, as if shee were now wholly composed of one, or both of these two impious and diabolicall vices, so that every moment seemes a yeare, and every day an age to her, before shee hath dispatched him for heaven; she now sees that shee cannot (with safety) employ any other herein but her selfe, and therefore day by day calling upon Sebastiano to know of him, where Sanctifiores usuall haunts and walkes were without the cittie, hee at last tells her that hee is fullie assured, that most mornings and evenings he takes his coach and some times his page, but many times alone, and so goes a mile out of the cittie beyond the gate which lookes towards Saint Germaines and there in a dainty grove of olives and orenge trees (neere a small rivers side) hee with his booke in his hand, and his spaniell dogge at his heeles passeth an houre or two alone in his private contemplations, his coach being sometimes out of sight from him, and sometimes returnes to the cittie, and so comes and fetcheth him backe againe; which report is no sooner heard and understood of Vrsina from her coachman, but shee receives it with much joy, and entertaines it with infinite content and delectation; shee is therefore so cruell in her thoughts, and so determinate and bloody in her resolutions, as shee will protract no time, but shee speedily bethinkes her selfe of a hellish stratagem and policy (no lesse strange than cruell) which the devill him selfe suggested and found out for her, to wreake her inveterate malice and infernall revenge in murthering of Sanctifiore , the manner whereof is thus. She very secretly provides her selfe of a friers complete weed, as a sad ruffet gowne,  & coule, with a girdle of a knottie rope, & woodden sandalls, proper to the order of the Bonnes homes (which is the reformed one of that of S. Francis ) with a false negligent old beard, and haire for his head sutable to the same, and in one of the pockets of this frocke, shee puts a small begging box, such as those friers use to carry in cittie, and country when they crave the charitable almes and devotion of well disposed people, as also a new breviary (or finall masse booke) of the last edition and forme of Rome, bound up in blew turky leather richly guilt, but in the other pocket thereof shee puts a couple of small short pistolls which shee had secretly purloined out of her father Placedo's armory, and had charged each of them with a brace of bullets, fast rammed downe, with priming powder in the pans, and all these fatall trinckets, shee (with equall silence and treachery) packes and tyes up close in the gowne, expecting the time and houre to worke this her cruell and lamentable feare on innocent Sanctifiore , who little thinkes or dreames what a bloody banquet his old love, and now his new enemy Vrsina is preparing for him. And here I write with griefe that it was the tuesday after Palme Sunday, (a time and weeke which the blessed passion of our Saviour Christ Jesus, makes sacred and famous, and which all true christians in his commemoration ought to keepe holy, and not to polute or defile it with barbarous and bloody sacrifices) when our masculine monster, or rather our femall fury Vrsina , being assured by Sebastiano that the Baron of Sanctifiore was that day about three of the clocke after dinner gone out alone in his coach to his aforesaid usuall place of walking a mile off the cittie in the fields; shee infinite glad of this desired occasion and longed for opportunity, bids Sebastiano make ready his coach, and silently to leave him without the posterne gate of her fathers garden, and so presently to come up to her chamber to her, the which hee as soone performes; to whom she now (prophanely and treacherously sayes) Sebastiano , (by the favour and mercy of God) I have now exchanged my cruelty into courtesie towards the Baron of Sanctifiore , and doe therefore presently resolve to give him a merry meeting in the fields, whereat before our departure and returne, I know thou wilt rejoyce and laugh heartely at the fight hereof; the which indeed was very welcome and pleasing newes to Sebastiano , to whom shee then gives this little fardell, and so purposely leaving her waiting maid behind her, shee cheerefully and speedily followes him to the coach, wherein being seated and the litle fardell likewise within by her; shee bids him drive away withall speed to find out Sanctifiore , the which (armed with his innocency) hee joyfully doth. Now as they are come within two flight shots of him, Vrsina bids Sebastiano not to proceed farther, but to drive in the coach into some close shaddowed place out of the high way, where they might see Sanctifiore , but not (as yet) to bee either seene or espied of him; which accordingly hee doth, where shee descends her coach, drawes off her when apparell, and so puts on her false friers apparell as also the haire, and beard, having made and prepared all things fit and ready before, and here likewise shee foldeth up the tresses and tramells of her owne haire under it, and hath purposely shaved away the haire of a little part of the crowne of her head, and all this whiles her coachman Sebastiano turnes her chamber maid here in the fieldes to make her ready, where hee cannot refraine from exceedingly smiling and laughing to see what a strang metamorphosis this now is, that his young Lady Vrsina is here become an old frier, but still shee hides and conceales her two pistolls carefully in her pocket from him, as also her bloody designes and intents towards Sanctifiore , and whereof hee as every way as innocent, as shee her selfe, and only her selfe is guilty thereof. Now being all in a readines, she out of her other pocket takes her almes box and holds it in one of her hands, and her howres (or breviary) in her other, and so taking leave of her coachman, and (with a dissembling cheerefull countenance) charging him to pray for her good fortune, and speedily to bring up her coach to her, as soone as hee sees her wave her white handkercher towards him; so, as a jolly old frier, away this she devill softly trips towards Sanctifiore , having piety in her lookes, but prophanesse and barbarous cruelty in her heart and intentions, and all the way as shee goes, Sebastiano cannot refraine from laughing to see this great change, and alteration in his young Lady and mistris, but directly beleeving that shee in merriment went amaying or masking, such was his ignorance that he least thought, or dreamt that shee went to commit murther, or what devill was here vailed and shrouded under this friers weed. So (with more assurance than feare, and with far more impiety than grace) shee goes on towards Sanctifiore , who was there alone walking and reading, to whom approaching, and giving him a ducke or two, she holding up her begging box, and counterfeiting an old friers voice, prayes him for the blessed Virgin Maries sake, and also for holy saint Francis sake to bestow some thing on him for their society and order; which Sanctifiore (being alone, as having sent backe his coach to the cittie) resolving to doe, hee seeing that faire new breviary in the friers hands; hee fairly takes it from him, and carefully vieweth and peruseth it, which being that which Vrsina aimed and looked for, shee for manenrs sake (but indeed purposely and malitiously) steps behinde him, and very softly drawing out one of her pistolls out of her pocket which was already bent, shee levels it at the very reines of his backe, and so lets flye at him, whereof hee presently was falling to the ground, when (the devill making her nimble and dexterious in her malice) in the turning of a hand, shee whips but the other pistoll out of her pocket, and to make sure worke with him likewise dischargeth it in his brest, and to make her inveterate malice and revenge to him the more conspicuous and apparant to all the world, as neere as shee could guesse to his very heart, of which mortall wounds made by her foure bullets Sanctifiore fell immediatly dead to the ground, having neither the power, grace or happines to speake a word; and then she pulling off her false beard, discovered her selfe to him as hee was dying, and spurning him most disdainfully and malitiously with her foote gave him this cruell farwell, such deaths such villaines deserve, who triumph and glory to betray harmelesse and innocent Ladies; which having acted and said, shee waving her hand kercher to her coachman, her comes up to her with her coach as swift as the wind, who is all amazed and in teares to behold this woefull accident and lamentable spectacle; for descending speedily from his coach, hee finds the Baron of Sanctifiore dead, and his soule already fled and ascended from earth to heaven, to whom his Lady Vrsina (in a gracelesse insulting bravery) sayes, rejoyce with mee Sebastiano , that I have now so bravely and fortunately revenged my selfe on this base and treacherous Baron Sanctifiore ; but honest Sebastiano ; (being as full of true griefe, as shee was of false joy) replies and tells her, O madame! what have you done? for this is no cause, and therefore no time to rejoyce but rather to lament and mourne, for this lamentable fact and crime of yours, and not to dissemble you the truth, as much as you (in this fatall friers frocke) did mee your bloody intentions, I have far more reason to feare than cause to doubt, that your murthering of the Baron of Sanctifiore , will prove the ruine and confusion of your selfe, except God bee gratiously pleased to bee more mercifull to you, than you have beene to him; therefore looke from his danger and misfortune speedily to provide for your owne safety; which as soone as hee had said, hee (in the friers weeds) speedily takes her up in the coach, and then drives away a full gallop to the shadowed thicket from whence shee came, where she casts of her friers apparell, beard, haire, box and booke, as also the two pistolls, the which they two wrap up all in the gowne, and throw it into a deepe ditch or precipice, and so hee helpes her to put on all her owne apparell and attire and then with more hast than good speed drives home a maine towards Naples, and it was a disputable question, whether our bloody and execrable wretch Vrsina more rejoyced, or her honest coachman Sebastiano lamented and grieved at this unfortunate and deplorable fact. Wee have seene with what a malitious courage, and a desperate and prophane resolution, this cruell hearted Gentlewoman Vrsina hath (in the habit of a frier) murthered this unfortunate Baron Sanctifiore , and the reader shall not goe much further in this history before (if not in the same moment, yet in the same houre) hee see the sacred justice of God will surprise and bring her to condigne punishment for the same, as if the last (as indeed it is) were co- incident and hereditary to the first, or as if it were wholy impossible for her to rejoyce so much here on earth for that, as God and his Angells doe both triumph and glory in heaven for this. Gods judgments are as just as sacred, and as miraculous as justs: so that all people should rather admire it with awfull reverence, than any way neglect it with a prophane presumption. But our wretched Vrsina will not make her selfe so happie to bee of the first, but rather so miserable to bee of this second rancke; for shee wholly dispiseth Gods justice, and so absolutely forgets God himselfe, as shee neither thinkes of what shee hath now done, what shee now is, or which is worst of all what hereafter shee may bee; but rather (as an inconsiderate and wretched gipsie) laughes in her sleeve for joy, to have thus happily bereaved Sanctifiore of his life, who so lately and so treacherously had bereaved her of her honour and chastity. Whiles thus sorrowfull Sebastiano is hurring away his joyfull murtherous young mistris the Lady Vrsina in her coach towards her Father Seignior Placedo's house in Naples, as (thinking to make his way the shorter and securer) hee drave his coach on a narrow path by the side of a hill, it so pleased God (in his sacred providence) as of his two coach horses, that of the out side fell sheare over the path and drew his fellow horse, the coach, the Lady Vrsina , and her coachman Sebastiano downe the hill after him; with which suddaine terrible fall the coach was shattered and torne in peeces, shee brake her right arme (wherewith shee had discharged these two pistolls) and hee his left legge, so that shee had the power but not the will, and hee the will but not the power to step to her assistance, only hee leaps from the coach box to the ground on his right legge, and with his knife cuts off the stayes and trappings of his horses, that they in their amazed fury might not draw the coach and themselves after them; and yet such is her impenitency and his affliction, as shee here was not halfe so much terrified, as hee perplexed and astonished at this their misfortunate disaster; the which though shee sleighted, as only looking downe to her selfe, yet hee deemed  & conceived it to be no lesse than a blow from heaven, as looking up to God, and therefore that it was a fatall Omen, portending some dismall calamities and afflictions which were immediately to surprise and betide them. As thus distressed Vrsina , and her lame and sorrowfull coachman Sebastiano , fate downe on the bare ground, rather able to behold, than to know how to helpe one the other; and they both grieving to see their coach lye torne on the lee side and shore of the hill, and their two coach-horses (without hurt or feare) licentiously playing their friskes and figuaries below in the valleies, neither hee nor shee knew what course to take for their present consolation and safety, and so to prevent the imminency of their danger, but at last shee taking some ten double pistolls of Spanish gold out of her pocket, and giving it him, she againe makes him swear secrecie, never to reveale what hee had seene her performe to Sanctifiore , the which (with more reluctancy than willingnes) hee doth. Then as it was agreed betweene them, hee by some loud cries and holla's should call in some contadines (or country labourers) to their assistance, whom they saw a good distance off very busily working in the vines, the which as hee was about to doe, loe God (in his sacred providence) so ordained, that the Baron of Sanctifiores coach came ratling above them, where they two sate comfortlesse and sorrowfull upon the ground; and in the coach was his page Hieronymo , who therewith was going to fetch home the Baron his master, who perfectly seeing and knowing the Lady Vrsina , and her coachman Sebastiano , and seeing her coach lye by her all reversed, shattered and torne to peeces, grieving at this her disaster, hee for the respect hee bore her for the Baron his masters sake, (whom hee knew formerly loved her) takes his coachman with him, and so descends downe to her assistance, where being more fully acquainted, of the breaking of her arme, and her coachman Sebastiano's legge, hee very humanely and courteously profers her his Lords coach, and his best service to conduct and cary them both home to her father Seignior Placedo's house in the cittie, little thinking or dreaming, that shee came from so cruelly murthering his kind Lord and master Sanctifiore , or that his breathlesse body lay now exposed as a prey to the fowles of the aire in the fields. Sebastiano is much perplexed and grieved, but his Lady Vrsina infinitely more at this unexpected encounter, and ominous, meeting of Sanctifiores page, coach, and coachman, which threatned her no lesse than feare, and this feare no lesse than imminent danger and confusion, especially to her selfe, if not to him, when looking wistly and sorrowfully each on other, they know not how to beare themselves in the unfortunacy of this accident, neither dare shee accept, or well knowes how to refuse this profered courtesie of the page Hieronymo . But at last (despight of her selfe) shee is enforced to imbrace this opportunity, when making a vertue of necessitie, shee (though much against her will) is constrained, very thankfully to accept, and make use of this kindnes of Hieronymo , who leading the Lady Vrsina by her left arme, and his coachman, hers by his right, they softly bring them up the hill to the Baron their masters coach, and so convey her home to her father Seignior Placedo's house in the cittie, who was then gone forth to sup with the Prince of Salerno (who by the mothers side, was his cosen Germane) where Vrsina (setting a good face upon her bad heart) gives the page many hearty thankes, and the coachman three duckatons for this their courtesie, so they take leave of her, and speedily returne with their coach into the fields to fetch home the Baron their master, to whom they resolve at full to relate this accident; when Vrsinas feares far exceeding her hopes, and knowing upon what ticklish tearmes and dangerous points both her selfe and her life now stood, shee (in the absence of her father) speedily resolves to provide her a swift coach and so to flye from Naples to her aunt Mellefantas house in Putzeole, where shee promised her selfe far more safetie and lesse danger than here at home with her father; but contrariwise, wee shall see that God is now resolved to deceive both her hopes, and her selfe herein, to her utter shame and confusion. The page Hieronymo being sorrowfull for the Lady Vrsinas misfortune, and yet exceeding glad that hee had the happines and good fortune to performe her this faire office, and friendly courtesie to her, hee now bids his coachman drive away ore the fields to that pleasant grove to find out their Lord and master Sanctifiore , where being arived hee descends his coach, and with his vigilant eye lookes about every where for him, when ahlas hee hath scarce gone forty paces off, but (directly contrary to his expectation) hee finds him there dead on the ground and most lamentably all gored, and engrained in his owne blood, at the sight whereof hee bursts forth into many bitter teares and out cries, yea hee throwes away his hat, and teares his haire for griefe and sorrow hereof, and no lesse doth his coachman. They are here both of them so amazed with griefe and astonished with sorrow at this lamentable spectacle and accident, as they (for a quarter of an houres time) know not what to thinke or say hereof, as whether this their Lord and master had here kild himselfe, or were murthered and robbed by theeves, but at last this sorrowfull page Hieronymo , will stay alone weeping by the breathlesse body of his Lord, and master, and so sends away the coachman, in his coach speedily to Naples, to acquaint their Lady Dona Bertranna , and her father Seignior de Tores with this sad and sorrowfull newes, whereat shee almost drownes her selfe in her teares, and hee very bitterly laments and sorroweth for it; so (being incapable of any hope comfort or consolation) they doe both of them take coach and drive away into the fields, where shee almost murthereth her eyes with her teares, to see her deare Lord and husband lie thus murthered in his blood. They here see none in sight of him, neither doe they know any body but them selves that hath seene him; so by whom, or how hee is kild they cannot as yet either conceive or imagin, when the father leaving his daughter to wash and bedew her dead husbands cheekes with her teares, hee himselfe gallops away in his coach to Naples and brings thence along with him the crimynall officers of justice, first to know and then to bee eye witnesses of this sad and deplorable accident; at the hearing and sight whereof, (in nature and justice) they cannot refraine from equally woondering and grieving at it, when (to act the part and duty of themselves) they cause the coachman to spread his cloake on the ground, then to remove the dead corps from his blood, and to lay him thereon, and so they make a chirurgion (whom they had purposely brought with them) to unapparell and search his body for wounds, who finds and shewes them, that hee was shot with two pistoll bullets in his backe, and other two in his brest, (when missing likewise of his purse) they all of them doe confidently beleeve, that undoubtedly hee was murthered and robbed by theeves. The which the better to discover, the judges send their sergeants, and servants, and De Tores likewise sends the page and his coachman searching and scouring all over the adjacent fields to apprehend and bring before them all those whom they finde there; who are so far from meeting of many persons, as they all of them bring in but one poore ragged boy (of some twelve or fourteene yeares old) who some two hundred paces off, kept a few cowes (which yeelded milke to the cittie) and him they find sitting within a hedge in a ditch whom they bring along with them to the judges, where hee sees this dead body lying on the ground before them, whereat poore silly boy hee shakes and trembles for feare. The judges demand his name of him, who tels them hee is called Bartholomeo Spondy , they further enquire of him what his father is, and where hee dwels, who replies that his father is a poore butcher named Pedro Spondy , and dwels at Naples in Saint Iohns suburb (which the judges afterwards find true) then these grave judges perceiving the poore boy to be bashfull and timorous, they therefore bid him bee of good cheere, and to feare nothing, for the which hee thankes them both with his cap and knee. Then they enquire of him if hee saw any one to come neere and kill this gentleman, to whom in plaine and rusticke tearmes he answereth them, that from the hedge within wch he kept his fathers cowes, he saw this gentleman walke alone by himselfe at least an houre with a booke in his hand reading, and that then hee saw an old frier come to him, who as hee thought begged some almes of him, whom hee saw did shoore off two pistolls to him, and therewith kild him, for hee then, and thereupon presently saw the gentleman fall to the ground, they againe demaund of him what afterwards became of this frier, who tells the judges, that a coach came up instantly to him and carried him away, but where hee knowes not. They aske of him why hee had not cryed out against the frier, when hee saw hee had kild this gentleman, to whom hee makes answer that he dared not doe it, for feare lest hee would then likewise have killed him with his pistolls. The judges further demaund of him, whether this were a white, a blacke or a gray frier, to whom hee answers that hee was neither of them, but that hee wore a minime, or sad russet gowne and hood. Thereupon they thought it fit, againe to demand of him how many horses this coach had, and of what collour they were, to whom hee affirmes that they were two blacke coach-horses, when the judges to conclude this their qu aere and his examination, they demand of him what colloured cloake this coachman wore, who tells them hee wore a red cloake, and as he thought some white laces upon it, the which this pregnant poore little boy Bartholomeo had no sooner pronounced and spoken, but Sanctifiores page Hieronymo cries out and relates to the judges, to his Lady Bertranna , and her father Seignior de Tores , where and in what manner and accident he some two houres since found the Lady Vrsina , and her coachman Sebastiano , whom hee seriously affirmed wore a red cloake with white laces, and that her two coach- horses which they saw straying below in the valley were coale blacke, right as Bartholomeo had described them; adding further that her coach was broken with a fall, as also her right arme and his left legge, and that out of respect and pittie to her, hee had carried both her, and him, home to her father Seignior Placedo's house, but hee affirmed hee saw no frier either in their sight or company, all which relation of his, was likewise there confirmed to the judges by the Baron of Sanctifiores owne coachman, who was also there present, the which evidence of theirs as soone as the Lady Bertranna over heard, shee with a world of sighes and teares, (as if shee were suddainely inspired and prompted from heaven) passionately cries out first to her father, and then to the judges, that God and her conscience told her, that doubtlesse Vrsina was this divlish frier, and her coachman Sebastiano the very same damnable fellow who had here thus cruelly murthered her Lord and husband, when throwing her selfe on her knees to their feet, shee very earnestly begs justice of them, against them for the same, who partly concurring in the opinion and beleefe with them, they doe here most seriously and solemnly promise it her. To which effect, these reverend judges, leaving her father, her selfe, and her page and coachman decently to convey her husbands dead body home to their house in Naples, they themselves make great hast thither before, and presently send their officers and sergeants to Seignior Placedo's house, there to apprehend the Lady Vrsina his daughter, and their coachman Sebastiano , whom they both opportunly finde issuing forth his gate in a fresh hackney coach speedily flying to Putzeole to her aunt Mellefunta for protection and Sanctuary, so these fierce and mercilesse sergeants doe presently divert and alter their course, yea they furiously and suddainely rush upon them, apprehend and constitute them close prisoners in the common goale of that cittie, placing them in two severall chambers, to the end they should not prattle or tell tales each to other; where they shall finde more leasure than time, both to remember what they have done, and likewise to know what hereafter they must doe. Whiles thus all Naples generally resound and talke of this mournfull fact, and deplorable accident, and Seignior Placedo particularly grieves at these his daughters unexpected crosses and calamities, as also of those of his coachman Sebastiano , the which hee feares, hee can far sooner lament than remedy; our sorrowfull widdow Bertranna (with the assistance of her father De Tores ) gives her husband the Baron of Sanctifiore a solemne and stately buriall in the Fueillantes Church of Naples, correspondant to his noble degree and qualitie. And then within two daies after, at her earnest and passionate solicitation to the judges; Vrsina and her coachman Sebastiano are severally convented before them, in their chiefe Forum, (or tribunall) of justice, and there strongly accused by her and charged to bee the authors and actors of this cruell murther, committed on the person of the Baron of Sanctifiore her husband, the which both of them doe stoutly deny with much vehemency and confidence, and when the little boy Bartholomeo , is face to face called into the court to give in evidence against them, hee there maintaines to the judges what hee had formerly deposed to them in the fields, but saies hee thinks not, that this Lady was that frier, nor can hee truly say that this was the coachman who carried him, although when his cloake was shewed him hee could not deny but it was verie like it; but Bertranna having now secretly intimated and made knowen to the judges, all the passages that had formerly past betweene Vrsina and her husband Sanctifiore , as his getting of her with child, and then (contrarie to his promise) refusing to marry her, they doe therefore more than halfe beleeve, that it was her discontent which drew her to this choler, her choler to this revenge, and her revenge to this murthering of him, as also (that in favour of some gold) shee had likewise seduced and drawen her coachman Sebastiano to bee consenting and accessary herein with her: whereupon the next day they will begin with him, and so they adjudge him to the racke, the torments whereof hee endures with a wonderfull fortitude and patience, so that (remembring his oath of secrecy to his Lady Vrsina ) hee cannot thereby bee drawen to confesse anything, but denies all, whereof shee having secret notice, doth not a little rejoyce and insult thereat, now the very next ensueing morning Vrsina her selfe, is likewise adjudged and exposed to the racke, the wrenches and torments whereof, as soone as shee sensibly feeles, God proves then so propitious and mercifull to her soule, that her dainty body, and tender limbes cannot possibly endure or suffer it, but then and there shee to her judges and tormentors, confesseth herselfe to bee the sole author and actor of pistolling to death the Baron of Sanctifiore , in the same manner and forme, as wee have already understood in all its circumstances, but in her heart and soule shee strongly affirmes to them that her coachman Sebastiano was not accessary with her herein, upon which apparent and palpable confession of hers, her judges (in honour to sacred justice, and for expiation of this her foule crime) doe pronounce sentence of death against her, that shee shall the next morning bee hanged at the place of common execution, notwithstanding all the power and teares of her father, and kinsfolkes to the contrary. So she is returned to her prison where her father (not being permitted to see her that night) sends her two Nuns, and two friers to prepare and direct her soule for heaven, whom in a little time (through Gods great mercy, and their owne pious perswasions) they found to bee wounderfull humble, repentant, and sorrowfull. She privately sends word to her coachman Sebastiano , that shee is thankfull to him for his respect and fidelity to her on the racke, and wills him to bee assured and confident, that shee being to die to morrow, her speech at her death, shall no way prejudice, but strongly confirme the safety and preservation of his life. Thus grieving far more at the foulnes of her crime than at the infamy and severity of her punishment, shee spends most part of the night, and the first part of the morning in godly praiers and religious meditations, and ejaculations, when, although her sorrowfull old father Seignior Placedo (by his noble kinsman the Prince of Salerno) made offer to the Viceroy (the Duke of ossuna) the free gift of all his lands to save this his daughters life, yet the strong solicitation of the first; and the great proffer of the last proved vaine, and fruitlesse, for they found it wholly impossible to obtaine it. So about ten of the clocke in the morning, our sorrowfull Vrsina , is (betweene two Nuns) brought to her execution; clad in a blacke wrought velvet gowne, a greene sattin petticoate, agreat laced ruffe, her head dressed up with tuffes and roses of greene ribbon, with some artificiall flowers, all covered over with a white ciffres vaile, and a paire of plaine white gloves on her hands: when ascending the ladder, shee, to the great confluence of people who came thither to see her take her last farwell of this life, and this world, (with a mournfull countenance, and low voice) delivered them this sorrowfull and religious speech. Good people, I want words to expresse the griefe of my heart, and the anxiety and sorrow of my soule, for imbruing my hands in the innocent blood and death of the Baron of Sanctifiore , although not to dissemble but to confesse the pure truth, hee betraied his promise to mee of marriage, and mee of my honour and chastity without it, whereof I beseech Almighty God, that all men (of what degree or qualitie soever) may hereafter bee warned by his example, and all Ladies and gentlewomen deterred and terrified by mine. I doe likewise here confesse to heaven and earth, to God and his Angells, and to you all who are here present, that I alone was both the author and actor of this foule murther, and that my coachman Sebastiano , is no way consenting or accessary with mee herein, and that albeit I once promised and proffered him a hundred double pistolls of Spanish gold to performe it, yet hee honestly and religiously refused both me and it, and strongly and pathetically disswaded me from it, whose good, and wholesome councell I now wish to God (from the depth and center of my soule) I had then followed, for then I had lived as happie, as now I die miserable. And because it is now no time, but bootlesse for mee either to paliate the truth, or to flatter with God, or man, the worst of his crime he being my servant was the least courtesie hee owed to mee I being his mistris, which (after with mine owne hands I had committed that deplorable fact) was to bring mee home from the fields to my fathers house, and for assisting mee to cast the friers frocke, the false beard and haire, the almes box, breviary, and two pistolls, into the next deepe pit, or precipice thereunto adjoining, where (as yet) they still lie: for this my heinous offence, (the very remembrance whereof is now grievous and odious unto mee) I aske pardon first of God, then of mine owne deare father, and next of the Lady Bertranna , and if the words and prayers, of a poore dying gentlewoman have any power with the living, then I beseech you all in generall, and every one of you in particular, to pray unto God, that hee will now forgive my sinnes in his favour, and hereafter save my soule in his mercy, the which as soone as shee had said, and uttered some few short prayers to her selfe, shee (often making the signe of the crosse) takes leave of all the world when pulling downe her vaile (in comly sort) over her eies and face, and erecting her hands towards heaven shee was turned over, now as some of her spectators rejoyced at the death of so cruell and bloody or female monster, so the greatest part of them (in favour of her birth youth and beautie) did with a world of teares exceedingly lament and pittie her, but all of them doe highly detest and execrate the base ingratitude infidelity and treachery of this ignoble Baron of Sanctifiore towards her, which no doubt was the prime cause, and cheifest motive which drew her to these deplorable and bloody resolutions. As for her honest coachman Sebastiano ; although his owne torments on the racke, and now this solemne confession of his Lady Vrsina at her death had sufficiently proclaimed and vindicated his innocency in this murther of Sanctifiore ; yet such was his widdow Bertrannas living affection to her dead husband and her deadly malice to living Sebastiano , for thinking him to bee guiltie, and accessary hereunto with his Lady Vrsina , that her power and malice so far prevailed with the integrity of the judges, for the further disquisition of this truth, as they now againe sentence him to the double torments of the racke, the which hee againe likewise endureth with a most unparalleld patience and constancy, without confessing any thing, the which his judges wondering to see, and admiring to understand, and having no substantiall proofes or reall and valable evidences against him, they now fully absolve and acquit him of this his suspected crime, when being moved in charity justice and conscience to yeeld him some reward, and satisfaction, for thus enfeebling his body, and impairing of his health by these his sharpe and bitter torments, they therefore adjudge the plaintiffe widdow Bertranna to give him three hundred duckatons, whereof shee cannot possibly exempt or excuse her selfe. And thus lived and died our unkind Baron Sanctifiore , and our cruell hearted young Lady Vrsina , and in this manner did the sacred justice of God requite the one and condignly revenge and punish the other. Now by reading this their history, may God (of his best favour and mercy) teach us all, from our hearts to hate this Barons levitie, and from our soules to abhorre and detest this Ladies cruelty and impiety. AMEN. GODS REVENGE AGAINST THE CRYING AND Execrable Sinne of Murther. History XXX.  De Mora treacherously kills Palura in a duell with two pistolls. His Lady Bellinda with the aid of her gentleman usher Ferallo , poysoneth her husband De Mora , and afterwards shee marrieth and then murthereth her said husband Ferallo in his bed, so shee is burnt alive for this her last murther, and her ashes throwen into the aire for the first.  sinfull soules are so transported by Sathan and their owne outragious passions, to imbrue their guilty hands in the innocent blood of their christian brethren; and it were a great happines and felicity to most countries and kingdomes of Europe, if they were not sometimes infected with the contagion of this bloody and crying sinne, which with a presumptuous hand seemes to strike at the majestie of God himselfe in killing man his creature, but because wishes availe little, and for that examples are more powerfull and prevalent, and prove the best precepts to the living; therefore I here produce a lamentable one of so inhumane a condition, that by the knowledge and consideration thereof wee may know how to detest the like, and avoid the temptations in our selves. Stremos, one of the sweetest and fairest cities thereof, there (within these few yeares) dwelt a noble gentleman of some fifty six yeares old, named Don Alonso De Mora , Issued and discended from one of the best and famous houses of that kingdome, as being Nephew to that great and wise Don Christopher de Mora , of whom the histories of Spaine and Portugall make so often, and so honourable mention, and although hee were by his ancestors and parents, left very rich in lands and possessions; yet his ambition and generosity caried him to serve his king Phillip third of Spaine, in his warres of Africa and Flanders, wherein hee spent the greatest part of his time, and of himselfe, wonne many renowned laurells, and martiall trophees of honour, and as an excellent cavalier left behinde him many approved markes and testimonies of his true valour, and magnanimity. But (as all men are naturally constant in unconstancy; and subject and co-incident to mutations, and that the world still delights to please us with changes, and to feed our fancies and affections with different enterprises and resolutions) so our De Mora at last, calls home his thoughts and himselfe from warre to peace, and resolves to spend the remainder of his age in as much ease  & pleasure as formerly hee had done the heate and strength of his youth, in tumults and combustions; hee now sees that there is no life nor pleasure comparable to that of the country, for here the sweetnesse of the imbalmed aire, the delicacy of the perfumed and enamelled fields, the unparalleld pastime of hauking and hunting, and the free and uninterrupted accesse which wee have to arts in our study, and to God in religious praiers and meditations, makes it to bee, no lesse than either an earthly paradise, or a heaven upon earth. For the campe (despite of commanders) abounds with all kinds of insolencies and impieties, the cittie, (despite of magistrates with all sorts of vice, deceit, covetousnes and pride, and the court (despite of good kings and Princes) too often with variety of hippocrisie, perfidiousnes, and vanity. To his owne great mannor house neere Stremos, therefore is our De Mora retired, with a resolution for ever, there to erect and build up his residence, making it his greatest delight to have his hounds and graihounds at his heeles, and to see his hauke on his fist. Now the Alarums of warre no longer take up his thoughts and time; neither doe the drums and trumpets, or the ratling peales of thunder of muskets and cannons, distract his day pleasures, or cut his nights sweet sleepes and slumbers in peeces. Hee is not addicted to women, but hates them as much as they love men, hee spurnes at love, and (in a disdainfull contempt thereof) tearms venus a whore, and her sonne cupid a boy, and which is worse a bastard, in a word, hee professeth himselfe to be as great, and as mortall an enemy to beauty, as beauty is many times to chastity, and never thinks himselfe happie, but either when hee is out of womens company or they not in his. Hee is so far from any affecting marriage, as hee pittieth it in others, and foreuer abjures and detests it in himselfe. Hee compares single life to roses and lilies, and wedlocke to briars and thistles, and therefore in the highest and sublimest degree, scornes to have any wife or mistris in his house to over master him. But it is not for men to presume to point out their owne destinies and fortunes, sith wee are but the slaves of time, as time is the servant of God; and therefore (in this regard) our actions are subject to heaven not to earth, & to Gods appointment rather than our purposes; or to presupose or think the contrary, is a presumption every way unworthy of a man, but far more of a christian, sith nature is subject to grace, and our earthly passions and resolutions must still stoope to a sacred power, and ever submit and prostrate themselves to a divine providence, and supernaturall predominancy, it is therefore follie not wisdome, and simplicitie; not discretion in De Mora generally to proclaime hate to women, for that hee is the sonne of a woman; or to maligne and disdaine marriage in regard hee is the fruit and off-spring of marriage for thus to violate and pull downe the temples and alters of love, is obstinatlie to oppose nature, and prophanely to subvert the institution of God himselfe in paradice; but hee shall not continue long in the clouds of this errour. In a cleere and sweete morning (as soone as Aurora lept from the watry bed of Thetis , and purposely retired her selfe to give way to approaching Phoebus , (who in his fiery chariot, with his glistering beams began to salute  & guild the tops of the highest woods & mountaines) De Mora attended by halfe a dozen of his domesticke servants goes into the fields to hauke and hunt, where having kild one hare, and set up another, all his servants left him alone, and with the hounds pursue the hare, who tripping through the launes and thickets, the hills and valleies, at last leads them such a dance, that in lesse than an houre his servants and his doggs were a little league out of his sight, whereat being exceedingly offended and angrie, and far the more for that hee was left all alone, hee not knowing how to passe or delude away the tediousnes of the time, sate himselfe downe on the side of a faire hill, at the foot of a pleasant grove of beech and chesnut trees, whose curled tops sheltred him from the scorching raies of the sonne, and there takes delight to behold how many frequent windings, and turning meanders, the neighbouring chrystall river made in that pleasant valley, as also to see how sweetly the troops of snow-white feathered swans, proudly ruffled their plumes, and disported themselves therein, in their majesticall and stately bravery,  & how many malitious Fowlers, both in boates and on the banks of that sweet river were curiously watching with their fierie peeces to murther these innocent watry guests who frequented there, and also how the patient Anglers (with their treacherous hookes and baits) betraied many harmelesse fishes to their undeserved deaths. When De Mora (impatient of his solitarines) listning with his eare, if hee might either heare the loud crie and voices of his hounds, or else the shrill rebounding ecchoes of his servants hunting hornes, hee looking up towards the skie, beheld a heron softlie soaring, and proudly hoovering over his head, as if she came purposely to bid defiance to De Mora , and his goshauke which hee held on his fist, and consequently to dare, and challenge it to an airie combat; whereat De Mora being exceeding glad, and disdaining that his hauke and himselfe, should be thus outbraved by so ill shaped and unmannerly a sea fowle; hee speedily riseth up, and (betwixt choler and pleasure) lets flie his hauke at her; but the heron stretcheth her pinnions, and packs on her feathered sailes so nimbly and proudly, that sometimes soaring aloft in the aire, sometimes descending, and still looking backe with scorne on the goshauke, as if shee purposely tooke delight and sport, to see what infinite toile and paine this malitious and ravenous hauke tooke to surprise and devour her, so the swifter the heron flew from the hauke, the swifter the hauke redoubled her flight, and tugged away after her, when it being impossible for De Mora to reclaime his hauke, either with his hola's or lure, at last both hauke and heron flew quite out of his sight, and which is worse hee was so unfortunate, as never after hee could see either of them againe. De Mora being first highly displeased and offended for the absence of his servants and hounds, hee is now doubly inraged with griefe and choler for the losse of his goshauke, and therefore curseth the heron for thus seducing and betraying her away from him; when wearying himselfe to run from hill to vale to have newes of her, and in the end seeing both his labour and his hauke lost, hee betakes himselfe to the aforesaid grove, and (with much discontent and choler) first casting his hat and lure to the ground, hee then likewise casts himselfe thereon to repose him; still attending and expecting his hunters. Hee hath not remained there above halfe an houre, but close by him passeth an aged country gentleman, indifferently well apparalled, with a very beautifull young gentlewoman following him, clad in a crimson taffeta peticoate  & wastcoate trimmed with silver lace, with a large cut worke plaine band, her flaxen haire adorned with many knots of white & crimson ribbon, covered with a black ciffres vaile, having a roling amarous eye, (the true index of desire and lust) her snow white panting breasts open, but only a little hidden and overvailed with curious tiffney, whose white puritie her pure white paps (enterveined with azure) infinitely outbraved and excelled. She had her waiting maid attending on her, and hee a serving-man bearing his cloake and rapier after him, who that morning were come some three leagues from his owne house to take the fresh aire in that pleasant and delitious grove, without the hedge whereof hee had left his coach, this countrie gentleman I say, passing by De Mora , and well and perfectly knowing him, hee according to his dutie and the others merrits, respectfully saluted him by his name, and the young gentlewoman who followed him likewise gives him a very lowe and gracefull courtesie. De Mora , surprised with the suddainesse of their arrivall, and the sweetnes of these their salutations, riseth up, and having first saluted him, and kissed her; hee praies his name, who tells him that hee is a gentleman that dwelt some three leagues off, tearmed Emanuell de Cursoro: De Mora demaunds of him if this young gentlewoman bee his kinswoman or his daughter, who tells him shee is his daughter; when De Mora againe inquires of him, if she bee married or no, and what age and name shee is of, Cursoro replies that shee is unmaried of some twentie yeares of age, and her name Bellinda. De Mora againe tells him, that hee is verie happie in having so sweet and faire a young gentlewoman to his daughter, whereat the father smileth for joy, and the daughter blusheth for bashfullnes and modestie. De mora againe questioneth Cursoro , if any busines brought him thither that morning, who tells him hee had no busines, but only came thither with his daughter to take the aire, and that hee had left his coach without the hedge, so they walke together some turnes in this pleasant grove, and from thenceforth De Mora could not possibly refraine, from gadding and gazing his inamoured eyes on the roses and lilies of Bellindas sweet and delicate beautie, when De Mora acquaints Cursoro with his misfortunes, how that morning hee came forth a hunting, that hee had lost his men, his hounds, and his hauke, and that this three houres hee was there left alone and had no newes of them, they together make many walkes, turnes, and returnes, when De Mora led by the lustre of Bellindas lovely atractive, and rolling eye, hee ever and anon proffereth to lead and conduct her by the arme, the which Cursoro modestly, and respectfully excuseth, as holding it too great an honour for De Mora to give, and his daughter to receive: here Cursoro proferreth De Mora to lend him his coach to carry him home to his house, but De Mora freely and thankfully refuseth it, and in counterexchange of this courtesie proferreth Cursoro and his daughter to accompany and conduct them to their coach, the which undeserved kindnes, Cursoro modestly refuseth of him. Thus (in point of honour, and courtesie) they along time stand striving and complementing, till at last De Mora heareing the crie of his hounds, his importunitie vanquisheth Cursoro's modestie, and so will, or nill, hee conducts him to his coach, and likewise leads his daughter Bellinda by the arme and hand, and by the way doth at least usurpe,  & steale many amorous kisses from the cheries of her sweet lips, and damaske roses of her pure and delicate cheekes, wherat shee is more admired then pleased. As they are thus going towards Cursoro's coach, De Mora's hounds and servants arive all sweating and blowing, who (in redemption and requitall of their long stay) doe present their Lord and master with a brace of hares, and a wild white fawne which they had kild, whereof hee being exceeding glad, hee very joyfully bestowes the hares on Cursoro , and the white fawne on his faire daughter Bellinda , who from thenceforth, hee swears shall bee his mistris, and his love; Cursoro , is too modest, and his daughter too bashfull to accept hereof, so they along time refuse these his presents with many dilatory and complementall excuses. But at last De Mora finds out a means and medium to reconcile this difference, according to his owne will and desire; for hee peremptorily swears to Cursoro , and his daughter Bellinda , that they shall receive these poore presents from him, and that in requitall hereof, hee will to morrow come over to his house, and eat his part of them to dinner with them; upon which condition and tearms, Cursoro thankfully receives the hares, and likewise causeth his daughter to doe the same by the fawne, the which (with a verie low and observant courtesie) she doth: so he conducts them on to their coach, and by the way wrings her by her lilie white hand, plaies with the loose tresses of her sweet haire, her blushing cheeks, dimpled chinne, downie paps; and Alabaster necke, when taking a friendly leave of Cursoro , and a solemne conge of his faire daughter Bellinda , which hee againe seales and confirmes with many new kisses, they take coach and away; and De Mora with his servants and hounds returnes home to his house. Thus in a little time wee see an extraordinary alteration, yea a wonderfull change and metamorphosis in De Mora , but whether more strange or suddaine I know not, for in the morning hee went forth a free man, and now before night comes home a slave, and a captive. Heretofore hee spurned at love, and disdained beauty, and now the verie first sight of our faire Bellinda sets fire to his blood, and flames to his heart: so that his old blood is passionatly and amorously inflamed with this new beautie; formerly hee (in derision) tearmed Cupid , a little boy, now hee holds him to bee a great God; then hee called Venus a whore, but now hee recants that Athiesme, and repents himselfe of that blasphemy vomited forth against her diety; and tearmes her a Celestiall and sacred Goddesse: yea now in his heart and thoughts hee erects altars to the first, and consecrates all his vowes to the second. The small and streight wast of his honoured Bellinda , together with her sparkling eyes, and sweet cheekes and blushes, doe amaze his mind, act wonders in his heart, and cast his thoughts into a confusion of many amorous raptures and extasies, yea the consideration of her sweet youth, and the remembrance of her fresh and delicate beauty, doe (in his conceit) seeme to make his age young, and to give the lye to those infinite number of white haires, which time hath snowed on his head, and showred on his beard. Hee a thousand times repents himselfe of his former errour and crime in living so long single and is now assured and confident, that there is no earthly pleasure or heavenly delight, comparable to the heart-ravishing kisses and embraces of his sweet Bellinda : hee is readie to lay downe all his lands, and life at the feet of her commands and service, and esteemes both of them too poore, for the purchasing of so inestimable a jewell; whom (in his determinations and resolutions) hee hath alreadie adopted the Queene of his heart, and confirmed and crowned the Soveraigne Empresse of his soule, and the sacred Goddesse of his desires and affections. Hee thinks not of the great disparity and Antithesis betwixt his declining age, and her fragrant and flourishing youth; nor what an unequall difference, and disproportion there is betwixt his fiftie six, and her twentie yeares. Hee will not consider what a poore simpathie and a palpable antipathy there is betweene such a Ianuarie and such a May, but disdaines to enter into consideration with himselfe, that hee is every way fitter for his grave than for her bed, and for death than marriage; yea hee flatters himselfe so far in his affection to her, as hee hopes hee shall bee the joyfull father of many prettie children by her, so that hee is so deeply enamoured with the sweet youth of our Bellinda , and his heart so fast chained and intangled in the tresses of her haire, and the lures of her alluring beautie, that hee upon his first sight of her incessantly thinkes of her by day, dreams of her by night, and neither thinks nor dreams of any thing but of her, and of his love to her: so now he advanceth  & raiseth the standards of Venus and Cupid , as high as ever he formerly dejected them, and delights in nothing more, yea I may truly say in nothing els, but in feasting his eyes and surfeting his heart upon the heavenly Idoea of her Angelicall face and feature, hee thinkes so much of love, as if he were now wholly composed of love, and therefore purposely made to love Bellinda , and none but Bellinda . His hauks, and hounds are now as far out of his mind, as he is out of himselfe; and no other delight or recreation whatsoever can take up any place in his heart or thoughts, because love had already tane up all. Hee revokes to mind, how Macareus was transformed into a bird for speaking against Venus , and that it is not his cause alone to bee so deeply plunged  & tormented in love, but that the greatest Captaines Philosophers, and Kings of the world, (and as poets affirme the Gods themselves) have beene subjected, and vanquished with this passion, and so constrained to make it their chiefest delight and glory to adorne the temples and altars of Cupid , with the oblations of their sighes, and the sacrifices of their teares. Thus our De Mora being (at the first sight) wholly inflamed with love towards his faire, and beautifull intended mistris Bellinda , hee to seeme far younger than hee is, hee is so vaine in his affection, as (contrary to his custome) hee shaves his beard, dights himselfe in an ash-collour sattin suit and cloake, with a white Beaver hat, a hat-band of Diamonds, a rich plaine cutworke band, and a paire of greene silke stockings with garters  & roses laced with silver, sutable thereunto, and so to performe his promise to Cursoro , takes coach the next morning, and rides over to him, but not so much to tast of his good cheere, as to feast his enamoured eyes on the dilicious rarities and dainties of his daughter Bellinda's beautie; where he finds his entertainment and good cheere, at least to equalize, if not to exceed his birth, rancke, and expectation: but this is not the end, and object of his visit, not the summe and period of his desires; dinner being ended, hee acquaints Cursoro with his affection to his daughter Bellinda , and his suit to seeke and obtaine her for his wife. Cursoro wonders that so great a Lord should descend so low from himselfe to seeke so meane a young Gentlewoman as his daughter in marriage. But finding De Mora to bee in earnest, and not in jeast, and understanding that his age was deeply  & passionatly enamoured of her youth and beautie, hee therefore thankes him for that undeserved honour of his, promiseth him his best assistance towards his daughter, and gives him no dispaire, but all hope and assurance that hee shall shortly obtaine and injoy her to his wife. De Mora having thus wonne the affection and consent of the father, hee now seeks that of the daughter, hee takes her apart in his parlour, where, of an old man hee plaies the young oratour and lover, and in sweet tearms and sugred phrases and speeches seeke to gaine her to his wife; but Bellinda more considering De Mora his age, than the greatnes of his nobilitie or estate, shee bites the lip, and hangs the head at this his motion, yea, and seemes to be as a verse as hee was forward in this his research and pursuit. Her father laies his commands on her to embrace this match and no other, hee conjures her new to confirme, and not to cast away her good fortunes in marrying this great Nobleman; and vowes that hee will for ever renounce her for his daughter, if shee disobey him herein; so hee conducts her into the arbour of his garden, and these freely and courteously againe gives De Mora the opportunitie and benefit to speake with her, and the desired happines to kisse her; but Bellinda is as much perplexed in mind, as they are obstinate in their motion towards her; when (composing, her countenance rather to sorrow than joy, and to mourning than mirch) she makes a modest excuse to her father, gives no absolute or peremptorie deniall to De Mora , but fairly and discreetly craves of both of them a moneths time of respite to resolve on this great busines, which shee saies, so much imports her happines or her misery, her content or her affliction, which answer and request of hers, both her father and De Mora finding so full of discretion and reason, they severally grant and jointly consent to give her; but in all this interim, such was De Mora's deare and tender affection to Bellinda , that hee visits her many times in person; and verie often with his rich gifts and presents, as holding it no irregular way, but a pertinent and prevalent course, first to make a breach in a young Ladies mind and affection, and then to enter and take possession, both of her body, and of her selfe. But before I proceed further in the narration and progresse of this history, I must here unlocke and reveale a secret mystery to the reader of no small consequence and importance, for he must understand, that our Bellinda is not so chaste as faire, nor so honest, as her education, youth  & beautie presuppose and promise her to bee; for her mother being dead, and her father giving her too much libertie, and too little vertuous counsell and exhortation, shee for two whole yeares hath beene in love with a poore, yet with a verie proper and resolute young Gentleman of some twentie five yeares of age, being a neighbour of her fathers, named Don Fernando Palura , who being deeply enamoured of her, had laine so close, so constant and so strong a siege to her chastitie, as (not to conceale the truth) first unknowne to her father, then to De Mora , and next to all the world, hee had unparadised her of her maiden-head, and under colour and hope of marriage had verie often tane his lustfull use and pleasure of her body; but his means being verie small, and her belly not growing great, shee was not yet fully resolved, but therefore still delaied to marrie him; true it is, that her father Cursoro was formerly acquainted with Palura's affection and desire to marry his daughter, but as heretofore his poverty made him reject him for his sonne in law, so now the consideration of De Mora's great wealth and nobilitie makes him fully to disdaine him, and commands his daughter likewise to doe the same. But shee not considering the premises, and loving Palura's youth, as much as shee hated De Mora's age, shee was neverthelesse so inconstant by nature, and so proud and ambitious by sex, as she could find in her heart and resolution, rather to bee a rich Lady, than a poore Gentlewoman, and so to leave Palura to espouse and marrie De Mora : but first her crime  & her conscience makes her send for Palura , and seriously to consider and debate hereon with him, which they doe; so Palura perceiving by Bellindas lookes, and observing by her speeches that De Mora's wealth was far more powerfull with her than his poverty; and that shee notwithstanding still aimed to keepe him for her husband, and himselfe for her friend, hee at last tells her, that hee will consent and content himselfe that shee shall marry Don Alonso De Mora , conditionally, that shee will first faithfully promise him to grant and performe him three requests, and articles. So shee bids him propose them to her, the which hee doth to this effect: First, that hee shall still have the use and pleasure of her body, as heretofore, and as often as hee pleaseth: secondly, that from time to time she shall bestow some competency of De Moras wealth on him, to support his weake estate and poverty: and thirdly, that if De Mora die before him, that within thee moneths after his death shee shall then marry him. Which three unjust demands, and ungodly conditions of Palura's , his sweet heart Bellinda (betwixt sighes and smiles) immediatly grants him, yea shee feales them with many oathes, and confirmes them with a world of kisses, and to adde the more pietie, (I may truly say the more prophanesse) to this their contract and attonement, they fall to the ground on their knees, and invoking God and his Angels for witnesses hereof, they with their hands and kisses, againe ratifie and confirme it: but poore sinfull soules, how doth Sathan abuse you, and your intemperate and lascivious lusts betray you? for God will not be mocked, and his holy Angels cannot be deluded by these your blasphemies and impieties, for you shall in the end see with griefe, and feele with repentance, that this vicious league, and obscoene contract of yours; will produce you nothing but shame, misery, and confusion of all sides. By this time is Bellinda's moneth expired, which shee gave her father and De Mora for her resolution of marriage; and now doe they both of them repaire to her to understand and receive it, when her pride and ambition, having far more prepared and disposed her tongue, than her affection, shee (as if shee were a pure Virgin , yea a Diana for chastitie) making a low reverence to her father, and a great respectfull courtesie to De Mora , delivers her resolution to them in these tearmes: that in humble obedience to her father, and true affection and zeale to Don Alonso De Mora , God hath now so disposed her heart and mind, that shee is resolved to wait on his commands, and to bee his hand-maid and wife, whensoever hee shall please to make himselfe her Lord and husband. This answer of Bellinda is so pleasing to her father, and so sweet and delicious to De Mora , that in acceptance of her love, and requitall of her consent, hee gives her many kisses, and then claps a great chaine of pearle, enterlaced with sparkes of Diamonds, about her necke, and an exceeding rich Diamond ring on her finger, and so most solemnly contracts himselfe to her, and within eight daies after in great pompe, state & braverie marries her, whereat his kinsfolkes and friends, and all the nobilitie and gentrie of these parts doe very much admire and wonder, some condemning his folly in marrying so poore and so young a gentlewoman, others praising and applauding her good fortune in matching with so rich and so great a Nobleman. Here wee see the marriage of De Mora , and Bellinda , but wee shall not goe far before wee see what sharpe and bitter sweet fruits it produceth: for here truth gives a law to my will, and so commands mee to relate and discover, that hee is too old for her youth, and shee too young for his age, yea here I must crave excuse of modestie to affirme, that shee is so immodest, as shee finds him not to bee so bold and brave a cavallier as shee expected, in regard his best performance to her consists only in desire. Thus being in bed together, whiles hee turnes to his rest, so doth shee to her repentance, but shee knowes how to repaire and remedy this her misfortune; for whiles her husband De Mora only kisseth her, shee in her heart and mind, kisseth and embraceth her young and sweet Palura , who many times comes over in shew to visit her husband but in affect to see her, and as formerly, so now hee lasciviously dispose and wantonize with her, and (in a word) very often performes and acts that part of love to her, which her old husband cannot. Now within lesse than two moneths of their marriage, De Mora seeing that hee is not capable to deserve, much lesse to reward and requite the dainties of his wives youth and beautie) and observing all that by degrees shee begins to disrespect and sleight him, and yet that shee is verie pleasing and pleasant to all gentlemen who aboord and frequent his house, as first he doted on her, now hee growes jealous of her, and so far forgets his discretion and himselfe, that he curseth all those who (in right of the lawes of hospitality, civility and honour) come to kisse her, but more especially Palura , who he sees is so often at his house; and so frequently conversing with his young Lady, as at last his suspition makes him jealous, and his jealousie confident, that (with too much libertie and dishonestie) he usurps upon his free hold,  & dishonoureth him in the dishonouring his bed, and defiling his wife; the which to discover, hee begins to restraine her of her libertie; so that she sees (and grieves to see) her selfe to be in a manner as much her husbands prisoner, as his wife, yea hee sets many eyes over her, as so many Sentinells to watch her and her actions, and for himselfe, his jealousie gives him more eyes than ever Argus had, to espie out what familiaritie past betweene her and her sweet heart Palura. Bellinda takes this discourtesie and hard measure of her husband in verie ill part at his hands, yea she bites the lip thereat, and though outwardly shee seeme to grieve and sorrow, yet inwardly shee owes to requite and revenge it; he is so jealous of her, and so fearefull that she plaies false play with him, that as soone as ever Palura comes to his house, hee carries his eye and eare everie where to see if hee can espie and hearken out, his and his wives love trickes together; yea hee is so curious in this quest, and so vigilant and turbulent on this his research and disquisition, as if hee delighted to know that, whereof it were his happines to be ignorant, or as if hee had an itching desire to make his glory prove his shame, and his content his affliction and miserie. But as mild and sweet perswasion is ever more capable and powerfull to prevaile with women than constraint; so our suite Bellinda is so distasted with the lunacy, and with the phrensie and madnes of this her husbands jealousie, that shee no sooner sees her Palura arive in her sight and presence, but (despite of his suspition and feare) shee is so obscene in her lust, and so lascivious in benefaction towards him, that she takes pleasure to seeke pleasure, and extremely delighteth to seeke and find delight with him, which (according to her former lewd promise and ungodly contract) shee often doth. Now this foolish young couple (being the obliged scholers of Cupid , and the devoted votaries of Venus ) thinke to bee as wise, as they are lascivious in these their amorous pleasures, for knowing that discretion makes lovers happie, and that secrecie is the true touch-stone, yea the verie life and soule of love, they therefore esteeme and keepe the secrets thereof as if they were sacred, and thinke that no mortall eyes but their owne can see or know it: but yet notwithstanding all this, De Mora's jealous feares in the detection, are still as great as their care in the prevention thereof, for the very next night after Paluras departure from his house, hee purposely absenteth and excludeth his wife from his bed, and the next morning; calling her into the garden after him, and causing the doore to bee shut; he then and there, (with lighthing in his lookes and thunder in his speeches) chargeth her of adulterie with Palura . But this young strumpet his wife Bellinda , at the verie first hearing of this sad and unexpected newes, dissembles so artificially with her husband, and so prophanely with God, as seeming to dissolve and melt into teares, shee purgeth her selfe hereof, with many strong vowes,  & cleereth Palura with many deepe asseverations. But this fanaticke Tyrant, and franticke monster jealousie, (which for the most part, wee can seldome or never kill, before it kill us) had wrought such strange impressions in the braines,  & ingraven such extravagant chimoera's in the heart and beleefe of old De Mora , that (notwithstanding his wives oathes and teares to the contrary) hee yet still vowes to himselfe, and her, that shee is guiltie of adulterie with Palura , and therefore chargeth her that henceforth shee dare not see him, or receive him into her house or companie. Bellinda hereat (to give her husband some content in her owne discontent) makes a great shew of sorrow, and an extreme apparition and exteriour apparance of griefe: she sends for her father Cursoro , acquaints him with the unjust wrong and indignitie which her Lord and husband hath offered her, and praies him to interpose his authoritie and judgement with him for their reconciliation; who seeing himselfe solicited and sought to by his owne blood,  & by his daughters hypocrisie, beleeves her to be as innocent as her husband De Mora thinkes her guilty of this foule crime of adultery with Palura ; and so undertakes to solicit and deale with his sonne in law De Mora to that effect, which hee doth, but with no desired successe, so that finding it to bee a knottie and difficult busines, and upon the whole no lesse than a Herculean labour, because of De Mora's wilfull obstinacie, and perverse credulity: hee therefore praies for both of them, and thus leaves them and their difference to time and to God: and upon these unfortunate tearmes doth old De Mora , his young wife Bellinda , and their marriage now stand. In the meane time Bellinda , (who suffers doubly both in her pleasure and her reputation) is not yet so devoid of sense, or exempt of judgement, but shee will speedily provide for the one and secure the other. To which effect (seeming sorrowfully obedient to her husband,) she thinkes it not fit that her Palura should for a season approach her house or her selfe; wherefore by a confident messenger shee sends him this letter.  thee far better than himselfe, wherein as hee is nothing deceived, so I conjure thee by the preservation of thy fidelitie, and my honour; to forbeare my house and sight for some two moneths, in which interim I will use my chiefest art, and the utmost of my possible power to calme the stormes and tempests that jealousie hath raised in him. So, bee thou but as patient as I will bee constant, and I hope a little time shall end our languishing, and againe worke our contents and desires; for though thou art absent from mee, yet I am still present with thee, and albeit my husband De Mora have my body, yet Palura , and none but Palura hath my heart, as knoweth God, to whose best favour and mercy, I affectionately and zealously recommend thee. Bellinda.  Palura receives this letter, and although hee fetch many deepe sighes at the reading thereof, yet hee gives it many sweet kisses for her sweet sake who writ and sent it him, hee knowes not whether hee hath more reason to condemne De Mora's jealousie, or to commend his Lady Bellinda's affection and constancie to himselfe, and because hee resolves to preferre her content and honour equally with his owne life, therefore hee will dispence with his lustfull, and lascivious pleasures for a time, purposely to give her beauty and merrits their due for ever, so in requitall of her affectionate letter, he (by her owne messenger) returnes her this kind and courteous answer.  affections, as truly joyfull that thou lovest mee far better than himselfe, wherefore to prevent his jealousie  & equally to preserve my fidelity with thy honour, and thy honour with my life, know sweet and deare Bellinda that thy requests are my commands, and thy will shall eternally be my law, in which regard I will refraine thy house all thy long prefixed time, and so forbeare to see thee, but never to love thee, because thy sweet & devine beauty, is so deeply ingraven in my thoughts & imprinted in my soule, that the farther I transport my body from thee, the neerer my affection brings my heart to thee. I will adde my chiefest wishes to thy best art, and my best prayers to thy chiefest power, that a little time may worke our content and desires: but because there is no torment nor death to languishing, nor no languishing to that of love, therefore I shall thinke every moment a moneth, and every houre a yeare before wee againe kisse and imbrace: conceale this letter of mine from all the world with as much care and secresie, as I send it thee with fervent zeale, and tender affection. Palvra.  The perusall of this letter and the affection of Palura demonstrated in this his resolution, makes Bellinda as glad, as the jealousie of her Lord and husband De Mora sorrowfull; and now seeing his rage so reasonlesse, and his malice and obstinacie so implacable towards her, she abandoneth her sighes and teares, resolves to make triall of a contrary experiment,  & so under a femall face assuming a masculine courage and resolution, shee sleights him and his jealousie, as much as hee doth her and her levity, and beares her selfe more highly and imperiously towards him than ever shee did heretofore, but this animosity of Bellinda produceth not that good effect which hee expects from her husband De Mora , for hee attributing this pride of hers to proceed from some bad counsell given her by minion Palura , it doth the more inflame his jealousie, and exasperate and set fire to his indignation, both towards her and him. Whiles Bellinda stands upon these tearms with her husband De Mora , his braines (as so many wheeles and spheares) are incessantly rolling and wheeling about the Orbe of jealousie, to find out the marrow and mystery of this lascivious league betweene his wife and Palura , in the agitation and conduction whereof, hee is as secret, as shee simple and inconsiderate, his policie is to find out any letter or letters of Palura to her, and her closet and casket are the only places as hee supposeth for her to hide and conceale them in. So on a munday morning, as his Lady Bellinda is gon to the parish Church to heare masse, hee purposely staies at home to effect this his secret intent and purpose, and then very privately enters her chamber, and his jealousie makes him so industrious of lock-smithes hookes, and instruments to open any locke. So hee first resolves to try and open that of her closet, which when he was on the very point to doe, casting aside his eye, hee sees the tawny Damaske gowne which his wife wore the day before, wherefore hee flies to it to search and rifle the pockets thereof for her keyes. Now Bellinda's hast and devotion to the Church was so great, as both shee and her waiting Gentlewoman, had forgotten the keyes of her closet and cabinet, and left them in one of the pockets of her said gowne, where her husband De Mora finds them, whereat being exceeding joyfull, hee claps up his hooks and instruments, and (with equall jealousie and haste) opens first her closet then her cabinet, wherein leaving nothing unsearched, hee at last finds the very same letter of Palura to his wife Bellinda , which wee have formerly seene and understood, the which (as the richest relique of her heart and the most pretious jewell of her content and affection, shee had secretly enshrined and treasured up in a small crimson sattin purse embroydered with gold. Hee reads it over againe and againe, but for that which said, I shall thinke every moment a moneth, and every houre a yeare before wee againe kisse and embrace, this line, I say, his extreme jealousie makes him to read over at least as often as it hath sillables, for this letter and this branch of this letter confirmes his jealousie, and now makes him fully assured and confident, that his wife and Palura have defiled his honour, and his bed, by committing adultery together; when vowing a sharp and speedy revenge hereof, hee (with a panting heart, and trembling hand) laies the velvet purse againe in the cabynet, then lockes it, as also her closet and chamber doore, having first left the keyes againe in the pocket of his Ladies gowne, and so comes downe into the Hall among his servants, as if hee were happie to know that, which it is his misery, because hee cannot be ignorant thereof. By this time his wife the Lady Bellinda is returned from Church; hee dines with her, and yet hee cannot dissemble his discontent and malice against her so artificially, but that shee observes some distemper in his lookes, and extravagancie in his speeches; but such is her pride, as shee is no way either curious or carefull thereof, nor as much as once surmiseth of what hee had now performed and acted. Dinner being ended, as soone as she betakes her selfe to walke in the allies, and arbours of her delicate garden, her husband De Mora , and his jealous and bloody resolutions are walking a contrary way; he is so netled with jealousie, and stung to the heart with malice and revenge; as he ascends to his armoury, takes downe an excellent sword and belt, a case of pocket pistols, each whereof hee chargeth with two bullets, cals for Emmanuell de Ferallo his Ladies Gentleman-usher, who was a very proper young man both of his person and hands, bids him to cause two of his best great sadle horses speedily to be made ready,  & wils him to accompany him to the towne of Arraiallos. Ferallo performes this order of his Lord, and then tels him that hee will goe into the garden, and acquaint his Lady and mistris with his absence, and to receive her commands before his departure, but his Lord commands him to the contrary, and neither to see or speake with her; so they take horse, and away. Now within halfe an houre after, the Lady Bellinda returnes from the garden, and understanding of their departure, who (in regard of the suddaynesse and unexpectation thereof) knowes not what to say or thinke thereof, or whither, or about what busines they are gon; but shee neither once dreames nor conceives so much as a thought, that her husband De Mora had found her sweet-heart Palura's letter, much lesse that hee had any malitious or disparate attempt, so suddainly to put in execution against him for her regard and cause, as to ride to Arraiallos to him, to fight with him. The youth and beauty of his young wife and Lady Bellinda , arming him with jealousie, and this jealousie with irreconcilable malice and revenge against Palura , hee cruelly resolving to make his body and life pay deare for it, rides away towards his house neere Arraiallos, and staying some halfe a quarter of a league from it in a faire greene meddow, sends his man Ferallo to him, and praies him speedily to take his horse, and come speake with him there, about a busines which much imports his good. Ferallo (knowing least of this quarrell, whereof his Lord and master De Mora thought most) finds out Don Palura at his house, and in faire and respectfull tearms delivereth him his message, which Palura understanding, his guilty conscience makes him exceedingly to doubt  & wonder of De Mora's intention  & resolution herein; but his lustfull heart & affections, looking more on the young Lady Bellinda the wife, than on the old Lord De Mora her husband, hee speedily (without any servant of his) takes horse and rides away with Ferallo to him in the meddow, where De Mora (on horse-backe) impatiently attended his comming. Salutations being here ended betweene them, (which Palura observes in De Mora to bee more short than ceremonious, and more abrupt than respectfull) De Mora cals his man Ferallo to him, and privately commands him to ride a meddow or two off, and not to dare offer either to stirre or draw, whatsoever hee see passe betwixt him and Palura , the which his man Ferallo obeies, but with much wonder and admiration what this busines might meane or produce betweene them. Here De Mora very passionately and cholerickly, chargeth Palura for abusing  & dishonouring of him, by committing adulterie with his wife Bellinda , the which Palura retorts to him as a foule scandall, and false aspersion, and (as an honourable Gentleman) in his speeches and answers to De Mora , makes his owne innocencie, and his wife the Lady Bellinda's chastity very apparent and probable: but these feigned excuses and false oathes and speeches of Palura doe no way satisfie, but rather the more incense the jealousie, and inflame the malice and revenge of De Mora against him, whereupon hee shewes him his owne letter, and with much bitternesse and vehemency demands him if that his owne hand writing doe not palpably convince him of adultery with his Lady. Palura is amazed at the sight of this his letter, so that blushing for shame, hee cannot here yet refraine from looking pale with griefe  & anger thereat, neverthelesse he will not be so ingratefull to the beauty and affection of Bellinda to think that shee hath betrayed him, by delivering up this his letter to her husband, but rather (giving a good interpretation and construction to the purity of her intents and affections towards him) hee beleeves with confidence, that hee had sinisterly and surreptiously betrayed her thereof, whereupon to fortifie her reputation, & to vindicate and cleere his owne innocencie, hee (with high words and loud crackes) protesteth this letter to bee false, suborned, none of his, and that it was written by some witch or devill, and sent by some treacherous enemy of his, purposely to affront him, and to disgrace his vertuous chaste and innocent Lady Bellinda ; but these feigned paliating excuses of his, cannot passe currant with the jealousie and revenge of De Mora , who now (to reduce contemplation into action) tels Palura that nothing but his death can expiate and satisfie this his crime, and therefore (on horse-backe as hee was) drawes his sword, and bids Palura doe the like. The which Palura hearing and seeing, he equaly for the preservation of Bellinda's honour,  & his owne life (as a brave and generous Gentleman) likewise drawes, as highly disdaining to have his youth and courage outbraved by this old cavallier: but here before they begin to fight, Palura with many strong reasons, and patheticall perswasions, againe and againe praies De Mora to desist from the combat, and to rest satisfied with the truth of his Lady Bellinda's honour, and his owne innocency in this their supposed and pretended crime of adultery: but hee speakes to the wind, for De Mora returnes him blowes for words. The event, and fortune of this their combat on horse-backe is, that in two severall meetings and incounters, Palura hath received no wound, but given De Mora two, the one in his necke, and the other in his left arme, whereof he bleeds so exceedingly as he begins to dispaire of the victory, and with his pistols to provide for his owne safetie and life; they by a mutuall consent divide themselves a little distance off to breath. When Palura reining his horse a little to straite, and his horse being hot and furious, and by meere strength and force turning round, De Mora with his watchfull and vigilant eye taking the advantage of this favourable accident, (when Palura never once dreams or thinks of pistols) speedily puls his two pistols forth his pocket,  & most basely and treacherously, with the first shoots him thorow the head, and with the second into the reines of his backe, of which mortall wounds hee presently fell off from his horse dead to the ground, having neither the power to repent his sinnes, nor the grace or happines to pray unto God for the salvation of his owne soule, and thus was the untimely end, and lamentable death of this valliant young cavallier Palura . De Mora seeing Palura dead,  & having more reason outwardly to rejoyce in this his victory, than inwardly in the cause & manner thereof, he waves his handcherchiefe to his man Ferallo to come to him (who was an eye witnesse and spectator and Co-mate) which he presently doth to whom hee speakes thus, first acquaint Palura's servants in his house, that I have slaine their master in a duell, then ride home and tell my wife the Lady Bellinda , that I have sent her Ruffian and adulterer Palura to heaven, and within six daies after come a way to mee to Lisbone, whether I am now poasting, when throwing him some gold for his journey hee takes leave of him and away, and at the very next Towne dresseth his wounds which prove hopefull and not dangerous. Now doth Ferallo (according to his Lords commission, and order) informe Palura's servants of his death, and of his said Lord and masters victory, but (for his honour and reputations sake) conceales that he basely and treacherously kild him with his pistols: they are extremely sorrowfull for this his misfortunate end: so whiles they fetch home his breathlesse body and prepare for his decent buriall; Ferallo returnes home and truly  & punctually relates to his Lady Bellinda the issue of this combat; as also of his Lord De Mora's speeches which hee commanded him to tell her, who poore Lady is all in teares for the death of her lover Palura , and well shee might in regard she loved him a thousand times dearer than her owne life, so upon the receit of this sorrowfull newes, shee shuts her selfe up in her chamber, and for many daies together, her griefe and lamentations for his death are so infinite, as shee will admit of no company, counsell, or consolation whatsoever, shee considereth how deeply the misfortune of this disaster will scandalously reflect on her honour, and fall on her reputation, and therefore vowes to requite Palura's death severly, and to revenge it sharply on the life of her husband De Mora who was his murtherer, at least when shee shall be so happie, or rather so miserable to see him returne to her from Lisbone. She exceedingly wondereth at his secret malice, and suddaine indignation and resolution towards Palura , but more at the cause thereof, and from what point of the compasse, or part of hell this furious wind should proceed, when at last having nothing els capable to comfort her, or to give truce to her teares, but the sight of Palura's aforesaid letter sent to her, the which in tender affection to him, shee for his sake had so often perused and kissed; shee therfore passionately and pensively flies to her closet, and with affection and sorrow to her cabinet to feast her eyes with the sight, and to delight and comfort her heart with the perusall thereof when (contrary to her expectation) shee finds the letter taken away, her other papers displaced, and her jewels reversed in her cabinet, and then shee knowes for certaine, that it is her husband De Mora , who had thus rifled her cabinet, and who had bereaved and robbed her of this sweet letter, which (next to Palura's sight and presence) was the chiefest joy of her heart, and the sweetest felicity and content of her mind, the which considering, she therefore absolutely beleeves, that the detection and perusall of this letter, was the sole cause of her Lord and husbands jealousie, as that was of her sweet Palura's death, wherein indeed shee is nothing deceived, for some six weekes after, hee returnes home to her from Lisbone, where (in favour of his Noble birth and discent, of his many great friends, and of a huge some of money) hee (in absence of the Viceroy ) had obtained his pardon, from the chamber of that cittie, and the very first salutations that hee gave his Lady Bellinda , (the which, I know not whether hee delivered to her with more contempt, or choler) was thus. Minion (quoth hee) how many prayers and oraysons hast thou said for the soule of thy Ruffion, and adulterer Palura , when she being exceedingly galled to the heart with these his scandalous speeches, she yet to justifie her owne honour and innocency, dissembles her griefe for Palura's death, as much as her jealous husband triumphes and insults thereat, and so frames him this short reply, that Palura was not her adulterer, but a Gentleman of honour, and therefore shee besought God to forgive him his owne heynous sinne and execrable crime for so fouly  & basely murthering of him. De Mora nettled with this his Ladies apologie and justification, which hee knew to bee as false as her, and Palura's crime of adultery was true, hee produceth this letter to her, then reads it her, and in a great rage and fury immediately teres and burnes it before her face; now although the sight and knowledge of this letter, as also her husbands burning thereof doe exceedingly vex and perplex our Lady Bellinda , yet shee was herewith no way daunted but againe very boldly tels him; that she cannot prevent any Gentleman to write and send her a letter, and although in the conclusion of this his letter to her had simply and sinisterly mentioned kisses and embraces, yet shee peremptorily vowed and swore to him, that the first had not exceeded the bounds of civility, nor the last violated the lawes and rules of honour, so wise and politicke was she in her answers,  & so false and hyppocriticall in her justification towards her husband. The which he well observing, and understanding, as also with what a pleasing grace shee spake it, his owne lustfull age, yet still doting on the freshnes of the youth and beauty of this his young wife, seeing that Palura (who was the cause and object of his jealousie) was now removed and dead, he therefore for the preservation of his owne honour and reputation in that of his Ladies, doth content himselfe so far as to bury the greatest part of his discontent and jealousie against her, in the dust of oblivion, or in that of Palura's grave, and to that end, he afords her his table still, and his bed sometimes, as if that obligation of courtesie, would reclaime her lascivious thoughts, and againe call home her wanton desires to chastity and honour, neverthelesse the better to effect and compasse it, hee much restraines her of her former liberty, and debars her the company and sight of all Gentlemen whatsoever that come to his house. A peevish custome, which the husbands of Spaine, Portugall, and Italy tirannically use towards their Ladies, whereas contrariwise the Ladies and Gentlewomen of England and France, are far more happie, because more chaste and honourable towards their husbands in using, and not abusing this their liberty and freedome. Bellinda with a watchfull eye, and a wanton heart observes these passages and comportments of her husband De Mora towards her, and in observing laughes at them; but because her lascivious mind incessantly tels her, that there is no hell to that of a discontented bed, therefore hating his age as much as hee loves her youth, her Palura being dead, she forth with resolves to make choice of another lover, and at what rate soever not to trifle away her time, and her youth idly, but to passe it a way in the amorous delights of carnall voluptuousnes and sensuality. To which effect missing of other Gentlemen (and therefore enforced to make a vertue of necessitie) she forgetting her selfe  & her honour makes choice of Ferallo her owne Gentleman-usher, a man every way as proper as shee is faire, and as well timbred as shee is beautifull, and neere of her owne yeares, which as yet had not exceeded one and twenty: to Ferallo therefore shee freely imparts her affections and favours, who as freely receives and as joyfully and amorously entertaines both her  & them, so that, to write the best of truth and modesty, I must here affirme, that as hee was formerly his Ladies usher, now hee makes himselfe his Lords follower; & (unknowen to him) very often ties her shooe-strings and takes up her maske and gloves for her, and many times when the old Nobleman is a sleepe, then this ignoble couple of unchaste lovers are waking to their obsoene pleasures, and secretly sacrificing up their lascivious desires to wanton Cupid the sonne, and to lustfull Venus the mother, but they shall find worme-wood intermixed in this honey, and gall in this sugar. For three moneths together our Bellinda the mistris, and Ferallo the man, drowne themselves in the impietie of these their carnall delights and pleasures, as if they made it their felicity and glory to continue the practise and profession thereof, but at the end and expiration of this time, as close as they beare this their adulterous familiarity from De Mora , it comes to his knowledge by an unexpected accident and meanes, for the reader must understand, that Ferallo was heretofore dishonestly familiar, with his Lady Bellinda's waiting Gentlewoman named Herodia , whom (under pretext and colour of marriage) hee had many times used, at his lascivious pleasure, so that Herodia seeing that Ferallo's affections were now wholly transported from her selfe to her Lady Bellinda , and that hee sleighted and disdained her, to embrace and adore the other, she is so inraged with jealousie at the knowledge and consideration thereof, as she cals a counsell in her heart and thoughts, what to doe herein, how to prevent it, and againe how to reclaime,  & regaine Ferallo and his affection, from her Lady to her selfe, and shee is so inflamed with jealousie towards them, as shee can reape no peace by day of her mind, nor rest by night of her heart before shee have effected it; to which end, having ranne over a whole world of remedies and expedients, shee at last resolves on this, to acquaint her Lord and master De Mora with this unchaste and obscoene familiarity, betweene his Lady Bellinda and her lover Ferallo , and her rage is so outragious as with infinite malice and celerity she performes it. At which unexpected and unwell- comed newes, our old Lord De Mora hath now his heart a new set on fire with jealousie and malice both towards his Lady, and her usher Ferallo , so that he as soone beleeves as understands this their adultery without ever making a stand either to consider the truth, or to examine the circumstances thereof, whereupon to make short worke, and to provide a speedy remedy for this unfortunate disaster, and disease; hee without speaking word of it, either to his Lady Bellinda , or to Ferallo , suddainely casheereth him from his house and service, and in such disgracefull manner, as hee will not so much as permit him to know the reason hereof, or to see, or take leave of his Lady and mistris, and from thence forth De Mora lookes on her with infinite contempt and jealousie. For it galles him to the heart, first to remember her dishonour, and dishonesty with Palura ,  & now far more to know that she is doubly guilty thereof with her owne domesticke servant and Gentleman-usher Ferallo ; wherefore he againe restraines her of her liberty, and his jealousie so far exceeds the bounds of judgement, and the limmits of reason, as hee will difficultly permit her to see any man, or any man to see her, but as rivers stopped does still degorge with more violence, and overflow with more imperuositie, so Bellinda takes this new jealousie of her old husband, and this suddaine exile and banishment of Ferallo her lover and Gentleman-usher in extreme ill part, and (after shee hath wept and sighed her fill thereat, shee then beleeves the prime and original cause therof, to proceed from the malice and jealousie of her waiting Gentlewoman Herodia : wherefore being infinitly despighted and incensed against her; shee (in her deare love and affection to Ferallo ) to requite her husbands courtesie, very discourteously turnes her away, and for ever banisheth her, her house and service, and to write the truth, Ferallo likewise in hatred  & malice to Herodia , will from thence forth neither see nor speake with her more. But to verifie the English proverb, that love will creepe where it cannot goe, although De Mora banisheth Ferallo from his house, and restraineth his Lady Bellinda of her liberty in his house, yet sometimes by day  & many times by night, they (by the assistance of some secret agents or Ambassadours of love) doe in the arbours of the gardens, and in some other out romes of the house very amorously meet, and most lasciviously kisse and embrace together. They hold many private conferences on their unlawfull affections, and many secret consultations upon their unjust discontents: so at last both of them joining in one wicked heart and mind, and (as matters are still best distinguished by their contraries) finding each others company sweet, and their sequestration and seperation bitter, they so much forget their selves and their soules, and so much fly from heaven and God, to follow Sathan and hell, as both of them beleeve and resolve, they can have no true or perfect content on earth before De Mora be first sent to heaven; now, upon this bloody designe they agree, and upon this hellish plot they fully resolve, only the gordian knot which must combine and linke fast this foule busines is, that De Mora being dead, Bellinda must shortly after marry her Gentleman-usher Ferallo , whereunto with as much joy as vanity shee cheerfully consenteth, when they are so prophane as they feale this their ungodly contract with many oathes, and ratifie and confirme it with a world of kisses, and then of all violent deaths, they resolve on that drugge of the devill, poyson, so without either the feare or grace of God, they of Christians metamorphose and make themselves devils, and Ferallo buying the poyson, Bellinda very secretly and subtilly in diet drink and broath administereth it unto her Lord and husband De Mora , which being of a languishing vertue and opperation, hee within lesse then foure moneths dies thereof; when with much cost and a wonderfull exteriour shew of griefe and sorrow, shee gives him a stately funerall, every answerable to the lustre of his name, and the quality of his dignity and honour, but God in his due time will pull off the maske of this her monstrous hippocrisie, and infernall prophanesse. Our jealous old Lord de Mora being thus laied and raked up in the dust of his untimely grave, his joyfull sorrowfull widdow the Lady Bellinda , according to her promise, to the griefe of her father Cursoro , to the wonder of Stremos, and the admiration of all Portugall marries with this her Gentleman-usher Ferallo ; but such lustfull and bloody marriages, most commonly meet with miserable ends. For six moneths together, Ferallo day and night keeps good corespondancy in the performance of his affections to his old Lady and mistris, and now his new wife Bellinda , and although they are unequall in birth and ranke, yet marriage having now made them equall, they mutually kisse and imbrace with as much content as desire; but at the end of this small parcell of time; satiety of his uxorious delights and pleasures makes him neglectfull, and which is worse contemptible thereof, (a base ingratitude, but to often subject to men of his inferiour ranke and quality, and which the indiscretion of Ladies of honour, very often paies deare for, as buying it many times with infamy but still which repentance) so that for ten nights, and sometimes for fifteene together hee never kissed or imbraced her; which unkind ungratitude of his, and respectlesse unvaluation of her youth and beauty, as also of her ranke  & meanes makes the Lady Bellinda his wife to be as hot in choler towards him, as he is cold in affection  & love towards her. But to ascend to the head- spring of this his discourtesie towards her, and so to fetch and derive it from its owne proper originall, wee must know that Ferallo was so vitious, inconstant, and base, as now hee is deeply in love with a new waiting Gentlewoman of his Ladies named Christalina , a sweet young maiden, of some eighteene yeares of age, tall of stature and slender of body, and whose beauty was every way as cleere and pure as her name, and yet whose maiden-head (with a few rich presents and many poore flattering oaths and false promises) hee had secretly purchased and gotten from her; yea his affection was so fervent to her, that part of the day could not content his lustfull desires, but hee forgets himselfe so far, as before his Ladies nose, and almost in her sight, hee must lye with her whole nights, and which is worse, almost every night without so much as once thinking of his owne wife the Lady Bellinda , or either loving what shee cared for, or caring for what shee loved. But Bellinda esteemes her selfe too good a Gentlewoman, and too great a Lady to be thus outbraved and disgraced, by a Taylors sonne, (for so was Ferallo ) and therefore consequently her heart is too well lodged, and too high fixed and seated in the degree of her high discent thus to receive  & suffer an affront, by a man of so low a beginning & so ignoble a quality and extraction as he was, and whom she had raised from nothing, and conferred and honoured him with her affection, and bed, and of her servant made him her husband; when for the space of six moneths together having continually used the best of her art, and the chiefest of her power, her sweetest perswasions, and her most sugred prayers and solicitations to make him abandon her maid Christalina , and so againe to reclaime him and his affection from her to her selfe, but seeing all her care vaine, and her prayers and intreaties towards him to prove frivoulous, shee at last (consulting with Sathan , and not with God) begins to assume bad thoughts and revengefull malice against him, for this his foule disloyalty, and base ingratitude and infidelity towards her: but first before shee attempts it, her turbulent and restlesse jealousie, makes her resolve to trie another conclusion, which is to put off this her waiting Gentlewoman Christalina from her service and attendance, in hope that Ferallo her husband would then thereby likewise put off himselfe and his affection from her, but this project and resolution of hers reapes no succesfull issue according to her desires, but receives end, as soone as beginning. For hee is still so deeply enamoured and so constantly affected to Christalina , as hee will neither permit nor suffer it, but in despite of his Lady Bellinda , and of all her sighes, teares, and prayers to the contrary, hee kisseth her in her sight, and (custome now making him licenciously bold and impudent) hee in this his sottish familiarity with her, sets her at table with himselfe and his wife; and in her presence, and before her face, tearms her his deare, his love,  & his sweet-heart: a disgrace of so unkind a nature, and discourteous a quality, as she highly disdaines long to suffer or digest it at his hands. So that seeing no hope of amendment, and therefore dispairing of any reformation thereof in him, shee resumes her former bad and bloody thoughts against him, and so peremptorily and definitively resolves to murther him. Her jealousie makes her thus malicious, her malice thus revengefull, and her revenge thus bloody hearted and handed towards him. She cannot be content to pace, but shee will ride poast to her confusion by heapeing crime upon crime, and murther to murther; shee hath formerly poysoned her first husband De Mora , and now shee resolves to poinyeard to death Ferallo her second, as if one of these two blood sinnes and crimes were not enough capable, to make her as truly miserable, as she falsly thinkes her selfe happie, in the performance and execution thereof. But these are the bitter fruits of jealousie and the sharp effects of choler, malice, and revenge which most commonly streame and proceed from it, Whiles thus her quondam Gentleman-usher, & now her unkind and disloyall husband Ferallo (without feare or care) is wallowing in his beastly pleasures and sensuality with his strumpet Christalina , this his ungodly wife, and revengefull Lady Bellinda (with as much secresie as treachery) is in requitall thereof prepareing of him a bloody banquet; yea so hastie is shee in her rage, and so outragious in this her revenge towards him, as shee will no longer bee abused or defrauded by him, but thinks every houre an age, before she have dispatched him for heaven. She will no more bee controuled and over mastred by him who was formerly her servant, and who first reputed it his greatest happines to kisse her hand, before shee vouchsafed him the honour to kisse her lips, or which is more, the felicity to imbrace her in her bed. She now sees with griefe, that hee hath betrayed her in betraying, and conveying his affection from her to her maid Christalina , and therefore although shee hath cast away her favours on him, yet of the two, shee vowes rather to cast away him than her selfe. No grace, no religion, not her conscience, not her soule, nor the consideration of heaven or hell can disswade or keepe her from this her bloody purpose, or divert her from the perpetration of this inhumane and cruell murther: but the very first night that he leaves her maid Christalina , and lies with her selfe, she (being purposely provided of a very sharp and keene razor, which she put in one of her gloves, and clapt it under her pillow) at breake of day as hee lay in bed soundly sleeping and snoring by her, she as a devill incarnate cuts his throat, and leaves him struggling in the bed, and weltering in his blood, without once having the power to think, to speake of God. Thus wee have seene the bloody malice, and infernall fury and revenge of this execrable young Lady Bellinda , in so lamentable and cruelly murthering her first and old husband De Mora , and now her young one Ferallo , and because the perpetration of these her inhumane crimes and facts are so odious to God, that their knowledge hath already pierced the clouds, and their sight ascended to the sacred presence and tribunall of God, therefore his all- seeing, and all-potent glorious Majestie, being as impartiall in his judgements, as divine in his judgements, as divine in his decrees, hath already sharpned his sword of justice, and made ready his arrowes of revenge, speedily to inflict and give her condigne punishment for the fame, yea and far sooner than either shee thinks or dreames thereof. She having thus dispatched this bloody busines, and seeing her husband Ferallo lie breathlesse in the bed by her, shee riseth up, and the better to colour out, and overvaile this her inhumane and monstrous villany, shee takes this her dead husbands knife out of his pocket, and goring it all in his blood, shee leaves it on his pillow by him, thereby (with as much hippocrisie as treachery) to insinuate a beleefe and confidence in the opinion of all men, that hee had there murthered himselfe, and that infallibly hee was the author and actor of this his owne deplorable death, which having performed, she takes on a fine cleane holland smocke, and puts off her cambricke one that she wore, which as a fatall marke of her crueltie, and a prodigious banner of her inhumanity, was all stained and engrained over with her husbands blood, and wrapping it up very close together, shee therein likewise envellops and enwraps her bloody razor, and also a two pound brasse weight, thereby the better to make it sinke, for shee resolves that very morning to throw it into a pond; so secret is shee in contriving, and so politicke in the concealing of this her cruell fact. The morne advancing to six of the clock, which was dark, cloudy and obscure, as if (by the secret appointment, and sacred providence of God) that the sunne (with his glistering beames) abhorred to behold so pittifull  & lamentable a spectacle. Bellinda hath no sooner apparelled her selfe, but triumphing in this her false victory and bloody conquest, and giving the murthered body of her husband a farwell, composed of many curses and execrations, shee softly issueth forth, clapping her bloody smock and razor in her pocket, the which (to make sure worke) she had tied fast with one of her blew silke garters, then lockes the chamber doore, and very secretly and surely conveyes and throwes in the key within side,  & then descends to the garden, where calling Hellena (another of her waiting Gentlewomen to her) shee bids her fetch her prayer booke, and thus away she goes towards their parish-Church of Saint Iulians on foot, which by computation was some halfe a small league distant off their house, and forbids any man servant to waite or attend on her thither. She is not a furlong off, but the more closely to finish her designe, shee there purposely sends away her maid Hellena to the parish-Church before her with this invented and colourable errand to seeke out her owne Priest father Sebastian , and to prepare him then to say masse to her, the which Hellena doth. Now the midway betweene her house and the Church is a great deepe pond, by the which shee is to passe; but a little before shee drawes neere it, a poore old maimed Souldiour, being cashiered from the Garison of the castle of Castcayes (named Roderigo ) travelling towards his home, and seeing this Lady all alone, and observing the sweetnes of her beauty, and the richnesse of her apparell, and attire, his poverty inforceth and incourageth him to request and begge an almes of her, the which with much humility hee doth. But the Lady Bellinda's heart and thoughts, were so much surprised and taken up with cruelty, as shee knew not what belonged to charitie, and therefore having other busines and windmils in her head, shee is so offended with Roderigo's begging importunity, as flatly refusing to give him any almes, shee forgets her selfe so far, as in steed thereof, shee gives him many harsh words and at last sends him away with some unkind and foule speeches; the which poore Roderigo , tooke so ill at her hands, that (in the fumes of a Souldiour) hee once thought to have requited it either on her person, or her apparell; but then againe (by her port and bravery) deeming her to bee some great neighbouring Lady, who that morning had purposely left her followers to take the sweetnes of the aire, and therefore fearing his danger more than hee loved his profit, hee abandoneth that cholericke and insolent resolution of his, when taking his leave of her, hee some two buts lengths from her betakes him to sit downe at the foot of a great Pine apple tree, where he might see her, but not shee him; and there looking after her with an eye of discontent and indignation, hee bewailes his wants and hard fortune, and also condemneth the obduratenesse of this unknowen Ladies uncharitable heart towards him, and inquiring afterwards of a mike-maid which passed by what shee was, he is informed that shee is the Lady Bellinda , widdow to the dead Lord Alonso de Mora , and now wife to Don Emanuell de Ferallo , who hereat doth not a little both grieve and wonder, that so rich and great a Lady was guilty of so much uncharitablnes. By this time shee being arived to the pond, looking about her, and beleeving that no mortall eye had seene her, she therein throwes her bloody smocke and razor (which as formerly I have said shee had tyed fast together with one of her blew silke garters) and the ponderosity of the brasse weight made it instantly to sinke to the bottome, whereof shee being infinitly joyfull, away shee trips to the parish Church, and there heares Masse, and mumbles out many Ave Maries , and Pater nosters to her selfe; but the whole world ingenerall, and the reader in particular may imagin with what a foule conscience, and a prophane and ulcerated soule, shee then and there performes this her devotion. Now although this our wretched Lady Bellinda have murthered this her second husband Ferallo , with wonderfull secresie, and buried these bloody evidences thereof in the pond, with such admirable care and privacy, that shee thinkes it wholly impossible for all the earth to reveale it; loe if earth cannot, yet now heaven will. So heare before I proceed further, let mee in the name and feare of God, request the Christian reader here to admire and wonder with mee, at the mercy and goodnes, and at the providence and pleasure of God in his miraculous detection, and condigne revenge and punishment thereof; for hee must know and understand, that it seemes God had purposely brought, placed and seated this poore old, weary maimed Souldiour Roderigo at the foot of this Pine tree, to to be a happie instrument of his praise, and a true Sentinell, and discoverer both for his sacred justice and divine honour: for here although Bellinda carried away her heart and charity from him, yet (as if guided by some heavenly power, and celestiall influence) Roderigo could not possibly carry away his eye from her, but as closely as shee threw this bloody cloth into the pond, hee espies it, and which is more, very plainely and palpably discernes the whitnes and rednes thereof; when considering and thinking with himselfe that this gallant proud Lady Bellinda might bee as unchaste and lascivious as shee was faire, and as vitious as she was young; God (with his immediate finger) imprinted in his thoughts and ingraved in his heart and mind, that either her selfe, or some one of her waiting Gentlewomen had had some bastard, and that shee had murthered it, and now throwen it into the pond, and was so strongly possessed of this conceit and beleife, that neither day, or night, nor nothing under heaven could possibly beate him from it, but for a whiles hee resolves to conceale this conceit to himselfe, as referring the truth thereof to time, and the issue to God. And here the order of our history calles us againe from Roderigo to Bellinda , who as soone as Masse is done, (with her waiting Gentlewoman Hellena ) returnes home to her house,  & by that time they arive there it is nine of the clocke, where (putting a pleasant face upon her false heart; and a sweet countenance upon her soyled and sinfull soule) shee presently inquires for her husband Don Ferallo , her servants make answer that they have not seene him to day, and that they think hee is still in bed, whereat shee musing and wondering, in regard hee was not accustomed to sleepe at so high an houre, shee therefore sends some of her servants to his chamber to see if hee be stirring, but finding his chamber doore locked, and calling aloud to him they can get no answer from him, the which they returne and report to their Lady Bellinda , who seeming exceedingly to doubt and grieve thereat, shee (far more perplexed in countenance than heart) ascends with them againe to her husbands chamber, where they all call and knock aloud at the doore to him, and shee far louder than them all, but in vaine, for still they heare no newes either of him or from him, whereat shee begins (outwardly) to tremble with apprehension and feare, and so commands them to force open the doore of his chamber, which they instantly doe, where they see their Lord, and shee her husband Ferallo to lie breathlesse in his bed, all begored and reeking in his hot and warme blood, with his throat cut, whereat his servants for true griefe, and his Lady Bellinda for false sorrow, make a lamentable crie, and a pittifull out-cry in his chamber which is over heard in all the house, but especially the Lady Bellinda her selfe, who so artificially dissembleth her joy, and so passionately makes demonstration of extreme griefe and affliction, for this deplorable death of her Lord and husband, both to her servants and to God, that shee is all in teares, and cannot because shee will not bee comforted thereat: they find the chamber doore locked, the key within side, and his owne bloody knife on his pillow and therefore they easily resolve and conclude that this their Lord and master Ferallo hath willfully made himselfe away, and is undoubtedly the author of his owne death; which opinion and resolution of the servants, their Lady and mistris Bellinda (secretly to her selfe) relisheth with much applause, and approbation, and to make her afflictions and sorrowes the more apparant to them, and in them consequently to the world, shee doth not refraine from excessive weeping and sighing. They leave the dead corps untouched in the bed, to acquaint the criminall Corigidores of Stremos with this pittifull accident, who come, and being amazed at this bloody disaster and accident of Ferallo , they veiwing the infinitie of his Ladies teares, and the sorrowfull complaints and exclamations of his servants, as also considering their severall depositions and examinations, and seeing they found his chamber doore fast locked, the key within side, and his owne bloody knife by him on his pillow, they all concurre with them in opinion about the manner and quality of his death, and doe absolutely beleeve and affirme, that hee hath desperately made himselfe a way, which opinion of theirs is presently received, voyced, and rumored in Stremos, and in all the adjacent parishes and country: and yet many curious wits (in regard of Bellinda's youthful affections, and wanton disposition) speake very differently hereof. And now doth this our sorrowfull young widdow, (the better to support her fame and reputation to the world) bury this her second husband Ferallo with all requisite, ceremony, and decency. But as the justice, and judgements of God (conducted by his divine pleasure, and inscrutable providence) doth many times goe on slowly, but still soundly and surely, so wee must here againe produce and bring forth our lame old Souldiour Roderigo to act another part on the stage and Theatre of this history. Hee is still the same man, and still retaines his same former opinion, that undoubtedly it was some dead child, or bastard which hee saw the Lady Bellinda to throw into the pond, and his heart incessantly prompted by his suspition, doth still confidently suggest and assure him, that that bloody cloth of hers contained some secret,  & invelloped some shamefull mistery towards her, which hee thinks all the water of the pond could not deface or wash away: so that he now understanding of her husband Ferallo's disasterous bloody end, doth no way diminish but rather every way augment this his suspition and jealousie hereof. Wee must further understand, that Roderigo (the better to refresh his body, to replenish his purse, and to repaire his apparell, staies some three weekes in Stremos, and although hee bee a Souldiour and have his sword by his side, yet being out of action and pay, hee is not ashamed to begge the almes and courtesies of the Gentlemen, Ladies and Gentlewomen both in  & neereabout that cittie. Among the rest understanding of the Lady Bellinda's great wealth and dignity, hee therefore hopes, that her new sorrowes and mourning for the untimely death of her husband, will now make her as compassionate to his poverty in her house, as lately shee was discourteous and uncharitable to him in the fields: whereupon hee repaires thither to her, but for three daies together, hee is not so happie to speake with her, or to see her, but being still prest by his poverty, and againe emboldned by the consideration of what hee saw her cast into the pond, hee the fourth day finds her walking in the next meadow adjoining to her house, attended by two of her men-servants, and two waiting Gentlewomen all clad in mourning apparell: when (with a boldnesse worthy of a poore distressed Souldiour) hee advanceth to the Lady Bellinda , where (interrupting her private walkes, and distracting her secret thoughts and meditations) hee with much observance againe begges some charity of her, whereat shee being offended, because her heart and mind neither thought, nor cared for an old Souldiour, but were wholly fixed on some desired new Gallant young husband, shee verie cholerikly disdaines him and his request, and with much passion and indignation (to use her owne words) commandeth her servants to see this bold beggerly Souldiour depart and packe away, both from her and her house. Roderigo hearing these her harsh and discourteous speeches, and seeing her servants unkind usage and enforcements towards him, hee with much discontent and choler leaves her house, but (in requitall thereof) vowes that his revenge shall not so soone leave her: for this her second affront to him puts him all in choler and fire towards her, so that hee vowes to God, and swears to himselfe to use the best of his power, and to worke the chiefest of his wits to perpetrate her disgrace. When secretly  & effectually informing himselfe from others, that Don Gaspar de Mora , who was nephew, and generall heire to her first Lord and husband Don Alonso de Mora , was at great variance and bitter contention in suit of law with his aunt Bellinda about some lands, and much rich moveables and Utensils which shee unjustly detained from him, and therefore that hee would bee exceeding glad to entertaine any invention or proposition whatsoever, which might heave her out of the quiet enjoying and possession thereof, and thereby procure her utter disgrace and ruine. Hee repaires to him, and secretly (yet constantly) acqaints him; that some three weekes since, and the verie morning, that Don Ferallo was found murthered in his bed, hee saw the Lady Bellinda his wife to throw a white and bloody linnen cloth into the pond, which was some halfe quarter of a league from her house: wherein God and his conscience told him, shee had wrapt and drowned some bastard infant either of hers, or of one of her waiting Gentlewomans, adding withall that hee could not possibly have any peace of his thoughts before hee had imparted it to him, to the end, that hee might reveale it to the criminall judges (or Corigidores) of Stremos to hunt out and examine the truth thereof. Don Gaspar de Mora doth as much rejoice as wonder at this unexpected newes, and because his inveterate malice to his aunt (in law) Bellinda perswads him rather to beleeve than doubt it, therefore (as malice is still naturally swift and prone to revenge) being confident of the truth hereof, hee leaves all other busines, rides over to Stremos and acquaints the Corigidores herewith, and taking Roderigo likewise along with him, hee also failes, not very resolutely to affirme, and most constantly to confirme it to them; which these wise and grave judges understanding, they in honour to Gods service and glory, and in true obedience to his sacred justice (without any delay or procrastination) take Don Gasper de Mora , the old Souldiour Roderigo , and some three or foure expert Swimmers along with them, and with hast and secresie speed away to the pond; wherein after those Swimmers had beene a quarter of an houre, and curiously busked and dived in most places thereof to find out this cloath, at last (by the mercy and providence of God) one of them diving far better than the rest, sees and finds it, and swimming with his left hand, brings it a shore in his right hand to the Corigidores, who much admiring and rejoycing thereat, cause it presently to bee opened, where (contrary to all their expectations,) they find no dead child, but (as wee have formerly understood) a cambricke smocke, as yet all spotted and stained with blood, and tyed fast with a blew silke garter, and in it a very sharp and bloody razor, with a brasse weight tyed in all this purposely to sinke it in the pond. The Corigidores, Gaspar De Mora , and all the rest, are amazed and astonished at the sight of these bloody evidences: when Roderigo againe constantly swearing to them, that hee saw the Lady Bellinda (with her owne hands) throw this little linnen fardell into that pond, the verie same morning that her husband Don Ferallo was found murthered in his bed; and the malitious curiosity of Gaspar De Mora here finding the very two first and last letters of her name in the cambricke smocke; the Corigidores then concurre in one opinion (as so many lines which terminate in one Centre) that yet infalibly it was shee and no other, who had so cruelly murthered her husband Ferallo in his bed. Whereupon taking this bloody smocke, razor, and garter with them, they with much zeale and speed poast away to the Lady Bellinda's house, to apprehend her for this her foule and lamentable murther, where cruell hearted and lascivious Lady, shee is so far from the consideration of grace, or the thought and apprehension of any feare, as shee feares none, and which is worst of all, not the power and justice of God himselfe; for shee is so immodest in her heart, so lustfull in her conversation, as (notwithstanding her blacke mourning attire and apparell) that her first husband was but lately dead, and now her second not as yet cold in his grave, yet (with great variety of musicke) shee is here now in her house singing, dancing and revelling with divers young Cavalliers, and Gallants both of the cittie  & country, as if she had no other care, thought or busines, but how to make choyce of a third husband, who might amorously please her lustfull eye and heart, and of no lesse than a paire of Paramours and favorites who should lasciviously content her wanton desires and affections. But these wanton vanities, and vaine and lascivious hopes of the Lady Bellinda will now deceive her: for now the Lords appointed due time is come, wherein for these her two horrible murthers committed on the persons of her two husbands, his divine  & sacred Majestie is resolved to powre downe his punishments, and to thunder forth his judgements upon her, to her utter shame and confusion. The Corigidores resolutely enter her house, & then and there cause the Sergeants to apprehend her prisoner, whereat being suddainly amazed, and infinitely terrified, shee weepes, sighes, and cries extremely. But those Cavalliers, (I meane those her supposed lovers, and pretended favorites) who were there singing and dancing with her, neither can or dare either assist, or rescue her. Now the plumes of her pride and jollity are suddainly dejected and fallen to the ground, yea her musicke is turned to mourning, her singing to sighes, and her dancing triumphes to teares. The enormity of her crime cause these officers of justice, to see her conveyed to prison, without any respect of her beauty, or regard of her sex and quality, where shee hath more leisure given her to repent, than meanes how to remedy these her misfortunes. The next morning shee is sent for before her judges, who roundly charge her for cruelly murthering her husband Don Ferallo in his bed, the which with many teares and oathes shee stoutly denies, then they shew her those bloody evidences, her cambricke smocke, the razor, her blew garter, and the brasse weight, and also produce and confront Roderigo with her; who as before hee had affirmed, now hee swears, hee saw her throw this bloody linnen fardell into the pond, the verie morning that her husband Don Ferallo was found murthered in his bed: and although at the sight and knowledge hereof, shee is at first wonderfully appalled and daunted therewith, yet her courage is so stout, as shee againe denies it with many prophane and fearefull asseverations, and delighteth to heare her selfe make a tedious justification, and a frivolous apologie to her judges for her innocency. But those grave and prudent Magistrates of justice, who (in zeale to Gods glory) have eyes not in vaine in their heads, will give no beleife either to the sweetnes of the Lady Bellinda's youth, or to the sugar of her speeches and protestations, but for the vindication of this crime, and of this truth, they adjudge her the very next morning to the racke, where (such is her female fortitude) as shee permits  & suffers her selfe to bee fastned thereunto, with infinite constancy and patience, as disdaining that the torments thereof, should extort any truth from her tongue to the prejudice of her reputation, and to the shipwracke of her safety and life, but herein she reckons too short of God, and beyond her selfe; for shee considereth not that these torments are truly sent her from God, and this her courage falsly lent and given her from Sathan ; for at the very first wrench of the racke, and touch of the cord, finding it impossible that her tender body and dainty limbs, can endure the cruelty of those tortures, God puts this grace into her heart, that with many sighes and teares, shee prayes her judges and tormentors to desist, and so publikely confesseth, that it was shee, and only shee who had murthered her husband Ferallo , and cut his throat in his bed with that very same razor. Upon which confession of hers; her judges (glorifiing God for the detection of this cruell murther) they (for expiation thereof) doe forthwith adjudge and sentence this wretched and bloody Lady Bellinda , to bee the next morning burnt alive without the walles of Stremos, at the foot of the castle which is the destined place of death for the like crimes and offendors, so she being by them then againe returned to prison, that night (in Christian charity) they send her some Priests and Nunnes, to direct and prepare her soule to heaved, for this her bloody and unnaturall crime was so odious to men, and so execrable to God, that shee could hope for no pardon of her life from her judges, although her sorrowfull old father Cursoro , with a world of teares threw himselfe to their feet, and offered them all his lands and meanes to his very shirt to obtaine it for her. All Stremos and the country thereabouts resound and talke of this cruell murthering of Ferallo , as also of his Lady Bellinda's condigne condemnation to death for the same, and the next morning at eight of the clocke, they all repaire under the castle wall to see this execrable and unfortunate Lady there in flames of fire, to act the last scoene and catastrophy of her life; she is conducted thither by a Saint Claires Nun on her right hand, and a Saint Francis Frier on her left, who jointly charge her upon perill of damnation, to disburthen her conscience and soule before shee dye, of any other capitall crime whereof shee knowes her selfe guilty, the which shee solemnly and religiously promiseth them; about nine of the clocke shee is brought to the stake, where she sees her selfe empalled and surrounded first with many fagots, and then with a very great concourse and confluence of people: here shee is so irreligious in her vanity, that shee had cast of her blackes and mourning, and purposely dighted her selfe in a rich yellow sattin gowne, wrought with flowers of silver, a large set ruffe about her necke, and her head covered over with a pure white tiffney vaile laced and wrought with rich cut-worke, as if shee cared more for her body than her soule, as if her pride and bravery would carry her sooner to heaven, than her prayers and repentance: or as if the prodigall cost and lustre thereof, were able to diminish either her crime, or her punishment in the eyes and opinions of her spectators. But contrariwise, the very first sight of her sweet youth, and pure and fresh beauty, and then the consideration of her foule crime, for murthering her owne husband, doe operate and worke differently upon all their affections and passions, some pittying her for the first, but all more justly condemning her for the second. When as soone as their clamorous sobs and speeches were past, and blowen over, and that both the Frier and Nun had tane their last leave of her, then (after she had shed many teares on earth, and sent and evaporated many sighes to heaven) shee wringing her hands (whereon shee had a paire of snow white gloves) and casting up her eyes towards God, at last with a faltring, and fainting voice spake thus. It is my crime and your charity good people, which hath conducted you hither to see mee a miserable Gentlewoman here to dye miserably. And because it is now no longer time for me, to dissemble either with God or the world, therefore to save my soule in heaven, though my body perish here in earth, I (with much griefe, and infinite sorrow) doe truly and freely confesse both to God and you, that I am not only guilty of one murther, but of two: for as I now lately cut my second husband Ferallo's throat, so I was so vild  & wretched heretofore, as to poyson my first Lord and husband De Mora . At which report and confession of this execrable Lady Bellinda (in regard of the greatnes of her Lord De Mora's descent  & Nobility) all this huge concourse of people (who are sensibly touched with griefe and sorrow) make a wonderfull noise and out-cry thereat, and now in regard of this foule and double crime of hers, they looke on her with far more contempt, and far lesse pittie than before. But shee being as patient as they are clamorous hereat, and seeing their cries, now againe cried downe, and well nigh drowned and hushed up in silence, recollecting her thoughts, and againe composing her countenance, shee againe very sorrowfully continueth her speech to them thus. I well know, and indeed I heartily grieve to remember, that these two foule and cruell murthers of mine, make mee unworthy either to tread on the face of earth, or to looke up to that of heaven, and yet in the middest of these my miseries I have this consolation left mee, that in favour of my true confession, and religious repentance thereof to God, that God can bee as indulgent and mercifull to mee, as I have beene impious and sinfull to him; the which that I may obtaine, I beseech you all who are here present, to joyne your prayers with mee, and to God for mee, and this is the last charity which I will begge and implore of you. Now because example is powerfull, & no example so strong and prevalent, as the words of the dying to the living, therefore (to Gods glory, and mine owne shame) give mee leave to tell you that two things especially brought and induced mee to commit these foule murthers, as they have now justly brought mee hither to suffer death for committing them, first my neglect of prayer, and omission to serve and feare God duly as I ought to have done. Secondly, the affecting and following of my lascivious and lustfull pleasures, which I ought not to have done. The neglect of the first proved the bane of my soule, and the performance and practice of the last, the contagion and poyson of my life, and both these two sins conjoined and lincked together, enforce mee now here to dye, with as much misery and infamie, as without them I might have lived (and perchance lived long) in earthly happines and prosperity. O therefore good people, beware by my woefull example, let my crime bee your integrity, my fall your rising, and my shipwracke your safety. As I beare not hypocrisie in my tongue, so I will not beare malice in my heart. Therefore from my heart I forgive Roderigo for telling Gaspar de Mora hee saw mee cast some bloody linnen in the pond. I also forgive Gaspar de Mora for informing the Corigidores thereof, and they for so justly condemning mee to death. I also pray my father  & parents to forgive mee these my foule crimes, and both to pardon & forget the dishonour and scandall which the infamy of my death may reflect and draw on them. And now I recommend you all to Gods best favour and mercy, and my soule to receive salvation in his blessed kingdome of glory. The Lady Bellinda having finished this her speech, the hearing and consideration thereof engendred much pittie and compassion in the hearts, and caused a world of teares in the eyes of the beholders; and now shee prepares her selfe for death. Here she takes off her rings from her fingers,  & her pearle bracelets from her armes, and (as a token of her love) gives them to her waiting Gentlewoman Hellena , who is present and not far from her, most bitterly sobbing and weeping because shee can weepe no more for the death of this her deare Lady and mistris, who now repeates many private prayers  & Ave Maries to her selfe, when taking a solemne, and sorrowfull farwell of all the world, shee puls downe her vaile over her snow-white cheekes, and then often crossing her selfe with the signe of the crosse, and saying her last in manus tua , the executioner (with a flaming torch) sets fire to the straw and fagots, whereof shee presently dies, and in lesse than an houre after, her body is there consumed  & burnt to ashes, at which all that great concourse of people and spectators, (in favour to her youth and beauty) as much affecting the piety of her death, as they hate and detest the cause thereof, I meane the infamy and crueltie of her life, doe with far more sorrow than joy give a great shout and out-cry. When the judges of that cittie now upon knowledge of this Ladies first horrible crime of poysoning her first Lord and husband Don Alonso De Mora , they in detestation thereof, being not able to adde, either worser infamy, or more exquisite, and exemplary torments to her living body, they therefore partly to bee revenged on her dead ashes, doe cause them curiously to bee gathered up, and so in the same place (by the common hang- man) before all the people, to bee scattered and throwen in the aire, where at they rejoyce, and praise God, to see the world so fairly rid, of so foule and bloody a female monster. And thus was the untimely, (and yet deserved) end of this lascivious and cruell hearted Lady Bellinda ; and in this sharp manner did the Lord of heaven and earth triumph in his just revenge and punishments against her, for these her two foule and inhumane crimes of murthering her two husbands. May God (of his best and divinest mercy) make this her history and example, to serve as a chrystall mirrour for all men, and especially for all women, (of what condition and qualitie so ever. And now Christian reader, having (by Gods most gratious assistance and providence) here finished this entire, and last volume of my six bookes of tragicall histories, if thou find that thou reape any profit, or thy soule any spirituall benefite by the reading and perusall thereof, then (in the name and feare of God) I beseech thee to joyne thy prayers and piety with mine, that as in Christian religion and duty wee are bound, so for the same, wee may jointly ascribe unto God, all possible power, might, Majesty, thanksgiving, dominion, and Glory both now and for ever. Amen, Amen.
