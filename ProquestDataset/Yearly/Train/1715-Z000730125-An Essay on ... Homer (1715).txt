 Being therefore to write something concerning a Life, which there is little Prospect of our knowing, after it has been the fruitless Enquiry of so many Ages, and which has however been thus differently treated by Historians, I shall endeavour to speak of it, not as a Certainty, but as the Tradition, Opinion, or Collection of Authors, who have been suppos'd to write of Homer in these four preceding Methods, to which we shall also add some farther Conjectures of our own. After his Life has been thus rather spoken of than discover'd, I shall consider him historically as an Author, with regard to those Works which he has left behind him: In doing which, we may trace the degrees of Esteem they have obtain'd in different Periods of Time, and regulate our present Opinion of them, by a View of that Age in which they were written. 1 I. If we take a View of Homer in those fabulous Traditions which the Admiration of the ancient Heathens has occasion'd, we find them running to Superstition, and multiply'd and independent on one another, in the different Accounts which are given with respect to Æ gypt and Greece , the two native Countreys of Fable. We have one in  2 Eustathius most strangely fram'd, which Alexander Papbius has reported concerning Homer's Birth and Infancy. That "He was born in Æ gypt of Dmasagoras and Æ thra , and brought up by a Daughter of Orus , the Priest of Isis, who was herself a prophetess, and from whose Breasts Drops of Honey would frequently distil into the Mouth of the Infant. In the Night-time the first Sounds he utter'd were the Notes of nine several Birds: In the Morning he was found playing with nine Doves in the Bed: The Sybil , who attended him, us'd to be seiz'd with a poetical Fury, and utter Verses, in which she commanded Dmasagoras to build a Temple to the Muses: This he perform'd in Obedience to her Inspiration, and related all these things to the Child when he was grown up; who, in Memory of the Doves which play'd with him during his Infancy, has in his Works prefer'd this Bird to the Honour of bringing Ambrosia to Jupiter ." One would think a Story of this Nature, so fit for Age to talk of, and Infancy to hear, were incapable of being handed down to us. But we find the Tradition again taken up to be heighten'd in one part, and carry'd forward in another. 3 Heliodrus , who had heard of this Claim which Æ gypt put in for Homer , endeavours to strengthen it by naming Thebes for the particular place of his Birth. He allows too, that a Priest was his reputed Father, but that his real Father, according to the Opinion of Æ gypt , was Mercury . He says, "That when the Priest was celebrating the Rites of his Countrey, and therefore slept with his Wife in the Temple, the God had knowledge of her, and begot Homer: That he was born with Tufts of Hair on his  4 Thigh, as a Sign of unlawful Generation, from whence he was called Homer by the Nations through which he wander'd: That he himself was the occasion why this Story of his divine Extraction is unknown; because he neither told his Name, Race, nor Countrey, being asham'd of his Exile, to which his reputed Father drove him from among the consecrated Youths, on account of that Mark which their Priests esteem'd a Testimony of an incestuous Birth." There are the extravagant Stories by which Men, who have not been able to express how much they admire him, transcend the Bounds of Probability to say something extraordinary. The Mind, that becomes dazled with the Sight of his Performances, loses the common Idea of a Man in the fansy'd Splendor of Perfection: It sees nothing less than a God worthy to be his Father, nothing less than a Prophetess deserving to be his Nurse, and, growing unwilling that he should be spoken of in a Language beneath its Imaginations, delivers Fables in the place of History. But whatever has thus been offer'd to support the Claim of Æ gypt , they who plead for Greece are not to be accus'd for coming short of it. Their Fansie rose with a Refinement above what we are suppos'd to have of their Masters, and frequently the Veil of Fiction is wrought fine enough to be seen through, so that it hardly hides the Meaning it is made to cover, from the first Glance of the Imagination. For a Proof of this, we may mention that Poetical Genealogy which is deliver'd for Homer 's, in the  5 Greek Treatise of the Contention between him and Hesiod , and but little vary'd by the Relation of it in Suidas . "The Poet Linus (say they) was born of Apollo and Thoose the Daughter of Neptune . Pierus of Linus : OEagrus of King Pierus and the Nymph Metbone: Orpheus of OEagrus and the Muse Calliope . From Orpheus came Othrys: from him Harmonides: from him Philoterpus: from him Euphemus: from him Epiphrades , who begot Menalops , the Father of Dius: Dius had Hesiod the Poet and Perses by Pucamede , the Daughter of Apollo . Then Perses had Meon , on whose Daughter Crytheis , the River Meles begot Homer ." Here we behold a wonderful Genealogy contriv'd industriously to raise our Idea to the highest, where Gods, Goddesses, Muses, Kings, and Poets link in a descent; nay, where Poets are made to depend, as it were, in Clusters upon the same Stalk beneath one another. If we consider too that Harmonides is deriv'd from Harmony, Philoterpus from love of Delight, Euphemus from beautiful Diction, Epiphrades from Intelligence, and Pucamede from Prudence; it may not be improbable, but the Inventors meant, by a Fiction of this Nature, to turn such Qualifications into Persons as were agreeable to his Character, for whom the Line was drawn : So that every thing, Divine or Great, will thus come together by the extravagant Indulgence of Fancy, while it turns itself sometimes to Admiration, and sometimes to Allegory. After this fabulous Tree of his Pedigree, we may regularly view him in one Passage concerning his Birth, which, though it differs in a Circumstance from what has been here deliver'd, yet carries on the same Air, and regards the same Traditions. There is a short Life of Homer attributed to Plutarch , wherein a third part of Aristotle on Poetry, which is now lost, is quoted for an account of his uncommon Birth, in this manner. "At the time when Neleus , the Son of Codrus , led the Colony which was sent into Ionia , there was in the Island of Io a young Girl, compress'd by a Genius , who delighted to associate with the Muses , and share in their Consorts. She, finding herself with Child, and being touch'd with the Shame of what had happen'd to her, remov'd from thence to a Place call'd Æ gina . There she was taken in an Excursion made by Robbers, and being brought to Smyrna , which was then under the Lydians , they gave her to Meon the King, who marry'd her upon account of her Beauty. But while she walk'd on the Bank of the River Meles , she brought forth Homer and expir'd. The Infant was taken by M aeon, and bred up as his Son,' till the Death of that Prince." And from this Point of the Story the Poet is let down into his traditional Poverty. Here we see, tho' he be taken out of the Lineage of Meles where we met him before, he has still as wonderful a Rise invented for him; he is still to spring from a Demigod , one who was of a Poetical Disposition, from whom he might inherit a Soul turn'd to Poetry, and receive an Assistance of heavenly Inspiration. In his Life the most general Tradition concerning him is his Blindness , yet there are some who will not allow even this to have happen'd after the manner in which it falls upon other Men: Chance and Sickness are excluded; nothing less than Gods and Heroes must be visibly concern'd about him. Thus we find among the different Accounts which  6 Hermias has collected concerning his Blindness, that when Homer resolv'd to write of Achilles , he had an exceeding Desire to fill his Mind with a just Idea of so glorious a Heroe : Wherefore, having paid all due Honours at his Tomb, he intreats that he may obtain a sight of him. The Heroe grants his Poet's Petition, and rises in a glorious Suit of Armour, which cast so unsufferable a Splendor, that Homer lost his Eyes, while he gaz'd for the Enlargement of his Notions. If this be any thing more than a meer Fable, one would be apt to imagine it insinuated his contracting a Blindness by too intense an Application while he wrote his Iliad . But it is a very pompous way of letting us into the Knowledge of so short a Truth : It looks as if Men imagin'd the Lives of Poets should be Poetically written; that to speak plainly of them, were to speak contemptibly; or that we debase them, when they are plac'd in less glorious Company than those exalted Spirits which they themselves have been fond to celebrate. We may however in some measure be reconcil'd to this last idle Fable, for having occasion'd so beautiful an Episode in the Ambra of Politian . That which does not inform us in a History, may please us in its proper Sphere of Poetry. 7 II. Such Stories as these have been the Effects of a superstitious Fondness, and of our Astonishment at what we consider in a View of Perfection. But neither have all Men the same Taste, nor do they equally submit to the Superiority of others, nor bear that human Nature, which they know to be imperfect, should be prais'd in an Extream without opposition. From some Principles of this kind have arisen a second sort of Stories, which glance at Homer with malignant Suppositions, and endeavour to throw a diminishing Air over his Life, as a kind of Answer to those who sought to aggrandize him injudiciously. Under this Head we may reckon those ungrounded Conjectures with which his Adversaries asperse the very Design and Prosecution of his Travels, when they insinuate, that they were one continued Search after Authors who had written before him, and particularly upon the same Subject, in order to destroy them, or to rob them of their Inventions. Thus we read in  8 Diodorus Siculus , "That there was one Daphne , the Daughter of Tiresias , who from her Inspirations obtain'd the Title of a Sybil . She had a very extraordinary Genius, and being made Priestess at Delphos , wrote Oracles with wonderful Elegance, which Homer sought for, and adorn'd his Poems with several of her Verses." But she is plac'd so far in the fabulous Age of the World, that nothing can be averr'd of her : And as for the Verses now ascrib'd to the Sybils , they are more modern than to be able to confirm the Story; which, as it is universally assented to, discovers that whatever there is in them in common with Homer , the Compilers have rather taken from him; perhaps to strengthen the Authority of their Work by the Protection of this Tradition. The next Insinuation we hear is from Suidas , that Palamedes , who fought at Troy , was famous for Poetry, and wrote concerning that War in the Dorick Letter which he invented, probably much against Agamemnon and Ulysses , his mortal Enemies. Upon this Account some have fancy'd his Works were suppress'd by Agamemnon's Posterity, or that their entire Destruction was contriv'd and effected by Homer when he undertook the same Subject. But surely the Works of so considerable a Man, when they had been able to bear up so long a time as that which pass'd between the Siege of Troy , and the flourishing of Homer , must have been too much dispers'd, for one of so mean a Condition as he is represented, to have destroy'd in every place, tho' he had been never so much assisted by the vigilant Temper of Envy. And we may say too, that what might have been capable of raising this Principle in him, must be capable of being in some measure esteem'd, and of having at least one Line of it preserv'd to us. After him, in the order of time, we meet with a whole Set of Names, to whom the Maligners of Homer would have him oblig'd, without being able to prove their Assertion. Suidas mentions Corinnus Iliensis , the Secretary of Palamedes , who writ a Poem upon the same Subject, but no one is produc'd as having seen it.  9 Tzetzes mentions (and from Johannes Melala only) Sisyphus the Coan , Secretary of Teucer , but it is not so much as known if he writ Verse or Prose. Besides these, are Dictys the Cretan, Secretary to Idomeneus , and Dares the Phrygian an Attendant of Hector , who have spurious Treatises passing under their Names. From each of these is Homer said to have borrow'd his whole Argument; so inconsistent are these Stories with one another. The next Names we find, are Demodocus , whom Homer might have met at Corcyra , and Phemius , whom he might have met at Ithaca: the one (as 10 Plutarch says) having according to Tradition written the War at Troy , the other the Return of the Grecian Captains . But these are only two Names of Friends, which he is pleas'd to honour with Eternity in his Poem, or two different Pictures of himself, as Author of the Iliad and Odysses , or entirely the Children of his Imagination, without any particular Allusion. So that his Usage here, puts me in mind of his own Vulcan in the  11 Iliad: The God had cast two Statues which he endued with the Power of Motion; and it is said presently after , that he is scarce able to go unless they support him. It is reported by some, says  12 Ptolom aeus Ephestio , "That there as before Homer , a Woman of Memphis , call'd Phantasia , who rit of the Wars of Troy , and the Wandrings of Ulysses . Now Homer arriving at Memphis where she had laid up her Works, and getting acquainted with Phanitas , whose Business it was to copy the sacred Writings, he obtain'd a sight of these, and follow'd entirely the Scheme she had drawn." But this is a wild Story, which speaks of an Æ gyptian Woman with a Greek Name, and who never was heard of but upon this account. It appears indeed from his Knowledge of the Æ gyptian Learning, that he was initiated into their Mysteries, and for ought we know by one Phanitas . But if we consider what the Name of the Woman signifies, it seems only as if from being us'd in a figurative Expression, it had been mistaken afterwards for a proper Name. And then the Meaning will be, that having gather'd as much Information concerning the Grecian and Trojan Story, as he could be furnish'd with from the Accounts of Æ gypt , which were generally mix'd with Fancy and Fable, he wrought out his Plans of the Iliad and the Odysses . We pass all these Stories, together with the little Iliad of Siagrus , mention'd by  13 Æ lian . But one cannot leave this Subject without reflecting on the depreciating Humour, and odd Industry of Man, which shews itself in raising such a Number of Insinuations that clash with each other, and in spiriting up such a Crowd of unwarranted Names to support them. Nor can we but admire at the contradictory Nature of this Proceeding, that Names of Works, which either never were in Being, or never worthy to live, should be produc'd, only to persuade us that the most lasting and beautiful Poem of the Ancients was taken out of them. A Beggar might be content to patch up a Garment with such shreds as the World throws away, but it is never to be imagin'd an Emperor would make his Robes of them. After Homer had spent a considerable time in Travel, we find him towards his Age introduc'd to such an Action as tends to his Disparagement, It is not enough to accuse him for spoiling the dead, they raise a living Author by whom he must be baffled in that Qualification on which his Fame is founded. There is in  14 Hesiod an Account of an ancient Poetical Contention at the Funeral of Amphidamas , in which, he says, he obtain'd the Prize, but does not mention from whom he carry'd it. There is also among the  15 Hymns ascribed to Homer , a Prayer to Venus, for Success in a Poetical Dispute, but it neither mentions where, not against whom. But though they have neglected to name their Antagonists, others have since taken care to fill up the Stories by putting them together. The making two such considerable Names in Poetry engage, carries an amusing Pomp in it, like making two Heroes of the first Rank enter the Lists of Combat. And if Homer and Hesiod had their Parties among the Grammariuns , here was an excellent Opportunity for Hesiod's Favourers to make a Sacrifice of Homer . Hence might a bare Conjecture spread into a Tradition , then the Tradition give occasion to an Epigram , which is yet extant, and again the Epigram (for want of knowing the Time it was writ in) be alledg'd as a Proof of that Conjecture from whence it sprung. After this, a  16 whole Treatise was written upon it, which appears not very ancient, because it mentions Adrian: The Story agrees in the main with the short Account we find in  17 Plutarch . "That  18 Ganictor , the Son of Amphidamas , King of Euboea , being us'd to celebrate his Father's funeral Games, invited from all Parts Men famous for Strength and Wisdom. Among these Homer and Hesiod arriv'd at Chalcis . The King Panidas presided over the Contest, which being finish'd, he decreed the Tripos to Hesiod , with this Elogy in the Sentence, That the Poet of Peace and Husbandry better deserv'd to be crown'd, than he who stirs us up to War and Contention. Whereupon Hesiod dedicated the Prize to the Muses, with this Inscription," " ![](/images/inline/EEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) " "Ὕ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/KHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) " Which are two Lines taken from that Place in Hesiod where he mentions no Antagonist, and alter'd, that the two Names might be brought in, as is evident by comparing them with these, Ὕ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/Mgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aposgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) . To answer this Story, we take notice that Hesiod is generally plac'd after Homer . Gr aevius , his own Commentator, sets him a hundred Years lower; and whether he were so or no, yet  19 Plutarch has slightly pass'd the whole Account as a Fable. Nay, we may draw an Argument against it from Hesiod himself : He had a Love of Fame which caus'd him to engage at the Funeral Games, and which went so far as to make him record his Conquest in his own Works; Had he defeated Homer , the same Principle would have made him mention a Name that could have secur'd his own to Immortality. A Poet who records his Glory, would not omit the noblest Circumstance, and Homer , like a Captive Prince, had certainly grac'd the Triumph of his Adversary. Towards the latter end of his Life, there is another Story invented, which makes him conclude it in a manner altogether beneath the Greatness of a Genius. We find in the Life said to be written by Plutarch , a Tradition, "That he was warn'd by an Oracle to beware of the young Mens Riddle. This remain'd long obscure to him, 'til he arriv'd at the Island Io . There as he sat to behold the Fishermen, they propos'd to him a Riddle in Verse, which he being unable to answer, dy'd for Grief." This Story refutes itself by carrying Superstition at one end, and Folly at the other. It seems conceiv'd with an Air of Derision to lay a great Man in the Dust after a foolish Manner. The same sort of Hand might have fram'd that Tale of Aristotle's drowning himself because he could not account for the Euripus: The Design is the same, the Turn the same; and all the difference, that the great Men are each to suffer in his Character, the one by a Poetical Riddle , the other by a Philosophical Problem . But these are actions which can only proceed from the Meanness of Pride, or Extravagance of Madness : A Soul enlarg'd with Knowledge (so vastly as was that of Homer ) better knows the proper Stress which is to be laid upon every Incident, and the Proportion of Concern, or Carelesness, with which it ought to be affected. But it is the Fate of narrow Capacities to measure Mankind by a false Standard; and imagine the Great, like themselves, capable of being disconcerted by little Occasions; to frame their malignant Fables according to this Imagination, and to stand detected by it as by an evident Mark of Ignorance. 20 The third Manner in which the Life of Homer has been written, is but a heaping of all the Traditions and Hints which the Writers could meet with, great or little, in order to tell a Story of him to the World. Perhaps the want of choice Materials might put them upon the Necessity; or perhaps an injudicious Desire of saying all they could, occasion'd the fault. However it be, a Life compos'd of trivial Circumstances, which (tho' it give a true account of several Passages) has but little of that Appearance in which a Man was most famous, and hardly any thing correspondent to the Idea we entertain of him : Such a Life, I say, will never answer rightly the demand the World has upon an Historian. Yet the most formal Account we have of Homer is of this Nature, I mean that which is said to be collected by Herodotus . It is, in short, an unsupported minute Treatise, compos'd of Events which lie within the Compass of Probability, and belong to the lowest Sphere of Life. It seems through all its Frame to be entirely conducted by the Spirit of a Grammarian , ever abounding with extempore Verses , as if it were to prove a thing so unquestionable as our Author's Title to Rapture; and at the same time the Occasions are so poorly invented, that they misbecome the Warmth of a Poetical Imagination. There is nothing in it above the Life which a Grammarian might lead himself; nay, it is but such an one as they commonly do lead, the highest Stage of which is to be Master of a School . But because this is a Treatise to which Writers have had recourse for want of a better, I shall give the following Abstract. Homer was born at Smyrna , about one hundred sixty eight Years after the Siege of Troy , and six hundred twenty two Years before the Expedition of Xerxes . His Mother's Name was Crytheis, who proving unlawfully with Child, was sent away from Cum ae by her Uncle, with Ismenias , one of those who led the Colony to Smyrna then building. A while after, as she was celebrating a Festival with other Women on the Banks of the River Meles , she was deliver'd of Homer , whom she therefore nam'd Melesigenes . Upon this she left Ismenias , and supported herself by Working, 'til Phemius (who taught a School in Smyrna ) fell in love with her, and marry'd her. But both dying in process of Time, the School fell to Homer , who manag'd it with such Wisdom, that he was universally admir'd both by Natives and Strangers. Amongst these latter was Mentes , a Master of a Ship from Leucadia , by whose Persuasions and Promises he gave up his School, and went to travel : With him he visited Spain and Italy , but was left behind at Ithaca upon account of a Defluxion in his Eyes. During his Stay he was entertain'd by one Mentor , a Man of Fortune, Justice, and Hospitality, and learn'd the principal Incidents of Ulysses's Life. But at the Return of Mentes , he went from thence to Colophon , where, his Defluxion renewing, he fell entirely blind. Upon this he could think of no better Expedient than to go back to Smyrna , where perhaps he might be supported by those who knew him, and have the leisure to addict himself to Poetry. But there he found his Poverty encrease, and his hopes of Encouragement fail; so that he remov'd for Cum ae , and by the way was entertain'd for some time at the House of one Tychius a Leather-Dresser. At Cum ae his Poems were wonderfully admir'd, but when he propos'd to eternize their Town if they would allow him a Sallary, he was answer'd, That there would be no end of maintaining all the ![](/images/inline/rbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  , or blind Men , and hence he got the Name of Homer . From Cum ae he went to Phoc aea , where one Thestorides (a School-master also) offer'd to maintain him if he would suffer him to transcribe his Verses : This Homer complying with for meer Necessity, the other had no sooner gotten them, but he remov'd to Chios ; There the Poems gain'd him Wealth and Honour, while the Author himself hardly earn'd his Bread by repeating them. At last, some who came from Chios having told the People that the same Verses were publish'd there by a School-master, Homer resolv'd to find him out. Having therefore landed near that Place, he was receiv'd by one Glaucus a Shepherd (at whose Door he had like to have been worried by Dogs) and carry'd by him to his Master at Bollissus , who admiring his Knowledge, entrusted him with the Education of his Children. Here his Praise began to spread, and Thestorides , who heard of his Neighbourhood, fled before him. He remov'd however some time afterwards to Chios , where he set up a School of Poetry, gain'd a competent Fortune, marry'd a Wife, and had two Daughters, the one of which dy'd young, the other was marry'd to his Patron at Bollissus . Here he inserted in his Poems the Names of those to whom he had been most oblig'd, as, Mentes, Phemius, Mentor, and Tychius: and resolving for Athens , he made honourable mention of that City, to prepare the Athenians for a kind Reception. But as he went, the Ship put in at Samos , where he continu'd the whole Winter, singing at the Houses of great Men, with a Train of Boys after him. In Spring he went on board again in order to prosecute his Journey to Athens , but landing by the way at Ios , he fell sick, dy'd, and was bury'd on the Sea-Shore. This is the Life of Homer ascrib'd to Herodotus , tho' it is wonderful it should be so, since it evidently contradicts his own History , by placing Homer six hundred twenty two Years before the Expedition of Xerxes ; whereas Herodotus himself, who was alive at the time of that Expedition, says Homer was only  21 four hundred Years before him. However, if we can imagin that there may be any thing of Truth in the main Parts of this Treatise, we may gather these general Observations from it : That he shew'd a great Thirst of Knowledge, by undertaking such long and numerous Travels; That he manifested an unexampled Vigor of Mind, by being able to write with more Fire under the Disadvantages of Blindness, and the utmost Poverty, than any Poet after him in better Circumstances; And that he had an unlimited Sense of Fame (the Attendant of noble Spirits) which prompted him to engage in new Travels, both under these Disadvantages, and the additional Burthen of old Age. But it will not perhaps be either improper or difficult to make some Conjectures, which seem to lay open the Foundation from whence the Traditions which frame the low Lives of Homer have arisen. In the first place we may consider, That there are no Historians of his Time (or none handed down to us) who have mention'd him; and that he has never spoken plainly of himself, in those Works which have been ascrib'd to him without Controversy. However, an eager Desire to know something concerning him has occasion'd Mankind to labour the Point under these Disadvantages, and turn on all Hands to see if there were any thing left which might have the least Appearance of Information. Upon the Search, they find no Remains but his Name and Works , and resolve to torture these upon the Rack of Invention, in order to give some account of the Person they belong to. The first Thing therefore they settle is, That what pass'd for his Name , must be his Name no longer, but an additional Title us'd instead of it. The reason why it was given, must be some Accident of his Life. Having thus found an end of the Clue, they proceed to consider every thing that the word may imply by its Derivation. One finds that Ὄ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  signifies a Thigh ; whence arises the Tradition in  22 Heliodorus , that he was banish'd Æ gypt for the Mark on that Part, which shew'd a spurious Birth; and this they imagine ground enough to give him the Life of a Wanderer. A second finds that Ὄ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  signifies an Hostage , and then he must be deliver'd as such in a War (according to  23 Proclus ) between Smyrna and Chios . A third can derive the Name ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , non videns , from whence he must be a blind Man (as in the Piece ascrib'd to  24 Herodotus .) A fourth brings him from ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , speaking in Council ; and then (as it is in Suidas ) he must, by a divine Inspiration, declare to the Smyrn aeans , that they should war against Colophon . A fifth finds the word may be brought to signify following others , or joining himself to them, and then he must be call'd Homer for saying (as it is quoted from  25 Aristotle in the Life ascrib'd to Plutarch ) that he would ![](/images/inline/sbOgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  , or follow the Lydians from Smyrna . Thus has the Name been turn'd and winded enough at least to give a Suspicion, that he who got a new Etymology , got a handle either for a new Life of him, or something which he added to the old one. However, the Name itself not affording enough to furnish out a whole Life, his Works must be brought in for Assistance, and it is taken for granted, That where he has not spoken of himself, he lies veil'd beneath the Persons or Actions of those whom he describes. Because he calls a Poet by the Name of Phemius in his Odysses , they conclude this  26 Phemius was his Master. Because he speaks of Demodacus as another Poet who was blind, and frequented Palaces, he must be sent about  27 blind, to sing at the Doors of rich Men. If Ulysses be set upon by Dogs at his Shepherd's Cottage, because this is a low Adventure, it is thought to be his own at Bollissus .  28 And if he calls the Leather-dresser, who made Ajax's Shield, by the Name of Tychius , he has been supported by such an one in his Wants : Nay, some have been so violently carry'd into this way of conjecturing, that the bare  29 Simile of a Woman who works hard for her Livelihood, is said to have been borrow'd from his Mother's Condition, and brought as a Proof of it. Thus he is still imagin'd to intend himself; and the Fictions of Poetry, converted into real Facts, are deliver'd for his Life, who has assign'd them to others. All those Stories in his Works which suit with a mean Condition are suppos'd to have happen'd to him, tho' the same way of Inference might as well prove him to have acted in a higher Sphere, from the many Passages that shew his Skill in Government, and his Knowledge of the great Parts of Life. There are some other scatter'd Stories of Homer which fall not under these Heads, but are however of as trifling a Nature; as much unfit for the Materials of History, still more ungrounded, if possible, and arising merely from Chance, or the Humours of Men : Such is the Report we meet with from  30 Heraclides , That " Homer was fin'd at Athens for a Madman;" which seems invented by the Disciples of Socrates to cast an Odium upon the Athenians for their consenting to the Death of their Master, and carries in it something like a declaiming Revenge of the Schools, as if the World should imagine the one could be esteem'd mad , where the other was put to Death for being wicked . Such another Report is that in  31 Æ lian , That " Homer portion'd his Daughter with some of his Works for want of Money;" which looks but like a Whim deliver'd in the Gaiety of Fancy; a Jest upon a poor Wit, which at first might have had an Epigrammatist for its Father, and been afterwards gravely understood by some painful Collector. In short, Mankind have labour'd heartily about him to no purpose; they have caught up every thing greedily, with that busy minute Curiosity and unsatisfactory Inquisitiveness which Seneca calls the Disease of the Greeks; they have puzzled the Cause by their Attempts to find it out; and, like Travellers entirely destitute of a Road, yet resolv'd to make it over unpassable Deserts, they superinduce Error, instead of removing Ignorance. 32 Whenever Men have set themselves to write a Life of Homer , clear from Superstition, Envy, and Trifling, they have grown asham'd of all these Traditions. This, however, has not occasion'd every one to desist from the Undertaking; but still the Difficulty which could not make them desist, has necessitated them, either to deliver the old Story with Excuses; or else, instead of a Life, to compose a Treatise partly of Criticism , and partly of Character ; rather descriptive, than supported by Action, and the Air of History. 33 They begin with letting us know, that the Time in which he liv'd has never been fix'd beyond dispute, and that the Opinions of Authors are various concerning it : But the Controversy, in its several Conjectures, includes a Space of Years between the earliest and latest, from twenty four to about five hundred after the Siege of Troy . Whenever the Time was, it seems not to have been near that Siege, from his own  34 Invocation of the Muses to recount the Catalogue of the Ships : "For we, says he, have only heard a Rumour, and know nothing particularly." It is remark'd by  35 Velleius Paterculus , That it must have been considerably later, from his own Confession, that Mankind was but half as strong in his Age, as in that he writ of; which, as it is founded upon a Notion of a gradual Degeneracy in our Nature, discovers the Interval to have been long between Homer and his Subject. But not to trouble our selves with entring into all the dry Dispute, we may here take notice, that the World is inclin'd to stand by the  36 Arundelian Marble , as the most certain Computation of those early Times; and this, by placing him at the time when Diognetus rul'd in Athens , makes him flourish a little before the Olympiads were establish'd; about three hundred Years after the taking of Troy , and near a thousand before the Christan Æra . For a farther Confirmation of this, we have some great Names of Antiquity, who give him a Contemporary agreeing with the Computation. 37 Cicero says, There was a Tradition that Homer liv'd about the time of Lycurgus .  38 Strabo tells us, It was reported that Lycurgus went to Chios for an Interview with him. And even Plutarch , when he says, Lycurgus receiv'd Homer 's Works from the Grandson of that Creophilus with whom he had liv'd, does not put him so far backward, but that possibly they might have been alive together. 39 The next Dispute regards his Country , concerning which,  40 Adrian enquir'd of the Gods, as a Question not to be settled by Men; and Appion (according to  41 Pliny) rais'd a Spirit for his Information. That which has encreas'd the difficulty, is the Number of contesting Places, of which Suidas has reckon'd up nineteen in one Breath. But his ancient Commentator,  42 Didymus , found the Subject so fertile, as to employ a great Part of his four thousand Volumes upon it. There is a Prophecy of the Sybils that he should be born at Salamis in Cyprus ; and then to play an Argument of the same Nature against it, there is the Oracle given to Adrian afterwards, that says he was born in Ithaca . There are Customs of Æ olia and Æ gypt cited from his Works, to make out by turns, and with the same Probability, that he belong'd to each of them. There was a School shew'd for his at Colophon , and a Tomb at Io , both of equal Strength to prove he had his Birth in either. As for the Athenians , they challeng'd him as born where they had a Colony ; or else in behalf of Greece in general, and as the Metropolis of its Learning, they made his Name free of their City, ( qu. Licini a & Mutia lege , says  43 Politian ) after the manner of that Law by which all Italy became free of Rome . All these have their Authors to record their Titles, but still the Weight of the Question seems to lie between Smyrna and Cbios , which we must therefore take a little more notice of. That Homer then was born at Smyrna is endeavour'd to be prov'd by an  44 Epigram , recorded to have been under the Statue of Pisistratus at Athens ; by the Reports mention'd in Cicero, Strabo , and A. Gellius ; and by the Greek Lives, which are prefix'd to him with the Names of Herodotus, Plutarch , and Proclus ; as also the two that are anonymous. For this the  45 Smyrn aeans built him a Temple; cast Medals of him, and grew so possest of his having been theirs, that it is said they burn'd Zoilus for affronting them in the Person of Homer . On the other hand, the Chians plead the ancient Authorities of  46 Simonides and  47 Theocritus for his being born among them. They mention a Race they had, call'd the Homerid ae , whom they reckon'd his Posterity; they cast Medals of him; they shew to this Day an Hom aerium , or Temple of Homer , near Bollissus ; and close their Arguments with a Quotation from the Hymn to Apollo (which is acknowledg'd for Homer 's by  48 Thucydides ) where he calls himself, "The blind Man that inhabits Chios ." The Reader has here the Sum of the large Treatise of Leo Allatius , written particularly on this Subject  49 in which, after having separately weigh'd the Pretensions of all, he concludes for Chios . For my part, I determine nothing in a Point of so much Uncertainty; neither which of these was honour'd with his Birth, nor whether any of them was, nor, again, whether each may not have produc'd his own Homer ; since  50 Xenophon says, there were many of the Name. But one cannot avoid being surpriz'd at the prodigious Veneration of his Character, which could engage Mankind with such Eagerness in a Point so little essential; that Kings should send to Oracles for the Enquiry of his Birth-place; that Cities should be in Strife about it, and whole Lives of learned Men employ'd upon it; that some should write Treatises concerning it; that others should call up Spirits unavailingly; that thus, in short, Heaven, Earth and Hell should be sought to, for the Decision of a Question which terminates in Curiosity only. 51 If we endeavour to find the Parents of Homer , we immediately perceive the Search is fruitless.  52 Ephorus has made M aeon to be his Father, by a Niece whom he deflour'd; and this has so far obtain'd, as to give him the derivative Name of M aeonides . His Mother (if we allow the Story of M aeon ) is call'd Crytheis: But we are both again in Uncertainty if we search farther; for Suidas has mention'd Eumetis or Polycaste ; and  53 Pausanias , Clymene or Themisto ; which happens; because the contesting Countrys find out Mothers of their own for him. Tradition has in this case afforded us no more Light than what may serve to shew its Shadows in a Confusion; they strike the Sight with so equal a Probability, that we are in doubt which to chuse, and must pass the Question undecided. 54 If we enquire concerning his own Name , even that is doubted of. He has been call'd Melesigenes from the River where he was born. Homer has been reckon'd an ascititious Name, from some Accident in his Life : The Certamen Homericum calls him once Auletes , perhaps from his musical Genius; and 55 Lucian, Tigranes ; it may be from a Confusion with that Tigranes or  56 Tigretes , who was Brother of Queen Artemisia , and whose Name has been so far mingled with his, as to make him be esteem'd Author of some of the lesser works which are ascrib'd to Homer . It may not be amiss to close these Criticisms with that agreeable Derision wherewith Lucian treats the over-busy Humour of Grammarians in their Search after minute and impossible Enquiries, when he feigns, that he had talk'd over the Point with Homer in the Island of the Blessed . "I ask'd him, says he, of what Country he was? a Question hard to be resolv'd with Us : to which he answer'd, He could not certainly tell, because some had inform'd him, that he was of Chios , some of Smyrna , and others of Colophon ; but lie took himself for a Babylonian ; called Tigranes , while he liv'd among his Countrymen, and Homer , while he was an Hostage among the Gr aecians ." 57 At his Birth he appears not to have been blind , whatever he might be afterwards. The  58 Chian Medal of him (which is of great Antiquity, according to Leo Allatius ) seats him with a Volume open, and reading intently : But there is no need of Proofs from Antiquity for that which every Line of his Works will demonstrate. With what an Exactness, agreeable to the natural Appearance of Things, do his Cities stand, his Mountains rise, his Rivers wind, and his Regions lie extended? How beautifully are the Surfaces of all things drawn in their Figures, and adorn'd with their Paintings? What Address in Action, what visible Characters of the Passions inspirit his Heroes? It is not to be imagin'd, that a Man could have been always blind, who thus inimitably copies Nature, who gives every where the proper Proportion, Figure, Colour, and Life : " Quem si quis c aecuus genitum putat (says  59 Paterculus) omnibus sensibus orbus est:" He must certainly have beheld the Creation, consider'd it with a long Attention, and enrich'd his Fancy by the most sensible Knowledge of those Ideas which he makes the Reader see while he but describes them. 60 As he grew forward in Years, he was train'd up to Learning. (if we credit  61 Diodorus ) under one " Pronapides , a Man of excellent natural Endowments, who taught the Pelasgick Letter invented by Linus ." From him might he learn to preserve his Poetry by committing it to Writing; which we mention, because it is generally believ'd  62 no Poems before his were so preserv'd; and he himself in the third Line of his Batrachomuomachia (if that Piece be allow'd to be his) expressly speaks of 63 writing his Works in his Tablets . 64 When he was of riper Years, for his farther Accomplishment, and the Gratification of his Thirst of Knowledge, he spent a considerable part of his time in travelling. Upon which account  65 Proclus has taken notice that he must have abounded in Riches : "For long Travels, says he, occasion high Expences, and especially at those times when Men could neither sail without imminent Danger and Inconveniences, nor had a regulated manner of Commerce with one another." This way of reasoning appears very probable; and if it does not prove him to have been rich, it shews him, at least, to have had Patrons of a generous Spirit, who, observing the Vastness of his Capacity, believ'd themselves beneficent to Mankind, while they supported one who seem'd born for something extraordinary. Æ gypt being at that time the Seat of Learning, the greatest Wits and Genius's of Greece us'd to travel thither. Among these  66 Diodorus reckons Homer , and to strengthen his Opinion, alledges that Multitude of their Notions which he has receiv'd into his Poetry, and of their Customs, to which he alludes in his Fictions : Such as his Gods , which are nam'd from the first Æ gyptian Kings ; the Number of the Muses taken from the nine Minestrels which attended Osyris ; the Feast wherein they us'd to send their Statues of the Deities into Æ thiopia , and to return after twelve Days; and the carrying their dead Bodies over the Lake to a pleasant Place call'd Acherasia near Memphis ; from whence arose the Stories of Charon, Styx , and Elysium . These are Notions which so abound in him, as to make  67 Herodotus say, He had introduc'd from thence the Religion of Greece . And if others have believ'd he was an Æ gyptian , from his Knowledge of their Rites and Traditions which were reveal'd but to few; and of the Arts and Customs which were practis'd among them in general; it may prove at least thus much, that he was there in his Travels. As Greece was in all Probability his native Country, and had then began to make an Effort for Learning, we cannot doubt but he travel'd there also, with a particular Observation. He uses the different Dialects which were spoken in its different Parts, as one who had been conversant with them all. But the Argument which appears most irrefragable, is to be taken from his Catalogue of the Ships: He has there given us an exact Geography of Greece ; where its Cities, Mountains, and Plains, are particularly mention'd; where the Courses of its Rivers are trac'd out; where the Countrys are laid in order, their Bounds assign'd, and the uses of their Soils specify'd; which the Ancients, who compar'd it with the Original, have allow'd to be so true in all Points, that it could never have been owing to a loose and casual Information. Even Strabo's Account of Greece is but a kind of Commentary upon Homer 's. We may carry this Argument farther, to suppose his having been round Asia Minor , from his exact Division of the Regnum Priami vetus (as Horace calls it) into its separate Dynasties , and, the Account he gives of the bordering Nations in Alliance with it. Perhaps too, in the Wandrings of Ulysses about Sicily , whose Ports and neighbouring Islands are mention'd, he might contrive to send his Heroe where he had made his own Voyage before. Nor will the Fables he has intermingled be any Objection to his having travel'd in those Parts, since they are not related as the History of the present time, but the Tradition of the former. His mention of Thrace , his Description of the Beasts of Lybia , and of the Climate in the Fortunate Islands , may seem also to give us a view of him in the Extreams of the Earth, where it was not barbarous or uninhabited. It is hard to set limits to the Travels of a Man, who has set none to that desire of Knowledge which made him undertake them. Who can say what People he has not seen, who appears to be vers'd in the Customs of all? He takes the Globe for the Scene in which he introduces his Subjects; he launches forward intrepidly, like one to whom no place is new, and appears a Citizen of the World in general. When he return'd from his Travels, he seems to have apply'd himself to the finishing his Poems, however he might have either design'd, begun, or pursu'd them before. In these he has treasur'd up his various Acquisitions of Knowledge, where they have been preserv'd through Ages, to be as well the Proofs of his own Industry, as the Instructions of Posterity. He might then describe his Sacrifices after the Æolian manner; or  68 his Leagues with a Mixture of Trojan and Spartan Ceremonies :  69 He could then compare the Confusion of a Multitude to that Tumult he had observ'd in the Icarian Sea, dashing and breaking among its Crowd of Islands : He could represent the Numbers of an Army, by those Flocks of  70 Swans he had seen on the Banks of the Cayster; or being to describe that Heat of Battel with which Achilles drove the Trojans into the River,  71 he could illustrate it with an Allusion from Cyrene or Cyprus, where, when the Inhabitants burn'd their Fields, the Grass-hoppers fled before the Fire to perish in the Ocean. His Fancy being fully replenish'd, might supply him with every proper occasional Image, and his Soul after having enlarg'd itself, and taken in an extensive Variety of the Creation, might be equal to the Task of an Iliad and an Odysses . 72 In his Age , we hear he fell blind, and settled at Chios , as he says in the Hymn to Apollo , which (as is before observ'd) is acknowledg'd for his by Thucydides , and might occasion both Simonides and Theocritus to call him a Chian.  73 Strabo relates, That Lycurgus , the great Legislator of Sparta , was reported to have gone to Chios to have a Conference with Homer , after he had study'd the Laws of Crete and Æ gypt in order to form his Constitutions. If this be true, how much a nobler Representation does it give of him, and indeed more agreeable to what we conceive of this mighty Genius, than those spurious Accounts which keep him down among the meanest of Mankind? What an Idea could we frame to our selves of a Conversation, held between two Persons so considerable; a Philosopher conscious of the Force of Poetry, and a Poet knowing in the Depths of Philosophy; both their Souls improv'd with Learning, both eminently rais'd above little Designs, or the meaner kind of Interest, and meeting together to consult the Good of Mankind? But in this, I have only indulg'd a Thought which is not to be insisted upon; the Evidence of History rather tends to prove that Lycurgus brought his Works from Asia after his Death : which  74 Proclus imagines to have happen'd at a great old Age, on account of his Circumference of Learning, for which a short Life could never Suffice. 75 If we would now make a Conjecture concerning the Genius and Temper of this great Man; perhaps his Works, which would not furnish us with Facts for his Life, will be more reasonably made use of to give us a Picture of his Mind : To this end therefore, we may suffer the very Name and Notion of a Book to vanish for a while, and look upon what is left us as a Conversation, in order to gain an Acquaintance with Homer . Perhaps the general Air of his Works will become the general Character of his Genius, and the particular Observations give some Light to the particular Turns of his Temper. His comprehensive Knowledge shews that his Soul was not form'd like a narrow Chanel for a single Stream, but as an Expanse which might receive an Ocean into its Bosom; that he had the strongest Desire of Improvement, and an unbounded Curiosity, which made its Advantage of every transient Circumstance, or obvious Accident. His solid and sententious Manner may make us admire him for a Man of Judgment; one who, in the darkest Ages, could enter far into a Disquisition of human Nature; who, notwithstanding all the Changes which Governments, Manners, Rites, and even the Notions of Virtue have undergone, could still abound with so many Maxims correspondent to Truth, and Notions applicable to so many Sciences. The Fire, which is so observable in his Poem, as to give every thing the most active Appearance, may make us naturally conjecture him to have been of a warm Temper, and lively Behaviour; and the pleasurable Air which every where overspreads it, may give us reason to think, that Fire of Imagination was temper'd with Sweetness and Affability. If we farther observe the Particulars he treats of, and imagine that he laid a Stress upon the Sentiments he delivers, pursuant to his real Opinions; we shall take him to be of a religious Spirit, by his inculcating in almost every Page the worship of the Gods. We shall imagine him to be a generous Lover of his Countrey, from his care to extol it every where : which is carry'd to such a heighth, as to make  76 Plutarch observe, That though many of the Barbarians are made Prisoners or Suppliants, yet neither of these disgraceful Accidents (which are common to all Nations in War) ever happens to one Greek throughout his Works. We shall take him to be a compassionate Lover of Mankind, from his numberless Praises of Hospitality and Charity; (if indeed we are not to account for'em, as the common Writers of his Life imagine, from his owing his Support to these Virtues.) It might seem from his Love of Stories, with his manner of telling them sometimes, that he gave his own Picture when he painted his Nestor , and, as wise as he was, was no Enemy to Talking. One would think from his Praises of Wine, his copious Goblets, and pleasing Descriptions of Banquets, that he was addicted to a chearful, sociable Life, which Horace takes notice of as a kind of Tradition; " Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus." Ep . 19 l . I. And that he was not (as may be guess'd of Virgil from his Works) average to the Female Sex , will appear from his care to paint them amiably upon all occasions : His Andromache and Penelope are in each of his Poems most shining Characters of conjugal Affection; even his Helena herself is drawn with all the Softenings imaginable; his Souldiers are exhorted to combat with the hopes of Women ; his Commanders are furnish'd with fair Slaves in their Tents, nor is the venerable Nestor without a Mistress . It is true, that in this way of turning a Book into a Man , this reasoning from his Works to himself, we can at best but hit off a few Out-strokes of a Character : Wherefore I shall decline the carrying it into more minute Points, and conclude with one Discovery which we may make from his Silence , a Discovery extreamly proper to be made in this manner, which is, that he was of a very modest Temper. There is in all other Poets a Custom of speaking of themselves, and a Vanity of promising Eternity to their Writings. In both which Homer , who has the best Title to speak out, is altogether silent. As to the last of them, the World has made him ample Recompence; it has given him that Eternity he would not promise himself : But whatever Endeavours have been offer'd in respect of the former, we find our selves still under an irreparable Loss. That which others have said of him has amounted to no more than Conjecture; that which I have said is no farther to be insisted on : I have us'd the liberty which is indulg'd me by Precedent, to give in my Opinions among the Accounts of others, and the World may be pleas'd to receive them as so many willing Endeavours to gratify its Curiosity. 77 The only uncontestable Works which Homer has left behind him are the Iliad and Odysses: The Batrachomuomachia , or Battle of the Frogs and Mice , has been disputed, but is however allow'd for his by many great Authorities; amongst whom  78 Statius has reckon'd it like the Culex of Virgil , a Trial of his Force before his larger Performances. It is indeed a beautiful Piece of Raillery, in which a great Writer may delight to unbend himself; an Instance of that agreeable Trifling , which has been at some time or other indulg'd by the finest Genius's , and the Offspring of that amusing and chearful Humour, which generally accompanies the Character of a rich Imagination, like a Vein of Mercury running mingled with a Mine of Gold . The Hymns have been doubted also, and attributed by the Scholiasts to Cyn aethus the Rbapsodist; but notwithstanding the Tradition, neither  79 Thucydides ,  80 Lucian , nor  81 Pausanias , have scrupled to cite them as genuine. We have the Authority of the two former for that to Apollo , tho' it be observ'd that the word ![](/images/inline/Ngk.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  is found in it, which the Book de Poesi Homeric a (ascrib'd to Plutarch ) tells us, was not in use in Homer 's Time. We have also an Authority of the last for a  82 Hymn to Ceres , of which he has given us a Fragment. That to Mars is objected against for mentioning ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , and that which is the first to Minerva for using ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif)  , both of them being (according to the Author of the Treatise before mention'd) words of a later Invention. The Hymn to Venus has many of its Lines copy'd by Virgil in the Enterview between Æ neas, and that Goddess in the first Æ neid: But whether these Hymns are Homer 's or not, they are always judg'd to be near as ancient, if not of the same Age with him. The Epigrams are extracted out of the Life said to be written by Herodotus , and we leave them as such to stand or fall with it; except the Epitaph on Midas , which is of very ancient Authority, quoted without its Author both by  83 Plato and  84 Longinus , and (according to  85 Laertius ) ascrib'd by Simonides to Cleobulus the wise Man; who living long after Homer answers better to the Age of Midas the Son of Gordias . The Margites , which is lost, is said by  86 Aristotle to have been a Poem of a comick Nature, wherein Homer made use of Iambick Verses as proper for Raillery. It was a Jest upon the Fair Sex, and had its Name from one Margites , a weak Man who was the Subject of it. The Story is something loose, as may be seen by the Account of it still preserv'd in  87 Eustathius 's Comment on the Odysses . The Cercopes was a Satyrical Work which is also lost; we may however imagine it was level'd against the Vices of Men, if our Conjecture be right that it was founded upon the old Fable of the Cercopes , a Nation who were turn'd into Monkies for their Frauds and Impostures. The Destruction of OEchalia , was a Poem of which (according to Eustathius ) Hercules was the Heroe; and the Subject, his ravaging that Countrey; because Eurytus the King had deny'd him his Daughter Iole . The Ilias Minor was a Piece which included both the taking of Troy , and the return of the Gr aecians ; In this was the Story of Sinon , which Virgil has made use of :  88 Aristotle has judg'd it not to belong to Homer . The Cypriacks , if it was upon them that Nevius founded his Ilias Cypria , (as  89 Mr. Dacier conjectures) were the Love Adventures of the Ladies at the Siege : these are rejected by  90 Herodotus , for saying that Paris brought Helen to Troy in three Days; whereas Homer asserts they were long driven from Place to Place. There are also other Things ascrib'd to him, such as the Heptapection Goat , the Arachnomachia ,  &c. in the ludicrous Manner; and the Thebais, Epigoni , or second Siege of Thebes , the Phocais, Amazonia ,  &c. in the serious : which, if they were his, are now to be reputed a real Loss to the learned World. Time, in some Things, may have prevail'd over Homer himself, and left only the Names of these Works as Memorials that such were in being; but while the Iliad and Odysses remain, he seems like a Leader, who, tho' he may have fail'd in a Skirmish, has carry'd a Victory, for which he passes in Triumph through all future Ages. 91 THE Remains we have at present of those Monuments Antiquity had fram'd for him, are but few. It could not be thought that they who knew so little of the Life of Homer , could have a right Knowledge of his Person; yet had they Statues of him as of their Gods, whose Forms they had never seen. " Quinim o quae non sunt, finguntur (says  92 Pliny ) pa riuntque desideria non traditi vult us , sicut in Homero evenit." But tho' the ancient Portraits of him seem purely notional, yet they agree (as I think  93 Fabretti has observ'd) in representing him with a short curl'd Beard, and distinct Marks of Age in his Forehead. That which is prefix'd to this Book, is taken from an ancient Marble Bust, in the Palace of Farnese at Rome . In Bollissus near Chios there is a Ruin, which was shown for the House of Homer , which  94 Leo Allatius went on Pilgrimage to visit, and (as he tells us) found nothing but a few Stones crumbling away with Age, over which he and his Companions wept for Satisfaction. They erected Temples to Homer in Smyrna , as appears from  95 Cicero ; one of these is supposed to be yet extant, and the same which they show for the Temple of Janus . It agrees with  96 Strabo's Description, a square Building of Stone, near a River, thought to be the Meles , with two Doors opposite to each other, North and South, and a large Niche within the East-Wall, where the Image stood : But M. Spon denies this to be the true Hom aerium . Of the Medals struck for him, there are some both of Chios and Smyrna still in being, and exhibited at the beginning of this Essay. The most valuable with respect to the Largeness of the Head is that of Amastris , which is carefully copied from an Original belonging to the present Earl of Pembroke , and is the same which Gronovius Cuperus and Dacier have Copies of, but very incorrectly performed. But that which of all the Remains has been of late the chief Amusement of the Learned, is the Marble call'd his Apotheosis , the Work of Archelaus of Priene , and now in the Palace of Colonna . We see there a Temple hung with its Veil, where Homer is plac'd on a Seat with a Footstool to it, as he has describ'd the Seats of his Gods; supported on each side with Figures known for the Iliad and the Odysses , the one by the Sword, the other by the Ornament of a Ship, which denotes the Voyages of Ulysses . On each side of his Footstool are Mice , in Allusion to the Batrachomuomachia . Behind, is Time waiting upon him, and a Figure with Turrets on its Head, which signifies the World , crowning him with the Laurel. Before him is an Altar, at which all the Arts are sacrificing to him as to their Deity. On one side of the Altar stands a Boy, representing Mythology , on the other, a Woman, representing History ; after her is Poetry bringing the Sacred Fire; and in a long following Train, Tragedy, Comedy, Nature, Virtue, Memory, Rhetorick , and Wisdom ; in all their proper Attitudes. Life, I shall proceed to that of his Works; and considering him no longer as a Man , but as an Author , prosecute the Thread of his Story in this his second Life, thro' the different Degrees of Esteem which those Writings have obtain'd in different Periods of Time. It has been the fortune of several great Genius's not to be known while they liv'd, either for want of Historians, the Meanness of Fortune, or the Love of Retirement, to which a Poetical Temper is peculiarly addicted. Yet after Death their Works give themselves a Life in Fame, without the help of an Historian; and, notwithstanding the Meanness of their Author, or his Love of Retreat, they go forth among Mankind, the Glories of that Age which produc'd them, and the Delight of those which follow it. This is a Fate particularly verify'd in Homer , than whom no considerable Author is less known as to himself, or more highly valu'd as to his Productions. 97 The earliest Account of these is said by  98 Plutarch to be some time after his Death, when Lycurgus sail'd to Asia ; "There he had the first sight of Homer 's Works, which were probably preserv'd by the Grand-children of Creophilus ; and having observ'd that their pleasurable Air of Fiction did not hinder the Poets abounding in Maxims of State, and Rules of Morality, he transcrib'd and carry'd with him that entire Collection we have now among us : For at that time (continues this Author) there was only an obscure Rumour in Greece to the Reputation of these Poems, and but a few scatter'd Fragments handed about, 'till Lycurgus publish'd them entire." Thus they were in danger of being lost as soon as they were produced, by the Misfortune of the Age, a want of Taste in Learning, or the manner in which they were left to Posterity, when they fell into the Hands of Lycurgus . He was a Man of great Learning, a Law-giver to a People divided and untractable, and one who had a Notion that Poetry influenc'd and civiliz'd the Minds of Men; which made him smooth the way to his Constitution by the Songs of Thales the Cretan , whom he engag'd to write upon Obedience and Concord. As he propos'd to himself that the Constitution he would raise upon this their Union should be of a martial Nature, these Poems were of an extraordinary Value to him : for they came with a full Force into his Scheme; the Moral they inspir'd was Unity; the Air they breath'd was Martial; and their Story had this particular Engagement for the Laced aemonians , that it shew'd Greece in War, and Asia subdu'd under the Conduct of one of their own Monarchs, who commanded all the Gr aecian Princes. Thus the Poet both pleas'd the Law-giver, and the People : from whence he had a double Influence when the Laws were settled. For his Poem then became a Panegyrick on their Constitution, as well as a Register of their Glory; and confirm'd them in the Love of it by a gallant Description of those Qualities and Actions for which it was adapted. This made  99 Cleomenes call him The Poet of the Laced aemonians : And therefore when we remember that Homer owed the Publication of his Works to Lycurgus , we should grant too, that Lycurgus owed in some degree the Enforcement of his Laws to the Works of Homer . 100 At their first Appearance in Greece, they were not digested into a regular Body, but remain'd as they were brought over in several detach'd Pieces, call'd (according to  101 Æ lian ) from the Subject on which they treated; as the Battle at the Ships , the Death of Dolon, the Valour of Agamemnon, the Patroclea, the Grot of Calypso, Slaughter of the Wooers , and the like. Nor were these entitled Books , but Rhapsodies ; from whence they who sung them had the Title of Rhapsodists It was in this manner they began to be disperst, while their Poetry, their History, the Glory they ascrib'd to Greece in general, the particular Description they gave of it, and the Compliment they paid to every little State by an honourable mention, so influenc'd all, that they were transcrib'd and sung with general Approbation. But what seems to have most recommended them was, that Greece which could not be great in its divided Condition, looked upon the Fable of them as a likely Plan of future Grandeur. They seem from thenceforward to have had an Eye upon the Conquest of Asia ; as a proper Undertaking which by its Importance might occasion Union enough to give a Diversion from Civil Wars, and by its Prosecution bring in an Acquisition of Honour and Empire. This is the meaning of  102 Isocrates , when he tells us, That " Homer's Poetry was in the greater Esteem, because it gave exceeding Praise to those who sought against the Barbarians . Our Ancestors (continues he) honour'd it with a Place in Education and musical Contests, that by often hearing it we should have a Notion of an original Enmity between us and those Nations; and that admiring the Virtue of those who sought at Troy , we should be induc'd to emulate their Glory." And indeed they never quitted this thought, 'till they had successfully carry'd their Arms where-ever Homer might thus excite them. 103 But while his Works were suffer'd to lie in an unconnected manner, the Chain of Story was not always perceiv'd, so that they lost much of their Force and Beauty by being read disorderly. Wherefore as Laced aemon had the first Honour of their Publication by Lycurgus , that of their Regulation fell to the share of Athens in the time of  104 Solon , who himself made a Law for their recital. It was then that Pisistratus , the Tyrant of Athens , who was a Man of great Learning and Eloquence (as  105 Cicero has it) first put together the confus'd Parts of Homer , according to that Regularity in which they are now handed down to us. He divided them into the two different Works, entitled the Iliad and Odysses ; he digested each according to the Author's design, to make their Plans become evident; and distinguish'd each again into twenty four Books, to which were afterwards prefix'd the twenty four Letters. There is a Passage indeed in  106 Plato , which takes this Work from Pisistratus , by giving it to his Son Hypparchus ; with this addition, that he commanded them to be sung at the Feast call'd Panathen aea . Perhaps it may be, as  107 Leo Allatius has imagin'd, because the Son publish'd the Copy more correctly : This he offers, to reconcile so great a Testimony as Plato's to the Cloud of Witnesses which are against him in it : But be that as it will, Athens still claims its proper Honour of rescuing the Father of Learning from the Injuries of Time, of having restor'd Homer to himself, and given the World a view of him in his Perfection. So that if his Verses were before admir'd for their Use and Beauty , as the Stars were before they were consider'd in a System of Science; they are now admir'd much more for their graceful Harmony , and that Sphere of Order in which they appear to move. They became henceforward more the Pleasure of the Wits of Greece ; more the Subject of their Studies, and the Employment of their Pens. About the time that this new Edition of Homer was publish'd in Athens , there was one Cyn aethus , a learned Rhapsodist , who (as the  108 Scholiast of Pindar informs us) settled first at Syracuse in that Employment; and if (as Leo Allatius believes) he had been before an Assistant in the Edition, he may be suppos'd to have first carry'd it abroad. But it was not long preserv'd correct among his Followers; they committed Mistakes in their Transcriptions and Repetitions, and had even the Presumption to alter some Lines, and interpolate others. Thus the Works of Homer ran the danger of being utterly defac'd; which made it become the concern of Kings and Philosophers, that they should be restor'd to their Primitive Beauty. 109 In the Front of these is Alexander the Great , for whom they will appear peculiarly calculated, if we consider that no Books more enliven or flatter personal Valour, which was great in him to what we call Romantick : Neither has any Book more places applicable to his Designs on Asia , or (as it happen'd) to his Actions there. It was then no ill Compliment in  110 Aristotle to purge the Iliad , upon his account, from those Errors and Additions which had crept into it. And so far was Alexander himself from esteeming it a Matter of small Importance, that he afterwards  111 assisted in a strict Review of it with Anaxarchus and Calisthenes ; whether it was meerly because he esteem'd it a Treasury of military Virtue and Knowledge; or that (according to a late ingenious Conjecture) he had a farther Aim, in promoting the Propagation of it when he was ambitious to be esteem'd a Son of Jupiter ; as a Book which treating of the Sons of the Gods, might make the Intercourse between them and Mortals become a familiar Notion. The Review being finish'd, he laid it up in a Casket which was found among the Spoils of Darius as what best deserv'd so inestimable a Case , and from this Circumstance it was nam'd The Edition of the Casket . 112 The Place where the Works of Homer were next found in the greatest Regard, is Æ gypt , under the Reign of the Ptolomys . These Kings being descended from Greece retain'd always a Passion for their original Country. The Men, the Books, the Qualifications of it, were in esteem in their Court; they preserv'd the Language in their Family; they encourag'd a Concourse of learned Men; erected the greatest Library in the World; and train'd up their Princes under Gr aecian Tutors; among whom the most considerable were appointed for Revisers of Homer . The first of these was  113 Zenodotus , Library-Keeper to the first Ptolomy , and qualify'd for this Undertaking by being both a Poet, and a Grammarian; a compounded Character in which there was Fancy for a Discovery of Beauties, and a minuter Judgment for a Detection of Faults. But neither his Copy nor that which his Disciple Aristophanes had made, satisfying Aristarchus , (whom Ptolomy Philometor had appointed over his Son Euergetes ) he set himself to another Correction with all the Wit and Learning he was Master of. He restor'd some Verses to their former Readings, rejected others which he mark'd with Obelisks as spurious, and proceeded with such industrious Accuracy, that, notwithstanding there were some who wrote against his Performance, Antiquity has generally acquiesc'd in it. Nay, so far have they carry'd their Opinion in his favour, as to call a Man an  114 Aristarchus when they meant to say a candid, judicious Critick; in the same manner as they call the contrary a Zoilus , from that Zoilus who about this time wrote an envious Criticism against Homer . And now we mention these two together, I fancy it will be no small Pleasure to the benevolent Part of Mankind, to see how their Characters stand in Contrast to each other, for Examples to future Ages, at the head of the two contrary sorts of Criticism, which proceed from good Nature, or from ill Will. The one was honour'd with the Offices and Countenance of the Court; the other,  115 when he apply'd to the same Place for an Encouragement amongst the Men of Learning, had his Petition rejected : The one had his Fame continu'd to Posterity; the other is only remember'd with Infamy: If the one had Antagonists, they were oblig'd to pay him the deference of a formal Answer; the other was never answer'd but in general, with those opprobrious Names of Thracian Slave and Rhetorical Dog: The one is suppos'd to have his Copy still remaining; while the other' s Remarks are perish'd as things that Men were asham'd to preserve, the just Desert of whatever arises from the miserable Principles of ill Will or Envy. 116 It was not the Ambition of Æ gypt only to have a correct Edition of Homer . We find in the  117 Life of the Poet Aratus , that he, having finish'd a Copy of the Odysses, was sent for by Antiochus King of Syria , and entertain'd by him while he finish'd one of the Iliad . We read too of others which were publish'd with the Names of Countrys; such as the  118 Massaliotick and Synopick: as if the World were agreed to make his Works in their Survival undergo the same Fate with himself; and that as different Cities contended for his Birth, so they might again contend for his true Edition. But though these Reviews were not peculiar to Æ gypt , the greatest Honour was theirs, in that universal Approbation which the Performance of Aristarchus receiv'd; and if it be not his Edition which we have at present, we know not to whom to ascribe it. 119 But the World was not contented barely to have settled an Edition of his Works. There were innumerable Comments in which they were open'd like a Treasury of Learning; and Translations whereby other Languages became enrich'd by an Infusion of his Spirit of Poetry.  120 Æ lian tells us, that even the Indians had them in their Tongue, and the Persian Kings sung them in theirs.  121 Persius mentions a Version into Latin by Labeo , and in general the Passages and Imitations which are taken from him, are so numerous that he may be said to have been translated by piecemeal into that, and all other Languages. Which affords us this Remark, that there is hardly any thing in him, which has not been pitch'd upon by some Author or other for a particular Beauty. 122 It is almost incredible to what an Height the Idea of that Veneration the Ancients paid to Homer will arise, to one who reads particularly with this view, through all these Periods. He was no sooner come from his Obscurity, but Greece receiv'd him with Delight and Profit : There were then but few Books to divide their Attention, and none which had a better Title to engross it all. They made some daily Discoveries of his Beauties, which were still promoted in their different Channels by the favourite Qualities of different Nations. Sparta and Macedon consider'd him most in respect of his warlike Spirit; Athens and Æ gypt ; with regard to his Poetry and Learning ; and all their Endeavours united under the Hands of the Learned, to make him blaze forth into an universal Character. His Works, which from the beginning pass'd for excellent Poetry , grew to be History and Geography ; they rose to be a Magazine of Sciences ; were exalted into a Scheme of Religion ; gave a Sanction to whatever Rites they mention'd; were quoted in all Cases for the Conduct of Life , and learned by Heart as the very Book of Belief and Practice. From him the Poets drew their Inspirations, the Criticks their Rules, and the Philosophers a Defence of their Opinions : Every Author was fond to use his Name; and every Profession writ Books upon him, 'till they swell'd to Libraries. The Warriors form'd themselves by his Heroes, and the Oracles deliver'd his Verses for Answers. Nor was Mankind satisfy'd to have thus seated his Character at the top of human Wisdom, but being overborn with an imagination that he transcended their Species, they admitted him to share in those Honours they gave the Deities. They instituted Games for him, dedicated Statues, erected Temples, as at Smyrna , Chios and Alexandria ; and  123 Æ lian tells us, That when the Argives sacrific'd with their Guests, they us'd to invoke the Presence of Apollo and Homer together. 124 Thus he was settled on a Foot of Adoration, and continu'd highly venerated in the Roman Empire, when Christianity began. Heathenism was then to be destroy'd, and Homer appear'd the Father of it; whose Fictions were at once the Belief of the Pagan Religion, and the Objections of Christianity against it. He became therefore very deeply involv'd in the Question; and not with that Honour which hitherto attended him, but as a Criminal who had drawn the World into Folly. He was on one hand accus'd for having fram'd  125 Fables upon the Works of Moses ; as the Rebellion of the Giants from the building of Babel , and the casting At e or Strife out of Heaven from the Fall of Lucifer . He was expos'd on the other hand for those which he is said to invent, as when  126 Arnobius crys out, "This is the Man who wounded your Venus , imprison'd your Mars , who free'd even your Jupiter by Briareus , and who finds Authorities for all your Vices,"  &c. Mankind was  127 derided for whatever he had hitherto made them believe; and  128 Plato , who expell'd him his Commonwealth, has, of all the Philosophers, found the best Quarter from the Fathers, for passing that Sentence. His finest Beauties began to take a new Appearance of pernicious Qualities; and because they might be consider'd as Allurements to Fancy, or Supports to those Errors with which they were mingled, they were to be depreciated while the Contest of Faith was in being. It was hence, that the reading them was discourag'd, that we hear Ruffinus accusing St. Jerome for it, and that  129 St. Austin rejects him as the grand Master of Fable; tho' indeed the dulcissim e vanus which he applies to Homer , looks but like a fondling manner of parting with him. This strong Attack against our Author oblig'd those Philosophers who could have acquiesc'd as his Admirers, to appear as his Defenders; who because they saw the Fables could not be literally supported, endeavour'd to find a hidden Sense, and to carry on every where that Vein of Allegory which was already broken open with Success in some Places. But how miserably were they forc'd to Shifts, when they made  130 Juno's dressing in the Cestos for Jupiter to signify the purging of the Air as it approach'd the Fire ? Or the Story of Mars and Venus , that Inclination they have to Incontinency who are born when these Planets are in Conjunction? Wit and Learning had here a large Field to display themselves, and to disagree in : for sometimes Jupiter , and sometimes Vulcan , was made to signify the Fire ; or Mars and Venus were allow'd to give us a Lecture of Morality at one time, and a Problem of Astronomy at another. And these strange Discoveries, which  131 Porphyry and the rest would have to pass for the genuine Theology of the Greeks , prove but (as  132 Eusebius terms it) the perverting of Fables into a mystick Sense. They did indeed often defend Homer , but then they allegorized away their Gods by doing so. What the World took for substantial Objects of Adoration, dissolv'd before its Eyes into a figurative Meaning, a moral Truth, or a Piece of Learning which might equally correspond to any Religion; and the Learned at last had left themselves nothing to worship, when they came to find an Object in Christianity. 133 The Dispute of Faith being over, ancient Learning re-assumed its Dignity, and Homer obtain'd his proper Place in the Esteem of Mankind. His Books are now no longer the Scheme of a living Religion, but become the Register of one of former Times. They are not now receiv'd for a Rule of Life, but valu'd for those just Observations which are dispers'd through them. They are no longer pronounc'd from Oracles, but quoted still by Authors for their Learning. Those Remarks which the Philosophers made upon them, have their Weight with us; those Beauties which the Poets dwell'd upon, their Admiration : And even after the Abatement of what was extravagant in his Run of Praise, he remains confessedly a mighty Genius not transcended by any which have since arisen; a Prince, as well as a Father, of Poetry. 134 It remains in this Historical Essay, to regulate our present Opinion of Homer by a view of his Learning, compar'd with that of his Age. For this end he may first be consider'd as a Poet, that Character which was his professedly; and secondly as one endow'd with other Sciences, which must be spoken of not as in themselves, but as in Subserviency to his main Design. Thus he will be seen on his right Foot of Perfection in one view, and with the just Allowances which should be made on the other : While we pass through the several Heads of Science, the State of those Times in which he writ will show us both the Impediments he rose under, and the Reasons why several things in him which have been objected to, either could not, or should not be otherwise than they are. 135 As for the State of Poetry , it was at a low Pitch in the Age of Homer . There is mention of Orpheus , Linus , and Mus aeus , venerable Names in Antiquity, and eminently celebrated in Fable for the wonderful Power of their Songs and Musick. The learned Fabricius , in his Bibliotheca Gr aeca , has reckon'd about seventy who are said to have written before Homer: but their Works were not preserv'd, and can be only consider'd (if they were really excellent) as the Happiness of their own Generation. What sort of Poets Homer saw in his own Time may be gather'd from his Description of  136 Demodocus and Phemius , whom he has introduc'd as Opportunities to celebrate his Profession. The imperfect Risings of the Art lay then among the Extempore -Singers of Stories at Banquets, who were half Singers, half Musicians. Nor was the Name of Poet then in being, or once us'd throughout Homer 's Works. From this poor State of Poetry, he has taken a handle to usher it into the World with the boldest Stroke of Praise which has ever been given it. It is in the eighth Odyssey , where Ulysses puts Demodocus upon a trial of Skill. Demodocus having diverted the Guests with some Actions of the Trojan War; "  137 All this (says Ulysses ) you have sung very elegantly, as if you had either been present, or heard it reported; but pass now to a Subject I shall give you, sing the Management of Ulysses in the wooden Horse, just as it happen'd, and I will acknowledge the Gods have taught you your Songs." This the Singer being inspir'd from Heaven begins immediately, and Ulysses by weeping at the recital confesses t he Truth of it. We see here a Narration which could only pass upon an Age extreamly ignorant in the Nature of Poetry, where that Claim of Inspiration is given to it, which it has never since laid down, and (which is more) a Power of prophecying at pleasure ascrib'd to it. Thus much therefore we gather from himself concerning the most ancient State of Poetry in Greece ; that no one was honour'd with the Name of Poet, before Him whom it has especially belong'd to ever after. And if we farther appeal to the consent of Authors, we find he has other Titles for being call'd the first.  138 Josephus observes, That the Greeks have not contested but he was the most ancient, whose Books they had in Writing.  139 Aristotle says, He was the "first who brought all the Parts of a Poem into one Piece," to which he adds, "with true Judgment," to give him a Praise including both the Invention and Perfection. And Horace acquaints us, that he invented the very Measure which is call'd Heroick from the Subjects on which he employ'd it; Res gest ae regumque, ducumque, & fortia bella, Quo scribi possint numero monstravit Homerus 140 Whatever was serious or magnificent made a part of his Subject : War and Peace were the comprehensive Division in which he consider'd the World; and the Plans of his Poems were founded on the most active Scenes of each, the Adventures of a Siege, and the Accidents of a Voyage. For these his Spirit was equally active and various, lofty in Expression, clear in Narration, natural in Description, rapid in Action, abundant in Figures. If ever he appears less- than himself, it is from the Time he writ in; and if he runs into Errors, it is from an Excess, rather than a Defect of Genius. Thus he rose over the Poetical World, shining out like a Sun all at once, which if it sometimes make too faint an Appearance, 'tis to be ascrib'd only to the necessity of the Season that keeps it at a distance; and if he is sometimes too violent , we confess at the same time that we owe all things to his Heat. 141 As for his Theology , we see the Heathen System entirely follow'd. This was all he could then have to work upon, and where he fails of Truth for want of Revelation he at least shows his Knowledge in his own Religion by the Traditions he delivers. But we are now upon a Point to be farther handled, because the greatest Controversy concerning the Merit of Homer depends upon it. Let us consider then that there was an Age in Greece , when natural Reason only discover'd there must be something superior to us, and Tradition had affix'd the Notion to a Number of Deities. At this time Homer rose with the finest Turn imaginable for Poetry, who designing to instruct Mankind in the manner for which he was most adapted, writ Poems wherein he made use of the Ministry of the Gods to give the highest Air of Surprize and Veneration to his Writings. He found the Religion of Mankind wrapt up in Fables; it was thought then the easiest way to convey Morals to the People, who were allur'd to Attention by Pleasure, and aw'd with the Opinion of a hidden Mystery. Nor was it his Business when he undertook the Province of a Poet (not of a meer Philosopher) to be the first who should discard That which furnishes Poetry with its most beautiful Appearance : and especially since the Age he liv'd in, by discovering its Taste, had not only given him Authority, but even put him under the necessity of preserving it. Whatever therefore he might think of his Gods, he took them as he found them : he brought them into Action according to the Notions which were then entertain'd, and in some Stories as they were then believ'd; unless we imagine that he invented every thing he delivers. Yet there are several Rays of Truth streaming through all this Darkness, in those Sentiments he entertains concerning the Gods; and several Allegories lightly veil'd over, from whence the learned drew new Knowledges, each according to his Power of Penetration and Fancy. But that we may the better comprehend him in all the Parts of this general View, let us extract from him a Scheme of his Religion. He has a Jupiter , a Father of Gods and Men , whom he makes supream, and to whom he applies several Attributes, as Wisdom, Justice, Knowledge, Power, &c. which are essentially inherent to the Idea of a God.  142 He has given him two Vessels , out of which he distributes natural Good or Evil for the Life of Man; he places the Gods in Council round him; he makes 143 Prayers pass to and fro before him; and Mankind adore him with Sacrifice. But all this grand Appearance, wherein Poetry paid a deference to Reason, is dash'd and mingled with the Imperfection of our Nature; not only with the applying our Passions to the supreme Being (for Men have always been treated with this Complyance to their Notions) but that he is not even exempted from our common Appetites and Frailties : For he is made to eat, drink, and sleep : but this his Admirers would imagine to be only a grosser way of representing a general Notion of Happiness, because he says in one place,  144 that the Food of the Gods was not of the same Nature with ours. But upon the whole, while he endeavour'd to speak of a Deity without a right Information, he was forc'd to take him from that Image he discover'd in Man ; and (like one who being dazled with the Sun in the Heavens, would view him as he is reflected in a River) he has taken off the Impression not only ruffled with the Emotion of our Passions, but obscur'd with the earthy Mixture of our Natures. The other Gods have all their Provinces assign'd 'em: "Every thing has its peculiar Deity, says  145 Maximus Tyrius , by which Homer would insinuate that the Godhead was present to all things." When they are consider'd farther, we find he has turn'd the Virtues and Endowments of our Minds into Persons , to make the Springs of Action become visible; and because they are given by the Gods, he represents them as Gods themselves descending from Heaven. In the same strong Light he shows our Vices when they occasion Misfortunes, like extraordinary Powers which inflict them upon us, and even our natural Punishments are represented as Punishers themselves. But when we come to see the manner they are introduc'd in, they are found feasting, fighting, wounded by Men, and shedding a sort of Blood; in which his Machines play a little too grosly : the Fable which was admitted to procure the Pleasure of Surprize, violently oppresses the Allegory, and it may be lost labour to search for it in every minute Circumstance, if indeed it was intended to be there. The main Design was however Philosophical, the Dress the Poet's, which is us'd for necessity and allow'd to be ornamental. And there will be something still to be offer'd in his Defence, if he has both preserved the grand Moral from being obscur'd, and adorn'd the Parts of his Works with such Sentiments of the Gods as belong'd to the Age he liv'd in; which that he did, appears from his having then had that Success for which Allegory was contriv'd. "It is the Madness of Man, says  146 Maximus Tyrius , to dis-esteem what is plain and admire what is hidden; This the Poets discovering invented the Fable for a Remedy, when they treated of holy Matters; which being more obscure than Conversation, and more clear than the Riddle, is a Mean between Knowledge and Ignorance; believ'd partly for being agreeable, and partly for being wonderful. Thus as Poets in Name, and Philosophers in Effect, they drew Mankind gradually to a search after Truth, when the Name of Philosopher would have been harsh and displeasing." When Homer proceeds to tell us our Duty to these superior Beings, we find Prayer, Sacrifice, Lustration, and all the Rites which were esteem'd religious, constantly recommended under fear of their Displeasure. We find too a Notion of the Soul's subsisting after this Life, but for want of Revelation he knows not what to reckon the Happiness of a future State, to any one who was not deify'd : Which is plain from the Speech of  147 Achilles to Ulysses in the Region of the dead; where he tells him, that "he would rather serve the poorest Creature upon Earth than rule over all the departed." It was chiefly for this Reason that Plato excluded him his Common-Wealth; he thought Homer spoke indecently of the Gods, and dreadfully of a future State; in which Sentence he has made no Allowance for the Times he writ in. But if he can not be defended in every thing as a Theologist, yet we may say in respect of his Poetry, that he has enrich'd it from Theology with true Sentiments for Profit, adorn'd it with Allegories for Pleasure, and by using some Machines which have no farther Significancy or are so refin'd as to make it doubted if they have any, he has however produc'd that Character in Poetry which we call the Marvellous , and from which the Agreeable (according to Aristotle ) is always inseparable. 148 If we take the State of Greece at his time in a Political View, we find it a 149 disunited Country, made up of small States; and whatever was manag'd in War amounted to no more than intestine Skirmishes or Pyracies abroad, which were easily reveng'd on account of their Disunion. Thus one People stole Europa , and another Io ; the Gr aecians took Hesione from Troy , and the Trojans took Helena from Greece in Revenge. But this last having greater Friends and Alliances than any upon whom the Rapes had hitherto fallen, the Ruin of Troy was the Consequence; and the Force of the Asiatick Coasts was so broken, that this Accident put an end to the Age of Pyracies. Then the intestine Broils of Greece (which had been discontinued during the League) were renew'd upon its Dissolution. War and Sedition mov'd People from Place to Place during its want of Inhabitants; Exiles from one Country were receiv'd for Kings in another; and Leaders took Tracts of Ground to bestow them upon their Followers. Commerce was neglected, living at home unsafe, and nothing of Moment transacted by any but against their Neighbours : Athens only, where the People were undisturb'd because it was a barren Soil which no Body coveted, had begun to send Colonies abroad, being over-stock'd with Inhabitants. Now a Poem coming out at so seasonable a Time, with a Moral capable of healing these Disorders by promoting Union , we may reasonably think it was design'd for that End to which it is so peculiarly adapted. If we imagine therefore that Homer was a Politician in this Affair, we may suppose him to have look'd back into the Ages past, to see if at any time the Disorder had been less; and to have pitch'd upon that Story wherein it found a temporary Cure, that by celebrating it with all possible Honour he might instil a Desire of the same sort of Union into the Hearts of his Countrymen. This indeed was a Work which could belong to none but a Poet, when Governors had Power only over small Territories, and the numerous Governments were every way independent. It was then that all the Charms of Poetry were call'd forth to insinuate the important Glory of an Alliance, and the Iliad deliver'd from the Muses with all the Pomp of Words and artificial Influence. Union among themselves was recommended, Peace at home, and Glory abroad : And lest this should be render'd useless by Mismanagements, he lets us into farther Lessons concerning it. How when his Kings quarrel, their Subjects suffer; when they act in Conjunction, Victory attends them. When they meet in Council, Plans are drawn and Provisions made for future Action; and when in the Field, the Arts of War are describ'd with the greatest Exactness. These were Lectures of general Concern to Mankind, proper for the Poet to deliver and Kings to attend to; such as made Porphyry write of the Profit that Princes might receive from Homer ; and Stratocles, Hermias , and Frontinus extract military Discipline out of him. Thus tho' Plato has banish'd him from one imaginary Commonwealth, he has still been serviceable to many real Kingdoms. 150 The Morality of Greece could not be perfect while there was a Weakness in its Government; Faults in Politicks are occasion'd by Faults in Ethicks, and occasion them in their turn. The Division into so many States was the rise of frequent Quarrels, whereby Men were bred up in a kind of rough untractable Disposition. Bodily Strength met with the greatest Honours, because it was daily necessary to the Subsistence of little Governments; and that headlong Courage which throws itself forward to Enterprize and Plunder, was universally caress'd, because it carry'd all things before it. It is no wonder in an Age of such Education and Customs, that, as  151 Thucydides says, "Robbing was honour'd, provided it were done with Gallantry, and that the ancient Poets made People question one another as they sail'd by, if they were Thieves? as a thing for which no one ought either to be scorn'd or upbraided." These were the sort of Actions which the Singers then recorded, and it was out of such an Age that Homer was to take his Subjects. For this reason (not a want of Morality in him) we see a boasting Temper and unmanag'd Roughness in the Spirit of his Heroes, which ran out in Pride, Anger, or Cruelty. It is not in him as in our modern Romances , where Men are drawn in Perfection, and we but read with a tender Weakness what we can neither apply nor emulate. Homer writ for Men, and therefore he writ of them; if the World had been better, he would have shown it so; as the Matter now stands, we see his People with the turn of his Age, insatiably thirsting after Glory and Plunder; for which however he has found them a lawful Cause, and taken care to retard their Success by those very Faults. In the Prosecution of the Story every Part of it has its Lessons of Morality : There is brotherly Love in Agamemnon and Menelaus , Friendship in Achilles and Patroclus , and the Love of his Country in Hector . But since we have spoken of the Iliad as more particular for its Politicks, we may consider the Odysses as its Moral is more directly fram'd for Ethicks. It carries the Heroe through a world of Trials both of the dangerous and pleasurable Nature. It shows him first under most surprizing Weights of Adversity, among Shipwrecks and Savages; all these he is made to pass through in the Methods by which it becomes a Man to conquer; a Patience in suffering, and a Presence of Mind in every Accident. It shows him again in another View, tempted with the Baits of idle or unlawful Pleasures, and then points out the Methods of being safe from them. But if in general we consider the care our Author has taken to fix his Lessons of Morality by the Proverbs and Precepts he delivers, we shall not wonder if Greece which afterwards gave the Appellation of Wise to Men who settled single Sentences of Truth, should give him the Title of the Father of Virtue for introducing such a Number. To be brief, if we take the Opinion of  152 Horace , he has propos'd him to us as a Master of Morality; he lays down the common Philosophical Division of Good into pleasant, profitable , and honest ; and then asserts that Homer has more fully and clearly instructed us in each of them, than the most rigid Philosophers. Some indeed have thought notwithstanding all this, that Homer had only a design to please in his Inventions; and that others have since extracted Morals out of his Stories (and indeed all Stories are capable of being us'd so.) But this is an Opinion concerning Poetry which the World has rather degenerated into, than begun with. The Traditions of Orpheus's civilizing Mankind by Hymns on the Gods, with others of the like Nature, may show there was a better use of the Art both known and practis'd. There is also a remarkable Passage of this kind in the third Book of the Odysses , that Agamemnon left one of the  153 Poets of his Times in the Court when he sail'd for Troy ; and that his Queen was preserv'd virtuous by his Songs, 'till Æ gysthus was forc'd to expel him in order to debauch her. Here he has hinted what a true Poetical Spirit can do when apply'd to the Promotion of Virtue; and from this one may judge he could not but design That himself, which he recommends as the Duty and Merit of his Profession. Others since his Time may have seduc'd the Art to worse Intentions; but they who are offended at the Liberties of some Poets, should not judge all in the gross for trifling or Corruption; especially when the Evidence runs so strongly for any One to the contrary. We may in general go on to observe, that the time when Homer was born did not abound in Learning. For where-ever Politicks and Morality is weak, it wants its peaceable Air to thrive in, and that Opportunity which is not known in the Ages of unsettled Life. He is himself the Man from whom we have the first Accounts of Antiquity, either in its Actions or Learning; from whom we hear what Æ gypt or Greece could inform him in, and whatever himself could discover by the Strength of Nature or Industry. But however that we may not mistake the Elogies of those Ancients who call him the Father of Arts and Sciences , and be surpriz'd to find so little of them (as they are now in Perfection) in his Works; we should know that this Character is not to be understood at large, as if he had included the full and regular Systems of every thing : He is to be consider'd professedly only in Quality of a Poet; this was his Business, to which, as whatever he knew was to be subservient, so he has not fail'd to introduce those Strokes of Knowledge from the whole Circle of Arts and Sciences, which the Subject demanded either for Necessity or Ornament. This will appear on a fair View of him in each of these Lights. 154 Before his Time there were no Historians in Greece: He treated Historically of past Transactions, according as he could be inform'd by Tradition, Song, or whatever Method there was of preserving their Memory. For this we have the Consent of Antiquity; they have generally more appeal'd to his Authority, and more insisted on it than on the Testimony of any other Writer, when they treat of the Rites, Customs, and Manners of the first Times. They have generally believ'd that the Acts of Tydeus at Thebes , the second Siege of that City, the Settlement of Rhodes , the Battel between the Curetes and the Æ tolians, the Account of the Kings of Mycen ae by the Sceptre of Agamemnon , the Acts of the Greeks at Troy , and many other such Accounts, are some of them wholly preserv'd by him, and the rest as faithfully related as by any Historian. Nor perhaps was all of his Invention which seems to be feign'd, but rather frequently the obscure Traces and Remains of real Persons and Actions; which as  155 Strabo observes, when History was transmitted by Oral Tradition, might be mix'd with Fable before it came into the Hands of the Poet. "This happen'd (says he) to Herodotus , the first 'professed Historian, who is often as fabulous as Homer when he defers to the common Reports of Countreys; and it is not to be reckon'd to either as a fault, but as a necessity of the Times." Nay, the very Passages which cause us to tax them at this distance with being fabulous, might be occasion'd by their Diligence, and a fear of erring, if they too hastily rejected those Reports which had pass'd current in the Nations they describ'd. 156 Before his Time there was no such thing as Geography in Greece . For this we have the Suffrage of  157 Strabo the best of Geographers, who approves the Opinion of Hipparchus and other Ancients, that Homer was the very Author of it; and upon this Account begins his Treatise of the Science itself with an Encomium on him. As to the general Part of it, we find he had a Knowledge of the Earth's being surrounded with the Ocean , because he makes the Sun and Stars both to rise and set in it; and that he knew the Use of the Stars is plain from his makings  158 Ulysses sail by the Observation of them. But the Instance oftnest alledg'd upon this Point is the  159 Shield of Achilles: where he places the Earth encompass'd with the Sea , and gives the Stars the Names they are yet known by, as the Hyades, Pleiades , the Bear , and Orion . By the three first of these he represents the Constellations of the Northern Region; and in the last he gives a single Representative of the Southern, to which (as it were for a counter-balance) he adds a Title of Greatness, ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbOHgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . Then he tells us that the Bear , or Stars of the Arctick Circle , never disappear; as an Observation which agrees with no other. And if to this we add (what Eratosthenes thought he meant) that the five Plates which were fastened on the Shield, divided it by the Lines where they met, into the five Zones , it will appear an original design of Globes and Spheres . In the particular Parts of Geography , his Knowledge is intirely incontestable. Strabo refers to him upon all occasions, allowing that he knew the Extreams of the Earth, some of which he names and others describes by Signs, as the Fortunate Islands . The same  160 Author takes notice of his Accounts concerning the several Soils, Plants, Animals, and Customs; as Æ gypt; 's being fertile of medicinal Herbs, Lybia 's Fr uitfulness, where the Sheep have Horns, and yean thrice a Year, &c. which are Knowledges that make Geography more various and profitable. But what all have agreed to celebrate is his Description of Greece ; which has had Laws made for its Preservation, and Contests between Governments decided by its Authority : Which  161 Strabo acknowledges to have no Epithet, or ornamental Expression for any Place, that is not drawn from its Nature, Quality, or Circumstances; and professes after so long an Interval to deviate from it only where the Countrey had undergone Alterations, that cast the Description into Obscurity. 162 In his time, Rhetorick was not known; that Art took its Rise out of Poetry, which was not 'till then establish'd. "The Oratorial Elocution (says  163 Strabo ) is but an Imitation of the Poetical : this appear'd first and was approv'd : They who imitated it took off the Measures, but still preserv'd all the other Parts of Poetry in their Writings : Such as these were Cadmus the Milesian, Pherecydes , and Hecat aeus . Then their Followers took something more from what was left, and at last Elocution descended into the Prose which is now among us." But if Rhetorick is owing to Poetry, the Obligation is still more due to Homer . He (as  164 Quintilian tells us) gave both the Pattern and Rise to all the Parts of it. " Hic omnibus eloquentioe partibus exemplum & ortum dedit : hunc nemo in magnis rebus sublimitate, in parvis proprietate, superavit. Idem letus & pressus, jucundus & gravis, tum copia tum brevitate admirabilis, nec Poetica modo sed oratoria virtute eminentissimus. " From him therefore they who settled the Art found it proper to deduce the Rules, which was easily done, when they had divided their Observations into the Kinds and the Ornaments of Elocution. For the Kinds , the "Ancients (says  165 A. Gell .) settled them according to the three which they observe in his principal Speakers; his Ulysses who is magnificent and flowing, his Menelaus who is short and close, and his Nestor who is moderate and dispassion'd, and has a kind of middle Eloquence participating of both the former." And for the Ornaments ,  166 Aristotle , the great Master of the Rhetoricians, shows what deference is paid to Homer , when he orders the Orator to lay down his Heads, and express both the Manners and Affections of his Work with an Imitation of that Diction, and those Figures, which the divine Homer excel'd in. This is the constant Language of those who succeeded him, and the Opinion so far prevail'd as to make  167 Quintilian observe, that they who have written concerning the Arts of Speaking, take from Homer most of the Instances of their Similitudes, Amplifications, Examples, Digressions, and Arguments. 168 As to Natural Philosophy , the Age was not arriv'd in which it flourish'd; however some of its Notions may be trac'd in him. As when he says that the Fountains and Rivers come from the Ocean, he holds a Circulation of Fluids in the Earth. But as this is a Branch of Learning which does not lie much in the way of a Poet who speaks of Heroes and Wars; the desire to prove his Knowledge this way has only run  169 Politian and others into trifling Inferences : as when they would have it that he understood Nature, because he mentions Sun, Rain, Wind, and Thunder. The most probable way of making out his Knowledge in this kind, is by supposing he couch'd it in Allegories ; and that he sometimes us'd the Names of the Gods as his Terms for the Elements , as the Chymists now use them for Metals . But in applying this to him we must tread very carefully; not searching for Allegory too industriously where the Passage may instruct by Example; and endeavouring rather to find the Fable an Ornament to what is easily known, than to make it a Cover to curious and unknown Problems. 170 As for Medicine , something of it must have been understood in that Age; though it was so far from Perfection that (according to  171 Celsus ) what concern'd Diet was invented long afterwards by Hippocrates . The Accidents of Life make the Search after Remedies too indispensible a Duty to be neglected at any time. Accordingly he  172 tells us, that the Æ gyptians who had many medicinal Plants in their Countrey, were all Physicians : and perhaps he might have learnt his own Skill from his Acquaintance with that Nation. The State of War which Greece had liv'd in, requir'd a Knowledge in the healing of Wounds : and this might make him breed his Princes, Achilles , Patroclus , Podalirius , and Machaon to the Science. What Homer thus attributes to others he knew himself, and he has given us reason to believe, not slightly. For if we consider his Insight into the Structure of the human Body, it is so nice, that he has been judg'd by some to have wounded his Heroes with too much Science : Or if we observe his Cure of Wounds, which are the Accidents proper to an Epic Poem, we find him directing the Chirurgical Operation, sometimes infusing  173 Lenitives, and at other times bitter Powders, when the Effusion of Blood requir'd astringent Qualities. 174 For Statuary, it appears by the Accounts of Æ gypt and the Palladium , that there was enough of it very early in the World for those Images which were requir'd in the Worship of their Gods; but there are none mention'd as valuable in Greece so early, nor was the Art establish'd on its Rules before Homer . He found it agreeable to the Worship in use, and necessary for his Machinery, that his Gods should be cloath'd in Bodies : Wherefore he took care to give them such as carry'd the utmost Perfection of the human Form; and distinguish'd them from each other even in this superior Beauty, with such Marks as were agreeable to each of the Deities. "This, says  175 Strabo , awaken'd the Conceptions of the eminent Statuaries, while they strove to keep up the Grandeur of that Idea which Homer had impress'd upon their Imagination; as we read of Phidias concerning the Statue of Jupiter ." And because they copy'd their Gods from him in their best Performances, his Descriptions became the Characters which were afterwards pursu'd in all Works of a good Taste. Hence came the common Saying of the Ancients, "That either Homer was the only Man who had seen the Forms of the Gods, or the only one who had shown them to Men;" a Passage which  176 Madam Dacier wrests to prove the Truth of his Theology, different from Strabo 's Acceptation of it. There are, besides what we have spoken of, other Sciences pretended to be found in him. Thus Macrobius discovers that the Chain with which  177 Jupiter says he could lift the World, is a metaphysical Notion, that means a Connexion of all Things from the supream Being to the meanest Part of the Creation. Others, to prove him skilful in judicial Astrology, bring a Quotation concerning the Births of  178 Hector and Polydamas on the same Night; who were nevertheless of different Qualifications, one excelling in War, and the other in Eloquence. Others again will have him to be vers'd in Magick, from his Stories concerning Ciree . These and many of the like Nature are Interpretations strain'd or trifling, such as Homer does not want for a Proof of his Learning, and by which we contribute nothing to raise his Character, while we sacrifice our Judgment to him in the Eyes of others. It is sufficient to have gone thus far, in shewing he was a Father of Learning, a Soul capable of ranging over the whole Creation with an intellectual View, shining alone in an Age of Obscurity, and shining beyond those who have had the Opportunity of more learned Ages; leaving behind him a Work adorn'd with the Knowledge of his own Time, and in which he has before- hand broken up the Fountains of several Sciences which were brought nearer to Perfection by Posterity : A Work which shall always stand at the top of the sublime Character, to be gaz'd at by Readers with an Admiration of its Perfection, and by Writers with a Despair that it should ever be emulated with Success. FINIS.
